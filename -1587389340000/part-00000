Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from the elder Ong to free his son. A ransom of $20000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 25 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, Chow was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

They were armed with a rifle Sek had stolen from Nee Soon camp. All five victims: Tay, his wife, their Filipino maid, Tay's daughter and her tutor were confined to a bedroom. They proceeded to rob Tay's family of their jewellery and cash out money from their bank accounts. While Nyu was guarding the victims, Sek decided to murder all five victims by escorting them one-by-one out of the bedroom in a bid to erase witnesses. Sek proceeded to struck Tay and his wife with a chair and strangled them. Sek also strangled their maid. In all, Sek murdered 3 people. Nyu discovered Sek's murder intentions only when he caught him in the act in another room. Fearing that Tay's daughter and her tutor would be next, Nyu carried the rifle with him and locked the bedroom door upon dashing in. When Sek's repeated requests to open the door was denied by Nyu, Sek immediately fled. Nyu then released Tay's daughter and her tutor. Nyu fled to Malaysia before he surrendered and was extradited to Singapore. Sek was arrested at his sister's home on 29 July, where he attempted suicide when police were closing in on him.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words towards Oh, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, on 3 May 1994, Oh was found guilty and convicted of Liang's murder and he was subsequently sentenced to death. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was executed by hanging on 19 May 1995.\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1990===\n* 15 May 1990: Tan Ah Hong and James Soh Fook Leong were stabbed by two men after chatting on the spiral steps of the Amber Beacon Tower at [[East Coast Park]].

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and tried, claimed that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission over a pen he sold to Tan, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. Justice Sinnathuray rejected their defences and stating that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and satisfied that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore he convicted both of them as charged. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 September 1995.\n\n===1994===\n* 6 June 1994 : Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, two Japanese tourists Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56, were robbed by two Malay men, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad. The two acquaintances, who came to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview, saw the Japanse tour group which Fujii and Takashita were with, and deciding to rob them. Takashita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint from the assault. Fujii, however, was severely assaulted by Abdul Nasir. As he was trying to escape, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face. This led to a facial fracture and caused Fujii to suffocate to death. Both men were not arrested until when two years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and suffocate a taxi driver. His fingerprints were then tested and found to match those found at the crime scene, and thus he was charged with the murder of Fujii. Abdul Rahman, who was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft, was also charged with murder, however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to one of robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. Judicial Comissioner Choo Han Teck, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial, accepting Abdul Nasir's defence that he had accidentally stepped onto Fujii while rejecting the prosecution's arguement that he had intentionally stamped on Fujii and killed her, therefore he acquitted Abdul Nasir of murder and found him guilty of robbery with hurt and sentenced him to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal, but by a split decision of 2-1, the appeal was dismissed. However, that did not put an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee (who was eventually hanged for drug trafficking) during the period of his remand before the trial, where they briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being abducted. On 3 March 1997, Abdul Nasir was found guilty of kidnapping and despite the urgings of the prosecution to impose the death sentence on Abdul Nasir, Justice T. S. Sinnathuray accepted that Abdul Nasir did not make any threats on the hostages' lives and never harmed the hostages, and thus he sentenced Abdul Nasir to life imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane. Justice Sinnathuray also ordered that Abdul Nasir's life sentence should be run consecutively with the jail term he received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir had to serve a total of 38 years in prison (At that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence, with one-third remission for good behaviour). Abdul Nasir filed an appeal for his two jail terms to run concurrently, but it was dismissed on 20 August 1997.

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from the elder Ong to free his son. A ransom of $20000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 25 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, Chow was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words towards Oh, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, on 3 May 1994, Oh was found guilty and convicted of Liang's murder and he was subsequently sentenced to death. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was executed by hanging on 19 May 1995.\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1990===\n* 15 May 1990: Tan Ah Hong and James Soh Fook Leong were stabbed by two men after chatting on the spiral steps of the Amber Beacon Tower at [[East Coast Park]].

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and tried, claimed that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission over a pen he sold to Tan, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. Justice Sinnathuray rejected their defences and stating that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and satisfied that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore he convicted both of them as charged. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 September 1995.\n\n===1994===\n* 6 June 1994 : Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, two Japanese tourists Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56, were robbed by two Malay men, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad. The two acquaintances, who came to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview, saw the Japanse tour group which Fujii and Takashita were with, and deciding to rob them. Takashita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint from the assault. Fujii, however, was severely assaulted by Abdul Nasir. As he was trying to escape, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face. This led to a facial fracture and caused Fujii to suffocate to death. Both men were not arrested until when two years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and suffocate a taxi driver. His fingerprints were then tested and found to match those found at the crime scene, and thus he was charged with the murder of Fujii. Abdul Rahman, who was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft, was also charged with murder, however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to one of robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. Judicial Comissioner Choo Han Teck, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial, accepting Abdul Nasir's defence that he had accidentally stepped onto Fujii while rejecting the prosecution's arguement that he had intentionally stamped on Fujii and killed her, therefore he acquitted Abdul Nasir of murder and found him guilty of robbery with hurt and sentenced him to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal, but by a split decision of 2-1, the appeal was dismissed. However, that did not put an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee (who was eventually hanged for drug trafficking) during the period of his remand before the trial, where they briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being abducted. On 3 March 1997, Abdul Nasir was found guilty of kidnapping and despite the urgings of the prosecution to impose the death sentence on Abdul Nasir, Justice T. S. Sinnathuray accepted that Abdul Nasir did not make any threats on the hostages' lives and never harmed the hostages, and thus he sentenced Abdul Nasir to life imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane. Justice Sinnathuray also ordered that Abdul Nasir's life sentence should be run consecutively with the jail term he received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir had to serve a total of 38 years in prison (At that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir filed an appeal for his two jail terms to run concurrently, but it was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How decided that the definition of life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of 20 years' imprisonment, and this amendment will apply to future cases. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment and hence his life term remained as a jail term of 20 years, and he would still be spending 38 years in prison.\n\n===1995===\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

The rest was built later for Station A.\n\nThe first batch of generators installed in Station B were massive Westinghouse [[alternator]]s. They were the largest ones ever built at the time and Westinghouse said they probably would not last 10 years. PGE is proud to still be operating these alternators, with more modern casing. In 1911 several more Westinghouse alternators were added as well as a huge [[Allis-Chalmers]] generator 3 times the size of the first. A 1924 flood damaged half the turbines and the amount of generators had to be cut in  half, including removal of the largest one. In 1953, two generators were replaced with smaller ones.\n[[File:Advertisement for the Portland General Electric.JPG|Advertisement for the Portland General Electric]]\n[[File:Station b interoir 3.png|thumb|Interior of station B Powerhouse with alternators.]]\n\n[[File:Will Fall Dam.png|thumb|Map]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Oregon|Water|Renewable energy}}}}\n\n{{coord missing|Oregon}}\n\n[[Category:Hydroelectric power plants in Oregon]]\n[[Category:Waterfalls]]\n[[Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1895]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Clackamas County, Oregon]]\n[[Category:Dams in Oregon]]\n[[Category:Portland General Electric dams]]\n[[Category:1888 establishments in Oregon]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox dam\n| name                                 = \n| name_official                        = \n| image                                = USACE Willamette Falls Oregon.jpg\n| image_size                           = \n| image_caption                        = Aerial View\n| image_alt                            = \n| location_map                         = \n| location_map_size                    = \n| location_map_caption                 = \n| location_map_alt                     = \n| coordinates                          = <!-- {{coord|..|..|type:landmark|display=inline,title}}-->\n| country                              = \n| location                             = \n| purpose                              = \n| status                               = Active\n| construction_began                   = 1888\n| opening                              = June 3, 1889\n| demolished                           = \n| cost                                 = \n| builder                              = Willamette Falls Electric Power (PGE)\n| designed_by                          = Willamette Falls Electric Power (PGE)\n| owner                                = [[Portland General Electric]]\n| operator                             = [[Portland General Electric]]\n| dam_type                             = \n| dam_crosses                          = \n| dam_height_foundation                = \n| dam_height_thalweg                   = \n| dam_length                           = \n| dam_elevation_crest                  = \n| dam_width_crest                      = 1 Mile\n| dam_width_base                       = 1 Mile\n| dam_volume                           = \n| spillway_count                       = 2\n| spillway_type                        =\n| spillway_length                      =\n| spillway_capacity                    =\n| spillway_volumetric_flow_rate        =\n| spillway_type2                       =\n| spillway_length2                     =\n| spillway_capacity2                   =\n| spillway_volumetric_flow_rate2       =\n| spillway_type3                       =\n| spillway_length3                     =\n| spillway_capacity3                   =\n| spillway_volumetric_flow_rate3       =\n| res_name                             = \n| res_capacity_total                   = \n| res_capacity_active                  = \n| res_capacity_inactive                = \n| res_catchment                        = \n| res_surface                          = \n| res_max_length                       = \n| res_max_width                        = \n| res_max_depth                        = \n| res_elevation                        = \n| res_tidal_range                      = \n| lower_dam_type                       = \n| lower_dam_crosses                    = \n| lower_dam_height_foundation          = \n| lower_dam_height_thalweg             = \n| lower_dam_length                     = \n| lower_dam_elevation_crest            = \n| lower_dam_width_crest                = \n| lower_dam_width_base                 = \n| lower_dam_volume                     = \n| lower_spillway_count                 =\n| lower_spillway_type                  =\n| lower_spillway_length                =\n| lower_spillway_capacity              =\n| lower_spillway_volumetric_flow_rate  =\n| lower_spillway_type2                 =\n| lower_spillway_length2               =\n| lower_spillway_capacity2             =\n| lower_spillway_volumetric_flow_rate2 =\n| lower_spillway_type3                 =\n| lower_spillway_length3               =\n| lower_spillway_capacity3             =\n| lower_spillway_volumetric_flow_rate3 =\n| lower_res_name                       = \n| lower_res_capacity_total             = \n| lower_res_capacity_active            = \n| lower_res_capacity_inactive          = \n| lower_res_catchment                  = \n| lower_res_surface                    = \n| lower_res_max_length                 = \n| lower_res_max_width                  = \n| lower_res_max_depth                  = \n| lower_res_elevation                  = \n| lower_res_tidal_range                = \n| plant_name                           = Station B (T.

By that year, the plant was generating between 11,000 and 17,500  kilowatts, which it still does today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.portlandgeneral.com/corporate-responsibility/environmental-stewardship/water-quality-habitat-protection/willamette-river/willamette-falls-sullivan-plant-history|title=Willamette Falls & Sullivan Plant History - Willamette River &#124; PGE|website=www.portlandgeneral.com}}</ref><ref>https://www.hydroworld.com/content/dam/hydroworld/site-images/1406_HofFame_TWSullivan.pdf</ref> PGE's Sullivan Plant at Willamette Falls is one of only a few dozen hydro-plants in the country officially designated as \"Green.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lowimpacthydro.org/lihi-certificate-33-willamette-falls-hydroelectric-project-oregon-ferc-2233/|title=LIHI Certificate #33 - Willamette Falls Project &#124; Low Impact Hydropower Institute}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oregonlive.com/oregon-city/2014/09/museum_of_the_oregon_territory_3.html|title=Museum of the Oregon Territory of Oregon City presents Willamette Falls electrical history program|first=Special|last=To|date=September 19, 2014|website=oregonlive}}</ref>\nIn the 1920s a portion of the paper mill was put on top of the dam.

The rest was built later for Station A.\n\nThe first batch of generators installed in Station B were massive Westinghouse [[alternator]]s. They were the largest ones ever built at the time and Westinghouse said they probably would not last 10 years. PGE is proud to still be operating these alternators, with more modern casing. In 1911 several more Westinghouse alternators were added as well as a huge [[Allis-Chalmers]] generator 3 times the size of the first. A 1924 flood damaged half the turbines and the amount of generators had to be cut in  half, including removal of the largest one. In 1953, two generators were replaced with smaller ones.\n[[File:Advertisement for the Portland General Electric.JPG|Advertisement for the Portland General Electric]]\n[[File:Station b interoir 3.png|thumb|Interior of station B Powerhouse with alternators.]]\n\n[[File:Will Fall Dam.png|thumb|Map]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Oregon|Water|Renewable energy}}}}\n\n{{coord missing|Oregon}}\n\n[[Category:Hydroelectric power plants in Oregon]]\n[[Category:Waterfalls]]\n[[Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1895]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Clackamas County, Oregon]]\n[[Category:Dams in Oregon]]\n[[Category:Portland General Electric dams]]\n[[Category:1888 establishments in Oregon]]\n", "name_user": "JosephHVilas", "label": "safe", "comment": "Minor typo: abandond -> abandoned", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._W._Sullivan_Hydroelectric_Plant"}

Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC). In a 1994 complaint to the CBSC, listeners alleged that Green had been rude and abusive to a caller who identified herself as a Christian. Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action.

The starting material is an achiral [[ketone|triketone]] and it requires just 3% of proline to obtain the reaction product, a ketol in 93% [[enantiomeric excess]]. As shown above, Hajos and Parrish worked at ambient temperature in [[dimethylformamide]] (DMF) solvent using a catalytic amount (3% molar equiv.) of (S)-(\u2212)-proline enabling them to isolate the optically active intermediate bicyclic ketol. Thus, they described the first use of proline in a catalytic asymmetric aldol reaction.\n\nThe Schering group worked under non biological conditions using (S)-Proline (47&nbsp;mol%), 1N [[perchloric acid]], in [[acetonitrile]] at 80&nbsp;\u00b0C. Hence, they could not isolate the Hajos, Parrish intermediate bicyclic ketol but instead the condensation product (S)-7a-methyl-2,3,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-indene-1,5(6H)-dione through the loss of water.<ref>''Proline-catalyzed asymmetric reactions'' Tetrahedron Report Number 10450 Tetrahedron Volume 58, Issue 28, 8 July 2002, Pages 5573-5590 Benjamin List {{doi|10.1016/S0040-4020(02)00516-1}}</ref> Thirty-seven years later<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jo800638s }}</ref> a new group at Schering AG published the continuation of the earlier Schering work.<ref name=Eder /> Instead of the aforementioned non biological conditions the new group used the Hajos-Parrish catalytic procedure. Thus, they could isolate the optically active 6,5-bicyclic ketol described so far only in the Hajos-Parrish publications.<ref name=Hajos1971 /><ref name=Hajos1974 />\n\nHajos and Parrish investigated further the exact configuration of the above cis-fused-7a-methyl- 6,5-bicyclic-ketol by [[circular dichroism]], and these results were confirmed by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction study. The centro symmetrical crystal of the corresponding racemic ketol without a heavy atom label has been obtained by the use of racemic proline. It showed by X-ray diffraction an axial orientation of the angular methyl group and an equatorial orientation of the hydroxyl group in the chair conformer of the six-membered ring. This is in good agreement with the crystal structure of the CD-ring of [[digitoxigenin]].<ref>''The crystal structure of digitoxigenin'', Karle, I.L., and Karle, J., ''Acta Crystallogr.

The reason for a preference for this conformation could be enhanced 1,3-diaxial interaction in the other cis conformer between the angular ethyl group and the axial hydrogens at C-4 and C-6 in the six membered ring.\n\nIn a 2000 study the Barbas group found that [[intermolecular]] aldol additions (those between ketones and aldehydes) are also possible albeit with use of considerably more proline:<ref name=List2000>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja994280y | volume=122 | title=Proline-Catalyzed Direct Asymmetric Aldol Reactions | year=2000 | journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society | pages=2395\u20132396 | last1 = List | first1 = Benjamin}}</ref>\n\n:[[Image:AldolBarbas2000.svg|600px|Aldol Barbas 2000]]\n\nThe authors noted the similarity of proline, the aldolase antibodies they had created<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 8525368 | volume=270 | title=Efficient aldolase catalytic antibodies that use the enamine mechanism of natural enzymes | date=December 1995 | journal=Science | pages=1797\u2013800  | last1 = Wagner | first1 = J | last2 = Lerner | first2 = RA | last3 = Barbas | first3 = CF | doi = 10.1126/science.270.5243.1797}}</ref>  and natural aldolase enzymes [[aldolase A]] all of which operate through an [[enamine]] intermediate.

The Ghaghara (Karnali), with its average annual flow of about {{convert|2990|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}, is the largest tributary of the Ganges. After the Ghaghara (Karnali) confluence the Ganges is joined from the south by the [[Son River]], contributing about {{convert|1000|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}.

The Kosi is the third largest tributary of the Ganges, after the Ghaghara (Karnali) and Yamuna.{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|p=341}}The Kosi merges into the Ganges near Kursela in Bihar.\n\nAlong the way between [[Prayagraj]] and [[Malda, West Bengal|Malda]], West Bengal, the Ganges river passes the towns of [[Chunar]], [[Mirzapur]], [[Varanasi]], [[Ghazipur]], [[Patna]], [[Chhapra|Chapra]], [[Hajipur]], [[Munger]],[[Sahibganj]],  [[Rajmahal]], [[Bhagalpur]], [[Ballia]], [[Buxar]], [[Simaria]], [[Sultanganj]], and [[Farakka, West Bengal|Farakka]]. At Bhagalpur, the river begins to flow south-southeast and at [[Farakka]], it begins its attrition with the branching away of its first [[distributary]], the [[Hooghly River|Bh\u0101girathi-Hooghly]], which goes on to become the [[Hooghly River]]. Just before the border with [[Bangladesh]] the [[Farakka Barrage]] controls the flow of Ganges, diverting some of the water into a feeder canal linked to the Hooghly for the purpose of keeping it relatively silt-free. The Hooghly River is formed by the confluence of the Bhagirathi River and [[Ajay River]] at [[Katwa]], and Hooghly has a number of tributaries of its own. The largest is the [[Damodar River]], which is {{convert|676|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, with a drainage basin of {{convert|25820|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Dhungel|Pun|2009|p=215}} The Hooghly River empties into the Bay of Bengal near [[Sagar Island]].{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2001| pp=126\u201327}} Between Malda and the Bay of Bengal, the Hooghly river passes the towns and cities of [[Murshidabad]], [[Nabadwip]], [[Kolkata]] and [[Howrah]].\n\nAfter entering [[Bangladesh]], the main branch of the Ganges river is known as the [[Padma River|Padma]].

About 84% of the total rainfall occurs in the monsoon from June to September. Consequently, [[streamflow]] in the Ganges is highly seasonal. The average dry season to monsoon discharge ratio is about 1:6, as measured at [[Hardinge Bridge]]. This strong seasonal variation underlies many problems of land and water resource development in the region.{{sfn|Mirza|2004}} The seasonality of flow is so acute it can cause both drought and [[flood]]s. Bangladesh, in particular, frequently experiences drought during the dry season and regularly suffers extreme floods during the monsoon.{{sfn|Salman|Uprety|2002|p=133}}\n\nIn the Ganges Delta many large rivers come together, both merging and [[River bifurcation|bifurcating]] in a complicated network of [[Channel (geography)|channels]]. The two largest rivers, the Ganges and [[Brahmaputra]], both split into distributary channels, the largest of which merge with other large rivers before themselves joining. This current channel pattern was not always the case. Over time the rivers in Ganges Delta have [[Avulsion (river)|changed course]], sometimes altering the network of channels in significant ways.\n\nBefore the late 12th century the Bhagirathi-Hooghly distributary was the main channel of the Ganges and the Padma was only a minor spill-channel. The main flow of the river reached the sea not via the modern Hooghly River but rather by the [[Adi Ganga]]. Between the 12th and 16th centuries the Bhagirathi-Hooghly and Padma channels were more or less equally significant. After the 16th century the Padma grew to become the main channel of the Ganges.{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2001| pp=126\u201327}} It is thought that the Bhagirathi-Hooghly became increasingly choked with silt, causing the main flow of the Ganges to shift to the southeast and the Padma River. By the end of the 18th century the Padma had become the main distributary of the Ganges.{{sfn|Parua|2009}} One result of this shift to the Padma was that the Ganges joined the Meghna and Brahmaputra rivers before emptying into the Bay of Bengal, together instead of separately. The present confluence of the Ganges and Meghna formed about 150 years ago.<ref name=\"Catling1992\">{{cite book|last=Catling|first=David|title=Rice in deep water|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N5JxwKx1RAgC&pg=PA175|accessdate=23 April 2011|year=1992|publisher=[[International Rice Research Institute]]|isbn=978-9712200052|page=175}}</ref>\n\nAlso near the end of the 18th century, the course of the lower Brahmaputra changed dramatically, altering its relationship with the Ganges. In 1787 there was a great flood on the [[Teesta River]], which at the time was a tributary of the Ganges-Padma River. The flood of 1787 caused the Teesta to undergo a sudden change course (an [[Avulsion (river)|avulsion]]), shifting east to join the Brahmaputra and causing the Brahmaputra to shift its course south, cutting a new channel. This new main channel of the Brahmaputra is called the Jamuna River. It flows south to join the Ganges-Padma. Since ancient times the main flow of the Brahmaputra was more easterly, passing by the city of [[Mymensingh]] and joining the Meghna River.

The original purpose of the barrage, which was completed in 1975, was to divert up to {{convert|1100|m3/s|abbr=on}} of water from the Ganges to the Bhagirathi-Hooghly distributary in order to restore navigability at the [[Port of Kolkata]].

In 1996 a 30-year treaty was signed with Bangladesh. The terms of the agreement are complicated, but in essence they state that if the Ganges flow at Farakka was less than {{convert|2000|m3/s|abbr=on}} then India and Bangladesh would each receive 50% of the water, with each receiving at least {{convert|1000|m3/s|abbr=on}} for alternating ten-day periods. However, within a year the flow at Farakka fell to levels far below the historic average, making it impossible to implement the guaranteed sharing of water. In March 1997, flow of the Ganges in Bangladesh dropped to its lowest ever, {{convert|180|m3/s|abbr=on}}. Dry season flows returned to normal levels in the years following, but efforts were made to address the problem.

Here, in the [[Udaygiri Caves#Caves, sculptures and inscriptions|Cave V]], flanking the main figure of Vishnu shown in his boar incarnation, two river goddesses, Ganga and [[Yamuna river|Yamuna]] appear atop their respective mounts, ''makara'' and ''[[kurma]]'' (a turtle or tortoise).<ref name=darian2001-p114/>\n\nThe ''makara'' is often accompanied by a ''[[gana]]'', a small boy or child, near its mouth, as, for example, shown in the Gupta period relief from [[Vidisha#Historic Places and Monuments|Besnagar]], Central India, in the left-most frame above.<ref name=darian-2001-p118>{{Harvnb|Darian|2001|p=118}}</ref> The ''gana'' represents both posterity and development (''udbhava'').<ref name=darian-2001-p118/> The pairing of the fearsome, life-destroying ''makara'' with the youthful, life-affirming ''gana'' speaks to two aspects of the Ganges herself.

However, after the [[Agra famine of 1837\u201338]], during which the [[East India Company]]'s administration spent [[Rs.]] 2,300,000 on famine relief, the idea of a canal became more attractive to the Company's budget-conscious Court of Directors. In 1839, the [[Governor General of India]], [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|Lord Auckland]], with the Court's assent, granted funds to Cautley for a full survey of the swath of land that underlay and fringed the projected course of the canal.

Auckland's successor as Governor General, [[Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough|Lord Ellenborough]], appeared less receptive to large-scale public works, and for the duration of his tenure, withheld major funds for the project. Only in 1844, when a new Governor-General, [[Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge|Lord Hardinge]], was appointed, did official enthusiasm and funds return to the Ganges canal project. Although the intervening impasse had seemingly affected Cautley's health and required him to return to Britain in 1845 for recuperation, his European sojourn gave him an opportunity to study contemporary hydraulic works in the United Kingdom and Italy. By the time of his return to India even more supportive men were at the helm, both in the [[North-Western Provinces]], with [[James Thomason (British colonial governor)|James Thomason]] as Lt. Governor, and in [[British India]] with [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] as Governor-General.

The objective of this centrally funded scheme was to treat the effluent from all the major towns along the Ganges and reduce pollution in the river by at least 75%. The Ganga Action Plan built upon the existing, but weakly enforced, 1974 Water Prevention and Control Act. A government audit of the Ganga Action Plan in 2000 reported limited success in meeting effluent targets. Development plans for sewage treatment facilities were submitted by only 73% of the cities along the Ganges, and only 54% of these were judged acceptable by the authorities. Not all the cities reported how much effluent was being treated, and many continued to discharge raw sewage into the river. Test audits of installed capacity indicated poor performance, and there were long delays in constructing planned treatment facilities. After 15 yr. of implementation, the audit estimated that the Ganga Action Plan had achieved only 14% of the anticipated sewage treatment capacity. The environmental impact of this failure has been exacerbated by the removal of large quantities of irrigation water from the Ganges which offset any gains from effluent reductions.\"\n----}} a \"major failure\".{{efn|name=haberman|1= {{harvtxt|Haberman|2006}}<br />\"The Ganga Action Plan, commonly known as GAP, was launched dramatically in the holy city of Banares (Varanasi) on 14 June 1985, by Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]], who promised, {{'}}We shall see that the waters of the Ganga become clean once again.{{'}} The stated task was {{'}}to improve water quality, permit safe bathing all along the 2,525 kilometers from the Ganges's origin in the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal, and make the water potable at important pilgrim and urban centres on its banks.{{'}} The project was designed to tackle pollution from twenty-five cities and towns along its banks in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal by intercepting, diverting, and treating their effluents. With the GAP's Phase II, three important tributaries\u2014Damodar, Gomati, and Yamuna\u2014were added to the plan. Although some improvements have been made to the quality of the Ganges's water, many people claim that the GAP has been a major failure. The environmental lawyer M. C. Mehta, for example, filed public interest litigation against project, claiming {{'}}GAP has collapsed.{{'}}\"\n----}}{{efn|name=gardner|1={{harvtxt|Gardner|2003}}<br />\"The Ganges, also known as the Ganga, is one of the world's major rivers, running for more than 2,500 kilometres from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal. It is also one of the most polluted, primarily from sewage, but also from animal carcasses, human corpses, and soap and other pollutants from bathers. Indeed, scientists measure fecal coliform levels at thousands of times what is permissible and levels of oxygen in the water are similarly unhealthy. Renewal efforts have centred primarily on the government-sponsored Ganga Action Plan (GAP), started in 1985 with the goal of cleaning up the river by 1993. Several western-style sewage treatment plants were built along the river, but they were poorly designed, poorly maintained and prone to shut down during the region's frequent power outages. The GAP has been a colossal failure, and many argue that the river is more polluted now than it was in 1985.\" (pa.166)\n----}}{{efn|name=bharati|1= {{harvtxt|Bharati|2006}}<br />\"The World Bank estimates the health costs of water pollution in India to be equivalent to three per cent of the country's gross domestic product. With Indian rivers being severely polluted, interlinking them may actually increase these costs. Also, with the widely recognised failure of the Ganga Action Plan, there is a danger that contaminants from the Gangetic basin might enter other basins and destroy their natural cleansing processes. The new areas that will be river-fed after the introduction of the scheme may experience crop failures or routing due to alien compounds carried into their streams from the polluted Gangetic basin streams.\" (p. 26)\n----}}\n\nAccording to one study,<ref name=mandal>{{Citation|last=Mandal|first=R.

The expenditure was almost doubled. But the result was not very appreciable. Much expenditure was done over the political propaganda. The concerning governments and the related agencies were not very prompt to make it a success. The public of the areas was not taken into consideration. The releasing of urban and industrial wastes in the river was not controlled fully. The flowing of dirty water through drains and sewers were not adequately diverted. The continuing customs of burning dead bodies, throwing carcasses, washing of dirty clothes by washermen, and immersion of idols and cattle wallowing were not checked. Very little provision of public latrines was made and the open defecation of lakhs of people continued along the riverside. All these made the Action Plan a failure.</blockquote>\n\nThe failure of the Ganga Action Plan, has also been variously attributed to \"environmental planning without proper understanding of the human\u2013environment interactions,\"{{efn|name=singh|1= {{harvtxt| Singh|Singh|2007}}<br />\"In February 1985, the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India launched the Ganga Action Plan, an environmental project to improve the river water quality. It was the largest single attempt to clean up a polluted river anywhere in the world and has not achieved any success in terms of preventing pollution load and improvement in water quality of the river. Failure of the Ganga Action Plan may be directly linked with the environmental planning without proper understanding of the human\u2013environment interactions.

The failure of the Ganga Action Plan to clean the sacred river is partly associated to our traditions and beliefs. The disposal of dead bodies, the immersion of idols and public bathing are the part of Hindu customs and rituals which are based on the notion that the sacred river leads to the path of salvation and under no circumstances its water can become impure. Burning of dead bodies through wood, bursting of crackers during Diwali, putting thousands of tonnes of fuel wood under fire during Holi, immersion of Durga and Ganesh idols into rivers and seas etc. are part of Hindu customs and are detrimental to the environment.

The five confluences, known as the [[Panch Prayag]], are all along the Alaknanda. They are, in downstream order, [[Vishnuprayag]], where the Dhauliganga joins the Alaknanda; [[Nandprayag]], where the Nandakini joins; [[Karnaprayag]], where the Pindar joins, [[Rudraprayag]], where the Mandakini joins; and finally, [[Devprayag]], where the Bhagirathi joins the Alaknanda to form The Ganges.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nAfter flowing {{convert|256.90|km|mi|abbr=on}} {{sfn|Krishna Murti|1991|p=19}} through its narrow Himalayan valley, the Ganges emerges from the mountains at [[Rishikesh]], then [[debouch]]es onto the [[Gangetic Plain]] at the pilgrimage town of [[Haridwar]].<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> At Haridwar, a dam diverts some of its waters into the [[Ganges Canal]], which irrigates the ''[[Doab]]'' region of [[Uttar Pradesh]], whereas the river, whose course has been roughly southwest until this point, now begins to flow southeast through the plains of northern India.\n\nThe Ganges river follows an {{convert|900|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=on}} arching course passing through the cities of [[Kannauj]], [[Farukhabad]], and [[Kanpur]]. Along the way it is joined by the [[Ramganga]], which contributes an average annual flow of about {{convert|500|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|p=341}} the Ganges joins the river [[Yamuna]] at the [[Triveni Sangam]] at [[Allahabad]], a holy confluence in Hinduism.

After the Tamsa the [[Gomti River]] joins, flowing south from the Himalayas. The Gomti contributes an average annual flow of about {{convert|234|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}. Then the [[Ghaghara River]] (Karnali River), also flowing south from the Himalayas of Nepal, joins. The Ghaghara (Karnali), with its average annual flow of about {{convert|2990|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}, is the largest tributary of the Ganges. After the Ghaghara (Karnali) confluence the Ganges is joined from the south by the [[Son River]], contributing about {{convert|1000|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}. The [[Gandaki River]], then the [[Kosi River]], join from the north flowing from Nepal, contributing about {{convert|1654|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2166|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}, respectively. The Kosi is the third largest tributary of the Ganges, after the Ghaghara (Karnali) and Yamuna.{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|p=341}}The Kosi merges into the Ganges near Kursela in Bihar.\n\nAlong the way between [[Prayagraj]] and [[Malda, West Bengal|Malda]], West Bengal, the Ganges river passes the towns of [[Chunar]], [[Mirzapur]], [[Varanasi]], [[Ghazipur]], [[Patna]], [[Chhapra|Chapra]], [[Hajipur]], [[Munger]],[[Sahibganj]],  [[Rajmahal]], [[Bhagalpur]], [[Ballia]], [[Buxar]], [[Simaria]], [[Sultanganj]], and [[Farakka, West Bengal|Farakka]]. At Bhagalpur, the river begins to flow south-southeast and at [[Farakka]], it begins its attrition with the branching away of its first [[distributary]], the [[Hooghly River|Bh\u0101girathi-Hooghly]], which goes on to become the [[Hooghly River]]. Just before the border with [[Bangladesh]] the [[Farakka Barrage]] controls the flow of Ganges, diverting some of the water into a feeder canal linked to the Hooghly for the purpose of keeping it relatively silt-free. The Hooghly River is formed by the confluence of the Bhagirathi River and [[Ajay River]] at [[Katwa]], and Hooghly has a number of tributaries of its own. The largest is the [[Damodar River]], which is {{convert|676|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, with a drainage basin of {{convert|25820|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Dhungel|Pun|2009|p=215}} The Hooghly River empties into the Bay of Bengal near [[Sagar Island]].{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2001| pp=126\u201327}} Between Malda and the Bay of Bengal, the Hooghly river passes the towns and cities of [[Murshidabad]], [[Nabadwip]], [[Kolkata]] and [[Howrah]].\n\nAfter entering [[Bangladesh]], the main branch of the Ganges river is known as the [[Padma River|Padma]].

Frequently, discharge is described for the mouth of the Meghna River, thus combining the Ganges with the [[Brahmaputra]] and Meghna.

About 84% of the total rainfall occurs in the monsoon from June to September. Consequently, [[streamflow]] in the Ganges is highly seasonal. The average dry season to monsoon discharge ratio is about 1:6, as measured at [[Hardinge Bridge]]. This strong seasonal variation underlies many problems of land and water resource development in the region.{{sfn|Mirza|2004}} The seasonality of flow is so acute it can cause both drought and [[flood]]s. Bangladesh, in particular, frequently experiences drought during the dry season and regularly suffers extreme floods during the monsoon.{{sfn|Salman|Uprety|2002|p=133}}\n\nIn the Ganges Delta many large rivers come together, both merging and [[River bifurcation|bifurcating]] in a complicated network of [[Channel (geography)|channels]]. The two largest rivers, the Ganges and [[Brahmaputra]], both split into distributary channels, the largest of which merge with other large rivers before themselves joining. This current channel pattern was not always the case. Over time the rivers in Ganges Delta have [[Avulsion (river)|changed course]], sometimes altering the network of channels in significant ways.\n\nBefore the late 12th century the Bhagirathi-Hooghly distributary was the main channel of the Ganges and the Padma was only a minor spill-channel. The main flow of the river reached the sea not via the modern Hooghly River but rather by the [[Adi Ganga]]. Between the 12th and 16th centuries the Bhagirathi-Hooghly and Padma channels were more or less equally significant. After the 16th century the Padma grew to become the main channel of the Ganges.{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2001| pp=126\u201327}} It is thought that the Bhagirathi-Hooghly became increasingly choked with silt, causing the main flow of the Ganges to shift to the southeast and the Padma River. By the end of the 18th century the Padma had become the main distributary of the Ganges.{{sfn|Parua|2009}} One result of this shift to the Padma was that the Ganges joined the Meghna and Brahmaputra rivers before emptying into the Bay of Bengal, together instead of separately. The present confluence of the Ganges and Meghna formed about 150 years ago.<ref name=\"Catling1992\">{{cite book|last=Catling|first=David|title=Rice in deep water|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N5JxwKx1RAgC&pg=PA175|accessdate=23 April 2011|year=1992|publisher=[[International Rice Research Institute]]|isbn=978-9712200052|page=175}}</ref>\n\nAlso near the end of the 18th century, the course of the lower Brahmaputra changed dramatically, altering its relationship with the Ganges. In 1787 there was a great flood on the [[Teesta River]], which at the time was a tributary of the Ganges-Padma River. The flood of 1787 caused the Teesta to undergo a sudden change course (an [[Avulsion (river)|avulsion]]), shifting east to join the Brahmaputra and causing the Brahmaputra to shift its course south, cutting a new channel. This new main channel of the Brahmaputra is called the Jamuna River. It flows south to join the Ganges-Padma. Since ancient times the main flow of the Brahmaputra was more easterly, passing by the city of [[Mymensingh]] and joining the Meghna River. Today this channel is a small distributary but retains the name Brahmaputra, sometimes Old Brahmaputra.<ref name=\"Britannica-Brahmaputra\">{{cite encyclopedia |year= 2011 |title= Brahmaputra River |encyclopedia= [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |edition= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online Library |url= http://www.library.eb.com/eb/article-48056 |accessdate=25 April 2011}}</ref> The site of the old Brahmaputra-Meghna confluence, in the locality of [[Langalbandh]], is still considered sacred by Hindus.

The original purpose of the barrage, which was completed in 1975, was to divert up to {{convert|1100|m3/s|abbr=on}} of water from the Ganges to the Bhagirathi-Hooghly distributary in order to restore navigability at the [[Port of Kolkata]]. It was assumed that during the worst dry season the Ganges flow would be around {{convert|1400|to|1600|m3/s|abbr=on}}, thus leaving {{convert|280|to|420|m3/s|abbr=on}} for the then East Pakistan.{{sfn|Salman|Uprety|2002|pp=136\u201337}} East Pakistan objected and a protracted dispute ensued. In 1996 a 30-year treaty was signed with Bangladesh. The terms of the agreement are complicated, but in essence they state that if the Ganges flow at Farakka was less than {{convert|2000|m3/s|abbr=on}} then India and Bangladesh would each receive 50% of the water, with each receiving at least {{convert|1000|m3/s|abbr=on}} for alternating ten-day periods. However, within a year the flow at Farakka fell to levels far below the historic average, making it impossible to implement the guaranteed sharing of water. In March 1997, flow of the Ganges in Bangladesh dropped to its lowest ever, {{convert|180|m3/s|abbr=on}}. Dry season flows returned to normal levels in the years following, but efforts were made to address the problem. One plan is for another barrage to be built in Bangladesh at [[Pangsha Upazila|Pangsha]], west of [[Dhaka]].

She is then led by the waiting Bhagiratha down into the plains at Haridwar, across the plains first to the confluence with the [[Yamuna River|Yamuna]] at Prayag and then to Varanasi, and eventually to [[Ganges Delta|Ganges Sagar]], where she meets the ocean, sinks to the netherworld, and saves the sons of Sagara.<ref name=eck1998-p145/> In honour of Bhagirath's pivotal role in the ''avatarana'', the source stream of the Ganges in the Himalayas is named [[Bhagirathi River|Bhagirathi]], (Sanskrit, \"of Bhagiratha\").<ref name=eck1998-p145/>\n\n===Redemption of the Dead===\n[[Image:HinduCremationVaranasi1903.jpg|thumb|Preparations for cremations on the banks of the Ganges in [[Varanasi]], 1903.

His soul arrives before [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]], the Lord of Death, to be judged for the hereafter. Having no compensating virtue, Vahika's soul is at once dispatched to [[Naraka (Hinduism)|hell]]. While this is happening, his body on earth, however, is being picked at by vultures, one of whom flies away with a foot bone. Another bird comes after the vulture, and in fighting him off, the vulture accidentally drops the bone into the Ganges below.

An ancient symbol in India, it pre-dates all appearances of the goddess Ganga in art.<ref name=darian2001-p114/> The ''makara'' has a dual symbolism.

Here, in the [[Udaygiri Caves#Caves, sculptures and inscriptions|Cave V]], flanking the main figure of Vishnu shown in his boar incarnation, two river goddesses, Ganga and [[Yamuna river|Yamuna]] appear atop their respective mounts, ''makara'' and ''[[kurma]]'' (a turtle or tortoise).<ref name=darian2001-p114/>\n\nThe ''makara'' is often accompanied by a ''[[gana]]'', a small boy or child, near its mouth, as, for example, shown in the Gupta period relief from [[Vidisha#Historic Places and Monuments|Besnagar]], Central India, in the left-most frame above.<ref name=darian-2001-p118>{{Harvnb|Darian|2001|p=118}}</ref> The ''gana'' represents both posterity and development (''udbhava'').<ref name=darian-2001-p118/> The pairing of the fearsome, life-destroying ''makara'' with the youthful, life-affirming ''gana'' speaks to two aspects of the Ganges herself. Although she has provided sustenance to millions, she has also brought hardship, injury, and death by causing major floods along her banks.<ref>{{Harvnb|Darian|2001|pp=119\u201320}}</ref> The goddess Ganga is also accompanied by a dwarf attendant, who carries a cosmetic bag, and on whom she sometimes leans, as if for support.<ref name=pal-1997-p43/> (See, for example, frames 1, 2, and 4 above.)\n\nThe ''purna kumbha'' or full pot of water is the second most discernible element of the Ganga iconography.<ref name=darian-2001-p125>{{Harvnb|Darian|2001|p=125}}</ref> Appearing first also in the relief in the Udayagiri Caves (5th century), it gradually appeared more frequently as the theme of the goddess matured.<ref name=darian-2001-p125/> By the seventh century it had become an established feature, as seen, for example, in the [[Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh#Dashavatara temple|Dashavatara temple]], [[Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh]] (seventh century), the [[Badoli Temples|Trimurti temple]], Badoli, [[Chittor Fort|Chittorgarh]], Rajasthan, and at the [[Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh#Tourist attractions|Lakshmaneshwar temple]], [[Kharod]], [[Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh]],<ref name=darian-2001-p125/> (ninth or tenth century), and seen very clearly in frame 3 above and less clearly in the remaining frames.

However, after the [[Agra famine of 1837\u201338]], during which the [[East India Company]]'s administration spent [[Rs.]] 2,300,000 on famine relief, the idea of a canal became more attractive to the Company's budget-conscious Court of Directors. In 1839, the [[Governor General of India]], [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|Lord Auckland]], with the Court's assent, granted funds to Cautley for a full survey of the swath of land that underlay and fringed the projected course of the canal.

Auckland's successor as Governor General, [[Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough|Lord Ellenborough]], appeared less receptive to large-scale public works, and for the duration of his tenure, withheld major funds for the project. Only in 1844, when a new Governor-General, [[Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge|Lord Hardinge]], was appointed, did official enthusiasm and funds return to the Ganges canal project. Although the intervening impasse had seemingly affected Cautley's health and required him to return to Britain in 1845 for recuperation, his European sojourn gave him an opportunity to study contemporary hydraulic works in the United Kingdom and Italy. By the time of his return to India even more supportive men were at the helm, both in the [[North-Western Provinces]], with [[James Thomason (British colonial governor)|James Thomason]] as Lt. Governor, and in [[British India]] with [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] as Governor-General.

The objective of this centrally funded scheme was to treat the effluent from all the major towns along the Ganges and reduce pollution in the river by at least 75%. The Ganga Action Plan built upon the existing, but weakly enforced, 1974 Water Prevention and Control Act. A government audit of the Ganga Action Plan in 2000 reported limited success in meeting effluent targets. Development plans for sewage treatment facilities were submitted by only 73% of the cities along the Ganges, and only 54% of these were judged acceptable by the authorities. Not all the cities reported how much effluent was being treated, and many continued to discharge raw sewage into the river. Test audits of installed capacity indicated poor performance, and there were long delays in constructing planned treatment facilities. After 15 yr. of implementation, the audit estimated that the Ganga Action Plan had achieved only 14% of the anticipated sewage treatment capacity. The environmental impact of this failure has been exacerbated by the removal of large quantities of irrigation water from the Ganges which offset any gains from effluent reductions.\"\n----}} a \"major failure\".{{efn|name=haberman|1= {{harvtxt|Haberman|2006}}<br />\"The Ganga Action Plan, commonly known as GAP, was launched dramatically in the holy city of Banares (Varanasi) on 14 June 1985, by Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]], who promised, {{'}}We shall see that the waters of the Ganga become clean once again.{{'}} The stated task was {{'}}to improve water quality, permit safe bathing all along the 2,525 kilometers from the Ganges's origin in the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal, and make the water potable at important pilgrim and urban centres on its banks.{{'}} The project was designed to tackle pollution from twenty-five cities and towns along its banks in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal by intercepting, diverting, and treating their effluents. With the GAP's Phase II, three important tributaries\u2014Damodar, Gomati, and Yamuna\u2014were added to the plan. Although some improvements have been made to the quality of the Ganges's water, many people claim that the GAP has been a major failure. The environmental lawyer M. C. Mehta, for example, filed public interest litigation against project, claiming {{'}}GAP has collapsed.{{'}}\"\n----}}{{efn|name=gardner|1={{harvtxt|Gardner|2003}}<br />\"The Ganges, also known as the Ganga, is one of the world's major rivers, running for more than 2,500 kilometres from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal. It is also one of the most polluted, primarily from sewage, but also from animal carcasses, human corpses, and soap and other pollutants from bathers. Indeed, scientists measure fecal coliform levels at thousands of times what is permissible and levels of oxygen in the water are similarly unhealthy. Renewal efforts have centred primarily on the government-sponsored Ganga Action Plan (GAP), started in 1985 with the goal of cleaning up the river by 1993. Several western-style sewage treatment plants were built along the river, but they were poorly designed, poorly maintained and prone to shut down during the region's frequent power outages. The GAP has been a colossal failure, and many argue that the river is more polluted now than it was in 1985.\" (pa.166)\n----}}{{efn|name=bharati|1= {{harvtxt|Bharati|2006}}<br />\"The World Bank estimates the health costs of water pollution in India to be equivalent to three per cent of the country's gross domestic product. With Indian rivers being severely polluted, interlinking them may actually increase these costs. Also, with the widely recognised failure of the Ganga Action Plan, there is a danger that contaminants from the Gangetic basin might enter other basins and destroy their natural cleansing processes. The new areas that will be river-fed after the introduction of the scheme may experience crop failures or routing due to alien compounds carried into their streams from the polluted Gangetic basin streams.\" (p. 26)\n----}}\n\nAccording to one study,<ref name=mandal>{{Citation|last=Mandal|first=R.

The expenditure was almost doubled. But the result was not very appreciable. Much expenditure was done over the political propaganda. The concerning governments and the related agencies were not very prompt to make it a success. The public of the areas was not taken into consideration. The releasing of urban and industrial wastes in the river was not controlled fully. The flowing of dirty water through drains and sewers were not adequately diverted. The continuing customs of burning dead bodies, throwing carcasses, washing of dirty clothes by washermen, and immersion of idols and cattle wallowing were not checked. Very little provision of public latrines was made and the open defecation of lakhs of people continued along the riverside. All these made the Action Plan a failure.</blockquote>\n\nThe failure of the Ganga Action Plan, has also been variously attributed to \"environmental planning without proper understanding of the human\u2013environment interactions,\"{{efn|name=singh|1= {{harvtxt| Singh|Singh|2007}}<br />\"In February 1985, the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India launched the Ganga Action Plan, an environmental project to improve the river water quality. It was the largest single attempt to clean up a polluted river anywhere in the world and has not achieved any success in terms of preventing pollution load and improvement in water quality of the river. Failure of the Ganga Action Plan may be directly linked with the environmental planning without proper understanding of the human\u2013environment interactions.

The failure of the Ganga Action Plan to clean the sacred river is partly associated to our traditions and beliefs. The disposal of dead bodies, the immersion of idols and public bathing are the part of Hindu customs and rituals which are based on the notion that the sacred river leads to the path of salvation and under no circumstances its water can become impure. Burning of dead bodies through wood, bursting of crackers during Diwali, putting thousands of tonnes of fuel wood under fire during Holi, immersion of Durga and Ganesh idols into rivers and seas etc. are part of Hindu customs and are detrimental to the environment.

Thus, actions and states of existence can also be expressed by verbs, qualities by adjectives, and places by adverbs.

The [[syntactic]] rules for nouns differ from language to language. In [[English language|English]], nouns are those words which can occur with [[article (grammar)|articles]] and [[adjective|attributive adjectives]] and can function as the [[head (linguistics)|head]] of a [[noun phrase]]. \"As far as we know, every language makes a grammatical distinction that looks like a noun verb distinction.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Language Unlimited: The science behind our most creative power|author=David Adger |authorlink1=David Adger |location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=978-0-19-882809-9|page=78}}</ref>\n\n== History <span id=\"Substantive as a word for noun\"></span>==\n{{hatnote|See also [[Part of speech#History|History of parts of speech]]}}\n[[Word class]]es (parts of speech) were described by [[Sanskrit]] grammarians from at least the 5th century BC. In [[Y\u0101ska]]'s ''[[Nirukta]]'', the noun (''n\u0101ma'') is one of the four main categories of words defined.<ref name=Matilal>[[Bimal Krishna Matilal]], ''The word and the world: India's contribution to the study of language'', 1990 (Chapter 3)</ref>\n\nThe [[Ancient Greek]] equivalent was ''\u00f3noma'' (\u1f44\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1), referred to by [[Plato]] in the [[Cratylus (dialogue)|''Cratylus'' dialog]], and later listed as one of the eight parts of speech in ''[[The Art of Grammar]]'', attributed to [[Dionysius Thrax]] (2nd century BC). The term used in [[Latin grammar]] was ''n\u014dmen''. All of these terms for \"noun\" were also words meaning \"name\".<ref>{{L&S|nomen|n\u014dmen|ref}}; {{LSJ|o/noma|\u1f44\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1|ref}}</ref> The English word ''noun'' is derived from the Latin term, through the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] ''noun''.\n\nThe word classes were defined partly by the grammatical [[morphology (linguistics)|forms]] that they take. In Sanskrit, Greek and Latin, for example, nouns are categorized by [[grammatical gender|gender]] and inflected for [[grammatical case|case]] and [[grammatical number|number]]. Because [[adjective]]s share these three [[grammatical category|grammatical categories]], adjectives are placed in the same class as nouns.\n\nSimilarly, the Latin ''n\u014dmen'' includes both nouns (substantives) and adjectives, as originally did the English word ''noun'', the two types being distinguished as ''nouns substantive'' and ''nouns adjective'' (or ''substantive nouns'' and ''adjective nouns'', or short ''substantives'' and ''adjectives'').

Some of these are referenced in the {{slink||Further reading}} section below.\n\n== Gender ==\n{{main|Grammatical gender}}\n\nIn some languages, genders are assigned to nouns, such as masculine, feminine and neuter. The gender of a noun (as well as its number and case, where applicable) will often entail [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] in words that modify or are related to it. For example, in [[French language|French]], the singular form of the definite article is ''le'' with masculine nouns and ''la'' with feminines; adjectives and certain verb forms also change (with the addition of {{nowrap|''-e''}} with feminines). Grammatical gender often correlates with the form of the noun and the inflection pattern it follows; for example, in both [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] most nouns ending {{nowrap|''-a''}} are feminine. Gender can also correlate with the [[sex]] of the noun's referent, particularly in the case of nouns denoting people (and sometimes animals). Nouns arguably do not have gender in Modern English, although many of them denote people or animals of a specific sex (or ''social gender''), and pronouns that refer to nouns must take the appropriate gender for that noun. (The '''girl''' lost '''her''' spectacles.)\n\n== Classification ==\n\n=== Proper nouns and common nouns ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Czech language]] -->\n\n{{main|Proper noun}}\n\nA ''proper noun'' or ''proper name'' is a noun representing unique entities (such as ''[[India]]'', ''[[Pegasus]]'', ''[[Jupiter]]'', ''[[Confucius]]'', or ''[[Pequod (Moby-Dick)|Pequod]]''), as distinguished from ''common nouns'', which describe a class of entities (such as ''country'', ''animal'', ''planet'', ''person'' or ''ship'').<ref>{{harvnb|Lester|Beason|2005| page = 4}}</ref>\n''\n\n=== Countable and uncountable nouns ===\n{{Main|Count noun|Mass noun}}\n\n''Count nouns'' or ''countable nouns'' are common nouns that can take a [[plural]], can combine with [[numeral system|numerals]] or counting [[Quantifiers (linguistics)|quantifiers]] (e.g., ''one'', ''two'', ''several'', ''every'', ''most''), and can take an indefinite article such as ''a'' or ''an'' (in languages which have such articles). Examples of count nouns are ''chair'', ''nose'', and ''occasion''.\n\n''Mass nouns'' or ''uncountable'' (or ''non-count'') ''nouns'' differ from count nouns in precisely that respect: they cannot take plurals or combine with number words or the above type of quantifiers.  For example, it is not possible to refer to ''a furniture'' or ''three furnitures''. This is true even though the pieces of furniture comprising ''furniture'' could be counted. Thus the distinction between mass and count nouns should not be made in terms of what sorts of things the nouns refer to, but rather in terms of how the nouns ''present'' these entities.<ref>[[Manfred Krifka|Krifka, Manfred]]. 1989. \"Nominal Reference, Temporal Constitution and Quantification in Event Semantics\". In R. Bartsch, J. van Benthem, P. von Emde Boas (eds.), Semantics and Contextual Expression, Dordrecht: Foris Publication.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Borer|2005}}</ref>\n\nMany nouns have both countable and uncountable uses; for example, ''soda'' is countable in \"give me three sodas\", but uncountable in \"he likes soda\".\n\n=== Collective nouns ===\n{{Main|Collective noun}}\n\n''Collective nouns'' are nouns that \u2013 even when they are inflected for the [[Grammatical number|singular]] \u2013 refer to ''groups'' consisting of more than one individual or entity. Examples include ''committee'', ''government'', and ''police''. In English these nouns may be followed by a singular or a plural verb and referred to by a singular or plural pronoun,  the singular being generally preferred when referring to the body as a unit and the plural often being preferred, especially in British English, when emphasizing the individual members.<ref name=\"Gowers 2014\">{{harvnb|Gowers|2014|pages=189\u2013190}}</ref> Examples of acceptable and unacceptable use given by Gowers in ''Plain Words'' include:<ref name=\"Gowers 2014\"/>\n{{block indent|\"A committee ''was'' appointed to consider this subject.\" (singular)}}\n{{block indent|\"The committee ''were'' unable to agree.\" (plural)}}\n{{block indent|* \"The committee were of one mind when I sat on them.\" (unacceptable use of plural)}}\n\n=== Concrete nouns and abstract nouns ===\n{{Further|Physical body|Abstract object}}\n\n''Concrete nouns'' refer to [[physical bodies|physical entities]] that can, in principle at least ''(i.e. different schools of philosophy and sciences may question the assumption, but, for the most part, people agree to the existence of something. E.g. a rock, a tree,  universe)'', be observed by at least one of the [[sense]]s (for instance, ''chair'', ''apple'', ''Janet'' or ''atom''). ''Abstract nouns'', on the other hand, refer to [[abstract object]]s; that is, ideas or concepts (such as ''justice'' or ''hatred''). While this distinction is sometimes exclusive, some nouns have multiple senses, including both concrete and abstract ones: consider, for example, the noun ''art'', which usually refers to a concept (e.g., ''Art is an important element of human culture.'') but which can refer to a specific artwork in certain contexts (e.g., ''I put my daughter's art up on the fridge.'')\n\nSome abstract nouns developed etymologically by figurative extension from literal roots. These include ''drawback'', ''fraction'', ''holdout'' and ''uptake''. Similarly, some nouns have both abstract and concrete senses, with the latter having developed by figurative extension from the former. These include ''view'', ''filter'', ''structure'' and ''key''.\n\nIn English, many abstract nouns are formed by adding a suffix (''-ness'', ''-ity'', ''-ion'') to adjectives or verbs. Examples are ''happiness'' (from the adjective ''happy''), ''circulation'' (from the verb ''circulate'') and ''serenity'' (from the adjective ''serene'').\n\n=== Alienable vs. inalienable nouns ===\nSome languages, such as the [[Awa language (Papua New Guinea)|Awa language]] spoken in [[Papua New Guinea]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://glossary.sil.org/term/inalienable-noun |title=Inalienable Noun |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=[[SIL International]] |access-date= 6 February 2020}}</ref> refer to nouns differently, depending on how ownership is being given for the given noun. This can be broken into two categories: alienable and [[Inalienable possession|inalienable]]. An alienable noun is something that does not belong to a person indefinitely. Inalienable nouns, on the other hand, refer to something that is possessed definitely. Examples of alienable nouns would be a tree or a shirt or roads. Examples of inalienable nouns would be a father or shadow or hair.\n\n==== Pingelapese ====\nThe [[Pingelapese language]] uses a distinction between nouns.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Papers in Kosraean and Ponapeic|last=M.|first=Good, Elaine|date=1989-01-01|publisher=Dept. of Linguistics, Research School of Pacific Studies, Australian National University|isbn=0-8588-3390-5|oclc=22068434}}</ref> There are several classifier forms: The first is for objects which tend to be pretty large in size and not being a favourite possession (tree or shirt), and the second is for small, controllable, favourite objects like dogs, books or spears. A third form would be set aside for food objects like bananas, oranges or fish. Drinks like water or coconut liquor also have classifier forms. A fifth classifier would be designated for things that are to be chewed but not fully consumed. The only example of this was from the book ''Papers in Kosraean and Ponapeic'': the fruit, pandanus, is chewed for the sweet/bitter juice, but what remains after consuming the juice discarded. The 6th classifier forms are set aside for ways of transportation (bikes, canoes, and boats). The last two classifiers are designated for land and houses.\n\n== Noun phrases ==\n{{main|Noun phrase}}\n\nA noun phrase is a phrase based on a noun, pronoun, or other noun-like words (nominal) optionally accompanied by modifiers such as [[determiner]]s and [[adjective]]s. A noun phrase functions within a clause or sentence in a role such as that of [[subject (grammar)|subject]], [[object (grammar)|object]], or [[complement (grammar)|complement]] of a verb or preposition. For example, in the sentence \"The black cat sat on a dear friend of mine\", the noun phrase ''the black cat'' serves as the subject, and the noun phrase ''a dear friend of mine'' serves as the complement of the preposition ''on''.\n\n== Pronouns ==\n{{main|Pronoun}}\n\nNouns and noun phrases can typically be replaced by [[pronoun]]s, such as ''he'', ''it'', ''which'', and ''those'', in order to avoid repetition or explicit identification, or for other reasons. For example, in the sentence ''Gareth thought that he was weird'', the word ''he'' is a pronoun standing in place of the person's name. The word ''one'' can replace parts of noun phrases, and it sometimes stands in for a noun.  An example is given below:\n\n{{block indent|John's car is newer than ''the one'' that Bill has.}}\n\nBut ''one'' can also stand in for larger parts of a noun phrase. For example, in the following example, ''one'' can stand in for ''new car''.\n\n{{block indent|This new car is cheaper than ''that one''.}}\n\n== Nominalization ==\n{{main|Nominalization}}\nNominalization is a process whereby a word that belongs to another part of speech comes to be used as a noun.\nIn French and Spanish, for example, adjectives frequently act as nouns referring to people who have the characteristics denoted by the adjective. This sometimes happens in English as well, as in the following examples:\n\n{{block indent|This legislation will have the most impact on the ''poor''.}}\n{{block indent|The race is not to the ''swift'', nor the battle to the ''powerful''.}}\n{{block indent|The Socialist ''International'' is a worldwide association of political parties.}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Description]]\n* [[Grammatical case]]\n* [[Phi features]]\n* [[Punctuation]]\n* [[Reference]]\n* [[Verb]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book | title = The McGraw-Hill Handbook of English Grammar and Usage |last1=Lester|first1=Mark|last2=Beason |first2=Larry | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-07-144133-6|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Borer|first=Hagit|year=2005|title=In Name Only.

Thus, actions and states of existence can also be expressed by verbs, qualities by adjectives, and places by adverbs. [[Linguistics|Linguistically]], a noun is a member of a large, [[open class (linguistics)|open]] [[part of speech]] whose members can occur as the main word in the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of a [[clause]], the [[object (grammar)|object]] of a [[verb]], or the object of a [[preposition]].<ref>Loos, Eugene E., et al. 2003.

The [[syntactic]] rules for nouns differ from language to language. In [[English language|English]], nouns are those words which can occur with [[article (grammar)|articles]] and [[adjective|attributive adjectives]] and can function as the [[head (linguistics)|head]] of a [[noun phrase]]. \"As far as we know, every language makes a grammatical distinction that looks like a noun verb distinction.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Language Unlimited: The science behind our most creative power|author=David Adger |authorlink1=David Adger |location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=978-0-19-882809-9|page=78}}</ref>\n\n== History <span id=\"Substantive as a word for noun\"></span>==\n{{hatnote|See also [[Part of speech#History|History of parts of speech]]}}\n[[Word class]]es (parts of speech) were described by [[Sanskrit]] grammarians from at least the 5th century BC.

The term used in [[Latin grammar]] was ''n\u014dmen''. All of these terms for \"noun\" were also words meaning \"name\".<ref>{{L&S|nomen|n\u014dmen|ref}}; {{LSJ|o/noma|\u1f44\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1|ref}}</ref> The English word ''noun'' is derived from the Latin term, through the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] ''noun''.\n\nThe word classes were defined partly by the grammatical [[morphology (linguistics)|forms]] that they take. In Sanskrit, Greek and Latin, for example, nouns are categorized by [[grammatical gender|gender]] and inflected for [[grammatical case|case]] and [[grammatical number|number]]. Because [[adjective]]s share these three [[grammatical category|grammatical categories]], adjectives are placed in the same class as nouns.\n\nSimilarly, the Latin ''n\u014dmen'' includes both nouns (substantives) and adjectives, as originally did the English word ''noun'', the two types being distinguished as ''nouns substantive'' and ''nouns adjective'' (or ''substantive nouns'' and ''adjective nouns'', or short ''substantives'' and ''adjectives''). (The word ''[[nominal (linguistics)|nominal]]'' is now sometimes used to denote a class that includes both nouns and adjectives.)\n\nMany European languages use a [[cognate]] of the word ''substantive'' as the basic term for noun (for example, Spanish ''[[wikt:sustantivo|sustantivo]]'', \"noun\").

Nouns arguably do not have gender in Modern English, although many of them denote people or animals of a specific sex (or ''social gender''), and pronouns that refer to nouns must take the appropriate gender for that noun. (The '''girl''' lost '''her''' spectacles.)\n\n== Classification ==\n\n=== Proper nouns and common nouns ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Czech language]] -->\n\n{{main|Proper noun}}\n\nA ''proper noun'' or ''proper name'' is a noun representing unique entities (such as ''[[India]]'', ''[[Pegasus]]'', ''[[Jupiter]]'', ''[[Confucius]]'', or ''[[Pequod (Moby-Dick)|Pequod]]''), as distinguished from ''common nouns'', which describe a class of entities (such as ''country'', ''animal'', ''planet'', ''person'' or ''ship'').<ref>{{harvnb|Lester|Beason|2005| page = 4}}</ref>\n''\n\n=== Countable and uncountable nouns ===\n{{Main|Count noun|Mass noun}}\n\n''Count nouns'' or ''countable nouns'' are common nouns that can take a [[plural]], can combine with [[numeral system|numerals]] or counting [[Quantifiers (linguistics)|quantifiers]] (e.g., ''one'', ''two'', ''several'', ''every'', ''most''), and can take an indefinite article such as ''a'' or ''an'' (in languages which have such articles). Examples of count nouns are ''chair'', ''nose'', and ''occasion''.\n\n''Mass nouns'' or ''uncountable'' (or ''non-count'') ''nouns'' differ from count nouns in precisely that respect: they cannot take plurals or combine with number words or the above type of quantifiers.  For example, it is not possible to refer to ''a furniture'' or ''three furnitures''. This is true even though the pieces of furniture comprising ''furniture'' could be counted. Thus the distinction between mass and count nouns should not be made in terms of what sorts of things the nouns refer to, but rather in terms of how the nouns ''present'' these entities.<ref>[[Manfred Krifka|Krifka, Manfred]]. 1989. \"Nominal Reference, Temporal Constitution and Quantification in Event Semantics\". In R. Bartsch, J. van Benthem, P. von Emde Boas (eds.), Semantics and Contextual Expression, Dordrecht: Foris Publication.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Borer|2005}}</ref>\n\nMany nouns have both countable and uncountable uses; for example, ''soda'' is countable in \"give me three sodas\", but uncountable in \"he likes soda\".\n\n=== Collective nouns ===\n{{Main|Collective noun}}\n\n''Collective nouns'' are nouns that \u2013 even when they are inflected for the [[Grammatical number|singular]] \u2013 refer to ''groups'' consisting of more than one individual or entity. Examples include ''committee'', ''government'', and ''police''. In English these nouns may be followed by a singular or a plural verb and referred to by a singular or plural pronoun,  the singular being generally preferred when referring to the body as a unit and the plural often being preferred, especially in British English, when emphasizing the individual members.<ref name=\"Gowers 2014\">{{harvnb|Gowers|2014|pages=189\u2013190}}</ref> Examples of acceptable and unacceptable use given by Gowers in ''Plain Words'' include:<ref name=\"Gowers 2014\"/>\n{{block indent|\"A committee ''was'' appointed to consider this subject.\" (singular)}}\n{{block indent|\"The committee ''were'' unable to agree.\" (plural)}}\n{{block indent|* \"The committee were of one mind when I sat on them.\" (unacceptable use of plural)}}\n\n=== Concrete nouns and abstract nouns ===\n{{Further|Physical body|Abstract object}}\n\n''Concrete nouns'' refer to [[physical bodies|physical entities]] that can, in principle at least ''(i.e. different schools of philosophy and sciences may question the assumption, but, for the most part, people agree to the existence of something. E.g. a rock, a tree,  universe)'', be observed by at least one of the [[sense]]s (for instance, ''chair'', ''apple'', ''Janet'' or ''atom''). ''Abstract nouns'', on the other hand, refer to [[abstract object]]s; that is, ideas or concepts (such as ''justice'' or ''hatred''). While this distinction is sometimes exclusive, some nouns have multiple senses, including both concrete and abstract ones: consider, for example, the noun ''art'', which usually refers to a concept (e.g., ''Art is an important element of human culture.'') but which can refer to a specific artwork in certain contexts (e.g., ''I put my daughter's art up on the fridge.'')\n\nSome abstract nouns developed etymologically by figurative extension from literal roots. These include ''drawback'', ''fraction'', ''holdout'' and ''uptake''. Similarly, some nouns have both abstract and concrete senses, with the latter having developed by figurative extension from the former. These include ''view'', ''filter'', ''structure'' and ''key''.\n\nIn English, many abstract nouns are formed by adding a suffix (''-ness'', ''-ity'', ''-ion'') to adjectives or verbs. Examples are ''happiness'' (from the adjective ''happy''), ''circulation'' (from the verb ''circulate'') and ''serenity'' (from the adjective ''serene'').\n\n=== Alienable vs. inalienable nouns ===\nSome languages, such as the [[Awa language (Papua New Guinea)|Awa language]] spoken in [[Papua New Guinea]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://glossary.sil.org/term/inalienable-noun |title=Inalienable Noun |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=[[SIL International]] |access-date= 6 February 2020}}</ref> refer to nouns differently, depending on how ownership is being given for the given noun. This can be broken into two categories: alienable and [[Inalienable possession|inalienable]]. An alienable noun is something that does not belong to a person indefinitely. Inalienable nouns, on the other hand, refer to something that is possessed definitely. Examples of alienable nouns would be a tree or a shirt or roads. Examples of inalienable nouns would be a father or shadow or hair.\n\n==== Pingelapese ====\nThe [[Pingelapese language]] uses a distinction between nouns.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Papers in Kosraean and Ponapeic|last=M.|first=Good, Elaine|date=1989-01-01|publisher=Dept. of Linguistics, Research School of Pacific Studies, Australian National University|isbn=0-8588-3390-5|oclc=22068434}}</ref> There are several classifier forms: The first is for objects which tend to be pretty large in size and not being a favourite possession (tree or shirt), and the second is for small, controllable, favourite objects like dogs, books or spears. A third form would be set aside for food objects like bananas, oranges or fish. Drinks like water or coconut liquor also have classifier forms. A fifth classifier would be designated for things that are to be chewed but not fully consumed. The only example of this was from the book ''Papers in Kosraean and Ponapeic'': the fruit, pandanus, is chewed for the sweet/bitter juice, but what remains after consuming the juice discarded. The 6th classifier forms are set aside for ways of transportation (bikes, canoes, and boats). The last two classifiers are designated for land and houses.\n\n== Noun phrases ==\n{{main|Noun phrase}}\n\nA noun phrase is a phrase based on a noun, pronoun, or other noun-like words (nominal) optionally accompanied by modifiers such as [[determiner]]s and [[adjective]]s. A noun phrase functions within a clause or sentence in a role such as that of [[subject (grammar)|subject]], [[object (grammar)|object]], or [[complement (grammar)|complement]] of a verb or preposition. For example, in the sentence \"The black cat sat on a dear friend of mine\", the noun phrase ''the black cat'' serves as the subject, and the noun phrase ''a dear friend of mine'' serves as the complement of the preposition ''on''.\n\n== Pronouns ==\n{{main|Pronoun}}\n\nNouns and noun phrases can typically be replaced by [[pronoun]]s, such as ''he'', ''it'', ''which'', and ''those'', in order to avoid repetition or explicit identification, or for other reasons. For example, in the sentence ''Gareth thought that he was weird'', the word ''he'' is a pronoun standing in place of the person's name. The word ''one'' can replace parts of noun phrases, and it sometimes stands in for a noun.  An example is given below:\n\n{{block indent|John's car is newer than ''the one'' that Bill has.}}\n\nBut ''one'' can also stand in for larger parts of a noun phrase. For example, in the following example, ''one'' can stand in for ''new car''.\n\n{{block indent|This new car is cheaper than ''that one''.}}\n\n== Nominalization ==\n{{main|Nominalization}}\nNominalization is a process whereby a word that belongs to another part of speech comes to be used as a noun.\nIn French and Spanish, for example, adjectives frequently act as nouns referring to people who have the characteristics denoted by the adjective. This sometimes happens in English as well, as in the following examples:\n\n{{block indent|This legislation will have the most impact on the ''poor''.}}\n{{block indent|The race is not to the ''swift'', nor the battle to the ''powerful''.}}\n{{block indent|The Socialist ''International'' is a worldwide association of political parties.}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Description]]\n* [[Grammatical case]]\n* [[Phi features]]\n* [[Punctuation]]\n* [[Reference]]\n* [[Verb]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book | title = The McGraw-Hill Handbook of English Grammar and Usage |last1=Lester|first1=Mark|last2=Beason |first2=Larry | publisher = McGraw-Hill | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-07-144133-6|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Borer|first=Hagit|year=2005|title=In Name Only.
