He had released four Korean albums, four Japanese albums, thirty Japanese singles and several Korean singles during his first six years in the music industry as TVXQ. In 2009, Kim and fellow TVXQ members [[Kim Jaejoong]] and [[Park Yoochun]] filed a lawsuit against SM Entertainment, arguing that their exclusive contracts were unilaterally disadvantageous towards the artists and should be invalidated. The Seoul Central District Court ruled in favor of the three and granted an injunction suspending their contracts.<ref name=\"lawsuit\"/> The trio reunited and subsequently formed [[JYJ]] (formerly known as JUNSU/JAEJOONG/YOOCHUN in Japan).<ref name=\"RZannouncement\"/> As JYJ, Kim has released one [[The Beginning (JYJ album)|English album]], two [[JYJ discography|Korean albums]], one [[The...|Japanese EP]], and one [[Their Rooms \"Our Story\"|Korean EP]].\n\nKim began his solo career in 2010 with the release of Japanese EP ''[[Xiah (EP)|Xiah]]'',<ref name=\"solo\"/> which peaked at number-two on Japan's [[Oricon Chart|Oricon]] singles chart. The same year, he took the role of Wolfgang in his debut musical ''[[Mozart!]]'',<ref name=\"Mozart\"/> receiving critical acclaim and commercial success. After the release of ''Xiah'', Kim's solo music career was sent into hiatus because of a discord between him and his Japanese label [[Avex Trax]] that led to the sudden suspension of all his activities in Japan. In May 2012, he released his first full-length Korean solo studio album ''[[Tarantallegra]]'', while being represented by new management agency [[C-JeS Entertainment]]. Following the release, he embarked on his first headlining world tour.<ref>{{Cite web|title=JYJ Kim Junsu rewrites K-pop history with his world tour|url=http://www.asiatoday.co.kr/news/view.asp?seq=671851|work=Asiatoday|date=July 21, 2012}}</ref> He returned with his second Korean solo studio album, ''[[Incredible (XIA album)|Incredible]]'', in July 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allkpop.com/article/2013/07/junsu-releases-his-2nd-solo-album-incredible|title=Junsu releases his 2nd solo album 'Incredible'!|date=July 14, 2013|publisher=Allkpop|accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDespite limitations in media coverage and promotional activities caused by a ban in the Entertainment Departments of South Korea's three main terrestrial broadcasters resulting from [[SM Entertainment]]'s interference,<ref>{{Cite web|title= SM Entertainment impeded JYJ's promo activities: Korea Fair Trade Commission\n|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/entertainment/sm-entertainment-impeded/755136.html|date= July 24, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2013/07/123_139853.html|title=JYJ wins battle with SM Entertainment|date=July 24, 2013|newspaper=The Korea Times|accessdate=July 24, 2013}}</ref> Kim's first and second studio album reached top two on the [[Gaon Chart|Gaon]] albums chart in South Korea, as well as reaching number-ten and number-five on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard]] World Albums chart for ''Tarantallegra'' and ''Incredible'', respectively.

He is a member of the Korean pop group [[JYJ]], and was one of the original members of [[boy band]] [[TVXQ]].\n\nKim made his debut in 2003 as a member of [[TVXQ]], a [[boy band]] produced and formed by South Korean record label and talent agency [[SM Entertainment]], having previously been a trainee for six years. He had released four Korean albums, four Japanese albums, thirty Japanese singles and several Korean singles during his first six years in the music industry as TVXQ. In 2009, Kim and fellow TVXQ members [[Kim Jaejoong]] and [[Park Yoochun]] filed a lawsuit against SM Entertainment, arguing that their exclusive contracts were unilaterally disadvantageous towards the artists and should be invalidated. The Seoul Central District Court ruled in favor of the three and granted an injunction suspending their contracts.<ref name=\"lawsuit\"/> The trio reunited and subsequently formed [[JYJ]] (formerly known as JUNSU/JAEJOONG/YOOCHUN in Japan).<ref name=\"RZannouncement\"/> As JYJ, Kim has released one [[The Beginning (JYJ album)|English album]], two [[JYJ discography|Korean albums]], one [[The...|Japanese EP]], and one [[Their Rooms \"Our Story\"|Korean EP]].\n\nKim began his solo career in 2010 with the release of Japanese EP ''[[Xiah (EP)|Xiah]]'',<ref name=\"solo\"/> which peaked at number-two on Japan's [[Oricon Chart|Oricon]] singles chart. The same year, he took the role of Wolfgang in his debut musical ''[[Mozart!]]'',<ref name=\"Mozart\"/> receiving critical acclaim and commercial success. After the release of ''Xiah'', Kim's solo music career was sent into hiatus because of a discord between him and his Japanese label [[Avex Trax]] that led to the sudden suspension of all his activities in Japan. In May 2012, he released his first full-length Korean solo studio album ''[[Tarantallegra]]'', while being represented by new management agency [[C-JeS Entertainment]]. Following the release, he embarked on his first headlining world tour.<ref>{{Cite web|title=JYJ Kim Junsu rewrites K-pop history with his world tour|url=http://www.asiatoday.co.kr/news/view.asp?seq=671851|work=Asiatoday|date=July 21, 2012}}</ref> He returned with his second Korean solo studio album, ''[[Incredible (XIA album)|Incredible]]'', in July 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allkpop.com/article/2013/07/junsu-releases-his-2nd-solo-album-incredible|title=Junsu releases his 2nd solo album 'Incredible'!|date=July 14, 2013|publisher=Allkpop|accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDespite limitations in media coverage and promotional activities caused by a ban in the Entertainment Departments of South Korea's three main terrestrial broadcasters resulting from [[SM Entertainment]]'s interference,<ref>{{Cite web|title= SM Entertainment impeded JYJ's promo activities: Korea Fair Trade Commission\n|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/entertainment/sm-entertainment-impeded/755136.html|date= July 24, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2013/07/123_139853.html|title=JYJ wins battle with SM Entertainment|date=July 24, 2013|newspaper=The Korea Times|accessdate=July 24, 2013}}</ref> Kim's first and second studio album reached top two on the [[Gaon Chart|Gaon]] albums chart in South Korea, as well as reaching number-ten and number-five on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard]] World Albums chart for ''Tarantallegra'' and ''Incredible'', respectively.

Believers claim the image depicts [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] and the fabric is the [[burial shroud]] in which he was wrapped after crucifixion. The existence of the shroud was first securely attested in 1390 when a local bishop wrote that an unnamed artist had confessed that it was a forgery. [[Radiocarbon dating]] of a sample of the fabric is consistent with this date of origin.\n\nThe artifact is kept in the [[Cathedral of Turin]], which is located next to a complex of buildings composed of the [[Royal Palace of Turin]], the [[Chapel of the Holy Shroud]] (located inside the Royal Palace and formerly connected to the Cathedral), and the [[Palazzo Chiablese]] in [[Turin]], [[Piedmont]], northern Italy.\n\nThe [[Catholic Church]] has neither formally endorsed nor rejected the shroud, but in 1958 [[Pope Pius XII]] approved of the image in association with the [[Roman Catholic devotions|devotion]] to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]].<ref>Joan Carroll Cruz, ''Saintly Men of Modern Times'', Our Sunday Visitor, 2003, {{ISBN|1-931709-77-7}}, p. 200.</ref> [[Pope John Paul II]] called the Shroud \"a mirror of the Gospel\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/pope-francis-and-shroud-turin |title=Pope Francis and the Shroud of Turin - National Catholic Reporter |accessdate=6 June 2016|date=April 2013 }}</ref><ref>Pastoral Visit of His Holiness John Paul II to Vercelli and Turin, Italy, 23\u201324 May 1998 [http://shroudnm.com/docs/JPII05-24-1998.pdf]</ref> Other [[Christian denominations]], such as Anglicans and Methodists, have also shown devotion to the Shroud of Turin.<ref name=\"Dreisbach2001\"/> Diverse arguments have been made in scientific and popular publications claiming to prove, contrary to the scientific consensus, that the cloth is the authentic burial shroud of Jesus, based on disciplines ranging from chemistry to biology and medical forensics to optical image analysis.

Prior to 1390 there are some similar images such as the [[Pray Codex]]. However, what is claimed by some to be the image of a shroud on the Pray Codex has crosses on one side, an interlocking step pyramid pattern on the other, and no image of Jesus. Critics point out that it may not be a shroud at all, but rather a rectangular tombstone, as seen on other sacred images.<ref>G.M.Rinaldi, \"Il Codice Pray\", http://sindone.weebly.com/pray.html</ref>  The text of the codex also fails to mention a miraculous image on the codex shroud.\n\nThe first possible historical record dates from 1353 or 1357.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" /><ref>{{Cite news |date=31 January 2005 |title=Turin shroud 'older than thought' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4210369.stm |work=BBC News}}</ref> and the first certain record (in [[Lirey]], [[France]]) in 1390 when Bishop Pierre d'Arcis wrote a [[memorandum]] to [[Antipope Clement VII|Pope Clement VII]] (Avignon Obedience), stating that the shroud was a forgery and that the artist had confessed.<ref name=\"Poulle 2009\">{{cite journal |last1=Poulle |first1=Emmanuel |authorlink=Emmanuel Poulle |title=Les sources de l'histoire du linceul de Turin.

Some contend that the Lirey shroud was the work of a confessed forger and murderer.<ref>Watson E.

In 1453 Margaret de Charny deeded the Shroud to the [[House of Savoy]]. In 1578 the shroud was transferred to Turin. Since the 17th century the shroud has been displayed (e.g. in the chapel built for that purpose by [[Guarino Guarini]]<ref>John Beldon Scott, ''Architecture for the shroud: relic and ritual in Turin'', University of Chicago Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-226-74316-0}}, p. xxi</ref>) and in the 19th century it was first photographed during a public exhibition.\n\nIn 1532, the shroud suffered damage from a fire in a chapel of [[Chamb\u00e9ry]], capital of the [[Savoy]] region, where it was stored. A drop of molten silver from the reliquary produced a symmetrically placed mark through the layers of the folded cloth. [[Poor Clare Nuns]] attempted to repair this damage with patches. In 1578 [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy]] ordered the cloth to be brought from Chamb\u00e9ry to Turin and it has remained at Turin ever since.<ref>See House of Savoy historian Filiberto Pingone in Filiberto Pingone, ''La Sindone dei Vangeli (Sindon Evangelica).

The authorization was granted and the first medal with the image was offered to [[Pope Pius XII]] who approved the medal. The image was then used on what became known as the [[Holy Face Medal]] worn by many Catholics, initially as a means of protection during World War II. In 1958 Pope Pius XII approved of the image in association with the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus, and declared its [[Feast of the Holy Winding Sheet of Christ|feast]] to be celebrated every year the day before [[Ash Wednesday]].<ref>Maria Rigamonti, ''Mother Maria Pierina'', Cenacle Publishing, 1999</ref><ref>Joan Carroll Cruz, \"Saintly Men of Modern Times\", ''Our Sunday Visitor'', 2003, {{ISBN|1-931709-77-7}}</ref> Following the approval by Pope Pius XII, Catholic devotions to the Holy Face of Jesus have been almost exclusively associated with the image on the shroud.\n\nIn 1983 the Shroud was given to the Holy See by the [[House of Savoy]].<ref name=\"Michael Freze 1993, p. 57\">Michael Freze, 1993, ''Voices, Visions, and Apparitions'', OSV Publishing, {{ISBN|0-87973-454-X}}, p. 57</ref> However, as with all relics of this kind, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] made no pronouncements on its authenticity.

In 1902 [[Yves Delage]], a French professor of [[comparative anatomy]], published the first study on the subject.<ref name=\"Delage, Yves 1902\" /> Delage declared the image anatomically flawless and argued that the features of [[rigor mortis]], wounds, and blood flows were evidence that the image was formed by direct or indirect contact with a corpse. William Meacham mentions several other medical studies between 1936 and 1981 that agree with Delage.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" /> These were all indirect studies without access to the shroud itself.\n\nThe first direct examination of the shroud by a scientific team was undertaken in 1969\u20131973 in order to advise on preservation of the shroud and determine specific testing methods. This led to the appointment of an 11-member Turin Commission to advise on the preservation of the relic and on specific testing. Five of the commission members were scientists, and preliminary studies of samples of the fabric were conducted in 1973.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" />\n\nIn 1976 physicist John P. Jackson, thermodynamicist Eric Jumper and photographer William Mottern used [[image analysis]] technologies developed in aerospace science for analyzing the images of the Shroud. In 1977 these three scientists and over thirty others formed the [[Shroud of Turin Research Project]]. In 1978 this group, often called STURP, was given direct access to the Shroud.\n\nAlso in 1978, independently from the STURP research, Giovanni Tamburelli obtained at [[CSELT]] a 3D-elaboration from the Shroud with higher resolution than Jumper and Mottern.

They examined the human and non-human DNA found when the shroud and its backing cloth were vacuumed in 1977 and 1988. They found traces of 19 different plant [[Taxon|taxa]], including plants native to Mediterranean countries, Central Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Asia (China) and the Americas. Of the human [[mtDNA]], sequences were found belonging to [[haplogroup]]s that are typical of various ethnicities and geographic regions, including Europe, North and East Africa, the Middle East and India. A few non-plant and non-human sequences were also detected, including various birds and one ascribable to a marine worm common in the Northern Pacific Ocean, next to Canada.<ref name = \"Barcaccia 2015\"/> After sequencing some DNA of pollen and dust found on the shroud, they confirmed that many people from many different places came in contact with the shroud.

In fact, Jesus' hands and face are depicted with great detail, while his buttocks and his navel are faintly outlined or invisible, a discrepancy explained with the artist's consideration of modesty. Also, Jesus' right arm and hand are abnormally elongated, allowing him to modestly cover his genital area, which is physically impossible for an ordinary dead body lying supine. However, medical studies of the image speculate that the man's right [[humerus]] may have been dislocated, which could potentially account for the right arm lowering.<ref>[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307773215_Medical_News_From_Scientific_Analysis_of_the_Turin_Shroud Medical News From Scientific Analysis of the Turin Shroud]</ref> No wrinkles or other irregularities distort the image, which is improbable if the cloth had covered the irregular form of a body.

They first did a carbon-dust drawing of a Jesus-like face (using collagen dust) on a newsprint made from wood pulp (which is similar to 13th- and 14th-century paper). They next placed the drawing on a table and covered it with a piece of linen. They then pressed the linen against the newsprint by firmly rubbing with the flat side of a wooden spoon. By doing this they managed to create a reddish-brown image with a lifelike positive likeness of a person, a three-dimensional image and no sign of brush strokes.<ref>Craig, Emily A, Bresee, Randal R, \"Image Formation and the Shroud of Turin\", ''Journal of Imaging Science and Technology'', Volume 34, Number 1, 1994</ref> However, according to Fanti and Moroni, this does not reproduce many special features of the Shroud at microscopic level.<ref name=Fanti2002/>\n\n====Bas-relief====\nIn 1978, [[Joe Nickell]] noted that the Shroud image had a three-dimensional quality and thought its creation may have involved a sculpture of some type. He advanced the hypothesis that a medieval rubbing technique was used to explain the image, and set out to demonstrate this. He noted that while wrapping a cloth around a sculpture with normal contours would result in a distorted image, Nickell believed that wrapping a cloth over a [[bas-relief]] might result in an image like the one seen on the shroud, as it would eliminate wraparound distortions. For his demonstration, Nickell wrapped a wet cloth around a bas-relief sculpture and allowed it to dry. He then applied powdered pigment rather than wet paint (to prevent it soaking into the threads). The pigment was applied with a dauber, similar to making a rubbing from a gravestone. The result was an image with dark regions and light regions convincingly arranged. In a photo essay in ''[[Popular Photography]]'' magazine, Nickell demonstrated this technique step-by-step.<ref name = JNInquest/><ref name =PopPhoto>{{cite journal |last1=Nickell |first1=Joe |title=The Turin Shroud: Fake? Fact? Photograph? |journal=Popular Photography |volume=November 1979 |page=97-147}}</ref>{{efn|For his pigment, Nickell first used the burial spices myrrh and aloes, but changed to red iron oxide (the pigment [[Ochre|red ocher]]) when microanalyst, [[Walter McCrone]] identified it as constituting the shroud\u2019s image. (McCrone had identified the blood as red ochre and [[vermilion]] tempers paint.)<ref name = JNInquest/>}} Other researchers later replicated this process. \n\nIn 2005, researcher Jacques di Costanzo constructed a bas-relief of a Jesus-like face and draped wet linen over it. After the linen dried, he dabbed it with a mixture of [[ferric oxide]] and [[gelatine]]. The result was an image similar to that of the face on the Shroud. The imprinted image turned out to be wash-resistant, impervious to temperatures of {{convert |250 |C |abbr=on}} and was undamaged by exposure to a range of harsh chemicals, including bisulphite which, without the gelatine, would normally have degraded ferric oxide to the compound ferrous oxide.<ref name=\"'Ingham\">{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Ingham |title=Turin Shroud Confirmed as Fake |date=21 June 2005 |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |url=http://www.physorg.com/news4652.html |work=Physorg.com |pages=|access-date=17 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nInstead of painting, it has been suggested that the bas-relief could also be heated and used to scorch an image onto the cloth. However researcher Thibault Heimburger performed some experiments with the scorching of linen, and found that a scorch mark is only produced by direct contact with the hot object\u2014thus producing an all-or-nothing discoloration with no graduation of color as is found in the shroud.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/scorch-paper-en.pdf |title=The Turin Shroud Body Image: The Scorch Hypothesis Revisited |author=Thibault Heimburger |accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Fanti and Moroni, after comparing the [[Color histogram|histogram]]s of 256 different grey levels, it was found that the image obtained with a bas-relief has grey values included between 60 and 256 levels, but it is much contrasted with wide areas of white saturation (levels included between 245 and 256) and lacks of intermediate grey levels (levels included between 160 and 200). The face image on the Shroud instead has grey tonalities that vary in the same values field (between 60 and 256), but the white saturation is much less marked and the histogram is practically flat in correspondence of the intermediate grey levels (levels included between 160 and 200).<ref name=Fanti2002>{{cite journal |last1=Fanti |first1=G. |last2=Moroni |first2=M. |title=Comparison of Luminance Between Face of Turin Shroud Man and Experimental Results |journal=Journal of Imaging Science and Technology |date=1 March 2002 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=142\u2013154 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ist/jist/2002/00000046/00000002/art00009#expand/collapse |accessdate=1 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Maillard reaction====\nThe [[Maillard reaction]] is a form of non-enzymatic browning involving an amino acid and a reducing sugar. The [[cellulose]] fibers of the shroud are coated with a thin [[carbohydrate]] layer of [[starch]] fractions, various [[sugars]], and other impurities. In a paper entitled \"The Shroud of Turin: an amino-carbonyl reaction may explain the image formation,\"<ref>Rogers, R.N. and Arnoldi, A.: \"The Shroud of Turin: an amino-carbonyl reaction (Maillard reaction) may explain the image formation\", ''Melanoidins in Food and Health'', Volume 4, Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, Luxembourg, 2003, pp. 106\u2013113, {{ISBN|92-894-5724-4}}</ref> [[Raymond N. Rogers|Raymond Rogers]] and Anna Arnoldi propose that [[amine]]s from a recently deceased human body may have undergone Maillard reactions with this carbohydrate layer within a reasonable period of time, before liquid [[decomposition]] products stained or damaged the cloth. The gases produced by a dead body are extremely reactive chemically and within a few hours, in an environment such as a tomb, a body starts to produce heavier amines in its tissues such as [[putrescine]] and [[cadaverine]]. However the potential source for amines required for the reaction is a decomposing body,<ref name=Rogers2008/>{{rp|100}} and no signs of decomposition have been found on the Shroud.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shroudcentersocal.com/ |format= |title=Features of the Center |publisher=Shroud Center of Southern California |access-date=27 March 2010}}</ref> Rogers also notes that their tests revealed that there were no proteins or bodily fluids on the image areas.<ref name=Rogers2008/>{{rp|38}} Also, the image resolution and the uniform coloration of the linen resolution seem to be incompatible with a mechanism involving diffusion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last1=Fanti |first1=G. |last2=Botella |first2=J.

Giulio Fanti, a scientist at the [[University of Padua]], wrote an article on this subject with colleagues in 2005 that envisages electrostatic [[corona discharge]] as the probable mechanism to produce the images of the body in the Shroud.<ref>G. Fanti, F. Lattarulo, O. Scheuermann, \"[http://www.dii.unipd.it/-giulio.fanti/research/Sindone/corona.pdf Body Image Formation Hypotheses Based on Corona Discharge] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022011611/https://www.dii.unipd.it/-giulio.fanti/research/Sindone/corona.pdf |date=22 October 2016 }}\", 2005</ref> Congruent with that mechanism, they also describe an image on the reverse side of the fabric, much fainter than that on the front view of the body, consisting primarily of the face and perhaps hands. As with the front picture, it is entirely superficial, with coloration limited to the carbohydrate layer. The images correspond to, and are in registration with, those on the other side of the cloth. No image is detectable in the reverse side of the dorsal view of the body.\n\nRaymond Rogers criticized the theory, saying: \"It is clear that a corona discharge (plasma) in air will cause easily observable changes in a linen sample. No such effects can be observed in image fibers from the Shroud of Turin. Corona discharges and/or plasmas made no contribution to image formation.\"<ref name=Rogers2008>{{cite book |last1=Rogers |first1=Raymond N. |title=A Chemist's Perspective On The Shroud of Turin |date=2008 |publisher=[[Lulu (company)|Lulu Press, Inc.]] |isbn=978-0615239286 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p-n84sc4ayYC&pg=PA83}}</ref>{{rp|83}}\n\nIn December 2011, Fanti published a critical compendium of the major hypotheses regarding the formation of the body image on the shroud.

They demonstrated that the photochemical reactions caused by exposing linen to [[ultraviolet]] light could reproduce the main characteristics of the Shroud image, such as the shallowness of the coloration and the gradient of the color, which are not reproducible by other means. When subsequently illuminated with a UV lamp, the irradiated linen fabrics behaved like the linen of the Shroud. They also determined that UV radiation changes the crystalline structure of cellulose in a similar manner as aging and long-duration background radiation.<ref>{{cite web | first1=Paolo|last1=Di Lazzaro|first2=Daniele|last2=Murra|first3=Antonino|last3=Santoni|first4=Enrico|last4=Nichelatti|url=http://www.enea.it/it/produzione-scientifica/EAI/anno-2012/knowledge-diagnostics-and-preservation-of-cultural-heritage/the-conservation-of-the-shroud-of-turin-optical-studies |title=The Conservation of the Shroud of Turin: Optical Studies |accessdate=10 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416225452/http://www.enea.it/it/produzione-scientifica/EAI/anno-2012/knowledge-diagnostics-and-preservation-of-cultural-heritage/the-conservation-of-the-shroud-of-turin-optical-studies |archivedate=16 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=COLORAZIONE SIMIL\u2013SINDONICA DI TESSUTI DI LINO TRAMITE RADIAZIONE NEL LONTANO ULTRAVIOLETTO |issn=0393-3016 |url=http://opac.bologna.enea.it:8991/RT/2011/2011_14_ENEA.pdf}}</ref>\n\nPaolo Di Lazzaro, the lead researcher, indicated in an e-mail interview that \"...&nbsp;it appears unlikely a forger may have done this image with technologies available in the Middle Ages or earlier\", but their study does not mean the Shroud image was created by the flash of a miraculous resurrection, contrary to how the story was presented in the media, especially on the Web.<ref name=\"lazzaro\">{{cite web |url=http://cosmiclog.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/12/22/9636065-was-holy-shroud-created-in-a-flash-italian-researchers-resurrect-claim |title=Was Holy Shroud created in a flash?

However, what is claimed by some to be the image of a shroud on the Pray Codex has crosses on one side, an interlocking step pyramid pattern on the other, and no image of Jesus.

In 1453 Margaret de Charny deeded the Shroud to the [[House of Savoy]]. In 1578 the shroud was transferred to Turin. Since the 17th century the shroud has been displayed (e.g. in the chapel built for that purpose by [[Guarino Guarini]]<ref>John Beldon Scott, ''Architecture for the shroud: relic and ritual in Turin'', University of Chicago Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-226-74316-0}}, p. xxi</ref>) and in the 19th century it was first photographed during a public exhibition.\n\nIn 1532, the shroud suffered damage from a fire in a chapel of [[Chamb\u00e9ry]], capital of the [[Savoy]] region, where it was stored. A drop of molten silver from the reliquary produced a symmetrically placed mark through the layers of the folded cloth. [[Poor Clare Nuns]] attempted to repair this damage with patches.

Among the most prominent portable early ''acheiropoieta'' are the [[Image of Camuliana]] and the [[Mandylion]] or Image of [[Edessa]], both painted icons of Christ held in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and now generally regarded as lost or destroyed, as is the [[Hodegetria]] image of the Virgin.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kitzinger |first1=Ernst |title=The Cult of Images in the Age before Iconoclasm |journal=Dumbarton Oaks Papers |date=1954 |volume=8 |pages=83\u2013150 |doi=10.2307/1291064 |jstor=1291064}}</ref> Other early images in Italy, all heavily and unfortunately restored, that have been revered as ''acheiropoieta'' now have relatively little following, as attention has focused on the Shroud.\n\nProponents for the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin argue that empirical analysis and scientific methods are insufficient for understanding the methods used for image formation on the shroud, believing that the image was miraculously produced at the moment of [[Resurrection of Christ|Resurrection]].<ref>Charles S.

The authorization was granted and the first medal with the image was offered to [[Pope Pius XII]] who approved the medal. The image was then used on what became known as the [[Holy Face Medal]] worn by many Catholics, initially as a means of protection during World War II. In 1958 Pope Pius XII approved of the image in association with the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus, and declared its [[Feast of the Holy Winding Sheet of Christ|feast]] to be celebrated every year the day before [[Ash Wednesday]].<ref>Maria Rigamonti, ''Mother Maria Pierina'', Cenacle Publishing, 1999</ref><ref>Joan Carroll Cruz, \"Saintly Men of Modern Times\", ''Our Sunday Visitor'', 2003, {{ISBN|1-931709-77-7}}</ref> Following the approval by Pope Pius XII, Catholic devotions to the Holy Face of Jesus have been almost exclusively associated with the image on the shroud.\n\nIn 1983 the Shroud was given to the Holy See by the [[House of Savoy]].<ref name=\"Michael Freze 1993, p. 57\">Michael Freze, 1993, ''Voices, Visions, and Apparitions'', OSV Publishing, {{ISBN|0-87973-454-X}}, p. 57</ref> However, as with all relics of this kind, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] made no pronouncements on its authenticity.

A variety of scientific theories regarding the shroud have since been proposed, based on disciplines ranging from chemistry to biology and medical forensics to optical image analysis. The scientific approaches to the study of the Shroud fall into three groups: ''material analysis'' (both chemical and historical), ''biology and medical forensics'' and ''image analysis''.\n\n===Early studies===\n<!--THIS IS AN ENCYCLOPEDIA ARTICLE AND IS NOT INTENDED TO\nINCLUDE ENTIRE PASSAGES FROM BOOKS AND OTHER REFERENCES.\n\nPLEASE ADD INFORMATION IN A \"CONCISE\" FORM WITHOUT\nQUOTING LARGE SEGMENTS OF TEXT, IN ORDER TO KEEP THE\nARTICLE LENGTH WITHIN WIKIPEDIA LIMITS.

In 1902 [[Yves Delage]], a French professor of [[comparative anatomy]], published the first study on the subject.<ref name=\"Delage, Yves 1902\" /> Delage declared the image anatomically flawless and argued that the features of [[rigor mortis]], wounds, and blood flows were evidence that the image was formed by direct or indirect contact with a corpse. William Meacham mentions several other medical studies between 1936 and 1981 that agree with Delage.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" /> These were all indirect studies without access to the shroud itself.\n\nThe first direct examination of the shroud by a scientific team was undertaken in 1969\u20131973 in order to advise on preservation of the shroud and determine specific testing methods. This led to the appointment of an 11-member Turin Commission to advise on the preservation of the relic and on specific testing. Five of the commission members were scientists, and preliminary studies of samples of the fabric were conducted in 1973.<ref name=\"Meacham 1983\" />\n\nIn 1976 physicist John P. Jackson, thermodynamicist Eric Jumper and photographer William Mottern used [[image analysis]] technologies developed in aerospace science for analyzing the images of the Shroud. In 1977 these three scientists and over thirty others formed the [[Shroud of Turin Research Project]]. In 1978 this group, often called STURP, was given direct access to the Shroud.\n\nAlso in 1978, independently from the STURP research, Giovanni Tamburelli obtained at [[CSELT]] a 3D-elaboration from the Shroud with higher resolution than Jumper and Mottern. A second result of Tamburelli was the electronic removal from the image of the blood that apparently covers the face.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tamburelli |first1=Giovanni |title=Some Results in the Processing of the Holy Shroud of Turin |journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence |date=November 1981 |volume=PAMI-3 |issue=6 |pages=670\u2013676 |doi=10.1109/TPAMI.1981.4767168|pmid=21868987 }}</ref>\n\n===Material chemical analysis===\n[[File:discyellow.jpg |thumbnail |Phase contrast microscopic view of image-bearing fiber from the Shroud of Turin.

In fact, Jesus' hands and face are depicted with great detail, while his buttocks and his navel are faintly outlined or invisible, a discrepancy explained with the artist's consideration of modesty. Also, Jesus' right arm and hand are abnormally elongated, allowing him to modestly cover his genital area, which is physically impossible for an ordinary dead body lying supine.

To demonstrate this, he successfully produced photographic images similar to the shroud using only techniques and materials available at the time the shroud was supposedly made. He described his results in his PhD thesis,<ref>Allen, Nicholas P. L.

They first did a carbon-dust drawing of a Jesus-like face (using collagen dust) on a newsprint made from wood pulp (which is similar to 13th- and 14th-century paper). They next placed the drawing on a table and covered it with a piece of linen. They then pressed the linen against the newsprint by firmly rubbing with the flat side of a wooden spoon. By doing this they managed to create a reddish-brown image with a lifelike positive likeness of a person, a three-dimensional image and no sign of brush strokes.<ref>Craig, Emily A, Bresee, Randal R, \"Image Formation and the Shroud of Turin\", ''Journal of Imaging Science and Technology'', Volume 34, Number 1, 1994</ref> However, according to Fanti and Moroni, this does not reproduce many special features of the Shroud at microscopic level.<ref name=Fanti2002/>\n\n====Bas-relief====\nIn 1978, [[Joe Nickell]] noted that the Shroud image had a three-dimensional quality and thought its creation may have involved a sculpture of some type. He advanced the hypothesis that a medieval rubbing technique was used to explain the image, and set out to demonstrate this. He noted that while wrapping a cloth around a sculpture with normal contours would result in a distorted image, Nickell believed that wrapping a cloth over a [[bas-relief]] might result in an image like the one seen on the shroud, as it would eliminate wraparound distortions. For his demonstration, Nickell wrapped a wet cloth around a bas-relief sculpture and allowed it to dry. He then applied powdered pigment rather than wet paint (to prevent it soaking into the threads). The pigment was applied with a dauber, similar to making a rubbing from a gravestone. The result was an image with dark regions and light regions convincingly arranged. In a photo essay in ''[[Popular Photography]]'' magazine, Nickell demonstrated this technique step-by-step.<ref name = JNInquest/><ref name =PopPhoto>{{cite journal |last1=Nickell |first1=Joe |title=The Turin Shroud: Fake? Fact? Photograph? |journal=Popular Photography |volume=November 1979 |page=97-147}}</ref>{{efn|For his pigment, Nickell first used the burial spices myrrh and aloes, but changed to red iron oxide (the pigment [[Ochre|red ocher]]) when microanalyst, [[Walter McCrone]] identified it as constituting the shroud\u2019s image. (McCrone had identified the blood as red ochre and [[vermilion]] tempers paint.)<ref name = JNInquest/>}} Other researchers later replicated this process. \n\nIn 2005, researcher Jacques di Costanzo constructed a bas-relief of a Jesus-like face and draped wet linen over it. After the linen dried, he dabbed it with a mixture of [[ferric oxide]] and [[gelatine]]. The result was an image similar to that of the face on the Shroud. The imprinted image turned out to be wash-resistant, impervious to temperatures of {{convert |250 |C |abbr=on}} and was undamaged by exposure to a range of harsh chemicals, including bisulphite which, without the gelatine, would normally have degraded ferric oxide to the compound ferrous oxide.<ref name=\"'Ingham\">{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Ingham |title=Turin Shroud Confirmed as Fake |date=21 June 2005 |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |url=http://www.physorg.com/news4652.html |work=Physorg.com |pages=|access-date=17 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nInstead of painting, it has been suggested that the bas-relief could also be heated and used to scorch an image onto the cloth. However researcher Thibault Heimburger performed some experiments with the scorching of linen, and found that a scorch mark is only produced by direct contact with the hot object\u2014thus producing an all-or-nothing discoloration with no graduation of color as is found in the shroud.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://shroudofturin.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/scorch-paper-en.pdf |title=The Turin Shroud Body Image: The Scorch Hypothesis Revisited |author=Thibault Heimburger |accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Fanti and Moroni, after comparing the [[Color histogram|histogram]]s of 256 different grey levels, it was found that the image obtained with a bas-relief has grey values included between 60 and 256 levels, but it is much contrasted with wide areas of white saturation (levels included between 245 and 256) and lacks of intermediate grey levels (levels included between 160 and 200). The face image on the Shroud instead has grey tonalities that vary in the same values field (between 60 and 256), but the white saturation is much less marked and the histogram is practically flat in correspondence of the intermediate grey levels (levels included between 160 and 200).<ref name=Fanti2002>{{cite journal |last1=Fanti |first1=G. |last2=Moroni |first2=M. |title=Comparison of Luminance Between Face of Turin Shroud Man and Experimental Results |journal=Journal of Imaging Science and Technology |date=1 March 2002 |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=142\u2013154 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ist/jist/2002/00000046/00000002/art00009#expand/collapse |accessdate=1 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Maillard reaction====\nThe [[Maillard reaction]] is a form of non-enzymatic browning involving an amino acid and a reducing sugar.

Giulio Fanti, a scientist at the [[University of Padua]], wrote an article on this subject with colleagues in 2005 that envisages electrostatic [[corona discharge]] as the probable mechanism to produce the images of the body in the Shroud.<ref>G. Fanti, F. Lattarulo, O. Scheuermann, \"[http://www.dii.unipd.it/-giulio.fanti/research/Sindone/corona.pdf Body Image Formation Hypotheses Based on Corona Discharge] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022011611/https://www.dii.unipd.it/-giulio.fanti/research/Sindone/corona.pdf |date=22 October 2016 }}\", 2005</ref> Congruent with that mechanism, they also describe an image on the reverse side of the fabric, much fainter than that on the front view of the body, consisting primarily of the face and perhaps hands. As with the front picture, it is entirely superficial, with coloration limited to the carbohydrate layer. The images correspond to, and are in registration with, those on the other side of the cloth. No image is detectable in the reverse side of the dorsal view of the body.\n\nRaymond Rogers criticized the theory, saying: \"It is clear that a corona discharge (plasma) in air will cause easily observable changes in a linen sample. No such effects can be observed in image fibers from the Shroud of Turin.

They demonstrated that the photochemical reactions caused by exposing linen to [[ultraviolet]] light could reproduce the main characteristics of the Shroud image, such as the shallowness of the coloration and the gradient of the color, which are not reproducible by other means. When subsequently illuminated with a UV lamp, the irradiated linen fabrics behaved like the linen of the Shroud. They also determined that UV radiation changes the crystalline structure of cellulose in a similar manner as aging and long-duration background radiation.<ref>{{cite web | first1=Paolo|last1=Di Lazzaro|first2=Daniele|last2=Murra|first3=Antonino|last3=Santoni|first4=Enrico|last4=Nichelatti|url=http://www.enea.it/it/produzione-scientifica/EAI/anno-2012/knowledge-diagnostics-and-preservation-of-cultural-heritage/the-conservation-of-the-shroud-of-turin-optical-studies |title=The Conservation of the Shroud of Turin: Optical Studies |accessdate=10 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416225452/http://www.enea.it/it/produzione-scientifica/EAI/anno-2012/knowledge-diagnostics-and-preservation-of-cultural-heritage/the-conservation-of-the-shroud-of-turin-optical-studies |archivedate=16 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=COLORAZIONE SIMIL\u2013SINDONICA DI TESSUTI DI LINO TRAMITE RADIAZIONE NEL LONTANO ULTRAVIOLETTO |issn=0393-3016 |url=http://opac.bologna.enea.it:8991/RT/2011/2011_14_ENEA.pdf}}</ref>\n\nPaolo Di Lazzaro, the lead researcher, indicated in an e-mail interview that \"...&nbsp;it appears unlikely a forger may have done this image with technologies available in the Middle Ages or earlier\", but their study does not mean the Shroud image was created by the flash of a miraculous resurrection, contrary to how the story was presented in the media, especially on the Web.<ref name=\"lazzaro\">{{cite web |url=http://cosmiclog.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/12/22/9636065-was-holy-shroud-created-in-a-flash-italian-researchers-resurrect-claim |title=Was Holy Shroud created in a flash?
