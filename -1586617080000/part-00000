The continuity of glaciers, inferred from oriented [[glacial striation]]s and deposits called [[tillite]]s, suggested the existence of the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], which became a central element of the concept of continental drift. Striations indicated glacial flow away from the equator and toward the poles, based on continents' current positions and orientations, and supported the idea that the southern continents had previously been in dramatically different locations that were contiguous with one another.<ref name=wegb />\n\n== See also ==\n* {{annotated link|Geological history of Earth}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|27em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book |last=Frankel |first=Henry R.|date=2012 |title=The Continental Drift Controversy |volume=Volume I: ''Wegener and the Early Debate'' |publisher=Cambridge |ref=Frankel }}\n*{{Citation\n |first= Homer Eugene\n |last= Le Grand\n |year= 1988\n |title= Drifting Continents and Shifting Theories\n |publisher= Cambridge University\n |isbn= 978-0-521-31105-2\n |ref= none\n |url-access= registration\n |url= https://archive.org/details/driftingcontinen00legr\n }}.\n*{{Citation\n |first= Naomi |last= Oreskes\n |year= 1999\n |title= The Rejection of Continental Drift\n |publisher= Oxford University Press\n |isbn=  978-0-19-511732-5\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=EEQdk9GRfkoC&pg=PA14\n |ref= none\n}} (pb: {{ISBNT | 0-19-511733-6 }}).\n*{{Citation\n |first1        = Naomi\n |last1         = Oreskes\n |chapter       = Continental Drift\n |editor1-first = Ted\n |editor1-last  = Munn\n |editor2-first = Michael C.\n |editor2-last  = MacCracken\n |editor3-first = John S.\n |editor3-last  = Perry\n |date          = 2002\n |title         = Encyclopedia of Global Environmental Change\n |volume        = Vol. 1\n |pages         = 321\u2013325\n |publisher     = John Wiley & Sons\n |place         = Chichester, West Sussex\n |isbn          = 978-0-471-97796-4\n |oclc          = 633880622\n |chapter-url   = http://historyweb.ucsd.edu/oreskes/Papers/Continentaldrift2002.pdf\n |url-status       = dead\n |archiveurl    = https://web.archive.org/web/20120204234030/http://historyweb.ucsd.edu/oreskes/Papers/Continentaldrift2002.pdf\n |archivedate   = 4 February 2012\n |df            = dmy-all\n}} <!-- CAUTION: catalogs are inconsistent.

But gravitational measurements showed that many areas are not in isostatic equilibrium.\n* Third, there was the problem of why some parts of the Earth's surface (crust) should have solidified while other parts were still fluid.

In millions of years, [[slab pull]], [[ridge-push]], and other forces of [[tectonophysics]] will further separate and rotate those two continents. It was that temporary feature that inspired Wegener to study what he defined as continental drift although he did not live to see his hypothesis generally accepted.\n\nThe widespread distribution of [[Permo-Carboniferous]] glacial sediments in South America, Africa, Madagascar, Arabia, India, Antarctica and Australia was one of the major pieces of evidence for the theory of continental drift. The continuity of glaciers, inferred from oriented [[glacial striation]]s and deposits called [[tillite]]s, suggested the existence of the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]], which became a central element of the concept of continental drift. Striations indicated glacial flow away from the equator and toward the poles, based on continents' current positions and orientations, and supported the idea that the southern continents had previously been in dramatically different locations that were contiguous with one another.<ref name=wegb />\n\n== See also ==\n* {{annotated link|Geological history of Earth}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|27em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book |last=Frankel |first=Henry R.|date=2012 |title=The Continental Drift Controversy |volume=Volume I: ''Wegener and the Early Debate'' |publisher=Cambridge |ref=Frankel }}\n*{{Citation\n |first= Homer Eugene\n |last= Le Grand\n |year= 1988\n |title= Drifting Continents and Shifting Theories\n |publisher= Cambridge University\n |isbn= 978-0-521-31105-2\n |ref= none\n |url-access= registration\n |url= https://archive.org/details/driftingcontinen00legr\n }}.\n*{{Citation\n |first= Naomi |last= Oreskes\n |year= 1999\n |title= The Rejection of Continental Drift\n |publisher= Oxford University Press\n |isbn=  978-0-19-511732-5\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=EEQdk9GRfkoC&pg=PA14\n |ref= none\n}} (pb: {{ISBNT | 0-19-511733-6 }}).\n*{{Citation\n |first1        = Naomi\n |last1         = Oreskes\n |chapter       = Continental Drift\n |editor1-first = Ted\n |editor1-last  = Munn\n |editor2-first = Michael C.\n |editor2-last  = MacCracken\n |editor3-first = John S.\n |editor3-last  = Perry\n |date          = 2002\n |title         = Encyclopedia of Global Environmental Change\n |volume        = Vol. 1\n |pages         = 321\u2013325\n |publisher     = John Wiley & Sons\n |place         = Chichester, West Sussex\n |isbn          = 978-0-471-97796-4\n |oclc          = 633880622\n |chapter-url   = http://historyweb.ucsd.edu/oreskes/Papers/Continentaldrift2002.pdf\n |url-status       = dead\n |archiveurl    = https://web.archive.org/web/20120204234030/http://historyweb.ucsd.edu/oreskes/Papers/Continentaldrift2002.pdf\n |archivedate   = 4 February 2012\n |df            = dmy-all\n}} <!-- CAUTION: catalogs are inconsistent.

In that version, [[Peter Ustinov]] narrates and voices the main role of the bird.\n\n==Plot==\n===Chapter 1===\n\nThe film begins with a desolate landscape and a hill of rubble near the skyline; a bird known only as \"L'Oiseau\" walks in and addresses the audience and says that it's an honor and privilege to tell you the story you are about to see, and that for once it's absolutely true; the bird then says he knows because he was there and he wasn't alone. As L'Oiseau begins the story, the hill of rubble transforms into a great palace. The bird states he built his nest on top of the roof of the palace that was of the vast kingdom of [[tachycardia|Takicardia]]. In those days, the kingdom was ruled by the king with the unwieldy title of Charles V + III = VIII + VIII = XVI, the bird states he wasn't a very good king; a heartless tyrant that hated everyone and was hated in return. He was also lonely and his favorite pastime was hunting; the bird states, \"as you can imagine, we weren't the best of friends\". Despite his fondness for hunting, the king is unfortunately [[cross-eyed]] \u2013 not that anyone would dare acknowledge this in front of him, as the numerous statues and paintings that adorn the palace show him with regular eyes.\n\nSeveral of the king's retainers, nobles, guards, and police (who all bear a resemblance to [[Thomson and Thompson]]), are waiting for the king to appear for the hunt. L'Oiseau's wife was revealed to have been killed by the king (one in a million shot), and he now takes pleasure in taunting the terrible king at every opportunity. As horns are blown \"for the hunt\", the bird flies to the palace (from the grave of his wife), as the king and his dog arrive for the hunt; the king removes his crown and ruler and replaces them with a hunting rifle and hat, as the chief of police (the only one with a goatee) pushes a bird out of a box-cage revealed to be one of L'Oiseau's four children. The king starts shooting and missing to the applause of his sycophantic supporters, just as the bird swoops in and rescues his son; he denounces the king to be a murderer and an awful thug. The king retorts by calling him bird-brain, but the bird retorts back that the king is the bird-brain. L\u2019Oiseau and his son escape as the police attempt to shoot them down.\n\nThe king, his dog, and butler reenter the palace and then enter a pod-shaped elevator (exclusively for the king's use), wherein the butler mans the controls. An announcer list out numerous locations that begin on the first floor and up including: cases pending, litigation, treasury, goldsmithery, inland revenue, liquidation, premium bonds, royal family, state prison, summer prison, winter prison, hard labor for young and old, armaments, war office, undersecretary's office in peacetime, armory, fireworks, furs, hosiery, hats, helmets, trumpets, drums, police, lavatories, armed forces, royal printing office, registered post, taxes, solitary confinement, dungeons and catacombs, umbrellas, casino, shooting gallery, war museum, zoo, portraits of ancestors, the king's studio, the king's hostel, the gallows, the royal barber, the royal pedicurist, the king's steam bath and spa, the king's chamber music, and trumpeters. (The segment is hilarious because in the original French dubbing, many of the things listed rhyme as the announcer says this all without a break in a monotone voice, as well as several of the things listed being ridiculously placed in the palace, ex. the dungeons and catacombs are usually below or beneath a palace; another being some of the items on the list are the same thing or should be listed together, ex. armaments and armory, as well as trumpets and trumpeters.) While all of this is happening as the pod approaches its destination, L'Oiseau swoops in and mocks the king by crossing his eyes and laughing as he flies off; the butler alarmed by this accelerates the pod to reach its point quicker, hilariously causing the king's crown to be temporarily stuck on his head.\n\n===Chapter 2===\n\nThe pod arrives at the king's art gallery, wherein the new royal painter is commissioned to create a portrait of the king with his hunting gear; the artist succeeds in painting the king perfectly, however when he's about to paint the eyes he becomes confused over whether to paint it truthfully cross-eyed or untruthfully regular. The king suddenly looks at the artist, causing him to paint the portrait with cross-eyes; the chief of police (who's present) moans, the king moves to look at the painting with the artist and the chief on either side. The king appears to consent to artist's final touch, with the chief stepping aside and the king and the artist walking towards a velvet curtain covering the doorway to the gallery. The king presents the artist with a medal to represent his status as the new royal painter, the artist thanks the king and turns around to walk out; but unbeknownst to the artist, the king has invisible trapdoors built into the floor that lead to imminent death everywhere in the vast palace, with cords or buttons that have a skull on them. Anyone whom the king dislikes or has displeased him even in some small way, has met with this same grim fate. Once the artist walks into the outlined area, the king pulls the cord and the artist (like so many unseen others before him) is never seen again save for his wig that the king kicks like a [[ball (association football)|football]] to his dog (even tripping over it once). The chief has two of his officers remove the king's portrait to an unknown location as the king and his dog return to the pod to proceed to the next destination.\n\nL'Oiseau arrives back at his nest and reunites his son with his other children; meanwhile, the pod arrives at the 296th (top) floor of the palace which is the king's secret apartment where he and his dog live (and also L\u2019Oiseau's nest is built on top of the apartment's roof), the butler drops off the dog but the king being paranoid or just plain evil goes to a small portrait on the wall and pushes a button hidden behind it which opens another trapdoor beneath the doormat, axing off the butler. The king climbs up a set of stairs in the dark arriving at the apartment; a large cube-shaped room with windows, several pieces of furniture, a fireplace, a potted tree that sits in the center of the floor, a piano, a large statue of a man on a horse, the beds of the king and his dog, and the walls are adorned with a collection of the king's favorite pieces of art. The king pours himself a glass of wine and winds up a music-box (that plays a song in the background) and then heads over to the painting of the beautiful Shepherdess and bashfully admires it, he then turns to look at the opposing painting of the handsome Chimney Sweep and frowns, he then turns back to the Shepherdess's painting and smiles again. The king then turns around revealing that the police had his portrait (just recently made) taken to his apartment. The king then takes a paint brush just as the bird flies in and lands on his windowsill; the king takes the brush and fixes the painting to have regular eyes, but just as he admires his handy-work, the bird taps the window gaining the king's attention resulting in the bird crossing his eyes and mockingly laughing at the king before flying off once again. The king sniffs the air then heads over to the mirror looking at his cross-eyed reflection, suddenly the king grabs a candlestick and furiously shatters the mirror into a million pieces!\n\nAs daylight dims and becomes night, L'Oiseau sings a booming lullaby to his children as they go to sleep; the lights of the palace are turned off as the song ends, then the bird continues on the same chord with a different verse, now mocking the king in his sleep hoping to give him nightmares as the full moon begins to shine; the police on patrol are angered by the bird's continued tom-foolery. In the king's apartment as the fire in the fireplace still burns bright while the king is tossing and turning in bed, it is revealed that the Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep (along with the Statue of a man on a horse) have come to life. The young lovers talk about their mutual disliking of the king as well as their mutual love for each other. The sleepy Statue (who is also a bit senile) talks about how they are not meant for each other based on his own \"experience\", as it's revealed that the king's portrait has also come to life as well who listens in on their conversation. The star-crossed lovers reach out of their paintings to hold hands, but the king's dog suddenly wakes up and growls; the Chimney Sweep shushes the dog who goes back to bed. As the Chimney Sweep jumps from his painting to the Shepherdess's, the Portrait King unfurls the cloth covering his painting to the shock of the couple; he declares his love for the Shepherdess but denounces the Chimney Sweep and confirms with the Statue that the king always gets the girl, the Statue confirms this and declares that the Portrait King and the Shepherdess will wed when the clock strikes 12 (right before he returns to sleep), as it is revealed that it's 5 minutes until that time.\n\nThe Chimney Sweep hurls a fruit from the Shepherdess's painting at the Portrait King (blinding him), which he then proceeds to take his ladder and use it to help the Shepherdess and himself escape from their paintings. As the couple run to the fireplace, the Statue once again talks from \"experience\" that they won't go far and that they'll be back; the Portrait King finally clears his eyes only to find them nowhere to be found (the couple being in front of the fireplace where a large arm-couch blocks his view), a woman holding a pitcher of water laughs at the couple's folly only for the Portrait King (who can't find them and thinks the woman is laughing at him) to shoot at her with his rifle but hitting the pitcher instead which spills out and temporarily douses the fire. The Statue is awoken once again and senilely makes shushing noises as the couple uses the Chimney Sweep's ladder to go up the chimney just before the fire comes back. The Portrait King escapes from his painting to find them gone, to which the Statue says from experience that they're gone; just as the clock strikes 12 and begins to chime, the couple find themselves sitting on top of the chimney looking at the star-covered night sky. The Shepherdess says she never thought it would be so beautiful just as a shooting star goes across the sky.\n\n===Chapter 3===\n\nBut they are pursued by a non-cross-eyed painting of the king that also has come to life, deposed the real king and has taken his place. He orders the capture of the shepherdess and the sweep, but the bird is there to help when called upon. Later, the shepherdess and the Chimney sweep find themselves in the lower city, where the inhabitants have never seen the light. Meanwhile, the king summons a robot built for him, and he attacks the village. He takes the shepherdess and captures the chimney sweep, the bird, and a blind organ grinder from the village, putting the organ grinder in a pen of lions and tigers. The King forces the shepherdess to agree to marry him, threatening to kill the chimney sweep if she does not accept. When she does, the King sends the chimney sweep and the bird to paint manufactured sculptures of his head on a conveyor belt. They begin to ruin the sculptures, and are sent to jail, where the lions and tigers have been listening to the organ grinder playing. The bird convinces them to help the shepherdess, saying that her marriage to the King prevents her from tending to the sheep, which the animals eat. The animals break out of the jail and attack the interviewers and king in the chapel. The bird and his sons take control of the robot and start destroying the castle. Once the castle is in rubble, the King tries to attack the couple, but the robot grabs him and blew him away. Sitting on the ruins of the castle the next morning, the robot sees one of the Bird's sons trapped in a cage. After freeing the bird, the robot smashes the cage, symbolizing the birds' freedom and the movie ends.\n\n{{further|The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep}}\nOnly the early scene in the secret apartment is based on \"The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep\", while the rest of the movie focuses much more on the king and the bird, hence the ultimate title. In Andersen's tale, the shepherdess and the chimney sweep are china figurines, rather than paintings, and a wooden (mahogany) satyr wishes to wed the shepherdess, supported by a Chinaman, rather than a king and a classical statue. In both tales, the Chinaman/statue breaks, and the duo escape up the chimney, and delight in celestial bodies, but in Andersen's tale the shepherdess is afraid of the wide world and the duo return; this is echoed in the movie where the statue predicts that they will return.\n\nThe 1952 film ends with the mockingbird taking a photo of the newly-wed shepherdess and chimney sweep along with the king's dog, all of the Bird's sons and others after the king vanquished.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/The_Curious_Adventures_of_Mr._Wonderbird Internet Archive]</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Pierre Brasseur]] (1952 version), [[Jean Martin]] (1980 version) as l'oiseau (The Mockingbird), the King's worst enemy whom he constantly taunts.

Grimault's partner Andr\u00e9 Sarrut (the producer) then released the film unfinished in [[1952 in film|1952]], against Grimault and Pr\u00e9vert's wishes, which caused a rift between partners, and they went their separate ways. In [[1967 in film|1967]], Grimault regained possession of the film, and spent the next decade trying to finance a new version under his supervision.

In [[1980 in film|1980]] the finished film was finally released under a new title, ''Le Roi et l'Oiseau'' \u2013 to make clear the distinction from the earlier version \u2013 and shortly after the death of Pr\u00e9vert, to whom the film is dedicated.\n\nThe completed film uses 42 of the 62 minutes of the 1952 footage,<ref name=\"dossier\" /> and, at 87 minutes, includes significant new animation, completely different music, and a very different,  more symbolic ending. Some footage is cut, such as the bird taking over the role as announcer at the wedding and the original ending. The new footage includes both entirely new scenes, and changes to existing scenes. For example, in the completed film, the initial scenes of the king practicing target shooting and having his portrait painted are new, while the scene of the king shooting at the baby bird, which falls between these two, was from the 1952 footage. The differences between the old and new animation are visible at some points in a single scene, most noticeably in the lion pit, where the lions are drawn in two very different styles;<ref>[http://ghiblicon.blogspot.com/2009/04/video-le-roi-et-loiseau-king-and.html Video \u2013 ''Le Roi et l'oiseau'' (The King and Mockingbird)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011202354/http://ghiblicon.blogspot.com/2009/04/video-le-roi-et-loiseau-king-and.html |date=2009-10-11 }}, The Ghibli Blog, by Daniel Thomas MacInnes, 23 April 2009, [http://ghiblicon.blogspot.com/2009/04/video-le-roi-et-loiseau-king-and.html?showComment=1240532280000#c7882950333792667205 comment by Chris] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011232556/http://ghiblicon.blogspot.com/2009/04/video-le-roi-et-loiseau-king-and.html?showComment=1240532280000 |date=2009-10-11 }}</ref> the simpler, more abstract lions are the new animation.\n\nThe production of the music is unusual in that Grimault left it entirely in the hands of [[Wojciech Kilar]] \u2013 Grimault gave no instruction as to what music he desired, nor was there any back-and-forth, but simply shared the movie with Kilar, who studied it carefully, then went to Poland, recorded it, and returned with the completed score, which was accepted unchanged.<ref name=\"dossier\" /> The music, while was made available on a soundtrack album, does not exist any official edited music sheet for this music.

In the early 1970s, Pr\u00e9vert and Grimault also made two dark animations, one apocalyptic \u2013 ''Le Chien m\u00e9lomane'' (''The Melomaniac Dog'') (1973), which features a dog wielding a violin that caused destruction at a distance and leaves the world a gray waste (as in the end of ''Le Roi''); both are collected in ''La table tournante.''\n\nGrimault did not directly reuse characters between his animations, but similar characters recur \u2013 the twin police officers in ''Voleur de paratonnerres'' (The lightning rod thief) are recalled by Le Sir de Massouf in ''La Fl\u00fbte magique'' (The Magic Flute), then reappears as the chief of police in ''The King and the Mockingbird.''

Begun in [[1948 in film|1948]] as '''''The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep''''' (loosely based on the [[The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep|fairy tale of the same name]] by [[Hans Christian Andersen]]), the film was a collaboration between Grimault and popular French poet and screenwriter, [[Jacques Pr\u00e9vert]]. However, the film suddenly stopped production and was released unfinished by its producer in 1952, without the approval of either Grimault or Pr\u00e9vert. Through the course of the 1960s and 1970s, Grimault obtained the rights to the film and was able to complete a new version as they originally intended. The film was completed over 30 years after production commenced.\n\nThe film is today regarded as a [[masterpiece]]<ref>[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_king_and_the_mockingbird/reviews/ Rotten Tomatoes]</ref> of [[French animation]] and has been cited by the Japanese directors [[Hayao Miyazaki]] and [[Isao Takahata]] as an influence.

A low-budget English-language release of the 1952 version, dubbed ''The Curious Adventures of Mr. Wonderbird'', is in the [[public domain]] and available free online. In that version, [[Peter Ustinov]] narrates and voices the main role of the bird.\n\n==Plot==\n===Chapter 1===\n\nThe film begins with a desolate landscape and a hill of rubble near the skyline; a bird known only as \"L'Oiseau\" walks in and addresses the audience and says that it's an honor and privilege to tell you the story you are about to see, and that for once it's absolutely true; the bird then says he knows because he was there and he wasn't alone. As L'Oiseau begins the story, the hill of rubble transforms into a great palace. The bird states he built his nest on top of the roof of the palace that was of the vast kingdom of [[tachycardia|Takicardia]]. In those days, the kingdom was ruled by the king with the unwieldy title of Charles V + III = VIII + VIII = XVI, the bird states he wasn't a very good king; a heartless tyrant that hated everyone and was hated in return. He was also lonely and his favorite pastime was hunting; the bird states, \"as you can imagine, we weren't the best of friends\". Despite his fondness for hunting, the king is unfortunately [[cross-eyed]] \u2013 not that anyone would dare acknowledge this in front of him, as the numerous statues and paintings that adorn the palace show him with regular eyes.\n\nSeveral of the king's retainers, nobles, guards, and police (who all bear a resemblance to [[Dupond et Dupont|Thomson and Thompson]]), are waiting for the king to appear for the hunt. L'Oiseau's wife was revealed to have been killed by the king (one in a million shot), and he now takes pleasure in taunting the terrible king at every opportunity. As horns are blown \"for the hunt\", the bird flies to the palace (from the grave of his wife), as the king and his dog arrive for the hunt; the king removes his crown and ruler and replaces them with a hunting rifle and hat, as the chief of police (the only one with a goatee) pushes a bird out of a box-cage revealed to be one of L'Oiseau's four children. The king starts shooting and missing to the applause of his sycophantic supporters, just as the bird swoops in and rescues his son; he denounces the king to be a murderer and an awful thug. The king retorts by calling him bird-brain, but the bird retorts back that the king is the bird-brain. L\u2019Oiseau and his son escape as the police attempt to shoot them down.\n\nThe king, his dog, and butler reenter the palace and then enter a pod-shaped elevator (exclusively for the king's use), wherein the butler mans the controls. An announcer list out numerous locations that begin on the first floor and up including: cases pending, litigation, treasury, goldsmithery, inland revenue, liquidation, premium bonds, royal family, state prison, summer prison, winter prison, hard labor for young and old, armaments, war office, undersecretary's office in peacetime, armory, fireworks, furs, hosiery, hats, helmets, trumpets, drums, police, lavatories, armed forces, royal printing office, registered post, taxes, solitary confinement, dungeons and catacombs, umbrellas, casino, shooting gallery, war museum, zoo, portraits of ancestors, the king's studio, the king's hostel, the gallows, the royal barber, the royal pedicurist, the king's steam bath and spa, the king's chamber music, and trumpeters. (The segment is hilarious because in the original French dubbing, many of the things listed rhyme as the announcer says this all without a break in a monotone voice, as well as several of the things listed being ridiculously placed in the palace, ex. the dungeons and catacombs are usually below or beneath a palace; another being some of the items on the list are the same thing or should be listed together, ex. armaments and armory, as well as trumpets and trumpeters.) While all of this is happening as the pod approaches its destination, L'Oiseau swoops in and mocks the king by crossing his eyes and laughing as he flies off; the butler alarmed by this accelerates the pod to reach its point quicker, hilariously causing the king's crown to be temporarily stuck on his head.\n\n===Chapter 2===\n\nThe pod arrives at the king's art gallery, wherein the new royal painter is commissioned to create a portrait of the king with his hunting gear; the artist succeeds in painting the king perfectly, however when he's about to paint the eyes he becomes confused over whether to paint it truthfully cross-eyed or untruthfully regular. The king suddenly looks at the artist, causing him to paint the portrait with cross-eyes; the chief of police (who's present) moans, the king moves to look at the painting with the artist and the chief on either side. The king appears to consent to artist's final touch, with the chief stepping aside and the king and the artist walking towards a velvet curtain covering the doorway to the gallery. The king presents the artist with a medal to represent his status as the new royal painter, the artist thanks the king and turns around to walk out; but unbeknownst to the artist, the king has invisible trapdoors built into the floor that lead to imminent death everywhere in the vast palace, with cords or buttons that have a skull on them. Anyone whom the king dislikes or has displeased him even in some small way, has met with this same grim fate. Once the artist walks into the outlined area, the king pulls the cord and the artist (like so many unseen others before him) is never seen again save for his wig that the king kicks like a [[ball (association football)|football]] to his dog (even tripping over it once). The chief has two of his officers remove the king's portrait to an unknown location as the king and his dog return to the pod to proceed to the next destination.\n\nL'Oiseau arrives back at his nest and reunites his son with his other children; meanwhile, the pod arrives at the 296th (top) floor of the palace which is the king's secret apartment where he and his dog live (and also L\u2019Oiseau's nest is built on top of the apartment's roof), the butler drops off the dog but the king being paranoid or just plain evil goes to a small portrait on the wall and pushes a button hidden behind it which opens another trapdoor beneath the doormat, axing off the butler. The king climbs up a set of stairs in the dark arriving at the apartment; a large cube-shaped room with windows, several pieces of furniture, a fireplace, a potted tree that sits in the center of the floor, a piano, a large statue of a man on a horse, the beds of the king and his dog, and the walls are adorned with a collection of the king's favorite pieces of art. The king pours himself a glass of wine and winds up a music-box (that plays a song in the background) and then heads over to the painting of the beautiful Shepherdess and bashfully admires it, he then turns to look at the opposing painting of the handsome Chimney Sweep and frowns, he then turns back to the Shepherdess's painting and smiles again. The king then turns around revealing that the police had his portrait (just recently made) taken to his apartment. The king then takes a paint brush just as the bird flies in and lands on his windowsill; the king takes the brush and fixes the painting to have regular eyes, but just as he admires his handy-work, the bird taps the window gaining the king's attention resulting in the bird crossing his eyes and mockingly laughing at the king before flying off once again. The king sniffs the air then heads over to the mirror looking at his cross-eyed reflection, suddenly the king grabs a candlestick and furiously shatters the mirror into a million pieces!\n\nAs daylight dims and becomes night, L'Oiseau sings a booming lullaby to his children as they go to sleep; the lights of the palace are turned off as the song ends, then the bird continues on the same chord with a different verse, now mocking the king in his sleep hoping to give him nightmares as the full moon begins to shine; the police on patrol are angered by the bird's continued tom-foolery. In the king's apartment as the fire in the fireplace still burns bright while the king is tossing and turning in bed, it is revealed that the Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep (along with the Statue of a man on a horse) have come to life. The young lovers talk about their mutual disliking of the king as well as their mutual love for each other. The sleepy Statue (who is also a bit senile) talks about how they are not meant for each other based on his own \"experience\", as it's revealed that the king's portrait has also come to life as well who listens in on their conversation. The star-crossed lovers reach out of their paintings to hold hands, but the king's dog suddenly wakes up and growls; the Chimney Sweep shushes the dog who goes back to bed. As the Chimney Sweep jumps from his painting to the Shepherdess's, the Portrait King unfurls the cloth covering his painting to the shock of the couple; he declares his love for the Shepherdess but denounces the Chimney Sweep and confirms with the Statue that the king always gets the girl, the Statue confirms this and declares that the Portrait King and the Shepherdess will wed when the clock strikes 12 (right before he returns to sleep), as it is revealed that it's 5 minutes until that time.\n\nThe Chimney Sweep hurls a fruit from the Shepherdess's painting at the Portrait King (blinding him), which he then proceeds to take his ladder and use it to help the Shepherdess and himself escape from their paintings. As the couple run to the fireplace, the Statue once again talks from \"experience\" that they won't go far and that they'll be back; the Portrait King finally clears his eyes only to find them nowhere to be found (the couple being in front of the fireplace where a large arm-couch blocks his view), a woman holding a pitcher of water laughs at the couple's folly only for the Portrait King (who can't find them and thinks the woman is laughing at him) to shoot at her with his rifle but hitting the pitcher instead which spills out and temporarily douses the fire. The Statue is awoken once again and senilely makes shushing noises as the couple uses the Chimney Sweep's ladder to go up the chimney just before the fire comes back. The Portrait King escapes from his painting to find them gone, to which the Statue says from experience that they're gone; just as the clock strikes 12 and begins to chime, the couple find themselves sitting on top of the chimney looking at the star-covered night sky. The Shepherdess says she never thought it would be so beautiful just as a shooting star goes across the sky.\n\n===Chapter 3===\n\nBut they are pursued by a non-cross-eyed painting of the king that also has come to life, deposed the real king and has taken his place. He orders the capture of the shepherdess and the sweep, but the bird is there to help when called upon. Later, the shepherdess and the Chimney sweep find themselves in the lower city, where the inhabitants have never seen the light. Meanwhile, the king summons a robot built for him, and he attacks the village. He takes the shepherdess and captures the chimney sweep, the bird, and a blind organ grinder from the village, putting the organ grinder in a pen of lions and tigers. The King forces the shepherdess to agree to marry him, threatening to kill the chimney sweep if she does not accept. When she does, the King sends the chimney sweep and the bird to paint manufactured sculptures of his head on a conveyor belt. They begin to ruin the sculptures, and are sent to jail, where the lions and tigers have been listening to the organ grinder playing. The bird convinces them to help the shepherdess, saying that her marriage to the King prevents her from tending to the sheep, which the animals eat. The animals break out of the jail and attack the interviewers and king in the chapel. The bird and his sons take control of the robot and start destroying the castle. Once the castle is in rubble, the King tries to attack the couple, but the robot grabs him and blew him away. Sitting on the ruins of the castle the next morning, the robot sees one of the Bird's sons trapped in a cage. After freeing the bird, the robot smashes the cage, symbolizing the birds' freedom and the movie ends.\n\n{{further|The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep}}\nOnly the early scene in the secret apartment is based on \"The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep\", while the rest of the movie focuses much more on the king and the bird, hence the ultimate title. In Andersen's tale, the shepherdess and the chimney sweep are china figurines, rather than paintings, and a wooden (mahogany) satyr wishes to wed the shepherdess, supported by a Chinaman, rather than a king and a classical statue. In both tales, the Chinaman/statue breaks, and the duo escape up the chimney, and delight in celestial bodies, but in Andersen's tale the shepherdess is afraid of the wide world and the duo return; this is echoed in the movie where the statue predicts that they will return.\n\nThe 1952 film ends with the mockingbird taking a photo of the newly-wed shepherdess and chimney sweep along with the king's dog, all of the Bird's sons and others after the king vanquished.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/The_Curious_Adventures_of_Mr._Wonderbird Internet Archive]</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Pierre Brasseur]] (1952 version), [[Jean Martin]] (1980 version) as l'oiseau (The Mockingbird), the King's worst enemy whom he constantly taunts.

Grimault's partner Andr\u00e9 Sarrut (the producer) then released the film unfinished in [[1952 in film|1952]], against Grimault and Pr\u00e9vert's wishes, which caused a rift between partners, and they went their separate ways. In [[1967 in film|1967]], Grimault regained possession of the film, and spent the next decade trying to finance a new version under his supervision.

In [[1980 in film|1980]] the finished film was finally released under a new title, ''Le Roi et l'Oiseau'' \u2013 to make clear the distinction from the earlier version \u2013 and shortly after the death of Pr\u00e9vert, to whom the film is dedicated.\n\nThe completed film uses 42 of the 62 minutes of the 1952 footage,<ref name=\"dossier\" /> and, at 87 minutes, includes significant new animation, completely different music, and a very different,  more symbolic ending. Some footage is cut, such as the bird taking over the role as announcer at the wedding and the original ending. The new footage includes both entirely new scenes, and changes to existing scenes. For example, in the completed film, the initial scenes of the king practicing target shooting and having his portrait painted are new, while the scene of the king shooting at the baby bird, which falls between these two, was from the 1952 footage.

The unprecedented military coup against a prime minister appointed by the emperor and who enjoyed the confidence of the Chamber of Deputies quickly escalated to the proclamation of the republic on that same date; thus, Emperor Pedro II of Brazil was deposed by Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca and the monarchy was declared abolished. The constitution then in force ceased to operate, and the Empire of Brazil, a unitary state, was replaced with a federal republic, each province of the empire becoming a state. Until the organization of the republic's constitutional order, however, the central Government appointed the governments of the several States. The imperial Parliament (the General Assembly) was dissolved, and Deodoro formed a provisional government. Deodoro as head of the provisional government could appoint and dismiss the other members of that government, and discharged by decree absolute legislative and executive powers. The provisional government was in effect a dictatorship, and remaining monarchist sentiment in society was repressed, as the government and the army were committed to the consolidation of the recently declared republic. The imperial family and their descendants were banished from the country by decree of the provisional government, and the dynasty's exile was only revoked in 1920. On 15 January 1890 Deodoro, as head of the Provisional Government, assumed for himself the unique military rank of [[Generalissimo]] of Land and Sea. In 1890 elections for a constituent congress were held, but the congress (made up of a senate with equal representation of the newly declared states and of a Chamber of Deputies with delegations proportional to the size of the population of each State) was required to adopt a constitution that conformed to the republican system of government and to the federal model of state. Congress assembled in November 1890 and a draft constitution, prepared by a committee of republican jurists and politicians appointed by the Provisional Government, was submitted to Congress by the head of the provisional government, and formed the basis for the congressional deliberations. The Constitution was promulgated by Congress on 24 February 1891. It confirmed the abolition of the parliamentary system of government and created a presidential Executive, widely based on the model of the United States of America. Presidents and vice-presidents were to be elected for 4 years, without the possibility of re-election, by direct popular ballot, but for the first presidential term, Congress was to conduct the election immediately after the adoption of the constitution. Subsequent presidents were to be elected on 1 March and inaugurated on 15 November, starting in the year 1894. Accordingly, under those transitional rules, on 25 February 1891, the day after the adoption of the constitution, Congress voted for president and vice-president, and the then head of the provisional government, Generalissimo Deodoro da Fonseca, was elected to become the nation's first President. The voting for vice-president took place immediately after the counting of the votes for President, and Marshal Floriano Peixoto was chosen by Congress to be the first vice-president. The swearing in of Deodoro da Fonseca and Floriano Peixoto as president and vice-president, respectively, took place on the following day, 26 February 1891, and that inauguration marked the termination of the Provisional Government.}}\n| 23 November 1891 {{efn|In a coup d'\u00e9tat on 3 November 1891, President Deodoro da Fonseca shut down the National Congress and ruled by decree for a few weeks, attempting to suspend the Constitution and to establish a dictatorial regime in the fashion of the Spanish American ''[[caudillos]]''. There was a reaction by the Brazilian Navy against Deodoro's coup (the [[Revolta da Armada|First Revolt of the Armada]]) and Deodoro was forced to resign the presidency. Deodoro was effectively deposed by the forces loyal to the Constitution in a counter-coup d'\u00e9tat, but because he yielded to the demands of the Navy and agreed to resign the presidency, neither the constitutional impeachment process nor a formal overthrow without impeachment (that would also have been a violation of the Constitution, this time by the counter-coup forces) took place, and instead Deodoro's removal from office was formalized as a simple resignation. Many officers in the Brazilian Navy were still monarchists, opposed Deodoro, and only reluctantly accepted the newly created Republic, but were unwilling to see it be transformed from a constitutional state into a dictatorship. Upon Deodoro's resignation on 23 November 1891, Vice-President Floriano Peixoto succeeded to the presidency and reversed Deodoro's coup. The constitutional legal order was restored, Deodoro's dissolution of Congress was deemed null and void, and Deodoro's other acts since the coup were similarly declared invalid.}}\n| None (''military'')\n| style=\"background:gray;\"|\n| [[Floriano Peixoto]]\n| President of the [[Rio Grande do Sul|S\u00e3o Pedro do Rio Grande do Sul]] [[Provinces of Brazil|Province]]\n| [[Marechal Deodoro, Alagoas|Cidade das Alagoas]], [[Alagoas]]\n|-\n! style=\"background:gray; color:white;\"| 2\n| '''[[Floriano Peixoto]]'''<br />{{small|(1839\u20131895)}}\n| [[File:Floriano Peixoto (1891).jpg|100px]]\n| \u2014\n| 23 November 1891\n| 14 November 1894 {{efn|Marshal of the Army Floriano Peixoto, Deodoro's Vice-President, succeeded to the Presidency upon President Manuel Deodoro da Fonseca's resignation. The Constitution then in force stipulated that, whenever the Presidency became vacant during the first half of presidential term, new elections should be summoned at once, and the Vice-President should serve as President only until the inauguration of a new elected President. Deodoro had resigned during the first half of his presidential term (he had been sworn-in as President on 26 February 1891 to serve until 15 November 1894 and had resigned the office on 23 November 1891), but the new President, Floriano Peixoto, refused to summon new elections, arguing that the constitutional provision requiring new elections should only apply if the Presidency had been vacated during the first half of the presidential term by a President elected by direct popular ballot under the permanent provisions of the Constitution. Floriano held that, because Deodoro and himself had been respectively elected President and Vice-President by the Constituent Congress under the transitional provisions of the Constitution, and because the Constitution directed that the first elections by direct popular ballot should be held on 1 March 1894 to choose the President that would be inaugurated on 15 November 1894 for the first regular four year term, no elections needed to take place in the wake of Deodoro's resignation, neither by Congress, nor by direct popular ballot. Accordingly, Floriano Peixoto continued to serve as president for the remainder of the first presidential term, that is, until 15 November 1894. Because his interpretation of the Constitution was disputed by several political forces and his manner was regarded as also dictatorial, Floriano faced many revolts (including the [[Revolta da Armada|Second Revolt of the Armada]], that the Administration managed to defeat), and Floriano governed under state of siege, with the right of habeas corpus and several other constitutional rights suspended (in accordance with the emergency provisions of the Constitution), for most of his time in office. Floriano also took advantage of the emergency powers of the state of siege to further suppress remaining pockets of Monarchist sentiment in society and in Brazil's political life, and for this reason he has been dubbed the \"consolidator of the Republic\". In 1894 he was succeeded by Prudente de Morais, the first President to be elected by direct popular ballot under the permanent provisions of the Constitution and also the first civilian to hold office as President of Brazil.}}\n| None (''military'')\n| colspan=2 {{Party shading/None}}|{{center|{{small|''Vacant''}}}}\n| [[Vice President of Brazil|Vice President]]\n| [[Macei\u00f3]], [[Alagoas]]\n|-\n! style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"| 3\n| '''[[Prudente de Morais]]'''<br />{{small|(1841\u20131902)}}\n| [[File:Prudentedemorais.jpg|100px]]\n| [[1894 Brazilian general election|1894]]\n| 15 November 1894\n| 14 November 1898\n| [[Federal Republican Party|Federal Republican Party (PR Fed)]]\n| style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"|\n| [[Manuel Vitorino]]<br />{{small|([[:pt:Partido Republicano Federal|PR Fed]])}}\n| [[President of the Federal Senate (Brazil)|President]] of the [[Brazilian Senate|Federal Senate]]<br/> Senator for [[S\u00e3o Paulo]]<br/>Formerly, President of the \nConstituent Congress\n|[[Itu, S\u00e3o Paulo|Itu]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]]\n|-\n! style=\"background:{{Republican Party of S\u00e3o Paulo/meta/color}}; color:white\"| 4\n| '''[[Manuel Ferraz de Campos Sales|Campos Sales]]'''<br />{{small|(1841\u20131913)}}\n| [[File:Campos Sales.jpg|100px]]\n| [[1898 Brazilian presidential election|1898]]\n| 15 November 1898\n| 14 November 1902\n| [[Republican Party of S\u00e3o Paulo|S\u00e3o Paulo Republican Party (PRP)]] \n| style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"|\n| [[Francisco de Assis Rosa e Silva|Rosa e Silva]]<br />{{small|([[:pt:Partido Republicano Federal|PR Fed]])}}\n| Governor of [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]]\n| [[Campinas]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]]\n|-\n! style=\"background:{{Republican Party of S\u00e3o Paulo/meta/color}}; color:white\" rowspan=2| 5\n| rowspan=2|'''[[Francisco de Paula Rodrigues Alves|Rodrigues Alves]]'''<br />{{small|(1848\u20131919)}}\n| rowspan=2|[[File:Rodrigues Alves 3.jpg|100px]]\n| rowspan=2|[[1902 Brazilian presidential election|1902]]\n| rowspan=2|15 November 1902\n| rowspan=2|14 November 1906\n| rowspan=2|[[Republican Party of S\u00e3o Paulo|S\u00e3o Paulo Republican Party (PRP)]]\n| style=\"background:{{Mineiro Republican Party/meta/color}};\"|\n| [[Silviano Brand\u00e3o]]{{efn|Vice-President elect Silviano Brand\u00e3o died on 25 September 1902, before his inauguration.

On 9 July 1932 a revolution broke out in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, demanding the restoration of Constitutional Government. The revolution was defeated by the Government, but it led to Vargas finally making good on his promise to summon a Constituent Assembly. The 1933-1934 Constituent Assembly promulgated Brazil's new Constitution on 16 July 1934, and, under the Constitution's transitional provisions, the first President was to be elected by the Assembly, and subsequent presidents were to be elected by direct popular ballot. In accordance with those rules, on 17 July 1934 the Constituent Assembly voted for President and Vargas won the election. Accordingly, Vargas, who until then was Head of the Provisional Government, was sworn-in as President of the Republic on 20 July 1934, for a term of office that would last until the inauguration of a successor on 3 May 1938. However, on 10 November 1937, Vargas led a coup d'\u00e9tat and proclaimed the [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]] dictatorship, imposing a new Constitution that allowed him to rule by decree. Both the referendum provided in the 1937 Constitution that would have confirmed the adoption of the new constitutional legislation, and the elections provided in the 1937 Constitution were never held, under the pretext of a state of emergency. Accordingly, Vargas effectively extended his term of office indefinitely. State Governors were replaced by Federal Interventors appointed by the President of the Republic, and the Legislative chambers in both Federal and State level were dissolved. The new Legislative bodies created by the 1937 Constitution were never elected, due to the state of emergency that lasted until the end of the regime, and accordingly, during that whole period (1937-1945) the President of the Republic and the Interventors appointed to the several States discharged both Executive and Legislative powers, on a theoretically provisional, but effectively permanent, basis. Political parties were abolished, and opposition to the regime was suppressed. Thus, under the Estado Novo, President Vargas ruled Brazil as a dictator, until he was deposed by the military, in an insurrection led by Vargas's own Minister of War, on 29 October 1945.}}\n| 29 October 1945{{efn|By 1945, Vargas was under strong pressure from his own supporters to reform his authoritarian Estado Novo regime and to allow for the restoration of democratic freedoms in Brazil. On 28 February 1945, the dictator yielded to those mounting demands and signed a statute granting amnesty to his opponents, amending the 1937 Constitution and finally summoning elections for the Parliament it had established, that had never assembled. The elections were to be held on 2 December 1945. The Legislature would have the power to reform the Constitution; a further statute issued on 28 May 1945 also scheduled presidential elections for 2 December. On 2 October, the Superior Electoral Court ruled that the Parliament's powers to reform the Constitution would be unlimited. Political parties had been allowed to organize for the first time since 1937, and there was rising opposition to Vargas, in spite of the constraints still placed by the regime on freedom of expression. However, the political atmosphere was one of suspicion and insecurity, given Vargas' authoritarian record. There were fears that the elections could be cancelled, or that they would be manipulated by Vargas. In those circumstances, a group of Vargas' own Generals, led by the Minister of War, General Pedro Aur\u00e9lio de G\u00f3es Monteiro, turned against the dictator and deposed him from office in a sudden palace coup on 29 October 1945. The military then handed over power to the President of the Supreme Court, and safeguarded the freedom of the December 1945 elections, in which all parties were allowed to take part, from Communists to right-wing landowners; from Vargas's staunch opponents to his most loyal defenders. The deposed dictator himself (who still mustered strong popular support on account of the many social reforms implemented during his government, that created the Brazilian welfare state) was elected a Senator by the State of Rio Grande do Sul.

The political climate at the time of President Vargas' suicide was one of turmoil and instability. Vargas was a former dictator, who had been democratically elected President of Brazil in 1950 by direct popular ballot under the 1946 Constitution. In 1953, a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry accused the Government of illegally aiding newspaper owner Samuel Wainer to obtain loans from the State-owned bank Banco do Brasil in exchange for political support by his ''\u00daltima Hora'' newspaper. This accusation resulted in an impeachment petition against Vargas that reached the floor of the Chamber of Deputies, but the impeachment attempt failed, and the charges were accordingly never presented to the Senate, because the Chamber of Deputies rejected the impeachment petition in June 1954. The political atmosphere, however, remained very tense. Shortly afterwards, a criminal attempt against the life of leading Opposition politician Carlos Lacerda on 5 August 1954 (an episode in Rio de Janeiro known as the Tonelero Street shooting), that resulted in the death of his bodyguard, Air Force Major Rubens Vaz, led to accusations by the Opposition that the criminal act had been orchestrated by Vargas himself or by his aides, and in late August 1954 it was widely expected that a section of the military would soon intervene in politics once again, to depose President Vargas due to that incident. Indeed, investigations conducted by the Air Force Police found that Greg\u00f3rio Fortunato, a member of President Vargas' bodyguard, had orchestrated the criminal act against Carlos Lacerda that resulted in the death of Major Rubens Vaz. A Military Inquiry on the death of Major Rubens Vaz, conducted at Rio's Gale\u00e3o Air Force Base, also uncovered evidence of corruption involving both Fortunato and Manuel Vargas, the President's son. Although some claimed that the President's supporters had acted alone, without his knowledge, opponents of the President claimed that he had ordered Lacerda's assassination and that he was the mastermind behind the shooting. Those circumstances resulted in agitation in the military against the President, and, on the eve of his suicide, troops were already on the move to depose him, without the constitutional impeachment process, in what, therefore, would have been a military coup d'\u00e9tat. Having perceived that he had little support in the military to avoid a coup, and that his overthrow was imminent, Vargas, in a depressed state, committed suicide. He had presided over an emergency cabinet meeting in the early hours of 24 August 1954, and then retired to his bedroom and, a few hours later, shot himself in the chest, leaving behind a suicide note and a political testament. An ambulance was called to the Palace, but when it arrived Vargas was already dead. After his death, the military mobilization for a coup ceased, and there was an outpouring of popular feeling for the deceased President. In 1956 Fortunato was found guilty of the Tonelero Street crime, and sentenced to 25 years in prison. He was murdered by a fellow prison inmate in 1962. The involvement of President Vargas in the criminal act is still debated by historians.}}\n| [[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)|Brazilian Labour Party (PTB)]]\n| style=\"background:{{Social Progressive Party/meta/color}};\"|\n| [[Caf\u00e9 Filho]]<br />{{small|([[Social Progressive Party|PSP]])}}\n| Senator for [[Rio Grande do Sul]]<br/>and former [[President of Brazil|President of the Republic]]\n| S\u00e3o Borja, Rio Grande do Sul\n|-\n! style=\"background:{{Social Progressive Party/meta/color}};\"| 18\n| '''[[Jo\u00e3o Caf\u00e9 Filho]]'''<br />{{small|(1899\u20131970)}}\n| [[File:Caf\u00e9 Filho.jpg|100px]]\n| \u2014\n| {{small|''Acting President'' from 24 August 1954}}<br />3 September 1954{{efn|name=filho|Upon the suicide of President Get\u00falio Vargas on 24 August 1954 Vice President Caf\u00e9 Filho immediately assumed the powers and duties of the Presidency as Acting President, but the joint session of Congress required by the Federal Constitution for his swearing-in as President was only held on 3 September 1954, after the burial of the deceased President and a period of mourning. Accordingly, from 24 August 1954 until 3 September 1954, Caf\u00e9 Filho was Acting President of the Republic, and on 3 September 1954 he took the constitutional oath in the presence of Congress and became President.}}\n| {{small|''Under self-delcared incapacity from 8 November 1955<br/> and barred from resuming the powers of the presidency from 22 November 1955''{{efn|On 8 November 1955 President Caf\u00e9 Filho declared himself temporarily unable to govern for medical reasons. The President had gone to hospital on 3 November 1955, suffering from a heart condition. His self-declared incapacity led to the assumption of the powers of the presidency by Carlos Luz (who was President of the Chamber of Deputies) as Acting President. The President of the Chamber of Deputies was the constitutional successor of the President of the Republic because the Vice-Presidency was then vacant. However, Acting President Carlos Luz was seen as hostile to the inauguration of the then-president elect, Juscelino Kubitschek. Indeed, the results of the election were contested by the National Democratic Union (UDN), the party that had the second greatest share of the vote in the 1955 presidential election, and there was talk of a conspiracy to block the inauguration of the president-elect. Therefore, fearing that Carlos Luz would lead a coup to prevent the inauguration of the president-elect, a section of the military, led by the Army Minister himself (Marshal Henrique Teixeira Lott), in what they called a ''preventive counter-coup'', deposed Carlos Luz from the post of acting president on 11 November, and installed Senator Nereu Ramos, the Vice President of the Senate, as Acting President of the Republic in his stead. Faced with the actions of the military, both Houses of Congress summarily voted, also on 11 November 1955, to back Marshal Lott's preventive counter coup, by recognizing an emergency, declaring Luz impeded from acting as President, and confirming Nereu Ramos as Acting President. Carlos Luz attempted to resist his toppling, by boarding the Navy ship ''Tamandar\u00e9'' in the company of leading UDN politicians, and heading to the port of Santos, in the hope of receiving the support of J\u00e2nio Quadros, the Governor of S\u00e3o Paulo State, and of the military stationed in that State. However, the ''Tamandar\u00e9'' received news from S\u00e3o Paulo that such support would not be forthcoming, and Luz therefore ordered the ship to sail back to Rio de Janeiro, where he surrendered on 13 November. Also on 13 November 1955, Acting President Nereu Ramos visited President Caf\u00e9 Filho in hospital, and assured him that he would only continue serving as Acting President until the President recovered. However, Marshal Lott and the other leaders of the ''11 of November movement'' decided to block the resumption of the powers of the presidency by Caf\u00e9 Filho, because they suspected that the President, too, was involved in the conspiracy to prevent the inauguration of the president-elect. Upon being released from hospital, on 21 November, Caf\u00e9 Filho sent a message to the Acting President and to both Houses of Congress informing them that he had recovered from his illness, and therefore was resuming the powers and duties of the Presidency of the Republic. His resumption of those powers and duties, however, was swiftly blocked by the military: army tanks surrounded the Catete Palace (the seat of the presidency), to prevent Caf\u00e9 Filho from reaching the Presidential Palace, where Nereu Ramos remained. Several other points in the capital were also surrounded by military forces. Caf\u00e9 Filho therefore returned to his private residence, that was soon also surrounded by tanks, and the President was prevented from leaving his home. Given that situation, both Houses of Congress summarily voted, on 21 and 22 November 1955, to declare that the President's impediment persisted, that he therefore could not resume the powers and duties of the Presidency until the Congress resolved otherwise, and that acorrdingly, Senator Nereu Ramos should continue as Acting President, as per the congressional resolutions of 11 November. Because this \"solution\" was employed, of the Houses of Congress declaring, on 21 and 22 November, that they considered that Caf\u00e9 Filho could not for the time being resume the powers and duties of the office, he was never formally removed from the office, and there was no impeachment process. Had there been an impeachment process, it would have required a formal accusation against the President, and he would have had the chance to defend himself and to stand trial before the Senate. However, impeachment proceedings were never initiated against Caf\u00e9 Filho, and instead he was simply prevented from resuming his powers and duties on the basis of the congressional resolutions of 21 and 22 November 1955. Although for all practical purposes Caf\u00e9 Filho had effectively been deposed, and it was universally understood that he would never be allowed to resume the powers of the presidency, neither Congress nor the military went as far as declaring the presidential office vacant, and therefore, formally, Caf\u00e9 Filho was not overthrown, but simply barred from resuming the powers of the presidency. While technically Caf\u00e9 Filho was never removed from office, he was thus prevented from resuming the powers and duties of the presidency until the end of his term and the inauguration of Kubitschek on 31 January 1956, and Nereu Ramos continued seving as Acting President until then. Caf\u00e9 Filho's lawyers presented two petitions on his behalf to the Supreme Court also on 22 November 1955: one of habeas corpus, to restore his freedom of movement, and one of writ of mandamus, seeking an injunction from the Court to allow the President to resume his powers and duties. A statute was passed by Congress and signed into law by Acting President Ramos on 25 November declaring a state of siege (a form of martial law prescribed by the emergency provisions of the Constitution, that were then put in operation). On 14 December 1955, the Supreme Federal Court decided not to interfere in the political question, by ruling, regarding the writ of mandamus petition, that it could not decide the case while the state of siege declared by law persisted. As for the habeas corpus petition, it was declared moot on 21 December 1955, after Acting President Ramos informed the Court that Caf\u00e9 Filho's freedom of movement had been restored, without prejudice to the continuation of his impediment. Only on 7 November 1956, long after Caf\u00e9 Filho's term had ended, the Court would resume its deliberation on the writ of mandamus, to dispose of the case and close it, by recognizing that the petition had now been rendered moot, due to the termination of Caf\u00e9 Filho's term in office.}}}}<br />30 January 1956\n| [[Social Progressive Party|Social Progressive Party (PSP)]]\n| colspan=2 {{Party shading/None}}|{{center|{{small|''Vacant''}}}}\n| [[Vice President of Brazil|Vice President]]\n| [[Natal, Brazil|Natal]], [[Rio Grande do Norte]]\n|-\n! style=\"background:{{Brazilian Social Democratic Party/meta/color}}; color:white;\"| 19\n| '''[[Carlos Luz]]'''<br />{{small|(1894\u20131961)}}<br />{{small|''Acting President''<br />for Caf\u00e9 Filho}}\n| [[File:Carlos Luz Oficial.jpg|100px]]\n| \u2014\n| 8 November 1955\n| 11 November 1955 \n| [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945\u201365)|Social Democratic Party (PSD)]]\n| colspan=2 {{Party shading/None}}|{{center|{{small|''Vacant''}}}}\n| President of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|Chamber of Deputies]]<br/>Federal Deputy for [[Minas Gerais]]\n| [[Tr\u00eas Cora\u00e7\u00f5es]], Minas Gerais\n|-\n! style=\"background:{{Brazilian Social Democratic Party/meta/color}}; color:white;\"| 20\n| '''[[Nereu Ramos]]'''<br />{{small|(1888\u20131958)}}<br />{{small|''Acting President''}}{{efn|Nereu Ramos was the Vice President of the Federal Senate (the office of President of the Senate, then vested in the Vice-Presidency of the Republic, was vacant, and thus Ramos, as Vice President of the Senate, acted as the Senate's presiding officer pro tempore). Summoned by the Minister of the Army, Henrique Teixeira Lott, who led the coup to overthrow Acting President Carlos Luz, Senator Nereu Ramos assumed the powers of the presidency of the Republic after Luz's deposition, on 11 November 1955 (as detailed above). After President Caf\u00e9 Filho was impeded from resuming the powers and duties of the office on 21 and 22 November 1955, Ramos continued serving as Acting President until the end of the presidential term and the inauguration of President-elect Kubitschek. Although technically Carlos Luz and Nereu Ramos were only acting presidents, due to the critical circumstances surrounding their Administrations, they are usually included in the lists of presidents of Brazil, and are even included in the official gallery of presidents published by the Presidency of Brazil. Furthermore, Nereu Ramos had an official photograph of himself as president made, and he made use of the Presidential Sash, the insignia reserved for the President of the Republic alone. As for the actions of the military and of Congress that deposed Acting President Calos Luz, prevented President Caf\u00e9 Filho from resuming the discharge of the powers of the presidency, installed and maintained Senator Nereu Ramos as Acting President until the inauguration of President-elect Kubitschek, those actions were in clear violation of the Constitution, although the backing of Congress helped to increase the appearance of legitimacy to the acts of the military. In spite of being unconstitutional, most historians today agree that those actions, led by Marshal Henrique Lott, had indeed the aim of securing the transfer of power according to the result of the 1955 presidential election; that there was indeed a conspiracy to prevent the inauguration of Kubitschek; and that the democratic result of the 1955 elections would not have been respected if not for the actions of Lott's preventive counter coup.}}\n| [[File:Presidente Nereu Ramos.jpg|100px]]\n| \u2014\n| 11 November 1955\n| 30 January 1956\n| [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945\u201365)|Social Democratic Party (PSD)]]\n| colspan=2 {{Party shading/None}}|{{center|{{small|''Vacant''}}}}\n| Vice President of the [[Brazilian Senate|Federal Senate]]<br/>Senator for [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]\n| [[Lages]], [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]\n|-\n! style=\"background:{{Brazilian Social Democratic Party/meta/color}}; color:white;\"| 21\n| '''[[Juscelino Kubitschek]]'''<br />{{small|(1902\u20131976)}}\n| [[File:Juscelino.jpg|100px]]\n| [[1955 Brazilian presidential election|1955]]\n| 31 January 1956\n| 30 January 1961\n| [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945\u201365)|Social Democratic Party (PSD)]]\n| rowspan=2 style=\"background:{{Brazilian Labour Party (historical)/meta/color}}; color:white;\"|\n| rowspan=2|[[Jo\u00e3o Goulart]]<br />{{small|([[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)|PTB]])}}\n| Governor of [[Minas Gerais]]\n| [[Diamantina, Minas Gerais]]\n|-\n! style=\"background:{{National Labour Party (Brazil)/meta/color}}; color:white;\"| 22\n| '''[[J\u00e2nio Quadros]]'''<br />{{small|(1917\u20131992)}}\n| [[File:Janio Quadros.png|100px]]\n| [[1960 Brazilian presidential election|1960]]\n| 31 January 1961\n| 25 August 1961{{efn|President J\u00e2nio Quadros resigned from office on 25 August 1961. There were no political reasons for President Quadros' sudden and abrupt resignation, that took the country and the political establishment by surprise. Some aides and close advisors of the former President have postulated that Quadros was heavily drunk when he wrote and ordered the delivery to Congress of his letter of resignation. Others suggest that Quadros imagined that Congress would not want his Vice-President, Jo\u00e3o Goulart, as president, and that the legislature would therefore ask him to reconsider his resignation, and would agree to grant him extraordinary powers. Several historians postulate that both things may be true: Quadros was drunk, and in that state he imagined that his resignation would not be accepted and would result in him being able to bargain for extraordinary powers. However, the Brazilian Constitution did not require that the President's resignation be accepted by Congress or by any authority; instead the resignation was deemed to be a unilateral act, that became effective as soon as Congress received the President's written instrument of resignation. Accordingly, once the President of Congress received the Quadros' letter of resignation, a joint session of Congress was convened, the resignation letter was simply read and entered into the records of Congress, and the resignation was deemed effective, and as a result the President of Congress immediately proceeded to declare that Quadros had vacated the Presidency. Afterwards, when asked why he had resigned from office, Quadros denied both the claims of authoritarian intentions and the accounts that he was drunk, but simply stated that he had done it because he wanted to, giving no further reasons for his action.

While the Vice President was still abroad, there was an attempt on the part of the Vice President's opponents, who controlled Congress, to prevent him from being inaugurated, but that movement failed, due to resistance by the Governor of the State Rio Grande do Sul and a split in the military. However, Congress only allowed the inauguration of Goulart to proceed after a compromise was reached, whereby a Constitutional Amendment severely limiting the powers of the presidency was passed on 2 September 1961. Under that Constitutional Amendment, the presidential executive, that had existed since the proclamation of the Republic, was abolished and replaced with a parliamentary system, in which a Prime Minister was the head of government and the President of the Republic retained only the role of head of state. The Amendment however stipulated that the constitutional change would only become permanent if confirmed by the people in a referendum. On 6 January 1963 that referendum was held, and a majority of the voters rejected the Amendment, backing the restoration of the presidential Executive instead. According to the result of the referendum, on 23 January 1963 a new Constitutional Amendment was promulgated, repealing the 1961 Amendment and re-establishing the presidential Executive as it existed immediately prior to that Amendment. Thus, from 7 September 1961 until 23 January 1963 President Goulart served as head of State only, in a parliamentary system of Government, and, from 23 January 1963 onwards, he served as both head of state and head of government.}}\n| 1 April 1964{{efn|Goulart was deposed by the military coup of 1964, that marked the beginning of the 1964\u20131985 military regime.}}\n| [[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)|Brazilian Labour Party (PTB)]]\n| colspan=2 {{Party shading/None}}|{{center|{{small|''Vacant''}}}}\n| [[Vice President of Brazil|Vice President]]\n| S\u00e3o Borja, Rio Grande do Sul\n|}\n\n==Military Regime (1964\u20131985)==\n{{Main|Brazilian military regime}}\n\n{{legend2|{{Brazilian Social Democratic Party/meta/color}}|[[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945\u201365)|Social Democratic Party]] ''(abolished in 1965)''|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n;<nowiki>Parties abolished, except for two parties:</nowiki>\n{{legend2|{{National Renewal Alliance/meta/color}}|[[National Renewal Alliance]] (later [[Democratic Social Party]])|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|{{Brazilian Democratic Movement Party/meta/color}}|[[Brazilian Democratic Movement]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n! {{Abbr|No.|Number}}\n!

Moura Andrade then declared Ranieri Mazzilli (who then was the President of the Chamber of Deputies and the first person in the presidential line of succession) to have become President of the Republic. Accordingly, Mazzilli took charge of the Presidency, but, in spite of Moura Andrade's bold statement declaring Mazzilli President, Mazzilli only took office as Acting President: he never took the presidential oath and, during his brief term in office, he issued his acts as \"The President of the Chamber of Deputies, acting in the office of President of the Republic\". The 1946 Constitution, then in force, authorized a Vice-President to succeed to the Presidency if the office of President became vacant, but it only authorized the President of the Chamber of Deputies and the other officers in the line of succession to serve as Acting President, and, in the case of a double vacancy of the Presidency and of the Vice-Presidency, it required new presidential elections to be summoned (direct elections by popular ballot if the second vacancy took place in the first half of the presidential term; indirect elections by Congress if the second vacancy occurred in the second half of the presidential term). Mindful of the fact that the elected President for the 1961-1966 term was Quadros (who had resigned), succeeded as President by Goulart, his Vice-President (who was deposed by the 1964 military coup), and that he was only the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Mazzilli limited his actions to that of a caretaker Acting President, pending the holding of elections. The norms that would have governed those elections, however, were altered by continuing acts of interference from the Armed Forces that had ejected Goulart from office: on 9 April 1964, a body known as the ''Supreme Command of the Revolution'', composed of the leaders of the military coup (the commanders of the three branches of the Armed Forces), issued an ''Institutional Act'' summoning the National Congress to elect a new President in 48 hours. The military then put forward the name of Marshal Castelo Branco, and he was elected by Congress as planned.

The possibility of a civilian, even a conservative one, assuming the powers of the presidency was seen as detrimental to the continuity of the military regime. In the initial stage of the President's disease, the junta hoped that he would recover. Subsequently, realizing that the President's condition was irreversible, and that the prolonged continuity of a triumvirate was detrimental to the regime and to its image, the military junta issued an institutional act on 14 October 1969 removing the incapacitated President and the Vice President from office and summoning Congress to elect a new President and Vice President. The military elite that controlled the regime then selected General Em\u00edlio Garrastazu M\u00e9dici to be ARENA's candidate, and his name was rubber-stamped by Congress. The junta remained in place until the new President was sworn-in.

Initially, there was hope that the President-elect would recover and take office, but he developed several complications and infections, and underwent several other operations, ultimately resulting in his death. Upon Neves's death on 21 April 1985, Acting President Sarney succeeded to the presidency. On the first anniversary of Neves's death a statute was signed into Law (federal law 7.465/1986), establishing that Tancredo Neves \"elected but not sworn-in due to his death\" should be included in the gallery of the presidents of Brazil \"for all legal purposes\".}}''\n<br />\n| [[Brazilian Democratic Movement|Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB)]]\n| style=\"background:{{Brazilian Democratic Movement Party/meta/color}};\"|\n| [[Jos\u00e9 Sarney]]<br />{{small|([[Brazilian Democratic Movement|PMDB]])}}\n| Governor of [[Minas Gerais]]\n| [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o del Rey]], Minas Gerais\n|-\n! style=\"background:{{Brazilian Democratic Movement Party/meta/color}}; color:white;\"| 31\n| '''[[Jos\u00e9 Sarney]]'''<br />{{small|(1930\u2013)}}\n| [[File:Foto Oficial Sarney EBC.jpg|100px]]\n| \u2014\n| {{small|''Acting President from 15 March 1985''}}<br />21 April 1985 \n| 14 March 1990\n| [[Brazilian Democratic Movement|Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB)]]\n| colspan=2 {{Party shading/None}}|{{center|{{small|''Vacant''}}}}\n| [[Vice President of Brazil|Vice President]]\n| [[Pinheiro, Maranh\u00e3o]]\n|-\n! style=\"background:{{Party of the National Reconstruction/meta/color}}; color:white;\"| 32\n| '''[[Fernando Collor de Mello]]'''<br />{{small|(1949\u2013)}}\n| [[File:Fernando Collor 1992 B&W.jpg|100px]]\n| [[1989 Brazilian presidential election|1989]]\n| 15 March 1990\n| {{small|''Powers and duties suspended from 2 October 1992''}}<br />29 December 1992{{efn|President Collor was impeached on corruption charges.

On 2 October 1992, upon receiving the formal writ of summons notifying him that he was now a defendant in the impeachment trial that the Senate would conduct, President Collor was automatically suspended from office for 180 days as provided in the Constitution of Brazil and Vice President Itamar Franco became Acting President. On 29 December 1992, on the final day of his trial of impeachment before the Federal Senate, President Collor resigned the presidency, in an attempt to stop the process. The Senate's session as a Court of Impeachment was suspended and two successive joint sessions of Congress were held, one shortly after the other: in the first joint session, President Collor's resignation letter was formally read before Congress by its First Secretary and entered the congressional record, and the presidential resignation thereby took legal effect, resulting in the formal declaration by the President of Congress to the assembled joint session, that the presidency of the Republic was vacant, and that, as a result of that vacancy, Acting President Franco would be summoned at once, as Collor's legal successor, to take the constitutional oath and assume the Presidency; in the second joint session of Congress, Acting President Itamar Franco was accordingly sworn-in as President, as required by the Constitution. Later in the same day, the Senate resumed its sitting as a Court of Impeachment, and it decided that the President's resignation after the start of the trial could not stop the process, given that the determination of the former President's guilt or innocence was relevant for the purposes of imposing on him the penalty of disqualification from holding public office for eight years. Accordingly, the trial of impeachment continued in spite of Collor's resignation and, in the early hours of 30 December 1992 he was found guilty of the charges, by the required majority of more than two thirds of the members of the Senate. The penalty of removal from office was declared moot as Collor had already resigned, but as a result of his conviction by the Senate he was disqualified for holding public office for eight years. The Senate's sentence in the trial of impeachment, imposing upon Collor the said penalty, was pronounced on 30 December 1992 and published in the Official Journal on 31 December 1992.

The unprecedented military coup against a prime minister appointed by the emperor and who enjoyed the confidence of the Chamber of Deputies quickly escalated to the proclamation of the republic on that same date; thus, Emperor Pedro II of Brazil was deposed by Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca and the monarchy was declared abolished. The constitution then in force ceased to operate, and the Empire of Brazil, a unitary state, was replaced with a federal republic, each province of the empire becoming a state. Until the organization of the republic's constitutional order, however, the central Government appointed the governments of the several States. The imperial Parliament (the General Assembly) was dissolved, and Deodoro formed a provisional government. Deodoro as head of the provisional government could appoint and dismiss the other members of that government, and discharged by decree absolute legislative and executive powers. The provisional government was in effect a dictatorship, and remaining monarchist sentiment in society was repressed, as the government and the army were committed to the consolidation of the recently declared republic. The imperial family and their descendants were banished from the country by decree of the provisional government, and the dynasty's exile was only revoked in 1920. On 15 January 1890 Deodoro, as head of the Provisional Government, assumed for himself the unique military rank of [[Generalissimo]] of Land and Sea. In 1890 elections for a constituent congress were held, but the congress (made up of a senate with equal representation of the newly declared states and of a Chamber of Deputies with delegations proportional to the size of the population of each State) was required to adopt a constitution that conformed to the republican system of government and to the federal model of state. Congress assembled in November 1890 and a draft constitution, prepared by a committee of republican jurists and politicians appointed by the Provisional Government, was submitted to Congress by the head of the provisional government, and formed the basis for the congressional deliberations. The Constitution was promulgated by Congress on 24 February 1891. It confirmed the abolition of the parliamentary system of government and created a presidential Executive, widely based on the model of the United States of America. Presidents and vice-presidents were to be elected for 4 years, without the possibility of re-election, by direct popular ballot, but for the first presidential term, Congress was to conduct the election immediately after the adoption of the constitution. Subsequent presidents were to be elected on 1 March and inaugurated on 15 November, starting in the year 1894. Accordingly, under those transitional rules, on 25 February 1891, the day after the adoption of the constitution, Congress voted for president and vice-president, and the then head of the provisional government, Generalissimo Deodoro da Fonseca, was elected to become the nation's first President. The voting for vice-president took place immediately after the counting of the votes for President, and Marshal Floriano Peixoto was chosen by Congress to be the first vice-president. The swearing in of Deodoro da Fonseca and Floriano Peixoto as president and vice-president, respectively, took place on the following day, 26 February 1891, and that inauguration marked the termination of the Provisional Government.}}\n| 23 November 1891 {{efn|In a coup d'\u00e9tat on 3 November 1891, President Deodoro da Fonseca shut down the National Congress and ruled by decree for a few weeks, attempting to suspend the Constitution and to establish a dictatorial regime in the fashion of the Spanish American ''[[caudillos]]''. There was a reaction by the Brazilian Navy against Deodoro's coup (the [[Revolta da Armada|First Revolt of the Armada]]) and Deodoro was forced to resign the presidency. Deodoro was effectively deposed by the forces loyal to the Constitution in a counter-coup d'\u00e9tat, but because he yielded to the demands of the Navy and agreed to resign the presidency, neither the constitutional impeachment process nor a formal overthrow without impeachment (that would also have been a violation of the Constitution, this time by the counter-coup forces) took place, and instead Deodoro's removal from office was formalized as a simple resignation. Many officers in the Brazilian Navy were still monarchists, opposed Deodoro, and only reluctantly accepted the newly created Republic, but were unwilling to see it be transformed from a constitutional state into a dictatorship. Upon Deodoro's resignation on 23 November 1891, Vice-President Floriano Peixoto succeeded to the presidency and reversed Deodoro's coup. The constitutional legal order was restored, Deodoro's dissolution of Congress was deemed null and void, and Deodoro's other acts since the coup were similarly declared invalid.}}\n| None (''military'')\n| style=\"background:gray;\"|\n| [[Floriano Peixoto]]\n| President of the [[Rio Grande do Sul|S\u00e3o Pedro do Rio Grande do Sul]] [[Provinces of Brazil|Province]]\n| [[Marechal Deodoro, Alagoas|Cidade das Alagoas]], [[Alagoas]]\n|-\n! style=\"background:gray; color:white;\"| 2\n| '''[[Floriano Peixoto]]'''<br />{{small|(1839\u20131895)}}\n| [[File:Floriano Peixoto (1891).jpg|100px]]\n| \u2014\n| 23 November 1891\n| 14 November 1894 {{efn|Marshal of the Army Floriano Peixoto, Deodoro's Vice-President, succeeded to the Presidency upon President Manuel Deodoro da Fonseca's resignation. The Constitution then in force stipulated that, whenever the Presidency became vacant during the first half of presidential term, new elections should be summoned at once, and the Vice-President should serve as President only until the inauguration of a new elected President. Deodoro had resigned during the first half of his presidential term (he had been sworn-in as President on 26 February 1891 to serve until 15 November 1894 and had resigned the office on 23 November 1891), but the new President, Floriano Peixoto, refused to summon new elections, arguing that the constitutional provision requiring new elections should only apply if the Presidency had been vacated during the first half of the presidential term by a President elected by direct popular ballot under the permanent provisions of the Constitution. Floriano held that, because Deodoro and himself had been respectively elected President and Vice-President by the Constituent Congress under the transitional provisions of the Constitution, and because the Constitution directed that the first elections by direct popular ballot should be held on 1 March 1894 to choose the President that would be inaugurated on 15 November 1894 for the first regular four year term, no elections needed to take place in the wake of Deodoro's resignation, neither by Congress, nor by direct popular ballot. Accordingly, Floriano Peixoto continued to serve as president for the remainder of the first presidential term, that is, until 15 November 1894. Because his interpretation of the Constitution was disputed by several political forces and his manner was regarded as also dictatorial, Floriano faced many revolts (including the [[Revolta da Armada|Second Revolt of the Armada]], that the Administration managed to defeat), and Floriano governed under state of siege, with the right of habeas corpus and several other constitutional rights suspended (in accordance with the emergency provisions of the Constitution), for most of his time in office. Floriano also took advantage of the emergency powers of the state of siege to further suppress remaining pockets of Monarchist sentiment in society and in Brazil's political life, and for this reason he has been dubbed the \"consolidator of the Republic\". In 1894 he was succeeded by Prudente de Morais, the first President to be elected by direct popular ballot under the permanent provisions of the Constitution and also the first civilian to hold office as President of Brazil.}}\n| None (''military'')\n| colspan=2 {{Party shading/None}}|{{center|{{small|''Vacant''}}}}\n| [[Vice President of Brazil|Vice President]]\n| [[Macei\u00f3]], [[Alagoas]]\n|-\n! style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"| 3\n| '''[[Prudente de Morais]]'''<br />{{small|(1841\u20131902)}}\n| [[File:Prudentedemorais.jpg|100px]]\n| [[1894 Brazilian general election|1894]]\n| 15 November 1894\n| 14 November 1898\n| [[Federal Republican Party|Federal Republican Party (PR Fed)]]\n| style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"|\n| [[Manuel Vitorino]]<br />{{small|([[:pt:Partido Republicano Federal|PR Fed]])}}\n| [[President of the Federal Senate (Brazil)|President]] of the [[Brazilian Senate|Federal Senate]]<br/> Senator for [[S\u00e3o Paulo]]<br/>Formerly, President of the \nConstituent Congress\n|[[Itu, S\u00e3o Paulo|Itu]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]]\n|-\n! style=\"background:{{Republican Party of S\u00e3o Paulo/meta/color}}; color:white\"| 4\n| '''[[Manuel Ferraz de Campos Sales|Campos Sales]]'''<br />{{small|(1841\u20131913)}}\n| [[File:Campos Sales.jpg|100px]]\n| [[1898 Brazilian presidential election|1898]]\n| 15 November 1898\n| 14 November 1902\n| [[Republican Party of S\u00e3o Paulo|S\u00e3o Paulo Republican Party (PRP)]] \n| style=\"background:#FFFFCC;\"|\n| [[Francisco de Assis Rosa e Silva|Rosa e Silva]]<br />{{small|([[:pt:Partido Republicano Federal|PR Fed]])}}\n| Governor of [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]]\n| [[Campinas]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]]\n|-\n! style=\"background:{{Republican Party of S\u00e3o Paulo/meta/color}}; color:white\" rowspan=2| 5\n| rowspan=2|'''[[Francisco de Paula Rodrigues Alves|Rodrigues Alves]]'''<br />{{small|(1848\u20131919)}}\n| rowspan=2|[[File:Rodrigues Alves 3.jpg|100px]]\n| rowspan=2|[[1902 Brazilian presidential election|1902]]\n| rowspan=2|15 November 1902\n| rowspan=2|14 November 1906\n| rowspan=2|[[Republican Party of S\u00e3o Paulo|S\u00e3o Paulo Republican Party (PRP)]]\n| style=\"background:{{Mineiro Republican Party/meta/color}};\"|\n| [[Silviano Brand\u00e3o]]{{efn|Vice-President elect Silviano Brand\u00e3o died on 25 September 1902, before his inauguration.

On 9 July 1932 a revolution broke out in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, demanding the restoration of Constitutional Government. The revolution was defeated by the Government, but it led to Vargas finally making good on his promise to summon a Constituent Assembly. The 1933-1934 Constituent Assembly promulgated Brazil's new Constitution on 16 July 1934, and, under the Constitution's transitional provisions, the first President was to be elected by the Assembly, and subsequent presidents were to be elected by direct popular ballot. In accordance with those rules, on 17 July 1934 the Constituent Assembly voted for President and Vargas won the election. Accordingly, Vargas, who until then was Head of the Provisional Government, was sworn-in as President of the Republic on 20 July 1934, for a term of office that would last until the inauguration of a successor on 3 May 1938. However, on 10 November 1937, Vargas led a coup d'\u00e9tat and proclaimed the [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]] dictatorship, imposing a new Constitution that allowed him to rule by decree. Both the referendum provided in the 1937 Constitution that would have confirmed the adoption of the new constitutional legislation, and the elections provided in the 1937 Constitution were never held, under the pretext of a state of emergency. Accordingly, Vargas effectively extended his term of office indefinitely. State Governors were replaced by Federal Interventors appointed by the President of the Republic, and the Legislative chambers in both Federal and State level were dissolved. The new Legislative bodies created by the 1937 Constitution were never elected, due to the state of emergency that lasted until the end of the regime, and accordingly, during that whole period (1937-1945) the President of the Republic and the Interventors appointed to the several States discharged both Executive and Legislative powers, on a theoretically provisional, but effectively permanent, basis. Political parties were abolished, and opposition to the regime was suppressed. Thus, under the Estado Novo, President Vargas ruled Brazil as a dictator, until he was deposed by the military, in an insurrection led by Vargas's own Minister of War, on 29 October 1945.}}\n| 29 October 1945{{efn|By 1945, Vargas was under strong pressure from his own supporters to reform his authoritarian Estado Novo regime and to allow for the restoration of democratic freedoms in Brazil. On 28 February 1945, the dictator yielded to those mounting demands and signed a statute granting amnesty to his opponents, amending the 1937 Constitution and finally summoning elections for the Parliament it had established, that had never assembled. The elections were to be held on 2 December 1945. The Legislature would have the power to reform the Constitution; a further statute issued on 28 May 1945 also scheduled presidential elections for 2 December. On 2 October, the Superior Electoral Court ruled that the Parliament's powers to reform the Constitution would be unlimited. Political parties had been allowed to organize for the first time since 1937, and there was rising opposition to Vargas, in spite of the constraints still placed by the regime on freedom of expression. However, the political atmosphere was one of suspicion and insecurity, given Vargas' authoritarian record. There were fears that the elections could be cancelled, or that they would be manipulated by Vargas. In those circumstances, a group of Vargas' own Generals, led by the Minister of War, General Pedro Aur\u00e9lio de G\u00f3es Monteiro, turned against the dictator and deposed him from office in a sudden palace coup on 29 October 1945. The military then handed over power to the President of the Supreme Court, and safeguarded the freedom of the December 1945 elections, in which all parties were allowed to take part, from Communists to right-wing landowners; from Vargas's staunch opponents to his most loyal defenders. The deposed dictator himself (who still mustered strong popular support on account of the many social reforms implemented during his government, that created the Brazilian welfare state) was elected a Senator by the State of Rio Grande do Sul.

The political climate at the time of President Vargas' suicide was one of turmoil and instability. Vargas was a former dictator, who had been democratically elected President of Brazil in 1950 by direct popular ballot under the 1946 Constitution. In 1953, a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry accused the Government of illegally aiding newspaper owner Samuel Wainer to obtain loans from the State-owned bank Banco do Brasil in exchange for political support by his ''\u00daltima Hora'' newspaper. This accusation resulted in an impeachment petition against Vargas that reached the floor of the Chamber of Deputies, but the impeachment attempt failed, and the charges were accordingly never presented to the Senate, because the Chamber of Deputies rejected the impeachment petition in June 1954. The political atmosphere, however, remained very tense. Shortly afterwards, a criminal attempt against the life of leading Opposition politician Carlos Lacerda on 5 August 1954 (an episode in Rio de Janeiro known as the Tonelero Street shooting), that resulted in the death of his bodyguard, Air Force Major Rubens Vaz, led to accusations by the Opposition that the criminal act had been orchestrated by Vargas himself or by his aides, and in late August 1954 it was widely expected that a section of the military would soon intervene in politics once again, to depose President Vargas due to that incident. Indeed, investigations conducted by the Air Force Police found that Greg\u00f3rio Fortunato, a member of President Vargas' bodyguard, had orchestrated the criminal act against Carlos Lacerda that resulted in the death of Major Rubens Vaz. A Military Inquiry on the death of Major Rubens Vaz, conducted at Rio's Gale\u00e3o Air Force Base, also uncovered evidence of corruption involving both Fortunato and Manuel Vargas, the President's son. Although some claimed that the President's supporters had acted alone, without his knowledge, opponents of the President claimed that he had ordered Lacerda's assassination and that he was the mastermind behind the shooting. Those circumstances resulted in agitation in the military against the President, and, on the eve of his suicide, troops were already on the move to depose him, without the constitutional impeachment process, in what, therefore, would have been a military coup d'\u00e9tat. Having perceived that he had little support in the military to avoid a coup, and that his overthrow was imminent, Vargas, in a depressed state, committed suicide. He had presided over an emergency cabinet meeting in the early hours of 24 August 1954, and then retired to his bedroom and, a few hours later, shot himself in the chest, leaving behind a suicide note and a political testament. An ambulance was called to the Palace, but when it arrived Vargas was already dead. After his death, the military mobilization for a coup ceased, and there was an outpouring of popular feeling for the deceased President. In 1956 Fortunato was found guilty of the Tonelero Street crime, and sentenced to 25 years in prison. He was murdered by a fellow prison inmate in 1962. The involvement of President Vargas in the criminal act is still debated by historians.}}\n| [[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)|Brazilian Labour Party (PTB)]]\n| style=\"background:{{Social Progressive Party/meta/color}};\"|\n| [[Caf\u00e9 Filho]]<br />{{small|([[Social Progressive Party|PSP]])}}\n| Senator for [[Rio Grande do Sul]]<br/>and former [[President of Brazil|President of the Republic]]\n| S\u00e3o Borja, Rio Grande do Sul\n|-\n! style=\"background:{{Social Progressive Party/meta/color}};\"| 18\n| '''[[Jo\u00e3o Caf\u00e9 Filho]]'''<br />{{small|(1899\u20131970)}}\n| [[File:Caf\u00e9 Filho.jpg|100px]]\n| \u2014\n| {{small|''Acting President'' from 24 August 1954}}<br />3 September 1954{{efn|name=filho|Upon the suicide of President Get\u00falio Vargas on 24 August 1954 Vice President Caf\u00e9 Filho immediately assumed the powers and duties of the Presidency as Acting President, but the joint session of Congress required by the Federal Constitution for his swearing-in as President was only held on 3 September 1954, after the burial of the deceased President and a period of mourning. Accordingly, from 24 August 1954 until 3 September 1954, Caf\u00e9 Filho was Acting President of the Republic, and on 3 September 1954 he took the constitutional oath in the presence of Congress and became President.}}\n| {{small|''Under self-delcared incapacity from 8 November 1955<br/> and barred from resuming the powers of the presidency from 22 November 1955''{{efn|On 8 November 1955 President Caf\u00e9 Filho declared himself temporarily unable to govern for medical reasons. The President had gone to hospital on 3 November 1955, suffering from a heart condition. His self-declared incapacity led to the assumption of the powers of the presidency by Carlos Luz (who was President of the Chamber of Deputies) as Acting President. The President of the Chamber of Deputies was the constitutional successor of the President of the Republic because the Vice-Presidency was then vacant. However, Acting President Carlos Luz was seen as hostile to the inauguration of the then-president elect, Juscelino Kubitschek. Indeed, the results of the election were contested by the National Democratic Union (UDN), the party that had the second greatest share of the vote in the 1955 presidential election, and there was talk of a conspiracy to block the inauguration of the president-elect. Therefore, fearing that Carlos Luz would lead a coup to prevent the inauguration of the president-elect, a section of the military, led by the Army Minister himself (Marshal Henrique Teixeira Lott), in what they called a ''preventive counter-coup'', deposed Carlos Luz from the post of acting president on 11 November, and installed Senator Nereu Ramos, the Vice President of the Senate, as Acting President of the Republic in his stead. Faced with the actions of the military, both Houses of Congress summarily voted, also on 11 November 1955, to back Marshal Lott's preventive counter coup, by recognizing an emergency, declaring Luz impeded from acting as President, and confirming Nereu Ramos as Acting President. Carlos Luz attempted to resist his toppling, by boarding the Navy ship ''Tamandar\u00e9'' in the company of leading UDN politicians, and heading to the port of Santos, in the hope of receiving the support of J\u00e2nio Quadros, the Governor of S\u00e3o Paulo State, and of the military stationed in that State. However, the ''Tamandar\u00e9'' received news from S\u00e3o Paulo that such support would not be forthcoming, and Luz therefore ordered the ship to sail back to Rio de Janeiro, where he surrendered on 13 November. Also on 13 November 1955, Acting President Nereu Ramos visited President Caf\u00e9 Filho in hospital, and assured him that he would only continue serving as Acting President until the President recovered. However, Marshal Lott and the other leaders of the ''11 of November movement'' decided to block the resumption of the powers of the presidency by Caf\u00e9 Filho, because they suspected that the President, too, was involved in the conspiracy to prevent the inauguration of the president-elect. Upon being released from hospital, on 21 November, Caf\u00e9 Filho sent a message to the Acting President and to both Houses of Congress informing them that he had recovered from his illness, and therefore was resuming the powers and duties of the Presidency of the Republic. His resumption of those powers and duties, however, was swiftly blocked by the military: army tanks surrounded the Catete Palace (the seat of the presidency), to prevent Caf\u00e9 Filho from reaching the Presidential Palace, where Nereu Ramos remained. Several other points in the capital were also surrounded by military forces. Caf\u00e9 Filho therefore returned to his private residence, that was soon also surrounded by tanks, and the President was prevented from leaving his home. Given that situation, both Houses of Congress summarily voted, on 21 and 22 November 1955, to declare that the President's impediment persisted, that he therefore could not resume the powers and duties of the Presidency until the Congress resolved otherwise, and that acorrdingly, Senator Nereu Ramos should continue as Acting President, as per the congressional resolutions of 11 November. Because this \"solution\" was employed, of the Houses of Congress declaring, on 21 and 22 November, that they considered that Caf\u00e9 Filho could not for the time being resume the powers and duties of the office, he was never formally removed from the office, and there was no impeachment process. Had there been an impeachment process, it would have required a formal accusation against the President, and he would have had the chance to defend himself and to stand trial before the Senate. However, impeachment proceedings were never initiated against Caf\u00e9 Filho, and instead he was simply prevented from resuming his powers and duties on the basis of the congressional resolutions of 21 and 22 November 1955. Although for all practical purposes Caf\u00e9 Filho had effectively been deposed, and it was universally understood that he would never be allowed to resume the powers of the presidency, neither Congress nor the military went as far as declaring the presidential office vacant, and therefore, formally, Caf\u00e9 Filho was not overthrown, but simply barred from resuming the powers of the presidency. While technically Caf\u00e9 Filho was never removed from office, he was thus prevented from resuming the powers and duties of the presidency until the end of his term and the inauguration of Kubitschek on 31 January 1956, and Nereu Ramos continued seving as Acting President until then. Caf\u00e9 Filho's lawyers presented two petitions on his behalf to the Supreme Court also on 22 November 1955: one of habeas corpus, to restore his freedom of movement, and one of writ of mandamus, seeking an injunction from the Court to allow the President to resume his powers and duties. A statute was passed by Congress and signed into law by Acting President Ramos on 25 November declaring a state of siege (a form of martial law prescribed by the emergency provisions of the Constitution, that were then put in operation). On 14 December 1955, the Supreme Federal Court decided not to interfere in the political question, by ruling, regarding the writ of mandamus petition, that it could not decide the case while the state of siege declared by law persisted. As for the habeas corpus petition, it was declared moot on 21 December 1955, after Acting President Ramos informed the Court that Caf\u00e9 Filho's freedom of movement had been restored, without prejudice to the continuation of his impediment. Only on 7 November 1956, long after Caf\u00e9 Filho's term had ended, the Court would resume its deliberation on the writ of mandamus, to dispose of the case and close it, by recognizing that the petition had now been rendered moot, due to the termination of Caf\u00e9 Filho's term in office.}}}}<br />30 January 1956\n| [[Social Progressive Party|Social Progressive Party (PSP)]]\n| colspan=2 {{Party shading/None}}|{{center|{{small|''Vacant''}}}}\n| [[Vice President of Brazil|Vice President]]\n| [[Natal, Brazil|Natal]], [[Rio Grande do Norte]]\n|-\n! style=\"background:{{Brazilian Social Democratic Party/meta/color}}; color:white;\"| 19\n| '''[[Carlos Luz]]'''<br />{{small|(1894\u20131961)}}<br />{{small|''Acting President''<br />for Caf\u00e9 Filho}}\n| [[File:Carlos Luz Oficial.jpg|100px]]\n| \u2014\n| 8 November 1955\n| 11 November 1955 \n| [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945\u201365)|Social Democratic Party (PSD)]]\n| colspan=2 {{Party shading/None}}|{{center|{{small|''Vacant''}}}}\n| President of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|Chamber of Deputies]]<br/>Federal Deputy for [[Minas Gerais]]\n| [[Tr\u00eas Cora\u00e7\u00f5es]], Minas Gerais\n|-\n! style=\"background:{{Brazilian Social Democratic Party/meta/color}}; color:white;\"| 20\n| '''[[Nereu Ramos]]'''<br />{{small|(1888\u20131958)}}<br />{{small|''Acting President''}}{{efn|Nereu Ramos was the Vice President of the Federal Senate (the office of President of the Senate, then vested in the Vice-Presidency of the Republic, was vacant, and thus Ramos, as Vice President of the Senate, acted as the Senate's presiding officer pro tempore).

In spite of being unconstitutional, most historians today agree that those actions, led by Marshal Henrique Lott, had indeed the aim of securing the transfer of power according to the result of the 1955 presidential election; that there was indeed a conspiracy to prevent the inauguration of Kubitschek; and that the democratic result of the 1955 elections would not have been respected if not for the actions of Lott's preventive counter coup.}}\n| [[File:Presidente Nereu Ramos.jpg|100px]]\n| \u2014\n| 11 November 1955\n| 30 January 1956\n| [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945\u201365)|Social Democratic Party (PSD)]]\n| colspan=2 {{Party shading/None}}|{{center|{{small|''Vacant''}}}}\n| Vice President of the [[Brazilian Senate|Federal Senate]]<br/>Senator for [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]\n| [[Lages]], [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]\n|-\n! style=\"background:{{Brazilian Social Democratic Party/meta/color}}; color:white;\"| 21\n| '''[[Juscelino Kubitschek]]'''<br />{{small|(1902\u20131976)}}\n| [[File:Juscelino.jpg|100px]]\n| [[1955 Brazilian presidential election|1955]]\n| 31 January 1956\n| 30 January 1961\n| [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945\u201365)|Social Democratic Party (PSD)]]\n| rowspan=2 style=\"background:{{Brazilian Labour Party (historical)/meta/color}}; color:white;\"|\n| rowspan=2|[[Jo\u00e3o Goulart]]<br />{{small|([[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)|PTB]])}}\n| Governor of [[Minas Gerais]]\n| [[Diamantina, Minas Gerais]]\n|-\n! style=\"background:{{National Labour Party (Brazil)/meta/color}}; color:white;\"| 22\n| '''[[J\u00e2nio Quadros]]'''<br />{{small|(1917\u20131992)}}\n| [[File:Janio Quadros.png|100px]]\n| [[1960 Brazilian presidential election|1960]]\n| 31 January 1961\n| 25 August 1961{{efn|President J\u00e2nio Quadros resigned from office on 25 August 1961. There were no political reasons for President Quadros' sudden and abrupt resignation, that took the country and the political establishment by surprise. Some aides and close advisors of the former President have postulated that Quadros was heavily drunk when he wrote and ordered the delivery to Congress of his letter of resignation. Others suggest that Quadros imagined that Congress would not want his Vice-President, Jo\u00e3o Goulart, as president, and that the legislature would therefore ask him to reconsider his resignation, and would agree to grant him extraordinary powers. Several historians postulate that both things may be true: Quadros was drunk, and in that state he imagined that his resignation would not be accepted and would result in him being able to bargain for extraordinary powers. However, the Brazilian Constitution did not require that the President's resignation be accepted by Congress or by any authority; instead the resignation was deemed to be a unilateral act, that became effective as soon as Congress received the President's written instrument of resignation. Accordingly, once the President of Congress received the Quadros' letter of resignation, a joint session of Congress was convened, the resignation letter was simply read and entered into the records of Congress, and the resignation was deemed effective, and as a result the President of Congress immediately proceeded to declare that Quadros had vacated the Presidency. Afterwards, when asked why he had resigned from office, Quadros denied both the claims of authoritarian intentions and the accounts that he was drunk, but simply stated that he had done it because he wanted to, giving no further reasons for his action. His resignation letter mentioned that he felt he had been \"crushed\" by unspecified \"terrible forces\" organized against him.}}\n| [[Podemos (Brazil)|National Labor Party (PTN)]]\n| Governor of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]]\n| [[Campo Grande]], Mato Grosso do Sul{{efn|By the time J\u00e2nio Quadros was born, Campo Grande was a city in [[Mato Grosso]] State.

While the Vice President was still abroad, there was an attempt on the part of the Vice President's opponents, who controlled Congress, to prevent him from being inaugurated, but that movement failed, due to resistance by the Governor of the State Rio Grande do Sul and a split in the military. However, Congress only allowed the inauguration of Goulart to proceed after a compromise was reached, whereby a Constitutional Amendment severely limiting the powers of the presidency was passed on 2 September 1961. Under that Constitutional Amendment, the presidential executive, that had existed since the proclamation of the Republic, was abolished and replaced with a parliamentary system, in which a Prime Minister was the head of government and the President of the Republic retained only the role of head of state. The Amendment however stipulated that the constitutional change would only become permanent if confirmed by the people in a referendum. On 6 January 1963 that referendum was held, and a majority of the voters rejected the Amendment, backing the restoration of the presidential Executive instead. According to the result of the referendum, on 23 January 1963 a new Constitutional Amendment was promulgated, repealing the 1961 Amendment and re-establishing the presidential Executive as it existed immediately prior to that Amendment. Thus, from 7 September 1961 until 23 January 1963 President Goulart served as head of State only, in a parliamentary system of Government, and, from 23 January 1963 onwards, he served as both head of state and head of government.}}\n| 1 April 1964{{efn|Goulart was deposed by the military coup of 1964, that marked the beginning of the 1964\u20131985 military regime.}}\n| [[Brazilian Labour Party (historical)|Brazilian Labour Party (PTB)]]\n| colspan=2 {{Party shading/None}}|{{center|{{small|''Vacant''}}}}\n| [[Vice President of Brazil|Vice President]]\n| S\u00e3o Borja, Rio Grande do Sul\n|}\n\n==Military Regime (1964\u20131985)==\n{{Main|Brazilian military regime}}\n\n{{legend2|{{Brazilian Social Democratic Party/meta/color}}|[[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945\u201365)|Social Democratic Party]] ''(abolished in 1965)''|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n;<nowiki>Parties abolished, except for two parties:</nowiki>\n{{legend2|{{National Renewal Alliance/meta/color}}|[[National Renewal Alliance]] (later [[Democratic Social Party]])|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n{{legend2|{{Brazilian Democratic Movement Party/meta/color}}|[[Brazilian Democratic Movement]]|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n\n{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n! {{Abbr|No.|Number}}\n!

Moura Andrade then declared Ranieri Mazzilli (who then was the President of the Chamber of Deputies and the first person in the presidential line of succession) to have become President of the Republic. Accordingly, Mazzilli took charge of the Presidency, but, in spite of Moura Andrade's bold statement declaring Mazzilli President, Mazzilli only took office as Acting President: he never took the presidential oath and, during his brief term in office, he issued his acts as \"The President of the Chamber of Deputies, acting in the office of President of the Republic\". The 1946 Constitution, then in force, authorized a Vice-President to succeed to the Presidency if the office of President became vacant, but it only authorized the President of the Chamber of Deputies and the other officers in the line of succession to serve as Acting President, and, in the case of a double vacancy of the Presidency and of the Vice-Presidency, it required new presidential elections to be summoned (direct elections by popular ballot if the second vacancy took place in the first half of the presidential term; indirect elections by Congress if the second vacancy occurred in the second half of the presidential term). Mindful of the fact that the elected President for the 1961-1966 term was Quadros (who had resigned), succeeded as President by Goulart, his Vice-President (who was deposed by the 1964 military coup), and that he was only the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Mazzilli limited his actions to that of a caretaker Acting President, pending the holding of elections. The norms that would have governed those elections, however, were altered by continuing acts of interference from the Armed Forces that had ejected Goulart from office: on 9 April 1964, a body known as the ''Supreme Command of the Revolution'', composed of the leaders of the military coup (the commanders of the three branches of the Armed Forces), issued an ''Institutional Act'' summoning the National Congress to elect a new President in 48 hours. The military then put forward the name of Marshal Castelo Branco, and he was elected by Congress as planned. Ranieri Mazzilli, therefore, remained as Acting President only for two weeks, until the inauguration of Castelo Branco on 15 April 1964.}}}}\n| [[File:Ranieri Mazzilli (1961).jpg|100px]]\n| \u2014\n| 2 April 1964\n| 14 April 1964\n| [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945-65)|Social Democratic Party (PSD)]]\n| colspan=\"2\" {{Party shading/None}} |{{center|{{small|''Vacant''}}}}\n| President of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|Chamber of Deputies]]<br />Federal Deputy for [[S\u00e3o Paulo]]\n| Caconde, S\u00e3o Paulo\n|-\n! style=\"background:{{National Renewal Alliance/meta/color}}; color:white;\" | 26\n| '''[[Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco|Humberto Castelo Branco]]'''<br />{{small|(1897\u20131967)}}\n| [[File:Castelobranco.jpg|100px]]\n| [[1964 Brazilian presidential election|1964]]\n| 15 April 1964\n| 14 March 1967\n| [[National Renewal Alliance|National Renewal Alliance (ARENA)]]<br />(''military'')\n| style=\"background:{{Brazilian Social Democratic Party/meta/color}};\" |\n| [[Jos\u00e9 Maria Alkmin]]<br />{{small|([[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945-65)|PSD]] \u2022 [[National Renewal Alliance|ARENA]]){{efn|Alkmin was a [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1945-65)|PSD]] member; when the PSD was abolished in 1965, he joined [[National Renewal Alliance|ARENA]].}}}}\n| Chief of the General Staff of the [[Brazilian Army]]\n| [[Fortaleza]], Cear\u00e1\n|-\n! style=\"background:{{National Renewal Alliance/meta/color}}; color:white;\" | 27\n| '''[[Artur da Costa e Silva]]'''<br />{{small|(1899\u20131969)}}\n| [[File:Costa e Silva.jpg|100px]]\n| [[1966 Brazilian presidential election|1966]]\n| 15 March 1967\n| 31 August 1969<br />{{small|''Suspended due to ill health''}}<br />14 October 1969 {{small|''Removed''}}{{efn|A military junta composed of the Ministers in charge of the three branches of the Armed Forces assumed the powers of the presidency on 31 August 1969 after President Costa e Sliva suffered a cerebral thrombosis that left him completely incapacitated.

The possibility of a civilian, even a conservative one, assuming the powers of the presidency was seen as detrimental to the continuity of the military regime. In the initial stage of the President's disease, the junta hoped that he would recover. Subsequently, realizing that the President's condition was irreversible, and that the prolonged continuity of a triumvirate was detrimental to the regime and to its image, the military junta issued an institutional act on 14 October 1969 removing the incapacitated President and the Vice President from office and summoning Congress to elect a new President and Vice President. The military elite that controlled the regime then selected General Em\u00edlio Garrastazu M\u00e9dici to be ARENA's candidate, and his name was rubber-stamped by Congress. The junta remained in place until the new President was sworn-in. In 2011, Brazil enacted a Federal Law recognizing the illegality of the acts that prevented Vice President Pedro Aleixo from becoming Acting President and that removed him from office; the statute also directs that Pedro Aleixo be deemed a former President of the Republic.

On 2 October 1992, upon receiving the formal writ of summons notifying him that he was now a defendant in the impeachment trial that the Senate would conduct, President Collor was automatically suspended from office for 180 days as provided in the Constitution of Brazil and Vice President Itamar Franco became Acting President. On 29 December 1992, on the final day of his trial of impeachment before the Federal Senate, President Collor resigned the presidency, in an attempt to stop the process. The Senate's session as a Court of Impeachment was suspended and two successive joint sessions of Congress were held, one shortly after the other: in the first joint session, President Collor's resignation letter was formally read before Congress by its First Secretary and entered the congressional record, and the presidential resignation thereby took legal effect, resulting in the formal declaration by the President of Congress to the assembled joint session, that the presidency of the Republic was vacant, and that, as a result of that vacancy, Acting President Franco would be summoned at once, as Collor's legal successor, to take the constitutional oath and assume the Presidency; in the second joint session of Congress, Acting President Itamar Franco was accordingly sworn-in as President, as required by the Constitution. Later in the same day, the Senate resumed its sitting as a Court of Impeachment, and it decided that the President's resignation after the start of the trial could not stop the process, given that the determination of the former President's guilt or innocence was relevant for the purposes of imposing on him the penalty of disqualification from holding public office for eight years. Accordingly, the trial of impeachment continued in spite of Collor's resignation and, in the early hours of 30 December 1992 he was found guilty of the charges, by the required majority of more than two thirds of the members of the Senate. The penalty of removal from office was declared moot as Collor had already resigned, but as a result of his conviction by the Senate he was disqualified for holding public office for eight years. The Senate's sentence in the trial of impeachment, imposing upon Collor the said penalty, was pronounced on 30 December 1992 and published in the Official Journal on 31 December 1992.

The placename may also be a corruption of 'Doire R\u00ed' meaning \"The King's Oakwood\". The only tradition connected with the fort is about a fairy living there. A book published in 1912 entitled \"''Folk Tales of Breffny''\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/folktalesofbreff00hunt]</ref> by a Templeport author Mrs Augusta Wardell, n\u00e9e Hunt, under the pen name 'Bunda Hunt' gives a version of the tale which she learned it at the age of seven from an old man named Dolan. It goes as follows-\n\n{{blockquote|There was once a man of these parts and he had a great longing for to find a treasure. It chanced one evening that he seen a gankeynogue in the field, sitting in under a bush, and he says: \"Yon lad will surely be worth a powerful weight of gold.\" With that he went over and caught a hold of the gankey. [According to Patrick Joyce in ''English as we speak it in Ireland'' (London 1910) Gankinna means a fairy or a leprechaun, from the Irish gann meaning small.]\n\n\"Let you discover a treasure.\" says he, \"or else I'll keep you like a dog on a chain from this out.\" \"Keep away!\" says the gankey. \"How would a poor creature like myself be finding treasure for a strong farmer!\" \"Let you not let on to be miserable,\" says the man, \"for well I know it's great wealth you enjoy.\" \"Is it me!\" says the gankeynogue. \"Sure I support a lengthy family entirely by my own industry.\" But the farmer would not believe a word of the sort. He carried the gankey to his house and put him into a big oak chest. \"You'll never get out except for to show me where treasure is lodged,\" he allows. But the gankeynogue wasn't in notion of giving the least information. He sat up in the oak chest, hammering, shouting and singing until he had the people's heads light. All the while the farmer was determined to get the better of him and he never agreed to let him go. The lad was his tenth day in the chest when the man of the house came running in that evening, shouting at the top of his voice: \"Darragh fort's on fire! Darragh fort's on fire!\" With that the gankey began the most woeful lamentations, and he hammering like mad to get out of the chest. \"What ails you at all?\" asks the farmer. \"My wife and family are in that place,\" says the gankey. \"Let me away to bring them safe from the fire.\" \"Will you show me a treasure?\" asks the man. \"Aye surely!\" says the gankeynogue.\" \"But let's go first to Darragh fort to save my weak family, and then I'll bestow the treasure.\" So the two started off for Darragh fort, and it not on fire at all- that was a story the man was after inventing for to scare the gankeynogue. When they landed in sight of the place the man allowed the fire to be to have burnt out. Didn't the gankey make a run and lept in among the trees. \"I'm safe from you now,\" says he. But the man never let on to be vexed that he couldn't see the lad any more, he listened to his voice speaking for to know the direction he went. Then he lay down in that part of the fort and let on to be asleep. After a while he heard the gankeynogue telling his wife about how he was kept in the chest. \"I was ten days in that place,\" says he. \"And I full of venom against the farmer.\" \"But it's the cunning lad I am, for I never let on where the treasure is buried at all.\" \"Where is it!\" asks the gankeynogue's wife. \"Under a stone in the stree before his house,\" says the gankey. \"And herself tripped and spilled a bucket of milk just over the place this morning. I was looking out on a hole in the chest, and still never let on one word when I seen what happened.\" \"You're a wise little fellow, sure enough,\" says his wife. The farmer got up and away home with him after hearing what they said. He asked herself where she spilled the milk at the morning of the day. \"By that stone,\" says she, setting her foot on a flag in the street. He brought the loy and a crowbar for to hoke up the place, and didn't he discover a beautiful treasure of gold.\"\n|''The Gankeynogue in the Oak Chest'' (pp.&nbsp;187\u2013192)}}\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Darreragh''.<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf National Archives Dublin]</ref><ref>[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html]</ref>\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Derryreagh''.<ref>Trinity College Dublin: [http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 The Down Survey of Ireland.]</ref>\n\n[[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Derirea''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Down Survey Maps |url=http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#c=Cavan |website=The Down Survey Project |publisher=Bibliotheque National de France}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Plantation of Ulster]] by grant dated 4 June 1611, along with other lands, King [[James VI and I]] granted ''one poll of Derry to Callo O'Gowne, gentleman at an annual rent of \u00a31-12s''.\n\nThe O'Gowne lands in Derryragh were confiscated in the Cromwellian [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652]] and were distributed as follows-\n\nA grant dated 3 November 1666 was made by King [[Charles II of England]] to [[Sir Tristram Beresford, 1st Baronet]] which included, inter alia, 2 cartrons of ''Derriereagh'' containing 64 acres of profitable land and 38 acres-0 roods-16 perches of unprofitable land.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/op1244157-1001#page/n47/mode/2up/search/rospressell]</ref> By grant dated 11 September 1670 from King [[Charles II of England]] to said Sir Tristram Beresford, the said lands of ''Derrereagh'' were included in the creation of a new ''Manor of Beresford''.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/cu31924091769590/page/n301]</ref>\n\nBy deed dated 19 October 1749 Frederick Lawder of Ballymagauran sold his leasehold estate of six poles of the lands of Ballymagauran and a half pole in Derriereagh (which he held on lease from [[Marcus Beresford, 1st Earl of Tyrone]]) to Randal Slack, of Dublin and Lakefield, County Leitrim, gentleman, for the sum of \u00a3504-3s-3d.

[According to Patrick Joyce in ''English as we speak it in Ireland'' (London 1910) Gankinna means a fairy or a leprechaun, from the Irish gann meaning small.]\n\n\"Let you discover a treasure.\" says he, \"or else I'll keep you like a dog on a chain from this out.\" \"Keep away!\" says the gankey. \"How would a poor creature like myself be finding treasure for a strong farmer!\" \"Let you not let on to be miserable,\" says the man, \"for well I know it's great wealth you enjoy.\" \"Is it me!\" says the gankeynogue. \"Sure I support a lengthy family entirely by my own industry.\" But the farmer would not believe a word of the sort. He carried the gankey to his house and put him into a big oak chest. \"You'll never get out except for to show me where treasure is lodged,\" he allows. But the gankeynogue wasn't in notion of giving the least information. He sat up in the oak chest, hammering, shouting and singing until he had the people's heads light. All the while the farmer was determined to get the better of him and he never agreed to let him go. The lad was his tenth day in the chest when the man of the house came running in that evening, shouting at the top of his voice: \"Darragh fort's on fire! Darragh fort's on fire!\" With that the gankey began the most woeful lamentations, and he hammering like mad to get out of the chest. \"What ails you at all?\" asks the farmer. \"My wife and family are in that place,\" says the gankey. \"Let me away to bring them safe from the fire.\" \"Will you show me a treasure?\" asks the man. \"Aye surely!\" says the gankeynogue.\" \"But let's go first to Darragh fort to save my weak family, and then I'll bestow the treasure.\" So the two started off for Darragh fort, and it not on fire at all- that was a story the man was after inventing for to scare the gankeynogue. When they landed in sight of the place the man allowed the fire to be to have burnt out. Didn't the gankey make a run and lept in among the trees. \"I'm safe from you now,\" says he. But the man never let on to be vexed that he couldn't see the lad any more, he listened to his voice speaking for to know the direction he went. Then he lay down in that part of the fort and let on to be asleep. After a while he heard the gankeynogue telling his wife about how he was kept in the chest. \"I was ten days in that place,\" says he. \"And I full of venom against the farmer.\" \"But it's the cunning lad I am, for I never let on where the treasure is buried at all.\" \"Where is it!\" asks the gankeynogue's wife. \"Under a stone in the stree before his house,\" says the gankey. \"And herself tripped and spilled a bucket of milk just over the place this morning. I was looking out on a hole in the chest, and still never let on one word when I seen what happened.\" \"You're a wise little fellow, sure enough,\" says his wife. The farmer got up and away home with him after hearing what they said. He asked herself where she spilled the milk at the morning of the day. \"By that stone,\" says she, setting her foot on a flag in the street. He brought the loy and a crowbar for to hoke up the place, and didn't he discover a beautiful treasure of gold.\"\n|''The Gankeynogue in the Oak Chest'' (pp.&nbsp;187\u2013192)}}\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Darreragh''.<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf National Archives Dublin]</ref><ref>[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html]</ref>\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Derryreagh''.<ref>Trinity College Dublin: [http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 The Down Survey of Ireland.]</ref>\n\n[[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Derirea''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Down Survey Maps |url=http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#c=Cavan |website=The Down Survey Project |publisher=Bibliotheque National de France}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Plantation of Ulster]] by grant dated 4 June 1611, along with other lands, King [[James VI and I]] granted ''one poll of Derry to Callo O'Gowne, gentleman at an annual rent of \u00a31-12s''.\n\nThe O'Gowne lands in Derryragh were confiscated in the Cromwellian [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652]] and were distributed as follows-\n\nA grant dated 3 November 1666 was made by King [[Charles II of England]] to [[Sir Tristram Beresford, 1st Baronet]] which included, inter alia, 2 cartrons of ''Derriereagh'' containing 64 acres of profitable land and 38 acres-0 roods-16 perches of unprofitable land.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/op1244157-1001#page/n47/mode/2up/search/rospressell]</ref> By grant dated 11 September 1670 from King [[Charles II of England]] to said Sir Tristram Beresford, the said lands of ''Derrereagh'' were included in the creation of a new ''Manor of Beresford''.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/cu31924091769590/page/n301]</ref>\n\nBy deed dated 19 October 1749 Frederick Lawder of Ballymagauran sold his leasehold estate of six poles of the lands of Ballymagauran and a half pole in Derriereagh (which he held on lease from [[Marcus Beresford, 1st Earl of Tyrone]]) to Randal Slack, of Dublin and Lakefield, County Leitrim, gentleman, for the sum of \u00a3504-3s-3d.

The [[French First Republic|French Republic]] sought to capture Egypt as the first stage in an effort to threaten [[British India]] and support [[Tipu Sultan]], and thus force [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] to make peace. Departing [[Toulon]] in May 1798 with over 40,000 troops and hundreds of ships, Bonaparte's fleet sailed southeastwards across the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. They were followed by a small British squadron under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Horatio Nelson]], later reinforced to 13 [[ships of the line]], whose pursuit was hampered by a lack of scouting [[frigate]]s and reliable information. Bonaparte's first target was the island of [[Malta]], which was under the government of the [[Knights of St. John]] and theoretically granted its owner control of the Central Mediterranean. Bonaparte's forces landed on the island and rapidly overwhelmed the defenders, securing the port city of [[Valletta]] before continuing to Egypt. When Nelson learned of the French capture of the island, he guessed the French target to be Egypt and sailed for [[Alexandria]], but passed the French during the night of 22 June without discovering them and arrived off Egypt first.\n\nUnable to find Bonaparte, Nelson turned back across the Mediterranean, eventually reaching [[Sicily]] on 19 July. While Nelson was returning westwards, Bonaparte reached Alexandria and stormed the city, capturing the coast and marching his army inland. His fleet, entrusted to Vice-Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers]], was anchored in a [[line of battle]] in [[Aboukir Bay]]. On 1 August, Nelson, who had returned to the Egyptian coast after reports gathered at [[Koroni|Coron]] revealed the French invasion, arrived off Aboukir Bay. Although it was late afternoon and the British fleet had no accurate charts of the bay, Nelson ordered an immediate attack on the French [[:wikt:vanguard|van]]. Brueys was unprepared, and his ships were unable to manoeuvre as the British split into two divisions and sailed down either side of the French line, capturing all five ships of the vanguard and engaging his 120-gun flagship [[French ship Orient (1791)|''Orient'']] in the centre. At 21:00, ''Orient'' caught fire and exploded, killing most of the crew and ending the main combat. Sporadic fighting continued for the next two days, until all of the French ships had been captured, destroyed or fled. At the [[Battle of the Nile]], eleven French ships of the line and two frigates were eliminated, trapping Bonaparte in Egypt and changing the balance of power in the Mediterranean.\n\nWith the French Navy in the Mediterranean defeated, other nations were encouraged to join the [[Second Coalition]] and go to war with France. [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] all subsequently deployed forces to the Mediterranean. The Russians and Turks participated in the blockade of Egypt and operations in the [[Adriatic Sea]] while the Portuguese joined the [[Siege of Malta (1798-1800)|Siege of Malta]], which was distantly conducted by Nelson from his lodgings in [[Naples]]. Nelson, who had been wounded at the Battle of the Nile, became involved in Neapolitan politics and encouraged [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|King Ferdinand]] to go to war with France, resulting in the loss of his mainland kingdom. In the Western Mediterranean, Vice-Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Earl St Vincent]], who commanded the Mediterranean fleet from off [[Cadiz]], deployed forces against [[Menorca]], rapidly captured the island and turned it into an important naval base.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Bonaparte's plan===\nAt the beginning of 1798, the [[War of the First Coalition]] had come to an end with French control of Northern Italy, much of the [[Low Countries]] and the [[Rhineland]] confirmed by the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]].<ref name=\"DC78\">Chandler, p. 78</ref> Of all the major European powers that had at one time allied against the [[First French Republic|French Republic]], only the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] remained hostile, and the [[French Directory]] determined to end the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] by eliminating Britain. A series of invasions of the [[British Isles]] were planned,<ref name=\"DC185\">Come, p. 185</ref> and the 28-year-old General [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], who had defeated the Austrians in Italy the previous year, was assigned to lead the ''Arm\u00e9e d'Angleterre'' (Army of England) that had been assembled at [[Boulogne]].<ref name=\"WJ113\">James, p. 113</ref> However, the [[English Channel]] was firmly controlled by the [[Royal Navy]] and French invasion supplies, particularly of viable [[landing craft]], were totally inadequate for the purpose.<ref name=\"RG107\">Gardiner, p. 107</ref>\n\nIn the early spring of 1798, Bonaparte left his command at Boulogne and returned to Paris, reporting that continued British naval supremacy in Northern European waters made an invasion impossible in the near future.<ref name=\"NM248\">Mostert, p. 248</ref> With operations to the north impossible, Bonaparte directed his attention southwards to [[Toulon]], the principal French seaport on the [[Mediterranean]]. There a French army and fleet had begun assembling for a secret location, speculated by French commentators to be aimed at a wide variety of places, including among others Britain, [[Sicily]], Malta and the [[Crimea]].<ref name=\"JC3\">Cole, p. 3</ref><ref name=\"SM230\">Maffeo, p. 230</ref> The expedition's intended target was actually [[Egypt]], which formed an important link in the chain of communications between Britain and the economically vital colony of [[British India]].<ref name=\"RLA7\">Adkins, p. 7</ref> Bonaparte considered the capture of Egypt as the most important step in neutralising the massive economic benefits that Britain gained from trade with India and bringing Britain to terms: in August 1797 he wrote \"The time is not far away that we will feel that, in order to truly destroy England, we must take Egypt.\"<ref name=\"JC14\">Cole, p. 13</ref> Possession of Egypt could grant the French control of the Eastern Mediterranean and the [[Red Sea]], forcing severe delays to dispatches sent between Britain and India and obstructing trade worth \u00a32.7 million (the equivalent of \u00a3{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|2700000|1798|r=-7}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) to the British economy.{{Inflation-fn|UK}}<ref name=\"SM227\">Maffeo, p. 227</ref> In addition, a successful invasion of Egypt could be followed by a direct attack on British territory in India, possibly in conjunction with the anglophobic [[Tippoo Sultan]] of [[Seringapatam]].<ref name=\"OW41\">Warner, p. 41</ref> The French Mediterranean Fleet was unopposed at the start of 1798 \u2013 following the [[Second Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]] in 1796, in which Spain formed an alliance with France and declared war on Britain, the Royal Navy had withdrawn from the Mediterranean bases of [[Corsica]] and [[Elba]].<ref name=\"JHR140\">Rose, p. 140</ref> By early 1798, their Mediterranean Fleet was based at the [[Tagus River]] in Portugal, their one remaining continental ally.<ref name=\"SM224\">Maffeo, p. 224</ref> With no permanent British fleet in the Mediterranean and [[Irish rebellion of 1798|an uprising]] imminent in Ireland, Bonaparte firmly believed that the Royal Navy would be unable to intervene in his plans, even if they should discover them.<ref name=\"JHR141\">Rose, p. 141</ref>\n\nWith passage to Egypt seemingly unopposed Bonaparte gave orders for a fleet of thirteen [[ships of the line]], led by the 120-gun [[French ship Orient|''Orient'']] under Vice-Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers]] and numerous smaller warships, including the entire Venetian Navy, captured the previous year, to prepare for sea.<ref name=\"RG20\">Gardiner, p. 20</ref> The fleet was to be accompanied by up to 400 [[transport ship]]s, which were to carry the 35,000 men detailed for the invasion.<ref name=\"WLC353\">Clowes, p. 353</ref>  On 3 May, Bonaparte departed Paris, arriving at Toulon five days later to oversee the final preparations. On 9 May he reviewed the assembled army and gave a speech announcing that the expedition was bound for an unspecified foreign land.

There a report from a captured British merchant brig warned Bonaparte that Nelson was only a short distance behind his force with a powerful Royal Navy fleet and, concerned for his transports, Bonaparte gave urgent orders for the French fleet to steer for Malta, arriving off [[Valletta]] at 05:30 on 9 June, shortly after uniting with the 56 ships of the Civitavecchia convoy, which had missed the rendezvous and continued to Malta alone.<ref name=\"WJ150\"/><ref name=\"SM259\">Maffeo, p. 259</ref>\n\nThe report on Nelson's activity submitted to Bonaparte on 7 June was inaccurate: Repairs to ''Vanguard'' in San Pietro took six days, the squadron sailing on 27 May for Toulon, arriving off the harbour on 31 May.<ref name=\"WLC354\">Clowes, p. 354</ref>{{Cref2|Note A}} Nelson had already learned of the departure of the French fleet from a captured [[Marseilles]] merchant ship, but without reinforcements or knowledge of the French direction he could not begin a pursuit.<ref name=\"JK44\">Keegan, p. 44</ref> On 5 June, the brig HMS ''Mutine'' arrived off Toulon and reported that a British fleet was only a few days away, consisting of ten ships of the line and a [[fourth rate]] sent by Earl St Vincent from the Tagus on 24 May under Captain [[Sir Thomas Troubridge, 1st Baronet|Thomas Troubridge]] in [[HMS Culloden (1783)|HMS ''Culloden'']].<ref name=\"WJ152\">James, p. 152</ref> St Vincent, acting under urgent orders from London to send a fleet to the Mediterranean had opted to split his forces, rather than risk taking all of his ships into the Mediterranean and leaving the Spanish at Cadiz unattended.

Although the Neapolitan Prime Minister [[Sir John Acton, 6th Baronet|Sir John Acton]] had already passed on reports that the French were sailing for Egypt, Hamilton did not give the report to Nelson, possibly suspicious of [[disinformation]].<ref name=\"JK50\">Keegan, p. 50</ref> Hamilton did however relay the information that Bonaparte's fleet had passed Sardinia and were probably sailing in the direction of Malta. Despite private animosity towards France,<ref name=\"OW55\">Warner, p. 55</ref> the Neapolitan government refused to openly join the British in the war and denied Nelson the use of their frigates,<ref name=\"EB176\">Bradford, p. 176</ref> although they did quietly agree to resupply Nelson's fleet.<ref name=\"NM253\"/> With a rough direction established and believing the ultimate French destination to be Sicily,<ref name=\"EB177\">Bradford, p. 177</ref> Nelson sailed in pursuit, but light winds hampered his advances and he did not pass the [[Straits of Messina]] until 20 June.

Two squadrons of five ships each would engage the French fleet directly while the third would separate and attack the transports, sinking or capturing as many as possible.<ref name=\"WJ153\">James, p. 153</ref> Nelson also deliberately forged close links with his captains at regular dinners aboard his flagship to ensure ease of communication and build confidence between them.

Arriving off Malta on 9 June, he demanded that the island's ruler, [[Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim]], the [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master]] of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] (or Knights of St. John of Jerusalem) to allow his fleet to enter the harbour and purchase provisions.<ref name=\"JC8\">Cole, p. 8</ref>  Hompesch refused, insisting that only two ships at a time could enter the port. Bonaparte responded by opening fire on the harbour defences and on 11 June landed soldiers at seven sites around Malta under General [[Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers]]. Coming under fire from the 2,000 native Maltese soldiers that mustered against the invasion, skirmishing continued in the western part of the island for 24 hours, until General [[Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois]] entered [[Mdina]] and the defenders withdrew to the [[Fortifications of Valletta|fortress of Valletta]].<ref name=\"JC9\">Cole, p. 9</ref> The Maltese troops refused to continue the fight without support from their government,<ref name=\"OW29\">Warner, p. 29</ref> and negotiations followed in which Hompesch and the knights agreed to abandon Malta on condition of financial compensation amounting to 3 million [[Francs]].<ref name=\"JC10\"/> In exchange, Bonaparte gained the entire Maltese archipelago, including fortresses, military stores and cannon, the small Maltese Navy and Army and the entire property of the Roman Catholic Church in Malta.<ref name=\"RG21\">Gardiner, p. 21</ref>\n\nThe Maltese position had already been severely weakened by the large number of Frenchmen who were part of the Order, who refused ''en masse'' to take up arms against Bonaparte. The [[French Revolution]] had already significantly reduced the Knights' income and their ability to put up serious resistance to Bonaparte was seriously compromised by a lack of resources.<ref name=\"JC10\">Cole, p. 10</ref> On 12 June, Bonaparte finally announced to his troops the destination of the expedition and on 19 June he sailed for Alexandria, initially steering east towards [[Crete]]. He left behind Vaubois and 4,000 men to maintain Malta as a base to control the Central Mediterranean.<ref name=\"RLA13\">Adkins, p. 13</ref> To ensure that news of the impending attack on Egypt did not spread ahead of the fleet, Brueys ordered that any merchant ships that sighted the convoy during the passage were to be seized and detained until his force had reached Alexandria.<ref name=\"SM256\">Maffeo, p. 256</ref> On 26 June, the British gained the first firm intelligence of French intentions, when the frigate [[HMS Seahorse (1794)|HMS ''Seahorse'']] under Captain [[Edward Foote]] [[Action of 27 June 1798|encountered and captured]] the French frigate [[French frigate Sensible (1788)|''Sensible'']], which was returning to Toulon from Malta with a cargo of treasure and wounded soldiers, including General d'Hilliers.<ref name=\"WJ208\">James, p. 208</ref> From these prisoners the destination of the French fleet was discovered and ''Seahorse'', joined shortly afterwards by ''Terpsichore'', sailed in pursuit, hoping to encounter Nelson.<ref name=\"WJ160\">James, p. 160</ref>\n\n==Arrivals at Alexandria==\nNelson's passage from Sicily to Alexandria was uneventful, the journey taking six days. Due to his lack of frigates, Nelson was unable to scout to the flanks of his advance and as a result only spoke with three merchant ships, none of which had useful information about the French fleet.<ref name=\"WJ154\">James, p. 154</ref> The lack of frigates had already had a decisive effect on 22 June, when the British fleet sighted four sails to the southeast.<ref name=\"NM254\">Mostert, p. 254</ref> Although Captain [[Sir Thomas Thompson, 1st Baronet|Thomas Thompson]] of [[HMS Leander (1780)|HMS ''Leander'']] requested permission to investigate the strangers, Nelson refused and ordered his fleet to continue on their current heading, believing the French to be five days ahead and wishing to reach Alexandria as rapidly as possible.<ref name=\"JK56\">Keegan, p. 56</ref> Had British frigates been available to approach and investigate the distant squadron, they might have discovered that they were scouts for the main French fleet, which was only a short distance away.<ref name=\"RLA14\">Adkins, p. 14</ref> The French frigate had sighted the British fleet and reported its presence to Bonaparte, who adjusted his convoy's direction slightly to a more northerly trajectory.<ref name=\"EB182\">Bradford, p. 182</ref> As a result, Nelson's fleet passed north of the French to the east of Malta during the night in a heavy mist. Although Nelson was so close that his signal guns could be heard aboard ''Orient'', his lookouts did not observe the French ships and the British fleet continued ahead without deviating.<ref name=\"SM258\">Maffeo, p. 258</ref> When dawn broke the following day, Bonaparte's diversion to the northeast had taken his convoy out of sight of the British fleet, which continued to the southeast undisturbed.<ref name=\"EB185\">Bradford, p. 185</ref> On 28 June, ''Mutine''  arrived at Alexandria ahead of Nelson's fleet, and discovered that the French fleet was not in the harbour.<ref name=\"OW58\">Warner, p. 58</ref> Once the main fleet had arrived, attempts were made to contact the British Consul [[George Baldwin (diplomat)|George Baldwin]], but these failed as he had been dismissed by the British government shortly before and had left the city.<ref name=\"ODNB\">{{cite journal |last= Mew|first=James |month= |title=Baldwin, George |journal=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |id= |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1165|accessdate=26 November 2009 |quote= }}</ref> As a result, official diplomatic channels were closed to Nelson.<ref name=\"EB188\">Bradford, p. 188</ref> A message warning of the French approach was carried to the Ottoman governor Sayyid Muhammad Kurayyim by Hardy in ''Mutine''.

Soldiers were landed in the region of the Mirabou Creek, although the appearance of a sail to the east was mistaken for a scout from the British fleet and caused momentary panic, Bonaparte reportedly exclaiming: ''\"Fortune, m'abandonnerais-tu? Quoi! Seulement cinq jours!\"'' (Fortune, wilt thou abandon me? What! Only five days!). The newcomer was eventually revealed to be the French frigate ''[[French frigate Justice (1794)|Justice]]'' sent from Malta, and the invasion continued unopposed.<ref name=\"WJ156\">James, p. 156</ref> By evening the landing had been completed, although several boats had been wrecked in the surf and Bonaparte himself estimated that at least 20 men had drowned.<ref name=\"RLA17\">Adkins, p. 17</ref>\n\nOn 2 July, Bonaparte led his men to victory in the brief [[Battle of Alexandria (1798)|Battle of Alexandria]] and secured the city. He placed General [[Jean Baptiste Kl\u00e9ber]] in command with Rear-Admiral [[Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley]] in charge of the harbour.<ref name=\"WJ156\"/> Finding that entrances to the anchorage were too shallow to accommodate the main body of the French fleet, Bonaparte ordered Brueys to sail his squadron to the wider [[Aboukir Bay]], {{convert|20|mi|km}} northeast of Alexandria. Brueys was instructed that if he considered the anchorage to be unsafe then he was to sail for Corfu, leaving only a small light force that could anchor comfortably in Alexandria.<ref name=\"NM257\">Mostert, p. 257</ref> There Brueys held a conference with his officers to decide on their response should Nelson discover them in the bay. Although Rear-Admiral [[Armand Blanquet du Chayla|Armand Blanquet]] of [[French ship Franklin (1797)|''Franklin'']] argued that the fleet was safest sailing out to meet the British, he was outvoted and overruled, Brueys ordering that the ships remain anchored in [[line of battle]] to receive the British attack.<ref name=\"WJ159\">James, p. 159</ref> On 21 July, the frigates ''Seahorse'' and ''Terpsichore'' arrived at Alexandria and observed the French dispositions while flying [[French tricolour|French colours]] to confuse observers from the shore. With no sign of Nelson, Foote and Hall turned back westwards in search of the admiral.<ref name=\"WJ160\"/> When Brueys learned that British frigates had been seen off the Egyptian coast, he decided that the retreat of these vessels signified that there was no danger of imminent attack by a British force and therefore failed to take precautions against attack.<ref name=\"OW65\">Warner, p. 65</ref>\n\n===Nelson returns===\nNelson, having sailed northeast on the same day that the first French ships arrived off Alexandria, had reached [[Anatolia]] on 4 July and turned westward against the wind, sailing for Sicily again.<ref name=\"EB192\">Bradford, p. 192</ref>  His ships were briefly scattered by a storm on 5 July, before reconstituting the following day and on 18 July the British fleet reached Cape Passaro again and on 19 July Nelson's force anchored in Syracuse to take on fresh provisions supplied in part by [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]], the wife of the ambassador to Naples.<ref name=\"WLC355\"/> Frustrated, Nelson wrote in a letter to his wife [[Frances Nelson|Fanny]]; \"Every moment I have to regret the frigates having left me, to which must be attributed my ignorance of the movements of the enemy.\"<ref name=\"NM258\">Mostert, p. 258</ref> Reports subsequently reached the British fleet at Syracuse that the French had not been seen in the Eastern Mediterranean, in the [[Adriatic]] or in the [[Aegean Sea]], leaving either Egypt or Syria as the only likely destinations.<ref name=\"EB195\">Bradford, p. 195</ref>  Sailing once more on 25 July, Nelson turned his ships east once again sailing for Morea and sending Troubridge in ''Culloden'' into [[Koroni|Coron]] on 28 July for news.<ref name=\"SM266\">Maffeo, p. 266</ref> The Ottoman governor reported that the French had been seen sailing southwards from Crete at the start of the month and presented Troubridge with a French merchant ship that was anchored in the harbour.<ref name=\"OW62\">Warner, p. 62</ref> With their first definite sighting of the French, the British fleet turned southwards towards Alexandria.<ref name=\"RG30\">Gardiner, p. 30</ref>\n\n==Battle of the Nile==\n{{dablink|For more details on this topic, see [[Battle of the Nile]].}}\nOn 1 August, Nelson's fleet reached the Egyptian coast, the ships [[HMS Swiftsure (1787)|HMS ''Swiftsure'']] and [[HMS Alexander (1778)|HMS ''Alexander'']] detached as scouts to investigate Alexandria harbour.

He believed that Nelson would anchor off the bay and attack in the morning, giving Brueys time to prepare and leaving open the option of simply sailing away during the night, following Bonaparte's orders to avoid a direct confrontation with the British fleet.<ref name=\"WJ161\">James, p. 161</ref>\n\n===Nelson's attack===\n[[File:Battle of the Nile, Whitcombe2.jpg|thumb|300px|''Battle of the Nile, Augt 1st 1798'', [[Thomas Whitcombe]], 1816.

Rather than place his lead ship ''Guerrier'' close to the northern shoal, the French admiral had left a gap, widened by the order for the French fleet to only anchor by the bow which meant that they drifted significantly, between ''Guerrier'' and the shoals.<ref name=\"RLA24\"/> Sailing directly through this gap, Foley [[raking fire|raked]] ''Guerrier'' and engaged the second ship of the French line, ''Conqu\u00e9rant''.<ref name=\"NM266\">Mostert, p. 266</ref> ''Zealous'' also passed through the gap and attacked ''Guerrier'', and was followed by [[HMS Orion (1787)|HMS ''Orion'']], [[HMS Theseus (1786)|HMS ''Theseus'']] and [[HMS Audacious (1785)|HMS ''Audacious'']], all of which opened up a fierce fire on the first four French ships against their unprepared [[port (nautical)|port]] sides.<ref name=\"WJ165\">James, p. 165</ref>\n\nNelson followed in ''Vanguard'', bringing the next two ships into action with the [[starboard]] side of the French van, catching the French ships in a crossfire that rapidly battered and dismasted the ships, despite determined defence.<ref name=\"WLC362\">Clowes, p. 362</ref> As the French van was destroyed, [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS ''Bellerophon'']] and [[HMS Majestic (1785)|HMS ''Majestic'']] attacked the French centre.

Nine of eleven ships of the line had been captured or destroyed, as well as two frigates.<ref name=\"NM272\"/> French casualties totalled more than 3,000 and possibly as many as 5,000, compared to British losses of 218 killed and 677 wounded.<ref name=\"WLC370\">Clowes, p. 370</ref> However, many of Nelson's ships were seriously damaged, and urgent repairs were required for both his own ships and the captured prizes before they could begin the long voyage back to Britain. For more than two weeks Nelson remained in Aboukir Bay, effecting repairs, writing despatches and assessing the strategic situation in Egypt.<ref name=\"SM273\">Maffeo, p. 273</ref> The first ship detached from his squadron was ''Leander'', sent on 5 August to the fleet under Earl St. Vincent off [[Cadiz]] with reports of the battle.<ref name=\"WJ182\">James, p. 182</ref> On 8 August Aboukir Island was stormed and captured, and on 12 August ''Emerald'', ''Alcmene'' and ''Bonne Citoyenne'' finally caught up with the fleet, followed on 17 August by ''Seahorse'' and ''Terpsichore''.<ref name=\"WLC373\"/> ''Mutine'' was detached on 13 August with despatches for the Admiralty and on 14 August Nelson sent seven ships with the six seaworthy prizes to the mouth of Aboukir Bay under the command of Saumarez.<ref name=\"WJ183\">James, p. 183</ref> This convoy sailed for Gibraltar on 15 August and the following day Nelson burnt ''Heureux'', followed on 18 August by ''Mercure'' and ''Guerrier'', none of which were fit for continued service. On 19 August Nelson separated his remaining ships, leading three vessels northwards towards Naples and leaving a [[blockade]] squadron off Alexandria of ''Zealous'', ''Goliath'', ''Swiftsure'' and the frigates, under Captain [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Samuel Hood]].<ref name=\"WLC373\">Clowes, p. 373</ref>\n\nBy the time Nelson departed Alexandria, his first set of dispatches were already in French hands. ''Leander'' had been discovered off the western coast of [[Crete]] [[Action of 18 August 1798|on 18 August 1798]] by the French ship of the line [[French ship Le G\u00e9n\u00e9reux|''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'']], one of Villeneuve's escapees.<ref name=RG43>Gardiner, p. 43</ref> After separating from Villeneuve's squadron on 17 August, ''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'' was sailing to Corfu when it encountered the British fourth rate. The larger French ship soon overtook the British vessel and a heated exchange followed: French efforts to board ''Leander'' were driven back with heavy casualties, and Captain Thompson at one stage successfully raked his opponent, but gradually the heavier weight of ''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'' inflicted severe damage to the British ship and after six and a half hours Thompson was forced to surrender.<ref name=\"WJ232\">James, p. 232</ref> French captain [[Louis-Jean-Nicolas Lejoille|Lejoille]] then authorised widespread looting of the personal effects of the British crew, whom he also forced to conduct repairs on both ships, an act against the established conventions of naval warfare.<ref name=\"WLC516\">Clowes, p. 516</ref> The prize was towed to Corfu for repairs, the two battered vessels briefly encountering ''Mutine'', which escaped to the westwards before ''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'' could give chase. In captivity Lejoille continued to refuse to allow the British officers medical attention or return their stolen property.<ref name=\"WJ235\">James, p. 235</ref> Eventually returned to Britain, Thompson and Berry were [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] and heavily praised for their defence of their ship against heavy odds, while Lejoille was also commended for his success, assisted by his incorrect account of the battle published in French newspapers.<ref name=\"WJ237\">James, p. 237</ref>\n\n===Alexandria===\nWith the French naval presence in the Mediterranean reduced to a few scattered vessels, the allies of the [[Second Coalition]] were able to exert their dominance in the region. Off Alexandria, the squadron under Captain Hood successfully prevented communications between France and the French army in Egypt.<ref name=\"WJ191\">James, p. 191</ref> On 22 August, just three days after Nelson sailed north, ''Alcmene'' intercepted the 6-gun dispatch vessel ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' off Alexandria harbour and forced the captain to surrender. As his flag was struck, the captain hurled the dispatches into the sea. This action was witnessed by sailors [[John Taylor (RN hero)|John Taylor]] and John Harding aboard ''Alcmene'' and both men dived into the water, successfully retrieving the messages.<ref name=guelphmercury2018-01-01/><ref name=guelphhistoricalsociety/><ref name=TorontoOldAndNew/><ref name=\"WLC376\">Clowes, p. 376</ref> For their bravery in diving from a rapidly moving ship into unknown waters, both men were granted annual pensions of \u00a320 (the equivalent of \u00a3{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|20|1798|r=-2}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}} Three days after the capture of ''L\u00e9g\u00e8re'', Captain Foley of ''Goliath'' sent a boat into the sheltered anchorage under Aboukir Castle, where his men boarded and captured the armed [[ketch]] [[French gun-vessel Torride (1797)|''Torride'']], typical of the gun-vessels that had fired on the British advance during the Battle of the Nile.<ref name=\"WJ192\">James, p. 192</ref> On 2 September, another dispatch vessel reached the Egyptian coast, the 4-gun [[cutter (ship)|cutter]] ''An\u00e9mone'' carrying General Camin and 60 men from Malta.<ref name=\"WLC376\"/> ''Swiftsure'' and ''Emerald'' managed to cut off the vessel from Alexandria harbour and drive it ashore near the town of Marabou. Although the cutter swiftly broke up in the surf, most of the men aboard managed to scramble ashore. There, while the British ships lay off shore unable to intervene, [[Bedouin]] [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] discovered the survivors and massacred them, dragging the few survivors inland before French cavalry could rescue them.<ref name=\"WJ193\">James, p. 193</ref> The only survivors were rescued by Lieutenant [[Francis William Fane]], who swam to shore with an empty barrel attached to a rope. Despite coming under fire from the French on the beach, he was able to save five men from the Bedouin attack.<ref name=\"WLC376\"/>\n\nIn October the small British squadron at Alexandria was briefly reinforced by a Portuguese squadron of four ships of the line and the 64-gun [[HMS Lion (1777)|HMS ''Lion'']] under Captain [[Manley Dixon]], although the Portuguese sailed for Malta after only a few days.<ref name=\"WJ193\"/> On 19 October the squadron was joined by two Turkish [[corvette]]s, two Russian frigates and 16 small Turkish gunboats, arranged by Hood on a visit to [[Rhodes]] in ''Swiftsure'' the week before.<ref name=\"WJ194\">James, p. 194</ref> The gunboats were subsequently used to bombard Aboukir Castle and a French encampment at Lake Maadie on 25 October, although results were negligible. After the first day the Turkish crews were replaced with British sailors, but except for a complaint from the French that \"unfair\" incendiary weapons were used in the attack, nothing was achieved. The incendiary shells subsequently proved to have been taken from the captured ''Spartiate'' following the battle on 1 August and were found to be made of a substance that burned even under water.<ref name=\"WJ194\"/> After three days the bombardment was abandoned and no further activity took place on the Egyptian coast during the remainder of the year. The Turkish and Russian vessels were eventually withdrawn in December, while ''Lion'' was detached to join the blockade of Malta.<ref name=\"WLC377\">Clowes, p. 377</ref>\n\n===Ionian Sea===\n{{main|French rule in the Ionian Islands (1797\u20131799)}}\nThe main Mediterranean fleets of the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire were deployed in the [[Ionian Sea]]. At the Treaty of Campo Formio, France had been awarded the [[Ionian Islands]] and the four fortresses of [[Butrinto]], [[Parga]], [[Preveza]] and [[Vonitsa|Vonizza]] on the Albanian and Greek coasts.<ref name=\"RG58\">Gardiner, p. 58</ref> In early October 1798, following the declaration of war between France and the Ottomans, a large Turkish army had advanced across the Balkans and rapidly forced the fortresses to surrender. At the same time, the Ionian Islands were attacked by a joint Russian and Turkish expeditionary force, which included ten Russian ships of the line, numerous smaller Russian vessels and approximately 30 assorted Turkish ships. On board were 8,000 Turkish soldiers, which rapidly invaded and seized the islands of [[Paxi]], [[Santa Maura]], [[Theaki]], [[Cephalonia]], [[Zante]] and [[Cerigo]], capturing 1,500 French prisoners by 10 October.<ref name=\"WJ190\">James, p. 190</ref> Only the large fortified island of Corfu held out, and there the defenders were forced back into the [[Corfu (city)|main town]]. Although the town was [[Siege of Corfu (1798\u20131799)|besieged]], operations were slow and the blockade was only loosely enforced, allowing ''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'' to successfully break out and reach [[Ancona]]. By the end of the year little had changed, the French garrison remaining besieged in Corfu.<ref name=\"WLC375\">Clowes, p. 375</ref>\n\n===Malta and Naples===\n{{main|Siege of Malta (1798\u20131800)}}\nFurther westwards, the newly captured French island of Malta was under a much more diligent blockade. The returning convoy from Aboukir Bay under Saumarez reached Malta in September. There he encountered a squadron of four [[Portuguese Navy|Portuguese]] ships of the line and the British ship ''Lion'' under the command of Tom\u00e1s Xavier Teles de Castro da Gama, [[Count of Vidigueira|Marquess de Niza]], initially sending them on to Alexandria.<ref name=\"WJ188\">James, p. 188</ref> While anchored off Malta awaiting favourable winds, a delegation of native Maltese citizens was brought on board Saumarez's ship ''Orion'' on 25 September. They announced that the Maltese people, infuriated with French disestablishment of the Roman Catholic Church on Malta, had risen up against the French garrison and were forcing them back towards the fortress of Valletta.<ref name=\"RG67\">Gardiner, p. 67</ref> Saumarez attempted to negotiate the surrender of the island with Vaubois, but was rebuffed. Unable to delay his passage to Gibraltar any longer, Saumarez gave the Maltese 1,200 muskets and promised to send assistance as soon as he was able.<ref name=\"WLC374\">Clowes, p. 374</ref> By 12 October, the French [[Siege of Malta (1798-1800)|were besieged in Valletta]] by 10,000 Maltese irregulars. Vaubois had only 3,000 healthy troops, although the arrival of Villeneuve with the ship of the line [[French ship Guillaume Tell (1795)|''Guillaume Tell'']] and two frigates did bolster his defences.<ref name=\"WJ189\">James, p. 189</ref>\n\nOn the same day that the French retreated to Valletta, Nelson despatched the ships ''Alexander'', ''Culloden'', and [[HMS Colossus (1787)|''Colossus'']] from his squadron at Naples to blockade the port, under the command of Captain Alexander Ball. Although the Neapolitans refused to deploy forces to Malta, which was technically their territory, the squadron was joined within a few days by Niza's Portuguese ships and then by Nelson, now Lord Nelson, in ''Vanguard'' on 24 October.<ref name=\"RG67\"/> Four days later, Nelson authorised Ball to negotiate the surrender of the nearby island of [[Gozo]]. The French abandoned the island's fortifications and the British captured 24 cannon and 3,200 urgently required sacks of grain, which were distributed among the Maltese populace. With the French garrison trapped in Valletta, no further actions took place off Malta during the year, both sides settling in for a long siege.<ref name=\"WJ189\"/>\n\nWhile his captains enforced the blockade of Malta and Alexandria during September and October, Nelson was anchored in the [[Bay of Naples]], enjoying the hospitality of [[Ferdinand IV of Naples|King Ferdinand]] and [[Maria Carolina of Austria|Queen Maria Carolina]] of the Kingdom of Naples. Arriving on 22 September, ''Vanguard'' was greeted with over 500 small vessels organised by the royal family and led by a barge carrying Sir William and Lady Emma Hamilton.<ref name=\"RG47\">Gardiner, p. 47</ref> Over the next weeks, Nelson was taken into the court as an honoured guest, and has subsequently been accused of neglecting his naval responsibilities.<ref name=\"RG47\"/> It was at this time that his mutual attraction to Lady Emma Hamilton developed into a romantic affair. He also began to dabble in Neapolitan politics, successfully combining with [[Maria Carolina of Austria|Maria Carolina]], the francophobe Queen, to encourage Ferdinand to go to war with France. Ferdinand ordered the Neapolitan army under General [[Karl Mack von Leiberich|Mack]] to drive the French out of Rome.<ref name=\"EB223\">Bradford, p. 223</ref>  The resulting campaign was a disaster for the Neapolitans; the French counterattacked and forced Ferdinand and his court to flee to [[Palermo]] in Sicily. The French established the [[Parthenopean Republic]] in Naples to replace the monarchy.<ref name=\"WLC375\"/>\n\n===Spain and Menorca===\n{{further|Capture of Menorca (1798)}}\n[[File:Lion and Dorotea.jpg|300px|thumb|''Capture of the Dorothea, 15 July 1798'', [[Thomas Whitcombe]], 1816|alt=A two decked ship fires from both sides as it is surrounded by four smaller ships, three on one side and one on the other]]\nWhile Nelson was engaged in the Central and Eastern Mediterranean, the main Mediterranean Fleet under Earl St Vincent had ensured that the Spanish Navy was unable to intervene. On 24 May St Vincent was joined at the Tagus by a reinforcement of eight ships under Rear-Admiral [[Roger Curtis|Sir Roger Curtis]], and the admiral ordered his ships to establish blockades off the southern Spanish ports, especially [[Cadiz]], where the main Spanish fleet lay at anchor.<ref name=\"WJ195\">James, p. 195</ref> There regular correspondence passed between St Vincent and Admiral Don [[Joseph Massaredo]], the Spanish commander.<ref name=\"WJ195\"/> The Spanish fleet made no major deployments during the year, except for a single convoy of the ship of the line [[Spanish ship Monarcha (1794)|''Monarca'']], two frigates and several merchant vessels that sailed in April.<ref name=\"WLC377\"/> Although privateers and minor warships fought several small engagements along the Spanish Mediterranean coast, the only significant Spanish deployment of the remainder of the year was by a frigate squadron based at [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]], which was intercepted by the British ship of the line ''Lion''.<ref name=\"LG1\">{{London Gazette|issue=15061|page=879|date=15 September 1798}}</ref> At the ensuing [[Action of 15 July 1798]], the Spanish ships formed a line to meet the attack of Captain Dixon's ship but the damaged frigate [[Spanish ship Santa Dorotea|''Santa Dorotea'']] fell behind the leading three frigates. As the leading ships returned to Catagena after a desultory long-range exchange of gunfire, ''Santa Dorotea'' was defeated and captured.<ref name=\"RG54\">Gardiner, p. 54</ref>\n\nOnce the French Mediterranean Fleet had been destroyed in Aboukir Bay, St Vincent was determined to restore British hegemony in the Mediterranean. To ensure this, his fleet needed a base with a well protected deep water harbour that could not be assaulted by land.<ref name=\"RG45\"/> The best island harbour in the Western Mediterranean was at [[Mah\u00f3n|Port Mahon]] on [[Menorca]], where a large modern dockyard included a careening wharf, extensive storehouses and a purpose-built naval hospital. These facilities were all British in manufacture, constructed during periods of occupation by British forces between 1708 \u2013 1756 and 1763 \u2013 1781.<ref name=\"RG45\">Gardiner, p. 45</ref> St Vincent therefore detached two ships of the line, three frigates and several smaller vessels and transports to the island under Commodore [[John Thomas Duckworth]], carrying a small army under Colonel [[Charles Stuart (1753\u20131801)|Charles Stuart]].<ref name=\"WJ196\">James, p. 196</ref> The expeditionary force arrived off Menorca on 7 November and the troops were landed at Addaya Creek. There a Spanish attack was driven off and over the next two days the army continued inland, a detachment under Colonel [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Henry Paget]] seizing Port Mahon while the main army received the surrender of town after town, including [[Fournella]], which overlooked the island's principal protected anchorage.<ref name=\"RG45\"/> On 11 November a Spanish squadron of four frigates attempted to disrupt operations, but a swift counterattack by Duckworth's ships drove them off. By 16 November the town of Ciudadella capitulated and control of the island was ceded to British forces.<ref name=\"WLC378\">Clowes, p. 378</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Cnote2 Begin|liststyle=upper-alpha}}\n{{Cnote2|Note A|'''Note A''': [[Richard Woodman]] suggests that Nelson deliberately allowed Bonaparte to sail from Toulon in order to have the opportunity to engage and destroy him at sea.<ref name=\"RW112\">Woodman, p. 112</ref> This is incorrect: as noted by [[Oliver Warner]], Nelson did not have the forces or the ability to intercept Bonaparte until 12 days after the French convoy had sailed.<ref name=\"OW50\">Warner, p. 50</ref> The same tactic has been suggested by historian Peter Padfield regarding [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]]'s intentions in the days before the [[Glorious First of June]] in 1794.<ref name=\"PP17\">Padfield, p. 17</ref>}}\n{{Cnote2 End}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=guelphmercury2018-01-01>\n{{cite news    \n| url         = https://www.guelphmercury.com/opinion-story/8027189-guelph-s-first-poet-played-bit-part-in-britain-s-war-with-napoleon/\n| title       = Guelph's first poet played bit part in Britain's war with Napoleon\n| work        = [[Guelph Mercury]]\n| author      = [[Ed Butts]]\n| date        = 2018-01-01\n| accessdate  = 2018-10-05\n| url-status     = live\n| quote       = On Aug. 22, the Alcmene intercepted the small French warship Legere.

The [[French First Republic|French Republic]] sought to capture Egypt as the first stage in an effort to threaten [[British India]] and support [[Tipu Sultan]], and thus force [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] to make peace. Departing [[Toulon]] in May 1798 with over 40,000 troops and hundreds of ships, Bonaparte's fleet sailed southeastwards across the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. They were followed by a small British squadron under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Horatio Nelson]], later reinforced to 13 [[ships of the line]], whose pursuit was hampered by a lack of scouting [[frigate]]s and reliable information. Bonaparte's first target was the island of [[Malta]], which was under the government of the [[Knights of St. John]] and theoretically granted its owner control of the Central Mediterranean. Bonaparte's forces landed on the island and rapidly overwhelmed the defenders, securing the port city of [[Valletta]] before continuing to Egypt. When Nelson learned of the French capture of the island, he guessed the French target to be Egypt and sailed for [[Alexandria]], but passed the French during the night of 22 June without discovering them and arrived off Egypt first.\n\nUnable to find Bonaparte, Nelson turned back across the Mediterranean, eventually reaching [[Sicily]] on 19 July. While Nelson was returning westwards, Bonaparte reached Alexandria and stormed the city, capturing the coast and marching his army inland. His fleet, entrusted to Vice-Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers]], was anchored in a [[line of battle]] in [[Aboukir Bay]]. On 1 August, Nelson, who had returned to the Egyptian coast after reports gathered at [[Koroni|Coron]] revealed the French invasion, arrived off Aboukir Bay. Although it was late afternoon and the British fleet had no accurate charts of the bay, Nelson ordered an immediate attack on the French [[:wikt:vanguard|van]]. Brueys was unprepared, and his ships were unable to manoeuvre as the British split into two divisions and sailed down either side of the French line, capturing all five ships of the vanguard and engaging his 120-gun flagship [[French ship Orient (1791)|''Orient'']] in the centre. At 21:00, ''Orient'' caught fire and exploded, killing most of the crew and ending the main combat. Sporadic fighting continued for the next two days, until all of the French ships had been captured, destroyed or fled. At the [[Battle of the Nile]], eleven French ships of the line and two frigates were eliminated, trapping Bonaparte in Egypt and changing the balance of power in the Mediterranean.\n\nWith the French Navy in the Mediterranean defeated, other nations were encouraged to join the [[Second Coalition]] and go to war with France. [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], the [[Kingdom of Naples]], the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] all subsequently deployed forces to the Mediterranean. The Russians and Turks participated in the blockade of Egypt and operations in the [[Adriatic Sea]] while the Portuguese joined the [[Siege of Malta (1798-1800)|Siege of Malta]], which was distantly conducted by Nelson from his lodgings in [[Naples]]. Nelson, who had been wounded at the Battle of the Nile, became involved in Neapolitan politics and encouraged [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|King Ferdinand]] to go to war with France, resulting in the loss of his mainland kingdom. In the Western Mediterranean, Vice-Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Earl St Vincent]], who commanded the Mediterranean fleet from off [[Cadiz]], deployed forces against [[Menorca]], rapidly captured the island and turned it into an important naval base.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Bonaparte's plan===\nAt the beginning of 1798, the [[War of the First Coalition]] had come to an end with French control of Northern Italy, much of the [[Low Countries]] and the [[Rhineland]] confirmed by the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]].<ref name=\"DC78\">Chandler, p. 78</ref> Of all the major European powers that had at one time allied against the [[First French Republic|French Republic]], only the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] remained hostile, and the [[French Directory]] determined to end the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] by eliminating Britain. A series of invasions of the [[British Isles]] were planned,<ref name=\"DC185\">Come, p. 185</ref> and the 28-year-old General [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], who had defeated the Austrians in Italy the previous year, was assigned to lead the ''Arm\u00e9e d'Angleterre'' (Army of England) that had been assembled at [[Boulogne]].<ref name=\"WJ113\">James, p. 113</ref> However, the [[English Channel]] was firmly controlled by the [[Royal Navy]] and French invasion supplies, particularly of viable [[landing craft]], were totally inadequate for the purpose.<ref name=\"RG107\">Gardiner, p. 107</ref>\n\nIn the early spring of 1798, Bonaparte left his command at Boulogne and returned to Paris, reporting that continued British naval supremacy in Northern European waters made an invasion impossible in the near future.<ref name=\"NM248\">Mostert, p. 248</ref> With operations to the north impossible, Bonaparte directed his attention southwards to [[Toulon]], the principal French seaport on the [[Mediterranean]]. There a French army and fleet had begun assembling for a secret location, speculated by French commentators to be aimed at a wide variety of places, including among others Britain, [[Sicily]], Malta and the [[Crimea]].<ref name=\"JC3\">Cole, p. 3</ref><ref name=\"SM230\">Maffeo, p. 230</ref> The expedition's intended target was actually [[Egypt]], which formed an important link in the chain of communications between Britain and the economically vital colony of [[British India]].<ref name=\"RLA7\">Adkins, p. 7</ref> Bonaparte considered the capture of Egypt as the most important step in neutralising the massive economic benefits that Britain gained from trade with India and bringing Britain to terms: in August 1797 he wrote \"The time is not far away that we will feel that, in order to truly destroy England, we must take Egypt.\"<ref name=\"JC14\">Cole, p. 13</ref> Possession of Egypt could grant the French control of the Eastern Mediterranean and the [[Red Sea]], forcing severe delays to dispatches sent between Britain and India and obstructing trade worth \u00a32.7 million (the equivalent of \u00a3{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|2700000|1798|r=-7}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}) to the British economy.{{Inflation-fn|UK}}<ref name=\"SM227\">Maffeo, p. 227</ref> In addition, a successful invasion of Egypt could be followed by a direct attack on British territory in India, possibly in conjunction with the anglophobic [[Tippoo Sultan]] of [[Seringapatam]].<ref name=\"OW41\">Warner, p. 41</ref> The French Mediterranean Fleet was unopposed at the start of 1798 \u2013 following the [[Second Treaty of San Ildefonso|Treaty of San Ildefonso]] in 1796, in which Spain formed an alliance with France and declared war on Britain, the Royal Navy had withdrawn from the Mediterranean bases of [[Corsica]] and [[Elba]].<ref name=\"JHR140\">Rose, p. 140</ref> By early 1798, their Mediterranean Fleet was based at the [[Tagus River]] in Portugal, their one remaining continental ally.<ref name=\"SM224\">Maffeo, p. 224</ref> With no permanent British fleet in the Mediterranean and [[Irish rebellion of 1798|an uprising]] imminent in Ireland, Bonaparte firmly believed that the Royal Navy would be unable to intervene in his plans, even if they should discover them.<ref name=\"JHR141\">Rose, p. 141</ref>\n\nWith passage to Egypt seemingly unopposed Bonaparte gave orders for a fleet of thirteen [[ships of the line]], led by the 120-gun [[French ship Orient|''Orient'']] under Vice-Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers]] and numerous smaller warships, including the entire Venetian Navy, captured the previous year, to prepare for sea.<ref name=\"RG20\">Gardiner, p. 20</ref> The fleet was to be accompanied by up to 400 [[transport ship]]s, which were to carry the 35,000 men detailed for the invasion.<ref name=\"WLC353\">Clowes, p. 353</ref>  On 3 May, Bonaparte departed Paris, arriving at Toulon five days later to oversee the final preparations. On 9 May he reviewed the assembled army and gave a speech announcing that the expedition was bound for an unspecified foreign land. The speech was met with an enthusiastic response from his soldiers and a revised version subsequently appeared in ''[[Le Moniteur Universel]]'' and was widely distributed throughout France as a poster.<ref name=\"JC5\">Cole, p. 5</ref>  Despite Bonaparte's pronouncement the French departure was delayed: a strong headwind prevented the fleet from sailing for another nine days, conditions finally lifting on 18 May that permitted the 22 warships and 120 transports that made up the French fleet to sail the following day.<ref name=\"WJ150\">James, p. 150</ref>\n\n===St. Vincent's response===\n[[File:HoratioNelson1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson'', [[Lemuel Francis Abbott]], 1800, [[National Maritime Museum]]|alt=Portrait of a man in an ornate naval uniform festooned with medals and awards.]]\nBritain was not unaware of French preparations at Toulon and along the Mediterranean coast, but despite sustained efforts by British agents in France the destination of the French fleet was unknown.<ref name=\"RLA8\">Adkins, p. 8</ref> Egypt was not seriously considered by the British government: when [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville|Henry Dundas]] suggested it, he was urged by [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|Lord Grenville]] to think \"with a map in your hand, and with a calculation of distances.\"<ref name=\"NR458\">Rodger, p. 458</ref> Letters reached London and St. Vincent at the Tagus describing extensive preparations right along the French and Italian Mediterranean coastlines, but the distances between the base in the Tagus and Toulon prevented any sustained observation of French movements.<ref name=\"SM234\">Maffeo, p. 234</ref> Urgent orders were sent from [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Lord Spencer]] at the [[Admiralty]] to Vice-Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Earl St. Vincent]], commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet at the Tagus, to despatch a squadron to investigate under the command of Rear-Admiral [[Horatio Nelson|Sir Horatio Nelson]]. Nelson had returned to the fleet three days earlier at Lord Spencer's order,<ref name=\"EB169\">Bradford, p. 169</ref> following recovery in Britain from the loss of an arm at the [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797)|Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] in July 1797.<ref name=\"RG18\">Gardiner, p. 18</ref>\n\nSt. Vincent had already been preparing for an expedition to Toulon with Nelson in mind, and the rear-admiral departed the Tagus in his flagship [[HMS Vanguard (1787)|HMS ''Vanguard'']] on 2 May. St Vincent was overjoyed to be able to place Nelson in command of the mission, writing that \"the arrival of Admiral Nelson has given me new life ... his presence in the Mediterranean is so very essential\".<ref name=\"EB170\">Bradford, p. 170</ref> His preference for Nelson over the more senior admirals [[Sir William Parker, 1st Baronet, of Harburn|Sir William Parker]] and [[Sir John Orde, 1st Baronet|Sir John Orde]] provoked a storm of protest, which eventually culminated in Orde challenging St Vincent to a duel,<ref name=\"NM255\">Mostert, p. 255</ref> and being subsequently ordered to return to Britain.<ref name=\"OW45\">Warner, p. 45</ref> On 9 May Nelson collected the ships of the line [[HMS Alexander (1778)|HMS ''Alexander'']] and [[HMS Orion (1787)|HMS ''Orion'']] under Captains [[Alexander John Ball|Alexander Ball]] and [[James Saumarez|Sir James Saumarez]] the frigates [[HMS Emerald (1795)|HMS ''Emerald'']] and [[HMS Terpsichore (1785)|HMS ''Terpsichore'']] under Captains [[Thomas Moutray Waller]] and [[William Hall Gage]] and the [[sloop]] [[HMS Bonne Citoyenne|HMS ''Bonne Citoyenne'']] under Captain [[Robert Retalick]] at [[Gibraltar]], and passed into the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"WLC351\">Clowes, p. 351</ref> Despite leaving under cover of darkness,<ref name=\"EB172\">Bradford, p. 172</ref> Nelson's departure was observed by Spanish forces at Cadiz, and the fort at Cape Carnero fired several shot, striking ''Alexander'' but inflicting negligible damage.<ref name=\"JK41\">Keegan, p. 41</ref>\n\nOn 17 May ''Terpsichore'' captured the [[privateer]] ''La Pierre'' off [[Cape Sici\u00e9]], and from the crew Nelson learned that Bonaparte's departure was imminent, although the destination was still unknown.<ref name=\"SM239\">Maffeo, p. 239</ref> On 21 May, as his squadron reached the [[\u00celes d'Hy\u00e8res]] near Toulon, they were struck by strong winds that snapped ''Vanguard''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s topmasts and brought the wreckage down onto the deck, killing two men.<ref name=\"JK41\"/> ''Vanguard'' was left struggling in heavy seas, blown {{convert|75|nmi|km}} southwards in one night.<ref name=\"EB173\">Bradford, p. 173</ref> So severe was the damage that ''Vanguard'' was almost wrecked on the Corsican coast on the following day and Nelson even ordered Captain Ball, who had managed to attach a towline to the flagship, to abandon him.<ref name=\"PP112\">Padfield, p. 112</ref> Ball refused the order and the British ships of the line rode out the storm together.<ref name=\"NM250\">Mostert, p. 250</ref> Although ''Alexander'' was able to tow ''Vanguard'' to [[San Pietro Island]] off [[Sardinia]] for repairs, the gale had forced the squadron's frigates to separate from the larger ships.<ref name=\"PP113\">Padfield, p. 113</ref>\n\nThomas Waller on ''Emerald'' was divided from the other frigates, and his lookouts had observed ''Vanguard'' in its dismasted state at the height of the storm. The other two frigates had reefed their sails and ridden out the storm together, Captain Gage turning towards the Spanish coast when the storm abated and on 29 May encountered [[HMS Alcmene (1794)|HMS ''Alcmene'']] under Captain [[George Johnstone Hope]], which had been sent by St. Vincent to augment Nelson's force. Two days later Hope's squadron encountered ''Emerald'', which had captured two merchant ships, and together they sailed for the prearranged rendezvous point {{convert|60|mi|km}} off Cape St. Sebastian near [[Barcelona]].<ref name=\"JK45\">Keegan, p. 45</ref> Hope ordered ''Terpsichore'' and ''Bonne Citoyenne'' to cruise off Sardinia and on 3 June encountered the brig [[HMS Mutine (1797)|HMS ''Mutine'']] under Captain [[Thomas Masterman Hardy|Thomas Hardy]], the scout of a fleet sent by Earl St. Vincent that was approaching the rendezvous. Knowing of the damaged suffered by ''Vanguard'' and aware that the French had left Toulon, Hope then took the unilateral decision to search for the French himself, dispersing the frigates across the Western Mediterranean.<ref name=\"JK47\">Keegan, p. 47</ref> Hope's ships failed to find either the British or French fleets and none of the frigates returned to Nelson's command until after the Battle of the Nile.<ref name=\"SM241\">Maffeo, p. 241</ref>\n\n==Malta==\n[[File:Nap malta.jpg|thumb|Napoleon's arrival in Malta]]\nDeparting Toulon on 19 May, Bonaparte's fleet passed along the coast of [[Provence]] to [[Genoa]], where 72 additional transport ships were collected.<ref name=\"JK40\">Keegan, p. 40</ref> Sailing south, the fleet reached Corsica on 23 May and collected a fleet of 22 transports from [[Ajaccio]] on 28 May.<ref name=\"RLA11\">Adkins, p. 11</ref> The convoy remained within sight of the eastern coastline until 30 May, crossing the [[Strait of Bonifacio]] and following the coastline of [[Sardinia]] in anticipation of combining with fleets of transports sailing from [[Civitavecchia]].<ref name=\"WLC353\"/> On 3 June, a message reached Bonaparte reporting the presence of Nelson's squadron at San Pietro and the French general sent a French squadron to investigate, although by that time Nelson had sailed and the harbour was empty.<ref name=\"WJ150\"/> Abandoning the wait for the Civitavecchia force, which had still not arrived, Bonaparte gave orders for his fleet to turn southeast, passing [[Mazara]] on Sicily and the island of [[Pantelleria]] on 7 June. There a report from a captured British merchant brig warned Bonaparte that Nelson was only a short distance behind his force with a powerful Royal Navy fleet and, concerned for his transports, Bonaparte gave urgent orders for the French fleet to steer for Malta, arriving off [[Valletta]] at 05:30 on 9 June, shortly after uniting with the 56 ships of the Civitavecchia convoy, which had missed the rendezvous and continued to Malta alone.<ref name=\"WJ150\"/><ref name=\"SM259\">Maffeo, p. 259</ref>\n\nThe report on Nelson's activity submitted to Bonaparte on 7 June was inaccurate: Repairs to ''Vanguard'' in San Pietro took six days, the squadron sailing on 27 May for Toulon, arriving off the harbour on 31 May.<ref name=\"WLC354\">Clowes, p. 354</ref>{{Cref2|Note A}} Nelson had already learned of the departure of the French fleet from a captured [[Marseilles]] merchant ship, but without reinforcements or knowledge of the French direction he could not begin a pursuit.<ref name=\"JK44\">Keegan, p. 44</ref> On 5 June, the brig HMS ''Mutine'' arrived off Toulon and reported that a British fleet was only a few days away, consisting of ten ships of the line and a [[fourth rate]] sent by Earl St Vincent from the Tagus on 24 May under Captain [[Sir Thomas Troubridge, 1st Baronet|Thomas Troubridge]] in [[HMS Culloden (1783)|HMS ''Culloden'']].<ref name=\"WJ152\">James, p. 152</ref> St Vincent, acting under urgent orders from London to send a fleet to the Mediterranean had opted to split his forces, rather than risk taking all of his ships into the Mediterranean and leaving the Spanish at Cadiz unattended. Troubridge was considered by St Vincent to be the best officer in the fleet, and Nelson, who also held a high opinion of Troubridge, immediately sailed his squadron to the scheduled rendezvous point.<ref name=\"EB175\">Bradford, p. 175</ref> On 6 June, his squadron briefly intercepted a Spanish merchant convoy and capturing two ships before the admiral called off the pursuit to ensure he arrived at the agreed time. On 7 June at 12:00 the fleets combined, Nelson now commanding 13 74-gun ships of the line, one 50-gun ship and one brig.<ref name=\"SM243\">Maffeo, p. 243</ref> Noticeable by their absence were frigates, vital for scouting operations in a campaign of this nature; After his encounter with Hope, Hardy reported to Nelson that the frigates were cruising independently, to which the admiral bitterly responded \"I had thought that Hope would have known me better\".<ref name=\"NM251\">Mostert, p. 251</ref>\n\n===Nelson's search===\nDelayed until 10 June by a calm and still unaware of French intentions, Nelson initially sailed along the Corsican coast, before anchoring at Elba on 12 June and sending ''Mutine'' into Civitavecchia for information. Hardy was unable to discover the French destination and, after a detour to Elba with his whole fleet, Nelson continued south.<ref name=\"JK48\">Keegan, p. 48</ref> Two days later, the admiral spoke with a Tunisian ship at [[Giannutri]], which passed on the inaccurate information that the French had been seen off [[Trapani]],<ref name=\"NM253\">Mostert, p. 253</ref> and might be anchored at [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].<ref name=\"WLC355\">Clowes, p. 355</ref> On 17 June Nelson anchored at the [[Pontine Islands]] off [[Naples]] and sent Troubridge ashore to appeal to the British ambassador [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]] for information and for the assistance of the Neapolitan Navy in scouting for the French. Although the Neapolitan Prime Minister [[Sir John Acton, 6th Baronet|Sir John Acton]] had already passed on reports that the French were sailing for Egypt, Hamilton did not give the report to Nelson, possibly suspicious of [[disinformation]].<ref name=\"JK50\">Keegan, p. 50</ref> Hamilton did however relay the information that Bonaparte's fleet had passed Sardinia and were probably sailing in the direction of Malta. Despite private animosity towards France,<ref name=\"OW55\">Warner, p. 55</ref> the Neapolitan government refused to openly join the British in the war and denied Nelson the use of their frigates,<ref name=\"EB176\">Bradford, p. 176</ref> although they did quietly agree to resupply Nelson's fleet.<ref name=\"NM253\"/> With a rough direction established and believing the ultimate French destination to be Sicily,<ref name=\"EB177\">Bradford, p. 177</ref> Nelson sailed in pursuit, but light winds hampered his advances and he did not pass the [[Straits of Messina]] until 20 June. There he received a report from the ambassador at [[Messina]] that the French were at Malta.<ref name=\"NM254\"/> Then on 22 June near [[Cape Passaro]], Hardy stopped a Genoese ship from [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]] that reported seeing the French fleet sailing southwards away from Malta, and that they had left Valletta on 16 June.<ref name=\"RG29\">Gardiner, p. 29</ref> This information was wrong (or mistranslated) in one important respect: although preparations had begun on 16 June the French had actually not departed until 19 June,<ref name=\"EB181\">Bradford, p. 181</ref> and Nelson's fleet was just {{convert|60|nmi|km}} away from Brueys'.<ref name=\"NR459\">Rodger, p. 459</ref> Nelson decided that the French target must be Egypt or [[Constantinople]] and called his senior captains: Saumarez, Ball, Troubridge and [[Henry D'Esterre Darby|Henry Darby]] on board ''Vanguard'' for a conference.<ref name=\"NM254\"/> Together these officers determined Egypt as the most likely option, deducing that it was the best location in the Mediterranean from which Bonaparte could threaten India.<ref name=\"PP114\">Padfield, p. 114</ref> Consequently, Nelson turned southeast towards [[Alexandria]], exercising his men's gunnery daily to ensure they were ready for the battle he planned.<ref name=\"WJ154\"/> His plan should his force encounter the French was clear: dividing into three squadrons, his fleet would strike the French at three points. Two squadrons of five ships each would engage the French fleet directly while the third would separate and attack the transports, sinking or capturing as many as possible.<ref name=\"WJ153\">James, p. 153</ref> Nelson also deliberately forged close links with his captains at regular dinners aboard his flagship to ensure ease of communication and build confidence between them.

Arriving off Malta on 9 June, he demanded that the island's ruler, [[Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim]], the [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master]] of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] (or Knights of St. John of Jerusalem) to allow his fleet to enter the harbour and purchase provisions.<ref name=\"JC8\">Cole, p. 8</ref>  Hompesch refused, insisting that only two ships at a time could enter the port. Bonaparte responded by opening fire on the harbour defences and on 11 June landed soldiers at seven sites around Malta under General [[Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers]]. Coming under fire from the 2,000 native Maltese soldiers that mustered against the invasion, skirmishing continued in the western part of the island for 24 hours, until General [[Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois]] entered [[Mdina]] and the defenders withdrew to the [[Fortifications of Valletta|fortress of Valletta]].<ref name=\"JC9\">Cole, p. 9</ref> The Maltese troops refused to continue the fight without support from their government,<ref name=\"OW29\">Warner, p. 29</ref> and negotiations followed in which Hompesch and the knights agreed to abandon Malta on condition of financial compensation amounting to 3 million [[Francs]].<ref name=\"JC10\"/> In exchange, Bonaparte gained the entire Maltese archipelago, including fortresses, military stores and cannon, the small Maltese Navy and Army and the entire property of the Roman Catholic Church in Malta.<ref name=\"RG21\">Gardiner, p. 21</ref>\n\nThe Maltese position had already been severely weakened by the large number of Frenchmen who were part of the Order, who refused ''en masse'' to take up arms against Bonaparte. The [[French Revolution]] had already significantly reduced the Knights' income and their ability to put up serious resistance to Bonaparte was seriously compromised by a lack of resources.<ref name=\"JC10\">Cole, p. 10</ref> On 12 June, Bonaparte finally announced to his troops the destination of the expedition and on 19 June he sailed for Alexandria, initially steering east towards [[Crete]]. He left behind Vaubois and 4,000 men to maintain Malta as a base to control the Central Mediterranean.<ref name=\"RLA13\">Adkins, p. 13</ref> To ensure that news of the impending attack on Egypt did not spread ahead of the fleet, Brueys ordered that any merchant ships that sighted the convoy during the passage were to be seized and detained until his force had reached Alexandria.<ref name=\"SM256\">Maffeo, p. 256</ref> On 26 June, the British gained the first firm intelligence of French intentions, when the frigate [[HMS Seahorse (1794)|HMS ''Seahorse'']] under Captain [[Edward Foote]] [[Action of 27 June 1798|encountered and captured]] the French frigate [[French frigate Sensible (1788)|''Sensible'']], which was returning to Toulon from Malta with a cargo of treasure and wounded soldiers, including General d'Hilliers.<ref name=\"WJ208\">James, p. 208</ref> From these prisoners the destination of the French fleet was discovered and ''Seahorse'', joined shortly afterwards by ''Terpsichore'', sailed in pursuit, hoping to encounter Nelson.<ref name=\"WJ160\">James, p. 160</ref>\n\n==Arrivals at Alexandria==\nNelson's passage from Sicily to Alexandria was uneventful, the journey taking six days. Due to his lack of frigates, Nelson was unable to scout to the flanks of his advance and as a result only spoke with three merchant ships, none of which had useful information about the French fleet.<ref name=\"WJ154\">James, p. 154</ref> The lack of frigates had already had a decisive effect on 22 June, when the British fleet sighted four sails to the southeast.<ref name=\"NM254\">Mostert, p. 254</ref> Although Captain [[Sir Thomas Thompson, 1st Baronet|Thomas Thompson]] of [[HMS Leander (1780)|HMS ''Leander'']] requested permission to investigate the strangers, Nelson refused and ordered his fleet to continue on their current heading, believing the French to be five days ahead and wishing to reach Alexandria as rapidly as possible.<ref name=\"JK56\">Keegan, p. 56</ref> Had British frigates been available to approach and investigate the distant squadron, they might have discovered that they were scouts for the main French fleet, which was only a short distance away.<ref name=\"RLA14\">Adkins, p. 14</ref> The French frigate had sighted the British fleet and reported its presence to Bonaparte, who adjusted his convoy's direction slightly to a more northerly trajectory.<ref name=\"EB182\">Bradford, p. 182</ref> As a result, Nelson's fleet passed north of the French to the east of Malta during the night in a heavy mist. Although Nelson was so close that his signal guns could be heard aboard ''Orient'', his lookouts did not observe the French ships and the British fleet continued ahead without deviating.<ref name=\"SM258\">Maffeo, p. 258</ref> When dawn broke the following day, Bonaparte's diversion to the northeast had taken his convoy out of sight of the British fleet, which continued to the southeast undisturbed.<ref name=\"EB185\">Bradford, p. 185</ref> On 28 June, ''Mutine''  arrived at Alexandria ahead of Nelson's fleet, and discovered that the French fleet was not in the harbour.<ref name=\"OW58\">Warner, p. 58</ref> Once the main fleet had arrived, attempts were made to contact the British Consul [[George Baldwin (diplomat)|George Baldwin]], but these failed as he had been dismissed by the British government shortly before and had left the city.<ref name=\"ODNB\">{{cite journal |last= Mew|first=James |month= |title=Baldwin, George |journal=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |id= |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1165|accessdate=26 November 2009 |quote= }}</ref> As a result, official diplomatic channels were closed to Nelson.<ref name=\"EB188\">Bradford, p. 188</ref> A message warning of the French approach was carried to the Ottoman governor Sayyid Muhammad Kurayyim by Hardy in ''Mutine''.

Soldiers were landed in the region of the Mirabou Creek, although the appearance of a sail to the east was mistaken for a scout from the British fleet and caused momentary panic, Bonaparte reportedly exclaiming: ''\"Fortune, m'abandonnerais-tu? Quoi! Seulement cinq jours!\"'' (Fortune, wilt thou abandon me? What! Only five days!). The newcomer was eventually revealed to be the French frigate ''[[French frigate Justice (1794)|Justice]]'' sent from Malta, and the invasion continued unopposed.<ref name=\"WJ156\">James, p. 156</ref> By evening the landing had been completed, although several boats had been wrecked in the surf and Bonaparte himself estimated that at least 20 men had drowned.<ref name=\"RLA17\">Adkins, p. 17</ref>\n\nOn 2 July, Bonaparte led his men to victory in the brief [[Battle of Alexandria (1798)|Battle of Alexandria]] and secured the city. He placed General [[Jean Baptiste Kl\u00e9ber]] in command with Rear-Admiral [[Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley]] in charge of the harbour.<ref name=\"WJ156\"/> Finding that entrances to the anchorage were too shallow to accommodate the main body of the French fleet, Bonaparte ordered Brueys to sail his squadron to the wider [[Aboukir Bay]], {{convert|20|mi|km}} northeast of Alexandria. Brueys was instructed that if he considered the anchorage to be unsafe then he was to sail for Corfu, leaving only a small light force that could anchor comfortably in Alexandria.<ref name=\"NM257\">Mostert, p. 257</ref> There Brueys held a conference with his officers to decide on their response should Nelson discover them in the bay. Although Rear-Admiral [[Armand Blanquet du Chayla|Armand Blanquet]] of [[French ship Franklin (1797)|''Franklin'']] argued that the fleet was safest sailing out to meet the British, he was outvoted and overruled, Brueys ordering that the ships remain anchored in [[line of battle]] to receive the British attack.<ref name=\"WJ159\">James, p. 159</ref> On 21 July, the frigates ''Seahorse'' and ''Terpsichore'' arrived at Alexandria and observed the French dispositions while flying [[French tricolour|French colours]] to confuse observers from the shore. With no sign of Nelson, Foote and Hall turned back westwards in search of the admiral.<ref name=\"WJ160\"/> When Brueys learned that British frigates had been seen off the Egyptian coast, he decided that the retreat of these vessels signified that there was no danger of imminent attack by a British force and therefore failed to take precautions against attack.<ref name=\"OW65\">Warner, p. 65</ref>\n\n===Nelson returns===\nNelson, having sailed northeast on the same day that the first French ships arrived off Alexandria, had reached [[Anatolia]] on 4 July and turned westward against the wind, sailing for Sicily again.<ref name=\"EB192\">Bradford, p. 192</ref>  His ships were briefly scattered by a storm on 5 July, before reconstituting the following day and on 18 July the British fleet reached Cape Passaro again and on 19 July Nelson's force anchored in Syracuse to take on fresh provisions supplied in part by [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]], the wife of the ambassador to Naples.<ref name=\"WLC355\"/> Frustrated, Nelson wrote in a letter to his wife [[Frances Nelson|Fanny]]; \"Every moment I have to regret the frigates having left me, to which must be attributed my ignorance of the movements of the enemy.\"<ref name=\"NM258\">Mostert, p. 258</ref> Reports subsequently reached the British fleet at Syracuse that the French had not been seen in the Eastern Mediterranean, in the [[Adriatic]] or in the [[Aegean Sea]], leaving either Egypt or Syria as the only likely destinations.<ref name=\"EB195\">Bradford, p. 195</ref>  Sailing once more on 25 July, Nelson turned his ships east once again sailing for Morea and sending Troubridge in ''Culloden'' into [[Koroni|Coron]] on 28 July for news.<ref name=\"SM266\">Maffeo, p. 266</ref> The Ottoman governor reported that the French had been seen sailing southwards from Crete at the start of the month and presented Troubridge with a French merchant ship that was anchored in the harbour.<ref name=\"OW62\">Warner, p. 62</ref> With their first definite sighting of the French, the British fleet turned southwards towards Alexandria.<ref name=\"RG30\">Gardiner, p. 30</ref>\n\n==Battle of the Nile==\n{{dablink|For more details on this topic, see [[Battle of the Nile]].}}\nOn 1 August, Nelson's fleet reached the Egyptian coast, the ships [[HMS Swiftsure (1787)|HMS ''Swiftsure'']] and [[HMS Alexander (1778)|HMS ''Alexander'']] detached as scouts to investigate Alexandria harbour.

He believed that Nelson would anchor off the bay and attack in the morning, giving Brueys time to prepare and leaving open the option of simply sailing away during the night, following Bonaparte's orders to avoid a direct confrontation with the British fleet.<ref name=\"WJ161\">James, p. 161</ref>\n\n===Nelson's attack===\n[[File:Battle of the Nile, Whitcombe2.jpg|thumb|300px|''Battle of the Nile, Augt 1st 1798'', [[Thomas Whitcombe]], 1816.

Rather than place his lead ship ''Guerrier'' close to the northern shoal, the French admiral had left a gap, widened by the order for the French fleet to only anchor by the bow which meant that they drifted significantly, between ''Guerrier'' and the shoals.<ref name=\"RLA24\"/> Sailing directly through this gap, Foley [[raking fire|raked]] ''Guerrier'' and engaged the second ship of the French line, ''Conqu\u00e9rant''.<ref name=\"NM266\">Mostert, p. 266</ref> ''Zealous'' also passed through the gap and attacked ''Guerrier'', and was followed by [[HMS Orion (1787)|HMS ''Orion'']], [[HMS Theseus (1786)|HMS ''Theseus'']] and [[HMS Audacious (1785)|HMS ''Audacious'']], all of which opened up a fierce fire on the first four French ships against their unprepared [[port (nautical)|port]] sides.<ref name=\"WJ165\">James, p. 165</ref>\n\nNelson followed in ''Vanguard'', bringing the next two ships into action with the [[starboard]] side of the French van, catching the French ships in a crossfire that rapidly battered and dismasted the ships, despite determined defence.<ref name=\"WLC362\">Clowes, p. 362</ref> As the French van was destroyed, [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS ''Bellerophon'']] and [[HMS Majestic (1785)|HMS ''Majestic'']] attacked the French centre.

Although the cutter swiftly broke up in the surf, most of the men aboard managed to scramble ashore. There, while the British ships lay off shore unable to intervene, [[Bedouin]] [[Partisan (military)|partisans]] discovered the survivors and massacred them, dragging the few survivors inland before French cavalry could rescue them.<ref name=\"WJ193\">James, p. 193</ref> The only survivors were rescued by Lieutenant [[Francis William Fane]], who swam to shore with an empty barrel attached to a rope. Despite coming under fire from the French on the beach, he was able to save five men from the Bedouin attack.<ref name=\"WLC376\"/>\n\nIn October the small British squadron at Alexandria was briefly reinforced by a Portuguese squadron of four ships of the line and the 64-gun [[HMS Lion (1777)|HMS ''Lion'']] under Captain [[Manley Dixon]], although the Portuguese sailed for Malta after only a few days.<ref name=\"WJ193\"/> On 19 October the squadron was joined by two Turkish [[corvette]]s, two Russian frigates and 16 small Turkish gunboats, arranged by Hood on a visit to [[Rhodes]] in ''Swiftsure'' the week before.<ref name=\"WJ194\">James, p. 194</ref> The gunboats were subsequently used to bombard Aboukir Castle and a French encampment at Lake Maadie on 25 October, although results were negligible. After the first day the Turkish crews were replaced with British sailors, but except for a complaint from the French that \"unfair\" incendiary weapons were used in the attack, nothing was achieved. The incendiary shells subsequently proved to have been taken from the captured ''Spartiate'' following the battle on 1 August and were found to be made of a substance that burned even under water.<ref name=\"WJ194\"/> After three days the bombardment was abandoned and no further activity took place on the Egyptian coast during the remainder of the year. The Turkish and Russian vessels were eventually withdrawn in December, while ''Lion'' was detached to join the blockade of Malta.<ref name=\"WLC377\">Clowes, p. 377</ref>\n\n===Ionian Sea===\n{{main|French rule in the Ionian Islands (1797\u20131799)}}\nThe main Mediterranean fleets of the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire were deployed in the [[Ionian Sea]]. At the Treaty of Campo Formio, France had been awarded the [[Ionian Islands]] and the four fortresses of [[Butrinto]], [[Parga]], [[Preveza]] and [[Vonitsa|Vonizza]] on the Albanian and Greek coasts.<ref name=\"RG58\">Gardiner, p. 58</ref> In early October 1798, following the declaration of war between France and the Ottomans, a large Turkish army had advanced across the Balkans and rapidly forced the fortresses to surrender. At the same time, the Ionian Islands were attacked by a joint Russian and Turkish expeditionary force, which included ten Russian ships of the line, numerous smaller Russian vessels and approximately 30 assorted Turkish ships. On board were 8,000 Turkish soldiers, which rapidly invaded and seized the islands of [[Paxi]], [[Santa Maura]], [[Theaki]], [[Cephalonia]], [[Zante]] and [[Cerigo]], capturing 1,500 French prisoners by 10 October.<ref name=\"WJ190\">James, p. 190</ref> Only the large fortified island of Corfu held out, and there the defenders were forced back into the [[Corfu (city)|main town]]. Although the town was [[Siege of Corfu (1798\u20131799)|besieged]], operations were slow and the blockade was only loosely enforced, allowing ''G\u00e9n\u00e9reux'' to successfully break out and reach [[Ancona]]. By the end of the year little had changed, the French garrison remaining besieged in Corfu.<ref name=\"WLC375\">Clowes, p. 375</ref>\n\n===Malta and Naples===\n{{main|Siege of Malta (1798\u20131800)}}\nFurther westwards, the newly captured French island of Malta was under a much more diligent blockade. The returning convoy from Aboukir Bay under Saumarez reached Malta in September. There he encountered a squadron of four [[Portuguese Navy|Portuguese]] ships of the line and the British ship ''Lion'' under the command of Tom\u00e1s Xavier Teles de Castro da Gama, [[Count of Vidigueira|Marquess de Niza]], initially sending them on to Alexandria.<ref name=\"WJ188\">James, p. 188</ref> While anchored off Malta awaiting favourable winds, a delegation of native Maltese citizens was brought on board Saumarez's ship ''Orion'' on 25 September. They announced that the Maltese people, infuriated with French disestablishment of the Roman Catholic Church on Malta, had risen up against the French garrison and were forcing them back towards the fortress of Valletta.<ref name=\"RG67\">Gardiner, p. 67</ref> Saumarez attempted to negotiate the surrender of the island with Vaubois, but was rebuffed. Unable to delay his passage to Gibraltar any longer, Saumarez gave the Maltese 1,200 muskets and promised to send assistance as soon as he was able.<ref name=\"WLC374\">Clowes, p. 374</ref> By 12 October, the French [[Siege of Malta (1798-1800)|were besieged in Valletta]] by 10,000 Maltese irregulars. Vaubois had only 3,000 healthy troops, although the arrival of Villeneuve with the ship of the line [[French ship Guillaume Tell (1795)|''Guillaume Tell'']] and two frigates did bolster his defences.<ref name=\"WJ189\">James, p. 189</ref>\n\nOn the same day that the French retreated to Valletta, Nelson despatched the ships ''Alexander'', ''Culloden'', and [[HMS Colossus (1787)|''Colossus'']] from his squadron at Naples to blockade the port, under the command of Captain Alexander Ball. Although the Neapolitans refused to deploy forces to Malta, which was technically their territory, the squadron was joined within a few days by Niza's Portuguese ships and then by Nelson, now Lord Nelson, in ''Vanguard'' on 24 October.<ref name=\"RG67\"/> Four days later, Nelson authorised Ball to negotiate the surrender of the nearby island of [[Gozo]]. The French abandoned the island's fortifications and the British captured 24 cannon and 3,200 urgently required sacks of grain, which were distributed among the Maltese populace. With the French garrison trapped in Valletta, no further actions took place off Malta during the year, both sides settling in for a long siege.<ref name=\"WJ189\"/>\n\nWhile his captains enforced the blockade of Malta and Alexandria during September and October, Nelson was anchored in the [[Bay of Naples]], enjoying the hospitality of [[Ferdinand IV of Naples|King Ferdinand]] and [[Maria Carolina of Austria|Queen Maria Carolina]] of the Kingdom of Naples. Arriving on 22 September, ''Vanguard'' was greeted with over 500 small vessels organised by the royal family and led by a barge carrying Sir William and Lady Emma Hamilton.<ref name=\"RG47\">Gardiner, p. 47</ref> Over the next weeks, Nelson was taken into the court as an honoured guest, and has subsequently been accused of neglecting his naval responsibilities.<ref name=\"RG47\"/> It was at this time that his mutual attraction to Lady Emma Hamilton developed into a romantic affair. He also began to dabble in Neapolitan politics, successfully combining with [[Maria Carolina of Austria|Maria Carolina]], the francophobe Queen, to encourage Ferdinand to go to war with France. Ferdinand ordered the Neapolitan army under General [[Karl Mack von Leiberich|Mack]] to drive the French out of Rome.<ref name=\"EB223\">Bradford, p. 223</ref>  The resulting campaign was a disaster for the Neapolitans; the French counterattacked and forced Ferdinand and his court to flee to [[Palermo]] in Sicily. The French established the [[Parthenopean Republic]] in Naples to replace the monarchy.<ref name=\"WLC375\"/>\n\n===Spain and Menorca===\n{{further|Capture of Menorca (1798)}}\n[[File:Lion and Dorotea.jpg|300px|thumb|''Capture of the Dorothea, 15 July 1798'', [[Thomas Whitcombe]], 1816|alt=A two decked ship fires from both sides as it is surrounded by four smaller ships, three on one side and one on the other]]\nWhile Nelson was engaged in the Central and Eastern Mediterranean, the main Mediterranean Fleet under Earl St Vincent had ensured that the Spanish Navy was unable to intervene. On 24 May St Vincent was joined at the Tagus by a reinforcement of eight ships under Rear-Admiral [[Roger Curtis|Sir Roger Curtis]], and the admiral ordered his ships to establish blockades off the southern Spanish ports, especially [[Cadiz]], where the main Spanish fleet lay at anchor.<ref name=\"WJ195\">James, p. 195</ref> There regular correspondence passed between St Vincent and Admiral Don [[Joseph Massaredo]], the Spanish commander.<ref name=\"WJ195\"/> The Spanish fleet made no major deployments during the year, except for a single convoy of the ship of the line [[Spanish ship Monarcha (1794)|''Monarca'']], two frigates and several merchant vessels that sailed in April.<ref name=\"WLC377\"/> Although privateers and minor warships fought several small engagements along the Spanish Mediterranean coast, the only significant Spanish deployment of the remainder of the year was by a frigate squadron based at [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]], which was intercepted by the British ship of the line ''Lion''.<ref name=\"LG1\">{{London Gazette|issue=15061|page=879|date=15 September 1798}}</ref> At the ensuing [[Action of 15 July 1798]], the Spanish ships formed a line to meet the attack of Captain Dixon's ship but the damaged frigate [[Spanish ship Santa Dorotea|''Santa Dorotea'']] fell behind the leading three frigates. As the leading ships returned to Catagena after a desultory long-range exchange of gunfire, ''Santa Dorotea'' was defeated and captured.<ref name=\"RG54\">Gardiner, p. 54</ref>\n\nOnce the French Mediterranean Fleet had been destroyed in Aboukir Bay, St Vincent was determined to restore British hegemony in the Mediterranean. To ensure this, his fleet needed a base with a well protected deep water harbour that could not be assaulted by land.<ref name=\"RG45\"/> The best island harbour in the Western Mediterranean was at [[Mah\u00f3n|Port Mahon]] on [[Menorca]], where a large modern dockyard included a careening wharf, extensive storehouses and a purpose-built naval hospital. These facilities were all British in manufacture, constructed during periods of occupation by British forces between 1708 \u2013 1756 and 1763 \u2013 1781.<ref name=\"RG45\">Gardiner, p. 45</ref> St Vincent therefore detached two ships of the line, three frigates and several smaller vessels and transports to the island under Commodore [[John Thomas Duckworth]], carrying a small army under Colonel [[Charles Stuart (1753\u20131801)|Charles Stuart]].<ref name=\"WJ196\">James, p. 196</ref> The expeditionary force arrived off Menorca on 7 November and the troops were landed at Addaya Creek. There a Spanish attack was driven off and over the next two days the army continued inland, a detachment under Colonel [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Henry Paget]] seizing Port Mahon while the main army received the surrender of town after town, including [[Fournella]], which overlooked the island's principal protected anchorage.<ref name=\"RG45\"/> On 11 November a Spanish squadron of four frigates attempted to disrupt operations, but a swift counterattack by Duckworth's ships drove them off. By 16 November the town of Ciudadella capitulated and control of the island was ceded to British forces.<ref name=\"WLC378\">Clowes, p. 378</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Cnote2 Begin|liststyle=upper-alpha}}\n{{Cnote2|Note A|'''Note A''': [[Richard Woodman]] suggests that Nelson deliberately allowed Bonaparte to sail from Toulon in order to have the opportunity to engage and destroy him at sea.<ref name=\"RW112\">Woodman, p. 112</ref> This is incorrect: as noted by [[Oliver Warner]], Nelson did not have the forces or the ability to intercept Bonaparte until 12 days after the French convoy had sailed.<ref name=\"OW50\">Warner, p. 50</ref> The same tactic has been suggested by historian Peter Padfield regarding [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]]'s intentions in the days before the [[Glorious First of June]] in 1794.<ref name=\"PP17\">Padfield, p. 17</ref>}}\n{{Cnote2 End}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=guelphmercury2018-01-01>\n{{cite news    \n| url         = https://www.guelphmercury.com/opinion-story/8027189-guelph-s-first-poet-played-bit-part-in-britain-s-war-with-napoleon/\n| title       = Guelph's first poet played bit part in Britain's war with Napoleon\n| work        = [[Guelph Mercury]]\n| author      = [[Ed Butts]]\n| date        = 2018-01-01\n| accessdate  = 2018-10-05\n| url-status     = live\n| quote       = On Aug. 22, the Alcmene intercepted the small French warship Legere.

Why were we there? If we were fighting for the four freedoms that [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] had talked about, then certainly we felt that the American soldier should be free first.\u201d The Japanese were capitalizing on the racism of the US and were actively using segregation as a point to discourage African American soldiers. Ironically, Moore\u2019s job was to counteract this propaganda and encourage African American soldiers that they played an important role in the fight against the [[Axis powers|Axis Powers]]. Once he arrived home, many whites had started a \u201chome guard\u201d to protect themselves against returning African American veterans; a FBI investigation into the numerous murders that occurred eventually led to the end of this particular type of aggression.<ref name=\":1\" /> Moore was more angry and outraged at the oppression of his race, and began to become more active in voter registration in Mississippi.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Regional Council of Negro Leadership ==\nPurchasing property, building a home, and starting a service station/restaurant, while continuing to be involved in local affairs established Moore as a leader in the community. In 1951, [[T. R. M. Howard|Dr. T.R.M. Howard]] founded the [[Regional Council of Negro Leadership]] (RCNL) with hopes to be the African American equivalent of the white Delta Council. Wanting to be the united voice of the African Americans in [[Mound Bayou, Mississippi|Mound Bayou]] and surrounding areas, the RCNL quickly gained massive popularity, convincing the state police to not stop harassing drivers and began encouraging people to register to vote. At their first mass meeting, over thirteen thousand people attended; \u201cWe decided that the purpose of the Regional Council was to teach Negroes first-class citizenship, the preservation of property, the paying of taxes, the holding of public office, the changing of the economic standpoint\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> Moore and a few other leaders of the RCNL were also active participants in the NAACP, but throughout both organizations existence there was always underlying tension between viewpoints on how to bring freedom. The NAACP typically wanted to use legal measures to change the culture, with the RCNL focused more on the economic issues that plagued those living in the Delta. However they did work together when it came to voter registration; strongly stimulated by Bob Moses tapping Moore to lead the project in the Delta.<ref>Browne, G. (2001, Mar 28).

He then became the vice president of the state conferences of the NAACP. When the Supreme Court desegregated public schools, the White Citizens Council began their rampage throughout the state, instilling even more fear in the African American community. There were many murders throughout the state of people who refused to take their name off the voting list, and Moore, along with many other leaders, received numerous death threats. In 1960, Moore brought the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] to focus their voter registration efforts in Mississippi, ultimately enfranchising thousands of African American Mississippians.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Civil rights movement}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Moore, Amzie}}\n[[Category:1911 births]]\n[[Category:1982 deaths]]\n[[Category:Activists for African-American civil rights]]\n[[Category:American military personnel of World War II]]\n[[Category:American businesspeople in retailing]]\n[[Category:African-American businesspeople]]\n[[Category:20th-century African-American activists]]\n[[Category:People from Cleveland, Mississippi]]\n[[Category:African-American military personnel]]\n[[Category:20th-century American businesspeople]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox person\n| name          = Amzie Moore\n| image         = File:Amzie Moore 1963.jpg\n| alt           = \n| caption       = Amzie Moore photographed in 1963 by [[Harvey Richards]].\n| birth_name    = <!-- only use if different from name -->\n| birth_date    = {{Birth date|1911|09|23}} \n| birth_place   = \n| death_date    = {{Death date and age|1982|02|01|1911|9|23}}\n| death_place   = \n| nationality   = \n| other_names   = \n| occupation    = \n| years_active  =\n| known_for     = \n| notable_works =\n}}\n\n'''Amzie Moore''' (September 23, 1911 \u2013 February 1, 1982) was an [[African-American]] [[Civil rights movement|civil rights leader]] and [[entrepreneur]] in the [[Mississippi Delta]].\n\n==Early life==\n\nAmzie Moore is one of the lesser known [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]] leaders, but was extremely influential in advocating and registering African Americans in Mississippi to exercise their right to vote as American citizens.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch, pp. H1\u2013H5.</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n== World War II ==\nIn 1942, upon being drafted for [[World War II]], as he put it, \u201cI really didn\u2019t know what segregation was before I went into the Army. It was the first time I really knew how evil segregation was\u201d<ref name=\":1\">Fraser, C. G. (1982, February 7). Amzie Moore, 1960's Leader For Voting Registration, Dies. The New York Times, p. 48.</ref>.\u00a0 He continued to experience systematic segregation throughout his Southern stations; even in [[Kolkata|Calcutta, India]] there were still segregated enlisted men\u2019s clubs etc. \u201cWhy were we fighting? Why were we there? If we were fighting for the four freedoms that [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] had talked about, then certainly we felt that the American soldier should be free first.\u201d The Japanese were capitalizing on the racism of the US and were actively using segregation as a point to discourage African American soldiers. Ironically, Moore\u2019s job was to counteract this propaganda and encourage African American soldiers that they played an important role in the fight against the [[Axis powers|Axis Powers]]. Once he arrived home, many whites had started a \u201chome guard\u201d to protect themselves against returning African American veterans; a FBI investigation into the numerous murders that occurred eventually led to the end of this particular type of aggression<ref name=\":1\" />. Moore was more angry and outraged at the oppression of his race, and began to become more active in voter registration in Mississippi<ref name=\":0\" />.\n<br />\n\n== Regional Council of Negro Leadership ==\nPurchasing property, building a home, and starting a service station/restaurant, while continuing to be involved in local affairs established Moore as a leader in the community. In 1951, [[T. R. M. Howard|Dr. T.R.M. Howard]] founded the [[Regional Council of Negro Leadership]] (RCNL) with hopes to be the African American equivalent of the white Delta Council. Wanting to be the united voice of the African Americans in [[Mound Bayou, Mississippi|Mound Bayou]] and surrounding areas, the RCNL quickly gained massive popularity, convincing the state police to not stop harassing drivers and began encouraging people to register to vote. At their first mass meeting, over thirteen thousand people attended; \u201cWe decided that the purpose of the Regional Council was to teach Negroes first-class citizenship, the preservation of property, the paying of taxes, the holding of public office, the changing of the economic standpoint\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />. Moore and a few other leaders of the RCNL were also active participants in the NAACP, but throughout both organizations existence there was always underlying tension between viewpoints on how to bring freedom. The NAACP typically wanted to use legal measures to change the culture, with the RCNL focused more on the economic issues that plagued those living in the Delta. However they did work together when it came to voter registration; strongly stimulated by Bob Moses tapping Moore to lead the project in the Delta<ref>Browne, G. (2001, Mar 28).

He then became the vice president of the state conferences of the NAACP. When the Supreme Court desegregated public schools, the White Citizens Council began their rampage throughout the state, instilling even more fear in the African American community. There were many murders throughout the state of people who refused to take their name off the voting list, and Moore, along with many other leaders, received numerous death threats. In 1960, Moore brought the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] to focus their voter registration efforts in Mississippi, ultimately enfranchising thousands of African American Mississippians<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n* \n\n{{Civil rights movement}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Moore, Amzie}}\n[[Category:1911 births]]\n[[Category:1982 deaths]]\n[[Category:Activists for African-American civil rights]]\n[[Category:American military personnel of World War II]]\n[[Category:American businesspeople in retailing]]\n[[Category:African-American businesspeople]]\n[[Category:20th-century African-American activists]]\n[[Category:People from Cleveland, Mississippi]]\n[[Category:African-American military personnel]]\n[[Category:20th-century American businesspeople]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reflist", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amzie_Moore"}

On arriving at [[Panama City]] however, he received news from [[James Veitch (horticulturist)|James Veitch]] that the cases of plants left in Guayaquil had never arrived. Lobb therefore despatched his latest collection from Panama (which arrived safely at Exeter) and awaited instructions from Veitch.<ref name = \"Shephard96\"/>\n\nAmongst the shipments from Panama were several orchids including ''[[Oncidium ampliatum]]'' collected near Panama City, described by Veitch in a letter to [[William Jackson Hooker|Hooker]] as arriving \"quite fresh but others are rotten\",<ref name = \"Shephard96\"/> a blue-azure ''[[Clitoria]]'' and a [[Lobelia]], ''[[Centropogon coccineus]]'', which he found growing \"in shady places on the banks of the [[Chagres River]]\"<ref name = \"Shephard96\"/> as well as seeds of several ''[[Fuchsia]]s'' and ''[[Tropaeolum]]''.\n\nWhile waiting in Panama, Lobb continued to seek out new plants despite suffering from an attack of [[dysentery]]. Once he had recovered, he returned to Guayaquil where he discovered all his cases rotting in a corner of a warehouse, with much of the contents destroyed by ants. The agent explained that the cases had \"quite escaped his notice\".<ref name = \"Shephard96\"/> Lobb was able to rescue some of the seeds, bulbs and dried specimens which he sent to Exeter.

He had been out chasing a large [[grizzly bear]]; the long, hard chase led Dowd into a strange part of the forested hills where he followed the bear into a grove of gigantic trees. Dowd soon lost interest in the chase and wandered around in amazement at the sheer size of the trees surrounding him. On returning to his camp, Dowd told his story to his companions, most of whom did not believe him and accused him of being drunk; a week later, however, he was able to persuade some of the less sceptical to be led to the grove, where they were equally astonished by the monstrous trees.<ref name = \"Musgrave147\"/><ref name = \"giganteum\">{{Cite web| url= http://oregonstate.edu/dept/ldplants/segi.htm|title = The \"discovery\" and naming of Sequoiadendron giganteum |publisher = oregonstate.edu|accessdate=21 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Aa Biddulph Grange Wellingtonia Walk.jpg|thumb|left| Biddulph Grange Wellingtonia Walk]]\nLobb immediately realised the impact such a tree would have on British gardens and the importance that his employers would attach to being the first nursery to offer it for sale.<ref name = \"Musgrave147\"/><ref name = \"Shephard115\"/> After the meeting, he quickly headed to [[Calaveras Grove]] where he had the good luck to find a recently fallen tree, which he measured as \"about 300 feet in length, 29 feet 2 inches, at 5 feet above the ground...\".<ref name = \"giganteum\"/> In his notebooks, Lobb recorded: \"From 80 to 90 trees exist all within circuit of a mile, from 250ft. to 320ft. in height, 10\u201312ft. in diameter.\"<ref name = \"Musgrave148\">{{Cite book| author= Musgrave| title=The Plant Hunters|page= 148}}</ref> He collected as many seeds, cones, vegetative shoots and [[seedling]]s as he could carry back to San Francisco, including two small living trees.<ref name = \"Shephard115\"/> He then returned to England on the first available boat arriving back in Exeter on 15 December 1853,<ref name = \"Earle\">{{Cite web| url= http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/earle/cu/se2/|title = Sequoiadendron giganteum (Lindley) Buchholz 1939 |author= Christopher J.

{"title_page": "Human trafficking in South America", "text_new": "{{underlinked|date=March 2018}}\n\n[[Human Trafficking]] is the trade of [[human beings]] for the purpose of [[sexual slavery]] or [[forced labor]]. [[South America]] is one of the biggest source and destination locations in the world and has struggled with the issue for many years. The [[ILO]] estimates that of the 20.9 million victims of human trafficking in 2012, 1.8 million were from [[Latin America]]. There are many factors that cause human trafficking, like a high demand for domestic servants, sex laborers, and factory workers, the existence of already established trafficking networks that often take advantage of young women and children, corruption in the governments and local law enforcement agencies, a governmental disinterest in the issue and a lack of opportunity for women in South American regions where trafficking occurs. People who are typically exploited in human trafficking are impoverished, a member of an [[indigenous people]], unemployed, has a history of physical or sexual abuse, illiterate, is a drug user, is homeless or is a member of a gang. The [[United States Department of State]] has also stated that there is a vulnerability for gay, bisexual, lesbian and transgender people to be caught up in human trafficking. Factors that cause a person to be willing to take such a high risk job are called pull factors. Pull factors are typically a hope for economic stability in another country, which are usually fueled by television, social media, and the internet's depiction of the United States.<ref>Seelke, Claire Ribando. Fas.org. Congressional Research Service, 13 Oct. 2016. Web. 4 Mar. 2018.</ref> About 20 percent of trafficking victims are children. <ref> United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

Fas.org. Congressional Research Service, 13 Oct. 2016. Web. 4 Mar. 2018.</ref>\n\n== History of human trafficking in the region ==\n\nThe commercial use of humans within Latin and South America has been acknowledged since 1928 by the League of Nations. The commercial use of humans is mostly consisted of women and children. In 2000, human trafficking gain a lot of attention due to the Trafficking Victims Protection Act passed by the United States. While the act is a US policy, the act also consist of a anti-trafficking efforts that by the US to stop human trafficking in its southern neighbors. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Guinn|first=David E.|date=2008|title=Defining the Problem of Trafficking: The Interplay of US Law, Donor, and NGO Engagement and the Local Context in Latin America|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20486699|journal=Human Rights Quarterly|volume=30|issue=1|pages=119\u2013145|issn=0275-0392}}</ref> Currently, Latin America is third largest source of trafficked humans. There is various theories as to why Central America, in particular, has seen increase cases of human trafficking. One theory is that due to the upheaval and political turmoil that occurred after the Spanish withdrew, crimes such as forced servitude and sexual exploitation increased without being checked. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scholarship.shu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1728&context=student_scholarship|title=The Rise of Human Trafficking in Central America|last=Ventura|first=Iris|date=2016|website=eRepository@Seton Hall|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=02/28/20}}</ref> The cultivation of conditions that allowed for human trafficking in Latin America can be dated back to the arrival of the first [[conquistadors]] in the 16th century.\n\nSince the 6th century there's been a continuous pattern of exploitation and extraction of the land and people inhabiting that region. First with the Spanish, then the dictatorships that replaced, and recently along with the dictators is [[neoliberalism]]. With neoliberalism, there are outside companies paying workers close to nothing wages while over working them. Due to past civil wars, lack of government regulation, and instances of past violations against human rights, Latin and South Americans have become exceedingly distrusting of their current governments. This situation makes it ideal for human traffickers to traffic people. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Types of human trafficking ==\n\n===Sex trafficking===\nSex trafficking is the practice of kidnapping people, typically young women and children, to be forced into the practice of sexual slavery and prostitution. Sex trafficking is the most common form of human trafficking. According to a report by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|UNODC]], 79 percent of trafficking is for sex trafficking.<ref> United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. UNODC report on human trafficking exposes modern form of slavery. http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-trafficking/global-report-on-trafficking-in-persons.html </ref> Typically, people with histories of sexual assault or sexual violence and people who live in poverty are targeted and kidnapped.<ref> Polaris Project(2002). Sex Trafficking From Latin America. https://polarisproject.org/es/initiatives/sex-trafficking-latin-america </ref> According to State Department officials, it is estimated that tens of thousands of Latin American women are trafficked each year, typically internationally. A large number of these victims come from Colombia or The Dominican Republic. According to a report made by the United Nations in 2016, multiple gangs, crime families, and drug trafficking organizations deal in human trafficking which may involve some 48,500 victims. These women and usually children are trafficked into prostitution, but can also be forced to work in pornography or stripping. Argentina and Brazil are very common destination countries for women from the Andes and some places in the Caribbean, like the Dominican Republic and Panama is a destination country for women from Colombia and Central America who are forced to work in the sex trade. Trafficking is a common occurrence along borders in Central and South America. The Mexican-Guatemalan border is especially popular due to undocumented migrants en route to the United States are often pushed into prostitution.  <ref>Seelke, Claire Ribando. Fas.org. Congressional Research Service, 13 Oct. 2016. Web. 4 Mar. 2018.</ref>\n\n===Forced Labor===\n\nForced labor is the practice of intimidating a person into performing types of labor, through intimidation or violence.<ref> International Labor Organization (2014). The Meanings of Forced Labor. http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/forced-labour/news/WCMS_237569/lang--en/index.htm </ref> The ILO reported that in 2012, about 1.8 million people in Latin America were laborers in forced labor. These numbers included victims of human trafficking. These numbers are estimated to be roughly 3.1 percent of the regions population, though it does not count the victims of human trafficking who are sent out internationally. <ref>Seelke, Claire Ribando. Fas.org. Congressional Research Service, 13 Oct. 2016. Web. 4 Mar. 2018.</ref> Typically, men are approached by people looking for workers in urban areas where poverty and unemployment are common.<ref> International Labor Organization (2014). Fighting Forced Labor in Latin America. http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_075511/lang--en/index.htm </ref>  These people promise good pay for work and often transport the workers to ranches and mines in remote areas. This is a common practice or occurrence in place like Peru, Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay where people are often forced to work on cattle ranches, lumber mills, cole mines and plantations where soy beans, cotton and corn are produced. Upon reaching their destination, the workers are told they are now in debt, and held in debt bondage. They are told that transportation costs will be taken out of their salaries. Other times, the workers aren't brought to the work site, but to a drop off point, where they sometimes wait for days or weeks for employers to come pick them up. Food, lodging and transportation are taken out of their salary, and they are held until their debt is paid.<ref> International Labor Organization (2014). Fighting Forced Labor in Latin America. http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_075511/lang--en/index.htm </ref> The indigenous people of Latin America are also highly susceptible to being taken into forced labor. Typically, they live in poverty and with discrimination and a low literacy rate working against them, they have no real way to protest against the laborers effectively.<ref> International Labor Organization (2014). Fighting Forced Labor in Latin America. http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_075511/lang--en/index.htm </ref>  It is estimated that annually, about 1.5 million seasonal farm workers who are mostly from Latin America and the Caribbean Islands harvest produce in the United States. There have been an increasing amount of abuses due to forced labor because of the low wages, harsh working conditions, lack of legal protection and an increasing demand for cheap labor. <ref>Seelke, Claire Ribando. Fas.org. Congressional Research Service, 13 Oct. 2016. Web. 4 Mar. 2018.</ref>\n\n===Trafficking of children===\n\nTypically, children are trafficked in countries that have large tourist attractions and centers on sex tourism. Street and orphaned children are the most vulnerable to be taken advantage of by traffickers, though there have been cases where the trafficked children still live with their family, and participate in commercial sexual activities to provide for the family. Some other factors that make a child vulnerable to becoming a victim of trafficking are poverty, infrequent attendance of school, involvement in criminal activity, drug or alcohol addiction, or physical or sexual abuse. \nChildren are typically trafficked for the uses of illegal adoptions, child soldiers, sex slavey, or to work for an organized crime group. State Department officials estimate that roughly 1 million children work as domestic servants in Latin America and that 70 to 80 percent of unaccompanied children travel with smugglers.<ref>Seelke, Claire Ribando. Fas.org. Congressional Research Service, 13 Oct. 2016. Web. 4 Mar. 2018.</ref>\n\n== Structural Factors that contribute to human trafficking == \n\n===Links to organized crime===\n\nPeople are often trafficked by criminal organizations such as criminal gangs or mafia groups. Typically, organized crime groups take part in the sex trade and trafficking practice. In [[Guatemala]], organized crime groups kidnap and transport women from other countries, often other Latin American countries, to participate in prostitution and sexual slavery. According to the Bilateral Safety Corridor Coalition, organized crime groups from [[Russia]], [[Japan]], [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], [[Ukraine]] and multiple other countries have been caught attempting to traffic people across the [[U.S.-Mexico border]]. The [[State Department]] states that there is evidence of children being forced to commit crimes in [[Ecuador]], [[Chile]], and [[Brazil]].<ref>Seelke, Claire Ribando. Fas.org. Congressional Research Service, 13 Oct. 2016. Web. 4 Mar. 2018.</ref>\n\n===Supply and demand of Capitalism===\nHuman trafficking is unique in that the supply and demand are the same thing. The high demand for human bodies incentivizes the exploitation and dehumanization of human beings. <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/what-fuels-human-trafficking/31692|title=What Fuels Human Trafficking?|website=UNICEF USA|language=en|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref> Supply and demand of human trafficking is normalized in capitalist societies where consumers feel it is their right to receive the services they paid for. Giving a monetary value to humans, makes those selling them see them as object and their property. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6222&context=etd|title=Human Trafficking from Southern Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala: Why These Victim are Trafficking into Modern Day Florida|last=Adam Golob|first=Timothy|date=2014|website=scholarcommons.usf.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=Mar 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Stigma and societal attitudes===\nAdditional factors that perpetuates human trafficking, forced labor, and forced prostitution are stigma and attitudes a society has in regard to individuals in the human trafficking industry. Research done by Jo Bindman, claims in general sex workers face significantly higher discrimination by law enforcements, governmental authority and society. This presents an issue concerning human trafficking as those who are unwilling forced into sex work are at a disadvantage of receiving help due to the conversation around sex work. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Systemic Inequality===\nDue to inequality and disparities that result from globalization and the lack of regulation, there are certain groups who are more vulnerable than others of becoming victims of human trafficking. These groups include and is not limited to individual who are impoverished, lack job opportunities, queer, and/or engage in harmful cultural traditions.<ref name=\":1\" /> Those who are living in poverty and lack the opportunity to at acquire a safe, honorable job are easily susceptible to the deceiving, manipulative tactics of human traffickers. As a result, it is due to their desperation that thousands of individuals end up in the industry of human trafficking. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://i.unu.edu/media/unu.edu/publication/2387/trafficking-in-humans-sample-chapter-shozo.pdf|title=Trafficking in humans: social, cultural, and political dimensions|last=Cameron, Newman|first=Sally, Edward|date=1970-2008|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=Mar 6, 2020}}</ref> \n\n===Illegal immigration===\nSome people go to traffickers looking to be brought into a new country, typically illegally. The most common countries people are brought to are The United States, Britain, Italy, Canada, Spain and The Netherlands. These countries have come to rely on migrant workers doing jobs in agriculture, construction, manufacturing and domestic service for low paying wages. Because of a concern about job competition, security and many other issues related to taking in large amounts of foreign-born populations, this has caused many of these countries to strengthen and tighten their border security. Though this has only caused a rise in illegal immigration. Many people from Guatemala and Belize travel through Mexico to get to the United States border. Because of the increasing security along the borders, smugglers will take more dangerous routes, which makes the smuggling more costly. To pay for this, smugglers will force the migrants into forced labor or prostitution.<ref>Seelke, Claire Ribando. Fas.org. Congressional Research Service, 13 Oct. 2016. Web. 4 Mar. 2018.</ref>\n\n==Efforts to combat Human Trafficking==\nHuman Trafficking is underreported making for there to be a substantial amount of data missing concerning Human Trafficking. Then two reasoning behind this is one the inadequate legislation surrounding and lacking of testimonies from victims and witness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245907527_Developing_Better_Indicators_of_Human_Trafficking|title=Developing Better Indicators of Human Trafficking {{!}} Request PDF|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref>  \n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

There are many factors that cause human trafficking, like a high demand for domestic servants, sex laborers, and factory workers, the existence of already established trafficking networks that often take advantage of young women and children, corruption in the governments and local law enforcement agencies, a governmental disinterest in the issue and a lack of opportunity for women in South American regions where trafficking occurs. People who are typically exploited in human trafficking are impoverished, a member of an [[indigenous people]], unemployed, has a history of physical or sexual abuse, illiterate, is a drug user, is homeless or is a member of a gang. The [[United States Department of State]] has also stated that there is a vulnerability for gay, bisexual, lesbian and transgender people to be caught up in human trafficking. Factors that cause a person to be willing to take such a high risk job are called pull factors. Pull factors are typically a hope for economic stability in another country, which are usually fueled by television, social media, and the internet's depiction of the United States.<ref>Seelke, Claire Ribando.

The commercial use of humans is mostly consisted of women and children. In 2000, human trafficking gain a lot of attention due to the Trafficking Victims Protection Act passed by the United States. While the act is a US policy, the act also consist of a anti-trafficking efforts that by the US to stop human trafficking in its southern neighbors. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Guinn|first=David E.|date=2008|title=Defining the Problem of Trafficking: The Interplay of US Law, Donor, and NGO Engagement and the Local Context in Latin America|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20486699|journal=Human Rights Quarterly|volume=30|issue=1|pages=119\u2013145|issn=0275-0392}}</ref> Currently, Latin America is third largest source of trafficked humans. There is various theories as to why Central America, in particular, has seen increase cases of human trafficking. One theory is that due to the upheaval and political turmoil that occurred after the Spanish withdrew, crimes such as forced servitude and sexual exploitation increased without being checked. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scholarship.shu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1728&context=student_scholarship|title=The Rise of Human Trafficking in Central America|last=Ventura|first=Iris|date=2016|website=eRepository@Seton Hall|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=02/28/20}}</ref> The cultivation of conditions that allowed for human trafficking in Latin America can be dated back to the arrival of the first [[conquistadors]] in the 16th century.\n\nSince the 6th century there's been a continuous pattern of exploitation and extraction of the land and people inhabiting that region. First with the Spanish, then the dictatorships that replaced, and recently along with the dictators is [[neoliberalism]]. With neoliberalism, there are outside companies paying workers close to nothing wages while over working them. Due to past civil wars, lack of government regulation, and instances of past violations against human rights, Latin and South Americans have become exceedingly distrusting of their current governments. This situation makes it ideal for human traffickers to traffic people. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Types of human trafficking ==\n\n===Sex trafficking===\nSex trafficking is the practice of kidnapping people, typically young women and children, to be forced into the practice of sexual slavery and prostitution. Sex trafficking is the most common form of human trafficking. According to a report by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|UNODC]], 79 percent of trafficking is for sex trafficking.<ref> United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. UNODC report on human trafficking exposes modern form of slavery. http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-trafficking/global-report-on-trafficking-in-persons.html </ref> Typically, people with histories of sexual assault or sexual violence and people who live in poverty are targeted and kidnapped.<ref> Polaris Project(2002). Sex Trafficking From Latin America. https://polarisproject.org/es/initiatives/sex-trafficking-latin-america </ref> According to State Department officials, it is estimated that tens of thousands of Latin American women are trafficked each year, typically internationally. A large number of these victims come from Colombia or The Dominican Republic. According to a report made by the United Nations in 2016, multiple gangs, crime families, and drug trafficking organizations deal in human trafficking which may involve some 48,500 victims. These women and usually children are trafficked into prostitution, but can also be forced to work in pornography or stripping. Argentina and Brazil are very common destination countries for women from the Andes and some places in the Caribbean, like the Dominican Republic and Panama is a destination country for women from Colombia and Central America who are forced to work in the sex trade. Trafficking is a common occurrence along borders in Central and South America. The Mexican-Guatemalan border is especially popular due to undocumented migrants en route to the United States are often pushed into prostitution.  <ref>Seelke, Claire Ribando. Fas.org. Congressional Research Service, 13 Oct. 2016. Web. 4 Mar. 2018.</ref>\n\n===Forced Labor===\n\nForced labor is the practice of intimidating a person into performing types of labor, through intimidation or violence.<ref> International Labor Organization (2014). The Meanings of Forced Labor. http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/forced-labour/news/WCMS_237569/lang--en/index.htm </ref> The ILO reported that in 2012, about 1.8 million people in Latin America were laborers in forced labor. These numbers included victims of human trafficking. These numbers are estimated to be roughly 3.1 percent of the regions population, though it does not count the victims of human trafficking who are sent out internationally. <ref>Seelke, Claire Ribando. Fas.org. Congressional Research Service, 13 Oct. 2016. Web. 4 Mar. 2018.</ref> Typically, men are approached by people looking for workers in urban areas where poverty and unemployment are common.<ref> International Labor Organization (2014). Fighting Forced Labor in Latin America. http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_075511/lang--en/index.htm </ref>  These people promise good pay for work and often transport the workers to ranches and mines in remote areas. This is a common practice or occurrence in place like Peru, Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay where people are often forced to work on cattle ranches, lumber mills, cole mines and plantations where soy beans, cotton and corn are produced. Upon reaching their destination, the workers are told they are now in debt, and held in debt bondage. They are told that transportation costs will be taken out of their salaries. Other times, the workers aren't brought to the work site, but to a drop off point, where they sometimes wait for days or weeks for employers to come pick them up. Food, lodging and transportation are taken out of their salary, and they are held until their debt is paid.<ref> International Labor Organization (2014). Fighting Forced Labor in Latin America. http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_075511/lang--en/index.htm </ref> The indigenous people of Latin America are also highly susceptible to being taken into forced labor. Typically, they live in poverty and with discrimination and a low literacy rate working against them, they have no real way to protest against the laborers effectively.<ref> International Labor Organization (2014). Fighting Forced Labor in Latin America. http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_075511/lang--en/index.htm </ref>  It is estimated that annually, about 1.5 million seasonal farm workers who are mostly from Latin America and the Caribbean Islands harvest produce in the United States. There have been an increasing amount of abuses due to forced labor because of the low wages, harsh working conditions, lack of legal protection and an increasing demand for cheap labor. <ref>Seelke, Claire Ribando. Fas.org. Congressional Research Service, 13 Oct. 2016. Web. 4 Mar. 2018.</ref>\n\n===Trafficking of children===\n\nTypically, children are trafficked in countries that have large tourist attractions and centers on sex tourism. Street and orphaned children are the most vulnerable to be taken advantage of by traffickers, though there have been cases where the trafficked children still live with their family, and participate in commercial sexual activities to provide for the family. Some other factors that make a child vulnerable to becoming a victim of trafficking are poverty, infrequent attendance of school, involvement in criminal activity, drug or alcohol addiction, or physical or sexual abuse. \nChildren are typically trafficked for the uses of illegal adoptions, child soldiers, sex slavey, or to work for an organized crime group. State Department officials estimate that roughly 1 million children work as domestic servants in Latin America and that 70 to 80 percent of unaccompanied children travel with smugglers.<ref>Seelke, Claire Ribando. Fas.org. Congressional Research Service, 13 Oct. 2016. Web. 4 Mar. 2018.</ref>\n\n== Structural Factors that contribute to human trafficking == \n\n===Links to organized crime===\n\nPeople are often trafficked by criminal organizations such as criminal gangs or mafia groups. Typically, organized crime groups take part in the sex trade and trafficking practice. In [[Guatemala]], organized crime groups kidnap and transport women from other countries, often other Latin American countries, to participate in prostitution and sexual slavery. According to the Bilateral Safety Corridor Coalition, organized crime groups from [[Russia]], [[Japan]], [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], [[Ukraine]] and multiple other countries have been caught attempting to traffic people across the [[U.S.-Mexico border]]. The [[State Department]] states that there is evidence of children being forced to commit crimes in [[Ecuador]], [[Chile]], and [[Brazil]].<ref>Seelke, Claire Ribando. Fas.org. Congressional Research Service, 13 Oct. 2016. Web. 4 Mar. 2018.</ref>\n\n===Supply and demand of Capitalism===\nHuman trafficking is unique in that the supply and demand are the same thing. The high demand for human bodies incentivizes the exploitation and dehumanization of human beings. <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/what-fuels-human-trafficking/31692|title=What Fuels Human Trafficking?|website=UNICEF USA|language=en|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref> Supply and demand of human trafficking is normalized in capitalist societies where consumers feel it is their right to receive the services they paid for. Giving a monetary value to humans, makes those selling them see them as object and their property. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6222&context=etd|title=Human Trafficking from Southern Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala: Why These Victim are Trafficking into Modern Day Florida|last=Adam Golob|first=Timothy|date=2014|website=scholarcommons.usf.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=Mar 6, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Stigma and societal attitudes===\nAdditional factors that perpetuates human trafficking, forced labor, and forced prostitution are stigma and attitudes a society has in regard to individuals in the human trafficking industry. Research done by Jo Bindman, claims in general sex workers face significantly higher discrimination by law enforcements, governmental authority and society. This presents an issue concerning human trafficking as those who are unwilling forced into sex work are at a disadvantage of receiving help due to the conversation around sex work. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Systemic Inequality===\nDue to inequality and disparities that result from globalization and the lack of regulation, there are certain groups who are more vulnerable than others of becoming victims of human trafficking. These groups include and is not limited to individual who are impoverished, lack job opportunities, queer, and/or engage in harmful cultural traditions.<ref name=\":1\" /> Those who are living in poverty and lack the opportunity to at acquire a safe, honorable job are easily susceptible to the deceiving, manipulative tactics of human traffickers. As a result, it is due to their desperation that thousands of individuals end up in the industry of human trafficking. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://i.unu.edu/media/unu.edu/publication/2387/trafficking-in-humans-sample-chapter-shozo.pdf|title=Trafficking in humans: social, cultural, and political dimensions|last=Cameron, Newman|first=Sally, Edward|date=1970-2008|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=Mar 6, 2020}}</ref> \n\n===Illegal immigration===\nSome people go to traffickers looking to be brought into a new country, typically illegally. The most common countries people are brought to are The United States, Britain, Italy, Canada, Spain and The Netherlands. These countries have come to rely on migrant workers doing jobs in agriculture, construction, manufacturing and domestic service for low paying wages. Because of a concern about job competition, security and many other issues related to taking in large amounts of foreign-born populations, this has caused many of these countries to strengthen and tighten their border security. Though this has only caused a rise in illegal immigration. Many people from Guatemala and Belize travel though Mexico to get to the United States border. Because of the increasing security along the borders, smugglers will take more dangerous routes, which makes the smuggling more costly. To pay for this, smugglers will force the migrants into forced labor or prostitution.<ref>Seelke, Claire Ribando. Fas.org. Congressional Research Service, 13 Oct. 2016. Web. 4 Mar. 2018.</ref>\n\n==Efforts to combat Human Trafficking==\nHuman Trafficking is underreported making for there to be a substantial amount of data missing concerning Human Trafficking. Then two reasoning behind this is one the inadequate legislation surrounding and lacking of testimonies from victims and witness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245907527_Developing_Better_Indicators_of_Human_Trafficking|title=Developing Better Indicators of Human Trafficking {{!}} Request PDF|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref>  \n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.
