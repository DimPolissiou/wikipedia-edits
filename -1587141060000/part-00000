It is situated on the [[Adriatic Sea]], at the northwestern part of [[Ravni Kotari]] region. Zadar serves as the seat of [[Zadar County]] and of the wider northern [[Dalmatia]]n region. The city proper covers {{convert|25|km2|abbr =on}} with a population of 75,082 {{as of | 2011 | alt = in 2011}}, making it the second-largest city of the region of Dalmatia and the fifth-largest city in the country.\n\nThe area of present-day Zadar traces its earliest evidence of human life from the late [[Stone Age]], while numerous settlements date as early as the [[Neolithic]] {{Citation needed|reason= citation needed for the claims|date= April 2019}}. Before the [[Illyrians]], an ancient [[Mediterranean]] people of an [[Indo-European culture]] inhabited the area. Zadar traces its origin to its 9th-century BC founding as a settlement of the Illyrian tribe of [[Liburnians]] known as ''Iader'' {{Citation needed|reason=serious claim requiring a citation |date=April 2019}}.\n\nIn 59 BC it was renamed ''Iadera'' when it became a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[municipium]]. In 48 BC it became a Roman [[Colonia (Roman)|''colonia'']]. During Roman rule Zadar acquired the characteristics of a traditional [[Ancient Roman architecture#City design|Ancient Roman city]] with a regular road network, a public square ([[Forum (Roman)|''forum'']]), and an elevated ''[[capitolium]]'' with a temple.\n\nAfter the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in 476 and the destruction of [[Salona]] by the [[Avars (Caucasus)|Avars]] and [[Croats]] in 614, Zadar became the capital of the Byzantine [[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] of [[Dalmatia (theme)|Dalmatia]]. In the beginning of the 9th century, Zadar came briefly under [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish]] rule, but the [[Pax Nicephori]] returned it to the Byzantines in 812. The first Croatian rulers gained brief control over the city in 10th century. In 998 Zadar swore allegiance to [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] [[Pietro Orseolo II]] and became a vassal of the [[Republic of Venice]]. In 1186 it placed itself under the protection of [[B\u00e9la III of Hungary|B\u00e9la III, King of Hungary and Croatia]].\n\nIn 1202 the Venetians, with the help of [[Fourth Crusade|Crusaders]], [[Siege of Zara|reconquered and sacked]] Zadar. Hungary regained control over the city in 1358, when it [[Treaty of Zadar|was given]] to king [[Louis I of Hungary]]. In 1409 king [[Ladislaus of Naples|Ladislaus I]] sold Zadar to the Venetians. When the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Turks conquered]] the Zadar hinterland at the beginning of the 16th century, the town became an important stronghold, ensuring Venetian trade in the Adriatic, the administrative center of the Venetian territories in Dalmatia and a cultural center. This fostered an environment in which [[Renaissance art|arts]] and [[Renaissance literature|literature]] could flourish, and between the 15th and 17th centuries Zadar came under the influence of the [[Renaissance]], giving rise to many important [[Dalmatian Italians|Italian Renaissance]] figures like [[Giorgio Ventura]] and [[Giovanni Francesco Fortunio]], who wrote the first Italian grammar book, and many famous Croatian writers, such as [[Petar Zorani\u0107]], [[Brne Krnaruti\u0107]], [[Juraj Barakovi\u0107]] and [[\u0160ime Budini\u0107]], who wrote in the [[Croatian language]].\n\nAfter the fall of Venice in 1797, Zadar came under the Austrian rule until 1918, except for the period of [[Illyrian provinces|short-term French rule]] (1805\u20131813), still remaining the capital of Dalmatia. During French rule the first newspaper in the Croatian language, ''[[Il Regio Dalmata \u2013 Kraglski Dalmatin]]'', was published in Zadar (1806\u20131810). During the 19th century Zadar functioned as a center of the [[Illyrian movement|Croatian movement]] for cultural and national revival in a context of increasing polarization and politicization of ethnic identities between Croats and [[Dalmatian Italians]].\n\t \t\t\nWith the 1920 [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|Treaty of Rapallo]] Zadar was given to the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. During [[World War II]], it was [[Bombing of Zadar in World War II|bombed]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and witnessed the [[Istrian-Dalmatian exodus|evacuation of ethnic Italians]]. Partisans captured the city on 1 November{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} 1944; in 1947 it officially became part of [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|SR Croatia]], a federal constituent of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]], whose armed forces [[Battle of Zadar|defended it]] in October 1991 from the Serb forces who aimed to capture it.\n\nToday, Zadar is a historical center of Dalmatia, Zadar County's principal political, cultural, commercial, industrial, educational, and transportation centre. Zadar is also the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zadar]]. Because of its rich heritage, Zadar is today one of the most popular Croatian tourist destinations, named \"entertainment center of the Adriatic\" by ''[[The Times]]'' and \"Croatia's new capital of cool\" by ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author= Termin odr\u017eavanja |url= http://www.poslovniturizam.com/destinacije/zadar/6/ |title= Destinacije \u2013 Zadar \u2013 3000 godina povijesti \u2013 Kongresni turizam |publisher= Poslovni turizam |date= 7 November 2016 |accessdate= 9 March 2017}}</ref> In 2016 the Belgian portal ''Europe's Best Destinations.com''  named Zadar the \"Best European Destination\" after a three-week period of online voting involving more than 288,000 votes.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.europeanbestdestinations.com/best-of-europe/european-best-destinations-2016/ |title= Best places to travel in 2016 \u2013 Europe's Best Destinations |publisher= Europeanbestdestinations.com |accessdate= 9 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Site]] list included the fortified city of Zadar as part of [[Venetian Works of Defence between 15th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra \u2013 western Stato da Mar|Venetian Works of Defence between 15th and 17th centuries: ''Stato da Terra'' \u2013 western ''Stato da Mar'']] in 2017.<ref>\n{{cite web\nlast1= Centre|first1= UNESCO World Heritage\n|title= Venetian Works of Defence between 15th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra \u2013 western Stato da Mar\n|url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1533/multiple=1&unique_number=2162\n|website= whc.unesco.org\n|accessdate= 11 July 2017|language= en\n}}\n</ref>\n\n== Etymology and historical names ==\nThe name of the city of Zadar emerged as ''Iadera'' and ''Iader'' in [[ancient history|ancient]] times, but the origin of the name is older. It was most probably related to a hydrographical term, coined by an ancient Mediterranean people and their [[Old European culture|Pre-Indo-European]] language. They transmitted it to later settlers, the [[Liburnians]]. The name of the Liburnian settlement was first mentioned by a [[Greek language|Greek]] inscription from Pharos ([[Stari Grad, Croatia|Stari grad]]) on the island of [[Hvar]] in 384 BC, where the citizens of Zadar were noted as {{lang|grc|\u038a\u03b1\u03b4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af}} (''Iadasinoi''). According to the Greek source [[Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax]] the city was {{lang|grc|\u038a\u03b4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1}} (''Idassa''), probably a Greek [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] of the original Liburnian expression.\n\nDuring [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] the name was often recorded in sources in [[Latin language|Latin]] in two forms: ''Iader'' in the inscriptions and in the writings of classic writers, ''Iadera'' predominantly among the late Antiquity writers, while usual [[ethnonym]]s were ''Iadestines'' and ''Iadertines''. The accent was on the first syllable in both Iader and Iadera forms, which influenced the early-Medieval [[Dalmatian language]] forms ''Jadra'', ''Jadera'' and ''Jadertina'', where the accent kept its original place.\n\nIn the Dalmatian language, ''Jadra'' (''Jadera'') was pronounced ''Zadra'' (''Zadera''), due to the phonetic transformation of ''Ja''- to ''Za''-. That change was also reflected in the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] name ''Zadar'' (recorded as ''Zader'' in the 12th century<ref>Adnotationes chronologicae in codice missalisaeculi XII. ap. Florianus:Fontesdomestici Vol. III, 209.</ref>), developed from masculine ''Zad\u044ar\u044a''. An ethnonym graphic ''Jaderani'' from the legend of [[Saint Chrysogonus]] in the 9th century, was identical to the initial [[Old Church Slavonic|old-Slavic]] form ''Zad\u044arane'', or [[Renaissance]] Croatian ''Zadrani''.\n\nThe Dalmatian names ''Jadra'', ''Jadera'' were transferred to other languages; in the [[Venetian language]] ''Jatara'' (hyper-urbanism in the 9th century) and ''Zara'', [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]] ''Giara'', Latin ''Diadora'' ([[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', 10th century, probably an error in the transcription of ''di iadora''), [[Old French]] ''Jadres'' (Geoffroy de Villehardouin in the chronicles of the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1202), [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''J\u0101dhara'' ({{lang|ar|\u062c\u0627\u0630\u064e\u0631\u0629}}) and ''J\u0101dara'' ({{lang|ar|\u062c\u0627\u062f\u064e\u0631\u0629}}) ([[Al-Idrisi]], 12th century), ''Iadora'' (Guido, 12th century), [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''Jazara'', ''Jara'', ''Sarra'' (14th century) and the others.<ref>M.Sui\u0107: Pro\u0161lost Zadra 1, ''Zadar u starom vijeku'', Filozofski Fakultet Zadar, 1981</ref>\n\nJadera became Zara when it fell under the authority of the [[Republic of Venice]] in the 15th century.\nZara was later used by the [[Austrian Empire]] in the 19th century, but it was provisionally changed to Zadar/Zara from 1910 to 1920; from 1920<ref>See: [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920]]</ref> to 1947<ref>See: [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947]]</ref> the city became part of [[Italy]] as Zara, and finally was named ''Zadar'' in 1947.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Zadar Bridge 02.jpg|thumb|Zadar Bridge]]\nZadar faces the islands of [[Ugljan]] and [[Pa\u0161man]] (part of the [[Zadar Archipelago]]), from which it is separated by the narrow Zadar Strait.

since prehistoric times. The earliest evidence of human life comes from the Late [[Stone Age]], while numerous settlements have been dated as early as the [[Neolithic]]. Before the [[Illyrians]], the area was inhabited by an ancient [[Mediterranean]] people of a [[Old European culture|pre-Indo-European culture]]. They assimilated with the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] who settled between the 4th and 2nd millennium BC into a new ethnical unity, that of the [[Liburnians]]. Zadar was a Liburnian settlement, laid out in the 9th century BC, built on a small stone islet and embankments where the old city stands and tied to the mainland by the overflown narrow isthmus, which created a natural port in its northern strait.<ref>M. Sui\u0107, Pro\u0161lost Zadra I, Zadar u starom vijeku, Filozofski fakultet Zadar, 1981, pages 61\u2013113</ref>\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nThe Liburnians, an Illyrian tribe, were known as great sailors and merchants, but also had a reputation for piracy in the later years. By the 7th century BC, Zadar had become an important centre for their trading activities with the [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] and other Mediterranean peoples. Its population at that time is estimated at 2,000.<ref>V. Graovac, \"Populacijski razvoj Zadra\", ''Sveu\u010dili\u0161te u Zadru'', 2004, page 52</ref> From the 9th to the 6th century there was certain cultural unity in the Adriatic Sea, with the general Liburninan seal, whose naval supremacy meant both political and economical authority through several centuries.<ref>M. Zaninovi\u0107, Liburnia Militaris, Opusc. Archeol. 13, 43\u201367 (1988), UDK 904.930.2(497.13)>>65<<, page 47</ref> Due to its geographical position, Zadar developed into a main seat of the Liburnian thalassocracy and took a leading role in the Liburnian ''tetradekapolis'', an organization of 14 communes.<ref>M. Sui\u0107, Liburnija i Liburni, VAMZ, 3.S., XXIV-XXV,1991\u201392, UDK 931/939 (36)\"6/9\", pages 55\u201366</ref>\n\nThe people of Zadar, ''Iadasinoi'', were first mentioned in 384 BC as the allies of the natives of [[Hvar]] and the leaders of an eastern Adriatic coast coalition in the fight against the Greek colonizers. An expedition of 10,000 men in 300 ships sailed out from Zadar and laid siege to the Greek colony [[Stari Grad, Croatia|Pharos]] in the island of Hvar, but the [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracusan]] fleet of ''Dionysus'' was alerted and attacked the siege fleet. The naval victory went to the Greeks which allowed them relatively safer further colonization in the southern [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]].<ref>M. Sui\u0107, Pro\u0161lost Zadra I, Zadar u starom vijeku, Filozofski fakultet Zadar, 1981, pages 127\u2013130</ref>\n\n[[File:Liburnia 1st AD.png|thumb|200px|left|Zadar (Iader) and the other cities of the Liburnian tetradecapolis in the age of the Roman conquest]]\nThe archaeological remains have shown that the main centres of Liburnian territorial units or municipalities were already urbanized in the last centuries BC; before the Roman conquest, Zadar held a territory of more than {{convert|600|km2|abbr=on}} in the 2nd century BC.\n\nIn the middle of the 2nd century BC, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] began to gradually invade the region. Although being first Roman enemies in the Adriatic Sea, the Liburnians, mostly stood aside in more than 230 years of Roman wars with the Illyrians, to protect their naval and trade connections in the sea. In 59 BC Illyricum was assigned as a ''provincia'' (zone of responsibility) to [[Julius Caesar]] and Liburnian Iadera became a Roman [[municipium]].\n\nThe Liburnian naval force was dragged into the Roman civil war between [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Pompey]] in 49 BC, partially by force, partially because of the local interests of the participants, the Liburnian cities. Caesar was supported by the urban Liburnian centres, like ''Iader'' (Zadar), ''Aenona'' ([[Nin, Croatia|Nin]]) and ''Curicum'' ([[Krk]]), while the city of ''Issa'' ([[Vis (town)|Vis]]) and the rest of the Liburnians gave their support to Pompey. In 49 BC near the island of Krk, the \"Navy of Zadar\", equipped by the fleets of a few Liburnian cities and supported by some Roman ships, lost an important naval battle against Pompey supporting the \"Liburnian navy\". The civil war was prolonged until the end of 48 BC, when Caesar rewarded his supporters in Liburnian ''Iader'' and [[Dalmatae|Dalmatian]] ''[[Salona]]'', by giving the status of the [[Colonia (Roman)|Roman colonies]] to their communities.<ref>M. Zaninovi\u0107, Liburnia Militaris, Opusc. Archeol. 13, 43\u201367 (1988), UDK 904.930.2(497.13)>>65<<, pages 56, 57</ref> Thus the city was granted the title ''colonia Iulia Iader'', after its founder, and in the next period some of the Roman colonists (mostly [[legionary]] veterans) settled there.\n\nThe real establishment of the Roman province of Illyricum occurred not earlier than 33 BC and [[Augustus|Octavian]]'s military campaign in Illyria and Liburnia, when the Liburnians finally lost their naval independence and their galleys and sailors were incorporated into the Roman naval fleets.\n\n[[File:Zadar Forum.jpg|Roman Forum in Zadar|200px|thumb|right|The Roman forum remains in Zadar]]\nFrom the early days of Roman rule, Zadar gained its Roman urban character and developed into one of the most flourishing centres on the eastern Adriatic coast, a state of affairs which lasted for several hundred years. The town was organised according to the typical Roman street system with a rectangular street plan, a forum, thermae, a sewage and water supply system that came from [[lake Vrana (Dalmatia)|lake Vrana]], by way of a {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} long aqueduct. It did not play a significant role in the Roman administration of Dalmatia, although the archaeological finds tell us about a significant growth of economy and culture.\n\n[[Christianity]] did not bypass the Roman province of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]].

In 441 and 447 Dalmatia was ravaged by the [[Huns]], after the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], in 481 Dalmatia became part of the [[Ostrogothic kingdom]], which, besides Italy, already included the more northerly parts of [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]], i.e. [[Pannonia]] and [[Noricum]].\n\nIn the 5th century, under the rule of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]], Zadar became poor with many civic buildings ruined due to its advanced age. About the same time (6th century) it was hit by an earthquake, which destroyed entire complexes of monumental Roman architecture, whose parts would later serve as material for building houses. This caused a loss of population and created demographic changes in the city, then gradually repopulated by the inhabitants from its hinterland.<ref>V.

In 568 Dalmatia was devastated by an [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avar]] invasion; although further waves of attacks by Avar and [[Slavs|Slav]] tribes kept up the pressure, it was the only city which survived due to its protective belt of inland plains. The Dalmatian capital [[Salona]] was captured and destroyed in the 640s, so Zadar became the new seat of the Byzantine [[archonty of Dalmatia]], territorially reduced to a few coastal cities with their agers and municipal lands at the coast and the islands nearby. The prior of Zadar had jurisdiction over all Byzantine Dalmatia, so Zadar enjoyed metropolitan status at the eastern Adriatic coast. At this time rebuilding began to take place in the city.\n\n[[File:Church of Saint Donatus, Zadar - September 2017.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Church of St. Donatus|St. Donatus church]], 9th century]]\nAt the beginning of the 9th century the Zadar bishop [[Donatus of Zadar|Donatus]] and the city duke Paul mediated in the dispute between the [[Holy Roman empire]] under [[Pepin of Italy|Pepin]] and the Byzantine Empire. The [[Franks]] held Zadar for a short time, but the city was returned to Byzantium by a decision of the 812 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (812)|Treaty of Aachen]].<ref name=Dalmatia>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Dalmatia |volume=7 |pages=772\u2013776 |first=Kingsley |last=Jayne}}</ref>\n\nZadar's economy revolved around the sea, fishing and sea trade in the first centuries of the Middle Ages. Thanks to saved Antique ager, adjusted municipal structure and a new strategic position, it became the most important city between the [[Kvarner]] islands and [[Ka\u0161tela]] Bay. Byzantine Dalmatia was not territorially unified, but an alliance of city municipalities headed by Zadar, and the large degree of city autonomy allowed the development of Dalmatian cities as free communes. Forced to turn their attention seawards, the inhabitants of Zadar focused on shipping, and the city became a naval power to rival [[Venice]]. The citizens were [[Dalmatian language]] speakers, but from the 7th century the [[Croatian language]] started to spread in the region, becoming predominant in the inland and the islands to the end of the 9th century.<ref>Nada Klai\u0107, Ivo Petricioli, Pro\u0161lost Zadra \u2013 knjiga II, Zadar u srednjem vijeku do 1409., Filozofski fakultet Zadar, 1976, page 59</ref>\n\nThe Mediterranean and Adriatic cities developed significantly during a period of peace from the last decades of the 9th to the middle of the 10th century.

The city was repeatedly invaded by Venice between 1111 and 1154 and then once more between 1160 and 1183, when it finally rebelled, appealing to the Pope and to the Croato-Hungarian throne for protection.\n\n[[File:Pallucchini Tintoretto 590 1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Siege of Zara|Siege of the city in 1202]]]]\n\nZadar was especially devastated in 1202 after the Venetian [[Enrico Dandolo|Doge Enrico Dandolo]] used the [[crusaders]], on their [[Fourth Crusade]] to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], to lay siege to the city.<ref name=\"Sethre\">{{cite book|last=Sethre|first=Janet|pages=54\u201355|title=The Souls of Venice|year=2003|isbn=0-7864-1573-8}}</ref> The crusaders were obliged to pay Venice for sea transport to [[Egypt]].

In 1204 Domald was ''comes'' (duke) of Zadar, but the following year (1205) Venetian authority was re-established and a peace agreement signed with hard conditions for the citizens. The only profit which the Communal Council of Zadar derived from this was one third of the city's harbour taxes, probably insufficient even for the most indispensable communal needs.<ref>N.

Its commerce was suffering due to a lack of autonomy under Venice, while it enjoyed considerable autonomy under the much more feudal Kingdom of Croatia-Hungary. A number of insurrections followed (1242\u20131243, 1320s, 1345\u20131346 \u2013 the latter resulted in a [[Siege of Zadar (1345\u201346)|sixteen-month-long Venetian siege]]) which finally resulted in Zadar coming back under the crown of King [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]] of Croatia-Hungary under the [[Treaty of Zara|Treaty of Zadar]], in 1358. After the [[War of Chioggia]] between Genoa and Venice, [[Chioggia]] concluded on 14 March 1381 an alliance with Zadar and [[Trogir]] against Venice, and finally Chioggia became better protected by Venice in 1412, because [[\u0160ibenik]] became in 1412 the seat of the main [[customs]] office and the seat of the salt consumers office with a [[monopoly]] on the salt trade in Chioggia and on the whole [[Adriatic Sea]]. After the death of Louis, Zadar recognized the rule of king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], and after him, that of [[Ladislaus of Naples]]. During his reign Croatia-Hungary was enveloped in a bloody civil war. In 1409, Venice, seeing that Ladislaus was about to be defeated, and eager to exploit the situation despite its relative military weakness, offered to buy his \"rights\" on Dalmatia for a mere 100,000 ducats. Knowing he had lost the region in any case, Ladislaus accepted. Zadar was, thus sold back to the Venetians for a paltry sum.\n\nThe population of Zadar during the Medieval period was predominantly Croatian, according to numerous archival documents,<ref>N.

Thanks to its political and trading achievements, and also to its skilled seamen, Zadar played an important role among the cities on the east coast of the Adriatic. This affected its appearance and culture: many churches, rich monasteries and palaces for powerful families were built, together with the [[Chest of Saint Simeon]]. One of the best examples of the culture and prosperity of Zadar at that time was the founding of the [[University of Zadar]], built in 1396 by the [[Dominican Order]] (the oldest university in present-day Croatia).\n\n=== 15th to 18th centuries ===\n[[File:Dalmazia1560.png|thumb|200 px|The Adriatic in 1560, with Dalmatia and Zadar]]\nAfter the death of Louis I, Zadar came under the rule of Sigmund of Luxembourg and later [[Ladislaus of Naples]], who, witnessing his loss of influence in Dalmatia, sold Zadar and his dynasty's rights to Dalmatia to Venice for 100,000 [[ducat (coin)|ducats]] on 31 July 1409. Venice therefore obtained control over Zadar without a fight, but was confronted by the resistance and tensions of important Zadar families. These attempts were met with persecution and confiscation. Zadar remained the administrative seat of Dalmatia, but this time under the rule of Venice, which expanded over the whole Dalmatia, except the Republic of Ragusa/Dubrovnik. During that time [[Giorgio da Sebenico]], a renaissance sculptor and architect, famous for his work on the Cathedral of \u0160ibenik, was born in Zadar. Other important people followed, such as [[Luciano Laurana|Luciano]] and [[Francesco Laurana]], known worldwide for their sculptures and buildings.\n[[File:Kopnena Vrata (Zadar) 01.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Zadar's \"Kopnena vrata\" (Landward Gate) with the [[Lion of Saint Mark]], a symbol of the [[Republic of Venice]], above it]]\n\nThe 16th and 17th centuries were noted in Zadar for Ottoman attacks. Ottomans captured the continental part of Zadar at the beginning of the 16th century and the city itself was all the time in the range of Turkish artillery. Due to that threat, the construction of a new system of castles and walls began. These defense systems changed the way the city looked. To make place for the pentagon castles many houses and churches were taken down, along with an entire suburb: Varo\u0161 of St. Martin. After the 40-year-long construction Zadar became the biggest fortified city in Dalmatia, empowered by a system of castles, bastions and canals filled with seawater. The city was supplied by the water from public city cisterns. During the complete makeover of Zadar, many new civic buildings were built, such as the City Lodge and City Guard on the Gospodski Square, several army barracks, but also some large new palaces.\n\nIn contrast to the insecurity and Ottoman sieges and destruction, an important culture evolved midst the city walls. During the 16th and the 17th centuries Zadar was still under the influence of the [[Renaissance]], which had created an environment in which [[Renaissance art|arts]] and [[Renaissance literature|literature]] could flourish, despite the ongoing conflicts outside the city walls. This period saw the rise of many important [[Italian Renaissance]] figures, such as the painters [[Giorgio Ventura]] and [[Andrea Meldolla]],<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Andrea_Schiavone.aspx#1 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018122207/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Andrea_Schiavone.aspx#1 |date=18 October 2012 }}</ref> and the [[humanist]] scholar [[Giovanni Francesco Fortunio]], who wrote the first Italian grammar book. Meanwhile, the activity of the Croatian writers and poets became prolific ([[Jerolim Vidoli\u0107]], [[Petar Zorani\u0107]], [[Brne Karnaruti\u0107]], [[Juraj Barakovi\u0107]], [[\u0160ime Budini\u0107]]).\n\nDuring the continuous Ottoman danger the population stagnated by a significant degree along with the economy. During the 16th and 17th centuries several large-scale epidemics of bubonic plague erupted in the city. After more than 150 years of Turkish threat Zadar was not only scarce in population, but also in material wealth. Venice sent new colonists and, under the firm hand of archbishop [[Vicko Zmajevi\u0107]], the Arbanasi (Catholic Albanian refugees) settled in the city, forming a new suburb. Despite the shortage of money, the Teatro Nobile (Theater for Nobility) was built in 1783. It functioned for over 100 years.\n\n=== 19th and 20th centuries ===\n[[File:Zara1909.jpg|thumb|Zadar waterfront in 1909. ''G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151 steamboat'' can be seen in the distance]]\nIn 1797 with the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], the Republic of Venice, including Zadar, came under the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] crown. In 1806 it was briefly given to the Napoleonic [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], until in 1809 it was added to the French [[Illyrian Provinces]]. In November 1813 an Austrian force [[Siege of Zara (1813)|blockaded the town]] with the assistance of two British [[Royal Navy]] frigates [[HMS Havannah (1811)|HMS ''Havannah'']] and [[HMS Weazel (1805)|''Weazle'']] under the [[George Cadogan, 3rd Earl Cadogan|3rd Earl of Cadogan]]. On 9 December the French garrison of Zadar capitulated, and by the end of the year all of Dalmatia was brought back under the control of the Austrian Empire. After the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815) until 1918, the town (bilingual name ''Zara \u2013 Zadar'' ) remained part of the [[Austrian monarchy]] (Austria side after the [[compromise of 1867]]), head of the district of the same name, one of the 13 ''Bezirkshauptmannschaften'' in [[Kingdom of Dalmatia|Dalmatia]].<ref>Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den \u00f6sterreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm KLEIN, 1967</ref> The Italian name was officially used before 1867. It remained also the capital of Dalmatia province (''Kronland'').\n\nAlthough during the first half of the 19th century the city population stagnated due to low natural increase, the city started to spread from the old center; citizens from the old city created the new suburb of Stanovi in the north.<ref>V.

Under the pressure of the population increase, the city continued to spread to Vo\u0161tarnica and Arbanasi quarters, and the bridge in the city port was built. Except being the administrative center of the province, agriculture, industry of liqueurs and trade were developed, many brotherhoods were established, similar to the Central European trade guilds. The southern city walls were torn down, new coastal facilities were built and Zadar became an ''open port''.<ref>An ''open port'' is one that allows foreign shipping. See [[List of free ports]].</ref> As the city developed economically, it developed culturally. A large number of printshops, new libraries, archives, and theatres sprung up.

With the arrival of an Italian army of occupation in the city on 4 November 1918, the Italian faction gradually assumed control, a process which was completed on 5 December when it took over the governorship.<ref>Ante Brali\u0107, Zadar u vrtlogu propasti Habsbur\u0161ke Monarhije (1917\u20131918), \u010casopis za suvremenu povijest 1/2006, Hrvatski institut za povijest, Zagreb, 2006, pp. 243\u2013266</ref> With the Treaty of Versailles (10 January 1920) Italian claims on Dalmatia contained in the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] were nullified, but later on the agreements between the [[Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] set in the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Treaty of Rapallo]] (12 November 1920) gave Zadar with other small local territories to Italy. The Zadar enclave, a total of {{convert|104|km\u00b2|0|abbr=off}}, included the city of Zadar, the municipalities of Bokanjac, Arbanasi, Crno, part of Diklo (a total of 51&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of territory and 17,065 inhabitants) and the islands of [[Lastovo]] and [[Palagru\u017ea]] ({{convert|53|km\u00b2|0|abbr=off}}, 1,710 inhabitants). The territory was organized into a small Italian province.\nAccording to the 1921 census, in the comune of Zara there were 12075 Italians and 1255 Croatians.<ref>https://drive.google.com/file/d/13BSpAtRR2qhrUS9wB_MKxidnkI12ONxc/view</ref>\n\n=== World War II ===\n[[File:Zadar bombardiran 1944.78577.jpg|thumb|[[Bombing of Zadar in World War II]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]]]\n[[File:Akademski slikar Bo\u017eidar Jakac na zadrskem forumu 1961 (4).jpg|thumb|Painter [[Bo\u017eidar Jakac]] at the destroyed Zadar Forum, 1961]]\n\n[[Nazi Germany|Germany]], Italy, and other [[Axis Powers]], [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded the Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] on 6 April 1941. Zadar held a force of 9,000 and was one of the starting points of the invasion. The force reached \u0160ibenik and Split on 15 April (2 days before surrender). Civilians were previously evacuated to [[Ancona]] {{citation needed span|text=and [[Pula]]|date=December 2013}}. Occupying [[Mostar]] and Dubrovnik, on 17 April they met invading troops that had started out from Italian-occupied [[Albania]]. On 17 April the Yugoslav government surrendered, faced with the [[Wehrmacht]]'s overwhelming superiority.\n\n[[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] required the newly formed Nazi puppet-state, the so-called [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH) to hand over almost all of Dalmatia (including Split) to Italy under the [[Treaties of Rome (1941)|Rome Treaties]].\n\nThe city became the center of a new Italian territorial entity, the [[Governorate of Dalmatia]], including the provinces of Zara (now Zadar), Cattaro (now [[Kotor]]), and Spalato ([[Split, Croatia|Split]]).\n\nUnder Italian rule, the Croats were subjected to a policy of forced assimilation. This created immense resentment among the Yugoslav people. The [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav Partisan movement]] took root in Zadar, even though more than 70% of population of Zadar was Italian.\n\nAfter Mussolini was removed from power on 25 July 1943, [[Armistice with Italy|Italy signed an armistice with the Allies]], which was announced on 8 September 1943, and the Italian army collapsed. Then on 12 September 1943, [[Gran Sasso raid|Mussolini was rescued by the Germans]], and formed the Nazi-puppet [[Italian Social Republic]]. German troops (114th J\u00e4ger Division) entered Zadar on 10 September and took over. This avoided a temporary liberation by Partisans, as was the case in Split and \u0160ibenik. Zadar was placed under the control of the Italian Social Republic.\n\nThe NDH proclaimed the Treaty of Rome to be void and occupied Dalmatia with German support. But the NDH was prevented from taking over Zadar on the grounds that Zadar itself was not subject to the conditions of the 1941 Treaty of Rome. Despite this, NDH leader [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] designated Zadar as the capital of the Sidraga-Ravni Kotari County, although the county administrator could not enter the city.\n\nDuring World War II, Zadar was [[Bombing of Zadar in World War II|bombed by the Allies]], from November 1943 to October 1944. Estimated fatalities range from under 1,000, up to as many as 4,000 of the city's 20,000 inhabitants. Over the course of the bombing, 80% of the city's buildings were destroyed. Zadar has been called the \"[[Dresden]] of the Adriatic\" because of perceived similarities to the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Allied bombing of Dresden]].{{sfn|Graovac Matassi|2014|p=169}}\n\nIn late October 1944 the German army and most of the Italian civilian administration abandoned the city, except the Vice Prefect [[Giacomo Vuxani]].{{sfn|Begonja|2005|p=72}} On 31 October 1944, the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] seized the city, until then a part of Mussolini's [[Italian Social Republic]].

In the first decade after the war, the city's population increase was slow and still did not reach its pre-war numbers. The Italian exodus from the city continued and in a few years was almost total. It is estimated that around 10,000 Italians emigrated from Zadar.{{sfn|Graovac Matassi|2014|p=170}} In October 1953, the last Italian schools in the area were closed. Today the Italian community counts only a few hundred people, gathered into a local community (''Comunit\u00e0 degli Italiani di Zara'').<ref>{{cite web|title=Comunita' degli Italiani di Zara (in Italian)|url=http://www.italianidizara.eu/}}</ref>\n\nThe city recorded a large population increase in the late 1950s and the 1960s, mainly due to immigration as the government encouraged migration from rural areas to urban centers and their industrial development. Construction of the [[Adriatic Highway]], railway and civil airport contributed to the development of [[Tourism in Croatia|tourism]] and the accessibility of Zadar.{{sfn|Graovac Matassi|2014|p=171}} Population growth slowed down in the following decades. In the late 1980s, due to the economic crisis in Yugoslavia, Zadar's economy began stagnating.{{sfn|Graovac Matassi|2014|p=171}}\n\n=== Croatian War of Independence (1991\u20131995) ===\nIn 1990, [[Serbs of Croatia|Serb]] separatists from [[Dalmatian Hinterland]] sealed roads and effectively blocked Dalmatia from the rest of Croatia during the [[Log Revolution]]. In March 1991, the [[Croatian War of Independence]] broke out that affected Zadar and its surroundings.{{sfn|Graovac Matassi|2014|p=174}} A number of non-Serbs were expelled from the area and several Croatian policemen were killed resulting in the [[1991 anti-Serb riot in Zadar]].<ref>James Gow, The Serbian Project and its Adversaries, p. 159.

Serb forces also attacked a number of nearby towns and villages, the most brutal attack being the [[\u0160kabrnja massacre]] in which Krajina [[Territorial Defense (Yugoslavia)|Territorial Defense]] troops killed 62 Croatian civilians and five [[prisoners of war]].\n\nLand connections with [[Zagreb]] were severed for over a year. The only link between the north and south of the country was via the island of [[Pag (island)|Pag]]. The [[siege]] of the city lasted from 1991 until January 1993 when Zadar and the surrounding area came under the control of Croatian forces and the bridge link with the rest of Croatia was reestablished in [[Operation Maslenica]]. Attacks on the city continued until [[Operation Storm|the end of the war]] in 1995.\n\nSome of the countryside along the No. 8 highway running north east is still sectioned off due to [[land mine]]s.\n\n== Main sights ==\n[[File:Croatia Zadar.webm|thumbnail|The main sites of the city]]\n[[File:Roman forum zadar croatia.jpg|thumb|Roman Forum]]\n[[File:Kathedrale St. Anastasia.jpg|thumb|[[Zadar Cathedral|Cathedral of St. Anastasia]]]]\n[[File:SVMarija04.jpg|thumb|[[St. Mary's Church, Zadar|St. Mary's Church]], located in the old city opposite St. Donatus' Church]]\n[[File:Zadar, Trg pet bunara - ve\u010der.JPG|thumb|Five Wells Square in the evening]]\n\n=== Architecture ===\nZadar gained its [[urbanization|urban]] structure in Roman times; during the time of [[Julius Caesar]] and Emperor [[Augustus]], the town was fortified and the [[city wall]]s with towers and gates were built. On the western side of the town were the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]], the [[basilica]] and the [[temple]], while outside the town were the [[amphitheatre]] and [[cemetery|cemeteries]]. The [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]] which supplied the town with water is partially preserved. Inside the ancient town, a [[medieval]] town had developed with a series of [[Church (building)|churches]] and [[monastery|monasteries]] being built.\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], Zadar fully gained its urban aspect, which has been maintained until today. In the first half of the 16th century, Venice fortified the town with a new system of defensive walls on the side facing land. In the course of the century architectural building in the [[Renaissance]] style was continued and defensive trenches (Fo\u0161a) were also built. They were completely buried during the Italian occupation until that in 1873, under [[Austria]]n rule, the ramparts of Zadar were converted from fortifications into elevated promenades commanding extensive seaward and landward views, thus being the wall lines preserved; of its four old gates one, the Porta Marina, incorporates the relics of a Roman arch, and another, the Porta di Terraferma, was designed in the 16th century by the Veronese artist [[Michele Sanmicheli]]. In the bombardments during the Second World War entire blocks were destroyed, but some structures survived.\n\nMost important landmarks include:\n* Roman [[Forum (Roman)|Forum]] \u2013 the largest on the eastern side of the Adriatic,<ref>Zadar Region Tourist Board, [http://www.zadar.hr/episcopal-complex-and-roman-forum-in-zadar/ Episcopal complex and Roman forum in Zadar], accessed 5 September 2017</ref> founded by the first Roman Emperor [[Augustus]], as shown by two stone inscriptions about its completion dating from the 3rd century.\n* Most Roman remains were used in the construction of the fortifications, but two squares are embellished with lofty marble columns; a Roman tower stands on the eastern side of the town; and some remains of a [[Roman aqueduct]] may be seen outside the ramparts.\n* [[Church of St. Donatus]] \u2013 a monumental round building from the 9th century in pre-Romanesque style, traditionally but erroneously said to have been erected on the site of a temple of Juno. It is the most important preserved structure of its period in Dalmatia; the massive dome of the [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] is surrounded by a vaulted gallery in two stories which also extends around the three [[apses]] to the east. The [[church treasury]] contains some of the finest Dalmatian metalwork; notably the pastoral staff of Bishop Valaresso (1460).\n* [[Cathedral of St. Anastasia, Zadar|St. Anastasia's Cathedral]] (Croatian: ''Sv.

University comprises 25 departments with more than 6.000 students.\n\n==Science==\nIn 1998, Zadar hosted the [[Central European Olympiad in Informatics]] (CEOI).\n\n[[File:Zadar - luka Fo\u0161a (sjeveroistok).jpg|220px|thumb|Fo\u0161a harbour]]\n\n== Transportation ==\nIn the 20th century, roads became more important than sea routes, but Zadar remained an important traffic point. The main road along the Adriatic passes through the city. In the immediate vicinity, there is the [[A1 (Croatia)|Zagreb-Dubrovnik highway]], finished up to Split in 2005. Zadrans can access to the highway by two interchanges: Zadar 1 exit in the north and Zadar 2 highway hub near [[Zemunik]] in the south. The southern interchange is connected to Zadar port of [[Ga\u017eenica]] by the [[D424 (Croatia)|D424]] expressway.\n\nSince 1966, a railway has linked Zadar with [[Knin]], where it joins the main railway from Zagreb to Split. The line was meant to be upgraded in around 2013 to be able to support speeds of up to 120&nbsp;km/h. Unfortunately, a Serbian mine was discovered on part of the line, causing the project to be abandoned and the line closed. However, passenger trains between Knin and Zadar are currently replaced with the buses that run in organization of national railway company. The buses run three times a day in each direction, taking around two hours.\n\nZadar also has an international [[ferry]] line to Ancona in Italy. Ships also connect Zadar with islands of its [[archipelago]] from two ferry ports: one located in the town center serving [[catamaran]] services and other one located in the suburb of [[Ga\u017eenica]] serving [[ferry]] and distant services.\n\n[[Zadar International Airport]] is located in Zemunik, around {{convert|14|km|0|abbr=off}} to the east of Zadar and accessible via the expressway. The airport is experiencing year on year an average of 30% increase in passenger traffic mainly due to arrivals of lowcost carriers ([[Ryanair]], [[InterSky]], [[JobAir]], etc.) connecting Zadar from the end of March through October with over 20 cities throughout Europe.\n\n== Sports ==\n[[File:Dvorana Visnjik Zadar.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Kre\u0161imir \u0106osi\u0107 Hall]]]]\nThe basketball club is [[KK Zadar]], the football club [[NK Zadar]], and the local handball club [[RK Zadar]]. The bowling club Kugla\u010dki klub Zadar is also very successful. Zadar is also the hometown of Croatian [[team handball|handball]] player [[Ivan Nin\u010devi\u0107]] and [[soccer|football]] players [[Luka Modri\u0107]], [[\u0160ime Vrsaljko]] and [[Danijel

continuously-inhabited]] [[Croatia]]n city. It is situated on the [[Adriatic Sea]], at the northwestern part of [[Ravni Kotari]] region. Zadar serves as the seat of [[Zadar County]] and of the wider northern [[Dalmatia]]n region. The city proper covers {{convert|25|km2|abbr =on}} with a population of 75,082 {{as of | 2011 | alt = in 2011}}, making it the second-largest city of the region of Dalmatia and the fifth-largest city in the country.\n\nThe area of present-day Zadar traces its earliest evidence of human life from the late [[Stone Age]], while numerous settlements date as early as the [[Neolithic]] {{Citation needed|reason= citation needed for the claims|date= April 2019}}. Before the [[Illyrians]], an ancient [[Mediterranean]] people of an [[Indo-European culture]] inhabited the area. Zadar traces its origin to its 9th-century BC founding as a settlement of the Illyrian tribe of [[Liburnians]] known as ''Iader'' {{Citation needed|reason=serious claim requiring a citation |date=April 2019}}.\n\nIn 59 BC it was renamed ''Iadera'' when it became a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[municipium]]. In 48 BC it became a Roman [[Colonia (Roman)|''colonia'']]. During Roman rule Zadar acquired the characteristics of a traditional [[Ancient Roman architecture#City design|Ancient Roman city]] with a regular road network, a public square ([[Forum (Roman)|''forum'']]), and an elevated ''[[capitolium]]'' with a temple.\n\nAfter the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in 476 and the destruction of [[Salona]] by the [[Avars (Caucasus)|Avars]] and [[Croats]] in 614, Zadar became the capital of the Byzantine [[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] of [[Dalmatia (theme)|Dalmatia]]. In the beginning of the 9th century, Zadar came briefly under [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish]] rule, but the [[Pax Nicephori]] returned it to the Byzantines in 812. The first Croatian rulers gained brief control over the city in 10th century. In 998 Zadar swore allegiance to [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] [[Pietro Orseolo II]] and became a vassal of the [[Republic of Venice]]. In 1186 it placed itself under the protection of [[B\u00e9la III of Hungary|B\u00e9la III, King of Hungary and Croatia]].\n\nIn 1202 the Venetians, with the help of [[Fourth Crusade|Crusaders]], [[Siege of Zara|reconquered and sacked]] Zadar. Hungary regained control over the city in 1358, when it [[Treaty of Zadar|was given]] to king [[Louis I of Hungary]]. In 1409 king [[Ladislaus of Naples|Ladislaus I]] sold Zadar to the Venetians. When the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Turks conquered]] the Zadar hinterland at the beginning of the 16th century, the town became an important stronghold, ensuring Venetian trade in the Adriatic, the administrative center of the Venetian territories in Dalmatia and a cultural center. This fostered an environment in which [[Renaissance art|arts]] and [[Renaissance literature|literature]] could flourish, and between the 15th and 17th centuries Zadar came under the influence of the [[Renaissance]], giving rise to many important [[Dalmatian Italians|Italian Renaissance]] figures like [[Giorgio Ventura]] and [[Giovanni Francesco Fortunio]], who wrote the first Italian grammar book, and many famous Croatian writers, such as [[Petar Zorani\u0107]], [[Brne Krnaruti\u0107]], [[Juraj Barakovi\u0107]] and [[\u0160ime Budini\u0107]], who wrote in the [[Croatian language]].\n\nAfter the fall of Venice in 1797, Zadar came under the Austrian rule until 1918, except for the period of [[Illyrian provinces|short-term French rule]] (1805\u20131813), still remaining the capital of Dalmatia. During French rule the first newspaper in the Croatian language, ''[[Il Regio Dalmata \u2013 Kraglski Dalmatin]]'', was published in Zadar (1806\u20131810). During the 19th century Zadar functioned as a center of the [[Illyrian movement|Croatian movement]] for cultural and national revival in a context of increasing polarization and politicization of ethnic identities between Croats and [[Dalmatian Italians]].\n\t \t\t\nWith the 1920 [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|Treaty of Rapallo]] Zadar was given to the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. During [[World War II]], it was [[Bombing of Zadar in World War II|bombed]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and witnessed the [[Istrian-Dalmatian exodus|evacuation of ethnic Italians]]. Partisans captured the city on 1 November{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} 1944; in 1947 it officially became part of [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|SR Croatia]], a federal constituent of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]], whose armed forces [[Battle of Zadar|defended it]] in October 1991 from the Serb forces who aimed to capture it.\n\nToday, Zadar is a historical center of Dalmatia, Zadar County's principal political, cultural, commercial, industrial, educational, and transportation centre. Zadar is also the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zadar]]. Because of its rich heritage, Zadar is today one of the most popular Croatian tourist destinations, named \"entertainment center of the Adriatic\" by ''[[The Times]]'' and \"Croatia's new capital of cool\" by ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author= Termin odr\u017eavanja |url= http://www.poslovniturizam.com/destinacije/zadar/6/ |title= Destinacije \u2013 Zadar \u2013 3000 godina povijesti \u2013 Kongresni turizam |publisher= Poslovni turizam |date= 7 November 2016 |accessdate= 9 March 2017}}</ref> In 2016 the Belgian portal ''Europe's Best Destinations.com''  named Zadar the \"Best European Destination\" after a three-week period of online voting involving more than 288,000 votes.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.europeanbestdestinations.com/best-of-europe/european-best-destinations-2016/ |title= Best places to travel in 2016 \u2013 Europe's Best Destinations |publisher= Europeanbestdestinations.com |accessdate= 9 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Site]] list included the fortified city of Zadar as part of [[Venetian Works of Defence between 15th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra \u2013 western Stato da Mar|Venetian Works of Defence between 15th and 17th centuries: ''Stato da Terra'' \u2013 western ''Stato da Mar'']] in 2017.<ref>\n{{cite web\nlast1= Centre|first1= UNESCO World Heritage\n|title= Venetian Works of Defence between 15th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra \u2013 western Stato da Mar\n|url= https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1533/multiple=1&unique_number=2162\n|website= whc.unesco.org\n|accessdate= 11 July 2017|language= en\n}}\n</ref>\n\n== Etymology and historical names ==\nThe name of the city of Zadar emerged as ''Iadera'' and ''Iader'' in [[ancient history|ancient]] times, but the origin of the name is older. It was most probably related to a hydrographical term, coined by an ancient Mediterranean people and their [[Old European culture|Pre-Indo-European]] language. They transmitted it to later settlers, the [[Liburnians]]. The name of the Liburnian settlement was first mentioned by a [[Greek language|Greek]] inscription from Pharos ([[Stari Grad, Croatia|Stari grad]]) on the island of [[Hvar]] in 384 BC, where the citizens of Zadar were noted as {{lang|grc|\u038a\u03b1\u03b4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03af}} (''Iadasinoi''). According to the Greek source [[Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax]] the city was {{lang|grc|\u038a\u03b4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1}} (''Idassa''), probably a Greek [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] of the original Liburnian expression.\n\nDuring [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] the name was often recorded in sources in [[Latin language|Latin]] in two forms: ''Iader'' in the inscriptions and in the writings of classic writers, ''Iadera'' predominantly among the late Antiquity writers, while usual [[ethnonym]]s were ''Iadestines'' and ''Iadertines''. The accent was on the first syllable in both Iader and Iadera forms, which influenced the early-Medieval [[Dalmatian language]] forms ''Jadra'', ''Jadera'' and ''Jadertina'', where the accent kept its original place.\n\nIn the Dalmatian language, ''Jadra'' (''Jadera'') was pronounced ''Zadra'' (''Zadera''), due to the phonetic transformation of ''Ja''- to ''Za''-. That change was also reflected in the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] name ''Zadar'' (recorded as ''Zader'' in the 12th century<ref>Adnotationes chronologicae in codice missalisaeculi XII. ap. Florianus:Fontesdomestici Vol. III, 209.</ref>), developed from masculine ''Zad\u044ar\u044a''. An ethnonym graphic ''Jaderani'' from the legend of [[Saint Chrysogonus]] in the 9th century, was identical to the initial [[Old Church Slavonic|old-Slavic]] form ''Zad\u044arane'', or [[Renaissance]] Croatian ''Zadrani''.\n\nThe Dalmatian names ''Jadra'', ''Jadera'' were transferred to other languages; in the [[Venetian language]] ''Jatara'' (hyper-urbanism in the 9th century) and ''Zara'', [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]] ''Giara'', Latin ''Diadora'' ([[Constantine VII]] in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', 10th century, probably an error in the transcription of ''di iadora''), [[Old French]] ''Jadres'' (Geoffroy de Villehardouin in the chronicles of the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1202), [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''J\u0101dhara'' ({{lang|ar|\u062c\u0627\u0630\u064e\u0631\u0629}}) and ''J\u0101dara'' ({{lang|ar|\u062c\u0627\u062f\u064e\u0631\u0629}}) ([[Al-Idrisi]], 12th century), ''Iadora'' (Guido, 12th century), [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''Jazara'', ''Jara'', ''Sarra'' (14th century) and the others.<ref>M.Sui\u0107: Pro\u0161lost Zadra 1, ''Zadar u starom vijeku'', Filozofski Fakultet Zadar, 1981</ref>\n\nJadera became Zara when it fell under the authority of the [[Republic of Venice]] in the 15th century.\nZara was later used by the [[Austrian Empire]] in the 19th century, but it was provisionally changed to Zadar/Zara from 1910 to 1920; from 1920<ref>See: [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920]]</ref> to 1947<ref>See: [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947]]</ref> the city became part of [[Italy]] as Zara, and finally was named ''Zadar'' in 1947.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Zadar Bridge 02.jpg|thumb|Zadar Bridge]]\nZadar faces the islands of [[Ugljan]] and [[Pa\u0161man]] (part of the [[Zadar Archipelago]]), from which it is separated by the narrow Zadar Strait. The promontory on which the old city stands used to be separated from the mainland by a deep moat which has since been filled. The harbour, to the north-east of the town, is safe and spacious.\n\n===Climate===\nZadar has a borderline [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] (''Cfa'') and [[Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa''), since only one summer month has less than {{convert|40|mm|in}} of rainfall, preventing it from being classified as solely humid subtropical or Mediterranean.

since prehistoric times. The earliest evidence of human life comes from the Late [[Stone Age]], while numerous settlements have been dated as early as the [[Neolithic]]. Before the [[Illyrians]], the area was inhabited by an ancient [[Mediterranean]] people of a [[Old European culture|pre-Indo-European culture]]. They assimilated with the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] who settled between the 4th and 2nd millennium BC into a new ethnical unity, that of the [[Liburnians]]. Zadar was a Liburnian settlement, laid out in the 9th century BC, built on a small stone islet and embankments where the old city stands and tied to the mainland by the overflown narrow isthmus, which created a natural port in its northern strait.<ref>M. Sui\u0107, Pro\u0161lost Zadra I, Zadar u starom vijeku, Filozofski fakultet Zadar, 1981, pages 61\u2013113</ref>\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nThe Liburnians, an Illyrian tribe, were known as great sailors and merchants, but also had a reputation for piracy in the later years. By the 7th century BC, Zadar had become an important centre for their trading activities with the [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] and other Mediterranean peoples. Its population at that time is estimated at 2,000.<ref>V. Graovac, \"Populacijski razvoj Zadra\", ''Sveu\u010dili\u0161te u Zadru'', 2004, page 52</ref> From the 9th to the 6th century there was certain cultural unity in the Adriatic Sea, with the general Liburninan seal, whose naval supremacy meant both political and economical authority through several centuries.<ref>M. Zaninovi\u0107, Liburnia Militaris, Opusc. Archeol. 13, 43\u201367 (1988), UDK 904.930.2(497.13)>>65<<, page 47</ref> Due to its geographical position, Zadar developed into a main seat of the Liburnian thalassocracy and took a leading role in the Liburnian ''tetradekapolis'', an organization of 14 communes.<ref>M. Sui\u0107, Liburnija i Liburni, VAMZ, 3.S., XXIV-XXV,1991\u201392, UDK 931/939 (36)\"6/9\", pages 55\u201366</ref>\n\nThe people of Zadar, ''Iadasinoi'', were first mentioned in 384 BC as the allies of the natives of [[Hvar]] and the leaders of an eastern Adriatic coast coalition in the fight against the Greek colonizers. An expedition of 10,000 men in 300 ships sailed out from Zadar and laid siege to the Greek colony [[Stari Grad, Croatia|Pharos]] in the island of Hvar, but the [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracusan]] fleet of ''Dionysus'' was alerted and attacked the siege fleet. The naval victory went to the Greeks which allowed them relatively safer further colonization in the southern [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]].<ref>M. Sui\u0107, Pro\u0161lost Zadra I, Zadar u starom vijeku, Filozofski fakultet Zadar, 1981, pages 127\u2013130</ref>\n\n[[File:Liburnia 1st AD.png|thumb|200px|left|Zadar (Iader) and the other cities of the Liburnian tetradecapolis in the age of the Roman conquest]]\nThe archaeological remains have shown that the main centres of Liburnian territorial units or municipalities were already urbanized in the last centuries BC; before the Roman conquest, Zadar held a territory of more than {{convert|600|km2|abbr=on}} in the 2nd century BC.\n\nIn the middle of the 2nd century BC, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] began to gradually invade the region. Although being first Roman enemies in the Adriatic Sea, the Liburnians, mostly stood aside in more than 230 years of Roman wars with the Illyrians, to protect their naval and trade connections in the sea. In 59 BC Illyricum was assigned as a ''provincia'' (zone of responsibility) to [[Julius Caesar]] and Liburnian Iadera became a Roman [[municipium]].\n\nThe Liburnian naval force was dragged into the Roman civil war between [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Pompey]] in 49 BC, partially by force, partially because of the local interests of the participants, the Liburnian cities. Caesar was supported by the urban Liburnian centres, like ''Iader'' (Zadar), ''Aenona'' ([[Nin, Croatia|Nin]]) and ''Curicum'' ([[Krk]]), while the city of ''Issa'' ([[Vis (town)|Vis]]) and the rest of the Liburnians gave their support to Pompey. In 49 BC near the island of Krk, the \"Navy of Zadar\", equipped by the fleets of a few Liburnian cities and supported by some Roman ships, lost an important naval battle against Pompey supporting the \"Liburnian navy\". The civil war was prolonged until the end of 48 BC, when Caesar rewarded his supporters in Liburnian ''Iader'' and [[Dalmatae|Dalmatian]] ''[[Salona]]'', by giving the status of the [[Colonia (Roman)|Roman colonies]] to their communities.<ref>M. Zaninovi\u0107, Liburnia Militaris, Opusc. Archeol. 13, 43\u201367 (1988), UDK 904.930.2(497.13)>>65<<, pages 56, 57</ref> Thus the city was granted the title ''colonia Iulia Iader'', after its founder, and in the next period some of the Roman colonists (mostly [[legionary]] veterans) settled there.\n\nThe real establishment of the Roman province of Illyricum occurred not earlier than 33 BC and [[Augustus|Octavian]]'s military campaign in Illyria and Liburnia, when the Liburnians finally lost their naval independence and their galleys and sailors were incorporated into the Roman naval fleets.\n\n[[File:Zadar Forum.jpg|Roman Forum in Zadar|200px|thumb|right|The Roman forum remains in Zadar]]\nFrom the early days of Roman rule, Zadar gained its Roman urban character and developed into one of the most flourishing centres on the eastern Adriatic coast, a state of affairs which lasted for several hundred years. The town was organised according to the typical Roman street system with a rectangular street plan, a forum, thermae, a sewage and water supply system that came from [[lake Vrana (Dalmatia)|lake Vrana]], by way of a {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=off}} long aqueduct. It did not play a significant role in the Roman administration of Dalmatia, although the archaeological finds tell us about a significant growth of economy and culture.\n\n[[Christianity]] did not bypass the Roman province of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]]. Already by the end of the 3rd century Zadar had its own bishop and founding of its Christian community took place;<ref>Z. Strika, \"Kako i gdje se prvi put spominje zadarski biskup?\", ''Radovi HAZU u Zadru'', sv. 46/2004, UDK 262.12\"2/3\"(497.5) Zadar, pp. 31\u201364</ref> a new religious centre was built north of the forum together with a basilica and a baptistery, as well as other ecclesiastical buildings. According to some estimates, in the 4th century it had probably around ten thousand citizens, including the population from its ''[[:wiktionary:ager#Latin|ager]]'', the nearby islands and hinterland, an admixture of the indigenous Liburnians and Roman colonists.\n\n=== Early Middle Ages ===\n{{Infobox Historic Site\n|name=Defensive System of Zadar\n|image= Stadt Tor Porta terraferma, Zadar 3.JPG\n|caption= Landward Gate\n|location=Zadar County, {{CRO}}\n|area=\n|built=\n|architect=\n|architecture=\n|governing_body=\n|designation1=WHS\n|designation1_partof=[[Venetian Works of Defence between 15th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra \u2013 western Stato da Mar]]\n|designation1_type=Cultural\n|designation1_criteria=iii, iv\n|designation1_date = [[List of World Heritage Sites by year of inscription#2017 (41st session)|2017]] <small>(41 [[World Heritage Committee|Session]])</small>\n|designation1_number= [https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1533 1533]\n|designation1_free1name = Region\n|designation1_free1value=[[World Heritage Sites in Europe|Europe and North America]]\n}}\nDuring the [[Migration Period]] and the Barbarian invasions, Zadar stagnated. In 441 and 447 Dalmatia was ravaged by the [[Huns]], after the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], in 481 Dalmatia became part of the [[Ostrogothic kingdom]], which, besides Italy, already included the more northerly parts of [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyricum]], i.e. [[Pannonia]] and [[Noricum]].\n\nIn the 5th century, under the rule of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]], Zadar became poor with many civic buildings ruined due to its advanced age. About the same time (6th century) it was hit by an earthquake, which destroyed entire complexes of monumental Roman architecture, whose parts would later serve as material for building houses. This caused a loss of population and created demographic changes in the city, then gradually repopulated by the inhabitants from its hinterland.<ref>V. Graovac, Populacijski razvoj Zadra, Sveu\u010dili\u0161te u Zadru, Geoadria, Vol. 9, No. 1, UDK: 314.8(497.5 Zadar), page 53</ref> However, during six decades of Gothic rule, the Goths saved those old Roman Municipal institutions that were still in function, while religious life in Dalmatia even intensified in the last years, so that there was a need for the foundation of additional bishoprics.<ref>G. Novak, Uprava i podjela, Zbornik FF u Zagrebu I, 1951, pages 83\u201385</ref>\n\nIn 536 the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian the Great]] started a military campaign to reconquer the territories of the former Western Empire (see [[Gothic War (535\u2013552)|Gothic War]]); and in 553 Zadar passed to the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In 568 Dalmatia was devastated by an [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avar]] invasion; although further waves of attacks by Avar and [[Slavs|Slav]] tribes kept up the pressure, it was the only city which survived due to its protective belt of inland plains. The Dalmatian capital [[Salona]] was captured and destroyed in the 640s, so Zadar became the new seat of the Byzantine [[archonty of Dalmatia]], territorially reduced to a few coastal cities with their agers and municipal lands at the coast and the islands nearby. The prior of Zadar had jurisdiction over all Byzantine Dalmatia, so Zadar enjoyed metropolitan status at the eastern Adriatic coast. At this time rebuilding began to take place in the city.\n\n[[File:Church of Saint Donatus, Zadar - September 2017.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Church of St. Donatus|St. Donatus church]], 9th century]]\nAt the beginning of the 9th century the Zadar bishop [[Donatus of Zadar|Donatus]] and the city duke Paul mediated in the dispute between the [[Holy Roman empire]] under [[Pepin of Italy|Pepin]] and the Byzantine Empire. The [[Franks]] held Zadar for a short time, but the city was returned to Byzantium by a decision of the 812 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (812)|Treaty of Aachen]].<ref name=Dalmatia>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Dalmatia |volume=7 |pages=772\u2013776 |first=Kingsley |last=Jayne}}</ref>\n\nZadar's economy revolved around the sea, fishing and sea trade in the first centuries of the Middle Ages. Thanks to saved Antique ager, adjusted municipal structure and a new strategic position, it became the most important city between the [[Kvarner]] islands and [[Ka\u0161tela]] Bay. Byzantine Dalmatia was not territorially unified, but an alliance of city municipalities headed by Zadar, and the large degree of city autonomy allowed the development of Dalmatian cities as free communes. Forced to turn their attention seawards, the inhabitants of Zadar focused on shipping, and the city became a naval power to rival [[Venice]]. The citizens were [[Dalmatian language]] speakers, but from the 7th century the [[Croatian language]] started to spread in the region, becoming predominant in the inland and the islands to the end of the 9th century.<ref>Nada Klai\u0107, Ivo Petricioli, Pro\u0161lost Zadra \u2013 knjiga II, Zadar u srednjem vijeku do 1409., Filozofski fakultet Zadar, 1976, page 59</ref>\n\nThe Mediterranean and Adriatic cities developed significantly during a period of peace from the last decades of the 9th to the middle of the 10th century. Especially favourable conditions for navigation in the Adriatic Sea occurred since the [[Saracen]] raids had finished. Also the adjustment of relations with the [[Croats]] enabled Zadar merchants to trade with its rich agriculture hinterland<ref>Nada Klai\u0107, Ivo Petricioli, Pro\u0161lost Zadra II, Zadar u srednjem vijeku do 1409., Filozofski fakultet Zadar, 1976, page 84</ref> where the [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Kingdom of Croatia]] had formed, and trade and political links with Zadar began to develop. Croatian settlers began to arrive, becoming commonplace by the 10th century, occupying all city classes, as well as important posts, like those of prior, judge, priest and others. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}} In 925, [[Tomislav I of Croatia|Tomislav]], the Duke of Croatian Dalmatia, united Croatian [[Dalmatia]] and Pannonia establishing the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Medieval)|Croatian Kingdom]]. He was also granted the position of protector of Dalmatia (the cities) by the Byzantine Emperor.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} He thus politically united the Dalmatian cities with their hinterland.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nFollowing the dynastic struggle between the descendants of king [[Stjepan Dr\u017eislav]] after his death in 997, the city was [[Siege of Zadar (998)|besieged]] in 998 by the army of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] emperor [[Samuel of Bulgaria|Samuel]] but managed to defend itself.\n\n=== High Middle Ages ===\nAt the time of Zadar's medieval development, the city became a threat to Venice's ambitions, because of its strategic position at the centre of the eastern Adriatic coast.\n\nIn 998 Zadar sought Venetian protection against the [[Neretvians|Neretvian pirates]].<ref name=Dalmatia/><ref name=\"Zara\">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Zara|volume=28 |page=959}}</ref> The Venetians were quick to fully exploit this opportunity: in 998 a fleet commanded by [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] [[Pietro Orseolo II]], after having defeated pirates, landed in [[Kor\u010dula]] and [[Lastovo]]. Dalmatia was taken by surprise and offered little serious resistance. [[Trogir]] was the exception and was subjected to Venetian rule only after a bloody struggle, whereas [[Dubrovnik]] was forced to pay tribute.<ref name=Dalmatia/><ref name=Illyria>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Illyria |volume=14 |pages=325\u2013327}}</ref> Tribute previously paid by Zadar to Croatian kings, was redirected to Venice, a state of affairs which lasted for several years.\n\nZadar citizens started to work for the full independence of Zadar and from the 1030s the city was formally a vassal of the Byzantine Empire. The head of this movement was the mightiest Zadar [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] family \u2013 the [[House of Madi|Madi]].<ref>N. Klai\u0107, I.

The city was repeatedly invaded by Venice between 1111 and 1154 and then once more between 1160 and 1183, when it finally rebelled, appealing to the Pope and to the Croato-Hungarian throne for protection.\n\n[[File:Pallucchini Tintoretto 590 1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Siege of Zara|Siege of the city in 1202]]]]\n\nZadar was especially devastated in 1202 after the Venetian [[Enrico Dandolo|Doge Enrico Dandolo]] used the [[crusaders]], on their [[Fourth Crusade]] to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], to lay siege to the city.<ref name=\"Sethre\">{{cite book|last=Sethre|first=Janet|pages=54\u201355|title=The Souls of Venice|year=2003|isbn=0-7864-1573-8}}</ref> The crusaders were obliged to pay Venice for sea transport to [[Egypt]].

In 1204 Domald was ''comes'' (duke) of Zadar, but the following year (1205) Venetian authority was re-established and a peace agreement signed with hard conditions for the citizens. The only profit which the Communal Council of Zadar derived from this was one third of the city's harbour taxes, probably insufficient even for the most indispensable communal needs.<ref>N.

Its commerce was suffering due to a lack of autonomy under Venice, while it enjoyed considerable autonomy under the much more feudal Kingdom of Croatia-Hungary. A number of insurrections followed (1242\u20131243, 1320s, 1345\u20131346 \u2013 the latter resulted in a [[Siege of Zadar (1345\u201346)|sixteen-month-long Venetian siege]]) which finally resulted in Zadar coming back under the crown of King [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]] of Croatia-Hungary under the [[Treaty of Zara|Treaty of Zadar]], in 1358. After the [[War of Chioggia]] between Genoa and Venice, [[Chioggia]] concluded on 14 March 1381 an alliance with Zadar and [[Trogir]] against Venice, and finally Chioggia became better protected by Venice in 1412, because [[\u0160ibenik]] became in 1412 the seat of the main [[customs]] office and the seat of the salt consumers office with a [[monopoly]] on the salt trade in Chioggia and on the whole [[Adriatic Sea]]. After the death of Louis, Zadar recognized the rule of king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], and after him, that of [[Ladislaus of Naples]]. During his reign Croatia-Hungary was enveloped in a bloody civil war. In 1409, Venice, seeing that Ladislaus was about to be defeated, and eager to exploit the situation despite its relative military weakness, offered to buy his \"rights\" on Dalmatia for a mere 100,000 ducats. Knowing he had lost the region in any case, Ladislaus accepted. Zadar was, thus sold back to the Venetians for a paltry sum.\n\nThe population of Zadar during the Medieval period was predominantly Croatian, according to numerous archival documents,<ref>N.

Thanks to its political and trading achievements, and also to its skilled seamen, Zadar played an important role among the cities on the east coast of the Adriatic. This affected its appearance and culture: many churches, rich monasteries and palaces for powerful families were built, together with the [[Chest of Saint Simeon]]. One of the best examples of the culture and prosperity of Zadar at that time was the founding of the [[University of Zadar]], built in 1396 by the [[Dominican Order]] (the oldest university in present-day Croatia).\n\n=== 15th to 18th centuries ===\n[[File:Dalmazia1560.png|thumb|200 px|The Adriatic in 1560, with Dalmatia and Zadar]]\nAfter the death of Louis I, Zadar came under the rule of Sigmund of Luxembourg and later [[Ladislaus of Naples]], who, witnessing his loss of influence in Dalmatia, sold Zadar and his dynasty's rights to Dalmatia to Venice for 100,000 [[ducat (coin)|ducats]] on 31 July 1409. Venice therefore obtained control over Zadar without a fight, but was confronted by the resistance and tensions of important Zadar families. These attempts were met with persecution and confiscation. Zadar remained the administrative seat of Dalmatia, but this time under the rule of Venice, which expanded over the whole Dalmatia, except the Republic of Ragusa/Dubrovnik. During that time [[Giorgio da Sebenico]], a renaissance sculptor and architect, famous for his work on the Cathedral of \u0160ibenik, was born in Zadar. Other important people followed, such as [[Luciano Laurana|Luciano]] and [[Francesco Laurana]], known worldwide for their sculptures and buildings.\n[[File:Kopnena Vrata (Zadar) 01.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Zadar's \"Kopnena vrata\" (Landward Gate) with the [[Lion of Saint Mark]], a symbol of the [[Republic of Venice]], above it]]\n\nThe 16th and 17th centuries were noted in Zadar for Ottoman attacks. Ottomans captured the continental part of Zadar at the beginning of the 16th century and the city itself was all the time in the range of Turkish artillery. Due to that threat, the construction of a new system of castles and walls began. These defense systems changed the way the city looked. To make place for the pentagon castles many houses and churches were taken down, along with an entire suburb: Varo\u0161 of St. Martin. After the 40-year-long construction Zadar became the biggest fortified city in Dalmatia, empowered by a system of castles, bastions and canals filled with seawater. The city was supplied by the water from public city cisterns. During the complete makeover of Zadar, many new civic buildings were built, such as the City Lodge and City Guard on the Gospodski Square, several army barracks, but also some large new palaces.\n\nIn contrast to the insecurity and Ottoman sieges and destruction, an important culture evolved midst the city walls. During the 16th and the 17th centuries Zadar was still under the influence of the [[Renaissance]], which had created an environment in which [[Renaissance art|arts]] and [[Renaissance literature|literature]] could flourish, despite the ongoing conflicts outside the city walls. This period saw the rise of many important [[Italian Renaissance]] figures, such as the painters [[Giorgio Ventura]] and [[Andrea Meldolla]],<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Andrea_Schiavone.aspx#1 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018122207/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Andrea_Schiavone.aspx#1 |date=18 October 2012 }}</ref> and the [[humanist]] scholar [[Giovanni Francesco Fortunio]], who wrote the first Italian grammar book. Meanwhile, the activity of the Croatian writers and poets became prolific ([[Jerolim Vidoli\u0107]], [[Petar Zorani\u0107]], [[Brne Karnaruti\u0107]], [[Juraj Barakovi\u0107]], [[\u0160ime Budini\u0107]]).\n\nDuring the continuous Ottoman danger the population stagnated by a significant degree along with the economy. During the 16th and 17th centuries several large-scale epidemics of bubonic plague erupted in the city. After more than 150 years of Turkish threat Zadar was not only scarce in population, but also in material wealth. Venice sent new colonists and, under the firm hand of archbishop [[Vicko Zmajevi\u0107]], the Arbanasi (Catholic Albanian refugees) settled in the city, forming a new suburb. Despite the shortage of money, the Teatro Nobile (Theater for Nobility) was built in 1783. It functioned for over 100 years.\n\n=== 19th and 20th centuries ===\n[[File:Zara1909.jpg|thumb|Zadar waterfront in 1909. ''G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151 steamboat'' can be seen in the distance]]\nIn 1797 with the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], the Republic of Venice, including Zadar, came under the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] crown. In 1806 it was briefly given to the Napoleonic [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], until in 1809 it was added to the French [[Illyrian Provinces]]. In November 1813 an Austrian force [[Siege of Zara (1813)|blockaded the town]] with the assistance of two British [[Royal Navy]] frigates [[HMS Havannah (1811)|HMS ''Havannah'']] and [[HMS Weazel (1805)|''Weazle'']] under the [[George Cadogan, 3rd Earl Cadogan|3rd Earl of Cadogan]]. On 9 December the French garrison of Zadar capitulated, and by the end of the year all of Dalmatia was brought back under the control of the Austrian Empire. After the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815) until 1918, the town (bilingual name ''Zara \u2013 Zadar'' ) remained part of the [[Austrian monarchy]] (Austria side after the [[compromise of 1867]]), head of the district of the same name, one of the 13 ''Bezirkshauptmannschaften'' in [[Kingdom of Dalmatia|Dalmatia]].<ref>Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den \u00f6sterreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm KLEIN, 1967</ref> The Italian name was officially used before 1867. It remained also the capital of Dalmatia province (''Kronland'').\n\nAlthough during the first half of the 19th century the city population stagnated due to low natural increase, the city started to spread from the old center; citizens from the old city created the new suburb of Stanovi in the north.<ref>V.

Under the pressure of the population increase, the city continued to spread to Vo\u0161tarnica and Arbanasi quarters, and the bridge in the city port was built. Except being the administrative center of the province, agriculture, industry of liqueurs and trade were developed, many brotherhoods were established, similar to the Central European trade guilds. The southern city walls were torn down, new coastal facilities were built and Zadar became an ''open port''.<ref>An ''open port'' is one that allows foreign shipping. See [[List of free ports]].</ref> As the city developed economically, it developed culturally. A large number of printshops, new libraries, archives, and theatres sprung up.

The archives of the official Austro-Hungarian censuses conducted around the end of 19th century show that Italian was the primary language spoken by the majority of the people in the city (9,018 Italians and 2,551 Croatians in 1900), but only by a third of the population in the entire county (9,234 vs. 21,753 the same year).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/FHSS&CISOPTR=32528&REC=16&CISOSHOW=32386|title=Full 1900 Census|website=byu.edu|accessdate=13 March 2018}}</ref><ref>Page 189 of Luciano Monzali \u2013 ''The Italians of Dalmatia''- University of Toronto Press Incorporated \u2013 2009 [https://books.google.com/books?id=kMXURN7sxh4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=italians+of+dalmatia&hl=it&sa=X&ei=HMIGT5X7BsGe-wbi86C5AQ&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=italians%20of%20dalmatia&f=false]</ref><ref>Page 451 of ''I censimenti della popolazione dell\u2018Istria, con Fiume e Trieste, e di alcune citt\u00e0 della Dalmazia tra il 1850 e il 1936'' \u2013 Guerrino Perselli, Universit\u00e0 Popolare di Trieste \u2013 1993</ref>\n\nDuring the 19th century, the conflict between Zadar's Italian and Croatian communities grew in intensity and changed its nature. Until the beginning of the century it had been of moderate intensity and mainly of a class nature (under Venetian rule the Italians were employed in the most profitable activities, such as trade and administration). With the development of the modern concept of national identity across Europe, national conflicts started to mark the political life of Zadar.\n[[File:Zara-Zadar-1920-1947.png|thumb|Italian territory of Zara/Zadar 1920\u20131947]]\n\nDuring the second part of the 19th century, Zadar was subject to the same policy enacted by the [[Austrian Empire]] in [[History of South Tyrol|South-Tyrol]], the [[Austrian Littoral]] and [[Dalmatia]] and consisting in fostering the local German or Croatian culture at the expense of the Italian.<ref>[[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Joseph]] is quoted as giving, on 12 November 1866, a direct order to his ministers to: \"decisively oppose the influence of the Italian element still present in some Kronl\u00e4nder [crown lands], and to aim unsparingly and without the slightest compunction at the Germanization or Croatization \u2013 depending on the circumstances \u2013 of the areas in question, through a suitable entrustment of posts to political magistrates and teachers, as well as through the influence of the press in South Tyrol, Dalmatia, and the Adriatic Coast.\", quoted in {{cite book|author=Monzali, Luciano|date=2009|title=The Italians of Dalmatia: from Italian unification to World War I|others=Translated by Shanti Evans|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto Canada|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=kMXURN7sxh4C&pg=PA78 78]|isbn=978-0-8020-9621-0}} citing the archives of ''Die Protokolle des \u00d6sterreichischen Ministerrates 1848/1867.

On 17 April the Yugoslav government surrendered, faced with the [[Wehrmacht]]'s overwhelming superiority.\n\n[[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] required the newly formed Nazi puppet-state, the so-called [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH) to hand over almost all of Dalmatia (including Split) to Italy under the [[Treaties of Rome (1941)|Rome Treaties]].\n\nThe city became the center of a new Italian territorial entity, the [[Governorate of Dalmatia]], including the provinces of Zara (now Zadar), Cattaro (now [[Kotor]]), and Spalato ([[Split, Croatia|Split]]).\n\nUnder Italian rule, the Croats were subjected to a policy of forced assimilation. This created immense resentment among the Yugoslav people. The [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav Partisan movement]] took root in Zadar, even though more than 70% of population of Zadar was Italian.\n\nAfter Mussolini was removed from power on 25 July 1943, [[Armistice with Italy|Italy signed an armistice with the Allies]], which was announced on 8 September 1943, and the Italian army collapsed.

German troops (114th J\u00e4ger Division) entered Zadar on 10 September and took over. This avoided a temporary liberation by Partisans, as was the case in Split and \u0160ibenik. Zadar was placed under the control of the Italian Social Republic.\n\nThe NDH proclaimed the Treaty of Rome to be void and occupied Dalmatia with German support. But the NDH was prevented from taking over Zadar on the grounds that Zadar itself was not subject to the conditions of the 1941 Treaty of Rome. Despite this, NDH leader [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] designated Zadar as the capital of the Sidraga-Ravni Kotari County, although the county administrator could not enter the city.\n\nDuring World War II, Zadar was [[Bombing of Zadar in World War II|bombed by the Allies]], from November 1943 to October 1944.

Serb forces also attacked a number of nearby towns and villages, the most brutal attack being the [[\u0160kabrnja massacre]] in which Krajina [[Territorial Defense (Yugoslavia)|Territorial Defense]] troops killed 62 Croatian civilians and five [[prisoners of war]].\n\nLand connections with [[Zagreb]] were severed for over a year. The only link between the north and south of the country was via the island of [[Pag (island)|Pag]]. The [[siege]] of the city lasted from 1991 until January 1993 when Zadar and the surrounding area came under the control of Croatian forces and the bridge link with the rest of Croatia was reestablished in [[Operation Maslenica]]. Attacks on the city continued until [[Operation Storm|the end of the war]] in 1995.\n\nSome of the countryside along the No. 8 highway running north east is still sectioned off due to [[land mine]]s.\n\n== Main sights ==\n[[File:Croatia Zadar.webm|thumbnail|The main sites of the city]]\n[[File:Roman forum zadar croatia.jpg|thumb|Roman Forum]]\n[[File:Kathedrale St. Anastasia.jpg|thumb|[[Zadar Cathedral|Cathedral of St. Anastasia]]]]\n[[File:SVMarija04.jpg|thumb|[[St. Mary's Church, Zadar|St. Mary's Church]], located in the old city opposite St. Donatus' Church]]\n[[File:Zadar, Trg pet bunara - ve\u010der.JPG|thumb|Five Wells Square in the evening]]\n\n=== Architecture ===\nZadar gained its [[urbanization|urban]] structure in Roman times; during the time of [[Julius Caesar]] and Emperor [[Augustus]], the town was fortified and the [[city wall]]s with towers and gates were built. On the western side of the town were the [[Forum (Roman)|forum]], the [[basilica]] and the [[temple]], while outside the town were the [[amphitheatre]] and [[cemetery|cemeteries]]. The [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]] which supplied the town with water is partially preserved. Inside the ancient town, a [[medieval]] town had developed with a series of [[Church (building)|churches]] and [[monastery|monasteries]] being built.\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], Zadar fully gained its urban aspect, which has been maintained until today. In the first half of the 16th century, Venice fortified the town with a new system of defensive walls on the side facing land. In the course of the century architectural building in the [[Renaissance]] style was continued and defensive trenches (Fo\u0161a) were also built. They were completely buried during the Italian occupation until that in 1873, under [[Austria]]n rule, the ramparts of Zadar were converted from fortifications into elevated promenades commanding extensive seaward and landward views, thus being the wall lines preserved; of its four old gates one, the Porta Marina, incorporates the relics of a Roman arch, and another, the Porta di Terraferma, was designed in the 16th century by the Veronese artist [[Michele Sanmicheli]]. In the bombardments during the Second World War entire blocks were destroyed, but some structures survived.\n\nMost important landmarks include:\n* Roman [[Forum (Roman)|Forum]] \u2013 the largest on the eastern side of the Adriatic,<ref>Zadar Region Tourist Board, [http://www.zadar.hr/episcopal-complex-and-roman-forum-in-zadar/ Episcopal complex and Roman forum in Zadar], accessed 5 September 2017</ref> founded by the first Roman Emperor [[Augustus]], as shown by two stone inscriptions about its completion dating from the 3rd century.\n* Most Roman remains were used in the construction of the fortifications, but two squares are embellished with lofty marble columns; a Roman tower stands on the eastern side of the town; and some remains of a [[Roman aqueduct]] may be seen outside the ramparts.\n* [[Church of St. Donatus]] \u2013 a monumental round building from the 9th century in pre-Romanesque style, traditionally but erroneously said to have been erected on the site of a temple of Juno. It is the most important preserved structure of its period in Dalmatia; the massive dome of the [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] is surrounded by a vaulted gallery in two stories which also extends around the three [[apses]] to the east. The [[church treasury]] contains some of the finest Dalmatian metalwork; notably the pastoral staff of Bishop Valaresso (1460).\n* [[Cathedral of St. Anastasia, Zadar|St. Anastasia's Cathedral]] (Croatian: ''Sv. Sto\u0161ija''), basilica in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style built in the 12th to 13th century (high Romanesque style), the largest cathedral in Dalmatia.\n* The churches of [[Saint Chrysogonus|St. Chrysogonus]] and St. Simeon are also architectural examples in the Romanesque style. The latter houses the ark or reliquary of St. Simeon (1380), made in gilted silver by Francesco Antonio da Milano under commission of queen [[Elizabeth of Hungary]].\n* [[St Chrysogonus's Church]] \u2013 monumental Romanesque church of very fine proportions and refined Romanesque ornaments.\n* St Elijah's Church (Croatian: ''Sv.

The 15th and 16th centuries were marked by important activities of Croatians writing in the national language: [[Jerolim Vidoli\u0107]], [[Petar Zorani\u0107]] (who wrote the first Croatian novel, [[Planine]]), [[Brne Karnaruti\u0107]], [[Juraj Barakovi\u0107]], [[\u0160ime Budini\u0107]].\n\nUnder French rule (1806\u20131810), the first Dalmatian newspaper ''[[Il Regio Dalmata \u2013 Kraglski Dalmatin]]'' was published in Zadar.

It was the first institute of higher learning in the country. In 1807 it ceased to become an independent institution and its functions were taken over by other local universities. In 1956 the [[University of Zagreb]], the country's second oldest university, re-established it as its satellite Faculty of Arts campus. The Faculty later became a part of the [[University of Split]], and in 2003, a full-fledged independent university. University comprises 25 departments with more than 6.000 students.\n\n==Science==\nIn 1998, Zadar hosted the [[Central European Olympiad in Informatics]] (CEOI).\n\n[[File:Zadar - luka Fo\u0161a (sjeveroistok).jpg|220px|thumb|Fo\u0161a harbour]]\n\n== Transportation ==\nIn the 20th century, roads became more important than sea routes, but Zadar remained an important traffic point. The main road along the Adriatic passes through the city. In the immediate vicinity, there is the [[A1 (Croatia)|Zagreb-Dubrovnik highway]], finished up to Split in 2005. Zadrans can access to the highway by two interchanges: Zadar 1 exit in the north and Zadar 2 highway hub near [[Zemunik]] in the south. The southern interchange is connected to Zadar port of [[Ga\u017eenica]] by the [[D424 (Croatia)|D424]] expressway.\n\nSince 1966, a railway has linked Zadar with [[Knin]], where it joins the main railway from Zagreb to Split. The line was meant to be upgraded in around 2013 to be able to support speeds of up to 120&nbsp;km/h. Unfortunately, a Serbian mine was discovered on part of the line, causing the project to be abandoned and the line closed. However, passenger trains between Knin and Zadar are currently replaced with the buses that run in organization of national railway company. The buses run three times a day in each direction, taking around 2 hours.\n\nZadar also has an international [[ferry]] line to Ancona in Italy. Ships also connect Zadar with islands of its [[archipelago]] from two ferry ports: one located in the town center serving [[catamaran]] services and other one located in the suburb of [[Ga\u017eenica]] serving [[ferry]] and distant services.\n\n[[Zadar International Airport]] is located in Zemunik, around {{convert|14|km|0|abbr=off}} to the east of Zadar and accessible via the expressway. The airport is experiencing year on year an average of 30% increase in passenger traffic mainly due to arrivals of lowcost carriers ([[Ryanair]], [[Germanwings]], [[InterSky]], [[JobAir]], etc.) connecting Zadar from the end of March through October with over 20 cities throughout Europe.\n\n== Sports ==\n[[File:Dvorana Visnjik Zadar.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Kre\u0161imir \u0106osi\u0107 Hall]]]]\nThe basketball club is [[KK Zadar]], the football club [[NK Zadar]], and the local handball club [[RK Zadar]].
