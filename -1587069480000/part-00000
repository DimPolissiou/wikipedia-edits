{"title_page": "Ball in and out of play", "text_new": "[[Image:Ball in and out of play 2.svg|thumb|right|Balls A, B and C are still in play as they have not wholly crossed the touchline. Ball D has completely passed over the touchline, and is out of play.]]\n'''The ball in and out of play''' is the ninth law of the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] of [[association football]], and describes to the two basic states of play in the game.\n\n==In play==\n\nThe ball remains ''in play'' from the beginning of each period to the end of that period, except when:\n\n*The ball leaves the [[football (soccer) field|field]] by entirely crossing a goal line or touch line with or without touching the ground (this includes [[Scoring in association football|when a goal is scored]]); or\n*Play is stopped by the [[referee (association football)|referee]] (for example when The Laws have been infringed, an injured player requires medical attention, or a period of play has concluded).\n*The ball touches a match official, remains on the field of play, and one of the following occurs:\n**A team starts a promising attack\n**The ball goes directly into the goal\n**The team possessing the ball changes<ref name=\"changes_2019\">{{cite-web |url=http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/793/103202_200519_LotG_201920_EN_SinglePage.pdf |page=88 |title=Laws of the Game 2019/20}}</ref>\n\nThe first criterion can be phrased as \"''all'' of the ball must cross ''all'' of the line\" and is of particular importance in decisions regarding goals. The question of whether the ball has crossed the line has often caused controversy in high-profile matches, such as in the example of [[Geoff Hurst]]'s goal in the [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|1966 World Cup Final]], that put England 3-2 up over West Germany in extra time. <ref>{{cite web|last1=Bray|first1=Ken|title=When is a goal not a goal?|url=https://plus.maths.org/content/when-goal-not-goal|website=plus.maths.org|accessdate=16 February 2018|language=en}}</ref> The Law specifically notes that the ball remains in play if it rebounds off a [[Football_pitch#Goals|goal frame]] or corner flag onto the field, or in any case of the ball touching a match official that is not mentioned above. \n\nWhen the ball is in play players may play the ball, contest the ball, and goals may be scored. Players are liable to punishment for committing [[Foul (football)|fouls]]. [[Substitution (association football)|Substitution]]s may not occur whilst the ball is in play.\n\nIn the case a foul is committed or misconduct occurs, the referee may \"play advantage\" and elect to allow play to continue if the team of the player who was victimized would be benefited if play were to continue. Once play has stopped, the referee may choose to issue punishments.\n\n==Restarts==\n\nWhen the ball becomes out of play, the ball is put back into play by the appropriate restart. The restarts in football are:\n* [[Kick-off (association football)|Kick-off]]: following a goal by the opposing team, or to begin each period of play. ([https://www.fifa.com/en/laws/Laws8_01.htm Law 8]).\n* [[Throw-in]]: when the ball has entirely crossed the touch line; awarded to opposing team to that which last touched the ball. ([https://www.fifa.com/en/laws/Laws15_01.htm Law 15]).\n* [[Goal kick]]: when the ball has entirely crossed the byline having last been touched by an attacker; awarded to defending team. ([https://www.fifa.com/en/laws/Laws16_01.htm Law 16]).\n\n* [[Corner kick]]: when the ball has entirely crossed the byline having last been touched by a defender; awarded to attacking team. ([https://www.fifa.com/en/laws/Laws17_01.htm Law 17]).\n* [[Indirect free kick]]: awarded to the opposing team following \"non-penal\" fouls (like obstruction, offside, etc.), certain technical infringements, or when play is stopped to caution/send-off an opponent without a specific foul having occurred. ([https://www.fifa.com/en/laws/Laws13_01.htm Law 13]).\n* [[Direct free kick]]: awarded to fouled team following certain listed \"penal\" fouls, ([https://www.fifa.com/en/laws/Laws13_01.htm Law 13]).\n* [[Penalty kick (football)|Penalty kick]]: awarded to fouled team following \"penal\" foul having occurred in their opponent's penalty area. ([https://www.fifa.com/en/laws/Laws14_01.htm Law 14]).\n* [[Dropped-ball]]: occurs when the ball touches an official in the circumstances described above<ref name=\"changes_2019\" />, or when the referee has stopped play for any other reason (e.g. a serious injury to a player, interference by an external party, or a ball becoming defective). This restart is uncommon in adult games. ([https://www.fifa.com/en/laws/Laws8_03.htm Law 8]).\n\nOnce the ball is out of play, the only restart is the restart appropriate for the reason the ball went out of play in the first place; subsequent actions do not change the restart. For example, if the ball goes out of play because of a foul by Team A against Team B, the restart must be a free kick to Team B even if a Team B player strikes an opponent; offending Team B player would, however, be liable for misconduct (i.e. [[Misconduct (football)|yellow card]] or [[Misconduct (football)|red card]]).\n\nNote, however, that the referee may change the ''original'' restart if he realises he has made an error or on the advice of his [[Assistant referee (association football)|assistant referee]]s, provided play has not yet restarted. For example, if the ball has gone out of play because the ball was kicked into goal by Team A and the referee has signalled that a goal has been scored, but then notices that an assistant referee has indicated a foul by a Team A player immediately before the goal was scored, the referee would change to the correct restart of a free kick to Team B where the foul occurred.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite web|title=The Laws of the Game|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/footballdevelopment/refereeing/81/42/36/log2013en_neutral.pdf|work=FIFA|accessdate=14 February 2014}}\n\n{{Association football laws}}\n\n[[Category:Laws of association football]]\n[[Category:Association football terminology]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Ball in and out of play 2.svg|thumb|right|Balls A, B and C are still in play as they have not wholly crossed the touchline. Ball D has completely passed over the touchline, and is out of play.]]\n'''The ball in and out of play''' is the ninth law of the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] of [[association football]], and describes to the two basic states of play in the game.\n\n==In play==\n\nThe ball remains ''in play'' from the beginning of each period to the end of that period, except when:\n\n*The ball leaves the [[football (soccer) field|field]] by entirely crossing a goal line or touch line with or without touching the ground (this includes [[Scoring in association football|when a goal is scored]]); or\n*Play is stopped by the [[referee (association football)|referee]] (for example when The Laws have been infringed, an injured player requires medical attention, or a period of play has concluded).\n*The ball touches a match official, remains on the field of play, and one of the following occurs:\n**A team starts a promising attack\n**The ball goes directly into the goal\n**The team possessing the ball changes<ref name=\"changes_2019\">{{cite-web |url=http://static-3eb8.kxcdn.com/documents/793/103202_200519_LotG_201920_EN_SinglePage.pdf |page=88 |title=Laws of the Game 2019/20}}</ref>\n\nThe first criterion can be phrased as \"''all'' of the ball must cross ''all'' of the line\" and is of particular importance in decisions regarding goals. The question of whether the ball has crossed the line has often caused controversy in high profile matches, such as in the example of [[Geoff Hurst]]'s goal in the [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|1966 World Cup Final]], that put England 3-2 up over West Germany in extra time. <ref>{{cite web|last1=Bray|first1=Ken|title=When is a goal not a goal?|url=https://plus.maths.org/content/when-goal-not-goal|website=plus.maths.org|accessdate=16 February 2018|language=en}}</ref> The Law specifically notes that the ball remains in play if it rebounds off a [[Football_pitch#Goals|goal frame]] or corner flag onto the field, or in any case of the ball touching a match official that is not mentioned above. \n\nWhen the ball is in play players may play the ball, contest the ball, and goals may be scored. Players are liable to punishment for committing [[Foul (football)|fouls]]. [[Substitution (association football)|Substitution]]s may not occur whilst the ball is in play.\n\nIn the case a foul is committed or misconduct occurs, the referee may \"play advantage\" and elect to allow play to continue if the team of the player who was victimized would be benefited if play were to continue. Once play has stopped, the referee may chose to issue punishments.\n\n==Restarts==\n\nWhen the ball becomes out of play, the ball is put back into play by the appropriate restart. The restarts in football are:\n* [[Kick-off (association football)|Kick-off]]: following a goal by the opposing team, or to begin each period of play. ([https://www.fifa.com/en/laws/Laws8_01.htm Law 8]).\n* [[Throw-in]]: when the ball has entirely crossed the touch line; awarded to opposing team to that which last touched the ball. ([https://www.fifa.com/en/laws/Laws15_01.htm Law 15]).\n* [[Goal kick]]: when the ball has entirely crossed the byline having last been touched by an attacker; awarded to defending team. ([https://www.fifa.com/en/laws/Laws16_01.htm Law 16]).\n\n* [[Corner kick]]: when the ball has entirely crossed the byline having last been touched by a defender; awarded to attacking team. ([https://www.fifa.com/en/laws/Laws17_01.htm Law 17]).\n* [[Indirect free kick]]: awarded to the opposing team following \"non-penal\" fouls (like obstruction, offside, etc.), certain technical infringements, or when play is stopped to caution/send-off an opponent without a specific foul having occurred. ([https://www.fifa.com/en/laws/Laws13_01.htm Law 13]).\n* [[Direct free kick]]: awarded to fouled team following certain listed \"penal\" fouls, ([https://www.fifa.com/en/laws/Laws13_01.htm Law 13]).\n* [[Penalty kick (football)|Penalty kick]]: awarded to fouled team following \"penal\" foul having occurred in their opponent's penalty area. ([https://www.fifa.com/en/laws/Laws14_01.htm Law 14]).\n* [[Dropped-ball]]: occurs when the ball touches an official in the circumstances described above<ref name=\"changes_2019\" />, or when the referee has stopped play for any other reason (e.g. a serious injury to a player, interference by an external party, or a ball becoming defective). This restart is uncommon in adult games. ([https://www.fifa.com/en/laws/Laws8_03.htm Law 8]).\n\nOnce the ball is out of play, the only restart is the restart appropriate for the reason the ball went out of play in the first place; subsequent actions do not change the restart. For example, if the ball goes out of play because of a foul by Team A against Team B, the restart must be a free kick to Team B even if a Team B player strikes an opponent; offending Team B player would, however, be liable for misconduct (i.e. [[Misconduct (football)|yellow card]] or [[Misconduct (football)|red card]]).\n\nNote, however, that the referee may change the ''original'' restart if he realises he has made an error or on the advice of his [[Assistant referee (association football)|assistant referee]]s, provided play has not yet restarted. For example, if the ball has gone out of play because the ball was kicked into goal by Team A and the referee has signalled that a goal has been scored, but then notices that an assistant referee has indicated a foul by a Team A player immediately before the goal was scored, the referee would change to the correct restart of a free kick to Team B where the foul occurred.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite web|title=The Laws of the Game|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/footballdevelopment/refereeing/81/42/36/log2013en_neutral.pdf|work=FIFA|accessdate=14 February 2014}}\n\n{{Association football laws}}\n\n[[Category:Laws of association football]]\n[[Category:Association football terminology]]\n", "name_user": "WereSpielChequers", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIn play:Typo fixing, replaced: may chose \u2192  may choose,typo(s) fixed: high profile \u2192 high-profile", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_in_and_out_of_play"}

Norval, who has not seen his father since he was five years old, makes the trek to a secluded cabin overlooking a lake in Oregon. His father, Brian, is initially welcoming to him, but soon begins to display aggressive tendencies and taunt and insult Norval, even threatening him with physical violence. All this comes to a head one afternoon when Brian attacks Norval with a meat cleaver, but in the ensuing struggle, Brian has a heart attack and immediately dies.\n\nDue to a lack of space at the local morgue, Norval is forced to keep his father's body in the cabin with him after having it embalmed. He attempts to stay in the house long enough for his mother to come and get him, but is repeatedly awakened by loud sounds from somewhere beneath the house. Finding a hidden family photo album, Norval sees a photo of his father and realizes that the dead man is not his father at all. He then finds a hidden hatch in the house leading to a bunker beneath, where he finds his real father bloodied and chained up. On his father's orders, he attempts to kill a man, Jethro, who arrives to torture his father, but Jethro escapes, promising revenge.\n\nAfter finally freeing Brian, Norval is forced to carry him upstairs into the house. Brian reveals to Norval that after he left him and his mother, he fled to Bangkok, where he and a group of three other men - Jethro, a large man named Dandy, and Gordon, who was pretending to be Norval's father - kidnapped the daughter of the richest man in Thailand and successfully held her for a large ransom. Brian fled the group with their shares of the money and has been on the run ever since, funding Norval and his mother's expensive way of life with the money. Dandy arrives at the house and attempts to kill Norval, but Norval stabs him in the genitals multiple times with a barbecue fork, then suffocates him with plastic wrap before beating him to death with the rest of the roll.\n\nNorval helps Brian leave the house, but Jethro returns armed with a crossbow. Brian advises Norval to hide in Jethro's trunk and kill him when he least expects it; Norval obliges, riding along to a motel where Jethro has arranged a meeting with a prostitute. While Jethro and the prostitute are engaged in a BDSM session, Norval steals the motel keys and a check spindle, slashes Jethro's tires, then attempts to sneak into Jethro's room through an adjoining room. Upon spotting him, the prostitute holds Norval in a headlock while Jethro stabs him several times with the spindle, then leaves. The prostitute is horrified that she is an accessory to Norval's death, but Norval stirs and exits the motel, finding Jethro has crashed his car into a sign that has partially decapitated him.\n\nJethro reveals to Norval that his mother was a prostitute who both Brian and Jethro slept with before Norval stabs him in the exposed part of his brain with the check spindle; Jethro exhales \"Arthur!\" before collapsing dead. Norval, wounded but alive, walks on foot back to the house where he left his father and lays down next to him on the lakeside.

When the United States formally entered [[World War II]] in 1941, ''Texas'' [[Battle of the Atlantic|escorted war convoys]] across the Atlantic and later shelled [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]]-held beaches for the [[North African campaign]] and the [[Operation Overlord|Normandy Landings]] before being transferred to the [[Pacific Theatre of World War II|Pacific Theater]] late in 1944 to provide [[naval gunfire support]] during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Battles of Iwo Jima]] and [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]]. ''Texas'' was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] in 1948, having earned a total of five [[battle star]]s for service in World War II, and is now a [[museum ship]] near [[Houston]], Texas. In addition to her combat service, ''Texas'' also served as a technological testbed during her career, and in this capacity became the first US battleship to mount [[anti-aircraft]] guns, the first US ship to [[fire-control system|control gunfire with directors and range-keepers]] (analog forerunners of today's computers), the first US battleship to launch an aircraft,<ref name=\"HNSVG\"/> from a platform on Turret 2,<ref name=\"DANFS\"/> and was one of the first to receive the CXAM-1 version of [[CXAM radar|CXAM]] production [[radar]] in the US Navy,<ref group=\"A\">CXAM was the first nonexperimental, nonprototype radar system developed by the US Navy. It was produced in small numbers for the US Navy and installed aboard certain capital ships, including battleships, [[heavy cruiser]]s, and [[aircraft carrier]]s. An upgraded version (CXAM-1) was later installed aboard other US Navy vessels, including a few ships that carried the original version.</ref>\n\nAmong the world's remaining battleships, ''Texas'' is notable for being the first US battleship to become a permanent museum ship,<ref group=\"A\">The first steel battleship to become a permanent museum ship was ''Mikasa''; the first US battleship to become a museum ship was {{USS|Oregon|BB-3|2}}. However, ''Oregon'' was placed on loan to the state of Oregon, and at the outbreak of World War II, she was offered back into service and later sunk and scrapped.

The problem was quickly resolved locally, but [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Henry T.

On 20 April, Wilson placed the matter before the [[United States Congress]] and sent orders to Rear Admiral [[Frank Friday Fletcher]], commanding the naval force off the Mexican coast, instructing him to land a force at [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]] and to seize the customs house there in retaliation for what is now known as the \"[[Tampico Affair|Tampico Incident]]\".

After a five-day stop at [[Hampton Roads]] from 14 to 19 May, she joined Rear Admiral Fletcher's force off Veracruz on 26 May.

The fleet alternated between bases at Scapa Flow and at the [[Firth of Forth]] in Scotland. ''Texas'' began her mission five days after her arrival at Scapa Flow, when she sortied with the entire fleet to reinforce the [[4th Battle Squadron]], then on duty in the North Sea. She returned to Scapa Flow the next day and remained until 8 March, when she put to sea on a convoy escort mission from which she returned on 13 March. ''Texas'' and her division mates entered the Firth of Forth on 12 April, but got underway again on the 17th to escort a convoy. The American battleships returned to base on 20 April. Four days later, ''Texas'' again stood out to sea to support the Second Battle Squadron the day after the German [[High Seas Fleet]] had sortied from [[Jade Bight|Jade Bay]] toward the Norwegian coast to threaten an Allied convoy. Forward units caught sight of the retiring Germans on 25 April, but at such an extreme range, bringing the German fleet into engagement with the Grand Fleet was not possible. The Germans returned to their base that day, and the Grand Fleet, including ''Texas'', did likewise on the next.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\n''Texas'' and her division mates passed a relatively inactive May in the Firth of Forth. On 9 June, she got underway with the other warships of the 6th Battle Squadron and headed back to the anchorage at Scapa Flow, arriving there the following day. From 30 June to 2 July, ''Texas'' and her colleagues acted as escort for American minelayers adding to the [[North Sea Mine Barrage]]. After a two-day return to Scapa Flow, ''Texas'' put to sea with the Grand Fleet to conduct two days of tactical exercises and war games. At the conclusion of those drills on 8 July, the fleet entered the Firth of Forth. For the remainder of World War I, ''Texas'' and the other battleships of Division&nbsp;9 continued to operate with the Grand Fleet as the 6th Battle Squadron. With the German Fleet increasingly tied to its bases in the estuaries of the [[Jade (river)|Jade]] and the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] rivers, the American and British ships settled into a routine schedule of operations with little-to-no hint of combat operations. That state of affairs lasted until the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Armistice]] ended hostilities on 11 November 1918.

Later, as the United States moved toward more active support of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] cause, the warship began convoying ships carrying [[Lend-Lease]] materiel to the United Kingdom. In February 1941, the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|US 1st Marine Division]] was activated aboard ''Texas''. On 1 February, [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Ernest King|Ernest J. King]] hoisted his flag as Commander-in-Chief of the re-formed Atlantic Fleet aboard ''Texas''.<ref name=\"DANFS\" /> That same year, while on Neutrality Patrol in the Atlantic, ''Texas'' was stalked unsuccessfully by the German submarine {{ship|German submarine|U-203||2}}.<ref name=\"HNSVG\" />\n\nOn Sunday, 7 December 1941, the day of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the battleship was at [[Casco Bay, Maine]], undergoing a rest and relaxation period following three months of watch duty at [[Naval Station Argentia]], [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]]. After 10 days at Casco Bay, she returned to Argentia and remained there until late January 1942, when she got underway to escort a convoy to England. After delivering her charges, the battleship patrolled waters near [[Iceland]] until March when she returned home.<ref name=\"DANFS\" /> At various times in 1942, the secondary battery was reduced to six 5-inch guns and the light AA battery was increased, adding two extra 1.1-inch/75-caliber quad mounts (these would be replaced by 10 quad mount [[Bofors 40 mm gun|{{cvt|40|mm}} Bofors]] in June 1943) and adding fourteen [[20 mm Oerlikon|{{cvt|20|mm}} Oerlikon]] cannons (increased to 44 by 1944), the attack on Pearl Harbor having demonstrated the need for this.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=205}} For the next six months, she continued convoy-escort missions to various destinations. On one occasion, she escorted [[Guadalcanal]]-bound Marines as far as [[Panama]]; on another, the warship screened service troops to [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]], on the west coast of Africa. More frequently, she made voyages to and from the United Kingdom escorting both cargo- and troop-carrying ships.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\n====Operation Torch====\n{{main|Operation Torch}}\nOn 23 October 1942, ''Texas'' embarked upon her first major combat operation when she sortied with Task Group 34.8 (TG 34.8), the Northern Attack Group for [[Operation Torch]], the invasion of North Africa. The objective assigned to this group was [[Kenitra|Port Lyautey]] in [[French protectorate in Morocco|French Morocco]]. The warships arrived off the assault beaches near the village of [[Mehdya, Morocco|Mehedia]] early in the morning of 8 November and began preparations for the [[Battle of Port Lyautey|invasion]]. ''Texas'' transmitted [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lt. General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s first \"Voice of Freedom\" broadcast, asking the French not to oppose Allied landings on North Africa. When the troops went ashore, ''Texas'' did not go into action immediately to support them. At that point in the war, the doctrine of amphibious warfare was still embryonic. Many Army officers did not recognize the value of prelanding bombardments. Instead, the Army insisted upon attempting a landing by surprise. ''Texas'' entered the battle early in the afternoon when the Army requested her to fire upon a [[Vichy France|Vichy French Army]] [[ammunition dump]] near Port Lyautey.<ref name=\"DANFS\" /> One more gunfire mission was provided on the 10th before the cease fire on 11 November.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Action Report, Battleship Texas\n|date=19 November 1942\n|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:N._Africa_Nov_1942_gun_firing.jpg\n|accessdate=2012-09-17\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107195923/http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:N._Africa_Nov_1942_gun_firing.jpg\n|archive-date=7 November 2012\n|url-status=live\n}}{{third-party-inline|date=September 2012}}</ref> Thus, unlike in later operations, she expended only 273 rounds of 14-inch shells and six rounds of 5-inch shells.

On the return trip, Cronkite was flown off ''Texas'' in one of her [[Vought OS2U Kingfisher|OS2U Kingfisher]] aircraft when Norfolk was within flying distance. He was granted permission to be flown the rest of the distance to Norfolk so that he could outpace a rival correspondent on {{USS|Massachusetts|BB-59|2}} to return to the US and to issue the first uncensored news reports to be published about Operation Torch.{{sfn|Cronkite|1996|p=89\u201390}} Cronkite's experiences aboard ''Texas'' launched his career as a [[war correspondent]].<ref name=\"HNSVG\" />\n\n====Operation Overlord====\n{{main|Operation Overlord}}\nThroughout 1943, ''Texas'' carried out the familiar role of convoy escort. With New York as her home port, she made numerous transatlantic voyages to such places as [[Casablanca]] and [[Gibraltar]], as well as frequent visits to ports in the British Isles. That routine continued into 1944 but ended on 22 April of that year when, at the European end of one such mission, she remained at the [[River Clyde|Clyde estuary]] in Scotland and began training for the invasion of [[Normandy]].<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\n=====Rehearsal=====\n[[File:USS Texas-5.jpg|thumb|''Texas'' off [[Norfolk, Virginia]], 15 March 1943]]\n\nDuring the next twelve days, ''Texas'' carried out many 14-inch gun-firing exercises with British battleships {{HMS|Ramillies|07|6}} and {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}}. The firing was done in conjunction with [[Royal Air Force]] airplanes as spotters. On 29 April, ''Texas'', {{USS|Nevada|BB-36|2}}, and {{USS|Arkansas|BB-33|2}} relocated to [[Belfast Lough]], [[Northern Ireland]]. There, final preparations were made, including the removal of the airplane catapult and the ship's OS2U Kingfisher observation planes. The three pilots who flew ''Texas''{{'}}s Kingfishers during this period were temporarily transferred to a newly formed squadron, [[VOS-7]], that was composed of the pilots who flew observation and scouting planes from the cruisers {{USS|Augusta|CA-31|2}}, {{USS|Quincy|CA-71|2}}, and {{USS|Tuscaloosa|CA-37|2}} and the battleships ''Arkansas'', ''Nevada'', and ''Texas''. VOS-7 received training in defensive fighter tactics, aerobatics, navigation, formation flying and spotting procedures in Royal Air Force [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]]; they flew spotting missions in the Spitfires because of the threat from German fighters. The pilots of VOS-7 would fly spotting missions for the US warships off [[Omaha Beach|Omaha]] and [[Utah Beach]]es during D-Day.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://spitfiresite.com/history/articles/2008/01/spitfires-in-us-navy.htm\n|title=VCS-7\n|accessdate=2012-09-17\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326061526/http://www.spitfiresite.com/history/articles/2008/01/spitfires-in-us-navy.htm\n|archive-date=26 March 2010\n|url-status=live\n}}</ref> Also, during this time additional radio equipment was added, including a device to detect and jam [[Kehl-Strasbourg radio control link|radio-guided]] missiles.<ref group=\"A\">Anti-ship missiles such as the [[Fritz X]] were among the first instances of short-range guided missiles during the Second World War.

During the final preparations, General Eisenhower came aboard on 19 May to speak to the crew. On 31 May, the ship was sealed and a briefing given to the crew about the upcoming invasion. For the invasion, ''Texas'' was designated Bombardment Force Flagship for Omaha Beach, in the Western Taskforce. Her firing area of Omaha was the western half, supporting the [[29th Infantry Division (United States)|US 29th Infantry Division]] and the US [[2nd Ranger Battalion]] at [[Pointe du Hoc]], and the US [[5th Ranger Battalion]], which had been diverted to Western Omaha to support the troops at Pointe du Hoc.<ref name=\"DDay\">{{cite web |last=Moore |first=Charles |title=Battleship Texas (BB-35) |url=http://users3.ev1.net/~cfmoore/history/1944normandy.html |publisher=Charles Moore |accessdate=2006-12-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923092736/http://users3.ev1.net/~cfmoore/history/1944normandy.html |archivedate=23 September 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe [[List of ships in Omaha Bombardment Group|Omaha Beach bombardment force]] consisted of two sections with ''Texas'' and the British light cruiser {{HMS|Glasgow|C21|6}} responsible for the western half with ''Arkansas'', and the French light cruisers {{Ship|French cruiser|Georges Leygues||2}} and {{Ship|French cruiser|Montcalm|1935|2}} responsible for the east.

At 06:26, ''Texas'' shifted her main battery gunfire to the western edge of Omaha Beach, around the town of [[Vierville, Manche|Vierville]]. Meanwhile, her secondary battery went to work on another target on the western end of \"Omaha\" beach, a ravine laced with strong points to defend an exit road. Later, under control of airborne spotters, she moved her major-caliber fire inland to interdict enemy reinforcement activities and to destroy batteries and other strong points farther inland.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nBy noon, the assault on Omaha Beach was in danger of collapsing due to stronger than anticipated German resistance and the inability of the Allies to get needed [[Tank|armor]] and [[artillery]] units on the beach.

Again, an independent maritime engineering firm was contracted to study the full range of dry berth alternatives and to present a report of their findings to BTF and to TPWD.<ref name=\"Dry-Berth Project Rationale\" />\n\nTPWD, acting on the report of the ship's condition, and on the report of the engineering viable dry berth alternatives, and on their internal studies and reports, prepared a progress report which they presented to the Legislative Budget Board (LBB) in late July 2008.<ref name=\"Dry-Berth Project Rationale\" />\n\nIn March 2009 the LBB released the funds for the dry berthing project to commence.<ref>{{cite press release \n|url=http://www.house.state.tx.us/news/press-releases/print/?id=2611 \n|title=Rep.

She was launched on 18 May 1912 and commissioned on 12 March 1914.{{sfn|Friedman|1986|p=420}}{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|p=115}}\n\nSoon after her commissioning, ''Texas'' saw action in Mexican waters following the \"[[Tampico Affair|Tampico Incident]]\" and made numerous sorties into the North Sea during [[World War I]]. When the United States formally entered [[World War II]] in 1941, ''Texas'' [[Battle of the Atlantic|escorted war convoys]] across the Atlantic and later shelled [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]]-held beaches for the [[North African campaign]] and the [[Operation Overlord|Normandy Landings]] before being transferred to the [[Pacific Theatre of World War II|Pacific Theater]] late in 1944 to provide [[naval gunfire support]] during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Battles of Iwo Jima]] and [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]]. ''Texas'' was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] in 1948, having earned a total of five [[battle star]]s for service in World War II, and is now a [[museum ship]] near [[Houston]], Texas. In addition to her combat service, ''Texas'' also served as a technological testbed during her career, and in this capacity became the first US battleship to mount [[anti-aircraft]] guns, the first US ship to [[fire-control system|control gunfire with directors and range-keepers]] (analog forerunners of today's computers), the first US battleship to launch an aircraft,<ref name=\"HNSVG\"/> from a platform on Turret 2,<ref name=\"DANFS\"/> and was one of the first to receive the CXAM-1 version of [[CXAM radar|CXAM]] production [[radar]] in the US Navy,<ref group=\"A\">CXAM was the first nonexperimental, nonprototype radar system developed by the US Navy. It was produced in small numbers for the US Navy and installed aboard certain capital ships, including battleships, [[heavy cruiser]]s, and [[aircraft carrier]]s. An upgraded version (CXAM-1) was later installed aboard other US Navy vessels, including a few ships that carried the original version.</ref>\n\nAmong the world's remaining battleships, ''Texas'' is notable for being the first US battleship to become a permanent museum ship,<ref group=\"A\">The first steel battleship to become a permanent museum ship was ''Mikasa''; the first US battleship to become a museum ship was {{USS|Oregon|BB-3|2}}. However, ''Oregon'' was placed on loan to the state of Oregon, and at the outbreak of World War II, she was offered back into service and later sunk and scrapped. As a result, ''Texas'' is the first permanent US battleship museum ship.</ref><ref name=\"HNSVG\">{{cite web|title=USS ''Texas'' (BB-35)|url=http://www.hnsa.org/ships/texas.htm|work=Historic Naval Ships Visitors Guide|publisher= Historic Naval Ships Association |accessdate=2006-12-29|url-status=dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060905041123/http://www.hnsa.org/ships/texas.htm|archivedate=5 September 2006|df= }}</ref> the first battleship declared to be a US [[National Historic Landmark]],<ref group=\"A\">See [[List of U.S. National Historic Landmark ships, shipwrecks, and shipyards]] for documentation that ''Texas'' is the first declared National Historic Landmark.{{unreliable source?|date=September 2012}}</ref> and is the only remaining World War I\u2013era [[dreadnought]] battleship.

The problem was quickly resolved locally, but [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Henry T. Mayo]] sought further redress by demanding an official disavowal of the act by the [[Victoriano Huerta|Huerta]] regime and a [[21-gun salute]] to the [[American flag]].<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nPresident Wilson saw in the incident an opportunity to put pressure on a government he felt was undemocratic. On 20 April, Wilson placed the matter before the [[United States Congress]] and sent orders to Rear Admiral [[Frank Friday Fletcher]], commanding the naval force off the Mexican coast, instructing him to land a force at [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]] and to seize the customs house there in retaliation for what is now known as the \"[[Tampico Affair|Tampico Incident]]\".

After a five-day stop at [[Hampton Roads]] from 14 to 19 May, she joined Rear Admiral Fletcher's force off Veracruz on 26 May. She remained in Mexican waters for just over two months, supporting the American forces ashore. On 8 August, she left Veracruz and set a course for [[Nipe Bay]], [[Cuba]], and from there steamed to New York, where she entered the Navy Yard on 21 August.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\nThe battleship remained there until 6 September, when she returned to sea, joined the Atlantic Fleet, and settled into a schedule of normal fleet operations. In October, she returned to the Mexican coast. Later that month, ''Texas'' became station ship at [[Tuxpan, Veracruz|Tuxpan]], a duty that lasted until 4 November, when she steamed for [[Galveston, Texas]]. While at Galveston on 7 November, Texas Governor [[Oscar Branch Colquitt|Oscar Colquitt]] presented the ship's silver service to Captain Grant.

''Texas'' began her mission five days after her arrival at Scapa Flow, when she sortied with the entire fleet to reinforce the [[4th Battle Squadron]], then on duty in the North Sea. She returned to Scapa Flow the next day and remained until 8 March, when she put to sea on a convoy escort mission from which she returned on 13 March. ''Texas'' and her division mates entered the Firth of Forth on 12 April, but got underway again on the 17th to escort a convoy. The American battleships returned to base on 20 April.

Forward units caught sight of the retiring Germans on 25 April, but at such an extreme range, bringing the German fleet into engagement with the Grand Fleet was not possible. The Germans returned to their base that day, and the Grand Fleet, including ''Texas'', did likewise on the next.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\n''Texas'' and her division mates passed a relatively inactive May in the Firth of Forth. On 9 June, she got underway with the other warships of the 6th Battle Squadron and headed back to the anchorage at Scapa Flow, arriving there the following day. From 30 June to 2 July, ''Texas'' and her colleagues acted as escort for American minelayers adding to the [[North Sea Mine Barrage]]. After a two-day return to Scapa Flow, ''Texas'' put to sea with the Grand Fleet to conduct two days of tactical exercises and war games. At the conclusion of those drills on 8 July, the fleet entered the Firth of Forth. For the remainder of World War I, ''Texas'' and the other battleships of Division&nbsp;9 continued to operate with the Grand Fleet as the 6th Battle Squadron. With the German Fleet increasingly tied to its bases in the estuaries of the [[Jade (river)|Jade]] and the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] rivers, the American and British ships settled into a routine schedule of operations with little-to-no hint of combat operations. That state of affairs lasted until the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Armistice]] ended hostilities on 11 November 1918.

Later, as the United States moved toward more active support of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] cause, the warship began convoying ships carrying [[Lend-Lease]] materiel to the United Kingdom. In February 1941, the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|US 1st Marine Division]] was activated aboard ''Texas''. On 1 February, [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Ernest King|Ernest J.

After 10 days at Casco Bay, she returned to Argentia and remained there until late January 1942, when she got underway to escort a convoy to England. After delivering her charges, the battleship patrolled waters near [[Iceland]] until March when she returned home.<ref name=\"DANFS\" /> At various times in 1942, the secondary battery was reduced to six 5-inch guns and the light AA battery was increased, adding two extra 1.1-inch/75-caliber quad mounts (these would be replaced by 10 quad mount [[Bofors 40 mm gun|{{cvt|40|mm}} Bofors]] in June 1943) and adding fourteen [[20 mm Oerlikon|{{cvt|20|mm}} Oerlikon]] cannons (increased to 44 by 1944), the attack on Pearl Harbor having demonstrated the need for this.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=205}} For the next six months, she continued convoy-escort missions to various destinations. On one occasion, she escorted [[Guadalcanal]]-bound Marines as far as [[Panama]]; on another, the warship screened service troops to [[Freetown]], [[Sierra Leone]], on the west coast of Africa. More frequently, she made voyages to and from the United Kingdom escorting both cargo- and troop-carrying ships.<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\n====Operation Torch====\n{{main|Operation Torch}}\nOn 23 October 1942, ''Texas'' embarked upon her first major combat operation when she sortied with Task Group 34.8 (TG 34.8), the Northern Attack Group for [[Operation Torch]], the invasion of North Africa. The objective assigned to this group was [[Kenitra|Port Lyautey]] in [[French protectorate in Morocco|French Morocco]]. The warships arrived off the assault beaches near the village of [[Mehdya, Morocco|Mehedia]] early in the morning of 8 November and began preparations for the [[Battle of Port Lyautey|invasion]]. ''Texas'' transmitted [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lt. General]] [[Dwight D.

When the troops went ashore, ''Texas'' did not go into action immediately to support them. At that point in the war, the doctrine of amphibious warfare was still embryonic. Many Army officers did not recognize the value of prelanding bombardments. Instead, the Army insisted upon attempting a landing by surprise.

With New York as her home port, she made numerous transatlantic voyages to such places as [[Casablanca]] and [[Gibraltar]], as well as frequent visits to ports in the British Isles. That routine continued into 1944 but ended on 22 April of that year when, at the European end of one such mission, she remained at the [[River Clyde|Clyde estuary]] in Scotland and began training for the invasion of [[Normandy]].<ref name=\"DANFS\" />\n\n=====Rehearsal=====\n[[File:USS Texas-5.jpg|thumb|''Texas'' off [[Norfolk, Virginia]], 15 March 1943]]\n\nDuring the next twelve days, ''Texas'' carried out many 14-inch gun-firing exercises with British battleships {{HMS|Ramillies|07|6}} and {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}}. The firing was done in conjunction with [[Royal Air Force]] airplanes as spotters. On 29 April, ''Texas'', {{USS|Nevada|BB-36|2}}, and {{USS|Arkansas|BB-33|2}} relocated to [[Belfast Lough]], [[Northern Ireland]]. There, final preparations were made, including the removal of the airplane catapult and the ship's OS2U Kingfisher observation planes.

The survey revealed that the ship's watertight integrity was badly compromised, the hull was open to the sea in many places, and many compartments were full of standing rain water.

His [[Vincent van Gogh's death|death in 1890]] is generally accepted to have been a suicide. Many competing hypotheses have been advanced as to  possible medical conditions from which he may have suffered.

The symptoms include: poor digestion and a bad stomach, hallucinations, nightmares, manic episodes, depressive episodes, stupor, absent mindedness, impotence, insomnia, and anxiety.\n\nVan Gogh suffered from some sort of [[seizures]] or crises, and in one of these attacks, on December 23, 1888, he cut off a part, or possibly all, of his ear.<ref>\"''It can be said that with the exception of the sister-in-law Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, who had family-related reasons for playing down the injury, not a single witness speaks of a severed earlobe. On the contrary, the mutually independent statements by the principal witness Paul Gauguin, the prostitute who was given the ear, the gendarme who was on duty in the red-light district, the investigating police officer and the local newspaper report, accord with the evidence that the artist\u2019s unfortunate \u201cself-mutilation\u201d involves the entire (left) ear. The existing handwritten and clearly worded medical reports by three different physicians, all of whom observed and treated Vincent van Gogh over an extended period of time in Arles as well as in Saint-R\u00e9my ought to provide ultimate proof of the fact that the artist was missing an entire ear and not just an earlobe.''\" Quoted from [http://wildegans.de/vangogh/english/index.html Van Gogh's Ear] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719113919/http://www.wildegans.de/vangogh/english/index.html |date=2011-07-19 }} by the art historian Rita Wildegans.</ref><ref>[http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/19/583b.htm?qp=psychology.depression letter to Paul Signac, underlining symptoms of depression 1889] Retrieved June 25, 2010</ref> Following that attack, he was admitted to hospital in [[Arles]], where his condition was diagnosed as \"acute mania with generalised delirium\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Concordance, lists, bibliography: Documentation|url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/documentation.html#id8May1889|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=[[Van Gogh Museum]]|accessdate=16 February 2012}}</ref> [[Portraits by Vincent van Gogh#Doctor Rey|Dr. F\u00e9lix Rey]], a young intern at the hospital, also suggested there might be \"a kind of epilepsy\" involved that he characterised as ''mental'' epilepsy.{{sfn|Naifeh|Smith|2011|pp=701 ''ff.'', 729, 749}} These attacks became more frequent by 1890, the longest and most severe lasting some nine weeks from February to April 1890.

This mental illness builds up on itself and will grow stronger if not treated.<ref name=pmid11925286>{{cite journal |last1=Blumer |first1=Dietrich |title=The Illness of Vincent van Gogh |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |date=April 2002 |volume=159 |issue=4 |pages=519\u2013526 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.159.4.519 |pmid=11925286 }}</ref>  Bipolar disorder is characterized by manic and depressive episodes; manic episodes feature reckless behavior, euphoria, and impulsiveness.

After having worked at his uncle\u2019s art dealership in the Netherlands, he transferred to another dealership location in London, where he fell in love with his landlord\u2019s daughter, Eugenie Loyer. After she refused his marriage proposal, he suffered his first mental breakdown, which caused him to change his entire life in order to devote it to God.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |title=Vincent van Gogh |url=https://www.biography.com/artist/vincent-van-gogh |website=Biography }}</ref> This setback at age 20 certainly marked a first step in the downwards spiral representing his health, which would lead to his suicide in 1890. One author points out that \u201cThere was a family history of mental illness\u201d,<ref name=pmid15370335/> and van Gogh displayed symptoms of bipolar disorder, which is widely considered to be genetically inherited{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}. Now an official devotee to the Church of Christ, van Gogh aspired to become a priest. His disarranged life style, however, caused him nothing but disrespect and rejection, such as the rejection from several theology schools throughout Europe around 1878. Reports of his reckless and indecisive yet impulsive behavior all point towards bipolar disorder. Things like pursuing the work of an art salesman only to tell the customers \u201cnot to buy this worthless art\u201d can be very well explained by the illness. Notions of indecisiveness and identity problems can be seen in the next years. Van Gogh moved a lot due to sexual rejection in the next 10 years. He moved to Brussels in 1880 to become an artist. He moved to The Hague because his cousin, Kate, rejected him. He moved to Paris in 1886 because his companion, Clasina Maria Hoornik, recommenced prostitution and alcohol addiction. Van Gogh found shelter in his brother Theo\u2019s small apartment, showing up on his doorstep uninvited.  In Paris, it seemed that painting leveled and calmed his emotions.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nVan Gogh indulged to an abnormal degree in various activities which undermined his health, such as constant smoking, drinking alcohol and coffee to excess, and eating very poorly, even fasting at times.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vincent Van Gogh - Biography, Quotes & Paintings |url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/expressionism/Vincent-Van-Gogh.html |website=The Art History Archive }}</ref> The natural consequence of all this was malnutrition.

After having worked at his uncle\u2019s art dealership in the Netherlands, he transferred to another dealership location in London, where he fell in love with his landlord\u2019s daughter, Eugenie Loyer. After she refused his marriage proposal, he suffered his first mental breakdown, which caused him to change his entire life in order to devote it to God.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |title=Vincent van Gogh |url=https://www.biography.com/artist/vincent-van-gogh |website=Biography }}</ref> This setback at age 20 certainly marked a first step in the downwards spiral representing his health, which would lead to his suicide in 1890. One author points out that \u201cThere was a family history of mental illness\u201d,<ref name=pmid15370335/> and van Gogh displayed symptoms of bipolar disorder, which is widely considered to be genetically inherited{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}. Now an official devotee to the Church of Christ, van Gogh aspired to become a priest. His disarranged life style, however, caused him nothing but disrespect and rejection, such as the rejection from several theology schools throughout Europe around 1878. Reports of his reckless and indecisive yet impulsive behavior all point towards bipolar disorder. Things like pursuing the work of an art salesman only to tell the customers \u201cnot to buy this worthless art\u201d can be very well explained by the illness. Notions of indecisiveness and identity problems can be seen in the next years. Van Gogh moved a lot due to sexual rejection in the next 10 years. He moved to Brussels in 1880 to become an artist. He moved to The Hague because his cousin, Kate, rejected him. He moved to Paris in 1886 because his companion, Clasina Maria Hoornik, recommenced prostitution and alcohol addiction. Van Gogh found shelter in his brother Theo\u2019s small apartment, showing up on his doorstep uninvited.  In Paris, it seemed that painting leveled and calmed his emotions.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nVan Gogh indulged to an abnormal degree in various activities which undermined his health, such as constant smoking, drinking alcohol and coffee to excess, and eating very poorly, even fasting at times.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vincent Van Gogh - Biography, Quotes & Paintings |url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/expressionism/Vincent-Van-Gogh.html |website=The Art History Archive }}</ref> The natural consequence of all this was malnutrition.

In January 1890, after another one of Vincent's seizures, Theo wrote to him saying \"if you know that it is dangerous for you to have colours near you, why don't you clear them away for a time, and make drawings?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/T23.htm|title=Theo van Gogh to Vincent van Gogh : 3 January 1890|website=webexhibits.org}}</ref> Theo's alarm is somewhat reduced after hearing from Vincent, and five days later he explained:\n\n{{quote|In [Doctor Peyron's] first letter he gave me to understand that it was dangerous for you to go on painting, as the colours were poison to you, but he went a little too far, which might have been due to his having relied on unverified rumours, as he himself was ill at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/T24.htm|title=Theo van Gogh to Vincent van Gogh : 8 January 1890|website=webexhibits.org}}</ref>}}\n\n==Diagnoses==\n\n===Epilepsy===\n\nEpilepsy has been a popular diagnosis.

Everyone was supposed to receive the same public services (schools, hospitals, prisons, etc.), but with separate facilities for each race. In practice, the services and facilities reserved for African-Americans were almost always of lower quality than those reserved for whites, if they existed at all; for example, most [[African-American schools]] received less public funding per student than nearby white schools. Segregation was never mandated by law in the Northern states, but a ''de facto'' system grew for schools, in which nearly all black students attended schools that were nearly all-black. In the South, white schools had only white pupils and teachers, while black schools had only black teachers and black students.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.aft.org/periodical/american-educator/summer-2004/jim-crows-schools|title=Jim Crow's Schools|date=2014-08-08|work=American Federation of Teachers|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSome [[streetcar]] companies did not segregate voluntarily.

Exposure is the likelihood that a minority and a majority party will come in contact with one another. Clustering is the gathering of different minority groups into a single space; clustering often leads to one big [[ghetto]] and the formation of hyperghettoization. Centralization measures the tendency of members of a minority group to be located in the middle of an urban area, often computed as a percentage of a minority group living in the middle of a city (as opposed to the outlying areas). Concentration is the dimension that relates to the actual amount of land a minority lives on within its particular city. The higher segregation is within that particular area, the smaller the amount of land a minority group will control.\n\nThe pattern of hypersegregation began in the early 20th century. African-Americans who moved to large cities often moved into the inner-city in order to gain industrial jobs. The influx of new African-American residents caused many European American residents to move to the suburbs in a case of [[white flight]]. As industry began to move out of the inner-city, the African-American residents lost the stable jobs that had brought them to the area. Many were unable to leave the inner-city, however, and they became increasingly poor.<ref name=\"Hurst\">{{Cite book| author = Charles E.

The United States government began making low-interest mortgages available to families through the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veteran's Administration]]. Black families were legally entitled to these loans but were sometimes denied these loans because the planners behind this initiative labeled many black neighborhoods throughout the country as \"in decline\". The rules for loans did not say that \"black families cannot get loans\"; rather, they said people from \"areas in decline\" could not get loans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2016/06/02/banks-lending-minorities/|title=Here's Why Big Banks Are Lending to Fewer Blacks and Hispanics|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}</ref> While a case could be made that the wording did not appear to compel segregation, it tended to have that effect.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} In fact, this administration was formed as part of the [[New Deal]] to all Americans and mostly affected black residents of inner city areas; most black families did in fact live in the [[inner city]] areas of large cities and almost entirely occupied these areas after the end of World War II when whites began to move to new suburbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/poverty_prejudice/soc_sec/hgreat.htm|title=The Great Depression and the New Deal|website=web.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-05-29}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to encouraging white families to move to suburbs by providing them loans to do so, the government uprooted many established African American communities by building elevated highways through their neighborhoods. To build a highway, tens of thousands of single-family homes were destroyed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} Because these properties were summarily declared to be \"in decline,\" families were given pittances for their properties, and were forced into federal housing called \"the projects\".

Parks' civil disobedience had the effect of sparking the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]]. Parks' act of defiance became an important symbol of the modern [[Civil Rights Movement]] and Parks became an international icon of resistance to racial segregation. \n[[File:1943 Colored Waiting Room Sign.jpg|thumb|Sign for \"colored\" waiting room at a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus terminal in [[Rome, Georgia]], 1943.]]\n\nSegregation was also pervasive in housing. State constitutions (for example, that of [[California Constitution|California]]) had clauses giving local jurisdictions the right to regulate where members of certain races could live. In 1917, the Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Buchanan v. Warley]]'' declared municipal resident segregation [[Local ordinance|ordinances]] unconstitutional. In response, whites resorted to the [[restrictive covenant]], a formal deed restriction binding white property owners in a given neighborhood not to sell to blacks. Whites who broke these agreements could be sued by \"damaged\" neighbors.<ref>[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=443 The Great Migration, Period: 1920s] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121121733/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=443 |date=January 21, 2008 }}</ref> In the 1948 case of ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] finally ruled that such covenants were unenforceable in a court of law. However, residential segregation patterns had already become established in most American cities, and have often persisted up to the present (see [[white flight]] and [[Redlining]]).\n\nIn most cities, the only way blacks could relieve the pressure of crowding that resulted from increasing migration was to expand residential borders into surrounding previously white neighborhoods, a process that often resulted in harassment and attacks by white residents whose intolerant attitudes were intensified by fears that black neighbors would cause property values to decline. Moreover, the increased presence of African Americans in cities, North and South, as well as their competition with whites for housing, jobs, and political influence sparked a series of race riots. In 1898 white citizens of Wilmington, North Carolina, resenting African Americans' involvement in local government and incensed by an editorial in an African-American newspaper accusing white women of loose sexual behavior, rioted and killed dozens of blacks. In the fury's wake, white supremacists overthrew the city government, expelling black and white office holders, and instituted restrictions to prevent blacks from voting. In Atlanta in 1906, newspaper accounts alleging attacks by black men on white women provoked an outburst of shooting and killing that left twelve blacks dead and seventy injured. An influx of unskilled black strikebreakers into [[East St Louis, Illinois]], heightened racial tensions in 1917. Rumors that blacks were arming themselves for an attack on whites resulted in numerous attacks by white mobs on black neighborhoods. On July 1, blacks fired back at a car whose occupants they believed had shot into their homes and mistakenly killed two policemen riding in a car. The next day, a full scaled riot erupted which ended only after nine whites and thirty-nine blacks had been killed and over three hundred buildings were destroyed.\n\nWith the migration to the North of many black workers at the turn of the 20th century, and the friction that occurred between white and black workers during this time, segregation was and continues to be a phenomenon in northern cities as well as in the South. Whites generally allocate [[tenements]] as housing to the poorest blacks. It would be well to remember, though, that while racism had to be legislated out of the South, many in the North, including [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and others who ran the [[Underground Railroad]], were ideologically opposed to Southerners' treatment of blacks. By the same token, many white Southerners have a claim to closer relationships with blacks than wealthy northern whites, regardless of the latter's stated political persuasion.<ref>[http://www.skidmore.edu/~dkarp/Social%20Issues/E/history.html History of Residential Segregation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041114125050/http://www.skidmore.edu/~dkarp/Social%20Issues/E/history.html |date=November 14, 2004 }}</ref>\n\n[[Anti-miscegenation laws]] (also known as miscegenation laws) prohibited whites and non-whites from marrying each other.

As one of many examples of such state laws, [[Utah]]'s marriage law had an anti-[[miscegenation]] component that was passed in 1899 and repealed in 1963.

This phenomenon is due to [[white flight]] where whites actively leave neighborhoods often because of a black presence. There are more than just geographical consequences to this, as the money leaves and poverty grows, crime rates jump and businesses leave and follow the money. This creates a job shortage in segregated neighborhoods and perpetuates the economic inequality in the inner city. With the wealth and businesses gone from inner city areas, the tax base decreases, which hurts funding for education. Consequently, those that can afford to leave the area for better schools leave decreasing the tax base for educational funding even more.

In analyzing racial and class segregation, the book documents the migration of white Americans from urban centers to small-town, exurban, and rural communities. Throughout the 20th Century, racial discrimination was deliberate and intentional. Today, racial segregation and division result from policies and institutions that are no longer explicitly designed to discriminate. Yet the outcomes of those policies and beliefs have negative, racial impacts, namely with segregation.<ref>Benjamin, Rich.

This was challenged in [[Montgomery, Alabama]] by [[Rosa Parks]], who refused to give up her seat to a white passenger, and by [[Rev. Martin Luther King]], who organized the [[Montgomery bus boycott]] (1955\u20131956). A federal court suit in Alabama, ''[[Browder v. Gayle]]'' (1956), was successful at the district court level, which ruled Alabama's bus segregation laws illegal. It was upheld at the Supreme Court level.\n\nIn 1961 [[Congress of Racial Equality]] director [[James Farmer]], other CORE members and some [[Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee]] members traveled as a mixed race group, [[Freedom Riders]], on Greyhound buses from Washington, D.C., headed towards [[New Orleans]]. In several states the travelers were subject to violence. In [[Anniston, Alabama]] the [[Ku Klux Klan]] attacked the buses, setting one bus on fire. After U.S. attorney general [[Robert F. Kennedy]] resisted taking action and urged restraint by the riders, Kennedy relented. He urged the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] to issue an order directing that buses, trains, and their intermediate facilities, such as stations, restrooms and water fountains be desegregated.<ref>'Freedom Rides,' The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute (Stanford) https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/freedom-rides</ref><ref>'Freedom Riders end racial segregation in Southern U.S. public transit, 1961,' Global Nonviolent Action Database, 2009, 2011 https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/freedom-riders-end-racial-segregation-southern-us-public-transit-1961</ref>\n\n==Effects==\n===Education===\n[[File:Colored School, by J.

The radical left-wing web-magazine [[ZNet]] featured a series of 4 articles on \"The New American Apartheid\" in which it drew parallels between the treatment of blacks by the American justice system and apartheid:\n\n<blockquote>Modern prisoners occupy the lowest rungs on the social class ladder, and they always have. The modern prison system (along with local jails) is a collection of ghettos or poorhouses reserved primarily for the unskilled, the uneducated, and the powerless. In increasing numbers this system is being reserved for racial minorities, especially blacks, which is why we are calling it the New American Apartheid. This is the same segment of American society that has experienced some of the most drastic reductions in income and they have been targeted for their involvement in drugs and the subsequent violence that extends from the lack of legitimate means of goal attainment.<ref>Shelden, Randall G.\nand William B.

This serves the purpose of making students of color more comfortable and highlighting the challenges they face on historically white-dominated campuses, although it may impair the ability of such students to interact with people outside of their specific group.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://www.nas.org/reports/separate-but-equal-again\n | title =Separate but Equal, Again\n | last =Pierre\n | first =Dion\n | date =29 April 2019\n | website =National Association of Scholars\n | access-date =28 June 2019 }}</ref>\n\nDue to education being funded primarily through local and state revenue, the quality of education varies greatly depending on the geographical location of the school. In some areas, education is primarily funded through revenue from property taxes; therefore, there is a direct correlation in some areas between the price of homes and the amount of money allocated to educating the area's youth.<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\">Massey, Douglas S. 2004. \"The New Geography of Inequality in Urban America,\" in C. Michael Henry, ed. Race, Poverty, and Domestic Policy.

U.S. Census Bureau</ref> Therefore, in predominantly African-American areas, otherwise known as 'ghettos', the amount of money available for education is extremely low. This is referred to as \"funding segregation\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\"/> This questionable system of educational funding can be seen as one of the primary reasons contemporary racial segregation continues to prosper. Predominantly Caucasian areas with more money funneled into primary and secondary educational institutions, allow their students the resources to succeed academically and obtain post-secondary degrees. This practice continues to ethnically, socially and economically divide America.\n\nAlternative certificate programs were introduced in many inner-city schools and rural areas. These programs award a person a teaching license even though he/she has not completed a traditional teaching degree. This program came into effect in the 1980s throughout most states in response to the dwindling number of people seeking to earn a secondary degree in education.<ref>Feistritzer, Emily (February 1, 2006). \"Alternative Teacher Certification\". National Center for Alternative Certification</ref> This program has been very controversial. It is, \"booming despite little more than anecdotal evidence of their success.[\u2026] there are concerns about how they will perform as teachers, especially since they are more likely to end up in poor districts teaching students in challenging situations.\"<ref>{{cite news |author1=Morgan Smith  |author2=Nick Pandolfo  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=For-Profit Certification for Teachers is Booming |newspaper= The New York Times |date=November 26, 2011 |accessdate= November 4, 2012 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/us/for-profit-certification-for-teachers-in-texas-is-booming.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0}}</ref> Alternative Certificate graduates tend to teach African-Americans and other ethnic minorities in inner-city schools and schools in impoverished small rural towns. Therefore, impoverished minorities not only have to cope with having the smallest amount of resources for their educational facilities but also with having the least trained teachers in the nation. Valorie Delp, a mother residing in an inner-city area whose child attends a school taught by teachers awarded by an alternative certificate program notes:\n\n<blockquote>One teacher we know who is in this program said he had visions of coming in to \"save\" the kids and the school and he really believes that this idea was kind of stoked in his program. No one ever says that you may have kids who threaten to stab you, or call you unspeakable names to your face, or can't read despite being in 7th grade.<ref>{{cite web|author=Valorie Delp |title=My Inner City Story: Why Alternative Certification Programs Don't Work, Parenting Education |accessdate= November 4, 2012 |url= http://education.families.com/blog/my-inner-city-story-how-alternative-teacher-certification-programs-do-a-disservice-to-the-inner-city}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDelp showcases that, while many graduates of these certificate programs have honorable intentions and are educated, intelligent people, there is a reason why teachers have traditionally had to take a significant amount of training before officially being certified as a teacher. The experience they gain through their practicum and extensive classroom experience equips them with the tools necessary to educate today's youth.\n\nSome measures have been taken to try give less affluent families the ability to educate their children. President [[Ronald Reagan]] introduced the McKinney\u2013Vento Homeless Assistance Act on July 22, 1987.<ref>Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, \"McKinney-Vento Education for Homeless Children and Youths Program: Notice of school enrollment guidelines\"</ref> This Act was meant to allow children the ability to succeed if their families did not have a permanent residence. Leo Stagman, a single, African-American parent, located in Berkeley, California, whose daughter had received a great deal of aid from the Act wrote on October 20, 2012 that, \"During her education, she [Leo's daughter] was eligible for the free lunch program and received assistance under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Educational Act.

One of these Acts includes the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB).

This Act therefore, has done little to close the educational gap between Caucasian and minority children.<ref>\"Charting the Course: States Decide Major Provisions Under No Child Left Behind.\" U.S. Department of Education.</ref>\n\nThere has also been an issue with minority populations becoming educated because to a fear of being accused of \"Acting White\". It is a hard definition to pin down, however, this is a negative term predominantly used by African-Americans that showing interest in one's studies is a betrayal of the African-American culture as one is trying to be a part of white society rather than staying true to his/her roots. Roland G.

Poorer inner-cities often lack the health care that is available in outside areas. That many inner-cities are so isolated from other parts of society also is a large contributor to the poor health often found in inner-city residents. The overcrowded living conditions in the inner-city caused by hypersegregation means that the spread of infectious diseases, such as [[tuberculosis]], occurs much more frequently.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Acevedo-Garcia |first=Dolores |title=Residential Segregation and the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases |journal=Social Science & Medicine |volume=51 |issue=8 |year=2000 |pages=1143\u20131161 |doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00016-2 |pmid=11037206 }}</ref> This is known as \"epidemic injustice\" because racial groups confined in a certain area are affected much more often than those living outside the area.\n\nPoor inner-city residents also must contend with other factors that negatively affect health. Research has proven that in every major American city, hypersegregated blacks are far more likely to be exposed to dangerous levels of air toxins.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lopez |first=R. |title=Segregation and Black/White Differences in Exposure to Air Toxics in 1990 |journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]] |volume=110 |issue=Suppl. 2 |year=2002 |pages=289\u2013295 |doi= 10.1289/ehp.02110s2289 |pmid=11929740 |pmc=1241175 |jstor=3455065 }}</ref> Daily exposure to this polluted air means that African-Americans living in these areas are at greater risk of disease.\n\n===Crime===\nOne area where hypersegregation seems to have the greatest effect is in violence experienced by residents.

Everyone was supposed to receive the same public services (schools, hospitals, prisons, etc.), but with separate facilities for each race. In practice, the services and facilities reserved for African-Americans were almost always of lower quality than those reserved for whites, if they existed at all; for example, most [[African-American schools]] received less public funding per student than nearby white schools. Segregation was never mandated by law in the Northern states, but a ''de facto'' system grew for schools, in which nearly all black students attended schools that were nearly all-black.

Exposure is the likelihood that a minority and a majority party will come in contact with one another. Clustering is the gathering of different minority groups into a single space; clustering often leads to one big [[ghetto]] and the formation of hyperghettoization. Centralization measures the tendency of members of a minority group to be located in the middle of an urban area, often computed as a percentage of a minority group living in the middle of a city (as opposed to the outlying areas). Concentration is the dimension that relates to the actual amount of land a minority lives on within its particular city. The higher segregation is within that particular area, the smaller the amount of land a minority group will control.\n\nThe pattern of hypersegregation began in the early 20th century. African-Americans who moved to large cities often moved into the inner-city in order to gain industrial jobs. The influx of new African-American residents caused many European American residents to move to the suburbs in a case of [[white flight]]. As industry began to move out of the inner-city, the African-American residents lost the stable jobs that had brought them to the area. Many were unable to leave the inner-city, however, and they became increasingly poor.<ref name=\"Hurst\">{{Cite book| author = Charles E.

The United States government began making low-interest mortgages available to families through the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veteran's Administration]]. Black families were legally entitled to these loans but were sometimes denied these loans because the planners behind this initiative labeled many black neighborhoods throughout the country as \"in decline\". The rules for loans did not say that \"black families cannot get loans\"; rather, they said people from \"areas in decline\" could not get loans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2016/06/02/banks-lending-minorities/|title=Here's Why Big Banks Are Lending to Fewer Blacks and Hispanics|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}</ref> While a case could be made that the wording did not appear to compel segregation, it tended to have that effect.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} In fact, this administration was formed as part of the [[New Deal]] to all Americans and mostly affected black residents of inner city areas; most black families did in fact live in the [[inner city]] areas of large cities and almost entirely occupied these areas after the end of World War II when whites began to move to new suburbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/poverty_prejudice/soc_sec/hgreat.htm|title=The Great Depression and the New Deal|website=web.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-05-29}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to encouraging white families to move to suburbs by providing them loans to do so, the government uprooted many established African American communities by building elevated highways through their neighborhoods.

Parks' civil disobedience had the effect of sparking the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]]. Parks' act of defiance became an important symbol of the modern [[Civil Rights Movement]] and Parks became an international icon of resistance to racial segregation. \n[[File:1943 Colored Waiting Room Sign.jpg|thumb|Sign for \"colored\" waiting room at a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus terminal in [[Rome, Georgia]], 1943.]]\n\nSegregation was also pervasive in housing. State constitutions (for example, that of [[California Constitution|California]]) had clauses giving local jurisdictions the right to regulate where members of certain races could live. In 1917, the Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Buchanan v. Warley]]'' declared municipal resident segregation [[Local ordinance|ordinances]] unconstitutional. In response, whites resorted to the [[restrictive covenant]], a formal deed restriction binding white property owners in a given neighborhood not to sell to blacks. Whites who broke these agreements could be sued by \"damaged\" neighbors.<ref>[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=443 The Great Migration, Period: 1920s] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121121733/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=443 |date=January 21, 2008 }}</ref> In the 1948 case of ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] finally ruled that such covenants were unenforceable in a court of law. However, residential segregation patterns had already become established in most American cities, and have often persisted up to the present (see [[white flight]] and [[Redlining]]).\n\nIn most cities, the only way blacks could relieve the pressure of crowding that resulted from increasing migration was to expand residential borders into surrounding previously white neighborhoods, a process that often resulted in harassment and attacks by white residents whose intolerant attitudes were intensified by fears that black neighbors would cause property values to decline. Moreover, the increased presence of African Americans in cities, North and South, as well as their competition with whites for housing, jobs, and political influence sparked a series of race riots. In 1898 white citizens of Wilmington, North Carolina, resenting African Americans' involvement in local government and incensed by an editorial in an African-American newspaper accusing white women of loose sexual behavior, rioted and killed dozens of blacks. In the fury's wake, white supremacists overthrew the city government, expelling black and white office holders, and instituted restrictions to prevent blacks from voting. In Atlanta in 1906, newspaper accounts alleging attacks by black men on white women provoked an outburst of shooting and killing that left twelve blacks dead and seventy injured. An influx of unskilled black strikebreakers into [[East St Louis, Illinois]], heightened racial tensions in 1917. Rumors that blacks were arming themselves for an attack on whites resulted in numerous attacks by white mobs on black neighborhoods. On July 1, blacks fired back at a car whose occupants they believed had shot into their homes and mistakenly killed two policemen riding in a car. The next day, a full scaled riot erupted which ended only after nine whites and thirty-nine blacks had been killed and over three hundred buildings were destroyed.\n\nWith the migration to the North of many black workers at the turn of the 20th century, and the friction that occurred between white and black workers during this time, segregation was and continues to be a phenomenon in northern cities as well as in the South. Whites generally allocate [[tenements]] as housing to the poorest blacks. It would be well to remember, though, that while racism had to be legislated out of the South, many in the North, including [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and others who ran the [[Underground Railroad]], were ideologically opposed to Southerners' treatment of blacks. By the same token, many white Southerners have a claim to closer relationships with blacks than wealthy northern whites, regardless of the latter's stated political persuasion.<ref>[http://www.skidmore.edu/~dkarp/Social%20Issues/E/history.html History of Residential Segregation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041114125050/http://www.skidmore.edu/~dkarp/Social%20Issues/E/history.html |date=November 14, 2004 }}</ref>\n\n[[Anti-miscegenation laws]] (also known as miscegenation laws) prohibited whites and non-whites from marrying each other.

As one of many examples of such state laws, [[Utah]]'s marriage law had an anti-[[miscegenation]] component that was passed in 1899 and repealed in 1963.

This phenomenon is due to [[white flight]] where whites actively leave neighborhoods often because of a black presence. There are more than just geographical consequences to this, as the money leaves and poverty grows, crime rates jump and businesses leave and follow the money. This creates a job shortage in segregated neighborhoods and perpetuates the economic inequality in the inner city. With the wealth and businesses gone from inner city areas, the tax base decreases, which hurts funding for education. Consequently, those that can afford to leave the area for better schools leave decreasing the tax base for educational funding even more. Any business that is left or would consider opening doesn't want to invest in a place nobody has any money but has a lot of crime, meaning the only things that are left in these communities are poor black people with little opportunity for employment or education.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Newman |first=Katherine |title=No Shame in My Game: The Working Poor in the Inner City |url=https://archive.org/details/noshameinmygamew00newm |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Knopf |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-375-40254-8 }}</ref>\n\nToday, a number of whites are willing, and are able, to pay a premium to live in a predominantly white neighborhood.

In analyzing racial and class segregation, the book documents the migration of white Americans from urban centers to small-town, exurban, and rural communities. Throughout the 20th Century, racial discrimination was deliberate and intentional. Today, racial segregation and division result from policies and institutions that are no longer explicitly designed to discriminate. Yet the outcomes of those policies and beliefs have negative, racial impacts, namely with segregation.<ref>Benjamin, Rich.

This was challenged in [[Montgomery, Alabama]] by [[Rosa Parks]], who refused to give up her seat to a white passenger, and by [[Rev. Martin Luther King]], who organized the [[Montgomery bus boycott]] (1955\u20131956). A federal court suit in Alabama, ''[[Browder v.

It was upheld at the Supreme Court level.\n\nIn 1961 [[Congress of Racial Equality]] director [[James Farmer]], other CORE members and some [[Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee]] members traveled as a mixed race group, [[Freedom Riders]], on Greyhound buses from Washington, D.C., headed towards [[New Orleans]]. In several states the travelers were subject to violence. In [[Anniston, Alabama]] the [[Ku Klux Klan]] attacked the buses, setting one bus on fire. After U.S. attorney general [[Robert F. Kennedy]] resisted taking action and urged restraint by the riders, Kennedy relented. He urged the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] to issue an order directing that buses, trains, and their intermediate facilities, such as stations, restrooms and water fountains be desegregated.<ref>'Freedom Rides,' The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute (Stanford) https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/freedom-rides</ref><ref>'Freedom Riders end racial segregation in Southern U.S. public transit, 1961,' Global Nonviolent Action Database, 2009, 2011 https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/freedom-riders-end-racial-segregation-southern-us-public-transit-1961</ref>\n\n==Effects==\n===Education===\n[[File:Colored School, by J.

The radical left-wing web-magazine [[ZNet]] featured a series of 4 articles on \"The New American Apartheid\" in which it drew parallels between the treatment of blacks by the American justice system and apartheid:\n\n<blockquote>Modern prisoners occupy the lowest rungs on the social class ladder, and they always have. The modern prison system (along with local jails) is a collection of ghettos or poorhouses reserved primarily for the unskilled, the uneducated, and the powerless. In increasing numbers this system is being reserved for racial minorities, especially blacks, which is why we are calling it the New American Apartheid. This is the same segment of American society that has experienced some of the most drastic reductions in income and they have been targeted for their involvement in drugs and the subsequent violence that extends from the lack of legitimate means of goal attainment.<ref>Shelden, Randall G.\nand William B.

This serves the purpose of making students of color more comfortable and highlighting the challenges they face on historically white-dominated campuses, although it may impair the ability of such students to interact with people outside of their specific group.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://www.nas.org/reports/separate-but-equal-again\n | title =Separate but Equal, Again\n | last =Pierre\n | first =Dion\n | date =29 April 2019\n | website =National Association of Scholars\n | access-date =28 June 2019 }}</ref>\n\nDue to education being funded primarily through local and state revenue, the quality of education varies greatly depending on the geographical location of the school. In some areas, education is primarily funded through revenue from property taxes; therefore, there is a direct correlation in some areas between the price of homes and the amount of money allocated to educating the area's youth.<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\">Massey, Douglas S. 2004. \"The New Geography of Inequality in Urban America,\" in C. Michael Henry, ed. Race, Poverty, and Domestic Policy.

This is referred to as \"funding segregation\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\"/> This questionable system of educational funding can be seen as one of the primary reasons contemporary racial segregation continues to prosper. Predominantly Caucasian areas with more money funneled into primary and secondary educational institutions, allow their students the resources to succeed academically and obtain post-secondary degrees. This practice continues to ethnically, socially and economically divide America.\n\nAlternative certificate programs were introduced in many inner-city schools and rural areas. These programs award a person a teaching license even though he/she has not completed a traditional teaching degree.

National Center for Alternative Certification</ref> This program has been very controversial. It is, \"booming despite little more than anecdotal evidence of their success.[\u2026] there are concerns about how they will perform as teachers, especially since they are more likely to end up in poor districts teaching students in challenging situations.\"<ref>{{cite news |author1=Morgan Smith  |author2=Nick Pandolfo  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=For-Profit Certification for Teachers is Booming |newspaper= The New York Times |date=November 26, 2011 |accessdate= November 4, 2012 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/us/for-profit-certification-for-teachers-in-texas-is-booming.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0}}</ref> Alternative Certificate graduates tend to teach African-Americans and other ethnic minorities in inner-city schools and schools in impoverished small rural towns. Therefore, impoverished minorities not only have to cope with having the smallest amount of resources for their educational facilities but also with having the least trained teachers in the nation. Valorie Delp, a mother residing in an inner-city area whose child attends a school taught by teachers awarded by an alternative certificate program notes:\n\n<blockquote>One teacher we know who is in this program said he had visions of coming in to \"save\" the kids and the school and he really believes that this idea was kind of stoked in his program. No one ever says that you may have kids who threaten to stab you, or call you unspeakable names to your face, or can't read despite being in 7th grade.<ref>{{cite web|author=Valorie Delp |title=My Inner City Story: Why Alternative Certification Programs Don't Work, Parenting Education |accessdate= November 4, 2012 |url= http://education.families.com/blog/my-inner-city-story-how-alternative-teacher-certification-programs-do-a-disservice-to-the-inner-city}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDelp showcases that, while many graduates of these certificate programs have honorable intentions and are educated, intelligent people, there is a reason why teachers have traditionally had to take a significant amount of training before officially being certified as a teacher. The experience they gain through their practicum and extensive classroom experience equips them with the tools necessary to educate today's youth.\n\nSome measures have been taken to try give less affluent families the ability to educate their children. President [[Ronald Reagan]] introduced the McKinney\u2013Vento Homeless Assistance Act on July 22, 1987.<ref>Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, \"McKinney-Vento Education for Homeless Children and Youths Program: Notice of school enrollment guidelines\"</ref> This Act was meant to allow children the ability to succeed if their families did not have a permanent residence. Leo Stagman, a single, African-American parent, located in Berkeley, California, whose daughter had received a great deal of aid from the Act wrote on October 20, 2012 that, \"During her education, she [Leo's daughter] was eligible for the free lunch program and received assistance under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Educational Act.

This Act therefore, has done little to close the educational gap between Caucasian and minority children.<ref>\"Charting the Course: States Decide Major Provisions Under No Child Left Behind.\" U.S. Department of Education.</ref>\n\nThere has also been an issue with minority populations becoming educated because to a fear of being accused of \"Acting White\". It is a hard definition to pin down, however, this is a negative term predominantly used by African-Americans that showing interest in one's studies is a betrayal of the African-American culture as one is trying to be a part of white society rather than staying true to his/her roots. Roland G.

In New York City, 19 out of 32 school districts have fewer white students.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/26/new-york-schools-segregated_n_5034455.html|title=The Nation's Most Segregated Schools Aren't Where You'd Think They'd Be|last=Resmovits|first=Joy|date=2014-03-26|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en-US}}</ref> The United States Supreme Court tried to deal with school segregation more than six decades ago but impoverished and colored students still do not have equal access to opportunities in education.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/history-brown-v-board-education-re-enactment|title=History \u2013 Brown v.

Poorer inner-cities often lack the health care that is available in outside areas. That many inner-cities are so isolated from other parts of society also is a large contributor to the poor health often found in inner-city residents. The overcrowded living conditions in the inner-city caused by hypersegregation means that the spread of infectious diseases, such as [[tuberculosis]], occurs much more frequently.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Acevedo-Garcia |first=Dolores |title=Residential Segregation and the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases |journal=Social Science & Medicine |volume=51 |issue=8 |year=2000 |pages=1143\u20131161 |doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00016-2 |pmid=11037206 }}</ref> This is known as \"epidemic injustice\" because racial groups confined in a certain area are affected much more often than those living outside the area.\n\nPoor inner-city residents also must contend with other factors that negatively affect health. Research has proven that in every major American city, hypersegregated blacks are far more likely to be exposed to dangerous levels of air toxins.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lopez |first=R. |title=Segregation and Black/White Differences in Exposure to Air Toxics in 1990 |journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]] |volume=110 |issue=Suppl. 2 |year=2002 |pages=289\u2013295 |doi= 10.1289/ehp.02110s2289 |pmid=11929740 |pmc=1241175 |jstor=3455065 }}</ref> Daily exposure to this polluted air means that African-Americans living in these areas are at greater risk of disease.\n\n===Crime===\nOne area where hypersegregation seems to have the greatest effect is in violence experienced by residents. The number of violent crimes in the U.S. in general has fallen. The number of murders in the U.S. fell 9% from the 1980s to the 1990s.<ref name=\"Getting Away with Murder\">{{Cite journal| author = Douglas S.

As of 1993, young African-American men are eleven times more likely to be shot to death and nine times more likely to be murdered than their European American peers.<ref name=\"American Apartheid\"/> Poverty, high unemployment, and broken families, all factors more prevalent in hypersegregated inner-cities, all contribute significantly to the unequal levels of violence experienced by African-Americans. Research has proven that the more segregated the surrounding European American suburban ring is, the rate of violent crime in the inner-city will rise, but, likewise, crime in the outer area will drop.<ref name=\"Getting Away with Murder\"/>\n\n===Poverty===\nOne study finds that an area's residential racial segregation increases metropolitan rates of black poverty and overall black-white [[income inequality in the United States|income disparities]], while decreasing rates of white poverty and [[racial inequality in the United States|inequality]] within the white population.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Wrong Side(s) of the Tracks: The Causal Effects of Racial Segregation on Urban Poverty and Inequality|journal = American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|date = 2011-04-01|issn = 1945-7782|pages = 34\u201366|volume = 3|issue = 2|doi = 10.1257/app.3.2.34|first = Elizabeth Oltmans|last = Ananat|citeseerx = 10.1.1.637.8290}}</ref>\n\n===Single parenthood===\nOne study finds that African-Americans who live in segregated metro areas have a higher likelihood of single-parenthood than Blacks who live in more integrated places.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Are Ghettos Good or Bad?|url = http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/112/3/827|journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics|date = 1997-08-01|issn = 0033-5533|pages = 827\u2013872|volume = 112|issue = 3|doi = 10.1162/003355397555361|first = David M.|last = Cutler|first2 = Edward L.|last2 = Glaeser}}</ref>\n\n===Public spending===\nResearch shows that segregation along racial lines contributes to public goods inequalities. Whites and blacks are vastly more likely to support different candidates for mayor than whites and blacks in more integrated places, which makes them less able to build consensus. The lack of consensus leads to lower levels of public spending.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Segregation and Inequality in Public Goods|journal = American Journal of Political Science|volume = 60|issue = 3|date = 2015-10-01|issn = 1540-5907|pages = 709\u2013725|doi = 10.1111/ajps.12227|first = Jessica|last = Trounstine|url = https://zenodo.org/record/894792}}</ref>\n\n=== Costs ===\nIn April 2017, the Metropolitan Planning Council in Chicago and the Urban Institute, a think-tank located in Washington, DC, released a study estimating that racial and economic segregation is costing the United States billions of dollars every year.

An example of a real Pilot Brevet (ie. certificate) is as opposite:<onlyinclude>[[Image:Brevet de pilote a\u00e9ronaute 1904.jpg|thumb|right|Balloon pilot's licence certificate (or \"Brevet\") issued by the A\u00e9ro-Club de France to Mr. Tissandier in 1904.]]\n\n==United Kingdom==\n\n<section begin=content/>\n\n===Royal Air Force===\n[[File:RAF pilot brevet (Queen's Crown).jpg|thumb|right|Royal Air Force pilot flying badge]]\nIn the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], the Flying Badge (colloquially referred to as '''wings''' or a '''brevet'''), is awarded upon the completion of a significant stage of [[Military Flying Training System|flying training]]. Aircrew first undertake Elementary Flying Training, and are then streamed to either fast jet, helicopter, RPAS or multi-engine pipelines. The award of wings usually occurs upon completion of the secondary phase of training; for example, in the fast jet stream, wings are awarded upon completion of the Basic Fast Jet Course (BJFT), currently at [[RAF Linton-on-Ouse]]; for helicopter pilots, wings are awarded after they complete helicopter training at [[RAF Shawbury]] pre-OCU; for RPAS post-OCU and on the attainment of 'Limited Combat Ready' status, and for multi-engine aircrew, wings are awarded upon completion of their Multi-Engine Advanced Flying Training (MEAFT) training at [[RAF Cranwell]]. Aircrew, other than RPAS pilots, are therefore posted to their [[Operational Conversion Unit]]s having gained their wings, but they still have a good deal of training and type familiarisation to complete before they are considered operational or front-line aircrew.\n\n====Current Flying Badges/Brevets====\n*[[aviator|pilots]] wear the letters \"RAF\" in a brown laurel wreath, surmounted by a crown, with a [[swift]]'s wing on each side. \n*[[weapons Systems Officer|weapons systems officer]]s/operators (rear aircrew) wear the letters \"RAF\" in a brown laurel wreath, surmounted by a crown, with a single [[swift]]'s wing on one side. \n\nLegacy Rear Aircrew who qualified prior to April 2003, wear a single wing with no crown and a letter or letters (denoting speciality) in a brown laurel wreath, however, they may choose to wear the new WSO/WSOP brevet. Legacy brevets still in use in the RAF include: \n*\"N\" for Navigator\n*\"AE\" for Air Electronics Officer/Operator\n*\"LM\" for Air Loadmaster\n*\"E\" for Air Engineer\n*\"S\" for Air Signaller (Airborne Linguist)\n\nFor operational flying crew, who are not de facto Aircrew (also known as non-traditional aircrew) who come from ground trades/branches but are assigned to flying duties, they are awarded an airborne specialist brevet upon completion of a bespoke flying training course, which is a half wing, without crown and 2 letters in the centre. This includes:\n*\"FC\" (fighter controller) brevet \u2013 Air Battle Managers assigned to fly on Sentry AEW.1.\n*\"AT\" (airborne technician) brevet \u2013 Ground Engineers assigned to fly on Sentry AEW.1 and RC-135W Rivet Joint platforms as in-flight technicians. \n*\"IA\" (imagery analyst) brevet \u2013 Intelligence Analysts assigned to fly on Sentinel R.1 in an Airborne Imagery Analyst role . \n\nRAF Catering Stewards assigned to fly as cabin crew on Voyager KC.1, BAe 146 and HS 125 are awarded the \"CC\" (cabin crew) badge. This badge is worn on the right sleeve in the same location as the parachute qualification, has two upturned wings (similar to Royal Navy ratings' aircrewman badges) and has cream stitching for the wings, lettering and laurels. Legacy Cabin Crew who qualified with the former \"AS\" ([[air steward]]) badge are still entitled to wear it.\n\nParachute Jumping Instructors (PJIs) are honorary aircrew and wear an open parachute instead of a letter on a half wing.\n\n====Obsolete Flying Badges/Brevets====\nThere are also a number of obsolete rear aircrew brevets that are no longer in use such as:\n*\"AG\" for Air Gunner\n*\"B\" for Air Bomber\n*\"RO\" for Radio Observer  \n*\"M\" ([[Meteorology|meteorological observer]])\n*\"QM\" ([[Quartermaster|air quartermaster]])\n*[[Air observer|Observers]] wore a single wing attached directly to the letter \"O\", this was replaced by the Navigator's badge in 1942.\n*[[RPAS]] pilots initially had a separate flying badge, similar to traditional pilot wings excepting a light blue wreath, this was withdrawn on 1 April 2019.\n[[File:B half wing.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|An obselete [[bomb aimer]]'s flying badge.]]\n\n===Royal Navy===\n\nThe [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Fleet Air Arm]] has its own wings design, featuring albatross wings instead of the wings of a swift, as per the RAF design. The Fleet Air Arm wings badges feature albatross wings, a crown and anchor, reflecting the naval aspect of the flying undertaken. They are worn on the sleeve of naval aviators, above the rank \"rings\" as opposed to on the left breast of RAF uniforms. Unlike the RAF and the Army Air Corps, Naval aircrew are awarded their wings after OCU, whereupon they are posted to a frontline squadron, the majority of their flying training complete. Therefore, while a Navy and RAF aircrew might take a similar amount of time to reach an operational squadron, the Naval officer has to wait until he has completed his conversion training to receive his wings. \n\nNaval Observers are awarded their own aircrew brevet, consisting of shorter wings either side of a fouled anchor surmounted by a Crown, upon completion of their Observer training at [[750 Naval Air Squadron|750 NAS]] at [[RNAS Culdrose]]. Naval Aircrewmen are awarded a brevet similar in shape to the 'Cabin Crew' brevet of the RAF, with upturned wings and a similar Anchor, but with no crown, design to Observers.  These badges are also worn on the sleeve of the Number 1 dress uniform jacket, above any rank insignia.\n\n===British Army===\n[[File:Army_Air_Corps_brevet.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Army Air Corps Pilot Flying Badge]]\nThe [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] pilot wings are awarded upon completion of the basic helicopter course at [[RAF Shawbury]] and a subsequent Army course at [[AAC Middle Wallop|Middle Wallop Airfield]]. Aircrew are then dispatched to their OCU to receive type training on either the [[AgustaWestland Apache|Apache]] attack helicopter or the [[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat|Wildcat]] battlefield support helicopter. A small number of Army aircrew are streamed fixed wing to fly the Army's [[Britten-Norman Defender|Islander/Defender]] reconnaissance aircraft, or to become instructors at the Defence Elementary Flying School on the [[Grob G 115|Tutor]] training aircraft.\n\nThe Army is unique in the British military in that both [[Officer (armed forces)#United Kingdom|Officers]] and [[Non-commissioned officer#United Kingdom|Non-Commissioned Officers]] can become aircrew and aircraft commanders. The wings are identical for both Officers and Other Ranks, and are worn on the left chest above any medals, similar to the RAF.\n\nIn all the services, award of wings does not confer any operational capability \u2013 this is declared by a front-line squadron once the student has reached satisfactory standard to allow them to be deployed operationally. This milestone, or 'Combat Ready Status', is the threshold necessary for the award of Flying Pay, a discretionary additional salary bonus for aircrew due to the nature of their work.\n\n==Australia==\n[[File:Brevet1.jpg|thumb|right|Royal Australian Air Force loadmaster flying badge]]\n\n[[Royal Australian Air Force]] flying badges differ from those in the RAF mainly in having a crown on all Flying Badges (not just on pilot's wings) and in normally having blue wreaths. The pilot's flying badge has the letters \"RAAF\". A similar twin-wing badge, bearing the [[Southern Cross]], was introduced for officer aircrew in 1998, replacing various single-wing flying badges previously worn by [[commissioned officer]]s;<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4814/topstories/story04.htm |journal=Air Force News |title=Brevets signal start |volume=48 |number=14 |date=10 August 2006 |accessdate=7 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304200054/http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4814/topstories/story04.htm |archivedate=4 March 2016  }}</ref> however [[Non-Commissioned Officer|NCO]] aircrew continue to wear the old single-wing badges.\n\nSome RAAF pilots signed a petition in 1998/1999 in protest of non-pilot \"officer aircrew\" receiving a double wing. It was rumoured that some serving navigators and war veterans who had previously held the soon to be abolished 'half' wing agreed with the protest. The petition ultimately had over 10,000 signatures, but in the end the petition was unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idcardkits.com/history-id-badges |title=ID Badges Used in War History |work=idcardkits.com |year=2015 |accessdate=7 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305165719/http://www.idcardkits.com/history-id-badges |archivedate=5 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Army badges.jpg|right|thumb|Australian Army flying badges]]\n\n==New Zealand==\nNew Zealand uses similar insignia to the United Kingdom, except the pilot's wings bear the letters \"NZ\" instead of \"RAF\" and the single wing of other aircrew still have the letters of the trade they represent. Currently these are air warfare officer and air warfare specialist (both wear AW), air engineer (E), air loadmaster (LM), helicopter loadmaster (HL), flight steward (FS), air ordnanceman (AO), and parachute jump instructor (a parachute).

Aircrew, other than RPAS pilots, are therefore posted to their [[Operational Conversion Unit]]s having gained their wings, but they still have a good deal of training and type familiarisation to complete before they are considered operational or front-line aircrew.\n\n====Current Flying Badges/Brevets====\n*[[aviator|pilots]] wear the letters \"RAF\" in a brown laurel wreath, surmounted by a crown, with a [[swift]]'s wing on each side. \n*[[weapons Systems Officer|weapons systems officer]]s/operators (rear aircrew) wear the letters \"RAF\" in a brown laurel wreath, surmounted by a crown, with a single [[swift]]'s wing on one side. \n\nLegacy Rear Aircrew who qualified prior to April 2003, wear a single wing with no crown and a letter or letters (denoting speciality) in a brown laurel wreath, however, they may chose to wear the new WSO/WSOP brevet. Legacy brevets still in use in the RAF include: \n*\"N\" for Navigator\n*\"AE\" for Air Electronics Officer/Operator\n*\"LM\" for Air Loadmaster\n*\"E\" for Air Engineer\n*\"S\" for Air Signaller (Airborne Linguist)\n\nFor operational flying crew, who are not de facto Aircrew (also known as non-traditional aircrew) who come from ground trades/branches but are assigned to flying duties, they are awarded an airborne specialist brevet upon completion of a bespoke flying training course, which is a half wing, without crown and 2 letters in the centre. This includes:\n*\"FC\" (fighter controller) brevet \u2013 Air Battle Managers assigned to fly on Sentry AEW.1.\n*\"AT\" (airborne technician) brevet \u2013 Ground Engineers assigned to fly on Sentry AEW.1 and RC-135W Rivet Joint platforms as in-flight technicians. \n*\"IA\" (imagery analyst) brevet \u2013 Intelligence Analysts assigned to fly on Sentinel R.1 in an Airborne Imagery Analyst role . \n\nRAF Catering Stewards assigned to fly as cabin crew on Voyager KC.1, BAe 146 and HS 125 are awarded the \"CC\" (cabin crew) badge. This badge is worn on the right sleeve in the same location as the parachute qualification, has two upturned wings (similar to Royal Navy ratings' aircrewman badges) and has cream stitching for the wings, lettering and laurels. Legacy Cabin Crew who qualified with the former \"AS\" ([[air steward]]) badge are still entitled to wear it.\n\nParachute Jumping Instructors (PJIs) are honorary aircrew and wear an open parachute instead of a letter on a half wing.\n\n====Obsolete Flying Badges/Brevets====\nThere are also a number of obsolete rear aircrew brevets that are no longer in use such as:\n*\"AG\" for Air Gunner\n*\"B\" for Air Bomber\n*\"RO\" for Radio Observer  \n*\"M\" ([[Meteorology|meteorological observer]])\n*\"QM\" ([[Quartermaster|air quartermaster]])\n*[[Air observer|Observers]] wore a single wing attached directly to the letter \"O\", this was replaced by the Navigator's badge in 1942.\n*[[RPAS]] pilots initially had a separate flying badge, similar to traditional pilot wings excepting a light blue wreath, this was withdrawn on 1 April 2019.\n[[File:B half wing.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|An obselete [[bomb aimer]]'s flying badge.]]\n\n===Royal Navy===\n\nThe [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Fleet Air Arm]] has its own wings design, featuring albatross wings instead of the wings of a swift, as per the RAF design. The Fleet Air Arm wings badges feature albatross wings, a crown and anchor, reflecting the naval aspect of the flying undertaken. They are worn on the sleeve of naval aviators, above the rank \"rings\" as opposed to on the left breast of RAF uniforms. Unlike the RAF and the Army Air Corps, Naval aircrew are awarded their wings after OCU, whereupon they are posted to a frontline squadron, the majority of their flying training complete. Therefore, while a Navy and RAF aircrew might take a similar amount of time to reach an operational squadron, the Naval officer has to wait until he has completed his conversion training to receive his wings. \n\nNaval Observers are awarded their own aircrew brevet, consisting of shorter wings either side of a fouled anchor surmounted by a Crown, upon completion of their Observer training at [[750 Naval Air Squadron|750 NAS]] at [[RNAS Culdrose]]. Naval Aircrewmen are awarded a brevet similar in shape to the 'Cabin Crew' brevet of the RAF, with upturned wings and a similar Anchor, but with no crown, design to Observers.  These badges are also worn on the sleeve of the Number 1 dress uniform jacket, above any rank insignia.\n\n===British Army===\n[[File:Army_Air_Corps_brevet.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Army Air Corps Pilot Flying Badge]]\nThe [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] pilot wings are awarded upon completion of the basic helicopter course at [[RAF Shawbury]] and a subsequent Army course at [[AAC Middle Wallop|Middle Wallop Airfield]]. Aircrew are then dispatched to their OCU to receive type training on either the [[AgustaWestland Apache|Apache]] attack helicopter or the [[AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat|Wildcat]] battlefield support helicopter. A small number of Army aircrew are streamed fixed wing to fly the Army's [[Britten-Norman Defender|Islander/Defender]] reconnaissance aircraft, or to become instructors at the Defence Elementary Flying School on the [[Grob G 115|Tutor]] training aircraft.\n\nThe Army is unique in the British military in that both [[Officer (armed forces)#United Kingdom|Officers]] and [[Non-commissioned officer#United Kingdom|Non-Commissioned Officers]] can become aircrew and aircraft commanders. The wings are identical for both Officers and Other Ranks, and are worn on the left chest above any medals, similar to the RAF.\n\nIn all the services, award of wings does not confer any operational capability \u2013 this is declared by a front-line squadron once the student has reached satisfactory standard to allow them to be deployed operationally. This milestone, or 'Combat Ready Status', is the threshold necessary for the award of Flying Pay, a discretionary additional salary bonus for aircrew due to the nature of their work.\n\n==Australia==\n[[File:Brevet1.jpg|thumb|right|Royal Australian Air Force loadmaster flying badge]]\n\n[[Royal Australian Air Force]] flying badges differ from those in the RAF mainly in having a crown on all Flying Badges (not just on pilot's wings) and in normally having blue wreaths. The pilot's flying badge has the letters \"RAAF\". A similar twin-wing badge, bearing the [[Southern Cross]], was introduced for officer aircrew in 1998, replacing various single-wing flying badges previously worn by [[commissioned officer]]s;<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4814/topstories/story04.htm |journal=Air Force News |title=Brevets signal start |volume=48 |number=14 |date=10 August 2006 |accessdate=7 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304200054/http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4814/topstories/story04.htm |archivedate=4 March 2016  }}</ref> however [[Non-Commissioned Officer|NCO]] aircrew continue to wear the old single-wing badges.\n\nSome RAAF pilots signed a petition in 1998/1999 in protest of non-pilot \"officer aircrew\" receiving a double wing. It was rumoured that some serving navigators and war veterans who had previously held the soon to be abolished 'half' wing agreed with the protest. The petition ultimately had over 10,000 signatures, but in the end the petition was unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idcardkits.com/history-id-badges |title=ID Badges Used in War History |work=idcardkits.com |year=2015 |accessdate=7 December 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305165719/http://www.idcardkits.com/history-id-badges |archivedate=5 March 2016 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Army badges.jpg|right|thumb|Australian Army flying badges]]\n\n==New Zealand==\nNew Zealand uses similar insignia to the United Kingdom, except the pilot's wings bear the letters \"NZ\" instead of \"RAF\" and the single wing of other aircrew still have the letters of the trade they represent. Currently these are air warfare officer and air warfare specialist (both wear AW), air engineer (E), air loadmaster (LM), helicopter loadmaster (HL), flight steward (FS), air ordnanceman (AO), and parachute jump instructor (a parachute). Air electronics operator (AE) and Helicopter crewman (HC) are obsolete.\n\n<section end=content/> \n</onlyinclude>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aircrew badge]]\n*[[Aviator badge]]\n*[[Parachutist badge]]\n*[[Pilot licensing and certification]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |url= http://www.rafweb.org/Ranks-Uniform/Badges3.htm |title=RAF Flying Badges \u2013 Current |first=M.
