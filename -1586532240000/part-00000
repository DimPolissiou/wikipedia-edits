It was a monetary reward paid in accordance with the [[prize law]] of a belligerent state to the crew of a ship belonging to the state, either a warship of its navy or a [[privateer]] vessel commissioned by the state. Prize money was most frequently awarded for the capture of enemy ships or of cargoes belonging to an enemy in time of war, either arrested in port at the outbreak of war or captured during the war in international waters or other waters not the territorial waters of a neutral state. Goods carried in neutral ships that are classed as [[contraband]], being shipped to enemy-controlled territory and liable to be useful to it for making war, were also liable to be taken as prizes, but non-contraband goods belonging to neutrals were not. Claims for the award of prize money were usually heard in a [[Prize Court]], which had to adjudicate the claim and condemn the prize before any distribution of cash or goods could be made to the captors.\n\nOther cases in which prize money has been awarded include prize money for the capture of pirate ships, slave ships after the abolition of the slave trade and ships trading in breach of the [[Navigation Acts]], none of which require a state of war to exist. Similar monetary awards include ''Military Salvage'', the recapture of ships captured by an enemy before an enemy Prize Court has declared them to be valid prizes (after such ships have been condemned, they are treated as enemy ships), and payments termed ''Gun money'', ''Head Money'' or ''[[Bounty (reward)| Bounty]]'', distributed to men serving in a state warship that captured or destroyed of an armed enemy ship. The amount payable depended at first on the number of guns the enemy carried, but later on the complement of the defeated ship. \n\nCertain captures made by armies, called ''Booty of War'', are distinct from naval prize because, unlike awards under naval prize legislation, the award of booty is only made for a specific capture, often the storming of a city; the award does not set a precedent for other military captures in the same war, and does not require adjudication by a prize court. When the British army and navy acted together, it was normal for instructions to say how any prizes and booty should be shared, and the shares allocated. In this case, combined naval and military force to be dealt with under naval prize law rules.  \n\nAlthough prize law still exists, the payment of prize money to privateers ceased in practice during the second half of the 19th century and prize money for naval personnel was abolished by thise maritime states that had provided it at various times in the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. \n\n\n==Origins==\nThe two roots of prize law and the consequent distribution of prize money are the mediaeval maritime codes, such as the [[Book of the Consulate of the Sea| Consolato Del Mare]] and [[Rolls of Oleron]], which codified the customary laws that reserved legal rights over certain property found or captured at sea, in harbour or on the shore for the rulers of maritime states,<ref name = \"Wright 16\"> Wright 16</ref> and the 16th and 17th century formulation of international law by jurists such as [[Hugo Grotius]].<ref name = \"Wright 23\"> Wright 23</ref>. These jurists considered that only the state could authorise war, and that goods captured from an enemy in war belong as of right to its monarch. However, it was customary for the state to reward those who that assisted in making such captures by granting them part of the proceeds.<ref name = \"Wright 21-23\"> Wright 21-23</ref>\n\nIn various 17th century states, the crown retained from one-tenth to one-fifth of the value of ships and cargoes taken by privateers but up to half of the value of those captured by the state\u2019s navy. Grotius also recorded the practices that, for a prize to be effective, the ship must either be brought to port or retained for 24 hours, and that no distribution of prize money or goods could made without due court authorisation.<ref name = \"Wright 22, 24\"> Wright 22, 24</ref>  \n\nMost European maritime states, and other maritime states that adopted laws based on European models, had codes of prize law based on the above principles that allowed for monetary rewards for captures. However, details of prize money law and practice are known for relatively few of these. They include [[England|English]] rules from the 17th century, which formed the basis for the rules for [[Great Britain]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, those of [[France]] from the 17th to 20th centuries, the [[Dutch Republic]], mainly for the 17th century, and the [[United States]] for the 18th and 19th centuries.<ref name = \"Wright 27\"> Wright 27</ref> The smaller navies of maritime states such as Denmark and Sweden, had little chance of gaining prize money because they had few opportunities to capture enemy ships in wartime, both because, after the [[Great Northern War]], they were rarely involved in naval wars and, when they were, their fleets were much weaker than their major opponents.<ref name = \"Wilson, Hammar & Seerup 5, 163-164\"> Wilson, Hammar & Seerup 5, 163-164</ref>    \n\n===Booty of war===\nBooty of war, also termed ''spoils of war'' is the movable property of an enemy state or its subjects which can be used for warlike purposes, in particular its soldiers' arms and equipment, captured on land, as opposed to ''prize'' which is hostile property captured at sea. It is legally the property of the victorious state, but all or part of it (or its value) may be granted to the troops that capture it.<ref name = \"Phillimore, 214-215\"> Phillimore, 214-215</ref> In British practice, although the Crown may grant booty and to specify its distribution, this was done by a special proclamation relating to a specific capture which did not set a precedent, not a general measure dealing with all captures made during a war, as were naval Prize Acts.<ref name = \"Van Niekerk, 123\"> Van Niekerk, 123</ref> Instances of it being granted include the [[Siege of Seringapatam]], 1799, the capture of [[Bordeaux]], 1814 and the [[Siege of Delhi]], 1857.<ref name = \"Phillimore, 214-215\"> Phillimore, 214-215</ref>. Although the United States and France had allowed their soldiers to profit from booty on a basis similar to Britain, they abolished the practice in 1899 and 1901 respectively.<ref name = \"Phillimore, 227-229\"> Phillimore, 227-229</ref>. The [[Third Geneva Convention]] now only allows the arms, military equipment and military documents of prisoners of war to be seized and prohibits the award of booty.\n\n==England to 1707==\n[[The Crown]] of England had, from medieval times, legal rights over certain property found or captured at sea or found on the shore. These included the rights to [[shipwrecks]], ships found abandoned at the sea, [[Flotsam, jetsam, lagan and derelict]], enemy ships and goods found in English ports or captured at sea in wartime and goods taken from pirates. At first, these were collectively known as [[Droit| Droits]] of the Crown, but after the creation the office of the [[Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom| High Admiral, later the Lord High Admiral, of England]] in the early 15th century, they were known as Droits of Admiralty, as the Crown granted these rights, and legal jurisdiction the property specified in them, to the Lord Admiral. This jurisdiction ceased in 1702, but the name Droits of Admiralty remained in use.<ref name = \"Holdsworth 559-560\"> Holdsworth 559-560</ref> \n\nEarly Prize Law made little distinction between financial rewards made to officers and men of the Royal Navy and to privateers (civilians authorised to attack enemy shipping by [[Letters of marque]] issued by the Crown), as the former did not exist as a permanent force until the 16th century. Mediaeval rulers had no administrative mechanism to adjudicate prizes or collect the royal share. <ref name = \"Wright 31-33\"> Wright 31-33</ref> The first [[Admiralty Court]] in England with responsibility for prize and prize money issues was created in 1483 and subordinate Vice-Admiralty courts were later set up in British colonies. Appeal from the Court of Admiralty was to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom| Privy Council]]. As the rights over enemy ships or goods are legally prerogatives of the Crown, there are few English or British statues that deal with naval prize money, other than the Prize Acts issued at the start of each war, authorising the Crown to issue orders or proclamations dealing with prize money, and these acts affirm rather than limit the Crown\u2019s rights.<ref name = \"Marsden 91-92\"> Marsden (1915) 91-92</ref>  \n\nFrom Elizabethan times, the Crown insisted that the validity of prizes and their value had to be determined by royal courts, and that it should retain a portion of their value. In some cases, an English ship failing to bring a prize for adjudication was confiscated. Beyond this, it was left to the discretion of the Crown, guided by custom, as to what should be allocated to those taking prizes, and how that prize money should be allocated between the owners, the officers and the crew.<ref name = \"Wright 45-46\"> Wright 45-46</ref>.  Generally, the Crown retained one-tenth of the value of prizes captured by privateers. By ancient custom, the common seamen, but not the officers, of navy vessels had the right of \u2018\u2019free pillage\u2019\u2019, the seizure of the enemy crew\u2019s personal possessions and any goods not stored in the hold.<ref name = \"Marsden 695, 697\"> Marsden (1909) 695, 697</ref> The [[Commonwealth of England| Commonwealth]] attempted to forbid the custom of pillage in 1652, but this rule was impossible to enforce, and the right to pillage was given statutory force after [[The Restoration]].<ref name = \"Wright 51\"> Wright 51</ref>\n\nSome rewards that were previously customary or discretionary for privateers became entitlements 1643, when an ordinance passed by the Commonwealth parliament allowed them to retain any ships and goods captured after adjudication in an Admiralty Court and payment of one-tenth of the value of the prize and customs duties on any goods. A further ordinance of 1649 relating to naval ships, which applied during the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], entitled seamen and subordinate officers to half the value of a captured enemy warship and ''Gun money'' of between 10 and 20 [[Pound (currency)| pounds]] for every gun on an enemy warship that was sunk, and one third of the value of a captured enemy merchant ship. If a captured enemy warship were repairable at reasonable cost and suitable to add to the English fleet, the Crown might but bought it.<ref name = \"Marsden 37\"> Marsden (1911) 37</ref> However, until 1708, the purchase price was fixed by the Admiralty, whose agents were suspected of valuing them cheaply or inflating the cost of repairs.<ref name = \"Bromley 451\"> Bromley 451</ref> The 1643 ordinance also introduced two new measures: that part of the money not allocated to the ship\u2019s crew would go to the sick and wounded, and that English ships recaptured from an enemy were to be returned to their owner on payment of one-eighth of their value to the ship recapturing them. A further ordinance of 1650 applied these prize money rules to the capture of pirate ships.<ref name = \"Wright 50-51\"> Wright 50-51</ref> \n\nThe provisions of 1643, 1649 and 1650 on the distribution of prize money were repeated after [[The Restoration]] in an act of 1661, which also expressly allowed the custom of pillage, and allowed the Lord Admiral discretion over any money or goods not allocated to the crews. The right of disposing of captured prizes and pre-emption in acquiring their goods was also retained by the Lord Admiral.<ref name = \"Marsden 43-44\"> Marsden (1911) 43-44</ref> \n\n===[[Anglo-Dutch Wars]]===\nEven before the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] formally began, two steps were taken by the English government that that were liable to promote hostility between England and the Netherlands. Firstly, in 1663, the [[Navigation Acts| Navigation Act]], which aimed to restrict Dutch maritime trade, authorised the capture of English or foreign vessels trading in breach of that act as prizes, and allowed Vice-Admiralty Courts in the English colonies to adjudicate their value, and to award one-third of this value to the captor, one third to the colonial governor and one third to the Crown. These overseas Vice-Admiralty Courts were, from 1692, also able to deal with wartime prizes.<ref name = \"Marsden 43-44\"> Marsden (1911) 43-44</ref> Secondly, an [[Order in Council]] of 1644 increased the prize money due to the seamen of English ships that took prizes to 10 [[Shilling (British coin)| shillings]] for each [[ton]] comprised in their [[tonnage]], and gun money of at least 10 pounds a gun for any warship sunk or burned.<ref name = \"Fox 74\"> Fox 74</ref> \n\nAlthough neither [[Charles II of England| Charles II]] nor his brother James, Lord High Admiral since 1660, had been ungenerous to those Royal Navy captains and flag officers that captured enemy ships, giving them a fair allocation of the value of their prizes, the failure to set out a fixed scale of prize money for senior officers led to a scandal in 1665.<ref name = \"Fox 113\"> Fox 113</ref> [[Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich| The Earl of Sandwich]] commanded an English fleet that, between 3 September and 9 September, had captured thirteen [[Dutch East India Company]] merchant ships of the [[East Indies]] spice fleet, and had also captured or sunk several of their escorts. Concerned that Charles\u2019s difficult financial position might make him less generous that before, and considering the great value of the cargoes captured, Sandwich, urged on by one of his flag officers, [[Sir William Penn]], agreed that he and Penn should take goods to the value of 4,000 pounds, and that each other flag officer and the three captains that held knighthoods should take goods worth 2,000 pounds, from the captured cargoes: nothing was provided for the untitled captains.<ref name = \"Fox 113-114\"> Fox 113-114</ref> \n\nThis seizure of goods was represented by Sandwich and Penn as a payment on account of their expected prize money, although it was in clear breach of the instructions issued in 1665 at the outbreak of the war that required ships and goods to be declared as lawful prizes by an Admiralty court before any goods in its hold could be removed. Marsden, (1911), pp. 44-45. Three of those officers offered 2,000 pounds of goods refused to take them, and the untitled captains complained against the arrangement. In the course of the removal of goods from the Dutch ships\u2019 holds, many English sailors joined in the plundering, and a large quantity of spices and other valuable goods were stolen or spoilt. The Earl of Sandwich lost his command, and the government lost goods and money that could have been used to send the fleet back to sea.<ref name = \"Fox 115\"> Fox 115</ref>\n\nEnglish privateers were very prominent at sea during the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]], attacking the maritime trade and fisheries on which the United Provinces depended, capturing many Dutch merchant ships. <ref name = \"Fox 69-70\"> Fox 69-70</ref> \n\n===[[War of the Spanish Succession]]===\nThe situation of ships\u2019 captains was remedied by a Prize Act of 1692. This act distinguished between captures made by privateers and by royal ships. Privateers were entitled to retain any ships captured and four-fifths of the goods, surrendering one-fifth of those to the Crown, and it was left to them how they sold their prizes and distributed the proceeds. However, in the case of captures by royal ships, one-third of their value went to the officers and men of the captor, and one third to the king, from which he could reward flag officers. The final one-third was to benefit those sick and wounded, as before, and for the first time was also used to pay dependents of crew members killed and to fund [[Greenwich Hospital]].<ref name = \"Wright 53\"> Wright 53</ref>\n\nThe 1692 act also abolished the ancient right of pillage, standardised gun money at 10 pounds a gun and provided for [[salvage]] to be paid by the owners of English ships recaptured from the enemy. <ref name = \"Marsden 90\"> Marsden (1915) 90</ref> Until 1692, the allocation of the one-third of the value of prize money due to the officers and men lad been a matter of custom, but it was then fixed as one-third (or one-ninth of the total prize money) to the captain, one-third to other officers and one-third to the crew.<ref name =\" Ehrman 129-130\"> Ehrman 129-130</ref>\n\nDuring this war, in 1701, the [[Admiralty]] had established a board of Prize Commissioners, who appointed local prize agents at British and some colonial ports, and were responsible for the custody of ships captured both by privateers and royal ships until these captures were either condemned or released. Although privateers were free to dispose of prize ships and goods after they were condemned and any duties were paid, the Prize Commissioners were responsible for the sale of ships and cargoes captured by royal ships, the valuation of ships or goods acquired for Royal Navy use, and the calculation and payment of prize money. As many naval actions in this war took place in the Mediterranean or Caribbean, some captains disposed of captured ships without bringing them before an Admiralty prize agent, often defrauding their own crews of all or part of their prize money entitlement. A Royal Proclamation of 1702 made captains that failed to act through prize agents liable to court martial and dismissal.<ref name = \"Bromley 449-450\"> Bromley 449-450</ref> If the Admiralty Court found that a seizure was unlawful, the ships and cargo was restored to its owner, and the captor would be responsible for any loss or costs arising.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 64-65\"> Malcomson, 64-65</ref>\n\n==[[Great Britain]], 1707 to 1801== \nAfter the [[Act of Union 1707]] between England and Scotland, the former English prize money rules applied to Great Britain. The War of the Spanish Succession continued until 1714. \n\nAn Act of 1708, generally known as the ''Cruisers and Convoys Act'' was designed to protect British maritime trade by allocating Royal Navy ships to protect [[Convoy|convoys]], by encouraging privateers to assist in protecting convoys and amending the prize rules to encourage naval ships to attack enemy warships, and both Royal Navy ships and privateers to attack enemy privateers and merchant ships.The two main changes to the made under this Act were the abolition of the Crown\u2019s shares in the value of merchant ships and their cargoes captured by naval vessels, and of goods captured by privateers, and the payment of ''Head money'' of 5 pounds for each crew member of a captured or sunk enemy warship, as far as these could be established, replacing gun money. As with other Prize Acts, this ceased to have effect at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1714, although its provisions were largely repeated in subsequent Prize Acts of 1756, 1776, 1780 and 1793, issued at the outbreaks of conflicts or to include new belligerents.<ref name = \"Baugh 113-114\"> Baugh 113-114</ref><ref name = \"Wright 58\"> Wright 58</ref> Occasionally, if an enemy merchant ship were captured where it was difficult to take it to an Admiralty Court or prize agent, the captor might offer to ransom it for 10% to 15% of its estimated value.<ref name = \"Hill, 99\"> Hill, 99</ref>. In 1815, ransoming was prohibited except in case of necessity, for example where an enemy warship were nearby.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 68-69\"> Malcomson, 68-69</ref>   \n\nThe 1708 Act still required captured ships to be placed in the custody of Admiralty prize agents before adjudication by the Admiralty Court, and of paying [[Customs]] duties on captured cargoes. However, once they had paid these duties, Royal Navy captors were free to sell these cargoes at the best prices rather than having to sell them through Admiralty prize agents, as privateers had always been able to do so. The Act also allowed Royal Navy captains, officers and crews to appoint their own experts and prize agents to dispute the value of ships or goods acquired for naval use and collect prize money on their behalf.<ref name = \"Rodger, 128\u2013130\"> Rodger (1986) 128\u2013130</ref> Admiralty appointed prize agents were, however, now entitled to a fee of 2% in Britain and 5% abroad. The various changes brought in by this Act are regarded as the basis for the fortunes made from prize money in the 18th and early 19th centuries.\n<ref name = \"Bromley 451-452\"> Bromley 451-452</ref>.\n\n===Distribution===\nIn the Georgian navy, shares of prize money were based on rank. As there were few senior of\ufb01cers, their individual shares were larger than junior officers and very much larger than those of the seamen. The percentages of prize money granted to senior of\ufb01cers were generally higher in the 18th century than in most of the 19th century. Although shares varied over time, and captains within a \ufb02eet or squadron could agree alternative sharing arrangements, in the 18th century, an admiral could generally receive one-eighth of the value of all prizes taken by his fleet or squadron, and if there were more than one admiral, they would share that eighth. A captain usually received one-quarter of the value his prize, or three-eighths if not under the command of an admiral. The distribution for other officers and men was less detailed than it later became: other other of\ufb01cer shared another quarter and the crew shared the remainder. Any ships within sight of a battle also participated in the sharing of prize money, and any unclaimed prize money was allocated to [[Greenwich Hospital, London| Greenwich Hospital]].<ref name = \"Allen, 213\"> Allen, 213</ref>  \n\nDuring the [[Seven Years' War]], the crews of privateers operating from the British colonies in America and the Caribbean were often paid wages as well as a share of prize money, but the crews of those operating from British ports usually received no wages and the cost the provisions they consumed was deducted from their prize money. The owners of privateers generally took half the value of any prize and also charged a further 10% to cover prize agents' fees and other commissions. The captain received 8% of the value by custom, leaving 32% to be shared by the other officers and crew. It was common practice to divide this into shares, with the officers receiving several times as much as seamen, their relative shares being agreed at the start of the voyage.<ref name = \"Rodger, 97, 312\"> Rodger (1986) 97, 312</ref>\n\n===Notable awards, 1707 to 1801=== \nPerhaps the greatest amount of prize money awarded for the capture of a single ship was for that of the [[Spanish frigate Hermione|Spanish frigate ''Hermione'']] on 31 May 1762 by the British frigate {{HMS|Active|1758|2}} and sloop {{HMS|Favourite|1757|2}}. The two captains, [[Herbert Sawyer (1730\u20131798)|Herbert Sawyer]] and [[Philemon Pownoll]], received about \u00a365,000 apiece, while each seaman and Marine got \u00a3482 to 485.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillsdalesites.org/personal/hstewart/war/Navy3/1762-Hermione.htm |title=Capture of The Hermione |accessdate=2008-08-04 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422014607/http://www.hillsdalesites.org/personal/hstewart/war/Navy3/1762-Hermione.htm |archivedate=April 22, 2009 }} </ref><ref name=hms>{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxoaXN0b3JpY2FsbWFyaXRpbWVzb2NpZXR5fGd4OjQ3NzRiYTAyMmRjNjFiOGM |title=Nelson and His Navy \u2013 Prize Money |publisher=The Historical Maritime Society |accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23496 |title=How Britannia Came to Rule the Waves |author=W.

As a result of the [[Siege of Havana]], which led to the surrender of that city on August 1762, 10 Spanish [[ships-of-the-line]], three [[frigates]] and a number of smaller vessels were captured, together with large quantities of military equipment, cash and merchandise. Prize money payments of \u00a3122,697 each were made to the naval commander, Vice-Admiral Sir [[George Pocock]], and the military commander, [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle]], with \u00a324,539 paid to [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel| Commodore Keppel]], the naval second-in-command who was Albemarle's younger brother. Each of the 42 naval captains present received \u00a31,600 as prize money.<ref name = \"Rodger, 247-248\"> Rodger (1986) 257-258</ref>\n\nThe prize money from [[Action of 16 October 1799|the capture of the Spanish frigates ''Thetis'' and ''Santa Brigada'']] in October 1799, \u00a3652,000, was split up among the crews of four British frigates, with each captain being awarded \u00a340,730 and the Seamen each receiving \u00a3182 4s 9\u00bed or the equivalent of 10 years' pay.<ref name = \"Rodger, 524\"> Rodger (2005) 524</ref>\n\n==[[United Kingdom]] from 1801==\nAfter the [[Act of Union 1801]] between Great Britain and Ireland, the former prize money rules of Great Britain applied to the United Kingdom. The [[Treaty of Amiens]] of March 1802 ended the hostilities of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and those of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] commenced in May 1803, when the United Kingdom declared war in France.\n \nPrize Acts at the start of war with France and Spain repeated the provisions of the 1793 Act, which in turn largely repeated those of 1708.<ref name = \"Wright 59\"> Wright 59</ref> The basis of distribution under these acts is detailed in the next section. However, a proclamation of 1812 soon after the start of the [[War of 1812]] made a further revision to the rules on allocation, such that the admiral and captain jointly received one-quarter of the prize money with one-third of this going to the admiral, a reduction from their previous entitlement. The Master and lieutenants received one-eighth of the prize money, as did the warrant officers. The crew below warrant officer rank now shared one-half of the prize money. However, this group was subdivided into several grades, from senior petty officers down to boys, with the higher grades gaining at the expense of the lower ones. <ref name = \"Hill, 204-205\"> Hill, 204-205</ref> The Prize Act of 1815, issued after [[Napoleon]]\u2019s return from Elba, largely repeated the allocation below the flag officers\u2019 share into eight grades and, although it lapsed in the same year, its provisions were re-enacted in 1854 at the start of the [[Crimean War]].<ref name = \"Wright 60-61\"> Wright 60-61</ref>\n\nThe multiplicity of prize money grades survived until 1918, with some refinements to include new ratings required for steamships. The Naval Agency and Distribution Act of 1864 was a permanent Act, rather than one enacted at the start of a particular conflict, stating that prize money was to be distributed according to a [[Royal Proclamation]] or [[Order in Council]] issued when appropriate.<ref name = \" Lushington 106-107, 109-111\"> Lushington, 106-107</ref> This act made no provision for privateers as the United Kingdom had signed the [[Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law| Declaration of Paris]], which outlawed privateering by the ships of signatory nations.<ref name = \"Parillo 62-63\"> Parillo (2007), 62-63</ref> The [[Royal Proclamation]] on the division of prize money dated 19 May 1866 provided for a single admiral to receive, or several admiral to share, one-thirtieth of the prize money pool; a single captain or commanding officer to receive, or several share, one-tenth of the pool, and the residue to be allocated to officers and ratings in 10 classes in specified shares.<ref name = \" Lushington 109-111\"> Lushington, 109-111</ref>\n\nThe Prize Courts Acts of 1894 provided that regulations for setting up of Prize Courts and on prize money should in future be initiated at the start of any war only by an [[Order in Council]] and not by Royal Proclamation. The Naval Prize Act 1918 changed the system to one where the prize money was no longer paid to the crews of individual ships, but into a common fund from which a payment was made to all naval personnel. The Act also stated that no distribution until after the end of the war. The award of prize money in the two World Wars were governed by this legislation, which was further modified in 1945 to allow for the distribution to be made to [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) personnel who had been involved in the capture of enemy ships. The Prize Act, 1948 abolished the Crown prerogative of granting prize money or any money arising from Droits of the Crown in wartime. <ref name = \" O\u2019Hare 116-117\"> O\u2019Hare 116-117</ref>\n\nFor more on the Prize Court during [[World War I]], ''see also'' [[Maxwell Hendry Maxwell-Anderson]].\n\n===Anti-slavery===\nAfter the British abolition of the slave trade in 1807, an additional source of prize money arose when Royal Navy ships of the [[West Africa Squadron]] captured slave ships. Under an Order in Council of 1808, the government paid 60 [[Pound sterling| pounds]] for each male slave freed, 30 pounds for each woman and 10 pounds for each child aged under 14. This was paid in lieu of any prize money for the captured slave ship, which became the property of the British government, and it was allocated in the same proportions as other prize money. Between 1807 and 1811, 1,991 slaves were freed through the Vice-Admiralty Court of [[Sierra Leone]], and between 1807 and mid-1815, [[HM Treasury]] paid Royal Navy personnel 191,100 pounds in prize money for slaves freed in West Africa. Condemned slave ships were usually auctioned at Freetown and re-registered as British ships.<ref name = \"Allen, 213\"> Allen, 213</ref><ref name = \"Helfman, 1143-1144\"> Helfman, 1143-1144</ref> However, in 1825, the bounty for all slaves was reduced to a flat rate of 10 pounds, and it was further reduced to 5 pounds for each live slave in 1830. The decline in captures prompted an increase in prize money in 1839 to 5 pounds for each slave landed alive, half that sum for slaves that had died and one pound and ten [[Shilling (British coin)| shillings]] for each ton of the captured vessel\u2019s [[tonnage]].<ref name = \"Lloyd, 79-81\"> Lloyd 79-81</ref>. \n\n===Distribution===\n[[File:Warrantchart.png|thumb|Command structure of a Navy ship c. 1810, showing prize money groupings]]\nThe following scheme for distribution of prize money was used for much of the [[Napoleonic wars]] until 1812, the heyday of prize warfare. Allocation was by eighths. Two eighths of the prize money went to the [[Captain (naval)|captain]] or commander, generally propelling him upwards in political and financial circles. One eighth of the money went to the [[admiral]] or commander-in-chief who signed the ship's written orders (unless the orders came directly from the [[Admiralty]] in London, in which case this eighth also went to the captain). One eighth was divided among the [[lieutenant]]s, [[sailing master]], and [[Captain (land)|captain of marines]], if any. One eighth was divided among the  wardroom warrant officers ([[Ship's doctor|surgeon]], [[purser]], and [[chaplain]]), standing warrant officers ([[carpenter]], [[boatswain]], and [[Gunner (rank)|gunner]]), [[lieutenant|lieutenant of marines]], and the [[master's mate]]s.  One eighth was divided among the junior warrant and petty officers, their mates, sergeants of marines, [[captain's clerk]], [[surgeon's mate]]s, and [[midshipman|midshipmen]]. The final two eighths were divided among the crew, with able and specialist seamen receiving larger shares than ordinary seamen, landsmen, and boys.<ref name=\"lavery135136\">*{{cite book|last=Lavery|first=Brian|title=Nelson's Navy: The Ships, Men and Organization|year=1989|location=Annapolis, MD |publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=0-87021-258-3|oclc=20997619|url=https://archive.org/details/nelsonsnavyships00lave|url-access=registration|quote=Nelson's Navy Lavery.|accessdate=2009-05-19|pages=[https://archive.org/details/nelsonsnavyships00lave/page/135 135]\u2013136}}</ref><ref name = \"Rodger, 522\u2013524\">Rodger (205) 522\u2013524</ref> The pool for the seamen was divided into shares, with each able seaman getting two shares in the pool (referred to as a fifth-class share), an ordinary seaman received a share and a half (referred to as a sixth-class share), landsmen received a share each (a seventh-class share), and boys received a half share each (referred to as an eighth-class share).\n\nA notable prize award related to a capture in January 1807, when the frigate ''Caroline'' took the Spanish ship ''San Rafael'' as a prize, netting Captain Peter Rainier \u00a352,000.<ref name=hms />\n\n===Operational difficulties===\nFor much of the 18th century and until 1815, the main complaints about prize money concerned delays in its payment and practices that deprived ordinary seamen of much of what was due to them. Although the incidence of captains selling captured ships abroad and defrauding crews of prize money reduced greatly in the course of the century, payment was often by way of a promissory note, or ''ticket'' to be paid when the relevant naval department had funds. Although officers could generally afford to wait for payment, which was often made only in London and sometimes in instalments that might stretch over several years, most seamen sold their promissory notes at a large discount.<ref name = \"Bromley 474-476\"> Bromley 474-476</ref> Other seamen authorised another individual to collect their prize money, who did not always passed it on, or lost out when they transferred to a new ship, if their prize money were not forwarded. A final issue of contention was that the value of prizes assessed in overseas Vice-Admiralty courts could be reassessed in the Admiralty Court in Britain if the Admiralty appealed the initial valuation. Excessive valuations in Vice-Admiralty courts, particularly in the West Indies, arose because the courts charged fees based on the prizes' values.<ref name = \"Rodger, 317-318\"> Rodger (1986) 317-318</ref>This led to delays and possible reduced payments.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 65-66\"> Malcomson, 65-66</ref> \n\nTo some extent, delays arose from the time taken by Vice-Admiralty courts adjudicating whether captured ships were legitimate prizes and, if they were, their value. In the [[War of 1812]], the Vice-Admiralty courts at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Bermuda]] had to deal with many, often small, American ships captured both by privateers and naval vessels, leading to lengthy legal delays in adjudication. Once an adjudication was made, providing there was no appeal, the funds from the sale of a captured ship or its goods should have been available for payment within two years, but the whole process from capture to payment might take three years or more. <ref name = \"Malcomson, 63-64\"> Malcomson, 63-64</ref> \n\nUnder the so-called ''joint capture''rules, which did not apply to privateers, any Royal Navy ship present when a capture took place was entitled to share in the prize money. However, this rule led to disputes where, for example, three claimant ships had been pursuing the captured ship but were out of sight when another captured it, or where a squadron commander claimed a share in a prize captured by his subordinate in disobedience to that commander\u2019s orders. In order to minimise disputes, some captains and crews of ships on the same mission made time-limited agreements to share prize money.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 64-65\"> Malcomson, 64-65</ref> In the case of privateers, for one to claim a share of prize money, it had to give actual assistance to the ship making the capture unless there were a prior agreement between privateers to share prizes.<ref name = \"Van Niekerk, 119\"> Van Niekerk 119</ref>\n\n==Scotland and Ireland==\n\n===Scotland=== \nThe [[Kingdom of Scotland]] had its own [[Lord High Admiral of Scotland| Lord High Admiral]] from mediaeval times until 1707, except for the period 1652 to 1661.

Ireland also had its own Admiralty Court, mainly staffed by English admiralty officials and with a jurisdiction was broadly similar to that of its English counterpart.<ref name = \"Appleby & O'Dowd, 229-300\"> Appleby & O'Dowd 229-300</ref> Much of its activities concerned the many pirates operating off the coast of Ireland during the late 16th and early 17th centuries.

A commission of jurists, the Prize Council (''Conseil des Prises''), was established in 1659 to deal with the adjudication of all prizes and the distribution of prize money, although many French privateers tried to evade its scrutiny.<ref name = \" Cormack, 76\"> Cormack 76</ref> Cormack (2002), p.76.

Although these alternatives had a strategic basis, only Guerre de Course was viable when financial problems prevented the maintenance of a battle fleet.<ref name = \"Symcox, 3-5\"> Symcox 3-5</ref> Even when it was possible to equip a battle fleet, the French naval doctrine that a fleet must avoid any action that might prevent it carrying out its designated mission, prioritised defensive tactics which made captures and prize money unlikely.<ref name = \"Jenkins, 108, 342\"> Jenkins 108, 342</ref>\n\nWhen a policy of commerce raiding was adopted, the major warships were laid up, but many of the smaller warships manned by the officers and men of the French Navy, were leased by the French Crown to contractors, who paid the fitting-out and running costs of these ships, and agreed to pay the Crown one-fifth of the value of all captures.<ref name = \"Jenkins, 100-102\"> Jenkins 100-102</ref> Jenkins (1973), These ships were, however, regarded as privateers, and other privateers were entirely financed by private individuals: in both cases, the privateers operated as their owners and lessees wished, outside if government control.

The [[Lieutenant-Admiral]] of an admiralty generally received four times as much as the captain responsible for a capture, and the [[Vice-Admiral]] twice as much: in both cases, these flag-officers shared in all ships and goods taken by captains in their admiralties, even when not present at the capture.<ref name = \" Bruijn, 44, 104\"> Bruijn(2011) 44, 104</ref> In 1640, [[Maarten Tromp]], a Lieutenant-Admiral was owed 13,800 [[guilders]], mostly his share of prize money from the [[Battle of the Downs]] the previous year. \n\nBoth captains and flag officers in the Dutch fleet sometimes put the pursuit of prize money before discipline. In the [[Four Days' Battle]] of June 1666, several Dutch ships left the fleet either towing English ships they had captured or in pursuit of prizes, <ref name = \"Fox 212, 218\"> Fox 212, 218</ref> and [[Cornelis Tromp]] was extremely reluctant to burn {{HMS|Prince Royal|1610|6}} after it had run aground and been damaged, despite the orders of his commander, [[Michiel de Ruyter]].

In many cases, Dutch privateers attempted to evade the prize rules, by attacking neutral or even Dutch ships, failing to bring captures or their cargoes for adjudication and removing and selling cargoes to avoid paying duties.<ref name = \"Lunsford, 155-156\"> Lunsford, 155-156</ref> Privateers licenced by the two Dutch India companies were aggressive in attacking what they termed ''interlopers'' in their areas of operations, regardless of nationality, and both companies were active in privateering in the three Anglo-Dutch wars. .<ref name = \"Lunsford, 183-184\"> Lunsford 183-184</ref> \n\nDuring the [[Eighty Years' War]], the main targets of Dutch privateers were Spanish and Portuguese ships, including those of the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. Privateers licenced by the West India Company were very active against ships trading with Brazil. <ref name = \"Klooster, 43-44\"> Klooster 43-44</ref> The privateers that had attacked Portuguese shipping had to cease doing so after the 1661 [[Treaty of The Hague]], but many quickly transferred their activities to attacking English shipping after 1665 during the Second and Third Anglo-Dutch wars. <ref name = \"Bruijn, 145\"> Bruijn (2011) 145</ref>. However, there was relatively little Dutch privateering after the end of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], a consequence of the general decline in Dutch maritime activity. <ref name = \"Bruijn, 56\"> Bruijn (2008) 56</ref>\n\n==United States==\n===To 1814===\nDuring the Revolutionary War period, the [[Continental Congress]] had no navy and relied heavily on privateers who had been authorised by one of the states to capture British ships. Admiralty Courts for the state that had authorised the privateer adjudicated on the ownership of captured vessels and their value. <ref name = \"Mask & Mac Mahon, 477, 480\"> Mask & Mac Mahon 477, 480</ref> The [[Continental Navy]], formed in 1775 was small and outmatched by the Royal Navy, whereas American privateers captured about 600 British merchant ships in the course of this conflict. <ref name = \"Mask & Mac Mahon, 487\"> Mask & Mac Mahon 487</ref>  In 1787, the US Constitution transferred the right to grant [[Letters of Marque]] from the states to Congress. <ref name = \"Parrillo, 3\"> Parrillo (2007) 3</ref>  \n\nAt the start of the [[War of 1812]], the few larger US Navy ships were laid-up, while the Royal Navy had relatively few resources available in the western Atlantic, leaning the field free for privateers on both sides.<ref name = \"Kert, 7-8\"> Kert 7-8</ref> However, once the US Navy frigates were brought back into commission, they achieved some spectacular successes against weaker British frigates, with [[Stephen Decatur]] and [[John Rodgers (1772-1838)| John Rodgers]] both receiving over 10,000 dollars in prize money.<ref name = \"Kert, 114\"> Kert 114</ref> However, later in the war, the Royal Navy succeeded in blockading the US [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern seaboard]] and capturing several US Navy vessels and a number of merchant ships, and also stifling American privateer activity, although single US Navy warships managed to avoid the blockade and attack British shipping in the [[Caribbean]] and off South America.<ref name = \"Kert, 115-116\"> Kert 116-116</ref> \n\nFrom the inception of its navy, the United States government granted naval personnel additional payments of two kinds, prize money, being a share in the proceeds from captured enemy merchant vessels and their cargo, and head money, a cash reward from the US Treasury for sinking enemy warships. From 1791, US Navy personnel received half the proceeds of a prize of equal or inferior force, and all the proceeds of a vessel of superior force. Privateers, in contrast, received all the proceeds of any prize, but had to pay duties that rose to 40% during the War of 1812, although they were lower at other times. Generally, half of the net amount went to the owners of the privateer, half to the crew.<ref name = \"Parillo 24\"> Parillo (2007), 24</ref> From 1800, US Navy ships that sunk an armed enemy ship received a bounty of twenty dollars for each enemy crew member at the start of the action, divided among the crew of that ship in the same proportions as other prize money.<ref name = \"Parillo 25\"> Parillo (2007), 25</ref>\n\n===Distribution===\nUnder United States legislation of 1800, whether the officers and men of the navy ship or ships responsible for the capturing a prize were entitled to half of the assessed value of the prize, or the whole value in the case of a capture of superior force, the prize money fund was to be allocated in specified proportions. The captain or captains of vessels taking prizes were entitled to 10% of the prize money fund, and the commander of the squadron to 5% of the fund. In the event that the captain was operating independently, he received 15% of the prize fund. Naval lieutenants, captains of marines and sailing Masters were to share 10%, increased to approximately 12% if there were no lieutenants of marines. Chaplains, lieutenants of marines, surgeons, pursers, boatswains, gunners, carpenters, and master\u2019s mates shared 10% of the prize fund, reduced to approximately 8% if there were no lieutenants of marines. Midshipman, junior warrant offices and the mates of senior warrant officers shared 17.5% and a range of petty officers a further 12.5%. This left 35% for the rest of the crew. Any unclaimed prize money was to be retained jointly by the Navy and Treasury secretaries to fund disability pensions and [[half-pay]].<ref name = \"Peters, 47-48, Articles V, VI, IX and X\"> Peters 47-48, Articles V, VI, IX and X</ref> \n \n===From 1815===\nFor most of the period between the end of the War of 1812 and the start of the [[American Civil War]], there was little opportunity to gain prize money. After the outbreak of the Civil War, the [[Confederate States of America| Confederate States]] granted some 30 commissions or Letters of marque to privateers, which captured between 50 and 60 United States merchant ships. However, a declaration by [[Abraham Lincoln]] that [[Confederate privateer]]s would be treated as pirates and the closure of the ports of European colonies in the Caribbean as venues for the disposal of prize vessels and cargoes encoraged their owners to turn to [[Blockade runner| Blockade running]].<ref name = \"Peifer, 98-99\"> Peifer 98-99</ref> \n\nFrom 1861, US Navy ships engaged Confederate privateers and [[Blockade runner]]s: as the 1800 legislation only applied to enemies of the United States, which did not recognise the Confederate States, it was unclear if prize money would apply. However, a revised statute of 1864 stated that \"the provisions of this title shall apply to all captures made as prize by authority of the United States\", allowing prize money claims to be made.<ref name = \"Library of Congress, 315, Section 33\"> Library of Congress, 315, Section 33</ref> Over 11 million dollars of prize money was paid to US Navy personnel for captures in the [[American Civil War| Civil War]] period. It has been calculated that about one-third of prize money due was payable to officers under the prevailing rules, but that approximately half of the money actually paid went to officers, most probably because of the difficulty in tracing enlisted men when payments were delayed.<ref name = \"Parillo 66\"> Parillo (2013), 66</ref>\n\nIn 1856, the [[Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law| Declaration of Paris]] was signed: this outlawed privateering by the ships of the 55 nations that signed it. However, the United States did not Spain sign the declaration, in part because it considered that, if privateering were to be abolished, the capture of merchant ships by naval vessels should also cease. Despite this, the United States agreed to respect the declaration during the [[American Civil War]], although [[Abraham Lincoln| Lincoln's]] cabinet did discuss the use of privateers against British merchant shipping in the event Britain recognised the Confederacy.<ref name = \"Parillo 63\"> Parillo (2007) 63</ref> \n\nA number of changes were made to the allocation of prize money to US Navy personnel in the 19th century in the last being in 1864. This preserved the awards 5% of the prize fund to commanders of the squadron, which now also applied to fleet commanders of fleet and of 10% to captains under the immediate command of a flag officer or 15% for those operating independently. It added new awards of 2% for a commander of a division of a fleet under the orders of a fleet commander and 1% for a [[Captain of the fleet| fleet captain]] stationed on the flagship. The most significant change was that the residue of prize money after making these awards was to be divided amongst the remaining officers and men in proportion to their rates of pay. This law also increased the bounty or head money for destroying an enemy warship in action, or any other enemy ship that it was necessary to destroy was increased to 100 dollars for each enemy crew member at the start of the action on a ship of less or equal force, or 200 dollars for each crew member of an enemy ship of greater force, to be divided among the officers and men of the US ship in the same proportions as other prize money.<ref name = \"Library of Congress, 309-301, Sections 10 & 11\"> Library of Congress, 309-301, Sections 10 & 11</ref>\n\nThe small size of US Navy meant that privateering would be the main way it could attack enemy commerce. In the Civil War, Lincoln's cabinet had discussed the use of privateers against British merchant shipping in the event Britain recognised the Confederacy, Until the early 1880s, American naval opinion considered that privateering remained a viable option, although subsequent increases in the size of the US Navy changed this view.<ref name = \"Parillo 4, 10-11\"> Parillo (2007) 4 10-11</ref> \n\nIn the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] of 1898, neither the United States nor Spain issued commissions to privateers. However, the US Navy was granted what were to be last payments of prize money made by the US Treasury for that war. These were to sailors that took part in the battles of [[Battle of Manila Bay| Manila Bay]] and [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba| Santiago]] and divided prize funds of 244,400 dollars and 166,700 dollars respectively, based on the estimated numbers of Spanish sailors and the value of ships salvaged at Manilla.<ref name = \"Knauth, 70, 73\"> Knauth 70, 73</ref>\n\n===Abolition===\nDuring the Spanish American War in 1898, the US Navy was seen by much of the United States population as seeking to profit from prize money and head money to an unacceptable extent, even though the amounts of granted were relatively modest. All awards of prize money and head money to US Navy personnel were abolished by an overwhelming vote of Congress in March 1899, shortly after the Spanish-American War conclded.<ref name = \"Parillo, 47, 308-309\"> Parillo (2013) 47, 308-309</ref> \n\nIt is sometimes claimed that the US Navy last paid prize money in 1947.<ref>Nofi, Al (20 July 2008).

Although the Odenwald was not a warship, it was sailing under the United States flag and claiming to be registered there, and also carrying contraband, either of which rendered the ship liable to arrest although not condemnation as a prize. After the Odenwald was stopped, its crew tried to scuttle it and took to the lifeboats. However, a boarding party from the Omaha managed to prevent the Odenwald from sinking and sailed it first to [[Trinidad]], then to [[Puerto Rico]]. The United States was not at war with Germany at the time, and after the war, the Odenwald\u2019s owners claimed that its seizure was therefore illegal. The Admiralty Court in Puerto Rico, however, ruled in 1947 that the crew\u2019s attempt to scuttle the ship, and then abandon, it meant that the Omaha\u2019s boarding party and salvage party that jointly brought the Odenwald to port had salvage rights, worth approximately 3 million dollars. It also ruled explicitly that it was not a case of bounty or prize.<ref> Justia US Law.

However, between 1775 and 1815, revenues declined sharply, largely because the probability of seizing a prize ship fell dramatically, partly owing to the increasing numbers of naval vessels competing for captures. As outfitting and manning ships for commerce raiding was expensive, privateering became less financially attractive.<ref name = \"Hillmann & Gathmann, 732, 740, 746-748\"> Hillmann & Gathmann 732, 740, 746-748</ref> \n\nThe Declaration of Paris 1856, by outlawing privateering by ships of signatory nations, would have made it politically difficult for non-signatories, which included the United States to commission privateers in a future conflict,<ref name = \"Parillo 63\"> Parillo (2007) 63</ref> and the privateering using metal-hulled steamships presented the additional problems of maintaining complex engines, the need for frequent re-coaling and to repair more complex damage than that experienced by wooden-hulled sailing ships. In addition, after 1880, many maritime countries paid subsidies so that liners and other fast merchant vessels were built with a view to conversion into [[Armed merchantmen | Armed Merchant Cruisers]] under naval control in wartime, which replaced the need for privateers, and no privateers were commissioned after the American Civil War.<ref name = \"Coogan, 22\"> Coogan 22</ref><ref name = \"Parillo, 76-78\"> Parillo (2007) 76-78</ref> \n  \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite journal| first1= J.C.|last1= Appleby |first2=M. |last2=O'Dowd| title = The Irish Admiralty: Its Organisation and Development, c. 1570-1640| journal= Irish Historical Studies| year = 1985| volume=24|issue=96| pages=299-326}}\n* {{cite journal|first= D.

It was a monetary reward paid in accordance with the [[prize law]] of a belligerent state to the crew of a ship belonging to the state, either a warship of its navy or a [[privateer]] vessel commissioned by the state. Prize money was most frequently awarded for the capture of enemy ships or of cargoes belonging to an enemy in time of war, either arrested in port at the outbreak of war or captured during the war in international waters or other waters not the territorial waters of a neutral state. Goods carried in neutral ships that are classed as [[contraband]], being shipped to enemy-controlled territory and liable to be useful to it for making war, were also liable to be taken as prizes, but non-contraband goods belonging to neutrals were not. Claims for the award of prize money were usually heard in a [[Prize Court]], which had to adjudicate the claim and condemn the prize before any distribution of cash or goods could be made to the captors.\n\nOther cases in which prize money has been awarded include prize money for the capture of pirate ships, slave ships after the abolition of the slave trade and ships trading in breach of the [[Navigation Acts]], none of which require a state of war to exist. Similar monetary awards include ''Military Salvage'', the recapture of ships captured by an enemy before an enemy Prize Court has declared them to be valid prizes (after such ships have been condemned, they are treated as enemy ships), and payments termed ''Gun money'', ''Head Money'' or ''[[Bounty (reward)| Bounty]]'', distributed to men serving in a state warship that captured or destroyed of an armed enemy ship. The amount payable depended at first on the number of guns the enemy carried, but later on the complement of the defeated ship. \n\nCertain captures made by armies, called ''Booty of War'', are distinct from naval prize because, unlike awards under naval prize legislation, the award of booty is only made for a specific capture, often the storming of a city; the award does not set a precedent for other military captures in the same war, and does not require adjudication by a prize court. When the British army and navy acted together, it was normal for instructions to say how any prizes and booty should be shared, and the shares allocated. In this case, combined naval and military force to be dealt with under naval prize law rules.  \n\nAlthough prize law still exists, the payment of prize money to privateers ceased in practice during the second half of the 19th century and prize money for naval personnel was abolished by thise maritime states that had provided it at various times in the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. \n\n\n==Origins==\nThe two roots of prize law and the consequent distribution of prize money are the mediaeval maritime codes, such as the [[Book of the Consulate of the Sea| Consolato Del Mare]] and [[Rolls of Oleron]], which codified the customary laws that reserved legal rights over certain property found or captured at sea, in harbour or on the shore for the rulers of maritime states,<ref name = \"Wright 16\"> Wright 16</ref> and the 16th and 17th century formulation of international law by jurists such as [[Hugo Grotius]].<ref name = \"Wright 23\"> Wright 23</ref>. These jurists considered that only the state could authorise war, and that goods captured from an enemy in war belong as of right to its monarch. However, it was customary for the state to reward those who that assisted in making such captures by granting them part of the proceeds.<ref name = \"Wright 21-23\"> Wright 21-23</ref>\n\nIn various 17th century states, the crown retained from one-tenth to one-fifth of the value of ships and cargoes taken by privateers but up to half of the value of those captured by the state\u2019s navy. Grotius also recorded the practices that, for a prize to be effective, the ship must either be brought to port or retained for 24 hours, and that no distribution of prize money or goods could made without due court authorisation.<ref name = \"Wright 22, 24\"> Wright 22, 24</ref>  \n\nMost European maritime states, and other maritime states that adopted laws based on European models, had codes of prize law based on the above principles that allowed for monetary rewards for captures. However, details of prize money law and practice are known for relatively few of these. They include [[England|English]] rules from the 17th century, which formed the basis for the rules for [[Great Britain]] and the [[United Kingdom]] in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, those of [[France]] from the 17th to 20th centuries, the [[Dutch Republic]], mainly for the 17th century, and the [[United States]] for the 18th and 19th centuries.<ref name = \"Wright 27\"> Wright 27</ref> The smaller navies of maritime states such as Denmark and Sweden, had little chance of gaining prize money because they had few opportunities to capture enemy ships in wartime, both because, after the [[Great Northern War]], they were rarely involved in naval wars and, when they were, their fleets were much weaker than their major opponents.<ref name = \"Wilson, Hammar & Seerup 5, 163-164\"> Wilson, Hammar & Seerup 5, 163-164</ref>    \n\n===Booty of war===\nBooty of war, also termed ''spoils of war'' is the movable property of an enemy state or its subjects which can be used for warlike purposes, in particular its soldiers' arms and equipment, captured on land, as opposed to ''prize'' which is hostile property captured at sea. It is legally the property of the victorious state, but all or part of it (or its value) may be granted to the troops that capture it.<ref name = \"Phillimore, 214-215\"> Phillimore, 214-215</ref> In British practice, although the Crown may grant booty and to specify its distribution, this was done by a special proclamation relating to a specific capture which did not set a precedent, not a general measure dealing with all captures made during a war, as were naval Prize Acts.<ref name = \"Van Niekerk, 123\"> Van Niekerk, 123</ref> Instances of it being granted include the [[Siege of Seringapatam]], 1799, the capture of [[Bordeaux]], 1814 and the [[Siege of Delhi]], 1857.<ref name = \"Phillimore, 214-215\"> Phillimore, 214-215</ref>. Although the United States and France had allowed their soldiers to profit from booty on a basis similar to Britain, they abolished the practice in 1899 and 1901 respectively.<ref name = \"Phillimore, 227-229\"> Phillimore, 227-229</ref>. The [[Third Geneva Convention]] now only allows the arms, military equipment and military documents of prisoners of war to be seized and prohibits the award of booty.\n\n==England to 1707==\n[[The Crown]] of England had, from medieval times, legal rights over certain property found or captured at sea or found on the shore. These included the rights to [[shipwrecks]], ships found abandoned at the sea, [[Flotsam, jetsam, lagan and derelict]], enemy ships and goods found in English ports or captured at sea in wartime and goods taken from pirates. At first, these were collectively known as [[Droit| Droits]] of the Crown, but after the creation the office of the [[Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom| High Admiral, later the Lord High Admiral, of England]] in the early 15th century, they were known as Droits of Admiralty, as the Crown granted these rights, and legal jurisdiction the property specified in them, to the Lord Admiral. This jurisdiction ceased in 1702, but the name Droits of Admiralty remained in use.<ref name = \"Holdsworth 559-560\"> Holdsworth 559-560</ref> \n\nEarly Prize Law made little distinction between financial rewards made to officers and men of the Royal Navy and to privateers (civilians authorised to attack enemy shipping by [[Letters of marque]] issued by the Crown), as the former did not exist as a permanent force until the 16th century. Mediaeval rulers had no administrative mechanism to adjudicate prizes or collect the royal share. <ref name = \"Wright 31-33\"> Wright 31-33</ref> The first [[Admiralty Court]] in England with responsibility for prize and prize money issues was created in 1483 and subordinate Vice-Admiralty courts were later set up in British colonies. Appeal from the Court of Admiralty was to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom| Privy Council]]. As the rights over enemy ships or goods are legally prerogatives of the Crown, there are few English or British statues that deal with naval prize money, other than the Prize Acts issued at the start of each war, authorising the Crown to issue orders or proclamations dealing with prize money, and these acts affirm rather than limit the Crown\u2019s rights.<ref name = \"Marsden 91-92\"> Marsden (1915) 91-92</ref>  \n\nFrom Elizabethan times, the Crown insisted that the validity of prizes and their value had to be determined by royal courts, and that it should retain a portion of their value. In some cases, an English ship failing to bring a prize for adjudication was confiscated. Beyond this, it was left to the discretion of the Crown, guided by custom, as to what should be allocated to those taking prizes, and how that prize money should be allocated between the owners, the officers and the crew.<ref name = \"Wright 45-46\"> Wright 45-46</ref>.  Generally, the Crown retained one-tenth of the value of prizes captured by privateers. By ancient custom, the common seamen, but not the officers, of navy vessels had the right of \u2018\u2019free pillage\u2019\u2019, the seizure of the enemy crew\u2019s personal possessions and any goods not stored in the hold.<ref name = \"Marsden 695, 697\"> Marsden (1909) 695, 697</ref> The [[Commonwealth of England| Commonwealth]] attempted to forbid the custom of pillage in 1652, but this rule was impossible to enforce, and the right to pillage was given statutory force after [[The Restoration]].<ref name = \"Wright 51\"> Wright 51</ref>\n\nSome rewards that were previously customary or discretionary for privateers became entitlements 1643, when an ordinance passed by the Commonwealth parliament allowed them to retain any ships and goods captured after adjudication in an Admiralty Court and payment of one-tenth of the value of the prize and customs duties on any goods. A further ordinance of 1649 relating to naval ships, which applied during the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], entitled seamen and subordinate officers to half the value of a captured enemy warship and ''Gun money'' of between 10 and 20 [[Pound (currency)| pounds]] for every gun on an enemy warship that was sunk, and one third of the value of a captured enemy merchant ship. If a captured enemy warship were repairable at reasonable cost and suitable to add to the English fleet, the Crown might but bought it.<ref name = \"Marsden 37\"> Marsden (1911) 37</ref> However, until 1708, the purchase price was fixed by the Admiralty, whose agents were suspected of valuing them cheaply or inflating the cost of repairs.<ref name = \"Bromley 451\"> Bromley 451</ref> The 1643 ordinance also introduced two new measures: that part of the money not allocated to the ship\u2019s crew would go to the sick and wounded, and that English ships recaptured from an enemy were to be returned to their owner on payment of one-eighth of their value to the ship recapturing them. A further ordinance of 1650 applied these prize money rules to the capture of pirate ships.<ref name = \"Wright 50-51\"> Wright 50-51</ref> \n\nThe provisions of 1643, 1649 and 1650 on the distribution of prize money were repeated after [[The Restoration]] in an act of 1661, which also expressly allowed the custom of pillage, and allowed the Lord Admiral discretion over any money or goods not allocated to the crews. The right of disposing of captured prizes and pre-emption in acquiring their goods was also retained by the Lord Admiral.<ref name = \"Marsden 43-44\"> Marsden (1911) 43-44</ref> \n\n===[[Anglo-Dutch Wars]]===\nEven before the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] formally began, two steps were taken by the English government that that were liable to promote hostility between England and the Netherlands. Firstly, in 1663, the [[Navigation Acts| Navigation Act]], which aimed to restrict Dutch maritime trade, authorised the capture of English or foreign vessels trading in breach of that act as prizes, and allowed Vice-Admiralty Courts in the English colonies to adjudicate their value, and to award one-third of this value to the captor, one third to the colonial governor and one third to the Crown. These overseas Vice-Admiralty Courts were, from 1692, also able to deal with wartime prizes.<ref name = \"Marsden 43-44\"> Marsden (1911) 43-44</ref> Secondly, an [[Order in Council]] of 1644 increased the prize money due to the seamen of English ships that took prizes to 10 [[Shilling (British coin)| shillings]] for each [[ton]] comprised in their [[tonnage]], and gun money of at least 10 pounds a gun for any warship sunk or burned.<ref name = \"Fox 74\"> Fox 74</ref> \n\nAlthough neither [[Charles II of England| Charles II]] nor his brother James, Lord High Admiral since 1660, had been ungenerous to those Royal Navy captains and flag officers that captured enemy ships, giving them a fair allocation of the value of their prizes, the failure to set out a fixed scale of prize money for senior officers led to a scandal in 1665.<ref name = \"Fox 113\"> Fox 113</ref> [[Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich| The Earl of Sandwich]] commanded an English fleet that, between 3 September and 9 September, had captured thirteen [[Dutch East India Company]] merchant ships of the [[East Indies]] spice fleet, and had also captured or sunk several of their escorts. Concerned that Charles\u2019s difficult financial position might make him less generous that before, and considering the great value of the cargoes captured, Sandwich, urged on by one of his flag officers, [[Sir William Penn]], agreed that he and Penn should take goods to the value of 4,000 pounds, and that each other flag officer and the three captains that held knighthoods should take goods worth 2,000 pounds, from the captured cargoes: nothing was provided for the untitled captains.<ref name = \"Fox 113-114\"> Fox 113-114</ref> \n\nThis seizure of goods was represented by Sandwich and Penn as a payment on account of their expected prize money, although it was in clear breach of the instructions issued in 1665 at the outbreak of the war that required ships and goods to be declared as lawful prizes by an Admiralty court before any goods in its hold could be removed. Marsden, (1911), pp. 44-45. Three of those officers offered 2,000 pounds of goods refused to take them, and the untitled captains complained against the arrangement. In the course of the removal of goods from the Dutch ships\u2019 holds, many English sailors joined in the plundering, and a large quantity of spices and other valuable goods were stolen or spoilt. The Earl of Sandwich lost his command, and the government lost goods and money that could have been used to send the fleet back to sea.<ref name = \"Fox 115\"> Fox 115</ref>\n\nEnglish privateers were very prominent at sea during the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]], attacking the maritime trade and fisheries on which the United Provinces depended, capturing many Dutch merchant ships. <ref name = \"Fox 69-70\"> Fox 69-70</ref> \n\n===[[War of the Spanish Succession]]===\nThe situation of ships\u2019 captains was remedied by a Prize Act of 1692. This act distinguished between captures made by privateers and by royal ships. Privateers were entitled to retain any ships captured and four-fifths of the goods, surrendering one-fifth of those to the Crown, and it was left to them how they sold their prizes and distributed the proceeds. However, in the case of captures by royal ships, one-third of their value went to the officers and men of the captor, and one third to the king, from which he could reward flag officers. The final one-third was to benefit those sick and wounded, as before, and for the first time was also used to pay dependents of crew members killed and to fund [[Greenwich Hospital]].<ref name = \"Wright 53\"> Wright 53</ref>\n\nThe 1692 act also abolished the ancient right of pillage, standardised gun money at 10 pounds a gun and provided for [[salvage]] to be paid by the owners of English ships recaptured from the enemy. <ref name = \"Marsden 90\"> Marsden (1915) 90</ref> Until 1692, the allocation of the one-third of the value of prize money due to the officers and men lad been a matter of custom, but it was then fixed as one-third (or one-ninth of the total prize money) to the captain, one-third to other officers and one-third to the crew.<ref name =\" Ehrman 129-130\"> Ehrman 129-130</ref>\n\nDuring this war, in 1701, the [[Admiralty]] had established a board of Prize Commissioners, who appointed local prize agents at British and some colonial ports, and were responsible for the custody of ships captured both by privateers and royal ships until these captures were either condemned or released. Although privateers were free to dispose of prize ships and goods after they were condemned and any duties were paid, the Prize Commissioners were responsible for the sale of ships and cargoes captured by royal ships, the valuation of ships or goods acquired for Royal Navy use, and the calculation and payment of prize money. As many naval actions in this war took place in the Mediterranean or Caribbean, some captains disposed of captured ships without bringing them before an Admiralty prize agent, often defrauding their own crews of all or part of their prize money entitlement.

The War of the Spanish Succession continued until 1714. \n\nAn Act of 1708, generally known as the ''Cruisers and Convoys Act'' was designed to protect British maritime trade by allocating Royal Navy ships to protect [[Convoy|convoys]], by encouraging privateers to assist in protecting convoys and amending the prize rules to encourage naval ships to attack enemy warships, and both Royal Navy ships and privateers to attack enemy privateers and merchant ships.The two main changes to the made under this Act were the abolition of the Crown\u2019s shares in the value of merchant ships and their cargoes captured by naval vessels, and of goods captured by privateers, and the payment of ''Head money'' of 5 pounds for each crew member of a captured or sunk enemy warship, as far as these could be established, replacing gun money. As with other Prize Acts, this ceased to have effect at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1714, although its provisions were largely repeated in subsequent Prize Acts of 1756, 1776, 1780 and 1793, issued at the outbreaks of conflicts or to include new belligerents.<ref name = \"Baugh 113-114\"> Baugh 113-114</ref><ref name = \"Wright 58\"> Wright 58</ref> Occasionally, if an enemy merchant ship were captured where it was difficult to take it to an Admiralty Court or prize agent, the captor might offer to ransom it for 10% to 15% of its estimated value.<ref name = \"Hill, 99\"> Hill, 99</ref>. In 1815, ransoming was prohibited except in case of necessity, for example where an enemy warship were nearby.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 68-69\"> Malcomson, 68-69</ref>   \n\nThe 1708 Act still required captured ships to be placed in the custody of Admiralty prize agents before adjudication by the Admiralty Court, and of paying [[Customs]] duties on captured cargoes. However, once they had paid these duties, Royal Navy captors were free to sell these cargoes at the best prices rather than having to sell them through Admiralty prize agents, as privateers had always been able to do so. The Act also allowed Royal Navy captains, officers and crews to appoint their own experts and prize agents to dispute the value of ships or goods acquired for naval use and collect prize money on their behalf.<ref name = \"Rodger, 128\u2013130\"> Rodger (1986) 128\u2013130</ref> Admiralty appointed prize agents were, however, now entitled to a fee of 2% in Britain and 5% abroad. The various changes brought in by this Act are regarded as the basis for the fortunes made from prize money in the 18th and early 19th centuries.\n<ref name = \"Bromley 451-452\"> Bromley 451-452</ref>.\n\n===Distribution===\nIn the Georgian navy, shares of prize money were based on rank. As there were few senior of\ufb01cers, their individual shares were larger than junior officers and very much larger than those of the seamen. The percentages of prize money granted to senior of\ufb01cers were generally higher in the 18th century than in most of the 19th century. Although shares varied over time, and captains within a \ufb02eet or squadron could agree alternative sharing arrangements, in the 18th century, an admiral could generally receive one-eighth of the value of all prizes taken by his fleet or squadron, and if there were more than one admiral, they would share that eighth. A captain usually received one-quarter of the value his prize, or three-eighths if not under the command of an admiral. The distribution for other officers and men was less detailed than it later became: other other of\ufb01cer shared another quarter and the crew shared the remainder. Any ships within sight of a battle also participated in the sharing of prize money, and any unclaimed prize money was allocated to [[Greenwich Hospital, London| Greenwich Hospital]].<ref name = \"Allen, 213\"> Allen, 213</ref>  \n\nDuring the [[Seven Years' War]], the crews of privateers operating from the British colonies in America and the Caribbean were often paid wages as well as a share of prize money, but the crews of those operating from British ports usually received no wages and the cost the provisions they consumed was deducted from their prize money. The owners of privateers generally took half the value of any prize and also charged a further 10% to cover prize agents' fees and other commissions. The captain received 8% of the value by custom, leaving 32% to be shared by the other officers and crew. It was common practice to divide this into shares, with the officers receiving several times as much as seamen, their relative shares being agreed at the start of the voyage.<ref name = \"Rodger, 97, 312\"> Rodger (1986) 97, 312</ref>\n\n===Notable awards, 1707 to 1801=== \nPerhaps the greatest amount of prize money awarded for the capture of a single ship was for that of the [[Spanish frigate Hermione|Spanish frigate ''Hermione'']] on 31 May 1762 by the British frigate {{HMS|Active|1758|2}} and sloop {{HMS|Favourite|1757|2}}. The two captains, [[Herbert Sawyer (1730\u20131798)|Herbert Sawyer]] and [[Philemon Pownoll]], received about \u00a365,000 apiece, while each seaman and Marine got \u00a3482 to 485.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillsdalesites.org/personal/hstewart/war/Navy3/1762-Hermione.htm |title=Capture of The Hermione |accessdate=2008-08-04 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422014607/http://www.hillsdalesites.org/personal/hstewart/war/Navy3/1762-Hermione.htm |archivedate=April 22, 2009 }} </ref><ref name=hms>{{cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxoaXN0b3JpY2FsbWFyaXRpbWVzb2NpZXR5fGd4OjQ3NzRiYTAyMmRjNjFiOGM |title=Nelson and His Navy \u2013 Prize Money |publisher=The Historical Maritime Society |accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23496 |title=How Britannia Came to Rule the Waves |author=W.

As a result of the [[Siege of Havana]], which led to the surrender of that city on August 1762, 10 Spanish [[ships-of-the-line]], three [[frigates]] and a number of smaller vessels were captured, together with large quantities of military equipment, cash and merchandise. Prize money payments of \u00a3122,697 each were made to the naval commander, Vice-Admiral Sir [[George Pocock]], and the military commander, [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle]], with \u00a324,539 paid to [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel| Commodore Keppel]], the naval second-in-command who was Albemarle's younger brother. Each of the 42 naval captains present received \u00a31,600 as prize money.<ref name = \"Rodger, 247-248\"> Rodger (1986) 257-258</ref>\n\nThe prize money from [[Action of 16 October 1799|the capture of the Spanish frigates ''Thetis'' and ''Santa Brigada'']] in October 1799, \u00a3652,000, was split up among the crews of four British frigates, with each captain being awarded \u00a340,730 and the Seamen each receiving \u00a3182 4s 9\u00bed or the equivalent of 10 years' pay.<ref name = \"Rodger, 524\"> Rodger (2005) 524</ref>\n\n==[[United Kingdom]] from 1801==\nAfter the [[Act of Union 1801]] between Great Britain and Ireland, the former prize money rules of Great Britain applied to the United Kingdom. The [[Treaty of Amiens]] of March 1802 ended the hostilities of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and those of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] commenced in May 1803, when the United Kingdom declared war in France.\n \nPrize Acts at the start of war with France and Spain repeated the provisions of the 1793 Act, which in turn largely repeated those of 1708.<ref name = \"Wright 59\"> Wright 59</ref> The basis of distribution under these acts is detailed in the next section. However, a proclamation of 1812 soon after the start of the [[War of 1812]] made a further revision to the rules on allocation, such that the admiral and captain jointly received one-quarter of the prize money with one-third of this going to the admiral, a reduction from their previous entitlement. The Master and lieutenants received one-eighth of the prize money, as did the warrant officers. The crew below warrant officer rank now shared one-half of the prize money. However, this group was subdivided into several grades, from senior petty officers down to boys, with the higher grades gaining at the expense of the lower ones. <ref name = \"Hill, 204-205\"> Hill, 204-205</ref> The Prize Act of 1815, issued after [[Napoleon]]\u2019s return from Elba, largely repeated the allocation below the flag officers\u2019 share into eight grades and, although it lapsed in the same year, its provisions were re-enacted in 1854 at the start of the [[Crimean War]].<ref name = \"Wright 60-61\"> Wright 60-61</ref>\n\nThe multiplicity of prize money grades survived until 1918, with some refinements to include new ratings required for steamships. The Naval Agency and Distribution Act of 1864 was a permanent Act, rather than one enacted at the start of a particular conflict, stating that prize money was to be distributed according to a [[Royal Proclamation]] or [[Order in Council]] issued when appropriate.<ref name = \" Lushington 106-107, 109-111\"> Lushington, 106-107</ref> This act made no provision for privateers as the United Kingdom had signed the [[Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law| Declaration of Paris]], which outlawed privateering by the ships of signatory nations.<ref name = \"Parillo 62-63\"> Parillo (2007), 62-63</ref> The [[Royal Proclamation]] on the division of prize money dated 19 May 1866 provided for a single admiral to receive, or several admiral to share, one-thirtieth of the prize money pool; a single captain or commanding officer to receive, or several share, one-tenth of the pool, and the residue to be allocated to officers and ratings in 10 classes in specified shares.<ref name = \" Lushington 109-111\"> Lushington, 109-111</ref>\n\nThe Prize Courts Acts of 1894 provided that regulations for setting up of Prize Courts and on prize money should in future be initiated at the start of any war only by an [[Order in Council]] and not by Royal Proclamation. The Naval Prize Act 1918 changed the system to one where the prize money was no longer paid to the crews of individual ships, but into a common fund from which a payment was made to all naval personnel. The Act also stated that no distribution until after the end of the war. The award of prize money in the two World Wars were governed by this legislation, which was further modified in 1945 to allow for the distribution to be made to [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) personnel who had been involved in the capture of enemy ships. The Prize Act, 1948 abolished the Crown prerogative of granting prize money or any money arising from Droits of the Crown in wartime. <ref name = \" O\u2019Hare 116-117\"> O\u2019Hare 116-117</ref>\n\nFor more on the Prize Court during [[World War I]], ''see also'' [[Maxwell Hendry Maxwell-Anderson]].\n\n===Anti-slavery===\nAfter the British abolition of the slave trade in 1807, an additional source of prize money arose when Royal Navy ships of the [[West Africa Squadron]] captured slave ships. Under an Order in Council of 1808, the government paid 60 [[Pound sterling| pounds]] for each male slave freed, 30 pounds for each woman and 10 pounds for each child aged under 14. This was paid in lieu of any prize money for the captured slave ship, which became the property of the British government, and it was allocated in the same proportions as other prize money. Between 1807 and 1811, 1,991 slaves were freed through the Vice-Admiralty Court of [[Sierra Leone]], and between 1807 and mid-1815, [[HM Treasury]] paid Royal Navy personnel 191,100 pounds in prize money for slaves freed in West Africa. Condemned slave ships were usually auctioned at Freetown and re-registered as British ships.<ref name = \"Allen, 213\"> Allen, 213</ref><ref name = \"Helfman, 1143-1144\"> Helfman, 1143-1144</ref> However, in 1825, the bounty for all slaves was reduced to a flat rate of 10 pounds, and it was further reduced to 5 pounds for each live slave in 1830. The decline in captures prompted an increase in prize money in 1839 to 5 pounds for each slave landed alive, half that sum for slaves that had died and one pound and ten [[Shilling (British coin)| shillings]] for each ton of the captured vessel\u2019s [[tonnage]].<ref name = \"Lloyd, 79-81\"> Lloyd 79-81</ref>. \n\n===Distribution===\n[[File:Warrantchart.png|thumb|Command structure of a Navy ship c. 1810, showing prize money groupings]]\nThe following scheme for distribution of prize money was used for much of the [[Napoleonic wars]] until 1812, the heyday of prize warfare. Allocation was by eighths. Two eighths of the prize money went to the [[Captain (naval)|captain]] or commander, generally propelling him upwards in political and financial circles. One eighth of the money went to the [[admiral]] or commander-in-chief who signed the ship's written orders (unless the orders came directly from the [[Admiralty]] in London, in which case this eighth also went to the captain). One eighth was divided among the [[lieutenant]]s, [[sailing master]], and [[Captain (land)|captain of marines]], if any. One eighth was divided among the  wardroom warrant officers ([[Ship's doctor|surgeon]], [[purser]], and [[chaplain]]), standing warrant officers ([[carpenter]], [[boatswain]], and [[Gunner (rank)|gunner]]), [[lieutenant|lieutenant of marines]], and the [[master's mate]]s.  One eighth was divided among the junior warrant and petty officers, their mates, sergeants of marines, [[captain's clerk]], [[surgeon's mate]]s, and [[midshipman|midshipmen]]. The final two eighths were divided among the crew, with able and specialist seamen receiving larger shares than ordinary seamen, landsmen, and boys.<ref name=\"lavery135136\">*{{cite book|last=Lavery|first=Brian|title=Nelson's Navy: The Ships, Men and Organization|year=1989|location=Annapolis, MD |publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=0-87021-258-3|oclc=20997619|url=https://archive.org/details/nelsonsnavyships00lave|url-access=registration|quote=Nelson's Navy Lavery.|accessdate=2009-05-19|pages=[https://archive.org/details/nelsonsnavyships00lave/page/135 135]\u2013136}}</ref><ref name = \"Rodger, 522\u2013524\">Rodger (205) 522\u2013524</ref> The pool for the seamen was divided into shares, with each able seaman getting two shares in the pool (referred to as a fifth-class share), an ordinary seaman received a share and a half (referred to as a sixth-class share), landsmen received a share each (a seventh-class share), and boys received a half share each (referred to as an eighth-class share).\n\nA notable prize award related to a capture in January 1807, when the frigate ''Caroline'' took the Spanish ship ''San Rafael'' as a prize, netting Captain Peter Rainier \u00a352,000.<ref name=hms />\n\n===Operational difficulties===\nFor much of the 18th century and until 1815, the main complaints about prize money concerned delays in its payment and practices that deprived ordinary seamen of much of what was due to them. Although the incidence of captains selling captured ships abroad and defrauding crews of prize money reduced greatly in the course of the century, payment was often by way of a promissory note, or ''ticket'' to be paid when the relevant naval department had funds. Although officers could generally afford to wait for payment, which was often made only in London and sometimes in instalments that might stretch over several years, most seamen sold their promissory notes at a large discount.<ref name = \"Bromley 474-476\"> Bromley 474-476</ref> Other seamen authorised another individual to collect their prize money, who did not always passed it on, or lost out when they transferred to a new ship, if their prize money were not forwarded. A final issue of contention was that the value of prizes assessed in overseas Vice-Admiralty courts could be reassessed in the Admiralty Court in Britain if the Admiralty appealed the initial valuation. Excessive valuations in Vice-Admiralty courts, particularly in the West Indies, arose because the courts charged fees based on the prizes' values.<ref name = \"Rodger, 317-318\"> Rodger (1986) 317-318</ref>This led to delays and possible reduced payments.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 65-66\"> Malcomson, 65-66</ref> \n\nTo some extent, delays arose from the time taken by Vice-Admiralty courts adjudicating whether captured ships were legitimate prizes and, if they were, their value. In the [[War of 1812]], the Vice-Admiralty courts at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Bermuda]] had to deal with many, often small, American ships captured both by privateers and naval vessels, leading to lengthy legal delays in adjudication. Once an adjudication was made, providing there was no appeal, the funds from the sale of a captured ship or its goods should have been available for payment within two years, but the whole process from capture to payment might take three years or more. <ref name = \"Malcomson, 63-64\"> Malcomson, 63-64</ref> \n\nUnder the so-called ''joint capture''rules, which did not apply to privateers, any Royal Navy ship present when a capture took place was entitled to share in the prize money. However, this rule led to disputes where, for example, three claimant ships had been pursuing the captured ship but were out of sight when another captured it, or where a squadron commander claimed a share in a prize captured by his subordinate in disobedience to that commander\u2019s orders. In order to minimise disputes, some captains and crews of ships on the same mission made time-limited agreements to share prize money.<ref name = \"Malcomson, 64-65\"> Malcomson, 64-65</ref> In the case of privateers, for one to claim a share of prize money, it had to give actual assistance to the ship making the capture unless there were a prior agreement between privateers to share prizes.<ref name = \"Van Niekerk, 119\"> Van Niekerk 119</ref>\n\n==Scotland and Ireland==\n\n===Scotland=== \nThe [[Kingdom of Scotland]] had its own [[Lord High Admiral of Scotland| Lord High Admiral]] from mediaeval times until 1707, except for the period 1652 to 1661. His jurisdiction over Scottish ships, waters and coasts, exercised through a High Court of Admiralty, was similar to that of his English equivalent.<ref name = \"Murdoch, 10, 237\"> Murdoch 10 237</ref> In 1652, the [[Royal Scots Navy| Scottish fleet]] that was absorbed into the Commonwealth fleet and, although a separate Scottish Admiralty was re-established in 1661, it had no warships designed as such until three relatively small ones were commissioned in 1696.<ref name = \"Murdoch, 230, 236\"> Murdoch 230 236</ref>\n\nHowever, as Scotland was involved in the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War|Second]] (1665\u201367) and [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]]s (1672\u201374) against the Dutch and their allies, the Scottish Admiralty commissioned a significant number of privateers after 1665 by issuing  [[Letters of marque]]. <ref name = \"Murdoch, 27, 238-240\"> Murdoch 27, 238-240</ref> At least 80 privateers operating from Scottish ports in these two wars have been identified, and contemporaries estimated as many as 120 may have operated against Dutch and Danish merchant ships, including some English ships operating under Scottish commissions.<ref name = \"Murdoch, 240-241\"> Murdoch 240-241</ref> Apart from ships of the [[Dutch East India Company]], many Dutch merchant ships and of its Danish ally were poorly armed and undermanned.

The [[Lieutenant-Admiral]] of an admiralty generally received four times as much as the captain responsible for a capture, and the [[Vice-Admiral]] twice as much: in both cases, these flag-officers shared in all ships and goods taken by captains in their admiralties, even when not present at the capture.<ref name = \" Bruijn, 44, 104\"> Bruijn(2011) 44, 104</ref> In 1640, [[Maarten Tromp]], a Lieutenant-Admiral was owed 13,800 [[guilders]], mostly his share of prize money from the [[Battle of the Downs]] the previous year. \n\nBoth captains and flag officers in the Dutch fleet sometimes put the pursuit of prize money before discipline. In the [[Four Days' Battle]] of June 1666, several Dutch ships left the fleet either towing English ships they had captured or in pursuit of prizes, <ref name = \"Fox 212, 218\"> Fox 212, 218</ref> and [[Cornelis Tromp]] was extremely reluctant to burn {{HMS|Prince Royal|1610|6}} after it had run aground and been damaged, despite the orders of his commander, [[Michiel de Ruyter]]. Tromp attempted to claim compensation for its loss for many years. <ref name = \"Fox 240\"> Fox 240</ref> For ordinary seamen, prize money was rare, the amounts small and payment was often delayed.<ref name = \" Bruijn, 46\"> Bruijn(2011) 46</ref> In many cases, prize money was paid in installments over several years and crew members frequently sold advance notes for the later instalments at far below their face value, especially in the 18th century, when several of the Admiralties were in financial difficulties.<ref name = \" Bruijn, 119-120\"> Bruijn(2011) 119-120</ref> \n\nPrivateering was already established when the Dutch Republic broke away from Spain: it quickly developed in the late 16th century and expended further in the 17th century.<ref name = \"Lunsford, 118, 182\"> Lunsford 118, 182</ref>. In many cases, Dutch privateers attempted to evade the prize rules, by attacking neutral or even Dutch ships, failing to bring captures or their cargoes for adjudication and removing and selling cargoes to avoid paying duties.<ref name = \"Lunsford, 155-156\"> Lunsford, 155-156</ref> Privateers licenced by the two Dutch India companies were aggressive in attacking what they termed ''interlopers'' in their areas of operations, regardless of nationality, and both companies were active in privateering in the three Anglo-Dutch wars. .<ref name = \"Lunsford, 183-184\"> Lunsford 183-184</ref> \n\nDuring the [[Eighty Years' War]], the main targets of Dutch privateers were Spanish and Portuguese ships, including those of the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. Privateers licenced by the West India Company were very active against ships trading with Brazil. <ref name = \"Klooster, 43-44\"> Klooster 43-44</ref> The privateers that had attacked Portuguese shipping had to cease doing so after the 1661 [[Treaty of The Hague]], but many quickly transferred their activities to attacking English shipping after 1665 during the Second and Third Anglo-Dutch wars. <ref name = \"Bruijn, 145\"> Bruijn (2011) 145</ref>. However, there was relatively little Dutch privateering after the end of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], a consequence of the general decline in Dutch maritime activity. <ref name = \"Bruijn, 56\"> Bruijn (2008) 56</ref>\n\n==United States==\n===To 1814===\nDuring the Revolutionary War period, the [[Continental Congress]] had no navy and relied heavily on privateers who had been authorised by one of the states to capture British ships. Admiralty Courts for the state that had authorised the privateer adjudicated on the ownership of captured vessels and their value. <ref name = \"Mask & Mac Mahon, 477, 480\"> Mask & Mac Mahon 477, 480</ref> The [[Continental Navy]], formed in 1775 was small and outmatched by the Royal Navy, whereas American privateers captured about 600 British merchant ships in the course of this conflict. <ref name = \"Mask & Mac Mahon, 487\"> Mask & Mac Mahon 487</ref>  In 1787, the US Constitution transferred the right to grant [[Letters of Marque]] from the states to Congress. <ref name = \"Parrillo, 3\"> Parrillo (2007) 3</ref>  \n\nAt the start of the [[War of 1812]], the few larger US Navy ships were laid-up, while the Royal Navy had relatively few resources available in the western Atlantic, leaning the field free for privateers on both sides.<ref name = \"Kert, 7-8\"> Kert 7-8</ref> However, once the US Navy frigates were brought back into commission, they achieved some spectacular successes against weaker British frigates, with [[Stephen Decatur]] and [[John Rodgers (1772-1838)| John Rodgers]] both receiving over 10,000 dollars in prize money.<ref name = \"Kert, 114\"> Kert 114</ref> However, later in the war, the Royal Navy succeeded in blockading the US [[Eastern seaboard]] and capturing several US Navy vessels and a number of merchant ships, and also stifling American privateer activity, although single US Navy warships managed to avoid the blockade and attack British shipping in the [[Caribbean]] and off South America.<ref name = \"Kert, 115-116\"> Kert 116-116</ref> \n\nFrom the inception of its navy, the United States government granted naval personnel additional payments of two kinds, prize money, being a share in the proceeds from captured enemy merchant vessels and their cargo, and head money, a cash reward from the US Treasury for sinking enemy warships. From 1791, US Navy personnel received half the proceeds of a prize of equal or inferior force, and all the proceeds of a vessel of superior force. Privateers, in contrast, received all the proceeds of any prize, but had to pay duties that rose to 40% during the War of 1812, although they were lower at other times. Generally, half of the net amount went to the owners of the privateer, half to the crew.<ref name = \"Parillo 24\"> Parillo (2007), 24</ref> From 1800, US Navy ships that sunk an armed enemy ship received a bounty of twenty dollars for each enemy crew member at the start of the action, divided among the crew of that ship in the same proportions as other prize money.<ref name = \"Parillo 25\"> Parillo (2007), 25</ref>\n\n===Distribution===\nUnder United States legislation of 1800, whether the officers and men of the navy ship or ships responsible for the capturing a prize were entitled to half of the assessed value of the prize, or the whole value in the case of a capture of superior force, the prize money fund was to be allocated in specified proportions. The captain or captains of vessels taking prizes were entitled to 10% of the prize money fund, and the commander of the squadron to 5% of the fund. In the event that the captain was operating independently, he received 15% of the prize fund. Naval lieutenants, captains of marines and sailing Masters were to share 10%, increased to approximately 12% if there were no lieutenants of marines. Chaplains, lieutenants of marines, surgeons, pursers, boatswains, gunners, carpenters, and master\u2019s mates shared 10% of the prize fund, reduced to approximately 8% if there were no lieutenants of marines. Midshipman, junior warrant offices and the mates of senior warrant officers shared 17.5% and a range of petty officers a further 12.5%. This left 35% for the rest of the crew. Any unclaimed prize money was to be retained jointly by the Navy and Treasury secretaries to fund disability pensions and [[half-pay]].<ref name = \"Peters, 47-48, Articles V, VI, IX and X\"> Peters 47-48, Articles V, VI, IX and X</ref> \n \n===From 1815===\nFor most of the period between the end of the War of 1812 and the start of the [[American Civil War]], there was little opportunity to gain prize money. After the outbreak of the Civil War, the [[Confederate States of America| Confederate States]] granted some 30 commissions or Letters of marque to privateers, which captured between 50 and 60 United States merchant ships. However, a declaration by [[Abraham Lincoln]] that [[Confederate privateer]]s would be treated as pirates and the closure of the ports of European colonies in the Caribbean as venues for the disposal of prize vessels and cargoes encoraged their owners to turn to [[Blockade runner| Blockade running]].<ref name = \"Peifer, 98-99\"> Peifer 98-99</ref> \n\nFrom 1861, US Navy ships engaged Confederate privateers and [[Blockade runner]]s: as the 1800 legislation only applied to enemies of the United States, which did not recognise the Confederate States, it was unclear if prize money would apply. However, a revised statute of 1864 stated that \"the provisions of this title shall apply to all captures made as prize by authority of the United States\", allowing prize money claims to be made.<ref name = \"Library of Congress, 315, Section 33\"> Library of Congress, 315, Section 33</ref> Over 11 million dollars of prize money was paid to US Navy personnel for captures in the [[American Civil War| Civil War]] period. It has been calculated that about one-third of prize money due was payable to officers under the prevailing rules, but that approximately half of the money actually paid went to officers, most probably because of the difficulty in tracing enlisted men when payments were delayed.<ref name = \"Parillo 66\"> Parillo (2013), 66</ref>\n\nIn 1856, the [[Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law| Declaration of Paris]] was signed: this outlawed privateering by the ships of the 55 nations that signed it. However, the United States did not Spain sign the declaration, in part because it considered that, if privateering were to be abolished, the capture of merchant ships by naval vessels should also cease. Despite this, the United States agreed to respect the declaration during the [[American Civil War]], although [[Abraham Lincoln| Lincoln's]] cabinet did discuss the use of privateers against British merchant shipping in the event Britain recognised the Confederacy.<ref name = \"Parillo 63\"> Parillo (2007) 63</ref> \n\nA number of changes were made to the allocation of prize money to US Navy personnel in the 19th century in the last being in 1864. This preserved the awards 5% of the prize fund to commanders of the squadron, which now also applied to fleet commanders of fleet and of 10% to captains under the immediate command of a flag officer or 15% for those operating independently. It added new awards of 2% for a commander of a division of a fleet under the orders of a fleet commander and 1% for a [[Captain of the fleet| fleet captain]] stationed on the flagship. The most significant change was that the residue of prize money after making these awards was to be divided amongst the remaining officers and men in proportion to their rates of pay. This law also increased the bounty or head money for destroying an enemy warship in action, or any other enemy ship that it was necessary to destroy was increased to 100 dollars for each enemy crew member at the start of the action on a ship of less or equal force, or 200 dollars for each crew member of an enemy ship of greater force, to be divided among the officers and men of the US ship in the same proportions as other prize money.<ref name = \"Library of Congress, 309-301, Sections 10 & 11\"> Library of Congress, 309-301, Sections 10 & 11</ref>\n\nThe small size of US Navy meant that privateering would be the main way it could attack enemy commerce. In the Civil War, Lincoln's cabinet had discussed the use of privateers against British merchant shipping in the event Britain recognised the Confederacy, Until the early 1880s, American naval opinion considered that privateering remained a viable option, although subsequent increases in the size of the US Navy changed this view.<ref name = \"Parillo 4, 10-11\"> Parillo (2007) 4 10-11</ref> \n\nIn the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] of 1898, neither the United States nor Spain issued commissions to privateers. However, the US Navy was granted what were to be last payments of prize money made by the US Treasury for that war. These were to sailors that took part in the battles of [[Battle of Manila Bay| Manila Bay]] and [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba| Santiago]] and divided prize funds of 244,400 dollars and 166,700 dollars respectively, based on the estimated numbers of Spanish sailors and the value of ships salvaged at Manilla.<ref name = \"Knauth, 70, 73\"> Knauth 70, 73</ref>\n\n===Abolition===\nDuring the Spanish American War in 1898, the US Navy was seen by much of the United States population as seeking to profit from prize money and head money to an unacceptable extent, even though the amounts of granted were relatively modest. All awards of prize money and head money to US Navy personnel were abolished by an overwhelming vote of Congress in March 1899, shortly after the Spanish-American War conclded.<ref name = \"Parillo, 47, 308-309\"> Parillo (2013) 47, 308-309</ref> \n\nIt is sometimes claimed that the US Navy last paid prize money in 1947.<ref>Nofi, Al (20 July 2008).

Although the Odenwald was not a warship, it was sailing under the United States flag and claiming to be registered there, and also carrying contraband, either of which rendered the ship liable to arrest although not condemnation as a prize. After the Odenwald was stopped, its crew tried to scuttle it and took to the lifeboats. However, a boarding party from the Omaha managed to prevent the Odenwald from sinking and sailed it first to [[Trinidad]], then to [[Puerto Rico]]. The United States was not at war with Germany at the time, and after the war, the Odenwald\u2019s owners claimed that its seizure was therefore illegal. The Admiralty Court in Puerto Rico, however, ruled in 1947 that the crew\u2019s attempt to scuttle the ship, and then abandon, it meant that the Omaha\u2019s boarding party and salvage party that jointly brought the Odenwald to port had salvage rights, worth approximately 3 million dollars. It also ruled explicitly that it was not a case of bounty or prize.<ref> Justia US Law.

However, between 1775 and 1815, revenues declined sharply, largely because the probability of seizing a prize ship fell dramatically, partly owing to the increasing numbers of naval vessels competing for captures. As outfitting and manning ships for commerce raiding was expensive, privateering became less financially attractive.<ref name = \"Hillmann & Gathmann, 732, 740, 746-748\"> Hillmann & Gathmann 732, 740, 746-748</ref> \n\nThe Declaration of Paris 1856, by outlawing privateering by ships of signatory nations, would have made it politically difficult for non-signatories, which included the United States to commission privateers in a future conflict,<ref name = \"Parillo 63\"> Parillo (2007) 63</ref> and the privateering using metal-hulled steamships presented the additional problems of maintaining complex engines, the need for frequent re-coaling and to repair more complex damage than that experienced by wooden-hulled sailing ships. In addition, after 1880, many maritime countries paid subsidies so that liners and other fast merchant vessels were built with a view to conversion into [[Armed merchantmen | Armed Merchant Cruisers]] under naval control in wartime, which replaced the need for privateers, and no privateers were commissioned after the American Civil War.<ref name = \"Coogan, 22\"> Coogan 22</ref><ref name = \"Parillo, 76-78\"> Parillo (2007) 76-78</ref> \n  \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite journal| first1= J.C.|last1= Appleby |first2=M. |last2=O'Dowd| title = The Irish Admiralty: Its Organisation and Development, c. 1570-1640| journal= Irish Historical Studies| year = 1985| volume=24|issue=96| pages=299-326}}\n* {{cite journal|first= D.

Wind<br>2.&nbsp;force from above<br>3. Effective direction of the current<br>4. Coriolis effect]]\n\nThe '''Ekman spiral''' is a structure of currents or winds near a horizontal boundary in which the flow direction rotates as one moves away from the boundary. It derives its name from the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[oceanography|oceanographer]] [[Vagn Walfrid Ekman]]. The deflection of surface currents was first noticed by the Norwegian oceanographer [[Fridtjof Nansen]] during the [[Nansen's Fram expedition|Fram expedition]] (1893\u20131896) and the effect was first physically explained by [[Vagn Walfrid Ekman]].<ref>Ekman, V. W. 1905. On the influence of the Earth's rotation on ocean currents. Arch. Math. Astron. Phys., 2, 1-52. [http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/gv219/classics.d/Ekman05.pdf]</ref>\n\n==Theory==\nThe effect is a consequence of the [[Coriolis effect]] which subjects  moving objects to an apparent force to the right of their direction of motion in the northern hemisphere (and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere). Thus, when a persistent wind blows over an extended area of the ocean surface in the northern hemisphere, it causes a surface current which accelerates in that direction, which then experiences a Coriolis force and acceleration to the right of the wind:  the current will turn gradually to the right as it gains speed.  As the flow is now somewhat right of the wind, the Coriolis force perpendicular to the flow's motion is now partly directed ''against'' the wind.  Eventually, the current will reach a top speed when the force of the wind, of the Coriolis effect, and the resistant drag of the subsurface water balance, and the current will flow at a constant speed and direction as long as the wind persists.  This surface current drags on the water layer below it, applying a force in its own direction of motion to that layer, repeating the process whereby that layer eventually becomes a steady current even further to the right of the wind, and so on for deeper layers of water, resulting in a continuous rotation (or spiraling) of current direction with changing depth.  As depth increases, the force transmitted from the driving wind declines and thus the speed of the resultant steady current decreases, hence the tapered spiral representation in the accompanying diagram.  The depth to which the Ekman spiral penetrates is determined by how far turbulent mixing can penetrate over the course of a [[Foucault pendulum|pendulum day]].<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = AMS Glossary\n |url         = http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=pendulum-day1\n |accessdate  = 2007-06-28\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070817221735/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=pendulum-day1\n |archivedate = 2007-08-17\n}}</ref>\n\nThe diagram above attempts to show the forces associated with the Ekman spiral as applied to the Northern hemisphere.

Colwell]] of the [[James Baker Institute]], if cholera does begin to spread, government preparedness is crucial. A government's ability to contain the disease before it extends to other areas can prevent a high death toll and the development of an epidemic or even pandemic. Effective disease surveillance can ensure that cholera outbreaks are recognized as soon as possible and dealt with appropriately. Oftentimes, this will allow public health programs to determine and control the cause of the cases, whether it is unsanitary water or seafood that have accumulated a lot of ''Vibrio cholerae'' specimens.<ref name=\"bakerinstitute.org\" /> Having an effective surveillance program contributes to a government's ability to prevent cholera from spreading. In the year 2000 in the state of Kerala in India, the Kottayam district was determined to be \"Cholera-affected\"; this pronouncement led to task forces that concentrated on educating citizens with 13,670 information sessions about human health.<ref name=\"John, T.

On the other hand, researchers have shown that most of the citizens infected during the 1991 cholera outbreak in Bangladesh lived in rural areas, and were not recognized by the government's surveillance program. This inhibited physicians' abilities to detect cholera cases early.<ref name=\"pmid1500643\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Siddique AK, Zaman K, Baqui AH, Akram K, Mutsuddy P, Eusof A, Haider K, Islam S, Sack RB | title = Cholera epidemics in Bangladesh: 1985\u20131991 | journal = J.

The chloride and sodium ions create a salt-water environment in the small intestines, which through osmosis can pull up to six liters of water per day through the intestinal cells, creating the massive amounts of diarrhea. The host can become rapidly dehydrated unless an appropriate mixture of dilute salt water and sugar is taken to replace the blood's water and salts lost in the diarrhea.{{mcn|date=December 2013}}\n\nBy inserting separate, successive sections of ''V. cholerae'' DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which ''V. cholerae'' responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall. Researchers have discovered a complex cascade of regulatory proteins controls expression of ''V. cholerae'' [[virulence]] determinants.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}} In responding to the chemical environment at the intestinal wall, the ''V. cholerae'' bacteria produce the TcpP/TcpH proteins, which, together with the ToxR/ToxS proteins, activate the expression of the ToxT regulatory protein. ToxT then directly activates expression of [[virulence]] genes that produce the toxins, causing diarrhea in the infected person and allowing the bacteria to colonize the intestine.<ref name=\"DiRita\" /> Current{{when|date=August 2017}} research aims at discovering \"the signal that makes the cholera bacteria stop swimming and start to colonize (that is, adhere to the cells of) the small intestine.\"<ref name=\"DiRita\" />\n\n=== Genetic structure ===\n{{Main|Vibrio cholerae}}\n[[Amplified fragment length polymorphism]] [[DNA profiling|fingerprinting]] of the pandemic [[genetic isolate|isolates]] of ''V. cholerae'' has revealed variation in the genetic structure.

Furthermore, the researchers found the bacterium creates a hyperinfected state where [[gene]]s that control biosynthesis of [[amino acid]]s, [[iron]] uptake systems, and formation of periplasmic nitrate reductase complexes were induced just before defecation.

Colwell]] of the [[James Baker Institute]], if cholera does begin to spread, government preparedness is crucial. A government's ability to contain the disease before it extends to other areas can prevent a high death toll and the development of an epidemic or even pandemic. Effective disease surveillance can ensure that cholera outbreaks are recognized as soon as possible and dealt with appropriately. Oftentimes, this will allow public health programs to determine and control the cause of the cases, whether it is unsanitary water or seafood that have accumulated a lot of ''Vibrio cholerae'' specimens.<ref name=\"bakerinstitute.org\" /> Having an effective surveillance program contributes to a government's ability to prevent cholera from spreading. In the year 2000 in the state of Kerala in India, the Kottayam district was determined to be \"Cholera-affected\"; this pronouncement led to task forces that concentrated on educating citizens with 13,670 information sessions about human health.<ref name=\"John, T.

On the other hand, researchers have shown that most of the citizens infected during the 1991 cholera outbreak in Bangladesh lived in rural areas, and were not recognized by the government's surveillance program. This inhibited physicians' abilities to detect cholera cases early.<ref name=\"pmid1500643\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Siddique AK, Zaman K, Baqui AH, Akram K, Mutsuddy P, Eusof A, Haider K, Islam S, Sack RB | title = Cholera epidemics in Bangladesh: 1985\u20131991 | journal = J.

While the consensus among physicists is that [[gravity]] will attract both matter and antimatter at the same rate that matter attracts matter, there is a strong desire to confirm this experimentally- although simple algebra shows that the presence of two photons with positive energies following electron/positron annihilations observed frequently in nature is extremely strong evidence that antimatter has positive mass and thus would act like regular matter under gravity.\n\nAntimatter's rarity and tendency to [[annihilation|annihilate]] when brought into contact with matter makes its study a technically demanding task.  Furthermore, gravity is much weaker than the other [[fundamental interaction|fundamental force]]s, for reasons still of interest to physicists, complicating efforts to study gravity in systems small enough to be feasibly created in lab, including antimatter systems.\n\nMost methods for the creation of antimatter (specifically [[antihydrogen]]) result in high-energy particles and atoms of high kinetic energy, which are unsuitable for [[gravity]]-related study.

Future experiments need to be performed with higher precision, either with beams of antihydrogen (AEGIS) or with trapped antihydrogen (ALPHA or GBAR).\n\nIn addition to uncertainty regarding whether antimatter is gravitationally attracted or repulsed from other matter, it is also unknown whether the magnitude of the gravitational force is the same. Difficulties in creating [[quantum gravity]] models have led to the idea that antimatter may react with a slightly different magnitude.<ref name=\"nieto88\">{{cite news|last1=Nieto|first1=M.

Initial analysis focused on whether antimatter should react the same as matter or react oppositely. Several theoretical arguments arose which convinced physicists that antimatter would react exactly the same as normal matter. They inferred that a gravitational repulsion between matter and antimatter was implausible as it would violate [[CPT invariance]], [[conservation of energy]], result in [[vacuum instability]], and result in [[CP violation]]. It was also theorized that it would be inconsistent with the results of the [[Lor\u00e1nd E\u00f6tv\u00f6s|E\u00f6tv\u00f6s]] test of the [[weak equivalence principle]]. Many of these early theoretical objections were later overturned.<ref name=\"nieto91\">{{cite journal|last1=Nieto|first1=M.

A matter-antimatter gravitational repulsion is thus excluded from this point of view. Furthermore, [[photon]]s, which are their own antiparticles in the framework of the Standard Model, have in a large number of astronomical tests ([[gravitational redshift]] and [[gravitational lensing]], for example) been observed to interact with the gravitational field of ordinary matter exactly as predicted by the [[general theory of relativity]]. This is a feature that has to be explained by any theory predicting that matter and antimatter repel.\nThis is also the prediction Jean-Pierre Petit made in an article published in 2018: \"In addition, the [[Bimetric_gravity#Janus_cosmological_model | Janus model]] predicts that the antimatter that will be created in the laboratory in the Gbar experiment<ref>https://home.cern/fr/news/news/experiments/new-antimatter-gravity-experiments-begin-cern</ref> will behave like ordinary matter in the Earth's gravitational field.\"<ref name=\"A&SS 2018\">{{cite web|title=Constraints on Janus Cosmological model from recent observations of supernovae type Ia|url=http://ayuba.fr/pdf/2018-AstrophysSpaceSci.pdf|last=D'Agostini|first=G.|last2=Petit|first2=J.-P.|journal=Astrophysics and Space Science|volume=363|pages=139<!--endif p.totales-->|format=PDF|date=June 2018|publication-date=|bibcode=2018Ap&SS.363..139D|doi=10.1007/s10509-018-3365-3}}</ref> The antigravitation described in the Janus model is produced by antimatter of 'negative' masses (the antimatter produced in laboratories or by cosmic rays has only positive masses), and is fully compliant with general relativity and Newtonian approximations.\n\n=== CPT theorem ===\nThe [[CPT theorem]] implies that the difference between the properties of a matter particle and those of its antimatter counterpart is ''completely'' described by C-inversion. Since this C-inversion does not affect gravitational mass, the CPT theorem predicts that the gravitational mass of antimatter is the same as that of ordinary matter.<ref name=\"cabbolet2010\">{{cite journal|last1=Cabbolet|first1=M.

However, when moving through a gravitational potential, the frequency and energy of light is shifted.

Repulsive gravity is then described by adding extra terms (''m''<sub>g</sub>''\u03a6''<sub>g</sub> and ''m''<sub>g</sub>''A''<sub>g</sub>) to the wave equation. The idea is that the wave function of a positron moving in the gravitational field of a matter particle evolves such that in time it becomes more probable to find the positron further away from the matter particle.\n\n===Santilli and Villata's theory===\nClassical theories of repulsive gravity have been published by [[Ruggero Santilli]] and [[Massimo Villata]].<ref name=\"Santilli\">{{cite journal|last1=Santilli|first1=R.M.|title=A classical isodual theory of antimatter and its prediction of antigravity|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics A|date=1999|volume=14|issue=14|pages=2205\u20132238|doi=10.1142/S0217751X99001111|bibcode = 1999IJMPA..14.2205S }}</ref><ref name=\"villata\">{{cite journal|last1=Villata|first1=M.|title=CPT symmetry and antimatter gravity in general relativity|journal=EPL|date=2011|volume=94|issue=2|pages=20001|doi=10.1209/0295-5075/94/20001|arxiv = 1103.4937 |bibcode = 2011EL.....9420001V }}</ref><ref name=\"villata13\">{{cite journal|last1=Villata|first1=M.|title=On the nature of dark energy: the lattice Universe|journal=Astrophysics and Space Science|date=2013|volume=345|issue=1|pages=1\u20139|doi=10.1007/s10509-013-1388-3|arxiv = 1302.3515 |bibcode = 2013Ap&SS.345....1V }}</ref><ref name=\"villata15\">{{cite journal|last1=Villata|first1=M.|title=The matter-antimatter interpretation of Kerr spacetime|journal=Annalen der Physik|date=2015|volume=527|issue=7\u20138|pages=507\u2013512|doi=10.1002/andp.201500154|arxiv = 1403.4820 |bibcode = 2015AnP...527..507V }}</ref> Both theories are extensions of [[General Relativity|general relativity]], and are experimentally indistinguishable.

It has to be taken that the ''observed'' trajectories of antiparticles are projections on ''our'' spacetime of the true trajectories in the inverted spacetime.

In 1987, three neutrino detectors around the world simultaneously observed a cascade of neutrinos emanating from a [[supernova]] in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]. Although the supernova happened about 164,000 [[light years]] away, both neutrinos and antineutrinos seem to have been detected virtually simultaneously.{{clarify|date=December 2013}} If both were actually observed, then any difference in the gravitational interaction would have to be very small. However, neutrino detectors cannot distinguish perfectly between neutrinos and antineutrinos.

Fairbank was never able to attempt the experiment with positrons.<ref name=\"nieto91\" />\n\nIt is difficult to directly observe gravitational forces at the particle level. For charged particles, the electromagnetic force overwhelms the much weaker gravitational interaction. Even antiparticles in neutral antimatter, such as antihydrogen, must be kept separate from their counterparts in the matter that forms the experimental equipment, which requires strong electromagnetic fields. These fields, e.g. in the form of atomic traps, exert forces on these antiparticles which easily overwhelm the gravitational force of Earth and nearby test masses. Since all production methods for antiparticles result in high-energy antimatter particles, the necessary cooling for observation of gravitational effects in a laboratory environment requires very elaborate experimental techniques and very careful control of the trapping fields.\n\n===Cold neutral antihydrogen experiments===\nSince 2010 the production of cold [[antihydrogen]] has become possible at the [[Antiproton Decelerator]] at [[CERN]]. Antihydrogen, which is electrically neutral, should make it possible to directly measure the gravitational attraction of antimatter particles to the matter Earth.  In 2013, experiments on antihydrogen atoms released from the ALPHA trap set direct, i.e. freefall, coarse limits on antimatter gravity.<ref name=\"amole et al\" /> These limits were coarse, with a relative precision of \u00b1100%, thus, far from a clear statement even for the sign of gravity acting on antimatter.

It has been suggested that a material capable of holding a proton/antiproton pair in the same way might be more useful as protons are substantially more massive than electrons and any gravitational effects would be magnified by several orders of magnitude up to a point where detection is trivial using even an accelerometer.\nAlso an antimatter catalyzed fusion reactor would be massively simplified if positronium were produced and stored at a separate location.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fifth force]]\n*[[Dark energy]]\n*[[Dark matter]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{Theories of gravitation}}\n\n[[Category:Antimatter]]\n[[Category:Gravity]]\n[[Category:Anti-gravity]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{Short description|Theory of gravity on antimatter}}\nThe '''gravitational interaction of antimatter''' with [[matter]] or [[antimatter]] has not been conclusively observed by physicists.  While the consensus among physicists is that [[gravity]] will attract both matter and antimatter at the same rate that matter attracts matter, there is a strong desire to confirm this experimentally- although simple algebra shows that the presence of two photons with positive energies following electron/positron annihilations observed frequently in nature is extremely strong evidence that antimatter has positive mass and thus would act like regular matter under gravity.\n\nAntimatter's rarity and tendency to [[annihilation|annihilate]] when brought into contact with matter makes its study a technically demanding task.

Difficulties in creating [[quantum gravity]] models have led to the idea that antimatter may react with a slightly different magnitude.<ref name=\"nieto88\">{{cite news|last1=Nieto|first1=M.

Initial analysis focused on whether antimatter should react the same as matter or react oppositely. Several theoretical arguments arose which convinced physicists that antimatter would react exactly the same as normal matter. They inferred that a gravitational repulsion between matter and antimatter was implausible as it would violate [[CPT invariance]], [[conservation of energy]], result in [[vacuum instability]], and result in [[CP violation]]. It was also theorized that it would be inconsistent with the results of the [[Lor\u00e1nd E\u00f6tv\u00f6s|E\u00f6tv\u00f6s]] test of the [[weak equivalence principle]]. Many of these early theoretical objections were later overturned.<ref name=\"nieto91\">{{cite journal|last1=Nieto|first1=M.

A matter-antimatter gravitational repulsion is thus excluded from this point of view. Furthermore, [[photon]]s, which are their own antiparticles in the framework of the Standard Model, have in a large number of astronomical tests ([[gravitational redshift]] and [[gravitational lensing]], for example) been observed to interact with the gravitational field of ordinary matter exactly as predicted by the [[general theory of relativity]]. This is a feature that has to be explained by any theory predicting that matter and antimatter repel.\nThis is also the prediction Jean-Pierre Petit made in an article published in 2018: \"In addition, the [[Bimetric_gravity#Janus_cosmological_model | Janus model]] predicts that the antimatter that will be created in the laboratory in the Gbar experiment<ref>https://home.cern/fr/news/news/experiments/new-antimatter-gravity-experiments-begin-cern</ref> will behave like ordinary matter in the Earth's gravitational field.\"<ref name=\"A&SS 2018\">{{cite web|title=Constraints on Janus Cosmological model from recent observations of supernovae type Ia|url=http://ayuba.fr/pdf/2018-AstrophysSpaceSci.pdf|last=D'Agostini|first=G.|last2=Petit|first2=J.-P.|journal=Astrophysics and Space Science|volume=363|pages=139<!--endif p.totales-->|format=PDF|date=June 2018|publication-date=|bibcode=2018Ap&SS.363..139D|doi=10.1007/s10509-018-3365-3}}</ref> The antigravitation described in the Janus model is produced by antimatter of 'negative' masses (the antimatter produced in laboratories or by cosmic rays has only positive masses), and is fully compliant with general relativity and Newtonian approximations.\n\n=== CPT theorem ===\nThe [[CPT theorem]] implies that the difference between the properties of a matter particle and those of its antimatter counterpart is ''completely'' described by C-inversion. Since this C-inversion does not affect gravitational mass, the CPT theorem predicts that the gravitational mass of antimatter is the same as that of ordinary matter.<ref name=\"cabbolet2010\">{{cite journal|last1=Cabbolet|first1=M.

However, when moving through a gravitational potential, the frequency and energy of light is shifted.

Thus far, three radically different theories have been published.\n\n===Kowitt's theory===\nThe first theory of repulsive gravity was a quantum theory published by [[Mark Kowitt]].<ref name=\"Kowitt\">{{cite journal|last1=Kowitt|first1=M.|title=Gravitational repulsion and Dirac antimatter|journal=International Journal of Theoretical Physics|date=1996|volume=35|issue=3|pages=605\u2013631|doi=10.1007/BF02082828|bibcode = 1996IJTP...35..605K }}</ref> In this modified Dirac theory, Kowitt postulated that the positron is not a hole in the sea of electrons-with-negative-energy as in usual [[Dirac hole theory]], but instead is a hole in the sea of electrons-with-negative-energy-and-positive-gravitational-mass: this yields a modified C-inversion, by which the positron has positive energy but negative gravitational mass. Repulsive gravity is then described by adding extra terms (''m''<sub>g</sub>''\u03a6''<sub>g</sub> and ''m''<sub>g</sub>''A''<sub>g</sub>) to the wave equation. The idea is that the wave function of a positron moving in the gravitational field of a matter particle evolves such that in time it becomes more probable to find the positron further away from the matter particle.\n\n===Santilli and Villata's theory===\nClassical theories of repulsive gravity have been published by [[Ruggero Santilli]] and [[Massimo Villata]].<ref name=\"Santilli\">{{cite journal|last1=Santilli|first1=R.M.|title=A classical isodual theory of antimatter and its prediction of antigravity|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics A|date=1999|volume=14|issue=14|pages=2205\u20132238|doi=10.1142/S0217751X99001111|bibcode = 1999IJMPA..14.2205S }}</ref><ref name=\"villata\">{{cite journal|last1=Villata|first1=M.|title=CPT symmetry and antimatter gravity in general relativity|journal=EPL|date=2011|volume=94|issue=2|pages=20001|doi=10.1209/0295-5075/94/20001|arxiv = 1103.4937 |bibcode = 2011EL.....9420001V }}</ref><ref name=\"villata13\">{{cite journal|last1=Villata|first1=M.|title=On the nature of dark energy: the lattice Universe|journal=Astrophysics and Space Science|date=2013|volume=345|issue=1|pages=1\u20139|doi=10.1007/s10509-013-1388-3|arxiv = 1302.3515 |bibcode = 2013Ap&SS.345....1V }}</ref><ref name=\"villata15\">{{cite journal|last1=Villata|first1=M.|title=The matter-antimatter interpretation of Kerr spacetime|journal=Annalen der Physik|date=2015|volume=527|issue=7\u20138|pages=507\u2013512|doi=10.1002/andp.201500154|arxiv = 1403.4820 |bibcode = 2015AnP...527..507V }}</ref> Both theories are extensions of [[General Relativity|general relativity]], and are experimentally indistinguishable. The general idea remains that gravity is the deflection of a continuous particle trajectory due to the curvature of spacetime, but antiparticles now 'live' in an inverted spacetime. The equation of motion for antiparticles is then obtained from the equation of motion of ordinary particles by applying the C, P, and T-operators (Villata) or by applying ''isodual maps'' (Santilli), which amounts to the same thing: the equation of motion for antiparticles then predicts a repulsion of matter and antimatter. It has to be taken that the ''observed'' trajectories of antiparticles are projections on ''our'' spacetime of the true trajectories in the inverted spacetime.

In 1987, three neutrino detectors around the world simultaneously observed a cascade of neutrinos emanating from a [[supernova]] in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]. Although the supernova happened about 164,000 [[light years]] away, both neutrinos and antineutrinos seem to have been detected virtually simultaneously.{{clarify|date=December 2013}} If both were actually observed, then any difference in the gravitational interaction would have to be very small. However, neutrino detectors cannot distinguish perfectly between neutrinos and antineutrinos.

Fairbank was never able to attempt the experiment with positrons.<ref name=\"nieto91\" />\n\nIt is difficult to directly observe gravitational forces at the particle level. For charged particles, the electromagnetic force overwhelms the much weaker gravitational interaction. Even antiparticles in neutral antimatter, such as antihydrogen, must be kept separate from their counterparts in the matter that forms the experimental equipment, which requires strong electromagnetic fields. These fields, e.g. in the form of atomic traps, exert forces on these antiparticles which easily overwhelm the gravitational force of Earth and nearby test masses. Since all production methods for antiparticles result in high-energy antimatter particles, the necessary cooling for observation of gravitational effects in a laboratory environment requires very elaborate experimental techniques and very careful control of the trapping fields.\n\n===Cold neutral antihydrogen experiments===\nSince 2010 the production of cold [[antihydrogen]] has become possible at the [[Antiproton Decelerator]] at [[CERN]]. Antihydrogen, which is electrically neutral, should make it possible to directly measure the gravitational attraction of antimatter particles to the matter Earth.  In 2013, experiments on antihydrogen atoms released from the ALPHA trap set direct, i.e. freefall, coarse limits on antimatter gravity.<ref name=\"amole et al\" /> These limits were coarse, with a relative precision of \u00b1100%, thus, far from a clear statement even for the sign of gravity acting on antimatter.

Some Taifals allied with the Huns as early as 378, and some were later still allied with them at the [[Battle of Ch\u00e2lons]] (451). However, the [[Battle of Adrianople|victory of Adrianople]] in 378 meant that those Taifals who remained with the Visigoths fought against their cousins at Ch\u00e2lons. In 412, the Taifals entered [[Aquitaine]] in the train of the Visigoths.\n\nThe Taifals were often teamed with the Sarmatians and the ''Citrati iuniores'' by the Romans and subsequently by [[Clovis I]]. According to the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'' of the early fifth century, there was a unit called the Equites Taifali established by [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] under the ''[[comes Britanniarum]]'' in [[Britannia]].<ref>Wolfram, 478 n562.</ref> Possibly this unit may have been sent to the island by [[Stilicho]] in 399, and they may have been the same unit as the Equites Honoriani seniores mentioned around the same time. Thus, the Equites Honoriani Taifali seniores served in Britain while the Equites Honoriani Taifali iuniores served in Gaul under the ''[[magister Equitum]]''. The Taifali iuniores used the dragon-and-pearl device on their shields.<ref>Nickel, 139.</ref> The Equites Taifali seniores had mirrored bears holding the shield boss, as illustrated in the ''Notitia Dignitatum''. The ''Notitia'' also lists a unit called the ''Comites Taifali'' in the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Empire]], which was probably formed in the reign of [[Theodosius I]].<ref>Nischer, 51.</ref>\n\nThe village of [[Tealby]] (originally ''Tavelesbi'', ''Tauelesbi'' or ''Teflesbi'') in the former [[kingdom of Lindsey]] may preserve the name of some Taifali who remained in Britain after the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman withdrawal in 410]]. If so, it suggests the unattested [[Old English]] tribal name *''T\u0101flas'' or *''T\u01e3flas''.<ref>Green, ''passim''.</ref>\n\n==Presence in Merovingian Gaul==\nAlso according to the ''Notitia'', there was a ''praefectus Sarmatarum et Taifalorum gentilium, Pictavis in Galia'', that is, a Sarmatian and Taifal [[prefect]] in [[Poitiers]] in [[Gaul]].<ref>Bachrach, ''Merovingian'', 12 n30.</ref> The region of Poitou was even called ''Thifalia'', ''Theiphalia'' or ''Theofalgicus pagus'' (all meaning \"Taifal country\") in the sixth century. The Taifals were instrumental in defeating the Visigothic cavalry hand to hand at the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]] in 507.<ref>Bachrach, ''Merovingian'', 17.</ref>\n\nUnder the Merovingians, Theiphalia had its own ''[[dux]]'' ([[duke]]).<ref>Bachrach, ''Merovingian'', 29 and 38.</ref> It is possible that the Taifal ''laeti'' who had served the Romans also served as garrisons for the Franks, but this is not referred to in primary records.<ref>Dalton, I, 226, who calls them ''foederati''.</ref> The ''laeti'' were formally integrated into the Merovingian military establishment under [[Childebert I]].<ref>Dalton, I, 44.</ref> [[Gregory of Tours]], the principal source for the Taifals in the sixth century, says that a certain Frankish ''dux'' named [[Austrapius]] \"oppressed\" the Taifals (probably in the vicinity of [[Tiffauges]]); they revolted and killed him.<ref>Gregory, IV.18.</ref> The last mention of the Taifals as a distinct ''gens'' dates from year 565,<ref>In Gregory, Wolfram, 238. Gregory's generally friendly attitude towards the Taifals attests to their orthodoxy and to their relative lack of Gothicisation considering their many years spent in Gothic alliances.</ref> but their Oltenic remnants almost certainly took part in the [[Lombards|Lombard]] migration and invasion of Italy in 568.<ref>Musset, 88.</ref>\n\nThe most famous Taifal was [[Senoch|Saint Senoch]], who founded an abbey at the Roman ruins which are now called [[Saint-Senoch]].<ref>Gregory, V.7.</ref> The Taifal influence extended into the ninth century and their fortresses, like Tiffauges and [[Lusignan]], continued in use under the [[Carolingians]].<ref>Bachrach, ''Aquitaine'', 24.</ref> It has even been suggested that the Asiatic Taifals and Sarmatians influenced the [[Migration Period art|Germanic arts]].<ref>Dalton, I, 172 n7.</ref> They also left their mark in the municipal nomenclature of the region: asides from Tiffauges, mentioned above, [[Saint-Sulpice-les-Bois|Taphaleschat]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.fr/maps?hl=fr&num=30&q=Taphaleschat+Saint-Sulpice-les-Bois&ie=UTF8&split=0&gl=fr&ei=zoiaSv3dH5qsjAeN34m7BQ&ll=46.739861,4.350586&spn=15.511101,27.817383&t=h&z=5&iwloc=A|title=Google Maps|website=Google\u00a0Maps}}</ref> in [[Corr\u00e8ze]], [[Touffailles]] and [[Cazes-Mondenard|Touffaillou]] in Aquitaine, and [[Chauffailles]] (formerly ''Ta\u00effailia'') in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] owe their names to Taifal settlement. Perhaps the town of [[Tafalla]] in the [[Navarre]] owes its name to these people, but if so, it is unknown if the Taifals were established in [[Hispania]] (probably to subdue the [[Basques]]) by the Romans before 412 or by the Visigoths after that.

Some Taifals allied with the Huns as early as 378, and some were later still allied with them at the [[Battle of Ch\u00e2lons]] (451). However, the [[Battle of Adrianople|victory of Adrianople]] in 378 meant that those Taifals who remained with the Visigoths fought against their cousins at Ch\u00e2lons. In 412, the Taifals entered [[Aquitaine]] in the train of the Visigoths.\n\nThe Taifals were often teamed with the Sarmatians and the ''Citrati iuniores'' by the Romans and subsequently by [[Clovis I]]. According to the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'' of the early fifth century, there was a unit called the Equites Taifali established by [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] under the ''[[comes Britanniarum]]'' in [[Britannia]].<ref>Wolfram, 478 n562.</ref> Possibly this unit may have been sent to the island by [[Stilicho]] in 399, and they may have been the same unit as the Equites Honoriani seniores mentioned around the same time. Thus, the Equites Honoriani Taifali seniores served in Britain while the Equites Honoriani Taifali iuniores served in Gaul under the ''[[magister Equitum]]''. The Taifali iuniores used the dragon-and-pearl device on their shields.<ref>Nickel, 139.</ref> The Equites Taifali seniores had mirrored bears holding the shield boss, as illustrated in the ''Notitia Dignitatum''. The ''Notitia'' also lists a unit called the ''Comites Taifali'' in the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Empire]], which was probably formed in the reign of [[Theodosius I]].<ref>Nischer, 51.</ref>\n\nThe village of [[Tealby]] (originally ''Tavelesbi'', ''Tauelesbi'' or ''Teflesbi'') in the former [[kingdom of Lindsey]] may preserve the name of some Taifali who remained in Britain after the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman withdrawal in 410]]. If so, it suggests the unattested [[Old English]] tribal name *''T\u0101flas'' or *''T\u01e3flas''.<ref>Green, ''passim''.</ref>\n\n==Presence in Merovingian Gaul==\nAlso according to the ''Notitia'', there was a ''praefectus Sarmatarum et Taifalorum gentilium, Pictavis in Galia'', that is, a Sarmatian and Taifal [[prefect]] in [[Poitiers]] in [[Gaul]].<ref>Bachrach, ''Merovingian'', 12 n30.</ref> The region of Poitou was even called ''Thifalia'', ''Theiphalia'' or ''Theofalgicus pagus'' (all meaning \"Taifal country\") in the sixth century. The Taifals were instrumental in defeating the Visigothic cavalry hand to hand at the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]] in 507.<ref>Bachrach, ''Merovingian'', 17.</ref>\n\nUnder the Merovingians, Theiphalia had its own ''[[dux]]'' ([[duke]]).<ref>Bachrach, ''Merovingian'', 29 and 38.</ref> It is possible that the Taifal ''laeti'' who had served the Romans also served as garrisons for the Franks, but this is not referred to in primary records.<ref>Dalton, I, 226, who calls them ''foederati''.</ref> The ''laeti'' were formally integrated into the Merovingian military establishment under [[Childebert I]].<ref>Dalton, I, 44.</ref> [[Gregory of Tours]], the principal source for the Taifals in the sixth century, says that a certain Frankish ''dux'' named [[Austrapius]] \"oppressed\" the Taifals (probably in the vicinity of [[Tiffauges]]); they revolted and killed him.<ref>Gregory, IV.18.</ref> The last mention of the Taifals as a distinct ''gens'' dates from year 565,<ref>In Gregory, Wolfram, 238. Gregory's generally friendly attitude towards the Taifals attests to their orthodoxy and to their relative lack of Gothicisation considering their many years spent in Gothic alliances.</ref> but their Oltenic remnants almost certainly took part in the [[Lombards|Lombard]] migration and invasion of Italy in 568.<ref>Musset, 88.</ref>\n\nThe most famous Taifal was [[Senoch|Saint Senoch]], who founded an abbey at the Roman ruins which are now called [[Saint-Senoch]].<ref>Gregory, V.7.</ref> The Taifal influence extended into the ninth century and their fortresses, like Tiffauges and [[Lusignan]], continued in use under the [[Carolingians]].<ref>Bachrach, ''Aquitaine'', 24.</ref> It has even been suggested that the Asiatic Taifals and Sarmatians influenced the [[Migration Period art|Germanic arts]].<ref>Dalton, I, 172 n7.</ref> They also left their mark in the municipal nomenclature of the region: asides from Tiffauges, mentioned above, [[Saint-Sulpice-les-Bois|Taphaleschat]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.fr/maps?hl=fr&num=30&q=Taphaleschat+Saint-Sulpice-les-Bois&ie=UTF8&split=0&gl=fr&ei=zoiaSv3dH5qsjAeN34m7BQ&ll=46.739861,4.350586&spn=15.511101,27.817383&t=h&z=5&iwloc=A|title=Google Maps|website=Google\u00a0Maps}}</ref> in [[Corr\u00e8ze]], [[Touffailles]] and [[Cazes-Mondenard|Touffaillou]] in Aquitaine, and [[Chauffailles]] (formerly ''Ta\u00effailia'') in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] owe their names to Taifal settlement. Perhaps the town of [[Tafalla]] in the [[Navarre]] owes its name to these people, but if so, it is unknown if the Taifals were established in [[Hispania]] (probably to subdue the [[Basques]]) by the Romans before 412 or by the Visigoths after that. The town of [[Taivola]] in northern Italy was also a Taifal settlement.<ref>Wolfram, 92.</ref>\n\n==Sources==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*[[Bernard Bachrach|Bachrach, Bernard S.]] [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2853502 \"Procopius, Agathias and the Frankish Military.\"] ''[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]'', Vol. 45, No. 3.
