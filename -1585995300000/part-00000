He has also been [[Fidesz|President of Fidesz]], a [[National conservatism|national conservative]] political party, since 1993, with a brief break between 2000 and 2003.\n\nBorn in [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]], Orb\u00e1n studied law at [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University]], graduating in 1987. He briefly studied [[political science]] at [[Pembroke College, Oxford]], before returning to Hungary to enter politics in the wake of the [[Revolutions of 1989|Autumn of Nations]]. He became head of the reformist student movement the Alliance of Young Democrats (''Fiatal Demokrat\u00e1k Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9ge''), which would eventually become the Fidesz party. Orb\u00e1n became a nationally known politician after giving an address at the 1989 reburial of [[Imre Nagy]] and other [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|martyrs of the 1956 revolution]], in which he openly demanded that Soviet troops withdraw from the country.\n\nAfter the [[End of communism in Hungary (1989)|transition to democracy]] in 1990, he was elected to the [[National Assembly (Hungary)|National Assembly]] and served as the leader of Fidesz's parliamentary caucus until 1993. Under his leadership, Fidesz shifted away from its original [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]], [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]], [[European integration|pro-European integration]] platform toward more [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] national conservatism. After Fidesz won a plurality of seats in the [[1998 Hungarian parliamentary election|1998 election]], Orb\u00e1n was appointed Prime Minister for the first time.\n\nFidesz narrowly lost the [[2002 Hungarian parliamentary election|2002]] and [[2006 Hungarian parliamentary election|2006 elections]] to the [[Hungarian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], with Orb\u00e1n spending this period as [[Leader of the Opposition]]. The fall in popularity of the Socialists, exacerbated by Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny]]'s \"[[\u0150sz\u00f6d speech]]\", helped Orb\u00e1n lead Fidesz to a [[2010 Hungarian parliamentary election|landslide victory]] in 2010. Orb\u00e1n formed a coalition with the [[Christian Democratic People's Party (Hungary)|Christian Democrats]], giving him a supermajority in the National Assembly, which he used to introduce [[Constitution of Hungary#2013 amendments|major constitutional and legislative reforms]]. Fidesz retained its supermajority in the [[2014 Hungarian parliamentary election|2014]] and [[2018 Hungarian parliamentary election|2018 elections]]. In August 2018, Orb\u00e1n became the [[List of Prime Ministers of Hungary by tenure|second longest-serving Prime Minister]] after [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Tisza]].\n\nOrb\u00e1n's [[social conservatism]], national conservatism, [[Euroscepticism#Soft Euroscepticism|soft Euroscepticism]] and advocacy of what he describes as an \"[[Illiberal democracy|illiberal state]]\" have attracted significant international attention.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kormany.hu/en/the-prime-minister/the-prime-minister-s-speeches/prime-minister-viktor-orban-s-speech-at-the-25th-balvanyos-summer-free-university-and-student-camp|quote=And so in this sense the new state that we are constructing in Hungary is an illiberal state, a non-liberal state.

he was also Prime Minister from 1998 to 2002. He has also been [[Fidesz|President of Fidesz]], a [[National conservatism|national conservative]] political party, since 1993, with a brief break between 2000 and 2003.\n\nBorn in [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]], Orb\u00e1n studied law at [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University]], graduating in 1987. He briefly studied [[political science]] at [[Pembroke College, Oxford]], before returning to Hungary to enter politics in the wake of the [[Revolutions of 1989|Autumn of Nations]]. He became head of the reformist student movement the Alliance of Young Democrats (''Fiatal Demokrat\u00e1k Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9ge''), which would eventually become the Fidesz party. Orb\u00e1n became a nationally known politician after giving an address at the 1989 reburial of [[Imre Nagy]] and other [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|martyrs of the 1956 revolution]], in which he openly demanded that Soviet troops withdraw from the country.\n\nAfter the [[End of communism in Hungary (1989)|transition to democracy]] in 1990, he was elected to the [[National Assembly (Hungary)|National Assembly]] and served as the leader of Fidesz's parliamentary caucus until 1993. Under his leadership, Fidesz shifted away from its original [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]], [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]], [[European integration|pro-European integration]] platform toward more [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] national conservatism. After Fidesz won a plurality of seats in the [[1998 Hungarian parliamentary election|1998 election]], Orb\u00e1n was appointed Prime Minister for the first time.\n\nFidesz narrowly lost the [[2002 Hungarian parliamentary election|2002]] and [[2006 Hungarian parliamentary election|2006 elections]] to the [[Hungarian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], with Orb\u00e1n spending this period as [[Leader of the Opposition]]. The fall in popularity of the Socialists, exacerbated by Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny]]'s \"[[\u0150sz\u00f6d speech]]\", helped Orb\u00e1n lead Fidesz to a [[2010 Hungarian parliamentary election|landslide victory]] in 2010. Orb\u00e1n formed a coalition with the [[Christian Democratic People's Party (Hungary)|Christian Democrats]], giving him a supermajority in the National Assembly, which he used to introduce [[Constitution of Hungary#2013 amendments|major constitutional and legislative reforms]]. Fidesz retained its supermajority in the [[2014 Hungarian parliamentary election|2014]] and [[2018 Hungarian parliamentary election|2018 elections]]. In August 2018, Orb\u00e1n became the [[List of Prime Ministers of Hungary by tenure|second longest-serving Prime Minister]] after [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Tisza]].\n\nOrb\u00e1n's [[social conservatism]], national conservatism, [[Euroscepticism#Soft Euroscepticism|soft Euroscepticism]] and advocacy of what he describes as an \"[[Illiberal democracy|illiberal state]]\" have attracted significant international attention.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kormany.hu/en/the-prime-minister/the-prime-minister-s-speeches/prime-minister-viktor-orban-s-speech-at-the-25th-balvanyos-summer-free-university-and-student-camp|quote=And so in this sense the new state that we are constructing in Hungary is an illiberal state, a non-liberal state.

It has been described as a \"counterculture anthem, with its lyrics praising the footloose and fancy-free life\", which reflected Hendrix's restless lifestyle.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=90}} Instrumentally, the song has a strong rhythmic drive provided by drummer [[Mitch Mitchell]] with harmonic support by bassist [[Noel Redding]]. \"Stone Free\" was issued on December 16, 1966, as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of the Experience's first UK single \"[[Hey Joe]]\" and later included on the ''[[Smash Hits (The Jimi Hendrix Experience album)|Smash Hits]]'' compilation album.\n\nStone Free is also a stand in the manga Jojo Bizarre Adventure Stone Ocean. And its user as Jolyne Cujoh the daughter of Jotaro Kujo.\nIn April 1969, Hendrix recorded a revised rendition of the song for possible release as a single. However, it was not used and [[Reprise Records]] issued the original recording as a single in the U.S. on September 15, 1969. Hendrix often played \"Stone Free\" in concert using extended arrangements, sometimes lasting over fourteen minutes. The revised song and several live recordings were later released.\n\n==Recording and composition==\nWith the first Experience song, \"[[Hey Joe#Tim Rose and Jimi Hendrix (1966)|Hey Joe]]\", completed on October 23, 1966, the group needed a second number for their debut single.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=24}}  Hendrix suggested another cover song, but producer [[Chas Chandler]] encouraged him to come up with an original in order to receive song publishing royalties.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=24}}  Hendrix wrote \"Stone Free\", his first Experience composition on October 24 after a jam at a London club.{{sfn|Roby|2002|p=61}} (\"Look Over Yonder\", recorded by the Experience in 1968, began in 1966 as \"Mr. Bad Luck\", written and performed by Hendrix with his band [[Jimmy James and the Blue Flames]] in Greenwich Village, New York).{{sfn|McDermott|1997|p=3}}  The group rehearsed the song, with Chandler (formerly a bassist with [[the Animals]]) showing Redding, a guitarist who was new to the bass, some bass lines.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=25}}  \"Stone Free\" was recorded at [[De Lane Lea Studios]] in London on November 2, 1966.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=24}}  According to Chandler, it was completed in an hour.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=25}}  [[Overdubbing]] was minimal, consisting of a cowbell part by Mitchell and an additional guitar line and harmony vocals by Hendrix.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=25}}\n\nHendrix's vocal for \"Stone Free\" has been compared to that for \"Hey Joe\".  Biographer Keith Shadwick describes it as \"an almost conversational delivery&nbsp;... toying with [[Blues scale|blues intervals]] in a way that [[John Lee Hooker]] would build a blues phrase rather than delivering any defined melodic pattern.\"{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=90}}  The lyrics reflect Hendrix's lifestyle, as he explained in an interview: \"I stay one or two months in a place and then I must have a change&nbsp;... I just get so restless, man\u2014I might leave right away\":{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=90}}\n{{poemquote|Every day in the week I'm in a different city\nIf I stay too long the people try to pull me down\nThey talk about me like a dog, talkin' about the clothes I wear\nThey don't realize they're the ones who's square}}\nThe lyrics also express his feelings of resentment when he returned to [[Harlem]] after exploring the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] [[Greenwich Village]]:{{sfn|Roby|Schreiber|2010|p=152}}\n{{quote|I used to go to the [Harlem] clubs, and my hair was really long then.  Sometimes I'd tie it up or do something with it and the cats would say, 'Ah, look at that: Black Jesus.'  Even in your own section [of town].  I had friends with me in Harlem, 125th Street, and all of a sudden, cats, old ladies, girls, anybody would say, 'Ooh, look at that.  What is this, a circus or something?'{{sfn|Roby|Schreiber|2010|p=152}}}}\n\n\"Stone Free\" is an uptempo song which has a strong rhythmic element, due in large part to Mitchell's [[jazz]]-influenced drumming approach.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=90}}  Although he \"constantly underlines Hendrix's vocals and guitar parts in a dramatic fashion [with] fills and changes of rhythmic emphases\", Mitchell continues to \"stress the snare beat\"{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=90}} and adds [[quarter-note]]s on the cowbell.{{sfn|Hal Leonard|1998|p=77}}  Redding's bass line provides harmonic support similar to a rhythm guitar{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=90}} and has been compared to \"Philly Dog\", a [[Mar-Keys]] song.<ref>Although Roby identifies it as a [[Rufus Thomas]] (known for \"[[Walking the Dog]]\") song, \"Philly Dog\"  was recorded by the [[Mar Keys]]. Roby 2002, p. 61.</ref>  The verse section is a variation on a [[Chord progression#Blues changes|blues progression]], which uses the beginning eight bars of a [[twelve-bar blues]].{{sfn|Hal Leonard|1998|p=77}}  The song opens with Hendrix plucking [[guitar harmonic|harmonic notes]] and unlike most of his songs, he uses a [[standard tuning]] for the guitar.{{sfn|Hal Leonard|1998|p=77}}  Guitarist [[Jeff Beck]], who considers \"Stone Free\" his favorite Hendrix song,{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=124}} commented, \"It's got bits of [[Buddy Guy]]; it sounds like [[Les Paul]] in places.  Jimi does every trick in the book and nails it all together so tight that you can't even see the joints.\"{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=90}}\n\n==Releases==\n\"Stone Free\" was released as the [[B-side]] of \"Hey Joe\" on December 16, 1966.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=28}}  Although the group was signed to [[Track Records]] in the UK, the label was not fully operational, so the single appeared on [[Polydor Records]].{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=28}}  In order to ensure the single's success, Hendrix's manager, [[Michael Jeffery (manager)|Michael Jeffery]], signed over a portion of the publishing rights to \"Stone Free\" as an [[Payola|inducement]] for radio airplay (since \"Hey Joe\" was already published, it was unavailable for such an arrangement).{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|1992|p=31}}  Hendrix's publisher, Abby Schroeder, was reportedly \"livid\".{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|1992|p=31}} He recalled\n{{quote|Jeffery was so desperate for airplay that he allowed himself to be blackmailed.  He explained to me that this process had worked successfully once before and, to ensure heavy [[Pirate radio in the United Kingdom|pirate]] [radio] airplay, one had to give up a piece of the action.  I told him that splitting publishing copyrights wasn't like cutting up a pie.

It has been described as a \"counterculture anthem, with its lyrics praising the footloose and fancy-free life\", which reflected Hendrix's restless lifestyle.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=90}} Instrumentally, the song has a strong rhythmic drive provided by drummer [[Mitch Mitchell]] with harmonic support by bassist [[Noel Redding]]. \"Stone Free\" was issued on December 16, 1966, as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of the Experience's first UK single \"[[Hey Joe]]\" and later included on the ''[[Smash Hits (The Jimi Hendrix Experience album)|Smash Hits]]'' compilation album.\n\nIn April 1969, Hendrix recorded a revised rendition of the song for possible release as a single. However, it was not used and [[Reprise Records]] issued the original recording as a single in the U.S. on September 15, 1969. Hendrix often played \"Stone Free\" in concert using extended arrangements, sometimes lasting over fourteen minutes. The revised song and several live recordings were later released.\n\n==Recording and composition==\nWith the first Experience song, \"[[Hey Joe#Tim Rose and Jimi Hendrix (1966)|Hey Joe]]\", completed on October 23, 1966, the group needed a second number for their debut single.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=24}}  Hendrix suggested another cover song, but producer [[Chas Chandler]] encouraged him to come up with an original in order to receive song publishing royalties.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=24}}  Hendrix wrote \"Stone Free\", his first Experience composition on October 24 after a jam at a London club.{{sfn|Roby|2002|p=61}} (\"Look Over Yonder\", recorded by the Experience in 1968, began in 1966 as \"Mr. Bad Luck\", written and performed by Hendrix with his band [[Jimmy James and the Blue Flames]] in Greenwich Village, New York).{{sfn|McDermott|1997|p=3}}  The group rehearsed the song, with Chandler (formerly a bassist with [[the Animals]]) showing Redding, a guitarist who was new to the bass, some bass lines.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=25}}  \"Stone Free\" was recorded at [[De Lane Lea Studios]] in London on November 2, 1966.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=24}}  According to Chandler, it was completed in an hour.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=25}}  [[Overdubbing]] was minimal, consisting of a cowbell part by Mitchell and an additional guitar line and harmony vocals by Hendrix.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=25}}\n\nHendrix's vocal for \"Stone Free\" has been compared to that for \"Hey Joe\".  Biographer Keith Shadwick describes it as \"an almost conversational delivery&nbsp;... toying with [[Blues scale|blues intervals]] in a way that [[John Lee Hooker]] would build a blues phrase rather than delivering any defined melodic pattern.\"{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=90}}  The lyrics reflect Hendrix's lifestyle, as he explained in an interview: \"I stay one or two months in a place and then I must have a change&nbsp;... I just get so restless, man\u2014I might leave right away\":{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=90}}\n{{poemquote|Every day in the week I'm in a different city\nIf I stay too long the people try to pull me down\nThey talk about me like a dog, talkin' about the clothes I wear\nThey don't realize they're the ones who's square}}\nThe lyrics also express his feelings of resentment when he returned to [[Harlem]] after exploring the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] [[Greenwich Village]]:{{sfn|Roby|Schreiber|2010|p=152}}\n{{quote|I used to go to the [Harlem] clubs, and my hair was really long then.  Sometimes I'd tie it up or do something with it and the cats would say, 'Ah, look at that: Black Jesus.'  Even in your own section [of town].  I had friends with me in Harlem, 125th Street, and all of a sudden, cats, old ladies, girls, anybody would say, 'Ooh, look at that.  What is this, a circus or something?'{{sfn|Roby|Schreiber|2010|p=152}}}}\n\n\"Stone Free\" is an uptempo song which has a strong rhythmic element, due in large part to Mitchell's [[jazz]]-influenced drumming approach.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=90}}  Although he \"constantly underlines Hendrix's vocals and guitar parts in a dramatic fashion [with] fills and changes of rhythmic emphases\", Mitchell continues to \"stress the snare beat\"{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=90}} and adds [[quarter-note]]s on the cowbell.{{sfn|Hal Leonard|1998|p=77}}  Redding's bass line provides harmonic support similar to a rhythm guitar{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=90}} and has been compared to \"Philly Dog\", a [[Mar-Keys]] song.<ref>Although Roby identifies it as a [[Rufus Thomas]] (known for \"[[Walking the Dog]]\") song, \"Philly Dog\"  was recorded by the [[Mar Keys]]. Roby 2002, p. 61.</ref>  The verse section is a variation on a [[Chord progression#Blues changes|blues progression]], which uses the beginning eight bars of a [[twelve-bar blues]].{{sfn|Hal Leonard|1998|p=77}}  The song opens with Hendrix plucking [[guitar harmonic|harmonic notes]] and unlike most of his songs, he uses a [[standard tuning]] for the guitar.{{sfn|Hal Leonard|1998|p=77}}  Guitarist [[Jeff Beck]], who considers \"Stone Free\" his favorite Hendrix song,{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=124}} commented, \"It's got bits of [[Buddy Guy]]; it sounds like [[Les Paul]] in places.  Jimi does every trick in the book and nails it all together so tight that you can't even see the joints.\"{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=90}}\n\n==Releases==\n\"Stone Free\" was released as the [[B-side]] of \"Hey Joe\" on December 16, 1966.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=28}}  Although the group was signed to [[Track Records]] in the UK, the label was not fully operational, so the single appeared on [[Polydor Records]].{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=28}}  In order to ensure the single's success, Hendrix's manager, [[Michael Jeffery (manager)|Michael Jeffery]], signed over a portion of the publishing rights to \"Stone Free\" as an [[Payola|inducement]] for radio airplay (since \"Hey Joe\" was already published, it was unavailable for such an arrangement).{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|1992|p=31}}  Hendrix's publisher, Abby Schroeder, was reportedly \"livid\".{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|1992|p=31}} He recalled\n{{quote|Jeffery was so desperate for airplay that he allowed himself to be blackmailed.  He explained to me that this process had worked successfully once before and, to ensure heavy [[Pirate radio in the United Kingdom|pirate]] [radio] airplay, one had to give up a piece of the action.  I told him that splitting publishing copyrights wasn't like cutting up a pie.  There were other ways to get airplay without sacrificing your artist's work.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|1992|p=31}}}}  The single became a success and reached number six on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"OCC\">\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/jimi%20hendrix/\n| title = Jimi Hendrix singles\n| website = [[Official Charts Company]]\n| accessdate = June 30, 2014}}</ref>  It was later included on the Experience's first compilation album ''Smash Hits''.\n\nWhen \"Hey Joe\" was issued in the U.S., Reprise Records included \"51st Anniversary\" as the B-side.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=47}}  \"Stone Free\" was included on the American ''Smash Hits'' album, which was released on July 30, 1969.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=168}}  Almost two months later, it was released as the A-side of a single with \"[[If 6 Was 9]]\".

The current Leader of the Opposition is Sir [[Keir Starmer]], Leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], who was elected to the [[2020 Labour Party leadership election|leadership]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] on 4 April 2020.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-52164589 | title=Keir Starmer elected as new Labour leader | publisher=BBC | date=4 April 2020 | accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Leader of the Opposition is normally viewed as an alternative or shadow [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], and is appointed to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. They lead an [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet]] which scrutinises the actions of the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] led by the Prime Minister, as well as offer alternative policies.\n\nThere is also a Leader of the Opposition in the [[House of Lords]] (currently [[Angela Smith, Baroness Smith of Basildon|The Baroness Smith of Basildon]]). In the nineteenth century party affiliations were generally less fixed and leaders in the two Houses were often of equal status. A single, clear Leader of the Opposition was only definitively settled if the opposition leader in Commons or Lords was the outgoing prime minister. However, since the [[Parliament Act 1911]] there has been no dispute that the leader in the House of Commons is pre-eminent and has always held the main title.\n\nThe Leader of the Opposition is entitled to a salary in addition to their salary as a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]]. In 2010, this additional entitlement was available up to \u00a373,617.<ref name=\"salary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/m06.pdf|title=parliament.uk|date=May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430063450/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/M06.pdf |archivedate=30 April 2010|accessdate=8 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Leaders of the Opposition from 1807==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2014}}\nThe first modern Leader of the Opposition was [[Charles James Fox]], who led the Whigs as such for a generation, except during the [[Fox\u2013North Coalition]] in 1783. He finally rejoined the government in 1806, and died later that year.\n[[File:Charles James Fox by Karl Anton Hickel.jpg|thumb|220px|Charles James Fox, Leader of the Opposition 1783\u20131806]]\n\n===Early developments 1807\u201330===\nFor there to be a recognised Leader of the Opposition, it is necessary for there to be a sufficiently cohesive opposition to need a formal leader.  The emergence of the office thus coincided with the period when wholly united parties ([[Whig Party (UK)|Whig]] and [[Tory Party|Tory]], governments and oppositions) became the norm.<ref name=foord>''His Majesty's Opposition 1714\u20131830'', Archibald S. Foord, Oxford University Press (1964), 494 pages {{ISBN|0198213115}}.</ref> This situation was normalised in the Parliament of 1807\u20131812, when the members of the Grenvillite and Foxite Whig factions resolved to maintain a joint, dual-house leadership for the whole party.\n\nThe [[Ministry of all the Talents]], in which both Whig factions participated fell at the [[1807 United Kingdom general election|1807 general election]], during which the Whigs had re-adopted traditional factions, forming ''an'' opposition.  The prime minister of the Talents ministry, [[William Wyndham Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|Lord Grenville]] had led his eponymous faction from the [[House of Lords]].  Meanwhile, the government leader of the House of Commons, [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Viscount Howick]] (later known as Earl Grey and the political heir of [[Charles James Fox]] who had died in 1806), led his faction, the Foxite whigs, from the House of Commons.<ref name=foord/>\n\nHowick's father, [[Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey|the 1st Earl Grey]] died on 14 November 1807. As such the new Earl Grey vacated his seat in the House of Commons and moved to the House of Lords. This left no obvious Whig leader in the House of Commons.<ref name=foord/>\n\nGrenville's article in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' confirms that he was  considered the Whig leader in the House of Lords between 1807 and 1817, despite Grey leading the larger faction.\n\nGrenville and Grey, political historian Archibald Foord describes as being \"[[duumvirate|duumvirs]] of the party from 1807 to 1817\" and consulted about what was to be done. Grenville was at first reluctant to name a Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons, commenting \"... all the elections in the world would not have made Windham or Sheridan leaders of the old Opposition while Fox was alive ...\".\n\nEventually they jointly recommended [[George Ponsonby]] to the Whig MPs, whom they accepted as the first Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons. Ponsonby, an Irish lawyer who was the uncle of Grey's wife, had been [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]] during the Ministry of all the Talents and had only just been re-elected to the House of Commons in 1808 when he became leader.<ref name=foord/> Ponsonby proved a weak leader but as he could not be persuaded to resign and the duumvirs did not want to depose him, he remained in place until he died in 1817.<ref name=foord/>\n\nLord Grenville retired from active politics in 1817, leaving Grey as the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords. Grey was not a former prime minister in 1817, unlike Grenville, so under the convention that developed later in the century he would have been in theory of equal status to whoever was leader in the other House. However, there was little doubt that if a Whig ministry was possible, Grey rather than the less distinguished Commons leaders would have been invited to form that government. In this respect Grey's position was like that of the Earl of Derby in the Protectionist Conservative opposition of the late 1840s and early 1850s.<ref name=foord/>\n\nEarl Grey witnessed a delay of about a year, until 1818, before a new Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons was chosen. This was [[George Tierney]] who was reluctant to accept the leadership and had weak support from his party.  On 18 May 1819, Tierney moved a motion in the Commons for a committee on the state of the nation. This motion was defeated by 357 to 178, a division involving the largest number of MPs until the debates over the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform bill in the early 1830s]]. Foord comments that \"this defeat put an effective end to Tierney's leadership ... Tierney did not disclaim the leadership till 23 Jan. 1821 ..., but he had ceased to exercise its functions since the great defeat\".\n\nBetween 1821 and 1830 the Whig Commons leadership was left vacant. The leadership in the House of Lords was not much more effective: in 1824 Grey retired from active leadership, asking the party to follow the [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Marquess of Lansdowne]] \"as the person whom his friends were to look upon as their leader\". Lansdowne disclaimed the title of leader, although in practice he performed the function.\n\nFollowing the retirement of [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] from the prime ministership in 1827, the party political situation changed. Neither the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] or [[Robert Peel]] agreed to serve under [[George Canning]] and they were followed by five other members of the former Cabinet as well as forty junior members of the previous government. The Tory Party was heavily split between the \"High Tories\" (or \"Ultras\", nicknamed after [[Ultra-royalist|the contemporary party]] in France) and the moderates supporting Canning, often called '[[Canningites]]'. As a result, Canning found it difficult to maintain a government and chose to invite a number of Whigs to join his Cabinet, including [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]]. After Canning's death, [[Frederick Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich|Lord Goderich]] continued the coalition for a few more months.The principal opposition between April 1827 and January 1828 worked with these brief administrations, although Earl Grey and a section of the Whigs were also in opposition to the coalition government.  It was during this period that the term \"His Majesty's Opposition\" for the Opposition was coined, by [[John Cam Hobhouse]].<ref>''His Majesty's Opposition 1714\u20131830'', Archibald S. Foord, Greenwood Press, 1979, 494 pages, page 1.</ref>\n\nThe Duke of Wellington formed a ministry in January 1828 and as a direct effect of adopting in earnest the policy of [[Catholic Emancipation]] the opposition became composed of most Whigs with many Canningites and some ultra-Tories. Lord Lansdowne, in the absence of any alternative, remained the leading figure in the Whig opposition.\n\nIn 1830 Grey returned to the front rank of politics. On 30 June 1830 he denounced the government in the House of Lords. He rapidly attracted the support of opponents of the ministry. The renewal of organised opposition was also bolstered earlier in the year by the election of a new Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons, the heir of Earl Spencer, [[John Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer|Viscount Althorp]].\n\nIn November 1830 Grey was invited to form a government and resumed the formal leadership of the party and as such Wellington and Peel became the Leaders of the Opposition in the two Houses, from November 1830.\n\n===Leaders of the Opposition 1830\u20131937===\n\nIn the period of 1830\u20131937 the normal expectation was that there would be two leading parties (often with smaller allied groups), of which one would form the government and the other the opposition.<ref>The discussion in this section is based upon ''British Historical Facts 1830\u20131900'' and ''Twentieth Century British Political Facts 1900\u20132000.</ref> These parties were expected to have recognised leaders in the two Houses, so there was normally no problem in identifying who led the opposition in each House.\n\nThe constitutional convention developed in the nineteenth century was that if one of the leaders was the last prime minister of the party, then he would be considered the overall leader of his party. If that was not the case then the leaders of both Houses were of equal status. As the monarch retained some discretion as to which leader should be invited to form a ministry, it was not always obvious in advance which one would be called upon to do so.\n\nHowever, as the Leadership of the Opposition only existed by custom, the normal expectations and conventions were modified by political realities from time to time.\n\nFrom 1830 until 1846 the [[Tory Party|Tory]]/[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Party and the [[Whig Party (UK)|Whig Party]] (increasingly often described with its [[Radical Party (UK)|Radical]] and other allies as the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]) alternated in power and provided clear Leaders of the Opposition.\n\nIn 1846 the Conservative Party split into (Protectionist) Conservative and [[Peelite]] (or Liberal Conservative) factions. The Protectionists being the larger group, the recognised Leaders of the Opposition were drawn from their ranks. In the House of Lords, Lord Stanley (soon becoming [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]]) was the Protectionist leader. He was the only established front rank political figure in the faction and thus a very strong candidate to form the next Conservative ministry.\n\nThe leadership in the House of Commons was more problematic. [[Lord George Bentinck]], the leader of the Protectionist revolt against Sir Robert Peel, initially led the party in the Commons. He resigned in December 1847. The party was then faced with the problem of how to produce a credible leader, who was not [[Benjamin Disraeli]].  The first attempt to square the circle, was made in February 1848, when the young [[Charles Manners, 6th Duke of Rutland|Marquess of Granby]] was installed as the leader. He gave up the post in March 1848. The leadership then fell vacant until February 1849.\n\nThe next experiment was to entrust the leadership to a [[triumvirate]] of Granby, Disraeli and the elderly [[John Charles Herries]]. In practice Disraeli ignored his co-triumvirs. In 1851 Granby resigned and the party accepted Disraeli as the sole leader. The Protectionists by then were clearly the core of the Conservative Party and Derby was able to form his first government in 1852.\n\nThe Liberal Party was formally founded in 1859, replacing the Whig Party as one of the two leading parties. With increasing party discipline it became easier to define the principal opposition party and the Leaders of the Opposition.\n\nThe last overall Leader of the Opposition to have led it from the House of Lords was the [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Earl of Rosebery]]. He resigned as such in November 1896.  Lord Rosebery had been [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] prime minister from 1894 to 1895.\n\n[[File:Andrew Bonar Law Vanity Fair 10 April 1912.jpg|thumb|right|<center>\"the opposition\"<center>[[Bonar Law]] as caricatured in ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', April 1912</center>]]\nThe [[Parliament Act 1911]] removed the [[legislature|legislative]] veto from the [[House of Lords]] to permit the welfare-state forming [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] legislation to be enacted by the Commons, the [[People's Budget]] and any future [[Money Bill]]s without any input from the Lords.  This therefore entrenched the de facto position that there could only be one true Leader of the Opposition and in effect clarified in which house that leader would need to sit.  From this point, all Leaders of the Opposition in the House of Commons would thus be overall Leaders of the Opposition.\n\nIn 1915 the Liberal, Conservative and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] parties formed a coalition. The [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] did not join the government but were by and large not in opposition to it. As almost nobody in the Parliament could be said to be in opposition to the coalition, the leaderships of the opposition in both Houses fell vacant.\n\n[[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Sir Edward Carson]], the leading figure among the Irish Unionist part of the Conservative and Unionist Party, resigned from the coalition ministry on 19 October 1915. He then became the leader of those Unionists who were not members of the government, effectively Leader of the Opposition in the Commons.\n\nThe party situation changed in December 1916: a leading Liberal, [[David Lloyd George]], formed a coalition with the support of a section of \"Coalition Liberal\", Conservative and Labour parties. The Liberal leader, [[H. H. Asquith]], and most of his leading colleagues left the government and took up seats on the opposition side of the House of Commons. Asquith was recognised as the Leader of the Opposition. He retained that post until he was defeated in the [[1918 United Kingdom general election]]. Although Asquith continued to be the leader of the Liberal Party, as he was not a member of the House of Commons he was not eligible to be Leader of the Opposition.\n\nThe Parliament elected in [[1918 United Kingdom general election|December 1918]] which sat from 1919 until 1922, represents the most significant deviation from the principle that the Leader of the Opposition is the leader of the party not in government with the greatest numerical support in the House of Commons. The largest opposition party (disregarding [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], whose MPs did not take their seats at Westminster), was the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] which had wholly left the Lloyd George coalition and won 57 seats at the general election. Thirty six Liberals had been elected without coalition support however were mixed in their opposition to Lloyd George. The Labour Party did not have a leader until 1922. The Parliamentary Labour Party annually elected a chairman, but the party, due to its congressional origins, refused to assert a claim that the chairman was the Leader of the Opposition. Although the issue of who was entitled to be Leader of the Opposition was never formally resolved, in practice the Opposition Liberal leader performed most of the parliamentary functions associated with the office.\n\nThe small group of opposition Liberals met in 1919, distanced by his coalition's protectionism and nationalization. They resolved that they were the Liberal Parliamentary Party. They elected [[Donald Maclean (British politician)|Sir Donald Maclean]] as Chairman of the Parliamentary Party. Liberal Party practice at the time, when the overall Leader of the Party had lost an election to the House of Commons, was for the chairman to function as acting leader in the House. Maclean therefore took on the role of Leader of the Opposition, followed by Asquith, who returned to the House by winning a [[1920 Paisley by-election|by-election]] (1920\u201322).\n\nFrom 1922 the Labour Party had a recognised leader so took over all remaining commons opposition roles from the Opposition Liberal Party.  Since 1922 the principal Government and Opposition parties have been the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].  There were three instances of peers being seriously considered for the prime ministership, during the twentieth century ([[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Curzon of Kedleston]] in 1923, [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Halifax]] in 1940 and [[Alec Douglas-Home|Home]] in 1963), but these were all cases where the Conservative Party was in government and do not affect the list of Leaders of the Opposition.\n\nIn 1931\u201332 the Leader of the Labour Party was [[Arthur Henderson]]. He was Leader of the Opposition for a short period in 1931, but was ineligible to continue when he lost his seat in the 1931 general election. [[George Lansbury]] was Leader of the Opposition before he also became the Leader of the Labour Party in 1932.\n\n===Statutory Leaders of the Opposition from 1937===\nLeaders of the Opposition in the two Houses of Parliament had been generally recognised and given a special status in Parliament for more than a century before they were mentioned in legislation.\n\n''[[Erskine May: Parliamentary Practice]]'' confirms that the office of Leader of the Opposition was first given statutory recognition in the [[Ministers of the Crown Act 1937]].\n\n* Section 5 states that \"There shall be paid to the Leader of the Opposition an annual salary of two thousand pounds\".\n* Section 10(1) includes a definition (which codifies the usual situation under the previous custom)  \"Leader of the Opposition\" means that member of the House of Commons who is for the time being the leader in that House of the party in opposition to His Majesty's Government having the greatest numerical strength in that House\".\n* The 1937 Act also contains an important provision to decide who is the Leader of the Opposition, if this is in doubt. Under section 10(3) \"If any doubt arises as to which is or was at any material time the party in opposition to His Majesty's Government having the greatest numerical strength in the House of Commons, or as to who is or was at any material time the leader in that House of such a party the question shall be decided for the purposes of this Act by the Speaker of the House of Commons, and his decision, certified in writing under his hand, shall be final and conclusive\".\n\nSubsequent legislation also gave statutory recognition to the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords.\n\n* Section 2(1) of the [[Ministerial and other Salaries Act 1975]], provides that \"In this Act \"Leader of the Opposition\" means, in relation to either House of Parliament, that member of that House who is for the time being the Leader in that House of the party in opposition to Her Majesty's Government having the greatest numerical strength in the House of Commons\".\n* Section 2(2) is in exactly the same terms as section 10(3) of the 1937 Act (apart from substituting Her Majesty's for His Majesty's).\n* Section 2(3) is a corresponding provision for the [[Lord Chancellor]] (since 2005, the [[Lord Speaker]]) to decide about the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords.\n\nThe legislative provisions confirm that Leader of the Opposition is, strictly, a Parliamentary office; so that to be leader a person must be a member of the House in which he or she leads.\n\nSince 1937 the Leader of the Opposition has received a state salary in addition to their salary as a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP), now equivalent to a Cabinet Minister. The holder also receives a [[chauffeur]]-driven car for official business of equivalent cost and specification to the vehicles used by most [[minister (government)|cabinet ministers]].\n\nIn 1940 the three largest parties in the House of Commons formed a coalition government to continue to prosecute the Second World War. This coalition continued in office until shortly after the defeat of Germany in 1945. As the former Leader of the Opposition had joined the government the issue arose of who was to hold the office or perform its functions. ''Keesing's Contemporary Archives 1937\u20131940'' (at paragraph 4069D) reported the situation, based on ''[[Hansard]]'':\n\n<blockquote>\nThe Prime Minister replying to Mr Denman in the House of Commons on 21 May, said that in view of the formation of an Administration embracing the three main political parties, H.M. Government was of the opinion that the provision of the Ministers of the Crown Act, 1937, relating to the payment of a salary to the Leader of the Opposition was in abeyance for the time being, as there was no alternative party capable of forming a Government. He added that he did not consider amending legislation necessary.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'' reported that the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]] met on 22 May 1940 and unanimously elected Dr [[Hastings Bertrand Lees-Smith|H.B. Lees-Smith]] as Chairman of the PLP (an office normally held by the party leader at that time) and as spokesman of the Party from the opposition front bench.\n\nAfter the death of Lees-Smith, on 18 December 1941, the PLP held a meeting on 21 January 1942. [[Frederick Pethick-Lawrence]] was unanimously elected Chairman of the PLP and the official spokesman of the party in the House of Commons while the party leader was serving in the government. After the deputy leader of the party ([[Arthur Greenwood]]) left the government on 22 February 1942 he took over these roles from Pethick-Lawrence until the end of the coalition and the resumption of normal party politics.\n\n==List of Leaders of the Opposition==\nThe table lists the people who were, or who acted as, Leaders of the Opposition in the two Houses of Parliament since 1807, prior to which the post was held by [[Charles James Fox]] for decades.\n\nThe leaders of the two Houses were of equal status, before 1911, unless one was the most recent Prime Minister for the party. Such a former prime minister was considered to be the overall Leader of the Opposition. From 1911 the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons was considered to be the overall Leader of the Opposition. Overall leaders names are bolded. Acting leaders names are in italics unless the acting leader subsequently became a full leader during a continuous period as leader.\n\nDue to the fragmentation of both principal parties in 1827\u201330, the leaders and principal opposition parties suggested for those years are provisional.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Date\n!colspan=2|Principal party<br />of

This may possibly have also been the case in 1828\u201330. Grey's article in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' suggests \"... though he called on Lansdowne to take up the leadership of the opposition he was still unwilling to give it up altogether\". Grey was in opposition in 1827\u201328, when Lansdowne was in government. Given the confusion of the politics of the period, particularly after 1827 when both principal parties were fragmented, it is possible that Grey should be considered Leader of the Opposition 1824\u20131830. However the definite statements (by Foord) that Grey resigned the leadership in 1824 and (by Cook & Keith) that Grey did not resume the leadership until November 1830 leads to a different conclusion.\n: {{note label|B|B|B}} An alternative interpretation is that Palmerston (the immediate past Prime Minister) and Lord John Russell (a previous Prime Minister) were joint leaders. Cook & Keith have Palmerston as the sole leader.\n: {{note label|C|C|C}} Harcourt resigned 14 December 1898.\n: {{note label|D|D|D}} Rosebery resigned 6 October 1896.\n: {{note label|E|E|E}} Balfour lost his seat in the House of Commons in January 1906.\n: {{note label|F|F|F}} During Asquith's coalition government of 1915\u20131916, there was no formal opposition in either the Commons or the Lords. The only party not in Asquith's Liberal, Conservative, Labour Coalition was the Irish Nationalist Party led by [[John Redmond]]. However, this party supported the government and did not function as an Opposition. [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Sir Edward Carson]], the leading figure amongst the Irish Unionist allies of the Conservative Party, resigned from the coalition ministry on 19 October 1915. He then became the de facto leader of those Unionists who were not members of the government, effectively Leader of the Opposition in the Commons.\n: {{note label|G|G|G}} Asquith lost his seat in the House of Commons in December 1918.\n: {{note label|H|H|H}} Douglas in ''The History of the Liberal Party 1895\u20131970'' observes that \"The technical question whether the Leader of the Opposition was Maclean or [[William Adamson]], Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, was never fully resolved ... The fact that Adamson did not press his claim for Opposition leadership is of more than technical interest, for it shows that the Labour Party was still not taking itself seriously as a likely alternative government\".\n: {{note label|I|I|I}} The Labour Party did not appoint a leader in the Lords until it formed its first government in 1924.\n: {{note label|J|J|J}} Henderson lost his seat in the House of Commons on 27 October 1931.\n: {{note label|K|K|K}} Lansbury was acting as leader, in the absence from the House of Commons of Henderson, in 1931\u20131932; before becoming party leader himself in 1932.\n: {{note label|L|L|L}} Attlee was acting as leader, after the resignation of Lansbury on 25 October 1935, before being elected party leader himself on 3 December 1935.\n: {{note label|M|M|M}} During World War II a succession of three Labour politicians acted as Leader of the Opposition for the purpose of allowing the House of Commons to function normally, however as in the mid World War I ministry, opposition did not run under a party-whipped system. As the Government 1940\u201345 was a coalition government in which Labour politicians functioned fully as members of the Government: neither [[Deputy Prime Minister (UK)|Deputy Prime Minister]] Clement Attlee nor these three received the salary for the post of Leader of the Opposition. The largest party that opposed the war and was not part of the coalition \u2013 and therefore, in theory, the opposition was the [[Independent Labour Party]] led by [[James Maxton]]. With only three MPs, it tried to take over the opposition frontbench but was widely opposed in this venture.\n: {{note label|N|N|N}} Lord Addison was not a member of the wartime coalition government. When Labour was part of the government from May 1940 until May 1945, Addison functioned as a formal, procedural Opposition Leader, in the same way as the acting Leaders of the Opposition in the House of Commons.\n: {{note label|O|O|O}} Viscount Cranborne is the main subsidiary title to the [[Marquess of Salisbury]] given to its heir. Two Lords Cranborne have been Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords.

Before 1981 the leader, in opposition, was elected annually by the parliamentary Labour Party. From 1981 to 2010, the leader was elected by an electoral college of party members, MPs and [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]], as well as [[trade unions]] before the party switched to a true [[one member, one vote]] system in 2015.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]\n*[[List of Leaders of the Opposition of the United Kingdom by length of tenure]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''British Historical Facts 1760\u20131830'', by Chris Cook and John Stevenson (The Macmillan Press 1980)\n* ''British Historical Facts 1830\u20131900'', by Chris Cook and Brendan Keith (The Macmillan Press 1975)\n* ''His Majesty's Opposition 1714\u20131830'', by Archibald S.

In the nineteenth century party affiliations were generally less fixed and leaders in the two Houses were often of equal status. A single, clear Leader of the Opposition was only definitively settled if the opposition leader in Commons or Lords was the outgoing prime minister. However, since the [[Parliament Act 1911]] there has been no dispute that the leader in the House of Commons is pre-eminent and has always held the main title.\n\nThe Leader of the Opposition is entitled to a salary in addition to their salary as a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]].

The emergence of the office thus coincided with the period when wholly united parties ([[Whig Party (UK)|Whig]] and [[Tory Party|Tory]], governments and oppositions) became the norm.<ref name=foord>''His Majesty's Opposition 1714\u20131830'', Archibald S. Foord, Oxford University Press (1964), 494 pages {{ISBN|0198213115}}.</ref> This situation was normalised in the Parliament of 1807\u20131812, when the members of the Grenvillite and Foxite Whig factions resolved to maintain a joint, dual-house leadership for the whole party.\n\nThe [[Ministry of all the Talents]], in which both Whig factions participated fell at the [[1807 United Kingdom general election|1807 general election]], during which the Whigs had re-adopted traditional factions, forming ''an'' opposition.  The prime minister of the Talents ministry, [[William Wyndham Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville|Lord Grenville]] had led his eponymous faction from the [[House of Lords]].  Meanwhile, the government leader of the House of Commons, [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Viscount Howick]] (later known as Earl Grey and the political heir of [[Charles James Fox]] who had died in 1806), led his faction, the Foxite whigs, from the House of Commons.<ref name=foord/>\n\nHowick's father, [[Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey|the 1st Earl Grey]] died on 14 November 1807. As such the new Earl Grey vacated his seat in the House of Commons and moved to the House of Lords. This left no obvious Whig leader in the House of Commons.<ref name=foord/>\n\nGrenville's article in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' confirms that he was  considered the Whig leader in the House of Lords between 1807 and 1817, despite Grey leading the larger faction.\n\nGrenville and Grey, political historian Archibald Foord describes as being \"[[duumvirate|duumvirs]] of the party from 1807 to 1817\" and consulted about what was to be done. Grenville was at first reluctant to name a Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons, commenting \"... all the elections in the world would not have made Windham or Sheridan leaders of the old Opposition while Fox was alive ...\".\n\nEventually they jointly recommended [[George Ponsonby]] to the Whig MPs, whom they accepted as the first Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons. Ponsonby, an Irish lawyer who was the uncle of Grey's wife, had been [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]] during the Ministry of all the Talents and had only just been re-elected to the House of Commons in 1808 when he became leader.<ref name=foord/> Ponsonby proved a weak leader but as he could not be persuaded to resign and the duumvirs did not want to depose him, he remained in place until he died in 1817.<ref name=foord/>\n\nLord Grenville retired from active politics in 1817, leaving Grey as the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords. Grey was not a former prime minister in 1817, unlike Grenville, so under the convention that developed later in the century he would have been in theory of equal status to whoever was leader in the other House. However, there was little doubt that if a Whig ministry was possible, Grey rather than the less distinguished Commons leaders would have been invited to form that government. In this respect Grey's position was like that of the Earl of Derby in the Protectionist Conservative opposition of the late 1840s and early 1850s.<ref name=foord/>\n\nEarl Grey witnessed a delay of about a year, until 1818, before a new Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons was chosen. This was [[George Tierney]] who was reluctant to accept the leadership and had weak support from his party.  On 18 May 1819, Tierney moved a motion in the Commons for a committee on the state of the nation. This motion was defeated by 357 to 178, a division involving the largest number of MPs until the debates over the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform bill in the early 1830s]]. Foord comments that \"this defeat put an effective end to Tierney's leadership ... Tierney did not disclaim the leadership till 23 Jan. 1821 ..., but he had ceased to exercise its functions since the great defeat\".\n\nBetween 1821 and 1830 the Whig Commons leadership was left vacant. The leadership in the House of Lords was not much more effective: in 1824 Grey retired from active leadership, asking the party to follow the [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Marquess of Lansdowne]] \"as the person whom his friends were to look upon as their leader\". Lansdowne disclaimed the title of leader, although in practice he performed the function.\n\nFollowing the retirement of [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] from the prime ministership in 1827, the party political situation changed. Neither the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] or [[Robert Peel]] agreed to serve under [[George Canning]] and they were followed by five other members of the former Cabinet as well as forty junior members of the previous government. The Tory Party was heavily split between the \"High Tories\" (or \"Ultras\", nicknamed after [[Ultra-royalist|the contemporary party]] in France) and the moderates supporting Canning, often called '[[Canningites]]'. As a result, Canning found it difficult to maintain a government and chose to invite a number of Whigs to join his Cabinet, including [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]]. After Canning's death, [[Frederick Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich|Lord Goderich]] continued the coalition for a few more months.The principal opposition between April 1827 and January 1828 worked with these brief administrations, although Earl Grey and a section of the Whigs were also in opposition to the coalition government.  It was during this period that the term \"His Majesty's Opposition\" for the Opposition was coined, by [[John Cam Hobhouse]].<ref>''His Majesty's Opposition 1714\u20131830'', Archibald S. Foord, Greenwood Press, 1979, 494 pages, page 1.</ref>\n\nThe Duke of Wellington formed a ministry in January 1828 and as a direct effect of adopting in earnest the policy of [[Catholic Emancipation]] the opposition became composed of most Whigs with many Canningites and some ultra-Tories. Lord Lansdowne, in the absence of any alternative, remained the leading figure in the Whig opposition.\n\nIn 1830 Grey returned to the front rank of politics. On 30 June 1830 he denounced the government in the House of Lords. He rapidly attracted the support of opponents of the ministry. The renewal of organised opposition was also bolstered earlier in the year by the election of a new Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons, the heir of Earl Spencer, [[John Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer|Viscount Althorp]].\n\nIn November 1830 Grey was invited to form a government and resumed the formal leadership of the party and as such Wellington and Peel became the Leaders of the Opposition in the two Houses, from November 1830.\n\n===Leaders of the Opposition 1830\u20131937===\n\nIn the period of 1830\u20131937 the normal expectation was that there would be two leading parties (often with smaller allied groups), of which one would form the government and the other the opposition.<ref>The discussion in this section is based upon ''British Historical Facts 1830\u20131900'' and ''Twentieth Century British Political Facts 1900\u20132000.</ref> These parties were expected to have recognised leaders in the two Houses, so there was normally no problem in identifying who led the opposition in each House.\n\nThe constitutional convention developed in the nineteenth century was that if one of the leaders was the last prime minister of the party, then he would be considered the overall leader of his party. If that was not the case then the leaders of both Houses were of equal status. As the monarch retained some discretion as to which leader should be invited to form a ministry, it was not always obvious in advance which one would be called upon to do so.\n\nHowever, as the Leadership of the Opposition only existed by custom, the normal expectations and conventions were modified by political realities from time to time.\n\nFrom 1830 until 1846 the [[Tory Party|Tory]]/[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Party and the [[Whig Party (UK)|Whig Party]] (increasingly often described with its [[Radical Party (UK)|Radical]] and other allies as the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]) alternated in power and provided clear Leaders of the Opposition.\n\nIn 1846 the Conservative Party split into (Protectionist) Conservative and [[Peelite]] (or Liberal Conservative) factions. The Protectionists being the larger group, the recognised Leaders of the Opposition were drawn from their ranks. In the House of Lords, Lord Stanley (soon becoming [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]]) was the Protectionist leader. He was the only established front rank political figure in the faction and thus a very strong candidate to form the next Conservative ministry.\n\nThe leadership in the House of Commons was more problematic. [[Lord George Bentinck]], the leader of the Protectionist revolt against Sir Robert Peel, initially led the party in the Commons. He resigned in December 1847. The party was then faced with the problem of how to produce a credible leader, who was not [[Benjamin Disraeli]].  The first attempt to square the circle, was made in February 1848, when the young [[Charles Manners, 6th Duke of Rutland|Marquess of Granby]] was installed as the leader. He gave up the post in March 1848. The leadership then fell vacant until February 1849.\n\nThe next experiment was to entrust the leadership to a [[triumvirate]] of Granby, Disraeli and the elderly [[John Charles Herries]]. In practice Disraeli ignored his co-triumvirs. In 1851 Granby resigned and the party accepted Disraeli as the sole leader. The Protectionists by then were clearly the core of the Conservative Party and Derby was able to form his first government in 1852.\n\nThe Liberal Party was formally founded in 1859, replacing the Whig Party as one of the two leading parties. With increasing party discipline it became easier to define the principal opposition party and the Leaders of the Opposition.\n\nThe last overall Leader of the Opposition to have led it from the House of Lords was the [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Earl of Rosebery]]. He resigned as such in November 1896.  Lord Rosebery had been [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] prime minister from 1894 to 1895.\n\n[[File:Andrew Bonar Law Vanity Fair 10 April 1912.jpg|thumb|right|<center>\"the opposition\"<center>[[Bonar Law]] as caricatured in ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', April 1912</center>]]\nThe [[Parliament Act 1911]] removed the [[legislature|legislative]] veto from the [[House of Lords]] to permit the welfare-state forming [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] legislation to be enacted by the Commons, the [[People's Budget]] and any future [[Money Bill]]s without any input from the Lords.  This therefore entrenched the de facto position that there could only be one true Leader of the Opposition and in effect clarified in which house that leader would need to sit.  From this point, all Leaders of the Opposition in the House of Commons would thus be overall Leaders of the Opposition.\n\nIn 1915 the Liberal, Conservative and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] parties formed a coalition. The [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] did not join the government but were by and large not in opposition to it. As almost nobody in the Parliament could be said to be in opposition to the coalition, the leaderships of the opposition in both Houses fell vacant.\n\n[[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Sir Edward Carson]], the leading figure among the Irish Unionist part of the Conservative and Unionist Party, resigned from the coalition ministry on 19 October 1915. He then became the leader of those Unionists who were not members of the government, effectively Leader of the Opposition in the Commons.\n\nThe party situation changed in December 1916: a leading Liberal, [[David Lloyd George]], formed a coalition with the support of a section of \"Coalition Liberal\", Conservative and Labour parties. The Liberal leader, [[H. H. Asquith]], and most of his leading colleagues left the government and took up seats on the opposition side of the House of Commons. Asquith was recognised as the Leader of the Opposition. He retained that post until he was defeated in the [[1918 United Kingdom general election]]. Although Asquith continued to be the leader of the Liberal Party, as he was not a member of the House of Commons he was not eligible to be Leader of the Opposition.\n\nThe Parliament elected in [[1918 United Kingdom general election|December 1918]] which sat from 1919 until 1922, represents the most significant deviation from the principle that the Leader of the Opposition is the leader of the party not in government with the greatest numerical support in the House of Commons. The largest opposition party (disregarding [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], whose MPs did not take their seats at Westminster), was the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] which had wholly left the Lloyd George coalition and won 57 seats at the general election. Thirty six Liberals had been elected without coalition support however were mixed in their opposition to Lloyd George. The Labour Party did not have a leader until 1922. The Parliamentary Labour Party annually elected a chairman, but the party, due to its congressional origins, refused to assert a claim that the chairman was the Leader of the Opposition. Although the issue of who was entitled to be Leader of the Opposition was never formally resolved, in practice the Opposition Liberal leader performed most of the parliamentary functions associated with the office.\n\nThe small group of opposition Liberals met in 1919, distanced by his coalition's protectionism and nationalization. They resolved that they were the Liberal Parliamentary Party. They elected [[Donald Maclean (British politician)|Sir Donald Maclean]] as Chairman of the Parliamentary Party. Liberal Party practice at the time, when the overall Leader of the Party had lost an election to the House of Commons, was for the chairman to function as acting leader in the House. Maclean therefore took on the role of Leader of the Opposition, followed by Asquith, who returned to the House by winning a [[1920 Paisley by-election|by-election]] (1920\u201322).\n\nFrom 1922 the Labour Party had a recognised leader so took over all remaining commons opposition roles from the Opposition Liberal Party.  Since 1922 the principal Government and Opposition parties have been the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]].  There were three instances of peers being seriously considered for the prime ministership, during the twentieth century ([[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Curzon of Kedleston]] in 1923, [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Halifax]] in 1940 and [[Alec Douglas-Home|Home]] in 1963), but these were all cases where the Conservative Party was in government and do not affect the list of Leaders of the Opposition.\n\nIn 1931\u201332 the Leader of the Labour Party was [[Arthur Henderson]]. He was Leader of the Opposition for a short period in 1931, but was ineligible to continue when he lost his seat in the 1931 general election. [[George Lansbury]] was Leader of the Opposition before he also became the Leader of the Labour Party in 1932.\n\n===Statutory Leaders of the Opposition from 1937===\nLeaders of the Opposition in the two Houses of Parliament had been generally recognised and given a special status in Parliament for more than a century before they were mentioned in legislation.\n\n''[[Erskine May: Parliamentary Practice]]'' confirms that the office of Leader of the Opposition was first given statutory recognition in the [[Ministers of the Crown Act 1937]].\n\n* Section 5 states that \"There shall be paid to the Leader of the Opposition an annual salary of two thousand pounds\".\n* Section 10(1) includes a definition (which codifies the usual situation under the previous custom)  \"Leader of the Opposition\" means that member of the House of Commons who is for the time being the leader in that House of the party in opposition to His Majesty's Government having the greatest numerical strength in that House\".\n* The 1937 Act also contains an important provision to decide who is the Leader of the Opposition, if this is in doubt. Under section 10(3) \"If any doubt arises as to which is or was at any material time the party in opposition to His Majesty's Government having the greatest numerical strength in the House of Commons, or as to who is or was at any material time the leader in that House of such a party the question shall be decided for the purposes of this Act by the Speaker of the House of Commons, and his decision, certified in writing under his hand, shall be final and conclusive\".\n\nSubsequent legislation also gave statutory recognition to the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords.\n\n* Section 2(1) of the [[Ministerial and other Salaries Act 1975]], provides that \"In this Act \"Leader of the Opposition\" means, in relation to either House of Parliament, that member of that House who is for the time being the Leader in that House of the party in opposition to Her Majesty's Government having the greatest numerical strength in the House of Commons\".\n* Section 2(2) is in exactly the same terms as section 10(3) of the 1937 Act (apart from substituting Her Majesty's for His Majesty's).\n* Section 2(3) is a corresponding provision for the [[Lord Chancellor]] (since 2005, the [[Lord Speaker]]) to decide about the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords.\n\nThe legislative provisions confirm that Leader of the Opposition is, strictly, a Parliamentary office; so that to be leader a person must be a member of the House in which he or she leads.\n\nSince 1937 the Leader of the Opposition has received a state salary in addition to their salary as a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP), now equivalent to a Cabinet Minister. The holder also receives a [[chauffeur]]-driven car for official business of equivalent cost and specification to the vehicles used by most [[minister (government)|cabinet ministers]].\n\nIn 1940 the three largest parties in the House of Commons formed a coalition government to continue to prosecute the Second World War. This coalition continued in office until shortly after the defeat of Germany in 1945. As the former Leader of the Opposition had joined the government the issue arose of who was to hold the office or perform its functions. ''Keesing's Contemporary Archives 1937\u20131940'' (at paragraph 4069D) reported the situation, based on ''[[Hansard]]'':\n\n<blockquote>\nThe Prime Minister replying to Mr Denman in the House of Commons on 21 May, said that in view of the formation of an Administration embracing the three main political parties, H.M. Government was of the opinion that the provision of the Ministers of the Crown Act, 1937, relating to the payment of a salary to the Leader of the Opposition was in abeyance for the time being, as there was no alternative party capable of forming a Government. He added that he did not consider amending legislation necessary.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'' reported that the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]] met on 22 May 1940 and unanimously elected Dr [[Hastings Bertrand Lees-Smith|H.B. Lees-Smith]] as Chairman of the PLP (an office normally held by the party leader at that time) and as spokesman of the Party from the opposition front bench.\n\nAfter the death of Lees-Smith, on 18 December 1941, the PLP held a meeting on 21 January 1942. [[Frederick Pethick-Lawrence]] was unanimously elected Chairman of the PLP and the official spokesman of the party in the House of Commons while the party leader was serving in the government. After the deputy leader of the party ([[Arthur Greenwood]]) left the government on 22 February 1942 he took over these roles from Pethick-Lawrence until the end of the coalition and the resumption of normal party politics.\n\n==List of Leaders of the Opposition==\nThe table lists the people who were, or who acted as, Leaders of the Opposition in the two Houses of Parliament since 1807, prior to which the post was held by [[Charles James Fox]] for decades.\n\nThe leaders of the two Houses were of equal status, before 1911, unless one was the most recent Prime Minister for the party. Such a former prime minister was considered to be the overall Leader of the Opposition. From 1911 the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons was considered to be the overall Leader of the Opposition. Overall leaders names are bolded. Acting leaders names are in italics unless the acting leader subsequently became a full leader during a continuous period as leader.\n\nDue to the fragmentation of both principal parties in 1827\u201330, the leaders and principal opposition parties suggested for those years are provisional.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Date\n!colspan=2|Principal party<br />of

This may possibly have also been the case in 1828\u201330. Grey's article in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' suggests \"... though he called on Lansdowne to take up the leadership of the opposition he was still unwilling to give it up altogether\". Grey was in opposition in 1827\u201328, when Lansdowne was in government. Given the confusion of the politics of the period, particularly after 1827 when both principal parties were fragmented, it is possible that Grey should be considered Leader of the Opposition 1824\u20131830. However the definite statements (by Foord) that Grey resigned the leadership in 1824 and (by Cook & Keith) that Grey did not resume the leadership until November 1830 leads to a different conclusion.\n: {{note label|B|B|B}} An alternative interpretation is that Palmerston (the immediate past Prime Minister) and Lord John Russell (a previous Prime Minister) were joint leaders. Cook & Keith have Palmerston as the sole leader.\n: {{note label|C|C|C}} Harcourt resigned 14 December 1898.\n: {{note label|D|D|D}} Rosebery resigned 6 October 1896.\n: {{note label|E|E|E}} Balfour lost his seat in the House of Commons in January 1906.\n: {{note label|F|F|F}} During Asquith's coalition government of 1915\u20131916, there was no formal opposition in either the Commons or the Lords. The only party not in Asquith's Liberal, Conservative, Labour Coalition was the Irish Nationalist Party led by [[John Redmond]]. However, this party supported the government and did not function as an Opposition. [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Sir Edward Carson]], the leading figure amongst the Irish Unionist allies of the Conservative Party, resigned from the coalition ministry on 19 October 1915. He then became the de facto leader of those Unionists who were not members of the government, effectively Leader of the Opposition in the Commons.\n: {{note label|G|G|G}} Asquith lost his seat in the House of Commons in December 1918.\n: {{note label|H|H|H}} Douglas in ''The History of the Liberal Party 1895\u20131970'' observes that \"The technical question whether the Leader of the Opposition was Maclean or [[William Adamson]], Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, was never fully resolved ... The fact that Adamson did not press his claim for Opposition leadership is of more than technical interest, for it shows that the Labour Party was still not taking itself seriously as a likely alternative government\".\n: {{note label|I|I|I}} The Labour Party did not appoint a leader in the Lords until it formed its first government in 1924.\n: {{note label|J|J|J}} Henderson lost his seat in the House of Commons on 27 October 1931.\n: {{note label|K|K|K}} Lansbury was acting as leader, in the absence from the House of Commons of Henderson, in 1931\u20131932; before becoming party leader himself in 1932.\n: {{note label|L|L|L}} Attlee was acting as leader, after the resignation of Lansbury on 25 October 1935, before being elected party leader himself on 3 December 1935.\n: {{note label|M|M|M}} During World War II a succession of three Labour politicians acted as Leader of the Opposition for the purpose of allowing the House of Commons to function normally, however as in the mid World War I ministry, opposition did not run under a party-whipped system. As the Government 1940\u201345 was a coalition government in which Labour politicians functioned fully as members of the Government: neither [[Deputy Prime Minister (UK)|Deputy Prime Minister]] Clement Attlee nor these three received the salary for the post of Leader of the Opposition. The largest party that opposed the war and was not part of the coalition \u2013 and therefore, in theory, the opposition was the [[Independent Labour Party]] led by [[James Maxton]]. With only three MPs, it tried to take over the opposition frontbench but was widely opposed in this venture.\n: {{note label|N|N|N}} Lord Addison was not a member of the wartime coalition government. When Labour was part of the government from May 1940 until May 1945, Addison functioned as a formal, procedural Opposition Leader, in the same way as the acting Leaders of the Opposition in the House of Commons.\n: {{note label|O|O|O}} Viscount Cranborne is the main subsidiary title to the [[Marquess of Salisbury]] given to its heir. Two Lords Cranborne have been Leader of the Opposition in the House of Lords. They sat in the House of Lords as the title unusually had an acting [[writ of acceleration]] which did entitle father and son to sit in the House, ineffective since the [[House of Lords Act 1999]].\n: {{note label|P|P|P}} Commonly referred to as the acting leader, following the death or immediate resignation of the leader, but is, according to the Labour Party Rule Book, fully leader until the next leader is selected. Before 1981 the leader, in opposition, was elected annually by the parliamentary Labour Party. From 1981 to 2010, the leader was elected by an electoral college of party members, MPs and [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]], as well as [[trade unions]] before the party switched to a true [[one member, one vote]] system in 2015.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]\n*[[List of Leaders of the Opposition of the United Kingdom by length of tenure]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''British Historical Facts 1760\u20131830'', by Chris Cook and John Stevenson (The Macmillan Press 1980)\n* ''British Historical Facts 1830\u20131900'', by Chris Cook and Brendan Keith (The Macmillan Press 1975)\n* ''His Majesty's Opposition 1714\u20131830'', by Archibald S.

Mil Gaya is not an Indian E.T.'|website=www.rediff.com}}</ref> as the story of an [[Intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] boy coming in contact with an alien appears to parallel ''The Alien'' much closer than it does ''E.T.''\n\n== Plot ==\nScientist Sanjay Mehra ([[Rakesh Roshan]]) creates a computer from which he sends variations of the [[syllable]] [[om]] into space, hoping to attract [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] life. When he believes he has finally received a response, the scientific community mocks him. While driving home, an alien spacecraft appears overhead. Distracted, Sanjay drives off the road, causing the car to explode, killing him. His pregnant wife Sonia ([[Rekha]]) survives and returns home to India. When their son Rohit Mehra ([[Hrithik Roshan]]) is born, he is [[Intellectual disability|mentally disabled]] due to an injury he received in the accident while a fetus. Sonia learns that although surgery is the only solution to Rohit's disability, but it could result in paralysis or death. Not wanting to lose her only remaining  relative, she raises him in the town of [[Kasauli]], where he grows up to be a man of limited intellect.\n\nNisha Malhotra ([[Preity Zinta]]), a young lady comes to Kasauli and is initially antagonistic to Rohit due to his childish pranks against her. This causes her friend, Raj ([[Rajat Bedi]]), and his buddies to attack Rohit and break his scooter. Rohit's mother chastises Nisha and Raj for assaulting Rohit. Realizing her mistake, Nisha gifts Rohit a new bike and introduces him to her parents, who are also sympathetic.\n\nRohit and Nisha, now good friends, find Sanjay's old 'Om' computer and Rohit inadvertently summons the aliens. The visiting aliens leave in haste, leaving one behind. Rohit, Nisha and Rohit's young friends find and befriend the alien, naming him Jadoo (\"Magic\") and discover his [[psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] abilities. Raj does not like Nisha's friendship with Rohit so bullies him and spreads a fake rumor that he and Nisha are getting married. This upsets Nisha and Rohit, who is especially hurt as he was under the impression that Nisha was his girlfriend.\n\nJadoo discovers that Rohit is mentally abnormal and uses his powers, derived from sunlight, to enhance Rohit's mind. The next morning, Rohit finds himself with a clear vision; he later solves a 10th standard mathematics problem, surprising his mathematics teacher and principal. He later lectures his computer teacher for insulting him and to understand the responsibilities of being a teacher. As a result, Rohit finds himself accepted by most of the school.\n\nRohit's physical abilities are also increased to superhuman levels. Later, Raj challenges Rohit and his friends to a basketball match. Rohit uses his new physique to score several baskets during the match so Raj and his gang begin to play dirty to win the game. After the sun comes out, Jadoo helps Rohit and his young friends to win the game. The now changed Rohit meets Nisha and her parents and confesses his love for her, which Nisha now reciprocates.\n\nRaj and his friends later corner Rohit's friends over their supernatural performance at the basketball game. Rohit's friends are forced to flee and Jadoo accidentally falls from their grasp. Inspector Sukhwani, ([[Johnny Lever]]) sees Jadoo in the bag and informs the authorities. The policemen capture the bag, although Rohit arrives in time to rescue Jadoo. He is later confronted by Raj and his buddies. Rohit, now infuriated, easily takes down Raj and his buddies but not before the police catch up to him. It is then revealed that Jadoo was not in the bag and had escaped when Sukhwani was busy calling the Police.\n\nHowever, the police are suspicious of Rohit and confront him at his house. They take Jadoo and knock Rohit out. When he regains consciousness, Rohit uses his super-speed to catch up to the police cars and arrives just in time to save Jadoo from being taken to America. The spaceship, which he had summoned with his father's computer beforehand, arrives back and Rohit bids a sad farewell to Jadoo. As Jadoo leaves, Rohit loses his powers and reverts to his disabled self. This saves him from prosecution by the [[Indian government]] who felicitate him for his actions.\n\nAfter everything dies down, Raj and his buddies return to harass Rohit and challenge him to kick a ball to them. An enraged Rohit kicks the ball into the bully's face as Jadoo returns Rohit's powers permanently. Rohit and Nisha thank Jadoo and gets married. Nisha gives birth to Rohit's son - Krishna Mehra and lived a peaceful life thereafter.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Hrithik Roshan]] as Rohit Mehra\n*[[Preity Zinta|Preity G Zinta]] as Nisha Mehra (Nee'Malhotra)  \n**Initially, [[Aishwarya Rai|Aishwarya Rai Bachan]] was offered the role of Nisha Mehra.

Mil Gaya is not an Indian E.T.'|website=www.rediff.com}}</ref> as the story of an [[Intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] boy coming in contact with an alien appears to parallel ''The Alien'' much closer than it does ''E.T.''\n\n== Plot ==\nScientist Sanjay Mehra ([[Rakesh Roshan]]) creates a computer from which he sends variations of the [[syllable]] [[om]] into space, hoping to attract [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] life. When he believes he has finally received a response, the scientific community mocks him. While driving home, an alien spacecraft appears overhead. Distracted, Sanjay drives off the road, causing the car to explode, killing him. His pregnant wife Sonia ([[Rekha]]) survives and returns home to India. When their son Rohit Mehra ([[Hrithik Roshan]]) is born, he is [[Intellectual disability|mentally disabled]] due to an injury he received in the accident while a fetus. Sonia learns that although surgery is the only solution to Rohit's disability, but it could result in paralysis or death. Not wanting to lose her only remaining  relative, she raises him in the town of [[Kasauli]], where he grows up to be a man of limited intellect.\n\nNisha Malhotra ([[Preity Zinta]]), a young lady comes to Kasauli and is initially antagonistic to Rohit due to his childish pranks against her. This causes her friend, Raj ([[Rajat Bedi]]), and his buddies to attack Rohit and break his scooter. Rohit's mother chastises Nisha and Raj for assaulting Rohit. Realizing her mistake, Nisha gifts Rohit a new bike and introduces him to her parents, who are also sympathetic.\n\nRohit and Nisha, now good friends, find Sanjay's old 'Om' computer and Rohit inadvertently summons the aliens. The visiting aliens leave in haste, leaving one behind. Rohit, Nisha and Rohit's young friends find and befriend the alien, naming him Jadoo (\"Magic\") and discover his [[psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] abilities. Raj does not like Nisha's friendship with Rohit so bullies him and spreads a fake rumor that he and Nisha are getting married. This upsets Nisha and Rohit, who is especially hurt as he was under the impression that Nisha was his girlfriend.\n\nJadoo discovers that Rohit is mentally abnormal and uses his powers, derived from sunlight, to enhance Rohit's mind. The next morning, Rohit finds himself with a clear vision; he later solves a 10th standard mathematics problem, surprising his mathematics teacher and principal. He later lectures his computer teacher for insulting him and to understand the responsibilities of being a teacher. As a result, Rohit finds himself accepted by most of the school.\n\nRohit's physical abilities are also increased to superhuman levels. Later, Raj challenges Rohit and his friends to a basketball match. Rohit uses his new physique to score several baskets during the match so Raj and his gang begin to play dirty to win the game. After the sun comes out, Jadoo helps Rohit and his young friends to win the game. The now changed Rohit meets Nisha and her parents and confesses his love for her, which Nisha now reciprocates.\n\nRaj and his friends later corner Rohit's friends over their supernatural performance at the basketball game. Rohit's friends are forced to flee and Jadoo accidentally falls from their grasp. Inspector Sukhwani, ([[Johnny Lever]]) sees Jadoo in the bag and informs the authorities. The policemen capture the bag, although Rohit arrives in time to rescue Jadoo. He is later confronted by Raj and his buddies. Rohit, now infuriated, easily takes down Raj and his buddies but not before the police catch up to him. It is then revealed that Jadoo was not in the bag and had escaped when Sukhwani was busy calling the Police.\n\nHowever, the police are suspicious of Rohit and confront him at his house. They take Jadoo and knock Rohit out. When he regains consciousness, Rohit uses his super-speed to catch up to the police cars and arrives just in time to save Jadoo from being taken to America. The spaceship, which he had summoned with his father's computer beforehand, arrives back and Rohit bids a sad farewell to Jadoo. As Jadoo leaves, Rohit loses his powers and reverts to his disabled self. This saves him from prosecution by the [[Indian government]] who felicitate him for his actions.\n\nAfter everything dies down, Raj and his buddies return to harass Rohit and challenge him to kick a ball to them. An enraged Rohit kicks the ball into the bully's face as Jadoo returns Rohit's powers permanently. Rohit and Nisha thank Jadoo and gets married. Nisha gives birth to Rohit's son - Krishna Mehra and lived a peaceful life thereafter.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Hrithik Roshan]] as Rohit Mehra\n*[[Preity Zinta]] as Nisha Malhotra. \n**Initially, [[Aishwarya Rai]] was offered the role of Nisha.

Blacklite District's sound relies heavily on the influence of hip hop, pop, and classic hard rock. He began writing music as a way to cope after the death of his mother, Tina Pfeiffer, in May 1999.\n\nBlacklite District rose to international YouTube fame in 2018 with the release of his song \u201cCold As Ice\u201d, which ended up getting 100 million streams and hit #35 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart. He followed it up with a string of other viral hits, including \u201cThe Struggle\u201d, \u201cJust So You Know\u201d, and \u201cGoodbye\u201d. Combined, he has gotten over 300 million streams globally across YouTube and Spotify, and was awarded YouTube's Sliver Creator Award in November 2019 for passing 111,000 subscribers on his channel as of January 28, 2020.\n\nBlacklite District has released multiple independent projects over the years, with his official debut album planned for release in late 2020 through his own AK19 Entertainment, LLC label. \"Over This\" was released as the first official single from the album on January 24, 2020, follow up by \"Falling\" on February 21, and \"Wishing Dead\" on April 3, as the second and third singles respectively. No release date or album title has been announced yet, but it's been confirmed that Pfeiffer will release singles from the album consistently throughout 2020 leading up to the album. \n\n== Early Life ==\n\nKyle Pfeiffer was born on June 9, 1990 in Munster, IN (suburban Chicago) to mother Tina Pfeiffer, and father George Balac. Both of his parents struggled with drug addiction, and Pfeiffer was raised by his grandparents, Tony and Sheila Pfeiffer. He attended kindergarten in Griffith, IN, before he and his grandparents moved to South Dakota in 1997-98. \n\nOn May 3, 1999, his mother passed away from a [[heroin overdose]] at the age of 27. Shortly after, Pfeiffer began discocvering and listening to artists like [[Ozzy Osbourne]], as an escape from the trauma of losing a parent at such a young age. He claims Ozzy Osbourne as his biggest musical influence and for getting him started on the path to a career in music. \n\nAt the age of 10, Pfeiffer's grandfather bought him a drum-set from a [[Sears]] catalog after he started listening to [[Fleetwood Mac]]. He learned to play drums by himself by watching VHS tapes of live concerts. Eventually he re-discovered and became obsessed with [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s first band, [[Black Sababth]], and that's when he started taking singing seriously, and writing his own songs. \n\nDuring his teenage years, Pfeiffer attended Spearfish Middle School and High School, where he graduated from in the class of 2009. At the age of 13, Pfeiffer started his first band with local friends and began playing shows locally in the Black Hills area. \n\n== Career ==\n\nWhile the name Blacklite District started as a band, Pfeiffer decided to use it as his official stage name after his song \"Cold As Ice\" went viral on YouTube. In an interview, Pfeiffer stated that many \"fans thought that it was my name as a solo artist, so I just went with it.\" \n\nAs a group, Blacklite District released the song \"With Me Now\" in 2013, and it went Top 40 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart and sold over 100,000 digital downloads. The band went on tour with [[Saving Abel]] in 2014, and did an interview and performance at [[SiriusXM]] early that year. Following a summer tour with Another Lost Year, Pfeiffer decided to take the band off the road amid a lawsuit with his former manager and label in Florida. \n\nIn 2016, Pfeiffer released \"We Are The Danger\" as the lead single from his indie project, ''To Whom It May Concern'', which was released in October of that year. \"The Struggle\" was released in August and went viral online, getting over a million views on YouTube in it's first month. The following year, the song had a spike with the release of a \"Minecraft\" themed music video, and got over 50 million combined streams. \n\nIn January and February of 2017, Pfeiffer released \"Living In A Nightmare\" (featuring R8eDR), and \"Cold As Ice\" respectively, as the leads singles from his ''Instant Gratification'' indie project. \"Cold As Ice' had a long build through the summer on YouTube, and eventually got over 100 million streams after the release of another Minecraft animated music video, which was trending worldwide the week of release. The album debuted in the Top 10 on [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] Music. \n\nAs a solo artist, Pfeiffer released \"Hard Pill To Swallow\", which was premiered by [[Billboard]] in October 2018. The song went on to get over 10 million combined streams. In January 2019, \"1 of a kind\" was released as the second single from Pfeiffer's \"Through The Ages' project, which included 18 tracks.\n\nIn January 2020, Pfeiffer announced he would officially release his debut album later in the year, and released \"Over This\", \"Falling\", and \"Wishing Dead\", as the first three singles from the album, and announced a tour supporting [[Adelitas Way]], which was postponed until the fall due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n== Musical style ==\n\nPfeiffer is known for his wide range of music styles and genres in his music. He grew up on hard rock acts such as Ozzy Osbourne, Metallica, Motley Crue, and Guns N Roses. He later got into newer acts at the time like Avenged Sevenfold and Linkin Park. In later years, he got into new age rap music and cites artists like [[Juice WRLD]], [[Post Malone]], and [[XXXTentacion]] as influences on his sound. \n\nPfeiffer uses auto-tune as an effect on a lot of his songs, and sometimes none at all. The sound of Blacklite District has been characterized as rock, pop, alternative rock, hip hop, trap, antiviral pop, and more. \n\n== YouTube Achievements ==\n\nBlacklite District's success really came to be after blowing up on YouTube. He was awarded the Silver Creator Award (aka Silver Play Button) in November 2019 for passing 100,000 subscribers on the platform. As of April 2020, he has 118,000+ subscribers. Blacklite District has a partnership with YouTuber, Rainimator, in which they Minecraft animated music videos for Blacklite District songs. Many of these songs have done 10 million views or more, with \"Cold As Ice\" closing in on 60 million. Pfeiffer credits this collaboration as a big part of his success in breaking into the music business doing things a new way, verses the traditional outlets like radio. \n\n== Personal life ==\n\nPfeiffer began dating Amber Rice in September 2015, and the two were married two years later in December 2017. They raise Pfeiffer's son, Maddox, from a previous relationship. He proposed to Amber during a New Years Eve concert in his hometown of Spearfish, SD. \n\nPfeiffer has lived in multiple cities during his time breaking into the music industry. He moved to [[Los Angeles]] area in 2012, and still visits there frequently to record and shoot music videos. He also lived in Orlando, FL for about six months while working with producer [[Brett Hestla]] on some early recordings. At one time, he was managed by [[Jeff Hanson]], who was also in the Orlando area. \n\nIn 2015-2017, Pfeiffer was hospitalized on multiple occasions for alcohol induced [[pancreatitis]] from years of alcohol abuse on the road, which led to a full blown addiction at home. As of January 2020, Pfeiffer has been clean from booze for over a year and lives a sober lifestyle. \n\nPfeiffer has no siblings. He's an avid WWE fan, and has been since childhood. Pfeiffer has a small obsession with jewelry, and you often see him wearing a cuban link chain on stage that reportedly cost over $10,000. Since his sobriety, he doesn't go out much, and spends most of his time at home with his family, writing and recording music, and running his AK19 Entertainment, LLC label. \n\nIn January 2020, Pfeiffer officially formed AK19 Entertainment as a limited liability company, with his wife Amber. The two are partners and owners of AK19. AK19 is also home to Rob Shiner, who is an artist from the Black Hills and a childhood friend of Pfeiffer's. Rob Shiner released three singles in 2019, of which Pfeiffer is featured on one called \"Just Paranoid\". \n\n== Discography ==\n\n=== Independent Releases ===\n\n* ''[[Worldwide Controversy (album)|Worldwide Controversy]]'' (2014)\n* ''[[To Whom It May Concern (Blacklite District album)|To Whom It May Concern]]'' (2016)\n* ''[[Instant Gratification (album)|Instant Gratification]]'' (2017)\n* ''[[Through the Ages (album)|Through the Ages]]'' (2018)\n* ''[[Souled Out (Blacklite District album)|Souled Out]]'' (2019)\n\n=== Singles ===\n* ''[[Cold as Ice (single)|Cold as Ice]]'' (2017) (#35 Billboard Mainstream Rock)\n* ''[[The Struggle (single)|The Struggle]]'' (2016)\n* ''[[Goodbye (Blacklite District song feat.

He grew up on hard rock acts such as Ozzy Osbourne, Metallica, Motley Crue, and Guns N Roses. He later got into newer acts at the time like Avenged Sevenfold and Linkin Park. In later years, he got into new age rap music and cites artists like [[Juice WRLD]], [[Post Malone]], and [[XXXTentacion]] as influences on his sound. \n\nPfeiffer uses auto-tune as an effect on a lot of his songs, and sometimes none at all. The sound of Blacklite District has been characterized as rock, pop, alternative rock, hip hop, trap, antiviral pop, and more. \n\n== YouTube Achievements ==\n\nBlacklite District's success really came to be after blowing up on YouTube. He was awarded the Silver Creator Award (aka Silver Play Button) in November 2019 for passing 100,000 subscribers on the platform. As of April 2020, he has 118,000+ subscribers. Blacklite District has a partnership with YouTuber, Rainimator, in which they Minecraft animated music videos for Blacklite District songs. Many of these songs have done 10 million views or more, with \"Cold As Ice\" closing in on 60 million. Pfeiffer credits this collaboration as a big part of his success in breaking into the music business doing things a new way, verses the traditional outlets like radio. \n\n== Personal life ==\n\nPfeiffer began dating Amber Rice in September 2015, and the two were married two years later in December 2017. They raise Pfeiffer's son, Maddox, from a previous relationship. He proposed to Amber during a New Years Eve concert in his hometown of Spearfish, SD. \n\nPfeiffer has lived in multiple cities during his time breaking into the music industry. He moved to [[Los Angeles]] area in 2012, and still visits there frequently to record and shoot music videos. He also lived in Orlando, FL for about six months while working with producer [[Brett Hestla]] on some early recordings. At one time, he was managed by [[Jeff Hanson]], who was also in the Orlando area. \n\nIn 2015-2017, Pfeiffer was hospitalized on multiple occasions for alcohol induced [[pancreatitis]] from years of alcohol abuse on the road, which led to a full blown addiction at home. As of January 2020, Pfeiffer has been clean from booze for over a year and lives a sober lifestyle. \n\nPfeiffer has no siblings. He's an avid WWE fan, and has been since childhood. Pfeiffer has a small obsession with jewelry, and you often see him wearing a cuban link chain on stage that reportedly cost over $10,000. Since his sobriety, he doesn't go out much, and spends most of his time at home with his family, writing and recording music, and running his AK19 Entertainment, LLC label. \n\nIn January 2020, Pfeiffer officially formed AK19 Entertainment as a limited liability company, with his wife Amber. The two are partners and owners of AK19. AK19 is also home to Rob Shiner, who is an artist from the Black Hills and a childhood friend of Pfeiffer's. Rob Shiner released three singles in 2019, of which Pfeiffer is featured on one called \"Just Paranoid\". \n\n== Discography ==\n\n=== Independent Releases ===\n\n* ''[[Worldwide Controversy (album)|Worldwide Controversy]]'' (2014)\n* ''[[To Whom It May Concern (Blacklite District album)|To Whom It May Concern]]'' (2016)\n* ''[[Instant Gratification (album)|Instant Gratification]]'' (2017)\n* ''[[Through the Ages (album)|Through the Ages]]'' (2018)\n* ''[[Souled Out (Blacklite District album)|Souled Out]]'' (2019)\n\n=== Singles ===\n* ''[[Cold as Ice (single)|Cold as Ice]]'' (2017) (#35 Billboard Mainstream Rock)\n* ''[[The Struggle (single)|The Struggle]]'' (2016)\n* ''[[Goodbye (Blacklite District song feat.
