{"title_page": "Bernardo Castello", "text_new": "'''Bernardo Castello''' (or '''Castelli''') (1557\u20131629) was an [[Italy|Italian]] painter of the late-[[Mannerist]] style, active mainly in [[Genoa]] and [[Liguria]].  He is mainly known as a [[portrait painter|portrait]] and [[historical painter]].<ref>He  needs to be distinguished from [[Giovanni Battista Castello]], (called ''Il bergamasco''), who was an elder friend of and collaborator with [[Luca Cambiaso]].</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n'''Bernardo Castello''' was born in {{ill|San Martino (Genoa)|lt=San Martino d'Albaro|it|San Martino (quartiere di Genova)}}, now a quarter of [[Genoa]]. He apprenticed under [[Andrea Semino]] and [[Luca Cambiaso]], then he travelled through [[Italy]], meeting other painters and creating his own particular style.\n\nDuring his career he painted a lot of works and was very appreciated by famous poets, with which he had friendship relations.\nAmong these he was a friend of [[Gabriello Chiabrera]] and [[Torquato Tasso]], and took upon himself the task of designing the figures of the ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'', published in 1590 (and also for a further edition, published in 1617).

As Germany was dependent on imports, it is estimated that 523,000 civilians had lost their lives.<ref>[http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/wk1/wirtschaft/versorgung/index.html 'german casualties']{{Dead link|date=January 2020}}</ref> N.

The German government was required to use its gold reserves, being unable to secure a loan from the United States.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nHistorian Sally Marks claims that while \"Allied warships remained in place against a possible resumption of hostilities, the Allies offered food and medicine after the armistice, but Germany refused to allow its ships to carry supplies\".

Gl\u00e4ser further claims that during the early months of 1919, while the main relief effort was being planned, France provided food shipments to Bavaria and the Rhineland. She further claims that the German government delayed the relief effort by refusing to surrender their merchant fleet to the Allies. Finally, she concludes that \"the very success of the relief effort had in effect deprived the [Allies] of a credible threat to induce Germany to sign the Treaty of Versailles.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gl\u00e4ser |title=The Treaty of Versailles: A Reassessment After 75 Years |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |pages=388\u2013391 |isbn=0-521-62132-1 }}</ref> However, it is also the case that for eight months following the end of hostilities, the blockade was continually in place, with some estimates that a further 100,000 casualties among German civilians due to starvation were caused, on top of the hundreds of thousands which already had occurred.

It has been posited that the Central Powers may have been exposed to the viral wave before the Allies. The resulting casualties having greater effect, having been incurred during the war, as opposed to the allies who suffered the brunt of the pandemic after the Armistice. When the extent of the epidemic was realized, the respective censorship programs of the Allies and Central Powers limited the public's knowledge regarding the true extent of the disease. Because Spain was neutral, their media was free to report on the Flu, giving the impression that it began there. This misunderstanding led to contemporary reports naming it the \"[[Spanish flu]].\" Investigative work by a British team led by virologist John Oxford of St Bartholomew's Hospital and the Royal London Hospital, identified a major troop staging and hospital camp in \u00c9taples, France as almost certainly being the center of the 1918 flu pandemic.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20027428 in JSTOR]</ref> Some of them, such as Czechoslovakia and Poland, had substantial ethnic minorities who were sometimes not fully satisfied with the new boundaries that cut them off from fellow ethnics.  For example, Czechoslovakia had [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)|Germans]], [[Poles in Czechoslovakia|Poles]], [[Ruthenians and Ukrainians in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)|Ruthenians and Ukrainians]], [[Slovaks in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)|Slovaks]] and [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Hungarians]]. The [[League of Nations]] sponsored various [[Minority Treaties]] in an attempt to deal with the problem, but with the decline of the League in the 1930s, these treaties became increasingly unenforceable. One consequence of the massive redrawing of borders and the political changes in the aftermath of the war was the large number of European refugees. These and the refugees of the [[Russian Civil War]] led to the creation of the [[Nansen passport]].\n\nEthnic minorities made the location of the frontiers generally unstable. Where the frontiers have remained unchanged since 1918, there has often been the expulsion of an ethnic group, such as the [[Sudeten Germans]]. Economic and military cooperation amongst these small states was minimal, ensuring that the defeated powers of Germany and the Soviet Union retained a latent capacity to dominate the region. In the immediate aftermath of the war, defeat drove [[Germany\u2013Soviet Union relations before 1941|cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union]] but ultimately these two powers would compete to dominate eastern Europe.\n\nTwo million [[Armenians]], native inhabitants of [[Armenian Highlands|Armenian Highland]], were nearly eliminated in Turkey in consequence of [[Armenian Genocide|Genocide of Armenians]] committed by [[Young Turks|Young Turk Government]].\n\n==Political upheavals==\n{{main|International relations (1919\u20131939)}}\n\n===New nations break free===\nGerman and Austrian forces in 1918 defeated the Russian armies, and the new communist government in Moscow signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] in March 1918. In that treaty, Russia renounced all claims to [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Ukraine]], and the territory of [[Congress Poland]], and it was left to Germany and Austria-Hungary \"to determine the future status of these territories in agreement with their population.\" Later on, [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s government also renounced the [[Partitions of Poland|Partition of Poland treaty]], making it possible for Poland to claim its 1772 borders. However, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was rendered obsolete when Germany was defeated later in 1918, leaving the status of much of eastern Europe in an uncertain position.\n\n===Revolutions===\n{{Main|Revolutions of 1917\u20131923}}\n[[File:Europe map 1919.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Political divisions of Europe in 1919 after the treaties of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk]] and [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] and before the treaties of [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]], [[Treaty of Kars|Kars]], [[Treaty of Riga|Riga]] and the creation of the Soviet Union, [[Irish Free State]] and [[Turkish Republic]]]]\n\nA far-left and often explicitly [[Communist]] [[revolutionary wave]] occurred in several European countries in 1917\u20131920, notably in Germany and Hungary. The single most important event precipitated by the privations of World War I was the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution of 1917]].\n\n===Germany===\n{{Main|German Revolution of 1918\u201319|Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic}}\nIn Germany, there was a socialist revolution which led to the brief establishment of a number of communist political systems in (mainly urban) parts of the country, the abdication of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]], and the creation of the [[Weimar Republic]].\n\nOn 28 June 1919 the Weimar Republic was forced, under threat of continued Allied advance, to sign the Treaty of Versailles. Germany viewed the one-sided treaty as a humiliation and as [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|blaming it for the entire war]]. While the intent of the treaty was to assign guilt to Germany to justify financial reparations, the notion of blame took root as a political issue in German society and was never accepted by nationalists, although it was argued by some, such as German historian [[Fritz Fischer]]. The German government disseminated [[propaganda]] to further promote this idea, and funded the [[Centre for the Study of the Causes of the War]] to this end.\n\n132&nbsp;billion gold marks ($31.5&nbsp;billion, 6.6&nbsp;billion pounds) were demanded from Germany in reparations, of which only 50&nbsp;billion had to be paid. In order to finance the purchases of foreign currency required to pay off the reparations, the new German republic printed tremendous amounts of money \u2013 to disastrous effect. [[Hyperinflation]] plagued Germany between 1921 and 1923. In this period the worth of [[fiat money|fiat]] [[German Papiermark|Papiermark]]s with respect to the earlier [[commodity money|commodity]] [[German gold mark|Goldmark]]s was reduced to one trillionth (one million millionth) of its value.<ref>Table IV (page 441) of ''The Economics of Inflation'' by Costantino Bresciani-Turroni, published 1937.<!--File:GermanyHyperChart.jpg--></ref> In December 1922 the Reparations Commission declared Germany in default, and on 11 January 1923 French and Belgian troops [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied the Ruhr]] until 1925.\n\nThe treaty required Germany to permanently reduce the size of its army to 100,000 men, and destroy their tanks, air force, and U-boat fleet (her capital ships, moored at [[Scapa Flow]], were [[Scuttling of the German fleet at Scapa Flow|scuttled by their crews]] to prevent them from falling into Allied hands).\n\nGermany saw relatively small amounts of territory transferred to Denmark, Czechoslovakia, and Belgium, a larger amount to France (including the temporary French occupation of the Rhineland) and the greatest portion as part of a reestablished Poland. Germany's overseas colonies were divided between a number of Allied countries, most notably the United Kingdom in Africa, but it was the loss of the territory that composed the newly independent Polish state, including the German city of [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]] and the separation of East Prussia from the rest of Germany, that caused the greatest outrage. Nazi propaganda would feed on a general German view that the treaty was unfair \u2013 many Germans never accepted the treaty as legitimate, and lent their political support to [[Adolf Hitler]].\n\n===Russian Empire===\n[[File:Russian civil war west.svg|thumb|European theatre of the [[Russian Civil War]] in 1918\u201319]]\n{{See also|Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War}}\nThe Soviet Union benefited from Germany's loss, as one of the first terms of the armistice was the abrogation of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]. At the time of the armistice Russia was in the grips of a [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] which left more than seven million people dead and large areas of the country devastated. The nation as a whole suffered socially and economically.\n\n[[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] gained independence. They were occupied again by the Soviet Union in 1940.\n\n[[Finland]] gained a lasting independence, though she repeatedly had to [[Winter War|fight]] the Soviet Union for her borders.\n\n[[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and [[Azerbaijan]] were established as independent states in the Caucasus region. However, after withdrawal of Russian army in 1917 and during [[Turkish Invasion of Armenia (1920)|1920 Turkish invasion of Armenia]], Turkey captured the Armenian territory around [[Artvin]], [[Kars]], and [[Igdir]], and these territorial losses became permanent.  As consequence of invasions of Turkey and Russian Red Army all three Transcaucasian countries were proclaimed as Soviet Republics in 1920 and over time were absorbed into the Soviet Union.\n\n[[Romania]] gained [[Bessarabia]] from Russia.\n\nThe Russian concession in [[Tianjin]] was occupied by the Chinese in 1920; in 1924 the Soviet Union renounced its claims to the district.\n\n===Austria-Hungary=== <!-- This section is linked from [[Austria-Hungary]] -->\n{{Essay-like|section|date=December 2009}}\n{{Main|Treaty of Trianon|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)}}\n\nWith the war having turned decisively against the [[Central Powers]], the people of [[Austria-Hungary]] lost faith in their allied countries, and even before the armistice in November, radical [[nationalism]] had already led to several [[Declaration of independence|declarations of independence]] in south-central Europe after November 1918. As the central government had ceased to operate in vast areas, these regions found themselves without a government and many new groups attempted to fill the void. During this same period, the population was facing food shortages and was, for the most part, demoralized by the losses incurred during the war. Various political parties, ranging from ardent nationalists, to social democrats, to communists attempted to set up governments in the names of the different nationalities. In other areas, existing nation states such as [[Romania]] engaged regions that they considered to be theirs. These moves created de facto governments that complicated life for diplomats, idealists, and the Western allies.\n\nThe Western forces were officially supposed to occupy the old Empire, but rarely had enough troops to do so effectively. They had to deal with local authorities who had their own agenda to fulfill. At the peace conference in Paris the diplomats had to reconcile these authorities with the competing demands of the nationalists who had turned to them for help during the war, the strategic or political desires of the Western allies themselves, and other agendas such as a desire to implement the spirit of the Fourteen Points.\n\nFor example, in order to live up to the ideal of self-determination laid out in the Fourteen Points, Germans, whether Austrian or German, should be able to decide their own future and government. However, the French especially were concerned that an expanded Germany would be a huge security risk. Further complicating the situation, delegations such as the Czechs and Slovenians made strong claims on some German-speaking territories.\n\nThe result was treaties that compromised many ideals, offended many allies, and set up an entirely new order in the area. Many people hoped that the new nation states would allow for a new era of prosperity and peace in the region, free from the bitter quarrelling between nationalities that had marked the preceding fifty years. This hope proved far too optimistic. Changes in territorial configuration after World War I included:\n\n* Establishment of the [[German Austria|Republic of German Austria]] and the [[Hungarian Democratic Republic]], disavowing any continuity with the empire and exiling the [[Habsburg]] family in perpetuity.\n* Borders of newly independent Hungary did not include two-thirds of the lands of the former [[Kingdom of Hungary]], including areas where the ethnic Magyars were in a majority. The new republic of Austria maintained control over most of the predominantly German-controlled areas, but lost various other German majority lands in what was the [[Austrian Empire]].\n\n[[File:Dissolution of Austria-Hungary.png|right|thumb|300px|Division of [[Austria-Hungary]] after World War I]]\n\n* [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], [[Opava Silesia]] and the western part of the [[Duchy of Cieszyn]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] formed the new [[Czechoslovakia]].\n* [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], the eastern part of the [[Duchy of Cieszyn]], northern [[Orava (county)|County of Orava]] and northern [[Spisz]] were transferred to [[Republic of Poland|Poland]].\n* the Southern half of the [[County of Tyrol]] and [[Trieste]] were granted to [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].\n* [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia-Slavonia]], [[Kingdom of Dalmatia|Dalmatia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Syrmia]] [[Banat, Ba\u010dka and Baranja]] were joined with [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] to form the [[Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], later [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].\n* [[Transylvania]] and [[Bukovina]] became parts of [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]].\n* The Austro-Hungarian [[Concessions in Tianjin#Austro-Hungarian concession|concession]] in [[Tianjin]] was ceded to the Republic of China.\n\nThese changes were recognized in, but not caused by, the Treaty of Versailles. They were subsequently further elaborated in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] and the [[Treaty of Trianon]].\n\nThe 1919 treaties generally included guarantees of minority rights, but there was no enforcement mechanism.  The new states of eastern Europe mostly all had large ethnic minorities. Millions of Germans found themselves in the newly created countries as minorities. More than two million ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside of Hungary in Slovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia. Many of these national minorities found themselves in hostile situations because the modern governments were intent on defining the national character of the countries, often at the expense of the other nationalities.  The interwar years were hard for religious minorities in the new states built around ethnic nationalism. The [[Jew]]s were especially distrusted because of their minority religion and distinct subculture.  This was a dramatic come-down from the days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Although [[antisemitism]] had been widespread during Habsburg rule, Jews faced no official discrimination because they were, for the most part, ardent supporters of the multi-national state and the monarchy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Marsha L. Rozenblit|title=Reconstructing a National Identity: The Jews of Habsburg Austria During World War I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CVl3obLidUC&pg=PA163 |year=2004|publisher=Oxford UP|page=163|isbn=9780195176308}}</ref>\n\nThe economic disruption of the war and the end of the Austro-Hungarian [[customs union]] created great hardship in many areas. Although many states were set up as democracies after the war, one by one, with the exception of Czechoslovakia, they reverted to some form of authoritarian rule. Many quarreled amongst themselves but were too weak to compete effectively. Later, when Germany rearmed, the nation states of south-central Europe were unable to resist its attacks, and fell under German domination to a much greater extent than had ever existed in Austria-Hungary.\n\n===Ottoman Empire===<!-- This section is linked from [[Ottoman Empire]] -->\n{{Main|Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|Turkish War of Independence}}\n[[File:Treaty of S\u00e8vres 1920.svg|thumb|260px|Borders of Turkey according to the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] (1920) which was annulled and replaced by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] in 1923]]\nAt the end of the war, the Allies [[Occupation of Constantinople|occupied Constantinople]] ([[\u0130stanbul]]) and the Ottoman government collapsed. The [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]], designed to repair damage caused by Ottomans during the war to the winning Allies, was signed by Ottoman Empire on 10 August 1920, but was never ratified by the Sultan.\n\nThe [[occupation of Smyrna]] by Greece on 18 May 1919 triggered a nationalist movement to rescind the terms of the treaty. [[Turkish National Movement|Turkish revolutionaries]] led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], a successful Ottoman commander, rejected the terms enforced at S\u00e8vres and under the guise of General Inspector of the Ottoman Army, left Istanbul for [[Samsun]] to organize the remaining Ottoman forces to resist the terms of the treaty. On the eastern front, after the [[Turkish\u2013Armenian War|invasion of Armenia in 1920]] and signing of the [[Treaty of Kars]] with the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian S.F.S.R.]] Turkey took over territory lost to Armenia and post-Imperial Russia.<ref name=\"kars=text\">{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.amsi.ge/istoria/sab/yarsi.html Text of the Treaty of Kars] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070424044332/http://www.amsi.ge/istoria/sab/yarsi.html |date=2007-04-24 }}</ref>\n\nOn the western front, the growing strength of the Turkish nationalist forces led Greece, with the backing of Britain, to invade deep into [[Anatolia]] in an attempt to deal a blow to the revolutionaries. At the [[Battle of Dumlup\u0131nar]], the Greek army was defeated and forced into retreat, leading to the burning of Smyrna and the withdrawal of Greece from Asia Minor. With the nationalists empowered, the army marched on to reclaim Istanbul, resulting in the [[Chanak Crisis]] in which the British Prime Minister, [[David Lloyd George]], was forced to resign. After Turkish resistance gained control over Anatolia and Istanbul, the S\u00e8vres treaty was superseded by the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] which formally ended all hostilities and led to the creation of the modern [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]]. As a result, Turkey became the only power of World War I to overturn the terms of its defeat, and negotiate with the Allies as an equal.<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/turkey/13.htm Countrystudies \u2013 Turkey]</ref>\n\nLausanne Treaty formally acknowledged the new League of Nations mandates in the Middle East, the cession of their territories on the Arabian Peninsula, and British sovereignty over [[Cyprus]].

Parts of the Ottoman Empire on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] became part of what is today [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Yemen]]. The [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]] became a pivotal milestone in the creation of the modern Middle East, the result of which bore witness to the creation of new conflicts and hostilities in the region.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fromkin |first=David |authorlink=David Fromkin |year=1989 |title=A Peace to End All Peace: Creating the Modern Middle East 1914\u20131922 |location=New York |publisher=H.

American opinion on the propriety of providing aid to Germans and Austrians was split, as evidenced by an exchange of correspondence between [[Edgar Gott]], an executive with [[Boeing|The Boeing Company]] and Charles Osner, chairman of the Committee for the Relief of Destitute Women and Children in Germany and Austria. Gott argued that relief should first go to citizens of countries that had suffered at the hands of the [[Central Powers]], while Osner made an appeal for a more universal application of humanitarian ideals.<ref>Kuhlman, Erika A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=t7139hAmM6AC&pg=PA120&dq=edgar+gott&hl=en&sa=X&ei=pppwUYHlAsqNqgG2sIFI&sqi=2&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=edgar%20gott&f=false Of Little Comfort]. 2012. pp.&nbsp;120\u2013121.</ref> The American economic influence allowed the Great Depression to start a domino effect, pulling Europe in as well.\n\n===France===\n[[File:French enter Essen.jpg|thumb|French cavalry entering [[Essen]] during the occupation of the Ruhr.]]\n[[Alsace-Lorraine]] returned to France, the region which had been ceded to Prussia in 1871 after the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. At the 1919 Peace Conference, Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]]'s aim was to ensure that Germany would not seek revenge in the following years. To this purpose, the chief commander of the Allied forces, Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]], had demanded that for the future protection of France the [[Rhine]] river should now form the border between France and Germany. Based on history, he was convinced that Germany would again become a threat, and, on hearing the terms of the Treaty of Versailles that had left Germany substantially intact, he observed that \"This is not Peace. It is an Armistice for twenty years.\"\n\nThe destruction brought upon French territory was to be indemnified by the [[World War I reparations|reparations]] negotiated at Versailles. This financial imperative dominated France's foreign policy throughout the 1920s, leading to the 1923 [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] in order to force Germany to pay. However, Germany was unable to pay, and obtained support from the United States. Thus, the [[Dawes Plan]] was negotiated after Prime Minister [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]]'s occupation of the Ruhr, and then the [[Young Plan]] in 1929.\n\nAlso extremely important in the War was the participation of [[French colonial troops]] (who amounted for around 10% of the total number of troops deployed by France across the war), including the Senegalese ''[[tirailleur]]s'', and troops from [[French Indochina|Indochina]], North Africa, and [[Madagascar]]. When these soldiers returned to their homelands and continued to be treated as second class citizens, many became the nuclei of pro-independence groups.\n\nFurthermore, under the state of war declared during the hostilities, the French economy had been somewhat centralized in order to be able to shift into a \"[[war economy]]\", leading to a first breach with [[classical liberalism]].\n\nFinally, the socialists' support of the National Union government (including [[Alexandre Millerand]]'s nomination as Minister of War) marked a shift towards the [[French Section of the Workers' International]]'s (SFIO) turn towards social democracy and participation in \"bourgeois governments\", although [[L\u00e9on Blum]] maintained a socialist rhetoric.\n\n===Italy===\n[[File:Fiume cheering D'Annunzio.jpg|thumb|right|Residents of [[Fiume]] cheering D'Annunzio and his ''Legionari'', September 1919.

However, even if relations with [[Berlin]] became very friendly, the alliance with [[Vienna]] remained purely formal, as the Italians were keen to acquire [[Trentino]] and [[Trieste]], parts of the Austro-Hungarian empire populated by Italians.\n\nDuring [[World War I]] Italy aligned with the Allies, instead of joining Germany and Austria. This could happen since the alliance formally had merely defensive prerogatives, while the Central Empires were the ones who started the offensive. With the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]], Britain secretly offered Italy [[Trentino]] and [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] as far as [[Brenner, South Tyrol|Brenner]], [[Trieste]] and [[Istria]], all the [[Dalmatia]]n coast except [[Fiume]], full ownership of Albanian [[Vlor\u00eb|Valona]] and a protectorate over [[Italian protectorate over Albania|Albania]], [[Antalya]] in [[Turkey]] and a share of the [[Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] and [[German colonial empire#Confiscation|German colonial empire]], in exchange for Italy siding against the Central Empires{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}.\n \nAfter the victory, [[Vittorio Orlando]], Italy's [[President of the Council of Ministers of Italy|President of the Council of Ministers]], and [[Sidney Sonnino]], its [[Foreign Minister of Italy|Foreign Minister]], were sent as the Italian representatives to [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris]] with the aim of gaining the promised territories and as much other land as possible. In particular, there was an especially strong opinion about the status of [[Fiume]], which they believed was rightly Italian due to Italian population, in agreement with [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]], the ninth of which read:\n\t\t \t\t\n''\"A readjustment of the frontiers of Italy should be effected along clearly recognizable lines of nationality''\".\n\nNevertheless, by the end of the war the Allies realized they had made contradictory agreements with other Nations, especially regarding [[Central Europe]] and the [[Middle-East]]. In the meetings of the \"Big Four\", in which Orlando's powers of diplomacy were inhibited by his lack of English, the Great powers were only willing to offer [[Trentino]] to the [[Brenner, South Tyrol|Brenner]], the Dalmatian port of [[Zadar|Zara]], the island of [[Lastovo|Lagosta]] and a couple of small German colonies. All other territories were promised to other nations and the great powers were worried about Italy's imperial ambitions; Wilson, in particular, was a staunch supporter of Yugoslav rights on Dalmatia against Italy and despite the Treaty of London which he did not recognize.<ref>But perhaps the major hindrance to Italy's aims were the different opinions of Orlando and Sonnino: the first was decided to obtain Fiume and forsake Dalmatia, Sonnino did not mean to abandon Dalmatia and would have willingly left Fiume. This indecision proved fatal for Italy, which did not gain either of the territories.</ref> As a result of this, Orlando left the conference in a rage. This simply favored Britain and France, which divided among themselves the former Ottoman and German territories in Africa.<ref>(Jackson, 1938)</ref>\n\nIn Italy, the discontent was relevant: [[irredentists|Irredentism]] (see: ''[[Italian irredentism|irredentismo]]'') claimed Fiume and Dalmatia as Italian lands; many felt the Country had taken part in a meaningless war without getting any serious benefits. This idea of a \"mutilated victory\" (''[[Mutilated victory|vittoria mutilata]]'') was the reason which led to the ''[[Italian Regency of Carnaro#Impresa di Fiume|Impresa di Fiume]]'' (\"''Fiume Exploit''\"). On September 12, 1919, the nationalist poet [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] led around 2,600 troops from the [[Royal Italian Army]] (the [[Granatieri di Sardegna Mechanized Brigade|Granatieri di Sardegna]]), nationalists and irredentists, into a seizure of the city, forcing the withdrawal of the inter-Allied (American, British and French) occupying forces.\n \t\nThe \"mutilated victory\" (''[[Mutilated victory|vittoria mutilata]]'') became an important part of [[Italian Fascism]] propaganda.\n\n===China===\nThe [[Republic of China (1912-49)|Republic of China]] had been one of the Allies; during the war, it had sent [[Chinese Labour Corps|thousands of labourers]] to France. At the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference in 1919]], the Chinese delegation called for an end to Western imperialistic institutions in China, but was rebuffed. China requested at least the formal restoration of its territory of [[Jiaozhou Bay]], under German colonial control since 1898. But the western Allies rejected China's request, instead granting transfer to Japan of all of Germany's pre-war territory and rights in China. Subsequently, China did not sign the Treaty of Versailles, instead signing a separate peace treaty with Germany in 1921.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian and German [[concessions in Tianjin]] were placed under the administration of the Chinese government; in 1920 they occupied the Russian area as well.\n\nThe western Allies' substantial accession to Japan's territorial ambitions at China's expense led to the [[May Fourth Movement]] in China, a social and political movement that had profound influence over subsequent Chinese history. The May Fourth Movement is often cited as the birth of [[Chinese nationalism]], and both the [[Kuomintang]] and [[Chinese Communist Party]] consider the Movement to be an important period in their own histories.\n\n===Japan===\nBecause of the treaty that Japan had signed with Great Britain in 1902, Japan was one of the Allies during the war. With British assistance, Japanese forces attacked Germany's territories in Shandong province in China, including the East Asian coaling base of the Imperial German navy. The German forces were defeated and surrendered to Japan in November 1914. The Japanese navy also succeeded in seizing several of Germany's island possessions in the Western Pacific: the [[Marianas]], [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]], and [[Marshall Islands]].\n\nAt the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference in 1919]], Japan was granted all of Germany's pre-war rights in [[Shandong]] province in China (despite China also being one of the Allies during the war): outright possession of the territory of [[Jiaozhou Bay]], and favorable commercial rights throughout the rest of the province, as well as a Mandate over the German Pacific island possessions that the Japanese navy had taken. Also, Japan was granted a permanent seat on the Council of the League of Nations. Nevertheless, the Western powers refused Japan's request for the inclusion of a [[Racial Equality Proposal, 1919|\"racial equality\" clause]] as part of the Treaty of Versailles. Shandong reverted to Chinese control in 1922 after mediation by the United States during the [[Washington Naval Conference]]. [[Weihai]] followed in 1930.<ref>Stephen G.

The optimism of [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900]] was entirely gone and those who fought became what is known as \"the [[Lost Generation]]\" because they never fully recovered from their suffering. For the next few years, much of Europe mourned privately and publicly; memorials were erected in thousands of villages and towns.\n\nSo many British men of marriageable age died or were injured that the students of one girls' school were warned that only 10% would marry.{{r|cable200709015}}{{r|nicholson2008}}{{rp|20,245}} The 1921 [[United Kingdom Census]] found 19,803,022 women and 18,082,220 men in England and Wales, a difference of 1.72&nbsp;million which newspapers called the \"Surplus Two Million\".<ref name=\"nicholson2008\">{{cite book | title=Singled Out: How Two Million British Women Survived Without Men After the First World War | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Nicholson, Virginia | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-19-537822-1}}</ref>{{rp|22\u201323}} In the 1921 census there were 1,209 single women aged 25 to 29 for every 1,000 men.

Poison gas and the aerial bombing of civilians were new developments of the First World War. The British civilian population, for many centuries, had not had any serious reason to fear invasion. So the new threat of poison gas dropped from enemy bombers excited a grossly exaggerated view of the civilian deaths that would occur on the outbreak of any future war. Baldwin expressed this in his statement that \"[[The bomber will always get through]].\" The traditional British policy of a balance of power in Europe no longer safeguarded the British home population. Out of this fear came appeasement. It is notable that neither Baldwin nor [[Neville Chamberlain]] fought in the war, but the anti-appeasers [[Antony Eden]], [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[Winston Churchill]] did.\n\nOne gruesome reminder of the sacrifices of the generation was the fact that this was one of the first times in international conflict whereby more men died in battle than from disease, which was the main cause of deaths in most previous wars. The [[Russo-Japanese War]] was another conflict where battle deaths outnumbered disease deaths, but it was fought on a much smaller scale between just two nations.\n\nThis social trauma made itself manifest in many different ways. Some people were revolted by [[nationalism]] and what they believed it had caused, so they began to work toward a more [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] world through organizations such as the League of Nations. [[Pacifism]] became increasingly popular. Others had the opposite reaction, feeling that only military strength could be relied upon for protection in a chaotic and inhumane world that did not respect hypothetical notions of civilization. Certainly a sense of disillusionment and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] became pronounced. [[Nihilism]] grew in popularity. Many people believed that the war heralded the end of the world as they had known it, including the collapse of [[capitalism]] and [[imperialism]]. [[Communist]] and [[socialist]] movements around the world drew strength from this theory, enjoying a level of popularity they had never known before. These feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or particularly harshly affected by the war, such as central Europe, Russia and France.\n\nArtists such as [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]], [[Ernst Barlach]], and [[K\u00e4the Kollwitz]] represented their experiences, or those of their society, in blunt paintings and sculpture. Similarly, authors such as [[Erich Maria Remarque]] wrote grim novels detailing their experiences. These works had a strong impact on society, causing a great deal of controversy and highlighting conflicting interpretations of the war. In Germany, nationalists including the [[Nazism|Nazis]] believed that much of this work was [[Degenerate art|degenerate]] and undermined the cohesion of society as well as dishonoring the dead.\n[[Image:World-war-one-belgium-iron-harvest-fieldside.redvers.jpg|left|thumb|[[Iron harvest]] World War I ordnance left beside a field for disposal by the army in 2004 near [[Ypres]] in Belgium]]\n\n==Remains of ammunition==\n{{Main|Iron harvest}}\n\nThroughout the areas where trenches and fighting lines were located, such as the [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] region of France, quantities of [[unexploded ordnance]] have remained, some of which remains dangerous, continuing to cause injuries and occasional fatalities in the 21st century. Some are found by farmers ploughing their fields and have been called the [[iron harvest]]. Some of this ammunition contains [[chemical warfare|toxic]] chemical products such as [[mustard gas]]. Cleanup of major battlefields is a continuing task with no end in sight for decades to come. Squads remove, defuse or destroy hundreds of tons of unexploded ammunition from both World Wars every year in Belgium, France, and Germany.\n\n==Memorials==\n[[Image:Menin-gate-ypres-belgium.redvers.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Menin Gate Memorial]], in [[Ypres]], Belgium]]\n\n===War memorials===\n[[File:Noms 14-18 Draguignan.jpg|thumb|250px|World War I memorial in [[Draguignan]] France]]\nMany towns in the participating countries have [[war memorial]]s dedicated to local residents who lost their lives.

Four empires collapsed due to the war, old countries were abolished, new ones were formed, boundaries were redrawn, international organizations were established, and many new and old ideologies took a firm hold in people's minds. [[World War I]] also had the effect of bringing political transformation to most of the principal parties involved in the conflict, transforming them into [[Electoral democracy|electoral democracies]] by bringing near-[[universal suffrage]] for the first time in history, as in Germany ([[1919 German federal election]]), Great Britain ([[1918 United Kingdom general election]]), and Turkey ([[1923 Turkish general election]]).\n\n==Blockade of Germany==\n\n{{Main|Blockade of Germany}}\nThrough the period from the armistice on 11 November 1918 until the signing of the peace treaty with Germany on 28 June 1919, the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] maintained the naval blockade of Germany that had begun during the war. As Germany was dependent on imports, it is estimated that 523,000 civilians had lost their lives.<ref>[http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/wk1/wirtschaft/versorgung/index.html 'german casualties']{{Dead link|date=January 2020}}</ref> N. P. Howard, of the University of Sheffield, claims that a further quarter of a million more died from disease or starvation in the eight-month period following the conclusion of the conflict.<ref>[http://libcom.org/files/blockade%20Germany_0.pdf]</ref> The continuation of the blockade after the fighting ended, as author [[Robert Leckie (author)|Robert Leckie]] wrote in ''[[Delivered From Evil]]'', did much to \"torment the Germans&nbsp;... driving them with the fury of despair into the arms of the devil.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The terms of the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Armistice]] did allow food to be shipped into Germany, but the Allies required that Germany provide the means (the shipping) to do so. The German government was required to use its gold reserves, being unable to secure a loan from the United States.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nHistorian Sally Marks claims that while \"Allied warships remained in place against a possible resumption of hostilities, the Allies offered food and medicine after the armistice, but Germany refused to allow its ships to carry supplies\". Further, Marks states that despite the problems facing the Allies, from the German government, \"Allied food shipments arrived in Allied ships before the charge made at Versailles\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Marks |first=Sally |chapter=1918 and After: The Postwar Era |title=The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered |editor-last=Martel |editor-first=Gordon |location=Boston |publisher=Allen & Unwin |year=1986 |page=[https://archive.org/details/originsofsecondw00gord/page/19 19] |isbn=0-04-940084-3 |chapter-url-access=registration |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/originsofsecondw00gord |url=https://archive.org/details/originsofsecondw00gord/page/19 }}</ref> This position is also supported by Elisabeth Gl\u00e4ser who notes that an Allied task force, to help feed the German population, was established in early 1919 and that by May 1919 \" Germany [had] became the chief recipient of American and Allied food shipments\". Gl\u00e4ser further claims that during the early months of 1919, while the main relief effort was being planned, France provided food shipments to Bavaria and the Rhineland. She further claims that the German government delayed the relief effort by refusing to surrender their merchant fleet to the Allies. Finally, she concludes that \"the very success of the relief effort had in effect deprived the [Allies] of a credible threat to induce Germany to sign the Treaty of Versailles.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gl\u00e4ser |title=The Treaty of Versailles: A Reassessment After 75 Years |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |pages=388\u2013391 |isbn=0-521-62132-1 }}</ref> However, it is also the case that for eight months following the end of hostilities, the blockade was continually in place, with some estimates that a further 100,000 casualties among German civilians due to starvation were caused, on top of the hundreds of thousands which already had occurred. Food shipments, furthermore, had been entirely dependent on Allied goodwill, causing at least in part the post-hostilities irregularity.<ref>Germany. Gesundheits-Amt.

Other treaties ended the relationships of the United States and the other Central Powers. Included in the 440 articles of the Treaty of Versailles were the demands that Germany officially accept [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|responsibility for starting the war]] and pay [[World War I reparations|economic reparations]]. The treaty drastically limited the German military machine: German troops were reduced to 100,000 and the country was prevented from possessing major military armaments such as tanks, warships, armored vehicles and submarines.\n\n==Influenza epidemic==\n[[File:Post WWI Conflict Map In New-York Tribune November 9 1919 Page 26.jpg|thumb|alt=Map of Europe with numbered locations|400px|\nThe ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' prints this map on November 9, 1919, of the ongoing armed conflict in Europe in 1919, one year after World War I had ended:{{sfn|New-York Tribune|1919|p=26}}\n{{Ordered list |[[Baltic states#Newly independent countries East of the Baltic Sea|Baltic States War of Independence]]\n| [[White movement|White Army]] of [[Nikolai Yudenich|General Yudenich]]  \n| [[North Russia intervention]]\n| White Army of [[Alexander Kolchak|Kolchak's in Siberia]]\n| [[Anton Denikin|General Denikin's White Army]]  \n| [[Symon Petlura|General Petlura's Ukrainian directorate]] \n| [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]]\n| [[Upper Silesia plebiscite|Silesia]] tension between the Poles and Germans.\n| [[Hungarian\u2013Romanian War|Romanian occupation of Hungary]]\n| [[Gabriele D'Annunzio|Gabriele D'Annunzio's]] seizes Fiume, creates the [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]]\n| In [[Albania during World War I|Albania promiscuous]] fighting is going on \n| [[Turkish War of Independence]]\n}}\n]]\nHistorians continue to argue about the impact the [[1918 flu pandemic]] had on the outcome of the war. It has been posited that the Central Powers may have been exposed to the viral wave before the Allies. The resulting casualties having greater effect, having been incurred during the war, as opposed to the allies who suffered the brunt of the pandemic after the Armistice. When the extent of the epidemic was realized, the respective censorship programs of the Allies and Central Powers limited the public's knowledge regarding the true extent of the disease. Because Spain was neutral, their media was free to report on the Flu, giving the impression that it began there. This misunderstanding led to contemporary reports naming it the \"[[Spanish flu]].\" Investigative work by a British team led by virologist John Oxford of St Bartholomew's Hospital and the Royal London Hospital, identified a major troop staging and hospital camp in \u00c9taples, France as almost certainly being the center of the 1918 flu pandemic. A significant precursor virus was harbored in birds, and mutated to pigs that were kept near the front.<ref>^ Connor, Steve, \"Flu epidemic traced to Great War transit camp\", The Guardian (UK), Saturday, 8 January 2000.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20027428 in JSTOR]</ref> Some of them, such as Czechoslovakia and Poland, had substantial ethnic minorities who were sometimes not fully satisfied with the new boundaries that cut them off from fellow ethnics.  For example, Czechoslovakia had [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)|Germans]], [[Poles in Czechoslovakia|Poles]], [[Ruthenians and Ukrainians in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)|Ruthenians and Ukrainians]], [[Slovaks in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)|Slovaks]] and [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Hungarians]]. The [[League of Nations]] sponsored various [[Minority Treaties]] in an attempt to deal with the problem, but with the decline of the League in the 1930s, these treaties became increasingly unenforceable. One consequence of the massive redrawing of borders and the political changes in the aftermath of the war was the large number of European refugees. These and the refugees of the [[Russian Civil War]] led to the creation of the [[Nansen passport]].\n\nEthnic minorities made the location of the frontiers generally unstable. Where the frontiers have remained unchanged since 1918, there has often been the expulsion of an ethnic group, such as the [[Sudeten Germans]]. Economic and military cooperation amongst these small states was minimal, ensuring that the defeated powers of Germany and the Soviet Union retained a latent capacity to dominate the region. In the immediate aftermath of the war, defeat drove [[Germany\u2013Soviet Union relations before 1941|cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union]] but ultimately these two powers would compete to dominate eastern Europe.\n\nTwo million [[Armenians]], native inhabitants of [[Armenian Highlands|Armenian Highland]], were nearly eliminated in Turkey in consequence of [[Armenian Genocide|Genocide of Armenians]] committed by [[Young Turks|Young Turk Government]].\n\n==Political upheavals==\n{{main|International relations (1919\u20131939)}}\n\n===New nations break free===\nGerman and Austrian forces in 1918 defeated the Russian armies, and the new communist government in Moscow signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] in March 1918. In that treaty, Russia renounced all claims to [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Ukraine]], and the territory of [[Congress Poland]], and it was left to Germany and Austria-Hungary \"to determine the future status of these territories in agreement with their population.\" Later on, [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s government also renounced the [[Partitions of Poland|Partition of Poland treaty]], making it possible for Poland to claim its 1772 borders. However, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was rendered obsolete when Germany was defeated later in 1918, leaving the status of much of eastern Europe in an uncertain position.\n\n===Revolutions===\n{{Main|Revolutions of 1917\u20131923}}\n[[File:Europe map 1919.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Political divisions of Europe in 1919 after the treaties of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk]] and [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] and before the treaties of [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]], [[Treaty of Kars|Kars]], [[Treaty of Riga|Riga]] and the creation of the Soviet Union, [[Irish Free State]] and [[Turkish Republic]]]]\n\nA far-left and often explicitly [[Communist]] [[revolutionary wave]] occurred in several European countries in 1917\u20131920, notably in Germany and Hungary. The single most important event precipitated by the privations of World War I was the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution of 1917]].\n\n===Germany===\n{{Main|German Revolution of 1918\u201319|Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic}}\nIn Germany, there was a socialist revolution which led to the brief establishment of a number of communist political systems in (mainly urban) parts of the country, the abdication of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]], and the creation of the [[Weimar Republic]].\n\nOn 28 June 1919 the Weimar Republic was forced, under threat of continued Allied advance, to sign the Treaty of Versailles. Germany viewed the one-sided treaty as a humiliation and as [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|blaming it for the entire war]]. While the intent of the treaty was to assign guilt to Germany to justify financial reparations, the notion of blame took root as a political issue in German society and was never accepted by nationalists, although it was argued by some, such as German historian [[Fritz Fischer]]. The German government disseminated [[propaganda]] to further promote this idea, and funded the [[Centre for the Study of the Causes of the War]] to this end.\n\n132&nbsp;billion gold marks ($31.5&nbsp;billion, 6.6&nbsp;billion pounds) were demanded from Germany in reparations, of which only 50&nbsp;billion had to be paid. In order to finance the purchases of foreign currency required to pay off the reparations, the new German republic printed tremendous amounts of money \u2013 to disastrous effect. [[Hyperinflation]] plagued Germany between 1921 and 1923. In this period the worth of [[fiat money|fiat]] [[German Papiermark|Papiermark]]s with respect to the earlier [[commodity money|commodity]] [[German gold mark|Goldmark]]s was reduced to one trillionth (one million millionth) of its value.<ref>Table IV (page 441) of ''The Economics of Inflation'' by Costantino Bresciani-Turroni, published 1937.<!--File:GermanyHyperChart.jpg--></ref> In December 1922 the Reparations Commission declared Germany in default, and on 11 January 1923 French and Belgian troops [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied the Ruhr]] until 1925.\n\nThe treaty required Germany to permanently reduce the size of its army to 100,000 men, and destroy their tanks, air force, and U-boat fleet (her capital ships, moored at [[Scapa Flow]], were [[Scuttling of the German fleet at Scapa Flow|scuttled by their crews]] to prevent them from falling into Allied hands).\n\nGermany saw relatively small amounts of territory transferred to Denmark, Czechoslovakia, and Belgium, a larger amount to France (including the temporary French occupation of the Rhineland) and the greatest portion as part of a reestablished Poland. Germany's overseas colonies were divided between a number of Allied countries, most notably the United Kingdom in Africa, but it was the loss of the territory that composed the newly independent Polish state, including the German city of [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]] and the separation of East Prussia from the rest of Germany, that caused the greatest outrage. Nazi propaganda would feed on a general German view that the treaty was unfair \u2013 many Germans never accepted the treaty as legitimate, and lent their political support to [[Adolf Hitler]].\n\n===Russian Empire===\n[[File:Russian civil war west.svg|thumb|European theatre of the [[Russian Civil War]] in 1918\u201319]]\n{{See also|Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War}}\nThe Soviet Union benefited from Germany's loss, as one of the first terms of the armistice was the abrogation of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]. At the time of the armistice Russia was in the grips of a [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] which left more than seven million people dead and large areas of the country devastated. The nation as a whole suffered socially and economically.\n\n[[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] gained independence. They were occupied again by the Soviet Union in 1940.\n\n[[Finland]] gained a lasting independence, though she repeatedly had to [[Winter War|fight]] the Soviet Union for her borders.\n\n[[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and [[Azerbaijan]] were established as independent states in the Caucasus region. However, after withdrawal of Russian army in 1917 and during [[Turkish Invasion of Armenia (1920)|1920 Turkish invasion of Armenia]], Turkey captured the Armenian territory around [[Artvin]], [[Kars]], and [[Igdir]], and these territorial losses became permanent.  As consequence of invasions of Turkey and Russian Red Army all three Transcaucasian countries were proclaimed as Soviet Republics in 1920 and over time were absorbed into the Soviet Union.\n\n[[Romania]] gained [[Bessarabia]] from Russia.\n\nThe Russian concession in [[Tianjin]] was occupied by the Chinese in 1920; in 1924 the Soviet Union renounced its claims to the district.\n\n===Austria-Hungary=== <!-- This section is linked from [[Austria-Hungary]] -->\n{{Essay-like|section|date=December 2009}}\n{{Main|Treaty of Trianon|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)}}\n\nWith the war having turned decisively against the [[Central Powers]], the people of [[Austria-Hungary]] lost faith in their allied countries, and even before the armistice in November, radical [[nationalism]] had already led to several [[Declaration of independence|declarations of independence]] in south-central Europe after November 1918. As the central government had ceased to operate in vast areas, these regions found themselves without a government and many new groups attempted to fill the void. During this same period, the population was facing food shortages and was, for the most part, demoralized by the losses incurred during the war. Various political parties, ranging from ardent nationalists, to social democrats, to communists attempted to set up governments in the names of the different nationalities. In other areas, existing nation states such as [[Romania]] engaged regions that they considered to be theirs. These moves created de facto governments that complicated life for diplomats, idealists, and the Western allies.\n\nThe Western forces were officially supposed to occupy the old Empire, but rarely had enough troops to do so effectively. They had to deal with local authorities who had their own agenda to fulfill. At the peace conference in Paris the diplomats had to reconcile these authorities with the competing demands of the nationalists who had turned to them for help during the war, the strategic or political desires of the Western allies themselves, and other agendas such as a desire to implement the spirit of the Fourteen Points.\n\nFor example, in order to live up to the ideal of self-determination laid out in the Fourteen Points, Germans, whether Austrian or German, should be able to decide their own future and government. However, the French especially were concerned that an expanded Germany would be a huge security risk. Further complicating the situation, delegations such as the Czechs and Slovenians made strong claims on some German-speaking territories.\n\nThe result was treaties that compromised many ideals, offended many allies, and set up an entirely new order in the area. Many people hoped that the new nation states would allow for a new era of prosperity and peace in the region, free from the bitter quarrelling between nationalities that had marked the preceding fifty years. This hope proved far too optimistic. Changes in territorial configuration after World War I included:\n\n* Establishment of the [[German Austria|Republic of German Austria]] and the [[Hungarian Democratic Republic]], disavowing any continuity with the empire and exiling the [[Habsburg]] family in perpetuity.\n* Borders of newly independent Hungary did not include two-thirds of the lands of the former [[Kingdom of Hungary]], including areas where the ethnic Magyars were in a majority. The new republic of Austria maintained control over most of the predominantly German-controlled areas, but lost various other German majority lands in what was the [[Austrian Empire]].\n\n[[File:Dissolution of Austria-Hungary.png|right|thumb|300px|Division of [[Austria-Hungary]] after World War I]]\n\n* [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], [[Opava Silesia]] and the western part of the [[Duchy of Cieszyn]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] formed the new [[Czechoslovakia]].\n* [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], the eastern part of the [[Duchy of Cieszyn]], northern [[Orava (county)|County of Orava]] and northern [[Spisz]] were transferred to [[Republic of Poland|Poland]].\n* the Southern half of the [[County of Tyrol]] and [[Trieste]] were granted to [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].\n* [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia-Slavonia]], [[Kingdom of Dalmatia|Dalmatia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Syrmia]] [[Banat, Ba\u010dka and Baranja]] were joined with [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] to form the [[Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], later [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].\n* [[Transylvania]] and [[Bukovina]] became parts of [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]].\n* The Austro-Hungarian [[Concessions in Tianjin#Austro-Hungarian concession|concession]] in [[Tianjin]] was ceded to the Republic of China.\n\nThese changes were recognized in, but not caused by, the Treaty of Versailles. They were subsequently further elaborated in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] and the [[Treaty of Trianon]].\n\nThe 1919 treaties generally included guarantees of minority rights, but there was no enforcement mechanism.  The new states of eastern Europe mostly all had large ethnic minorities. Millions of Germans found themselves in the newly created countries as minorities. More than two million ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside of Hungary in Slovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia. Many of these national minorities found themselves in hostile situations because the modern governments were intent on defining the national character of the countries, often at the expense of the other nationalities.  The interwar years were hard for religious minorities in the new states built around ethnic nationalism. The [[Jew]]s were especially distrusted because of their minority religion and distinct subculture.  This was a dramatic come-down from the days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Although [[antisemitism]] had been widespread during Habsburg rule, Jews faced no official discrimination because they were, for the most part, ardent supporters of the multi-national state and the monarchy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Marsha L. Rozenblit|title=Reconstructing a National Identity: The Jews of Habsburg Austria During World War I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CVl3obLidUC&pg=PA163 |year=2004|publisher=Oxford UP|page=163|isbn=9780195176308}}</ref>\n\nThe economic disruption of the war and the end of the Austro-Hungarian [[customs union]] created great hardship in many areas. Although many states were set up as democracies after the war, one by one, with the exception of Czechoslovakia, they reverted to some form of authoritarian rule. Many quarreled amongst themselves but were too weak to compete effectively. Later, when Germany rearmed, the nation states of south-central Europe were unable to resist its attacks, and fell under German domination to a much greater extent than had ever existed in Austria-Hungary.\n\n===Ottoman Empire===<!-- This section is linked from [[Ottoman Empire]] -->\n{{Main|Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|Turkish War of Independence}}\n[[File:Treaty of S\u00e8vres 1920.svg|thumb|260px|Borders of Turkey according to the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] (1920) which was annulled and replaced by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] in 1923]]\nAt the end of the war, the Allies [[Occupation of Constantinople|occupied Constantinople]] ([[\u0130stanbul]]) and the Ottoman government collapsed. The [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]], designed to repair damage caused by Ottomans during the war to the winning Allies, was signed by Ottoman Empire on 10 August 1920, but was never ratified by the Sultan.\n\nThe [[occupation of Smyrna]] by Greece on 18 May 1919 triggered a nationalist movement to rescind the terms of the treaty. [[Turkish National Movement|Turkish revolutionaries]] led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], a successful Ottoman commander, rejected the terms enforced at S\u00e8vres and under the guise of General Inspector of the Ottoman Army, left Istanbul for [[Samsun]] to organize the remaining Ottoman forces to resist the terms of the treaty. On the eastern front, after the [[Turkish\u2013Armenian War|invasion of Armenia in 1920]] and signing of the [[Treaty of Kars]] with the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian S.F.S.R.]] Turkey took over territory lost to Armenia and post-Imperial Russia.<ref name=\"kars=text\">{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.amsi.ge/istoria/sab/yarsi.html Text of the Treaty of Kars] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070424044332/http://www.amsi.ge/istoria/sab/yarsi.html |date=2007-04-24 }}</ref>\n\nOn the western front, the growing strength of the Turkish nationalist forces led Greece, with the backing of Britain, to invade deep into [[Anatolia]] in an attempt to deal a blow to the revolutionaries. At the [[Battle of Dumlup\u0131nar]], the Greek army was defeated and forced into retreat, leading to the burning of Smyrna and the withdrawal of Greece from Asia Minor. With the nationalists empowered, the army marched on to reclaim Istanbul, resulting in the [[Chanak Crisis]] in which the British Prime Minister, [[David Lloyd George]], was forced to resign. After Turkish resistance gained control over Anatolia and Istanbul, the S\u00e8vres treaty was superseded by the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] which formally ended all hostilities and led to the creation of the modern [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]]. As a result, Turkey became the only power of World War I to overturn the terms of its defeat, and negotiate with the Allies as an equal.<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/turkey/13.htm Countrystudies \u2013 Turkey]</ref>\n\nLausanne Treaty formally acknowledged the new League of Nations mandates in the Middle East, the cession of their territories on the Arabian Peninsula, and British sovereignty over [[Cyprus]].

Parts of the Ottoman Empire on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] became part of what is today [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Yemen]]. The [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]] became a pivotal milestone in the creation of the modern Middle East, the result of which bore witness to the creation of new conflicts and hostilities in the region.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fromkin |first=David |authorlink=David Fromkin |year=1989 |title=A Peace to End All Peace: Creating the Modern Middle East 1914\u20131922 |location=New York |publisher=H.

Battles such as [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] for Australia and New Zealand, and [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge]] for Canada led to increased national pride and a greater reluctance to remain subordinate to Britain, leading to the growth of diplomatic autonomy in the 1920s. These battles were often decorated in propaganda in these nations as symbolic of their power during the war.  Colonies such as the [[British Raj]] (India) and [[Nigeria]] also became increasingly assertive because of their participation in the war. The populations in these countries became increasingly aware of their own power and Britain's fragility.\n[[File:The Girl He Left Behind Him.jpg|alt=|thumb|Cartoon predicting the aftermath of the war by Henry J. Glintenkamp, first published in ''[[The Masses]]'' in 1914]]\n\nIn [[Ireland]], the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|delay]] in finding a resolution to the [[home rule#Ireland|Home Rule issue]], exacerbated by the Government's [[Easter Rising#Aftermath|severe response]] to the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] and its failed attempt to introduce [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|conscription in Ireland in 1918]], led to an increased support for separatist radicals. This led indirectly to the outbreak of the [[Irish War of Independence]] in 1919. The creation of the [[Irish Free State]] that followed this conflict in effect represented a territorial loss for the UK that was all but equal to the loss sustained by Germany, (and furthermore, compared to Germany, a much greater loss in terms of its ratio to the country's prewar territory). Despite this, the Irish Free State remained a [[dominion]] within the [[British Empire]].\n\nAfter World War I, [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom#First World War|women over 30 gained the right to vote]] since, during the war, they had had to occupy what were previously categorized as \"men's jobs\", thus showing the government that women were not as weak and incompetent as they thought.\n\n===United States===\n\nWhile disillusioned by the war, it having not achieved the high ideals promised by President [[Woodrow Wilson]], American [[International Chamber of Commerce|commercial interests]] did finance Europe's rebuilding and reparation efforts in Germany, at least until the onset of the [[Great Depression]]. American opinion on the propriety of providing aid to Germans and Austrians was split, as evidenced by an exchange of correspondence between [[Edgar Gott]], an executive with [[Boeing|The Boeing Company]] and Charles Osner, chairman of the Committee for the Relief of Destitute Women and Children in Germany and Austria. Gott argued that relief should first go to citizens of countries that had suffered at the hands of the [[Central Powers]], while Osner made an appeal for a more universal application of humanitarian ideals.<ref>Kuhlman, Erika A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=t7139hAmM6AC&pg=PA120&dq=edgar+gott&hl=en&sa=X&ei=pppwUYHlAsqNqgG2sIFI&sqi=2&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=edgar%20gott&f=false Of Little Comfort]. 2012. pp.&nbsp;120\u2013121.</ref> The American economic influence allowed the Great Depression to start a domino effect, pulling Europe in as well.\n\n===France===\n[[File:French enter Essen.jpg|thumb|French cavalry entering [[Essen]] during the occupation of the Ruhr.]]\n[[Alsace-Lorraine]] returned to France, the region which had been ceded to Prussia in 1871 after the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. At the 1919 Peace Conference, Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]]'s aim was to ensure that Germany would not seek revenge in the following years. To this purpose, the chief commander of the Allied forces, Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]], had demanded that for the future protection of France the [[Rhine]] river should now form the border between France and Germany. Based on history, he was convinced that Germany would again become a threat, and, on hearing the terms of the Treaty of Versailles that had left Germany substantially intact, he observed that \"This is not Peace. It is an Armistice for twenty years.\"\n\nThe destruction brought upon French territory was to be indemnified by the [[World War I reparations|reparations]] negotiated at Versailles. This financial imperative dominated France's foreign policy throughout the 1920s, leading to the 1923 [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] in order to force Germany to pay. However, Germany was unable to pay, and obtained support from the United States. Thus, the [[Dawes Plan]] was negotiated after Prime Minister [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]]'s occupation of the Ruhr, and then the [[Young Plan]] in 1929.\n\nAlso extremely important in the War was the participation of [[French colonial troops]] (who amounted for around 10% of the total number of troops deployed by France across the war), including the Senegalese ''[[tirailleur]]s'', and troops from [[French Indochina|Indochina]], North Africa, and [[Madagascar]]. When these soldiers returned to their homelands and continued to be treated as second class citizens, many became the nuclei of pro-independence groups.\n\nFurthermore, under the state of war declared during the hostilities, the French economy had been somewhat centralized in order to be able to shift into a \"[[war economy]]\", leading to a first breach with [[classical liberalism]].\n\nFinally, the socialists' support of the National Union government (including [[Alexandre Millerand]]'s nomination as Minister of War) marked a shift towards the [[French Section of the Workers' International]]'s (SFIO) turn towards social democracy and participation in \"bourgeois governments\", although [[L\u00e9on Blum]] maintained a socialist rhetoric.\n\n===Italy===\n[[File:Fiume cheering D'Annunzio.jpg|thumb|right|Residents of [[Fiume]] cheering D'Annunzio and his ''Legionari'', September 1919.

However, even if relations with [[Berlin]] became very friendly, the alliance with [[Vienna]] remained purely formal, as the Italians were keen to acquire [[Trentino]] and [[Trieste]], parts of the Austro-Hungarian empire populated by Italians.\n\nDuring [[World War I]] Italy aligned with the Allies, instead of joining Germany and Austria. This could happen since the alliance formally had merely defensive prerogatives, while the Central Empires were the ones who started the offensive. With the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]], Britain secretly offered Italy [[Trentino]] and [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] as far as [[Brenner, South Tyrol|Brenner]], [[Trieste]] and [[Istria]], all the [[Dalmatia]]n coast except [[Fiume]], full ownership of Albanian [[Vlor\u00eb|Valona]] and a protectorate over [[Italian protectorate over Albania|Albania]], [[Antalya]] in [[Turkey]] and a share of the [[Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] and [[German colonial empire#Confiscation|German colonial empire]], in exchange for Italy siding against the Central Empires{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}.\n \nAfter the victory, [[Vittorio Orlando]], Italy's [[President of the Council of Ministers of Italy|President of the Council of Ministers]], and [[Sidney Sonnino]], its [[Foreign Minister of Italy|Foreign Minister]], were sent as the Italian representatives to [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris]] with the aim of gaining the promised territories and as much other land as possible. In particular, there was an especially strong opinion about the status of [[Fiume]], which they believed was rightly Italian due to Italian population, in agreement with [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]], the ninth of which read:\n\t\t \t\t\n''\"A readjustment of the frontiers of Italy should be effected along clearly recognizable lines of nationality''\".\n\nNevertheless, by the end of the war the Allies realized they had made contradictory agreements with other Nations, especially regarding [[Central Europe]] and the [[Middle-East]]. In the meetings of the \"Big Four\", in which Orlando's powers of diplomacy were inhibited by his lack of English, the Great powers were only willing to offer [[Trentino]] to the [[Brenner, South Tyrol|Brenner]], the Dalmatian port of [[Zadar|Zara]], the island of [[Lastovo|Lagosta]] and a couple of small German colonies. All other territories were promised to other nations and the great powers were worried about Italy's imperial ambitions; Wilson, in particular, was a staunch supporter of Yugoslav rights on Dalmatia against Italy and despite the Treaty of London which he did not recognize.<ref>But perhaps the major hindrance to Italy's aims were the different opinions of Orlando and Sonnino: the first was decided to obtain Fiume and forsake Dalmatia, Sonnino did not mean to abandon Dalmatia and would have willingly left Fiume. This indecision proved fatal for Italy, which did not gain either of the territories.</ref> As a result of this, Orlando left the conference in a rage. This simply favored Britain and France, which divided among themselves the former Ottoman and German territories in Africa.<ref>(Jackson, 1938)</ref>\n\nIn Italy, the discontent was relevant: [[irredentists|Irredentism]] (see: ''[[Italian irredentism|irredentismo]]'') claimed Fiume and Dalmatia as Italian lands; many felt the Country had taken part in a meaningless war without getting any serious benefits. This idea of a \"mutilated victory\" (''[[Mutilated victory|vittoria mutilata]]'') was the reason which led to the ''[[Italian Regency of Carnaro#Impresa di Fiume|Impresa di Fiume]]'' (\"''Fiume Exploit''\"). On September 12, 1919, the nationalist poet [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] led around 2,600 troops from the [[Royal Italian Army]] (the [[Granatieri di Sardegna Mechanized Brigade|Granatieri di Sardegna]]), nationalists and irredentists, into a seizure of the city, forcing the withdrawal of the inter-Allied (American, British and French) occupying forces.\n \t\nThe \"mutilated victory\" (''[[Mutilated victory|vittoria mutilata]]'') became an important part of [[Italian Fascism]] propaganda.\n\n===China===\nThe [[Republic of China (1912-49)|Republic of China]] had been one of the Allies; during the war, it had sent [[Chinese Labour Corps|thousands of labourers]] to France. At the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference in 1919]], the Chinese delegation called for an end to Western imperialistic institutions in China, but was rebuffed. China requested at least the formal restoration of its territory of [[Jiaozhou Bay]], under German colonial control since 1898. But the western Allies rejected China's request, instead granting transfer to Japan of all of Germany's pre-war territory and rights in China. Subsequently, China did not sign the Treaty of Versailles, instead signing a separate peace treaty with Germany in 1921.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian and German [[concessions in Tianjin]] were placed under the administration of the Chinese government; in 1920 they occupied the Russian area as well.\n\nThe western Allies' substantial accession to Japan's territorial ambitions at China's expense led to the [[May Fourth Movement]] in China, a social and political movement that had profound influence over subsequent Chinese history. The May Fourth Movement is often cited as the birth of [[Chinese nationalism]], and both the [[Kuomintang]] and [[Chinese Communist Party]] consider the Movement to be an important period in their own histories.\n\n===Japan===\nBecause of the treaty that Japan had signed with Great Britain in 1902, Japan was one of the Allies during the war. With British assistance, Japanese forces attacked Germany's territories in Shandong province in China, including the East Asian coaling base of the Imperial German navy. The German forces were defeated and surrendered to Japan in November 1914. The Japanese navy also succeeded in seizing several of Germany's island possessions in the Western Pacific: the [[Marianas]], [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]], and [[Marshall Islands]].\n\nAt the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference in 1919]], Japan was granted all of Germany's pre-war rights in [[Shandong]] province in China (despite China also being one of the Allies during the war): outright possession of the territory of [[Jiaozhou Bay]], and favorable commercial rights throughout the rest of the province, as well as a Mandate over the German Pacific island possessions that the Japanese navy had taken. Also, Japan was granted a permanent seat on the Council of the League of Nations. Nevertheless, the Western powers refused Japan's request for the inclusion of a [[Racial Equality Proposal, 1919|\"racial equality\" clause]] as part of the Treaty of Versailles.

The optimism of [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900]] was entirely gone and those who fought became what is known as \"the [[Lost Generation]]\" because they never fully recovered from their suffering. For the next few years, much of Europe mourned privately and publicly; memorials were erected in thousands of villages and towns.\n\nSo many British men of marriageable age died or were injured that the students of one girls' school were warned that only 10% would marry.{{r|cable200709015}}{{r|nicholson2008}}{{rp|20,245}} The 1921 [[United Kingdom Census]] found 19,803,022 women and 18,082,220 men in England and Wales, a difference of 1.72&nbsp;million which newspapers called the \"Surplus Two Million\".<ref name=\"nicholson2008\">{{cite book | title=Singled Out: How Two Million British Women Survived Without Men After the First World War | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Nicholson, Virginia | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-19-537822-1}}</ref>{{rp|22\u201323}} In the 1921 census there were 1,209 single women aged 25 to 29 for every 1,000 men.

Poison gas and the aerial bombing of civilians were new developments of the First World War. The British civilian population, for many centuries, had not had any serious reason to fear invasion. So the new threat of poison gas dropped from enemy bombers excited a grossly exaggerated view of the civilian deaths that would occur on the outbreak of any future war. Baldwin expressed this in his statement that \"[[The bomber will always get through]].\" The traditional British policy of a balance of power in Europe no longer safeguarded the British home population. Out of this fear came appeasement. It is notable that neither Baldwin nor [[Neville Chamberlain]] fought in the war, but the anti-appeasers [[Antony Eden]], [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[Winston Churchill]] did.\n\nOne gruesome reminder of the sacrifices of the generation was the fact that this was one of the first times in international conflict whereby more men died in battle than from disease, which was the main cause of deaths in most previous wars. The [[Russo-Japanese War]] was another conflict where battle deaths outnumbered disease deaths, but it was fought on a much smaller scale between just two nations.\n\nThis social trauma made itself manifest in many different ways. Some people were revolted by [[nationalism]] and what they believed it had caused, so they began to work toward a more [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] world through organizations such as the League of Nations. [[Pacifism]] became increasingly popular. Others had the opposite reaction, feeling that only military strength could be relied upon for protection in a chaotic and inhumane world that did not respect hypothetical notions of civilization. Certainly a sense of disillusionment and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] became pronounced. [[Nihilism]] grew in popularity. Many people believed that the war heralded the end of the world as they had known it, including the collapse of [[capitalism]] and [[imperialism]]. [[Communist]] and [[socialist]] movements around the world drew strength from this theory, enjoying a level of popularity they had never known before. These feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or particularly harshly affected by the war, such as central Europe, Russia and France.\n\nArtists such as [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]], [[Ernst Barlach]], and [[K\u00e4the Kollwitz]] represented their experiences, or those of their society, in blunt paintings and sculpture. Similarly, authors such as [[Erich Maria Remarque]] wrote grim novels detailing their experiences. These works had a strong impact on society, causing a great deal of controversy and highlighting conflicting interpretations of the war. In Germany, nationalists including the [[Nazism|Nazis]] believed that much of this work was [[Degenerate art|degenerate]] and undermined the cohesion of society as well as dishonoring the dead.\n[[Image:World-war-one-belgium-iron-harvest-fieldside.redvers.jpg|left|thumb|[[Iron harvest]] World War I ordnance left beside a field for disposal by the army in 2004 near [[Ypres]] in Belgium]]\n\n==Remains of ammunition==\n{{Main|Iron harvest}}\n\nThroughout the areas where trenches and fighting lines were located, such as the [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] region of France, quantities of [[unexploded ordnance]] have remained, some of which remains dangerous, continuing to cause injuries and occasional fatalities in the 21st century. Some are found by farmers ploughing their fields and have been called the [[iron harvest]]. Some of this ammunition contains [[chemical warfare|toxic]] chemical products such as [[mustard gas]]. Cleanup of major battlefields is a continuing task with no end in sight for decades to come. Squads remove, defuse or destroy hundreds of tons of unexploded ammunition from both World Wars every year in Belgium, France, and Germany.\n\n==Memorials==\n[[Image:Menin-gate-ypres-belgium.redvers.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Menin Gate Memorial]], in [[Ypres]], Belgium]]\n\n===War memorials===\n[[File:Noms 14-18 Draguignan.jpg|thumb|250px|World War I memorial in [[Draguignan]] France]]\nMany towns in the participating countries have [[war memorial]]s dedicated to local residents who lost their lives.
