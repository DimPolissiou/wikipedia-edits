She is the lead character on the [[ITV Network|ITV]] drama ''[[Footballers' Wives]]'', and also briefly appeared on the drama ''[[Bad Girls (TV series)|Bad Girls]]''. Tanya is portrayed by English actress [[Z\u00f6e Lucker]] and is the only character credited for the entire series from the [[List of Footballers' Wives episodes|pilot]] - apart from Jackie Pascoe, played by [[Gillian Taylforth]] - until its cancellation. Her role within the series changed frequently; throughout some storylines she is considered to be an [[antagonist]] whereas in others she is the main [[protagonist]].\n\nThe character is well known for her ruthless, cold and calculating behaviour. She is intelligent and independent and has been married three times, with each marriage resulting in her husband's death. American magazine ''[[TV Guide]]'' said \"You'd have to go all the way back to ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''{{'}}s [[Alexis Colby]] to find a saucier British TV import than Tanya Turner\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/zoe-lucker/278235|title=Zoe Lucker|website=TVGuide.com|accessdate=2 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nTanya was voted tenth in [[Virgin Media]]'s Top 10 TV criminals poll, for her involvement in the death of her second husband, Frank Laslett and for her frequent use of [[cocaine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginmedia.com/tvradio/galleries/trivia/top-ten-tv-criminals.php?ssid=10|title=Entertainment - Virgin Media|website=Virginmedia.com|accessdate=2 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Series One===\n{{Cquote|''Just a friendly warning for the future, you go anywhere near my husband again and it\u2019ll take more than [[Botox]] to sort your face out!''}}\nTanya was originally married to the womanising captain of Earls Park Football Club, Jason Turner ([[Cristian Solimeno]]). Their relationship was stormy yet very strong even though Tanya knew of Jason's extramarital flings. He slept with his team-mate Ian Walmsley's ([[Nathan Constance]]) young sister-in-law, Marie Minshall (Micaiah Dring), who was Jason's biggest fan. He considered leaving Tanya for her after several bust-ups, but came to his senses and dumped the girl he used for sex.\n\nIn episode one, Jason and Tanya discovered that the club's chairman, Frank Laslett ([[John Forgeham]]), had lied to them and secretly signed Italian striker Salvatore Biagi ([[Daniel Schutzmann]]), whom he planned to replace Jason as captain. Tanya lost her temper and attacked Frank after the event, causing him to hit his head on the side of his car, putting him in a coma. Tanya and Jason fled the scene, leaving Frank for dead, though he was found unconscious the next morning.\n\nMonths followed with a terrified guilty Tanya in pieces and spending every day and night in constant fear of Frank waking up. Visiting Frank religiously in hospital in fear of her guilt being made public, Tanya discovered nurse Jeanette Dunkley ([[Julie Legrand]]) raping a comatose Frank. In exchange for her silence, Jeanette agreed to convince Frank's ex-wife and son that Frank would never recover and it would be best to turn off the life-support machine. As everyone gathered to say goodbye to him, Tanya was stunned when Frank's hand twitched and he opened his eyes. Luckily for her, he remembered nothing about the incident that nearly cost his life and she hinted that they were having an affair so as to throw him off guard. She then paid Jeanette to disappear. This also gave her the chance to get Frank to reinstate Jason as team captain, although he lost it to Ian after some bad performances.\n\nAfter begging for Tanya's forgiveness for being a useless husband, Jason got back up to his old tricks and seduced Jackie Pascoe ([[Gillian Taylforth]]), mother of his teammate Kyle ([[Gary Lucy]]), who was about twice his age. She fell [[pregnancy|pregnant]] but an uninterested Jason told her to [[abortion|abort]] the baby, however she couldn't bring herself to do so (unknown to Jason), and when her daughter-in-law, Chardonnay ([[Susie Amy]]), discovered that she wasn't pregnant as previously believed, she decided to take on Jackie's child as her own to avoid humiliation.\n\nWhilst Tanya led Frank to believe he was in a secret relationship with her, Jason stormed in and started shouting, which brought back Frank's chilling memories of the night of his \"accident\".\n\n===Series Two===\nSeries 2 began with Tanya and her husband Jason in court, accused of Frank's attempted murder, but she lied her way out of it and there was no evidence as the nurse, Jeanette, has \"vanished\" into thin air. In the end, it was her word against Frank's and the case collapsed but Frank was determined to get his revenge.\n\nFurthermore, the Pascoes came home after Jackie secretly gave birth to Jason's son, Patrick \"Paddy\", in [[Florida]], USA.\n\nJason noticed Jackie's depressed attitude at a party, celebrating baby Paddy's birth, he was delighted when Kyle and Chardonnay made him and Tanya godparents, and followed Jackie into the house to confront her. After her breast milk leaked, he realised that Paddy was the child he thought she had terminated several months before. He became broody and decided he wanted children after all, and offered to ditch his troublesome marriage to set up home with Paddy and Jackie, who had started to get doubts about giving up the baby after noticing how Chardonnay used the child as a fashion accessory. When Jackie made it clear that she and Jason had no future, he decided to try and persuade Tanya to have children, even though he knew that she would refuse.\n\nAs the Turner marriage disintegrated further, Tanya and Jason's agent, Hazel Bailey ([[Alison Newman]]), came home from a party drunk, and after snorting cocaine, engaged in [[lesbian sex]]. Tanya was horrified and deeply regretted it the next morning as Jason walked through the front door.\n\nRealising that this could be the last chance to save her marriage, Tanya pretended to agree to try for a baby, taking [[contraception|birth control pills]] in secret. Jason made a grand gesture as godfather by putting a large sum of money in a bank account for Paddy but destroyed the account bank when he found out that the Pascoes had thrown Jackie out after they caught her breastfeeding the baby. The police gatecrashed the christening party, after Frank tipped them off about Tanya carrying drugs, and Tanya's handbag was emptied, revealing drugs and some pills. Jason decided to end their marriage once and for all, disgusted, and began divorce proceedings. She was interviewed by Chardonnay on her chat show and branded Jason as impotent, but he hit back by saying that he had fathered a baby.\n\nHe decided to sort out the mess once and for all and kidnapped Paddy from the Pascoe home, beating up Kyle when he tried to intervene after he announced he was the child's father. With no legal adoption papers, their case was hopeless and the press, wondering why Paddy hadn't been seen for such a while, questioned their parenting abilities.\n\nHowever, things changed when Jason cut all ties with baby Paddy after a doctor revealed that he was [[intersex]] after a [[womb]] and ovaries were found. Jason called his child a freak, and blew a fuse after a magazine was published with him, Chardonnay, Kyle, and Tanya dressed as with the bodies of the opposite sex stuck under their heads to try and show the world that they did not care about Paddy being a hermaphrodite. At this point, new, shy, teenage football player Darius Fry ([[Peter Ash]]) was besotted by Tanya, who seduced him on a number of occasions, before making him strip in the sauna and throwing him out of her house naked.\n\nJason then begged Tanya, who was revolted by her fine and community service at an old people's home cleaning false teeth and toilets due to her drug addiction, to reconcile after admitting to fathering Paddy. She agreed, and was stunned when blast from the past Jeanette turned up at the home. Jeanette blackmailed more cash out of Tanya and joined forces with Frank to prove that she put him in a coma and tried to get Jeanette to finish him off for good.\n\nDuring a meeting with Tanya, Jeanette who secretly wore a microphone underneath her top linked to Frank's headphones, started talking about how Tanya put Frank in a coma. Tanya, twigging that Jeanette had a plan with Frank, purposely diverted the conversation to Jeanette raping Frank in hospital, while Frank listened in horror. Jeanette knocked a glass of wine down her top and Tanya took this as her chance to finally move on from the incident that almost killed Frank by agreeing to put Jeanette into hiding by dying her hair grey and disguising her as a resident of the old people's home she worked at. Frank, now finally knowing for sure that Tanya almost murdered him, tracked Jeanette down by using her mobile phone signal and told her that she must help him make Tanya pay.\n\nJason and Tanya were arranging the renewing of their vows, when the philanderer bragged to his team-mates about having slept with the manager, Stefan Hauser ([[Philip Bretherton]]), deranged daughter, Freddie ([[Jessica Brooks]]). Darius, who was still besotted with Tanya and genuinely believed that he was the right man for her, had a go at Jason in the changing rooms, provoking the angry captain to threaten him. Chardonnay told Tanya that Jason had cheated yet again, and she went through with their renewing of vows right until the moment she was to say \"I do\", but she threw the ring across the room and told him that their marriage was over for good. Jason responded by punching her, however she told everyone to enjoy the reception. By now Jason was despised, particularly by Tanya, Salvatore, Kyle, Chardonnay, Darius, Frank and Jackie. He was soon informed of his wife's indiscretion with Darius during their separation, and got drunk on the roof of the building. He began to shout at an unseen character (later revealed to be Chardonnay), and fell off the edge of the roof, hanging on by one hand. He begged Chardonnay to help him, but she picked up an empty bottle and whacked it hard on Jason's fingers, causing him to let go of the roof and fall to his death.\n\n===Series Three===\nThe series opened with a funeral, assumed to be Jason's, although it turned out to be Chardonnay's when a glass coffin with her name on in large crystal letters appeared from the back of a funeral car. Her widower, Kyle, bore her secret &mdash; she had killed Jason, and then battled with [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]] due to the pressure of her guilt, which eventually led to her death. Jason, however, was ruled in court to have committed suicide.\n\nEvents in Tanya's life also took a surprising turn. Despite previously having hated Frank Laslett, who had agreed to drop all charges in favour of their new business arrangement, Tanya, having been left a string of debts by her late husband, Jason, married him in a business settlement. Of course Frank demanded more than just an arrangement, and Tanya began to cringe during sexual encounters with her new husband, and it seemed that Frank's revenge was coming in a different form.\n[[File:Tanya Turner mile high.jpg|thumb|left|190px|The highly controversial [[Mile high club|mile high]] scene between Tanya and Conrad was dubbed \"the sexiest ever scene on British television\" by ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2008/07/26/zoe-lucker-i-don-t-want-my-child-to-see-my-tv-sex-scenes-115875-20672105/|title=Zoe Lucker: I don't want my child to see my TV sex scenes|website=Mirror.co.uk|date=25 July 2008|accessdate=2 December 2017}}</ref>]]\nTanya, meanwhile, began an affair with new signing, [[Conrad Gates]], a [[bisexuality|bisexual]] who had always shared an open relationship with [[Bollywood]] star wife, Amber. It became clear to an extremely jealous Amber, who loathed Tanya, that the fling she urged her husband to end was becoming more serious. Tanya discovered that Conrad was also playing away with closet [[homosexual|gay]] team-mate, Noah, and after Conrad dumped him, she set him up with a [[rent boy]] and had the whole scene filmed and shown to the world to make sure he didn't get involved with Conrad again.\n\nAmber was then abducted and Conrad decided to cool his affair with Tanya, but she exposed Amber as a liar and that the kidnapping incident was set up to make Conrad finish with Tanya. The disgusted team captain decided to leave Amber and move in with Tanya after she watched Frank die of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] after realising that rampant sex wasn't good for his dodgy heart.\n\nLife became tough for Conrad and Tanya when Amber began stalking them, going as far as attempting to hang herself outside their front door. She found out that she was [[pregnancy|pregnant]], and Conrad asked her to move in with him and Tanya so he could keep a watchful eye on her. Not long after, Tanya was revealed to be in the [[pregnancy|family way]], and was devastated when a video of Frank was delivered to her by his lawyer, Mr Davis who said that frank had asked him to deliver it to her on receiving \"such happy news\". In the video Frank told Tanya that \"latex is so fragile and you were always so vigorous with me\", thus his condoms were very weak. Tanya got one of the remaining condoms from Frank's old drawer and filled it with water, only for the liquid to come shooting out of mini holes. She realised that Frank had been doing this all along and the unborn child could be his. After a row about Tanya having a baby and moving in with Conrad, Amber planted cocaine in Tanya's handbag.\n\n===''Bad Girls'': Series Six===\n[[File:Tanya Turner Bad Girls photo.jpg|right|thumb|125px|Tanya in Larkhall Prison on ''[[Bad Girls (TV series)|Bad Girls]]'']]\nTanya was sentenced to Larkhall prison for 5 years for possession of cocaine. This was her second offence, she was previously arrested for being in possession and sentenced to community service. However, this time, Tanya is innocent, the cocaine was planted in her handbag by her nemesis, [[Amber Gates]].\n\nTanya did a deal with [[gangster]] Rik Revoir \u2013 if she discovered the whereabouts of a stolen bag from its thief, fellow inmate Darlene Cake, he would arrange for someone to confess to planting the drugs on her. However, when Rik kidnapped Darlene's younger brother Terence and sent one of his severed toes into Larkhall, Tanya quickly realised that she was in over her head. But Rik was the least of her worries, because of the luxury hamper that was delivered shortly after her arrival on the wing, Tanya was considered by the police to be the prime suspect in the mass oxalic poisonings that resulted in Al McKenzie's death. But then luckily, the discovery of a stash of rhubarb hooch in the servery put her in the clear. Tanya conspired with Wing Governor Frances Myers to double-cross Rik. In exchange for leniency, Rik confessed to planting the cocaine in Tanya's handbag and she was released on bail pending an appeal.\n\n===Series Four===\nAmber is living with Conrad and Tanya and both women are getting on each other's tits, meanwhile Tanya is secretly worried about giving birth to Frank's baby, so with none other than former acquaintance Jeanette Dunkley's help, she drugs Amber to make her waters brake. As soon as Amber's waters broke, Tanya demanded a [[Cesarean section]] immediately while Conrad was in Spain. Certain she was carrying Frank's baby, she ordered Dunkley to swap the babies at birth, so if Amber's accusations of Tanya cheating and having a child with someone else went as far as paternity tests, the story wouldn't match since 'her' child would have Conrad's [[DNA]].\n\nThe truth eventually came out when, Pundarik, (Tanya's biological son) was smothered to death by Amber's pet dog, Krishna. Postmortem results revealed that the baby had been wearing [[sunless tanning|fake tan]] at the time of his death. Amber eventually realised what Tanya had done and ambushed the christening of Tanya's (biologically her) baby, Troy. Conrad attacked Tanya, attempted to strangle her only to be stopped by Amber  and then broke off their engagement, and Tanya left the show in episode four of series four in a helicopter. At the end of that episode, she was seen on a beach in [[Rio de Janeiro]] chatting up a fat, old, [[Brazil]]ian millionaire, which obviously hinted to the viewers what Tanya would've been getting up to in [[Brazil]].\n\nLater in the series, Conrad and Amber claimed custody of their son, Troy, now renamed Phoenix, but their joy was cut short when Conrad was accidentally shot dead by teammate Bruno Milligan when he mistook him for Giles Arrowsmith, the man who kidnapped Lucy and Angelica.\n\n===Series Five===\nTanya returned to the show in episode four. In typical Tanya fashion. In an airport talking to the ticket lady.\n*'''Lady:''' Are you travelling alone Mrs. Frederico?\n*'''Tanya:''' Correcto, one widow, one dead husband (shows the urn)\n*'''Lady:''' Window seat?\n*'''Tanya:''' I don't care where I'm sat as long as the champagne's on ice.\n*'''Lady:''' The flight departs in just under an hour.

I won't be needing that where I'm heading.\n\nIn the next episode, Tanya is getting on a plane when she sees new Earl's Park signing, Paulo Bardosa. She bribes the air hostess to let her sit next to him and he mistakes her for a giddy fan and is surprised when Tanya reveals she is a shareholder in Earl's Park. The plane runs into turbulence and Paulo comforts her during it. It becomes clear there is a very strong attraction between them. After landing in England, she is horrified to find that [[Eva de Wolffe]], an old [[magazine]] publisher, is actually Paulo's lover, (she thought she was his mother).\n\nThey meet again later that night at a restaurant and Eva gets Tanya's best seat and Eva makes bitchy remarks to Tanya, who overhears her bragging about her contract costing \u00a31.5 million to take photos for her magazine at Tremaine Gidigbi and Liberty Baker's wedding so Tanya asks Lucy for an invitation in order to get close to Paulo. After more bitchy remarks from Eva, she sneakily steals her shoes while Paulo massages her feet and pulls off the heels before placing them back where she took them and then edges on Eva for a fight, only for her to approach Tanya and go crashing into the waiter and his tray of drinks and falling to the floor.\n\nThe next day, Eva publishes an article showing Tanya eating away and smoking. They continue to feud at Trisha Watson's cancer appeal and they have an auction competition for a dinner with Paulo, but Eva wins (after Tanya continued to raise her bid to sums of cash that became obvious to the people surrounding that it was all just part of a bitter feud between the pair) and gives it to Trisha. At the opera, Tanya follows Paulo and Eva in the opposite box, Eva finds Tanya and Paulo together having sex and demands he comes home. When he refuses to move, Eva says something to him in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], calling him Marchello, and he just goes with her as though being mesmerised.\n\nAt her mansion, Eva goes crazy at Paulo and makes him say sorry. After doing so, an unsatisfied Eva shouts \"Sorry what?!\", to which Paulo responds \"Sorry mama\". Tanya realises that something isn't right and searches Eva de Wolffe on the [[Internet]] and sees pictures of her in poor countries helping abandoned and orphaned children, and realised that the boy in a picture underneath which read 'Marchello', was actually Paulo, and discovered that Eva had adopted him.\n\nMeanwhile, viewers have seen that when Paulo is 'naughty', Eva handcuffs him and puts him in a cage to bring back the bad memories of the state he was in when Eva first rescued him. Tanya, by now, goes round to Eva's residence and confront her with the fact she was sleeping with her own son. Eva's indifferent words show how ruthless and sick-minded she is, especially since she expected Paulo to love her in more than just a motherly way for the rest of their lives. Tanya lures Paulo towards her, but Eva hits him with a [[rake (tool)|rake]] and tries to strangle Tanya. She fails and Paulo resists her calls and goes off with Tanya. They move into a new home and have a housewarming party, in which drunken footballer Callum Watson makes a pass at her causing Paulo (who was coming up the stairs and saw this happening) to get a vase and smash up the house and Tanya's expensive [[sports car]], before begging her to punish him in front of all the guests. The next episode revealed that he'd been carted off to a psychiatric unit.\n\nIn the final episode of the series, club boss Garry Ryan makes several attempts to sleep with Tanya, although he is gunning for revenge when she makes it clear that she doesn't do old fat sleazeballs anymore. The next morning, she discovers that her dead Brazilian husband's properties and businesses (from which she gets her income) had been frozen as he was suspected to have been involved with fraud, leaving her penniless and unable to afford the rent on the new house. On the advice of her solicitor, she decides to sell her shares in Earl's Park. However, the stock in the company has fallen and she has to persuade Garry to buy them off her (although she had to sleep with him at his request). Because she previously rejected his sexual advances, he gets revenge on her by tricking her into buying some dodgy shares and she now loses all this money.\n\nTanya then discovers that Garry was linked to club manager Roger Webb's fatal fall down a lift shaft as the dictaphone that was, unknown to Garry, in Roger's pocket at the time of his death recorded their whole conversation (including details of Garry's attempt to rape Roger's wife, Jackie) and indicated that Garry had directed his blind former employee to the broken lift that caused his death, and tries to blackmail him with the dictaphone recording. They then arranged to meet in a Soho nightclub in a back room to sort out a pay off for Tanya to keep quiet, and as Garry offered Tanya a line of [[cocaine]], the camera slid slowly to underneath the table they were sitting at, and a shot of deadly poison came into view, leaving viewers with an end-of-series cliffhanger, and Tanya in a life or death situation.\n\n===Finale Spoof===\nOn 15 July 2006 the [[BBC]] aired what some people have considered to be the very last episode of Footballers Wives, however the episode is not considered canon to the series and was merely an episode aired to make money for charity. The episode ends with Tanya waking from a bed, claiming the last five series were all a dream. Tanya then blows up her flat in a freak accident when she lights her [[cigarette]], leaving Turner dead. This special was a six-minute, [[Canon (fiction)|non-canonical]] spoof, therefore none of its content is considered a tie-up to end the series.\n\n==Relationships==\nListed below is a full list, in chronological order of the men that Tanya had relationships with:\n\nJason Turner   (1st husband/ deceased) '''(premise - 2003)'''<br>\nFrank Laslett  (faux ex-affair '''(2003)'''/ 2nd husband/ deceased '''(2004)''')<br>\nDarius Fry     (ex-affair) '''(2002)'''<br>\nConrad Gates   (ex-affair '''(2004)'''/ broken engagement/deceased '''(2005)''')<br>\nJuan Federico  (3rd husband/ deceased) '''(2005-2006)'''<br>\nPaulo Bardosa  (ex-lover) '''(2006)'''\n\nPundarik Gates (son with Frank Laslett) (deceased) '''(2004)'''\n\n'''Note'''\n*Tanya and her husband Jason plotted for her to have an affair with Frank, in order for Jason to get his job back.\n*Tanya was run out of Europe by Conrad Gates & his wife, Amber Gates, following the revelation of Tanya's deceit.\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Footballers' Wives}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Turner, Tanya}}\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2002]]\n[[Category:Footballers' Wives]]\n[[Category:Fictional bisexual females]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Fictional English people]]\n[[Category:Fictional socialites]]\n[[Category:Fictional smokers]]\n[[Category:Fictional cocaine users]]\n[[Category:Fictional drug addicts]]\n[[Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n[[Category:Crossover characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=December 2017}}\n{{Infobox soap character\n| name             = Tanya Turner\n| image            = Tanya Turner photo.jpg\n| imagesize        = 200px\n| caption          = [[Z\u00f6e Lucker]] as Tanya Turner\n| series           = [[Footballers' Wives]]\n| first            = [[List of Footballers' Wives episodes|Getting a Result]] \n| last             = [[List of Footballers' Wives episodes|Finale]] \n| crossover        = [[Bad Girls (TV series)|Bad Girls]] (Series 6) \n| siblings         = Anika Beevor <small>(half-sister)</small>\n| spouse           = Jason Turner (1994\u20132002)<br>Frank Laslett (2003\u20132004)<br>Juan Frederico (2005\u20132006)\n| children         = [[Amber Gates|Pundarik Gates]]\n| grandchildren    = \n| grandparents     = \n| aunts/uncles     = \n| nieces/nephews   =\n| cousins          = \n| relatives        = \n| gender           = [[Female]]\n| portrayer        = [[Z\u00f6e Lucker]]\n| creator          = Maureen Chadwick<br>Ann McManus\n}}\n'''Tanya Louise Turner-Frederico''' (also '''Laslett''') is a [[fictional character|fictional television character]]. She is the lead character on the [[ITV Network|ITV]] drama ''[[Footballers' Wives]]'', and also briefly appeared on the drama ''[[Bad Girls (TV series)|Bad Girls]]''. Tanya is portrayed by English actress [[Z\u00f6e Lucker]] and is the only character credited for the entire series from the [[List of Footballers' Wives episodes|pilot]] - apart from Jackie Pascoe, played by [[Gillian Taylforth]] - until its cancellation. Her role within the series changed frequently; throughout some storylines she is considered to be an [[antagonist]] whereas in others she is the main [[protagonist]].\n\nThe character is well known for her ruthless, cold and calculating behaviour. She is intelligent and independent and has been married three times, with each marriage resulting in her husband's death. American magazine ''[[TV Guide]]'' said \"You'd have to go all the way back to ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''{{'}}s [[Alexis Colby]] to find a saucier British TV import than Tanya Turner\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/zoe-lucker/278235|title=Zoe Lucker|website=TVGuide.com|accessdate=2 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nTanya was voted tenth in [[Virgin Media]]'s Top 10 TV criminals poll, for her involvement in the death of her second husband, Frank Laslett and for her frequent use of [[cocaine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginmedia.com/tvradio/galleries/trivia/top-ten-tv-criminals.php?ssid=10|title=Entertainment - Virgin Media|website=Virginmedia.com|accessdate=2 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Series One===\n{{Cquote|''Just a friendly warning for the future, you go anywhere near my husband again and it\u2019ll take more than [[Botox]] to sort your face out!''}}\nTanya was originally married to the womanising captain of Earls Park Football Club, Jason Turner ([[Cristian Solimeno]]). Their relationship was stormy yet very strong even though Tanya knew of Jason's extramarital flings. He slept with his team-mate Ian Walmsley's ([[Nathan Constance]]) young sister-in-law, Marie Minshall (Micaiah Dring), who was Jason's biggest fan. He considered leaving Tanya for her after several bust-ups, but came to his senses and dumped the girl he used for sex.\n\nIn episode one, Jason and Tanya discovered that the club's chairman, Frank Laslett ([[John Forgeham]]), had lied to them and secretly signed Italian striker Salvatore Biagi ([[Daniel Schutzmann]]), whom he planned to replace Jason as captain. Tanya lost her temper and attacked Frank after the event, causing him to hit his head on the side of his car, putting him in a coma. Tanya and Jason fled the scene, leaving Frank for dead, though he was found unconscious the next morning.\n\nMonths followed with a terrified guilty Tanya in pieces and spending every day and night in constant fear of Frank waking up. Visiting Frank religiously in hospital in fear of her guilt being made public, Tanya discovered nurse Jeanette Dunkley ([[Julie Legrand]]) raping a comatose Frank. In exchange for her silence, Jeanette agreed to convince Frank's ex-wife and son that Frank would never recover and it would be best to turn off the life-support machine. As everyone gathered to say goodbye to him, Tanya was stunned when Frank's hand twitched and he opened his eyes. Luckily for her, he remembered nothing about the incident that nearly cost his life and she hinted that they were having an affair so as to throw him off guard. She then paid Jeanette to disappear. This also gave her the chance to get Frank to reinstate Jason as team captain, although he lost it to Ian after some bad performances.\n\nAfter begging for Tanya's forgiveness for being a useless husband, Jason got back up to his old tricks and seduced Jackie Pascoe ([[Gillian Taylforth]]), mother of his teammate Kyle ([[Gary Lucy]]), who was about twice his age. She fell [[pregnancy|pregnant]] but an uninterested Jason told her to [[abortion|abort]] the baby, however she couldn't bring herself to do so (unknown to Jason), and when her daughter-in-law, Chardonnay ([[Susie Amy]]), discovered that she wasn't pregnant as previously believed, she decided to take on Jackie's child as her own to avoid humiliation.\n\nWhilst Tanya led Frank to believe he was in a secret relationship with her, Jason stormed in and started shouting, which brought back Frank's chilling memories of the night of his \"accident\".\n\n===Series Two===\nSeries 2 began with Tanya and her husband Jason in court, accused of Frank's attempted murder, but she lied her way out of it and there was no evidence as the nurse, Jeanette, has \"vanished\" into thin air. In the end, it was her word against Frank's and the case collapsed but Frank was determined to get his revenge.\n\nFurthermore, the Pascoes came home after Jackie secretly gave birth to Jason's son, Patrick \"Paddy\", in [[Florida]], USA.\n\nJason noticed Jackie's depressed attitude at a party, celebrating baby Paddy's birth, he was delighted when Kyle and Chardonnay made him and Tanya godparents, and followed Jackie into the house to confront her. After her breast milk leaked, he realised that Paddy was the child he thought she had terminated several months before. He became broody and decided he wanted children after all, and offered to ditch his troublesome marriage to set up home with Paddy and Jackie, who had started to get doubts about giving up the baby after noticing how Chardonnay used the child as a fashion accessory. When Jackie made it clear that she and Jason had no future, he decided to try and persuade Tanya to have children, even though he knew that she would refuse.\n\nAs the Turner marriage disintegrated further, Tanya and Jason's agent, Hazel Bailey ([[Alison Newman]]), came home from a party drunk, and after snorting cocaine, engaged in [[lesbian sex]]. Tanya was horrified and deeply regretted it the next morning as Jason walked through the front door.\n\nRealising that this could be the last chance to save her marriage, Tanya pretended to agree to try for a baby, taking [[contraception|birth control pills]] in secret. Jason made a grand gesture as godfather by putting a large sum of money in a bank account for Paddy but destroyed the account bank when he found out that the Pascoes had thrown Jackie out after they caught her breastfeeding the baby. The police gatecrashed the christening party, after Frank tipped them off about Tanya carrying drugs, and Tanya's handbag was emptied, revealing drugs and some pills. Jason decided to end their marriage once and for all, disgusted, and began divorce proceedings. She was interviewed by Chardonnay on her chat show and branded Jason as impotent, but he hit back by saying that he had fathered a baby.\n\nHe decided to sort out the mess once and for all and kidnapped Paddy from the Pascoe home, beating up Kyle when he tried to intervene after he announced he was the child's father. With no legal adoption papers, their case was hopeless and the press, wondering why Paddy hadn't been seen for such a while, questioned their parenting abilities.\n\nHowever, things changed when Jason cut all ties with baby Paddy after a doctor revealed that he was [[intersex]] after a [[womb]] and ovaries were found. Jason called his child a freak, and blew a fuse after a magazine was published with him, Chardonnay, Kyle, and Tanya dressed as with the bodies of the opposite sex stuck under their heads to try and show the world that they did not care about Paddy being a hermaphrodite. At this point, new, shy, teenage football player Darius Fry ([[Peter Ash]]) was besotted by Tanya, who seduced him on a number of occasions, before making him strip in the sauna and throwing him out of her house naked.\n\nJason then begged Tanya, who was revolted by her fine and community service at an old people's home cleaning false teeth and toilets due to her drug addiction, to reconcile after admitting to fathering Paddy. She agreed, and was stunned when blast from the past Jeanette turned up at the home. Jeanette blackmailed more cash out of Tanya and joined forces with Frank to prove that she put him in a coma and tried to get Jeanette to finish him off for good.\n\nDuring a meeting with Tanya, Jeanette who secretly wore a microphone underneath her top linked to Frank's headphones, started talking about how Tanya put Frank in a coma. Tanya, twigging that Jeanette had a plan with Frank, purposely diverted the conversation to Jeanette raping Frank in hospital, while Frank listened in horror. Jeanette knocked a glass of wine down her top and Tanya took this as her chance to finally move on from the incident that almost killed Frank by agreeing to put Jeanette into hiding by dying her hair grey and disguising her as a resident of the old people's home she worked at. Frank, now finally knowing for sure that Tanya almost murdered him, tracked Jeanette down by using her mobile phone signal and told her that she must help him make Tanya pay.\n\nJason and Tanya were arranging the renewing of their vows, when the philanderer bragged to his team-mates about having slept with the manager, Stefan Hauser ([[Philip Bretherton]]), deranged daughter, Freddie ([[Jessica Brooks]]). Darius, who was still besotted with Tanya and genuinely believed that he was the right man for her, had a go at Jason in the changing rooms, provoking the angry captain to threaten him. Chardonnay told Tanya that Jason had cheated yet again, and she went through with their renewing of vows right until the moment she was to say \"I do\", but she threw the ring across the room and told him that their marriage was over for good. Jason responded by punching her, however she told everyone to enjoy the reception. By now Jason was despised, particularly by Tanya, Salvatore, Kyle, Chardonnay, Darius, Frank and Jackie. He was soon informed of his wife's indiscretion with Darius during their separation, and got drunk on the roof of the building. He began to shout at an unseen character (later revealed to be Chardonnay), and fell off the edge of the roof, hanging on by one hand. He begged Chardonnay to help him, but she picked up an empty bottle and whacked it hard on Jason's fingers, causing him to let go of the roof and fall to his death.\n\n===Series Three===\nThe series opened with a funeral, assumed to be Jason's, although it turned out to be Chardonnay's when a glass coffin with her name on in large crystal letters appeared from the back of a funeral car. Her widower, Kyle, bore her secret &mdash; she had killed Jason, and then battled with [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]] due to the pressure of her guilt, which eventually led to her death. Jason, however, was ruled in court to have committed suicide.\n\nEvents in Tanya's life also took a surprising turn. Despite previously having hated Frank Laslett, who had agreed to drop all charges in favour of their new business arrangement, Tanya, having been left a string of debts by her late husband, Jason, married him in a business settlement. Of course Frank demanded more than just an arrangement, and Tanya began to cringe during sexual encounters with her new husband, and it seemed that Frank's revenge was coming in a different form.\n[[File:Tanya Turner mile high.jpg|thumb|left|190px|The highly controversial [[Mile high club|mile high]] scene between Tanya and Conrad was dubbed \"the sexiest ever scene on British television\" by ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2008/07/26/zoe-lucker-i-don-t-want-my-child-to-see-my-tv-sex-scenes-115875-20672105/|title=Zoe Lucker: I don't want my child to see my TV sex scenes|website=Mirror.co.uk|date=25 July 2008|accessdate=2 December 2017}}</ref>]]\nTanya, meanwhile, began an affair with new signing, [[Conrad Gates]], a [[bisexuality|bisexual]] who had always shared an open relationship with [[Bollywood]] star wife, Amber. It became clear to an extremely jealous Amber, who loathed Tanya, that the fling she urged her husband to end was becoming more serious. Tanya discovered that Conrad was also playing away with closet [[homosexual|gay]] team-mate, Noah, and after Conrad dumped him, she set him up with a [[rent boy]] and had the whole scene filmed and shown to the world to make sure he didn't get involved with Conrad again.\n\nAmber was then abducted and Conrad decided to cool his affair with Tanya, but she exposed Amber as a liar and that the kidnapping incident was set up to make Conrad finish with Tanya. The disgusted team captain decided to leave Amber and move in with Tanya after she watched Frank die of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] after realising that rampant sex wasn't good for his dodgy heart.\n\nLife became tough for Conrad and Tanya when Amber began stalking them, going as far as attempting to hang herself outside their front door. She found out that she was [[pregnancy|pregnant]], and Conrad asked her to move in with him and Tanya so he could keep a watchful eye on her. Not long after, Tanya was revealed to be in the [[pregnancy|family way]], and was devastated when a video of Frank was delivered to her by his lawyer, Mr Davis who said that frank had asked him to deliver it to her on receiving \"such happy news\". In the video Frank told Tanya that \"latex is so fragile and you were always so vigorous with me\", thus his condoms were very weak. Tanya got one of the remaining condoms from Frank's old drawer and filled it with water, only for the liquid to come shooting out of mini holes. She realised that Frank had been doing this all along and the unborn child could be his. After a row about Tanya having a baby and moving in with Conrad, Amber planted cocaine in Tanya's handbag.\n\n===''Bad Girls'': Series Six===\n[[File:Tanya Turner Bad Girls photo.jpg|right|thumb|125px|Tanya in Larkhall Prison on ''[[Bad Girls (TV series)|Bad Girls]]'']]\nTanya was sentenced to Larkhall prison for 5 years for possession of cocaine.

Tanya, by now, goes round to Eva's residence and confront her with the fact she was sleeping with her own son. Eva's indifferent words show how ruthless and sick-minded she is, especially since she expected Paulo to love her in more than just a motherly way for the rest of their lives. Tanya lures Paulo towards her, but Eva hits him with a [[rake (tool)|rake]] and tries to strangle Tanya. She fails and Paulo resists her calls and goes off with Tanya. They move into a new home and have a housewarming party, in which drunken footballer Callum Watson makes a pass at her causing Paulo (who was coming up the stairs and saw this happening) to get a vase and smash up the house and Tanya's expensive [[sports car]], before begging her to punish him in front of all the guests. The next episode revealed that he'd been carted off to a psychiatric unit.\n\nIn the final episode of the series, club boss Garry Ryan makes several attempts to sleep with Tanya, although he is gunning for revenge when she makes it clear that she doesn't do old fat sleazeballs anymore. The next morning, she discovers that her dead Brazilian husband's properties and businesses (from which she gets her income) had been frozen as he was suspected to have been involved with fraud, leaving her penniless and unable to afford the rent on the new house. On the advice of her solicitor, she decides to sell her shares in Earl's Park. However, the stock in the company has fallen and she has to persuade Garry to buy them off her (although she had to sleep with him at his request). Because she previously rejected his sexual advances, he gets revenge on her by tricking her into buying some dodgy shares and she now loses all this money.\n\nTanya then discovers that Garry was linked to club manager Roger Webb's fatal fall down a lift shaft as the dictaphone that was, unknown to Garry, in Roger's pocket at the time of his death recorded their whole conversation (including details of Garry's attempt to rape Roger's wife, Jackie) and indicated that Garry had directed his blind former employee to the broken lift that caused his death, and tries to blackmail him with the dictaphone recording. They then arranged to meet in a Soho nightclub in a back room to sort out a pay off for Tanya to keep quiet, and as Garry offered Tanya a line of [[cocaine]], the camera slid slowly to underneath the table they were sitting at, and a shot of deadly poison came into view, leaving viewers with an end-of-series cliffhanger, and Tanya in a life or death situation.\n\n===Finale Spoof===\nOn 15 July 2006 the [[BBC]] aired what some people have considered to be the very last episode of Footballers Wives, however the episode is not considered canon to the series and was merely an episode aired to make money for charity. The episode ends with Tanya waking from a bed, claiming the last five series were all a dream. Tanya then blows up her flat in a freak accident when she lights her [[cigarette]], leaving Turner dead. This special was a six-minute, [[Canon (fiction)|non-canonical]] spoof, therefore none of its content is considered a tie-up to end the series.\n\n==Relationships==\nListed below is a full list, in chronological order of the men that Tanya had relationships with:\n\nJason Turner   (1st husband/ deceased) '''(premise - 2003)'''<br>\nFrank Laslett  (faux ex-affair '''(2003)'''/ 2nd husband/ deceased '''(2004)''')<br>\nDarius Fry     (ex-affair) '''(2002)'''<br>\nConrad Gates   (ex-affair '''(2004)'''/ broken engagement/deceased '''(2005)''')<br>\nJuan Federico  (3rd husband/ deceased) '''(2005-2006)'''<br>\nPaulo Bardosa  (ex-lover) '''(2006)'''\n\nPundarik Gates (son with Frank Laslett) (deceased) '''(2004)'''\n\n'''Note'''\n*Tanya and her husband Jason plotted for her to have an affair with Frank, in order for Jason to get his job back.\n*Tanya was run out of Europe by Conrad Gates & his wife, Amber Gates, following the revelation of Tanya's deceit.\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Footballers' Wives}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Turner, Tanya}}\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2002]]\n[[Category:Footballers' Wives]]\n[[Category:Fictional bisexual females]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Fictional English people]]\n[[Category:Fictional socialites]]\n[[Category:Fictional smokers]]\n[[Category:Fictional cocaine users]]\n[[Category:Fictional drug addicts]]\n[[Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n[[Category:Crossover characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSeries Four:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanya_Turner"}

[http://australiantelevision.net/kk/kathandkim.html ''Kath & Kim'': Episode Guide], Australian Television Information Archive.

The character in the American version was initially to have the name Debbie Cox and work with animals, but Szubanski, who had created Sharon, refused to permit adaptation for the show. <ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Personality==\n\n===Physical appearance and personal outlook===\n{{no footnotes|section|date= September 2018}}\n{{essay|section|date= September 2018}}\nSharon is obsessed with sport, and although she is overweight and short in stature, she demonstrates skill in netball and cricket. She wears her orange-brown hair in a [[bob haircut]]. Sharon lacks confidence; she always has her head down and at times seems depressed. Other times, she is cheerful and happy especially when she is playing netball. In the majority of episodes she wears her dull0blue netball cardigan with a white or pastel T-shirt; for special occasions, like Christmas or her wedding, she dresses up. Despite weight issues and inability to find love, Sharon doesn't have self-consciousness in the mirror, as directly opposed to [[Kim Craig|Kim]], who is either loving herself sick or self-conscious). Sharon appears as a great person on the inside, always caring for others despite the lack of love and care (for her) in her own life. In [[Kath & Kimderella]], Sharon goes on the [[Orlando Bloom]] diet and after going to the toilet loses a large amount of weight; during the show's hiatus, [[Magda Szubanski]] had gone on the [[Jenny Craig]] diet and lost a lot of weight. However Sharon is still fat (as told to by [[Kim Craig]]) and can't sing the [[Australia]]n national anthem. She enjoys eating [[KFC]] as seen in [[Da Kath & Kim Code]]. Sharon may be bisexual in [[Kath & Kimderella]] as she makes many comments that have to do with homosexuality like \u201cGet me out of the closet!\u201d. She is also seen reading biographies of famous lesbians like [[Jane Lynch]] and politician [[Penny Wong]]. In an Italian-clothing store she is seen asking Kath if a rainbow T-shirt looks good on her. In the film she is asked what team she plays on by an unknown female to whom she replies \u201cThe Sapphires\u201d (her netball team) and in the conclusion of the film she is seen with a younger female playing golf and gyrating against each other. She is oblivious to the homosexual references however and has a crush on the page, Elaine, who turns out to be gay.\n\n===Hobbies===\nSharon's main interest is sports, and sports uniforms (summer and winter) make up the entirety of her wardrobe. She is particularly active in [[netball]], where she is team captain of the Sapphires (and also the Unicorns only in season 2 \"my boyfriend\"), and [[indoor cricket]]. However, she is known to have golfed and to have participated in [[shot put]] at the national level. She often makes reference to it in the series, and says her mother (if she met her) would be \"pleased\" with her that she has found success in the Sporting Arena. Sharon also watches football, cricket and Rugby. She enjoys eating in addition, usually will barge into the ''Day'' residence and open up a box of snacks; which Kim walks in and scolds Sharon for stealing ''her'' snack. Sharon also takes an interest in Kim's (and occasionally Kath's) life, and often unquestioningly aids Kim in her bizarre and frivolous endeavours. Sharon has played Indoor Cricket in 4 different states.\n\n==Relationships==\n\n===Love life===\nSharon has a terrible love life, and is described by viewers and characters in the show as \"unlucky in love\", mainly by Kath who feels great compassion for Sharon. Sharon has come close to having relationships numerous times, each unsuccessful. In [[List of Kath & Kim (Australian TV series) episodes#Da Kath & Kim Code|''Da Kath & Kim Code'']] she was severely close to being married; however, at the end of the tele-movie she revealed that her fianc\u00e9e \"Marriat\" was in fact just spam on a computer website. Sharon had relationships with Kim's husband Brett (before and after their marriage) and has had a boyfriend previously, but he left her. It was revealed that Sharon uses chocolate to fill the need for love (as seen in the episode \"[[List of Kath & Kim (Australian TV series) episodes|Lust]]\").\n\n===Kim===\n[[File:Gina Riley at Kath & Kimderella movie premiere.jpg|thumb]]\nKim is Sharon's friend, however to Kim, Sharon is just her ''second'' best friend. The two have a very odd friendship. Sharon is always nice to Kim, being there for her and for her family; however Kim appears as rude, lazy and careless for Sharon (unless she wants something, as she says to Sharon: ''Sharon'', because you are my ''second'' best friend [and she continues on to say what she wants]). Kim is always belittling Sharon, calling her good-for-nothing and always lacks her ability in love (despite that it is evident she is correct at some points). Kim is extremely ambivalent that Sharon and Brett (Kim's husband), have a great friendship. Kim also takes advantage of Sharon's good nature, such as driving Kim and Epponnee-Rae to different places, even when she has better things to do.\n\n===Brett===\nBrett, or \"Bretty\" as Sharon likes to call him, is Kim's husband and a good friend of Sharon's. However, during the episode in which Epponnee-Rae was born\u2014it was revealed that Sharon and Brett used to date in high-school; however once Brett saw Kim (who showed him no feelings or affection) he turned away from Sharon. This saw the audience understand why Sharon dreams of being with Brett. In one episode, Sharon said that she wanted to have a child on her own using a donor, and hinted out she wanted Brett to be that person, stating \"I want a person who is the husband of a close friend...and has a baby like Epponnee Rae, to be the father.\" In the last season, Sharon and Brett slept together and Kim found them. It changed nothing, except demoting Sharon to Kim's \"sixth best friend\".\n\n===Romantic===\n[[Kath & Kim (Australian TV series)#Recurring characters|Mark]] is Sharon's ex-boyfriend. Mark sometimes shows Sharon he loves her, otherwise isn't very much interested her. They are on again and off again. Sharon nearly loses him to a Leggy River Dancer. Sharon took notice of Kel's friend (who steals all of his girlfriends) [[List of Kath & Kim characters|Sandy Freckle]], however Sandy (going for Kel's women usually) only notices Kath. Sharon also had a small romantic relationship with her co-hospital worker, Alan ([[Alan Brough]]), but they never had a serious relationship.\n\n===Kath Day-Knight===\n[[File:Jane Turner (Kath Day Knight) at Kath & Kimderella movie premiere.jpg|thumb|Kath Day-Knight]]\nSharon Strzelecki is Kath's daughter's best friend. During the series Kath and Sharon like each other, Kath is usually the one standing up for Sharon when Kim throws a tantrum at Sharon (usually concerning food). The only time Kath is seen throwing a tantrum at Sharon is when her drink was spiked in the episode \"Party\" and when she once told Sharon to get help before a volleyball game.\n\n===Kel Knight===\n[[File:Kel Knight (7879440288).jpg|thumb|Kel Knight]]\n\n===Wayne Shaun===\n[[List of Kath & Kim characters|Wayne Shaun]] (played by [[Shane Warne]]) is a Shane Warne impersonator to whom Sharon married. In the last episode, Sharon was waiting for Wayne to show up, but he appeared not to. He eventually did, and they married. At the end of the episode, Sharon walked into Kath's home depressed, stating that Wayne had bought a mobile phone. Their marriage seemed to have ended, however it is unknown. In the credits of the episode, Wayne was in the spa with Kath and Kim talking about how he can win Sharon back.\n\n==Family==\n\n===Parents===\nLittle is known of Sharon's parents and there is considerable discrepancy in terms of the continuity of the show's storyline on this issue. As far as Sharon's father is concerned, she laments in one episode that \u201che moved with his new family to tewantin.\u201d In another episode, after Kim and Brett are forced once again to move back in with Kath and Kel, Sharon shows up at the door and announces that she has lost her job and her apartment because her father (who presumably owned the place) came back to renovate and raise the rent. \n\nThings are even more muddled when it comes to Sharon's mother. In one episode of Series 1 (Hen's Night) Sharon and Kim have a squabble over the fact that Kim's hen's night (planned and hosted by Sharon) was not as good as it should have been because Sharon was conflicted by the need to care for her ill mother who, according to Kim, had a \u201cdicky pancreas\u201d at the time and didn't even bother to call and offer congratulations. To this Sharon replies that her mother was in a coma during the hen's night and had no access to a phone. Clearly, at this point in the show, Sharon's mother was envisioned as being very much a part of her daughter's adult life. A complete break of continuity with that idea is evidenced by a Series 3 episode in which Sharon states that her mother abandoned her as a baby and went to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] never to be seen or heard from again, and where her mother had presumably remarried and had given birth to a younger, previously unknown half-sister, Karen ([[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]]).\n\n===Karen===\n[[List of Kath & Kim characters|Karen]] Is Sharon's half sister. She has only made two appearances in the series. In the episode \"Roots\" in which Sharon set out a goal to meet her birth mother. She ended up finding out she had a sister Karen. Karen, portrayed by [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]] arrived in Melbourne as she was already in Australia modelling. She is a plus sized model and travels a lot. When Sharon met Karen, she brought Kim with her. Sharon was completely ignored by Karen, who spent all of her time being best friends with Kim. Before Karen left, she kissed Brett forcibly to which Kim nor Sharon reacted to. Before Sharon's marriage to Wayne\u2014she played a video message which Karen left for her. Karen stated that she would not attend Sharon's marriage Nuptials and also said that \"Even Though mother has never met you, She does hate you!\". Karen is treated like a [[princess]] (as she claims) by their mother and said she grew up with everything she ever wanted, making Sharon feel bad.\n\n==Quirks, personality traits and features==\nThere are several things Sharon says and does which feature repeatedly through the series. Several relate to Kath's [[fridge]]. Sharon often enters the house through the slide door, and heads straight to Kath's fridge and begins to eat whatever she can get her hands on (usually frankfurts). Frequently, she eats the last of Kim's Dippity Bix or fat-free Fruche. This causes Kim to exclaim \"Sharon! That was my last ___!\", to which Sharon responds \"Well, I didn't know, Kim!\" Kim finishes the gag with the line \"Well you never bloody know, Sharon!\"\n\nSharon is often seen with an injury of some sort, and regularly appears wearing a cast or splint, neck brace, eye patch, etc. On other occasions, she is shown with 'pash rash' (as [[Kim Craig|Kim]] calls it), boils, or carbuncles. Many of these injuries and afflictions are assumed to be incurred from playing sport. She has also broken her [[fibula]] five times.\n\nAs an avid cricket fan, she is a huge fan of [[Shane Warne]]. She is often seen reading his books and attempting \"the flipper\". In season four, she married a Shane Warne look-alike and during the morning of her wedding is seen with two pictures of Shane Warne, one picture of a younger Warne, the other, a matured, older one (which the lookalike resembled, although both pictures are obviously of Warne). When Sharon kisses somebody, red marks appear around her mouth and she has a smile on her face.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Strzelecki (disambiguation)]]\n\n===Other characters===\n*[[Kim Craig]]\n*[[Kath Day-Knight]]\n*[[Kel Knight]]\n*[[Brett Craig]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Kath and Kim}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Strzelecki, Sharon}}\n[[Category:Kath & Kim characters|Strzelecki,Sharon]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n[[Category:Fictional Australian people of Polish descent]]\n[[Category:Fictional bisexual females]]\n[[Category:Fictional people from Victoria (Australia)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Essay-like|date=December 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2013}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=January 2013}}\n{{Infobox character\n| colour = lavender \n| series = Kath & Kim\n| name = Sharon Karen Strzelecki\n| image = File:Sharon Strzelecki (7879439094).jpg \n| caption =[[Magda Szubanski]] as Sharon at the ''[[Kath & Kimderella]]'' film premiere \n| first = ''Big Girl's Blouse''\n| last = ''Kath & Kim''<br> 14 October 2007<br> Episode 32\n| creator = [[Magda Szubanski]]<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.samesame.com.au/news/international/2858/Kath-And-Kims-Sharon-Goes-Gay.htm Kath And Kim's Sharon Goes Gay on samesame.com.au<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926112709/http://www.samesame.com.au/news/international/2858/Kath-And-Kims-Sharon-Goes-Gay.htm |date=26 September 2010 }}</ref>\n| portrayer = [[Magda Szubanski]]\n| nickname = Shazza (Brett)\n| gender =  Female \n| occupation = [[Netball]] player <br /> [[Nurse]]\n| family = [[List of Kath & Kim characters|Karen]] (sister)<br> Caroline (mother)\n| spouse = [[List of Kath & Kim characters|Wayne Shaun]] 2007-2007<br>\n| \n}}\n\n'''Sharon Karen Strzelecki''' is an accident-prone [[fictional character]] on the Australian comedy series ''[[Kath & Kim (Australian TV series)|Kath & Kim]]'' and is portrayed by Australian actress [[Magda Szubanski]].<ref>Zuk, T.

The character in the American version was initially to have the name Debbie Cox and work with animals, but Szubanski, who had created Sharon, refused to permit adaptation for the show. <ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Personality==\n\n===Physical appearance and personal outlook===\n{{no footnotes|section|date= September 2018}}\n{{essay|section|date= September 2018}}\nSharon is obsessed with sport, and although she is overweight and short in stature, she demonstrates skill in netball and cricket. She wears her orange-brown hair in a [[bob haircut]]. Sharon lacks confidence; she always has her head down and at times seems depressed. Other times, she is cheerful and happy especially when she is playing netball. In the majority of episodes she wears her dull0blue netball cardigan with a white or pastel T-shirt; for special occasions, like Christmas or her wedding, she dresses up. Despite weight issues and inability to find love, Sharon doesn't have self-consciousness in the mirror, as directly opposed to [[Kim Craig|Kim]], who is either loving herself sick or self-conscious). Sharon appears as a great person on the inside, always caring for others despite the lack of love and care (for her) in her own life. In [[Kath & Kimderella]], Sharon goes on the [[Orlando Bloom]] diet and after going to the toilet loses a large amount of weight; during the show's hiatus, [[Magda Szubanski]] had gone on the [[Jenny Craig]] diet and lost a lot of weight. However Sharon is still fat (as told to by [[Kim Craig]]) and can't sing the [[Australia]]n national anthem. She enjoys eating [[KFC]] as seen in [[Da Kath & Kim Code]]. Sharon may be bisexual in [[Kath & Kimderella]] as she makes many comments that have to do with homosexuality like \u201cGet me out of the closet!\u201d. She is also seen reading biographies of famous lesbians like [[Jane Lynch]] and politician [[Penny Wong]]. In an Italian-clothing store she is seen asking Kath if a rainbow T-shirt looks good on her. In the film she is asked what team she plays on by an unknown female to whom she replies \u201cThe Sapphires\u201d (her netball team) and in the conclusion of the film she is seen with a younger female playing golf and gyrating against each other. She is oblivious to the homosexual references however and has a crush on the page, Elaine, who turns out to be gay.\n\n===Hobbies===\nSharon's main interest is sports, and sports uniforms (summer and winter) make up the entirety of her wardrobe. She is particularly active in [[netball]], where she is team captain of the Sapphires (and also the Unicorns only in season 2 \"my boyfriend\"), and [[indoor cricket]]. However, she is known to have golfed and to have participated in [[shot put]] at the national level. She often makes reference to it in the series, and says her mother (if she met her) would be \"pleased\" with her that she has found success in the Sporting Arena. Sharon also watches football, cricket and Rugby. She enjoys eating in addition, usually will barge into the ''Day'' residence and open up a box of snacks; which Kim walks in and scolds Sharon for stealing ''her'' snack. Sharon also takes an interest in Kim's (and occasionally Kath's) life, and often unquestioningly aids Kim in her bizarre and frivolous endeavours.

In 1937, Carrington met Ernst at a party held in London. The artists bonded and returned together to Paris, where Ernst promptly separated from his wife. In 1938, leaving Paris, they settled in [[Saint-Martin-d'Ard\u00e8che|Saint Martin d'Ard\u00e8che]] in southern France. The new couple collaborated and supported each other's artistic development. The two artists created sculptures of guardian animals (Ernst created his birds and Carrington created a plaster horse head) to decorate their home in Saint Martin d'Ard\u00e8che. In 1939, Carrington painted a ''Portrait of Max Ernst'' as a capture of some ambivalences in their relationship.<ref name=\"aberth\"/> This portrait was not her first Surrealist work though. Before that, between 1937\u20131938, Leonora painted [[Self-Portrait (Inn of the Dawn Horse)|''Self-portrait'']] also called ''The Inn of the Dawn Horse''. It is now exhibited in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Sporting white jodhpurs and a wild mane of hair, Carrington is perched on the edge of a chair in this curious, dreamlike scene, with her hand outstretched toward the prancing hyena and her back to the tailless rocking horse flying behind her.\n\n[[File:Patio_barca_garzas.jpg|thumb|left|250px|\"La barca de las garzas\" (The boat of the herons).]]\nWith the outbreak of [[World War II]] Ernst, who was German, was arrested by the French authorities for being a \"hostile alien\". With the intercession of [[Paul \u00c9luard]], and other friends, including the American journalist [[Varian Fry]], he was discharged a few weeks later. Soon after the Nazis invaded France, Ernst was arrested again, this time by the [[Gestapo]], because his art was considered by the Nazis to be \"[[Degenerate art|degenerate]]\". He managed to escape and, leaving Carrington behind, fled to America with the help of [[Peggy Guggenheim]], who was a sponsor of the arts.<ref>[http://www.abcgallery.com/E/ernst/ernstbio.html Max Ernst profile]; accessed online 21 July 2007.</ref>\n\nAfter Ernst's arrest, Carrington was devastated and fled to Spain. Paralyzing anxiety and growing delusions culminated in a final breakdown at the British Embassy in Madrid. Her parents intervened and had her hospitalised. She was given \"[[convulsive therapy]]\" and was treated with the drugs [[cardiazol]], a powerful [[anxiolytic]] drug (eventually banned by some authorities, including the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|US Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)), and [[phenobarbital|Luminal]], a [[barbiturate]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Gaensbauer|last=Gaensbauer|first=Deborah|page=275}}</ref> After being released into the care of a nurse who took her to [[Lisbon]], Carrington ran away and sought refuge in the Mexican Embassy. Meanwhile, Ernst had married Peggy Guggenheim in New York in 1941. That marriage ended a few years later. Ernst and Carrington never resumed their relationship.\n\n==Mexico==\n[[File:Cocodrilo LeonoraCarrington.jpg|thumbnail|''Cocodrilo'' on [[Paseo de la Reforma]].The statue was donated to Mexico City by Carrington in 2000 and was moved to its current location in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cocodrilo, de Leonora Carrington, posa en su nuevo lecho de agua sobre Reforma|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2006/03/19/index.php?section=sociedad&article=049n1soc|website=La Jornada|publisher=UNAM|accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref>]]\nFollowing the escape to Lisbon, Carrington arranged passage out of Europe with [[Renato Leduc]], a Mexican Ambassador.

She instead focused on magical realism and alchemy and used autobiographical detail and symbolism as the subjects of her paintings. Carrington was interested in presenting female sexuality as she experienced it, rather than as that of male surrealists\u2019 characterization of female sexuality.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chadwick|first1=Whitney|title=Women, Art, and Society|date=2012|publisher=Thames & Hudson|location=New York|edition=5}}</ref> Carrington's work of the 1940s is focused on the underlying theme of women's role in the creative process.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nCarrington's work is identified and compared with the surrealist movement. Within the surrealist movement, there was a strong exploration of  the women's body combining the mysterious forces of nature combined. During this time women artists correlated the woman figure with creative nature while using ironic stances.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Thames & Hudson|first=|title=Women, Art & Society|publisher=Thames & Hudson Inc.|year=1990|isbn=9780500204054|location=London|pages=183}}</ref>\n\nWhen painting, she used small brushstroke techniques building up layers in a meticulous manner, creating rich imagery.\n\nIn ''Self-Portrait'' (1938), Carrington offers her own interpretation of female sexuality by looking toward her own sexual reality rather than theorizing on the subject, as was custom by other Surrealists in the movement. Carrington's move away from the characterization of female sexuality subverted the traditional male role of the Surrealist movement. ''Self-Portrait'' (1937\u201338) also offers insight into Carrington's interest in the \u2018alchemical transformation of matter and her response to the Surrealist cult of desire as a source of creative inspiration.\u2019<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />  ''Self Portrait''  further explores the duality that comes with being a woman.

In 1935, she attended the [[Chelsea College of Arts|Chelsea School of Art]] in London for one year, and with the help of her father's friend [[Serge Chermayeff]], she was able to transfer to the Ozenfant Academy of Fine Arts established by the French modernist [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Ozenfant]] in London (1936\u201338).<ref name=\"aberth\"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/27/arts/design/leonora-carrington-surrealist-dies-at-94.html|title=Leonora Carrington, Surrealist, Dies at 94|last=Grimes|first=William|date=2011-05-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-11|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nShe became familiar with [[Surrealism]] from a copy of [[Herbert Read]]'s book, ''Surrealism'' (1936), which was given to her by her mother,<ref name=\"William Grimes\"/> but she received little encouragement from her family to forge an artistic career. The [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] poet and patron [[Edward James]] was the champion of her work in Britain; James bought many of her paintings and arranged a show in 1947 for her work at [[Pierre Matisse]]'s Gallery in New York. Some works are still hanging at James' former family home, currently [[West Dean College]] in [[West Dean, West Sussex]].<ref>[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1981212,00.html#article_continue Leonora and me] (accessed online 4 April 2008)</ref>\n\n==Association with Max Ernst==\n[[File:Leonora Carrington MET (3470458844).jpg|thumb|''[[Self-Portrait (Inn of the Dawn Horse)]]'']]\nIn 1936, Leonora saw the work of the [[German People|German]] [[surrealist]] [[Max Ernst]] at the [[International Surrealist Exhibition]] in London and was attracted to the Surrealist artist before she even met him. In 1937, Carrington met Ernst at a party held in London. The artists bonded and returned together to Paris, where Ernst promptly separated from his wife. In 1938, leaving Paris, they settled in [[Saint-Martin-d'Ard\u00e8che|Saint Martin d'Ard\u00e8che]] in southern France. The new couple collaborated and supported each other's artistic development. The two artists created sculptures of guardian animals (Ernst created his birds and Carrington created a plaster horse head) to decorate their home in Saint Martin d'Ard\u00e8che. In 1939, Carrington painted a ''Portrait of Max Ernst'' as a capture of some ambivalences in their relationship.<ref name=\"aberth\"/> This portrait was not her first Surrealist work though. Before that, between 1937\u20131938, Leonora painted [[Self-Portrait (Inn of the Dawn Horse)|''Self-portrait'']] also called ''The Inn of the Dawn Horse''. It is now exhibited in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Sporting white jodhpurs and a wild mane of hair, Carrington is perched on the edge of a chair in this curious, dreamlike scene, with her hand outstretched toward the prancing hyena and her back to the tailless rocking horse flying behind her.\n\n[[File:Patio_barca_garzas.jpg|thumb|left|250px|\"La barca de las garzas\" (The boat of the herons).]]\nWith the outbreak of [[World War II]] Ernst, who was German, was arrested by the French authorities for being a \"hostile alien\". With the intercession of [[Paul \u00c9luard]], and other friends, including the American journalist [[Varian Fry]], he was discharged a few weeks later. Soon after the Nazis invaded France, Ernst was arrested again, this time by the [[Gestapo]], because his art was considered by the Nazis to be \"[[Degenerate art|degenerate]]\".

Paralyzing anxiety and growing delusions culminated in a final breakdown at the British Embassy in Madrid. Her parents intervened and had her hospitalised. She was given \"[[convulsive therapy]]\" and was treated with the drugs [[cardiazol]], a powerful [[anxiolytic]] drug (eventually banned by some authorities, including the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|US Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)), and [[phenobarbital|Luminal]], a [[barbiturate]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Gaensbauer|last=Gaensbauer|first=Deborah|page=275}}</ref> After being released into the care of a nurse who took her to [[Lisbon]], Carrington ran away and sought refuge in the Mexican Embassy.

She instead focused on magical realism and alchemy and used autobiographical detail and symbolism as the subjects of her paintings.

Within the surrealist movement, there was a strong exploration of  the women's body combining the mysterious forces of nature combined. During this time women artists correlated the woman figure with creative nature while using ironic stances.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Thames & Hudson|first=|title=Women, Art & Society|publisher=Thames & Hudson Inc.|year=1990|isbn=9780500204054|location=London|pages=183}}</ref>\n\nWhen painting, she used small brushstroke techniques building up layers in a meticulous manner, creating rich imagery.\n\nIn ''Self-Portrait'' (1938), Carrington offers her own interpretation of female sexuality by looking toward her own sexual reality rather than theorizing on the subject, as was custom by other Surrealists in the movement. Carrington's move away from the characterization of female sexuality subverted the traditional male role of the Surrealist movement. ''Self-Portrait'' (1937\u201338) also offers insight into Carrington's interest in the \u2018alchemical transformation of matter and her response to the Surrealist cult of desire as a source of creative inspiration.\u2019<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />  ''Self Portrait''  further explores the duality that comes with being a woman.

All of her plays have been staged and most have been published both in Mexico and abroad. Her work has been translated into multiple languages and is regularly invited to events such as the HotInk, the Salon du Livre-Paris, the [[Miami International Book Fair]], the Festival Internacional del Libro in [[Guadalajara]] and at [[Banff Center for the Arts|The Banff Center]] and the Rockfeller Foundation.

A sense of humor in myself and in others is important to me. I like food greatly. I don\u2019t like people who do not appreciate eating. I am very sensual, I like pleasure and I share this with my friends and children. I am quite impatient and intolerant, and I like mariachi a lot. \nI try to lead a spiritual life. I spent many years studying Sufism. I love traveling because it allows me to see places, people, theaters, books, lovers and a wonderful world. I have a difficult personality, at the same time I need much love and sweetness. I have practiced Shaolinquan and I tend to be melancholy.\nI have in me a strong struggle between my need to be alone and to be in the world.

All of her plays have been staged and most have been published both in Mexico and abroad. Her work has been translated into multiple languages and is regularly invited to events such as the HotInk, the Salon du Livre-Paris, the [[Miami International Book Fair]], the Festival Internacional del Libro in [[Guadalajara]] and at [[Banff Center for the Arts|The Banff Center]] and the Rockfeller Foundation.

I am obsessed with ideas, with themes, with people: once I have begun with an obsession, I go where it takes me. I am very intense, too. I have taken many risks and I don't care. A sense of humor in myself and in others is important to me. I like food greatly. I don\u2019t like people who do not appreciate eating. I am very sensual, I like pleasure and I share this with my friends and children. I am quite impatient and intolerant, and I like mariachi a lot. \nI try to lead a spiritual life. I spent many years studying Sufism. I love traveling because it allows me to see places, people, theaters, books, lovers and a wonderful world. I have a difficult personality, at the same time I need much love and sweetness. I have practiced Shaolinquan and I tend to be melancholy.\nI have in me a strong struggle between my need to be alone and to be in the world. I spent many hours in fiction since my childhood and adolescence. Since childhood I have been this way. My brothers and sisters said and still say that I was autistic. Reality is not easy and I deal with it through paper and resolving things.<ref name=\"ssierra\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Career==\nEscalante says she is a slow writer and says only in the later career has she become more productive.<ref name=rbenitez/> However, almost all of her work has been published, and all of her plays have been staged.<ref name=rbenitez/> Her works have been translated into English, French, German, Greek, [[Dutch language|Dutch]], Italian and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and have been staged in New York, Washington, [[Ohio]], Miami, Montreal, [[Ottawa]], [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]], Paris, [[Lyon]], [[Cannes]], Venice, Rome, Amsterdam, [[Rotterdam]], [[Antwerp]], [[Udine]], Athens, [[Buenos Aires]], [[Santiago de Chile]] and [[Madrid]].<ref name=casaoax>{{cite web|title=Ximena Escalante |publisher=Centro de las Artes de San Agustin |location=Oaxaca |url=http://www.casa.oaxaca.gob.mx/index.php/convocatorias/89-nuevas/1028-dramaturgia-entre-el-teatro-y-el-guion-cinematografico-ximena-escalante |accessdate=March 16, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402174939/http://www.casa.oaxaca.gob.mx/index.php/convocatorias/89-nuevas/1028-dramaturgia-entre-el-teatro-y-el-guion-cinematografico-ximena-escalante |archivedate=April 2, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=worldtalent>{{cite web|title=Ximena Escalante M\u00e9xico |url=http://wth.com.mx/esp/ximena_escalante.html |publisher=World Talent House |accessdate=March 14, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402154129/http://wth.com.mx/esp/ximena_escalante.html |archivedate=April 2, 2015 }}</ref> In Mexico, her work has been directed by the likes of [[Mauricio Garc\u00eda Lozano]] and Francisco Franco.<ref name=cdominguez/> Escalante worked with the Nouveau Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du 8 theater company in [[Lyon, France]] from 2011 to 2013 to produce a series of four plays.<ref name=casaoax/>\n\nThe playwright has worked on various publications researched theatrical production and theory.
