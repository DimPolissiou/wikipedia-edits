The episode originally aired October 6, 2010. It was written by Paul Corrigan & Brad Walsh and directed by [[Michael Spiller]]. It guest starred [[Nathan Lane]] as Pepper Saltzman and Vic Polizos as a plumber.\n\nIn the episode, an earthquake causes Claire to be stuck in the bathroom with the plumber. Gloria interprets the natural disaster as a sign that God wants Jay to go to church while Mitchell and Cameron use it as an excuse to not attend Pepper's party.\n\n\"Earthquake\" received positive reviews from critics. The episode also received a nomination for Episode Comedy at the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2010|2010 Writers Guild of America Awards]], but ultimately lost.\n\nAccording to the [[Nielsen Media Research]], the episode received a 4.6 rating/13% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 receiving the same rating from the previous episode and also tied for being the highest rated scripted program with ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n\nHaley ([[Sarah Hyland]]) and Claire ([[Julie Bowen]]) are arguing about Haley's wanting to go to a party instead of staying home and prepare for her [[SAT]]s when a plumber ([[Vic Polizos]]) arrives. After an [[earthquake]], Claire ends up locked in the bathroom with the plumber and a bookcase is knocked down. Phil ([[Ty Burrell]]) realizes that if he can keep Claire in the bathroom long enough he can get the bookcase strapped to the wall like he told Claire he had already done while Haley realizes she can go to the party. Claire though hears her telling Alex ([[Ariel Winter]]) about the plan while Alex was blackmailing Haley into driving her to the [[Museum of Tolerance]] in exchange for the lie.\n\nPhil convinces Luke ([[Nolan Gould]]) that the bookshelf \"did not fall\". After Phil \"tries\" to get Claire out, the plumber tells Claire that the reason she is being so controlling to Haley is because Haley is much like her when she was her age, just as his son drove him crazy exactly for the same reason. Claire and the plumber finally get out of the bathroom on their own and Claire questions what took Phil so long. Alex lies for him and says he was helping everybody and checking that there were no gas leaks. Claire believes her and Phil takes Alex to the Museum of Tolerance.\n\nMeanwhile, Cameron ([[Eric Stonestreet]]) and Mitchell ([[Jesse Tyler Ferguson]]) get ready for Cameron's ex-boyfriend, Pepper Saltzman's ([[Nathan Lane]]), new theme party, [[Oscar Wilde]] and Crazy Brunch. Unknowing to Pepper, Cameron and Mitchell have grown to dislike his parties because they take a lot of work and one has to assume a character and dress up in costume. While this is happening Mitchell realizes he can use the earthquake as an excuse to get out of the party. Mitchell has Cameron tell Pepper because he is the one who always cancels, but Cameron panics while telling about the extent of the earthquake's damage. Since Pepper is on his way to their house, Mitchell starts breaking items to match Cameron's description of the damage.\n\nAt the end, Cameron tells Pepper they did not want to go to the party and Pepper, while having a breakdown, reveals that no one came to the party. To stop it, Mitchell lies by telling Pepper that Cameron still has feelings for him and then goes on a fake rampage of anger breaking items of Cameron that he hates. Pepper announces they will not have to come to his upcoming parties.\n\nAt the Pritchett house, Gloria ([[Sof\u00eda Vergara]]) gets angry at Jay ([[Ed O'Neill]]) for going golfing instead of going to [[church service|church]] with her and Manny ([[Rico Rodriguez (actor)|Rico Rodriguez]]). As Jay tells them he is done with church, the earthquake occurs. Jay still goes golfing despite Gloria telling him the earthquake was a sign from God. Manny decides to go with Jay for golf instead with Gloria at the church, something that makes her mad.\n\nAt the golf course Manny asks questions about Jay's idea of hell and heaven.

The episode originally aired October 6, 2010. It was written by Paul Corrigan & Brad Walsh and directed by [[Michael Spiller]]. It guest starred [[Nathan Lane]] as Pepper Saltzman and Vic Polizos as a plumber.\n\nIn the episode, an earthquake causes Claire to be stuck in the bathroom with the plumber. Gloria interprets the natural disaster as a sign that God wants Jay to go to church while Mitchell and Cameron use it as an excuse to not attend Pepper's party.\n\n\"Earthquake\" received positive reviews from critics. The episode also received a nomination for Episode Comedy at the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2010|2010 Writers Guild of America Awards]], but ultimately lost.\n\nAccording to the [[Nielsen Media Research]], the episode received a 4.6 rating/13% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 receiving the same rating from the previous episode and also tied for being the highest rated scripted program with ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n\nHaley ([[Sarah Hyland]]) and Claire ([[Julie Bowen]]) are arguing about Haley's wanting to go to a party instead of staying home and prepare for her [[SAT]]s when a plumber ([[Vic Polizos]]) arrives. After an [[earthquake]], Claire ends up locked in the bathroom with the plumber and a bookcase is knocked down. Phil ([[Ty Burrell]]) realizes that if he can keep Claire in the bathroom long enough he can get the bookcase strapped to the wall like he told Claire he had already done while Haley realizes she can go to the party. Claire though hears her telling Alex ([[Ariel Winter]]) about the plan while Alex was blackmailing Haley into driving her to the [[Museum of Tolerance]] in exchange for the lie.\n\nPhil convinces Luke ([[Nolan Gould]]) that the bookshelf \"did not fall\". After Phil \"tries\" to get Claire out, the plumber tells Claire that the reason she is being so controlling to Haley is because Haley is much like her when she was her age, just as his son drove him crazy exactly for the same reason. Claire and the plumber finally get out of the bathroom on their own and Claire questions what took Phil so long. Alex lies for him and says he was helping everybody and checking that there were no gas leaks. Claire believes her and Phil takes Alex to the Museum of Tolerance.\n\nMeanwhile, Cameron ([[Eric Stonestreet]]) and Mitchell ([[Jesse Tyler Ferguson]]) get ready for Cameron's ex-boyfriend, Pepper Saltzman's ([[Nathan Lane]]), new theme party, [[Oscar Wilde]] and Crazy Brunch. Unknowing to Pepper, Cameron and Mitchell have grown to dislike his parties because they take a lot of work and one has to assume a character and dress up in costume. While this is happening Mitchell realizes he can use the earthquake as an excuse to get out of the party. Mitchell has Cameron tell Pepper because he is the one who always cancels, but Cameron panics while telling about the extent of the earthquake's damage. Since Pepper is on his way to their house, Mitchell starts breaking items to match Cameron's description of the damage.\n\nAt the end, Cameron tells Pepper they did not want to go to the party and Pepper, while having a breakdown, reveals that no one came to the party. To stop it, Mitchell lies by telling Pepper that Cameron still has feelings for him and then goes on a fake rampage of anger breaking items of Cameron that he hates. Pepper announces they will not have to come to his upcoming parties.\n\nAt the Pritchett house, Gloria ([[Sof\u00eda Vergara]]) gets angry at Jay ([[Ed O'Neill]]) for going golfing instead of going to [[church service|church]] with her and Manny ([[Rico Rodriguez (actor)|Rico Rodriguez]]). As Jay tells them he is done with church, the earthquake occurs. Jay still goes golfing despite Gloria telling him the earthquake was a sign from God. Manny decides to go with Jay for golf instead with Gloria at the church, something that makes her mad.\n\nAt the golf course Manny asks questions about Jay's idea of hell and heaven. Jay's ideas soon worry Manny and at the end come to the conclusion that Manny is missing church because Jay is acting upon a hunch. When Gloria tells Manny of her vision of heaven he becomes even more fearful since she says that there are butterflies (which he is afraid of) in heaven.\n\n==Production==\n\n\"Earthquake\" was written by Paul Corrigan and Brad Walsh making it their fifth writing credit for the series.

Although the union barred Pryce from acting the role in response to Wong's complaint, vociferous opposition from [[Charlton Heston]] and a threat by the musical's creator and producer, Cameron Mackintosh, to cancel the American production entirely, induced the union to reverse course.

He also provided the voice of Captain Shang in Disney's ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' (1998), its direct-to-video [[Mulan II|sequel]], and the video game ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]''. He returned to Broadway as Linus in a revival of ''[[You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown]]'', alongside [[Anthony Rapp]], [[Roger Bart]] and [[Kristin Chenoweth]], and the 2004 revival of [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Pacific Overtures]]''.\n\nIn 1990, Wong objected to [[Actor's Equity]] that the plan to use British actor [[Jonathan Pryce]] in the role of The Engineer in the Broadway run of ''[[Miss Saigon]]'', which Pryce had originated during the show's extended run in London, would take jobs away from actors of Asian descent. Although the union barred Pryce from acting the role in response to Wong's complaint, vociferous opposition from [[Charlton Heston]] and a threat by the musical's creator and producer, Cameron Mackintosh, to cancel the American production entirely, induced the union to reverse course. Pryce went on to win a Tony award for Best Actor in a Musical for the role.\n\nIn 2008, he starred in the one-man show ''Herringbone'', in which he portrayed 12 roles, at McCarter Theatre at [[Princeton University]]. He brought the show to the [[La Jolla Playhouse]] in [[San Diego]] the following year. In 2012, Wong starred in ''Herringbone'' to benefit Dixon Place in New York for two performances. The production, recorded live for a 2014 CD release, was his first appearance in New York of the material, timed to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the original New York production.\n\nIn 2014, Wong starred in the U.S. premiere of James Fenton's acclaimed adaptation of ''[[The Orphan of Zhao]]'', a classic Chinese legend that has its roots in the fourth century BC, directed by Carey Perloff at American Conservatory Theater (A.C.T.).
