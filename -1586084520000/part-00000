The work is scored for two [[SATB]] choirs, two [[trumpet]]s, [[bassoon]], [[string section|strings]] and [[basso continuo]]. Its music opens with an instrumental introduction ([[sinfonia]]). Most of the composition's [[movement (music)|movements]] are either choral movements, in which all singers and instruments participate, or [[duet]]s for two singers and a more limited instrumental accompaniment.\n\nThe Magnificat in C&nbsp;major, [[BWV&nbsp;Anh.]]&nbsp;30, is [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s arrangement of Torri's Magnificat. In Bach's version of the work, which originated around 1742, there are an additional trumpet and [[timpani]]. Both Torri's original and Bach's arrangement were recorded in the first decade of the 21st century. Shortly after the second of these recordings was released in 2012, it was discovered that BWV&nbsp;Anh.&nbsp;30 was an arrangement of Torri's Magnificat. Before that, Bach's version had been attributed to various composers, including [[Antonio Lotti]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\nPietro Torri likely wrote his Magnificat in the 1690s, when he was in the service of [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria]].{{sfn|Thielemann|2012|p=218}} In that period Torri followed his employer to the [[Spanish Netherlands]] (1692) and was later deputized to [[Hanover]] (1696), only returning to [[Bavaria]] in 1701.{{sfn|Sadie|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rskiYf4mn7wC&pg=PA245 245]}} In the early 1790s Torri wrote scenic works such as ''L'ambizione fulminata'' and ''Gli amori di Titone e d'Aurora'' for [[Munich]], and ''I Preggi della primavera'' for [[Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici]], [[Electress Palatine]] at [[Leuchtenberg]].{{sfn|Champlin|1888\u201390|loc=III:[https://archive.org/details/cyclopediaofmusi03cham/page/489 489]}}<ref name=operone>[http://www.operone.de/komponist/torri.html Torri, Pietro] at {{url|www.operone.de}}.</ref><ref>{{RISM|450022127}}. {{Retrieved|access-date=2020-01-10}}.</ref>\n{{Panorama\n|image   = File:Wening Residenz M\u00fcnchen.jpg\n|height  = 275\n|width   = \n|alt     = \n|caption = [[Munich Residenz]], the palace of Torri's employer [[Max Emanuel]], around the time when Torri worked there.\n|dir     = \n}}\n''S.

Most of the composition's [[movement (music)|movements]] are either choral movements, in which all singers and instruments participate, or [[duet]]s for two singers and a more limited instrumental accompaniment.\n\nThe Magnificat in C&nbsp;major, [[BWV&nbsp;Anh.]]&nbsp;30, is [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s arrangement of Torri's Magnificat. In Bach's version of the work, which originated around 1742, there are an additional trumpet and [[timpani]]. Both Torri's original and Bach's arrangement were recorded in the first decade of the 21st century. Shortly after the second of these recordings was released in 2012, it was discovered that BWV&nbsp;Anh.&nbsp;30 was an arrangement of Torri's Magnificat. Before that, Bach's version had been attributed to various composers, including [[Antonio Lotti]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\nPietro Torri likely wrote his Magnificat in the 1690s, when he was in the service of [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria]].{{sfn|Thielemann|2012|p=218}} In that period Torri followed his employer to the [[Spanish Netherlands]] (1692) and was later deputized to [[Hanover]] (1696), only returning to [[Bavaria]] in 1701.{{sfn|Sadie|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rskiYf4mn7wC&pg=PA245 245]}} In the early 1790s Torri wrote scenic works such as ''L'ambizione fulminata'' and ''Gli amori di Titone e d'Aurora'' for [[Munich]], and ''I Preggi della primavera'' for [[Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici]], [[Electress Palatine]] at [[Leuchtenberg]].{{sfn|Champlin|1888\u201390|loc=III:[https://archive.org/details/cyclopediaofmusi03cham/page/489 489]}}<ref name=operone>[http://www.operone.de/komponist/torri.html Torri, Pietro] at {{url|www.operone.de}}.</ref><ref>{{RISM|450022127}}. {{Retrieved|access-date=2020-01-10}}.</ref>\n{{Panorama\n|image   = File:Wening Residenz M\u00fcnchen.jpg\n|height  = 275\n|width   = \n|alt     = \n|caption = [[Munich Residenz]], the palace of Torri's employer [[Max Emanuel]], around the time when Torri worked there.\n|dir     = \n}}\n''S.

If the price makes a [[Astrological aspect|major aspect]] (e.g. conjunction, trine, square, etc.), then it is believed that the price will reach a short-term top or bottom.\n\nWhen a price, after converting into a degree in the longitude, is in aspect with the planets, the trend is likely to change. For example, in Mechanical Method and Trend Indicator,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trading Systems and Methods|last=Kaufman|first=Perry J.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2013|isbn=9781118043561|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}</ref> Gann drew attention to the price level (\u00a2103) on 16 April 1925, \u201cApr 16 low 103, down 79\u00bd cents from 182\u00bd and nearing $1.00 per bushel, a natural support level\u2014Time to watch for change in trend.\u201d<ref name=\":19\" /> Coincidentally, 103\u00b0 (or 13\u00b0 Cancer) was where the heliocentric Mars and Pluto were in conjunction on that day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Nautical Almanac And Astronomical Ephemeris for the Year 1925|last=Commissioners Of Longitude|first=|publisher=The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|year=1922|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nGann also used scales other than 1 dollar or point per 1 degree.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://ganntrade6.com/wp-content/uploads/Coffee.pdf|title=May Coffee Santos D|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|date=19 Mar 1954|website=|access-date=14 Feb 2018}}</ref> Two notable scales are $12 and $30 to one degree, because the two largest planets in the solar system, Jupiter and Saturn, take approximately 12 and 30 years to orbit the Sun respectively.<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example again, it would become 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0, which are 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 Aries in terms of zodiac. Gann also uses a scale of $0.07 ($1/15) to 1 degree, which is based on the Earth's rotation in 24 hours (for 24 times 15\u00b0 is 360\u00b0).<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example, $120 times 15 will be 1800\u00b0, and when it is divided by 360\u00b0, the remainder is 0.

The corn top price was \u00a2137, which was around 104\u00b0, thus the three points loosely formed a Grand Trine.]]\nAccording to Patrick Mikula,<ref name=\":3\" /> the rule of using the Spiral Chart or the Hexagon Chart is as follows:\n\n# Identify the planetary combination(s) which governs the price movements of the commodity. For example, as stated above, corn is sensitive to Venus and Saturn.\n# Look for a date when the planetary combinations ruling the commodity makes a major [[astrological aspect]], like opposition, trine and square.\n# Overlay the Spiral or Hexagon Chart onto the horoscope in the following way:\n#* On the Spiral Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 1, 2, 11, 28, 53 and so on.\n#* On the Hexagon Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 0, 6, 18, 36, 60 and so on.\n# Find the current price on the Spiral or Hexagon Chart. For example, $36 is roughly at 135\u00b0 on the Spiral Chart, and at 0\u00b0 on the Hexagon Chart.\n# See if the price makes any aspect to the planetary combination:\n#* If the combination involves Jupiter, then compare the angle of the price to Jupiter;\n#* Else, compare to the outer planet of the two.\n#* In the case of Venus-Saturn, since Jupiter is not involved, the price is compared against Saturn.\n# If the price makes an important aspect to Jupiter or the outer planet, then a turning point may have been reached.\n#* The important aspects in the Spiral Chart are the multiples of 45\u00b0 and 120\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 315\u00b0.\n#* The important aspects in the Hexagon Chart are the multiples of 60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 300\u00b0\n# By repeated experimentation, the trader can determine with chart (Spiral or Hexagon) works better on which commodity, and so forth.\n\nHere are a few actual trading examples in Corn given by Gann in ''How to Make Profits Trading in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market''.<ref name=\":6\" /> As stated earlier, Gann thought that the price of corn was influenced by the aspects of Venus and Saturn, thus the angle of the price on the Hexagon Chart is compared against Saturn.

The first one is that, when a planet returns to its position during a recent eclipse, then trend is likely to change.<ref name=\":3\" /> The second way is that when a planet crosses an eclipse spot which happens during a market top or bottom, then the down or up move will accelerate.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Planetary averages ===\nGann maintained two formulas for calculating planetary averages.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> The first one is called the Mean of Five (MOF), which is arithmetic mean of the geocentric and heliocentric longitudes of the outer five planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The other is called the Cycle of Eight (COE), which include all eight planets in its calculation, using both geocentric and heliocentric longitudes (the Sun replaces the Earth in the geocentric calculation). He thinks that when these averaged values make an aspect to the price, it will create support or resistance.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Personal view on religion ==\nEven though Gann was thought to be \u201creligious\u201d,<ref name=\":1\" /> a careful analysis of his writings finds that he did not agree with the conventional Christian teachings. On page 99 to 100 of his novel ''[[The Tunnel Thru the Air; Or, Looking Back from 1940|The Tunnel Thru the Air]]'' (1927),<ref name=\":0\" /> Gann revealed some of his personal believes towards religion through a conversation between the protagonist, Robert Gordon, and his mother:\n\n\u201cShe talked to Robert of his future and told him she hoped he would be a preacher. Robert confided to her that he could never be an orthodox minister, for he could not preach and teach the things which the orthodox ministers were teaching. He did not believe in a personal devil or believe in Hell, but believed in a God of Love and Justice. He did not believe that God would inflict upon any of his children eternal punishment but thought that whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap and that we receive our reward here upon earth.\n\n\u201cHe told her that the Bible plainly said that the kingdom of heaven is within us and he believed it. If we kept our conscience clear and did unto others as we would like to have them do unto us, he believed we would find our heaven and our reward here upon earth. Said that times and conditions were changing rapidly; that the new inventions and discoveries caused men to think differently than in the old days; that the old religious ideas would pass away and give place to more liberal, advanced ideas. He hoped to live to see the day when men would not only be too proud to fight, but would be too full of love for their fellowman to settle disputes with the sword. This was God's plan and it would come to pass this way, and he believed that he could be a great power for peace and hoped to live to see a world of peace with all nations united under one kingdom and one God, the God of Love and Justice.\u201d\n\nTwenty-three years later, on page 21 of his book ''The Magic Word'' (1950),<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Magic Word|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|publisher=Lambert Gann|year=1950|isbn=|location=Pomeroy, WA|pages=}}</ref> he expressed similar ideas:\n\n\u201cThe Bible is simple when rightly understood. It teaches the Divine Law, its uses and abuses. Whether a law is divine or natural, it is made plain that if you disobey the law, you must pay the penalty and if you obey or follow the law, your reward is certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bible does not teach reward after death but promises reward or a reaping now while you are here on this earth. Jesus said, \u2018As ye sow, also shall ye reap.\u2019 He did not say \u2018after death\u2019 but here and now. Too many have preached that we should live a life of sacrifice here on earth and wait until after death to receive the reward. This is not what people want. They want something practical. They want to receive their reward here on earth. If they put forth the right effort, they want to know that they will receive the reward here on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll natural laws teach and prove that we do get our reward on this earth. Job obeyed the law and got twice as much as he had while he was still on earth. There is nothing in the Bible that says these laws will not work today and I shall prove by the Bible that they do.\u201d\n\n== Controversy ==\nThere has been a general disagreement whether Gann himself made profits by speculation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneystockstycoons.com/articles/w-d-gann-fraud-or-trading-genius-part-2/|title=W.D.

If the price makes a [[Astrological aspect|major aspect]] (e.g. conjunction, trine, square, etc.), then it is believed that the price will reach a short-term top or bottom.\n\nWhen a price, after converting into a degree in the longitude, is in aspect with the planets, the trend is likely to change. For example, in Mechanical Method and Trend Indicator,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trading Systems and Methods|last=Kaufman|first=Perry J.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2013|isbn=9781118043561|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}</ref> Gann drew attention to the price level (\u00a2103) on 16 April 1925, \u201cApr 16 low 103, down 79\u00bd cents from 182\u00bd and nearing $1.00 per bushel, a natural support level\u2014Time to watch for change in trend.\u201d<ref name=\":19\" /> Coincidentally, 103\u00b0 (or 13\u00b0 Cancer) was where the heliocentric Mars and Pluto were in conjunction on that day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Nautical Almanac And Astronomical Ephemeris for the Year 1925|last=Commissioners Of Longitude|first=|publisher=The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|year=1922|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nGann also used scales other than 1 dollar or point per 1 degree.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://ganntrade6.com/wp-content/uploads/Coffee.pdf|title=May Coffee Santos D|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|date=19 Mar 1954|website=|access-date=14 Feb 2018}}</ref> Two notable scales are $12 and $30 to one degree, because the two largest planets in the solar system, Jupiter and Saturn, take approximately 12 and 30 years to orbit the Sun respectively.<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example again, it would become 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0, which are 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 Aries in terms of zodiac. Gann also uses a scale of $0.07 ($1/15) to 1 degree, which is based on the Earth's rotation in 24 hours (for 24 times 15\u00b0 is 360\u00b0).<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example, $120 times 15 will be 1800\u00b0, and when it is divided by 360\u00b0, the remainder is 0.

The most important angle Gann called the 1x1 or the 45\u00b0 angle, which he said represented one unit of price for one unit of time.

The corn top price was \u00a2137, which was around 104\u00b0, thus the three points loosely formed a Grand Trine.]]\nAccording to Patrick Mikula,<ref name=\":3\" /> the rule of using the Spiral Chart or the Hexagon Chart is as follows:\n\n# Identify the planetary combination(s) which governs the price movements of the commodity. For example, as stated above, corn is sensitive to Venus and Saturn.\n# Look for a date when the planetary combinations ruling the commodity makes a major [[astrological aspect]], like opposition, trine and square.\n# Overlay the Spiral or Hexagon Chart onto the horoscope in the following way:\n#* On the Spiral Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 1, 2, 11, 28, 53 and so on.\n#* On the Hexagon Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 0, 6, 18, 36, 60 and so on.\n# Find the current price on the Spiral or Hexagon Chart. For example, $36 is roughly at 135\u00b0 on the Spiral Chart, and at 0\u00b0 on the Hexagon Chart.\n# See if the price makes any aspect to the planetary combination:\n#* If the combination involves Jupiter, then compare the angle of the price to Jupiter;\n#* Else, compare to the outer planet of the two.\n#* In the case of Venus-Saturn, since Jupiter is not involved, the price is compared against Saturn.\n# If the price makes an important aspect to Jupiter or the outer planet, then a turning point may have been reached.\n#* The important aspects in the Spiral Chart are the multiples of 45\u00b0 and 120\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 315\u00b0.\n#* The important aspects in the Hexagon Chart are the multiples of 60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 300\u00b0\n# By repeated experimentation, the trader can determine with chart (Spiral or Hexagon) works better on which commodity, and so forth.\n\nHere are a few actual trading examples in Corn given by Gann in ''How to Make Profits Trading in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market''.<ref name=\":6\" /> As stated earlier, Gann thought that the price of corn was influenced by the aspects of Venus and Saturn, thus the angle of the price on the Hexagon Chart is compared against Saturn.

The first one is that, when a planet returns to its position during a recent eclipse, then trend is likely to change.<ref name=\":3\" /> The second way is that when a planet crosses an eclipse spot which happens during a market top or bottom, then the down or up move will accelerate.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Planetary averages ===\nGann maintained two formulas for calculating planetary averages.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> The first one is called the Mean of Five (MOF), which is arithmetic mean of the geocentric and heliocentric longitudes of the outer five planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The other is called the Cycle of Eight (COE), which include all eight planets in its calculation, using both geocentric and heliocentric longitudes (the Sun replaces the Earth in the geocentric calculation). He thinks that when these averaged values make an aspect to the price, it will create support or resistance.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Personal view on religion ==\nEven though Gann was thought to be \u201creligious\u201d,<ref name=\":1\" /> a careful analysis of his writings finds that he did not agree with the conventional Christian teachings. On page 99 to 100 of his novel ''[[The Tunnel Thru the Air; Or, Looking Back from 1940|The Tunnel Thru the Air]]'' (1927),<ref name=\":0\" /> Gann revealed some of his personal believes towards religion through a conversation between the protagonist, Robert Gordon, and his mother:\n\n\u201cShe talked to Robert of his future and told him she hoped he would be a preacher. Robert confided to her that he could never be an orthodox minister, for he could not preach and teach the things which the orthodox ministers were teaching. He did not believe in a personal devil or believe in Hell, but believed in a God of Love and Justice. He did not believe that God would inflict upon any of his children eternal punishment but thought that whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap and that we receive our reward here upon earth.\n\n\u201cHe told her that the Bible plainly said that the kingdom of heaven is within us and he believed it. If we kept our conscience clear and did unto others as we would like to have them do unto us, he believed we would find our heaven and our reward here upon earth. Said that times and conditions were changing rapidly; that the new inventions and discoveries caused men to think differently than in the old days; that the old religious ideas would pass away and give place to more liberal, advanced ideas. He hoped to live to see the day when men would not only be too proud to fight, but would be too full of love for their fellowman to settle disputes with the sword. This was God's plan and it would come to pass this way, and he believed that he could be a great power for peace and hoped to live to see a world of peace with all nations united under one kingdom and one God, the God of Love and Justice.\u201d\n\nTwenty-three years later, on page 21 of his book ''The Magic Word'' (1950),<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Magic Word|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|publisher=Lambert Gann|year=1950|isbn=|location=Pomeroy, WA|pages=}}</ref> he expressed similar ideas:\n\n\u201cThe Bible is simple when rightly understood. It teaches the Divine Law, its uses and abuses. Whether a law is divine or natural, it is made plain that if you disobey the law, you must pay the penalty and if you obey or follow the law, your reward is certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bible does not teach reward after death but promises reward or a reaping now while you are here on this earth. Jesus said, \u2018As ye sow, also shall ye reap.\u2019 He did not say \u2018after death\u2019 but here and now. Too many have preached that we should live a life of sacrifice here on earth and wait until after death to receive the reward. This is not what people want. They want something practical. They want to receive their reward here on earth. If they put forth the right effort, they want to know that they will receive the reward here on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll natural laws teach and prove that we do get our reward on this earth. Job obeyed the law and got twice as much as he had while he was still on earth. There is nothing in the Bible that says these laws will not work today and I shall prove by the Bible that they do.\u201d\n\n== Controversy ==\nThere has been a general disagreement whether Gann himself made profits by speculation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneystockstycoons.com/articles/w-d-gann-fraud-or-trading-genius-part-2/|title=W.D.
