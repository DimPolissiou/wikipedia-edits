Marayur has more than 1,000 species of flowering plants and is a well-known repository of medicinal plants. There are 114 endemic species and the sighting of ''[[Albizia]] lathamii'', a critically endangered tree, was recently reported from the dry forests. Chinnar \u2013 the wildlife sanctuary in Marayur \u2013 has recorded the largest number of [[reptile|reptilian]] species, including the mugger crocodile, in Kerala. With 225 recorded species of birds, it is one of the richest areas in avian diversity in South India. The forests in Marayur preserve a population of the endangered grizzled giant squirrel. The rare white bison has been recently reported in Chinnar wildlife sanctuary. Other important mammals found are elephant, tiger, leopard, gaur, sambar, spotted deer, Nilgiri ''thar'', common langur, bonnet macaque, etc. The phenomenon of butterfly migration occurs in between the monsoons.\n\nMaryoor has got a number of sandalwood forests. Processing of sandalwood and its associated oil forms part of the local economy and a depot near Marayur town is supporting this industry. Sandal wood or ''[[Santalum album]]'' is a parasitic tree having a fragrant and close-grained yellowish heartwood. Sandalwood oil, also known as \u2018liquid gold,\u2019 is extracted from the roots and wood of sandalwood. This oil is a costly item marketed at a few choosy outlets all over the state. A climate with low rainfall is suitable for the growth of choice sandalwood trees from which good quality oil can be extracted. The 93&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> Marayur reserve forest is believed to have about sixty thousand naturally grown sandalwood trees, of which nearly 2,000 trees had been allegedly plundered in just one year since January 2004, when the last survey was conducted.

[[Airport Authority of India]]'s plan to set up an airport in Anakkara is in a conflict of environmental issues. Anakkara Airport will be a great leap in Idukki's complete development. The government claims this project will improve the tourism in the area. However, with Anakkara being situated in environmentally sensitive [[Western Ghats]], environmentalists and villagers argue that this can significantly impact the area's climatic conditions and livelihood of people. Also, the land identified for the project is one of the very few remaining paddy fields of the district, currently cultivating some of the rare indigenous varieties of rice which increases the concern about the project. Those opposing the airport also cite the economic benefits as Munnar, one of the key target destinations for the airport lies at about 100&nbsp;km from Anakkara and the time taken to reach there from [[Cochin International Airport]] is less than the time taken to reach from Anakkara.  Though there are no clear references online from the government on the objectives, benefits, and purpose of the proposed airport, anti-Anakkara-airport groups have set up social networking campaign sites explaining reasons why they claim the airport project should not be implemented.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Trissur district]]\n*[[Civil Station, Idukki]]\n*[[Keezhanthoor]]\n*[[Santhanpara]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Idukki district}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130724132707/http://www.idukki.nic.in/ Official Idukki District website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080531154944/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1813/18130780.htm Human Development Index (HDI) and Gender Development Index (GDI)]\n* {{curlie|Regional/Asia/India/Kerala/Districts/Idukki/}}\n\n{{Geographic Location\n| Centre    = Idukki district\n| North     = [[Coimbatore district]], Tamil Nadu\n| Northeast = {{ubl|[[Coimbatore district]], Tamil Nadu| [[Tiruppur district]], Tamil Nadu | [[Dindigul district]], Tamil Nadu}}\n| East      = [[Theni district]], Tamil Nadu\n| Southeast = {{ubl|[[Virudhunagar district]], Tamil Nadu | [[Tirunelveli district]], Tamil Nadu}}\n| South     = [[Pathanamthitta district]]\n| Southwest =\n| West      = [[Kottayam district]]\n| Northwest = [[Ernakulam district]]\n}}\n{{Navboxes\n| title = Articles Related to Idukki\n| list  =\n{{Kerala}}\n{{Northern Travancore}}\n{{Idukki district}}\n{{Hindu temples in Kerala}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Idukki}}\n[[Category:Districts of Kerala]]\n[[Category:Idukki district| ]]\n[[Category:Districts of India]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|Idukki |the Idukki town|Idukki, India}}\n{{other uses|Idukki (disambiguation)}}\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2020}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2019}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                            = Idukki District\n| native_name                     = \n| nickname                        = The land of spices in Kerala\n| settlement_type                 = [[List of districts of Kerala|District]] in [[Kerala]]\n| image_skyline                   = Sunrise at Munnar,Kerala.jpg\n| image_caption                   = A surise from [[Munnar]] in Idukki.\n| image_map                       = India Kerala Idukki district.svg\n| pushpin_map                     =\n| pushpin_label_position          = left\n| coordinates                     = {{coord|9.85|N|76.94|E|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type                = Country\n| subdivision_name                = {{flag|India}}\n| subdivision_type1               = State\n| subdivision_name1               = [[Kerala]]\n| established_title               = <!-- Established -->\n| established_date                = 1972\n| seat_type                       = Headquarters\n| seat                            = [[Painavu]]\n| leader_title1                   = Collector\n| leader_name1                    = Sri H Dineshan IAS\n| unit_pref                       = Metric\n| area_total_km2                  = 4358\n| elevation_footnotes             = \n| elevation_m                     = 1200\n| population_footnotes            = \n| population_total                = 1,108,974\n| population_as_of                = 2011\n| population_density_km2          = 254\n| demographics_type1              = Languages\n| demographics1_title1            = Official\n| demographics1_info1             = [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]]\n| demographics1_title2            = Spoken\n| demographics1_info2             = [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[English language|English]]\n| timezone1                       = [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| utc_offset1                     = +5:30\n| postal_code_type                = 68XXXX\n| postal_code                     = \n| iso_code                        = [[ISO 3166-2:IN|IN-KL]]\n| registration_plate              = {{ubl|KL-06 (Idukki)|KL-37 (Vandipperiyar)|KL-38 (Thodupuzha)|KL-68 (Devikulam)|KL-69 (Udumbanchola)|KLI (Old).}}\n| website                         = {{URL|http://www.idukki.nic.in}}\n}}\n'''Idukki''' is a [[Districts of Kerala|district]] in the Indian state of [[Kerala]].<ref>{{GEOnet2|32FA8822F3923774E0440003BA962ED3|Idukki District (Variant \u2013 V)}}, [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|United States National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]</ref> It was constituted on 26 January 1972, by splitting the district of [[Kottayam District|Kottayam]] into two parts.

The wind blows at a speed around 35&nbsp;km/hour throughout the year, irrespective of the season and time. Tourist villages like Pushpakandam and Kuruvikanam near Ramakkalmedu are home to private wind energy farms, with a capacity of about 12.5 MW.

Relics of the New Stone Age have been unearthed here. It has ancient stone cabins, called 'Muniyaras', and is the only place in Kerala with natural growth of [[sandalwood]] trees. Marayur has more than 1,000 species of flowering plants and is a well-known repository of medicinal plants. There are 114 endemic species and the sighting of ''[[Albizia]] lathamii'', a critically endangered tree, was recently reported from the dry forests. Chinnar \u2013 the wildlife sanctuary in Marayur \u2013 has recorded the largest number of [[reptile|reptilian]] species, including the mugger crocodile, in Kerala. With 225 recorded species of birds, it is one of the richest areas in avian diversity in South India. The forests in Marayur preserve a population of the endangered grizzled giant squirrel. The rare white bison has been recently reported in Chinnar wildlife sanctuary. Other important mammals found are elephant, tiger, leopard, gaur, sambar, spotted deer, Nilgiri ''thar'', common langur, bonnet macaque, etc. The phenomenon of butterfly migration occurs in between the monsoons.\n\nMaryoor has got a number of sandalwood forests. Processing of sandalwood and its associated oil forms part of the local economy and a depot near Marayur town is supporting this industry. Sandal wood or ''[[Santalum album]]'' is a parasitic tree having a fragrant and close-grained yellowish heartwood. Sandalwood oil, also known as \u2018liquid gold,\u2019 is extracted from the roots and wood of sandalwood. This oil is a costly item marketed at a few choosy outlets all over the state. A climate with low rainfall is suitable for the growth of choice sandalwood trees from which good quality oil can be extracted. The 93&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> Marayur reserve forest is believed to have about sixty thousand naturally grown sandalwood trees, of which nearly 2,000 trees had been allegedly plundered in just one year since January 2004, when the last survey was conducted. The auction-rate for first quality Marayur sandal is quoted at [[Rs.]]1100 per kg, according to forest department sources (2004).\n\n==Wildlife sanctuaries==\n\n===Idukki Wildlife Sanctuary===\nIdukki Wildlife Sanctuary came into existence in 1976.

However, with Anakkara being situated in environmentally sensitive [[Western Ghats]], environmentalists and villagers argue that this can significantly impact the area's climatic conditions and livelihood of people. Also, the land identified for the project is one of the very few remaining paddy fields of the district, currently cultivating some of the rare indigenous varieties of rice which increases the concern about the project. Those opposing the airport also cite the economic benefits as Munnar, one of the key target destinations for the airport lies at about 100&nbsp;km from Anakkara and the time taken to reach there from [[Cochin International Airport]] is less than the time taken to reach from Anakkara.  Though there are no clear references online from the government on the objectives, benefits, and purpose of the proposed airport, anti-Anakkara-airport groups have set up social networking campaign sites explaining reasons why they claim the airport project should not be implemented.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Trissur district]]\n*[[Civil Station, Idukki]]\n*[[Keezhanthoor]]\n*[[Santhanpara]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Idukki district}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130724132707/http://www.idukki.nic.in/ Official Idukki District website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080531154944/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1813/18130780.htm Human Development Index (HDI) and Gender Development Index (GDI)]\n* {{curlie|Regional/Asia/India/Kerala/Districts/Idukki/}}\n\n{{Geographic Location\n| Centre    = Idukki district\n| North     = [[Coimbatore district]], Tamil Nadu\n| Northeast = {{ubl|[[Coimbatore district]], Tamil Nadu| [[Tiruppur district]], Tamil Nadu | [[Dindigul district]], Tamil Nadu}}\n| East      = [[Theni district]], Tamil Nadu\n| Southeast = {{ubl|[[Virudhunagar district]], Tamil Nadu | [[Tirunelveli district]], Tamil Nadu}}\n| South     = [[Pathanamthitta district]]\n| Southwest =\n| West      = [[Kottayam district]]\n| Northwest = [[Ernakulam district]]\n}}\n{{Navboxes\n| title = Articles Related to Idukki\n| list  =\n{{Kerala}}\n{{Northern Travancore}}\n{{Idukki district}}\n{{Hindu temples in Kerala}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Idukki}}\n[[Category:Districts of Kerala]]\n[[Category:Idukki district| ]]\n[[Category:Districts of India]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toTelugu(link changed toTelugu language) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idukki_district"}

English names for it include '''lebbeck''', '''lebbek tree''', '''flea tree''', '''frywood''', '''koko''' and '''woman's tongue tree'''. The latter name is a play on the sound the seeds make as they rattle inside the pods. Being one of the most widespread and common species of ''Albizia'' worldwide, it is often simply called '''siris''', though this name may refer to any locally common member of the [[genus]].<ref name=\"USDA 1994\"/>\n\nIt is a [[tree]] growing to a height of 18\u201330 m tall with a trunk 50&nbsp;cm to 1 m in diameter. The [[leaf|leaves]] are bipinnate, 7.5\u201315&nbsp;cm long, with one to four pairs of pinnae, each pinna with 6\u201318 leaflets. The [[flower]]s are white, with numerous 2.5\u20133.8&nbsp;cm long stamens, and very fragrant. The [[fruit]] is a [[legume|pod]] 15\u201330&nbsp;cm long and 2.5-5.0&nbsp;cm broad, containing six to twelve [[seed]]s.<ref>Ali (1973)</ref>\n\nIn the [[West Indies]] and certain parts of [[South America]] this tree is known as a 'Shak Shak Tree' because of the sound the seeds make in the pod.\nIn [[Tamil Nadu]] , the tree is known as 'vaagai' as the ancient kings of the [[Sangam  Age]] had worn the garland made by this flower whenever they win battles . Similarly , 'vaagai' means 'victory' in [[Tamil language|Tamil]].\n\n== Uses ==\n[[Image:Bark of Albizia lebbeck.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Bark of ''Albizia lebbeck'']]\nIts uses include environmental management,  [[Fodder|forage]], medicine and wood.  It is cultivated as a shade tree in [[North America|North]] and [[South America]].<ref name = ildis>ILDIS (2005)</ref> In India and Pakistan, the tree is used to produce [[timber]].

It was originally described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] as ''Mimosa lebbeck''. [[George Bentham]] placed the [[species]] in its present [[genus]], but other authors believed that the plant described by Linnaeus was the related ''[[Albizia kalkora]]'' as described by Prain (based on the ''Mimosa kalkora'' of [[William Roxburgh]]), and erroneously referred to this species as ''Albizia lebbeck''. However, [[Francisco Manuel Blanco]] used ''Mimosa lebbeck'' to refer to ''[[Albizia retusa]]'' ssp. ''retusa''. In addition, the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is occasionally misspelled ''lebbek''.<ref>USDA (1994), ILDIS (2005)</ref>\n\n[[Junior synonym]]s are:<ref name = ildis />\n* ''Acacia lebbeck'' <small>(L.)

The [[flower]]s are white, with numerous 2.5\u20133.8&nbsp;cm long stamens, and very fragrant. The [[fruit]] is a [[legume|pod]] 15\u201330&nbsp;cm long and 2.5-5.0&nbsp;cm broad, containing six to twelve [[seed]]s.<ref>Ali (1973)</ref>\n\nIn the [[West Indies]] and certain parts of [[South America]] this tree is known as a 'Shak Shak Tree' because of the sound the seeds make in the pod.\nIn [[Tamil Nadu]] , the tree is known as 'vaagai' as the ancient kings of the [[Sangam  Age]] had worn the garland made by this flower whenever they win battles . Similarly , 'vaagai' means 'victory' in [[Tamil]].\n\n== Uses ==\n[[Image:Bark of Albizia lebbeck.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Bark of ''Albizia lebbeck'']]\nIts uses include environmental management,  [[Fodder|forage]], medicine and wood.  It is cultivated as a shade tree in [[North America|North]] and [[South America]].<ref name = ildis>ILDIS (2005)</ref> In India and Pakistan, the tree is used to produce [[timber]]. Wood from ''Albizia lebbeck'' has a density of 0.55-0.66 g/cm<sup>3</sup> or higher.<ref>Brown (1997)</ref>\n\nEven where it is not native, some indigenous [[herbivore]]s are liable to utilize lebbeck as a food resource. For example, the [[greater rhea]] (''Rhea americana'') has been observed feeding on it in the [[cerrado]] of [[Brazil]].<ref>Schetini de Azevedo ''et al.'' (2006)</ref>\n\n===Ethnobotany===\nLebbeck is an [[astringent]], also used by some cultures to treat boils, [[cough]], to treat the [[human eye|eye]], [[flu]], [[gingivitis]], [[human lung|lung]] problems, pectoral problems, is used as a tonic, and is used to treat abdominal [[tumor]]s.<ref>Duke (2008)</ref> The bark is used medicinally to treat [[inflammation]].<ref>Lowry ''et al.''(1994)</ref> This information was obtained via [[ethnobotany|ethnobotanical records]], which are a reference to how a plant is used by indigenous peoples, not verifiable, scientific or medical evaluation of the effectiveness of these claims. ''Albizia lebbeck'' is also [[psychoactive]].<ref>R\u00e4tsch (2004)</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] history of ''A. lebbeck'' is somewhat convoluted. It was originally described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] as ''Mimosa lebbeck''. [[George Bentham]] placed the [[species]] in its present [[genus]], but other authors believed that the plant described by Linnaeus was the related ''[[Albizia kalkora]]'' as described by Prain (based on the ''Mimosa kalkora'' of [[William Roxburgh]]), and erroneously referred to this species as ''Albizia lebbeck''. However, [[Francisco Manuel Blanco]] used ''Mimosa lebbeck'' to refer to ''[[Albizia retusa]]'' ssp. ''retusa''. In addition, the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is occasionally misspelled ''lebbek''.<ref>USDA (1994), ILDIS (2005)</ref>\n\n[[Junior synonym]]s are:<ref name = ildis />\n* ''Acacia lebbeck'' <small>(L.)

A piece of inscriptional evidence found at the [[Triprangode Siva Temple]] indicates that [[Goda Ravi]] of [[Chera Dynasty]] controlled the present-day district in the early 10th century. Descriptions about the rulers of [[Eranad|Eranad region]] can be seen in the [[Jewish copper plates of Cochin|Jewish copper plates]] of Bhaskara Ravi Varman (1000 CE) and in the [[Viraraghava copper plates]] of  Veera Raghava Chakravarthy (1225 CE). <ref name=History_of_Malappuram></ref> After the disintegration of the Kulasekhara kingdom, a number of [[Nair]] city-states emerged, including [[Valluvanad (southern Malabar)|Valluvanad]], [[Kingdom of Tanur|Vettattunadu (Tanur)]], [[Parappanad]] and [[Nediyiruppu]] (ruled by the [[Zamorin]]s). \n\nDuring the 14th century, the [[Samoothiri]] of [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]] expanded their territories to many parts of the district.

The ancient [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]] though mainly centered in [[Thrissur]] also had [[Namboodiri]] and [[Nair]] scholars coming from [[Malappuram]]. The [[Parameshvara]], the [[Nilakantha Somayaji]], the [[Jye\u1e63\u1e6dhadeva]], the [[Achyutha Pisharadi]], and the [[Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri]], who were the main members of the [[Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics]] hailed from [[Tirur]] area in the district.\n\n=== Colonial-era ===\n[[Colonial India|European colonial powers]] first landed in Malabar during the 15th century, and the [[Samoothiri]]s often allied with foreign powers. During the 18th century, the ''de facto'' [[Mysore kingdom]] rulers [[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]] marched into the Samoothiris\u2019 districts.\n\nThis district was the venue for many of the Mappila revolts (uprisings against the British East India Company in Kerala) between 1792 and 1921. Malappuram has been part of movements such as [[Khilafat Movement]] and [[Malabar Rebellion]] in the early 20th century. Before [[Partition of India|Indian independence]] in 1947, Malappuram was part of [[Malabar District]] in the [[Madras Presidency]] of [[British India]]. The present district was administered as parts of [[Kozhikode|Kozhikode taluk]], [[Eranad taluk]], [[Valluvanad Taluk]] and [[Ponnani Taluk|Ponnani taluk]]. \n[[File:South Malabar 1921.png|left|thumb|alt=Map of South Malabar in 1921|South Malabar during the [[Malabar rebellion]] in 1921 (today a major part lies in the Malappuram district)]]\n[[File:Ali Musliyar.jpg|130px|left|thumb|alt=Older man in traditional dress, looking left|[[Ali Musliyar]], one of the chief Mappila rebels]]\n\n=== After Independence ===\nThe [[Malabar District]] remained as a part of [[Madras state]] for a few years after independence, but on 1 November 1956 it merged with [[Travancore-Cochin]] to form the state of [[Kerala]]. The newly merged [[Malabar District]] was divided into [[Kannur district|Kannur]], [[Kozhikode district|Kozhikode]] and [[Palakkad district|Palakkad]] in 1957 soon after the formation of [[Kerala]]. Large-scale changes in the territorial jurisdiction of the region took place in between 1957 and 1969. On 1 January 1957, [[Tirur taluk]] was formed by adjoining the major portions of Eranad taluk and Ponnani taluk. Another portion of Ponnani taluk was transferred to the new [[Chavakkad]] [[taluk]] in [[Thrissur district]], and the remainder is present-day Ponnani taluk. [[Perinthalmanna taluk]] was formed from the former Valluvanad Taluk. Of these, [[Eranad taluk|Eranad Taluk]] and [[Tirur]] remained in [[Kozhikode District]] and Perinthalmanna Taluk and Ponnani taluk remained in [[Palakkad District]]. The new district of Malappuram was formed with four taluks (Eranad, Perinthalmanna, Tirur, and Ponnani), four towns, fourteen developmental blocks and 100 [[panchayat]]s. Later, three more taluks, [[Tirurangadi taluk|Tirurangadi]], [[Nilambur taluk|Nilambur]] and [[Kondotty Taluk|Kondotty]] were formed from Tirur Taluk and Eranad taluk.\n\nIn the early years of [[Communist]] rule in Kerala, Malappuram experienced land reform under the [[Land reform in Kerala|Land Reform Ordinance]].

A piece of inscriptional evidence found at the [[Triprangode Siva Temple]] indicates that [[Goda Ravi]] of [[Chera Dynasty]] controlled the present-day district in the early 10th century. Descriptions about the rulers of [[Eranad|Eranad region]] can be seen in the [[Jewish copper plates of Cochin|Jewish copper plates]] of Bhaskara Ravi Varman (1000 CE) and in the [[Viraraghava copper plates]] of  Veera Raghava Chakravarthy (1225 CE). <ref name=History_of_Malappuram></ref> After the disintegration of the Kulasekhara kingdom, a number of [[Nair]] city-states emerged, including [[Valluvanad (southern Malabar)|Valluvanad]], [[Kingdom of Tanur|Vettattunadu (Tanur)]], [[Parappanad]] and [[Nediyiruppu]] (ruled by the [[Zamorin]]s). \n\nDuring the 14th century, the [[Samoothiri]] of [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]] expanded their territories to many parts of the district.

The ancient [[Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics]] though mainly centered in [[Thrissur]] also had [[Namboodiri]] and [[Nair]] scholars coming from [[Malappuram]]. The [[Parameshvara]], the [[Nilakantha Somayaji]], the [[Jye\u1e63\u1e6dhadeva]], the [[Achyutha Pisharadi]], and the [[Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri]], who were the main members of the [[Kerala School of Astronomy and Mathematics]] hailed from [[Tirur]] area in the district.\n\n=== Colonial-era ===\n[[Colonial India|European colonial powers]] first landed in Malabar during the 15th century, and the [[Samoothiri]]s often allied with foreign powers. During the 18th century, the ''de facto'' [[Mysore kingdom]] rulers [[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]] marched into the Samoothiris\u2019 districts.\n\nThis district was the venue for many of the Mappila revolts (uprisings against the British East India Company in Kerala) between 1792 and 1921. Malappuram has been part of movements such as [[Khilafat Movement]] and [[Malabar Rebellion]] in the early 20th century. Before [[Partition of India|Indian independence]] in 1947, Malappuram was part of [[Malabar District]] in the [[Madras Presidency]] of [[British India]]. The present district was administered as parts of [[Kozhikode|Kozhikode taluk]], [[Eranad taluk]], [[Valluvanad Taluk]] and [[Ponnani Taluk|Ponnani taluk]]. \n[[File:South Malabar 1921.png|left|thumb|alt=Map of South Malabar in 1921|South Malabar during the [[Malabar rebellion]] in 1921 (today a major part lies in the Malappuram district)]]\n[[File:Ali Musliyar.jpg|130px|left|thumb|alt=Older man in traditional dress, looking left|[[Ali Musliyar]], one of the chief Mappila rebels]]\n\n=== After Independence ===\nThe [[Malabar District]] remained as a part of [[Madras state]] for a few years after independence, but on 1 November 1956 it merged with [[Travancore-Cochin]] to form the state of [[Kerala]]. The newly merged [[Malabar District]] was divided into [[Kannur district|Kannur]], [[Kozhikode district|Kozhikode]] and [[Palakkad district|Palakkad]] in 1957 soon after the formation of [[Kerala]]. Large-scale changes in the territorial jurisdiction of the region took place in between 1957 and 1969. On 1 January 1957, [[Tirur taluk]] was formed by adjoining the major portions of Eranad taluk and Ponnani taluk. Another portion of Ponnani taluk was transferred to the new [[Chavakkad]] [[taluk]] in [[Thrissur district]], and the remainder is present-day Ponnani taluk. [[Perinthalmanna taluk]] was formed from the former Valluvanad Taluk. Of these, [[Eranad taluk|Eranad Taluk]] and [[Tirur]] remained in [[Kozhikode District]] and Perinthalmanna Taluk and Ponnani taluk remained in [[Palakkad District]]. The new district of Malappuram was formed with four taluks (Eranad, Perinthalmanna, Tirur, and Ponnani), four towns, fourteen developmental blocks and 100 [[panchayat]]s. Later, three more taluks, [[Tirurangadi taluk|Tirurangadi]], [[Nilambur taluk|Nilambur]] and [[Kondotty Taluk|Kondotty]] were formed from Tirur Taluk and Eranad taluk.\n\nIn the early years of [[Communist]] rule in Kerala, Malappuram experienced land reform under the [[Land reform in Kerala|Land Reform Ordinance]]. During the 1970s [[Persian Gulf]] [[oil]] reserves were opened to commercial extraction and thousands of unskilled workers [[Kerala Gulf diaspora|migrated]] to the Gulf. They sent money home, supporting the rural economy, and by the late 20th century the region had [[First World]] health standards and near-universal literacy.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2084273_2084272_2084259,00.html | work=Time | title=Summer Journey 2011 | date=21 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Cherumb eco tourism village, Karuvarakundu India (2).JPG|left|thumb|alt= The Cherumb eco-tourism village at Karuvarakundu|The Cherumb eco-tourism village in [[Karuvarakundu]]]]\n[[File:Kerala Houseboat (191490747).jpeg|right|thumb|alt= The Biyyam Kayal in [[Ponnani]]|The Biyyam Kayal in [[Ponnani]]]]\nBounded by the [[Nilgiri Mountains|Nilgiri hills]] on the east, the [[Arabian Sea]] on the west, the [[Wayanad district|Wayanad]] and [[Kozhikode district|Kozhikode]] districts on the north, and the [[Palakkad district|Palakkad]] and [[Thrissur district|Thrissur]] districts on the south, Malappuram district possesses a total geographical area of 3,550 sq.km, which ranks third in the state in terms of area.

The first series was aired on [[BBC Radio 4]] in 1990, and the second, a TV series, on [[BBC2]] in 2009. There are two books about the project: ''Last Chance to See'', which he co-wrote with Adams (1990), and ''Last Chance to See: In the footsteps of Douglas Adams'' (2009). He is now a leading and outspoken conservationist, and a prolific broadcaster, columnist and photographer.\n\n==Writing==\nCarwardine has written more than fifty books. Most recently he has written the ground-breaking ''Handbook of Whales, Dolphins and Porpoises'' (Bloomsbury 2020) and an eBook, ''Digital Workflow for Wildlife Photographers''. In 2009, he wrote ''Last Chance to See: In the Footsteps of Douglas Adams'' (HarperCollins). This is a sequel to the best-selling book, ''[[Last Chance to See]]'', which he wrote with the late [[Douglas Adams]] (author of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''). Other books that Carwardine has written include ''Mark Carwardine's Guide to Whale Watching in North America'' (Bloomsbury, 2017), ''Mark Carwardine's Guide to Whale Watching in Britain and Europe'' (Bloomsbury, 2016), the award-winning ''Shark Watcher's Handbook'' and ''Eyewitness Handbooks: Whales, Dolphins and Porpoises'', which is the best-selling cetacean field guide ever published (nearly a million copies in print).{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Carwardine also writes a monthly column  in ''[[BBC Wildlife]]'' magazine, and has written hundreds of articles for newspapers and magazines.\n\n==Radio and television==\nIn 1989 the [[BBC Radio 4]] series ''[[Last Chance to See]]'' and the subsequent book (1990) described eight expeditions by Carwardine and writer [[Douglas Adams]] to find and report on some of the most endangered species around the world. These were the [[aye-aye]] in Madagascar, the [[Komodo dragon]] in [[Indonesia]], the [[kakapo]] in [[New Zealand]], the [[Amazonian manatee]] in [[Brazil]], the [[Baiji|Yangtze river dolphin]] in [[China]], the [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez fur seal]] in [[Chile]], the [[Northern white rhinoceros|northern white rhino]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and the [[Rodrigues flying fox|Rodrigues fruit bat]] in [[Mauritius]].\n\nCarwardine also presented the weekly half-hour radio programme Nature, on BBC Radio&nbsp;4, for many years. He has also been the presenter of many other programmes for BBC Radio&nbsp;4.\n\nIn autumn 2009, he joined forces with [[Stephen Fry]] to present a follow-up to the original ''Last Chance to See'' with the late Douglas Adams. This was the six-part [[BBC Two|BBC2]] television series, also called ''[[Last Chance to See (TV series)|Last Chance to See]]''<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/lastchancetosee/ BBC Two \u2013 Last Chance to See].

The series not only updated  the situation with most of the endangered species featured in the original series but looked at some new ones, including the [[blue whale]] in [[Baja California]], [[Mexico]].\n\nIn spring 2010, he co-presented ''[[Museum of Life (film)|The Museum of Life]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/museum-of-life/index.html |title=Museum of Life |accessdate=2010-03-19 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307044936/http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/museum-of-life/index.html |archivedate=7 March 2010 }}. nhm.ac.uk</ref> (BBC2, 6 episodes), which explored the pioneering and often surprising research work and wildlife collections of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], in London.\n\nOn BBC2 in October 2010 there was an additional ''Last Chance to See'' special by Carwardine and Fry about the northern white rhino, ''Last Chance to See: Return of the Rhino'', which followed the re-introduction of zoo-raised rhinos into the wild.\n\nAlso on BBC2 on 7 November 2010 Carwardine and Fry co-presented ''Stephen Fry and the Great American Oil Spill'' about the effects, four months after the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|BP oil disaster]] in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n==Photography==\nCarwardine has an extensive collection of wildlife, nature and environment photographs taken on all seven continents and in more than a hundred countries. He wrote a digital workflow eBook in April 2020 (''Digital Workflow for Wildlife Photographers''). He was also Chairman of the judging panel for the prestigious [[Wildlife Photographer of the Year]] competition for seven years since 2005, run by the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] and ''[[BBC Wildlife]]''.\n\n==Wildlife tours==\nCarwardine was a founding director of the wildlife travel companies Discover the World, WildOceans and Ocean Wanderers.
