He played [[college football]] at [[Kent State Golden Flashes football|Kent State]] and the [[College of San Mateo]] as a [[quarterback]]. He was drafted by the Patriots in the seventh round of the [[2009 NFL Draft]]. Edelman primarily plays on offense and as a punt returner; he has also been pressed into service as a [[cornerback]] at times when the Patriots have been shorthanded on defense.\n\nEdelman is one of the most productive receivers in post-season history, ranking second overall (behind [[Jerry Rice]]) in both post-season receiving yards and post-season receptions.  He has played in four Super Bowls ([[Super Bowl XLVI|XLVI]], [[Super Bowl XLIX|XLIX]], [[Super Bowl LI|LI]] and [[Super Bowl LIII|LIII]]). In each of the last three, he led all wide receivers in receiving yards. He was named [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|Super Bowl MVP]] for Super Bowl LIII, in which he had 10 catches for 141 yards receiving, more than half of his team's total receiving yardage. He holds the Super Bowl records for career punt returns (8) and first-half receptions in a single game (7).\n\n==Early years==\nEdelman was born in [[Redwood City, California]], to Angela (n\u00e9e Gole) and Frank Edelman, a mechanic who owns an A-1 Auto Tech.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/12659571 |title=Julian Edelman enjoys his moment |date=February 19, 2015 |website=ESPN.com}}</ref> He has two siblings, Jason and Nicole.<ref>[http://www.patriots.com/team/roster/Julian-Edelman/1f41cf38-740b-4d2a-9109-7e13b48567e7 Julian Edelman profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131230846/http://www.patriots.com/team/roster/Julian-Edelman/1f41cf38-740b-4d2a-9109-7e13b48567e7 |date=January 31, 2012 }}, Patriots.com; accessed November 6, 2015.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://search.ancestry.com/search/db.aspx?dbid=5247 |title=California Birth Index, 1905\u20131995 |publisher=Ancestry |access-date=February 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/01/16/julian-edelman-took-back-road-nfl/Qbv5QnIQh9BpRn9ZetrSRO/story.html |title=Julian Edelman took the 'back road' to the NFL |website=BostonGlobe.com |access-date=April 9, 2015}}</ref> Originally raised as a [[Christians|Christian]], his ancestry includes [[Greeks|Greek]], [[English people|English]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], Irish, [[Ashkenazi Jewish]], and [[Germans|German]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://njjewishnews.com/kaplanskorner/2009/09/21/edelman-mot/ |title=Edelman MOT? \u00bb Kaplan's Korner on Jews and Sports |date=September 21, 2009 |website=Njjewishnews.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108212449/http://njjewishnews.com/kaplanskorner/2009/09/21/edelman-mot/ |archive-date=November 8, 2014 |access-date=January 18, 2017}}</ref> His mother was born in [[Kitchener, Ontario]], Canada, to German parents who had lived in [[Belgium]].<ref name=\"relnt1\">Stated in ''Relentless: A Memoir'', Julian Edelman, 2017, Hachette Books</ref>\n\nHe was the quarterback for [[Woodside High School (California)|Woodside High School]] in [[Woodside, California]], and as a senior, he led the Wildcats to a 13\u20130 record in 2004.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.maxpreps.com/high-schools/woodside-wildcats-(woodside,ca)/football-fall-04/schedule.htm |title=Schedule \u2013 Woodside Wildcats 2004 Football (CA) |website=www.maxpreps.com |access-date=December 11, 2018}}</ref> During his high school career, Edelman had 2,237 yards and 29 touchdowns passing, in addition to 964 yards and 13 [[touchdown]]s rushing.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Yang |first=Nicole |url=https://www.boston.com/sports/new-england-patriots/2017/10/24/5-things-we-learned-from-julian-edelmans-new-memoir-relentless |title=5 things we learned from Julian Edelman's new memoir 'Relentless' |date=October 24, 2017 |work=Boston.com |access-date=December 25, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==College career==\nAfter high school, Edelman spent a year attending the [[College of San Mateo]].

He played [[college football]] at [[Kent State Golden Flashes football|Kent State]] and the [[College of San Mateo]] as a [[quarterback]]. He was drafted by the Patriots in the seventh round of the [[2009 NFL Draft]]. Edelman primarily plays on offense and as a punt returner; he has also been pressed into service as a [[cornerback]] at times when the Patriots have been shorthanded on defense.\n\nEdelman is one of the most productive receivers in post-season history, ranking second overall (behind [[Jerry Rice]]) in both post-season receiving yards and post-season receptions.  He has played in four Super Bowls ([[Super Bowl XLVI|XLVI]], [[Super Bowl XLIX|XLIX]], [[Super Bowl LI|LI]] and [[Super Bowl LIII|LIII]]). In each of the last three, he led all wide receivers in receiving yards. He was named [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|Super Bowl MVP]] for Super Bowl LIII, in which he had 10 catches for 141 yards receiving, more than half of his team's total receiving yardage. He holds the Super Bowl records for career punt returns (8) and first-half receptions in a single game (7).\n\n==Early years==\nEdelman was born in [[Redwood City, California]], to Angela (n\u00e9e Gole) and Frank Edelman, a mechanic who owns an A-1 Auto Tech.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/12659571 |title=Julian Edelman enjoys his moment |date=February 19, 2015 |website=ESPN.com}}</ref> He has two siblings, Jason and Nicole.<ref>[http://www.patriots.com/team/roster/Julian-Edelman/1f41cf38-740b-4d2a-9109-7e13b48567e7 Julian Edelman profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131230846/http://www.patriots.com/team/roster/Julian-Edelman/1f41cf38-740b-4d2a-9109-7e13b48567e7 |date=January 31, 2012 }}, Patriots.com; accessed November 6, 2015.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://search.ancestry.com/search/db.aspx?dbid=5247 |title=California Birth Index, 1905\u20131995 |publisher=Ancestry |access-date=February 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/01/16/julian-edelman-took-back-road-nfl/Qbv5QnIQh9BpRn9ZetrSRO/story.html |title=Julian Edelman took the 'back road' to the NFL |website=BostonGlobe.com |access-date=April 9, 2015}}</ref> Originally raised as a [[Christians|Christian]], his ancestry includes [[Greeks|Greek]], [[English people|English]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], Irish, [[Ashkenazi Jewish]], and [[Germans|German]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://njjewishnews.com/kaplanskorner/2009/09/21/edelman-mot/ |title=Edelman MOT? \u00bb Kaplan's Korner on Jews and Sports |date=September 21, 2009 |website=Njjewishnews.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108212449/http://njjewishnews.com/kaplanskorner/2009/09/21/edelman-mot/ |archive-date=November 8, 2014 |access-date=January 18, 2017}}</ref> His mother was born in [[Kitchener, Ontario]], Canada, to German parents who had lived in [[Belgium]].<ref name=\"relnt1\">Stated in ''Relentless: A Memoir'', Julian Edelman, 2017, Hachette Books</ref>\n\nHe was the quarterback for [[Woodside High School (California)|Woodside High School]] in [[Woodside, California]], and as a senior, he led the Wildcats to a 13\u20130 record in 2004.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.maxpreps.com/high-schools/woodside-wildcats-(woodside,ca)/football-fall-04/schedule.htm |title=Schedule \u2013 Woodside Wildcats 2004 Football (CA) |website=www.maxpreps.com |access-date=December 11, 2018}}</ref> During his high school career, Edelman had 2,237 yards and 29 touchdowns passing, in addition to 964 yards and 13 [[touchdown]]s rushing.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Yang |first=Nicole |url=https://www.boston.com/sports/new-england-patriots/2017/10/24/5-things-we-learned-from-julian-edelmans-new-memoir-relentless |title=5 things we learned from Julian Edelman's new memoir 'Relentless' |date=October 24, 2017 |work=Boston.com |access-date=December 25, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==College career==\nAfter high school, Edelman spent a year attending the [[College of San Mateo]].

They are currently ranked as the best team in the [[Confederation of European Baseball]], and the team is also ranked ninth in the [[WBSC World Rankings]].\n\nThe Netherlands participated in the [[Summer Olympic Games]] in [[Baseball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], [[Baseball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]], [[Baseball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], and [[Baseball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]]. The team has also participated in both of the other major international baseball tournaments recognised by the [[International Baseball Federation]] (IBAF): the [[World Baseball Classic]] (WBC) and the [[Baseball World Cup]]. In [[2011 Baseball World Cup|2011]], the team won the World Cup after beating 25-time champion [[Cuba national baseball team|Cuba]] in the finals. The team is controlled by the [[Koninklijke Nederlandse Baseball en Softball Bond]], which is represented in the [[Confederation of European Baseball]]. \n\nThe team is made up primarily of players from the [[Netherlands]] in Europe, and from Dutch territories and islands in the [[Caribbean]] that are part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, such as [[Aruba]] and [[Cura\u00e7ao]] (which is part of the former [[Netherlands Antilles]], which have since been dissolved), where baseball is extremely popular. Some foreigners of Dutch descent have also been members of the team.  While baseball only maintains a niche following throughout Europe, the Netherlands, along with Italy, are the two European countries where the sport's popularity is strongest; the team has finished in either first or second place in each of the 31 [[European Baseball Championship]]s in which it has appeared.\n\nThe team played in the [[2017 World Baseball Classic]], and finished in 4th place. It won the [[2019 European Baseball Championship]], winning a gold medal. It then competed at the [[Baseball_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Qualification#Africa/Europe_Qualifying_Event|Africa/Europe 2020 Olympic Qualification tournament]], in Italy in September 2019, taking second place behind Team Israel.

Each territory has its own baseball federation and in the past, the [[Netherlands Antilles national baseball team|Netherlands Antilles]] and [[Aruba national baseball team|Aruba]] have fielded its own team in international competitions. In recent years, however, players from the Dutch Caribbean have played on the national team of the Netherlands itself, alongside players from continental Europe and a handful of Americans of Dutch descent, resulting in a team with a stronger concentration of talent.

January 2009 the [[International Baseball Federation]] created a ranking system so that the nations involved in international competition could be compared independently. Teams receive points based on the position they finish at the end of tournaments. The system takes into account results not only of the senior men's teams but also of junior teams. Weightings that emphasise the importance of certain tournaments are based on the number of teams competing, the number of continents represented (or eligible to be represented), and in the case of continental tournaments such as the [[European Baseball Championship]] the relative strength of teams eligible. Only results within the previous four years are used, so points are added and removed over time. Since the system began, the rankings have been adjusted after the completion of tournaments qualifying for the ranking process.\n\nSince September 18, 2012, the Netherlands are listed at 6th position.{{fact|date=September 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=1 style=\"border-collapse:collapse; font-size:90%; text-align:center;\" cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 \n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Date<br>Released\n! rowspan=2 | Tournament\n! rowspan=2 | Tournament<br>Result\n! rowspan=2 colspan=2 | Ranking\n! rowspan=2 colspan=2 | Points\n! colspan=3 | Position Above\n! colspan=3 | Position Below\n|-\n!

They are currently ranked as the best team in the [[Confederation of European Baseball]], and the team is also ranked ninth in the [[WBSC World Rankings]].\n\nThe Netherlands participated in the [[Summer Olympic Games]] in [[Baseball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], [[Baseball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000]], [[Baseball at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], and [[Baseball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]]. The team has also participated in both of the other major international baseball tournaments recognised by the [[International Baseball Federation]] (IBAF): the [[World Baseball Classic]] (WBC) and the [[Baseball World Cup]]. In [[2011 Baseball World Cup|2011]], the team won the World Cup after beating 25-time champion [[Cuba national baseball team|Cuba]] in the finals. The team is controlled by the [[Koninklijke Nederlandse Baseball en Softball Bond]], which is represented in the [[Confederation of European Baseball]]. \n\nThe team is made up primarily of players from the [[Netherlands]] in Europe, and from Dutch territories and islands in the [[Caribbean]] that are part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, such as [[Aruba]] and [[Cura\u00e7ao]] (which is part of the former [[Netherland Antilles]], which have since been dissolved), where baseball is extremely popular. Some foreigners of Dutch descent have also been members of the team.  While baseball only maintains a niche following throughout Europe, the Netherlands, along with Italy, are the two European countries where the sport's popularity is strongest; the team has finished in either first or second place in each of the 31 [[European Baseball Championship]]s in which it has appeared.\n\nThe team played in the [[2017 World Baseball Classic]], and finished in 4th place. It won the [[2019 European Baseball Championship]], winning a gold medal. It then competed at the [[Baseball_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Qualification#Africa/Europe_Qualifying_Event|Africa/Europe 2020 Olympic Qualification tournament]], in Italy in September 2019, taking second place behind Team Israel.

Each territory has its own baseball federation and in the past, the [[Netherlands Antilles national baseball team|Netherlands Antilles]] and [[Aruba national baseball team|Aruba]] have fielded its own team in international competitions. In recent years, however, players from the Dutch Caribbean have played on the national team of the Netherlands itself, alongside players from continental Europe and a handful of Americans of Dutch descent, resulting in a team with a stronger concentration of talent.

January 2009 the [[International Baseball Federation]] created a ranking system so that the nations involved in international competition could be compared independently. Teams receive points based on the position they finish at the end of tournaments. The system takes into account results not only of the senior men's teams but also of junior teams. Weightings that emphasise the importance of certain tournaments are based on the number of teams competing, the number of continents represented (or eligible to be represented), and in the case of continental tournaments such as the [[European Baseball Championship]] the relative strength of teams eligible. Only results within the previous four years are used, so points are added and removed over time. Since the system began, the rankings have been adjusted after the completion of tournaments qualifying for the ranking process.\n\nSince September 18, 2012, the Netherlands are listed at 6th position.{{fact|date=September 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=1 style=\"border-collapse:collapse; font-size:90%; text-align:center;\" cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 \n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Date<br>Released\n! rowspan=2 | Tournament\n! rowspan=2 | Tournament<br>Result\n! rowspan=2 colspan=2 | Ranking\n! rowspan=2 colspan=2 | Points\n! colspan=3 | Position Above\n! colspan=3 | Position Below\n|-\n!

It was a subscale reusable design that included many of the design features of the [[SM-64 Navaho]] missile. The X-10 was similar to the development of [[Bell Aircraft|Bell]]'s [[X-9 Shrike]] project, which was based on features of the [[GAM-63 RASCAL]].\n\n==Development==\nTo facilitate development of the long-range Navaho [[surface-to-surface missile|surface-to-surface]] [[cruise missile]], North American Aviation (NAA) developed the '''RTV-A-5''' (Research Test Vehicle, Air Force), or X-10 in 1951. This vehicle was to prove out critical flight technology for the design of the cruise vehicle of the Navaho missile design. These included proving the basic aerodynamics out to Mach 2, flight testing the [[Inertial navigation system|inertial guidance unit]] and flight control [[avionics]] to the same speed, and finally validate the recovery system for the next phase in the Navaho program. Preliminary design of the X-10 was completed in February 1951 and the first vehicle was delivered to [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in May 1953. The first flight occurred on 14 October 1953.<ref>Gibson, James N. ''The Navaho Missile Project: The Story of the Know-How missile of American Rocketry.'' Atglen, Pennsylvania: Schiffer Publishing, 1996. {{ISBN|0-7643-0048-2}}.</ref>\n\nThe X-10 was powered by two [[Westinghouse J40]] [[turbojet]] engines with afterburners, and equipped with landing gear for conventional take off and landing. The combination of a [[delta wing]] with an all-moving [[canard (aeronautics)|canard]] gave it extremely good aerodynamics in the [[transonic]] and [[supersonic]] environments. It also made the vehicle unstable requiring active computer flight control in the form of an [[autopilot]]. Thus, the X-10 is similar to modern military fighters which are flown by the onboard computer and not directly by the pilot. In this same regard, though the X-10 was receiving directional commands from a radio-command guidance system, these commands were sent through the on-board computer which in turn implemented the commands. Later X-10s included an N-6 [[inertial navigation system]] which completely controlled the vehicle through the cruise portion of the flight.<ref>Miller 2001, pp. 138\u2013139.</ref>\n\n[[File:North American X-10 USAF.jpg|thumb|51-9307 at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]]]]\n\n==Operational history==\nAt the time it came into service, the X-10 was one of the fastest turbojet-powered aircraft flown. From 1953 to 1955 a total of five X-10s flew 15 flights at Edwards AFB. There it reached a maximum flight speed of [[Mach (speed)|Mach]] 1.84, flew a distance of {{convert|400|mi|km|0|abbr=on}}, and reached an altitude of {{convert|41000|ft}}. These were performance levels superior to nearly all manned turbojet aircraft (the exception being the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|YF-104 Starfighter]]). In 1955 the program moved to [[Cape Canaveral, Florida]], to complete the test program. Here a new set of six X-10 vehicles would complete the testing of the N-6 inertial navigation system out to supersonic speeds, reach {{convert|49000|ft}} altitude, a total flight distance of {{convert|627|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} and a peak speed of Mach 2.05.\n\n===Disposition===\nOf all the X-10s built, only one survived the test program: serial 51-9307, the first X-10 to fly. Of the other four aircraft that flew at Edwards AFB, one blew up on takeoff, one was lost in flight, and the remaining two were destroyed in landing accidents. As for the vehicles flown at Cape Canaveral, three were expended in planned dive-in flights against [[Grand Bahama Island]], and two were lost in landing accidents.\n\nIn 1958, the remaining three Cape Canaveral X-10s were selected for use as high speed targets for the [[CIM-10 Bomarc|BOMARC]] surface-to-air missile. The plan was to recover and reuse the X-10, not to have them shot down by the BOMARC. Unfortunately, none of these vehicles would complete their target flight: two were lost on landing and the third suffered a mechanical problem forcing it to be flown into the Atlantic.\n\n==Survivors==\nThe sole surviving X-10 s/n GM 19307 is located at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. This was the first X-10 to fly. The aircraft was delivered to the Air Force Museum in 1957, upon completion of the program.

It is displayed in the Museum's Research & Development Hangar.<ref>{{cite web |title=North American X-10 |url=http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/Visit/Museum-Exhibits/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/195756/north-american-x-10 |website=National Museum of the United States Air Force |accessdate=31 March 2020 |date=21 October 2015}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Specifications (X-10)==\n{{Aircraft specs\n|ref=\n|prime units?=imp\n\n|crew=None\n|capacity=\n|length m=\n|length ft=77\n|length in=\n|length note=\n|span m=\n|span ft=28\n|span in=2\n|span note=\n|height m=\n|height ft=14\n|height in=5\n|height note=\n|wing area sqm=\n|wing area sqft=425\n|wing area note=\n|aspect ratio=\n|airfoil=NACA 66-006 (mod)\n|empty weight kg=\n|empty weight lb=25800\n|empty weight note=\n|gross weight kg=\n|gross weight lb=35000\n|gross weight note=\n|max takeoff weight kg=\n|max takeoff weight lb=42300\n|max takeoff weight note=\n|fuel capacity=\n|more general=\n\n|eng1 number=2\n|eng1 name=[[Westinghouse XJ40]]-WE-1\n|eng1 type=[[turbojet]]s\n|eng1 kn=\n|eng1 lbf=10900\n|eng1 note=\n|thrust original=\n|eng1 kn-ab=\n|eng1 lbf-ab=\n\n|max speed kmh=\n|max speed mph=1300\n|max speed kts=\n|max speed note=\n|max speed mach=\n|cruise speed kmh=\n|cruise speed mph=\n|cruise speed kts=\n|cruise speed note=\n|stall speed kmh=\n|stall speed mph=\n|stall speed kts=\n|stall speed note=\n|never exceed speed kmh=\n|never exceed speed mph=\n|never exceed speed kts=\n|never exceed speed note=\n|range km=\n|range mil818es=\n|range nmi=\n|range note=\n|combat range km=\n|combat range miles=\n|combat range nmi=\n|combat range note=\n|ferry range km=\n|ferry range miles=\n|ferry range nmi=\n|ferry range note=\n|endurance=\n|ceiling m=\n|ceiling ft=45000\n|ceiling note=\n|g limits=\n|roll rate=\n|glide ratio=\n|climb rate ms=\n|climb rate ftmin=5224\n|climb rate note=\n|time to altitude=\n|lift to drag=\n|wing loading kg/m2=\n|wing loading lb/sqft=\n|wing loading note=\n|fuel consumption kg/km=\n|fuel consumption lb/mi=\n|thrust/weight=\n\n|more performance=\n\n|avionics=\n}}\n\n==See also==\n{{aircontent\n|see also=\n|related=\n* [[SM-64 Navaho]]\n|similar aircraft=\n|lists=\n}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Miller, Jay.
