Upon the recommendation of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], with whom he had served, he was appointed [[governor of New South Wales]] from 1821 to 1825. \n\nA keen astronomer, he built the colony's second observatory and encouraged scientific and agricultural training.

He was educated in astronomy and mathematics at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. He joined the [[British Army]]'s [[38th (1st Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot]] in 1789 and had a distinguished in [[Flanders]], the [[West Indies]], Spain and North America. He served under the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], and in 1813 he was promoted to [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|major general]]. He saw much action during the [[Peninsular War]], including leading a brigade in the [[3rd Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|3rd Division]] that broke through at the [[Battle of Vitoria]]. He continued as a [[brigade]] commander in the [[War of 1812]], where in 1814 he led a brigade at the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]], which Brisbane claimed they could have won if they had been allowed to launch a full infantry attack.<ref name=plattsburgh>[http://www.galafilm.com/1812/e/people/brisbane.html People & Stories, War of 1812] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523115325/http://www.galafilm.com/1812/e/people/brisbane.html |date=23 May 2008 }}, URL accessed 18 October 2006</ref> \n\nDuring the battle, he used the [[Charles C.

On his father-in-law's death, Brisbane assumed the additional surname, becoming Makdougall Brisbane.<ref>[http://www.thepeerage.com/p43467.htm#i434663 Person Page 43467]. Thepeerage.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-16.</ref>\n\n==Governor==\nIn 1821, on the recommendation of Wellington, Brisbane was appointed [[Governor of New South Wales]], a post he held until 1825. Brisbane took over the government on 1 December 1821, and at once proceeded to carry out some of the reforms recommended in the report of [[John Bigge]]. While Governor he tackled the many problems of a rapidly growing and expanding colony. He worked to improve the land grants system and to reform the currency. \n\nBrisbane's keen interest in science led him to accept the invitation to become the first President of the [[Philosophical Society of Australasia]] that later became the [[Royal Society of New South Wales]].  He also set up the first agricultural training college in New South Wales and was the first patron of the [[Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales|New South Wales Agricultural Society]]. He conducted experiments in growing tobacco, cotton, coffee and [[New Zealand flax]] in the colony.\n\nHowever, Brisbane did not always receive loyal support from his administrative officers, and in particular from [[Frederick Goulburn]], the colonial secretary. A reference to Brisbane's dispatch to Earl Bathurst dated 14 May 1825 shows that Bigge's recommendations had been carefully considered, and that many improvements had been made.<ref>''[[Historical Records of Australia]]'', Series I, vol. XI, pp. 571\u2013588</ref> Brisbane did not limit his attention to Bigge's report. \n\nEarly in April 1822 he discovered with some surprise the ease with which grants of land had hitherto been obtained. He immediately introduced a new system under which every grant had the stipulation that for every {{convert|100|acre|m2}} granted the grantee would maintain free of expense to the crown one convict labourer. He also encouraged agriculture on government land, streamlined granting of tickets of leave and pardons and introduced, in 1823, a system of calling for supplies by tender. When [[Robert Wardell|Dr. Robert Wardell]] and [[William Wentworth]] brought out their paper the ''Australian'' in 1824, Brisbane tried the experiment of allowing full latitude of the freedom of the press.\n\nIn 1823 Brisbane sent Lieutenant [[John Oxley]] to find a new site for convicts who were repeat offenders. Oxley discovered a large river flowing into [[Moreton Bay]]. A year later, the first convicts arrived at Moreton Bay. Brisbane visited the settlement in December 1824. Oxley suggested that both the [[Brisbane River|river]] and the [[Brisbane|settlement]] be named after Brisbane. The convict settlement was declared a town in 1834 and opened to free settlement in 1839.\n\nBrisbane was doing useful work, but he could not escape the effects of the constant faction fights which also plagued previous governors. Henry G. Douglass, the assistant-surgeon, was the centre of one of the bitter conflicts. Consequently, charges of various kinds against Brisbane were sent to England. The worst of these, that he had connived at sending female convicts to [[Emu Plains, New South Wales|Emu Plains]] for immoral purposes, was investigated by William Stewart, the lieutenant-governor, John Stephen, assistant judge, and the Rev. William Cowper, senior assistant-chaplain, and found to be without the slightest foundation. \n\nBrisbane discovered that Goulburn, the colonial secretary, had been withholding documents from him and answering some without reference to the governor, and in 1824 reported his conduct to [[Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst|Lord Bathurst]]. In reply, Bathurst recalled both the governor and the colonial secretary in dispatches dated 29 December 1824.\n\n==Astronomer==\n[[File:Parramatta park, Parramatta, New South Wales, Sydney - Wiki0081.jpg|thumb|171x171px|Remains of observatory in Parramatta Park, [[Parramatta]], N.S.W.]]\nBrisbane was a keen astronomer throughout his career. He had an [[observatory]] built at his ancestral home in 1808. From this observatory he was able to contribute to the advances in navigation which took place over the next hundred years. He took telescopes, books and two astronomical assistants, [[Carl Ludwig Christian R\u00fcmker]] and [[James Dunlop]] to New South Wales with him. On arrival he had the first properly-equipped Australian observatory built at [[Parramatta, New South Wales|Parramatta]] while waiting for his predecessor, Governor Macquarie to complete his final arrangements. \n\nThe Parramatta observatory recorded stars of the southern hemisphere, the first detailed observations from the continent. Its major contribution was [[Carl Ludwig Christian R\u00fcmker|R\u00fcmker]]'s rediscovery of [[Encke's comet]] in 1822. Brisbane left his equipment and books in the colony when he returned to Scotland. Remnants of this collection survive in the [[Sydney Observatory]].\n\n==Later years==\nBrisbane left Sydney in December 1825 and returned to Scotland. In 1826 he was made Colonel of the [[34th (Cumberland) Regiment of Foot]]. He added the name of ''Makdougall'' before ''Brisbane'', and settled down to the life of a country gentleman and took interest in science, his estate, and his regiment. He was elected president of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] (1832) following the death of [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]], and in 1836 he was created a [[baronet]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=19359 |date=23 February 1836 |page=358}}</ref> In the same year he was offered the command of the troops stationed in Canada and two years later the chief command in [[India]], but declined both. He continued his astronomical researches, and did valuable work.\n\nHe was the first patron of science in Australia, and as such was eulogised by Sir [[John Herschel]] when he presented Brisbane with the gold medal of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1828. [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] universities gave him the honorary degree of DCL, and he was elected a fellow of the Royal Societies of both [[Royal Society of London|London]] and [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]]. He was created [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] in 1814 and [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath]] in 1837.\n\nIn 1828 he won the [[Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society]]. He published ''The Brisbane Catalogue'' of 7,385 stars of the [[Southern Hemisphere]] in 1835. The Observatory was used until 1855.\n[[File:Largs, The Brisbane Aisle.JPG|right|thumb|The Brisbane family vault in Largs]]\nWhen Brisbane returned to Scotland he continued his studies and built a further observatory on his wife's estate, Makerstoun, near [[Kelso, Scotland|Kelso]] in the [[Scottish Borders|Borders]]. He was a member of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] and received its [[Keith Medal]] in 1848. In 1833 he acted as president of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]]. He founded a gold medal for the encouragement of scientific research to be awarded by the Royal Society of Edinburgh.\n\nBrisbane died much respected and honoured on 27 January 1860 in [[Largs]]. His four children predeceased him. He is buried in the [[Brisbane Aisle]] Vault, which is in the small [[kirkyard]] next to the remains of Largs Old Kirk (known as [[Skelmorlie Aisle]]).\n\n==Legacy==\nThe following features are named after Thomas Brisbane:\n\n* [[Brisbane]], the Australian state of [[Queensland]]'s largest city and capital.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The city of [[Brisbane, California]], may in turn have been named after Brisbane, Queensland, but the derivation is disputed.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}}}\n* [[Brisbane River]] in [[Queensland]], Australia.\n* [[Brisbane (lunar crater)|Brisbane]], a crater on the Moon.\n* Brisbane Street, [[Greenock]]\n* [[Brisbane Water]], an [[estuary]] on the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]] of [[New South Wales]].<ref name=gnb>{{NSW GNR|id=ItqwZxsE |title=Brisbane Water |work=Geographical Name Register |publisher=Geographical Names Board of New South Wales |accessdate=28 December 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Sir Thomas Brisbane Planetarium]], located in Brisbane, Queensland.\n* Noddsdale, the valley near [[Largs]] where his birthplace Brisbane House was situated, was renamed Brisbane Glen in his honour.<ref name=AB>{{cite web|url=http://www.ayrshire-birding.org.uk/locations/brisbane.htm |title=Brisbane Glen, Largs |work=Ayrshire Birding |accessdate=2 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105180417/http://www.ayrshire-birding.org.uk/locations/brisbane.htm |archivedate=5 January 2009 }}</ref>\n* [[Isabella Plains, Australian Capital Territory|Isabella Plains]], a suburb in [[Canberra]], named in honour of Isabella Brisbane, a daughter of Sir Thomas.\n* Brisbane House Hotel in Largs, a town located by the sea in North Ayrshire, Scotland.\n* Thomas Makdougall Brisbane bridge in Largs\n* Makdougall Brisbane prize of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/662_MakdougallBrisbanePrize.html |title=Makdougall Brisbane prize |publisher=Royal Society of Edinburgh }}</ref>\nMany other uses of Brisbane derive from the Australian city and hence are indirectly named after Thomas Brisbane.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Historical Records of Australia]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Sir Thomas Makdougall Brisbane |volume=4  |ref={{harvid|''EB''|1878}} |page=347 }}\n* {{cite EB1911 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Brisbane, Sir Thomas Makdougall |volume=4 |ref={{harvid|''EB''|1911}} |page=573 }}\n* {{citation |first=J.D. |last=Heydon  |contribution-url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A010141b.htm |contribution=Sir Thomas Makdougall Brisbane (1773\u20131860) |title=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]] |volume=Vol. I |publisher=[[Melbourne University Press]] |location=Melbourne |date=1966 |pp=151\u2013155 }}\n* {{citation |last=Mennell |first=Philip |date=1892 |contribution=[[:s:The Dictionary of Australasian Biography/Brisbane, General Sir Thos.

To track the evolving relationship between campaigning and governing, Doherty examines the strategic choices that presidents make and what those choices reveal about presidential priorities. He focuses on the rise in presidential fundraising and the targeting of key electoral states throughout a president's term in office \u2013 illustrating that recent presidents have disproportionately visited those states that are important to their political prospects while largely neglecting those without electoral payoff.
