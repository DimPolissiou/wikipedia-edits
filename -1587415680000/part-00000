The town is situated on the [[River Frome, Dorset|River Frome]] eight miles (13&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Poole]].\n\n==Situation and geography==\nThe town is built on a strategic [[dry point]] between the River Frome and the [[River Piddle]] at the head of the Wareham Channel of [[Poole Harbour]]. The Frome Valley runs through an area of unresistant sand, clay and gravel rocks, and much of its valley has wide [[flood plain]]s and [[marsh]] land. At its [[estuary]] the river has formed the wide shallow [[ria]] of Poole Harbour. Wareham is built on a low dry island between the marshy river plains.\n[[File:River Frome - geograph.org.uk - 11551.jpg|thumb|left|River Frome]]\nThe town is situated on the [[A roads in Zone 3 of the Great Britain numbering scheme|A351]] [[Lytchett Minster]]-[[Swanage]] road and at the eastern terminus of the [[A352 road]] to [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] and [[Sherborne]], both roads now [[Bypass route|bypass]]ing the town centre. The town has [[Wareham railway station|a station]] on the [[South Western Main Line]] railway, and was formerly the junction station for services along the branch line to Swanage, now preserved as the [[Swanage Railway]]. The steam railway has ambitions to extend its service, currently from Swanage to Norden, near [[Corfe Castle (village)|Corfe Castle]] back to [[Worgret|Worgret Junction]] (where the mainline and branch divided) and into Wareham again.\n\nTo the north west of the town a large conifer plantation, [[Wareham Forest]] stretches several miles to the [[A35 road]] and the southern foothills of the [[Dorset Downs]]. To the south east is Corfe Castle and the heathland that borders Poole Harbour, including [[Wytch Farm]] oil field and [[Studland]] & Godlingstone Heath [[Nature Reserve]]. About four miles (7&nbsp;km) to the south is a chalk ridge, the [[Purbeck Hills]], and eight miles (12&nbsp;km) to the south is the [[English Channel]].\n\n==History==\nThe town's strategic setting has made it an important settlement throughout its long history. Excavations at the nearby Bestwall site have produced evidence of transient early [[Mesolithic]] activity dating to around 9000 [[BCE]]. At the same site four large [[Neolithic]] pits containing worked [[flint]] and pottery fragments dating to 3700 BCE were found. Three green stone axeheads discovered also probably date to this period. Flint working and potting continued throughout the [[Bronze Age]]. The first house discovered dates to the mid 15th century BCE.<ref name=\"britarch_bestwall\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba115/feat2.shtml|title=Bestwall Quarry|accessdate=9 January 2011|date=Nov\u2013Dec 2010|first=Lilian|last=Ladle|first2=Ann|last2=Woodward|journal=British Archaeology|issue=115}}</ref>\n[[File:Wareham West Walls.JPG|thumb|left|\"Bloody Bank\" is the high point in the distance, on West Walls]]\nArchaeological evidence exists of a small [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlement, though the current town was founded by the [[Saxons]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=9}}</ref> The Roman name is unknown, but the town is referred to as ''Werham'' in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' entry of 784, from [[Old English]] ''wer'' (meaning 'fish trap, a weir') and ''h\u0101m'' ('homestead') or ''hamm'' ('enclosure hemmed in by water').<ref>{{cite book | first1=David | last1=Hill | first2=Alexander R. | last2=Rumble | title=The defence of Wessex: the Burghal Hidage and Anglo-Saxon fortifications | year=1996 | publisher=Manchester University Press | isbn=0-7190-3218-0 | pages=107\u2013108}}</ref>\n[[File:Wareham Lady St Mary Church 2.JPG|thumb|Lady St. Mary Church]]\nThe town's oldest features are the town walls, ancient earth [[defensive wall|ramparts]] surrounding the town, likely built by [[Alfred the Great]] in the 9th century to defend the town from the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]]<ref name=\"Davis 1997 14\">{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=14}}</ref> as part of his system of ''[[burh]]'' towns.

Up until this time Wareham had been an important port; however the growth of Poole and the gradual silting of the river caused a decline in trade and by the end of the 13th century most of the foreign trade had transferred to Poole. Local trade continued to be handled at the Quay until the construction of the railway in the 19th century.<ref name=\"wtc\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=20}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], Wareham changed hands several times between the [[Cavalier|Royalists]] and [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] and in August 1644 was the site of a fierce battle with 2,000 [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] soldiers besieging the town.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=31}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Monmouth Rebellion]] of 1685, Wareham was one of a number of towns in Dorset where [[George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys|Judge Jeffreys]] held the [[Bloody Assizes]], with five rebels being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] on the West Walls, an area known as 'Bloody Bank'.<ref name=\"lilianladle_1986\">{{harvnb|Ladle|1986|p=28}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=35}}</ref> This may also have been the site of the execution of a hermit known as Peter de Pomfret who in 1213 had prophesied that before the next [[Ascension Day]] [[John, King of England|King John]]'s rule would be over. The prophecy turned out to be incorrect, and the King decreed that Peter should be dragged through the streets of the town tied to a horse's tail and [[Hanging|hanged]] together with his son.<ref name=\"lilianladle_1986\"/>\n\nIn 1762, a fire destroyed two thirds of the town, which has been rebuilt in [[Georgian architecture]] with red brick and [[Purbeck limestone]], following the earlier street pattern. The town is divided into four quarters by the two main roads, which cross at right-angles. The [[medieval]] [[almshouse]]s escaped the fire, and some of the Georgian fa\u00e7ades are in fact disguising earlier buildings which also survived.\n\nWith the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914, Wareham became a [[garrison]] town with up to 7,000 soldiers living and training locally. The camp was re-located to nearby [[Bovington Camp|Bovington]] in 1922.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|pp=85\u201390}}</ref> The town survived the [[Second World War]] largely intact, although five houses were destroyed when a bomb dropped by a [[Luftwaffe|German aeroplane]] fell near St Martin's Church in 1942.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=91}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the constraints of the rivers and marshland Wareham grew little during the 20th century, while nearby towns, such as [[Poole]], grew rapidly.\n\n==Religious sites==\n[[File:Wareham St Martin's Church 2.JPG|thumb|[[St Martin's Church, Wareham]]]]\nWareham contains several places of worship with the oldest being the Saxon churches of Lady St. Mary (substantially modified but the origins are [[Norman conquest of England|pre-conquest]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=11}}</ref> The Saxon nave was demolished in 1841-2) and [[St Martin's Church, Wareham|St. Martins-on-the-Walls]] (built c.1030, dedicated to [[Martin of Tours]]). Both are [[Church of England|Anglican]]. The 14th-century building of Holy Trinity Church stands on the site of the Saxon chapel St Andrew's<ref name=\"Davis 1997 15\"/> and was until 2012 a tourist information centre. Other churches are the Wareham [[United Reformed Church]] in Church Street, St. Edward the Martyr [[Roman Catholic]] church on Shatters Hill, Wareham [[Methodist]] Church in North St. and the [[Evangelical]] Church in Ropers Lane. Sections of the churchyard of Lady St. Mary are managed by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]], containing as it does a number of graves of servicemen who died in a nearby military hospital during the [[First World War]] and others, including those of German and Polish servicemen, from the [[Second World War]].\n\n==Government==\n[[File:Wareham North Street.JPG|thumb|North St.]]\nThe civil parish of Wareham Town encompasses the walled town of Wareham, situated on the land between the rivers Frome and Piddle, together with the area of Northport to the north of the River Piddle, and a relatively small amount of the surrounding rural area.

The town is situated on the [[River Frome, Dorset|River Frome]] eight miles (13&nbsp;km) southwest of [[Poole]].\n\n==Situation and geography==\nThe town is built on a strategic [[dry point]] between the River Frome and the [[River Piddle]] at the head of the Wareham Channel of [[Poole Harbour]]. The Frome Valley runs through an area of unresistant sand, clay and gravel rocks, and much of its valley has wide [[flood plain]]s and [[marsh]] land. At its [[estuary]] the river has formed the wide shallow [[ria]] of Poole Harbour. Wareham is built on a low dry island between the marshy river plains.\n[[File:River Frome - geograph.org.uk - 11551.jpg|thumb|left|River Frome]]\nThe town is situated on the [[A roads in Zone 3 of the Great Britain numbering scheme|A351]] [[Lytchett Minster]]-[[Swanage]] road and at the eastern terminus of the [[A352 road]] to [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] and [[Sherborne]], both roads now [[Bypass route|bypass]]ing the town centre. The town has [[Wareham railway station|a station]] on the [[South Western Main Line]] railway, and was formerly the junction station for services along the branch line to Swanage, now preserved as the [[Swanage Railway]]. The steam railway has ambitions to extend its service, currently from Swanage to Norden, near [[Corfe Castle (village)|Corfe Castle]] back to [[Worgret|Worgret Junction]] (where the mainline and branch divided) and into Wareham again.\n\nTo the north west of the town a large conifer plantation, [[Wareham Forest]] stretches several miles to the [[A35 road]] and the southern foothills of the [[Dorset Downs]]. To the south east is Corfe Castle and the heathland that borders Poole Harbour, including [[Wytch Farm]] oil field and [[Studland]] & Godlingstone Heath [[Nature Reserve]]. About four miles (7&nbsp;km) to the south is a chalk ridge, the [[Purbeck Hills]], and eight miles (12&nbsp;km) to the south is the [[English Channel]].\n\n==History==\nThe town's strategic setting has made it an important settlement throughout its long history. Excavations at the nearby Bestwall site have produced evidence of transient early [[Mesolithic]] activity dating to around 9000 [[BCE]]. At the same site four large [[Neolithic]] pits containing worked [[flint]] and pottery fragments dating to 3700 BCE were found. Three green stone axeheads discovered also probably date to this period. Flint working and potting continued throughout the [[Bronze Age]]. The first house discovered dates to the mid 15th century BCE.<ref name=\"britarch_bestwall\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba115/feat2.shtml|title=Bestwall Quarry|accessdate=9 January 2011|date=Nov\u2013Dec 2010|first=Lilian|last=Ladle|first2=Ann|last2=Woodward|journal=British Archaeology|issue=115}}</ref>\n[[File:Wareham West Walls.JPG|thumb|left|\"Bloody Bank\" is the high point in the distance, on West Walls]]\nArchaeological evidence exists of a small [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlement, though the current town was founded by the [[Saxons]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=9}}</ref> The Roman name is unknown, but the town is referred to as ''Werham'' in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' entry of 784, from [[Old English]] ''wer'' (meaning 'fish trap, a weir') and ''h\u0101m'' ('homestead') or ''hamm'' ('enclosure hemmed in by water').<ref>{{cite book | first1=David | last1=Hill | first2=Alexander R. | last2=Rumble | title=The defence of Wessex: the Burghal Hidage and Anglo-Saxon fortifications | year=1996 | publisher=Manchester University Press | isbn=0-7190-3218-0 | pages=107\u2013108}}</ref>\n[[File:Wareham Lady St Mary Church 2.JPG|thumb|Lady St. Mary Church]]\nThe town's oldest features are the town walls, ancient earth [[defensive wall|ramparts]] surrounding the town, likely built by [[Alfred the Great]] in the 9th century to defend the town from the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]]<ref name=\"Davis 1997 14\">{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=14}}</ref> as part of his system of ''[[burh]]'' towns.

Up until this time Wareham had been an important port; however the growth of Poole and the gradual silting of the river caused a decline in trade and by the end of the 13th century most of the foreign trade had transferred to Poole. Local trade continued to be handled at the Quay until the construction of the railway in the 19th century.<ref name=\"wtc\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=20}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], Wareham changed hands several times between the [[Cavalier|Royalists]] and [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] and in August 1644 was the site of a fierce battle with 2,000 [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] soldiers besieging the town.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=31}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Monmouth Rebellion]] of 1685, Wareham was one of a number of towns in Dorset where [[George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys|Judge Jeffreys]] held the [[Bloody Assizes]], with five rebels being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] on the West Walls, an area known as 'Bloody Bank'.<ref name=\"lilianladle_1986\">{{harvnb|Ladle|1986|p=28}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=35}}</ref> This may also have been the site of the execution of a hermit known as Peter de Pomfret who in 1213 had prophesied that before the next [[Ascension Day]] [[John, King of England|King John]]'s rule would be over. The prophecy turned out to be incorrect, and the King decreed that Peter should be dragged through the streets of the town tied to a horse's tail and [[Hanging|hanged]] together with his son.<ref name=\"lilianladle_1986\"/>\n\nIn 1762, a fire destroyed two thirds of the town, which has been rebuilt in [[Georgian architecture]] with red brick and [[Purbeck limestone]], following the earlier street pattern. The town is divided into four quarters by the two main roads, which cross at right-angles. The [[medieval]] [[almshouse]]s escaped the fire, and some of the Georgian fa\u00e7ades are in fact disguising earlier buildings which also survived.\n\nWith the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914, Wareham became a [[garrison]] town with up to 7,000 soldiers living and training locally. The camp was re-located to nearby [[Bovington Camp|Bovington]] in 1922.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|pp=85\u201390}}</ref> The town survived the [[Second World War]] largely intact, although five houses were destroyed when a bomb dropped by a [[Luftwaffe|German aeroplane]] fell near St Martin's Church in 1942.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=91}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the constraints of the rivers and marshland Wareham grew little during the 20th century, while nearby towns, such as [[Poole]], grew rapidly.\n\n==Religious sites==\n[[File:Wareham St Martin's Church 2.JPG|thumb|[[St Martin's Church, Wareham]]]]\nWareham contains several places of worship with the oldest being the Saxon churches of Lady St. Mary (substantially modified but the origins are [[Norman conquest of England|pre-conquest]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1997|p=11}}</ref> The Saxon nave was demolished in 1841-2) and [[St Martin's Church, Wareham|St. Martins-on-the-Walls]] (built c.1030, dedicated to [[Martin of Tours]]). Both are [[Church of England|Anglican]]. The 14th-century building of Holy Trinity Church stands on the site of the Saxon chapel St Andrew's<ref name=\"Davis 1997 15\"/> and was until 2012 a tourist information centre. Other churches are the Wareham [[United Reformed Church]] in Church Street, St. Edward the Martyr [[Roman Catholic]] church on Shatters Hill, Wareham [[Methodist]] Church in North St. and the [[Evangelical]] Church in Ropers Lane. Sections of the churchyard of Lady St. Mary are managed by the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]], containing as it does a number of graves of servicemen who died in a nearby military hospital during the [[First World War]] and others, including those of German and Polish servicemen, from the [[Second World War]].\n\n==Government==\n[[File:Wareham North Street.JPG|thumb|North St.]]\nThe civil parish of Wareham Town encompasses the walled town of Wareham, situated on the land between the rivers Frome and Piddle, together with the area of Northport to the north of the River Piddle, and a relatively small amount of the surrounding rural area.

the Yinzhou area belongs to the Luxi fault block uplift (level III) and the Zhangzhou fault (Grade IV) unit. The eastern part of the boundary is the Yishan fault, the west is the Sunshidian fault, and the north is the Wensi fault. It is the Fushan fault. Yanzhou is part of it. The basement is the metamorphic rock series of the [[Mount Tai]] Group. The [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]] strata are developed above the basement. Among them, rich industrial coal seams are formed in the Late Paleozoic strata, which is an important base for Yanzhou becoming national coal resources. The tectonic movement in the territory has shaped various structural topography, which are roughly two types of fault structure and fold structure. The strata of all walks of life are developed from the old to the new for the Early Paleozoic strata, the Paleozoic strata, the Mesozoic strata, and the [[Neogene]] stratigraphic strata. In the early Paleozoic, the horizon was in a state of slow decline, with large-scale transgression, and the deposition of thick shallow sand shale and carbonate rock formations. The Ordovician rocks in the Paleozoic are mainly light gray and gray thick layered [[limestone]], crystalline limestone and leopard skin limestone; the Carboniferous rocks are mainly gray-white siltstone, clay rock, shale and thin layer limestone. Several layers of coal; the two rocks are mainly grayish white, dark gray sandstone and variegated mudstone and brown shale, rich in plant fossils. The Mesozoic Jurassic rocks are mainly brown sandstone, conglomerate, variegated mudstone and glutenite. The Cenozoic is made up of Tertiary and Quaternary strata. The Tertiary is sandstone, sticky sandstone, and mudstone; the Quaternary strata are loose rock formations composed of Wenyu alluvial deposits. The west is the Wenhe alluvial fan, the east is the Weihe alluvial fan, and the two overlapping alluvial fans are located in the area of Qianqian-Da'an-Tianqi Temple.\n\nYanzhou District is located in the sloping plain of the southwestern part of the Mount Tai in the Luzhong Mountains. The west is flooded by the flood waters, and the flood alluvial landforms are obvious; the eastern waters are discharged to the southwest, and the terrain is inclined from the northeast to the southwest; the central Guangfu River and the Yangjiahe River are parallel and the terrain is low. The ground elevation is 60~38 meters, the height difference is 22 meters and the average elevation is 49 meters, and the average slope is 1/1500. The northeast is affected by the structure and is a shallow buried area of the Tertiary, with a large slope on the ground. The plain area is 64,670 hectares, accounting for 99.7% of the total area; it is divided into three types: micro-sloping ground, depression and slow-moving. The area is 45,601 hectares, accounting for 70.35% of the total area; the area is 12276.9 hectares, accounting for 18.94% of the total area; the area is 6792.2 hectares, accounting for 10.48% of the total area.\n\nThe hills in the territory belong to the bedrock of the Mount Tai hidden under the Quaternary cover. There is a hill 15 kilometers west of the city, named Ziyang Mountain. It is the only hill in Yanzhou. It is a bare hill of the Ordovician limestone. It is a low hill type. It is divided into two peaks, east peak is 75 meters above sea level, and west peak is 72.5 meters above sea level. The mountain is spread from east to west, 1.5 kilometers long and one kilometer wide, covering an area of 1.5 square kilometers. The rock is limestone, and the Qing Dynasty has been sporadic mining, although it is forbidden. In the later period of the \"[[Cultural Revolution]]\", the trees on the mountain were cut down, and the mountain quarry was cut off.

the Yinzhou area belongs to the Luxi fault block uplift (level III) and the Zhangzhou fault (Grade IV) unit. The eastern part of the boundary is the Yishan fault, the west is the Sunshidian fault, and the north is the Wensi fault. It is the Fushan fault. Yanzhou is part of it. The basement is the metamorphic rock series of the [[Mount Tai]] Group. The [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]] strata are developed above the basement. Among them, rich industrial coal seams are formed in the Late Paleozoic strata, which is an important base for Yanzhou becoming national coal resources. The tectonic movement in the territory has shaped various structural topography, which are roughly two types of fault structure and fold structure. The strata of all walks of life are developed from the old to the new for the Early Paleozoic strata, the Paleozoic strata, the Mesozoic strata, and the [[Neogene]] stratigraphic strata. In the early Paleozoic, the horizon was in a state of slow decline, with large-scale transgression, and the deposition of thick shallow sand shale and carbonate rock formations. The Ordovician rocks in the Paleozoic are mainly light gray and gray thick layered [[limestone]], crystalline limestone and leopard skin limestone; the Carboniferous rocks are mainly gray-white siltstone, clay rock, shale and thin layer limestone. Several layers of coal; the two rocks are mainly grayish white, dark gray sandstone and variegated mudstone and brown shale, rich in plant fossils. The Mesozoic Jurassic rocks are mainly brown sandstone, conglomerate, variegated mudstone and glutenite. The Cenozoic is made up of Tertiary and Quaternary strata. The Tertiary is sandstone, sticky sandstone, and mudstone; the Quaternary strata are loose rock formations composed of Wenyu alluvial deposits. The west is the Wenhe alluvial fan, the east is the Weihe alluvial fan, and the two overlapping alluvial fans are located in the area of Qianqian-Da'an-Tianqi Temple.\n\nYanzhou District is located in the sloping plain of the southwestern part of the Mount Tai in the Luzhong Mountains. The west is flooded by the flood waters, and the flood alluvial landforms are obvious; the eastern waters are discharged to the southwest, and the terrain is inclined from the northeast to the southwest; the central Guangfu River and the Yangjiahe River are parallel and the terrain is low. The ground elevation is 60~38 meters, the height difference is 22 meters and the average elevation is 49 meters, and the average slope is 1/1500. The northeast is affected by the structure and is a shallow buried area of the Tertiary, with a large slope on the ground. The plain area is 64,670 hectares, accounting for 99.7% of the total area; it is divided into three types: micro-sloping ground, depression and slow-moving. The area is 45,601 hectares, accounting for 70.35% of the total area; the area is 12276.9 hectares, accounting for 18.94% of the total area; the area is 6792.2 hectares, accounting for 10.48% of the total area.\n\nThe hills in the territory belong to the bedrock of the Mount Tai hidden under the Quaternary cover. There is a hill 15 kilometers west of the city, named Ziyang Mountain. It is the only hill in Yanzhou. It is a bare hill of the Ordovician limestone. It is a low hill type. It is divided into two peaks, east peak is 75 meters above sea level, and west peak is 72.5 meters above sea level.

There are multiple distinct versions for individual games.

The leaves are unique among other mosses as it has leaves with pocket-like flaps (common name Pocket Moss). The size of the [[gametophyte]] is a few millimetres long (measured as the length of the shoot). Sterile stems are often longer than fertile shoots, and plants from caves can produce long shoots with many leaf pairs. Most of the time, the lamina in F.limbatus is unistratose; however, it is partially bistratose occasionally.\n\n==== Leaf Structure ====\nEach leaf usually divided into three different parts:\n\n# The vaginant laminae (or lamina vera) is a boat-shaped or sheathing part of the leaf. The central cells of [[vaginant lamina]] somewhat more regularly arranged than ventral and dorsal laminae. The cells in this section are a little longer than wide, up to 12 micrometres wide.\n# The ventral lamina (or the apical lamina): the part of the leaf apical to the vaginant laminae on the upper side of the [[costa]]. The central cells of apical and dorsal laminae are unistratose and smooth, up to 12 micrometres wide, hexagonal-rhomboidal shaped with thin walls and no marginal thickenings.\n# The dorsal lamina is the section of the leaf edge opposite the sheathing part and the ventral lamina, extending the total length of the leaf on the backside of the costa. Dorsal lamina is not decurrent, mostly decreased to extinction at the leaf base.\n\n==== [[Leaf margin]] ====\n[[File:F.limbatus leaf.png|thumb|''F.limbatus'' Leaf Poket ]]\nAnother critical characteristic of the ''Fissidens limbatus'' leaf is the margin, which is formed by a border called the [[limbidium]]: long, narrow, incrassate cells. These cells in F,limbatus are unistratose to bistratose. Furthermore, sometimes, the limbidium enters the sheathing part (vaginant lamina), which means that the border cells are separated from the margin by a row of [[Chlorophyllase|chlorophyllose]] cells. This is called an intralaminar or [[intramarginal limbidium]]. The limbidium also connects with the costa at the leaf tip (leaf apex), forming an apiculus, or ending a few cells before the apex. The costa could be up to 25 micrometres at the base (per-current).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== [[Rhizoid|Rhizoids]] ====\nRhizoids are usually limited to the bottom of stems and brown in colour \u00b1 smooth rhizoids.

At this meeting, Ray P. Warren was elected as the group's first conductor. In a bid to secure an adequate rehearsal venue from the university for the newly formed band, dePont volunteered the band to provide the music for the [[University_of_Michigan_Law_School|Law School's]] upcoming observance of [[Washington's Birthday]]. This was considered to be one of the most important events of the school year. Delivering on dePont's promise, the band's first public performance was on-stage in University Hall at that celebration on February 22, 1897. University president [[James Burrill Angell]] was satisfied with the band's performance and granted dePont's request for rehearsal space in Room A of University Hall. By 1898, the band was being referred to as the \"University of Michigan Band\" and had become an integral part of the Michigan tradition by playing at the football games.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://mgoblue.com/sports/2017/6/16/marching-band-about-html.aspx?path=spirit | title=About the Michigan Marching Band | website=mgoblue.com | publisher=Board of Regents of the University of Michigan | access-date=2019-03-06 | quote=By the fall of 1898, the presence of the band at the football games had become an integral part of the Michigan football tradition.}}</ref>\n=== 1900 - 1929 ===\nIn these early years, the university provided no financial support for the band. The ensemble disbanded in early 1903 amid a series of leadership changes, but reunited that fall before performing in its first \"snow bowl\" at the game against the [[University of Chicago]] on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]]. The following year, on October 18, 1904, the band reintroduced the playing of \"[[The Victors]]\" at Michigan football games. Eugene J. Fischer became the band's conductor with the start of the 1906 season.<ref name=\"BHL-Band-Records\" />[[File:Michigan Marching Band entering Ferry Field, 1920.png|thumb|390x390px|The 1920 Michigan Marching Band from the Michiganensian yearbook 1921.]]\n\nAfter Michigan moved out of the [[Big Ten Conference#History|Western Football Conference]] during the 1911 season, [[J. Fred Lawton]] and Earl Vincent Moore composed the fight song \"[[Varsity (fight song)|Varsity]],\" which became an immediate hit. Fischer made the song a standard part of the band's football game performances. [[George Olsen]] became the marching band's first drum major in 1914 and inadvertently started the \"[[Michigan_Marching_Band#Goal post toss|Goal Post Toss]]\" tradition during the game against [[Syracuse University]]. During this time, the band was also changing its performance style to incorporate military drill techniques.

In 1936, the term, \"Marching Band\" came into use referring to the portion of the band that played at football games. This group had previously been known as the \"Varsity Band\" or the \"Fighting Band.\" Upon his appointment, Revelli required all male wind instrument majors at the university to participate in the Marching Band.

Like in most [[Big_Ten_Conference|Big Ten]] bands, the MMB drum major is not a conducting position. The drum major provides whistle commands to provide song tempos and parade instructions. While it is not required of the position, most drum majors perform twirling routines during the halftime show. The drum major is also responsible for teaching proper marching techniques during Band Week. The drum major is best known for the [[Michigan Marching Band#Back bend|back bend]] performed during pregame.\n\nAuditions for this position are held yearly in a two-phase process. The first phase is held in front of the MMB staff which narrows the field of candidates. The second phase is held at the band's spring meeting and the final vote is decided by the current members of the MMB.\n\n===Section Leaders===\nSection leaders are the heads of their sections and are responsible for the music performance. They hold weekly music rehearsals for their section. Section leaders are determined by the staff and generally announced at the \"Spring Meeting,\" traditionally held on the last day of Winter semester.\n\n===Rank Leaders===\nRank Leaders are determined in phases. Generally each year during the final stages of the winter semester, band members are invited to nominate people in their own section to be considered for a Rank Leader Candidate spot. Rank Leader Candidates are then selected by the staff and announced during the Spring Meeting or sometimes later. Rank Leader Candidates then participate in a retreat to learn how to teach the marching technique before Band Week begins. Rank Leaders help the incoming members learn the marching techniques, then have two days of review with all other returning members and the incoming members. Band members are then given the chance to fill out Rank Leader evaluations. The staff then narrows down the potential candidates to the actual Rank Leaders for the year, taking the evaluations into account.\n\nDuring the season, Rank Leaders are in charge of the marching position and style of 12 members on the field. They are given full drill charts to ensure that their rank members are in formation. To save paper, regular members are given coordinate sheets to give their position on the field by numbers rather than graphically.\n\n===Performance Block===\nThe Performance Block is the subset of the MMB that performs pre-game and halftime.  An additional subset is called \"halftime only\" which adds to the performance block for halftime.  The halftime block usually consists of an additional 6 piccolos, 6 alto saxophones, 12 horns, 3 bass drums, 4 snare drums, 4 tenor drums, 6 cymbals, and 6 to 12 sousaphones (depending on the drill requirements).\n\nThe rank leaders along with the MMB staff decide which members in block are to be challenged for their position in block.  This method lessens tension in the band as a member does not need to challenge an individual member of the performance block for their position.  There are no minimum or maximum requirements for challenges, and some members may not be challenged every week.\n\nChallenges are typically held after rehearsal on Fridays for the following game. Challenges consist of a halftime marching audition while playing a musical excerpt from the weekly show, followed by performing a portion of the pre-game show.  Results are posted the following Monday.\n\n===Reserves===\nBand members who are not in the performance block, called \"reserves,\" spend each week rehearsing marching fundamentals on an adjacent practice field while the performance block learns the show to prepare for the game.  The reserves are no less a part of the MMB, as they still march to and from the stadium, perform in the stands during football games, provide ancillary support services during the halftime shows, and may be asked (on short notice) to take the place of a performance block member who cannot perform due to injury, illness, or other circumstances.\n\n==Band Week==\nEvery summer during the two weeks before the first home game, the MMB holds its \"Band Week.\" New members, rank leaders, drumline, and flags arrive first to rehearse marching styles and traditional music. New members learn marching fundamentals from the Drum Major and Rank Leaders. The returning members join a few days later and the music audition is held to determine the players' chairs. After the returning members have been through a couple days of marching rehearsal, \"First Look\" is held. During First Look the entire band performs [[glide step]] and a pre-game portion which are both observed and scored by the staff. These performances are given in groups of 8. After the initial performance block is set, it devotes the remainder of Band Week to rehearsing the performance of pre-game and halftime for the first home game of the season. The reserves spend the remainder of Band Week practicing for the next challenge.\n\n\n\n==Routines==\n\n===Saturday morning rehearsal===\nThe Michigan Marching Band practices on Elbel Field in the morning prior to each home game. Practice typically begins at 7:00&nbsp;<small>AM</small> for a game with a noon [[Kickoff (gridiron football)|kickoff]]. The band begins rehearsal with music warm-ups and a review of the halftime music. Next, it rehearses transition elements of the pregame performance. Lastly, the band reviews the drill for the halftime performance. Music is either sung or played at \"half volume\" during this portion of the rehearsal to preserve the band members' [[embouchure]] for the game.\n\n===Step Show===\n[[Image:RevelliHall.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Revelli Hall]]\nThe Michigan Drumline performs the Step Show on the steps of Revelli Hall about an hour and a half before kickoff. The group runs through warm-ups, some pieces arranged specifically for the drumline, the parade cadence series, and closes with \"[[Temptation (Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed song)|Temptation]]\" and \"[[Hawaiian War Chant]].\"\n\n===March to the stadium===\nFollowing the Step Show, the Michigan Marching Band lines up on the steps of Revelli Hall for inspection by the drum major before stepping off to the stadium. Once this is complete, the band begins parading to the stadium by moving out onto Hoover Street. The parade route goes down Hoover Street, turning left onto Greene Street and then into the [[Michigan Stadium]] parking lot. The band then stops in the parking lot among tailgaters and performs a shortened version of \"[[The Victors]]\" the band commonly refers to as \"Parking Lot Victors.\" Once finished, they progress to the mouth of the tunnel of Michigan Stadium where \"[[Let's Go Blue]]\" and the trio of \"The Victors\" is played in the direction of the tunnel.\n\n===Pregame Show===\nThe reserve members leave the parade formation, run down the tunnel onto the field and move into the stands to watch pregame. The remaining band members then enter the tunnel and arrange themselves into \"entry lines\" for the start of the pregame performance. The drum major then proceeds to the lower mouth of the tunnel signaling to the stadium announcer that the band is ready. The [[Michigan Stadium]] and Michigan Marching Band announcer, Carl Grapentine, announces the entrance of the band in his signature baritone: \"Ladies and Gentlemen, presenting the Michigan Marching Band! Baaaand, take the field!\"<ref name=\"Mlive-Grapentine\" />\n\n====Entries====\n[[File:DSC 7256 (15329279660).jpg|thumb|right|361x|Band members doing \"Ups\" during Entries]]\nA style of marching used by the Michigan Marching Band that is not meant to be used while playing. This style is characterized by fast exchanges of the legs, with the knees making a 90-degree bend or less. Using this marching style, the band then 'pours' out of the tunnel onto the field to the \"Entry Cadence\" at approximately 220 [[BPM (music)|BPM]] in \"entry lines\" which then fold out into the \"Fanfare M\" formation, consisting of 192 musicians. After the last game against a non-[[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] team, in addition to Entries, members would raise their arms up in a follow-the-leader fashion at a 45-degree angle, known as \"Ups\". Right before the band folds out into the \"Fanfare M\" formation, the band would the drop their arms in a follow-the-leader fashion at double the pace of \"Ups\". Despite the name, Entries are also used at the end of pregame and halftime shows as a quick, organized, and efficient way to get members off the field as soon as possible.\n\n[[File:UConn vs. Michigan 2010 06 (Michigan Marching Band).JPG|thumb|left|\"Tunnel\" formation used in the Pregame show for the football team entrance.]]\n====\"M Fanfare\"====\nWhile in the \"Fanfare M\" formation, the band plays the \"M Fanfare.\" The \"M Fanfare\" was composed by longtime Michigan Marching Band arranger and composer [[Jerry Bilik]], consisting of portions of \"[[The Victors]],\" \"[[Varsity (fight song)]],\" and \"[[The Yellow and Blue]].\" The band's twirlers and drum major are introduced during the \"M Fanfare.\"\n\n=====Back bend=====\nAt the climax of the \"M Fanfare,\" the drum major performs a signature move. The drum major moves from the middle of the band to the north end 20-yard line. He/she then takes off their hat, turns to face the south end zone, and bends backwards to touch his/her head to the ground. This is done every game. Originally, drum majors kept their hats on and touched their plumes to the ground. \n[[File:Eastern Michigan vs. Michigan 2011 01 (U-M drum major).jpg|thumb|324x324px|Michigan Drum Major Back Bend]]\nThe first drum major to do a back-bend as part of the Michigan Band's pregame show was Mark Brown in the late 1960s. Brown was extremely flexible and could touch the plume to the ground between his heels.\n\nAlbert Ahronheim was the next drum major after Mark Brown, but did not incorporate the back bend into his pregame routine. Instead, he used his gymnastic skills and performed handsprings and back flips.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlive.com/living/jackson/2010/01/peek_through_time_jackson_nati.html|title=Peek through time: Jackson native Albert Ahronheim gave U-M football fans the halftime of their lives|last=Smith|first=Leanne|date=2010-01-23|website=mlive.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref>\n\nThe back bend returned with Jeff Wilkins in 1975.\n\nIn 1993, Matthew Pickus became the first drum major to remove the hat and touch his head to the ground. This feat was first performed during the pregame of the 1993 Michigan-Notre Dame game. Matthew used the hat-less back bend for the rest of his career as drum major. Since approximately 2003, the hat-less back bend has become the standard for Michigan drum majors.\n\n====\"The Victors\"====\nDuring the pregame performance, the band plays the pregame version of \"[[The Victors]]\" while marching across the field to the north end zone. Before the trio starts, an added drum transition occurs, allowing the band to change formations from \"sweep lines\" to the \"hollow block M\" formation. During the transition, Carl Grapentine announces, \"All the Maize and Blue faithful join in a rousing chorus of 'The Victors!'\" These words were introduced during the Becher era.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Carl Grapentine | title=Michigan Marching Band: 1983 Pregame | medium=Video | publisher=YouTube | location=Michigan Stadium | date=1983-10-15 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQjVcxTE4Y&t=140 }}</ref> Prior to that, the announcer would say, \"Let's all join and sing for a big Michigan victory!\"<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Carl Grapentine | title=Michigan Marching Band Pregame, October 13, 1979 | medium=Video | publisher=YouTube | location=Michigan Stadium | date=1979-10-13 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy24ifHg9yA&t=131 }}</ref> For the Ohio State game, he would add another \"big\" to the announcement. The trio of \"The Victors\" is then played while marching to the south end zone.\n\n=====Goal post toss=====\nDuring \"[[The Victors]]\", the drum major marches down to the north end zone goal post and tosses his/her [[Ceremonial mace|mace]] or baton over the cross bar. Superstition says that if the drum major catches the mace without dropping it, the football team will win the game.\n\n=====Lock step / high step=====\nFor the past 15 seasons, while playing the break strain of \"[[The Victors]],\" the Michigan Marching Band performs its [[Chair step|lock step]] (formerly known as high step). This is done for 16 counts at half tempo. In this technique, the \"post leg\" remains perpendicular to the ground while the \"free leg\" makes a right angle with the shin being perpendicular to the ground and an extreme downward toe point. The transition to the next step is made by snapping the free leg down and thrusting the post leg up. This style juxtaposes the more fluid, ''traditional step''.\n\n=====Glide step=====\nIn contrast to the strong, snappy lock step, the traditional [[Glide step|glide step]] is a more fluid and elegant. With the knee of the free leg only making a 60-degree angle, as opposed to the 90-degree angle, this marching style is used during the majority of the pregame show.\n\n====Visitor's fight song====\nImmediately following \"[[The Victors]],\" the band plays the visitor's fight song to the south end zone. The upper section of the south end zone is where a large portion of the visiting fans sit. Playing the visitor's fight song is a strong tradition among all [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] marching bands.\n\n====\"Varsity\"====\nFollowing the visitor's fight song, the band transitions into the school's 1911-1931 fight song \"[[Varsity (fight song)|Varsity]].\" The band once again forms \"sweep lines\" and marches back to the middle of the field and then folds out into another \"Block M\" formation similar to the \"Fanfare M\" formation.\n\n====\"Blues Brothers\"====\n[[File:The Cake, Michigan Marching Band, Michigan Stadium, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan (21733694042).jpg|thumb|347x347px|The \"cake\" formation.]]\nOriginating in 1985, once a year, generally at a game without a visiting band, the Michigan Marching Band performs the [[Otis Redding]] hit \"[[I Can't Turn You Loose]],\" made famous in the movie ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', at midfield. The band forms concentric circles on the field and during a vamp in the music, collapses the circles into what is commonly referred to as \"the cake.\" The entire band fits into a 10-yard diameter circle, centered on the 50-yard line. Once this is complete, the band members scramble back to their \"Fanfare M\" positions. \"I Can't Turn You Loose\" was first performed during the 1980 season during the \"Saturday Afternoon Live\" field show, a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night Live]],'' after which it quickly became popular. \"The Cake\" formation was added in 1985. The song is now also regularly played during the pause in between the third and fourth quarters of football games.\n<br />\n\n[[File:20090926 Michigan Wolverines football team enters the field with marching band salute.jpg|thumb|right|347px|Michigan Wolverines football team enters the field with marching band in tunnel formation]]\n\n====\"Let's Go Blue\" and team entrance====\nTime permitting, the band plays \"[[Let's Go Blue]]\" to the south, east, north and west sides of Michigan Stadium. \"Let's Go Blue\" was written in the mid 1970s by Joseph Carl, a tuba player who was also in the Hockey Pep Band, and Albert Ahronheim, a drum major who also served as a music arranger for the marching band.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1984/05/21/627356/a-catchy-intro-to-a-cheer-became-music-to-the-ears-of-myriad-fans |title=A Catchy Intro To A Cheer Became Music To The Ears Of Myriad Fans |last=Stieg |first=Bill |date=1984-05-21 |website=si.com |publisher=Sports Illustrated |access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mlive.com/living/jackson/2010/01/peek_through_time_jackson_nati.html|title=Peek through time: Jackson native Albert Ahronheim gave U-M football fans the halftime of their lives|last=Smith|first=Leanne|date=2010-01-23|website=mlive.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-29 |quote='He hummed it to me, and two hours later I had done a complete arrangement and copied parts for everyone,' he said. 'The next Saturday, we played it.'}}</ref> The band then splits the diagonal lines of the \"M\" formation to allow room for the \"Go Blue, M Club Supports You\" banner to be raised for the team's entrance, also known as the \"Tunnel Formation\". The team runs onto the field as the band plays the trio of \"[[The Victors]]\" twice.\n\n====\"The Star-Spangled Banner\"====\nSince September 22, 2001, the team has been on the field for the playing of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]].\" The band uses the Henry Fillmore \"trumpeting arrangement\" of the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" further arranged by alumnus [[Robert Longfield]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Michigan Marching Band Performs Star-Spangled Banner at 2005 Rose Bowl Game | date = 2005-01-01 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_WjpNGHPok | access-date = 2019-05-06 }}</ref> The band then collapses the split \"M\" formation back to the solid \"Block M\" formation. Following the playing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" the marching band marches to the north end zone while playing the trio of \"[[The Victors]]\" and, once finished, marches (to the \"Entry Cadence\") off the field.\n\n===Postgame show===\nAfter every home game, the football team runs to the northwest corner of the stadium and joins the band and students in singing \"[[The Yellow and Blue]]\" and a trio of \"[[The Victors]].\" The band then returns to the field and performs \"The Victors\" as written, or in its entirety. They also play selections of the halftime performance. The performance closes with \"Temptation\", \"Hawaiian War Chant,\" \"The Yellow and Blue,\" \"The Victors\" (trio), and the \"Entry Cadence.\" When the football team wins, the band members wear their [[Shako|shakos]] backward during the post-game performance. Visiting bands are invited to join the MMB on the field for a shared postgame show, alternating between musical numbers. After the performance, the band forms into parade lines and marches back through the tunnel and then back to Revelli Hall. When the drum cadence begins, the band chants, \"Go Michigan, beat [whichever team is next on the schedule (e.g. \"[[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|The Fighting Irish]]\")], followed by \"It's great to be a Michigan Wolverine!\" \n\n====\"Temptation\" and \"Hawaiian War Chant\"====\n\"[[Temptation (1933 song)|Temptation]]\" and \"[[Hawaiian War Chant]]\" are percussion features that have been played by the MMB for over 50 years. The cymbal line is highly featured with their acrobatic routine. \"Temptation\" is also played after the defense stops the opposition on third down and forces them to punt. Usually every Homecoming game, during the halftime show, both songs are played. \"Temptation\" is played first, followed by \"Hawaiian War Chant,\" which is introduced by PA announcer Carl Grapentine saying, \"Because you can't have one without the other, the 'Hawaiian War Chant!'\" During the post-game band show, when it comes time for \"Temptation,\" the Drum Major will walk into the band, as the front lines of the formation part, to bring the percussion section forward. This always causes band fans to cheer in anticipation.\n\n== Discography ==\n=== Albums ===\n* ''Forever Valiant'' (2017)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=Forever Valiant |year=2017}}</ref>\n*''This is Michigan'' (2012)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=This is Michigan |others=[[Scott Boerma]], Director |year=2012}}</ref>\n* ''2008 Season Highlights'' (2009)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=2008 Season Highlights |title-link= |others= |year=2009 |publisher=Regents Of The University Of Michigan |id=UMMBCDSPS }}</ref>\n* ''Gameday Faves: Michigan Wolverines Classics'' (2009)<ref>{{cite web |title=Gameday Faves: Michigan Wolverines Classics |url=https://www.amazon.com/Gameday-Faves-Michigan-Wolverines-Classics/dp/B002VBVHYE/ |website=Amazon.com |publisher=2Thumbz Entertainment |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>\n*''The Maize Album'' (2009)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=The Maize Album |others=[[Scott Boerma]], Director |year=2009}}</ref>\n*''The Blue Album'' (2008)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=The Blue Album |others=Jamie L.

At this meeting, Ray P. Warren was elected as the group's first conductor. In a bid to secure an adequate rehearsal venue from the university for the newly formed band, dePont volunteered the band to provide the music for the [[University_of_Michigan_Law_School|Law School's]] upcoming observance of [[Washington's Birthday]]. This was considered to be one of the most important events of the school year. Delivering on dePont's promise, the band's first public performance was on-stage in University Hall at that celebration on February 22, 1897. University president [[James Burrill Angell]] was satisfied with the band's performance and granted dePont's request for rehearsal space in Room A of University Hall. By 1898, the band was being referred to as the \"University of Michigan Band\" and had become an integral part of the Michigan tradition by playing at the football games.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://mgoblue.com/sports/2017/6/16/marching-band-about-html.aspx?path=spirit | title=About the Michigan Marching Band | website=mgoblue.com | publisher=Board of Regents of the University of Michigan | access-date=2019-03-06 | quote=By the fall of 1898, the presence of the band at the football games had become an integral part of the Michigan football tradition.}}</ref>\n=== 1900 - 1929 ===\nIn these early years, the university provided no financial support for the band. The ensemble disbanded in early 1903 amid a series of leadership changes, but reunited that fall before performing in its first \"snow bowl\" at the game against the [[University of Chicago]] on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]]. The following year, on October 18, 1904, the band reintroduced the playing of \"[[The Victors]]\" at Michigan football games. Eugene J. Fischer became the band's conductor with the start of the 1906 season.<ref name=\"BHL-Band-Records\" />[[File:Michigan Marching Band entering Ferry Field, 1920.png|thumb|390x390px|The 1920 Michigan Marching Band from the Michiganensian yearbook 1921.]]\n\nAfter Michigan moved out of the [[Big Ten Conference#History|Western Football Conference]] during the 1911 season, [[J. Fred Lawton]] and Earl Vincent Moore composed the fight song \"[[Varsity (fight song)|Varsity]],\" which became an immediate hit. Fischer made the song a standard part of the band's football game performances. [[George Olsen]] became the marching band's first drum major in 1914 and inadvertently started the \"[[Michigan_Marching_Band#Goal post toss|Goal Post Toss]]\" tradition during the game against [[Syracuse University]]. During this time, the band was also changing its performance style to incorporate military drill techniques. Thanks to Fischer's prolonged efforts to secure university funding for the band, Wilfred Wilson was hired by the university in 1915 as the ensemble's new conductor.<ref name=\"BHL-Band-Records\" />\n\nThe Nu Chapter of the band fraternity, [[Kappa Kappa Psi]], was established to promote and serve the University bands in 1925. Around this time, the university purchased Morris Hall and allocated it as the band's permanent \"home.\" By 1926, membership in the band had grown to nearly 100 musicians prior to Fischer's departure.

Falcone resigned in 1935 after a long struggle with hearing loss, and [[William D. Revelli]], director of the award-winning Hobart, Indiana, high school band, was hired as his successor. In 1936, the term, \"Marching Band\" came into use referring to the portion of the band that played at football games. This group had previously been known as the \"Varsity Band\" or the \"Fighting Band.\" Upon his appointment, Revelli required all male wind instrument majors at the university to participate in the Marching Band. To raise funds for a new band facility, Revelli oversaw an all-campus talent show known as \"Varsity Night.\" This annual event would later evolve into the Band-O-Rama concert series.<ref>{{Citation | title=School of Music, Theatre & Dance (University of Michigan) Publications | publisher=UM Libraries | date=1996 | page=13 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S0nlAAAAMAAJ&lpg=PT615&ots=K6gMspPEf2&dq=-site%3Amichiganmarchingband.com%20%22varsity%20night%22%20band-o-rama&pg=PT615#v=onepage&q=-site:michiganmarchingband.com%20%22varsity%20night%22%20band-o-rama&f=false | access-date=2019-05-06 }}</ref>\n[[File:University of Michigan Band halftime show 1949.jpg|thumb|389x389px|1949 Michigan Band performing a halftime show in Michigan Stadium, Ann Arbor MI.]]\n\nRevelli formally aligned the band with the School of Music in 1940.

Graduate students in the music school or former MMB members that are graduate students in other University programs are hired to help direct the MMB and also to oversee student staff positions.  The MMB also has a color guard instructor, Joan Noble-Pruett, and a percussion instructor, Chuck Ricotta, that each oversee their respective sections to ensure the visual and rhythmic elements of the band are perfect.<ref>{{Citation | title=Band-O-Rama: Victors Valiant! | place=Ann Arbor, MI | publisher=University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance | year=2017 | page=11 | language=English | url=https://issuu.com/umichsmtd/docs/bor17_final/10 }}</ref>\n\n===Drum Major===\nThe Michigan Marching Band has one drum major, commonly referred to as the \"Man Up Front\" or \"Woman Up Front,\" for the entire ensemble. Like in most [[Big_Ten_Conference|Big Ten]] bands, the MMB drum major is not a conducting position. The drum major provides whistle commands to provide song tempos and parade instructions. While it is not required of the position, most drum majors perform twirling routines during the halftime show. The drum major is also responsible for teaching proper marching techniques during Band Week. The drum major is best known for the [[Michigan Marching Band#Back bend|back bend]] performed during pregame.\n\nAuditions for this position are held yearly in a two-phase process. The first phase is held in front of the MMB staff which narrows the field of candidates. The second phase is held at the band's spring meeting and the final vote is decided by the current members of the MMB.\n\n===Section Leaders===\nSection leaders are the heads of their sections and are responsible for the music performance. They hold weekly music rehearsals for their section. Section leaders are determined by the staff and generally announced at the \"Spring Meeting,\" traditionally held on the last day of Winter semester.\n\n===Rank Leaders===\nRank Leaders are determined in phases. Generally each year during the final stages of the winter semester, band members are invited to nominate people in their own section to be considered for a Rank Leader Candidate spot. Rank Leader Candidates are then selected by the staff and announced during the Spring Meeting or sometimes later. Rank Leader Candidates then participate in a retreat to learn how to teach the marching technique before Band Week begins. Rank Leaders help the incoming members learn the marching techniques, then have two days of review with all other returning members and the incoming members. Band members are then given the chance to fill out Rank Leader evaluations. The staff then narrows down the potential candidates to the actual Rank Leaders for the year, taking the evaluations into account.\n\nDuring the season, Rank Leaders are in charge of the marching position and style of 12 members on the field. They are given full drill charts to ensure that their rank members are in formation. To save paper, regular members are given coordinate sheets to give their position on the field by numbers rather than graphically.\n\n===Performance Block===\nThe Performance Block is the subset of the MMB that performs pre-game and halftime.  An additional subset is called \"halftime only\" which adds to the performance block for halftime.  The halftime block usually consists of an additional 6 piccolos, 6 alto saxophones, 12 horns, 3 bass drums, 4 snare drums, 4 tenor drums, 6 cymbals, and 6 to 12 sousaphones (depending on the drill requirements).\n\nThe rank leaders along with the MMB staff decide which members in block are to be challenged for their position in block.  This method lessens tension in the band as a member does not need to challenge an individual member of the performance block for their position.  There are no minimum or maximum requirements for challenges, and some members may not be challenged every week.\n\nChallenges are typically held after rehearsal on Fridays for the following game. Challenges consist of a halftime marching audition while playing a musical excerpt from the weekly show, followed by performing a portion of the pre-game show.  Results are posted the following Monday.\n\n===Reserves===\nBand members who are not in the performance block, called \"reserves,\" spend each week rehearsing marching fundamentals on an adjacent practice field while the performance block learns the show to prepare for the game.  The reserves are no less a part of the MMB, as they still march to and from the stadium, perform in the stands during football games, provide ancillary support services during the halftime shows, and may be asked (on short notice) to take the place of a performance block member who cannot perform due to injury, illness, or other circumstances.\n\n==Band Week==\nEvery summer during the two weeks before the first home game, the MMB holds its \"Band Week.\" New members, rank leaders, drumline, and flags arrive first to rehearse marching styles and traditional music. New members learn marching fundamentals from the Drum Major and Rank Leaders. The returning members join a few days later and the music audition is held to determine the players' chairs. After the returning members have been through a couple days of marching rehearsal, \"First Look\" is held. During First Look the entire band performs [[glide step]] and a pre-game portion which are both observed and scored by the staff. These performances are given in groups of 8. After the initial performance block is set, it devotes the remainder of Band Week to rehearsing the performance of pre-game and halftime for the first home game of the season. The reserves spend the remainder of Band Week practicing for the next challenge.\n\n\n\n==Routines==\n\n===Saturday morning rehearsal===\nThe Michigan Marching Band practices on Elbel Field in the morning prior to each home game. Practice typically begins at 7:00&nbsp;<small>AM</small> for a game with a noon [[Kickoff (gridiron football)|kickoff]]. The band begins rehearsal with music warm-ups and a review of the halftime music. Next, it rehearses transition elements of the pregame performance. Lastly, the band reviews the drill for the halftime performance. Music is either sung or played at \"half volume\" during this portion of the rehearsal to preserve the band members' [[embouchure]] for the game.\n\n===Step Show===\n[[Image:RevelliHall.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Revelli Hall]]\nThe Michigan Drumline performs the Step Show on the steps of Revelli Hall about an hour and a half before kickoff. The group runs through warm-ups, some pieces arranged specifically for the drumline, the parade cadence series, and closes with \"[[Temptation (Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed song)|Temptation]]\" and \"[[Hawaiian War Chant]].\"\n\n===March to the stadium===\nFollowing the Step Show, the Michigan Marching Band lines up on the steps of Revelli Hall for inspection by the drum major before stepping off to the stadium. Once this is complete, the band begins parading to the stadium by moving out onto Hoover Street. The parade route goes down Hoover Street, turning left onto Greene Street and then into the [[Michigan Stadium]] parking lot. The band then stops in the parking lot among tailgaters and performs a shortened version of \"[[The Victors]]\" the band commonly refers to as \"Parking Lot Victors.\" Once finished, they progress to the mouth of the tunnel of Michigan Stadium where \"[[Let's Go Blue]]\" and the trio of \"The Victors\" is played in the direction of the tunnel.\n\n===Pregame Show===\nThe reserve members leave the parade formation, run down the tunnel onto the field and move into the stands to watch pregame. The remaining band members then enter the tunnel and arrange themselves into \"entry lines\" for the start of the pregame performance. The drum major then proceeds to the lower mouth of the tunnel signaling to the stadium announcer that the band is ready. The [[Michigan Stadium]] and Michigan Marching Band announcer, Carl Grapentine, announces the entrance of the band in his signature baritone: \"Ladies and Gentlemen, presenting the Michigan Marching Band! Baaaand, take the field!\"<ref name=\"Mlive-Grapentine\" />\n\n====Entries====\n[[File:DSC 7256 (15329279660).jpg|thumb|right|361x|Band members doing \"Ups\" during Entries]]\nA style of marching used by the Michigan Marching Band that is not meant to be used while playing. This style is characterized by fast exchanges of the legs, with the knees making a 90-degree bend or less. Using this marching style, the band then 'pours' out of the tunnel onto the field to the \"Entry Cadence\" at approximately 220 [[BPM (music)|BPM]] in \"entry lines\" which then fold out into the \"Fanfare M\" formation, consisting of 192 musicians. After the last game against a non-[[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] team, in addition to Entries, members would raise their arms up in a follow-the-leader fashion at a 45-degree angle, known as \"Ups\". Right before the band folds out into the \"Fanfare M\" formation, the band would the drop their arms in a follow-the-leader fashion at double the pace of \"Ups\". Despite the name, Entries are also used at the end of pregame and halftime shows as a quick, organized, and efficient way to get members off the field as soon as possible.\n\n[[File:UConn vs. Michigan 2010 06 (Michigan Marching Band).JPG|thumb|left|\"Tunnel\" formation used in the Pregame show for the football team entrance.]]\n====\"M Fanfare\"====\nWhile in the \"Fanfare M\" formation, the band plays the \"M Fanfare.\" The \"M Fanfare\" was composed by longtime Michigan Marching Band arranger and composer [[Jerry Bilik]], consisting of portions of \"[[The Victors]],\" \"[[Varsity (fight song)]],\" and \"[[The Yellow and Blue]].\" The band's twirlers and drum major are introduced during the \"M Fanfare.\"\n\n=====Back bend=====\nAt the climax of the \"M Fanfare,\" the drum major performs a signature move. The drum major moves from the middle of the band to the north end 20-yard line. He/she then takes off their hat, turns to face the south end zone, and bends backwards to touch his/her head to the ground. This is done every game. Originally, drum majors kept their hats on and touched their plumes to the ground. \n[[File:Eastern Michigan vs. Michigan 2011 01 (U-M drum major).jpg|thumb|324x324px|Michigan Drum Major Back Bend]]\nThe first drum major to do a back-bend as part of the Michigan Band's pregame show was Mark Brown in the late 1960s. Brown was extremely flexible and could touch the plume to the ground between his heels.\n\nAlbert Ahronheim was the next drum major after Mark Brown, but did not incorporate the back bend into his pregame routine. Instead, he used his gymnastic skills and performed handsprings and back flips.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlive.com/living/jackson/2010/01/peek_through_time_jackson_nati.html|title=Peek through time: Jackson native Albert Ahronheim gave U-M football fans the halftime of their lives|last=Smith|first=Leanne|date=2010-01-23|website=mlive.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref>\n\nThe back bend returned with Jeff Wilkins in 1975.\n\nIn 1993, Matthew Pickus became the first drum major to remove the hat and touch his head to the ground. This feat was first performed during the pregame of the 1993 Michigan-Notre Dame game. Matthew used the hat-less back bend for the rest of his career as drum major. Since approximately 2003, the hat-less back bend has become the standard for Michigan drum majors.\n\n====\"The Victors\"====\nDuring the pregame performance, the band plays the pregame version of \"[[The Victors]]\" while marching across the field to the north end zone. Before the trio starts, an added drum transition occurs, allowing the band to change formations from \"sweep lines\" to the \"hollow block M\" formation. During the transition, Carl Grapentine announces, \"All the Maize and Blue faithful join in a rousing chorus of 'The Victors!'\" These words were introduced during the Becher era.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Carl Grapentine | title=Michigan Marching Band: 1983 Pregame | medium=Video | publisher=YouTube | location=Michigan Stadium | date=1983-10-15 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQjVcxTE4Y&t=140 }}</ref> Prior to that, the announcer would say, \"Let's all join and sing for a big Michigan victory!\"<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Carl Grapentine | title=Michigan Marching Band Pregame, October 13, 1979 | medium=Video | publisher=YouTube | location=Michigan Stadium | date=1979-10-13 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy24ifHg9yA&t=131 }}</ref> For the Ohio State game, he would add another \"big\" to the announcement. The trio of \"The Victors\" is then played while marching to the south end zone.\n\n=====Goal post toss=====\nDuring \"[[The Victors]]\", the drum major marches down to the north end zone goal post and tosses his/her [[Ceremonial mace|mace]] or baton over the cross bar. Superstition says that if the drum major catches the mace without dropping it, the football team will win the game.\n\n=====Lock step / high step=====\nFor the past 15 seasons, while playing the break strain of \"[[The Victors]],\" the Michigan Marching Band performs its [[Chair step|lock step]] (formerly known as high step). This is done for 16 counts at half tempo. In this technique, the \"post leg\" remains perpendicular to the ground while the \"free leg\" makes a right angle with the shin being perpendicular to the ground and an extreme downward toe point. The transition to the next step is made by snapping the free leg down and thrusting the post leg up. This style juxtaposes the more fluid, ''traditional step''.\n\n=====Glide step=====\nIn contrast to the strong, snappy lock step, the traditional [[Glide step|glide step]] is a more fluid and elegant. With the knee of the free leg only making a 60-degree angle, as opposed to the 90-degree angle, this marching style is used during the majority of the pregame show.\n\n====Visitor's fight song====\nImmediately following \"[[The Victors]],\" the band plays the visitor's fight song to the south end zone. The upper section of the south end zone is where a large portion of the visiting fans sit. Playing the visitor's fight song is a strong tradition among all [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] marching bands.\n\n====\"Varsity\"====\nFollowing the visitor's fight song, the band transitions into the school's 1911-1931 fight song \"[[Varsity (fight song)|Varsity]].\" The band once again forms \"sweep lines\" and marches back to the middle of the field and then folds out into another \"Block M\" formation similar to the \"Fanfare M\" formation.\n\n====\"Blues Brothers\"====\n[[File:The Cake, Michigan Marching Band, Michigan Stadium, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan (21733694042).jpg|thumb|347x347px|The \"cake\" formation.]]\nOriginating in 1985, once a year, generally at a game without a visiting band, the Michigan Marching Band performs the [[Otis Redding]] hit \"[[I Can't Turn You Loose]],\" made famous in the movie ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', at midfield. The band forms concentric circles on the field and during a vamp in the music, collapses the circles into what is commonly referred to as \"the cake.\" The entire band fits into a 10-yard diameter circle, centered on the 50-yard line. Once this is complete, the band members scramble back to their \"Fanfare M\" positions. \"I Can't Turn You Loose\" was first performed during the 1980 season during the \"Saturday Afternoon Live\" field show, a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night Live]],'' after which it quickly became popular. \"The Cake\" formation was added in 1985. The song is now also regularly played during the pause in between the third and fourth quarters of football games.\n<br />\n\n[[File:20090926 Michigan Wolverines football team enters the field with marching band salute.jpg|thumb|right|347px|Michigan Wolverines football team enters the field with marching band in tunnel formation]]\n\n====\"Let's Go Blue\" and team entrance====\nTime permitting, the band plays \"[[Let's Go Blue]]\" to the south, east, north and west sides of Michigan Stadium. \"Let's Go Blue\" was written in the mid 1970s by Joseph Carl, a tuba player who was also in the Hockey Pep Band, and Albert Ahronheim, a drum major who also served as a music arranger for the marching band.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1984/05/21/627356/a-catchy-intro-to-a-cheer-became-music-to-the-ears-of-myriad-fans |title=A Catchy Intro To A Cheer Became Music To The Ears Of Myriad Fans |last=Stieg |first=Bill |date=1984-05-21 |website=si.com |publisher=Sports Illustrated |access-date=2019-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mlive.com/living/jackson/2010/01/peek_through_time_jackson_nati.html|title=Peek through time: Jackson native Albert Ahronheim gave U-M football fans the halftime of their lives|last=Smith|first=Leanne|date=2010-01-23|website=mlive.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-29 |quote='He hummed it to me, and two hours later I had done a complete arrangement and copied parts for everyone,' he said. 'The next Saturday, we played it.'}}</ref> The band then splits the diagonal lines of the \"M\" formation to allow room for the \"Go Blue, M Club Supports You\" banner to be raised for the team's entrance, also known as the \"Tunnel Formation\". The team runs onto the field as the band plays the trio of \"[[The Victors]]\" twice.\n\n====\"The Star-Spangled Banner\"====\nSince September 22, 2001, the team has been on the field for the playing of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]].\" The band uses the Henry Fillmore \"trumpeting arrangement\" of the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" further arranged by alumnus [[Robert Longfield]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Michigan Marching Band Performs Star-Spangled Banner at 2005 Rose Bowl Game | date = 2005-01-01 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_WjpNGHPok | access-date = 2019-05-06 }}</ref> The band then collapses the split \"M\" formation back to the solid \"Block M\" formation. Following the playing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" the marching band marches to the north end zone while playing the trio of \"[[The Victors]]\" and, once finished, marches (to the \"Entry Cadence\") off the field.\n\n===Postgame show===\nAfter every home game, the football team runs to the northwest corner of the stadium and joins the band and students in singing \"[[The Yellow and Blue]]\" and a trio of \"[[The Victors]].\" The band then returns to the field and performs \"The Victors\" as written, or in its entirety. They also play selections of the halftime performance. The performance closes with \"Temptation\", \"Hawaiian War Chant,\" \"The Yellow and Blue,\" \"The Victors\" (trio), and the \"Entry Cadence.\" When the football team wins, the band members wear their [[Shako|shakos]] backward during the post-game performance. Visiting bands are invited to join the MMB on the field for a shared postgame show, alternating between musical numbers. After the performance, the band forms into parade lines and marches back through the tunnel and then back to Revelli Hall. When the drum cadence begins, the band chants, \"Go Michigan, beat [whichever team is next on the schedule (e.g. \"[[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|The Fighting Irish]]\")], followed by \"It's great to be a Michigan Wolverine!\" \n\n====\"Temptation\" and \"Hawaiian War Chant\"====\n\"[[Temptation (1933 song)|Temptation]]\" and \"[[Hawaiian War Chant]]\" are percussion features that have been played by the MMB for over 50 years. The cymbal line is highly featured with their acrobatic routine. \"Temptation\" is also played after the defense stops the opposition on third down and forces them to punt. Usually every Homecoming game, during the halftime show, both songs are played. \"Temptation\" is played first, followed by \"Hawaiian War Chant,\" which is introduced by PA announcer Carl Grapentine saying, \"Because you can't have one without the other, the 'Hawaiian War Chant!'\" During the post-game band show, when it comes time for \"Temptation,\" the Drum Major will walk into the band, as the front lines of the formation part, to bring the percussion section forward. This always causes band fans to cheer in anticipation.\n\n== Discography ==\n=== Albums ===\n* ''Forever Valiant'' (2017)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=Forever Valiant |year=2017}}</ref>\n*''This is Michigan'' (2012)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=This is Michigan |others=[[Scott Boerma]], Director |year=2012}}</ref>\n* ''2008 Season Highlights'' (2009)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=2008 Season Highlights |title-link= |others= |year=2009 |publisher=Regents Of The University Of Michigan |id=UMMBCDSPS }}</ref>\n* ''Gameday Faves: Michigan Wolverines Classics'' (2009)<ref>{{cite web |title=Gameday Faves: Michigan Wolverines Classics |url=https://www.amazon.com/Gameday-Faves-Michigan-Wolverines-Classics/dp/B002VBVHYE/ |website=Amazon.com |publisher=2Thumbz Entertainment |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>\n*''The Maize Album'' (2009)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=The Maize Album |others=[[Scott Boerma]], Director |year=2009}}</ref>\n*''The Blue Album'' (2008)<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=The Blue Album |others=Jamie L.
