For the first millennium AD, the [[Chamic languages]] were a dialect chain along the Vietnam coast.

The Eastern Cham are mostly [[Hindu]] and continued to use the Indic script. During French colonial times, both groups had to use the [[Latin alphabet]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThere are two varieties of the Cham script: ''Akhar Thrah'' (Eastern Cham) and ''Akhar Srak'' (Western Cham). The two are distinct enough to be encoded in separate blocks.<ref>Hosken, Martin. (2019).

The Cham language is also non-tonal. Words may contain one, two, or three syllables.\"</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\nSimilar to other abugidas, the consonants of Cham have the inherent vowel. Dependent vowel diacritics are used to modify the inherent vowel.<ref name=\"Uni11\" /> Since Cham does not have ''[[virama|vir\u0101ma]]'', special consonants should be used for pure consonants. This practice is similar to the ''chillu consonants'' of the [[Malayalam script]].\n[[Image:Chamscript.png|thumb|The Eastern Cham script. Nasal consonants are shown both unmarked and with the diacritic ''kai''. The vowel diacritics are shown next to a circle, which indicates their position relative to any of the consonants.]]\n\nMost consonant letters, such as {{IPA|[b]}}, {{IPA|[t]}}, or {{IPA|[p]}}, includes an [[inherent vowel]] {{IPA|[a]}} which does not need to be written. The [[nasal stops]], {{IPA|[m]}}, {{IPA|[n]}}, {{IPA|[\u0272]}}, and {{IPA|[\u014b]}} (the latter two transliterated ''nh'' and ''ng'' in the Latin alphabet) are exceptions, and have an inherent vowel {{IPA|[\u0268]}} (transliterated ''eu''). A diacritic called ''kai,'' which does not occur with the other consonants, is added below a nasal consonant to write the {{IPA|[a]}} vowel.<ref name=\"book1\" />\n\nCham words contain vowel and consonant-vowel (V and CV) syllables, apart from the last, which may also be CVC. There are a few characters for final consonants in the Cham script; other consonants merely extend a longer tail on the right side to indicate the absence of a final vowel.<ref name=\"book1\" />\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Consonant letters\n! ka !! kha !! ga !! gha !! \u1e45\u01b0 !! \u1e45a !! ca !! cha !! ja !! jha !! \u00f1\u01b0 !! \u00f1a\n|-\n| {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa06}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa07}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa08}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa09}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa0a}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa0b}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa0c}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa0d}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa0e}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa0f}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa10}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa11}}}}\n|-\n! \u1e47\u0303a !! ta !! tha !! da !! dha !! n\u01b0 !! na !! \u1e0da !! pa !! ppa !! pha !! ba\n|-\n| {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa12}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa13}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa14}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa15}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa16}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa17}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa18}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa19}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa1a}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa1b}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa1c}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa1d}}}}\n|-\n! bha !! m\u01b0 !! ma !! \u1e05a !! ya !! ra !! la !! va !! \u015ba !! sa !! ha\n|-\n| {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa1e}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa1f}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa20}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa21}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa22}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge| \uaa23}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa24}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa25}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa26}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa27}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa28}}}}\n|}\n\n===Medial consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Medial consonants\n|-\n! !! -ya !! -ra !! -rwa !! -la !! -lja !! -lwa !! -wa\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | '''diacritics''' || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\u25cc\uaa33}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\u25cc\uaa34}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\u25cc\uaa34\uaa36}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\u25cc\uaa35}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\u25cc\uaa35\uaa33}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\u25cc\uaa35\uaa36}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\u25cc\uaa36}}}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | '''examples''' || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa06\uaa33}}}}<br>kya || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa06\uaa34}}}}<br>kra || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa08\uaa34\uaa36}}}}<br>grwa || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa06\uaa35}}}}<br>kla || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa06\uaa35\uaa33}}}}<br>klya || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa06\uaa35\uaa36}}}}<br>klwa || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa06\uaa36}}}}<br>kwa\n|}\n\n===Final consonants===\nCham does not employ a [[virama]] to suppress vowels.

The Cham language is also non-tonal. Words may contain one, two, or three syllables.\"</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\nSimilar to other abugidas, the consonants of Cham have the inherent vowel. Dependent vowel diacritics are used to modify the inherent vowel.<ref name=\"Uni11\" /> Since Cham does not have ''[[virama|vir\u0101ma]]'', special consonants should be used for pure consonants. This practice is similar to the ''chillu consonants'' of the [[Malayalam script]].\n[[Image:Chamscript.png|thumb|The Eastern Cham script. Nasal consonants are shown both unmarked and with the diacritic ''kai''. The vowel diacritics are shown next to a circle, which indicates their position relative to any of the consonants.]]\n\nMost consonant letters, such as {{IPA|[b]}}, {{IPA|[t]}}, or {{IPA|[p]}}, includes an [[inherent vowel]] {{IPA|[a]}} which does not need to be written. The [[nasal stops]], {{IPA|[m]}}, {{IPA|[n]}}, {{IPA|[\u0272]}}, and {{IPA|[\u014b]}} (the latter two transliterated ''nh'' and ''ng'' in the Latin alphabet) are exceptions, and have an inherent vowel {{IPA|[\u0268]}} (transliterated ''eu''). A diacritic called ''kai,'' which does not occur with the other consonants, is added below a nasal consonant to write the {{IPA|[a]}} vowel.<ref name=\"book1\" />\n\nCham words contain vowel and consonant-vowel (V and CV) syllables, apart from the last, which may also be CVC. There are a few characters for final consonants in the Cham script; other consonants merely extend a longer tail on the right side to indicate the absence of a final vowel.<ref name=\"book1\" />\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Consonant letters\n! ka !! kha !! ga !! gha !! \u1e45\u01b0 !! \u1e45a !! ca !! cha !! ja !! jha !! \u00f1\u01b0 !! \u00f1a\n|-\n| {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa06}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa07}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa08}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa09}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa0a}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa0b}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa0c}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa0d}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa0e}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa0f}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa10}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa11}}}}\n|-\n! \u1e47\u0303a !! ta !! tha !! da !! dha !! n\u01b0 !! na !! \u1e0da !! pa !! ppa !! pha !! ba\n|-\n| {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa12}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa13}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa14}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa15}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa16}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa17}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa18}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa19}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa1a}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa1b}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa1c}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa1d}}}}\n|-\n! bha !! m\u01b0 !! ma !! \u1e05a !! ya !! ra !! la !! va !! \u015ba !! sa !! ha\n|-\n| {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa1e}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa1f}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa20}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa21}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa22}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge| \uaa23}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa24}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa25}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa26}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa27}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa28}}}}\n|}\n\n===Medial consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Medial consonants\n|-\n! !! -ya !! -ra !! -rwa !! -la !! -lja !! -lwa !! -wa\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | '''diacritics''' || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\u25cc\uaa33}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\u25cc\uaa34}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\u25cc\uaa34\uaa36}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\u25cc\uaa35}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\u25cc\uaa35\uaa33}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\u25cc\uaa35\uaa36}}}} || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\u25cc\uaa36}}}}\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | '''examples''' || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa06\uaa33}}}}<br>kya || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa06\uaa34}}}}<br>kra || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa08\uaa34\uaa36}}}}<br>grwa || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa06\uaa35}}}}<br>kla || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa06\uaa35\uaa33}}}}<br>klya || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa06\uaa35\uaa36}}}}<br>klwa || {{script|Cham|{{huge|\uaa06\uaa36}}}}<br>kwa\n|}\n\n===Final consonants===\nCham does not employ a [[virama]] to suppress vowels.

It  is said that the guild designers who designed this cloth for the kings were forced to teach the Asantes the craft. [[King Adinkra Kofi]]\u2019s first son, [[Adinkra Apaa]], who was said to be well versed in the Adinkra craft, was forced to teach more about Adinkra cloths.

Proto Chakma developed around the 6th century CE. Old Chakma developed in the 8th century CE. Classical Literary Chakma was used in the 11th to 15th centuries and the current Standard Chakma was developed and revived in the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nClassical Chakma was probably a sister script of [[Tai Tham]] and [[Tai Lue]] scripts of Northern [[Thailand]] also from the 8th century CE.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Structure==\nChakma is of the Brahmic type: the consonant letters contain an inherent vowel. Unusually for Brahmic scripts, the inherent vowel in Chakma is a long '\u0101' ([[Open central unrounded vowel|a\u02d0]]) as opposed to short 'a' ([[mid-central vowel|\u0259]]) which is standard in most other languages of India such as [[Hindi]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]] or [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. Consonant clusters are written with conjunct characters, and a visible vowel killer shows the deletion of the inherent vowel when there is no conjunct.\n\n===Vowels===\nFour independent vowels exist: {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03}} a, {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd04}} i, {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd05}} u, and {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd06}} e. Other vowels in initial position are formed by adding the vowel sign to {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03}} a, as in {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03\ud804\udd29}} \u012b, {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03\ud804\udd2b}} \u016b, {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03\ud804\udd2d}} ai, {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03\ud804\udd30}} oi. Some modern writers are generalizing this spelling in {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03\ud804\udd28}} i, {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03\ud804\udd2a}} u, and {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03\ud804\udd2c}} e.\n\nChakma vowel signs with the letter {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} ''ka'' are given below:\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}}  Ka  = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} Ka\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd27}}  Ka  = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd27}} - a (11127)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd28}}  Ki  = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd28}} - i (11128)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd29}}  K\u012b  = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd29}} - \u012b (11129)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd2a}}  Ku  = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd2a}} - u (1112A)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd2b}}  K\u016b  = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd2b}} - \u016b (1112B)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd2c}}  Ke  = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd2c}} - e (1112C)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd2d}}  K\u0101i = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd2d}} - \u0101i (1112D)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd2e}}  Ko  = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd2e}} - o (1112E)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd2f}}  Kau = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd2f}} - au (1112F)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd30}} Koi = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd30}} - oi (11130)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd00}}  Ka\u1e43 = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd00}} - \u1e43 (11100)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd01}}  Ka\u1e43 = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd01}} - \u1e43 (11101)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd02}}  Ka\u1e25 = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd02}} - \u1e25 (11102)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd34}}  K   = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd34}} - MAAYYAA (11134)\n\nOne of the interesting features of Chakma writing is that candrabindu (c\u0101naphud\u0101) can be used together with anusvara (ekaphud\u0101) and visarga (dviphud\u0101):\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03\ud804\udd02\ud804\udd00}}  A\u1e25\u1e43 = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03}} \u0101 +  {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd02 h +  \ud804\udd00\u1e43}}\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03\ud804\udd01\ud804\udd00}}  A\u1e43\u1e43 = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03}} \u0101 +  {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd01 \u1e43 +  \ud804\udd00\u1e43}}\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd05\ud804\udd01\ud804\udd00}}  U\u1e43\u1e43 = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd05}} u +  {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd01 \u1e43 +  \ud804\udd00\u1e43}}\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd1f\ud804\udd2a\ud804\udd00}}  Mu\u1e43 = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd1f}} m\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd2a u +  \ud804\udd00\u1e43}}\n\n===Consonants with killed Vowels and Conjunct Consonants===\nLike other Brahmic scripts, Chakma makes use of the ''maayyaa'' (killer) to invoke conjoined consonants. In the past, practice was much more common than it is today. Like the Myanmar script, Chakma is encoded with two vowel-killing characters in order to conform to modern user expectations. As shown above, most letters have their vowels killed with the use of the explicit ''maayyaa'':\n\n\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd34 k = \ud804\udd07 k\u0101 +  \ud804\udd34 MAAYYAA\n\nIn 2001 an orthographic reform was recommended in the book ''C\u0101\u1e45m\u0101 pattham p\u0101t'' which would limit the standard repertoire of conjuncts to those composed with the five letters \ud804\udd20 y\u0101, \ud804\udd22 r\u0101, \ud804\udd23 l\u0101, \ud804\udd24 w\u0101, and \ud804\udd1a n\u0101.

letters have a descriptive name followed by a traditional Brahmic consonant. These are given in annotations to the character names. Alongside a single and double danda punctuation, Chakma has a unique question mark, and a section sign, ''Phulacihna''. There is some variation in the glyphs for the ''Phulacihna'',some looking like flowers or leaves. A set of digits exists although Bengali digits are also used.\n\n==Unicode==\n{{Main|Chakma (Unicode block)}}\nChakma script was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in January, 2012 with the release of version 6.1.\n\nThe Unicode block for Chakma script is U+11100&ndash;U+1114F.

Proto Chakma developed around the 6th century CE. Old Chakma developed in the 8th century CE. Classical Literary Chakma was used in the 11th to 15th centuries and the current Standard Chakma was developed and revived in the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nClassical Chakma was probably a sister script of [[Tai Tham]] and [[Tai Lue]] scripts of Northern [[Thailand]] also from the 8th century CE.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Structure==\nChakma is of the Brahmic type: the consonant letters contain an inherent vowel. Unusually for Brahmic scripts, the inherent vowel in Chakma is a long '\u0101' ([[Open central unrounded vowel|a\u02d0]]) as opposed to short 'a' ([[mid-central vowel|\u0259]]) which is standard in most other languages of India such as [[Hindi]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]] or [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. Consonant clusters are written with conjunct characters, and a visible vowel killer shows the deletion of the inherent vowel when there is no conjunct.\n\n===Vowels===\nFour independent vowels exist: {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03}} a, {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd04}} i, {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd05}} u, and {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd06}} e. Other vowels in initial position are formed by adding the vowel sign to {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03}} a, as in {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03\ud804\udd29}} \u012b, {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03\ud804\udd2b}} \u016b, {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03\ud804\udd2d}} ai, {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03\ud804\udd30}} oi. Some modern writers are generalizing this spelling in {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03\ud804\udd28}} i, {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03\ud804\udd2a}} u, and {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03\ud804\udd2c}} e.\n\nChakma vowel signs with the letter {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} ''ka'' are given below:\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}}  Ka  = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} Ka\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd27}}  Ka  = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd27}} - a (11127)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd28}}  Ki  = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd28}} - i (11128)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd29}}  K\u012b  = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd29}} - \u012b (11129)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd2a}}  Ku  = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd2a}} - u (1112A)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd2b}}  K\u016b  = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd2b}} - \u016b (1112B)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd2c}}  Ke  = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd2c}} - e (1112C)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd2d}}  K\u0101i = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd2d}} - \u0101i (1112D)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd2e}}  Ko  = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd2e}} - o (1112E)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd2f}}  Kau = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd2f}} - au (1112F)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd30}} Koi = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd30}} - oi (11130)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd00}}  Ka\u1e43 = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd00}} - \u1e43 (11100)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd01}}  Ka\u1e43 = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd01}} - \u1e43 (11101)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd02}}  Ka\u1e25 = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd02}} - \u1e25 (11102)\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd34}}  K   = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd07}} K\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd34}} - MAAYYAA (11134)\n\nOne of the interesting features of Chakma writing is that candrabindu (c\u0101naphud\u0101) can be used together with anusvara (ekaphud\u0101) and visarga (dviphud\u0101):\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03\ud804\udd02\ud804\udd00}}  A\u1e25\u1e43 = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03}} \u0101 +  {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd02 h +  \ud804\udd00\u1e43}}\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03\ud804\udd01\ud804\udd00}}  A\u1e43\u1e43 = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd03}} \u0101 +  {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd01 \u1e43 +  \ud804\udd00\u1e43}}\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd05\ud804\udd01\ud804\udd00}}  U\u1e43\u1e43 = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd05}} u +  {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd01 \u1e43 +  \ud804\udd00\u1e43}}\n\n{{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd1f\ud804\udd2a\ud804\udd00}}  Mu\u1e43 = {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd1f}} m\u0101 + {{Script/Chakma|\ud804\udd2a u +  \ud804\udd00\u1e43}}\n\n===Consonants with killed Vowels and Conjunct Consonants===\nLike other Brahmic scripts, Chakma makes use of the ''maayyaa'' (killer) to invoke conjoined consonants. In the past, practice was much more common than it is today. Like the Myanmar script, Chakma is encoded with two vowel-killing characters in order to conform to modern user expectations. As shown above, most letters have their vowels killed with the use of the explicit ''maayyaa'':\n\n\ud804\udd07\ud804\udd34 k = \ud804\udd07 k\u0101 +  \ud804\udd34 MAAYYAA\n\nIn 2001 an orthographic reform was recommended in the book ''C\u0101\u1e45m\u0101 pattham p\u0101t'' which would limit the standard repertoire of conjuncts to those composed with the five letters \ud804\udd20 y\u0101, \ud804\udd22 r\u0101, \ud804\udd23 l\u0101, \ud804\udd24 w\u0101, and \ud804\udd1a n\u0101.

letters have a descriptive name followed by a traditional Brahmic consonant. These are given in annotations to the character names. Alongside a single and double danda punctuation, Chakma has a unique question mark, and a section sign, ''Phulacihna''. There is some variation in the glyphs for the ''Phulacihna'',some looking like flowers or leaves. A set of digits exists although Bengali digits are also used.\n\n==Unicode==\n{{Main|Chakma (Unicode block)}}\nChakma script was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in January, 2012 with the release of version 6.1.\n\nThe Unicode block for Chakma script is U+11100&ndash;U+1114F.

It was reinvented by {{nobr|Dr. Thomas Flo Lewis}}, who rediscovered the script in South America from descendants of Bassa Slaves taken to the Americas he  instigated publishing of limited materials in the language from the mid-1900s through the 1930s, with its height in the 1910s and 1920s. It is alleged that some of the signs are based on native Bassa pictograms revealed by a former slave. It is not clear what connection it may have had with neighboring scripts, but [[Sort (typesetting)|type]] was cast for it, and an association for its promotion was formed in Liberia in 1959. It is not used contemporarily and has been classified as a failed script.<ref>Unseth, Peter. 2011. Invention of Scripts in West Africa for Ethnic Revitalization.

It was reinvented by {{nobr|Dr. Thomas Flo Lewis}}, who rediscovered the script in South America from descendants of Bassa Slaves taken to the Americas he  instigated publishing of limited materials in the language from the mid-1900s through the 1930s, with its height in the 1910s and 1920s. It is alleged that some of the signs are based on native Bassa pictograms revealed by a former slave. It is not clear what connection it may have had with neighboring scripts, but [[Sort (typesetting)|type]] was cast for it, and an association for its promotion was formed in Liberia in 1959. It is not used contemporarily and has been classified as a failed script.<ref>Unseth, Peter. 2011. Invention of Scripts in West Africa for Ethnic Revitalization.

It is divided into two or three varieties: Lampung Api (also called Pesisir or A-dialect), Lampung Nyo (also called Abung or O-dialect), and Komering. The latter is sometimes included in Lampung Api, sometimes treated as an entirely separate language. [[Komering people]] see themselves as ethnically separate from, but related to, Lampung people.\n\nAlthough Lampung has a relatively large number of speakers, it is a minority language in the province of [[Lampung]], where most of the speakers live. Concerns over the endangerment of the language has led the provincial government to implement the teaching of Lampung language and [[Lampung script|script]] for primary and secondary education in the province.{{sfn|Katubi|2007|p=9}}\n\n==Classification==\n===External relationship===\nLampung is part of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] branch of [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] family, although its position within Malayo-Polynesian is hard to determine. Language contact over centuries has blurred the line between Lampung and Malay,{{sfn|Walker|1976|p=1}}{{sfn|Anderbeck|2007|pp=7\u20138}}{{sfn|Smith|2017|p=459}} to the extent that they were grouped into the same subfamily in older works, such as that of [[Isidore Dyen]] in 1965, in which Lampung is placed inside the \"Malayic Hesion\" alongside [[Malayan languages|Malayan]] ([[Malay language|Malay]], [[Minangkabau language|Minangkabau]], [[Kerinci language|Kerinci]]), [[Acehnese language|Acehnese]] and [[Madurese language|Madurese]].{{sfn|Dyen|1965|p=26}}\n\nNothofer (1985) separates Lampung from Dyen's Malayic, but still include it in the wider \"Javo-Sumatra Hesion\" alongside [[Malayic languages|Malayic]], [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], Madurese, and more distantly, [[Javanese language|Javanese]].{{sfn|Nothofer|1985|p=298}} Ross (1995) assigns Lampung its own group, unclassified within Malayo-Polynesian.{{sfn|Ross|1995|pp=75, 78}} This position is followed by Adelaar (2005), who excludes Lampung from his [[Malayo-Sumbawan languages|Malayo-Sumbawan]] grouping\u2014which includes Sundanese, Madurese, and Malayo-Chamic-BSS (comprising Malayic,{{efn|The term \"Malayic\" has been defined differently by various linguists over time.

Smith identifies some WIn lexical innovations in Lampung, but it is hard to tell whether these words are inherited from Proto-WIn or borrowed later from Malay.{{sfn|Smith|2017|p=459}} While Smith supports its inclusion in the WIn subgroup, he states that the matter is still subject to debate.{{sfn|Smith|2017|p=459}}\n\n===Dialects===\n{{see also|Komering language}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float: right; margin: 1.2em\"\n|+ Lexical differences between Lampung dialects{{sfn|Walker|1976|p=1}}\n!

Some Lampungic-speaking groups (such as the Komering and Kayu Agung peoples) reject the \"Lampung\" label, although there is some understanding among them that they are \"ethnically related to the Lampung people of Lampung Province\".{{sfn|Hanawalt|2007|pp=32, 34}}  While many researchers consider Komering as part of Lampung Api, Hanawalt argues that there is enough linguistic and sociological differences to break down the western chain into two or more subdivisions; he thus proposes a Komering dialect chain, separate from Lampung Api.{{sfn|Hanawalt|2007|p=35}}\n\n==Demography and status==\nLike other [[languages of Indonesia|regional languages of Indonesia]], Lampung is not recognized as an [[official language]] anywhere in the country, and as such it is mainly used in informal situations.{{sfn|Amisani|1985|p=1}} Lampung is in vigorous use in rural areas where the Lampung ethnic group is the majority. A large percentage of speakers in these areas almost exclusively use Lampung at home, and use [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] on more formal occasions.{{sfn|Katubi|2007|p=4\u20135, 8\u20139}}{{sfn|Amisani|1985|p=7}} In the market where people of different backgrounds meet, a mix of languages is used, including local lingua franca like [[Musi language|Palembang Malay]].{{sfn|Katubi|2007|p=6}} In the 1970s, although Lampung was pretty much alive in rural areas, Lampung youths in urban areas already prefer to use Indonesian instead.{{sfn|Walker|1976|p=1}} In general, there seems to be a trend of \"[[diglossia leakage]]\" in the bilingual Lampung communities, where Indonesian is increasingly used in domains traditionally associated with Lampung language usage.{{sfn|Katubi|2007|p=4\u20135, 8\u20139}}\n\n[[File:Tari Melinting 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|A woman in Lampung traditional attire]]\nSince the early 20th century, the province of Lampung has been a major destination for the [[transmigration program]], which moves people from the more densely populated islands of Indonesia (then [[Dutch East Indies]]) to the less densely populated ones.{{sfn|Kusworo|2014|pp=23\u201324}}{{sfn|Aliana|1986|p=18}} The program came to a halt during an interlude following the outbreak of [[World War II]], but the government resumed it several years after [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesian independence]].{{sfn|Kusworo|2014|pp=23\u201324}} By the mid-1980s, Lampung people had become a minority in the province, accounting for no more than 15% of the population, down from 70% in 1920.{{sfn|Kusworo|2014|p=25}} This demographic shift is also reflected in language usage; the [[Indonesia 1980 census|1980 census]] reported that 78% of the province's population were native speakers of either Javanese, Sundanese, Madurese, or Balinese.{{sfn|Katubi|2007|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nAs an effort to maintain the indigenous language and \"to help define Lampung\u2019s identity and cultural symbol\", post-[[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] era Lampung regional government{{efn|The regional government of Lampung is still largely dominated by indigenous Lampung people, down to village level.{{sfn|Katubi|2007|pp=2\u20133}}}} has made Lampung language a compulsory subject for all students attending primary and secondary educational institutions across the province.{{sfn|Katubi|2007|pp=2\u20133}}{{sfn|Inawati|2017|pp=168\u2013169}} The [[Lampung University|state university of Lampung]] runs a [[master's degree]] program in Lampung language study.{{sfn|''Antaranews.com'' 17 October 2018}} The university once also held an [[associate degree]] in Lampung language study, but the program was temporarily halted in 2007 due to a change in regulation.{{sfn|Inawati|2017|pp=168\u2013169}} Nevertheless, the university has announced a plan to launch a [[bachelor's degree]] in Lampung language study by 2019.{{sfn|''Antaranews.com'' 17 October 2018}}\n\n==Phonology==\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Basic vowels and diphthongs{{sfn|Anderbeck|2007|p=16}}\n!\n!

Western varieties consistently realize [[Ultima (linguistics)|ultimate]] {{IPA|/\u0259/}} as {{IPA|[o]}}; additionally, [[penultimate]] {{IPA|/\u0259/}} also becomes {{IPA|[o]}} in varieties spoken throughout the Komering river basin. In many Nyo dialects, final {{IPA|/\u0259/}} is reflected as an {{IPA|[o]}} or {{IPA|[a]}} if it is followed by {{IPA|/h/}} or {{IPA|/\u0294/}}. In the Nyo dialect of Blambangan Pagar, final {{IPA|/\u0259/}} is realized as {{IPA|[a]}} only if the previous vowel is also a schwa; otherwise, {{IPA|/\u0259/}} is realized as {{IPA|[\u0259]}}.

Final /o/ is variously realized as {{IPA|[\u0259\u0361\u0254]}}, {{IPA|[ow]}}, or similar diphthongs. Most Nyo speakers also pronounce final {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} as {{IPA|[\u0259j]}} and {{IPA|[\u0259w]}}, respectively.{{sfn|Anderbeck|2007|p=22}} This diphthongization of final vowels in open syllables occurs in all Nyo varieties, except in the Jabung subdialect.{{sfn|Hanawalt|2007|p=31}}\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Basic consonants{{sfn|Anderbeck|2007|pp=14\u201315}}\n!\n!

Examples include {{lang|ljp|hiru\u0294}} 'cloud' from Proto-Lampungic *rihu\u0294, {{lang|ljp|g\u0259ral}} \u2018name\u2019 from PLP *g\u0259lar,{{sfn|Anderbeck|2007|pp=14\u201315}} and the near-universal metathesis of PLP *hat\u0259luy (from PMP *qateluR) to {{lang|ljp|tahlui}} 'egg' or similar forms.{{sfn|Anderbeck|2007|pp=62, 87\u201388}} Another common\u2013yet irregular\u2013phonological change in Lampungic cluster is [[debuccalization]], which occurs in almost all varieties. PLP *p and *t are often targets of debuccalization; *k is less affected by the change.{{sfn|Anderbeck|2007|pp=14\u201315}}\n\nConsonant [[gemination]] is also common in Lampung, especially in Nyo and some Api varieties, but almost unknown in Komering. Gemination often happens to consonants preceded by penultimate schwa or historical voiceless nasal (which got reduced to the stop component). Cases of gemination in medial positions have been recorded for all consonants except {{IPA|/\u0272/}}, {{IPA|/\u014b/}}, {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}.{{sfn|Anderbeck|2007|pp=14\u201315}}\n\n===Phonotactics===\nThe most common syllable patterns are CV and CVC. [[Consonant cluster]]s are found in a few borrowed words, and only word-initially. These consonant clusters are also in free variation with sequences separated by schwas (CC~C\u0259C).{{sfn|Walker|1976|pp=3\u20134}} [[Disyllabic]] roots take the form (C)V.CV(C). Semivowels in medial positions are not contrastive with their absences.{{sfn|Walker|1976|p=5}}\n\n===Stress===\nWords are always stressed in the [[ultima (linguistics)|final syllable]], regardless whether they are affixed or not. The stress though is very light and can be distorted by the overall phrasal [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]. Partially free clitics, on the other hand, are never stressed except when they appear in the middle of an intonation contour.{{sfn|Walker|1976|p=5}}\n\n==Grammar==\n===Pronouns===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Personal pronouns<br/>{{nobold|(Pesisir dialect)}}{{sfn|Walker|1976|p=2}}\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Meaning !! colspan=\"2\"|Independent<br/>pronoun !! rowspan=\"2\"|Clitic{{sfn|Udin|1992|pp=41\u201343}}\n|-\n! lower !! higher\n|-\n|{{gcl|1S|first person singular}} 'I' || ''nyak'' || ''saya'' || ''ku''=, =''ku''\n|-\n|{{gcl|2S|second person singular}} 'You (singular)' || ''niku'' || ''pusikam'' || =''mu''\n|-\n|{{gcl|3S|third person singular}} 'He/she' || ''ia'' || ''beliau'' || =''ni''\n|-\n|{{gcl|1P.EXCL|first person plural, exclusive}} 'We (exclusive)' || ''sikam'' || ''sikandua''{{efn|Also used as a polite counterpart of the first person singular pronoun.}} || \u2013 \n|-\n|{{gcl|1P.INCL|first person plural, inclusive}} 'We (inclusive)' || ''ram'' || ''ram'' || \u2013\n|-\n|{{gcl|2P|second person plural}} 'You (plural)' || ''kuti'' || ''pusikam'' || \u2013\n|-\n|{{gcl|3P|third person plural}} 'They' || ''tian'' || ''beliau'' || \u2013\n|}\n\nLike in some Indonesian languages, there is a distinction between the \"lower\" and \"higher\" forms of words based on the degrees of formality and the age or status of the speaker relative to the listener, although this distinction is only limited to pronouns and some words.{{sfn|Walker|1976|p=2}} The \"lower\" forms are used when addressing younger people, or people with close relationship; while the \"higher\" forms are used when addressing older people or those with higher status.{{sfn|Udin|1992|pp=41\u201343}} Personal pronouns can act like [[proclitic]]s or free words. [[Enclitic]] pronouns are used to mark possession.{{sfn|Walker|1976|p=5}} When speaking formally, the \"higher\" forms of pronouns are used instead of clitics.{{sfn|Udin|1992|pp=41\u201343}}\n\n===Reduplication===\nAs with many other Austronesian languages, [[reduplication]] is still a productive [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] process in Lampung. Lampung has both full reduplication, which is the complete repetition of a [[morpheme]], and partial reduplication, which is the addition of a prefix to a morpheme consisting of its first consonant + {{IPA|/a/}}. Some morphemes are inherently reduplicated, such as {{lang|ljp|acang-acang}} 'pigeon' and {{lang|ljp|lalawah}} 'spider'.{{sfn|Walker|1976|p=25}}\n\nNouns are fully reduplicated to indicate [[plural]]ity and variety, as in {{lang|ljp|sanak-sanak}} 'children' from {{lang|ljp|sanak}} 'child'{{sfn|Walker|1976|p=25}} and {{lang|abl|punyeu-punyeu}} 'fishes' from {{lang|abl|punyeu}} 'fish'.{{sfn|Wetty|1992|p=63\u201364}} Partial reduplication of nouns can convey the same meaning, but this formation is not as productive as full reduplication. More often, partial reduplication is used to signify a similarity between the root word and the derived noun:{{efn|Unless stated otherwise, all examples given in this and the following sections are taken from {{harvtxt|Walker|1976}}, with spelling adapted to {{harvtxt|Walker|1975}}, in which \u27e8e\u27e9 always represents {{IPA|[\u0259]}}, final \u27e8k\u27e9 represents {{IPA|[\u0294]}} (although some dialects contrast glottal stop with {{IPA|/k/}} in this position), and \u27e8r\u27e9 represents the various reflexes of {{IPA|/r/}} in the Lampung cluster.

It has 20 main characters and 13 diacritics.{{sfn|Junaidi et. al.|2013|p=664}} This script is most similar to the [[Rencong script|Kerinci]], [[Rejang script|Rejang]], and [[Batak script|Batak]] scripts used by various ethnic groups in the same island of Sumatra.

It is divided into two or three varieties: Lampung Api (also called Pesisir or A-dialect), Lampung Nyo (also called Abung or O-dialect), and Komering. The latter is sometimes included in Lampung Api, sometimes treated as an entirely separate language. [[Komering people]] see themselves as ethnically separate from, but related to, Lampung people.\n\nAlthough Lampung has a relatively large number of speakers, it is a minority language in the province of [[Lampung]], where most of the speakers live. Concerns over the endangerment of the language has led the provincial government to implement the teaching of Lampung language and [[Lampung script|script]] for primary and secondary education in the province.{{sfn|Katubi|2007|p=9}}\n\n==Classification==\n===External relationship===\nLampung is part of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] branch of [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] family, although its position within Malayo-Polynesian is hard to determine.

Smith identifies some WIn lexical innovations in Lampung, but it is hard to tell whether these words are inherited from Proto-WIn or borrowed later from Malay.{{sfn|Smith|2017|p=459}} While Smith supports its inclusion in the WIn subgroup, he states that the matter is still subject to debate.{{sfn|Smith|2017|p=459}}\n\n===Dialects===\n{{see also|Komering language}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float: right; margin: 1.2em\"\n|+ Lexical differences between Lampung dialects{{sfn|Walker|1976|p=1}}\n!

Some Lampungic-speaking groups (such as the Komering and Kayu Agung peoples) reject the \"Lampung\" label, although there is some understanding among them that they are \"ethnically related to the Lampung people of Lampung Province\".{{sfn|Hanawalt|2007|pp=32, 34}}  While many researchers consider Komering as part of Lampung Api, Hanawalt argues that there is enough linguistic and sociological differences to break down the western chain into two or more subdivisions; he thus proposes a Komering dialect chain, separate from Lampung Api.{{sfn|Hanawalt|2007|p=35}}\n\n==Demography and status==\nLike other [[languages of Indonesia|regional languages of Indonesia]], Lampung is not recognized as an [[official language]] anywhere in the country, and as such it is mainly used in informal situations.{{sfn|Amisani|1985|p=1}} Lampung is in vigorous use in rural areas where the Lampung ethnic group is the majority. A large percentage of speakers in these areas almost exclusively use Lampung at home, and use [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] on more formal occasions.{{sfn|Katubi|2007|p=4\u20135, 8\u20139}}{{sfn|Amisani|1985|p=7}} In the market where people of different backgrounds meet, a mix of languages is used, including local lingua franca like [[Musi language|Palembang Malay]].{{sfn|Katubi|2007|p=6}} In the 1970s, although Lampung was pretty much alive in rural areas, Lampung youths in urban areas already prefer to use Indonesian instead.{{sfn|Walker|1976|p=1}} In general, there seems to be a trend of \"[[diglossia leakage]]\" in the bilingual Lampung communities, where Indonesian is increasingly used in domains traditionally associated with Lampung language usage.{{sfn|Katubi|2007|p=4\u20135, 8\u20139}}\n\n[[File:Tari Melinting 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|A woman in Lampung traditional attire]]\nSince the early 20th century, the province of Lampung has been a major destination for the [[transmigration program]], which moves people from the more densely populated islands of Indonesia (then [[Dutch East Indies]]) to the less densely populated ones.{{sfn|Kusworo|2014|pp=23\u201324}}{{sfn|Aliana|1986|p=18}} The program came to a halt during an interlude following the outbreak of [[World War II]], but the government resumed it several years after [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesian independence]].{{sfn|Kusworo|2014|pp=23\u201324}} By the mid-1980s, Lampung people had become a minority in the province, accounting for no more than 15% of the population, down from 70% in 1920.{{sfn|Kusworo|2014|p=25}} This demographic shift is also reflected in language usage; the [[Indonesia 1980 census|1980 census]] reported that 78% of the province's population were native speakers of either Javanese, Sundanese, Madurese, or Balinese.{{sfn|Katubi|2007|pp=2\u20133}}\n\nAs an effort to maintain the indigenous language and \"to help define Lampung\u2019s identity and cultural symbol\", post-[[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] era Lampung regional government{{efn|The regional government of Lampung is still largely dominated by indigenous Lampung people, down to village level.{{sfn|Katubi|2007|pp=2\u20133}}}} has made Lampung language a compulsory subject for all students attending primary and secondary educational institutions across the province.{{sfn|Katubi|2007|pp=2\u20133}}{{sfn|Inawati|2017|pp=168\u2013169}} The [[Lampung University|state university of Lampung]] runs a [[master's degree]] program in Lampung language study.{{sfn|''Antaranews.com'' 17 October 2018}} The university once also held an [[associate degree]] in Lampung language study, but the program was temporarily halted in 2007 due to a change in regulation.{{sfn|Inawati|2017|pp=168\u2013169}} Nevertheless, the university has announced a plan to launch a [[bachelor's degree]] in Lampung language study by 2019.{{sfn|''Antaranews.com'' 17 October 2018}}\n\n==Phonology==\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Basic vowels and diphthongs{{sfn|Anderbeck|2007|p=16}}\n!\n!

Western varieties consistently realize [[Ultima (linguistics)|ultimate]] {{IPA|/\u0259/}} as {{IPA|[o]}}; additionally, [[penultimate]] {{IPA|/\u0259/}} also becomes {{IPA|[o]}} in varieties spoken throughout the Komering river basin. In many Nyo dialects, final {{IPA|/\u0259/}} is reflected as an {{IPA|[o]}} or {{IPA|[a]}} if it is followed by {{IPA|/h/}} or {{IPA|/\u0294/}}. In the Nyo dialect of Blambangan Pagar, final {{IPA|/\u0259/}} is realized as {{IPA|[a]}} only if the previous vowel is also a schwa; otherwise, {{IPA|/\u0259/}} is realized as {{IPA|[\u0259]}}.

Gemination often happens to consonants preceded by penultimate schwa or historical voiceless nasal (which got reduced to the stop component). Cases of gemination in medial positions have been recorded for all consonants except {{IPA|/\u0272/}}, {{IPA|/\u014b/}}, {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}.{{sfn|Anderbeck|2007|pp=14\u201315}}\n\n===Phonotactics===\nThe most common syllable patterns are CV and CVC.

These consonant clusters are also in free variation with sequences separated by schwas (CC~C\u0259C).{{sfn|Walker|1976|pp=3\u20134}} [[Disyllabic]] roots take the form (C)V.CV(C). Semivowels in medial positions are not contrastive with their absences.{{sfn|Walker|1976|p=5}}\n\n===Stress===\nWords are always stressed in the [[ultima (linguistics)|final syllable]], regardless whether they are affixed or not. The stress though is very light and can be distorted by the overall phrasal [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]].

[[Enclitic]] pronouns are used to mark possession.{{sfn|Walker|1976|p=5}} When speaking formally, the \"higher\" forms of pronouns are used instead of clitics.{{sfn|Udin|1992|pp=41\u201343}}\n\n===Reduplication===\nAs with many other Austronesian languages, [[reduplication]] is still a productive [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] process in Lampung. Lampung has both full reduplication, which is the complete repetition of a [[morpheme]], and partial reduplication, which is the addition of a prefix to a morpheme consisting of its first consonant + {{IPA|/a/}}. Some morphemes are inherently reduplicated, such as {{lang|ljp|acang-acang}} 'pigeon' and {{lang|ljp|lalawah}} 'spider'.{{sfn|Walker|1976|p=25}}\n\nNouns are fully reduplicated to indicate [[plural]]ity and variety, as in {{lang|ljp|sanak-sanak}} 'children' from {{lang|ljp|sanak}} 'child'{{sfn|Walker|1976|p=25}} and {{lang|abl|punyeu-punyeu}} 'fishes' from {{lang|abl|punyeu}} 'fish'.{{sfn|Wetty|1992|p=63\u201364}} Partial reduplication of nouns can convey the same meaning, but this formation is not as productive as full reduplication.

{"title_page": "Atomic spies", "text_new": "[[Image:Klaus Fuchs ID badge.png|right|thumb|[[Klaus Fuchs]], arguably the most important of the identified \"atomic spies\" for his extensive access to high-level scientific data and his ability to make sense of it through his technical training.]]\n\n'''Atomic spies''' or '''atom spies''' were people in the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Canada]] who are known to have [[espionage|illicitly given information]] about [[nuclear weapon]]s production or design to the [[Soviet Union]] during [[World War II]] and the early [[Cold War]]. Exactly what was given, and whether everyone on the list gave it, are still matters of some scholarly dispute. In some cases, some of the arrested suspects or government witnesses had given strong testimonies or confessions which they recanted later or said were fabricated.  Their work constitutes the most publicly well-known and well-documented case of [[nuclear espionage]] in the [[history of nuclear weapons]]. At the same time, numerous nuclear scientists wanted to share the information with the world scientific community, but this proposal was firmly quashed by the United States government. \n\nConfirmation about espionage work came from the [[Venona project]], which intercepted and decrypted Soviet intelligence reports sent during and after World War II. These provided clues to the identity of several spies at Los Alamos and elsewhere, some of whom have never been identified. Some of this information was available to the government during the 1950s trials, but it was not usable in court as it was highly classified. Additionally, historians have found that records from Soviet archives, which were briefly opened to researchers after the fall of the Soviet Union, included more information about some spies.\n\n==Importance==\nBefore [[World War II]], the theoretical possibility of [[nuclear fission]] resulted in intense discussion among leading physicists world-wide. Scientists from the [[Soviet Union]] were later recognized for their contributions to the understanding of a nuclear reality, and won several Nobel Prizes. Soviet scientists such as [[Igor Kurchatov]], [[Lev Landau|L. D. Landau]], and [[Cyril Sinelnikov|Kirill Sinelnikov]] helped establish the idea of, and prove the existence of, a splittable atom. Dwarfed by the [[Manhattan Project]] conducted by the US during the war, the significance of the Soviet contributions has been rarely understood or credited outside the field of physics. According to several sources, it was understood on a theoretical level that the atom provided for extremely powerful and novel releases of energy, and could possibly be used in the future for military purposes.<ref>Schwartz, Michael. ''The Russian-A(merican) Bomb: The Role of Espionage in the Soviet Atomic Bomb Project.'' J. Undergrad. Sci. 3: 103\u2013108 (Summer 1996) http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jus/0302/schwartz.pdf</ref><!-- Isn't there another source? --> \n\nIn recorded comments, physicists lamented their inability to achieve any kind of practical application from the discoveries. They thought that creation of an atomic weapon was unattainable. According to a United States Congressional joint committee, although the scientists could conceivably have been first to generate a man-made fission reaction, they lacked the ambition, funding, engineering capability, [[leadership]], and ultimately, the capability to do so. The undertaking would be of an unimaginable scale, and the resources required to engineer for such use as a nuclear bomb, and nuclear power were deemed too great to pursue.<ref name=\"archive.org\">Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. ''Soviet Atomic Espionage.'' Chapters 2\u20133 United States Government Printing Office, Washington, 1951. https://archive.org/stream/sovietatomicespi1951unit#page/n3/mode/2up</ref>\n\nAt the urging of [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Leo Szilard]] in their [[Einstein\u2013Szil\u00e1rd letter|letter of August 2, 1939]], the [[United States]]&nbsp;\u2014 in collaboration with [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Canada]]&nbsp;\u2014 recognized the potential significance of an atomic bomb. They embarked in 1942 upon work to achieve a usable device. Estimates suggest that during the quest to create the atomic bomb, an investment of $2 billion, 86,000 tons of silver and 24,000 skilled workers drove the research and development phase of the project.<ref>Schwartz, Michael. Russian Bomb 103-08</ref>  Those skilled workers included the people to maintain and operate the machinery necessary for research. The largest Western facility had five hundred scientists working on the project, as well as a team of fifty to derive the equations for the cascade of neutrons required to drive the reaction. The fledgling equivalent Soviet program was quite different: The program consisted of fifty scientists, and two mathematicians trying to work out the equations for the particle cascade.<ref>Schwartz, Michael. Russian Bomb 103-08f</ref>  The research and development of techniques to produce sufficiently enriched uranium and plutonium were beyond the scope and efforts of the Soviet group. The knowledge of techniques and strategies that the Allied programs employed, and which Soviet espionage obtained, may have played a role in the rapid development of the Soviet bomb after the war.\n\nThe research and development of methods suitable for [[dopant|doping]] and separating the highly reactive isotopes needed to create the payload for a nuclear warhead took years, and consumed a vast amount of resources. The United States and Great Britain dedicated their best scientists to this cause and constructed three plants, each with a different isotope-extraction method.<ref>Allen Weinstein and Alexander Vassiliev, \"Atomic Espionage: from Fuchs to the Rosenburgs\" in ''The Haunted Wood,'' (New York: Random House Inc, 1999), 172\u2013222.</ref>  The Allied program decided to use gas-phase extraction to obtain the pure uranium necessary for an atomic detonation.<ref name=\"archive.org\" />  Using this method took large quantities of uranium ore and other rare materials, such as graphite, to successfully purify the U-235 isotope. The quantities required for the development were beyond the scope and purview of the Soviet program.\n\nThe Soviet Union did not have natural uranium-ore mines at the start of the nuclear arms race. A lack of materials made it very difficult for them to conduct novel research or to map out a clear pathway to achieving the fuel they needed. The Soviet scientists became frustrated with the difficulties of producing uranium fuel cheaply, and they found their industrial techniques for refinement lacking. The use of information stolen from the [[Manhattan Project]] eventually rectified the problem.<ref>Weinstein and Vassiliev (1999), \"Atomic Espionage,\" 180\u201385</ref> Without such information, the problems of the Soviet atomic team would have taken many years to correct, affecting the production of a Soviet atomic weapon significantly.\n\nSome historians believe that the Soviet Union achieved its great leaps in its atomic program by the espionage information and technical data that [[Moscow]] succeeded in obtaining from the Manhattan Project. Once the Soviets had learned of the American plans to develop an atomic bomb during the 1940s, Moscow began recruiting agents to get information.<ref>Weinstein and Vassiliev, \"Atomic Espionage,\" pp. 190\u2013200</ref>  Moscow sought very specific information from its intelligence cells in America, and demanded updates on the progress of the Allied project. Moscow was also greatly concerned with the procedures being used for U-235 separation, what method of detonation was being used, and what industrial equipment was being used for these techniques.<ref>Weinstein and Vassiliev (1999), \"Atomic Espionage,\" 180</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Union needed spies who had security clearance high enough to have access to classified information at the Manhattan Project and who could understand and interpret what they were stealing. Moscow also needed reliable spies who believed in the communist cause and would provide accurate information. [[Theodore Hall]] was a spy who had worked on the development of the plutonium bomb the US dropped in Japan.<ref>Holmes,Marian. \"Spies Who Spilled Atomic Bomb Secrets\". ''Smithsonian Magazine,'' 20 April 2009. http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Spies-Who-Spilled-Atomic-Bomb-Secrets.html</ref> Hall provided the specifications of the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. This information allowed the Soviet scientists a first-hand look at the set up of a successful atomic weapon built by the Manhattan Project.\n\nThe most influential of the atomic spies was [[Klaus Fuchs]]. Fuchs, a German-born British physicist, went to the United States to work on the atomic project and became one of its lead scientists. Fuchs had become a member of the [[Communist Party of Germany | Communist Party]] in 1932 while still a student in Germany. At the onset of the Third Reich in 1933, Fuchs fled to Great Britain. He eventually became one of the lead nuclear physicists in the British program. In 1943 he moved to the United States to collaborate on the Manhattan Project.<ref>Holmes, ''Spies Who Spilled'', 1\u20132</ref> Due to Fuchs's position in the atomic program, he had access to most, if not all, of the material Moscow desired. Fuchs was also able to interpret and understand the information he was stealing, which made him an invaluable resource. Fuchs provided the Soviets with detailed information on the gas-phase separation process. He also provided specifications for the payload, calculations and relationships for setting of the fission reaction, and schematics for labs producing weapons-grade isotopes.<ref>Weinstein and Vassiliev, \"Atomic Espionage\", 200\u2013210</ref>  This information helped the smaller under-manned and under-supplied Soviet group move toward the successful detonation of a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe Soviet nuclear program would have eventually been able to develop a nuclear weapon without the aid of espionage. It did not develop a basic understanding of the usefulness of an atomic weapon, the sheer resources required, and the talent until much later.{{When|date=October 2016}} Espionage helped the Soviet scientists identify which methods worked and prevented their wasting valuable resources on techniques which the development of the American bomb had proven ineffective. The speed at which the Soviet nuclear program achieved a working bomb, with so few resources, depended on the amount of information acquired through espionage. During the Cold War trials, the United States emphasized the significance of that espionage.<ref>Joint Committee Chapter 2</ref>\n\n==Notable spies==\n[[File:Greenglass bomb diagram.png|right|thumb|Sketch of an implosion-type [[nuclear weapon design]] made by [[David Greenglass]] as state's evidence, illustrating what he gave the [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|Rosenbergs]] to pass on to the Soviet Union.]]\n\n*[[Morris Cohen (spy)|Morris Cohen]]&nbsp;\u2014 an American, \"Thanks to Cohen, designers of the Soviet atomic bomb got piles of technical documentation straight from the secret laboratory in Los Alamos,\" the newspaper ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' said.

Exactly what was given, and whether everyone on the list gave it, are still matters of some scholarly dispute. In some cases, some of the arrested suspects or government witnesses had given strong testimonies or confessions which they recanted later or said were fabricated.  Their work constitutes the most publicly well-known and well-documented case of [[nuclear espionage]] in the [[history of nuclear weapons]]. At the same time, numerous nuclear scientists wanted to share the information with the world scientific community, but this proposal was firmly quashed by the United States government. \n\nConfirmation about espionage work came from the [[Venona project]], which intercepted and decrypted Soviet intelligence reports sent during and after World War II. These provided clues to the identity of several spies at Los Alamos and elsewhere, some of whom have never been identified. Some of this information was available to the government during the 1950s trials, but it was not usable in court as it was highly classified. Additionally, historians have found that records from Soviet archives, which were briefly opened to researchers after the fall of the Soviet Union, included more information about some spies.\n\n==Importance==\nBefore [[World War II]], the theoretical possibility of [[nuclear fission]] resulted in intense discussion among leading physicists world-wide. Scientists from the [[Soviet Union]] were later recognized for their contributions to the understanding of a nuclear reality, and won several Nobel Prizes. Soviet scientists such as [[Igor Kurchatov]], [[Lev Landau|L. D. Landau]], and [[Cyril Sinelnikov|Kirill Sinelnikov]] helped establish the idea of, and prove the existence of, a splittable atom. Dwarfed by the [[Manhattan Project]] conducted by the US during the war, the significance of the Soviet contributions has been rarely understood or credited outside the field of physics. According to several sources, it was understood on a theoretical level that the atom provided for extremely powerful and novel releases of energy, and could possibly be used in the future for military purposes.<ref>Schwartz, Michael. ''The Russian-A(merican) Bomb: The Role of Espionage in the Soviet Atomic Bomb Project.'' J. Undergrad. Sci. 3: 103\u2013108 (Summer 1996) http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jus/0302/schwartz.pdf</ref><!-- Isn't there another source? --> \n\nIn recorded comments, physicists lamented their inability to achieve any kind of practical application from the discoveries. They thought that creation of an atomic weapon was unattainable. According to a United States Congressional joint committee, although the scientists could conceivably have been first to generate a man-made fission reaction, they lacked the ambition, funding, engineering capability, [[leadership]], and ultimately, the capability to do so. The undertaking would be of an unimaginable scale, and the resources required to engineer for such use as a nuclear bomb, and nuclear power were deemed too great to pursue.<ref name=\"archive.org\">Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. ''Soviet Atomic Espionage.'' Chapters 2\u20133 United States Government Printing Office, Washington, 1951. https://archive.org/stream/sovietatomicespi1951unit#page/n3/mode/2up</ref>\n\nAt the urging of [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Leo Szilard]] in their [[Einstein\u2013Szil\u00e1rd letter|letter of August 2, 1939]], the [[United States]]&nbsp;\u2014 in collaboration with [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Canada]]&nbsp;\u2014 recognized the potential significance of an atomic bomb. They embarked in 1942 upon work to achieve a usable device. Estimates suggest that during the quest to create the atomic bomb, an investment of $2 billion, 86,000 tons of silver and 24,000 skilled workers drove the research and development phase of the project.<ref>Schwartz, Michael. Russian Bomb 103-08</ref>  Those skilled workers included the people to maintain and operate the machinery necessary for research. The largest Western facility had five hundred scientists working on the project, as well as a team of fifty to derive the equations for the cascade of neutrons required to drive the reaction. The fledgling equivalent Soviet program was quite different: The program consisted of fifty scientists, and two mathematicians trying to work out the equations for the particle cascade.<ref>Schwartz, Michael. Russian Bomb 103-08f</ref>  The research and development of techniques to produce sufficiently enriched uranium and plutonium were beyond the scope and efforts of the Soviet group. The knowledge of techniques and strategies that the Allied programs employed, and which Soviet espionage obtained, may have played a role in the rapid development of the Soviet bomb after the war.\n\nThe research and development of methods suitable for [[dopant|doping]] and separating the highly reactive isotopes needed to create the payload for a nuclear warhead took years, and consumed a vast amount of resources. The United States and Great Britain dedicated their best scientists to this cause and constructed three plants, each with a different isotope-extraction method.<ref>Allen Weinstein and Alexander Vassiliev, \"Atomic Espionage: from Fuchs to the Rosenburgs\" in ''The Haunted Wood,'' (New York: Random House Inc, 1999), 172\u2013222.</ref>  The Allied program decided to use gas-phase extraction to obtain the pure uranium necessary for an atomic detonation.<ref name=\"archive.org\" />  Using this method took large quantities of uranium ore and other rare materials, such as graphite, to successfully purify the U-235 isotope. The quantities required for the development were beyond the scope and purview of the Soviet program.\n\nThe Soviet Union did not have natural uranium-ore mines at the start of the nuclear arms race. A lack of materials made it very difficult for them to conduct novel research or to map out a clear pathway to achieving the fuel they needed. The Soviet scientists became frustrated with the difficulties of producing uranium fuel cheaply, and they found their industrial techniques for refinement lacking. The use of information stolen from the [[Manhattan Project]] eventually rectified the problem.<ref>Weinstein and Vassiliev (1999), \"Atomic Espionage,\" 180\u201385</ref> Without such information, the problems of the Soviet atomic team would have taken many years to correct, affecting the production of a Soviet atomic weapon significantly.\n\nSome historians believe that the Soviet Union achieved its great leaps in its atomic program by the espionage information and technical data that [[Moscow]] succeeded in obtaining from the Manhattan Project. Once the Soviets had learned of the American plans to develop an atomic bomb during the 1940s, Moscow began recruiting agents to get information.<ref>Weinstein and Vassiliev, \"Atomic Espionage,\" pp. 190\u2013200</ref>  Moscow sought very specific information from its intelligence cells in America, and demanded updates on the progress of the Allied project. Moscow was also greatly concerned with the procedures being used for U-235 separation, what method of detonation was being used, and what industrial equipment was being used for these techniques.<ref>Weinstein and Vassiliev (1999), \"Atomic Espionage,\" 180</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Union needed spies who had security clearance high enough to have access to classified information at the Manhattan Project and who could understand and interpret what they were stealing. Moscow also needed reliable spies who believed in the communist cause and would provide accurate information. [[Theodore Hall]] was a spy who had worked on the development of the plutonium bomb the US dropped in Japan.<ref>Holmes,Marian. \"Spies Who Spilled Atomic Bomb Secrets\". ''Smithsonian Magazine,'' 20 April 2009. http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Spies-Who-Spilled-Atomic-Bomb-Secrets.html</ref> Hall provided the specifications of the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. This information allowed the Soviet scientists a first-hand look at the set up of a successful atomic weapon built by the Manhattan Project.\n\nThe most influential of the atomic spies was [[Klaus Fuchs]]. Fuchs, a German-born British physicist, went to the United States to work on the atomic project and became one of its lead scientists. Fuchs had become a member of the [[Communist Party of Germany | Communist Party]] in 1932 while still a student in Germany. At the onset of the Third Reich in 1933, Fuchs fled to Great Britain. He eventually became one of the lead nuclear physicists in the British program. In 1943 he moved to the United States to collaborate on the Manhattan Project.<ref>Holmes, ''Spies Who Spilled'', 1\u20132</ref> Due to Fuchs's position in the atomic program, he had access to most, if not all, of the material Moscow desired. Fuchs was also able to interpret and understand the information he was stealing, which made him an invaluable resource. Fuchs provided the Soviets with detailed information on the gas-phase separation process. He also provided specifications for the payload, calculations and relationships for setting of the fission reaction, and schematics for labs producing weapons-grade isotopes.<ref>Weinstein and Vassiliev, \"Atomic Espionage\", 200\u2013210</ref>  This information helped the smaller under-manned and under-supplied Soviet group move toward the successful detonation of a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe Soviet nuclear program would have eventually been able to develop a nuclear weapon without the aid of espionage. It did not develop a basic understanding of the usefulness of an atomic weapon, the sheer resources required, and the talent until much later.{{When|date=October 2016}} Espionage helped the Soviet scientists identify which methods worked and prevented their wasting valuable resources on techniques which the development of the American bomb had proven ineffective. The speed at which the Soviet nuclear program achieved a working bomb, with so few resources, depended on the amount of information acquired through espionage. During the Cold War trials, the United States emphasized the significance of that espionage.<ref>Joint Committee Chapter 2</ref>\n\n==Notable spies==\n[[File:Greenglass bomb diagram.png|right|thumb|Sketch of an implosion-type [[nuclear weapon design]] made by [[David Greenglass]] as state's evidence, illustrating what he gave the [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg|Rosenbergs]] to pass on to the Soviet Union.]]\n\n*[[Morris Cohen (spy)|Morris Cohen]]&nbsp;\u2014 an American, \"Thanks to Cohen, designers of the Soviet atomic bomb got piles of technical documentation straight from the secret laboratory in Los Alamos,\" the newspaper ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' said.
