''Soul Dancing! The Essential African American Cultural Dance Book''. Reston: National Dance Association, 2010.</ref> These dances are usually centered on [[folk dance|folk]] and [[social dance]] practice, though [[performance dance]] often supplies complementary aspects to this. Placing great value on [[improvisation]], these dances are characterized by ongoing change and development. There are a number of notable African-American [[modern dance]] [[dance company|companies]] using African-American cultural dance as an inspiration, among these are the [[Whitey's Lindy Hoppers]], [[Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]], [[Dance Theatre of Harlem]], and [[Lula Washington Dance Theatre]].  Unlike European-American dance, African-American dance was not taxed in the fields of Europe where it began and has not been presented in theatrical productions by generations of kings, tzars, and states.  Instead, it lost its best dancers to the draft and started requiring taxes from establishments in the form of a federal excise tax on dance halls enacted in 1944. Dance halls continue to be taxed throughout the country while dance studios are not, and African-American dance companies statistically receive less taxpayer money than European Americans.  However, [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] have provided opportunities for African-American artists to share their work and for the public to support them. [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Misty Copeland]] are among the most well-known African-American dancers.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe [[Chesapeake Colonies|Greater Chesapeake]] area encompassing Virginia, Maryland, and much of North Carolina was the earliest and perhaps most influential location of the black-white cultural interchange that produced \"African-American\" dance.<ref name=\"Ballroom, Boogie\">Julie Malnig, ''Ballroom, Boogie, Shimmy Sham, Shake: A Social and Popular Dance Reader'', University of Illinois Press, 2009. Illustrated edition. {{ISBN|9780252075650}}.</ref>{{rp|19}} Captive Africans that were sold to white Americans by other African rival tribes; particularly from black Nigerian Arabs and darkbrown Arabs from numerous societies in several African regions began pouring into the area as [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] from the late 17th to the late 18th centuries. Given their cultural heterogeneity, including [[African dance|music and dance]], they mostly likely learned to dance together by creating fresh dance moves that are completely different from their older generation of great great grandparents;These dances looked nothing like African dances because slavery ended in 1865,so the younger 1920s generation would have known nothing about African tribes,for in those times the 1920s were seen as modern.<ref name=\"Ballroom, Boogie\"/>{{rp|21}} Something like a regional Chesapeake tradition, a thing entirely novel in European eyes, arose perhaps not long before the 18th century had become the 19th.<ref name=\"Ballroom, Boogie\"/>{{rp|21}} Within one or two generations of establishing these creolized African forms, or perhaps simultaneously, elements of European dances were added.<ref name=\"Ballroom, Boogie\"/>{{rp|22}}\n\"Competitive individuality and [probably] improvisation\" were also Choreographic Elements of Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century West African Dance\" that were continued in this region.<ref>Jurretta Jordan Heckscher, \"All the Mazes of the Dance\".

The evolution of black dance thus emphasizes black dance as a true form of release from that history and reclaiming dance as something that is theirs and not someone else's.\n\nBased on the limited pictorial record, the typical African practice of bending emphatically at the waist and hips gave way to a more upright, European like style. This may have reflected the African practice of carrying heavy loads on the head, which requires a strong, balancing spine.<ref name=\"Ballroom, Boogie\"/>{{rp|22}} Black dancing continued strong preferences of other African characteristics such as angularity and asymmetry of body positions, multiple body rhythms or polyrhythms, and a low center of gravity.<ref name=\"Ballroom, Boogie\"/>{{rp|23}}\n\n[[Jig]], [[Clogging|Clog]], and Break Down Dancing have been attributed to African Americans, although this is disputed.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=musdi&fileName=117/musdi117.db&recNum=2&itemLink=r?ammem/musdi:@field(DOCID+@lit(M1171))%231170001&linkText=1 \"Jig, clog, and breakdown dancing made easy, with sketches of noted jig dancers\"].

Performances have also been integrated into everyday dance life, from the relationship between performance and social dancing in tap dancing to the \"shows\" held at Harlem ball rooms in the 1930s.\n\n=== Social dance spaces ===\n\n* [[Juke joint]], street parties, [[rent party]] and the importance of the front porch\n* [[Ballroom]]s, cabaret clubs and church halls\n\n=== Competitive dance ===\n\n* [[Cakewalk]]s\n* the Harvest Moon Ball\n* [[Breakdance]]\n\n== Tradition ==\n\nIn most African-American dance cultures, learning to dance does not happen in formal classrooms or dance studios. Children often learn to dance as they grow up, developing not only a body awareness but also [[aesthetics]] of dance which are particular to their community. Learning to dance - learning about rhythmic movement - happens in much the same way as developing a local language 'accent' or a particular set of social values.\nChildren learn specific dance steps or 'how to dance' from their families - most often from older brothers and sisters, cousins or other older children. Because cultural dance happens in everyday spaces, children often dance with older members of the community around their homes and neighborhoods, at parties and dances, on special occasions, or whenever groups of people gather to 'have a good time'. Cultural dance traditions are therefore often cross-generational traditions, with younger dancers often 'reviving' dances from previous generations, albeit with new 'cool' variations and 'styling'. This is not to suggest that there are no social limitations on who may dance with whom and when. Dance partners (or people to dance with) are chosen by a range of social factors, including age, sex, kinship, interest and so on. The most common dance groups are often comprised by people of a similar age, background and often sex (though this is a varying factor).\n\n== Cultural expression ==\n\nLee Ellen Friedland and other authors argue that to talk about cultural dancing  without talking about music or art or drama is like talking about fish without talking about water.

Reston: National Dance Association, 2010.</ref> These dances are usually centered on [[folk dance|folk]] and [[social dance]] practice, though [[performance dance]] often supplies complementary aspects to this. Placing great value on [[improvisation]], these dances are characterized by ongoing change and development. There are a number of notable African-American [[modern dance]] [[dance company|companies]] using African-American cultural dance as an inspiration, among these are the [[Whitey's Lindy Hoppers]], [[Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]], [[Dance Theatre of Harlem]], and [[Lula Washington Dance Theatre]].  Unlike European-American dance, African-American dance was not taxed in the fields of Europe where it began and has not been presented in theatrical productions by generations of kings, tzars, and states.  Instead, it lost its best dancers to the draft and started requiring taxes from establishments in the form of a federal excise tax on dance halls enacted in 1944. Dance halls continue to be taxed throughout the country while dance studios are not, and African-American dance companies statistically receive less taxpayer money than European Americans.  However, [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] have provided opportunities for African-American artists to share their work and for the public to support them. [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Misty Copeland]] are among the most well-known African-American dancers.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe [[Chesapeake Colonies|Greater Chesapeake]] area encompassing Virginia, Maryland, and much of North Carolina was the earliest and perhaps most influential location of the black-white cultural interchange that produced \"African-American\" dance.<ref name=\"Ballroom, Boogie\">Julie Malnig, ''Ballroom, Boogie, Shimmy Sham, Shake: A Social and Popular Dance Reader'', University of Illinois Press, 2009.

Given their cultural heterogeneity, including [[African dance|music and dance]], they mostly likely learned to dance together by creating fresh dance moves that are completely different from their older generation of great great grandparents;These dances looked nothing like African dances because slavery ended in 1865,so the younger 1920s generation would have known nothing about African tribes,for in those times the 1920s were seen as modern.<ref name=\"Ballroom, Boogie\"/>{{rp|21}} Something like a regional Chesapeake tradition, a thing entirely novel in European eyes, arose perhaps not long before the 18th century had become the 19th.<ref name=\"Ballroom, Boogie\"/>{{rp|21}} Within one or two generations of establishing these creolized African forms, or perhaps simultaneously, elements of European dances were added.<ref name=\"Ballroom, Boogie\"/>{{rp|22}}\n\"Competitive individuality and [probably] improvisation\" were also Choreographic Elements of Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century West African Dance\" that were continued in this region.<ref>Jurretta Jordan Heckscher, \"All the Mazes of the Dance\".

The evolution of black dance thus emphasizes black dance as a true form of release from that history and reclaiming dance as something that is theirs and not someone else's.\n\nBased on the limited pictorial record, the typical African practice of bending emphatically at the waist and hips gave way to a more upright, European like style. This may have reflected the African practice of carrying heavy loads on the head, which requires a strong, balancing spine.<ref name=\"Ballroom, Boogie\"/>{{rp|22}} Black dancing continued strong preferences of other African characteristics such as angularity and asymmetry of body positions, multiple body rhythms or polyrhythms, and a low center of gravity.<ref name=\"Ballroom, Boogie\"/>{{rp|23}}\n\n[[Jig]], [[Clogging|Clog]], and Break Down Dancing have been attributed to African Americans, although this is disputed.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=musdi&fileName=117/musdi117.db&recNum=2&itemLink=r?ammem/musdi:@field(DOCID+@lit(M1171))%231170001&linkText=1 \"Jig, clog, and breakdown dancing made easy, with sketches of noted jig dancers\"].

Performances have also been integrated into everyday dance life, from the relationship between performance and social dancing in tap dancing to the \"shows\" held at Harlem ball rooms in the 1930s.\n\n=== Social dance spaces ===\n\n* [[Juke joint]], street parties, [[rent party]] and the importance of the front porch\n* [[Ballroom]]s, cabaret clubs and church halls\n\n=== Competitive dance ===\n\n* [[Cakewalk]]s\n* the Harvest Moon Ball\n* [[Breakdance]]\n\n== Tradition ==\n\nIn most African-American dance cultures, learning to dance does not happen in formal classrooms or dance studios. Children often learn to dance as they grow up, developing not only a body awareness but also [[aesthetics]] of dance which are particular to their community. Learning to dance - learning about rhythmic movement - happens in much the same way as developing a local language 'accent' or a particular set of social values.\nChildren learn specific dance steps or 'how to dance' from their families - most often from older brothers and sisters, cousins or other older children. Because cultural dance happens in everyday spaces, children often dance with older members of the community around their homes and neighborhoods, at parties and dances, on special occasions, or whenever groups of people gather to 'have a good time'. Cultural dance traditions are therefore often cross-generational traditions, with younger dancers often 'reviving' dances from previous generations, albeit with new 'cool' variations and 'styling'. This is not to suggest that there are no social limitations on who may dance with whom and when. Dance partners (or people to dance with) are chosen by a range of social factors, including age, sex, kinship, interest and so on. The most common dance groups are often comprised by people of a similar age, background and often sex (though this is a varying factor).\n\n== Cultural expression ==\n\nLee Ellen Friedland and other authors argue that to talk about cultural dancing  without talking about music or art or drama is like talking about fish without talking about water. Music and dance are intimately related in African-American cultural dance, not only as accompaniments, but as intertwined creative processes.<ref>Friedland, LeeEllen. \"Social Commentary in African-American Movement Performance\", in Brenda Farnell (ed.), ''Human Action Signs in Cultural Context: The Visible and the Invisible in Movement and Dance''.

The graph gets arbitrarily close to the {{mvar|y}}-axis, but [[asymptotic|does not meet it]].]]\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''logarithm''' is the [[inverse function]] to [[exponentiation]]. That means the logarithm of a given number&nbsp;{{mvar|x}} is the [[exponent]] to which another fixed number, the ''[[base (exponentiation)|base]]''&nbsp;{{mvar|b}}, must be raised, to produce that number&nbsp;{{mvar|x}}. In the simplest case, the logarithm counts the number of occurrences of the same factor in repeated multiplication; e.g., since {{math|1000 {{=}} 10\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009\u00d7\u200910 {{=}} 10<sup>3</sup>}}, the \"logarithm base {{math|10}}\" of {{math|1000}} is {{math|3}}, or {{math|log<sub>10</sub>(1000) {{=}} 3}}. The logarithm of {{mvar|x}} to ''base'' {{mvar|b}} is denoted as {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>&thinsp;(''x'')}}, or without parentheses, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>&thinsp;''x''}}, or even without the explicit base, {{math|log&thinsp;''x''}}, when no confusion is possible, or when the base does not matter such as in [[big O notation]]. \n\nMore generally, exponentiation allows any positive [[real number]] as base to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>&thinsp;(''x'')}} for any two positive real numbers&nbsp;{{mvar|b}} and&nbsp;{{mvar|x}}, where&nbsp;{{mvar|b}} is not equal to&nbsp;{{math|1}}, is always a unique real number&nbsp;{{mvar|y}}. More explicitly, the defining relation between exponentiation and logarithm is:\n\n:<math> \\log_b(x) = y \\ </math> exactly if <math>\\ b^y = x\\ </math> and <math>\\ x > 0</math> and <math>\\ b > 0</math> and <math>\\ b \\ne 1</math>.\n\nFor example, {{math|1=log<sub>2</sub>&thinsp;64 = 6}}, as {{math|1=2<sup>6</sup> = 64}}.\n\nThe logarithm base {{math|10}} (that is {{math|1=''b'' = 10}}) is called the [[common logarithm]] and has many applications in science and engineering. The [[natural logarithm]] has the [[e (mathematical constant)|number {{mvar|e}}]]&nbsp;(that is {{math|''b'' \u2248 2.718}}) as its base; its use is widespread in mathematics and [[physics]], because of its simpler [[integral]] and [[derivative]]. The [[binary logarithm]] uses base {{math|2}} (that is {{math|1=''b'' = 2}}) and is commonly used in [[computer science]].  Logarithms are examples of [[concave function]]s.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/logarithm-theory/|title=The Ultimate Guide to Logarithm \u2014 Theory & Applications|date=2016-05-08|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-24}}</ref>\n\nLogarithms were introduced by [[John Napier]] in 1614 as a means of simplifying calculations.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/johnnapierinvent00hobsiala|title=John Napier and the invention of logarithms, 1614; a lecture|last=Hobson|first=Ernest William|date=1914|publisher=Cambridge : University Press|others=University of California Libraries}}</ref> They were rapidly adopted by navigators, scientists, engineers, surveyors and others to perform high-accuracy computations more easily. Using [[Mathematical table|logarithm tables]], tedious multi-digit multiplication steps can be replaced by table look-ups and simpler addition. This is possible because of the fact\u2014important in its own right\u2014that the logarithm of a [[product (mathematics)|product]] is the [[summation|sum]] of the logarithms of the factors:\n:<math> \\log_b(xy) = \\log_b x + \\log_b y, \\,</math>\nprovided that {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are all positive and {{math|''b'' \u2260 1}}. The [[slide rule]], also based on logarithms, allows quick calculations without tables, but at lower precision.\nThe present-day notion of logarithms comes from [[Leonhard Euler]], who connected them to the [[exponential function]] in the 18th century, and who also introduced the letter {{mvar|e}} as the base of natural logarithms.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Theory of complex functions|last=Remmert, Reinhold.|date=1991|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=0387971955|location=New York|oclc=21118309}}</ref>\n\n[[Logarithmic scale]]s reduce wide-ranging quantities to tiny scopes. For example, the [[decibel]] (dB) is a [[Units of measurement|unit]] used to express [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|ratio as logarithms]], mostly for signal power and amplitude (of which [[sound pressure]] is a common example). In chemistry, [[pH]] is a logarithmic measure for the [[acid]]ity of an [[aqueous solution]]. Logarithms are commonplace in scientific [[formula]]e, and in measurements of the [[Computational complexity theory|complexity of algorithms]] and of geometric objects called [[fractal]]s. They help to describe [[frequency]] ratios of [[Interval (music)|musical intervals]], appear in formulas counting [[prime number]]s or [[Stirling's approximation|approximating]] [[factorial]]s, inform some models in [[psychophysics]], and can aid in [[forensic accounting]].\n\nIn the same way as the logarithm reverses [[exponentiation]], the [[complex logarithm]] is the [[inverse function]] of the exponential function applied to [[complex number]]s. The modular [[discrete logarithm]] is another variant; it has uses in [[public-key cryptography]].\n\n==Motivation and definition==\n\n[[Addition]], [[multiplication]], and [[exponentiation]] are three of the most fundamental arithmetic operations. Addition, the simplest of these, is undone by subtraction: when you add {{math|5}} to {{mvar|x}} to get {{math|''x'' + 5}}, to reverse this operation you need to ''subtract'' {{math|5}} from {{math|''x'' + 5}}. Multiplication, the next-simplest operation, is undone by [[division (mathematics)|division]]: if you multiply {{mvar|x}} by {{math|5}} to get {{math|5''x''}}, you then must divide {{math|5''x''}} by {{math|5}} in order to return to the original expression {{mvar|x}}. Logarithms also undo a fundamental arithmetic operation, exponentiation.  Exponentiation is when you raise a number to a certain power. For example, raising {{math|2}} to the power {{math|3}} equals {{math|8}}:\n\n: <math>2^3 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8</math>\n\nThe general case is when you raise a number {{Math|''b''}} to the power of {{Math|''y''}} to get {{Math|''x''}}:\n\n: <math>b^y=x</math>\n\nThe number {{Math|''b''}} is referred to as the base of this expression. The base is the number that is raised to a particular power\u2014in the above example, the base of the expression  <math>2^3=8</math> is {{Math|2}}. It is easy to make the base the subject of the expression: all you have to do is take the {{nowrap|{{mvar|y}}-th}} root of both sides. This gives:\n\n: <math>b=\\sqrt[y]{{x}}</math>\n\nIt is less easy to make {{Math|''y''|}} the subject of the expression.

The {{nowrap|{{mvar|n}}-th}} power of {{mvar|b}} is written {{math|''b''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, so that\n\n: <math>b^n = \\underbrace{b \\times b \\times \\cdots \\times b}_{n \\text{ factors}}</math>\n\nExponentiation may be extended to {{math|''b''<sup>''y''</sup>}}, where {{mvar|b}} is a positive number and the ''exponent'' {{mvar|y}} is any [[real number]].<ref>{{Citation|last1=Shirali| first1=Shailesh|title=A Primer on Logarithms|publisher=Universities Press|isbn=978-81-7371-414-6|year=2002|location=Hyderabad|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=0b0igbb3WaQC}}}}, esp. section 2</ref> For example, {{math|''b''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of {{mvar|b}}, that is, {{math|1/''b''}}. Raising ''{{mvar|b}}'' to the power 1/2 is the [[square root]] of ''{{mvar|b}}''.\n\nMore generally, raising ''{{mvar|b}}'' to a [[rational number|rational]] power {{math|''p''/''q''}}, where {{Mvar|p}} and {{Mvar|q}} are integers, is given by\n\n:<math>b^{p / q} = \\sqrt[q]{b^p},</math>\n\nthe {{Mvar|q}}-th root of <math>b^p\\!\\!</math>. \n\nFinally, any [[irrational number]] (a real number which is not rational) ''{{mvar|y}}'' can be approximated to arbitrary precision by rational numbers.

Archimedes had written ''[[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]'' in the third century BC, but a quadrature for the hyperbola eluded all efforts until Saint-Vincent published his results in 1647. The relation that the logarithm provides between a [[geometric progression]] in its [[argument of a function|argument]] and an [[arithmetic progression]] of values, prompted [[A. A. de Sarasa]] to make the connection of Saint-Vincent's quadrature and the tradition of logarithms in [[prosthaphaeresis]], leading to the term \"hyperbolic logarithm\", a synonym for natural logarithm. Soon the new function was appreciated by [[Christiaan Huygens]], and [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]]. The notation Log y was adopted by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] in 1675,<ref>[[Florian Cajori]] (1913) \"History of the exponential and logarithm concepts\", [[American Mathematical Monthly]] 20: 5, 35, 75, 107, 148, 173, 205.</ref> and the next year he connected it to the [[integral calculus|integral]]\n<math>\\int \\frac{dy}{y} .</math>\n\n==Logarithm tables, slide rules, and historical applications{{anchor|Antilogarithm}}==\n[[Image:Logarithms Britannica 1797.png|thumb|360px|right|The 1797 ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' explanation of logarithms]]\n\nBy simplifying difficult calculations before calculators and computers became available, logarithms contributed to the advance of science, especially [[astronomy]].

Briggs' first table contained the [[common logarithm]]s of all integers in the range 1\u20131000, with a precision of 14 digits. Subsequently, tables with increasing scope were written. These tables listed the values of {{math|log<sub>10</sub>''x''}}  for any number {{mvar|x}} in a certain range, at a certain precision. Base-10 logarithms were universally used for computation, hence the name common logarithm, since numbers that differ by factors of 10 have logarithms that differ by integers. The common logarithm of {{mvar|x}} can be separated into an [[integer part]] and a [[fractional part]], known as the characteristic and [[mantissa (logarithm)|mantissa]]. Tables of logarithms need only include the mantissa, as the characteristic can be easily determined by counting digits from the decimal point.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Spiegel | first1=Murray R. | last2=Moyer | first2=R.E. | title=Schaum's outline of college algebra | publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] | location=New York | series=Schaum's outline series | isbn=978-0-07-145227-4 | year=2006}}, p.&nbsp;264</ref> The characteristic of {{math|10 \u00b7 {{mvar|x}}}} is one plus the characteristic of {{mvar|x}}, and their mantissas are the same.

The product ''{{Mvar|cd}}'' or quotient {{Mvar|c/d}} came from looking up the antilogarithm of the sum or difference, via the same table:\n\n:<math> c d = 10^{\\ \\log_{10} c} \\, 10^{\\ \\log_{10} d} = 10^{\\ \\log_{10} c + \\ \\log_{10} d} \\,</math>\nand\n:<math>\\frac c d = c d^{-1} = 10^{\\ \\log_{10} c - \\ \\log_{10} d}. \\,</math>\n\nFor manual calculations that demand any appreciable precision, performing the lookups of the two logarithms, calculating their sum or difference, and looking up the antilogarithm is much faster than performing the multiplication by earlier methods such as [[prosthaphaeresis]], which relies on [[trigonometric identities]].\n\nCalculations of powers and [[nth root|roots]] are reduced to multiplications or divisions and look-ups by\n:<math>c^d = \\left(10^{\\ \\log_{10} c}\\right)^d =  10^{d \\ \\log_{10} c} \\,</math>\n\nand\n:<math>\\sqrt[d]{c} = c^\\frac{1}{d} = 10^{\\frac{1}{d} \\ \\log_{10} c}. \\,</math>\n\nTrigonometric calculations were facilitated by tables that contained the common logarithms of [[trigonometric function]]s.\n\n===Slide rules===\nAnother critical application was the [[slide rule]], a pair of logarithmically divided scales used for calculation. The non-sliding logarithmic scale, [[Gunter's rule]], was invented shortly after Napier's invention. [[William Oughtred]] enhanced it to create the slide rule\u2014a pair of logarithmic scales movable with respect to each other. Numbers are placed on sliding scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms. Sliding the upper scale appropriately amounts to mechanically adding logarithms, as illustrated here:\n\n[[Image:Slide rule example2 with labels.svg|center|thumb|550px|Schematic depiction of a slide rule. Starting from 2 on the lower scale, add the distance to 3 on the upper scale to reach the product 6. The slide rule works because it is marked such that the distance from 1 to {{mvar|x}} is proportional to the logarithm of {{mvar|x}}.|alt=A slide rule: two rectangles with logarithmically ticked axes, arrangement to add the distance from 1 to 2 to the distance from 1 to 3, indicating the product 6.]]\n\nFor example, adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower scale to the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale yields a product of 6, which is read off at the lower part. The slide rule was an essential calculating tool for engineers and scientists until the 1970s, because it allows, at the expense of precision, much faster computation than techniques based on tables.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\n{{Harvard citations\n |last1=Maor |year=2009 |nb=yes |loc=sections 1, 13}}</ref>\n\n==Analytic properties==\nA deeper study of logarithms requires the concept of a ''[[function (mathematics)|function]]''.

A function is ''continuous'' if it does not \"jump\", that is, if its graph can be drawn without lifting the pen.\n\nThis property can be shown to hold for the function {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = {{mvar|b}}<sup>''x''</sup>}}. Because ''{{mvar|f}}'' takes arbitrarily large and arbitrarily small positive values, any number {{math|''y'' > 0}} lies between {{math|''f''(''x''<sub>0</sub>)}} and {{math|''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>)}} for suitable {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}}. Hence, the intermediate value theorem ensures that the equation {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = {{mvar|y}}}} has a solution. Moreover, there is only one solution to this equation, because the function ''f'' is [[monotonic function|strictly increasing]] (for {{math|''b'' > 1}}), or strictly decreasing (for {{math|0 < {{mvar|b}} < 1}}).<ref name=LangIV.2>{{Harvard citations|last1=Lang|year=1997 |nb=yes|loc=section IV.2}}</ref>\n\nThe unique solution {{mvar|x}} is the logarithm of {{mvar|y}} to base {{mvar|b}}, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>''y''}}.

Conversely, given a positive number {{mvar|y}}, the formula\n:<math>b^{\\log_b y} = y</math>\nsays that first taking the logarithm and then exponentiating gives back {{mvar|y}}. Thus, the two possible ways of combining (or [[function composition|composing]]) logarithms and exponentiation give back the original number.

Their [[graph of a function|graphs]] correspond to each other upon exchanging the {{mvar|x}}- and the {{mvar|y}}-coordinates (or upon reflection at the diagonal line {{mvar|x}} = {{mvar|y}}), as shown at the right: a point {{math|1=(''t'', ''u'' = {{mvar|b}}<sup>''t''</sup>)}} on the graph of ''f'' yields a point {{math|1=(''u'', ''t'' = log<sub>''b''</sub>''u'')}} on the graph of the logarithm and vice versa. As a consequence, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>(''x'')}} [[divergent sequence|diverges to infinity]] (gets bigger than any given number) if {{mvar|x}} grows to infinity, provided that {{mvar|b}} is greater than one. In that case, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>(''x'')}}  is an [[increasing function]]. For {{math|''b'' < 1}}, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>(''x'')}} tends to minus infinity instead.

Sasaki and Kanada showed in 1982 that it was particularly fast for precisions between 400 and 1000 decimal places, while Taylor series methods were typically faster when less precision was needed. In their work {{math|ln(''x'')}} is approximated to a precision of {{math|2<sup>\u2212''p''</sup>}} (or ''p'' precise bits) by the following formula (due to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]):<ref>{{Citation |first1=T. |last1=Sasaki |first2=Y. |last2=Kanada |title=Practically fast multiple-precision evaluation of log(x) |journal=Journal of Information Processing |volume=5|issue=4 |pages=247\u201350 |year=1982 | url=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110002673332 | accessdate=30 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |first1=Timm |title=Stacs 99|last1=Ahrendt|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin, New York|series=Lecture notes in computer science|doi=10.1007/3-540-49116-3_28|volume=1564|year=1999|pages=302\u201312|isbn=978-3-540-65691-3|chapter=Fast Computations of the Exponential Function}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\ln (x) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{2  M(1,2^{2-m}/x)} - m \\ln (2).</math>\n\nHere {{math|M(''x'',''y'')}} denotes the [[arithmetic\u2013geometric mean]] of {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}. It is obtained by repeatedly calculating the average <math>(x+y)/2</math> ([[arithmetic mean]]) and <math>\\sqrt{xy}</math> ([[geometric mean]]) of {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} then let those two numbers become the next {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}. The two numbers quickly converge to a common limit which is the value of {{math|M(''x'',''y'')}}. ''m'' is chosen such that\n\n:<math>x \\,2^m > 2^{p/2}.\\, </math>\n\nto ensure the required precision. A larger ''m'' makes the {{math|M(''x'',''y'')}} calculation take more steps (the initial x and y are farther apart so it takes more steps to converge) but gives more precision. The constants {{math|pi}} and {{math|ln(2)}} can be calculated with quickly converging series.\n\n===Feynman's algorithm===\nWhile at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] working on the [[Manhattan Project]], [[Richard Feynman]] developed a bit-processing algorithm that is similar to long division and was later used in the [[Connection Machine]]. The algorithm uses the fact that every real number <math> 1 < x < 2 </math> is representable as a product of distinct factors of the form <math> 1 + 2^{-k} </math>. The algorithm sequentially builds that product <math>P</math>: if <math>P \\cdot (1 + 2^{-k}) < x</math>, then it changes <math>P</math> to <math> P \\cdot (1 + 2^{-k}) </math>. It then increase <math>k</math> by one regardless. The algorithm stops when <math>k</math> is large enough to give the desired accuracy. Because <math>\\log(x)</math> is the sum of the terms of the form <math>\\log(1 + 2^{-k})</math> corresponding to those <math>k</math> for which the factor <math>1 + 2^{-k}</math> was included in the product <math>P</math>, <math>\\log(x)</math> may be computed by simple addition, using a table of <math>\\log(1 + 2^{-k})</math> for all <math>k</math>. Any base may be used for the logarithm table.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Danny |last=Hillis |authorlink=Danny Hillis |title=Richard Feynman and The Connection Machine |journal=Physics Today |volume= 42|issue= 2|page= 78|date=January 15, 1989 |doi=10.1063/1.881196|bibcode=1989PhT....42b..78H}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:NautilusCutawayLogarithmicSpiral.jpg|thumb|A [[nautilus]] displaying a logarithmic spiral|alt=A photograph of a nautilus' shell.]]\nLogarithms have many applications inside and outside mathematics.

In [[equal temperament]], the frequency ratio depends only on the interval between two tones, not on the specific frequency, or [[pitch (music)|pitch]], of the individual tones. For example, the [[a (musical note)|note ''A'']] has a frequency of 440 [[Hertz|Hz]] and [[B\u266d (musical note)|''B-flat'']] has a frequency of 466&nbsp;Hz. The interval between ''A'' and ''B-flat'' is a [[semitone]], as is the one between ''B-flat'' and [[b (musical note)|''B'']] (frequency 493&nbsp;Hz). Accordingly, the frequency ratios agree:\n:<math>\\frac{466}{440} \\approx \\frac{493}{466} \\approx 1.059 \\approx \\sqrt[12]2.</math>\nTherefore, logarithms can be used to describe the intervals: an interval is measured in semitones by taking the {{math|base-2<sup>1/12</sup>}} logarithm of the [[frequency]] ratio, while the {{math|base-2<sup>1/1200</sup>}} logarithm of the frequency ratio expresses the interval in [[cent (music)|cents]], hundredths of a semitone. The latter is used for finer encoding, as it is needed for non-equal temperaments.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Wright|first1=David|title=Mathematics and music|location=Providence, RI|publisher=AMS Bookstore|isbn=978-0-8218-4873-9|year=2009}}, chapter 5</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n||'''Interval'''<br />(the two tones are played at the same time)\n||[[72 tone equal temperament|1/12 tone]] {{audio|1_step_in_72-et_on_C.mid|play}}\n||[[Semitone]] {{audio|help=no|Minor_second_on_C.mid|play}}\n||[[Just major third]] {{audio|help=no|Just_major_third_on_C.mid|play}}\n||[[Major third]] {{audio|help=no|Major_third_on_C.mid|play}}\n||[[Tritone]] {{audio|help=no|Tritone_on_C.mid|play}}\n||[[Octave]] {{audio|help=no|Perfect_octave_on_C.mid|play}}\n|-\n|| '''Frequency ratio''' ''r''\n|| <math>2^{\\frac 1 {72}} \\approx 1.0097</math>\n|| <math>2^{\\frac 1 {12}} \\approx 1.0595</math>\n|| <math>\\tfrac 5 4 = 1.25</math>\n|| <math>\\begin{align} 2^{\\frac 4 {12}} & = \\sqrt[3] 2 \\\\ & \\approx 1.2599 \\end{align} </math>\n|| <math>\\begin{align} 2^{\\frac 6 {12}} & = \\sqrt 2 \\\\ & \\approx 1.4142 \\end{align} </math>\n|| <math> 2^{\\frac {12} {12}} = 2 </math>\n|-\n|| '''Corresponding number of semitones'''<br /><math>\\log_{\\sqrt[12] 2}(r) = 12 \\log_2 (r)</math>\n|| <math>\\tfrac 1 6 \\,</math>\n|| <math>1 \\,</math>\n|| <math>\\approx 3.8631 \\,</math>\n|| <math>4 \\,</math>\n|| <math>6 \\,</math>\n|| <math>12 \\,</math>\n|-\n|| '''Corresponding number of cents'''<br /><math>\\log_{\\sqrt[1200] 2}(r) = 1200 \\log_2 (r)</math>\n|| <math>16 \\tfrac 2 3 \\,</math>\n|| <math>100 \\,</math>\n|| <math>\\approx 386.31 \\,</math>\n|| <math>400 \\,</math>\n|| <math>600 \\,</math>\n|| <math>1200 \\,</math>\n|}\n\n===Number theory===\n[[Natural logarithm]]s are closely linked to [[prime-counting function|counting prime numbers]] (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...), an important topic in [[number theory]].

Such a number can be visualized by a point in the [[complex plane]], as shown at the right.

In the simplest case, the logarithm counts the number of occurrences of the same factor in repeated multiplication; e.g., since {{math|1000 {{=}} 10\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u2009\u00d7\u200910 {{=}} 10<sup>3</sup>}}, the \"logarithm base {{math|10}}\" of {{math|1000}} is {{math|3}}, or {{math|log<sub>10</sub>(1000) {{=}} 3}}. The logarithm of {{mvar|x}} to ''base'' {{mvar|b}} is denoted as {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>&thinsp;(''x'')}}, or without parentheses, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>&thinsp;''x''}}, or even without the explicit base, {{math|log&thinsp;''x''}}, when no confusion is possible, or when the base does not matter such as in [[big O notation]]. \n\nMore generally, exponentiation allows any positive [[real number]] as base to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>&thinsp;(''x'')}} for any two positive real numbers&nbsp;{{mvar|b}} and&nbsp;{{mvar|x}}, where&nbsp;{{mvar|b}} is not equal to&nbsp;{{math|1}}, is always a unique real number&nbsp;{{mvar|y}}. More explicitly, the defining relation between exponentiation and logarithm is:\n\n:<math> \\log_b(x) = y \\ </math> exactly if <math>\\ b^y = x\\ </math> and <math>\\ x > 0</math> and <math>\\ b > 0</math> and <math>\\ b \\ne 1</math>.\n\nFor example, {{math|1=log<sub>2</sub>&thinsp;64 = 6}}, as {{math|1=2<sup>6</sup> = 64}}.\n\nThe logarithm base {{math|10}} (that is {{math|1=''b'' = 10}}) is called the [[common logarithm]] and has many applications in science and engineering. The [[natural logarithm]] has the [[e (mathematical constant)|number {{mvar|e}}]]&nbsp;(that is {{math|''b'' \u2248 2.718}}) as its base; its use is widespread in mathematics and [[physics]], because of its simpler [[integral]] and [[derivative]]. The [[binary logarithm]] uses base {{math|2}} (that is {{math|1=''b'' = 2}}) and is commonly used in [[computer science]].  Logarithms are examples of [[concave function]]s.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/logarithm-theory/|title=The Ultimate Guide to Logarithm \u2014 Theory & Applications|date=2016-05-08|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-24}}</ref>\n\nLogarithms were introduced by [[John Napier]] in 1614 as a means of simplifying calculations.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/johnnapierinvent00hobsiala|title=John Napier and the invention of logarithms, 1614; a lecture|last=Hobson|first=Ernest William|date=1914|publisher=Cambridge : University Press|others=University of California Libraries}}</ref> They were rapidly adopted by navigators, scientists, engineers, surveyors and others to perform high-accuracy computations more easily. Using [[Mathematical table|logarithm tables]], tedious multi-digit multiplication steps can be replaced by table look-ups and simpler addition. This is possible because of the fact\u2014important in its own right\u2014that the logarithm of a [[product (mathematics)|product]] is the [[summation|sum]] of the logarithms of the factors:\n:<math> \\log_b(xy) = \\log_b x + \\log_b y, \\,</math>\nprovided that {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are all positive and {{math|''b'' \u2260 1}}. The [[slide rule]], also based on logarithms, allows quick calculations without tables, but at lower precision.\nThe present-day notion of logarithms comes from [[Leonhard Euler]], who connected them to the [[exponential function]] in the 18th century, and who also introduced the letter {{mvar|e}} as the base of natural logarithms.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Theory of complex functions|last=Remmert, Reinhold.|date=1991|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=0387971955|location=New York|oclc=21118309}}</ref>\n\n[[Logarithmic scale]]s reduce wide-ranging quantities to tiny scopes. For example, the [[decibel]] (dB) is a [[Units of measurement|unit]] used to express [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|ratio as logarithms]], mostly for signal power and amplitude (of which [[sound pressure]] is a common example). In chemistry, [[pH]] is a logarithmic measure for the [[acid]]ity of an [[aqueous solution]]. Logarithms are commonplace in scientific [[formula]]e, and in measurements of the [[Computational complexity theory|complexity of algorithms]] and of geometric objects called [[fractal]]s. They help to describe [[frequency]] ratios of [[Interval (music)|musical intervals]], appear in formulas counting [[prime number]]s or [[Stirling's approximation|approximating]] [[factorial]]s, inform some models in [[psychophysics]], and can aid in [[forensic accounting]].\n\nIn the same way as the logarithm reverses [[exponentiation]], the [[complex logarithm]] is the [[inverse function]] of the exponential function applied to [[complex number]]s. The modular [[discrete logarithm]] is another variant; it has uses in [[public-key cryptography]].\n\n==Motivation and definition==\n\n[[Addition]], [[multiplication]], and [[exponentiation]] are three of the most fundamental arithmetic operations. Addition, the simplest of these, is undone by subtraction: when you add {{math|5}} to {{mvar|x}} to get {{math|''x'' + 5}}, to reverse this operation you need to ''subtract'' {{math|5}} from {{math|''x'' + 5}}. Multiplication, the next-simplest operation, is undone by [[division (mathematics)|division]]: if you multiply {{mvar|x}} by {{math|5}} to get {{math|5''x''}}, you then must divide {{math|5''x''}} by {{math|5}} in order to return to the original expression {{mvar|x}}. Logarithms also undo a fundamental arithmetic operation, exponentiation.  Exponentiation is when you raise a number to a certain power. For example, raising {{math|2}} to the power {{math|3}} equals {{math|8}}:\n\n: <math>2^3 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8</math>\n\nThe general case is when you raise a number {{Math|''b''}} to the power of {{Math|''y''}} to get {{Math|''x''}}:\n\n: <math>b^y=x</math>\n\nThe number {{Math|''b''}} is referred to as the base of this expression. The base is the number that is raised to a particular power\u2014in the above example, the base of the expression  <math>2^3=8</math> is {{Math|2}}. It is easy to make the base the subject of the expression: all you have to do is take the {{nowrap|{{mvar|y}}-th}} root of both sides. This gives:\n\n: <math>b=\\sqrt[y]{{x}}</math>\n\nIt is less easy to make {{Math|''y''|}} the subject of the expression. Logarithms allow us to do this:\n\n: <math>y=</math>{{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>&nbsp;''x''}}\n\nThis expression means that {{mvar|y}} is equal to the power that you need to raise {{mvar|b}} to in order to get {{mvar|x|}}. This operation undoes exponentiation because the logarithm of {{mvar|''x''}} tells you the ''exponent'' that the base has been raised to.\n\n===Exponentiation===\nThis subsection contains a short overview of the exponentiation operation, which is fundamental to understanding logarithms.\nRaising {{mvar|b}} to the {{nowrap|{{mvar|n}}-th}} power, where {{mvar|n}} is a [[natural number]], is done by multiplying {{mvar|n}} factors equal to {{mvar|b}}. The {{nowrap|{{mvar|n}}-th}} power of {{mvar|b}} is written {{math|''b''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, so that\n\n: <math>b^n = \\underbrace{b \\times b \\times \\cdots \\times b}_{n \\text{ factors}}</math>\n\nExponentiation may be extended to {{math|''b''<sup>''y''</sup>}}, where {{mvar|b}} is a positive number and the ''exponent'' {{mvar|y}} is any [[real number]].<ref>{{Citation|last1=Shirali| first1=Shailesh|title=A Primer on Logarithms|publisher=Universities Press|isbn=978-81-7371-414-6|year=2002|location=Hyderabad|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=0b0igbb3WaQC}}}}, esp. section 2</ref> For example, {{math|''b''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of {{mvar|b}}, that is, {{math|1/''b''}}. Raising ''{{mvar|b}}'' to the power 1/2 is the [[square root]] of ''{{mvar|b}}''.\n\nMore generally, raising ''{{mvar|b}}'' to a [[rational number|rational]] power {{math|''p''/''q''}}, where {{Mvar|p}} and {{Mvar|q}} are integers, is given by\n\n:<math>b^{p / q} = \\sqrt[q]{b^p},</math>\n\nthe {{Mvar|q}}-th root of <math>b^p\\!\\!</math>. \n\nFinally, any [[irrational number]] (a real number which is not rational) ''{{mvar|y}}'' can be approximated to arbitrary precision by rational numbers. This can be used to compute the ''{{mvar|y}}''-th power of ''{{mvar|b}}'': for example <math>\\sqrt 2 \\approx 1.414 ...</math> and <math>b^{\\sqrt 2}</math> is increasingly well approximated by <math>b^1, b^{1.4}, b^{1.41}, b^{1.414}, ...</math>.

Archimedes had written ''[[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]'' in the third century BC, but a quadrature for the hyperbola eluded all efforts until Saint-Vincent published his results in 1647. The relation that the logarithm provides between a [[geometric progression]] in its [[argument of a function|argument]] and an [[arithmetic progression]] of values, prompted [[A. A. de Sarasa]] to make the connection of Saint-Vincent's quadrature and the tradition of logarithms in [[prosthaphaeresis]], leading to the term \"hyperbolic logarithm\", a synonym for natural logarithm. Soon the new function was appreciated by [[Christiaan Huygens]], and [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]]. The notation Log y was adopted by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] in 1675,<ref>[[Florian Cajori]] (1913) \"History of the exponential and logarithm concepts\", [[American Mathematical Monthly]] 20: 5, 35, 75, 107, 148, 173, 205.</ref> and the next year he connected it to the [[integral calculus|integral]]\n<math>\\int \\frac{dy}{y} .</math>\n\n==Logarithm tables, slide rules, and historical applications{{anchor|Antilogarithm}}==\n[[Image:Logarithms Britannica 1797.png|thumb|360px|right|The 1797 ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' explanation of logarithms]]\n\nBy simplifying difficult calculations before calculators and computers became available, logarithms contributed to the advance of science, especially [[astronomy]].

Briggs' first table contained the [[common logarithm]]s of all integers in the range 1\u20131000, with a precision of 14 digits. Subsequently, tables with increasing scope were written. These tables listed the values of {{math|log<sub>10</sub>''x''}}  for any number {{mvar|x}} in a certain range, at a certain precision. Base-10 logarithms were universally used for computation, hence the name common logarithm, since numbers that differ by factors of 10 have logarithms that differ by integers. The common logarithm of {{mvar|x}} can be separated into an [[integer part]] and a [[fractional part]], known as the characteristic and [[mantissa (logarithm)|mantissa]]. Tables of logarithms need only include the mantissa, as the characteristic can be easily determined by counting digits from the decimal point.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Spiegel | first1=Murray R. | last2=Moyer | first2=R.E. | title=Schaum's outline of college algebra | publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] | location=New York | series=Schaum's outline series | isbn=978-0-07-145227-4 | year=2006}}, p.&nbsp;264</ref> The characteristic of {{math|10 \u00b7 {{mvar|x}}}} is one plus the characteristic of {{mvar|x}}, and their mantissas are the same.  Thus using a three-digit log table, the logarithm of 3542 is approximated by\n\n:<math>\\log_{10}3542 = \\log_{10}(1000 \\cdot 3.542) = 3 + \\log_{10}3.542 \\approx 3 + \\log_{10}3.54 \\, </math>\n\nGreater accuracy can be obtained by [[interpolation]]:\n\n:<math>\\log_{10}3542  \\approx 3 + \\log_{10}3.54 + 0.2 (\\log_{10}3.55-\\log_{10}3.54)\\, </math>\n\nThe value of {{math| 10<sup>''x''</sup>}} can be determined by reverse look up in the same table, since the logarithm is a [[monotonic function]].\n\n===Computations===\nThe product and quotient of two positive numbers {{Mvar|c}} and ''{{Mvar|d}}'' were routinely calculated as the sum and difference of their logarithms. The product ''{{Mvar|cd}}'' or quotient {{Mvar|c/d}} came from looking up the antilogarithm of the sum or difference, via the same table:\n\n:<math> c d = 10^{\\ \\log_{10} c} \\, 10^{\\ \\log_{10} d} = 10^{\\ \\log_{10} c + \\ \\log_{10} d} \\,</math>\nand\n:<math>\\frac c d = c d^{-1} = 10^{\\ \\log_{10} c - \\ \\log_{10} d}. \\,</math>\n\nFor manual calculations that demand any appreciable precision, performing the lookups of the two logarithms, calculating their sum or difference, and looking up the antilogarithm is much faster than performing the multiplication by earlier methods such as [[prosthaphaeresis]], which relies on [[trigonometric identities]].\n\nCalculations of powers and [[nth root|roots]] are reduced to multiplications or divisions and look-ups by\n:<math>c^d = \\left(10^{\\ \\log_{10} c}\\right)^d =  10^{d \\ \\log_{10} c} \\,</math>\n\nand\n:<math>\\sqrt[d]{c} = c^\\frac{1}{d} = 10^{\\frac{1}{d} \\ \\log_{10} c}. \\,</math>\n\nTrigonometric calculations were facilitated by tables that contained the common logarithms of [[trigonometric function]]s.\n\n===Slide rules===\nAnother critical application was the [[slide rule]], a pair of logarithmically divided scales used for calculation. The non-sliding logarithmic scale, [[Gunter's rule]], was invented shortly after Napier's invention. [[William Oughtred]] enhanced it to create the slide rule\u2014a pair of logarithmic scales movable with respect to each other. Numbers are placed on sliding scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms. Sliding the upper scale appropriately amounts to mechanically adding logarithms, as illustrated here:\n\n[[Image:Slide rule example2 with labels.svg|center|thumb|550px|Schematic depiction of a slide rule. Starting from 2 on the lower scale, add the distance to 3 on the upper scale to reach the product 6. The slide rule works because it is marked such that the distance from 1 to {{mvar|x}} is proportional to the logarithm of {{mvar|x}}.|alt=A slide rule: two rectangles with logarithmically ticked axes, arrangement to add the distance from 1 to 2 to the distance from 1 to 3, indicating the product 6.]]\n\nFor example, adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower scale to the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale yields a product of 6, which is read off at the lower part. The slide rule was an essential calculating tool for engineers and scientists until the 1970s, because it allows, at the expense of precision, much faster computation than techniques based on tables.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\n{{Harvard citations\n |last1=Maor |year=2009 |nb=yes |loc=sections 1, 13}}</ref>\n\n==Analytic properties==\nA deeper study of logarithms requires the concept of a ''[[function (mathematics)|function]]''.

A function is ''continuous'' if it does not \"jump\", that is, if its graph can be drawn without lifting the pen.\n\nThis property can be shown to hold for the function {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = {{mvar|b}}<sup>''x''</sup>}}. Because ''{{mvar|f}}'' takes arbitrarily large and arbitrarily small positive values, any number {{math|''y'' > 0}} lies between {{math|''f''(''x''<sub>0</sub>)}} and {{math|''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>)}} for suitable {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}}. Hence, the intermediate value theorem ensures that the equation {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = {{mvar|y}}}} has a solution. Moreover, there is only one solution to this equation, because the function ''f'' is [[monotonic function|strictly increasing]] (for {{math|''b'' > 1}}), or strictly decreasing (for {{math|0 < {{mvar|b}} < 1}}).<ref name=LangIV.2>{{Harvard citations|last1=Lang|year=1997 |nb=yes|loc=section IV.2}}</ref>\n\nThe unique solution {{mvar|x}} is the logarithm of {{mvar|y}} to base {{mvar|b}}, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>''y''}}.

Conversely, given a positive number {{mvar|y}}, the formula\n:<math>b^{\\log_b y} = y</math>\nsays that first taking the logarithm and then exponentiating gives back {{mvar|y}}. Thus, the two possible ways of combining (or [[function composition|composing]]) logarithms and exponentiation give back the original number. Therefore, the logarithm to base {{mvar|b}} is the ''[[inverse function]]'' of {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} {{mvar|b}}<sup>''x''</sup>}}.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Stewart | first1=James | title=Single Variable Calculus: Early Transcendentals | publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |location=Belmont|isbn=978-0-495-01169-9 | year=2007}}, section 1.6</ref>\n\nInverse functions are closely related to the original functions. Their [[graph of a function|graphs]] correspond to each other upon exchanging the {{mvar|x}}- and the {{mvar|y}}-coordinates (or upon reflection at the diagonal line {{mvar|x}} = {{mvar|y}}), as shown at the right: a point {{math|1=(''t'', ''u'' = {{mvar|b}}<sup>''t''</sup>)}} on the graph of ''f'' yields a point {{math|1=(''u'', ''t'' = log<sub>''b''</sub>''u'')}} on the graph of the logarithm and vice versa. As a consequence, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>(''x'')}} [[divergent sequence|diverges to infinity]] (gets bigger than any given number) if {{mvar|x}} grows to infinity, provided that {{mvar|b}} is greater than one. In that case, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>(''x'')}}  is an [[increasing function]]. For {{math|''b'' < 1}}, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>(''x'')}} tends to minus infinity instead. When {{mvar|x}} approaches zero, {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>''x''}} goes to minus infinity for {{math|''b'' > 1}} (plus infinity for {{math|''b'' < 1}}, respectively).\n\n===Derivative and antiderivative===\n[[File:Logarithm derivative.svg|right|thumb|220px|The graph of the [[natural logarithm]] (green) and its tangent at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 1.5}} (black)|alt=A graph of the logarithm function and a line touching it in one point.]]\nAnalytic properties of functions pass to their inverses.<ref name=LangIII.3 /> Thus, as {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = {{mvar|b}}<sup>''x''</sup>}} is a continuous and [[differentiable function]], so is {{math|log<sub>''b''</sub>''y''}}.

It converges more quickly than the Taylor series, especially if {{mvar|z}} is close to 1. For example, for {{math|1=''z'' = 1.5}}, the first three terms of the second series approximate {{math|ln(1.5)}} with an error of about {{val|3|e=-6}}. The quick convergence for {{mvar|z}} close to 1 can be taken advantage of in the following way: given a low-accuracy approximation {{math|''y'' \u2248 ln(''z'')}} and putting\n:<math>A = \\frac z{\\exp(y)}, \\,</math>\nthe logarithm of {{mvar|z}} is:\n:<math>\\ln (z)=y+\\ln (A). \\,</math>\nThe better the initial approximation {{mvar|y}} is, the closer {{mvar|A}} is to 1, so its logarithm can be calculated efficiently. {{mvar|A}} can be calculated using the [[exponential function|exponential series]], which converges quickly provided {{mvar|y}} is not too large. Calculating the logarithm of larger {{mvar|z}} can be reduced to smaller values of {{mvar|z}} by writing {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''a'' \u00b7 10<sup>''b''</sup>}}, so that {{math|ln(''z'') {{=}} ln(''a'') + {{mvar|b}} \u00b7 ln(10)}}.\n\nA closely related method can be used to compute the logarithm of integers.

The two numbers quickly converge to a common limit which is the value of {{math|M(''x'',''y'')}}. ''m'' is chosen such that\n\n:<math>x \\,2^m > 2^{p/2}.\\, </math>\n\nto ensure the required precision. A larger ''m'' makes the {{math|M(''x'',''y'')}} calculation take more steps (the initial x and y are farther apart so it takes more steps to converge) but gives more precision. The constants {{math|pi}} and {{math|ln(2)}} can be calculated with quickly converging series.\n\n===Feynman's algorithm===\nWhile at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] working on the [[Manhattan Project]], [[Richard Feynman]] developed a bit-processing algorithm that is similar to long division and was later used in the [[Connection Machine]]. The algorithm uses the fact that every real number <math> 1 < x < 2 </math> is representable as a product of distinct factors of the form <math> 1 + 2^{-k} </math>. The algorithm sequentially builds that product <math>P</math>: if <math>P \\cdot (1 + 2^{-k}) < x</math>, then it changes <math>P</math> to <math> P \\cdot (1 + 2^{-k}) </math>. It then increase <math>k</math> by one regardless. The algorithm stops when <math>k</math> is large enough to give the desired accuracy. Because <math>\\log(x)</math> is the sum of the terms of the form <math>\\log(1 + 2^{-k})</math> corresponding to those <math>k</math> for which the factor <math>1 + 2^{-k}</math> was included in the product <math>P</math>, <math>\\log(x)</math> may be computed by simple addition, using a table of <math>\\log(1 + 2^{-k})</math> for all <math>k</math>.

In [[equal temperament]], the frequency ratio depends only on the interval between two tones, not on the specific frequency, or [[pitch (music)|pitch]], of the individual tones. For example, the [[a (musical note)|note ''A'']] has a frequency of 440 [[Hertz|Hz]] and [[B\u266d (musical note)|''B-flat'']] has a frequency of 466&nbsp;Hz. The interval between ''A'' and ''B-flat'' is a [[semitone]], as is the one between ''B-flat'' and [[b (musical note)|''B'']] (frequency 493&nbsp;Hz). Accordingly, the frequency ratios agree:\n:<math>\\frac{466}{440} \\approx \\frac{493}{466} \\approx 1.059 \\approx \\sqrt[12]2.</math>\nTherefore, logarithms can be used to describe the intervals: an interval is measured in semitones by taking the {{math|base-2<sup>1/12</sup>}} logarithm of the [[frequency]] ratio, while the {{math|base-2<sup>1/1200</sup>}} logarithm of the frequency ratio expresses the interval in [[cent (music)|cents]], hundredths of a semitone.

Dropping the range restrictions on the argument makes the relations \"argument of {{mvar|z}}\", and consequently the \"logarithm of {{mvar|z}}\", [[multi-valued function]]s.\n\n===Inverses of other exponential functions===\nExponentiation occurs in many areas of mathematics and its inverse function is often referred to as the logarithm. For example, the [[logarithm of a matrix]] is the (multi-valued) inverse function of the [[matrix exponential]].<ref>{{Citation|last1=Higham|first1=Nicholas|author1-link=Nicholas Higham|title=Functions of Matrices.

{"title_page": "Flat-chested kitten syndrome", "text_new": "'''Flat-chested kitten syndrome (FCKS)''', is a disorder in [[cat]]s, wherein kittens develop a compression of the [[thorax]] (chest/ribcage) caused by lung collapse. This is a soft-tissue problem and is not caused by vertebral or bony malformation. However lung collapse can be a secondary symptom caused by bony deformity affecting the thorax such as pectus excavatum. In mild cases, the underside of the chest becomes flattened (hence the name of the condition); in extreme cases the entire thorax is flattened, looking as if the kitten has been stepped on. The kitten will appear to go from normal to flat in the space of about 2\u20133 hours, and will usually then stabilise. FCKS is frequently misdiagnosed as pectus excavatum due to inadequate veterinary literature or inexperience of the vet.\n\nFCKS is most frequently caused by collapsed lungs (and not as formerly believed, by a muscle spasm in the intercostal muscles). There are numerous causes for lung collapse, and therefore numerous causes for FCKS. One possible cause for flat chestedness that develops soon after birth is [[atelectasis]].\n\nCauses of [[atelectasis]] include insufficient attempts at respiration by the newborn, [[bronchial obstruction]], or absence of [[surfactant]] (a substance secreted by [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] that coats the lungs and prevents the surfaces from sticking together). Lack of surfactant reduces the surface area available for effective gas exchange causing lung collapse if severe. There can be many reasons for atelectasis in kittens, but probably the most common cause is [[Preterm birth|prematurity]]. Newborn atelectasis would not be unusual in a very large litter of kittens (such as 10), where the size of the litter may lead all the kittens to be small and mildly underdeveloped.\n\nUnlike human babies, kittens are born very immature: blind, deaf, the intestinal tract not fully developed etc., so even slight prematurity may tip them over the edge from being viable to non viable. Many FCKS kittens may have fallen just the wrong side of this boundary in their development at the time of birth. Further, if a kitten does not scream or open its lungs well enough at birth, even if it is fully mature and has sufficient surfactant, it may end up with atelectasis. Patches of atelectasis in the lungs mean that part of a lung is not operating properly. If the kitten goes to sleep and its respiratory rate drops, the patches of atelectasis can slowly expand until large areas of the lung collapse and cannot be reinflated. Good advice to any breeder therefore would be to ensure that kittens cry loudly when they are born, to make sure that the airways are clear, but also that the lungs expand as fully as possible. (This was the reason newborn babies were always held upside down immediately after birth (so that any residual fluid drains downwards) and smacked to make them cry strongly.)\n\nSome kittens suffer from congenital 'secondary' atelectasis, which presents shortly after birth. There have been no reports of kittens born flat (primary atelectasis). [[Hyaline membrane disease]] is a type of respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn in which there is formation of a [[hyaline]]-like membrane lining the terminal respiratory passages, and this may also be a (rarer) cause of FCKS. Pressure from outside the lung from fluid or air can cause atelectasis as well as obstruction of lung air passages by mucus resulting from various infections and lung diseases&nbsp;\u2013 which may explain the development of FCKS in older kittens (e.g. 10 days old) who are not strong enough to breathe through even a light mucus, or who may have inhaled milk during suckling.\n\n[[Tumors]] and inhaled objects (possible if bedding contains loose fluff) can also cause obstruction or irritation of the airway, leading to lung collapse and secondary atelectasis. In an older cat the [[intercostal muscles]] are so well developed, and the ribs rigid enough that the ribcage will not flatten if the lung collapses: in kittens the bones are much more flexible, and the tendons and muscles more flaccid, allowing movement of the thorax into abnormal positions.\n\nOther causes of lung collapse can include diaphragmatic hernia, or diaphragmatic spasm (breeders report the position of the gut and thorax as appearing to be like a 'stalled hiccup'). Diaphragmatic spasm is easily checked by pinching the [[phrenic nerve]] in the neck between the fingertips. Kittens with this type of FCKS will improve almost immediately, but may require repeated pinching to prevent the spasm from recurring.\n\n== Evidential basis and statistical analysis ==\nAlmost all reporting of FCKS is treated as anecdotal, since it comes from breeders and not from veterinary practitioners. However, in the absence of robust clinical studies breeder-reporting is the only source of information currently available. Reporting about type of FCKS is hampered by the lack of differentiation between one type and another by both breeders and vets. The data informing this article came from three sources:\n* Analysis of emails reporting cases of FCKS sent to the owner of a website giving information about the condition and methods of treatment, 1999-2019 [87 of these kittens were examined in person by the author]\n* Data gathered by the THINK project 2005-2015 who published an online questionnaire (the project is now defunct)\n* Directly solicited reports requested from 27 individual breeders of Abyssinian (4 responded) and 35 breeders of British Shorthair (2 responded) in the UK\nThe 20-year analysis was compared with the [http://www.gccfcats.org Governing Council of the Cat Fancy] in the UK (GCCF) analysis of numbers of kittens registered during the same period. The full report is to be published during 2020.<ref>Reference will be provided when publication information is available.</ref>\n\nOnly direct reports from owners (362) about their own cats or vets examining kittens (2) were considered. Kittens exhibiting any other condition (including pectus excavatum) were excluded. The overwhelming majority of reports (76%) were of single FCKS cases in a litter, with the remainder whole or part litters.\nThe data comprised 311 reports of litters of kittens in which one or more developed FCKS, for a total of 464 affected kittens.\n\nMentions of FCKS in the veterinary literature (usually no more than a single sentence) include no descriptive information and have no evidential basis, in particular the claim in Saperstein, Harris & Leipold (1976) that the condition may be hereditary, which has been repeated in subsequent literature.\n\nReports in which the sex was specified showed breakdown by sex of male 56%/female 44%. 16 breeders reported that whereas they might have expected the smallest kitten in a litter (if any) to develop FCKS, it was the largest and strongest kittens that developed flat chests, and these were often males. The condition does not appear to be sex-linked, but the preponderance of male kittens in this reporting group may be due to the fact that males tend to be larger than females and these are the kittens getting most milk or suckling hardest because they are stronger, in which case the type of FCKS in these litters may have been due to colic caused by overfeeding (see Causes, below).\n\nReports originated from 21 countries (Australia (15), Austria (11), Belgium (2), Canada (8), Denmark (3), Finland (2), France (24), Germany (13), Hungary (1), Japan (2), Netherlands (14), New Zealand (6), Norway (5), Portugal (1), Singapore (1), Slovakia (1), South Africa (5), Sweden (11), Switzerland (1), UK (100), USA (85)) and covered 39 breeds (including non-pedigree domestic shorthair, non-pedigree domestic longhair, and some \u2018unrecognised\u2019 crosses between two pedigree breeds or pedigree breeds x DSH). 10 reports did not specify breed.\n[[File:Breakdown of reports of FCKS by breed.png|thumb|Reports of kittens with FCKS by breed 1999-2018]]\n[[File:GCCF regAnalysis.png|thumb|GCCF statistics for numbers of kittens registered 1999-2018]]\nHigh numbers of reports in certain breeds has in the past been taken to imply that some breeds are more prone to the condition than others, but the data is skewed by various factors: a) the numbers of kittens bred; b) cluster-reporting in response to articles in breed club circulars or c) the work of a particular group of breeders in attempting to address a problem that they had seen in their own lines d) the culture within an individual breed of information-sharing or reporting problems. Breeders are generally not inclined to discuss health issues because of a culture of blame and gossip, having a dramatic effect on information-sharing. No \u2018cluster\u2019 triggers have been identified for the relatively high number of reports in the Maine Coon or Bengal breeds, however statistics on the registration of kittens provided by the [http://www.gccfcats.org GCCF] show that Bengal, Burmese and Maine Coon are consistently in the top nine breeds by number of kittens registered. The breeds showing highest numbers of kittens registered therefore broadly correlate demographically to reports of FCKS. More significant is perhaps the low number of reported cases in the British Shorthair (especially when compared with the Manx), but it is possible this is attributable to the culture of breeders in that group.\n\nMortality: of 195 cases where the outcome was notified, 88 died, or were euthanised due to distress; 107 recovered and survived beyond 3 months of age. Those that recovered fully did not appear to suffer any long-term effects, although reporting is patchy.\n\n== Onset and diagnosis ==\nFCKS develops usually in kittens around three days of age, and sometimes affects whole litters, sometimes only individuals or part of a litter. Kittens can go flat any time during early maturation, some flattening as late as 10 days of age or (in very rare cases) later. It is possible that the later-developing cases are due to [[Respiratory tract infection]] or [[pneumonia]]. Until 2010 FCKS was believed to be caused by a spasm in the [[intercostal muscle|intercostal]] muscles, but re-examination of old post-mortem data (i.e. that kittens remain flat even when they are dead and therefore cannot maintain a muscular spasm) and new data has led to the conclusion that flattening is caused by failure of the [[lung]]s to inflate normally or, when it occurs in older kittens, by lung collapse. This cause is now cited by the veterinary community (Sturgess 2016) but without any source acknowledgement.\n\nGross physical symptoms include flattening of the underside of the thorax in moderate cases (a ridge can usually be felt along the sides of the ribcage, running parallel to the spine); complete flattening of the upper body in extreme cases (the kitten looks as if it has been stepped on); moderate to extreme effort and/or gasping during breathing; the gut is drawn upwards during the in-breath. Breathing is not usually rapid (as in pneumonia or pyrexia) but at a normal rate when compared with unaffected kittens. The position of the thorax and activity of the abdomen is not unlike that seen during normal hiccups, but the sudden spasm in hiccups is slowed down or halted in FCKS: where a hiccup releases, returning the body to a normal position, FCKS breathing does not release. There may be involvement with digestive difficulty in FCKS kittens (see Colic, below).\n[[File:FCKSnormalThorax.png|border|center|Diagram of normal cat thorax]]\n[[File:FCKSdeformedThorax.png|border|center|Diagram of thoracic deformities of flat chested kitten]]\n\n[[File:FCKSbanana.jpg|thumb|Banana used to demonstrate FCKS shape]]Determining whether a kitten has FCKS or not can be difficult with only text descriptions: a mild case of FCKS causes the thorax to feel similar to the shape of a banana when held curve downward. The ribcage is not fixed in position, and the most noticeable effect in mild cases is the ridge along the side of the ribcage.\n\nThe condition causes weight-gain to halt, respiratory distress, inability to feed normally and, in a significant proportion of cases, death. However, since a significant percentage of kittens survive the condition immediate euthanasia is not indicated, and supportive treatments can be employed to increase the likelihood of survival (see Treatment, below).\n\nThe condition is often misdiagnosed as ''[[Pectus excavatum]]'',<ref>Kit Sturgess et al: An investigation of Taurine levels as a possible cause of FCKS. Burmese Cat Club Newsletter 1980, [http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/BCC/ downloadable pdf files accessible from this page]</ref> with which it has no direct connection, although FCKS kittens may also have PE. Although the condition is believed to be more prevalent in the Burmese breed it is found in every breed of cat, including non-pedigree domestic cats, and the apparent prevalence in the [[Burmese (cat)|Burmese]] is most likely due to better communication between breeders and reporting of the condition, as well as the naturally more barrel-shaped chest of this particular genotype.<ref>Edinburgh FAB resident, Royal Dick Veterinary Hospital: Report in ''FAB Journal'' (1993), vol. 31 (1) 71-72</ref> Since early reporting of the condition identified the Burmese as susceptible the [[Bengal (cat)|Bengal]] breed, with a similar physiology, has emerged, and shows a similarly large number of FCKS kittens, however this may be due to specific interest in the condition among those working with the breeds. It is reported in all breeds and in domestic non-pedigree cats, both those kept as pets and those living as 'barn cats'. An article in a Swedish cat club newsletter about FCKS led to a spike in reporting of the condition in Ragdolls in Sweden.\n{|style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n| [[File:MauFCK.jpg|thumb|upright|Egyptian Mau kitten with FCKS]]\n|[[File:RexFCK.jpg|thumb|center|Rex kitten with FCKS and Kyphosis - note narrowing of thorax around the shoulders]]\n| [[File:Flat kitten b.png|thumb|center|Oriental kitten with moderate to extreme FCKS. Pectus Excavatum is not present. The kitten was wrapped in a 'corset' for about 2 weeks. It is now a healthy adult.]]\n|}\n\nThe syndrome is life-threatening in a significant number of cases (possibly around 40%) mainly due to a lack of understanding of the underlying cause of the condition, failure to treat colic (leading to slow starvation) and insufficient sources of information in veterinary literature.\n\n== Causes ==\n\n=== Genetic/Heredity ===\nThere is no statistical evidence to suggest that FCKS may be due to genetic factors: certain bloodlines ''seem'' to produce a preponderance of kittens with the condition, but this may be due to enhanced reporting within the breed. The literature citing heredity as a cause (Saperstein, Harris & Leipold (1976)) does not provide any evidential support and the information is repeated in later literature citing that source as authority. The majority of cases are of single kittens, with low but significant numbers of whole or part litters reported. Numerous breeders experience periods in which FCKS seems to occur over a number of matings, but then stops, suggesting an environmental cause. Incidences of the condition have been reported in many litters that were repeat matings of previously healthy litters; matings repeated after the incidence of FCKS do not produce flat kittens any more frequently than non-repeat matings; recovered FCKS that have been bred from have likewise not produced offspring that suffered from the condition any more frequently than normal cats, but numbers in this category are obviously low. It is possible that some lines in which the queens provide excessive milk may lead to colic-related FCKS in the kittens, leading to the supposition of heredity. Although after experiencing cases of FCKS most breeders do not repeat matings. In 59 cases of repeat matings 52 litters did '''not''' result in FCKS again while 7 did.\n\n=== Developmental ===\nIt is possible that the lung collapse in neo-nates (i.e. around 3 days of age) could be due to a lack of [[surfactant]] -  the coating of the inside of the lung that prevents the inner surfaces of the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] from sticking together. (Causes of surfactant deficiency are not discussed here, but the role of surfactant is discussed in a number of articles in the ''British Journal of Anaesthesia'' vol. 65, 1990.<ref>particularly B A Hills: The role of lung surfactant, ''British Journal of Anaesthesia'' 1990, 65, 13-29</ref>). Kittens are born immature in many ways, and full inflation of the lungs does not happen immediately, but takes place gradually over a period of several days after birth. Although a kitten may seem active and thriving, its lungs will not be fully inflated until approx. day 3 after birth. Thus if inflation fails to happen correctly the [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]] in the chest cavity will cause the ribcage&nbsp;\u2013 which is extremely flexible&nbsp;\u2013 to collapse inward, dragged in by the lungs, and '''not''' collapsing due to muscular cramping, and compressing the lungs.\n\n=== Infection ===\nNeo-natal and Later lung collapse may be due to lung infection, or possibly to a malfunction in the [[epiglottis]], causing the in-breath to draw air into the digestive tract rather than the lungs. A short term malfunction of this sort may be perpetuated by the resulting colic creating a feedback loop that interrupts the correct breathing process.\n\nAutopsy and analysis of [[Aspiration pneumonia|lung aspirate]] in a group of flat-chested kittens bred by a US Vet showed the presence of [[Cat flu|Herpes virus]].\n\n=== Diaphragmatic spasm ===\n[[File:Phrenic002.jpg|thumb|<center>Position of the Phrenic Nerve (diagram)</center>]]\nSpasm in the diaphragm leads to the muscle 'locking up' so that all breathing effort falls to the intercostal muscles. The resulting loss of movement causes the lungs to deflate gradually. This is easily diagnosed and treated (see Treatment below) by short-term interruption of the [[Phrenic nerve]].\n\n=== Colic ===\nA kitten that has difficulty in breathing is very likely also to suffer from [[colic]] (which can cause weight loss in the early development of a normal kitten), and a very small daily (or twice daily) dose of [[Liquid paraffin (medicinal)|liquid paraffin]] (one or two drops placed on the tongue of the kitten, or 0.1 ml) should help to alleviate this problem. FCKS kittens who do not maintain weight are usually among the group which die, but many of them may simply be unable to feed properly due to colic, becoming increasingly weak and lethargic, and fading due to malnutrition as much as to the thoracic problems.\n\nColic has many causes, but in a kitten with respiratory difficulty it is possible that a malfunction during the breathing process leads the kitten to swallow air instead of taking it into its lungs. The GI tract fills with air while the lungs do not receive a proper air supply, preventing them from inflating fully. Pressure from the stomach exacerbates the condition. Treating for colic with liquid paraffin seems to shorten recovery time from 4\u201310 weeks to a matter of days.\n\n== Treatment ==\n[[File:Position of phrenic nerve in cat.jpg|thumb|<center>Position of Phrenic nerve in a sleeping kitten. The nerve bifurcates and runs down both sides of the neck.</center>]]\nTreatment is difficult to define given the number of different causes and the wealth of anecdotal information collected by and from cat breeders. Treatments have hitherto been based on the assumption that FCKS is caused by a muscular [[spasm]], and their effectiveness is impossible to assess because some kittens will recover spontaneously without intervention.\n\nDiaphragmatic spasm is easily tested for and treated by short term interruption of the [[Phrenic nerve]]. The nerve runs down the outside of the neck where the neck joins to the shoulder, within a bundle of muscles and tendons at this junction. The cluster can be pinched gently and held for a few seconds each time. Kittens with spasmodic FCKS will show almost immediate improvement, but the treatment may need to be repeated several times over a few days as the spasm may have a tendency to recur, particularly after suckling. It is sometimes evident that the spasm only affects one side of the diaphragm, as interruption of the nerve is only necessary or effective on one side.\n\nContinuous positive air pressure ([[Continuous positive airway pressure|CPAP]]) is used in human babies with lung collapse, but this is impossible with kittens. It is possible that the success of some breeders in curing kittens by splinting the body, thus putting pressure on the ribcage, was successful as it has created the effect of positive air pressure, thus gradually re-inflating the lungs by pulling them open rather than pushing them open as is the case with CPAP (see below).\n\n=== Drugs ===\nThe use of [[steroids]] ([[Dexamethasone]]) coupled with an antibiotic ([[Amoxicillin]]) will support the kitten in a number of ways, the steroid enhancing maturation and the antibiotic addressing the possibility of underlying infection and compensating for the immuno-depressant properties of the steroid. The steroid will also encourage the kitten to feed more energetically, keeping its weight up. However the primary supportive mechanism must be nutritional. Kittens who are only supported with feeding and do not receive drugs seem to have a similar prognosis to those receiving drugs. Drug treatment cannot be used to replace nutritional support (i.e. supplementary feeding), A very small number of breeders having read the report by Sturgess et al (which was inconclusive) believe that Taurine plays a part in the condition. These breeders give the queen large doses of Taurine (1000&nbsp;mg) daily until the kittens recover&nbsp;\u2013 apparently within a few days. Long-term use of high doses of Taurine should be monitored by a veterinarian.\n\nKittens have a much higher metabolism than adults, so drugs cannot simply be calibrated based on adult protocols but adjusted for weight. Antibiotics administered 2x daily in adults need to be given 3x daily in kittens, and doses given at 24-hour intervals need to be given at 18- to 20-hour intervals. In addition, because the liver does not metabolise drugs as efficiently as in adults, a higher dose relative to body weight may need to be given. Little information is available in veterinary literature about drug dosing in neonates; almost all treatment protocols are based on adult animals. The neonatal human literature is here used as a guide. See [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4268272/ Lawrence C. Ku and P. Brian Smith, 'Dosing in neonates: Special considerations in physiology and trail design'] and multiple other sources of information. Observation of drug responses in neonatal kittens indicates increased frequency is essential.\n\n=== Splinting and physical therapy ===\nSplinting the kitten in a specially-constructed corset made from a rigid material such as a toilet roll, section of plastic bottle or high-density foam encourages the ribcage to a more normal position, and reported mortality seemed to decline when this practice was introduced.<ref>http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/health/FCKS/TreatingFCKS/ Information regarding splinting of FCKS kittens]</ref> This may be because encouraging the chest to a more correct position helps the lungs to re-inflate. However a large proportion of kittens cannot tolerate a splint, and the distress it causes is extremely counterproductive. It can also be dangerous in cases where pressure on the sides causes the sternum to move inwards rather than outwards, and should only be undertaken with veterinary support and advice. Some kittens recover without intervention, so it is not known whether the various treatments based on encouraging the thorax to return to a normal shape contributed to recovery.<ref>Although corsets can be improvised easily from e.g. plastic drinks bottles etc., one breeder has marketed a 'corset' design that she found successful with her kittens www.fck-flat-korsett.de</ref>\n\nSome breeders have found that applying manual pressure to the sides of the ribcage can help, as the chest rounds out with encouragement (gentle pressure timed to coincide with the natural movement of the thorax in breathing), but usually the chest goes flat again as soon as massage is discontinued. It may however help in encouraging the lungs to inflate a little more with each breath, but should not be used if it causes distress to the kitten. Many breeders report that affected kittens seem to enjoy massage. Encouraging a kitten to lie on its side can be helpful, and draping another kitten (or the mother's arm) over it while it is sleeping on its side places a gentle continuous pressure on the ribcage which may also be helpful. If the kitten is uncomfortable it will move away. (It is important to ensure that pressure is not placed on the kitten if it is lying flat on its chest.)\n\nOver-handling FCKS kittens can lead to unnecessary weight loss and [[Fatigue (medical)|lethargy]], so the use of massage, waking the kitten for extra feeds from the mother etc. should be checked against gains and losses in weight. Some vets believe that encouraging the kitten to cry and also to have to move more to reach its mother may be helpful. There is no data from breeders supporting this theory.\n\n== Survival and long-term prognosis ==\nIt is difficult to determine whether a kitten that goes flat will survive or not. A good indicator is the weight of the kitten: those that continue to gain weight generally have a better chance of survival. Supplement feeding is therefore recommended in all cases, together with vitamin supplements,<ref>[http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/health/FCKS/TreatingFCKS/ Information about kitten milk and other supplements further down the page]</ref> although many of these kittens will not accept hand feeding. Liquid Paraffin to alleviate colic seems to be significant in assisting normal feeding and weight-gain.\n\nAnother indicator to the severity of the case is the use of the stomach when breathing: normal kittens use only the ribcage, a flat-chested kitten may manage to breathe only using the ribcage, or may suck the gut upwards with every breath&nbsp;\u2013 if the latter is the case then the likelihood of survival seems to be lower, though still not sufficient to warrant immediate [[euthanasia]]. If the condition is stable (i.e. the flatness does not increase over time) or improving, the kitten is more likely to survive. If the condition worsens over several days, survival is less likely.\n\nKittens with FCKS may die (or have to be euthanased) very soon after onset. There are two points at which breeders report kittens that were otherwise doing well deteriorating and dying: at 10 days of age and at 3 weeks. Generally if the kitten is still flat, but survives the 3-week developmental stage, its prognosis is good. Many will have returned to a normal shape by this time. Those retaining some degree of flatness often grow out of the condition at any point in the ensuing 6 months, and the vast majority of survivors appear to lead normal lives with no side-effects, either physical or immunological.\n\nFCKS kittens that survive but who have not been given any drug treatment or support other than supplementary feeding, generally recover over a period of 4\u201310 weeks, and are usually normal by 12 weeks of age, though some take as long as 6 months to normalise. In the very small number of kittens reported so far treated with steroids, antibiotics and liquid paraffin (to address colic) recovery is usually seen within a matter of days. Given the number of different types of FCKS these kittens (all with the minor form of the condition) may not be representative of all cases. More data is required for statistical analysis.\n\nA small proportion of severe FCKS kittens are left with long-term respiratory problems, [[kyphosis]], and in some cases cardiac issues caused by the compression of the thorax during the early developmental stages (particularly where the condition has been coupled with Pectus Excavatum). Cardiac issues are generally audible on physical examination; further indications include the kitten becoming breathless after play, less active than siblings, and failure to grow and develop normally.\n\n== Breeding with FCKS ==\nCrucial in the decision to breed would be the primary cause of FCKS in the litter, which may or may not be genetic (see Heredity above). Some recovered FCKS adults have produced FCKS offspring in their turn, and some queens consistently produce flat kittens, so breeding from those lines is therefore inadvisable. However, repeat matings in which FCKS has appeared does not result in further FCKS kittens any more often than non-repeat matings. Queens and studs who consistently throw complete litters of kittens with the condition are generally neutered, but isolated instances of single flat kittens in an otherwise healthy litter seem to be unlikely to have a genetic component and neutering of parents of such kittens is not usually necessary in pedigree breeding, particularly where doing so may have detrimental effects on the gene pool.\n\nIf the cause of flattening is colic related to over-production of milk then this would not be cause for neutering. The only way to determine if the cause is digestive would be if the condition was alleviated by pinching the phrenic nerve and/or use of liquid paraffin to relieve colic, resulting in improvement in the condition.\n\nLine-breeding or inbreeding is highly inadvisable in any situation, and particularly so in lines where FCKS has appeared, given the possibility of inheritcance of any underlying condition or breeding factor that may cause kittens to develop FCKS.\n\n== Other conditions ==\nKittens with FCKS sometimes also show bony deformities such as [[Pectus Excavatum]] or [[Kyphosis]] (characterised in kittens by a dip in the spine just behind the shoulder blades). Although a kitten may be born with these deformities, extreme forms of FCKS may cause Kyphosis to develop in an otherwise normal kitten, as the kitten grows with the spine held in an abnormal position due to the flattened ribcage. When there are bony deformities in the upper body, or other problems present, these may contribute to malfunctioning in soft-tissue organs such as the respiratory and digestive systems.\n\n== Flat chestedness in other animals ==\nFlat chest occurs in piglets and puppies, may be known in cattle (anecdotal information only), and is also recorded in humans, though possibly in humans this is not the same type of condition and may be a bone deformity.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.vetstream.com/treat/felis/diseases/flat-chested-kitten-and-pectus-excavatum Vetstream article on FCKS in journal ''Felis'' ISSN 2398-2950]\n* [http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/health/page58/index.html Flat-Chested Kitten Syndrome]\n* [http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/FCKSVeterinary.pdf Veterinary information about FCKS written by Dr Kit Sturgess MA VetMB PhD CertVR DSAM CertVC MRCVS] -- warning, out of date.\n* [http://theses.vet-alfort.fr/telecharger.php?id=1840/  Marine Minnaert: ''\u00c9tude r\u00e9trospective de la cage thoracique plate chez le chat : caract\u00e9ristiques \u00e9pid\u00e9miologiques et cliniques, pronostic et aspects g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques'', PhD thesis (2014) pdf]\n* [https://icatcare.org/advice/cat-health/flat-chested-kitten-syndrome/ International Cat Care website; based on Sturgess]\n[[Category:Cat diseases]]\n[[Category:Respiratory and cardiovascular disorders specific to the perinatal period]]\n*[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9423237?dopt=abstract/ Sturgess C P, Waters L, Gruffydd-Jones T J et al (1997) Investigation of the association between whole blood and tissue taurine levels and the development of thoracic deformities in neonatal Burmese kittens.

This is a soft-tissue problem and is not caused by vertebral or bony malformation. However lung collapse can be a secondary symptom caused by bony deformity affecting the thorax such as pectus excavatum. In mild cases, the underside of the chest becomes flattened (hence the name of the condition); in extreme cases the entire thorax is flattened, looking as if the kitten has been stepped on. The kitten will appear to go from normal to flat in the space of about 2\u20133 hours, and will usually then stabilise. FCKS is frequently misdiagnosed as pectus excavatum due to inadequate veterinary literature or inexperience of the vet.\n\nFCKS is most frequently caused by collapsed lungs (and not as formerly believed, by a muscle spasm in the intercostal muscles). There are numerous causes for lung collapse, and therefore numerous causes for FCKS. One possible cause for flat chestedness that develops soon after birth is [[atelectasis]].\n\nCauses of [[atelectasis]] include insufficient attempts at respiration by the newborn, [[bronchial obstruction]], or absence of [[surfactant]] (a substance secreted by [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] that coats the lungs and prevents the surfaces from sticking together). Lack of surfactant reduces the surface area available for effective gas exchange causing lung collapse if severe. There can be many reasons for atelectasis in kittens, but probably the most common cause is [[Preterm birth|prematurity]]. Newborn atelectasis would not be unusual in a very large litter of kittens (such as 10), where the size of the litter may lead all the kittens to be small and mildly underdeveloped.\n\nUnlike human babies, kittens are born very immature: blind, deaf, the intestinal tract not fully developed etc., so even slight prematurity may tip them over the edge from being viable to non viable. Many FCKS kittens may have fallen just the wrong side of this boundary in their development at the time of birth. Further, if a kitten does not scream or open its lungs well enough at birth, even if it is fully mature and has sufficient surfactant, it may end up with atelectasis. Patches of atelectasis in the lungs mean that part of a lung is not operating properly. If the kitten goes to sleep and its respiratory rate drops, the patches of atelectasis can slowly expand until large areas of the lung collapse and cannot be reinflated. Good advice to any breeder therefore would be to ensure that kittens cry loudly when they are born, to make sure that the airways are clear, but also that the lungs expand as fully as possible. (This was the reason newborn babies were always held upside down immediately after birth (so that any residual fluid drains downwards) and smacked to make them cry strongly.)\n\nSome kittens suffer from congenital 'secondary' atelectasis, which presents shortly after birth. There have been no reports of kittens born flat (primary atelectasis). [[Hyaline membrane disease]] is a type of respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn in which there is formation of a [[hyaline]]-like membrane lining the terminal respiratory passages, and this may also be a (rarer) cause of FCKS. Pressure from outside the lung from fluid or air can cause atelectasis as well as obstruction of lung air passages by mucus resulting from various infections and lung diseases&nbsp;\u2013 which may explain the development of FCKS in older kittens (e.g. 10 days old) who are not strong enough to breathe through even a light mucus, or who may have inhaled milk during suckling.\n\n[[Tumors]] and inhaled objects (possible if bedding contains loose fluff) can also cause obstruction or irritation of the airway, leading to lung collapse and secondary atelectasis. In an older cat the [[intercostal muscles]] are so well developed, and the ribs rigid enough that the ribcage will not flatten if the lung collapses: in kittens the bones are much more flexible, and the tendons and muscles more flaccid, allowing movement of the thorax into abnormal positions.\n\nOther causes of lung collapse can include diaphragmatic hernia, or diaphragmatic spasm (breeders report the position of the gut and thorax as appearing to be like a 'stalled hiccup'). Diaphragmatic spasm is easily checked by pinching the [[phrenic nerve]] in the neck between the fingertips. Kittens with this type of FCKS will improve almost immediately, but may require repeated pinching to prevent the spasm from recurring.\n\n== Evidential basis and statistical analysis ==\nAlmost all reporting of FCKS is treated as anecdotal, since it comes from breeders and not from veterinary practitioners. However, in the absence of robust clinical studies breeder-reporting is the only source of information currently available. Reporting about type of FCKS is hampered by the lack of differentiation between one type and another by both breeders and vets. The data informing this article came from three sources:\n* Analysis of emails reporting cases of FCKS sent to the owner of a website giving information about the condition and methods of treatment, 1999-2019 [87 of these kittens were examined in person by the author]\n* Data gathered by the THINK project 2005-2015 who published an online questionnaire (the project is now defunct)\n* Directly solicited reports requested from 27 individual breeders of Abyssinian (4 responded) and 35 breeders of British Shorthair (2 responded) in the UK\nThe 20-year analysis was compared with the [http://www.gccfcats.org Governing Council of the Cat Fancy] in the UK (GCCF) analysis of numbers of kittens registered during the same period. The full report is to be published during 2020.<ref>Reference will be provided when publication information is available.</ref>\n\nOnly direct reports from owners (362) about their own cats or vets examining kittens (2) were considered. Kittens exhibiting any other condition (including pectus excavatum) were excluded. The overwhelming majority of reports (76%) were of single FCKS cases in a litter, with the remainder whole or part litters.\nThe data comprised 311 reports of litters of kittens in which one or more developed FCKS, for a total of 464 affected kittens.\n\nMentions of FCKS in the veterinary literature (usually no more than a single sentence) include no descriptive information and have no evidential basis, in particular the claim in Saperstein, Harris & Leipold (1976) that the condition may be hereditary, which has been repeated in subsequent literature.\n\nReports in which the sex was specified showed breakdown by sex of male 56%/female 44%. 16 breeders reported that whereas they might have expected the smallest kitten in a litter (if any) to develop FCKS, it was the largest and strongest kittens that developed flat chests, and these were often males. The condition does not appear to be sex-linked, but the preponderance of male kittens in this reporting group may be due to the fact that males tend to be larger than females and these are the kittens getting most milk or suckling hardest because they are stronger, in which case the type of FCKS in these litters may have been due to colic caused by overfeeding (see Causes, below).\n\nReports originated from 21 countries (Australia (15), Austria (11), Belgium (2), Canada (8), Denmark (3), Finland (2), France (24), Germany (13), Hungary (1), Japan (2), Netherlands (14), New Zealand (6), Norway (5), Portugal (1), Singapore (1), Slovakia (1), South Africa (5), Sweden (11), Switzerland (1), UK (100), USA (85)) and covered 39 breeds (including non-pedigree domestic shorthair, non-pedigree domestic longhair, and some \u2018unrecognised\u2019 crosses between two pedigree breeds or pedigree breeds x DSH). 10 reports did not specify breed.\n[[File:Breakdown of reports of FCKS by breed.png|thumb]]\n[[File:GCCF regAnalysis.png|thumb|GCCF statistics for numbers of kittens registered 1999-2018]]\nHigh numbers of reports in certain breeds has in the past been taken to imply that some breeds are more prone to the condition than others, but the data is skewed by various factors: a) the numbers of kittens bred; b) cluster-reporting in response to articles in breed club circulars or c) the work of a particular group of breeders in attempting to address a problem that they had seen in their own lines d) the culture within an individual breed of information-sharing or reporting problems. Breeders are generally not inclined to discuss health issues because of a culture of blame and gossip, having a dramatic effect on information-sharing. No \u2018cluster\u2019 triggers have been identified for the relatively high number of reports in the Maine Coon or Bengal breeds, however statistics on the registration of kittens provided by the [http://www.gccfcats.org GCCF] show that Bengal, Burmese and Maine Coon are consistently in the top nine breeds by number of kittens registered. The breeds showing highest numbers of kittens registered therefore broadly correlate demographically to reports of FCKS. More significant is perhaps the low number of reported cases in the British Shorthair (especially when compared with the Manx), but it is possible this is attributable to the culture of breeders in that group.\n\nMortality: of 195 cases where the outcome was notified, 88 died, or were euthanised due to distress; 107 recovered and survived beyond 3 months of age. Those that recovered fully did not appear to suffer any long-term effects, although reporting is patchy.\n\n== Onset and diagnosis ==\nFCKS develops usually in kittens around three days of age, and sometimes affects whole litters, sometimes only individuals or part of a litter. Kittens can go flat any time during early maturation, some flattening as late as 10 days of age or (in very rare cases) later. It is possible that the later-developing cases are due to [[Respiratory tract infection]] or [[pneumonia]]. Until 2010 FCKS was believed to be caused by a spasm in the [[intercostal muscle|intercostal]] muscles, but re-examination of old post-mortem data (i.e. that kittens remain flat even when they are dead and therefore cannot maintain a muscular spasm) and new data has led to the conclusion that flattening is caused by failure of the [[lung]]s to inflate normally or, when it occurs in older kittens, by lung collapse. This cause is now cited by the veterinary community (Sturgess 2016) but without any source acknowledgement.\n\nGross physical symptoms include flattening of the underside of the thorax in moderate cases (a ridge can usually be felt along the sides of the ribcage, running parallel to the spine); complete flattening of the upper body in extreme cases (the kitten looks as if it has been stepped on); moderate to extreme effort and/or gasping during breathing; the gut is drawn upwards during the in-breath. Breathing is not usually rapid (as in pneumonia or pyrexia) but at a normal rate when compared with unaffected kittens. The position of the thorax and activity of the abdomen is not unlike that seen during normal hiccups, but the sudden spasm in hiccups is slowed down or halted in FCKS: where a hiccup releases, returning the body to a normal position, FCKS breathing does not release. There may be involvement with digestive difficulty in FCKS kittens (see Colic, below).\n[[File:FCKSnormalThorax.png|border|center|Diagram of normal cat thorax]]\n[[File:FCKSdeformedThorax.png|border|center|Diagram of thoracic deformities of flat chested kitten]]\n\n[[File:FCKSbanana.jpg|thumb|Banana used to demonstrate FCKS shape]]Determining whether a kitten has FCKS or not can be difficult with only text descriptions: a mild case of FCKS causes the thorax to feel similar to the shape of a banana when held curve downward. The ribcage is not fixed in position, and the most noticeable effect in mild cases is the ridge along the side of the ribcage.\n\nThe condition causes weight-gain to halt, respiratory distress, inability to feed normally and, in a significant proportion of cases, death. However, since a significant percentage of kittens survive the condition immediate euthanasia is not indicated, and supportive treatments can be employed to increase the likelihood of survival (see Treatment, below).\n\nThe condition is often misdiagnosed as ''[[Pectus excavatum]]'',<ref>Kit Sturgess et al: An investigation of Taurine levels as a possible cause of FCKS. Burmese Cat Club Newsletter 1980, [http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/BCC/ downloadable pdf files accessible from this page]</ref> with which it has no direct connection, although FCKS kittens may also have PE. Although the condition is believed to be more prevalent in the Burmese breed it is found in every breed of cat, including non-pedigree domestic cats, and the apparent prevalence in the [[Burmese (cat)|Burmese]] is most likely due to better communication between breeders and reporting of the condition, as well as the naturally more barrel-shaped chest of this particular genotype.<ref>Edinburgh FAB resident, Royal Dick Veterinary Hospital: Report in ''FAB Journal'' (1993), vol. 31 (1) 71-72</ref> Since early reporting of the condition identified the Burmese as susceptible the [[Bengal (cat)|Bengal]] breed, with a similar physiology, has emerged, and shows a similarly large number of FCKS kittens, however this may be due to specific interest in the condition among those working with the breeds. It is reported in all breeds and in domestic non-pedigree cats, both those kept as pets and those living as 'barn cats'. An article in a Swedish cat club newsletter about FCKS led to a spike in reporting of the condition in Ragdolls in Sweden.\n{|style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n| [[File:MauFCK.jpg|thumb|upright|Egyptian Mau kitten with FCKS]]\n|[[File:RexFCK.jpg|thumb|center|Rex kitten with FCKS and Kyphosis - note narrowing of thorax around the shoulders]]\n| [[File:Flat kitten b.png|thumb|center|Oriental kitten with moderate to extreme FCKS. Pectus Excavatum is not present. The kitten was wrapped in a 'corset' for about 2 weeks. It is now a healthy adult.]]\n|}\n\nThe syndrome is life-threatening in a significant number of cases (possibly around 40%) mainly due to a lack of understanding of the underlying cause of the condition, failure to treat colic (leading to slow starvation) and insufficient sources of information in veterinary literature.\n\n== Causes ==\n\n=== Genetic/Heredity ===\nThere is no statistical evidence to suggest that FCKS may be due to genetic factors: certain bloodlines ''seem'' to produce a preponderance of kittens with the condition, but this may be due to enhanced reporting within the breed. The literature citing heredity as a cause (Saperstein, Harris & Leipold (1976)) does not provide any evidential support and the information is repeated in later literature citing that source as authority. The majority of cases are of single kittens, with low but significant numbers of whole or part litters reported. Numerous breeders experience periods in which FCKS seems to occur over a number of matings, but then stops, suggesting an environmental cause. Incidences of the condition have been reported in many litters that were repeat matings of previously healthy litters; matings repeated after the incidence of FCKS do not produce flat kittens any more frequently than non-repeat matings; recovered FCKS that have been bred from have likewise not produced offspring that suffered from the condition any more frequently than normal cats, but numbers in this category are obviously low. It is possible that some lines in which the queens provide excessive milk may lead to colic-related FCKS in the kittens, leading to the supposition of heredity. Although after experiencing cases of FCKS most breeders do not repeat matings. In 59 cases of repeat matings 52 litters did '''not''' result in FCKS again while 7 did.\n\n=== Developmental ===\nIt is possible that the lung collapse in neo-nates (i.e. around 3 days of age) could be due to a lack of [[surfactant]] -  the coating of the inside of the lung that prevents the inner surfaces of the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] from sticking together. (Causes of surfactant deficiency are not discussed here, but the role of surfactant is discussed in a number of articles in the ''British Journal of Anaesthesia'' vol. 65, 1990.<ref>particularly B A Hills: The role of lung surfactant, ''British Journal of Anaesthesia'' 1990, 65, 13-29</ref>). Kittens are born immature in many ways, and full inflation of the lungs does not happen immediately, but takes place gradually over a period of several days after birth. Although a kitten may seem active and thriving, its lungs will not be fully inflated until approx. day 3 after birth. Thus if inflation fails to happen correctly the [[Pressure#Negative pressures|negative pressure]] in the chest cavity will cause the ribcage&nbsp;\u2013 which is extremely flexible&nbsp;\u2013 to collapse inward, dragged in by the lungs, and '''not''' collapsing due to muscular cramping, and compressing the lungs.\n\n=== Infection ===\nNeo-natal and Later lung collapse may be due to lung infection, or possibly to a malfunction in the [[epiglottis]], causing the in-breath to draw air into the digestive tract rather than the lungs. A short term malfunction of this sort may be perpetuated by the resulting colic creating a feedback loop that interrupts the correct breathing process.\n\nAutopsy and analysis of [[Aspiration pneumonia|lung aspirate]] in a group of flat-chested kittens bred by a US Vet showed the presence of [[Cat flu|Herpes virus]].\n\n=== Diaphragmatic spasm ===\n[[File:Phrenic002.jpg|thumb|<center>Position of the Phrenic Nerve (diagram)</center>]]\nSpasm in the diaphragm leads to the muscle 'locking up' so that all breathing effort falls to the intercostal muscles. The resulting loss of movement causes the lungs to deflate gradually. This is easily diagnosed and treated (see Treatment below) by short-term interruption of the [[Phrenic nerve]].\n\n=== Colic ===\nA kitten that has difficulty in breathing is very likely also to suffer from [[colic]] (which can cause weight loss in the early development of a normal kitten), and a very small daily (or twice daily) dose of [[Liquid paraffin (medicinal)|liquid paraffin]] (one or two drops placed on the tongue of the kitten, or 0.1 ml) should help to alleviate this problem. FCKS kittens who do not maintain weight are usually among the group which die, but many of them may simply be unable to feed properly due to colic, becoming increasingly weak and lethargic, and fading due to malnutrition as much as to the thoracic problems.\n\nColic has many causes, but in a kitten with respiratory difficulty it is possible that a malfunction during the breathing process leads the kitten to swallow air instead of taking it into its lungs. The GI tract fills with air while the lungs do not receive a proper air supply, preventing them from inflating fully. Pressure from the stomach exacerbates the condition. Treating for colic with liquid paraffin seems to shorten recovery time from 4\u201310 weeks to a matter of days.\n\n== Treatment ==\n[[File:Position of phrenic nerve in cat.jpg|thumb|<center>Position of Phrenic nerve in a sleeping kitten. The nerve bifurcates and runs down both sides of the neck.</center>]]\nTreatment is difficult to define given the number of different causes and the wealth of anecdotal information collected by and from cat breeders. Treatments have hitherto been based on the assumption that FCKS is caused by a muscular [[spasm]], and their effectiveness is impossible to assess because some kittens will recover spontaneously without intervention.\n\nDiaphragmatic spasm is easily tested for and treated by short term interruption of the [[Phrenic nerve]]. The nerve runs down the outside of the neck where the neck joins to the shoulder, within a bundle of muscles and tendons at this junction. The cluster can be pinched gently and held for a few seconds each time. Kittens with spasmodic FCKS will show almost immediate improvement, but the treatment may need to be repeated several times over a few days as the spasm may have a tendency to recur, particularly after suckling. It is sometimes evident that the spasm only affects one side of the diaphragm, as interruption of the nerve is only necessary or effective on one side.\n\nContinuous positive air pressure ([[Continuous positive airway pressure|CPAP]]) is used in human babies with lung collapse, but this is impossible with kittens. It is possible that the success of some breeders in curing kittens by splinting the body, thus putting pressure on the ribcage, was successful as it has created the effect of positive air pressure, thus gradually re-inflating the lungs by pulling them open rather than pushing them open as is the case with CPAP (see below).\n\n=== Drugs ===\nThe use of [[steroids]] ([[Dexamethasone]]) coupled with an antibiotic ([[Amoxicillin]]) will support the kitten in a number of ways, the steroid enhancing maturation and the antibiotic addressing the possibility of underlying infection and compensating for the immuno-depressant properties of the steroid. The steroid will also encourage the kitten to feed more energetically, keeping its weight up. However the primary supportive mechanism must be nutritional. Kittens who are only supported with feeding and do not receive drugs seem to have a similar prognosis to those receiving drugs. Drug treatment cannot be used to replace nutritional support (i.e. supplementary feeding), A very small number of breeders having read the report by Sturgess et al (which was inconclusive) believe that Taurine plays a part in the condition. These breeders give the queen large doses of Taurine (1000&nbsp;mg) daily until the kittens recover&nbsp;\u2013 apparently within a few days. Long-term use of high doses of Taurine should be monitored by a veterinarian.\n\nKittens have a much higher metabolism than adults, so drugs cannot simply be calibrated based on adult protocols but adjusted for weight. Antibiotics administered 2x daily in adults need to be given 3x daily in kittens, and doses given at 24-hour intervals need to be given at 18- to 20-hour intervals. In addition, because the liver does not metabolise drugs as efficiently as in adults, a higher dose relative to body weight may need to be given. Little information is available in veterinary literature about drug dosing in neonates; almost all treatment protocols are based on adult animals. The neonatal human literature is here used as a guide. See [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4268272/ Lawrence C. Ku and P. Brian Smith, 'Dosing in neonates: Special considerations in physiology and trail design'] and multiple other sources of information. Observation of drug responses in neonatal kittens indicates increased frequency is essential.\n\n=== Splinting and physical therapy ===\nSplinting the kitten in a specially-constructed corset made from a rigid material such as a toilet roll, section of plastic bottle or high-density foam encourages the ribcage to a more normal position, and reported mortality seemed to decline when this practice was introduced.<ref>http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/health/FCKS/TreatingFCKS/ Information regarding splinting of FCKS kittens]</ref> This may be because encouraging the chest to a more correct position helps the lungs to re-inflate. However a large proportion of kittens cannot tolerate a splint, and the distress it causes is extremely counterproductive. It can also be dangerous in cases where pressure on the sides causes the sternum to move inwards rather than outwards, and should only be undertaken with veterinary support and advice. Some kittens recover without intervention, so it is not known whether the various treatments based on encouraging the thorax to return to a normal shape contributed to recovery.<ref>Although corsets can be improvised easily from e.g. plastic drinks bottles etc., one breeder has marketed a 'corset' design that she found successful with her kittens www.fck-flat-korsett.de</ref>\n\nSome breeders have found that applying manual pressure to the sides of the ribcage can help, as the chest rounds out with encouragement (gentle pressure timed to coincide with the natural movement of the thorax in breathing), but usually the chest goes flat again as soon as massage is discontinued. It may however help in encouraging the lungs to inflate a little more with each breath, but should not be used if it causes distress to the kitten. Many breeders report that affected kittens seem to enjoy massage. Encouraging a kitten to lie on its side can be helpful, and draping another kitten (or the mother's arm) over it while it is sleeping on its side places a gentle continuous pressure on the ribcage which may also be helpful. If the kitten is uncomfortable it will move away. (It is important to ensure that pressure is not placed on the kitten if it is lying flat on its chest.)\n\nOver-handling FCKS kittens can lead to unnecessary weight loss and [[Fatigue (medical)|lethargy]], so the use of massage, waking the kitten for extra feeds from the mother etc. should be checked against gains and losses in weight. Some vets believe that encouraging the kitten to cry and also to have to move more to reach its mother may be helpful. There is no data from breeders supporting this theory.\n\n== Survival and long-term prognosis ==\nIt is difficult to determine whether a kitten that goes flat will survive or not. A good indicator is the weight of the kitten: those that continue to gain weight generally have a better chance of survival. Supplement feeding is therefore recommended in all cases, together with vitamin supplements,<ref>[http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/health/FCKS/TreatingFCKS/ Information about kitten milk and other supplements further down the page]</ref> although many of these kittens will not accept hand feeding. Liquid Paraffin to alleviate colic seems to be significant in assisting normal feeding and weight-gain.\n\nAnother indicator to the severity of the case is the use of the stomach when breathing: normal kittens use only the ribcage, a flat-chested kitten may manage to breathe only using the ribcage, or may suck the gut upwards with every breath&nbsp;\u2013 if the latter is the case then the likelihood of survival seems to be lower, though still not sufficient to warrant immediate [[euthanasia]]. If the condition is stable (i.e. the flatness does not increase over time) or improving, the kitten is more likely to survive. If the condition worsens over several days, survival is less likely.\n\nKittens with FCKS may die (or have to be euthanased) very soon after onset. There are two points at which breeders report kittens that were otherwise doing well deteriorating and dying: at 10 days of age and at 3 weeks. Generally if the kitten is still flat, but survives the 3-week developmental stage, its prognosis is good. Many will have returned to a normal shape by this time. Those retaining some degree of flatness often grow out of the condition at any point in the ensuing 6 months, and the vast majority of survivors appear to lead normal lives with no side-effects, either physical or immunological.\n\nFCKS kittens that survive but who have not been given any drug treatment or support other than supplementary feeding, generally recover over a period of 4\u201310 weeks, and are usually normal by 12 weeks of age, though some take as long as 6 months to normalise. In the very small number of kittens reported so far treated with steroids, antibiotics and liquid paraffin (to address colic) recovery is usually seen within a matter of days. Given the number of different types of FCKS these kittens (all with the minor form of the condition) may not be representative of all cases. More data is required for statistical analysis.\n\nA small proportion of severe FCKS kittens are left with long-term respiratory problems, [[kyphosis]], and in some cases cardiac issues caused by the compression of the thorax during the early developmental stages (particularly where the condition has been coupled with Pectus Excavatum). Cardiac issues are generally audible on physical examination; further indications include the kitten becoming breathless after play, less active than siblings, and failure to grow and develop normally.\n\n== Breeding with FCKS ==\nCrucial in the decision to breed would be the primary cause of FCKS in the litter, which may or may not be genetic (see Heredity above). Some recovered FCKS adults have produced FCKS offspring in their turn, and some queens consistently produce flat kittens, so breeding from those lines is therefore inadvisable. However, repeat matings in which FCKS has appeared does not result in further FCKS kittens any more often than non-repeat matings. Queens and studs who consistently throw complete litters of kittens with the condition are generally neutered, but isolated instances of single flat kittens in an otherwise healthy litter seem to be unlikely to have a genetic component and neutering of parents of such kittens is not usually necessary in pedigree breeding, particularly where doing so may have detrimental effects on the gene pool.\n\nIf the cause of flattening is colic related to over-production of milk then this would not be cause for neutering. The only way to determine if the cause is digestive would be if the condition was alleviated by pinching the phrenic nerve and/or use of liquid paraffin to relieve colic, resulting in improvement in the condition.\n\nLine-breeding or inbreeding is highly inadvisable in any situation, and particularly so in lines where FCKS has appeared, given the possibility of inheritcance of any underlying condition or breeding factor that may cause kittens to develop FCKS.\n\n== Other conditions ==\nKittens with FCKS sometimes also show bony deformities such as [[Pectus Excavatum]] or [[Kyphosis]] (characterised in kittens by a dip in the spine just behind the shoulder blades). Although a kitten may be born with these deformities, extreme forms of FCKS may cause Kyphosis to develop in an otherwise normal kitten, as the kitten grows with the spine held in an abnormal position due to the flattened ribcage. When there are bony deformities in the upper body, or other problems present, these may contribute to malfunctioning in soft-tissue organs such as the respiratory and digestive systems.\n\n== Flat chestedness in other animals ==\nFlat chest occurs in piglets and puppies, may be known in cattle (anecdotal information only), and is also recorded in humans, though possibly in humans this is not the same type of condition and may be a bone deformity.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.vetstream.com/treat/felis/diseases/flat-chested-kitten-and-pectus-excavatum Vetstream article on FCKS in journal ''Felis'' ISSN 2398-2950]\n* [http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/health/page58/index.html Flat-Chested Kitten Syndrome]\n* [http://www.ramesescats.co.uk/FCKSVeterinary.pdf Veterinary information about FCKS written by Dr Kit Sturgess MA VetMB PhD CertVR DSAM CertVC MRCVS] -- warning, out of date.\n* [http://theses.vet-alfort.fr/telecharger.php?id=1840/  Marine Minnaert: ''\u00c9tude r\u00e9trospective de la cage thoracique plate chez le chat : caract\u00e9ristiques \u00e9pid\u00e9miologiques et cliniques, pronostic et aspects g\u00e9n\u00e9tiques'', PhD thesis (2014) pdf]\n* [https://icatcare.org/advice/cat-health/flat-chested-kitten-syndrome/ International Cat Care website; based on Sturgess]\n[[Category:Cat diseases]]\n[[Category:Respiratory and cardiovascular disorders specific to the perinatal period]]\n*[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9423237?dopt=abstract/ Sturgess C P, Waters L, Gruffydd-Jones T J et al (1997) Investigation of the association between whole blood and tissue taurine levels and the development of thoracic deformities in neonatal Burmese kittens.

There was regular, intermittent warfare between the French and the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] on one side and the northern New England colonies on the other (''See the Northeast Coast Campaigns of [[King William's War#New England, Acadia and Newfoundland Theatre|1688]], [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1703)|1703]], [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1723)|1723]], [[Father Rale's War#Northeast Coast Campaign (1724)|1724]]''). For the French, the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] also protected the chief entrance to [[Canada (New France)|Canada]], as well as the nearby French fisheries. The French government had spent 25 years in fortifying it, and the cost of its defenses was reckoned at thirty million livres.{{sfnp|Parkman|1897}}\nAlthough the fortress's construction and layout was acknowledged as having superior seaward defences, a series of low rises behind them made it vulnerable to a land attack. The low rises provided attackers places to erect siege batteries. The fort's [[garrison]] was poorly paid and supplied, and its inexperienced leaders mistrusted them. The colonial attackers were also lacking in experience, but ultimately succeeded in gaining control of the surrounding defences. The defenders surrendered in the face of an imminent assault.\n\nLouisbourg was an important bargaining chip in the peace negotiations to end the war, since it represented a major British success. Factions within the British government were opposed to returning it to the French as part of any peace agreement, but these were eventually overruled, and Louisbourg was returned, over the objections of the victorious British North Americans, to French control after the 1748 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], in return for French concessions elsewhere.\n\n==Context==\n[[File:SiegeOfLouisbourg1745.png|thumb|400px|left|Siege Of Louisbourg 1745]]\nFrom 1688 onward there had been a number of military campaigns fought between the French and their allies and the English in the region. Under the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], which ended the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the French colony of [[Acadia]] had been ceded to Great Britain. The tribes of [[Wabanaki Confederacy]], had a long history of raiding British settlements along Northern New England in present-day Maine. During the 17th and early-18th century, the Wabanaki fought in several campaigns, including in [[King William's War#New England, Acadia and Newfoundland Theatre|1688]], [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1703)|1703]], [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1723)|1723]], [[Father Rale's War#Northeast Coast Campaign (1724)|1724]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Tod |last=Scott |title=Mi'kmaw Armed Resistance to British Expansion in Northern New England (1676\u20131781) |journal=Royal Nova Scotia Historical Society Journal |volume=19 |date=2016 |pp=1\u201318 |url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/83c0a90994c292bb4fe8303bf8d769b2/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=446300}}<br />\u2022&nbsp;{{cite book|last1=Reid|first1=John G.|authorlink1=John G.

This port was used by the New England fishing fleet; however, the Canso Islands (including Grassy Island) were contested by both Britain and France.\n\nThe prisoners taken during the Canso raid were first brought to Louisbourg, where they were given freedom to move around. Some of the military men took careful note of the fortress design, layout, and condition, as well as the size and condition of its garrison and armaments.{{sfnp|Downey|1965|p=48}} These men were eventually released to [[Boston]], where their intelligence, along with that provided by merchants who did business at Louisbourg, proved useful in planning the attack.\n\nThe French, military and civilian alike, were not in the best of condition at Louisbourg. Supplies were short in 1744, and the fishermen were reluctant to sail without adequate provisions. The military rank and file claimed that they were promised a share of the spoils from the Canso raid, which had instead gone to officers, who sold those same provisions and profited in the endeavour.{{sfnp|Downey|1965|pp=48-51}} In December 1744, the troops mutinied over the poor conditions and pay that was months overdue. Even after acting Governor [[Louis Du Pont Duchambon]] managed to quiet the discontent by releasing back pay and supplies, the following winter was extremely tense, as the military leadership maintained a tenuous hold on the situation. Duchambon was even reluctant to send for help, fearing the message would be intercepted and spark further unrest. Word of the unrest did, however, make its way to Boston.{{sfnp|Downey|1965|p=52}}\n\nIn 1745, the governor of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], [[William Shirley]], secured by a narrow margin the support of the Massachusetts legislature for an attack on the fortress. He and the governor of the [[Province of New Hampshire]], [[Benning Wentworth]], sought the support of other colonies. Connecticut provided 500 troops, New Hampshire 450, Rhode Island a ship, New York ten cannons, and Pennsylvania and New Jersey funds.{{sfnp|Downey|1965|p=57}} The force was under the command of [[William Pepperrell]] of [[Kittery, Maine|Kittery]] (in the portion of the Massachusetts colony that is now the state of [[Maine]]), and a fleet of colonial ships was assembled and placed under the command of Captain [[Edward Tyng]]. Governor Shirley sent to Commodore [[Peter Warren (Royal Navy officer)|Peter Warren]], the chief officer of the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[West Indies]] station, a request for naval support in the event of an encounter with French warships, which would significantly outclass any of the colonial ships. Warren at first declined this offer, lacking authorization from [[London]] to assist. Only a few days later, he received orders from the [[Admiralty]] to proceed to protect the New England fisheries. The expedition set sail from Boston in stages beginning in early March 1745 with 4,200 soldiers and sailors aboard a total of 90 ships.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Battle==\n=== Canso and Port Toulouse ===\n{{main|Siege of Port Toulouse}}\n[[File:Louisbourg assiegee en 1745.jpg|400px|thumb|The Capture of Louisburg, 1745 by [[Peter Monamy]]]]\nThe force stopped at Canso to reprovision. There they were met by Commodore Warren, enlarging the expedition by 16 ships. In late March, the naval forces began to blockade Louisbourg, however ice fields were being swept from the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] to the seas off Louisbourg that spring, presenting a considerable hazard to wooden-hulled sailing ships. The poor weather and general state of disorganization of the New England naval forces resulted in numerous delays to the expedition, however, they kept busy harassing French fishing and shipping in the waters surrounding \u00cele-Royale.\n\nWith the ice fields gone by late April, the siege began in earnest. Pepperell's land forces sailed in transports from Canso. On May 2, he [[Siege of Port Toulouse|besieged Port Toulouse]] (present-day [[St. Peter's, Nova Scotia]]) as well as destroying several coastal villages in the area between Canso and Louisbourg.\n\n=== Landing ===\n[[File:Siege of Louisbourg 1745.jpg|thumb|New England troops during the siege.]]\nOn May 11, [[John Gorham (military officer)|John Gorham]] and his [[Gorham's Rangers|rangers]] led the charge to land troops on the shores close to the fortress. They tried to land their whale boats at Flat Point Cover while covered by the fire power of the ''Lord Montague'', ''Boston Packet'' and ''Massachusetts''. Gorham was repelled by 20 French troops that occupied the cove. Gorham quickly regrouped with several other vessels and the operation was re-directed to Kennington Cove. The French troops were unable to re-position themselves in time to stop the landing of British troops. After 1500 British were already on shore, 200 French troops arrived to repel the British, led by [[Pierre Morpain]] and De la Boularderie. Morpain retreated while De La Boularderie gave himself up as a prisoner. The British would land 2000 troops by the end of the day.{{sfnp|Rawlyk|1999|p=41}}\n\n=== Destroying the fisheries ===\nWhile most of the troops were employed at attacking the Royal Battery, the Island Battery and Fortress Louisbourg, others were scouting around the perimeter of the fortress, destroying small fishing villages.

All of New England celebrated the taking of France's mighty fortress on the Atlantic.\n\nLosses to the New England forces in battle had been modest, although the garrison that occupied the fortress during the following winter suffered many deaths from cold and disease. After the fall of Louisbourg, the New Englanders also assumed control of [[Port-la-Joye\u2013Fort Amherst|Port-La-Joye]] on present-day [[Prince Edward Island]] (which the French regained in battle the following year).\n\nDespite the British conquest of Louisbourg, the French and Wabanaki attacks continued on Northern New England in the campaigns of [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1745)|1745]], [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1746)|1746]], and [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1747)|1747]]).\n\nDuchambon's actions in the mutiny and siege were the subject of inquiries upon his return to France in August 1745. Duchambon was protected from reprisals by the actions of [[Fran\u00e7ois Bigot]], Louisbourg's [[intendant|civilian administrator]], who deflected much of the blame onto others. Duchambon retired from the service with a pension in March 1746.\n\nWilliam Pepperrell and Peter Warren were both richly rewarded for their efforts. Warren, in addition to profiting from prize money, was promoted to [[rear admiral]]. Pepperrell was made a [[baronetcy|baronet]] by [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] and given a commission as colonel of [[Pepperrell's Regiment|a new regiment]], numbered 66th at the time (but not to be confused with the later [[66th Regiment of Foot]]). Governor Shirley was also given a colonel's commission to raise [[Shirley's Regiment|his own regiment]].\n\nBoth France and Britain planned expeditions to North America in the wake of the capture. The great [[Duc d'Anville Expedition]] led by [[Jean-Baptiste Louis Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de La Rochefoucauld de Roye|Admiral Jean-Batiste, De Roye de la Rochefoucauld, Duc d'Anville]] was dispatched from France to retake Louisbourg and recover Acadia in 1746.  However it was destroyed by storms, disease, and British naval attacks and never reached the fortress.  The British government made plans, based on suggestions by Shirley and Warren, for a follow-up expedition to seize [[Quebec]]. For a variety of reasons, including a late start and contrary winds, the 1746 expedition did not leave European waters, and was instead diverted to [[Raid on Lorient|raid the French port of Lorient]].  Although the idea was also considered for the 1747 campaign season, it again failed to bear fruit.\n\nWhen the war ended with the signing of the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1748, Louisbourg was returned to France in exchange for the return of [[Madras]] to Britain, and the withdrawal of French troops from the [[Low Countries]]. The decision to withdraw from Louisbourg came under fierce attacks in London from opponents of the [[Pelham Ministry]], but it went ahead nonetheless. In 1758 the fortress [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|was captured again by the British]] during the [[Seven Years' War]], this time permanently, as \u00cele-Royale and much of [[New France]] was ceded to Britain under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|1763 Treaty of Paris]].\n\n== French Naval Officers ==\n* Chevalier Guy-Fran\u00e7ois de Co\u00ebtnempren (Comte de Kersaint), (Renommee) <ref>{{Cite book | url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hxta91&view=1up&seq=38 |title = The Tartar:the armed sloop of the colony of Rhode Island, in King George's war|publisher = Providence|date = 2020-02-24}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=NSI6AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA605&lpg=PA605&dq=captain+Richard+Tiddleman++(Superbe&source=bl&ots=fOl7pe8-qP&sig=ACfU3U3uL6_sUNk94qZsN9Vv0AMr40ec1g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjR9euogpHnAhWvrFkKHf9_BrMQ6AEwFHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=louisbourg&f=false p. 219]</ref>\n\n== British Army Regiments: Officers ==\n\n=== Maine ===\n1.

There was regular, intermittent warfare between the French and the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] on one side and the northern New England colonies on the other (''See the Northeast Coast Campaigns of [[King William's War#New England, Acadia and Newfoundland Theatre|1688]], [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1703)|1703]], [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1723)|1723]], [[Father Rale's War#Northeast Coast Campaign (1724)|1724]]''). For the French, the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] also protected the chief entrance to [[Canada (New France)|Canada]], as well as the nearby French fisheries. The French government had spent 25 years in fortifying it, and the cost of its defenses was reckoned at thirty million livres.{{sfnp|Parkman|1897}}\nAlthough the fortress's construction and layout was acknowledged as having superior seaward defences, a series of low rises behind them made it vulnerable to a land attack. The low rises provided attackers places to erect siege batteries. The fort's [[garrison]] was poorly paid and supplied, and its inexperienced leaders mistrusted them. The colonial attackers were also lacking in experience, but ultimately succeeded in gaining control of the surrounding defences. The defenders surrendered in the face of an imminent assault.\n\nLouisbourg was an important bargaining chip in the peace negotiations to end the war, since it represented a major British success. Factions within the British government were opposed to returning it to the French as part of any peace agreement, but these were eventually overruled, and Louisbourg was returned, over the objections of the victorious British North Americans, to French control after the 1748 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], in return for French concessions elsewhere.\n\n==Context==\n[[File:SiegeOfLouisbourg1745.png|thumb|400px|left|Siege Of Louisbourg 1745]]\nFrom 1688 onward there had been a number of military campaigns fought between the French and their allies and the English in the region. Under the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], which ended the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the French colony of [[Acadia]] had been ceded to Great Britain. The tribes of [[Wabanaki Confederacy]], had a long history of raiding British settlements along Northern New England in present-day Maine. During the 17th and early-18th century, the Wabanaki fought in several campaigns, including in [[King William's War#New England, Acadia and Newfoundland Theatre|1688]], [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1703)|1703]], [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1723)|1723]], [[Father Rale's War#Northeast Coast Campaign (1724)|1724]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Tod |last=Scott |title=Mi'kmaw Armed Resistance to British Expansion in Northern New England (1676\u20131781) |journal=Royal Nova Scotia Historical Society Journal |volume=19 |date=2016 |pp=1\u201318 |url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/83c0a90994c292bb4fe8303bf8d769b2/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=446300}}<br />\u2022&nbsp;{{cite book|last1=Reid|first1=John G.|authorlink1=John G.

This port was used by the New England fishing fleet; however, the Canso Islands (including Grassy Island) were contested by both Britain and France.\n\nThe prisoners taken during the Canso raid were first brought to Louisbourg, where they were given freedom to move around. Some of the military men took careful note of the fortress design, layout, and condition, as well as the size and condition of its garrison and armaments.{{sfnp|Downey|1965|p=48}} These men were eventually released to [[Boston]], where their intelligence, along with that provided by merchants who did business at Louisbourg, proved useful in planning the attack.\n\nThe French, military and civilian alike, were not in the best of condition at Louisbourg. Supplies were short in 1744, and the fishermen were reluctant to sail without adequate provisions. The military rank and file claimed that they were promised a share of the spoils from the Canso raid, which had instead gone to officers, who sold those same provisions and profited in the endeavour.{{sfnp|Downey|1965|pp=48-51}} In December 1744, the troops mutinied over the poor conditions and pay that was months overdue. Even after acting Governor [[Louis Du Pont Duchambon]] managed to quiet the discontent by releasing back pay and supplies, the following winter was extremely tense, as the military leadership maintained a tenuous hold on the situation. Duchambon was even reluctant to send for help, fearing the message would be intercepted and spark further unrest. Word of the unrest did, however, make its way to Boston.{{sfnp|Downey|1965|p=52}}\n\nIn 1745, the governor of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], [[William Shirley]], secured by a narrow margin the support of the Massachusetts legislature for an attack on the fortress. He and the governor of the [[Province of New Hampshire]], [[Benning Wentworth]], sought the support of other colonies. Connecticut provided 500 troops, New Hampshire 450, Rhode Island a ship, New York ten cannons, and Pennsylvania and New Jersey funds.{{sfnp|Downey|1965|p=57}} The force was under the command of [[William Pepperrell]] of [[Kittery, Maine|Kittery]] (in the portion of the Massachusetts colony that is now the state of [[Maine]]), and a fleet of colonial ships was assembled and placed under the command of Captain [[Edward Tyng]]. Governor Shirley sent to Commodore [[Peter Warren (Royal Navy officer)|Peter Warren]], the chief officer of the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[West Indies]] station, a request for naval support in the event of an encounter with French warships, which would significantly outclass any of the colonial ships. Warren at first declined this offer, lacking authorization from [[London]] to assist. Only a few days later, he received orders from the [[Admiralty]] to proceed to protect the New England fisheries. The expedition set sail from Boston in stages beginning in early March 1745 with 4,200 soldiers and sailors aboard a total of 90 ships.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Battle==\n=== Canso and Port Toulouse ===\n{{main|Siege of Port Toulouse}}\n[[File:Louisbourg assiegee en 1745.jpg|400px|thumb|The Capture of Louisburg, 1745 by [[Peter Monamy]]]]\nThe force stopped at Canso to reprovision. There they were met by Commodore Warren, enlarging the expedition by 16 ships. In late March, the naval forces began to blockade Louisbourg, however ice fields were being swept from the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] to the seas off Louisbourg that spring, presenting a considerable hazard to wooden-hulled sailing ships. The poor weather and general state of disorganization of the New England naval forces resulted in numerous delays to the expedition, however, they kept busy harassing French fishing and shipping in the waters surrounding \u00cele-Royale.\n\nWith the ice fields gone by late April, the siege began in earnest. Pepperell's land forces sailed in transports from Canso. On May 2, he [[Siege of Port Toulouse|besieged Port Toulouse]] (present-day [[St. Peter's, Nova Scotia]]) as well as destroying several coastal villages in the area between Canso and Louisbourg.\n\n=== Landing ===\n[[File:Siege of Louisbourg 1745.jpg|thumb|New England troops during the siege.]]\nOn May 11, [[John Gorham (military officer)|John Gorham]] and his [[Gorham's Rangers|rangers]] led the charge to land troops on the shores close to the fortress. They tried to land their whale boats at Flat Point Cover while covered by the fire power of the ''Lord Montague'', ''Boston Packet'' and ''Massachusetts''. Gorham was repelled by 20 French troops that occupied the cove. Gorham quickly regrouped with several other vessels and the operation was re-directed to Kennington Cove. The French troops were unable to re-position themselves in time to stop the landing of British troops. After 1500 British were already on shore, 200 French troops arrived to repel the British, led by [[Pierre Morpain]] and De la Boularderie. Morpain retreated while De La Boularderie gave himself up as a prisoner. The British would land 2000 troops by the end of the day.{{sfnp|Rawlyk|1999|p=41}}\n\n=== Destroying the fisheries ===\nWhile most of the troops were employed at attacking the Royal Battery, the Island Battery and Fortress Louisbourg, others were scouting around the perimeter of the fortress, destroying small fishing villages.

He shelled the Island Battery for five days and on June 27 the French Battery was silenced.\n\n=== Surrender ===\nOn June 27, French and native reinforcements led by Paul Marin were prevented from reaching Louisbourg in the [[Naval battle off Tatamagouche]].{{sfnp|Patterson|1917|pp=17\u201318}} The New Englanders' landward siege was supported by Commodore Warren's fleet and, following 47 days (six weeks and five days) of siege and bombardment, the French capitulated on June 28, 1745.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Fortress Louisbourg, Siege of Louisbourg 1745 (inset) by Peter Monamy.png|thumb|Fortress Louisbourg, Capture of Louisbourg 1745 (inset) by Peter Monamy]]\nNews of the victory reached Governor Shirley in Boston on July 3 which, coincidentally, was commencement day at Harvard (usually a day of celebration in itself). All of New England celebrated the taking of France's mighty fortress on the Atlantic.\n\nLosses to the New England forces in battle had been modest, although the garrison that occupied the fortress during the following winter suffered many deaths from cold and disease. After the fall of Louisbourg, the New Englanders also assumed control of [[Port-la-Joye\u2013Fort Amherst|Port-La-Joye]] on present-day [[Prince Edward Island]] (which the French regained in battle the following year).\n\nDespite the British conquest of Louisbourg, the French and Wabanaki attacks continued on Northern New England in the campaigns of [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1745)|1745]], [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1746)|1746]], and [[Northeast Coast Campaign (1747)|1747]]).\n\nDuchambon's actions in the mutiny and siege were the subject of inquiries upon his return to France in August 1745. Duchambon was protected from reprisals by the actions of [[Fran\u00e7ois Bigot]], Louisbourg's [[intendant|civilian administrator]], who deflected much of the blame onto others. Duchambon retired from the service with a pension in March 1746.\n\nWilliam Pepperrell and Peter Warren were both richly rewarded for their efforts. Warren, in addition to profiting from prize money, was promoted to [[rear admiral]]. Pepperrell was made a [[baronetcy|baronet]] by [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]] and given a commission as colonel of [[Pepperrell's Regiment|a new regiment]], numbered 66th at the time (but not to be confused with the later [[66th Regiment of Foot]]). Governor Shirley was also given a colonel's commission to raise [[Shirley's Regiment|his own regiment]].\n\nBoth France and Britain planned expeditions to North America in the wake of the capture. The great [[Duc d'Anville Expedition]] led by [[Jean-Baptiste Louis Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de La Rochefoucauld de Roye|Admiral Jean-Batiste, De Roye de la Rochefoucauld, Duc d'Anville]] was dispatched from France to retake Louisbourg and recover Acadia in 1746.  However it was destroyed by storms, disease, and British naval attacks and never reached the fortress.  The British government made plans, based on suggestions by Shirley and Warren, for a follow-up expedition to seize [[Quebec]]. For a variety of reasons, including a late start and contrary winds, the 1746 expedition did not leave European waters, and was instead diverted to [[Raid on Lorient|raid the French port of Lorient]].  Although the idea was also considered for the 1747 campaign season, it again failed to bear fruit.\n\nWhen the war ended with the signing of the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1748, Louisbourg was returned to France in exchange for the return of [[Madras]] to Britain, and the withdrawal of French troops from the [[Low Countries]]. The decision to withdraw from Louisbourg came under fierce attacks in London from opponents of the [[Pelham Ministry]], but it went ahead nonetheless. In 1758 the fortress [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|was captured again by the British]] during the [[Seven Years' War]], this time permanently, as \u00cele-Royale and much of [[New France]] was ceded to Britain under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|1763 Treaty of Paris]].\n\n== French Naval Officers ==\n* Chevalier Guy-Fran\u00e7ois de Co\u00ebtnempren (Comte de Kersaint), (Renommee) <ref>{{Cite book | url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hxta91&view=1up&seq=38 |title = The Tartar:the armed sloop of the colony of Rhode Island, in King George's war|publisher = Providence|date = 2020-02-24}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=NSI6AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA605&lpg=PA605&dq=captain+Richard+Tiddleman++(Superbe&source=bl&ots=fOl7pe8-qP&sig=ACfU3U3uL6_sUNk94qZsN9Vv0AMr40ec1g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjR9euogpHnAhWvrFkKHf9_BrMQ6AEwFHoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=louisbourg&f=false p. 219]</ref>\n\n== British Army Regiments: Officers ==\n\n=== Maine ===\n1.

He was a follower of Persian Zoroastrian [[Historical Vedic religion|Brahmanism]].\n\nPushyamitra was originally a ''Senapati'' \"General\" of the [[Maurya Empire]]. In 185 BCE he assassinated the last Mauryan Emperor, [[Brihadratha Maurya]], during an army review, and proclaimed himself emperor. \n\nPushyamitra is recorded to have performed numerous [[Ashvamedha]] campaigns to legitimize his right to rule.\n\nInscriptions of the Shungas have been found as far as the [[Ayodhya]] (the [[Dhanadeva-Ayodhya inscription]]), and the ''[[Divyavadana]]'' mentions that he sent an army to persecute Buddhist monks as far as [[Sagala|Sakala]] ([[Sialkot]]) in the [[Punjab region]] in the northwest.\n\nThe Buddhist texts state that Pushyamitra cruelly persecuted the Buddhists, although some modern scholars have expressed skepticism about these claims.\n\n== Ancestry ==\n[[File:I17 1karshapana Sunga MACW4325 1ar (8485402873).jpg|thumb|300px|A silver coin of 1 [[karshapana]] of King Pushyamitra Sunga (185-149 BC) of the Sunga dynasty (185-73 BC), workshop of Vidisa (?). ''Obv:'' 5 symbols including a sun ''Rev:'' 2 symbols.]]\n[[File:SungaCoin.JPG|thumb|300px|Bronze coin of the Shunga period, Eastern India. 2nd\u20131st century BCE.]]\nPushyamitra Shunga was the hereditary ruler of [[Vidisha]]. It was incorporated into the Maurya Empire uptil his led [[coup d'\u00e9tat]].\n\nSeveral sources suggest that Pushyamitra was a [[Brahmin]] [[warrior]] and the 16th century Buddhist scholar [[Taranatha]] explicitly calls him a Brahmin king.{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|p=29}} However, the various sources offer differing suggestions about which Brahmin [[gotra]] (clan) Pushyamitra belonged to. A [[Purana|Puranic]] manuscript mentions persons who were born of \"Shunga, a descendant of [[Bharadvaja]], by a woman married in the family of Kata, a descendant of [[Vishvamitra]]\". Based on this, [[K. P. Jayaswal]] theorized that Shunga was a [[Brahmin]] with two gotras (''dwaimushyayana'' or ''dvigotra''): his family traced their ancestry to both Bharadvaja and Vishvamitra lineages.{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|pp=28-29}} The ''Pravara Kanda'' of the ''[[Apastamba]]'' mentions a \"Shunga-Shaishiri\" gotra. J. C. Ghosh theorized that the Shunga family derived from the Shunga of the Bharadvaja gotra, and the Shaishiri of the Vishvamitra gotra (Kata group).{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|p=30}}<ref>''Ghosh, J.C.,\"The Dynastic-Name of the Kings of the Pushyamitra Family,\" J.B.O.R.S, Vol. XXXIII, 1937, p.360''</ref>\n\nHowever, the ''[[Matsya Purana]]'' mentions the \"Shunga-Shaishiri\" ''dwaimushyayana'' gotra (named \"Shaunga-Shaishireya\" here) as a combination of the Bharadvaja and [[Kashyapa]] (not Vishvamitra) gotras. The ''[[Harivamsa]]'' mentions a [[dvija|twice-born]] general of the [[Kashyapa]] gotra who performed the [[Ashvamedha]] sacrifice. Some scholars such as Jayaswal identify this general with Pushyamitra. The ''[[Malavikagnimitra]]'' describes Pushyamitra as a \"Baimbaki\". [[Hem Chandra Raychaudhuri|H. C. Raychaudhuri]], who read this term as \"Baimbika\", identified it with Baimbakayah of the [[Baudhayana Shrauta Sutra]], who was of the Kashyapa gotra (although other scholars believe that the term \"Baimbaki\" signifies descent from a person named Bimba, or refers to a heroic lover in general).{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|pp=29-30}} Bela Lahiri theorizes that the constituents of a ''dwaimushyayana'' gotra may have differed during different periods, and Pushyamitra may have belonged to one of these gotras.{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|p=33}}\n\nAccording to the Puranas, Pushyamitra became the king after killing his master [[Brihadratha]], the last Mauryan king.{{sfn|Thapar|2013|p=296}} However, the Buddhist text ''[[Divyavadana]]'' names Pushyamitra as the last Mauryan king.{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|p=29}} This text appears to have confused Brihadratha with Pushyamitra.{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|p=30}}\n\nH. C. Raychaudhuri theorized that the name \"Shunga\" is derived from the Sanskrit word for the fig tree.<ref>''Raychaudhari Hemchandra, \"Tha Audvijja Senani of the Harivansa?\", Indian culture, Vol. IV, 1938, P. 360-365''</ref>\n\n== Alleged persecution of Buddhists ==\n=== Buddhist accounts ===\n[[File:Sunga horseman Bharhut.jpg|thumb|Sunga horseman, Bharhut.]]\nBuddhist texts state that Pushyamitra cruelly persecuted the Buddhists. The earliest source to mention this is the 2nd Century CE text ''[[Ashokavadana]]'' (a part of ''[[Divyavadana]]''). According to this account, Pushyamitra (described as the last Mauryan king) wanted to be famous. His ministers advised him that as long as Buddhism remained the dominant faith, he would never be as famous as his ancestor [[Ashoka]], who had commissioned 84,000 [[stupa]]s. One advisor told him that he could become famous by destroying Buddhism. Pushyamitra then tried to destroy the [[Kukkutarama]] monastery, but it was saved by a miracle. He then proceeded to [[Sagala|Shakala]] in the north-west, where he offered a prize of one hundred ''dinara''s (gold coins) for every head of a Buddhist monk brought to him. Next, he proceeded to the Koshthaka kingdom, where a Buddhist [[yaksha]] named Damshtranivasin killed him and his army with help of another yaksha named Krimisha.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|pp=95-96}}{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|p=33}}\n\n{{quote|... Pushyamitra equipped a fourfold army, and intending to destroy the Buddhist religion, he went to the [[Kukkutarama]] (in [[Pataliputra]]). ... Pushyamitra therefore destroyed the [[sangharama]], killed the monks there, and departed. ...

A [[Purana|Puranic]] manuscript mentions persons who were born of \"Shunga, a descendant of [[Bharadvaja]], by a woman married in the family of Kata, a descendant of [[Vishvamitra]]\". Based on this, [[K. P. Jayaswal]] theorized that Shunga was a [[Brahmin]] with two gotras (''dwaimushyayana'' or ''dvigotra''): his family traced their ancestry to both Bharadvaja and Vishvamitra lineages.{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|pp=28-29}} The ''Pravara Kanda'' of the ''[[Apastamba]]'' mentions a \"Shunga-Shaishiri\" gotra. J. C. Ghosh theorized that the Shunga family derived from the Shunga of the Bharadvaja gotra, and the Shaishiri of the Vishvamitra gotra (Kata group).{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|p=30}}<ref>''Ghosh, J.C.,\"The Dynastic-Name of the Kings of the Pushyamitra Family,\" J.B.O.R.S, Vol. XXXIII, 1937, p.360''</ref>\n\nHowever, the ''[[Matsya Purana]]'' mentions the \"Shunga-Shaishiri\" ''dwaimushyayana'' gotra (named \"Shaunga-Shaishireya\" here) as a combination of the Bharadvaja and [[Kashyapa]] (not Vishvamitra) gotras. The ''[[Harivamsa]]'' mentions a [[dvija|twice-born]] general of the [[Kashyapa]] gotra who performed the [[Ashvamedha]] sacrifice. Some scholars such as Jayaswal identify this general with Pushyamitra. The ''[[Malavikagnimitra]]'' describes Pushyamitra as a \"Baimbaki\". [[Hem Chandra Raychaudhuri|H. C. Raychaudhuri]], who read this term as \"Baimbika\", identified it with Baimbakayah of the [[Baudhayana Shrauta Sutra]], who was of the Kashyapa gotra (although other scholars believe that the term \"Baimbaki\" signifies descent from a person named Bimba, or refers to a heroic lover in general).{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|pp=29-30}} Bela Lahiri theorizes that the constituents of a ''dwaimushyayana'' gotra may have differed during different periods, and Pushyamitra may have belonged to one of these gotras.{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|p=33}}\n\nAccording to the Puranas, Pushyamitra became the king after killing his master [[Brihadratha]], the last Mauryan king.{{sfn|Thapar|2013|p=296}} However, the Buddhist text ''[[Divyavadana]]'' names Pushyamitra as the last Mauryan king.{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|p=29}} This text appears to have confused Brihadratha with Pushyamitra.{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|p=30}}\n\nH.

The earliest source to mention this is the 2nd Century CE text ''[[Ashokavadana]]'' (a part of ''[[Divyavadana]]''). According to this account, Pushyamitra (described as the last Mauryan king) wanted to be famous. His ministers advised him that as long as Buddhism remained the dominant faith, he would never be as famous as his ancestor [[Ashoka]], who had commissioned 84,000 [[stupa]]s. One advisor told him that he could become famous by destroying Buddhism. Pushyamitra then tried to destroy the [[Kukkutarama]] monastery, but it was saved by a miracle. He then proceeded to [[Sagala|Shakala]] in the north-west, where he offered a prize of one hundred ''dinara''s (gold coins) for every head of a Buddhist monk brought to him. Next, he proceeded to the Koshthaka kingdom, where a Buddhist [[yaksha]] named Damshtranivasin killed him and his army with help of another yaksha named Krimisha.{{sfn|Simmons|Sarao|2010|pp=95-96}}{{sfn|Lahiri|1974|p=33}}\n\n{{quote|...
