The name derives from \"rocky land\", as the area has been aptly described.\n\nRockland County is the smallest county by area in New York State outside [[New York City]]. It comprises five towns and nineteen incorporated villages, with numerous unincorporated villages (sixteen) and [[Hamlet (New York)|hamlets]]. Rockland County is designated as a [[List of Preserve America Communities|Preserve America Community]], and nearly a third of the county's area is parkland. The county has the largest [[American Jews|Jewish]] population per capita of any U.S. county, with 31.4%, or 90,000 residents, being Jewish.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rockland County|url=https://www.ny.gov/counties/rockland|website=New York State|accessdate=4 January 2019}}</ref> Rockland also ranked 31st on the list of highest-income counties by median [[household income in the United States]], with a median household income of $82,534 according to the 2010 census.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Rockland County, New York (1798\u20131900)}}\n[[File:Half Moon in Hudson.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Hudson]]'s ''Halve Maen'' (''Half Moon'') on the Hudson River]]\n[[File:SouthNyackNY CarsonMcCullersHouse.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Carson McCullers House]] in South Nyack]]\n[[File:DeWint House Tappan.JPG|thumb|[[DeWint House]] (circa 1700) is the oldest home in Rockland County.]]\n[[File:RocklandCountyCourthouse.jpg|thumb|Historic [[Rockland County Courthouse and Dutch Gardens|Rockland County Courthouse]] in New City]]\n\nThe area that would become Rockland County was originally inhabited by [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking Aboriginals, including [[Munsee]]s, or [[Lenni Lenape]].\n\nIn 1609, [[Henry Hudson]], thinking he had found the legendary \"[[Northwest Passage]]\", sailed on the ''Half Moon'' up the river that would one day bear his name and anchored near the area that is now [[Haverstraw, New York|Haverstraw]] before continuing to disillusionment north of [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] were the first Europeans to settle in the area, around 1675.<ref name=NY>{{cite web|url=http://www.co.rockland.ny.us/Arts/history.htm|title=County of Rockland, New York :: Home |publisher=Co.rockland.ny.us|accessdate=3 February 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311104721/http://www.co.rockland.ny.us/Arts/history.htm|archivedate=March 11, 2012}}</ref> These settlers, eager to escape \"city life\", moved from Manhattan to Rockland.  A number of unique Dutch-style red sandstone houses still stand, and many place names in the county reveal their Dutch origin. When the [[Duke of York]] (who became King [[James II of England]]) established the first twelve counties of New York in 1683, present-day Rockland County was part of [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]], known then as ''\"Orange County South of the Mountains\"''. [[Orangetown, New York|Orangetown]] was created at the same time under a royal grant, originally encompassing all of modern Rockland County. Around this time, as the English began to colonize [[Nyack, New York|Nyack]] and [[Tappan, New York|Tappan]], the Native Americans began to leave Rockland in search of undisturbed land further north.<ref name=NY/>\n\nThe natural barrier of the [[Ramapo Mountains]] and the size of the county made it difficult to carry out governmental activities. At one point there were twin governments, one on each side of the Ramapo Mountains. For this reason, Rockland split off from Orange in 1798 to form its own county. That same year the county seat was transferred from Tappan to New City, where a new courthouse was built.\n\nHaverstraw was separated from Orangetown in 1719 and became a town in 1788; it included the present-day [[Clarkstown, New York|Clarkstown]], [[Ramapo, New York|Ramapo]] and [[Stony Point, New York|Stony Point]]. Clarkstown and Ramapo became towns in 1791, followed by Stony Point in 1865.\n[[File:Lenapehoking.png|thumb|upright|The territory of the Lenape in present-day southern New York, New Jersey and eastern sections of Delaware and Pennsylvania]]\n\nDuring the [[American Revolution]], when control of the [[Hudson River]] was viewed by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] as strategic to dominating the American territories, Rockland saw [[battle|skirmishes]] at Haverstraw, Nyack and [[Piermont, New York|Piermont]], and significant military engagements at the [[Battle of Stony Point]], where General \"Mad\" [[Anthony Wayne]] earned his nickname. [[George Washington]] had headquarters for a time at John Suffern's tavern, the later site of the village of [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]]. British Major [[John Andr\u00e9]] met with American traitor [[Benedict Arnold]] near Stony Point to buy the plans for the [[fortification]]s at [[West Point, New York|West Point]]. Andr\u00e9 was captured with the plans in [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]] on his way back to the British lines; he was brought to Tappan for trial in the Tappan church, found guilty, hanged and buried nearby. Still another important chapter in the story of the Revolution was written on May 5, 1783, when General Washington received [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Sir Guy Carleton]] at the [[DeWint House]], where they discussed terms of a peace treaty. Two days later Washington visited Sir Guy aboard a British war vessel. On this day the King's Navy fired its first salute to the flag of the United States of America.\n\nIn the decades following the Revolution, Rockland became popular for its stone and bricks. These products, however, required quarrying in land that many later believed should be set aside as a preserve. Many unsuccessful efforts were made to turn much of the [[Hudson Highlands]] on the northern tip of the county into a forest preserve. However, [[Union Pacific Railroad]] president [[E. H. Harriman]] donated land as well as large sums of money for the purchase of properties in the area of [[Bear Mountain (Hudson Highlands)|Bear Mountain]]. [[Bear Mountain State Park|Bear Mountain]]/[[Harriman State Park (New York)|Harriman State Park]] became a reality in 1910 when Harriman's widow donated his lands to the state, and by 1914 it was estimated that more than a million people a year were coming to the park.  After [[World War I]], Rockland County became the most important sausage making hub in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>[https://italianfoodctr.com/ Italian Food Center (accessed 18 July 2019)]</ref><ref>[https://patch.com/new-york/pearlriver/italian-fest-returns-blauvelt Italian Fest Returns to Blauvelt (accessed 18 July 2019)]</ref><ref>[http://www.hvmag.com/Hudson-Valley-Magazine/Calendar/index.php/name/9th-Annual-Blauvelt-Sons-of-Italy-Italian-Feast-Carnival/event/26440/ 9th Annual Blauvelt Sons of Italy Festival (accessed 18 July 2019)]</ref>\n\nRockland remained semi-rural until the 1950s when the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]], [[Tappan Zee Bridge (1955\u20132017)|Tappan Zee Bridge]], and other major arteries were built. The idea of [[suburbia]] also helped transform the county.

The Supreme Court is the trial level court of the [[New York State Unified Court System]], which presents some confusion as the Supreme Court is the highest [[Appellate court|court of appeals]] in the federal system as well as in most states (the Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York State). The Supreme Court has broad authority over all categories of cases, both civil and criminal. Generally the Supreme Court in Rockland County hears [[Civil law (common law)|civil cases]] involving claims in excess of $25,000. While the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over [[Criminal law|criminal cases]] in most counties this is handled by the County Courts. In Rockland however, the Supreme Court does exercise jurisdiction over some criminal cases.\n\nThe County Court is inferior to the Supreme Court and is authorized to hear criminal cases that have occurred in the county as well as limited jurisdiction over civil cases. The County Court handles [[felony]] cases exclusively and shares jurisdiction with the town and village justice courts on [[misdemeanor]] cases and other minor offenses and violations. The County Court's jurisdiction on civil cases is limited to those involving less than $25,000.\n\nEach of the towns and fifteen of the villages have [[Justice Courts]], which mostly hear routine [[traffic ticket]] cases, especially from the [[New York State Thruway]] and the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]]. They also handle [[drunk driving]] charges, lower-level criminal [[misdemeanor]] matters, and occasionally perform [[arraignment]] on [[felonies]] (most felony proceedings are heard in County Court). These courts generally handle the highest volume of cases.\n\n===National politics===\nLike most of the Hudson Valley, Rockland County historically voted Republican. Between 1892 and 1992, Rockland County only voted Democratic three times\u2013[[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s landslide victory of [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]], [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s landslide victory in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]] (in which it was the only New York City suburb to vote Democratic), and [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s first campaign in [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]]. Rockland shifted Democratic in 1992, and has since only voted Republican once, in [[United States presidential election|2004]] for [[George W. Bush]]. Despite this shift, national elections have remained close in Rockland County as compared to neighboring [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], which has witnessed dependable double-digit Democratic victories since the 1990s.\n{{Hidden begin|titlestyle=background:#ccccff|title=Presidential election results}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential election results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Atlas of US Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=24 October 2018}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

At one point there were twin governments, one on each side of the Ramapo Mountains. For this reason, Rockland split off from Orange in 1798 to form its own county. That same year the county seat was transferred from Tappan to New City, where a new courthouse was built.\n\nHaverstraw was separated from Orangetown in 1719 and became a town in 1788; it included the present-day [[Clarkstown, New York|Clarkstown]], [[Ramapo, New York|Ramapo]] and [[Stony Point, New York|Stony Point]]. Clarkstown and Ramapo became towns in 1791, followed by Stony Point in 1865.\n[[File:Lenapehoking.png|thumb|upright|The territory of the Lenape in present-day southern New York, New Jersey and eastern sections of Delaware and Pennsylvania]]\n\nDuring the [[American Revolution]], when control of the [[Hudson River]] was viewed by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] as strategic to dominating the American territories, Rockland saw [[battle|skirmishes]] at Haverstraw, Nyack and [[Piermont, New York|Piermont]], and significant military engagements at the [[Battle of Stony Point]], where General \"Mad\" [[Anthony Wayne]] earned his nickname. [[George Washington]] had headquarters for a time at John Suffern's tavern, the later site of the village of [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]]. British Major [[John Andr\u00e9]] met with American traitor [[Benedict Arnold]] near Stony Point to buy the plans for the [[fortification]]s at [[West Point, New York|West Point]]. Andr\u00e9 was captured with the plans in [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]] on his way back to the British lines; he was brought to Tappan for trial in the Tappan church, found guilty, hanged and buried nearby. Still another important chapter in the story of the Revolution was written on May 5, 1783, when General Washington received [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Sir Guy Carleton]] at the [[DeWint House]], where they discussed terms of a peace treaty. Two days later Washington visited Sir Guy aboard a British war vessel. On this day the King's Navy fired its first salute to the flag of the United States of America.\n\nIn the decades following the Revolution, Rockland became popular for its stone and bricks. These products, however, required quarrying in land that many later believed should be set aside as a preserve. Many unsuccessful efforts were made to turn much of the [[Hudson Highlands]] on the northern tip of the county into a forest preserve. However, [[Union Pacific Railroad]] president [[E. H. Harriman]] donated land as well as large sums of money for the purchase of properties in the area of [[Bear Mountain (Hudson Highlands)|Bear Mountain]]. [[Bear Mountain State Park|Bear Mountain]]/[[Harriman State Park (New York)|Harriman State Park]] became a reality in 1910 when Harriman's widow donated his lands to the state, and by 1914 it was estimated that more than a million people a year were coming to the park.  After [[World War I]], Rockland County became the most important sausage making hub in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>[https://italianfoodctr.com/ Italian Food Center (accessed 18 July 2019)]</ref><ref>[https://patch.com/new-york/pearlriver/italian-fest-returns-blauvelt Italian Fest Returns to Blauvelt (accessed 18 July 2019)]</ref><ref>[http://www.hvmag.com/Hudson-Valley-Magazine/Calendar/index.php/name/9th-Annual-Blauvelt-Sons-of-Italy-Italian-Feast-Carnival/event/26440/ 9th Annual Blauvelt Sons of Italy Festival (accessed 18 July 2019)]</ref>\n\nRockland remained semi-rural until the 1950s when the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]], [[Tappan Zee Bridge (1955\u20132017)|Tappan Zee Bridge]], and other major arteries were built.

The Supreme Court is the trial level court of the [[New York State Unified Court System]], which presents some confusion as the Supreme Court is the highest [[Appellate court|court of appeals]] in the federal system as well as in most states (the Court of Appeals is the highest court in New York State). The Supreme Court has broad authority over all categories of cases, both civil and criminal. Generally the Supreme Court in Rockland County hears [[Civil law (common law)|civil cases]] involving claims in excess of $25,000. While the Supreme Court has jurisdiction over [[Criminal law|criminal cases]] in most counties this is handled by the County Courts. In Rockland however, the Supreme Court does exercise jurisdiction over some criminal cases.\n\nThe County Court is inferior to the Supreme Court and is authorized to hear criminal cases that have occurred in the county as well as limited jurisdiction over civil cases. The County Court handles [[felony]] cases exclusively and shares jurisdiction with the town and village justice courts on [[misdemeanor]] cases and other minor offenses and violations. The County Court's jurisdiction on civil cases is limited to those involving less than $25,000.\n\nEach of the towns and fifteen of the villages have [[Justice Courts]], which mostly hear routine [[traffic ticket]] cases, especially from the [[New York State Thruway]] and the [[Palisades Interstate Parkway]]. They also handle [[drunk driving]] charges, lower-level criminal [[misdemeanor]] matters, and occasionally perform [[arraignment]] on [[felonies]] (most felony proceedings are heard in County Court). These courts generally handle the highest volume of cases.\n\n===National politics===\nLike most of the Hudson Valley, Rockland County historically voted Republican. Between 1892 and 1992, Rockland County only voted Democratic three times\u2013[[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s landslide victory of [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]], [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s landslide victory in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]] (in which it was the only New York City suburb to vote Democratic), and [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s first campaign in [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]]. Rockland shifted Democratic in 1992, and has since only voted Republican once, in [[United States presidential election|2004]] for [[George W. Bush]]. Despite this shift, national elections have remained close in Rockland County as compared to neighboring [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], which has witnessed dependable double-digit Democratic victories since the 1990s.\n{{Hidden begin|titlestyle=background:#ccccff|title=Presidential election results}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential election results'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Atlas of US Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=24 October 2018}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

The body features extensive use of lightweight materials such as [[aluminium]] and [[carbon fibre]]. Customers could then choose from a number of customized upgrades to the engine/drivetrain, interior, and exterior.\n\n[[File:Fisker Latigo CS-2.jpg|thumb|Rear end]]\n\n==Options==\nFisker offered [http://davecarguy.blogspot.com/2011_11_01_archive.html many choices for the exterior], with custom Fisker colors including Titanium Crystal Metallic, Silver Quartz Metallic, Raptor Red, Ocean Blue Metallic, or White Sands Metallic. The base interior of the BMW was redone with new leather and color options, while retaining the electronics and telematics of the original BMW. The leather interiors could be customized to taste, with much of the work being done by an Italian firm, with colors that included Saddle, Coral Reef, Pebble, Sand, Cotto, Raised Sand, Midnight Black, or white.  If desired by the customer, even the trunk can be fully lined with leather as part of the Custom Trim Package that also included upgraded center console, door liners, and instrument panels. Alcantara was extensively used in both the interior headliner and the trunk.\n\n==Engine==\nCustomers could choose to upgrade the BMW's already potent engine with Fisker's \"Performance Plus\" package, which took the M6 engine from 500 peak HP to over 650 HP. The engine upgrade selected for Fisker Latigo #001 was the top possibility - advertised by Fisker as a 665HP upgrade, it was a $55,000 upgrade whereby the engine was rebuilt and tuned by RD Sport (aka Racing Dynamics) as what they refer to as their 648HP [http://www.racdyn.com/IC_01.cfm?ic=1428558630 \"RS58\" Motor].  Described on their website: ''The V-10 RS58 uses much of the same technology found in the latest F1 motors:  billet crankshaft, billet rods, and a set of forged pistons that are amongst the lightest to ever find their way into a production-based motor. The ported cylinder heads boast 17% more efficiency than the stock ones, and this is mainly obtained through the use of larger valves and modified cam profiles. The RS58 Package comes complete with a full exhaust system, including Race Exhaust Manifolds, Metal  Matrix Sport Catalytic Converters, Sport X-Flow Midpipe and Competition Rear Silencers with Quad Tips.''\n\n==Latigo CS #001==\nThe only customer car ordered was based on a BMW M6.  Based on this [http://davecarguy.blogspot.com/2011_11_01_archive.html original Fisker Purchase Order], the Southern California customer ordered the car with Custom Trim package and upgraded 665HP engine package on March 27, 2007.

In the North the government had created the [[United Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam]], co-opting the clergy to function under government auspices but in the South, the [[Unified Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam]] still held sway and openly challenged the communist government.  The Sangha leadership was thus arrested and imprisoned; Sangha properties were seized and the Sangha itself was outlawed. In its place was the newly created [[Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam]], designed as the final union of all Buddhist organizations, now under full state control.\n\n===Modern period===\nThe treatment of Buddhists started to ease since [[\u0110\u1ed5i m\u1edbi]] in 1986.\n\nSince [[\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi]] (1986) many reforms have allowed Buddhism to be practiced relatively unhindered by the individuals.

Since this time, the North American Vietnamese Buddhist community has grown to some 160 temples and centers.

Although Vietnamese Buddhism does not have a strong centralized structure, the practice is similar throughout the country at almost any temple.\n\nGaining merit is the most common and essential practice in Vietnamese Buddhism with a belief that liberation takes place with the help of Buddhas and bodhisattvas. Buddhist monks commonly chant sutras, recite Buddhas\u2019 names (particularly [[Amit\u0101bha]]), doing repentance and praying for rebirth in the Pure Land.<ref>Cuong Tu Nguyen & A. W.

None of these theories reflects realities in Vietnam (or China) past or present.

A pure land is a Buddha-realm where one can more easily attain enlightenment since suffering does not exist there.\n\nMany religious organizations have not been recognized by the government; however, in 2007, with 1.5 million followers, the Vietnamese Pure Land Buddhism Association (T\u1ecbnh \u0110\u1ed9 C\u01b0 S\u0129 Ph\u1eadt H\u1ed9i Vi\u1ec7t Nam) received official recognition as an independent and legal religious organization.<ref name=\"vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn\" />\n\nThi\u1ec1n is the [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations|Sino-Xenic pronunciation]] of ''Chan'' (Japanese ''Zen'') and is derived ultimately from [[Sanskrit]] \"[[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|dhy\u0101na]]\". The traditional account is that in 580, an Indian monk named Vinitaruci ({{lang-vi|T\u00ec-ni-\u0111a-l\u01b0u-chi}}) traveled to Vietnam after completing his studies with [[Sengcan]], the third patriarch of Chan Buddhism. This would be the first appearance of Thi\u1ec1n. The sect that Vinitaruci and his lone Vietnamese disciple founded would become known as the oldest branch of Thi\u1ec1n. After a period of obscurity, the Vinitaruci School became one of the most influential Buddhist groups in Vietnam by the 10th century, particularly under the patriarch [[V\u1ea1n-H\u1ea1nh]] (died 1018). Other early Vietnamese Zen schools included the V\u00f4 Ng\u00f4n Th\u00f4ng, which was associated with the teaching of [[Mazu Daoyi]], and the Th\u1ea3o \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng, which incorporated [[nianfo]] chanting techniques; both were founded by Chinese monks.\n\nA new Thi\u1ec1n school was founded by King [[Tr\u1ea7n Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng]] (1258\u20131308); called the [[Tr\u00fac L\u00e2m]] \"Bamboo Grove\" school, it evinced a deep influence from [[Confucianism|Confucian]] and [[Taoism|Taoist]] philosophy. Nevertheless, Tr\u00fac L\u00e2m's prestige waned over the following centuries as Confucianism became dominant in the royal court. In the 17th century, a group of Chinese monks led by Nguy\u00ean Thi\u1ec1u introduced the Ling school (L\u00e2m T\u1ebf). A more native offshoot of L\u00e2m T\u1ebf, the Li\u1ec5u Qu\u00e1n school, was founded in the 18th century and has since been the predominant branch of Vietnamese Zen.\n\n[[File:Vietnamese Buddhist temple main altar.jpg|thumb|This is the main altar of a Vietnamese Buddhist temple near [[Seattle]].

[[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]] annexed the land occupied by the Cham during conquests in the 15th century and by the 18th century had also annexed the southern portion of the [[Khmer Empire]], resulting in the current borders of Vietnam. From that time onward, the dominant \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t (Vietnamese) followed the Mahayana tradition while the Khmer continued to practice Theravada.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, there were a number of movements in Vietnam for the revival and modernization of Buddhist activities. Together with the re-organization of Mahayana establishments, there developed a growing interest in Theravadin meditation as well as the [[P\u0101li Canon]]. These were then available in French. Among the pioneers who brought Theravada Buddhism to the ethnic \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t was a young veterinary doctor named L\u00ea V\u0103n Gi\u1ea3ng. He was born in the South, received higher education in Hanoi, and after graduation, was sent to Phnom Penh, Cambodia, to work for the French government.\n\nDuring that time he became especially interested in Theravada Buddhist practice. Subsequently, he decided to ordain and took the Dhamma name of H\u1ed9-T\u00f4ng (Vansarakkhita). In 1940, upon an invitation from a group of lay Buddhists led by Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Hi\u1ec3u, he went back to Vietnam in order to help establish the first Theravada temple for Vietnamese Buddhists at G\u00f2 D\u01b0a, Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ee9c (now a district of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City). The temple was named B\u1eedu Quang (Ratana Ramsyarama). The temple was destroyed by French troops in 1947, and was later rebuilt in 1951. At B\u1eedu Quang temple, together with a group of Vietnamese [[bhikkhu]]s who had received training in Cambodia such as Thi\u1ec7n Lu\u1eadt, B\u1eedu Ch\u01a1n, Kim Quang and Gi\u1edbi Nghi\u00eam, H\u1ed9 T\u00f4ng began teaching Buddhism in their native Vietnamese. He also translated many Buddhist materials from the Pali Canon, and Theravada became part of Vietnamese Buddhist activity in the country.\n\nIn 1949\u20131950, H\u1ed9 T\u00f4ng together with Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Hi\u1ec3u and supporters built a new temple in Saigon (now H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City), named K\u1ef3 Vi\u00ean T\u1ef1 (''Jetavana Vihara''). This temple became the centre of Theravada activities in Vietnam, which continued to attract increasing interest among the Vietnamese Buddhists. In 1957, the Vietnamese Theravada Buddhist Sangha Congregation (Gi\u00e1o H\u1ed9i T\u0103ng Gi\u00e0 Nguy\u00ean Th\u1ee7y Vi\u1ec7t Nam) was formally established and recognised by the government, and the Theravada Sangha elected Venerable H\u1ed9 T\u00f4ng as its first President, or Sangharaja.\n\nFrom Saigon, the Theravada movement spread to other provinces, and soon, a number of Theravada temples for ethnic Viet Buddhists were established in many areas in the South and Central parts of Vietnam. There are 529 Theravada temples throughout the country, of which 19 were located in H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City and its vicinity. Besides B\u1eedu Quang and K\u1ef3 Vi\u00ean temples, other well known temples are B\u1eedu Long, Gi\u00e1c Quang, Tam B\u1ea3o ([[\u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng]]), Thi\u1ec1n L\u00e2m and Huy\u1ec1n Kh\u00f4ng ([[Hu\u1ebf]]), and the large [[Th\u00edch Ca Ph\u1eadt \u0110\u00e0i]] in [[V\u0169ng T\u00e0u]].<ref>http://dr.lib.sjp.ac.lk/bitstream/123456789/1677/1/Therav%C4%81da%20Buddhism%20in%20Vietnam.pdf</ref>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"font-size:88%; line-height:130%; border-bottom:1px #aaa solid;\" heights=\"230\">\nLascar One Pillar Pagoda (4550966464).jpg|The [[One Pillar Pagoda]] is a historic Mahayana Buddhist temple in [[Hanoi]], the capital of Vietnam.\nChuaBaiDinh.jpg|[[B\u00e1i \u0110\u00ednh Temple]] is a complex of Mahayana Buddhist temples on Bai Dinh Mountain.\nNha Trang-Pagode.JPG|H\u1ea3i \u0110\u1ee9c Buddha, the 30&nbsp;ft tall statue built in 1964 at [[Long S\u01a1n Pagoda]] in [[Nha Trang]].\nNational Museum Vietnamese History 47 (cropped).jpg|Ceramic pagoda with lotus, bodhi leaf, dancer decoration, Hanoi (L\u00fd dynasty, 11th-13th century).\nNational Museum Vietnamese History 37 (cropped).jpg|Terracotta Bodhi leaves with dragon motif (L\u00fd-Tr\u1ea7n dynasties, 11th-14th century).\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Vietnam|Religion}}\n*[[Tr\u00fac L\u00e2m]]\n*[[Dharma transmission]]\n*[[Buddhist temples in Hu\u1ebf]]\n*[[Index of Buddhism-related articles]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n* Nguyen, Cuong Tu & A.

Luy L\u00e2u was the capital of the Han region of [[Jiaozhi]] and was a popular place visited by many Indian Buddhist missionary monks en route to China. The monks followed the maritime trade route from the Indian sub-continent to China used by Indian traders. A number of [[Mahayana sutras]] and the [[\u0100gama (Buddhism)|\u0101gamas]] were translated into [[Classical Chinese]] there, including the ''[[Sutra of Forty-two Chapters]]'' and the ''[[Anapanasati]]''.\n\nJiaozhi was the birthplace of Buddhist missionary [[Kang Senghui]] who was of Sogdian origin.<ref name=\"Nguyen2008\">{{cite book|author=Tai Thu Nguyen|title=The History of Buddhism in Vietnam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tUN8tC0ftJcC&pg=PA36#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=2008|publisher=CRVP|isbn=978-1-56518-098-7|pages=36\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Nguyen\">{{cite book|author=Tai Thu Nguyen|title=The History of Buddhism in Vietnam|url=https://www.academia.edu/10344614/Buddhism_in_Vietnam|year=2008|publisher=CRVP|isbn=978-1-56518-098-7|pages=36\u2013|access-date=2017-12-04|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150131221525/http://www.academia.edu/10344614/Buddhism_in_Vietnam|archive-date=2015-01-31|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOver the next eighteen centuries, Vietnam and China shared many common features of cultural, philosophical and religious heritage. This was due to geographical proximity to one another and Vietnam being annexed twice by China. Vietnamese Buddhism is thus related to [[Chinese Buddhism]] in general, and to some extent reflects the formation of Chinese Buddhism after the [[Song dynasty]].<ref name=\"Prebish, Charles 1998. p. 134\">Prebish, Charles.

The growth of Buddhism during this time is attributed to the recruitment of erudite monks to the court as the newly independent state needed an ideological basis on which to build a country. Subsequently, this role was ceded to Confucianism.<ref>Nguyen Tai Thu 2008, pg 75.</ref>\n\nVietnamese Buddhism reached its zenith during the [[L\u00fd dynasty]] (1009\u20131225) beginning with the founder [[L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5]], who was raised in a [[pagoda]].<ref>Nguyen Tai Tu Nguyen 2008, pg 89.</ref> All of the kings during the L\u00fd dynasty professed and sanctioned Buddhism as the state religion. This endured with the [[Tr\u1ea7n dynasty]] (1225\u20131400) but Buddhism had to share the stage with the emerging growth of [[Confucianism]].\n\nBy the 15th century, Buddhism fell out of favor with the court during the Later L\u00ea dynasty, although still popular with the masses. Officials like [[L\u00ea Qu\u00e1t]] attacked it as heretical and wasteful.<ref>''Vi\u1ec7t Nam: Borderless Histories'' \u2013 Page 67 Nhung Tuyet Tran, Anthony Reid \u2013 2006 \"In this first formal attack in 1370, a Confucian official named L\u00ea Qu\u00e1t attempted, without much success, to brand Buddhism as heretical and to promote Confucianism.

Leaders of the Church like [[Th\u00edch Tr\u00ed Quang]] had considerable sway in national politics, at times challenging the government.\n\nWith the [[fall of Saigon]] in 1975, the whole nation came under [[Communist]] rule; many religious practices including Buddhism were discouraged. In the North the government had created the [[United Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam]], co-opting the clergy to function under government auspices but in the South, the [[Unified Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam]] still held sway and openly challenged the communist government.  The Sangha leadership was thus arrested and imprisoned; Sangha properties were seized and the Sangha itself was outlawed. In its place was the newly created [[Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam]], designed as the final union of all Buddhist organizations, now under full state control.\n\n===Modern period===\nThe treatment of Buddhists started to ease since [[\u0110\u1ed5i m\u1edbi]] in 1986.\n\nSince [[\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi]] (1986) many reforms have allowed Buddhism to be practiced relatively unhindered by the individuals. However no organized sangha is allowed to function independent of the state.

Since this time, the North American Vietnamese Buddhist community has grown to some 160 temples and centers. Proselytizing is not a priority.\n\nThe most famous practitioner of synchronized [[Vietnamese Thi\u1ec1n]] in the West is [[Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh]] who has authored dozens of books and founded the [[Plum Village Monastery]] in France together with his colleague, [[bhikkhuni|bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012b]] and Zen Master [[Ch\u00e2n Kh\u00f4ng]]. According to Nguyen and Barber, Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh's fame in the Western world as a proponent of engaged Buddhism and a new Thi\u1ec1n style has \"no affinity with or any foundation in traditional Vietnamese Buddhist practices\" <ref>Cuong Tu Nguyen & A.

Although Vietnamese Buddhism does not have a strong centralized structure, the practice is similar throughout the country at almost any temple.\n\nGaining merit is the most common and essential practice in Vietnamese Buddhism with a belief that liberation takes place with the help of Buddhas and bodhisattvas. Buddhist monks commonly chant sutras, recite Buddhas\u2019 names (particularly [[Amit\u0101bha]]), doing repentance and praying for rebirth in the Pure Land.<ref>Cuong Tu Nguyen & A. W.

None of these theories reflects realities in Vietnam (or China) past or present.

A pure land is a Buddha-realm where one can more easily attain enlightenment since suffering does not exist there.\n\nMany religious organizations have not been recognized by the government; however, in 2007, with 1.5 million followers, the Vietnamese Pure Land Buddhism Association (T\u1ecbnh \u0110\u1ed9 C\u01b0 S\u0129 Ph\u1eadt H\u1ed9i Vi\u1ec7t Nam) received official recognition as an independent and legal religious organization.<ref name=\"vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn\" />\n\nThi\u1ec1n is the [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations|Sino-Xenic pronunciation]] of ''Chan'' (Japanese ''Zen'') and is derived ultimately from [[Sanskrit]] \"[[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|dhy\u0101na]]\". The traditional account is that in 580, an Indian monk named Vinitaruci ({{lang-vi|T\u00ec-ni-\u0111a-l\u01b0u-chi}}) traveled to Vietnam after completing his studies with [[Sengcan]], the third patriarch of Chan Buddhism. This would be the first appearance of Thi\u1ec1n. The sect that Vinitaruci and his lone Vietnamese disciple founded would become known as the oldest branch of Thi\u1ec1n. After a period of obscurity, the Vinitaruci School became one of the most influential Buddhist groups in Vietnam by the 10th century, particularly under the patriarch [[V\u1ea1n-H\u1ea1nh]] (died 1018). Other early Vietnamese Zen schools included the V\u00f4 Ng\u00f4n Th\u00f4ng, which was associated with the teaching of [[Mazu Daoyi]], and the Th\u1ea3o \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng, which incorporated [[nianfo]] chanting techniques; both were founded by Chinese monks.\n\nA new Thi\u1ec1n school was founded by King [[Tr\u1ea7n Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng]] (1258\u20131308); called the [[Tr\u00fac L\u00e2m]] \"Bamboo Grove\" school, it evinced a deep influence from [[Confucianism|Confucian]] and [[Taoism|Taoist]] philosophy. Nevertheless, Tr\u00fac L\u00e2m's prestige waned over the following centuries as Confucianism became dominant in the royal court. In the 17th century, a group of Chinese monks led by Nguy\u00ean Thi\u1ec1u introduced the Ling school (L\u00e2m T\u1ebf). A more native offshoot of L\u00e2m T\u1ebf, the Li\u1ec5u Qu\u00e1n school, was founded in the 18th century and has since been the predominant branch of Vietnamese Zen.\n\n[[File:Vietnamese Buddhist temple main altar.jpg|thumb|This is the main altar of a Vietnamese Buddhist temple near [[Seattle]].

[[\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]] annexed the land occupied by the Cham during conquests in the 15th century and by the 18th century had also annexed the southern portion of the [[Khmer Empire]], resulting in the current borders of Vietnam. From that time onward, the dominant \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t (Vietnamese) followed the Mahayana tradition while the Khmer continued to practice Theravada.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, there were a number of movements in Vietnam for the revival and modernization of Buddhist activities. Together with the re-organization of Mahayana establishments, there developed a growing interest in Theravadin meditation as well as the [[P\u0101li Canon]]. These were then available in French. Among the pioneers who brought Theravada Buddhism to the ethnic \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t was a young veterinary doctor named L\u00ea V\u0103n Gi\u1ea3ng. He was born in the South, received higher education in Hanoi, and after graduation, was sent to Phnom Penh, Cambodia, to work for the French government.\n\nDuring that time he became especially interested in Theravada Buddhist practice. Subsequently, he decided to ordain and took the Dhamma name of H\u1ed9-T\u00f4ng (Vansarakkhita). In 1940, upon an invitation from a group of lay Buddhists led by Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Hi\u1ec3u, he went back to Vietnam in order to help establish the first Theravada temple for Vietnamese Buddhists at G\u00f2 D\u01b0a, Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ee9c (now a district of H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City). The temple was named B\u1eedu Quang (Ratana Ramsyarama). The temple was destroyed by French troops in 1947, and was later rebuilt in 1951. At B\u1eedu Quang temple, together with a group of Vietnamese [[bhikkhu]]s who had received training in Cambodia such as Thi\u1ec7n Lu\u1eadt, B\u1eedu Ch\u01a1n, Kim Quang and Gi\u1edbi Nghi\u00eam, H\u1ed9 T\u00f4ng began teaching Buddhism in their native Vietnamese. He also translated many Buddhist materials from the Pali Canon, and Theravada became part of Vietnamese Buddhist activity in the country.\n\nIn 1949\u20131950, H\u1ed9 T\u00f4ng together with Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Hi\u1ec3u and supporters built a new temple in Saigon (now H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City), named K\u1ef3 Vi\u00ean T\u1ef1 (''Jetavana Vihara''). This temple became the centre of Theravada activities in Vietnam, which continued to attract increasing interest among the Vietnamese Buddhists. In 1957, the Vietnamese Theravada Buddhist Sangha Congregation (Gi\u00e1o H\u1ed9i T\u0103ng Gi\u00e0 Nguy\u00ean Th\u1ee7y Vi\u1ec7t Nam) was formally established and recognised by the government, and the Theravada Sangha elected Venerable H\u1ed9 T\u00f4ng as its first President, or Sangharaja.\n\nFrom Saigon, the Theravada movement spread to other provinces, and soon, a number of Theravada temples for ethnic Viet Buddhists were established in many areas in the South and Central parts of Vietnam. There are 529 Theravada temples throughout the country, of which 19 were located in H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City and its vicinity. Besides B\u1eedu Quang and K\u1ef3 Vi\u00ean temples, other well known temples are B\u1eedu Long, Gi\u00e1c Quang, Tam B\u1ea3o ([[\u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng]]), Thi\u1ec1n L\u00e2m and Huy\u1ec1n Kh\u00f4ng ([[Hu\u1ebf]]), and the large [[Th\u00edch Ca Ph\u1eadt \u0110\u00e0i]] in [[V\u0169ng T\u00e0u]].<ref>http://dr.lib.sjp.ac.lk/bitstream/123456789/1677/1/Therav%C4%81da%20Buddhism%20in%20Vietnam.pdf</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Vietnam|Religion}}\n*[[Tr\u00fac L\u00e2m]]\n*[[Dharma transmission]]\n*[[Buddhist temples in Hu\u1ebf]]\n*[[Index of Buddhism-related articles]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n* Nguyen, Cuong Tu & A.

There are three story arcs in the series. For the first five main games, the framing story is set in 2012 and features series protagonist [[Desmond Miles]] who uses a machine called the Animus and relives the memories of his ancestors to find a way to avert the [[2012 phenomenon|2012 apocalypse]]. In games up until and including ''[[Assassin's Creed Syndicate]]'', Abstergo employees and Assassin initiates recorded genetic memories using the Helix software, helping the Templars and Assassins find new Pieces of Eden in the modern world. The latest two games, ''[[Assassin's Creed Origins]]'' and ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]'' follow ex-Abstergo employee Layla Hassan as she is recruited into the Assassin Order.\n\nMain games of ''Assassin's Creed'' are set in an [[open world]] and presented from the [[third-person perspective]] where the protagonists take down targets using their combat and stealth skills with the exploitation of the environment. Players have freedom to explore the historical settings as they finish main and side quests. Apart from single-player missions, some games also provide competitive and cooperative multiplayer gameplay. While main games are produced for major consoles and desktop platforms, multiple spin-off games are released for consoles, mobiles, and handhelds platforms.\n\nThe main games in the ''Assassin's Creed'' video game series have received generally positive reviews for their ambition in visuals, game design, and narratives, with criticism towards the yearly release cycle and frequent bugs. The spin-off games received mixed to positive reviews. The video game series has received multiple awards and nominations, including Game of the Year awards. It is commercially successful, selling over 140 million copies {{as of|2019|9|lc=y}}, becoming Ubisoft's best-selling franchise and one of the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|highest selling video game franchises of all time]]. ''Assassin's Creed'' was adapted into a [[Assassin's Creed (film)|film]], which received negative reviews. A series of art books, encyclopedias, comics, novelizations, and [[Assassin's Creed (book series)|novels]] have been published.

It included a number of [[parkour]] moves and combat. ''The Sands of Time'' was a critical and financial success, leading publisher Ubisoft to request Ubisoft Montreal to develop a sequel, aiming for the [[seventh generation of video game consoles|next console generation]]. The Ubisoft Montreal team decided on taking the gameplay from ''The Sands of Time'' into an [[open world]] approach, taking advantage of the improved processing power to render larger spaces and crowds. Narratively, the team wanted to move away from the Prince being someone next in line for the throne but to have to work for it; combined with research into secret societies led them to focus on the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], heavily borrowing from the novel ''[[Alamut (Bartol novel)|Alamut]]''.<ref name=\"polygon oral\">{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/features/2018/10/3/17924770/assassins-creed-an-oral-history-patrice-desilets | title=  Assassin's Creed: An oral history | first = Richard | last = Moss | date = October 3, 2018 | accessdate = October 3, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>\n\nThey developed a narrative where the player would control an Assassin that served as a bodyguard for a non-playable Prince, leading them to call this game ''Prince of Persia: Assassin''. Ubisoft was not happy with a ''Prince of Persia'' game without the Prince as the playable character, but this led to the marketing division to suggest the name ''Assassin's Creed'', playing off the creed of the Assassins, \"nothing is true; everything is permitted\". Ubisoft Montreal ran with this in creating a new [[intellectual property]], eliminating the Prince and creating the conflict between the Assassins and [[Templar Knights]]. Further, in postulating what other assassinations they could account for throughout human history, they came onto the idea of [[genetic memory (psychology)|genetic memory]] and created the \"Animus\" device and modern storyline elements, which further allowed them to explain certain facets of gameplay, such as accounting when the player fails a mission, in the same way they had done in ''The Sands of Time''.<ref name=\"polygon oral\"/>\n\nFollowing release of the first ''Assassin's Creed'' in 2007, Ubisoft Montreal and other Ubisoft studios use the series to present games from various historical periods, striving for historical accuracy while conceding some elements for gameplay.<ref name=\"polygon oral\"/>\n\n==Premise==\n[[File:Abstergo 2.png|thumb|''- \"We change the world. Every day, in a hundred different ways.\"'' -<br />The fictional slogan and logo of [[Abstergo Industries]] from the ''Assassin's Creed'' franchise]]\nThe ''Assassin's Creed'' games primarily revolve around the rivalry and conflict between two ancient secret societies \u2014 the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], who represent freedom, and the [[Knights Templar]], who represent order; as well as their indirect relation to an [[Ancient astronauts|ancient species pre-dating humanity]], referred to within the games as \"those who came before\" or \"precursors\", who were technologically advanced and claimed to be the creators of humanity, before their society and much of Earth's biosphere were destroyed by a massive [[Coronal mass ejection|solar storm]] thousands of years before the games. The games' are split between various real-world settings in different chronological periods - the present, modern day era, and various historical settings, the latter including a variety of historical characters given fictionalized involvement in the conflict between the two secret societies.\n\nThe main premise focuses on the efforts of the Assassins in stopping the Knights Templars from finding and securing various artifacts of the ancient species, known as \"Pieces of Eden\", which hold great power and are capable of controlling [[free will]]. In the modern era, the Assassins, also known as \"The Brotherhood\", focus on combating the Templars, who evolved with the world and developed into a [[mega-corporation]] [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] with multiple branches called Abstergo Industries. To help trace Pieces of Eden to locations in the modern-era world, Abstergo secretly develops a device called the \"Animus\" - a computerized system that can allow one to \"re-live\" and experience the memories of previous people through remnants of their genetic material. Initially only capable of allowing a person to explore the memories of their genetic ancestors, later improvements to the Animus allow virtually anyone to experience the lives of any person used in the device. Overexposure to the animus causes the \"bleeding effect\", which results in giving the user skills and abilities of his ancestors, but is also dangerous for the user as it can damage their mind, causing symptoms such as [[dementia]], [[insanity]], [[dissociative identity disorder]] or [[brain damage]].\n\nThe initial story arc of the games focuses on the efforts of the Brotherhood to thwart Abstergo's plans to secure a Piece of Eden and ultimately to uncover a method to prevent the world being destroyed by another solar storm in 2012, while several titles after this focus on the efforts of each side to cause problems for their opponent in their continuing conflict. The release of ''Origins'' introduced a new story arc focused on a researcher who becomes involved in searching out memories of ancient assassins, and becoming involved in seeking the means to prevent either society gaining the upper-hand over the other.\n\n===Protagonists===\n{{main|List of Assassin's Creed characters}}\n[[Desmond Miles]] is a bartender who is a descendant of several lines of prominent [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]]; though raised as an Assassin, he left his nomadic family to seek out a more common lifestyle. He is initially kidnapped by Abstergo, which is aware of his ancestral lineage. Desmond is forced into the Animus and is revealed to be subject 17; many of the sixteen previous subjects died as a result of Animus over-exposure.\n\nDesmond is later rescued by a small team of modern-day Assassins and agrees to work with them, continuing to experience the memories of his ancestors to discover the locations of additional Pieces of Eden so they can be recovered before Abstergo can do so. From the bleeding effect, Desmond gains some of the Assassin skills of his predecessors at the cost of living with multiple sets of memories and personalities in his mind.\n\nWithin the Animus, Desmond explores the memories of a number of Assassins, including [[Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad]], an initially disgraced Assassin working to redeem himself during the [[Third Crusade]]; [[Ezio Auditore da Firenze]], an Assassin in Italy during the late 15th and early 16th centuries of the [[Italian Renaissance]]; and [[Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton]], otherwise known as Connor, a half-[[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], half-[[British people|British]] Assassin during the [[American Revolution]].\n\nThroughout these events, Desmond learns of allusions to the prophetic [[2012 phenomenon|end of the world in 2012]] from a former Animus test subject, Subject 16; the event turns out to be a repeat of the disaster which wiped out the ancient civilization, and he finds out that his memories hold the key to Earth's surviving a second solar storm. During his experiences, Desmond is aided by holographic projections of three of the ancient race's rulers: Jupiter, Minerva, and Juno.\n\nAfter Desmond dies to ensure Earth's survival, his memories, which have survived through genetic samples of his DNA,<ref name=\"GI preview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/assassins_creed_iv_black_flag/b/playstation4/archive/2013/03/04/assassin-39-s-creed-iv-black-flag-preview.aspx|title=Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag|last=Vore|first=Bryan|publisher=Gameinformer.com|date=March 4, 2013|accessdate=March 4, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306035746/http://www.gameinformer.com/games/assassins_creed_iv_black_flag/b/playstation4/archive/2013/03/04/assassin-39-s-creed-iv-black-flag-preview.aspx|archivedate=March 6, 2013}}</ref> are accessed by Abstergo, which hires a new subject to enter the Animus.

This provides a means of a diegetic interface, showing Desmond's ancestor's health, equipment, goals, and other features as part of the Animus interface. The Animus is based on the player controlling the assassin to maintain the synchronization between Desmond and his ancestor's memories. Performing actions that go against the Assassin's way or dying breaks the synchronization, effectively requiring the player to restart at a previous checkpoint. Furthermore, the player cannot explore outside areas that the assassin has not experienced yet. There are also abnormalities within the Animus from previous users of the device.\n\nWhile playing as the Assassin characters, the games are generally presented from a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]] in an [[open world]] environment, focusing on [[Stealth game|stealth]] and [[parkour]]. The games use a mission structure to follow the main story, generally assigning the player to complete an assassination of public figureheads or a covert mission. Alternatively, several side missions are available, such as mapping out the expansive cities from a high perch followed by performing a \"leap of faith\" into a haystack below, collecting treasures hidden across the cities, exploring ruins for relics, building a brotherhood of assassins to perform other tasks, or funding the rebuilding of a city through purchasing and upgrading of shops and other features. At times, the player is in direct control of Desmond, who by nature of the Animus use has learned Assassin techniques through the bleeding effect, as well as their genetic ability of Eagle Vision, which separates friend, foe and assassination targets by illuminating people in different colors. Through the Animus interface, the player can go back to retry any past mission already completed; for example, in ''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'', the player achieves better synchronization results by performing the mission in a specific manner such as by only killing the mission's target.\n\nThe games use the concept of \"active\" versus \"passive\" moves, with \"active\" moves, such as running, climbing the sides of buildings, or jumping between rooftops, more likely to alert the attention of nearby guards. When the guards become alerted, the player must either fight them or break their line of sight and locate a hiding place, such as a haystack or a well, and wait until the guards' alert is reduced. The combat system allows for a number of unique weapons, armor, and moves, including the use of a hidden blade set in a bracer on the Assassin's arm, and which also can be used to quietly assassinate targets.\n\n==Release history==\nThe following table lists the games created for the franchise and the respective platform(s) they released upon:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!Title\n!Released\n!Platform\n!Other\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]]''\n|2007\n|[[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed: Alta\u00efr's Chronicles]]''\n|2008\n|[[Nintendo DS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], [[Symbian]], [[webOS]], [[Windows Phone]]\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines]]''\n|rowspan=\"3\"|2009\n|[[PlayStation Portable]]\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed II]]''\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], [[OS X]], Windows, Symbian\n|[[OnLive]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed II: Discovery]]''\n|Nintendo DS, iOS\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood]]''\n|2010\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, OS X, Windows\n|rowspan=\"2\"|OnLive\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed: Revelations]]''\n|2011\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, Android, Symbian\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed III]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2012\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, [[Wii U]], PlayStation 4, Xbox One, [[Nintendo Switch]], [[Symbian]]\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed III: Liberation]]''<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"Liberation HD\">Released under the title ''Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD'' for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.</ref>\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, [[PlayStation Vita]]\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2013\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, Nintendo Switch\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed: Pirates]]''\n|Windows,<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"Pirates\">Available for Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 from the Microsoft store.</ref> Android, iOS\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed: Freedom Cry]]''<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"FreedomCry\">Originally released as DLC for all versions of ''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag''.</ref>\n|rowspan=\"4\"|2014\n|PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Windows\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Rogue]]''\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Windows\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Identity]]''\n|Android, iOS\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Unity]]''\n|PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Chronicles|Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China]]''<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"ChroniclesChina\">Originally announced as part of the season pass for ''Assassin's Creed Unity''.</ref>\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2015\n|PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, PlayStation Vita<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"PSVita\">Released as a compilation titled ''Assassin's Creed Chronicles Trilogy Pack''.</ref>\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Syndicate]]''\n|PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Chronicles|Assassin's Creed Chronicles: India]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2016\n|rowspan=\"2\"|PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, PlayStation Vita<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"PSVita\"/>\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Chronicles|Assassin's Creed Chronicles: Russia]]''\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Origins]]''\n|2017\n|rowspan=\"2\"|PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2018\n|[[Google Stadia|Stadia]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed#Assassin's Creed Rebellion|Assassin's Creed Rebellion]]''\n|Android, iOS\n|\u2014\n|}\n\n; Notes\n<references group=\"lower-alpha\" />\n\n===Main series===\n\n====''Assassin's Creed''====\n{{main|Assassin's Creed (video game)}}\nDesmond Miles is captured by Abstergo and forced to use a machine called the Animus to explore Alta\u00efr ibn-La'Ahad's memories during the time of the [[Third Crusade]]. Desmond begins to witness events after Alta\u00efr breaks all three tenets of the Assassin Brotherhood while attempting to stop [[Robert IV de Sabl\u00e9|Robert de Sabl\u00e9]] from taking a Piece of Eden. [[Al Mualim]], the Brotherhood's leader, demotes Alta\u00efr to Novice and tasks him with assassinating the nine Knights Templars, including de Sabl\u00e9, to regain his former status. Alta\u00efr's quest eventually leads him to face de Sabl\u00e9 in the presence of King [[Richard I of England]] warning the King of de Sabl\u00e9's plot to kill him. Alta\u00efr defeats de Sabl\u00e9, but with his last words, de Sabl\u00e9 reveals that there were ten Templars, the last being Al Mualim, who now holds the Piece of Eden. Alta\u00efr returns to face Al Mualim and struggles to fight through illusions created by the Piece, but eventually kills Al Mualim. When Alta\u00efr recovers the piece, he and those watching the Animus view a holographic map showing where other artifacts are located across the globe. Desmond is pulled from the Animus, and was going to be killed, but his life is spared by [[Lucy Stillman]], an Assassin working as a mole within Abstergo, as she claims they might need to further examine his memories later. He comes to learn that a former test subject had left messages only Desmond can see, foretelling the end of the world in 2012.\n\nThe first ''Assassin's Creed'' introduced core elements that remained  in the rest of the game series. The game creates fictionalized, historical versions of [[Masyaf]] (the Brotherhood's location), [[Jerusalem]], [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and [[Damascus]], and incorporates a number of documented historical figures into the story. Other core elements include the virtualized Animus system, free running, climbing, stealth, [[parkour]], and the initial formulation of the combat system. The game requires the player to complete a number of side quests before they are able to obtain an assassin quest from a local Brotherhood guidemaster in each city, but this side quest prerequisite was abandoned in future games.\n\n====''Assassin's Creed II''====\n{{main|Assassin's Creed II}}\nLucy returns and breaks Desmond out of Abstergo, taking him to an Assassin safehouse to work alongside Shaun, a historian, and Rebecca, their technical support. Using an improved version of the Animus, Desmond takes witness to Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young nobleman from the late 15th century in [[Florence]], shortly before the execution of Ezio's father and brothers by order of a corrupt official working for the Templars. He, his mother, and sister take to hiding at the Monteriggioni villa owned by his uncle Mario, who helps to train Ezio in the ways of an Assassin. Ezio and Mario discover that Rodrigo Borgia is the figurehead of a number of Templars all who were accomplices in the execution of his family, and with help of allies like [[Leonardo da Vinci]], methodically assassinate the lower-ranked Templars, while learning that Borgia has acquired a Piece of Eden called the Apple. Eventually, Ezio corners Borgia, who hands over the Piece and flees; Ezio is inducted into the ranks of the Brotherhood and believed to be a prophet based on their codex. A decade later, the Brotherhood learns that Borgia has since become [[Pope Alexander VI]], using the Church's influence to strengthen the Templars. Ezio invades [[Vatican City]] and confronts Borgia, discovering that the Papal staff is also a Piece of Eden. Defeating Borgia but sparing his life, Ezio uses both the Apple and the Papal staff to reveal a chamber of ancient technology. Inside, he is addressed by a hologram of a humanoid female that calls herself Minerva who speaks directly to Desmond through Ezio. Minerva explains how her society had pre-dated humanity's, but a great disaster nearly wiped them out, and warns that another event is due to occur soon, putting the fate of humanity in Desmond's hands. Upon this discovery, Desmond and his allies find the safehouse has been compromised by Abstergo and flee.\n\nSimilar to the first game, ''Assassin's Creed II'' takes place in historical recreations of [[Venice]], [[Florence]], [[Forl\u00ec]], [[San Gimignano]], and the [[Tuscany|Tuscan countryside]], and incorporates events during that period as part of the story. Missions are divided into main story missions, themselves divided into memory sequences reflecting points in Ezio's life, and side missions which can be accomplished at any time; this approach to mission structure remains consistent in the other games in the series. The Monteriggioni villa provides several functions which can be expanded on by paying money for upgrades of surrounding buildings, or by purchasing artwork, weapons, and armor for the villa; in turn, the villa will generate wealth for the player at a rate influenced by the upgrades and acquisition of these items. Additional quests involve locating secret Assassin seals, and finding hidden marks left by \"Subject 16\", a former Animus user, that hint at the nature of Minerva's society.\n\n====''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood''====\n{{main|Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood}}\nDesmond and his allies retreat to the ruins of the Monteriggioni villa, and Desmond reenters the Animus to continue Ezio's memories, specifically to identify the location of the Apple. After facing Rodrigo Borgia, Ezio returned to Monteriggioni, but the villa is soon attacked by forces under the command of [[Cesare Borgia]], Rodrigo's son. Mario is killed and the Apple is stolen. Ezio vows revenge by helping to free the people of Rome from the Borgia family. As Ezio works covertly to turn the city against the Borgias, he gains followers that want to join his cause, and Ezio trains them in the way of the Assassins. In an attempt to assassinate Cesare and Rodrigo at the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], Ezio instead witnesses Cesare forcing his father to eat a poisoned apple that Rodrigo had prepared to kill his son. Ezio chases down Cesare and eventually captures him and recovers the Apple. Cesare is taken to prison in Viana, Spain but manages to escape with help of his allies. The Assassins lead the fight against Cesare and the remaining loyal Borgia troops, and eventually Ezio throws Cesare from the castle walls, killing him. With no perceived further threats, Ezio takes to hide the Apple under the [[Colosseum]]. In the present, Desmond is able to navigate through the underground chambers beneath the Colosseum to locate the Apple. As he picks it up, Desmond is witness to another hologram figure, calling herself Juno, and who controls Desmond to stab Lucy (because Lucy has defected to the Templars) before he falls into a coma.\n\n''Brotherhood'' shares many of the same features as the previous game though it takes place primarily in Rome. Similar to the villa, the player is able to spend money to buy and upgrade shops and other facilities throughout the city as to increase revenue they can collect from it; however, the player will be required to destroy Borgia towers that control various sections of the city before they can do so.  The Brotherhood of Assassins is introduced, by which, after saving citizens from certain events, the player can invite these citizens as Assassins; they can then be dispatched to remote locations across Europe to gain experience and money, or can be called in to help the player directly in a mission. For the first time in the series, the game features online multiplayer. Players play as Abstergo employees, who, through the use of the Animus, take on the genetic memories of Renaissance Templars in various game modes.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://kotaku.com/5531849/gamestop-placeholder-art-names-assassins-creed-brotherhood---update |title=GameStop Placeholder Art Names Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood \u2013 Update |newspaper=[[Kotaku]] |date=May 5, 2010 |accessdate=October 21, 2010 |last=Fahey |first=Mike |author-link=Mike Fahey |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829145121/http://kotaku.com/5531849/gamestop-placeholder-art-names-assassins-creed-brotherhood---update |archivedate=August 29, 2014  }}</ref> It was the last game to feature ''Assassin's Creed'' creator [[Patrice D\u00e9silets]], as the creative director of the series.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/07/20/life-after-ubisoft-again.aspx |title=Assassin's Creed Creator Talks Life After Ubisoft, Again |last=Bertz |first=Matt |date=July 20, 2015 |access-date=November 29, 2017 |newspaper=[[GameInformer]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822214710/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/07/20/life-after-ubisoft-again.aspx |archivedate=August 22, 2017  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/06/11/patrice-d-233-silets-walks-away-from-ubisoft-and-assassin-s-creed.aspx |title=Update: Patrice D\u00e9silets Walks Away From Ubisoft And Assassin's Creed |last=McNamara |first=Andy |author-link=Andy McNamara |date=June 11, 2010 |access-date=November 29, 2017 |newspaper=[[GameInformer]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201180243/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/06/11/patrice-d-233-silets-walks-away-from-ubisoft-and-assassin-s-creed.aspx |archivedate=December 1, 2017  }}</ref>\n\n====''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''====\n{{main|Assassin's Creed: Revelations}}\n\nWithin the computerized \"core\" of the Animus, Subject 16 ([[Clay Kaczmarek]]) explains to a comatose Desmond that his mind must achieve full synchronization with Alta\u00efr and Ezio, or he will fall into [[dementia]]. Desmond sees Ezio's memories, years after ''Brotherhood'', Ezio researches the Assassins' history and travels to Masyaf to locate Alta\u00efr's library, rumored to hold great power within. The Templars seek to open this library, but it is locked by five keys, hidden in the Ottoman-held [[Constantinople]]. Ezio finds the city in a feud between brothers [[Selim I|Selim]] and [[\u015eehzade Ahmet|Ahmet]] vying for the Sultanate. Ezio is aided by [[List of Assassin's Creed characters#Sofia Sartor|Sofia Sartor]]; the two fall in love. Eventually, Ahmet reveals himself to be a Templar, and is killed by Selim after he battles with Ezio. Ezio uses the keys to witness Alta\u00efr's memories before and after [[Al Mualim]]'s death, which show the death of Alta\u00efr's wife and youngest son in the midst of a [[coup d'etat]] within the Assassins. Altair exiles himself for twenty years, eventually returning to Masyaf to kill the usurper and retake control. Alta\u00efr inscribes his memories in the keys and asks his friend [[Niccol\u00f2 Polo]] to hide them. Afterwards, Ezio and Sofia go to Masyaf and open the library to find Alta\u00efr's corpse and a Piece of Eden. Ezio leaves it and his assassin tools, and tells Desmond, understanding now of his role as a messenger to him. A holographic being calling himself Jupiter explains to Desmond through Ezio how his society perished as a result of a massive [[solar flare]] apocalypse, and that the key to stop the 2012 solar flare lies in the first civilization's technology commanded by vaults linked to a central vault in New York. Within the Animus, Clay sacrifices himself to allow Desmond to wake up from his coma, his memories complete. Along with Shaun, Rebecca, and his father William, Desmond heads to New York to save humanity.\n\nOriginally ''Revelations'' was announced as ''Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy'', and conceptualized as a [[Nintendo 3DS]] title focusing on Ezio traveling to Masyaf. However, on July 15, 2011, it was announced as cancelled. The reason behind such \"cancellation\" was that Ubisoft had decided to expand the idea further, cancel the 3DS development and fully shift all development duties towards PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC to release the game as a full-fledged main installment of the franchise. The original plot remained, and evolved into the plot seen in the final game, which became ''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Philips|first=Tom|title=Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy canned|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-15-assassins-creed-lost-legacy-canned|website=Eurogamer|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718043046/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-15-assassins-creed-lost-legacy-canned|archivedate=July 18, 2011|date=July 15, 2011}}</ref> Included were many new systems and additional weapons such as bomb-crafting, allowing the player to create explosive, distraction and tactical bombs, using materials found throughout the world and on Assassin's Guild missions. The hookblade was also introduced, which can be used in free-running (to travel along zip wires and climb more easily) and in combat (to manipulate enemies). Eagle Vision was upgraded into the Eagle Sense, allowing Ezio to not only see where his enemies and targets are but also, where they have been and where they are moving to. As the player progresses through, Ezio can train new recruits to defend \"dens\", Assassin headquarters, and an upgraded Assassin's missions section called \"Mediterranean Defense\" in which the player works to strip control of various cities from Templar hands. The multiplayer mode returned in ''Revelations'', with more characters, modes, and maps, and by advancing up through levels of experience, the player learns more about Abstergo's history.\n\n====''Assassin's Creed III''====\n{{Main|Assassin's Creed III}}\n{{Long plot|section|date=January 2017}}\n\nDesmond and his allies arrive at the Temple in a New York cave on October 31, 2012, where they discover a larger chamber of Precursor technology behind it, including another door. Desmond suddenly falls into a [[fugue state]], and is put into the Animus.\n\nIn the Animus, he experiences the memories of Haytham Kenway, a [[British people|British]] Templar agent, who had gone to the American Colonies with a stolen medallion and recruit Templar allies such as [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]]. He gained the [[Mohawk people]]'s trust to find the Temple the medallion leads to. To his annoyance, the medallion did not open the Temple for him. The remainder of the game shifts to the memories of Haytham's son, [[Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton]], whose heritage is half Mohawk. As a young boy, he witnesses Lee and his troops set fire to his village, killing his mother; years later, he is shown a Piece of Eden, through which Juno speaks to him and instructs him to receive training from the retired Assassin, Achilles Davenport, who later inducts him into the order and nicknames him \"Connor\" (in memory of his son, who was killed in the [[American Revolution]]). Through him, Connor meets Patriots in the Revolution, helping them to stop several Templar plans, including an assassination attempt against [[George Washington]]. Between memories, Desmond helps his allies recover power sources to power the Temple scattered around the globe, including one held by Abstergo.\n\nConnor eventually faces his father and kills Lee; ending the Templar threat, before hiding the amulet. Desmond wakes up on December 21, and with his allies finds the buried medallion; the key to the inner Temple door. Behind it is a control sphere capable of stopping the solar flare. Juno appears and encourages Desmond to touch it, but Minerva appears and warns him not to, as it would release Juno as an entity that would protect against the solar flare, but would also become a threat to mankind's future. Desmond opts to release Juno, believing humanity will have a better chance fighting Juno. The energy from the control sphere protects Earth from the solar flare, but kills Desmond.\n\n''Assassin's Creed III'' is structured similarly to the previous games, with missions taking place on an open-world map based on Colonial Boston and New York, and offers a large wilderness area, the Frontier and in the Davenport Homestead, where the player can hunt animals for materials, which subsequently can be used to construct goods to be traded and sold throughout the colonies. Naval battles were introduced, wherein the player must steer a warship named ''Aquila'' in dangerous waters and perform ship-to-ship combat with cannons and mounted guns. In ''Assassin's Creed III'' there are a large assortment of side missions to play and many different outfits to purchase as the player progresses through the game. The modern-day aspects of the story were significantly expanded, and featured missions taking place in, among other locations, Manhattan, Rome and Brazil.\n\n====''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag''====\n{{Main|Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag}}\nSamples taken from Desmond Miles' body in the moments after his death have enabled Abstergo Industries to continue to explore his genetic memories using the Animus' newfound cloud computing abilities. The unnamed player character is hired by Abstergo's entertainment division to sift through the memories of Edward Kenway, an eighteenth-century pirate and the grandfather of Connor. Ostensibly, this is to gather material for an Animus-powered interactive video game, but in reality, Abstergo and the Templars are searching for the Observatory, a Precursor structure that allows the user to see through the eyes of a subject. As Kenway, the player must unravel a conspiracy between high-ranking Templars to manipulate the British, Spanish and French empires into locating the Sage \u2013 later identified as [[Bartholomew Roberts]] \u2013 who is the only man who can lead them to the Observatory.\n\nIn the present day, the player is contacted by John, Abstergo Entertainment's information technology manager. John convinces the player that his employer knows more than they are telling, and encourages them to investigate in more detail. He arranges for the player to access the Animus' core, at which point Juno materialises into an incorporeal form. She reveals that although it was necessary to open her temple to avert disaster, the world was not ready for her, and she is unable to affect it or possess the player character as her agents intended. John is unmasked as the reincarnated form of the Sage and attempts to murder the player to cover up the failed attempt at resurrecting Juno, but is killed by Abstergo's security before he can do so. As Roberts, the Sage admits to Kenway that he owes no allegiance to the Assassins or the Templars and instead uses whoever he thinks represents his best chance of achieving his ends.\n\n====''Assassin's Creed Rogue''====\n{{main|Assassin's Creed Rogue}}\nThe plot follows Assassin-turned-Templar, [[Shay Patrick Cormac]], and is set during the [[Seven Years' War]] across various locations in northeastern North America and the North Atlantic.<ref name=\"PolygonRogue\">{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/5/5971421/assassins-creed-rogue-trailer-confirmed-ubisoft|title=Assassin's Creed Rogue confirmed by Ubisoft \u2013 here's the first trailer|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|work=Polygon|date=August 5, 2014|accessdate=August 5, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806140407/http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/5/5971421/assassins-creed-rogue-trailer-confirmed-ubisoft|archivedate=August 6, 2014}}</ref> It is meant to \"fill the gaps\" of the story between ''III'' and ''Black Flag'' and has \"a crucial link to the Kenway saga\", as well as connecting to ''Unity''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2014/08/05/september-cover-reveal-assassins-creed-rogue-unity.aspx|title=September Cover Revealed \u2013 Assassin's Creed Rogue And Unity|last=Wallace|first=Kimberly|publisher=GameStop|work=Game Informer|date=August 5, 2014|accessdate=August 5, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805190710/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2014/08/05/september-cover-reveal-assassins-creed-rogue-unity.aspx|archivedate=August 5, 2014}}</ref>  Haytham Kenway from ''III'' and [[Ad\u00e9wal\u00e9]] from ''Black Flag'' make appearances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/sources-assassins-creed-comet-will-let-you-play-as-a-1552929846|title=Sources: Assassin's Creed Comet Will Let You Play As A Templar|last=Schreier|first=Jason|publisher=Kotaku|date=March 27, 2014|accessdate=March 27, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328120043/http://kotaku.com/sources-assassins-creed-comet-will-let-you-play-as-a-1552929846|archivedate=March 28, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBy March 2014, a game titled or code-named \"''Comet''\" was revealed to be in development, for release on [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]].<ref name=\"KotakuUnity\" /> By the end of the month, additional reports indicated that ''Comet'' would be set around 1758 in New York, as well as feature sailing on the Atlantic Ocean.

One day a stranger appears, a Chinese female Assassin called [[Shao Jun]], who came to Ezio in order to seek knowledge of his life as an Assassin. Although Ezio prefers that Jun not stay, due to his desire to leave his days as an Assassin behind, Sofia allows her to stay for the night. The next day, Ezio catches Jun reading his memoirs and bids her to leave, but relents after she asks him about what it means to be an Assassin. While on a trip to [[Firenze]], Ezio recounts his story of how his father and brothers were executed in the town square, forcing him to become an Assassin (the events of ''[[Assassin's Creed II#Plot|Assassin's Creed II]]''), and how such a life is defined by the pain it brings and causes. As they leave, the two are attacked by a stranger, who appears to be of Asian origin as well. After killing him, Jun reveals that she was a former [[concubine]], now on the run from servants of the Chinese [[Zhengde Emperor]], and explains how her former master rescued her from his influence. After returning to his home, Ezio tells Sofia and his children to leave, knowing that others would come. He then teaches Jun the key to liberating her people from the Emperor's influence. Later that night, Ezio's villa is attacked by more of Shao Jun's enemies, and after a fight, he successfully eliminates them all. The next morning, Ezio hands Shao Jun a small box and tells her it may come to use one day, but only if \"you lose your way\". He then sends her away as two riders appear at the villa. Sometime afterward Ezio journeys to Firenze with his wife Sofia and their daughter Flavia, despite suffering from heart problems. While resting on a bench and after having a short conversation with a young man with a scar on his face, similar to the sort of man he used to be, he exhales and dies in view of his family. The film then ends as a final letter from Ezio to Sofia is read, saying that of all the things that kept him going throughout life, love for the world around him was the strongest of them all.\n\n===Comics===\n<!-- [[Assassin's Creed (comics)]] redirects here. -->\n\n====''Assassin's Creed: Graphic Novel''====\nIn the limited edition of ''Assassin's Creed'', an 8-page [[graphic novel]] was included, that showed two side-stories of Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad and Desmond Miles.

It depicts a centuries-old struggle, now and then, between the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], who fight for peace with free will, and the [[Knights Templar|Templars]], who desire peace through control. The series features [[historical fiction]], [[science fiction]] and [[fictional characters|characters]], intertwined with real-world [[historical events]] and [[historical figures|figures]]. For the majority of time players control an Assassin in the past history, while they also play as Desmond Miles or an Assassin Initiate in the present day, who hunt down their Templar targets.\n\nThe video game series took inspiration from the novel ''[[Alamut (Bartol novel)|Alamut]]'' by the Slovenian writer [[Vladimir Bartol]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/148805/interviews/assassins-creed/|title=Interview: Assassin's Creed|publisher=CVG|accessdate=September 2, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025102806/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/148805/interviews/assassins-creed/|archivedate=October 25, 2012}}</ref> while building upon concepts from the ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-assassins-creed|title=The Making Of: Assassin's Creed|publisher=EDGE|date=August 27, 2012|accessdate=March 3, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228044009/http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-assassins-creed/|archivedate=December 28, 2013}}</ref> The series's [[Assassin's Creed (video game)|eponymous first title]] was released in 2007, and it has featured eleven main games in total, the most recent being 2018's ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]'', while a new game ''[[Assassin's Creed Valhalla]]'' has been announced.\n\nA new story and time period are introduced in each entry, and gameplay elements evolve from the previous one. There are three story arcs in the series. For the first five main games, the framing story is set in 2012 and features series protagonist [[Desmond Miles]] who uses a machine called the Animus and relives the memories of his ancestors to find a way to avert the [[2012 phenomenon|2012 apocalypse]]. In games up until and including ''[[Assassin's Creed Syndicate]]'', Abstergo employees and Assassin initiates recorded genetic memories using the Helix software, helping the Templars and Assassins find new Pieces of Eden in the modern world. The latest two games, ''[[Assassin's Creed Origins]]'' and ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]'' follow ex-Abstergo employee Layla Hassan as she is recruited into the Assassin Order.\n\nMain games of ''Assassin's Creed'' are set in an [[open world]] and presented from the [[third-person perspective]] where the protagonists take down targets using their combat and stealth skills with the exploitation of the environment. Players have freedom to explore the historical settings as they finish main and side quests. Apart from single-player missions, some games also provide competitive and cooperative multiplayer gameplay. While main games are produced for major consoles and desktop platforms, multiple spin-off games are released for consoles, mobiles, and handhelds platforms.\n\nThe main games in the ''Assassin's Creed'' video game series have received generally positive reviews for their ambition in visuals, game design, and narratives, with criticism towards the yearly release cycle and frequent bugs. The spin-off games received mixed to positive reviews. The video game series has received multiple awards and nominations, including Game of the Year awards. It is commercially successful, selling over 140 million copies {{as of|2019|9|lc=y}}, becoming Ubisoft's best-selling franchise and one of the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|highest selling video game franchises of all time]]. ''Assassin's Creed'' was adapted into a [[Assassin's Creed (film)|film]], which received negative reviews. A series of art books, encyclopedias, comics, novelizations, and [[Assassin's Creed (book series)|novels]] have been published. All of the media take place within the same continuity as the main video game series.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ubisoft developper team of Assasians creed on Quebec Remparts vs Titan d'Acadie-Bathurst on Centre Vid\u00e9otron, Qu\u00e9bec city 02.jpg|thumb|Members of Ubisoft Quebec, developer team of the latest title in the series, ''Assassin's Creed Odyssey'']]\nThe ''Assassin's Creed'' series originated out of ideas for a sequel for ''[[Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time]]'', a 3D adaption of the original ''[[Prince of Persia]]'' games, which was made for [[PlayStation 2]], [[GameCube]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and other platforms. It included a number of [[parkour]] moves and combat. ''The Sands of Time'' was a critical and financial success, leading publisher Ubisoft to request Ubisoft Montreal to develop a sequel, aiming for the [[seventh generation of video game consoles|next console generation]]. The Ubisoft Montreal team decided on taking the gameplay from ''The Sands of Time'' into an [[open world]] approach, taking advantage of the improved processing power to render larger spaces and crowds. Narratively, the team wanted to move away from the Prince being someone next in line for the throne but to have to work for it; combined with research into secret societies led them to focus on the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], heavily borrowing from the novel ''[[Alamut (Bartol novel)|Alamut]]''.<ref name=\"polygon oral\">{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/features/2018/10/3/17924770/assassins-creed-an-oral-history-patrice-desilets | title=  Assassin's Creed: An oral history | first = Richard | last = Moss | date = October 3, 2018 | accessdate = October 3, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}</ref>\n\nThey developed a narrative where the player would control an Assassin that served as a bodyguard for a non-playable Prince, leading them to call this game ''Prince of Persia: Assassin''. Ubisoft was not happy with a ''Prince of Persia'' game without the Prince as the playable character, but this led to the marketing division to suggest the name ''Assassin's Creed'', playing off the creed of the Assassins, \"nothing is true; everything is permitted\". Ubisoft Montreal ran with this in creating a new [[intellectual property]], eliminating the Prince and creating the conflict between the Assassins and [[Templar Knights]]. Further, in postulating what other assassinations they could account for throughout human history, they came onto the idea of [[genetic memory (psychology)|genetic memory]] and created the \"Animus\" device and modern storyline elements, which further allowed them to explain certain facets of gameplay, such as accounting when the player fails a mission, in the same way they had done in ''The Sands of Time''.<ref name=\"polygon oral\"/>\n\nFollowing release of the first ''Assassin's Creed'' in 2007, Ubisoft Montreal and other Ubisoft studios use the series to present games from various historical periods, striving for historical accuracy while conceding some elements for gameplay.<ref name=\"polygon oral\"/>\n\n==Premise==\n[[File:Abstergo 2.png|thumb|''- \"We change the world. Every day, in a hundred different ways.\"'' -<br />The fictional slogan and logo of [[Abstergo Industries]] from the ''Assassin's Creed'' franchise]]\nThe ''Assassin's Creed'' games primarily revolve around the rivalry and conflict between two ancient secret societies \u2014 the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]], who represent freedom, and the [[Knights Templar]], who represent order; as well as their indirect relation to an [[Ancient astronauts|ancient species pre-dating humanity]], referred to within the games as \"those who came before\" or \"precursors\", who were technologically advanced and claimed to be the creators of humanity, before their society and much of Earth's biosphere were destroyed by a massive [[Coronal mass ejection|solar storm]] thousands of years before the games. The games' are split between various real-world settings in different chronological periods - the present, modern day era, and various historical settings, the latter including a variety of historical characters given fictionalized involvement in the conflict between the two secret societies.\n\nThe main premise focuses on the efforts of the Assassins in stopping the Knights Templars from finding and securing various artifacts of the ancient species, known as \"Pieces of Eden\", which hold great power and are capable of controlling [[free will]]. In the modern era, the Assassins, also known as \"The Brotherhood\", focus on combating the Templars, who evolved with the world and developed into a [[mega-corporation]] [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] with multiple branches called Abstergo Industries. To help trace Pieces of Eden to locations in the modern-era world, Abstergo secretly develops a device called the \"Animus\" - a computerized system that can allow one to \"re-live\" and experience the memories of previous people through remnants of their genetic material. Initially only capable of allowing a person to explore the memories of their genetic ancestors, later improvements to the Animus allow virtually anyone to experience the lives of any person used in the device. Overexposure to the animus causes the \"bleeding effect\", which results in giving the user skills and abilities of his ancestors, but is also dangerous for the user as it can damage their mind, causing symptoms such as [[dementia]], [[insanity]], [[dissociative identity disorder]] or [[brain damage]].\n\nThe initial story arc of the games focuses on the efforts of the Brotherhood to thwart Abstergo's plans to secure a Piece of Eden and ultimately to uncover a method to prevent the world being destroyed by another solar storm in 2012, while several titles after this focus on the efforts of each side to cause problems for their opponent in their continuing conflict. The release of ''Origins'' introduced a new story arc focused on a researcher who becomes involved in searching out memories of ancient assassins, and becoming involved in seeking the means to prevent either society gaining the upper-hand over the other.\n\n===Protagonists===\n{{main|List of Assassin's Creed characters}}\n[[Desmond Miles]] is a bartender who is a descendant of several lines of prominent [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]]; though raised as an Assassin, he left his nomadic family to seek out a more common lifestyle. He is initially kidnapped by Abstergo, which is aware of his ancestral lineage. Desmond is forced into the Animus and is revealed to be subject 17; many of the sixteen previous subjects died as a result of Animus over-exposure.\n\nDesmond is later rescued by a small team of modern-day Assassins and agrees to work with them, continuing to experience the memories of his ancestors to discover the locations of additional Pieces of Eden so they can be recovered before Abstergo can do so. From the bleeding effect, Desmond gains some of the Assassin skills of his predecessors at the cost of living with multiple sets of memories and personalities in his mind.\n\nWithin the Animus, Desmond explores the memories of a number of Assassins, including [[Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad]], an initially disgraced Assassin working to redeem himself during the [[Third Crusade]]; [[Ezio Auditore da Firenze]], an Assassin in Italy during the late 15th and early 16th centuries of the [[Italian Renaissance]]; and [[Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton]], otherwise known as Connor, a half-[[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], half-[[British people|British]] Assassin during the [[American Revolution]].\n\nThroughout these events, Desmond learns of allusions to the prophetic [[2012 phenomenon|end of the world in 2012]] from a former Animus test subject, Subject 16; the event turns out to be a repeat of the disaster which wiped out the ancient civilization, and he finds out that his memories hold the key to Earth's surviving a second solar storm. During his experiences, Desmond is aided by holographic projections of three of the ancient race's rulers: Jupiter, Minerva, and Juno.\n\nAfter Desmond dies to ensure Earth's survival, his memories, which have survived through genetic samples of his DNA,<ref name=\"GI preview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/assassins_creed_iv_black_flag/b/playstation4/archive/2013/03/04/assassin-39-s-creed-iv-black-flag-preview.aspx|title=Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag|last=Vore|first=Bryan|publisher=Gameinformer.com|date=March 4, 2013|accessdate=March 4, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306035746/http://www.gameinformer.com/games/assassins_creed_iv_black_flag/b/playstation4/archive/2013/03/04/assassin-39-s-creed-iv-black-flag-preview.aspx|archivedate=March 6, 2013}}</ref> are accessed by Abstergo, which hires a new subject to enter the Animus. The new subject relives the memories of Edward Kenway (grandfather of Ratohnhak\u00e9:ton, otherwise known as Connor Kenway), a privateer-turned-pirate during the [[Golden Age of Piracy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/04/the-dawn-of-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag|title=The Dawn of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag|last=George|first=Richard|website=IGN|date=March 4, 2013|accessdate=August 30, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930175256/http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/04/the-dawn-of-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag|archivedate=September 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\nWhile the games are often presented through protagonist Desmond Miles, the bulk of the game is played as Desmond experiences the memories of his ancestors through an advanced device called the Animus. This provides a means of a diegetic interface, showing Desmond's ancestor's health, equipment, goals, and other features as part of the Animus interface. The Animus is based on the player controlling the assassin to maintain the synchronization between Desmond and his ancestor's memories. Performing actions that go against the Assassin's way or dying breaks the synchronization, effectively requiring the player to restart at a previous checkpoint. Furthermore, the player cannot explore outside areas that the assassin has not experienced yet. There are also abnormalities within the Animus from previous users of the device.\n\nWhile playing as the Assassin characters, the games are generally presented from a [[Third-person (video games)|third-person perspective]] in an [[open world]] environment, focusing on [[Stealth game|stealth]] and [[parkour]]. The games use a mission structure to follow the main story, generally assigning the player to complete an assassination of public figureheads or a covert mission. Alternatively, several side missions are available, such as mapping out the expansive cities from a high perch followed by performing a \"leap of faith\" into a haystack below, collecting treasures hidden across the cities, exploring ruins for relics, building a brotherhood of assassins to perform other tasks, or funding the rebuilding of a city through purchasing and upgrading of shops and other features. At times, the player is in direct control of Desmond, who by nature of the Animus use has learned Assassin techniques through the bleeding effect, as well as their genetic ability of Eagle Vision, which separates friend, foe and assassination targets by illuminating people in different colors. Through the Animus interface, the player can go back to retry any past mission already completed; for example, in ''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood'', the player achieves better synchronization results by performing the mission in a specific manner such as by only killing the mission's target.\n\nThe games use the concept of \"active\" versus \"passive\" moves, with \"active\" moves, such as running, climbing the sides of buildings, or jumping between rooftops, more likely to alert the attention of nearby guards. When the guards become alerted, the player must either fight them or break their line of sight and locate a hiding place, such as a haystack or a well, and wait until the guards' alert is reduced. The combat system allows for a number of unique weapons, armor, and moves, including the use of a hidden blade set in a bracer on the Assassin's arm, and which also can be used to quietly assassinate targets.\n\n==Release history==\nThe following table lists the games created for the franchise and the respective platform(s) they released upon:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!Title\n!Released\n!Platform\n!Other\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]]''\n|2007\n|[[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed: Alta\u00efr's Chronicles]]''\n|2008\n|[[Nintendo DS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], [[Symbian]], [[webOS]], [[Windows Phone]]\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines]]''\n|rowspan=\"3\"|2009\n|[[PlayStation Portable]]\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed II]]''\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], [[OS X]], Windows, Symbian\n|[[OnLive]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed II: Discovery]]''\n|Nintendo DS, iOS\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood]]''\n|2010\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, OS X, Windows\n|rowspan=\"2\"|OnLive\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed: Revelations]]''\n|2011\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, Android, Symbian\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed III]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2012\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, [[Wii U]], PlayStation 4, Xbox One, [[Nintendo Switch]], [[Symbian]]\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed III: Liberation]]''<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"Liberation HD\">Released under the title ''Assassin's Creed: Liberation HD'' for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.</ref>\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, [[PlayStation Vita]]\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2013\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, Nintendo Switch\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed: Pirates]]''\n|Windows,<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"Pirates\">Available for Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 from the Microsoft store.</ref> Android, iOS\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed: Freedom Cry]]''<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"FreedomCry\">Originally released as DLC for all versions of ''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag''.</ref>\n|rowspan=\"4\"|2014\n|PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Windows\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Rogue]]''\n|PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Windows\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Identity]]''\n|Android, iOS\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Unity]]''\n|PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Chronicles|Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China]]''<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"ChroniclesChina\">Originally announced as part of the season pass for ''Assassin's Creed Unity''.</ref>\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2015\n|PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, PlayStation Vita<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"PSVita\">Released as a compilation titled ''Assassin's Creed Chronicles Trilogy Pack''.</ref>\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Syndicate]]''\n|PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Chronicles|Assassin's Creed Chronicles: India]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2016\n|rowspan=\"2\"|PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, PlayStation Vita<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"PSVita\"/>\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Chronicles|Assassin's Creed Chronicles: Russia]]''\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Origins]]''\n|2017\n|rowspan=\"2\"|PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]''\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2018\n|[[Google Stadia|Stadia]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" |''[[Assassin's Creed#Assassin's Creed Rebellion|Assassin's Creed Rebellion]]''\n|Android, iOS\n|\u2014\n|}\n\n; Notes\n<references group=\"lower-alpha\" />\n\n===Main series===\n\n====''Assassin's Creed''====\n{{main|Assassin's Creed (video game)}}\nDesmond Miles is captured by Abstergo and forced to use a machine called the Animus to explore Alta\u00efr ibn-La'Ahad's memories during the time of the [[Third Crusade]]. Desmond begins to witness events after Alta\u00efr breaks all three tenets of the Assassin Brotherhood while attempting to stop [[Robert IV de Sabl\u00e9|Robert de Sabl\u00e9]] from taking a Piece of Eden. [[Al Mualim]], the Brotherhood's leader, demotes Alta\u00efr to Novice and tasks him with assassinating the nine Knights Templars, including de Sabl\u00e9, to regain his former status. Alta\u00efr's quest eventually leads him to face de Sabl\u00e9 in the presence of King [[Richard I of England]] warning the King of de Sabl\u00e9's plot to kill him. Alta\u00efr defeats de Sabl\u00e9, but with his last words, de Sabl\u00e9 reveals that there were ten Templars, the last being Al Mualim, who now holds the Piece of Eden. Alta\u00efr returns to face Al Mualim and struggles to fight through illusions created by the Piece, but eventually kills Al Mualim. When Alta\u00efr recovers the piece, he and those watching the Animus view a holographic map showing where other artifacts are located across the globe. Desmond is pulled from the Animus, and was going to be killed, but his life is spared by [[Lucy Stillman]], an Assassin working as a mole within Abstergo, as she claims they might need to further examine his memories later. He comes to learn that a former test subject had left messages only Desmond can see, foretelling the end of the world in 2012.\n\nThe first ''Assassin's Creed'' introduced core elements that remained  in the rest of the game series. The game creates fictionalized, historical versions of [[Masyaf]] (the Brotherhood's location), [[Jerusalem]], [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and [[Damascus]], and incorporates a number of documented historical figures into the story. Other core elements include the virtualized Animus system, free running, climbing, stealth, [[parkour]], and the initial formulation of the combat system. The game requires the player to complete a number of side quests before they are able to obtain an assassin quest from a local Brotherhood guidemaster in each city, but this side quest prerequisite was abandoned in future games.\n\n====''Assassin's Creed II''====\n{{main|Assassin's Creed II}}\nLucy returns and breaks Desmond out of Abstergo, taking him to an Assassin safehouse to work alongside Shaun, a historian, and Rebecca, their technical support. Using an improved version of the Animus, Desmond takes witness to Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young nobleman from the late 15th century in [[Florence]], shortly before the execution of Ezio's father and brothers by order of a corrupt official working for the Templars. He, his mother, and sister take to hiding at the Monteriggioni villa owned by his uncle Mario, who helps to train Ezio in the ways of an Assassin. Ezio and Mario discover that Rodrigo Borgia is the figurehead of a number of Templars all who were accomplices in the execution of his family, and with help of allies like [[Leonardo da Vinci]], methodically assassinate the lower-ranked Templars, while learning that Borgia has acquired a Piece of Eden called the Apple. Eventually, Ezio corners Borgia, who hands over the Piece and flees; Ezio is inducted into the ranks of the Brotherhood and believed to be a prophet based on their codex. A decade later, the Brotherhood learns that Borgia has since become [[Pope Alexander VI]], using the Church's influence to strengthen the Templars. Ezio invades [[Vatican City]] and confronts Borgia, discovering that the Papal staff is also a Piece of Eden. Defeating Borgia but sparing his life, Ezio uses both the Apple and the Papal staff to reveal a chamber of ancient technology. Inside, he is addressed by a hologram of a humanoid female that calls herself Minerva who speaks directly to Desmond through Ezio. Minerva explains how her society had pre-dated humanity's, but a great disaster nearly wiped them out, and warns that another event is due to occur soon, putting the fate of humanity in Desmond's hands. Upon this discovery, Desmond and his allies find the safehouse has been compromised by Abstergo and flee.\n\nSimilar to the first game, ''Assassin's Creed II'' takes place in historical recreations of [[Venice]], [[Florence]], [[Forl\u00ec]], [[San Gimignano]], and the [[Tuscany|Tuscan countryside]], and incorporates events during that period as part of the story. Missions are divided into main story missions, themselves divided into memory sequences reflecting points in Ezio's life, and side missions which can be accomplished at any time; this approach to mission structure remains consistent in the other games in the series. The Monteriggioni villa provides several functions which can be expanded on by paying money for upgrades of surrounding buildings, or by purchasing artwork, weapons, and armor for the villa; in turn, the villa will generate wealth for the player at a rate influenced by the upgrades and acquisition of these items. Additional quests involve locating secret Assassin seals, and finding hidden marks left by \"Subject 16\", a former Animus user, that hint at the nature of Minerva's society.\n\n====''Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood''====\n{{main|Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood}}\nDesmond and his allies retreat to the ruins of the Monteriggioni villa, and Desmond reenters the Animus to continue Ezio's memories, specifically to identify the location of the Apple. After facing Rodrigo Borgia, Ezio returned to Monteriggioni, but the villa is soon attacked by forces under the command of [[Cesare Borgia]], Rodrigo's son. Mario is killed and the Apple is stolen. Ezio vows revenge by helping to free the people of Rome from the Borgia family. As Ezio works covertly to turn the city against the Borgias, he gains followers that want to join his cause, and Ezio trains them in the way of the Assassins. In an attempt to assassinate Cesare and Rodrigo at the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], Ezio instead witnesses Cesare forcing his father to eat a poisoned apple that Rodrigo had prepared to kill his son. Ezio chases down Cesare and eventually captures him and recovers the Apple. Cesare is taken to prison in Viana, Spain but manages to escape with help of his allies. The Assassins lead the fight against Cesare and the remaining loyal Borgia troops, and eventually Ezio throws Cesare from the castle walls, killing him. With no perceived further threats, Ezio takes to hide the Apple under the [[Colosseum]]. In the present, Desmond is able to navigate through the underground chambers beneath the Colosseum to locate the Apple. As he picks it up, Desmond is witness to another hologram figure, calling herself Juno, and who controls Desmond to stab Lucy (because Lucy has defected to the Templars) before he falls into a coma.\n\n''Brotherhood'' shares many of the same features as the previous game though it takes place primarily in Rome. Similar to the villa, the player is able to spend money to buy and upgrade shops and other facilities throughout the city as to increase revenue they can collect from it; however, the player will be required to destroy Borgia towers that control various sections of the city before they can do so.  The Brotherhood of Assassins is introduced, by which, after saving citizens from certain events, the player can invite these citizens as Assassins; they can then be dispatched to remote locations across Europe to gain experience and money, or can be called in to help the player directly in a mission. For the first time in the series, the game features online multiplayer. Players play as Abstergo employees, who, through the use of the Animus, take on the genetic memories of Renaissance Templars in various game modes.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://kotaku.com/5531849/gamestop-placeholder-art-names-assassins-creed-brotherhood---update |title=GameStop Placeholder Art Names Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood \u2013 Update |newspaper=[[Kotaku]] |date=May 5, 2010 |accessdate=October 21, 2010 |last=Fahey |first=Mike |author-link=Mike Fahey |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829145121/http://kotaku.com/5531849/gamestop-placeholder-art-names-assassins-creed-brotherhood---update |archivedate=August 29, 2014  }}</ref> It was the last game to feature ''Assassin's Creed'' creator [[Patrice D\u00e9silets]], as the creative director of the series.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/07/20/life-after-ubisoft-again.aspx |title=Assassin's Creed Creator Talks Life After Ubisoft, Again |last=Bertz |first=Matt |date=July 20, 2015 |access-date=November 29, 2017 |newspaper=[[GameInformer]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822214710/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/07/20/life-after-ubisoft-again.aspx |archivedate=August 22, 2017  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/06/11/patrice-d-233-silets-walks-away-from-ubisoft-and-assassin-s-creed.aspx |title=Update: Patrice D\u00e9silets Walks Away From Ubisoft And Assassin's Creed |last=McNamara |first=Andy |author-link=Andy McNamara |date=June 11, 2010 |access-date=November 29, 2017 |newspaper=[[GameInformer]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201180243/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/06/11/patrice-d-233-silets-walks-away-from-ubisoft-and-assassin-s-creed.aspx |archivedate=December 1, 2017  }}</ref>\n\n====''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''====\n{{main|Assassin's Creed: Revelations}}\n\nWithin the computerized \"core\" of the Animus, Subject 16 ([[Clay Kaczmarek]]) explains to a comatose Desmond that his mind must achieve full synchronization with Alta\u00efr and Ezio, or he will fall into [[dementia]]. Desmond sees Ezio's memories, years after ''Brotherhood'', Ezio researches the Assassins' history and travels to Masyaf to locate Alta\u00efr's library, rumored to hold great power within. The Templars seek to open this library, but it is locked by five keys, hidden in the Ottoman-held [[Constantinople]]. Ezio finds the city in a feud between brothers [[Selim I|Selim]] and [[\u015eehzade Ahmet|Ahmet]] vying for the Sultanate. Ezio is aided by [[List of Assassin's Creed characters#Sofia Sartor|Sofia Sartor]]; the two fall in love. Eventually, Ahmet reveals himself to be a Templar, and is killed by Selim after he battles with Ezio. Ezio uses the keys to witness Alta\u00efr's memories before and after [[Al Mualim]]'s death, which show the death of Alta\u00efr's wife and youngest son in the midst of a [[coup d'etat]] within the Assassins. Altair exiles himself for twenty years, eventually returning to Masyaf to kill the usurper and retake control. Alta\u00efr inscribes his memories in the keys and asks his friend [[Niccol\u00f2 Polo]] to hide them. Afterwards, Ezio and Sofia go to Masyaf and open the library to find Alta\u00efr's corpse and a Piece of Eden. Ezio leaves it and his assassin tools, and tells Desmond, understanding now of his role as a messenger to him. A holographic being calling himself Jupiter explains to Desmond through Ezio how his society perished as a result of a massive [[solar flare]] apocalypse, and that the key to stop the 2012 solar flare lies in the first civilization's technology commanded by vaults linked to a central vault in New York. Within the Animus, Clay sacrifices himself to allow Desmond to wake up from his coma, his memories complete. Along with Shaun, Rebecca, and his father William, Desmond heads to New York to save humanity.\n\nOriginally ''Revelations'' was announced as ''Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy'', and conceptualized as a [[Nintendo 3DS]] title focusing on Ezio traveling to Masyaf. However, on July 15, 2011, it was announced as cancelled. The reason behind such \"cancellation\" was that Ubisoft had decided to expand the idea further, cancel the 3DS development and fully shift all development duties towards PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC to release the game as a full-fledged main installment of the franchise. The original plot remained, and evolved into the plot seen in the final game, which became ''Assassin's Creed: Revelations''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Philips|first=Tom|title=Assassin's Creed: Lost Legacy canned|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-15-assassins-creed-lost-legacy-canned|website=Eurogamer|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718043046/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-07-15-assassins-creed-lost-legacy-canned|archivedate=July 18, 2011|date=July 15, 2011}}</ref> Included were many new systems and additional weapons such as bomb-crafting, allowing the player to create explosive, distraction and tactical bombs, using materials found throughout the world and on Assassin's Guild missions. The hookblade was also introduced, which can be used in free-running (to travel along zip wires and climb more easily) and in combat (to manipulate enemies). Eagle Vision was upgraded into the Eagle Sense, allowing Ezio to not only see where his enemies and targets are but also, where they have been and where they are moving to. As the player progresses through, Ezio can train new recruits to defend \"dens\", Assassin headquarters, and an upgraded Assassin's missions section called \"Mediterranean Defense\" in which the player works to strip control of various cities from Templar hands. The multiplayer mode returned in ''Revelations'', with more characters, modes, and maps, and by advancing up through levels of experience, the player learns more about Abstergo's history.\n\n====''Assassin's Creed III''====\n{{Main|Assassin's Creed III}}\n{{Long plot|section|date=January 2017}}\n\nDesmond and his allies arrive at the Temple in a New York cave on October 31, 2012, where they discover a larger chamber of Precursor technology behind it, including another door. Desmond suddenly falls into a [[fugue state]], and is put into the Animus.\n\nIn the Animus, he experiences the memories of Haytham Kenway, a [[British people|British]] Templar agent, who had gone to the American Colonies with a stolen medallion and recruit Templar allies such as [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]]. He gained the [[Mohawk people]]'s trust to find the Temple the medallion leads to. To his annoyance, the medallion did not open the Temple for him. The remainder of the game shifts to the memories of Haytham's son, [[Ratonhnhak\u00e9:ton]], whose heritage is half Mohawk. As a young boy, he witnesses Lee and his troops set fire to his village, killing his mother; years later, he is shown a Piece of Eden, through which Juno speaks to him and instructs him to receive training from the retired Assassin, Achilles Davenport, who later inducts him into the order and nicknames him \"Connor\" (in memory of his son, who was killed in the [[American Revolution]]). Through him, Connor meets Patriots in the Revolution, helping them to stop several Templar plans, including an assassination attempt against [[George Washington]]. Between memories, Desmond helps his allies recover power sources to power the Temple scattered around the globe, including one held by Abstergo.\n\nConnor eventually faces his father and kills Lee; ending the Templar threat, before hiding the amulet. Desmond wakes up on December 21, and with his allies finds the buried medallion; the key to the inner Temple door. Behind it is a control sphere capable of stopping the solar flare. Juno appears and encourages Desmond to touch it, but Minerva appears and warns him not to, as it would release Juno as an entity that would protect against the solar flare, but would also become a threat to mankind's future. Desmond opts to release Juno, believing humanity will have a better chance fighting Juno. The energy from the control sphere protects Earth from the solar flare, but kills Desmond.\n\n''Assassin's Creed III'' is structured similarly to the previous games, with missions taking place on an open-world map based on Colonial Boston and New York, and offers a large wilderness area, the Frontier and in the Davenport Homestead, where the player can hunt animals for materials, which subsequently can be used to construct goods to be traded and sold throughout the colonies. Naval battles were introduced, wherein the player must steer a warship named ''Aquila'' in dangerous waters and perform ship-to-ship combat with cannons and mounted guns. In ''Assassin's Creed III'' there are a large assortment of side missions to play and many different outfits to purchase as the player progresses through the game. The modern-day aspects of the story were significantly expanded, and featured missions taking place in, among other locations, Manhattan, Rome and Brazil.\n\n====''Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag''====\n{{Main|Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag}}\nSamples taken from Desmond Miles' body in the moments after his death have enabled Abstergo Industries to continue to explore his genetic memories using the Animus' newfound cloud computing abilities. The unnamed player character is hired by Abstergo's entertainment division to sift through the memories of Edward Kenway, an eighteenth-century pirate and the grandfather of Connor. Ostensibly, this is to gather material for an Animus-powered interactive video game, but in reality, Abstergo and the Templars are searching for the Observatory, a Precursor structure that allows the user to see through the eyes of a subject. As Kenway, the player must unravel a conspiracy between high-ranking Templars to manipulate the British, Spanish and French empires into locating the Sage \u2013 later identified as [[Bartholomew Roberts]] \u2013 who is the only man who can lead them to the Observatory.\n\nIn the present day, the player is contacted by John, Abstergo Entertainment's information technology manager. John convinces the player that his employer knows more than they are telling, and encourages them to investigate in more detail. He arranges for the player to access the Animus' core, at which point Juno materialises into an incorporeal form. She reveals that although it was necessary to open her temple to avert disaster, the world was not ready for her, and she is unable to affect it or possess the player character as her agents intended. John is unmasked as the reincarnated form of the Sage and attempts to murder the player to cover up the failed attempt at resurrecting Juno, but is killed by Abstergo's security before he can do so. As Roberts, the Sage admits to Kenway that he owes no allegiance to the Assassins or the Templars and instead uses whoever he thinks represents his best chance of achieving his ends.\n\n====''Assassin's Creed Rogue''====\n{{main|Assassin's Creed Rogue}}\nThe plot follows Assassin-turned-Templar, [[Shay Patrick Cormac]], and is set during the [[Seven Years' War]] across various locations in northeastern North America and the North Atlantic.<ref name=\"PolygonRogue\">{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/5/5971421/assassins-creed-rogue-trailer-confirmed-ubisoft|title=Assassin's Creed Rogue confirmed by Ubisoft \u2013 here's the first trailer|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|work=Polygon|date=August 5, 2014|accessdate=August 5, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806140407/http://www.polygon.com/2014/8/5/5971421/assassins-creed-rogue-trailer-confirmed-ubisoft|archivedate=August 6, 2014}}</ref> It is meant to \"fill the gaps\" of the story between ''III'' and ''Black Flag'' and has \"a crucial link to the Kenway saga\", as well as connecting to ''Unity''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2014/08/05/september-cover-reveal-assassins-creed-rogue-unity.aspx|title=September Cover Revealed \u2013 Assassin's Creed Rogue And Unity|last=Wallace|first=Kimberly|publisher=GameStop|work=Game Informer|date=August 5, 2014|accessdate=August 5, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805190710/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2014/08/05/september-cover-reveal-assassins-creed-rogue-unity.aspx|archivedate=August 5, 2014}}</ref>  Haytham Kenway from ''III'' and [[Ad\u00e9wal\u00e9]] from ''Black Flag'' make appearances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/sources-assassins-creed-comet-will-let-you-play-as-a-1552929846|title=Sources: Assassin's Creed Comet Will Let You Play As A Templar|last=Schreier|first=Jason|publisher=Kotaku|date=March 27, 2014|accessdate=March 27, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328120043/http://kotaku.com/sources-assassins-creed-comet-will-let-you-play-as-a-1552929846|archivedate=March 28, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBy March 2014, a game titled or code-named \"''Comet''\" was revealed to be in development, for release on [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]].<ref name=\"KotakuUnity\" /> By the end of the month, additional reports indicated that ''Comet'' would be set around 1758 in New York, as well as feature sailing on the Atlantic Ocean.

One day a stranger appears, a Chinese female Assassin called [[Shao Jun]], who came to Ezio in order to seek knowledge of his life as an Assassin. Although Ezio prefers that Jun not stay, due to his desire to leave his days as an Assassin behind, Sofia allows her to stay for the night. The next day, Ezio catches Jun reading his memoirs and bids her to leave, but relents after she asks him about what it means to be an Assassin. While on a trip to [[Firenze]], Ezio recounts his story of how his father and brothers were executed in the town square, forcing him to become an Assassin (the events of ''[[Assassin's Creed II#Plot|Assassin's Creed II]]''), and how such a life is defined by the pain it brings and causes. As they leave, the two are attacked by a stranger, who appears to be of Asian origin as well. After killing him, Jun reveals that she was a former [[concubine]], now on the run from servants of the Chinese [[Zhengde Emperor]], and explains how her former master rescued her from his influence. After returning to his home, Ezio tells Sofia and his children to leave, knowing that others would come. He then teaches Jun the key to liberating her people from the Emperor's influence. Later that night, Ezio's villa is attacked by more of Shao Jun's enemies, and after a fight, he successfully eliminates them all. The next morning, Ezio hands Shao Jun a small box and tells her it may come to use one day, but only if \"you lose your way\". He then sends her away as two riders appear at the villa. Sometime afterward Ezio journeys to Firenze with his wife Sofia and their daughter Flavia, despite suffering from heart problems. While resting on a bench and after having a short conversation with a young man with a scar on his face, similar to the sort of man he used to be, he exhales and dies in view of his family. The film then ends as a final letter from Ezio to Sofia is read, saying that of all the things that kept him going throughout life, love for the world around him was the strongest of them all.\n\n===Comics===\n<!-- [[Assassin's Creed (comics)]] redirects here. -->\n\n====''Assassin's Creed: Graphic Novel''====\nIn the limited edition of ''Assassin's Creed'', an 8-page [[graphic novel]] was included, that showed two side-stories of Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad and Desmond Miles.
