This assessment was developed over the span of a decade by [[Dean Delis]], [[Edith Kaplan]], and Joel Kramer, and it was published in 2001. The D-KEFS comprises nine tests that were designed to stand alone. Therefore, there are no aggregate measures or composite scores for an examinee's performance. A vast majority of these tests are modified, pre-existing measures (e.g., the [[Trail Making Test]]); however, some of these measures are new indices of executive functions (e.g., Word Context Test).\n\n==Nine tests==\nThis measure consists of the following subtests:\n\n* The ''Trail Making Test'' measures flexibility of thinking on a visual-motor sequencing task\n* The ''Verbal Fluency Test'' measures letter fluency, category fluency, and category switching\n* The ''Design Fluency Test'' measures one's initiation of problem-solving behavior, fluency in generating visual patterns, creativity in drawing new designs, simultaneous processing in drawing the designs while observing the rules and restrictions of the task, and inhibiting previously drawn responses\n* The ''Color-Word Interference Test'' measures ability to inhibit a dominant and automatic verbal response\n* The ''Sorting Test'' measures concept-formation skills, modality-specific problem-solving skills (verbal/nonverbal), and the ability to explain sorting concepts abstractly\n* The ''Twenty Questions Test'' measures the ability to categorize, formulate abstract, yes/no questions, and incorporate the examiner's feedback to formulate more efficient yes/no questions\n* The ''Word Context Test'' measures verbal modality, deductive reasoning, integration of multiple bits of information, hypothesis testing, and flexibility of thinking\n* The ''Tower Test'' measures spatial planning, rule learning, inhibition of impulsive and perseverative responding, and the ability to establish and maintain instructional set\n* The ''Proverb Test'' measures one's ability to form novel, verbal abstractions\n\nThese 9 subtests generate 16 main achievement scores and hundreds of optional error, contrast, accuracy, and time-interval scores. As such, use of the computerized scoring assistant (available for purchase from the test publisher) makes scoring the measure less time consuming.\n\nThis assessment was normed with a representative sample.<ref name=\"Shunk A W, Davis A W, Dean R S 2006 275\u2013279\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Shunk AW, Davis AW, Dean RS |title=.

[[neuropsychological test]] used to measure a variety of verbal and nonverbal [[executive functions]] for both children and adults (ages 8\u201389 years). This assessment was developed over the span of a decade by [[Dean Delis]], [[Edith Kaplan]], and Joel Kramer, and it was published in 2001. The D-KEFS comprises nine tests that were designed to stand alone. Therefore, there are no aggregate measures or composite scores for an examinee's performance. A vast majority of these tests are modified, pre-existing measures (e.g., the [[Trail Making Test]]); however, some of these measures are new indices of executive functions (e.g., Word Context Test).\n\n==Nine tests==\nThis measure consists of the following subtests:\n\n* The ''Trail Making Test'' measures flexibility of thinking on a visual-motor sequencing task\n* The ''Verbal Fluency Test'' measures letter fluency, category fluency, and category switching\n* The ''Design Fluency Test'' measures one's initiation of problem-solving behavior, fluency in generating visual patterns, creativity in drawing new designs, simultaneous processing in drawing the designs while observing the rules and restrictions of the task, and inhibiting previously drawn responses\n* The ''Color-Word Interference Test'' measures ability to inhibit a dominant and automatic verbal response\n* The ''Sorting Test'' measures concept-formation skills, modality-specific problem-solving skills (verbal/nonverbal), and the ability to explain sorting concepts abstractly\n* The ''Twenty Questions Test'' measures the ability to categorize, formulate abstract, yes/no questions, and incorporate the examiner's feedback to formulate more efficient yes/no questions\n* The ''Word Context Test'' measures verbal modality, deductive reasoning, integration of multiple bits of information, hypothesis testing, and flexibility of thinking\n* The ''Tower Test'' measures spatial planning, rule learning, inhibition of impulsive and perseverative responding, and the ability to establish and maintain instructional set\n* The ''Proverb Test'' measures one's ability to form novel, verbal abstractions\n\nThese 9 subtests generate 16 main achievement scores and hundreds of optional error, contrast, accuracy, and time-interval scores. As such, use of the computerized scoring assistant (available for purchase from the test publisher) makes scoring the measure less time consuming.\n\nThis assessment was normed with a representative sample.<ref name=\"Shunk A W, Davis A W, Dean R S 2006 275\u2013279\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Shunk AW, Davis AW, Dean RS |title=.

A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] for much of his career, Buchanan served as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and represented Pennsylvania in both houses of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] before becoming President.\n\nBorn in [[Cove Gap, Pennsylvania]], Buchanan became a prominent lawyer and won election to the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]] as a [[Federalist Party|Federalist]]. In 1820, he won election to the U.S. House of Representatives, aligning with [[Andrew Jackson]]'s Democratic Party. He served as Jackson's [[List of ambassadors of the United States to Russia|Minister to Russia]], then won election as a [[List of United States Senators from Pennsylvania|U.S. senator from Pennsylvania]]. In 1845, he was appointed to serve as President [[James K. Polk]]'s [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. He was a major contender for his party's presidential nomination throughout the 1840s and 1850s and was finally nominated in 1856, defeating incumbent President [[Franklin Pierce]] and Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] at the [[1856 Democratic National Convention]]. Buchanan and running mate [[John C. Breckinridge]] of Kentucky defeated Republican [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] and [[Know-Nothing]] former president [[Millard Fillmore]] to win the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]].\n\nPresident Buchanan supported the [[Dred Scott]] decision and joined with Southern leaders in attempting to admit [[Kansas]] to the Union as a slave state under the [[Lecompton Constitution]]. In the process, he angered Republicans and alienated many Northern Democrats. Buchanan held to his pledge to serve only one term and supported Breckinridge's unsuccessful candidacy in the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]]. Several Southern states seceded from the U.S. after [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the 1860 election, and the American Civil War began just weeks after Buchanan left office. Historians fault him for his failure to address the issue of slavery and the secession of the Southern states, and generally consider him to be [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|one of the worst presidents in U.S. history]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Buchanan Home Mercersburg.jpg|thumb|left|Buchanan's log cabin birthplace, relocated to [[Mercersburg, Pennsylvania]]]]\nJames Buchanan was born in a [[log cabin]] in [[Cove Gap, Pennsylvania]] (now [[Buchanan's Birthplace State Park]]), in [[Franklin County, Pennsylvania|Franklin County]], on April 23, 1791, to James Buchanan Sr., a businessman, merchant, and farmer, and Elizabeth Speer, an educated woman.<ref name=ancestry>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~dav4is/ODTs/BUCHANAN.shtml|title=Buchanan Family 1430&nbsp;\u2013 1903|publisher=ancestry.com|access-date=2012-04-28}}</ref> His parents were both of [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scot]] descent, his father having emigrated from [[Milford, County Donegal]], [[Ireland]], in 1783. Shortly after Buchanan's birth the family moved to a farm near [[Mercersburg, Pennsylvania]], and in 1794 the family moved to town. Buchanan's father became the wealthiest person in town, as a merchant, farmer, and real estate investor.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=9\u201312}}\n\nBuchanan attended the village's Old Stone Academy and then [[Dickinson College]] in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=12}} Though he was nearly expelled at one point for poor behavior, he pleaded for a second chance and graduated with honors on September 19, 1809.{{sfn|Klein|1962|pp=9\u201312}} Later that year, he moved to [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], the capital of Pennsylvania. James Hopkins, the most prominent lawyer in Lancaster, accepted Buchanan as an [[Reading law|apprentice]], and in 1812 Buchanan was admitted to the [[Pennsylvania Bar Association|Pennsylvania bar]] after an oral exam. Though many other lawyers moved to [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], after it became the capital of Pennsylvania in 1812, Lancaster would remain Buchanan's home town for the rest of his life. Buchanan's income rapidly rose after he established his own practice and by 1821 he was earning over $11,000 per year ({{Inflation|US|11,000|1821|r=-4|fmt=eq}}). Buchanan handled various types of cases, including a high-profile impeachment trial in which he successfully defended Pennsylvania Judge [[Walter Franklin (judge)|Walter Franklin]].{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=13\u201316}}\n\nBuchanan began his political career in the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]] (1814\u20131816) as a member of the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]].{{sfn|Curtis|1883|p=22}} The legislature met for only three months a year, and Buchanan's notoriety as a legislator helped him add clients to his practice.{{sfn|Baker|2004|p=18}} Like his father, Buchanan believed in federally-funded [[internal improvements]], a high [[Tariffs in United States history|tariff]], and a [[History of central banking in the United States|national bank]]. He emerged as a strong critic of the leadership of [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] President [[James Madison]] during the [[War of 1812]].{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=17\u201318}}\n\nAn active [[Freemason]], he was the Master of [[Masonic Lodge]] No. 43 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and a District Deputy [[Master Mason|Grand Master]] of the [[Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=27}}\n\n===Military service===\n\nWhen the British invaded neighboring [[Maryland]] in 1814, he served in the defense of [[Battle of Baltimore|Baltimore]] after enlisting as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in Henry Shippen's [[Company (military unit)|Company]], 1st Brigade, 4th Division, Pennsylvania Militia, a unit of [[J\u00e4ger (infantry)|yagers]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Montgomery|first=Thomas Lynch|date=1907|title=Pennsylvania Archives: Sixth Series|volume=VII|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zmtIAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA2-PA906|location=Harrisburg, PA|publisher=Harrisburg Publishing Company|page=906}}</ref> or light [[Dragoon#United States|dragoons]].{{sfn|Baker|2004|p=18}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=James|editor-last=Moore|editor-first=John Bassett|date=1911|title=The Works of James Buchanan|volume=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MSfVAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA294|location=Philadelphia, PA|publisher=J.

After the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]], Buchanan helped organize Jackson's followers into the Democratic Party, and he became a prominent Pennsylvania Democrat. In Washington, he became personally close with many southern Congressmen, including [[William R. King]] of Alabama. Buchanan tended to view many New England Congressmen as dangerous radicals. He was appointed to the Committee of Agriculture in his first year, and he eventually became Chairman of the [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary]], leading impeachment proceedings of Judge [[James H. Peck]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Missouri]], arguing that Peck had abused his position. Peck was acquitted by the Senate. Buchanan declined re-nomination to a sixth term, briefly returning to private life.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=23\u201330}}\n\n[[File:James Buchanan painted by J. Eichholtz.jpg|right|thumb|1834 portrait of Buchanan by [[Jacob Eichholtz]]]]\n\n[[File:James Buchanan sculpture at National Portrait Gallery IMG 4538.JPG|right|thumb|Bust of James Buchanan by [[Henry Dexter (sculptor)|Henry Dexter]] at the National Portrait Gallery]]\n\nAfter Jackson's [[1832 United States presidential election|re-election in 1832]], the president offered Buchanan the position of [[United States Ambassador to Russia]]. Buchanan was reluctant to leave the country but ultimately agreed. He served as ambassador for 18 months, during which time he learned [[French language|French]] (the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of diplomacy in the nineteenth century) and helped negotiate commercial and maritime treaties with the [[Russian Empire]].{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=30\u201331}}\n\n===Senate service===\nBuchanan returned to the United States and was elected to the United States Senate by the state legislature to succeed [[William Wilkins (U.S. politician)|William Wilkins]], who had himself replaced Buchanan as the ambassador to Russia. Buchanan won re-election in 1836 and 1842. The Jacksonian Buchanan opposed the re-chartering of the [[Second Bank of the United States]] and sought to expunge a congressional censure of Jackson stemming from the [[Bank War]]. He also opposed the [[gag rule#United States|gag rule]], stating, \"We have just as little right to interfere with slavery in the South, as we have to touch the right of petition.\" Buchanan thought that the issue of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] was the domain of the states, and he faulted [[abolitionist]]s for exciting passions over the issue. His support of states' rights was matched by his support for [[Manifest Destiny]], and he opposed the [[Webster\u2013Ashburton Treaty]] for its \"surrender\" of lands to the [[United Kingdom]]. Buchanan also argued for the annexation of both Texas and the [[Oregon Country]]. In the lead-up to the [[1844 Democratic National Convention]], Buchanan positioned himself as a potential alternative to former President [[Martin Van Buren]], but the nomination instead went to James K. Polk.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=30\u201338}}\n\n===Secretary of State===\nPolk shared many of Buchanan's foreign policy views, and Buchanan was offered the position of Secretary of State in the Polk administration. Though he considered the alternative of serving on the Supreme Court, Buchanan accepted as Secretary of State throughout Polk's lone term in office. During that time, Polk and Buchanan nearly doubled the territory of the United States through the [[Oregon Treaty]] and the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. In negotiations with Britain over Oregon, Buchanan at first advised a compromise, but later advocated for annexation of the entire territory. Eventually, Buchanan assented to a division at the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]]. After the outbreak of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], Buchanan advised Polk against taking territory south of the [[Rio Grande River]] and [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico|New Mexico]]. However, as the war came to an end, Buchanan argued for the annexation of further territory, annoying Polk, who suspected that Buchanan was primarily concerned with eventually becoming president. Buchanan did quietly seek nomination at the [[1848 Democratic National Convention]], as Polk had promised to serve only one term, but the nomination went to Senator [[Lewis Cass]] of Michigan.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=38\u201343}}\n\n===Ambassador to the United Kingdom===\nWith the [[1848 United States presidential election|1848 election]] of Whig [[Zachary Taylor]], Buchanan returned to private life. He bought the house of [[Wheatland (James Buchanan House)|Wheatland]] on the outskirts of Lancaster, entertained various visitors, and continued to follow political events.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=43\u201351}} In 1852, he was named president of the Board of Trustees of [[Franklin and Marshall College]] in Lancaster, and he served in this capacity until 1866, despite a false report that he was fired.{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=210, 415}} He quietly campaigned for the 1852 Democratic presidential nomination, writing a public letter that deplored the [[Wilmot Proviso]] as divisive and fanatical. Buchanan became known as a \"[[doughface]]\" due to his sympathy towards the South. At the [[1852 Democratic National Convention]], Buchanan won the support of many southern delegates but failed to win the two-thirds support needed for the presidential nomination, which went to [[Franklin Pierce]]. Buchanan declined to serve as the vice presidential nominee, and the convention instead nominated Buchanan's close friend, William King. Pierce won the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 election]], and Buchanan accepted the position of [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom]].{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=51\u201358}}\n\nBuchanan sailed for England in the summer of 1853, and he remained abroad for the next three years. In 1850, the United States and Great Britain had signed the [[Clayton\u2013Bulwer Treaty]], which committed both countries to joint control of any future canal that would connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through Central America. Buchanan met repeatedly with [[George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon|Lord Clarendon]], the British foreign minister, in hopes of pressuring the British to withdraw from Central America. He also continued to focus on the potential annexation of [[Cuba]], which had long preoccupied him.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=58\u201365}} At Pierce's insistence, Buchanan, U.S. Ambassador to Spain [[Pierre Soul\u00e9]], and U.S. Ambassador to France [[John Y. Mason|John Mason]] met in [[Ostend]], [[Belgium]], and drafted a memorandum that became known as the [[Ostend Manifesto]]. The document proposed the purchase from Spain of Cuba, then in the midst of revolution and near bankruptcy, declaring the island \"as necessary to the North American republic as any of its present ... family of states.\" Against Buchanan's recommendation, the final draft of the manifesto suggested that \"wresting it from Spain\" if Spain refused to sell would be justified \"by every law, human and Divine.\"{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=110}} The manifesto, generally considered a blunder, was never acted upon, but weakened the Pierce administration and support for [[Manifest Destiny]].{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=110}}{{sfn|Tucker|2009|pp=456\u201357}}\n\n==Presidential election of 1856==\n[[File:PresidentialCounty1856Colorbrewer.gif|right|thumb|upright=1.8|Results by county, indicating the percentage for the winning candidate.

Douglas]] also loomed as a strong candidate. Buchanan led on the first ballot, boosted by the support of powerful Senators [[John Slidell]], [[Jesse Bright]], and [[Thomas F. Bayard]], who presented Buchanan as an experienced leader who could appeal to the North and South. Buchanan won the nomination after seventeen ballots, and was joined on the ticket by [[John C. Breckinridge]] of Kentucky.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=69\u201370}}\n\n[[File:DemocraticPlatform1856Cartoon.jpg|thumb|left|An anti-Buchanan political cartoon from the 1856 election]]\n\nBuchanan faced two candidates in the general election: former Whig President [[Millard Fillmore]] ran as the American Party (or \"[[Know-Nothing]]\") candidate, while [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] ran as the [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] nominee. Buchanan did not actively campaign, but he wrote letters and pledged to uphold the Democratic platform. In the election, Buchanan carried every slave state except for Maryland, as well as five free states, including his home state of Pennsylvania. He won 45 percent of the popular vote and, most importantly, won the electoral vote, taking 174 electoral votes compared to Fr\u00e9mont's 114 electoral votes and Fillmore's 8 electoral votes. Buchanan's election made him the first and only president from Pennsylvania. He would also be the last person [[List of Presidents of the United States by date and place of birth|born in the 18th century to serve as president]]. In his victory speech, Buchanan denounced Republicans, calling them a \"dangerous\" and \"geographical\" party that had unfairly attacked the South.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=70\u201373}} President-elect Buchanan also declared, \"the object of my administration will be to destroy sectional party, North or South, and to restore harmony to the Union under a national and conservative government.\"{{sfn|Klein|1962|pp=261\u2013262}} He set about this initially by maintaining a sectional balance in his appointments and persuading the people to accept constitutional law as the Supreme Court interpreted it. The court was considering the legality of restricting slavery in the territories and two justices had hinted to Buchanan their findings.{{sfn|Chadwick|2008|p=48}}\n\n==Presidency (1857\u20131861)==\n{{Main|Presidency of James Buchanan}}\n\n===Inauguration===\n{{Main|Inauguration of James Buchanan}}\n[[File:James Buchanan inauguration 1857.jpg|thumb|Inauguration of James Buchanan, March 4, 1857, from a photograph by [[John Wood (photographer)|John Wood]]: Buchanan's [[United States presidential inauguration|inauguration]] was the first to be recorded in a photograph.]]\n\nBuchanan was inaugurated on March 4, 1857, taking the oath of office from [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Roger B. Taney]]. In his inaugural address, Buchanan committed himself to serving only one term, though Pierce had made the same commitment. Buchanan also deplored the growing divisions over slavery and its status in the territories. Stating that Congress should play no role in determining the status of slavery in the states or territories, Buchanan argued for popular sovereignty. Furthermore, Buchanan argued that a federal slave code should protect the rights of slave-owners in any federal territory. He alluded to a pending Supreme Court case, ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'', which he stated would permanently settle the issue of slavery. In fact, Buchanan already knew the outcome of the case, and had even played a part in its disposition.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=80\u201383, 85}}\n\n===Personnel===\n====Cabinet and administration====\n{{Infobox U.S. Cabinet\n|align=left\n|clear=yes\n|Name=Buchanan\n|President=James Buchanan\n|President start=1857\n|President end=1861\n|Vice President=[[John C.

Buchanan chose four southerners and three northerners, the latter of whom were all considered to be [[doughface]]s. Buchanan sought to be the clear leader of the cabinet, and chose men who would agree with his views. Concentrating on foreign policy, he appointed the aging [[Lewis Cass]] as Secretary of State. Buchanan's appointment of southerners and southern sympathizers alienated many in the north, and his failure to appoint any followers of Stephen Douglas divided the party.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=77\u201380}} Outside of the cabinet, Buchanan left in place many of Pierce's appointments, but removed a disproportionate number of northerners who had ties to Pierce or Douglas.

He also appointed two Article I judges to the [[United States Court of Claims]].{{citation needed|date = March 2020}}\n\n===Dred Scott case===\nTwo days after Buchanan's inauguration, Chief Justice Taney delivered the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|''Dred Scott'' decision]], asserting that Congress had no [[U.S. Constitution|constitutional]] power to exclude slavery in the territories.{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=316}} Prior to his inauguration, Buchanan had written to Justice [[John Catron]] in January 1857, inquiring about the outcome of the case and suggesting that a broader decision would be more prudent.{{sfn|Klein|1962|pp=271\u2013272}} Catron, who was from Tennessee, replied on February 10 that the Supreme Court's southern majority would decide against Scott, but would likely have to publish the decision on narrow grounds if there was no support from the Court's northern justices\u2014unless Buchanan could convince his fellow Pennsylvanian, Justice [[Robert Cooper Grier]], to join the majority.{{sfn|Hall|2001|p=566}} Buchanan hoped that a broad Supreme Court decision protecting slavery in the territories could lay the issue to rest once and for all, allowing the country to focus on other issues, including the possible annexation of Cuba and the acquisition of more Mexican territory.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=83\u201384}} So Buchanan wrote to Grier and successfully prevailed upon him, allowing the majority leverage to issue a broad-ranging decision that transcended the specific circumstances of Scott's case to declare the [[Missouri Compromise of 1820]] unconstitutional.{{sfn|Armitage|Faragher|Buhle|Czitrom|2005|p=388}}{{sfn|Baker|2004|p=85}} The correspondence was not public at the time; however, at his inauguration, Buchanan was seen in whispered conversation with Chief Justice Roger B. Taney. When the decision was issued two days later, Republicans began spreading word that Taney had revealed to Buchanan the forthcoming result. Buchanan had hoped that the ''Dred Scott'' decision would destroy the Republican platform, but outraged northerners denounced the decision.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=85\u201386}}\n\n===Panic of 1857===\nThe [[Panic of 1857]] began in the summer of that year, ushered in by the collapse of 1,400 state banks and 5,000 businesses. While the South escaped largely unscathed, numerous northern cities experienced drastic increases in unemployment. Buchanan agreed with the southerners who attributed the economic collapse to overspeculation.{{sfn|Baker|2004|p=90}}\n\nReflecting his Jacksonian background, Buchanan's response was \"reform not relief.\" While the government was \"without the power to extend relief,\"{{sfn|Baker|2004|p=90}} it would continue to pay its debts in specie, and while it would not curtail public works, none would be added. He urged the states to restrict the banks to a credit level of $3 to $1 of specie and discouraged the use of federal or state bonds as security for bank note issues. The economy eventually recovered, though many Americans suffered as a result of the panic.{{sfn|Klein|1962|pp=314\u2013315}} Though Buchanan had hoped to reduce the deficit, by the time he left office the federal deficit stood at $17&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Baker|2004|p=90}}\n\n===Utah War===\n{{Main|Utah War|Runaway Officials of 1851}}\n[[Utah]] territory had been settled by adherents of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in the decades preceding Buchanan's presidency, and under the leadership of [[Brigham Young]] the Latter-day Saints had grown increasingly hostile to federal intervention. Young harassed federal officers and discouraged outsiders from settling in the [[Salt Lake City]] area, and in September 1857, members of the [[Nauvoo Legion#In Utah|Utah Territorial Militia]] perpetrated the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]] against Arkansans headed for California. Buchanan was also personally offended by the [[Mormonism and polygamy|polygamous]] behavior of Young.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=90\u201391}}\n\nAccepting the wildest rumors and believing the Latter-day Saints to be in open rebellion against the United States, Buchanan sent the army in July 1857 to replace Young as governor with [[Alfred Cumming (governor)|Alfred Cumming]]. While the Latter-day Saints had frequently defied federal authority, some question whether Buchanan's action was a justifiable or prudent response to uncorroborated reports.{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=316}} Complicating matters, Young's notice of his replacement was not delivered because the Pierce administration had annulled the Utah mail contract.{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=316}} After Young reacted to the military action by mustering a two-week expedition destroying wagon trains, oxen, and other Army property, Buchanan dispatched [[Thomas L. Kane]] as a private agent to negotiate peace. The mission succeeded, the new governor was shortly placed in office, and the [[Utah War]] ended. The President granted amnesty to all inhabitants who would respect the authority of the government, and moved the federal troops to a nonthreatening distance for the balance of his administration.{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=317}} Though he and the Latter-day Saints continued to practice polygamy, Young largely accepted federal authority after the conclusion of the Utah War.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=92\u201393}}\n\n===Bleeding Kansas===\n[[File:US SlaveFree1858.gif|thumb|upright=1.6|The balance of free and slave states and territories in 1858, after the admission of [[Minnesota]]]]\nThe [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] of 1854 created the [[Kansas Territory]] and allowed the settlers there to choose whether to allow slavery. This resulted in violence between \"[[Free-Soil]]\" (antislavery) and proslavery settlers in what became known as the \"[[Bleeding Kansas]]\" crisis. The antislavery settlers organized a government in [[Topeka]], while proslavery settlers established a seat of government in [[Lecompton, Kansas]]. For Kansas to be admitted as a state, a constitution had to be submitted to Congress with the approval of a majority of residents. Under President Pierce, a series of violent confrontations known as \"Bleeding Kansas\" escalated as supporters of the two governments clashed. The situation in Kansas was watched closely throughout the country, and some in Georgia and Mississippi advocated secession should Kansas be admitted as a free state. Buchanan himself did not particularly care whether or not Kansas entered as a slave state, and instead sought to admit Kansas as a state as soon as possible since it would likely tilt towards the Democratic Party. Rather than restarting the process and establishing one territorial government, Buchanan chose to recognize the Lecompton government.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=93\u201398}}\n\nUpon taking office, Buchanan appointed [[Robert J. Walker]] to replace [[John W. Geary]] as territorial governor, with the mission of reconciling the settler factions and approving a constitution. Walker, who was from Mississippi, was expected to assist the proslavery faction in gaining approval of a new constitution.{{sfn|Potter|1976|pp=297\u2013327}} However, after months in office, Walker came to believe that slavery was unsuited for the region and thought that Kansas would ultimately become a free state. In October 1857, the Lecompton government organized territorial elections that were so marked by fraud that Walker threw out the returns from several counties. Nonetheless, that same month, the Lecompton government framed the pro-slavery [[Lecompton Constitution]] and, rather than risking a referendum, sent it directly to Buchanan. Though eager for Kansas statehood, even Buchanan was forced to reject the entrance of Kansas without a state constitutional referendum, and he dispatched federal agents to bring about a compromise. The Lecompton government agreed to a limited referendum in which Kansas would vote not on the constitution overall, but rather merely on whether or not Kansas would allow slavery after becoming a state. The Topeka government boycotted the December 1857 referendum, and slavery overwhelmingly won the approval of those who did vote. A month later, the Topeka government held its own referendum in which voters overwhelmingly rejected the Lecompton Constitution.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=97\u2013100}}\n\nDespite the protests of Walker and two former governors of Kansas, Buchanan decided to accept the Lecompton Constitution. In a December 1857 meeting with Stephen Douglas, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Territories and an important northern Democrat, Buchanan demanded that all Democrats support the administration's position of admitting Kansas under the Lecompton Constitution. On February 2, Buchanan transmitted the Lecompton Constitution to Congress. He also transmitted a message that attacked the \"revolutionary government\" in Topeka, conflating them with the Mormons in Utah. Buchanan made every effort to secure congressional approval, offering favors, patronage appointments, and even cash for votes. The Lecompton Constitution won the approval of the Senate in March, but a combination of Know-Nothings, Republicans, and northern Democrats defeated the bill in the House. Rather than accepting defeat, Buchanan backed the [[English Bill (1858)|English Bill]], which offered Kansans immediate statehood and vast public lands in exchange for accepting the Lecompton Constitution. In August 1858, a Kansas referendum strongly rejected the Lecompton Constitution.{{Sfn|Baker|2004|pp=100\u2013105}}\n\nThe battle over Kansas escalated into a battle for control of the Democratic Party. On one side were Buchanan, most Southern Democrats, and northern Democrats allied to the Southerners (\"Doughfaces\"); on the other side were Douglas and most northern Democrats plus a few Southerners. Douglas's faction continued to support the doctrine of popular sovereignty, while Buchanan insisted that Democrats respect the ''Dred Scott'' decision and its repudiation of federal interference with slavery in the territories.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=120\u2013121}} The struggle lasted the remainder of Buchanan's presidency. Buchanan used his patronage powers to remove Douglas sympathizers in Illinois and Washington, D.C., and installed pro-administration Democrats, including postmasters.{{sfn|Chadwick|2008|p=91}}\n\n===1858 mid-term elections===\nDouglas's Senate term ended in 1859, so the Illinois legislature elected in 1858 would determine whether Douglas would win re-election. The Senate election was the primary issue of the legislative election, marked by the famous [[Lincoln-Douglas debates]]. Buchanan, working through federal patronage appointees in Illinois, ran candidates for the legislature in competition with both the Republicans and the Douglas Democrats. This could easily have thrown the election to the Republicans \u2013 which showed the depth of Buchanan's animosity toward Douglas.{{sfn|Chadwick|2008|p=117}} In the end, Douglas Democrats won the legislative election and Douglas was re-elected to the Senate. In that year's elections, Douglas forces took control throughout the North, except in Buchanan's home state of Pennsylvania. Buchanan was reduced to a narrow base of southern supporters.{{sfn|Potter|1976|pp=297\u2013327}}{{sfn|Klein|1962|pp=286\u2013299}}\n\nThe division between northern and southern Democrats allowed the Republicans to win a plurality in the House in the [[1858 United States elections|elections of 1858]]. Their control of the chamber allowed the Republicans to block most of Buchanan's agenda. Buchanan, in turn, vetoed six substantial pieces of Republican legislation, causing further hostility between Congress and the White House.{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=312}} Among the pieces of legislation that Buchanan vetoed were the [[Homestead Acts|Homestead Act]], which would have given 160 acres of public land to settlers who remained on the land for five years, and the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Act]], which would have granted public lands to establish [[Land-grant university|land-grant colleges]]. Buchanan argued that these acts were beyond the power of the federal government as established by the Constitution.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\n===Foreign policy===\nBuchanan took office with an ambitious foreign policy intended to establish U.S. hegemony over Central America at the expense of Great Britain.{{sfn|Smith|1975|pp=69\u201370}} He hoped to re-negotiate the [[Clayton-Bulwer Treaty]], which he viewed as a mistake that limited U.S. influence in the region. He also sought to establish American protectorates over the Mexican states of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and [[Sonora]], and, perhaps most importantly, he hoped to finally achieve his long-term goal of acquiring Cuba. After long negotiations with the British, he convinced them to agree to cede the [[Bay Islands Department|Bay Islands]] to [[Honduras]] and the [[Mosquito Coast]] to [[Nicaragua]]. However, Buchanan's ambitions in Cuba and Mexico were largely blocked by the House of Representatives.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=107\u2013112}} Buchanan also considered buying Alaska from the [[Russian Empire]], possibly as a colony for Mormon settlers, but Buchanan and the Russians were unable to agree upon a price. In China, despite not taking direct part in the [[Second Opium War]], the Buchanan administration won trade concessions in the [[Treaty of Tientsin]].{{sfn|Smith|1975|pp=74\u201375}} In 1858, Buchanan ordered the [[Paraguay expedition]] to punish [[Paraguay]] for firing on the {{USS|Water Witch|1851|6}}, and the expedition resulted in a Paraguayan apology and the payment of an indemnity.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=107\u2013112}} The chiefs of [[Raiatea]] and [[Tahaa]] in the South Pacific, refusing to accept the rule of King [[Tamatoa V]], unsuccessfully petitioned the United States to accept the islands under a [[protectorate]] in June 1858.{{sfn|Flude|2012|pages=393\u2013413}}\n\nBuchanan was given a herd of elephants by the King of Siam.

The committee, with three Republicans and two Democrats, was accused by Buchanan's supporters of being nakedly partisan; they charged its chairman, Republican Rep. [[John Covode]], with acting on a personal grudge as to a disputed land grant designed to benefit Covode's railroad company.{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=338}} The Democratic committee members, as well as Democratic witnesses, were enthusiastic in their pursuit of Buchanan in their condemnations.{{sfn|Klein|1962|pp=338\u20139}}{{sfn|Grossman|2003|p=78}}\n\nThe committee was unable to establish grounds for impeaching Buchanan; however, the majority report issued on June 17 alleged corruption and abuse of power among members of his cabinet, and accusations from the Republican members of the Committee, that Buchanan had attempted to bribe members of Congress in connection with the Lecompton constitution. The Democratic report pointed out that evidence was scarce, but did not refute the allegations; one of the Democratic members, Rep. [[James Carroll Robinson|James Robinson]], stated that he agreed with the Republican report though he did not sign it.{{sfn|Grossman|2003|p=78}})\n\nBuchanan claimed to have \"passed triumphantly through this ordeal\" with complete vindication.

Although Douglas led after every ballot, he was unable to win the two-thirds majority required. The convention adjourned after 53 ballots, and re-convened in Baltimore in June. After Douglas finally won the nomination, several southerners refused to accept the outcome, and nominated Vice President Breckinridge as their own candidate. Douglas and Breckinridge agreed on most issues except the protection of slavery. Failing to reconcile the party, and nursing a grudge against Douglas, Buchanan tepidly supported Breckinridge. With the splintering of the Democratic Party, Republican nominee [[Abraham Lincoln]] won a four-way election that also included [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] of the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]]. Lincoln's support in the North was enough to give him an Electoral College majority. Buchanan was the last Democrat to win a presidential election until [[Grover Cleveland]] in 1884.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=118\u2013120}}\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1860.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|1860 electoral vote results]]\n\nAs early as October, the army's [[Commanding General of the United States Army|Commanding General]], [[Winfield Scott]], who was adversarial to the President, warned Buchanan that Lincoln's election would likely cause at least seven states to secede. He also recommended to Buchanan that massive amounts of federal troops and artillery be deployed to those states to protect federal property, although he also warned that few reinforcements were available. Congress had since 1857 failed to heed calls for a stronger militia and had allowed the army to fall into deplorable condition.{{sfn|Klein|1962|pp=356\u2013358}} Buchanan distrusted Scott and ignored his recommendations.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=76, 133}} After Lincoln's election, Buchanan directed War Secretary Floyd to reinforce southern forts with such provisions, arms and men as were available; however, Floyd convinced him to revoke the order.{{sfn|Klein|1962|pp=356\u2013358}}\n\n===Secession===\nWith Lincoln's victory, talk of secession and disunion reached a boiling point, and Buchanan was forced to address it in his final message to Congress.

He placed the blame for the crisis solely on \"intemperate interference of the Northern people with the question of slavery in the Southern States,\" and suggested that if they did not \"repeal their unconstitutional and obnoxious enactments ... the injured States, after having first used all peaceful and constitutional means to obtain redress, would be justified in revolutionary resistance to the Government of the Union.\"<ref name=1860message>[[#Buchanan1860|Buchanan (1860)]]</ref> Buchanan's only suggestion to solve the crisis was \"an explanatory amendment\" affirming the constitutionality of slavery in the states, the fugitive slave laws, and [[popular sovereignty]] in the territories.<ref name=1860message /> His address was sharply criticized both by the north, for its refusal to stop secession, and the south, for denying its right to secede.{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=363}} Five days after the address was delivered, Treasury Secretary [[Howell Cobb]] resigned, as his views had become irreconcilable with the President's.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Resignation of Secretary Cobb.

Buchanan as \"old buck\" tries in vain to herd states back into the Union.]]\n\nSouth Carolina, long the most radical southern state, seceded from the union on December 20, 1860. However, unionist sentiment remained strong among many in the South, and Buchanan sought to appeal to the southern moderates who might prevent secession in other states. He proposed passage of constitutional amendments protecting slavery in the states and territories. He also met with South Carolinian commissioners in an attempt to resolve the situation at [[Fort Sumter]], which federal forces remained in control of despite its location in Charleston, South Carolina. He refused to dismiss Interior Secretary Jacob Thompson after the latter was chosen as Mississippi's agent to discuss secession, and he refused to fire Secretary of War John B. Floyd despite an embezzlement scandal, though the latter did eventually resign. Before resigning, Floyd sent numerous firearms to southern states, where they would eventually fall into the hands of the Confederacy. Despite Floyd's resignation, Buchanan continued to meet to receive advice from counselors from the Deep South, including [[Jefferson Davis]] and [[William Henry Trescot]], who informed the South Carolina government about the content of his conversations with Buchanan. Other southern sympathizers also leaked the administration's plans.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=123\u2013134}}\n\nEfforts were made by statesmen such as Sen. [[John J. Crittenden]], Rep. [[Thomas Corwin]], and former president [[John Tyler]] to negotiate a compromise to stop secession, with Buchanan's support; all failed. Failed attempts were also made by a group of governors meeting in New York. Buchanan secretly employed a last-minute tactic to bring a solution, attempting in vain to procure President-elect Lincoln's call for a constitutional convention or national referendum to resolve the issue of slavery.{{sfn|Klein|1962|pp=381\u2013387}}\n\nDespite the efforts of Buchanan and others, six more [[Southern United States|slave states]] seceded by the end of January 1861. Buchanan replaced the departed southern cabinet members with [[John Adams Dix]], [[Edwin M. Stanton]], and [[Joseph Holt]], all of whom were committed to preserving the union. When Buchanan considered surrendering Fort Sumter, the new cabinet members threatened to resign, and Buchanan relented. On January 5, Buchanan finally decided to reinforce Fort Sumter, sending the ''[[Star of the West]]'' with 250 men and supplies. However, he failed to ask Major [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Robert Anderson]] to provide covering fire for the ship, and it was forced to return North without delivering troops or supplies. Buchanan chose not to respond to this act of war, and instead sought to find a compromise to avoid secession. Though a March 3 message from Anderson reached Buchanan, that Anderson's supplies were running low, Lincoln succeeded as president the following day, inheriting the emerging sectional crisis.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=135\u2013140}}\n\n===Proposed constitutional amendment===\n* March 2, 1861: Congress approved an amendment to the [[United States Constitution]] that would shield \"domestic institutions\" of the states, including slavery, from the constitutional amendment process and from abolition or interference by Congress, and submitted it to the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] for [[ratification]].

The Senate proposed a resolution of condemnation which ultimately failed, and newspapers accused him of colluding with the Confederacy. His former cabinet members, five of whom had been given jobs in the Lincoln administration, refused to defend Buchanan publicly.{{sfn|Klein|1962|pp=408\u2013413}}\n\nBuchanan became distraught by the vitriolic attacks levied towards him, and fell sick and depressed. In October 1862, Buchanan defended himself in an exchange of letters with [[Winfield Scott]], published in the ''[[National Intelligencer]]''.{{sfn|Klein|1962|pp=417\u2013418}} He soon began writing his fullest public defense, in the form of his memoir ''Mr. Buchanan's Administration on the Eve of Rebellion'', which was published in 1866.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=142\u2013143}}\n\n{{anchor|Death}}\nBuchanan caught a [[cold]] in May 1868, which quickly worsened due to his advanced age. He died on June 1, 1868, of [[respiratory failure]] at the age of 77 at his home at [[Wheatland (Lancaster)|Wheatland]] and was interred in [[Woodward Hill Cemetery]] in Lancaster.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=142\u2013143}}\n\n== Political views ==\n[[File:George Peter Alexander Healy - James Buchanan - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|James Buchanan (1859) by [[George Healy]] as seen in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] in Washington, DC]]\nIn the northern anti-slavery idiom of his day, Buchanan was often considered a \"doughface,\" a northern man with pro-southern principles.{{sfn|Stampp|1990|p=48}} Historian Kenneth Stampp wrote: \"Shortly after his election, he assured a southern Senator that the 'great object' of his administration would be 'to arrest, if possible, the agitation of the Slavery question in the North and to destroy sectional parties.'\"{{sfn|Stampp|1990|p=48}} Buchanan was irked that the abolitionists, in his view, were preventing the solution to the slavery problem. He stated, \"Before [the abolitionists] commenced this agitation, a very large and growing party existed in several of the slave states in favor of the gradual abolition of slavery; and now not a voice is heard there in support of such a measure. The abolitionists have postponed the emancipation of the slaves in three or four states for at least half a century.\"{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=150}} In deference to the intentions of the typical slaveholder, he was quick to provide the benefit of much doubt. In his third annual message, Buchanan claimed that the slaves were \"treated with kindness and humanity. ... Both the philanthropy and the self-interest of the master have combined to produce this humane result.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://millercenter.org/scripps/archive/speeches/detail/3734|title=Third Annual Message (December 19, 1859)|publisher=The Miller Center at the University of Virginia|access-date=2012-04-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106204449/http://millercenter.org/scripps/archive/speeches/detail/3734|archive-date=January 6, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nBuchanan considered the essence of good self-government was restraint. He considered the constitution comprised \"... restraints, imposed not by arbitrary authority, but by the people upon themselves and their representatives. ... In an enlarged view, the people's interests may seem identical, but \"to the eye of local and sectional prejudice, they always appear to be conflicting ... and the jealousies that will perpetually arise can be repressed only by the mutual forbearance which pervades the constitution.\"{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=143}} Regarding slavery and the Constitution, he stated: \"Although in Pennsylvania we are all opposed to slavery in the abstract, we can never violate the constitutional compact we have with our sister states. Their rights will be held sacred by us. Under the constitution it is their own question; and there let it remain.\"{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=150}}\n\nOne of the [[Tariffs in United States history|greatest issues of the day]] was [[tariff]]s.{{sfn|Jurinski|pages=16\u201317}} Buchanan was conflicted by [[free trade]] as well as [[Protective tariff|prohibitive tariffs]], since either would benefit one section of the country to the detriment of the other. As a senator from Pennsylvania, he said: \"I am viewed as the strongest advocate of protection in other states, whilst I am denounced as its enemy in Pennsylvania.\"{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=144}}\n\nBuchanan was also torn between his desire to expand the country for the benefit of all and his insistence on guaranteeing to the people settling the expanded areas their rights, including slavery. On territorial expansion, he said, \"What, sir? Prevent the people from crossing the [[Rocky Mountains]]? You might just as well command the [[Niagara Falls|Niagara]] not to flow. We must fulfill our destiny.\"{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=147}} On the resulting spread of slavery, through unconditional expansion, he stated: \"I feel a strong repugnance by any act of mine to extend the present limits of the Union over a new slave-holding territory.\" For instance, he hoped the acquisition of Texas would \"be the means of limiting, not enlarging, the dominion of slavery.\"{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=147}}\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:William Rufus King..jpg|thumb|[[William R.

A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] for much of his career, Buchanan served as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and represented Pennsylvania in both houses of the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] before becoming President.\n\nBorn in [[Cove Gap, Pennsylvania]], Buchanan became a prominent lawyer and won election to the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]] as a [[Federalist Party|Federalist]]. In 1820, he won election to the U.S. House of Representatives, aligning with [[Andrew Jackson]]'s Democratic Party. He served as Jackson's [[List of ambassadors of the United States to Russia|Minister to Russia]], then won election as a [[List of United States Senators from Pennsylvania|U.S. senator from Pennsylvania]]. In 1845, he was appointed to serve as President [[James K. Polk]]'s [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. He was a major contender for his party's presidential nomination throughout the 1840s and 1850s and was finally nominated in 1856, defeating incumbent President [[Franklin Pierce]] and Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] at the [[1856 Democratic National Convention]]. Buchanan and running mate [[John C. Breckinridge]] of Kentucky defeated Republican [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] and [[Know-Nothing]] former president [[Millard Fillmore]] to win the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]].\n\nPresident Buchanan supported the [[Dred Scott]] decision and joined with Southern leaders in attempting to admit [[Kansas]] to the Union as a slave state under the [[Lecompton Constitution]]. In the process, he angered Republicans and alienated many Northern Democrats. Buchanan held to his pledge to serve only one term and supported Breckinridge's unsuccessful candidacy in the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]]. Several Southern states seceded from the U.S. after [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] won the 1860 election, and the American Civil War began just weeks after Buchanan left office. Historians fault him for his failure to address the issue of slavery and the secession of the Southern states, and generally consider him to be [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|one of the worst presidents in U.S. history]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Buchanan Home Mercersburg.jpg|thumb|left|Buchanan's log cabin birthplace, relocated to [[Mercersburg, Pennsylvania]]]]\nJames Buchanan was born in a [[log cabin]] in [[Cove Gap, Pennsylvania]] (now [[Buchanan's Birthplace State Park]]), in [[Franklin County, Pennsylvania|Franklin County]], on April 23, 1791, to James Buchanan Sr., a businessman, merchant, and farmer, and Elizabeth Speer, an educated woman.<ref name=ancestry>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~dav4is/ODTs/BUCHANAN.shtml|title=Buchanan Family 1430&nbsp;\u2013 1903|publisher=ancestry.com|access-date=2012-04-28}}</ref> His parents were both of [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scot]] descent, his father having emigrated from [[Milford, County Donegal]], [[Ireland]], in 1783. Shortly after Buchanan's birth the family moved to a farm near [[Mercersburg, Pennsylvania]], and in 1794 the family moved to town. Buchanan's father became the wealthiest person in town, as a merchant, farmer, and real estate investor.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=9\u201312}}\n\nBuchanan attended the village's Old Stone Academy and then [[Dickinson College]] in [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=12}} Though he was nearly expelled at one point for poor behavior, he pleaded for a second chance and graduated with honors on September 19, 1809.{{sfn|Klein|1962|pp=9\u201312}} Later that year, he moved to [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], the capital of Pennsylvania. James Hopkins, the most prominent lawyer in Lancaster, accepted Buchanan as an [[Reading law|apprentice]], and in 1812 Buchanan was admitted to the [[Pennsylvania Bar Association|Pennsylvania bar]] after an oral exam. Though many other lawyers moved to [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], after it became the capital of Pennsylvania in 1812, Lancaster would remain Buchanan's home town for the rest of his life. Buchanan's income rapidly rose after he established his own practice and by 1821 he was earning over $11,000 per year ({{Inflation|US|11,000|1821|r=-4|fmt=eq}}). Buchanan handled various types of cases, including a high-profile impeachment trial in which he successfully defended Pennsylvania Judge [[Walter Franklin (judge)|Walter Franklin]].{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=13\u201316}}\n\nBuchanan began his political career in the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]] (1814\u20131816) as a member of the [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist Party]].{{sfn|Curtis|1883|p=22}} The legislature met for only three months a year, and Buchanan's notoriety as a legislator helped him add clients to his practice.{{sfn|Baker|2004|p=18}} Like his father, Buchanan believed in federally-funded [[internal improvements]], a high [[Tariffs in United States history|tariff]], and a [[History of central banking in the United States|national bank]]. He emerged as a strong critic of the leadership of [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] President [[James Madison]] during the [[War of 1812]].{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=17\u201318}}\n\nAn active [[Freemason]], he was the Master of [[Masonic Lodge]] No. 43 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and a District Deputy [[Master Mason|Grand Master]] of the [[Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=27}}\n\n===Military service===\n\nWhen the British invaded neighboring [[Maryland]] in 1814, he served in the defense of [[Battle of Baltimore|Baltimore]] after enlisting as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in Henry Shippen's [[Company (military unit)|Company]], 1st Brigade, 4th Division, Pennsylvania Militia, a unit of [[J\u00e4ger (infantry)|yagers]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Montgomery|first=Thomas Lynch|date=1907|title=Pennsylvania Archives: Sixth Series|volume=VII|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zmtIAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA2-PA906|location=Harrisburg, PA|publisher=Harrisburg Publishing Company|page=906}}</ref> or light [[Dragoon#United States|dragoons]].{{sfn|Baker|2004|p=18}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Buchanan|first=James|editor-last=Moore|editor-first=John Bassett|date=1911|title=The Works of James Buchanan|volume=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MSfVAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA294|location=Philadelphia, PA|publisher=J.

After the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]], Buchanan helped organize Jackson's followers into the Democratic Party, and he became a prominent Pennsylvania Democrat. In Washington, he became personally close with many southern Congressmen, including [[William R. King]] of Alabama. Buchanan tended to view many New England Congressmen as dangerous radicals. He was appointed to the Committee of Agriculture in his first year, and he eventually became Chairman of the [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary]], leading impeachment proceedings of Judge [[James H. Peck]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Missouri]], arguing that Peck had abused his position. Peck was acquitted by the Senate. Buchanan declined re-nomination to a sixth term, briefly returning to private life.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=23\u201330}}\n\n[[File:James Buchanan painted by J.

Buchanan was reluctant to leave the country but ultimately agreed. He served as ambassador for 18 months, during which time he learned [[French language|French]] (the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of diplomacy in the nineteenth century) and helped negotiate commercial and maritime treaties with the [[Russian Empire]].{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=30\u201331}}\n\n===Senate service===\nBuchanan returned to the United States and was elected to the United States Senate by the state legislature to succeed [[William Wilkins (U.S. politician)|William Wilkins]], who had himself replaced Buchanan as the ambassador to Russia. Buchanan won re-election in 1836 and 1842. The Jacksonian Buchanan opposed the re-chartering of the [[Second Bank of the United States]] and sought to expunge a congressional censure of Jackson stemming from the [[Bank War]]. He also opposed the [[gag rule#United States|gag rule]], stating, \"We have just as little right to interfere with slavery in the South, as we have to touch the right of petition.\" Buchanan thought that the issue of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] was the domain of the states, and he faulted [[abolitionist]]s for exciting passions over the issue. His support of states' rights was matched by his support for [[Manifest Destiny]], and he opposed the [[Webster\u2013Ashburton Treaty]] for its \"surrender\" of lands to the [[United Kingdom]]. Buchanan also argued for the annexation of both Texas and the [[Oregon Country]]. In the lead-up to the [[1844 Democratic National Convention]], Buchanan positioned himself as a potential alternative to former President [[Martin Van Buren]], but the nomination instead went to James K. Polk.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=30\u201338}}\n\n===Secretary of State===\nPolk shared many of Buchanan's foreign policy views, and Buchanan was offered the position of Secretary of State in the Polk administration. Though he considered the alternative of serving on the Supreme Court, Buchanan accepted as Secretary of State throughout Polk's lone term in office. During that time, Polk and Buchanan nearly doubled the territory of the United States through the [[Oregon Treaty]] and the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. In negotiations with Britain over Oregon, Buchanan at first advised a compromise, but later advocated for annexation of the entire territory. Eventually, Buchanan assented to a division at the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]]. After the outbreak of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], Buchanan advised Polk against taking territory south of the [[Rio Grande River]] and [[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico|New Mexico]]. However, as the war came to an end, Buchanan argued for the annexation of further territory, annoying Polk, who suspected that Buchanan was primarily concerned with eventually becoming president. Buchanan did quietly seek nomination at the [[1848 Democratic National Convention]], as Polk had promised to serve only one term, but the nomination went to Senator [[Lewis Cass]] of Michigan.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=38\u201343}}\n\n===Ambassador to the United Kingdom===\nWith the [[1848 United States presidential election|1848 election]] of Whig [[Zachary Taylor]], Buchanan returned to private life. He bought the house of [[Wheatland (James Buchanan House)|Wheatland]] on the outskirts of Lancaster, entertained various visitors, and continued to follow political events.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=43\u201351}} In 1852, he was named president of the Board of Trustees of [[Franklin and Marshall College]] in Lancaster, and he served in this capacity until 1866, despite a false report that he was fired.{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=210, 415}} He quietly campaigned for the 1852 Democratic presidential nomination, writing a public letter that deplored the [[Wilmot Proviso]] as divisive and fanatical. Buchanan became known as a \"[[doughface]]\" due to his sympathy towards the South. At the [[1852 Democratic National Convention]], Buchanan won the support of many southern delegates but failed to win the two-thirds support needed for the presidential nomination, which went to [[Franklin Pierce]]. Buchanan declined to serve as the vice presidential nominee, and the convention instead nominated Buchanan's close friend, William King. Pierce won the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 election]], and Buchanan accepted the position of [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom]].{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=51\u201358}}\n\nBuchanan sailed for England in the summer of 1853, and he remained abroad for the next three years. In 1850, the United States and Great Britain had signed the [[Clayton\u2013Bulwer Treaty]], which committed both countries to joint control of any future canal that would connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans through Central America. Buchanan met repeatedly with [[George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon|Lord Clarendon]], the British foreign minister, in hopes of pressuring the British to withdraw from Central America. He also continued to focus on the potential annexation of [[Cuba]], which had long preoccupied him.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=58\u201365}} At Pierce's insistence, Buchanan, U.S. Ambassador to Spain [[Pierre Soul\u00e9]], and U.S. Ambassador to France [[John Y. Mason|John Mason]] met in [[Ostend]], [[Belgium]], and drafted a memorandum that became known as the [[Ostend Manifesto]]. The document proposed the purchase from Spain of Cuba, then in the midst of revolution and near bankruptcy, declaring the island \"as necessary to the North American republic as any of its present ... family of states.\" Against Buchanan's recommendation, the final draft of the manifesto suggested that \"wresting it from Spain\" if Spain refused to sell would be justified \"by every law, human and Divine.\"{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=110}} The manifesto, generally considered a blunder, was never acted upon, but weakened the Pierce administration and support for [[Manifest Destiny]].{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=110}}{{sfn|Tucker|2009|pp=456\u201357}}\n\n==Presidential election of 1856==\n[[File:PresidentialCounty1856Colorbrewer.gif|right|thumb|upright=1.8|Results by county, indicating the percentage for the winning candidate.

Douglas]] also loomed as a strong candidate. Buchanan led on the first ballot, boosted by the support of powerful Senators [[John Slidell]], [[Jesse Bright]], and [[Thomas F. Bayard]], who presented Buchanan as an experienced leader who could appeal to the North and South. Buchanan won the nomination after seventeen ballots, and was joined on the ticket by [[John C. Breckinridge]] of Kentucky.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=69\u201370}}\n\n[[File:DemocraticPlatform1856Cartoon.jpg|thumb|left|An anti-Buchanan political cartoon from the 1856 election]]\n\nBuchanan faced two candidates in the general election: former Whig President [[Millard Fillmore]] ran as the American Party (or \"[[Know-Nothing]]\") candidate, while [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] ran as the [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] nominee. Buchanan did not actively campaign, but he wrote letters and pledged to uphold the Democratic platform. In the election, Buchanan carried every slave state except for Maryland, as well as five free states, including his home state of Pennsylvania. He won 45 percent of the popular vote and, most importantly, won the electoral vote, taking 174 electoral votes compared to Fr\u00e9mont's 114 electoral votes and Fillmore's 8 electoral votes. Buchanan's election made him the first and only president from Pennsylvania. He would also be the last person [[List of Presidents of the United States by date and place of birth|born in the 18th century to serve as president]]. In his victory speech, Buchanan denounced Republicans, calling them a \"dangerous\" and \"geographical\" party that had unfairly attacked the South.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=70\u201373}} President-elect Buchanan also declared, \"the object of my administration will be to destroy sectional party, North or South, and to restore harmony to the Union under a national and conservative government.\"{{sfn|Klein|1962|pp=261\u2013262}} He set about this initially by maintaining a sectional balance in his appointments and persuading the people to accept constitutional law as the Supreme Court interpreted it. The court was considering the legality of restricting slavery in the territories and two justices had hinted to Buchanan their findings.{{sfn|Chadwick|2008|p=48}}\n\n==Presidency (1857\u20131861)==\n{{Main|Presidency of James Buchanan}}\n\n===Inauguration===\n{{Main|Inauguration of James Buchanan}}\n[[File:James Buchanan inauguration 1857.jpg|thumb|Inauguration of James Buchanan, March 4, 1857, from a photograph by [[John Wood (photographer)|John Wood]]: Buchanan's [[United States presidential inauguration|inauguration]] was the first to be recorded in a photograph.]]\n\nBuchanan was inaugurated on March 4, 1857, taking the oath of office from [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Roger B. Taney]]. In his inaugural address, Buchanan committed himself to serving only one term, though Pierce had made the same commitment. Buchanan also deplored the growing divisions over slavery and its status in the territories. Stating that Congress should play no role in determining the status of slavery in the states or territories, Buchanan argued for popular sovereignty. Furthermore, Buchanan argued that a federal slave code should protect the rights of slave-owners in any federal territory. He alluded to a pending Supreme Court case, ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'', which he stated would permanently settle the issue of slavery. In fact, Buchanan already knew the outcome of the case, and had even played a part in its disposition.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=80\u201383, 85}}\n\n===Personnel===\n====Cabinet and administration====\n{{Infobox U.S. Cabinet\n|align=left\n|clear=yes\n|Name=Buchanan\n|President=James Buchanan\n|President start=1857\n|President end=1861\n|Vice President=[[John C.

Buchanan chose four southerners and three northerners, the latter of whom were all considered to be [[doughface]]s. Buchanan sought to be the clear leader of the cabinet, and chose men who would agree with his views. Concentrating on foreign policy, he appointed the aging [[Lewis Cass]] as Secretary of State. Buchanan's appointment of southerners and southern sympathizers alienated many in the north, and his failure to appoint any followers of Stephen Douglas divided the party.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=77\u201380}} Outside of the cabinet, Buchanan left in place many of Pierce's appointments, but removed a disproportionate number of northerners who had ties to Pierce or Douglas.

He also appointed two Article I judges to the [[United States Court of Claims]].{{citation needed|date = March 2020}}\n\n===Dred Scott case===\nTwo days after Buchanan's inauguration, Chief Justice Taney delivered the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|''Dred Scott'' decision]], asserting that Congress had no [[U.S. Constitution|constitutional]] power to exclude slavery in the territories.{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=316}} Prior to his inauguration, Buchanan had written to Justice [[John Catron]] in January 1857, inquiring about the outcome of the case and suggesting that a broader decision would be more prudent.{{sfn|Klein|1962|pp=271\u2013272}} Catron, who was from Tennessee, replied on February 10 that the Supreme Court's southern majority would decide against Scott, but would likely have to publish the decision on narrow grounds if there was no support from the Court's northern justices\u2014unless Buchanan could convince his fellow Pennsylvanian, Justice [[Robert Cooper Grier]], to join the majority.{{sfn|Hall|2001|p=566}} Buchanan hoped that a broad Supreme Court decision protecting slavery in the territories could lay the issue to rest once and for all, allowing the country to focus on other issues, including the possible annexation of Cuba and the acquisition of more Mexican territory.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=83\u201384}} So Buchanan wrote to Grier and successfully prevailed upon him, allowing the majority leverage to issue a broad-ranging decision that transcended the specific circumstances of Scott's case to declare the [[Missouri Compromise of 1820]] unconstitutional.{{sfn|Armitage|Faragher|Buhle|Czitrom|2005|p=388}}{{sfn|Baker|2004|p=85}} The correspondence was not public at the time; however, at his inauguration, Buchanan was seen in whispered conversation with Chief Justice Roger B. Taney. When the decision was issued two days later, Republicans began spreading word that Taney had revealed to Buchanan the forthcoming result. Buchanan had hoped that the ''Dred Scott'' decision would destroy the Republican platform, but outraged northerners denounced the decision.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=85\u201386}}\n\n===Panic of 1857===\nThe [[Panic of 1857]] began in the summer of that year, ushered in by the collapse of 1,400 state banks and 5,000 businesses. While the South escaped largely unscathed, numerous northern cities experienced drastic increases in unemployment. Buchanan agreed with the southerners who attributed the economic collapse to overspeculation.{{sfn|Baker|2004|p=90}}\n\nReflecting his Jacksonian background, Buchanan's response was \"reform not relief.\" While the government was \"without the power to extend relief,\"{{sfn|Baker|2004|p=90}} it would continue to pay its debts in specie, and while it would not curtail public works, none would be added. He urged the states to restrict the banks to a credit level of $3 to $1 of specie and discouraged the use of federal or state bonds as security for bank note issues. The economy eventually recovered, though many Americans suffered as a result of the panic.{{sfn|Klein|1962|pp=314\u2013315}} Though Buchanan had hoped to reduce the deficit, by the time he left office the federal deficit stood at $17&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Baker|2004|p=90}}\n\n===Utah War===\n{{Main|Utah War|Runaway Officials of 1851}}\n[[Utah]] territory had been settled by adherents of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in the decades preceding Buchanan's presidency, and under the leadership of [[Brigham Young]] the Latter-day Saints had grown increasingly hostile to federal intervention. Young harassed federal officers and discouraged outsiders from settling in the [[Salt Lake City]] area, and in September 1857, members of the [[Nauvoo Legion#In Utah|Utah Territorial Militia]] perpetrated the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]] against Arkansans headed for California. Buchanan was also personally offended by the [[Mormonism and polygamy|polygamous]] behavior of Young.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=90\u201391}}\n\nAccepting the wildest rumors and believing the Latter-day Saints to be in open rebellion against the United States, Buchanan sent the army in July 1857 to replace Young as governor with [[Alfred Cumming (governor)|Alfred Cumming]]. While the Latter-day Saints had frequently defied federal authority, some question whether Buchanan's action was a justifiable or prudent response to uncorroborated reports.{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=316}} Complicating matters, Young's notice of his replacement was not delivered because the Pierce administration had annulled the Utah mail contract.{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=316}} After Young reacted to the military action by mustering a two-week expedition destroying wagon trains, oxen, and other Army property, Buchanan dispatched [[Thomas L. Kane]] as a private agent to negotiate peace. The mission succeeded, the new governor was shortly placed in office, and the [[Utah War]] ended. The President granted amnesty to all inhabitants who would respect the authority of the government, and moved the federal troops to a nonthreatening distance for the balance of his administration.{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=317}} Though he and the Latter-day Saints continued to practice polygamy, Young largely accepted federal authority after the conclusion of the Utah War.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=92\u201393}}\n\n===Bleeding Kansas===\n[[File:US SlaveFree1858.gif|thumb|upright=1.6|The balance of free and slave states and territories in 1858, after the admission of [[Minnesota]]]]\nThe [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] of 1854 created the [[Kansas Territory]] and allowed the settlers there to choose whether to allow slavery. This resulted in violence between \"[[Free-Soil]]\" (antislavery) and proslavery settlers in what became known as the \"[[Bleeding Kansas]]\" crisis. The antislavery settlers organized a government in [[Topeka]], while proslavery settlers established a seat of government in [[Lecompton, Kansas]]. For Kansas to be admitted as a state, a constitution had to be submitted to Congress with the approval of a majority of residents. Under President Pierce, a series of violent confrontations known as \"Bleeding Kansas\" escalated as supporters of the two governments clashed. The situation in Kansas was watched closely throughout the country, and some in Georgia and Mississippi advocated secession should Kansas be admitted as a free state. Buchanan himself did not particularly care whether or not Kansas entered as a slave state, and instead sought to admit Kansas as a state as soon as possible since it would likely tilt towards the Democratic Party. Rather than restarting the process and establishing one territorial government, Buchanan chose to recognize the Lecompton government.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=93\u201398}}\n\nUpon taking office, Buchanan appointed [[Robert J. Walker]] to replace [[John W. Geary]] as territorial governor, with the mission of reconciling the settler factions and approving a constitution. Walker, who was from Mississippi, was expected to assist the proslavery faction in gaining approval of a new constitution.{{sfn|Potter|1976|pp=297\u2013327}} However, after months in office, Walker came to believe that slavery was unsuited for the region and thought that Kansas would ultimately become a free state. In October 1857, the Lecompton government organized territorial elections that were so marked by fraud that Walker threw out the returns from several counties. Nonetheless, that same month, the Lecompton government framed the pro-slavery [[Lecompton Constitution]] and, rather than risking a referendum, sent it directly to Buchanan. Though eager for Kansas statehood, even Buchanan was forced to reject the entrance of Kansas without a state constitutional referendum, and he dispatched federal agents to bring about a compromise. The Lecompton government agreed to a limited referendum in which Kansas would vote not on the constitution overall, but rather merely on whether or not Kansas would allow slavery after becoming a state. The Topeka government boycotted the December 1857 referendum, and slavery overwhelmingly won the approval of those who did vote. A month later, the Topeka government held its own referendum in which voters overwhelmingly rejected the Lecompton Constitution.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=97\u2013100}}\n\nDespite the protests of Walker and two former governors of Kansas, Buchanan decided to accept the Lecompton Constitution. In a December 1857 meeting with Stephen Douglas, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Territories and an important northern Democrat, Buchanan demanded that all Democrats support the administration's position of admitting Kansas under the Lecompton Constitution. On February 2, Buchanan transmitted the Lecompton Constitution to Congress. He also transmitted a message that attacked the \"revolutionary government\" in Topeka, conflating them with the Mormons in Utah. Buchanan made every effort to secure congressional approval, offering favors, patronage appointments, and even cash for votes. The Lecompton Constitution won the approval of the Senate in March, but a combination of Know-Nothings, Republicans, and northern Democrats defeated the bill in the House. Rather than accepting defeat, Buchanan backed the [[English Bill (1858)|English Bill]], which offered Kansans immediate statehood and vast public lands in exchange for accepting the Lecompton Constitution. In August 1858, a Kansas referendum strongly rejected the Lecompton Constitution.{{Sfn|Baker|2004|pp=100\u2013105}}\n\nThe battle over Kansas escalated into a battle for control of the Democratic Party. On one side were Buchanan, most Southern Democrats, and northern Democrats allied to the Southerners (\"Doughfaces\"); on the other side were Douglas and most northern Democrats plus a few Southerners. Douglas's faction continued to support the doctrine of popular sovereignty, while Buchanan insisted that Democrats respect the ''Dred Scott'' decision and its repudiation of federal interference with slavery in the territories.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=120\u2013121}} The struggle lasted the remainder of Buchanan's presidency. Buchanan used his patronage powers to remove Douglas sympathizers in Illinois and Washington, D.C., and installed pro-administration Democrats, including postmasters.{{sfn|Chadwick|2008|p=91}}\n\n===1858 mid-term elections===\nDouglas's Senate term ended in 1859, so the Illinois legislature elected in 1858 would determine whether Douglas would win re-election. The Senate election was the primary issue of the legislative election, marked by the famous [[Lincoln-Douglas debates]]. Buchanan, working through federal patronage appointees in Illinois, ran candidates for the legislature in competition with both the Republicans and the Douglas Democrats. This could easily have thrown the election to the Republicans \u2013 which showed the depth of Buchanan's animosity toward Douglas.{{sfn|Chadwick|2008|p=117}} In the end, Douglas Democrats won the legislative election and Douglas was re-elected to the Senate. In that year's elections, Douglas forces took control throughout the North, except in Buchanan's home state of Pennsylvania. Buchanan was reduced to a narrow base of southern supporters.{{sfn|Potter|1976|pp=297\u2013327}}{{sfn|Klein|1962|pp=286\u2013299}}\n\nThe division between northern and southern Democrats allowed the Republicans to win a plurality in the House in the [[1858 United States elections|elections of 1858]]. Their control of the chamber allowed the Republicans to block most of Buchanan's agenda. Buchanan, in turn, vetoed six substantial pieces of Republican legislation, causing further hostility between Congress and the White House.{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=312}} Among the pieces of legislation that Buchanan vetoed were the [[Homestead Acts|Homestead Act]], which would have given 160 acres of public land to settlers who remained on the land for five years, and the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Act]], which would have granted public lands to establish [[Land-grant university|land-grant colleges]]. Buchanan argued that these acts were beyond the power of the federal government as established by the Constitution.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\n===Foreign policy===\nBuchanan took office with an ambitious foreign policy intended to establish U.S. hegemony over Central America at the expense of Great Britain.{{sfn|Smith|1975|pp=69\u201370}} He hoped to re-negotiate the [[Clayton-Bulwer Treaty]], which he viewed as a mistake that limited U.S. influence in the region.

Although Douglas led after every ballot, he was unable to win the two-thirds majority required. The convention adjourned after 53 ballots, and re-convened in Baltimore in June. After Douglas finally won the nomination, several southerners refused to accept the outcome, and nominated Vice President Breckinridge as their own candidate. Douglas and Breckinridge agreed on most issues except the protection of slavery. Failing to reconcile the party, and nursing a grudge against Douglas, Buchanan tepidly supported Breckinridge. With the splintering of the Democratic Party, Republican nominee [[Abraham Lincoln]] won a four-way election that also included [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] of the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]]. Lincoln's support in the North was enough to give him an Electoral College majority. Buchanan was the last Democrat to win a presidential election until [[Grover Cleveland]] in 1884.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=118\u2013120}}\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1860.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|1860 electoral vote results]]\n\nAs early as October, the army's [[Commanding General of the United States Army|Commanding General]], [[Winfield Scott]], who was adversarial to the President, warned Buchanan that Lincoln's election would likely cause at least seven states to secede. He also recommended to Buchanan that massive amounts of federal troops and artillery be deployed to those states to protect federal property, although he also warned that few reinforcements were available. Congress had since 1857 failed to heed calls for a stronger militia and had allowed the army to fall into deplorable condition.{{sfn|Klein|1962|pp=356\u2013358}} Buchanan distrusted Scott and ignored his recommendations.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=76, 133}} After Lincoln's election, Buchanan directed War Secretary Floyd to reinforce southern forts with such provisions, arms and men as were available; however, Floyd convinced him to revoke the order.{{sfn|Klein|1962|pp=356\u2013358}}\n\n===Secession===\nWith Lincoln's victory, talk of secession and disunion reached a boiling point, and Buchanan was forced to address it in his final message to Congress.

He placed the blame for the crisis solely on \"intemperate interference of the Northern people with the question of slavery in the Southern States,\" and suggested that if they did not \"repeal their unconstitutional and obnoxious enactments ... the injured States, after having first used all peaceful and constitutional means to obtain redress, would be justified in revolutionary resistance to the Government of the Union.\"<ref name=1860message>[[#Buchanan1860|Buchanan (1860)]]</ref> Buchanan's only suggestion to solve the crisis was \"an explanatory amendment\" affirming the constitutionality of slavery in the states, the fugitive slave laws, and [[popular sovereignty]] in the territories.<ref name=1860message /> His address was sharply criticized both by the north, for its refusal to stop secession, and the south, for denying its right to secede.{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=363}} Five days after the address was delivered, Treasury Secretary [[Howell Cobb]] resigned, as his views had become irreconcilable with the President's.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Resignation of Secretary Cobb.

However, unionist sentiment remained strong among many in the South, and Buchanan sought to appeal to the southern moderates who might prevent secession in other states. He proposed passage of constitutional amendments protecting slavery in the states and territories. He also met with South Carolinian commissioners in an attempt to resolve the situation at [[Fort Sumter]], which federal forces remained in control of despite its location in Charleston, South Carolina. He refused to dismiss Interior Secretary Jacob Thompson after the latter was chosen as Mississippi's agent to discuss secession, and he refused to fire Secretary of War John B. Floyd despite an embezzlement scandal, though the latter did eventually resign. Before resigning, Floyd sent numerous firearms to southern states, where they would eventually fall into the hands of the Confederacy. Despite Floyd's resignation, Buchanan continued to meet to receive advice from counselors from the Deep South, including [[Jefferson Davis]] and [[William Henry Trescot]], who informed the South Carolina government about the content of his conversations with Buchanan. Other southern sympathizers also leaked the administration's plans.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=123\u2013134}}\n\nEfforts were made by statesmen such as Sen. [[John J. Crittenden]], Rep. [[Thomas Corwin]], and former president [[John Tyler]] to negotiate a compromise to stop secession, with Buchanan's support; all failed. Failed attempts were also made by a group of governors meeting in New York. Buchanan secretly employed a last-minute tactic to bring a solution, attempting in vain to procure President-elect Lincoln's call for a constitutional convention or national referendum to resolve the issue of slavery.{{sfn|Klein|1962|pp=381\u2013387}}\n\nDespite the efforts of Buchanan and others, six more [[Southern United States|slave states]] seceded by the end of January 1861. Buchanan replaced the departed southern cabinet members with [[John Adams Dix]], [[Edwin M. Stanton]], and [[Joseph Holt]], all of whom were committed to preserving the union. When Buchanan considered surrendering Fort Sumter, the new cabinet members threatened to resign, and Buchanan relented. On January 5, Buchanan finally decided to reinforce Fort Sumter, sending the ''[[Star of the West]]'' with 250 men and supplies. However, he failed to ask Major [[Robert Anderson (Civil War)|Robert Anderson]] to provide covering fire for the ship, and it was forced to return North without delivering troops or supplies. Buchanan chose not to respond to this act of war, and instead sought to find a compromise to avoid secession. Though a March 3 message from Anderson reached Buchanan, that Anderson's supplies were running low, Lincoln succeeded as president the following day, inheriting the emerging sectional crisis.{{sfn|Baker|2004|pp=135\u2013140}}\n\n===Proposed constitutional amendment===\n* March 2, 1861: Congress approved an amendment to the [[United States Constitution]] that would shield \"domestic institutions\" of the states, including slavery, from the constitutional amendment process and from abolition or interference by Congress, and submitted it to the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] for [[ratification]].

The Senate proposed a resolution of condemnation which ultimately failed, and newspapers accused him of colluding with the Confederacy. His former cabinet members, five of whom had been given jobs in the Lincoln administration, refused to defend Buchanan publicly.{{sfn|Klein|1962|pp=408\u2013413}}\n\nBuchanan became distraught by the vitriolic attacks levied towards him, and fell sick and depressed.

He stated, \"Before [the abolitionists] commenced this agitation, a very large and growing party existed in several of the slave states in favor of the gradual abolition of slavery; and now not a voice is heard there in support of such a measure. The abolitionists have postponed the emancipation of the slaves in three or four states for at least half a century.\"{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=150}} In deference to the intentions of the typical slaveholder, he was quick to provide the benefit of much doubt. In his third annual message, Buchanan claimed that the slaves were \"treated with kindness and humanity. ...

He considered the constitution comprised \"... restraints, imposed not by arbitrary authority, but by the people upon themselves and their representatives. ... In an enlarged view, the people's interests may seem identical, but \"to the eye of local and sectional prejudice, they always appear to be conflicting ... and the jealousies that will perpetually arise can be repressed only by the mutual forbearance which pervades the constitution.\"{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=143}} Regarding slavery and the Constitution, he stated: \"Although in Pennsylvania we are all opposed to slavery in the abstract, we can never violate the constitutional compact we have with our sister states.

On territorial expansion, he said, \"What, sir? Prevent the people from crossing the [[Rocky Mountains]]? You might just as well command the [[Niagara Falls|Niagara]] not to flow. We must fulfill our destiny.\"{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=147}} On the resulting spread of slavery, through unconditional expansion, he stated: \"I feel a strong repugnance by any act of mine to extend the present limits of the Union over a new slave-holding territory.\" For instance, he hoped the acquisition of Texas would \"be the means of limiting, not enlarging, the dominion of slavery.\"{{sfn|Klein|1962|p=147}}\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:William Rufus King..jpg|thumb|[[William R.

His father, intending that he should enter the church, sent him to [[Eton College]] in 1737 and then to [[St John's College, Cambridge]] in 1748.<ref>{{acad|id=SMT747W2|name=Smith, William}}</ref> The vivacious spirit for which he was well known at Eton led him into problems at Cambridge. One evening he drank too freely with some friends and, being pursued by a proctor, he unwisely snapped an unloaded pistol at him. He refused the punishment that was imposed, and quit the University to avoid expulsion.<ref>'\"Gentleman Smith\", the original Charles Surface', in [[William Hone]] (ed.), ''The Every-Day Book: or, The Guide to the Year'' (London 1825), II, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8CEIAAAAQAAJ&pg=RA1-PA260#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 1287\u20131291] (Google).</ref>\n\n===Covent Garden 1753\u20131774===\nSmith was inclined towards the stage: upon arrival in London, he applied to [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] at the original [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] Theatre, where he first appeared in January 1753 in the role of Theodosius (in [[Nathaniel Lee]]'s tragedy of ''The Force of Love''<ref>See (Obituary notice of William Smith) ''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>), a performance attended by many of his college friends in a spirit of solidarity. He next appeared as Polydore in [[Thomas Otway]]'s ''[[The Orphan (play)|The Orphan]]'', Southampton in ''The Earl of Essex'', and Dolabella in [[John Dryden]]'s ''[[All For Love (play)|All for Love]]''. Having taken various subordinate roles in casts led by Mrs. Cibber and [[Spranger Barry]] (whose pupil he had effectively become<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>), on Barry's retirement he took on many of that actor's principal parts. If he had defects, they were generally overlooked by his audiences, who admired his upright and independent private life. The poet [[Charles Churchill (satirist)|Charles Churchill]], in his \"Rosciad\" satire of 1761, said of him: \"Smith the genteel, the airy, and the smart; Smith should still go to school to learn his part.\" Smith was at Covent Garden for 22 years.\n  \n===Drury Lane 1774\u20131788===\nAt the end of season in 1774 he and the actress [[Elizabeth Hartley (actress)|Elizabeth Hartley]], who played his on-stage lover in ''Henry II or The Fall of Rosamond'', caused a scandal when they absconded to France.

Though for a long time he played lead roles in tragedy, for which he had a suitably tall and well-proportioned figure, his facial features lacked the flexibility and expressiveness, and his vocal delivery was somewhat too harsh and monotonous, to be considered ideal. However, he won popularity as [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]], [[Henry IV, Part 1|Hotspur]], and Hastings, and was also admired in the roles of Kitely (''[[Every Man in his Humour]]'', in which he was preferred to Garrick<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>), Archer, and Oakly.

His father, intending that he should enter the church, sent him to [[Eton College]] in 1737 and then to [[St John's College, Cambridge]] in 1748.<ref>{{acad|id=SMT747W2|name=Smith, William}}</ref> The vivacious spirit for which he was well known at Eton led him into problems at Cambridge. One evening he drank too freely with some friends and, being pursued by a proctor, he unwisely snapped an unloaded pistol at him. He refused the punishment that was imposed, and quit the University to avoid expulsion.\n\n===Covent Garden 1753\u20131774===\nSmith was inclined towards the stage: upon arrival in London, he applied to [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] at the original [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] Theatre, where he first appeared in January 1753 in the role of Theodosius (in [[Nathaniel Lee]]'s tragedy of ''The Force of Love''<ref>See (Obituary notice of William Smith) ''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>), a performance attended by many of his college friends in a spirit of solidarity. He next appeared as Polydore in [[Thomas Otway]]'s ''[[The Orphan (play)|The Orphan]]'', Southampton in ''The Earl of Essex'', and Dolabella in [[John Dryden]]'s ''[[All For Love (play)|All for Love]]''. Having taken various subordinate roles in casts led by Mrs. Cibber and [[Spranger Barry]] (whose pupil he had effectively become<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>), on Barry's retirement he took on many of that actor's principal parts. If he had defects, they were generally overlooked by his audiences, who admired his upright and independent private life. The poet [[Charles Churchill (satirist)|Charles Churchill]], in his \"Rosciad\" satire of 1761, said of him: \"Smith the genteel, the airy, and the smart; Smith should still go to school to learn his part.\" Smith was at Covent Garden for 22 years.\n  \n===Drury Lane 1774\u20131788===\nAt the end of season in 1774 he and the actress [[Elizabeth Hartley (actress)|Elizabeth Hartley]], who played his on-stage lover in ''Henry II or The Fall of Rosamond'', caused a scandal when they absconded to France.

Though for a long time he played lead roles in tragedy, for which he had a suitably tall and well-proportioned figure, his facial features lacked the flexibility and expressiveness, and his vocal delivery was somewhat too harsh and monotonous, to be considered ideal. However, he won popularity as [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]], [[Henry IV, Part 1|Hotspur]], and Hastings, and was also admired in the roles of Kitely (''[[Every Man in his Humour]]'', in which he was preferred to Garrick<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>), Archer, and Oakly.

Promoted as \"the world\u2019s longest art gallery\", the canyon is known for its extensive [[rock art]], most of it created by the [[Fremont culture]] and the [[Ute tribe|Ute]] people. The rock art, shelters, and [[granary|granaries]] left behind by the Fremont make Ninemile Canyon a destination for [[archaeology|archaeologists]] and tourists alike.\n\nThe canyon became a main [[transport corridor]] in the region during the 1880s. Settlers established a number of [[ranch]]es in Ninemile Canyon, and even a short-lived town named [[Harper, Utah|Harper]]. No longer heavily traveled, the rugged canyon road was used mostly for recreation and tourism through the end of the 20th century. The discovery of rich deposits of [[natural gas]] deep beneath the West Tavaputs Plateau has brought an influx of industrial truck traffic since 2002. The large amounts of [[fugitive dust]] produced by the trucks' passage may be damaging the rock art. Public debate is ongoing about how best to balance energy development in the canyon against the preservation of its cultural resources.<ref name=blm/>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Nine Mile Creek at North Franks Canyon, Utah.jpg|thumb|Ninemile Canyon (the dark green area at the bottom) at North Franks Canyon. An array of natural gas wells is visible in the distance, May 2019.]]\n\nNinemile Canyon runs roughly southwest to northeast, with numerous winding turns, just to the north of the [[Book Cliffs]], and south and east of [[Ashley National Forest]]. The full {{convert|78|mi|adj=on}} canyon route, formerly [[Utah State Route 53 (1931-1969)|SR&#8209;53]] through Gate Canyon, connects the towns of [[Wellington, Utah|Wellington]] and [[Myton, Utah|Myton]]. Nine Mile Creek, the [[stream]] that formed the canyon, is by no means a major body of water. Its importance lies in the fact that it is one of the few water sources in the region that are reliable year-round, and it has been so since prehistoric times. Nine Mile Creek is actually a minor [[tributary]] of the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]], emptying into [[Desolation Canyon]] on the east. A number of tributary canyons branch off Ninemile Cayon itself, including Argyle Canyon, Cottonwood Canyon, [[Minnie Maud]], and Dry Canyon. Significant rock art sites are frequently located near the junctions where they meet the main canyon.\n\n==Archaeology==\n[[File:HuntSceneNMC.JPG|thumb|left|The famous ''Cottonwood Panel'', also called ''The Great Hunt'', May 2006]]\n\nThere are at least an estimated 1,000 rock art sites in the canyon, with more than 10,000 individual images.<ref name=spangler/>{{rp|141}} The true figures may be ten times as high,<ref name=dirtraker/> but there is no question that rock art is more concentrated here than anywhere else in [[North America]]. Much is in the form of pecked [[petroglyph]]s, and there are many painted [[pictograph]]s as well. Researchers have also identified hundreds of [[pit-house]]s, rock shelters, and [[granary|granaries]], although only a limited amount of [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] has been carried out. Many of these structures are located high above the canyon floor on cliff ledges, pinnacles, and [[mesa]]s. They were built by the Fremont, whose presence in Ninemile Canyon has been dated at AD 950\u20131250. Indeed, Ninemile Canyon was one of the locations most heavily occupied by the Fremont.<ref name=carbon/><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.riversimulator.org/Resources/History/UtahCounties/HistoryOfCarbonCounty1996Watt.pdf|title=A History of Carbon County|last=Watt|first=Ronald G.|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-913738-15-8|location=|pages=14\u201316|format=PDF}}</ref> In contrast to the purely [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures that surrounded them, the Fremont practiced [[agriculture]], growing [[maize|corn]] and [[squash (plant)|squash]] along the canyon bottom. Compared to other Fremont areas, relatively little [[pottery]] is found in Nine Mile, suggesting that [[bean]]s, which must be boiled for hours to become edible, were not an important part of the local diet.<ref name=spangler />{{rp|45}} The Fremont left [[irrigation]] ditches and earthen lodges on the canyon floor that could be seen as late as the 1930s, but are no longer visible after generations of modern cultivation.<ref name=spangler />{{rp|21}}\n\n[[File:Utebison.jpeg|thumb|The prints under this [[bison]]'s hooves indicate Ute origin, November 2007.]]\nBy the 16th century the ancestral Utes were in the canyon. They added to the rock art already on the walls, but in styles of their own. Many scenes, for example, depict Ute hunters on horseback and date to the 1800s. Despite the number of Ute [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] found in Nine Mile, there is no archaeological evidence of any Ute camps or residences.<ref name=spangler />{{rp|55\u201357}}\n\n{{anchor|DuchesneNineMileCanyonARs|CarbonNineMileCanyonARs}}\n\n===Archaeological sites===\n[[File:Redman Village Nine Mile Canyon.jpeg|thumb|left|Stone shelter at Redman Village, April 2007]]\n\nIn 2009, 63 archaeological sites in the canyon were listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]], 36 in Carbon County and 27 in Duchesne County. Most are named in the National Register listing only by their [[Smithsonian trinomial]] codes, but there were three named sites in Carbon County: Cottonwood Village, Drop-Dead Ruin, and First Canyon Site. The named ones in Duchesne County are Centennial House, Fool's Pinnacle, Karen's Cist, Maxies Pad, Nordell's Fort, Redman Village, Sunstone Village, and Taylor's City. The locations and details of these sites are not disclosed by the National Register.<ref name=nrhp1/> The 63 sites include 40 Fremont constructions, 19 rock art sites, and 4 sets of historical-era dwellings.<ref name=nom/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=&itype=ngpsid|title=Utah rock art canyon up for historic designation|last=Stark|first=Mike|date=November 11, 2009|website=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> A further 165 sites were added on September 12, 2012, all of them designated by codes only.

Use of the road surged in 1889 after the discovery of [[Gilsonite]] in the [[Uinta Basin]]. This was the main transportation route in eastern Utah until well into the 20th century. Most of the [[stagecoach]], mail, freight, and [[telegraph]] traffic into the Uinta Basin passed through Ninemile Canyon until after the arrival of the [[Uintah Railway]] around 1905.\n\nThe freight trade led to the settlement of the canyon itself. One of the main stagecoach stops developed into a town of sorts. Called [[Harper, Utah|Harper]], it included a hotel, store, school, and an unofficial post office. It lacked a formal town site, simply taking in a long stretch of scattered ranches and buildings. The community grew gradually from the 1880s until it was officially established as the town of Harper in 1905. The Harper precinct as a whole had a population of 130 at its peak in 1910,<ref name=duchesne/>{{rp|81\u201382}} but in the early 1920s Harper became a [[ghost town]].<ref name=guide/>\n\n==Current issues==\n[[File:Defacedelk.jpeg|thumb|Defaced rock art in Rasmussen Cave, April 2007]]\n\nRock art and other ancient artifacts are now protected by law and, although enforcement is difficult, outright [[looting]] and malicious [[vandalism]] are largely a thing of the past. Ninemile Canyon's rock art, however, is still at risk. Carved and painted mainly on weathered [[sandstone]] panels, the images are susceptible to [[erosion]], which is accelerated by touching<ref name=spangler />{{rp|87}} and airborne dust. The dust is a special concern as heavy industrial traffic in the canyon increases.\n\nNine Mile Canyon Road, once such an important route, was almost completely [[pavement (material)|unpaved]] until 2013. In fact, it was considered the poorest of the four old military roads in Duchesne County.<ref name=duchesne />{{rp|71}} In 1990, the U.S. [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) designated it as a Scenic Backcountry Byway.<ref name=risk/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=&itype=ngpsid|title=Nine Mile Canyon at risk|last=Henetz|first=Patty|date=February 16, 2008|website=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> The Ninemile Canyon Paving project is expected to be complete in October 2014 (weather permitting).\n\n===Natural gas development===\n[[File:Nine Mile Canyon Compressor Station.jpeg|thumb|left|Bill Barrett Corporation's natural gas compressor station, at the Dry Canyon junction, March 2008]]\n\nNine Mile's unique archaeological resources have led to intense debate over [[land use]]. As in many rural areas of the Western United States, land in the canyon is a patchwork of [[public land|public]] and private property. Archaeological sites are found on both. Commercially important deposits of [[mineral]]s and other geological resources have also been discovered, further complicating the issues. Since 2002, the [[Bill Barrett Corporation]], in cooperation with the BLM and private landowners, has been pursuing a natural gas exploration project on the West Tavaputs Plateau in and around the canyon. The company estimates the available natural gas reserves at approximately 1 trillion cubic feet (2.8{{e|10}} m\u00b3).<ref name=risk/> Bill Barrett Corporation has spent some $2 million on improving area roads, and the complete project, if approved as planned, could create as many as 1000 jobs.<ref name=oversight/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182831/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/content/mobile/700231011/Canyon-oversight-questioned.html?printView=true|title=Canyon oversight questioned {{!}} Deseret News|last=Thalman|first=James|date=2016-03-03|website=[[Deseret News]]|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> Government involvement in the project has been controversial, drawing complaints from [[conservation movement|conservation]] groups that not enough is being done to protect natural and cultural resources.<ref name=policy/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/13/us/when-the-bush-energy-policy-confronts-ancient-art.html|title=When the Bush Energy Policy Confronts Ancient Art|last=Barringer|first=Felicity|date=2004-06-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-05-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nine Mile Canyon dust.jpeg|thumb|Road dust drifts up the canyon, March 2008.]]\n[[File:Dustypetroglyphs.jpeg|thumb|Dust-covered petroglyphs,<br>March 2008]]\nPrevious to 2013, industrial truck traffic on Nine Mile's main road were producing clouds of dust. Prior to paving, the dirt road was not maintained for heavy traffic.<ref name=risk/> The dust reduced visibility on the road and settled on the rock art. Carbon County, which supervises the use of the road, approved the application of [[magnesium chloride]] on the road as a [[dust abatement]] measure.

Public debate is ongoing about how best to balance energy development in the canyon against the preservation of its cultural resources.<ref name=blm/>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Nine Mile Creek at North Franks Canyon, Utah.jpg|thumb|Ninemile Canyon (the dark green area at the bottom) at North Franks Canyon. An array of natural gas wells is visible in the distance, May 2019.]]\n\nNinemile Canyon runs roughly southwest to northeast, with numerous winding turns, just to the north of the [[Book Cliffs]], and south and east of [[Ashley National Forest]]. The full {{convert|78|mi|adj=on}} canyon route, formerly [[Utah State Route 53 (1931-1969)|SR&#8209;53]] through Gate Canyon, connects the towns of [[Wellington, Utah|Wellington]] and [[Myton, Utah|Myton]]. Nine Mile Creek, the [[stream]] that formed the canyon, is by no means a major body of water. Its importance lies in the fact that it is one of the few water sources in the region that are reliable year-round, and it has been so since prehistoric times. Nine Mile Creek is actually a minor [[tributary]] of the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]], emptying into [[Desolation Canyon]] on the east. A number of tributary canyons branch off Ninemile Cayon itself, including Argyle Canyon, Cottonwood Canyon, [[Minnie Maud]], and Dry Canyon. Significant rock art sites are frequently located near the junctions where they meet the main canyon.\n\n==Archaeology==\n[[File:HuntSceneNMC.JPG|thumb|left|The famous ''Cottonwood Panel'', also called ''The Great Hunt'', May 2006]]\n\nThere are at least an estimated 1,000 rock art sites in the canyon, with more than 10,000 individual images.<ref name=spangler/>{{rp|141}} The true figures may be ten times as high,<ref name=dirtraker/> but there is no question that rock art is more concentrated here than anywhere else in [[North America]]. Much is in the form of pecked [[petroglyph]]s, and there are many painted [[pictograph]]s as well. Researchers have also identified hundreds of [[pit-house]]s, rock shelters, and [[granary|granaries]], although only a limited amount of [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] has been carried out. Many of these structures are located high above the canyon floor on cliff ledges, pinnacles, and [[mesa]]s. They were built by the Fremont, whose presence in Ninemile Canyon has been dated at AD 950\u20131250. Indeed, Ninemile Canyon was one of the locations most heavily occupied by the Fremont.<ref name=carbon/><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.riversimulator.org/Resources/History/UtahCounties/HistoryOfCarbonCounty1996Watt.pdf|title=A History of Carbon County|last=Watt|first=Ronald G.|publisher=|year=|isbn=0-913738-15-8|location=|pages=14\u201316|format=PDF}}</ref> In contrast to the purely [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures that surrounded them, the Fremont practiced [[agriculture]], growing [[maize|corn]] and [[squash (plant)|squash]] along the canyon bottom. Compared to other Fremont areas, relatively little [[pottery]] is found in Nine Mile, suggesting that [[bean]]s, which must be boiled for hours to become edible, were not an important part of the local diet.<ref name=spangler />{{rp|45}} The Fremont left [[irrigation]] ditches and earthen lodges on the canyon floor that could be seen as late as the 1930s, but are no longer visible after generations of modern cultivation.<ref name=spangler />{{rp|21}}\n\n[[File:Utebison.jpeg|thumb|The prints under this [[bison]]'s hooves indicate Ute origin, November 2007.]]\nBy the 16th century the ancestral Utes were in the canyon. They added to the rock art already on the walls, but in styles of their own. Many scenes, for example, depict Ute hunters on horseback and date to the 1800s. Despite the number of Ute [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] found in Nine Mile, there is no archaeological evidence of any Ute camps or residences.<ref name=spangler />{{rp|55\u201357}}\n\n{{anchor|DuchesneNineMileCanyonARs|CarbonNineMileCanyonARs}}\n\n===Archaeological sites===\n[[File:Redman Village Nine Mile Canyon.jpeg|thumb|left|Stone shelter at Redman Village, April 2007]]\n\nIn 2009, 63 archaeological sites in the canyon were listed on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]], 36 in Carbon County and 27 in Duchesne County. Most are named in the National Register listing only by their [[Smithsonian trinomial]] codes, but there were three named sites in Carbon County: Cottonwood Village, Drop-Dead Ruin, and First Canyon Site. The named ones in Duchesne County are Centennial House, Fool's Pinnacle, Karen's Cist, Maxies Pad, Nordell's Fort, Redman Village, Sunstone Village, and Taylor's City.

Use of the road surged in 1889 after the discovery of [[Gilsonite]] in the [[Uinta Basin]]. This was the main transportation route in eastern Utah until well into the 20th century. Most of the [[stagecoach]], mail, freight, and [[telegraph]] traffic into the Uinta Basin passed through Ninemile Canyon until after the arrival of the [[Uintah Railway]] around 1905.\n\nThe freight trade led to the settlement of the canyon itself. One of the main stagecoach stops developed into a town of sorts. Called [[Harper, Utah|Harper]], it included a hotel, store, school, and an unofficial post office. It lacked a formal town site, simply taking in a long stretch of scattered ranches and buildings. The community grew gradually from the 1880s until it was officially established as the town of Harper in 1905. The Harper precinct as a whole had a population of 130 at its peak in 1910,<ref name=duchesne/>{{rp|81\u201382}} but in the early 1920s Harper became a [[ghost town]].<ref name=guide/>\n\n==Current issues==\n[[File:Defacedelk.jpeg|thumb|Defaced rock art in Rasmussen Cave, April 2007]]\n\nRock art and other ancient artifacts are now protected by law and, although enforcement is difficult, outright [[looting]] and malicious [[vandalism]] are largely a thing of the past. Ninemile Canyon's rock art, however, is still at risk. Carved and painted mainly on weathered [[sandstone]] panels, the images are susceptible to [[erosion]], which is accelerated by touching<ref name=spangler />{{rp|87}} and airborne dust. The dust is a special concern as heavy industrial traffic in the canyon increases.\n\nNine Mile Canyon Road, once such an important route, was almost completely [[pavement (material)|unpaved]] until 2013.

As in many rural areas of the Western United States, land in the canyon is a patchwork of [[public land|public]] and private property. Archaeological sites are found on both. Commercially important deposits of [[mineral]]s and other geological resources have also been discovered, further complicating the issues. Since 2002, the [[Bill Barrett Corporation]], in cooperation with the BLM and private landowners, has been pursuing a natural gas exploration project on the West Tavaputs Plateau in and around the canyon. The company estimates the available natural gas reserves at approximately 1 trillion cubic feet (2.8{{e|10}} m\u00b3).<ref name=risk/> Bill Barrett Corporation has spent some $2 million on improving area roads, and the complete project, if approved as planned, could create as many as 1000 jobs.<ref name=oversight/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182831/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/content/mobile/700231011/Canyon-oversight-questioned.html?printView=true|title=Canyon oversight questioned {{!}} Deseret News|last=Thalman|first=James|date=2016-03-03|website=[[Deseret News]]|access-date=2019-05-23}}</ref> Government involvement in the project has been controversial, drawing complaints from [[conservation movement|conservation]] groups that not enough is being done to protect natural and cultural resources.<ref name=policy/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/13/us/when-the-bush-energy-policy-confronts-ancient-art.html|title=When the Bush Energy Policy Confronts Ancient Art|last=Barringer|first=Felicity|date=2004-06-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-05-23|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Nine Mile Canyon dust.jpeg|thumb|Road dust drifts up the canyon, March 2008.]]\n[[File:Dustypetroglyphs.jpeg|thumb|Dust-covered petroglyphs,<br>March 2008]]\nPrevious to 2013, industrial truck traffic on Nine Mile's main road were producing clouds of dust.

He proceeded to evolve the [[Proprietary church]] as a basis for imperial power, preferring to appoint clerics over secular lords for important offices throughout the empire. Like Henry II before him, he insisted on his feudal claim (''Honor Imperii''), yet granted Italy a high degree of self-governance, near complete economic autonomy and recognized and respected the political importance and influence of the city of [[Rome]] and its [[Roman Curia|curia]] in particular.<ref name=boni/><ref name=\"Blumenthal1988\">{{cite book|author=Uta-Renate Blumenthal|title=The Investiture Controversy: Church and Monarchy from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tZhHot9CuEC&pg=PA45|year=1988|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1386-6|pages=45\u2013}}</ref> His reign marked a high point of medieval imperial rule during a relatively peaceful period for the empire.

His son, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], succeeded him as Count in 941 and [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I of Germany]] (the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) appointed him as [[Duke of Lorraine]] in 944. He was subsequently married to [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], one of Otto's daughters, in 947 and became one of the king's closest allies. The relationship was strained, however, when Otto refused to honor a peace treaty Conrad, as Otto's representative, had conducted with the rebellious [[Berengar II of Italy]]. Conrad also resented the growing influence of Otto's brother [[Henry I, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Bavaria]], which he saw as threatening his own power. In 953 Conrad joined the king's son [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]] in rebellion against Otto, but the rebellion was defeated and Conrad was stripped of his duchy. Conrad and Otto were soon reconciled, with Conrad fighting for Otto in the great [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955. Though the Germans were successful in halting the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe]], Conrad lost his life in the battle. Conrad was succeeded as Count of Worms in 956 by his son [[Otto of Worms]], a grandson of Otto I. Sometime between 965 and 970 Otto of Worms' oldest son, [[Henry of Speyer]], was born. Little is known of his life as he died the age of 20 between 985 and 990. Conrad II's father was [[Henry of Speyer]], and his mother was [[Adelaide of Metz]], an area of [[Upper Lorraine]]. After Henry's death, Adelaide married a Frankish nobleman. After her remarriage, Adelaide demonstrated no close relationship with her son.<ref name=urku>{{cite web |url= https://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000448_00011.html?zoom=0.75&leftTab=toc&sortIndex=030:040:0004:010:00:00 |title= Konrad II  |publisher= Monumenta Germaniae Historica  | date= | author= | accessdate= January 29, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn 978 [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] appointed his nephew Otto of Worms as [[Duke of Carinthia]] after deposing the rebellious Duke [[Henry III, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Carinthia]] during the [[War of the Three Henries (977\u2013978)|War of the Three Henries]]. Upon receiving the ducal title, however, Otto lost his position at Worms, which was given to Bishop [[Hildebald]], Otto II's imperial chancellor. When Otto II died suddenly in 983, his infant son [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] succeeded him, with his mother [[Theophanu]] serving as regent. Theophanu sought to reconcile the imperial house with Henry I, restoring him as Duke of Carinthia in 985, with Otto of Worms allowed to regain his ancestral position as Count of Worms. However, Otto was allowed to style himself \"Duke of Worms\" and his original territory was expanded so as not to diminish his rank. Otto of Worms remained loyal to the new Emperor, receiving rulership of the [[March of Verona]] in 955, though the actual Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Bavaria]]. In 996, Otto III appointed Otto of Worms' son Bruno as [[Pope Gregory V]]. When Emperor Otto III died in 1002, both Otto of Worms, Conrad's grandfather, and Henry IV were candidates for election as King of Germany. In a compromise, Otto withdrew and received the Duchy of Carinthia from the newly elected Henry IV, who ruled as ''Henry II of Germany'', in return. As a result, Otto of Worms renounced his holdings in Worms to [[Burchard of Worms|Bishop Burchard of Worms]], a long-time political rival. Buchard assumed care for Conrad, providing his education and upbringing by 1000.\n\nAfter the early death of his uncle Duke [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad I of Carinthia]], the elder Conrad's infant son, [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], was named Count of Worms by Emperor Henry II while the Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Adalbero of Eppenstein]] due to Conrad the Younger's infancy. Conrad the Younger was placed in Conrad's care.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\">{{cite book|author1=Lenelotte M\u00f6ller|author2=Hans Ammerich|title=Die Salier: 1024-1125 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZd4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT3|date=1 December 2015|publisher=marixverlag|isbn=978-3-8438-0474-5|pages=3\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Weinfurter99\"/>\n\n===Adulthood===\nConrad married [[Gisela of Swabia]], a twice widowed [[duchess]], in 1016.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=32}} Gisela was the daughter of [[Herman II of Swabia|Duke Herman II of Swabia]] who, in 1002, unsuccessfully claimed the German throne following [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]'s death, losing the election to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]]. Gisela was first married to [[Brun I, Count of Brunswick|Count Bruno I of Brunswick]] the same year. Following Bruno's death around 1010, Gisela married [[Ernest I, Duke of Swabia|Ernest I]] of the [[House of Babenberg]]. By the marriage, Ernest I inherited the [[Duchy of Swabia]] at the death of Gisela's brother [[Herman III, Duke of Swabia|Duke Herman III of Swabia]] in 1012. This marriage produced two sons: [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]] and Herman. After the death of Ernest I in 1015, Emperor Henry II named Ernest II as Duke of Swabia. As Gisela's new husband, Conrad hoped to serve as regent for his minor stepson in the administration of the duchy, seeing it as an opportunity to increase his own rank and subsequently make a claim for his own duchy. Emperor Henry II blocked this attempt by placing the guardianship of Ernest II, and regency over Swabia, in the hands of [[Poppo (Archbishop of Trier)|Archbishop Poppo of Trier]] in 1016. This action further strained the already rough relationship between the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|House of Otto]] and the [[Salian dynasty|Salian family]].\n\nConrad II's hopes of obtaining his own duchy failed, but his marriage to Gisela brought him wealth. Her mother, [[Gerberga of Burgundy]], was the daughter of reigning [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundian King]] [[Conrad of Burgundy]] and granddaughter of the late [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish King]] [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]]. Gisela also claimed descent from [[Charlemagne]] through both her mother and her father. The marriage was problematic because of the familial relationship shared by Gisela and Conrad: both were descendants of [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian King]] [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]], Henry in the fifth generation and Gisela in the fourth. According to [[canon law]], marriage was not allowed among relatives of the first to seventh generations. Though Conrad's marriage differed little from the usual practice of the time, strict canonists took exception to the marriage and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] used this breach of canonical law to force Conrad into temporary exile. During this exile, Gisela bore Conrad a son, [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], on October 28, 1017. Conrad and Emperor Henry II were eventually reconciled, allowing him to return to Germany.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Reign as King==\n\n===Royal election===\nEmperor Henry II died in 1024.

Without a clear successor as [[King of Germany]], Henry's widow [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] served as regent while the German dukes gathered to elect a new king. Cunigunde was assisted by her brothers [[Dietrich I of Metz|Bishop Dietrich I of Metz]] and [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]].

The [[Duchy of Saxony]] adopted a neutral strategy while the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] favored the younger Conrad. A majority of the assembled princes favored the elder Conrad, as the father of a seven-year-old son implied a more stable dynastic future for the kingdom. As president of the assembly, Archbishop Aribo cast the first vote and supported the elder Conrad. He was joined by the other clerics in support of him. The secular dukes then cast their votes for the elder Conrad as well.

Conrad refused to accept Archbishop Aribo's position. Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne saw the situation as an opportunity to restore his relationship with the king, after refusing to support Conrad's election, and he crowned Gisela queen on September 21, 1024.

The duchies of Saxony and Lorraine were in opposition to his rule, as well as his cousin Conrad of Carinthia. To secure his reign, Conrad went on a tour of Germany, making stops in [[Augsburg]] to receive the support of [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno]], and at [[Strasbourg]] to receive the support of [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Bishop Werner]], the brothers of the late Emperor Henry II. Both were appointed to high-ranking offices at Conrad's court. Traveling from Cologne to [[Aachen]], the site of Charlemagne's old capital, Conrad continued the tradition of claiming the right to rule Germany as successor to Charlemagne. Despite the continuance of this Ottonian tradition, the Duchy of Lorraine still did not accept his rule. Conrad then traveled north to Saxony, visiting [[Adelaide I, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Adelaide I of Quedlinburg]] and [[Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim|Abbess Sophia I of Gandersheim]], both daughters of the late Ottonian [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]]. Their support of Conrad's rule greatly influenced the Saxony nobility. Celebrating [[Christmas]] at [[Minden]], the Saxon nobles, led by [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bernard II]], recognized Conrad as their king after he promised he would respect Saxon law. Conrad and Gisela would remain in Saxony during the winter until March 1025. Upon leaving Saxony, Conrad traveled to the [[Duchy of Swabia]], celebrating [[Easter]] at [[Augsburg]]. He then traveled to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] to celebrate [[Pentecost]] at [[Regensburg]]. Conrad next traveled to [[Zurich]] near the German-Burgundian border. In 1016, Emperor Henry II forced the childless Burgundian King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] to name him as his heir. With Henry's death in 1024, Conrad claimed the same rights over Burgundy. This ended his tour of Germany, visiting all major regions of the kingdom within ten months of his election.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\"/>\n\nConrad had to address the longstanding ''[[Gandersheim Conflict]]'' upon assuming the German throne. The forty-year conflict stretched back to 989, during the reign of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]], over control of [[Gandersheim Abbey]] and its estates. Both the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and the [[Bishop of Hildesheim]] claimed authority over the Abbey, including the authority to anoint the Abbey's nuns. Though Otto III eased the tensions between the parties by declaring that both bishops would anoint the Abbess, the conflict continued. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], the new [[Primate of Germany]], sought to overturn this precedent. Conrad was indebted to Aribo for his support during the royal election and worked to support his ally. In January 1027, the king called a [[synod]] at [[Frankfurt]] to resolve the dispute, but a conclusion was not reached. Conrad called a second synod in September 1028, which likewise failed to find a solution. Only a third synod in 1030 ended the conflict when [[Gotthard of Hildesheim|Bishop Gotthard of Hildesheim]] renounced his claims to the monastery in favor of Aribo.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\">{{cite book|author=Herwig Wolfram|title=Conrad II, 990-1039: Emperor of Three Kingdoms - The Dispute over Gandersheim p.95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zuKIX5g6MgoC&pg=PA443|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04818-2|pages=443\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Davids2002\">{{cite book|author=Adelbert Davids|title=The Empress Theophano: Byzantium and the West at the Turn of the First Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9Nf-GHTgnEC&pg=PA92|date=15 August 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52467-4|pages=92\u2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring his travel to Augsburg, a conflict broke out between Conrad and his younger cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]]. The reasons for the dispute are not clear, however, the younger Conrad claimed he did not receive the compensation the king had promised him for withdrawing from the 1024 election. Both men might have reconciled sometimes before September 1027 as Conrad the Younger had ceased to oppose Conrad II.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=75}}\n\n===Unrest in Italy===\n[[File:Iron Crown.JPG|thumb|300px|Following his expedition into Italy in early 1026, Conrad II was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] as the [[King of the Lombards]].]]\nIn Bavaria, Conrad was brought into contact with the Italian ruling elite for the first time. In June 1025, [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]], and other bishops from [[Northern Italy]], traveled north over the Alps to pay homage to Conrad. In exchange for certain privileges in the governing of Italy, Aribert agreed to crown Conrad with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]].{{sfn|Bury|1922|p=264}} The situation in Italy was unstable after the death of the Henry II. The secular nobles believed the Italian throne to be vacant, not accepting Conrad's automatic succession as a matter of right. Instead, the secular nobles offered the Italian crown to the  [[House of Capet|Capetian]] [[Robert II of France|King Robert II of France]] and his son [[Hugh Magnus]]. After he rejected the offer, the secular lords approached [[William V, Duke of Aquitaine|Duke William V of Aquitaine]]. Though initially excited by the offer, William V subsequently rejected it as well.\n\nIn addition to the ecclesiastical mission, secular Italian nobles from [[Pavia]] also traveled north to Conrad. While Conrad's election did not meet significant obstacles north of the Alps, in Italy, in the aftermath of the death of [[Emperor Henry II]], there were several riots, and some Italian nobles attempted to separate the [[Kingdom of Italy]] from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. When the news spread of Henry's death, the citizens of [[Pavia]] revolted, destroying the imperial palace, which dated to the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogothic King]] [[Theodoric the Great]] during the 5th century. Though Pavia had lost is position as the seat of royal administration in Italy under the Ottonian dynasty, the palace had been a great symbol of imperial authority in Italy. Pavia, thanks to its strategic location situated on the trade routes from Italy to Burgundy and France, had become an important commercial center. Traders of the lower nobility demanded greater autonomy from imperial control. The nobility saw the mere presence of the imperial palace within the city walls intolerable.<ref name=boni>{{cite web |url= https://www.academia.edu/40250313/Reconsidering_Donizone_s_Vita_Mathildis_again_Boniface_of_Canossa_and_the_Emperor_Conrad_II |title= Boniface of Canossa and the Emperor Conrad III  |publisher= Academiaa  | date=July 24, 2017 | author=Robert Houghton | accessdate= January 30, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nAmbassadors from Pavia traveled north to meet with the German king. According to Conrad's personal cleric Wipo, the Italian kingship was not \"durable\" with the German throne but instead a mere \"[[personal union]]\". Italy was a separate nation from Germany with its own identity, not a permanent [[political union]]. They tried to justify the actions of their fellow citizens, claiming that Pavia had always been loyal to the Italian king, as long as the king was alive, and that the revolt had taken place when the Italian throne was vacant. Therefore, the burning of the palace should be excused. Conrad rejected their argument, however, saying that just as a ship remains after the death of its captain, the Empire remains after the death of the Emperor. The kingship of Italy, according to Conrad, belonged to him as king of Germany as a matter of legal right. Conrad also declared that the palace was property of the Empire, not of the old king, and therefore the new king had the right to punish those responsible. The secular nobles returned to Italy in opposition to [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] rule.<ref name=boni/>\n\nIn February 1026, Conrad assembled an army of thousands of armored knights for an expedition into Italy, including troops commanded by both [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]] and [[Pilgrim (archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne]]. Conrad's army marched south, besieging Pavia, but the city walls blocked the attackers. Conrad decided to leave a contingent of soldiers to keep the city under siege, blocking all trade in the area, and continued his campaign. By March 1026, Conrad arrived in [[Milan]] and was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of the Lombards]] by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]] as [[King of the Lombards]]. From Milan, Conrad traveled to [[Vercelli]], where he celebrated [[Easter]] with the aged [[Leo of Vercelli|Bishop Leo of Vercelli]], who had been a chief advisor to the late [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. When Leo died a few days later, Archbishop Aribert became the chief supporter of the [[Salian dynasty]] in Italy. With Conrad's assistance, Aribert became highest ranking religious figure in Italy and oversaw the expansion of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan. In June 1026, Conrad marched with his army to [[Ravenna]], but quartering his soldiers alongside the Ravennese population caused tension in the city. Conrad marched north to mitigate the risk the summer heat posed to his army. In autumn Conrad left his summer camp in the [[Po valley]] and marched to the Burgundian border. Conrad then celebrated [[Christmas]] at [[Ivrea]]. By the end of winter, the secular nobles of Italy voluntarily ended their opposition to Conrad's reign. Pavia, however, remained in revolt until early 1027 when [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo of Cluny]] brokered a peace deal between the city and Conrad.<ref name=\"Halfond2016\">{{cite book|author=Gregory I.

Rudolph's attendance marked an improvement in the relationship between Burgundy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the seven-day coronation ceremony, a rank dispute between the archbishops of Milan and Ravenna arose, with Conrad deciding in favor of Milan. Following the synod, Conrad traveled south to receive [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] from the southern Italian states of [[Principality of Capua]], the [[Principality of Salerno]], and the [[Duchy of Benevento]].<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\">{{cite book|author=Stefan Weinfurter|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChuTjtrf9xIC&pg=PA228|year=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3508-8|page=28\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter his coronation, Conrad issued decrees to reorganize the monasteries and dioceses of Italy with the particular goal of bringing the church at [[Venice]] under Imperial control (see the ''[[Schism of the Three Chapters]]''). On April 6, 1027, at a [[synod]] held in the [[Lateran Basilica]] with [[Pope John XIX]], the Emperor resolved the dispute in favor of Old-Aquileia. The [[Patriarchate of Aquileia|Patriarch of Aquleia]] [[Poppo of Treffen|Poppo]] had been a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry II, who appointed him as Patriarch in 1020 during the Emperor's campaign to reassert his authority in Italy. Conrad's action placed the church at Grado under Poppo's authority, securing Poppo's loyalty by making him the Emperor's top official in northern Italy. The synod ended the independence of the Grado church and limited the political autonomy of Venice. In so doing, Conrad broke with the policies of his predecessors and revoked Venice's privileged trading status.\n\nToward the end of May 1027, Conrad returned north to Germany to attend the funeral of [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]] at [[Regensburg]]. With the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] left vacant, Conrad asserted his right to name a next duke as a matter of [[royal prerogative]], taking the unprecedented decision of naming his 10-year-old son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as Duke of Bavaria despite the existence of candidates with a better claim to the Duchy. Never before had the Bavarian Duchy passed to a non-member of the Bavarian ducal family.\n\nThe young prince assumed the Bavarian dignity on 24 June 1027. Following Henry's appointment, Conrad held court at Regensburg and issued a decree requiring an accounting of all imperial property in the duchy. This required the various counts and bishops to report to Conrad all property they possessed in their castles and abbeys that belonged to the Emperor. Even the [[Dowager Empress]] [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] was required to report to Conrad, with the Emperor even claiming Cunegonde's ''[[wittum]]'' (money and property left to her by her late husband Emperor Henry II) as belonging to him. Conrad's promotion of imperial authority over the ducal succession and his claims to property throughout Bavaria caused tension between him and the German aristocracy, who viewed Conrad's actions as infringing upon their privileges.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Uprising in Swabia===\n[[File:MPano 07.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Konstanz Minster]], seat of the [[Bishop of Constance]]]]\n[[File:Oberfalkenstein.jpg|thumb|200px|left|ruins of the ''Upper Falkenstein Castle'', 2008]]\nIn 1025, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], Conrad's stepson from his marriage to [[Gisela of Swabia]], rebelled against his stepfather when he was elected king of Germany. By 1026, Conrad had defeated the resistance and Ernest submitted to his reign. Due to the intervention of his mother Gisela, Ernest was allowed to accompany Conrad on his expedition to Italy in 1026. During the expedition, the rebellion led by [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]] and [[Welf II, Count of Swabia|Count Welf II of Swabia]] continued. Conrad had named [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno of Augsburg]] regent of Germany while he marched south to Italy.  When Bruno was defeated by the rebels, Conrad sent Ernest back to Germany in September 1026 to end the revolt. When Ernest returned, he joined the opposition and rebelled against Conrad again.\n\nIn 1027 Conrad returned to Germany after his imperial coronation and held court at [[Augsburg]], calling upon the rebels to surrender. Ernest, trusting in the number and fidelity of his vassals, rejected the peace offer and appealed to his Swabian counts to join him in the rebellion. According to [[Wipo of Burgundy]], the counts refused, stating that while they had sworn loyalty to Ernest, they would not rebel against their Emperor. Without the support of the Swabian counts, Ernest, Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf surrendered to Conrad at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on September 9, 1027, ending the rebellion. Conrad stripped Ernest of his ducal title and imprisoned him at [[Giebichenstein Castle]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. Gisela supported Conrad against her son, but did not want Ernest to be entirely humiliated. As a result of his mother's intervention, Conrad allowed Ernest to retain his title while imprisoned, with Gisela serving as regent over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn 1028, after Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] was crowned in Aachen as King of Germany, Gisela again intervened on Ernest's behalf. Conrad pardoned Ernest and released him from prison in 1028, but Gisela retained regency over Swabia. Ernest served as duke in name only. On Easter 1030, Conrad offered to restore Ernest his full powers as Duke of Swabia if he would crack down on the Emperor's enemies there. Ernest's refusal, especially against his friend Count Werner of Kyburg, resulted in his final downfall. Conrad stripped his stepson of his title, declared him a public enemy, and had him [[excommunicated]]. Even his mother Gisela did not come to his rescue. Within a few months, both Ernest and Werner, who had retreated to ''Falkenstein Castle'', south of modern [[Schramberg]] in the [[Black Forest]] were killed in a battle against a contingent of the [[Bishop of Constance]]. The fall of Ernest greatly weakened the sovereignty of Swabia. Conrad appointed Ernest's younger brother [[Herman IV, Duke of Swabia|Herman]] as new Swabian prince. As Herman was still an infant, the Bishop of Constance was assigned his regent. Eight years later in 1038, Herman died and Conrad installed his own son Henry as duke, securing imperial control over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\n===Conflict with Adalbero===\nConrad had to enforce his [[royal prerogative]]s in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero of Carinthia]] had been appointed as duke in 1012 under Emperor Henry II and remained loyal to imperial authority, supporting Conrad's election as German king in 1024. At a [[synod]] in [[Frankfurt]] in September 1027, Conrad attempted to resolve the decades' long ''Gandersheim Conflict''. Adalbero accompanied the Emperor and acted as his sword-bearer during the proceeding, indicating Conrad's trust in him. From 1028 on, Adalbero governed his Duchy as an independent state.\n\nIn particular, he attempted to conduct peaceful relations with the [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Under Emperor Henry II, who was the brother-in-law to Stephen, relations between the Empire and Hungary had been friendly.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p= 140}}{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}} Upon Henry's death in 1024, Conrad adopted a more aggressive policy, prompting border raids into the Empire from Hungary. The raids particularly affected Adalbero's domain of Carinthia, which shared a long, eastern border with Hungary.\n\nConrad summoned Adalbero to court at [[Bamberg]] on 18 May 1035, to answer an indictment of [[treason]] for his actions regarding Hungary. In the presence of the German dukes, Conrad demanded that Adalbero be stripped of all his titles and lands. The dukes hesitated and demanded that Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], the Germany's co-King and Conrad's designated successor, join the assembly before a decision was made. Henry refused to depose Adalbero, citing an earlier agreement with Adelbero to be his ally in negotiating a settlement between him and his father. Conrad resorted to exhortations, pleas, and threats to convince Henry to support Adalbero's deposition. Henry's support was soon followed by that of the other dukes. Conrad then ordered Adalbero to be removed as Duke and sentenced him and his son to [[exile]]. After attacking Conrad's allies in Carinthia, Adalbero fled to his mother's estates in [[Ebersberg]] in the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], where he remained until his death in 1039. The duchy of Carinthia remained unoccupied until February 2, 1035, when Conrad named his cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] as the new duke. With the appointment, the three southern German duchies of Swabia, Bavaria, and Carinthia were all under the control of Emperor Conrad through his family members (his stepson Herman in Swabia, his son Henry in Bavaria, and his cousin Conrad in Carinthia).{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=84}}\n\nControl of the southern duchies allowed Conrad to continue the process begun under the [[Ottonian dynasty]], centralizing the Emperors authority over the Empire at the expense of the regional dukes. Conrad broke with Ottonian tradition, however, in favoring a more strict means of controlling rebellious vassals. Whereas the Ottonians followed a policy of informal public submission and subsequent reconciliation, Conrad used treason trials to declare rebels as \"public enemies\" to legitimize his subsequent harsh treatment, as he had done with [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II of Swabia]] and Adalbero. The nobles saw use of these treason trials not as mere power shifts in favor of the Emperor, but as a cruel breach of German tradition.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=88}}\n\n===Policy towards the Church===\n[[File:Bischof Poppo von Trier.png|thumb|[[Prince-bishop]] [[Poppo (archbishop of Trier)|Poppo von Babenberg]] was [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|archbishop of Trier]] and imperial prince of the [[Electorate of Trier]]]]\nConrad continued the [[Ottonian dynasty]]'s [[Imperial Church System]] - a policy of using the German Church as a vehicle for imperial control. Beginning in the 950s, the Ottonians had favored Church officials over secular nobles for appointment to the Empire's most important offices. Claiming \"[[divine right of king|divine right]]\" to rule the Empire, the Ottonians increasingly viewed themselves as [[defender of the faith|protectors of the Church]] and thus demanded loyalty from the Church officials.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/imperial-church-system-of-the-ottonian-and-salian-rulers-a-reconsideration/8B8887F785FC72BFD48A4A5DDF8A49C2 |title= The \u2018Imperial Church System\u2019 of the Ottonian and Salian Rulers: a Reconsideration|publisher= Cambridge Org | date=March 25, 2011   | author=Timothy Reuter   | accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref> In return, the various bishoprics and abbeys of the Empire were granted extensive landholdings and secular authority, providing immunity from the jurisdiction of the secular nobles.

Under royal service, the bishops and abbots were required to provide hospitality and accommodations to the Emperor and his court when he arrived. It also required the Church officials to act as quasi-bureaucracy for the Empire. Under military service, the Church was required to supply soldiers for the Emperors' army or to act as diplomats at his direction. Conrad energetically continued this tradition.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/><ref name=\"Bernhardt2002\">{{cite book|author=John W.

Conrad and the other members of the [[Salian dynasty]] had little interest in the founding of new monasteries. Through their hundred-year dynasty, the Salians only founded one: [[Limburg Abbey]] which was converted from a fortress to a monastery in 1025.  The Ottonians established at least eight in their hundred-year reign. Additionally, the Ottonians were active in the establishment of Church affairs, but Conrad was uninterested, only calling five [[synods]] during his reign and usually only to restore peace. Conrad's decisions on Church policy were often left to his wife [[Gisela of Swabia]]. When [[Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], [[Primate of Germany]], died in 1031, Conrad considered both [[Bardo (bishop)|Abbot Bardo]] of [[Hersfeld Abbey]] and the renowned [[theologian]] [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]], then serving as the dean of the [[cathedral chapter]] for the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of Liege]].

In January 1018, Henry II and Boles\u0142aw I signed a peace treaty, known as the [[Peace of Bautzen]],<ref name=Knefelkamp123>Knefelkamp (2002), p. 125</ref> in which the Empire and Poland declared a permanent peace with Boles\u0142aw recognizing Henry II as his nominal feudal lord.<ref name=cmh>Previte-orton, pg. 451</ref> In return, Henry II granted to Boles\u0142aw lands on the Empire's eastern border. To seal the peace, Boles\u0142aw I, a widower, reinforced his dynastic bonds with the German nobility by marrying [[Oda of Meissen]], daughter of the Saxon Margrave Eckard I of Meissen. Empire and Poland remained at peace for the remainder of Henry's reign. Henry's death in 1024 gave Boles\u0142aw an opportunity to increase his own power. Boles\u0142aw took advantage of the interregnum in Germany and crowned himself king on [[Easter]], April 25, 1025. Boles\u0142aw was thus the first Polish king as his predecessors had been considered mere \"dukes\" by both the Empire and the Pope in Rome. Boles\u0142aw died within two months of the coronation, most likely due to an illness. Boles\u0142aw's son, [[Mieszko II Lambert]], succeeded him as King, being crowned on Christmas Day 1025. Upon assuming the Polish throne, Mieszko expelled his older half-brother [[Bezprym]] and his younger brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]]. Otto went to Germany to seek Conrad's protection.\n\nConrad considered the assumption of the title \"king\" by Mieszko an act of war and a disregard of his imperial authority, but had to address domestic issues before marching against Mieszko. In 1026 Conrad II marched into Italy to assert German authority south of the Alps and to claim the imperial crown from the Pope. In his absence, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], and [[Frederick II, Duke of Upper Lorraine|Duke Frederick II of Upper Lorraine]] rebelled against his authority.\n\nThe rebels sought the support of Mieszko, which the Polish king granted and promised to take military action against Conrad. Conrad returned to Germany in mid-1027, putting an end to the rebellion before Mieszko could marshal his forces. In preparations for his own invasion of Poland, Conrad developed a closer relationship with [[Cnut the Great|Cnut, King of England and Denmark]] (whose kingdom lay along the Empire's northern border). Cnut accompanied Conrad to his coronation as emperor in 1027, and Conrad granted authority over the [[Duchy of Schleswig|March of Schleswig]], the land-bridge between Denmark and Germany.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nFearing a joint German-Danish attack, Mieszko invaded the Empire's [[March of Lusatia]] and the territory of the [[Lutici|Lutician Federation]] in 1028.<ref name=Herrmann363>Herrmann (1985), p. 363</ref> The Lutici were a federation of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] [[Polabian Slavs|Polabian]] tribes that developed in the 10th century. Located on the northeast border of Germany, the Lutici were the regular target of German aggression during the early years of the [[Ottonian dynasty]] with [[Emperor Otto I]]'s lieutenants [[Herman Billung]] and [[Gero]], subjugating many of the Slavic tribes beginning in the 940s. In 983, as part of the [[Great Slav Rising]], the Lutici initiated an open rebellion.  In the ensuing war (983-995), the Lutici succeeded in reclaiming their independence and gained control of the [[Billung March]] and [[Northern March]] from the Empire.<ref name=Luebke99>L\u00fcbke (2002), p. 99</ref> Though [[Emperor Otto III]] allied with [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] to reintegrate them into the Empire, Otto III's death ended the friendly relationship between Poland the Empire. Instead, Boles\u0142aw competed with Otto III's successor, Emperor Henry II, for dominion over the Lutici, causing Henry II to ally the Empire with the Lutici against Poland. Under the [[Peace of Bautzen]] in 1018, all three parties remained in uneasy peace, with Poland allowed to hold the Empire's [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Of the eastern marches, the Empire only retained the [[March of Lusatia]]. Mieszko's 1028 invasion ended the peace. The Lutici sent ambassadors to seek Conrad's protection against Mieszko, which Conrad granted and renewed the German-Lutician alliance.<ref name=Herrmann363/>\n\nSeeking to protect the Lutici from Polish invasion, Conrad launched a counter-invasion in 1029 and placed the Polish-held [[Bautzen]] under siege. Faced with a potential invasion by Hungary and the failure of the Lutici to provide their promised contingent of troops, Conrad retreated. In 1030, Poland secured an alliance with Hungary, with Stephen I invading Bavaria while Mieszko invaded Saxony. Conrad responded by allying with [[Yaroslav the Wise]], [[Grand Prince of Kiev]], to attack and capture [[Red Ruthenia]] on Poland's eastern border. In 1031, Conrad concluded a peace treaty with Hungary by ceding territory in eastern [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinithia]] to Hungarian control. Freed from the threat of Hungarian attack, the Emperor was able to focus his attention on attacking Poland. Marching on Mieszko in autumn 1031, Conrad laid siege at the Polish held-[[Bautzen]] in the [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Mieszko's authority was shaken by the German and Kieven invasions, and the rebellion led by his exiled brother [[Bezprym]]. Mieszko surrendered to Conrad in fall 1031. Under the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Mieszko returned control over the [[Margraviate of Meissen]] and the [[March of Lusatia]] to the Empire.\n\n====Treaty of Merseburg====\n[[File:Wojciech Gerson-Krolowa Ryksa.jpg|thumb|left|19th century painting of king [[Mieszko II Lambert|Mieszko II's]] wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]] (Wojciech Gerson, 1891) ]]\nSoon after Mieszko concluded peace with the Empire, he was deposed by his half-brother [[Bezprym]]. When Mieszko assumed the Polish throne in 1025 he exiled his brother, who fled to the protection of [[Kievan Rus]] to the east of Poland. With Meiszko's position weakened by his wars with the Empire, Bezprym, supported by Conrad, persuaded the Kevian Grand Price [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] to invade Poland and install Bezprym as the country's ruler. The Kievan invasion was a success. Mieszko fled to the [[Duchy of Bohemia]] where he was imprisoned and [[castrated]] by [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Oldrich]] in retribution for Mieszko's father [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw]]'s blinding [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years earlier. Shortly after taking power, Bezprym sent the [[Polish Crown Jewels|Polish royal crown and regalia]] to Conrad, officially renouncing the title \"king\" in favor of the traditional title \"duke\" and accepting the overlordship of the Empire over Poland.<ref>Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref> The Royal crown and regalia were delivered by Mieszko II's wife, [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]].<ref name=\"Halfond2016\"/>\n\nBezprym's reign was short. Bezprym's extreme cruelty caused his half-brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]] to lead a conspiracy. Bezprym's own men murdered him in spring 1032, created a [[power vacuum]] in Poland. Conrad responded by holding an [[hoftag|assembly]] at [[Merseburg]] in 1033 to address the situation. Conrad's wife, the Empress [[Gisela of Swabia]], interceded on Mieszko's behalf and requested he be freed from imprisonment in Bohemia and allowed to regain the Polish throne. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Conrad divided Poland between Mieszko, Otto, and another half brother Detric. Mieszko was allowed to retain the title Duke and nominal authority over all of Poland.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\">Knefelkamp (2002), p. 137</ref><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\">Boshof (2008), p. 72</ref> With a strong central leader to guide it, the treaty significantly increased the Empire's influence over Poland.\n\nThe division was short-lived: in 1033 Otto was killed by one of his own men, and Mieszko II took his domains. Shortly after, Mieszko expelled Detric, reuniting the whole country in his hands. Though Mieszko regained his former power, he still had to fight against the nobility and his own subjects. Mieszko did not accept Bezprym's renunciation of the Polish crown and continued to style himself as \"King\" instead of \"Duke\". Mieszko II died soon after in 1034, and upon his death, a [[Pagan reaction in Poland]] erupted. Subsequently, his wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Richeza]] and son [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]] fled to Germany.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\"/><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\"/>\n\n===Relations with Eastern Europe===\n\n====Bohemia====\nThe [[Duchy of Bohemia]] was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1004 during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars]], which stretched from 1002 to 1018. [[Emperor Henry II]] installed [[Jarom\u00edr, Duke of Bohemia|Jaromir]] as [[Duke of Bohemia]] and promised protection against Polish aggression in return for incorporation. Jaromir ruled only a smaller territory, however, as Poland occupied the traditional Czech territories of [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Lusatia]]. In 1012, Jaromir was deposed by his brother [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Oldrich]], who assumed the Bohemian throne for himself. Following the resumption of hostilities between the Empire and Poland in 1028, Oldrich went on the offensive against Poland, reconquering Moravia by 1029, which helped to stabilize his duchy. The war ended in 1031 when Polish King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]] surrendered to Conrad. In the civil war which followed, Meiszko was forced to flee Poland for Bohemia, where Oldrich had him imprisoned and castrated in revenge for the torture Meiszko's father, [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]], inflicted upon [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years before.<ref name=\"Prague09\">{{cite book|author1=Cosmas (of Prague)|author2=Cosmas of Prague|author3=C\u00f4me de Prague|title=The Chronicle of the Czechs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7igBN41oUC&pg=PA105|year=2009|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1570-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nPoland was unable to stabilize in the wake of Mieszko's exile, forcing Conrad to convene an assembly in July 1033 to issue the [[Treaty of Merseburg]] which restored Meiszko to the Polish throne. Conrad summoned Oldrich to appear to the assembly, but Oldrich refused. His absence raised the ire of the Emperor and Conrad, busy with securing his succession to the Burgundy throne, charged his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke Henry of Bavaria]] with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. At age 17, Henry's march on Bohemia was his first independent military command. The expedition was complete success, with Henry deposing Oldrich and restoring his brother Jaromir to the Bohemian throne, with Oldrich's son [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] appointed as Count of [[Moravia]]. Oldrich was imprisoned in Bavaria but by 1034 was pardoned and allowed to return to Bohemia.\n\nOldrich deposed and blinded Jaromir, reclaimed the Bohemian throne, and exiled his son. While the reason for the conflict between father and son has been lost, it is believed Bretislaus supported Jaromir over his father. Oldrich died suddenly on November 9, 1034, allowing Bretislaus to return from exile. Though Jaromir was offered the throne, he declined in favor of his nephew. Bretislaus was then installed as the new Duke of Bohemia by Conrad.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n====Hungary====\n\n[[File:Statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Buda Castle 2010.JPG|thumb|left|170px|alt=Equestrian statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Budapest|[[Equestrian statue]] of [[Stephen I of Hungary|King St. Stephen]], [[Budapest]], 1905]]\nWith Otto III's approval, Stephen was crowned as the first Christian [[king of Hungary]] on [[Christmas Day]], 1000.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=28}} Otto III's successor, [[Emperor Henry II]], was Stephen's brother-in-law by Stephen's marriage to Henry's sister [[Gisela of Hungary|Gisela]], furthering the friendly relationship between the Empire and Hungary.

Henry settled the conflict by 1031 by granting lands between the [[Leitha River]] and [[Fischa River]] in eastern Bavaria to Hungary.

However, Rudolph was still alive when Henry II died in 1024. Soon emperor Conrad II, as Henry II's imperial successor claimed he is also entitled to Henry II's rights on the Burgundian succession, which Rudolph disputed. [[Odo II, Count of Blois|Count Odo II of Blois]], who had strong family ties with Rudolph, also emphasized his right in the succession. Conrad II met Rudolph III in August 1027 near [[Basel]] to settle the dispute. Henry II's widowed wife, Empress [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]], mediated between the two parties.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}} An agreement was reached that allowed Conrad II to succeed to the Burgundian throne upon Rudolph's death under the same conditions as Henry II.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}} In return, Rudolph was allowed to retain independent rule over his kingdom.\n\nRudolph died on September 6, 1032, while Conrad was on campaign against [[Mieszko II Lambert|Duke Mieszko II of Poland]]. Upon Mieszko's  surrender, Conrad marched his army to Burgundy during the winter of 1032/1033. Conrad's rival to the Burgundian throne, Count Odo II of Blois had already invaded the kingdom to secure his rule and controlled large sections of the kingdom's western territories.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=30}} On February 2, 1033, Conrad arrived at [[Vaud]], where he held an assembly at the [[Payerne Priory|Abbey of Payerne]] and was crowned King of Burgundy.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}} Initially, Conrad made little progress against Odo and had to withdraw to [[Zurich]] in March.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}}  In two large-scale military summer campaigns in 1033 and 1034, Conrad defeated Odo.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}} On August 1, 1034, Conrad officially incorporated Burgundy into the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at a ceremony held in the [[St. Pierre Cathedral|Cathedral of Geneva]].{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}}\n\nThough Burgundy had been brought under full imperial control, the kingdom was allowed a remarkable degree of autonomy. Conrad rarely intervened in its affairs following his coronation, returning only in 1038 to announce his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as the kingdom's future ruler. Of central significance in the conquest of Burgundy was to augment the influence and dignity of the Emperor to the benefit of the Empire.

This was an arrangement that Conrad had made many years prior, when he gave Canute parts of northern Germany to administer.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Henry, who would later become Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], became his father's chief counselor.\n\nConrad campaigned unsuccessfully against [[Poland]] in 1028\u20131030. In 1031, Conrad and the [[Kievan Rus']] forced King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]], son and heir of [[Boleslaw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw I]], to make peace and return the land that Boles\u0142aw had taken from the Empire during the reign of Henry II. Mieszko II was compelled to give up his royal title, and for the remainder of his troubled rule became the Duke of Poland and Conrad's vassal.\n\nIn 1029 some [[Bavaria]]n border conflicts undermined the good relations with [[Stephen I of Hungary]]. One year later Conrad launched a campaign against [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]. The Hungarians successfully used [[Scorched earth|scorched earth tactics]], and Conrad had to withdraw his army. Finally, the Hungarian army forced him to surrender at [[Vienna]]. After his defeat, Conrad was obliged to cede some border territory to Hungary.\n\nWhen [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died on February 2, 1032, Conrad claimed the Kingship on the basis of an inheritance that Henry II had extorted from Rudolph in 1006, after Henry invaded [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]] to enforce his claim in 1016. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy, later known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors, corresponded to most of the southeastern quarter of modern France and included western Switzerland, the Franche-Comt\u00e9, and Dauphin\u00e9. It did not include the smaller [[Duchy of Burgundy]] to the north, ruled by a cadet branch of the Capetian [[King of France]]. (Most of the former Kingdom of Arles was incorporated into France piecemeal over the next centuries, but the King of Arles remained one of the Holy Roman Emperor's subsidiary titles until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806.)\n\nConrad upheld the rights of the ''valvassores'' (knights and burghers of the cities) of [[Italy]] against Archbishop Aribert of Milan and the local nobles. The nobles, as vassal lords, and the [[bishop]] had conspired to rescind rights from the burghers.

Hearing that [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] had received the same request, Conrad went to [[Southern Italy]], to [[Salerno]] and [[Aversa]]. He appointed Richer, from Germany, as abbot of [[Monte Cassino]], as abbot Theobald was imprisoned by Pandulf. At [[Troia (FG)|Troia]], he ordered Pandulf to restore stolen property to Monte Cassino. Pandulf sent his wife and son to ask for peace, offering {{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of gold and two of his children as hostages. The Emperor accepted Pandulf's offer, but the hostages escaped as Pandulf hid in his outlying castle of [[Sant'Agata de' Goti]].

He also recognized Aversa as a county of Salerno under [[Rainulf Drengot]], the [[Normans|Norman]] adventurer. Pandulf, meanwhile, fled to [[Constantinople]].

of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 1027 until his death in 1039. The first of a succession of four [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] emperors, who reigned for one century until 1125, Conrad also served as [[King of Germany]] from 1024, [[King of Italy]] from 1026, and [[King of Burgundy|King of Burgundy (Arelat)]] from 1033.\n\nThe son of [[Franconia]]n count [[Henry of Speyer]] (also Henry of Worms) and [[Adelaide of Metz]] of the ''Matfriding dynasty'', that had ruled the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] from 959 until 972, Conrad inherited the titles of count of [[Speyer]] and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] during childhood after his father had died around the year 990. He extended his influence beyond his inherited lands, as he came into favor of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] of the kingdom. When the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|dynastic line]] was left without a successor after [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II's]] death in 1024, on September 4 an assembly of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|imperial princes]] appointed the 34 year-old Conrad king (''Rex romanorum'').{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=18}}<ref name=\"Weinfurter99\"/>\n\nConrad II largely continued the political course, the ''Renovatio regni Francorum'' of his [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] predecessor Henry II regarding the role of the Church and the status and affairs of Italy. He proceeded to evolve the [[Proprietary church]] as a basis for imperial power, preferring to appoint clerics over secular lords for important offices throughout the empire. Like Henry II before him, he insisted on his feudal claim (''Honor Imperii''), yet granted Italy a high degree of self-governance, near complete economic autonomy and recognized and respected the political importance and influence of the city of [[Rome]] and its [[Roman Curia|curia]] in particular.<ref name=boni/><ref name=\"Blumenthal1988\">{{cite book|author=Uta-Renate Blumenthal|title=The Investiture Controversy: Church and Monarchy from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tZhHot9CuEC&pg=PA45|year=1988|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1386-6|pages=45\u2013}}</ref> His reign marked a high point of medieval imperial rule during a relatively peaceful period for the empire.

His son, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], succeeded him as Count in 941 and [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I of Germany]] (the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) appointed him as [[Duke of Lorraine]] in 944. He was subsequently married to [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], one of Otto's daughters, in 947 and became one of the king's closest allies. The relationship was strained, however, when Otto refused to honor a peace treaty Conrad, as Otto's representative, had conducted with the rebellious [[Berengar II of Italy]]. Conrad also resented the growing influence of Otto's brother [[Henry I, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Bavaria]], which he saw as threatening his own power. In 953 Conrad joined the king's son [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]] in rebellion against Otto, but the rebellion was defeated and Conrad was stripped of his duchy. Conrad and Otto were soon reconciled, with Conrad fighting for Otto in the great [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955. Though the Germans were successful in halting the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe]], Conrad lost his life in the battle. Conrad was succeeded as Count of Worms in 956 by his son [[Otto of Worms]], a grandson of Otto I. Sometime between 965 and 970 Otto of Worms' oldest son, [[Henry of Speyer]], was born. Little is known of his life as he died the age of 20 between 985 and 990. Conrad II's father was [[Henry of Speyer]], and his mother was [[Adelaide of Metz]], an area of [[Upper Lorraine]]. After Henry's death, Adelaide married a Frankish nobleman. After her remarriage, Adelaide demonstrated no close relationship with her son.<ref name=urku>{{cite web |url= https://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000448_00011.html?zoom=0.75&leftTab=toc&sortIndex=030:040:0004:010:00:00 |title= Konrad II  |publisher= Monumenta Germaniae Historica  | date= | author= | accessdate= January 29, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn 978 [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] appointed his nephew Otto of Worms as [[Duke of Carinthia]] after deposing the rebellious Duke [[Henry III, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Carinthia]] during the [[War of the Three Henries (977\u2013978)|War of the Three Henries]]. Upon receiving the ducal title, however, Otto lost his position at Worms, which was given to Bishop [[Hildebald]], Otto II's imperial chancellor. When Otto II died suddenly in 983, his infant son [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] succeeded him, with his mother [[Theophanu]] serving as regent. Theophanu sought to reconcile the imperial house with Henry I, restoring him as Duke of Carinthia in 985, with Otto of Worms allowed to regain his ancestral position as Count of Worms. However, Otto was allowed to style himself \"Duke of Worms\" and his original territory was expanded so as not to diminish his rank. Otto of Worms remained loyal to the new Emperor, receiving rulership of the [[March of Verona]] in 955, though the actual Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Bavaria]]. In 996, Otto III appointed Otto of Worms' son Bruno as [[Pope Gregory V]]. When Emperor Otto III died in 1002, both Otto of Worms, Conrad's grandfather, and Henry IV were candidates for election as King of Germany. In a compromise, Otto withdrew and received the Duchy of Carinthia from the newly elected Henry IV, who ruled as ''Henry II of Germany'', in return. As a result, Otto of Worms renounced his holdings in Worms to [[Burchard of Worms|Bishop Burchard of Worms]], a long-time political rival. Buchard assumed care for Conrad, providing his education and upbringing by 1000.\n\nAfter the early death of his uncle Duke [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad I of Carinthia]], the elder Conrad's infant son, [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], was named Count of Worms by Emperor Henry II while the Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Adalbero of Eppenstein]] due to Conrad the Younger's infancy. Conrad the Younger was placed in Conrad's care.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\">{{cite book|author1=Lenelotte M\u00f6ller|author2=Hans Ammerich|title=Die Salier: 1024-1125 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZd4DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT3|date=1 December 2015|publisher=marixverlag|isbn=978-3-8438-0474-5|pages=3\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Weinfurter99\"/>\n\n===Adulthood===\nConrad married [[Gisela of Swabia]], a twice widowed [[duchess]], in 1016.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=32}} Gisela was the daughter of [[Herman II of Swabia|Duke Herman II of Swabia]] who, in 1002, unsuccessfully claimed the German throne following [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]'s death, losing the election to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]]. Gisela was first married to [[Brun I, Count of Brunswick|Count Bruno I of Brunswick]] the same year. Following Bruno's death around 1010, Gisela married [[Ernest I, Duke of Swabia|Ernest I]] of the [[House of Babenberg]]. By the marriage, Ernest I inherited the [[Duchy of Swabia]] at the death of Gisela's brother [[Herman III, Duke of Swabia|Duke Herman III of Swabia]] in 1012. This marriage produced two sons: [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]] and Herman. After the death of Ernest I in 1015, Emperor Henry II named Ernest II as Duke of Swabia. As Gisela's new husband, Conrad hoped to serve as regent for his minor stepson in the administration of the duchy, seeing it as an opportunity to increase his own rank and subsequently make a claim for his own duchy. Emperor Henry II blocked this attempt by placing the guardianship of Ernest II, and regency over Swabia, in the hands of [[Poppo (Archbishop of Trier)|Archbishop Poppo of Trier]] in 1016. This action further strained the already rough relationship between the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|House of Otto]] and the [[Salian dynasty|Salian family]].\n\nConrad II's hopes of obtaining his own duchy failed, but his marriage to Gisela brought him wealth. Her mother, [[Gerberga of Burgundy]], was the daughter of reigning [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundian King]] [[Conrad of Burgundy]] and granddaughter of the late [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish King]] [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]]. Gisela also claimed descent from [[Charlemagne]] through both her mother and her father. The marriage was problematic because of the familial relationship shared by Gisela and Conrad: both were descendants of [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian King]] [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]], Henry in the fifth generation and Gisela in the fourth. According to [[canon law]], marriage was not allowed among relatives of the first to seventh generations. Though Conrad's marriage differed little from the usual practice of the time, strict canonists took exception to the marriage and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] used this breach of canonical law to force Conrad into temporary exile. During this exile, Gisela bore Conrad a son, [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], on October 28, 1017. Conrad and Emperor Henry II were eventually reconciled, allowing him to return to Germany.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Reign as King==\n\n===Royal election===\nEmperor Henry II died in 1024. Childless, Henry's death brought the [[Ottonian dynasty]], which had ruled Germany since 919, to an end. Without a clear successor as [[King of Germany]], Henry's widow [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] served as regent while the German dukes gathered to elect a new king. Cunigunde was assisted by her brothers [[Dietrich I of Metz|Bishop Dietrich I of Metz]] and [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]]. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbiship Aribo of Mainz]], the [[Primate of Germany]], also assisted Cunigunde.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bmagon.html |title= Archbishop Aribo di Magonza  |publisher= Catholic-Hierarchy  | date=July 24, 2017 | author= | accessdate= January 30, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Konr\u00e1d2.jpg|thumb|left|Conrad&nbsp;II, depicted in the Chronicle of [[Ekkehard von Aura]]]]\n\nOn September 4, 1024, the German princes gathered at ''Kamba'', a historical name for an area on the east banks of the [[Rhine River]] opposite the modern German town of [[Oppenheim]]. Now the location of ''Kamba'' is marked with a small equestrian statue of Conrad II. The chronicler and Conrad's [[chaplain]], [[Wipo of Burgundy]] attended the meeting and documented the event. Archbishop Aribo presided over the assembly. Conrad presented himself as a candidate for election, as did his younger cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]].

The [[Duchy of Saxony]] adopted a neutral strategy while the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] favored the younger Conrad. A majority of the assembled princes favored the elder Conrad, as the father of a seven-year-old son implied a more stable dynastic future for the kingdom. As president of the assembly, Archbishop Aribo cast the first vote and supported the elder Conrad. He was joined by the other clerics in support of him. The secular dukes then cast their votes for the elder Conrad as well.

The political reorientation of Pilgrim also weakened the opposition towards the new king.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\n===Early reign===\n\n[[File:Adelaide, Abbess of Quedlinburg and Sophia, Abbess of Gandersheim.jpg|thumb|left|Adelaide, Abbess of Quedlinburg and Sophia, Abbess of Gandersheim]]\n[[File:Bad-Gandersheim-Stiftskirche-Seite-vorn.JPG|thumb|[[Collegiate Church]], [[Bad Gandersheim]], (from southwest)]]\n[[File:Bad Gandersheim - Stiftskirche - innen - Kirchenschiff.JPG|thumb|nave of [[Collegiate Church]], [[Bad Gandersheim]]]]\nConrad inherited a kingdom troubled by numerous problems. The duchies of Saxony and Lorraine were in opposition to his rule, as well as his cousin Conrad of Carinthia. To secure his reign, Conrad went on a tour of Germany, making stops in [[Augsburg]] to receive the support of [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno]], and at [[Strasbourg]] to receive the support of [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Bishop Werner]], the brothers of the late Emperor Henry II. Both were appointed to high-ranking offices at Conrad's court. Traveling from Cologne to [[Aachen]], the site of Charlemagne's old capital, Conrad continued the tradition of claiming the right to rule Germany as successor to Charlemagne. Despite the continuance of this Ottonian tradition, the Duchy of Lorraine still did not accept his rule. Conrad then traveled north to Saxony, visiting [[Adelaide I, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Adelaide I of Quedlinburg]] and [[Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim|Abbess Sophia I of Gandersheim]], both daughters of the late Ottonian [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]]. Their support of Conrad's rule greatly influenced the Saxony nobility. Celebrating [[Christmas]] at [[Minden]], the Saxon nobles, led by [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bernard II]], recognized Conrad as their king after he promised he would respect Saxon law. Conrad and Gisela would remain in Saxony during the winter until March 1025. Upon leaving Saxony, Conrad traveled to the [[Duchy of Swabia]], celebrating [[Easter]] at [[Augsburg]]. He then traveled to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] to celebrate [[Pentecost]] at [[Regensburg]]. Conrad next traveled to [[Zurich]] near the German-Burgundian border. In 1016, Emperor Henry II forced the childless Burgundian King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] to name him as his heir. With Henry's death in 1024, Conrad claimed the same rights over Burgundy. This ended his tour of Germany, visiting all major regions of the kingdom within ten months of his election.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\"/>\n\nConrad had to address the longstanding ''[[Gandersheim Conflict]]'' upon assuming the German throne. The forty-year conflict stretched back to 989, during the reign of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]], over control of [[Gandersheim Abbey]] and its estates. Both the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and the [[Bishop of Hildesheim]] claimed authority over the Abbey, including the authority to anoint the Abbey's nuns. Though Otto III eased the tensions between the parties by declaring that both bishops would anoint the Abbess, the conflict continued. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], the new [[Primate of Germany]], sought to overturn this precedent. Conrad was indebted to Aribo for his support during the royal election and worked to support his ally. In January 1027, the king called a [[synod]] at [[Frankfurt]] to resolve the dispute, but a conclusion was not reached. Conrad called a second synod in September 1028, which likewise failed to find a solution. Only a third synod in 1030 ended the conflict when [[Gotthard of Hildesheim|Bishop Gotthard of Hildesheim]] renounced his claims to the monastery in favor of Aribo.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\">{{cite book|author=Herwig Wolfram|title=Conrad II, 990-1039: Emperor of Three Kingdoms - The Dispute over Gandersheim p.95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zuKIX5g6MgoC&pg=PA443|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04818-2|pages=443\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Davids2002\">{{cite book|author=Adelbert Davids|title=The Empress Theophano: Byzantium and the West at the Turn of the First Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9Nf-GHTgnEC&pg=PA92|date=15 August 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52467-4|pages=92\u2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring his travel to Augsburg, a conflict broke out between Conrad and his younger cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]]. The reasons for the dispute are not clear, however, the younger Conrad claimed he did not receive the compensation the king had promised him for withdrawing from the 1024 election. Both men might have reconciled sometimes before September 1027 as Conrad the Younger had ceased to oppose Conrad II.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=20}}\n\n===Unrest in Italy===\n[[File:Iron Crown.JPG|thumb|300px|Following his expedition into Italy in early 1026, Conrad II was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] as the [[King of the Lombards]].]]\nIn Bavaria, Conrad was brought into contact with the Italian ruling elite for the first time. In June 1025, [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]], and other bishops from [[Northern Italy]], traveled north over the Alps to pay homage to Conrad. In exchange for certain privileges in the governing of Italy, Aribert agreed to crown Conrad with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]].{{sfn|Bury|1922|p=264}} The situation in Italy was unstable after the death of the Henry II. The secular nobles believed the Italian throne to be vacant, not accepting Conrad's automatic succession as a matter of right. Instead, the secular nobles offered the Italian crown to the  [[House of Capet|Capetian]] [[Robert II of France|King Robert II of France]] and his son [[Hugh Magnus]]. After he rejected the offer, the secular lords approached [[William V, Duke of Aquitaine|Duke William V of Aquitaine]]. Though initially excited by the offer, William V subsequently rejected it as well.\n\nIn addition to the ecclesiastical mission, secular Italian nobles from [[Pavia]] also traveled north to Conrad. While Conrad's election did not meet significant obstacles north of the Alps, in Italy, in the aftermath of the death of [[Emperor Henry II]], there were several riots, and some Italian nobles attempted to separate the [[Kingdom of Italy]] from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. When the news spread of Henry's death, the citizens of [[Pavia]] revolted, destroying the imperial palace, which dated to the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogothic King]] [[Theodoric the Great]] during the 5th century. Though Pavia had lost is position as the seat of royal administration in Italy under the Ottonian dynasty, the palace had been a great symbol of imperial authority in Italy. Pavia, thanks to its strategic location situated on the trade routes from Italy to Burgundy and France, had become an important commercial center. Traders of the lower nobility demanded greater autonomy from imperial control. The nobility saw the mere presence of the imperial palace within the city walls intolerable.<ref name=boni>{{cite web |url= https://www.academia.edu/40250313/Reconsidering_Donizone_s_Vita_Mathildis_again_Boniface_of_Canossa_and_the_Emperor_Conrad_II |title= Boniface of Canossa and the Emperor Conrad III  |publisher= Academiaa  | date=July 24, 2017 | author=Robert Houghton | accessdate= January 30, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nAmbassadors from Pavia traveled north to meet with the German king. According to Conrad's personal cleric Wipo, the Italian kingship was not \"durable\" with the German throne but instead a mere \"[[personal union]]\". Italy was a separate nation from Germany with its own identity, not a permanent [[political union]]. They tried to justify the actions of their fellow citizens, claiming that Pavia had always been loyal to the Italian king, as long as the king was alive, and that the revolt had taken place when the Italian throne was vacant. Therefore, the burning of the palace should be excused. Conrad rejected their argument, however, saying that just as a ship remains after the death of its captain, the Empire remains after the death of the Emperor. The kingship of Italy, according to Conrad, belonged to him as king of Germany as a matter of legal right. Conrad also declared that the palace was property of the Empire, not of the old king, and therefore the new king had the right to punish those responsible. The secular nobles returned to Italy in opposition to [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] rule.<ref name=boni/>\n\nIn February 1026, Conrad assembled an army of thousands of armored knights for an expedition into Italy, including troops commanded by both [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]] and [[Pilgrim (archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne]]. Conrad's army marched south, besieging Pavia, but the city walls blocked the attackers. Conrad decided to leave a contingent of soldiers to keep the city under siege, blocking all trade in the area, and continued his campaign. By March 1026, Conrad arrived in [[Milan]] and was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of the Lombards]] by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]] as [[King of the Lombards]]. From Milan, Conrad traveled to [[Vercelli]], where he celebrated [[Easter]] with the aged [[Leo of Vercelli|Bishop Leo of Vercelli]], who had been a chief advisor to the late [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. When Leo died a few days later, Archbishop Aribert became the chief supporter of the [[Salian dynasty]] in Italy. With Conrad's assistance, Aribert became highest ranking religious figure in Italy and oversaw the expansion of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan. In June 1026, Conrad marched with his army to [[Ravenna]], but quartering his soldiers alongside the Ravennese population caused tension in the city. Conrad marched north to mitigate the risk the summer heat posed to his army. In autumn Conrad left his summer camp in the [[Po valley]] and marched to the Burgundian border. Conrad then celebrated [[Christmas]] at [[Ivrea]]. By the end of winter, the secular nobles of Italy voluntarily ended their opposition to Conrad's reign. Pavia, however, remained in revolt until early 1027 when [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo of Cluny]] brokered a peace deal between the city and Conrad.<ref name=\"Halfond2016\">{{cite book|author=Gregory I.

Conrad was crowned as Emperor on March 26, 1027, by [[Pope John XIX]].]]\nOn March 26, 1027, [[Pope John XIX]] crowned Conrad and his wife Gisela as [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] and Empress, respectively, in [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=102}} The coronation was attended by [[Cnut the Great|Cnut the Great, King of England, Denmark and Norway]], [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]] and 70 high-ranking clerics, including the Archbishops of Cologne, Mainz, Trier, Magdeburg, Salzburg, Milan, and Ravenna.{{sfn|Heer|1968|p=51}} Conrad's son and heir [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] also  attended. Rudolph's attendance marked an improvement in the relationship between Burgundy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the seven-day coronation ceremony, a rank dispute between the archbishops of Milan and Ravenna arose, with Conrad deciding in favor of Milan. Following the synod, Conrad traveled south to receive [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] from the southern Italian states of [[Principality of Capua]], the [[Principality of Salerno]], and the [[Duchy of Benevento]].<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\">{{cite book|author=Stefan Weinfurter|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChuTjtrf9xIC&pg=PA228|year=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3508-8|page=28\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter his coronation, Conrad issued decrees to reorganize the monasteries and dioceses of Italy with the particular goal of bringing the church at [[Venice]] under Imperial control (see the ''[[Schism of the Three Chapters]]''). On April 6, 1027, at a [[synod]] held in the [[Lateran Basilica]] with [[Pope John XIX]], the Emperor resolved the dispute in favor of Old-Aquileia. The [[Patriarchate of Aquileia|Patriarch of Aquleia]] [[Poppo of Treffen|Poppo]] had been a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry II, who appointed him as Patriarch in 1020 during the Emperor's campaign to reassert his authority in Italy. Conrad's action placed the church at Grado under Poppo's authority, securing Poppo's loyalty by making him the Emperor's top official in northern Italy. The synod ended the independence of the Grado church and limited the political autonomy of Venice. In so doing, Conrad broke with the policies of his predecessors and revoked Venice's privileged trading status.\n\nToward the end of May 1027, Conrad returned north to Germany to attend the funeral of [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]] at [[Regensburg]]. With the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] left vacant, Conrad asserted his right to name a next duke as a matter of [[royal prerogative]], taking the unprecedented decision of naming his 10-year-old son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as Duke of Bavaria despite the existence of candidates with a better claim to the Duchy. Never before had the Bavarian Duchy passed to a non-member of the Bavarian ducal family.\n\nThe young prince assumed the Bavarian dignity on 24 June 1027. Following Henry's appointment, Conrad held court at Regensburg and issued a decree requiring an accounting of all imperial property in the duchy. This required the various counts and bishops to report to Conrad all property they possessed in their castles and abbeys that belonged to the Emperor. Even the [[Dowager Empress]] [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] was required to report to Conrad, with the Emperor even claiming Cunegonde's ''[[wittum]]'' (money and property left to her by her late husband Emperor Henry II) as belonging to him. Conrad's promotion of imperial authority over the ducal succession and his claims to property throughout Bavaria caused tension between him and the German aristocracy, who viewed Conrad's actions as infringing upon their privileges.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Uprising in Swabia===\n[[File:MPano 07.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Konstanz Minster]], seat of the [[Bishop of Constance]]]]\n[[File:Oberfalkenstein.jpg|thumb|200px|left|ruins of the ''Upper Falkenstein Castle'', 2008]]\nIn 1025, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], Conrad's stepson from his marriage to [[Gisela of Swabia]], rebelled against his stepfather when he was elected king of Germany. By 1026, Conrad had defeated the resistance and Ernest submitted to his reign. Due to the intervention of his mother Gisela, Ernest was allowed to accompany Conrad on his expedition to Italy in 1026. During the expedition, the rebellion led by [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]] and [[Welf II, Count of Swabia|Count Welf II of Swabia]] continued. Conrad had named [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno of Augsburg]] regent of Germany while he marched south to Italy.  When Bruno was defeated by the rebels, Conrad sent Ernest back to Germany in September 1026 to end the revolt. When Ernest returned, he joined the opposition and rebelled against Conrad again.\n\nIn 1027 Conrad returned to Germany after his imperial coronation and held court at [[Augsburg]], calling upon the rebels to surrender. Ernest, trusting in the number and fidelity of his vassals, rejected the peace offer and appealed to his Swabian counts to join him in the rebellion. According to [[Wipo of Burgundy]], the counts refused, stating that while they had sworn loyalty to Ernest, they would not rebel against their Emperor. Without the support of the Swabian counts, Ernest, Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf surrendered to Conrad at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on September 9, 1027, ending the rebellion. Conrad stripped Ernest of his ducal title and imprisoned him at [[Giebichenstein Castle]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. Gisela supported Conrad against her son, but did not want Ernest to be entirely humiliated. As a result of his mother's intervention, Conrad allowed Ernest to retain his title while imprisoned, with Gisela serving as regent over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn 1028, after Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] was crowned in Aachen as King of Germany, Gisela again intervened on Ernest's behalf. Conrad pardoned Ernest and released him from prison in 1028, but Gisela retained regency over Swabia. Ernest served as duke in name only. On Easter 1030, Conrad offered to restore Ernest his full powers as Duke of Swabia if he would crack down on the Emperor's enemies there. Ernest's refusal, especially against his friend Count Werner of Kyburg, resulted in his final downfall. Conrad stripped his stepson of his title, declared him a public enemy, and had him [[excommunicated]]. Even his mother Gisela did not come to his rescue. Within a few months, both Ernest and Werner, who had retreated to ''Falkenstein Castle'', south of modern [[Schramberg]] in the [[Black Forest]] were killed in a battle against a contingent of the [[Bishop of Constance]]. The fall of Ernest greatly weakened the sovereignty of Swabia. Conrad appointed Ernest's younger brother [[Herman IV, Duke of Swabia|Herman]] as new Swabian prince. As Herman was still an infant, the Bishop of Constance was assigned his regent. Eight years later in 1038, Herman died and Conrad installed his own son Henry as duke, securing imperial control over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\n===Conflict with Adalbero===\nConrad had to enforce his [[royal prerogative]]s in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero of Carinthia]] had been appointed as duke in 1012 under Emperor Henry II and remained loyal to imperial authority, supporting Conrad's election as German king in 1024. At a [[synod]] in [[Frankfurt]] in September 1027, Conrad attempted to resolve the decades' long ''Gandersheim Conflict''. Adalbero accompanied the Emperor and acted as his sword-bearer during the proceeding, indicating Conrad's trust in him. From 1028 on, Adalbero governed his Duchy as an independent state.\n\nIn particular, he attempted to conduct peaceful relations with the [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Under Emperor Henry II, who was the brother-in-law to Stephen, relations between the Empire and Hungary had been friendly.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p= 140}}{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}} Upon Henry's death in 1024, Conrad adopted a more aggressive policy, prompting border raids into the Empire from Hungary. The raids particularly affected Adalbero's domain of Carinthia, which shared a long, eastern border with Hungary.\n\nConrad summoned Adalbero to court at [[Bamberg]] on 18 May 1035, to answer an indictment of [[treason]] for his actions regarding Hungary. In the presence of the German dukes, Conrad demanded that Adalbero be stripped of all his titles and lands. The dukes hesitated and demanded that Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], the Germany's co-King and Conrad's designated successor, join the assembly before a decision was made. Henry refused to depose Adalbero, citing an earlier agreement with Adelbero to be his ally in negotiating a settlement between him and his father. Conrad resorted to exhortations, pleas, and threats to convince Henry to support Adalbero's deposition. Henry's support was soon followed by that of the other dukes. Conrad then ordered Adalbero to be removed as Duke and sentenced him and his son to [[exile]]. After attacking Conrad's allies in Carinthia, Adalbero fled to his mother's estates in [[Ebersberg]] in the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], where he remained until his death in 1039. The duchy of Carinthia remained unoccupied until February 2, 1035, when Conrad named his cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] as the new duke. With the appointment, the three southern German duchies of Swabia, Bavaria, and Carinthia were all under the control of Emperor Conrad through his family members (his stepson Herman in Swabia, his son Henry in Bavaria, and his cousin Conrad in Carinthia).{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=84}}\n\nControl of the southern duchies allowed Conrad to continue the process begun under the [[Ottonian dynasty]], centralizing the Emperors authority over the Empire at the expense of the regional dukes. Conrad broke with Ottonian tradition, however, in favoring a more strict means of controlling rebellious vassals. Whereas the Ottonians followed a policy of informal public submission and subsequent reconciliation, Conrad used treason trials to declare rebels as \"public enemies\" to legitimize his subsequent harsh treatment, as he had done with [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II of Swabia]] and Adalbero. The nobles saw use of these treason trials not as mere power shifts in favor of the Emperor, but as a cruel breach of German tradition.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=88}}\n\n===Policy towards the Church===\n[[File:Bischof Poppo von Trier.png|thumb|[[Prince-bishop]] [[Poppo (archbishop of Trier)|Poppo von Babenberg]] was [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|archbishop of Trier]] and imperial prince of the [[Electorate of Trier]]]]\nConrad continued the [[Ottonian dynasty]]'s [[Imperial Church System]] - a policy of using the German Church as a vehicle for imperial control. Beginning in the 950s, the Ottonians had favored Church officials over secular nobles for appointment to the Empire's most important offices. Claiming \"[[divine right of king|divine right]]\" to rule the Empire, the Ottonians increasingly viewed themselves as [[defender of the faith|protectors of the Church]] and thus demanded loyalty from the Church officials.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/imperial-church-system-of-the-ottonian-and-salian-rulers-a-reconsideration/8B8887F785FC72BFD48A4A5DDF8A49C2 |title= The \u2018Imperial Church System\u2019 of the Ottonian and Salian Rulers: a Reconsideration|publisher= Cambridge Org | date=March 25, 2011   | author=Timothy Reuter   | accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref> In return, the various bishoprics and abbeys of the Empire were granted extensive landholdings and secular authority, providing immunity from the jurisdiction of the secular nobles.

Under royal service, the bishops and abbots were required to provide hospitality and accommodations to the Emperor and his court when he arrived. It also required the Church officials to act as quasi-bureaucracy for the Empire. Under military service, the Church was required to supply soldiers for the Emperors' army or to act as diplomats at his direction. Conrad energetically continued this tradition.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/><ref name=\"Bernhardt2002\">{{cite book|author=John W.

Conrad and the other members of the [[Salian dynasty]] had little interest in the founding of new monasteries. Through their hundred-year dynasty, the Salians only founded one: [[Limburg Abbey]] which was converted from a fortress to a monastery in 1025.  The Ottonians established at least eight in their hundred-year reign. Additionally, the Ottonians were active in the establishment of Church affairs, but Conrad was uninterested, only calling five [[synods]] during his reign and usually only to restore peace. Conrad's decisions on Church policy were often left to his wife [[Gisela of Swabia]]. When [[Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], [[Primate of Germany]], died in 1031, Conrad considered both [[Bardo (bishop)|Abbot Bardo]] of [[Hersfeld Abbey]] and the renowned [[theologian]] [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]], then serving as the dean of the [[cathedral chapter]] for the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of Liege]]. Though Conrad favored Wazo to lead the German Church as Archbishop and Primate, Gisela convinced him to appoint Bardo instead.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n===Relations with Poland===\n\n====War with Mieszko====\n[[File:Polska 992 - 1025.png|thumb|350px|right|The [[Duchies of Poland|Duchy of Poland]] at its greatest extent under [[Boleslaw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw I]] and his son [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]].]]\n\n[[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] warred with [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] three times during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars from 1002 to 1018]]. In January 1018, Henry II and Boles\u0142aw I signed a peace treaty, known as the [[Peace of Bautzen]],<ref name=Knefelkamp123>Knefelkamp (2002), p. 125</ref> in which the Empire and Poland declared a permanent peace with Boles\u0142aw recognizing Henry II as his nominal feudal lord.<ref name=cmh>Previte-orton, pg. 451</ref> In return, Henry II granted to Boles\u0142aw lands on the Empire's eastern border. To seal the peace, Boles\u0142aw I, a widower, reinforced his dynastic bonds with the German nobility by marrying [[Oda of Meissen]], daughter of the Saxon Margrave Eckard I of Meissen. Empire and Poland remained at peace for the remainder of Henry's reign. Henry's death in 1024 gave Boles\u0142aw an opportunity to increase his own power. Boles\u0142aw took advantage of the interregnum in Germany and crowned himself king on [[Easter]], April 25, 1025. Boles\u0142aw was thus the first Polish king as his predecessors had been considered mere \"dukes\" by both the Empire and the Pope in Rome. Boles\u0142aw died within two months of the coronation, most likely due to an illness. Boles\u0142aw's son, [[Mieszko II Lambert]], succeeded him as King, being crowned on Christmas Day 1025. Upon assuming the Polish throne, Mieszko expelled his older half-brother [[Bezprym]] and his younger brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]]. Otto went to Germany to seek Conrad's protection.\n\nConrad considered the assumption of the title \"king\" by Mieszko an act of war and a disregard of his imperial authority, but had to address domestic issues before marching against Mieszko. In 1026 Conrad II marched into Italy to assert German authority south of the Alps and to claim the imperial crown from the Pope. In his absence, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], and [[Frederick II, Duke of Upper Lorraine|Duke Frederick II of Upper Lorraine]] rebelled against his authority.\n\nThe rebels sought the support of Mieszko, which the Polish king granted and promised to take military action against Conrad. Conrad returned to Germany in mid-1027, putting an end to the rebellion before Mieszko could marshal his forces. In preparations for his own invasion of Poland, Conrad developed a closer relationship with [[Cnut the Great|Cnut, King of England and Denmark]] (whose kingdom lay along the Empire's northern border). Cnut accompanied Conrad to his coronation as emperor in 1027, and Conrad granted authority over the [[Duchy of Schleswig|March of Schleswig]], the land-bridge between Denmark and Germany.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nFearing a joint German-Danish attack, Mieszko invaded the Empire's [[March of Lusatia]] and the territory of the [[Lutici|Lutician Federation]] in 1028.<ref name=Herrmann363>Herrmann (1985), p. 363</ref> The Lutici were a federation of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] [[Polabian Slavs|Polabian]] tribes that developed in the 10th century. Located on the northeast border of Germany, the Lutici were the regular target of German aggression during the early years of the [[Ottonian dynasty]] with [[Emperor Otto I]]'s lieutenants [[Herman Billung]] and [[Gero]], subjugating many of the Slavic tribes beginning in the 940s. In 983, as part of the [[Great Slav Rising]], the Lutici initiated an open rebellion.  In the ensuing war (983-995), the Lutici succeeded in reclaiming their independence and gained control of the [[Billung March]] and [[Northern March]] from the Empire.<ref name=Luebke99>L\u00fcbke (2002), p. 99</ref> Though [[Emperor Otto III]] allied with [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] to reintegrate them into the Empire, Otto III's death ended the friendly relationship between Poland the Empire. Instead, Boles\u0142aw competed with Otto III's successor, Emperor Henry II, for dominion over the Lutici, causing Henry II to ally the Empire with the Lutici against Poland. Under the [[Peace of Bautzen]] in 1018, all three parties remained in uneasy peace, with Poland allowed to hold the Empire's [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Of the eastern marches, the Empire only retained the [[March of Lusatia]]. Mieszko's 1028 invasion ended the peace. The Lutici sent ambassadors to seek Conrad's protection against Mieszko, which Conrad granted and renewed the German-Lutician alliance.<ref name=Herrmann363/>\n\nSeeking to protect the Lutici from Polish invasion, Conrad launched a counter-invasion in 1029 and placed the Polish-held [[Bautzen]] under siege. Faced with a potential invasion by Hungary and the failure of the Lutici to provide their promised contingent of troops, Conrad retreated. In 1030, Poland secured an alliance with Hungary, with Stephen I invading Bavaria while Mieszko invaded Saxony. Conrad responded by allying with [[Yaroslav the Wise]], [[Grand Prince of Kiev]], to attack and capture [[Red Ruthenia]] on Poland's eastern border. In 1031, Conrad concluded a peace treaty with Hungary by ceding territory in eastern [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinithia]] to Hungarian control. Freed from the threat of Hungarian attack, the Emperor was able to focus his attention on attacking Poland. Marching on Mieszko in autumn 1031, Conrad laid siege at the Polish held-[[Bautzen]] in the [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Mieszko's authority was shaken by the German and Kieven invasions, and the rebellion led by his exiled brother [[Bezprym]]. Mieszko surrendered to Conrad in fall 1031. Under the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Mieszko returned control over the [[Margraviate of Meissen]] and the [[March of Lusatia]] to the Empire.\n\n====Treaty of Merseburg====\n[[File:Wojciech Gerson-Krolowa Ryksa.jpg|thumb|left|19th century painting of king [[Mieszko II Lambert|Mieszko II's]] wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]] (Wojciech Gerson, 1891) ]]\nSoon after Mieszko concluded peace with the Empire, he was deposed by his half-brother [[Bezprym]]. When Mieszko assumed the Polish throne in 1025 he exiled his brother, who fled to the protection of [[Kievan Rus]] to the east of Poland. With Meiszko's position weakened by his wars with the Empire, Bezprym, supported by Conrad, persuaded the Kevian Grand Price [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] to invade Poland and install Bezprym as the country's ruler. The Kievan invasion was a success. Mieszko fled to the [[Duchy of Bohemia]] where he was imprisoned and [[castrated]] by [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Oldrich]] in retribution for Mieszko's father [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw]]'s blinding [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years earlier. Shortly after taking power, Bezprym sent the [[Polish Crown Jewels|Polish royal crown and regalia]] to Conrad, officially renouncing the title \"king\" in favor of the traditional title \"duke\" and accepting the overlordship of the Empire over Poland.<ref>Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref> The Royal crown and regalia were delivered by Mieszko II's wife, [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]].<ref name=\"Halfond2016\"/>\n\nBezprym's reign was short. Bezprym's extreme cruelty caused his half-brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]] to lead a conspiracy. Bezprym's own men murdered him in spring 1032, created a [[power vacuum]] in Poland. Conrad responded by holding an [[hoftag|assembly]] at [[Merseburg]] in 1033 to address the situation. Conrad's wife, the Empress [[Gisela of Swabia]], interceded on Mieszko's behalf and requested he be freed from imprisonment in Bohemia and allowed to regain the Polish throne. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Conrad divided Poland between Mieszko, Otto, and another half brother Detric. Mieszko was allowed to retain the title Duke and nominal authority over all of Poland.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\">Knefelkamp (2002), p. 137</ref><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\">Boshof (2008), p. 72</ref> With a strong central leader to guide it, the treaty significantly increased the Empire's influence over Poland.\n\nThe division was short-lived: in 1033 Otto was killed by one of his own men, and Mieszko II took his domains. Shortly after, Mieszko expelled Detric, reuniting the whole country in his hands. Though Mieszko regained his former power, he still had to fight against the nobility and his own subjects. Mieszko did not accept Bezprym's renunciation of the Polish crown and continued to style himself as \"King\" instead of \"Duke\". Mieszko II died soon after in 1034, and upon his death, a [[Pagan reaction in Poland]] erupted. Subsequently, his wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Richeza]] and son [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]] fled to Germany.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\"/><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\"/>\n\n===Relations with Eastern Europe===\n\n====Bohemia====\nThe [[Duchy of Bohemia]] was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1004 during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars]], which stretched from 1002 to 1018. [[Emperor Henry II]] installed [[Jarom\u00edr, Duke of Bohemia|Jaromir]] as [[Duke of Bohemia]] and promised protection against Polish aggression in return for incorporation. Jaromir ruled only a smaller territory, however, as Poland occupied the traditional Czech territories of [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Lusatia]]. In 1012, Jaromir was deposed by his brother [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Oldrich]], who assumed the Bohemian throne for himself. Following the resumption of hostilities between the Empire and Poland in 1028, Oldrich went on the offensive against Poland, reconquering Moravia by 1029, which helped to stabilize his duchy. The war ended in 1031 when Polish King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]] surrendered to Conrad. In the civil war which followed, Meiszko was forced to flee Poland for Bohemia, where Oldrich had him imprisoned and castrated in revenge for the torture Meiszko's father, [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]], inflicted upon [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years before.<ref name=\"Prague09\">{{cite book|author1=Cosmas (of Prague)|author2=Cosmas of Prague|author3=C\u00f4me de Prague|title=The Chronicle of the Czechs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7igBN41oUC&pg=PA105|year=2009|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1570-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nPoland was unable to stabilize in the wake of Mieszko's exile, forcing Conrad to convene an assembly in July 1033 to issue the [[Treaty of Merseburg]] which restored Meiszko to the Polish throne. Conrad summoned Oldrich to appear to the assembly, but Oldrich refused. His absence raised the ire of the Emperor and Conrad, busy with securing his succession to the Burgundy throne, charged his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke Henry of Bavaria]] with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. At age 17, Henry's march on Bohemia was his first independent military command. The expedition was complete success, with Henry deposing Oldrich and restoring his brother Jaromir to the Bohemian throne, with Oldrich's son [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] appointed as Count of [[Moravia]]. Oldrich was imprisoned in Bavaria but by 1034 was pardoned and allowed to return to Bohemia.\n\nOldrich deposed and blinded Jaromir, reclaimed the Bohemian throne, and exiled his son. While the reason for the conflict between father and son has been lost, it is believed Bretislaus supported Jaromir over his father. Oldrich died suddenly on November 9, 1034, allowing Bretislaus to return from exile. Though Jaromir was offered the throne, he declined in favor of his nephew. Bretislaus was then installed as the new Duke of Bohemia by Conrad.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n====Hungary====\n\n[[File:Statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Buda Castle 2010.JPG|thumb|left|170px|alt=Equestrian statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Budapest|[[Equestrian statue]] of [[Stephen I of Hungary|King St. Stephen]], [[Budapest]], 1905]]\nWith Otto III's approval, Stephen was crowned as the first Christian [[king of Hungary]] on [[Christmas Day]], 1000.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=28}} Otto III's successor, [[Emperor Henry II]], was Stephen's brother-in-law by Stephen's marriage to Henry's sister [[Gisela of Hungary|Gisela]], furthering the friendly relationship between the Empire and Hungary. Under Conrad, however, relations quickly turned hostile as Conrad pursued a more aggressive policy regarding eastern Europe.{{sfn|Lenkey|2003|p = 90}} Conrad II expelled Venetian Doge [[Otto Orseolo]], the husband of Stephen's sister [[Grimelda of Hungary]], from Venice in 1026.{{sfn|Lenkey|2003|p = 90}}{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p = 148}} Conrad also persuaded the Bavarians to proclaim his own son, [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], as their duke in 1027, although Stephen's son, [[Saint Emeric of Hungary|Emeric of Hungary]], had a strong claim to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] through his mother.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p = 187}}\n\nEmperor Conrad planned a marriage alliance with the Byzantine Empire and dispatched one of his advisors, Bishop [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Werner of Strasbourg]], to Constantinople.{{sfn|Butler|Cumming|Burns|1998|p=159}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp = 197-198}} The bishop seemingly traveled as a pilgrim, but Stephen, who had been informed of his actual purpose, refused to let him enter into his country in the autumn of 1027.{{sfn|Butler|Cumming|Burns|1998|p=159}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp = 197-198}} Conrad's biographer, [[Wipo of Burgundy]] recorded that the Bavarians incited skirmishes along the common Imperial-Hungarian border in 1029, causing a rapid deterioration in relations between the two countries.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p = 149}}{{sfn|Krist\u00f3|2003|p = 74}} In 1030, open conflict erupted. Conrad launched an invasion of Hungary, but had to retreat when the Hungarians successfully used [[scorched earth tactics]]. Conrad left matters in Hungary to his son Henry, so he could address his problems with his stepson [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]], the deposed [[Duke of Swabia]]. Henry settled the conflict by 1031 by granting lands between the [[Leitha River]] and [[Fischa River]] in eastern Bavaria to Hungary. Hungary and the Empire remained at peace from 1031 through to Henry's own reign as Emperor in 1040.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p = 149-150}}\n\n===Conquest of Burgundy===\nAs in 1016 King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]], ruler of the [[Kingdom of Arles]] was left without a male heir, [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] seized the opportunity and forced King Rudolph III to name him - Henry his royal successor.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=16}} Henry II, the son of Rudolph's sister [[Gisela of Burgundy]] was his nephew, and his closest living male relative. However, Rudolph was still alive when Henry II died in 1024. Soon emperor Conrad II, as Henry II's imperial successor claimed he is also entitled to Henry II's rights on the Burgundian succession, which Rudolph disputed. [[Odo II, Count of Blois|Count Odo II of Blois]], who had strong family ties with Rudolph, also emphasized his right in the succession. Conrad II met Rudolph III in August 1027 near [[Basel]] to settle the dispute. Henry II's widowed wife, Empress [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]], mediated between the two parties.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}} An agreement was reached that allowed Conrad II to succeed to the Burgundian throne upon Rudolph's death under the same conditions as Henry II.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}} In return, Rudolph was allowed to retain independent rule over his kingdom.\n\nRudolph died on September 6, 1032, while Conrad was on campaign against [[Mieszko II Lambert|Duke Mieszko II of Poland]]. Upon Mieszko's  surrender, Conrad marched his army to Burgundy during the winter of 1032/1033. Conrad's rival to the Burgundian throne, Count Odo II of Blois had already invaded the kingdom to secure his rule and controlled large sections of the kingdom's western territories.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=30}} On February 2, 1033, Conrad arrived at [[Vaud]], where he held an assembly at the [[Payerne Priory|Abbey of Payerne]] and was crowned King of Burgundy.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}} Initially, Conrad made little progress against Odo and had to withdraw to [[Zurich]] in March.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}}  In two large-scale military summer campaigns in 1033 and 1034, Conrad defeated Odo.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}} On August 1, 1034, Conrad officially incorporated Burgundy into the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at a ceremony held in the [[St. Pierre Cathedral|Cathedral of Geneva]].{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}}\n\nThough Burgundy had been brought under full imperial control, the kingdom was allowed a remarkable degree of autonomy. Conrad rarely intervened in its affairs following his coronation, returning only in 1038 to announce his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as the kingdom's future ruler. Of central significance in the conquest of Burgundy was to augment the influence and dignity of the Emperor to the benefit of the Empire. With Burgundy secured, Conrad controlled the western Alpine passes into Italy and block foreign invasions.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=40}}\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Conrad II et prince imp\u00e9rial, vitrail roman, Cath\u00e9drale de Strasbourg.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Conrad II, 12th-century stained glass depiction, [[Strasbourg Cathedral]]]]\n[[Image:Ottonian Salian dynasty.png|thumb|Salian family tree]]\n\nConrad formally confirmed the popular [[legal]] traditions of [[Saxony]] and issued new constitutions for [[Lombardy]]. In 1028 at [[Aachen]], he had his son Henry elected and anointed king of [[Germany]]. Henry married [[Gunhilda of Denmark]], daughter of King [[Canute the Great]] of [[England]], [[Denmark]], and [[Norway]] by [[Emma of Normandy]]. This was an arrangement that Conrad had made many years prior, when he gave Canute parts of northern Germany to administer.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Henry, who would later become Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], became his father's chief counselor.\n\nConrad campaigned unsuccessfully against [[Poland]] in 1028\u20131030. In 1031, Conrad and the [[Kievan Rus']] forced King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]], son and heir of [[Boleslaw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw I]], to make peace and return the land that Boles\u0142aw had taken from the Empire during the reign of Henry II. Mieszko II was compelled to give up his royal title, and for the remainder of his troubled rule became the Duke of Poland and Conrad's vassal.\n\nIn 1029 some [[Bavaria]]n border conflicts undermined the good relations with [[Stephen I of Hungary]]. One year later Conrad launched a campaign against [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]. The Hungarians successfully used [[Scorched earth|scorched earth tactics]], and Conrad had to withdraw his army. Finally, the Hungarian army forced him to surrender at [[Vienna]]. After his defeat, Conrad was obliged to cede some border territory to Hungary.\n\nWhen [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died on February 2, 1032, Conrad claimed the Kingship on the basis of an inheritance that Henry II had extorted from Rudolph in 1006, after Henry invaded [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]] to enforce his claim in 1016. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy, later known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors, corresponded to most of the southeastern quarter of modern France and included western Switzerland, the Franche-Comt\u00e9, and Dauphin\u00e9. It did not include the smaller [[Duchy of Burgundy]] to the north, ruled by a cadet branch of the Capetian [[King of France]]. (Most of the former Kingdom of Arles was incorporated into France piecemeal over the next centuries, but the King of Arles remained one of the Holy Roman Emperor's subsidiary titles until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806.)\n\nConrad upheld the rights of the ''valvassores'' (knights and burghers of the cities) of [[Italy]] against Archbishop Aribert of Milan and the local nobles. The nobles, as vassal lords, and the [[bishop]] had conspired to rescind rights from the burghers. Conrad restored order with skillful diplomacy and luck.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Late life==\n\n===Securing the imperial succession===\nOn 14 January 1040 Conrad II's heir Henry issued a charter, in which he announced his official designation as of ''Rex romanorum'' - King of the Romans. Thus he effectively elevates the traditional Frankish kingship to Imperial authority. By this assignment only, one reserves the rights for the office of Holy Roman Emperor.<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\"/>\n\n===Second Italian expedition===\n[[Image:Grab Konrad II. im Dom zu Speyer.JPG|thumb|Emperor Conrad II's tomb in the crypt of [[Speyer Cathedral]], Germany]]\nIn 1038, Prince [[Guaimar IV of Salerno]] requested that Conrad adjudicate in a dispute over [[Capua]] with its Prince [[Pandulf IV of Capua|Pandulf]], whom Conrad had released from imprisonment in 1024, immediately after his coronation. Hearing that [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] had received the same request, Conrad went to [[Southern Italy]], to [[Salerno]] and [[Aversa]]. He appointed Richer, from Germany, as abbot of [[Monte Cassino]], as abbot Theobald was imprisoned by Pandulf. At [[Troia (FG)|Troia]], he ordered Pandulf to restore stolen property to Monte Cassino. Pandulf sent his wife and son to ask for peace, offering {{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of gold and two of his children as hostages. The Emperor accepted Pandulf's offer, but the hostages escaped as Pandulf hid in his outlying castle of [[Sant'Agata de' Goti]]. Conrad besieged and conquered Capua and bestowed the place and the title of ''Prince'' on Guaimar. He also recognized Aversa as a county of Salerno under [[Rainulf Drengot]], the [[Normans|Norman]] adventurer. Pandulf, meanwhile, fled to [[Constantinople]]. Conrad thus left the ''[[Mezzogiorno]]'' firmly in Guaimar's hands and loyal, for once, to the Holy Roman Empire.<ref name=boni/>\n\n===Death===\nDuring the return to Germany a severe epidemic decimated the ranks of the troops. Conrad's daughter-in-law and stepson died. Conrad himself returned home safely and held court on important occasions in [[Solothurn]], [[Strasbourg]], and [[Goslar]]. His son Henry was invested with the duchies of Swabia and Carinthia.{{sfn|North|2001|p=143}}\n\nA year later in 1039 Conrad fell ill and died of [[gout]] in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p = 345}} His heart and bowels are buried at the [[Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p = 345-346}} His body was transferred to Speyer via [[Cologne]], [[Mainz]], and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], where the funeral procession made stops. His body is buried at Speyer Cathedral, which was still under construction at this time. During a major excavation in 1900 his sarcophagus was relocated from his original resting place in front of the altar to the crypt, where it is still visible today along with those of seven of his successors.\n\nA biography of Conrad II in chronicle form, ''Gesta Chuonradi II imperatoris'', was written by his chaplain [[Wipo of Burgundy]], and presented to Henry III in 1046, not long after he was crowned.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Family and children==\n{{see also|Kings of Germany family tree}}\nConrad married Gisela of Swabia in 1016, the daughter of Duke Herman II of Swabia.
