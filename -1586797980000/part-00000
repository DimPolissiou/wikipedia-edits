These genes are located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 2 at position 24.3 and code for the alpha subunit of the transmembrane sodium channel protein. A mutation in either of these two genes will cause an individual to develop dysfunctional sodium channels, which are crucial in the pathway for sending chemical signals in the brain, causing the phenotypic display of myoclonic epilepsy from the individual. A properly functioning channel would respond to a voltage difference across the membrane and form a pore through which only sodium ions can pass. The influx of sodium induces the generation of action potential by temporarily changing the charge of the cell. When the gene is mutated, the eventually translated protein improperly folds its pore segment within the cell membrane because it has different amino acid chemistry, which renders the channel inactive. It is also possible for a mutation to reduce the number of channels produced by an individual, which leads to the development of Dravet syndrome.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1535-7597.2005.05105.x |pmid=16059449 |pmc=1176321 |title=A Plethora of SCN1A Mutations: What Can They Tell Us? |journal=Epilepsy Currents |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=17\u201320 |year=2005 |last1=Wallace |first1=Robyn }}</ref>\n\nCurrently, the SCN1A gene is the most clinically relevant; the largest number of epilepsy related mutations characterized thus far occur in this gene.<ref name=\"GeneReview1\"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sugawara T, Tsurubuchi Y, Agarwala KL, Ito M, Fukuma G, Mazaki-Miyazaki E, Nagafuji H, Noda M, Imoto K, Wada K, Mitsudome A, Kaneko S, Montal M, Nagata K, Hirose S, Yamakawa K | year = 2001 | title = A missense mutation of the Na+ channel alpha II subunit gene Na(v)1.2 in a patient with febrile and afebrile seizures causes channel dysfunction | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 98 | issue = 11| pages = 6384\u20139 | doi=10.1073/pnas.111065098 | pmid=11371648 | pmc=33477}}</ref> Typically, a [[missense mutation]] in either the S5 or S6 segment of the sodium channel pore results in a loss of channel function and the development of Dravet syndrome.

These genes are located on the long (q) arm of chromosome 2 at position 24.3 and code for the alpha subunit of the transmembrane sodium channel protein. A mutation in either of these two genes will cause an individual to develop dysfunctional sodium channels, which are crucial in the pathway for sending chemical signals in the brain, causing the phenotypic display of myoclonic epilepsy from the individual. A properly functioning channel would respond to a voltage difference across the membrane and form a pore through which only sodium ions can pass. The influx of sodium induces the generation of action potential by temporarily changing the charge of the cell. When the gene is mutated, the eventually translated protein improperly folds its pore segment within the cell membrane because it has different amino acid chemistry, which renders the channel inactive. It is also possible for a mutation to reduce the number of channels produced by an individual, which leads to the development of Dravet syndrome.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1535-7597.2005.05105.x |pmid=16059449 |pmc=1176321 |title=A Plethora of SCN1A Mutations: What Can They Tell Us? |journal=Epilepsy Currents |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=17\u201320 |year=2005 |last1=Wallace |first1=Robyn }}</ref>\n\nCurrently, the SCN1A gene is the most clinically relevant; the largest number of epilepsy related mutations characterized thus far occur in this gene.<ref name=\"GeneReview1\"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sugawara T, Tsurubuchi Y, Agarwala KL, Ito M, Fukuma G, Mazaki-Miyazaki E, Nagafuji H, Noda M, Imoto K, Wada K, Mitsudome A, Kaneko S, Montal M, Nagata K, Hirose S, Yamakawa K | year = 2001 | title = A missense mutation of the Na+ channel alpha II subunit gene Na(v)1.2 in a patient with febrile and afebrile seizures causes channel dysfunction | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 98 | issue = 11| pages = 6384\u20139 | doi=10.1073/pnas.111065098 | pmid=11371648 | pmc=33477}}</ref> Typically, a [[missense mutation]] in either the S5 or S6 segment of the sodium channel pore results in a loss of channel function and the development of Dravet syndrome.

Early roles were rather strait-laced; he then sometimes played his ''snide'' character: quite slimy and smarmy with a distinctive nasal voice. Later the haughty, proud and easily outraged elitist became more frequent and Williams' best known character type. Williams sometimes played characters of other nationalities, such as in ''Up the Khyber''. In some roles, when not actually playing his role in ''snide'' mode, Williams might deliver a single joke using his snide voice.  A running gag in many of the films was that Williams' character would be embroiled in an extra-marital affair with that of Hattie Jacques\u2014this plot device was used to greatest effect in the hospital-based films, which gave rise to Williams' famous catchphrase \"ohhh Matron!\".\n* [[Joan Sims]] (1930\u20132001) (24) had the longest uninterrupted run of roles in ''Carry On'' films, being in all 20 films (excluding ''That's Carry On'') from ''Carry On Cleo'' to ''Carry On Emmannuelle''. She  played a range of characters from jolly and assertive young women with sturdy moral standards (''Camping'', ''Loving'') to sexy and lusty matrons \u2013 either desired (''At Your Convenience'') or coarse and unattractive (''Henry'', ''Up the Khyber''), to a chatty glutton (in ''Matron''), a battleaxe wife (''Cleo'', ''Screaming'') and an unattractive spinster (''Doctor''). She also appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and eleven episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' television series.\n* [[Charles Hawtrey (actor, born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]] (1914\u20131988) (23) often played a meek, rather effete 'mummy's boy' who could suddenly erupt into riotous behaviour.  Other roles were as a strict, officious and prissy person in an authority role.  Hawtrey's characters were often bumbling and accident prone, and the victim of various mishaps and complex misunderstandings. He also appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials.\n* [[Sid James]] (1913\u20131976) (19) always played a lead character, usually a laconic member of the working class. His characters were often lecherous womanisers, something that caused problems in James' private life. He also appeared in three of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' television specials, and four episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' television series.\n* [[Kenneth Connor]] (1918\u20131993) (17) often played put-upon men ranging in character from pompous to meek, and often leering.  He also provided some additional voice-work in ''Emmannuelle'' when he dubbed the dialogue of Howard Nelson (Harry Hernia). He also appeared in three of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' television specials, and twelve episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Peter Butterworth]] (1919\u20131979) (16) frequently played major roles in the films, often as a generally benign, unflappable but bumbling assistant or servant unable to see the chaos around him. Unusually for a regular, in some films, including ''Again Doctor'', ''Henry'' and ''Loving'', his role consists of a cameo appearance in a single scene. He also appeared in three of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and nine episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Hattie Jacques]] (1922\u20131980) (14) played the haughty matron, school senior mistress or other archetypal authority figure in several films. Later she branched out into more varied comic roles (e.g. ''At Your Convenience'', ''Loving'' and ''Abroad'', in which she played a chef embroiled in a constant battle with the stove). She also appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and one episode of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Bernard Bresslaw]] (1934\u20131993) (14) varied between playing the clumsy dimwit or the heavy, or the lusty and bombastic \"foreigner\". In the later films his characterisation developed greater depth, such as in ''Dick'', ''Behind''. He also appeared in three of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and five episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Jim Dale]] (1935-) (11) joined the series with support roles, but quickly progressed to playing the younger, sympathetic male lead, often in the film's romance plot strand. From his debut had an uninterrupted nine-film run. After a two-film absence (''Camping'' and ''Up The Khyber'') returned for ''Again Doctor'', his final ''Carry On'' until taking the lead role in the 1992 revival film ''Carry On Columbus''.\n* [[Barbara Windsor]] (b.1937) (10, including co-presenting ''That's Carry On'' with Williams) played main roles in all her ''Carry On'' appearances. Her characters were always the cheeky and saucy young blonde, often in revealing costumes. Sometimes her characters were chaste (and very often chased), some were easily swayed. She also appeared in all four of the ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and eight episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Patsy Rowlands]] (1931\u20132005) (9) started in support roles, often as undervalued, meek and mousey secretary or assistant who undergoes transformation into a more assertive and sexually aware woman. She also appeared in one episode of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Jack Douglas (actor)|Jack Douglas]] (1927\u20132008) (8) joined the series with a cameo appearance in ''Matron'', where he appears in one scene with a single line of dialogue. After an only slightly larger role in the following film ''Abroad'', where he again plays his established ''Alf Ippititimus''-type character, his roles increased in size and increasingly diverged from the familiar Alf performance. After his d\u00e9but Douglas appeared in all subsequent films in the original series, and was one of the few returners for ''Columbus''. He also appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and twelve episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Terry Scott]] (1927\u20131994) (7) appeared briefly in the first film ''Sergeant'' and returned 10 years later when he played, among others, the put-upon husband (''Camping''), the barking sergeant (''Up the Khyber'') and lusty doctor (''Matron'').  Additionally, he appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials. He also filmed a scene for ''At Your Convenience'' as union big-wig Mr Allcock, which was not used in the finished film.<ref>Robert Ross, ITV-DVD edition (Trivia Notes)</ref>\n* [[Leslie Phillips]] (b.1924) (4) appeared in three early films \u2013 ''Nurse'', ''Teacher'' and ''Constable'' \u2013 after which he left the series only to return 32 years later for ''Columbus'' as the King of Spain.\n\n=== Regular cast roles ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:89%;\"\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Title!! rowspan=\"2\" |Year!! colspan=\"14\" |Actor\n|-\n\n![[Kenneth Williams]]!![[Joan Sims]]!![[Charles Hawtrey (actor born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]]!![[Sid James]]!![[Kenneth Connor]]!![[Peter Butterworth]]!![[Hattie Jacques]]!![[Bernard Bresslaw]]!![[Jim Dale]]!![[Barbara Windsor]]!![[Patsy Rowlands]]!![[Jack Douglas (actor)|Jack Douglas]]!![[Terry Scott]]!![[Leslie Phillips]]\n|-\n!''[[Carry On Sergeant|Sergeant]]''||1958\n|James Bailey||-||Peter Golightly||-||Horace Strong||-||Capt.

He had a larger role as Melly's Driver in ''England''.  He also appeared in one episode of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Ronnie Brody]] (2) made his first unaccredited appearance in ''Don't Lose Your Head'', followed up by the small role of Henry in ''Loving''.  Brody also appeared in 2 episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Ray Brooks (actor)|Ray Brooks]] (1) had a sizeable supporting role in ''Abroad''.\n* [[Jeremy Bulloch]] (1) made an unaccredited appearance as a schoolboy in ''Teacher''.\n* [[Gerald Campion]] (1) had a sizeable supporting role in ''Sergeant''.\n* [[Brian Capron]] (0), the future ''Coronation Street'' baddie does not appear in any ''Carry On'' films.  He does, however, feature in two episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Patrick Cargill]] (2) appeared in ''Regardless'' and ''Jack''.  ''Carry On Nurse'' is based in part on the stage play ''Ring For Catty'' which he co-wrote with [[Jack Beale (writer)|Jack Beale]].  Three years later [[Peter Rogers]] used the same play as the basis for his film ''Twice Round The Daffodils''.\n* [[John Carlin (actor)|John Carlin]] (2) made just two small appearances in the film series (in ''England'' and ''Emmannuelle'').  However, before these roles he had been seen as a semi-regular performer (frequently 'camping it up') in the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series, notching up six episodes.\n* [[Norman Chappell]] (2) made his ''Carry On'' debut in ''Cabby'' in a role originally offered to [[Kenneth Williams]].  When Williams refused it, the part of the Shop Steward was decreased and offered to Chappell.  His other appearance was in ''Henry''.  He was also to appear in ''Loving'', but his part was edited out of the film before release.  He was more of a regular performer in the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series where he made 7 appearances.\n* [[Peggy Ann Clifford]] (1) was [[Tony Hancock]]'s regular, female, television sparring partner, and makes an unaccredited guest appearance in ''Cleo''.\n* [[David Davenport]] (3) was a former ballet dancer whose major ''Carry On'' contribution was in the significant supporting role of Bilius the bodyguard in ''Cleo''.  He also appeared in ''Don't Lose Your Head'' and ''Henry''.\n* [[Francis de Wolff]] (1) put in a supporting role in ''Cleo''.\n* [[Noel Dyson]] (2) was everyone's favourite nanny in ''[[Father, Dear Father]]'', and a founder cast member in ''[[Coronation Street]]''.  She appeared in ''Constable'' and ''Cabby''.\n* [[E. V. H. Emmett]] (1) brought his newsreading authority to the narrator of ''Cleo''.  Although several other films in the series used a narrator, none used them as effectively as ''Cleo'' where the conceit runs throughout the film.  Emmett was the only person to get credited for narrating a ''Carry On'' film.  He had previously been a [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont British News]] newsreader and commentator, and also provided narration for the first series of ''[[Dad's Army]]''.\n* [[Hilda Fenemore]] (2) had a main part in ''Nurse'' as a snob's loud-mouthed wife, and had a cameo appearance in ''Constable'' as a woman who wanted to use the public convenience.

For the latter role her voice was redubbed by [[John Bluthal]] in order to give the character a more asexual sound.\n* [[Fred Griffiths (actor)|Fred Griffiths]] (3) appears as an ambulance man in ''Nurse'', and as a taxi driver in ''Regardless'' and ''Loving''.\n* [[Sheila Hancock]] (1) lends her comic support to ''Cleo'' as Hengist Pod's wife Senna.\n* [[Irene Handl]] (2) appeared in ''Nurse'' and ''Constable''.\n* [[Sherrie Hewson]] (1) appeared in the large supporting role of Carol in ''Behind''.  However, she also made 4 appearances in the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Linda Hooks]] (3) the former Miss Great Britain had small glamorous roles in 3 later films, plus two appearances in episodes on the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Laraine Humphrys]] (2) brought glamour to ''Girls'' and ''Dick''.  Laraine also appeared in the 1975 ''Carry On Christmas'' TV special.\n* [[Wilfrid Hyde-White]] (1) has a significant guest role in ''Nurse''.\n* [[Vivienne Johnson]] (1) is only credited with appearing in ''England''.  However, the previous year had seen her make three significant appearances in the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Elizabeth Knight]] (2) makes eye-catching appearances in ''Camping'' (as Jane), and ''Again Doctor'' (as Nurse Willing).\n* [[Ian Lavender]] (1) has a large supporting role in ''Behind''.\n* [[George Layton]] (1) was probably best known at the time for playing Dr Paul Collier in the ''[[Doctor in the House (TV)|Doctor...]]'' TV series. In ''Behind'' he makes a 'gag' appearance as a Doctor.  He also co-wrote an unused script for a potential ''Carry On'' film in the 1980s. \n* [[Tutte Lemkow]] (1) brought his distinctive face to British film and television productions for 40 years.  Sadly, his only ''Carry On'' contribution was as an unaccredited walk-on in ''Spying''.\n* [[John Levene]] (0) made an unaccredited 'gag' appearance in one of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV episodes.  Best known for playing UNIT soldier Corporal Benton in ''[[Doctor Who]]'', he appears briefly as a mediaeval soldier in the episode ''The Baron Outlook''.  He did not appear in any of the films.\n* [[Harry Locke]] (3) was a well-used supporting artist within the British film industry.  His 3 ''Carry On'' appearances are all in medical comedies: ''Nurse'', ''Doctor'', and ''Again Doctor''.\n* [[Reuben Martin (actor)|Reuben Martin]] (2) played gorillas in both ''Up The Jungle'' and ''Emmannuelle'' (the latter unaccredited).  He also donned his gorilla suit for an episode of the TV ''Carry On Laughing'' series.\n* [[Derek Martinus]] (1) appeared in just one of the series, ''Sergeant''.  He went on to become a TV director of note, directing (amongst other things) 9 episodes of [[William Hartnell]] era ''[[Doctor Who]]'', 17 further episodes of ''Doctor Who'', and 2 episodes of ''[[Blake's 7]]''.\n* [[Larry Martyn]] (2) had small roles in ''Convenience'' and ''Behind''.\n* [[Rik Mayall]] (1) ''Columbus''.\n* [[William Mervyn]] (3) has cameo roles in ''Follow That Camel'', ''Again Doctor'', and ''Henry''.\n* [[Olive Milbourne]] (1) later found fame as Terry's mum in ''[[The Likely Lads]]'' (on both TV and radio), and its sequel ''[[Whatever Happened To The Likely Lads]]'', but an early unaccredited appearance was as a sexy GlamCab driver in ''Cabby''.\n* [[Larry Miller (entertainer)|Larry Miller]] (1) ''Columbus''.\n* [[Warren Mitchell]] (1) made an entertaining, single appearance in ''Cleo''.  He went on to create the role of [[Alf Garnett]] for writer [[Johnny Speight]].\n* [[Trisha Noble]] (1) had a large supporting role in ''Camping'', but her role was decreased during editing.\n* [[Cecil Parker]] (1) makes a guest appearance topping-and-tailing ''Jack''.\n* [[Daniel Peacock]] (1) ''Columbus''.\n* [[Ambrosine Phillpotts]] (2) brings an aristocratic air to ''Regardless'' and ''Cabby''.\n* [[Eric Pohlmann]] (2) brings something sinister to ''Regardless'', and shines in the supporting role of a foreign spy in ''Spying''.\n* [[Brian Rawlinson]] (3) appeared in ''Cruising'', ''Cleo'' and ''Cowboy''.\n* [[Linda Regan]] (1) appears as one of the ATS girls in ''England''.  Six years earlier she had also appeared uncredited in the 1970 ''Carry On Again Christmas'' TV special.\n* [[Beryl Reid]] (1) made a guest appearance in ''Emmannuelle''.\n* [[Wendy Richard]] (2) made her ''Carry On'' film debut in ''Matron'', following it up with a larger supporting role in ''Girls''.  However, two years earlier she had also appeared in the 1970 ''Carry On Christmas'' TV special.\n* [[Anton Rodgers]] (2) appeared in ''Cruising'' and ''Jack''.\n* [[Carole Shelley]] (2) brought 'ditzy' glamour to ''Regardless'' and ''Cabby''.  \n* [[Vicki Smith]] (3) added unaccredited sex-appeal to ''Spying'', ''Cleo'', and ''Cowboy''.\n* [[Yutte Stensgaard]] (1) made an unaccredited appearance in ''Again Doctor'' as a nurse.  She also filmed a scene for ''Loving'' alongside [[Dad's Army]] star [[James Beck]], but their scene was removed from the film before release.\n* [[Jimmy Thompson (actor)|Jimmy Thompson]] (3) appeared in ''Regardless'' and ''Jack'', with a large supporting role in ''Cruising'' in the middle.\n* [[Bob Todd]] (1) makes an unaccredited 'gag' appearance in ''Again Doctor''.  He also appeared in the 1970 ''Carry On Again Christmas'' TV special.\n* [[Nikki van der Zyl]] (2) was one of British cinema's most prolific voice-over artistes, dubbing many of the original Bond girls (including [[Shirley Eaton]] in ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'').  She appears unaccredited in two of the films, none of them dubbing work.  In ''Cleo'' she doubles for [[Amanda Barrie]] when Cleo is rolled out of her carpet, whilst in ''Don't Lose Your Head'' she provides stunt work and appears as the messenger who brings a letter to [[Charles Hawtrey (actor born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]] at the start of the film when he is about to be executed.\n* [[Wanda Ventham]] (2) has an unaccredited cameo in ''Cleo'', and a slightly larger role as the Khasi's first wife in ''Up The Khyber''.\n* [[Kenneth Waller]] (1) stepped into the role of the Barman in ''Behind'' at the last minute replacing the now unavailable [[Chris Gannon (actor)|Chris Gannon]].\n* [[Geoffrey Hughes]] (1) played Willie in ''Carry on at your convenience''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.carryonline.com/carryonline/reframe.html?http://www.carryonline.com/carryonline/castandcrew.html List of cast members from the official website]\n\n{{Carry On Films}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of actors by film series|Carry On]]\n[[Category:Carry On (franchise)|Cast]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Original research|date=October 2018}}\n{{Fansite|date=October 2018}}\n{{Refimprove|date=October 2018}}}}\n\nThis is a list of actors who have appeared in [[Carry On (franchise)|''Carry On'' films]].\n\n== Regular cast ==\nThe following actors are considered to be the core members of the ''Carry On'' team:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewhippitinn.com/carry_on_people/|title=The Whippit Inn :  Carry On People|website=Thewhippitinn.com|accessdate=24 October 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Kenneth Williams]] (1926\u20131988) (25 films, and co-presenting ''[[That's Carry On!]]'') played a range of character types, nearly always a lead character. Early roles were rather strait-laced; he then sometimes played his ''snide'' character: quite slimy and smarmy with a distinctive nasal voice. Later the haughty, proud and easily outraged elitist became more frequent and Williams' best known character type. Williams sometimes played characters of other nationalities, such as in ''Up the Khyber''. In some roles, when not actually playing his role in ''snide'' mode, Williams might deliver a single joke using his snide voice.  A running gag in many of the films was that Williams' character would be embroiled in an extra-marital affair with that of Hattie Jacques\u2014this plot device was used to greatest effect in the hospital-based films, which gave rise to Williams' famous catchphrase \"ohhh Matron!\".\n* [[Joan Sims]] (1930\u20132001) (24) had the longest uninterrupted run of roles in ''Carry On'' films, being in all 20 films (excluding ''That's Carry On'') from ''Carry On Cleo'' to ''Carry On Emmannuelle''. She  played a range of characters from jolly and assertive young women with sturdy moral standards (''Camping'', ''Loving'') to sexy and lusty matrons \u2013 either desired (''At Your Convenience'') or coarse and unattractive (''Henry'', ''Up the Khyber''), to a chatty glutton (in ''Matron''), a battleaxe wife (''Cleo'', ''Screaming'') and an unattractive spinster (''Doctor''). She also appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and eleven episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' television series.\n* [[Charles Hawtrey (actor, born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]] (1914\u20131988) (23) often played a meek, rather effete 'mummy's boy' who could suddenly erupt into riotous behaviour.  Other roles were as a strict, officious and prissy person in an authority role.  Hawtrey's characters were often bumbling and accident prone, and the victim of various mishaps and complex misunderstandings. He also appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials.\n* [[Sid James]] (1913\u20131976) (19) always played a lead character, usually a laconic member of the working class. His characters were often lecherous womanisers, something that caused problems in James' private life. He also appeared in three of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' television specials, and four episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' television series.\n* [[Kenneth Connor]] (1918\u20131993) (17) often played put-upon men ranging in character from pompous to meek, and often leering.  He also provided some additional voice-work in ''Emmannuelle'' when he dubbed the dialogue of Howard Nelson (Harry Hernia). He also appeared in three of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' television specials, and twelve episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Peter Butterworth]] (1919\u20131979) (16) frequently played major roles in the films, often as a generally benign, unflappable but bumbling assistant or servant unable to see the chaos around him.

He also appeared in three of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and nine episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Hattie Jacques]] (1922\u20131980) (14) played the haughty matron, school senior mistress or other archetypal authority figure in several films.

Her characters were always the cheeky and saucy young blonde, often in revealing costumes. Sometimes her characters were chaste (and very often chased), some were easily swayed. She also appeared in all four of the ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and eight episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Patsy Rowlands]] (1931\u20132005) (9) started in support roles, often as undervalued, meek and mousey secretary or assistant who undergoes transformation into a more assertive and sexually aware woman. She also appeared in one episode of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Jack Douglas (actor)|Jack Douglas]] (1927\u20132008) (8) joined the series with a cameo appearance in ''Matron'', where he appears in one scene with a single line of dialogue. After an only slightly larger role in the following film ''Abroad'', where he again plays his established ''Alf Ippititimus''-type character, his roles increased in size and increasingly diverged from the familiar Alf performance. After his d\u00e9but Douglas appeared in all subsequent films in the original series, and was one of the few returners for ''Columbus''. He also appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and twelve episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Terry Scott]] (1927\u20131994) (7) appeared briefly in the first film ''Sergeant'' and returned 10 years later when he played, among others, the put-upon husband (''Camping''), the barking sergeant (''Up the Khyber'') and lusty doctor (''Matron'').  Additionally, he appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials. He also filmed a scene for ''At Your Convenience'' as union big-wig Mr Allcock, which was not used in the finished film.<ref>Robert Ross, ITV-DVD edition (Trivia Notes)</ref>\n* [[Leslie Phillips]] (b.1924) (4) appeared in three early films \u2013 ''Nurse'', ''Teacher'' and ''Constable'' \u2013 after which he left the series only to return 32 years later for ''Columbus'' as the King of Spain.\n\n=== Regular cast roles ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:89%;\"\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Title!! rowspan=\"2\" |Year!! colspan=\"14\" |Actor\n|-\n\n![[Kenneth Williams]]!![[Joan Sims]]!![[Charles Hawtrey (actor born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]]!![[Sid James]]!![[Kenneth Connor]]!![[Peter Butterworth]]!![[Hattie Jacques]]!![[Bernard Bresslaw]]!![[Jim Dale]]!![[Barbara Windsor]]!![[Patsy Rowlands]]!![[Jack Douglas (actor)|Jack Douglas]]!![[Terry Scott]]!![[Leslie Phillips]]\n|-\n!''[[Carry On Sergeant|Sergeant]]''||1958\n|James Bailey||-||Peter Golightly||-||Horace Strong||-||Capt.

He had a larger role as Melly's Driver in ''England''.  He also appeared in one episode of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Ronnie Brody]] (2) made his first unaccredited appearance in ''Don't Lose Your Head'', followed up by the small role of Henry in ''Loving''.  Brody also appeared in 2 episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Ray Brooks (actor)|Ray Brooks]] (1) had a sizeable supporting role in ''Abroad''.\n* [[Jeremy Bulloch]] (1) made an unaccredited appearance as a schoolboy in ''Teacher''.\n* [[Gerald Campion]] (1) had a sizeable supporting role in ''Sergeant''.\n* [[Brian Capron]] (0), the future ''Coronation Street'' baddie does not appear in any ''Carry On'' films.  He does, however, feature in two episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Patrick Cargill]] (2) appeared in ''Regardless'' and ''Jack''.  ''Carry On Nurse'' is based in part on the stage play ''Ring For Catty'' which he co-wrote with [[Jack Beale (writer)|Jack Beale]].  Three years later [[Peter Rogers]] used the same play as the basis for his film ''Twice Round The Daffodils''.\n* [[John Carlin (actor)|John Carlin]] (2) made just two small appearances in the film series (in ''England'' and ''Emmannuelle'').  However, before these roles he had been seen as a semi-regular performer (frequently 'camping it up') in the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series, notching up six episodes.\n* [[Norman Chappell]] (2) made his ''Carry On'' debut in ''Cabby'' in a role originally offered to [[Kenneth Williams]].

She appeared in ''Constable'' and ''Cabby''.\n* [[E. V. H. Emmett]] (1) brought his newsreading authority to the narrator of ''Cleo''.  Although several other films in the series used a narrator, none used them as effectively as ''Cleo'' where the conceit runs throughout the film.  Emmett was the only person to get credited for narrating a ''Carry On'' film.  He had previously been a [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont British News]] newsreader and commentator, and also provided narration for the first series of ''[[Dad's Army]]''.\n* [[Hilda Fenemore]] (2) had a main part in ''Nurse'' as a snob's loud-mouthed wife, and had a cameo appearance in ''Constable'' as a woman who wanted to use the public convenience.

For the latter role her voice was redubbed by [[John Bluthal]] in order to give the character a more asexual sound.\n* [[Fred Griffiths (actor)|Fred Griffiths]] (3) appears as an ambulance man in ''Nurse'', and as a taxi driver in ''Regardless'' and ''Loving''.\n* [[Sheila Hancock]] (1) lends her comic support to ''Cleo'' as Hengist Pod's wife Senna.\n* [[Irene Handl]] (2) appeared in ''Nurse'' and ''Constable''.\n* [[Sherrie Hewson]] (1) appeared in the large supporting role of Carol in ''Behind''.

Laraine also appeared in the 1975 ''Carry On Christmas'' TV special.\n* [[Wilfrid Hyde-White]] (1) has a significant guest role in ''Nurse''.\n* [[Vivienne Johnson]] (1) is only credited with appearing in ''England''.  However, the previous year had seen her make three significant appearances in the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Elizabeth Knight]] (2) makes eye-catching appearances in ''Camping'' (as Jane), and ''Again Doctor'' (as Nurse Willing).\n* [[Ian Lavender]] (1) has a large supporting role in ''Behind''.\n* [[George Layton]] (1) was probably best known at the time for playing Dr Paul Collier in the ''[[Doctor in the House (TV)|Doctor...]]'' TV series. In ''Behind'' he makes a 'gag' appearance as a Doctor.  He also co-wrote an unused script for a potential ''Carry On'' film in the 1980s. \n* [[Tutte Lemkow]] (1) brought his distinctive face to British film and television productions for 40 years.  Sadly, his only ''Carry On'' contribution was as an unaccredited walk-on in ''Spying''.\n* [[John Levene]] (0) made an unaccredited 'gag' appearance in one of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV episodes.  Best known for playing UNIT soldier Corporal Benton in ''[[Doctor Who]]'', he appears briefly as a mediaeval soldier in the episode ''The Baron Outlook''.  He did not appear in any of the films.\n* [[Harry Locke]] (3) was a well-used supporting artist within the British film industry.  His 3 ''Carry On'' appearances are all in medical comedies: ''Nurse'', ''Doctor'', and ''Again Doctor''.\n* [[Reuben Martin (actor)|Reuben Martin]] (2) played gorillas in both ''Up The Jungle'' and ''Emmannuelle'' (the latter unaccredited).  He also donned his gorilla suit for an episode of the TV ''Carry On Laughing'' series.\n* [[Derek Martinus]] (1) appeared in just one of the series, ''Sergeant''.  He went on to become a TV director of note, directing (amongst other things) 9 episodes of [[William Hartnell]] era ''[[Doctor Who]]'', 17 further episodes of ''Doctor Who'', and 2 episodes of ''[[Blake's 7]]''.\n* [[Larry Martyn]] (2) had small roles in ''Convenience'' and ''Behind''.\n* [[Rik Mayall]] (1) ''Columbus''.\n* [[William Mervyn]] (3) has cameo roles in ''Follow That Camel'', ''Again Doctor'', and ''Henry''.\n* [[Olive Milbourne]] (1) later found fame as Terry's mum in ''[[The Likely Lads]]'' (on both TV and radio), and its sequel ''[[Whatever Happened To The Likely Lads]]'', but an early unaccredited appearance was as a sexy GlamCab driver in ''Cabby''.\n* [[Larry Miller (entertainer)|Larry Miller]] (1) ''Columbus''.\n* [[Warren Mitchell]] (1) made an entertaining, single appearance in ''Cleo''.  He went on to create the role of [[Alf Garnett]] for writer [[Johnny Speight]].\n* [[Trisha Noble]] (1) had a large supporting role in ''Camping'', but her role was decreased during editing.\n* [[Cecil Parker]] (1) makes a guest appearance topping-and-tailing ''Jack''.\n* [[Daniel Peacock]] (1) ''Columbus''.\n* [[Ambrosine Phillpotts]] (2) brings an aristocratic air to ''Regardless'' and ''Cabby''.\n* [[Eric Pohlmann]] (2) brings something sinister to ''Regardless'', and shines in the supporting role of a foreign spy in ''Spying''.\n* [[Brian Rawlinson]] (3) appeared in ''Cruising'', ''Cleo'' and ''Cowboy''.\n* [[Linda Regan]] (1) appears as one of the ATS girls in ''England''.  Six years earlier she had also appeared uncredited in the 1970 ''Carry On Again Christmas'' TV special.\n* [[Beryl Reid]] (1) made a guest appearance in ''Emmannuelle''.\n* [[Wendy Richard]] (2) made her ''Carry On'' film debut in ''Matron'', following it up with a larger supporting role in ''Girls''.

She also filmed a scene for ''Loving'' alongside [[Dad's Army]] star [[James Beck]], but their scene was removed from the film before release.\n* [[Jimmy Thompson (actor)|Jimmy Thompson]] (3) appeared in ''Regardless'' and ''Jack'', with a large supporting role in ''Cruising'' in the middle.\n* [[Bob Todd]] (1) makes an unaccredited 'gag' appearance in ''Again Doctor''.

She appears unaccredited in two of the films, none of them dubbing work.  In ''Cleo'' she doubles for [[Amanda Barrie]] when Cleo is rolled out of her carpet, whilst in ''Don't Lose Your Head'' she provides stunt work and appears as the messenger who brings a letter to [[Charles Hawtrey (actor born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]] at the start of the film when he is about to be executed.\n* [[Wanda Ventham]] (2) has an unaccredited cameo in ''Cleo'', and a slightly larger role as the Khasi's first wife in ''Up The Khyber''.\n* [[Kenneth Waller]] (1) stepped into the role of the Barman in ''Behind'' at the last minute replacing the now unavailable [[Chris Gannon (actor)|Chris Gannon]].\n* [[Geoffrey Hughes]] (1) played Willie in ''Carry on at your convenience''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.carryonline.com/carryonline/reframe.html?http://www.carryonline.com/carryonline/castandcrew.html List of cast members from the official website]\n\n{{Carry On Films}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of actors by film series|Carry On]]\n[[Category:Carry On (franchise)|Cast]]\n", "name_user": "Hammersfan", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRegular cast roles", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Carry_On_films_cast_members"}

{"title_page": "Thillai Kali Temple, Chidambaram", "text_new": "'''Thillai Kali Temple''' (Tamil: ) is a Hindu Temple located on the outskirts of the town of [[Chidambaram]], [[Cuddalore District]] [[Tamil Nadu]] in [[India]]. It was built by [[Chola]] King Kopperunjingan who ruled between 1229 and 1278.\n\n==Temple==\nThis Temple is on the outskirts of the city of Chidambaram. Legend says that Goddess Kaali Devi moved here after losing to Lord Siva in the celestial dance contest.\n\nIt was an argument that who is superior, either 'Sivam' (Lord Siva) or Shakthi (Parvathi). In order to resolve thus, they performed a dance program at Chidambaram in front of Lord Vishnu, Lord Brahma and other deities. While they were playing dance, Lord Siva was about to be defeated.<ref name=Meena>{{cite book|title=Temples in South India|last=V.|first=Meena|publisher=Harikumar Arts|location=Kanniyakumari|year=1974|edition=1st|page=41}}</ref>\n\nBut knowing fully well Siva played \"Oorthuva Taandava\" i.e. raising one leg above his head. This \"Oorthuva Taandava\" is one of the posture in the dance. It could not be played by the women folk due to their modesty and shyness. In this Parvathi could not play equally well to this posture and agreed her defeat.

In eastern Ukraine they go home, place the ''sviachene'' on the table, and the oldest member of the family opens the cloths in which the food is wrapped, slices pieces from each item, and distributes them to members of the family along with a piece of unleavened bread that has also been blessed. In Western Ukraine, especially in the Hutsul region, the people first walk around the house three times, go to the stable, extend Easter greetings to the cattle, touch them with the ''sviachene'', scatter pieces of Easter bread and salt in the manger, and send holiday greetings to the bees. Only then do they enter the house, ceremoniously open the bundle (''dorinnyk'') over the heads of the children, and sit down to the table to break their fast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CE%5CA%5CEaster.htm|title=Encyclopedia of Ukraine (Easter)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Modern pasky usually have a white glaze made from sugar and egg and are decorated on top with coloured wheat grains or poppy seeds.

On Easter morning, after the liturgy and the blessing of the paska and other staples, everyone returns home to feast on the eggs, cold meats, and other goods that were blessed at church. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CT%5CR%5CTraditionalfoods.htm|title=Encyclopedia of Ukraine|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> After the matins all the people in the congregation exchange Easter greetings, give each other ''krashanky'', and then hurry home with their baskets of blessed food (''sviachene''). In eastern Ukraine they go home, place the ''sviachene'' on the table, and the oldest member of the family opens the cloths in which the food is wrapped, slices pieces from each item, and distributes them to members of the family along with a piece of unleavened bread that has also been blessed. In Western Ukraine, especially in the Hutsul region, the people first walk around the house three times, go to the stable, extend Easter greetings to the cattle, touch them with the ''sviachene'', scatter pieces of Easter bread and salt in the manger, and send holiday greetings to the bees. Only then do they enter the house, ceremoniously open the bundle (''dorinnyk'') over the heads of the children, and sit down to the table to break their fast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CE%5CA%5CEaster.htm|title=Encyclopedia of Ukraine (Easter)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Modern pasky usually have a white glaze made from sugar and egg and are decorated on top with coloured wheat grains or poppy seeds. However, an old custom, which is still practised in some Ukrainian regions and diasporas, is to create dough ornaments for the paska.

Birds, especially larks, as heralds of spring, took a much-deserved place on pasky.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sovabooks.com.au/tradition-of-paska-ukrainian-easter-bread/|title=Tradition of Paska \u2013 Ukrainian Easter Bread|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n== Christian symbolism ==\n[[File:Lob NARkult 02.JPG|thumb|Paska bread kulich in [[Belgorod Oblast]]|alt=]]\nThe Christian faithful in many [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] countries eat this bread during Easter. Christian symbolism is associated with features of paska type breads. The inside of paska can be a swirl of yellow and white that is said to represent the [[resurrection of Jesus]] while the white represents the [[Holy Spirit]]. Other versions include chocolate, rice, or even savoury mixtures based on cheese.

University of Chicago Press. p. 316. {{ISBN|0-226-49236-2}}</ref> The few oceanic islands that are not volcanic are [[tectonic]] in origin and arise where plate movements have lifted up the ocean floor above the surface. Examples are [[Saint Peter and Paul Rocks]] in the Atlantic Ocean and [[Macquarie Island]] in the Pacific.\n\nOne type of volcanic oceanic island is found in a volcanic island arc. These islands arise from volcanoes where the [[subduction]] of one plate under another is occurring. Examples are the [[Aleutian Islands]], the [[Mariana Islands]], and most of [[Tonga]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The only examples in the Atlantic Ocean are some of the [[Lesser Antilles]] and the [[South Sandwich Islands]].\n\nAnother type of volcanic oceanic island occurs where an [[oceanic rift]] reaches the surface. There are two examples: [[Iceland]], which is the world's second largest volcanic island, and [[Jan Mayen]]. Both are in the Atlantic.\n\nA third type of volcanic oceanic island is formed over volcanic [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]]. A hotspot is more or less stationary relative to the moving [[tectonic plate]] above it, so a chain of islands results as the plate drifts. Over long periods of time, this type of island is eventually \"drowned\" by [[isostasy|isostatic adjustment]] and eroded, becoming a [[seamount]]. Plate movement across a hot-spot produces a line of islands oriented in the direction of the plate movement. An example is the [[Hawaiian Islands]], from [[Hawaii]] to [[Kure Atoll|Kure]], which continue beneath the sea surface in a more northerly direction as the [[Emperor Seamounts]]. Another chain with similar orientation is the [[Tuamotu Archipelago]]; its older, northerly trend is the [[Line Islands]]. The southernmost chain is the [[Austral Islands]], with its northerly trending part the atolls in the nation of [[Tuvalu]]. [[Tristan da Cunha]] is an example of a hotspot volcano in the Atlantic Ocean. Another hotspot in the Atlantic is the island of [[Surtsey]], which was formed in 1963.\n\nAn [[atoll]] is an island formed from a [[coral reef]] that has grown on an eroded and submerged volcanic island. The [[reef]] rises to the surface of the water and forms a new island. Atolls are typically ring-shaped with a central [[lagoon]]. Examples are the [[Line Islands]] in the Pacific and the [[Maldives]] in the [[Indian Ocean]].\n\n===Tropical islands===\n{{See also|Coral reef#Formation}}\n\n[[File:Landing Runway 18 (2121588367).jpg|thumb|right| Plane landing on an airport island, [[Velana International Airport]], [[Hulhul\u00e9 Island]], [[Maldives]]]]\n\nApproximately 45,000 [[Tropics|tropical]] islands with an [[area]] of at least {{convert|5|ha}} exist.<ref name=\"TI\">{{cite book\n|doi=10.1553/3-7001-2738-3\n|title=The Tropical Islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans\n|author=Austrian Academy of Sciences\n|author-link=Austrian Academy of Sciences}}</ref> Examples [[Coral reef#Formation|formed from coral reefs]] include [[Maldives]], [[Tonga]], [[Samoa]], [[Nauru]], and [[Polynesia]].<ref name=\"TI\"/> [[Granite]] islands include [[Seychelles]] and [[Tioman Island|Tioman]] and [[Volcano|volcanic]] islands such as [[Saint Helena]].\n\nThe socio-economic diversity of tropical islands ranges from the [[Stone Age]] societies in the interior of [[North Sentinel]], [[Madagascar]], [[Borneo]], and [[Papua New Guinea]] to the high-tech lifestyles of the city-islands of [[Singapore]] and [[Hong Kong]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Tropical Islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans|last = Arnberger|first = Hertha, Erik|publisher = Austrian Academy of Sciences Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-3-7001-2738-3|location = Vienna|pages = }}</ref>\n\nInternational [[tourism]] is a significant factor in the economy of many tropical islands including Seychelles, [[Sri Lanka]], [[Mauritius]],  [[R\u00e9union]], [[Hawaii]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Maldives]].\n\n==Artificial islands==\n{{Main article|Artificial island}}\n\nAlmost all of [[Earth]]'s islands are natural and have been formed by tectonic forces or volcanic eruptions.

Artificial islands can be built using natural materials (e.g., earth, rock, or sand) or artificial ones (e.g., [[concrete]] slabs or recycled [[waste]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-07/building-artificial-islands-rise-sea|title=Building Artificial Islands That Rise With the Sea|access-date=2016-06-28|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605152821/http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-07/building-artificial-islands-rise-sea|archivedate=June 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://amti.csis.org/what-makes-an-island-land-reclamation-and-the-south-china-sea-arbitration/|title=What Makes an Island?

An [[river island|island in a river]] or a [[lake island]] may be called an [[ait|eyot or ait]], and a small island off the coast may be called a [[holm (island)|holm]]. Sedimentary islands in the [[Ganges delta]] are called [[List of islands of Bangladesh|chars]].

While some are transitory and may disappear if the volume or speed of the current changes, others are stable and long-lived.\n\n[[Islet|Islets]] are very small islands.\n\n===Oceanic islands===\n{{Main article|High island}}\n\nOceanic islands are islands that do not sit on continental shelves. The vast majority are [[volcano|volcanic]] in origin, such as [[Saint Helena]] in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]].<ref>Lomolino, Mark V. (editor); (et al.)

University of Chicago Press. p. 316. {{ISBN|0-226-49236-2}}</ref> The few oceanic islands that are not volcanic are [[tectonic]] in origin and arise where plate movements have lifted up the ocean floor above the surface. Examples are [[Saint Peter and Paul Rocks]] in the Atlantic Ocean and [[Macquarie Island]] in the Pacific.\n\nOne type of volcanic oceanic island is found in a volcanic island arc. These islands arise from volcanoes where the [[subduction]] of one plate under another is occurring. Examples are the [[Aleutian Islands]], the [[Mariana Islands]], and most of [[Tonga]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The only examples in the Atlantic Ocean are some of the [[Lesser Antilles]] and the [[South Sandwich Islands]].\n\nAnother type of volcanic oceanic island occurs where an [[oceanic rift]] reaches the surface. There are two examples: [[Iceland]], which is the world's second largest volcanic island, and [[Jan Mayen]]. Both are in the Atlantic.\n\nA third type of volcanic oceanic island is formed over volcanic [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]]. A hotspot is more or less stationary relative to the moving [[tectonic plate]] above it, so a chain of islands results as the plate drifts. Over long periods of time, this type of island is eventually \"drowned\" by [[isostasy|isostatic adjustment]] and eroded, becoming a [[seamount]]. Plate movement across a hot-spot produces a line of islands oriented in the direction of the plate movement. An example is the [[Hawaiian Islands]], from [[Hawaii]] to [[Kure Atoll|Kure]], which continue beneath the sea surface in a more northerly direction as the [[Emperor Seamounts]]. Another chain with similar orientation is the [[Tuamotu Archipelago]]; its older, northerly trend is the [[Line Islands]]. The southernmost chain is the [[Austral Islands]], with its northerly trending part the atolls in the nation of [[Tuvalu]]. [[Tristan da Cunha]] is an example of a hotspot volcano in the Atlantic Ocean. Another hotspot in the Atlantic is the island of [[Surtsey]], which was formed in 1963.\n\nAn [[atoll]] is an island formed from a [[coral reef]] that has grown on an eroded and submerged volcanic island. The [[reef]] rises to the surface of the water and forms a new island. Atolls are typically ring-shaped with a central [[lagoon]]. Examples are the [[Line Islands]] in the Pacific and the [[Maldives]] in the [[Indian Ocean]].\n\n===Tropical islands===\n{{See also|Coral reef#Formation}}\n\n[[File:Landing Runway 18 (2121588367).jpg|thumb|right| Plane landing on an airport island, [[Velana International Airport]], [[Hulhul\u00e9 Island]], [[Maldives]]]]\n\nApproximately 45,000 [[Tropics|tropical]] islands with an [[area]] of at least {{convert|5|ha}} exist.<ref name=\"TI\">{{cite book\n|doi=10.1553/3-7001-2738-3\n|title=The Tropical Islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans\n|author=Austrian Academy of Sciences\n|author-link=Austrian Academy of Sciences}}</ref> Examples [[Coral reef#Formation|formed from coral reefs]] include [[Maldives]], [[Tonga]], [[Samoa]], [[Nauru]], and [[Polynesia]].<ref name=\"TI\"/> [[Granite]] islands include [[Seychelles]] and [[Tioman Island|Tioman]] and [[Volcano|volcanic]] islands such as [[Saint Helena]].\n\nThe socio-economic diversity of tropical islands ranges from the [[Stone Age]] societies in the interior of [[North Sentinel]], [[Madagascar]], [[Borneo]], and [[Papua New Guinea]] to the high-tech lifestyles of the city-islands of [[Singapore]] and [[Hong Kong]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Tropical Islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans|last = Arnberger|first = Hertha, Erik|publisher = Austrian Academy of Sciences Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-3-7001-2738-3|location = Vienna|pages = }}</ref>\n\nInternational [[tourism]] is a significant factor in the economy of many tropical islands including Seychelles, [[Sri Lanka]], [[Mauritius]],  [[R\u00e9union]], [[Hawaii]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Maldives]].\n\n==Artificial islands==\n{{Main article|Artificial island}}\n\nAlmost all of [[Earth]]'s islands are natural and have been formed by tectonic forces or volcanic eruptions. However, artificial (man-made) islands also exist, such as the island in [[Osaka Bay]] off the [[Japan]]ese island of [[Honshu]], on which [[Kansai International Airport]] is located. Artificial islands can be built using natural materials (e.g., earth, rock, or sand) or artificial ones (e.g., [[concrete]] slabs or recycled [[waste]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-07/building-artificial-islands-rise-sea|title=Building Artificial Islands That Rise With the Sea|access-date=2016-06-28|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605152821/http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2012-07/building-artificial-islands-rise-sea|archivedate=June 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://amti.csis.org/what-makes-an-island-land-reclamation-and-the-south-china-sea-arbitration/|title=What Makes an Island?
