The previous head of the Memorial Area Simo Brdar estimated at least 365,000 dead at Jasenovac. The analyses of statisticians [[Vladimir \u017derjavi\u0107]] and [[Bogoljub Ko\u010dovi\u0107]] were similar to those of the Memorial Area. In all of Yugoslavia, the estimated number of Serb deaths was 487,000 according to Ko\u010dovi\u0107, and 530,000 according to \u017derjavi\u0107, out of a total of 1,014,000 or 1,027,000 deaths (respectively). \u017derjavi\u0107 further stated there were 197,000 Serb civilians killed in NDH (78,000 as prisoners in Jasenovac and elsewhere) as well as 125,000 Serb combatants.\n\nThe [[Belgrade]] Museum of Holocaust compiled a list of over 77,000 names of Jasenovac victims. It was previously headed by Milan Bulaji\u0107, who supported the claim of a total of 700,000 victims. The current administration of the Museum has further expanded the list to include a bit over 80,000 names.

The first mass killing of Serbs was carried out on April 30,1941, when the Usta\u0161e rounded up and killed 196 Serbs at [[Gudovac massacre|Gudovac]]. Many other massacres soon followed, including at [[Blagaj massacre|Blagaj]], [[Glina massacres|Glina]], Korita, Nevesinje, [[Prebilovci massacre|Prebilovci]], Metkovic, Oto\u010dac, Vo\u010din, [[\u0160argovac]], etc. Here is how the Croatian Catholic Bishop of Mostar, [[Alojzije Mi\u0161i\u0107]], described the mass killings of Serb civilians just in one small area of [[Herzegovina]], just during the first 6 months of the war:<ref>[http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=37130 Mostarski biskup Alojzije Mi\u0161i\u0107 za vrijeme Drugog svjetskog rata, Tomo Vuku\u0161i\u0107]</ref><blockquote>People were captured like beasts. Slaughtered, killed, thrown live into the abyss. Women, mothers with children, young women, girls and boys were thrown into pits. The vice-mayor of Mostar, Mr. Balji\u0107, a Mohammedan, publicly states, although as an official he should be silent and not talk, that in Ljubinje alone 700 schismatics [i.e. Serb Orthodox Christians] were thrown into one pit. Six full train carriages of women, mothers and girls, children under age 10, were taken from Mostar and \u010capljina to the \u0160urmanci station, where they were unloaded and taken into the hills, with live mothers and their children tossed down the cliffs. Everyone was tossed and killed. In the Klepci parish, from the surrounding villages, 3,700 schismatics were killed. Poor souls, they were calm. I will not enumerate further. I would go too far. In the city of Mostar, hundreds were tied up, taken outside the city and killed like animals.</blockquote>\n\n=== Religious persecution ===\nThe Usta\u0161e not only conducted forcible conversions of Serbs to Catholicism, but on occasion they used the prospect of conversion as a means to gather Serbs together so they could kill them, which is what occurred at [[Glina massacres|Glina]]. On 18 May 1943, [[Aloysius Stepinac|Archbishop Stepinac]] wrote a letter to the pope, in which he estimated 240.000 conversions to date{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=541}}. The Usta\u0161e killed 157 Orthodox priests, among them 3 Serb Orthodox bishops (cutting the throat of the bishop of Banja Luka and killing the archbishop of Sarajevo),{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=528}} while they jailed and tortured [[:sh:Dositej Vasi\u0107|the Orthodox archbishop of Zagreb]]. The Usta\u0161e expelled to Serbia 327 Orthodox priests and one bishop, while 2 other bishops and 12 priests left on their own.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=529}} Thus 85% of the Orthodox priests in the Independent State of Croatia were either killed or expelled by the Usta\u0161e, in order to \"leave the Orthodox population without spiritual leadership so the Usta\u0161as\u2019 policy of forced or fear-induced conversions to Catholicism would be easier to carry out\" {{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=529}}\n\nThe Usta\u0161e destroyed and desecrated numerous Orthodox Churches,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=529}} forbade the Cyrillic script and Julian calendar (both used in the Orthodox Church), even prohibited the term \"Serbian Orthodox Church\". Orthodox schools were shut down,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=531}} and the Church was prohibited from collecting contributions from believers, robbing it of income.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=531}} Orthodox Church properties were confiscated by the Usta\u0161e,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=531}} some turned over to the Croatian Catholic Church. Finally, to destroy the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Usta\u0161e tried to create its own, alternative Croatian Orthodox Church, with an imported Russian priest. but failed to gain adherents.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=545}}\n\nDespite these many actions by the Usta\u0161e to destroy the Serbian Orthodox Church, Tomasevich found no condemnations of these crimes, public or private, by Catholic Archbishop Stepinac or any other members of the Croatian Catholic Church. On the contrary, he states that this massive Usta\u0161e attack on the Serbian Orthodox Church \"was approved and supported by many Croatian Catholic priests\",{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=531}} and that the Croatian Roman Catholic Church hierarchy and the Vatican \"regarded Usta\u0161e policies against the Serbs and Serbian Orthodox Church as advantageous to Roman Catholicism\".{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=565}}\n\n==Connections with the Catholic Church==\n{{main|Catholic clergy involvement with the Usta\u0161e}}\nDuring 23 years of the existence of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1918-1941), the Catholic Clergy was deeply dissatisfied with the regime: \"... a massive press campaing was launched to mobilize Croatia's nearly three million Catholics against the central goverment's measures penalizing Saint Peter's apostolate.

Like the Nazis, the Usta\u0161e deemed Jews, Romani, and Slavs to be sub-humans ([[Untermenschen]]). They endorsed the claims from German racial theorists that Croats were not Slavs but a Germanic race. Their genocides against Serbs, Jews, and Romani were thus expressions of Nazi racial ideology. However, the Usta\u0161e viewed the Bosniaks as \"Muslim Croats,\" not Slavs, and as a result did not persecute Muslim Bosniaks on the basis of race.<ref name=\"fischer\"/>\n\nIn addition to Nazi racial theory, the Usta\u0161e ideology incorporated [[fascism]], [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Croatian nationalism]].<ref name=\"kroatische\"/> The Usta\u0161e supported the creation of a [[Greater Croatia]] that would span the [[Drina]] River and extend to the border of [[Belgrade]].<ref>Meier, Viktor.

This variance stems from the fact that ''Usta\u0161e'' is the plural form of ''Usta\u0161a'' in the [[Serbo-Croatian language]].\n\nFiercely Roman Catholic, the Usta\u0161e espoused [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Islam]] as the religions of the Croats and Bosniaks and condemned [[Orthodox Christianity]], which was the main religion of the Serbs.

The previous head of the Memorial Area Simo Brdar estimated at least 365,000 dead at Jasenovac. The analyses of statisticians [[Vladimir \u017derjavi\u0107]] and [[Bogoljub Ko\u010dovi\u0107]] were similar to those of the Memorial Area. In all of Yugoslavia, the estimated number of Serb deaths was 487,000 according to Ko\u010dovi\u0107, and 530,000 according to \u017derjavi\u0107, out of a total of 1,014,000 or 1,027,000 deaths (respectively). \u017derjavi\u0107 further stated there were 197,000 Serb civilians killed in NDH (78,000 as prisoners in Jasenovac and elsewhere) as well as 125,000 Serb combatants.\n\nThe [[Belgrade]] Museum of Holocaust compiled a list of over 77,000 names of Jasenovac victims. It was previously headed by Milan Bulaji\u0107, who supported the claim of a total of 700,000 victims. The current administration of the Museum has further expanded the list to include a bit over 80,000 names.

The first mass killing of Serbs was carried out on April 30,1941, when the Usta\u0161e rounded up and killed 196 Serbs at [[Gudovac massacre|Gudovac]]. Many other massacres soon followed, including at [[Blagaj massacre|Blagaj]], [[Glina massacres|Glina]], Korita, Nevesinje, [[Prebilovci massacre|Prebilovci]], Metkovic, Oto\u010dac, Vo\u010din, [[\u0160argovac]], etc. Here is how the Croatian Catholic Bishop of Mostar, [[Alojzije Mi\u0161i\u0107]], described the mass killings of Serb civilians just in one small area of [[Herzegovina]], just during the first 6 months of the war:<ref>[http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=37130 Mostarski biskup Alojzije Mi\u0161i\u0107 za vrijeme Drugog svjetskog rata, Tomo Vuku\u0161i\u0107]</ref><blockquote>People were captured like beasts. Slaughtered, killed, thrown live into the abyss. Women, mothers with children, young women, girls and boys were thrown into pits. The vice-mayor of Mostar, Mr. Balji\u0107, a Mohammedan, publicly states, although as an official he should be silent and not talk, that in Ljubinje alone 700 schismatics [i.e. Serb Orthodox Christians] were thrown into one pit. Six full train carriages of women, mothers and girls, children under age 10, were taken from Mostar and \u010capljina to the \u0160urmanci station, where they were unloaded and taken into the hills, with live mothers and their children tossed down the cliffs. Everyone was tossed and killed. In the Klepci parish, from the surrounding villages, 3,700 schismatics were killed. Poor souls, they were calm. I will not enumerate further. I would go too far. In the city of Mostar, hundreds were tied up, taken outside the city and killed like animals.</blockquote>\n\n=== Religious persecution ===\nThe Usta\u0161e not only conducted forcible conversions of Serbs to Catholicism, but on occasion they used the prospect of conversion as a means to gather Serbs together so they could kill them, which is what occurred at [[Glina massacres|Glina]]. On 18 May 1943, [[Aloysius Stepinac|Archbishop Stepinac]] wrote a letter to the pope, in which he estimated 240.000 conversions to date{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=541}}. The Usta\u0161e killed 157 Orthodox priests, among them 3 Serb Orthodox bishops (cutting the throat of the bishop of Banja Luka and killing the archbishop of Sarajevo),{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=528}} while they jailed and tortured [[:sh:Dositej Vasi\u0107|the Orthodox archbishop of Zagreb]]. The Usta\u0161e expelled to Serbia 327 Orthodox priests and one bishop, while 2 other bishops and 12 priests left on their own.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=529}} Thus 85% of the Orthodox priests in the Independent State of Croatia were either killed or expelled by the Usta\u0161e, in order to \"leave the Orthodox population without spiritual leadership so the Usta\u0161as\u2019 policy of forced or fear-induced conversions to Catholicism would be easier to carry out\" {{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=529}}\n\nThe Usta\u0161e destroyed and desecrated numerous Orthodox Churches,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=529}} forbade the Cyrillic script and Julian calendar (both used in the Orthodox Church), even prohibited the term \"Serbian Orthodox Church\". Orthodox schools were shut down,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=531}} and the Church was prohibited from collecting contributions from believers, robbing it of income.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=531}} Orthodox Church properties were confiscated by the Usta\u0161e,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=531}} some turned over to the Croatian Catholic Church. Finally, to destroy the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Usta\u0161e tried to create its own, alternative Croatian Orthodox Church, with an imported Russian priest. but failed to gain adherents.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=545}}\n\nDespite these many actions by the Usta\u0161e to destroy the Serbian Orthodox Church, Tomasevich found no condemnations of these crimes, public or private, by Catholic Archbishop Stepinac or any other members of the Croatian Catholic Church. On the contrary, he states that this massive Usta\u0161e attack on the Serbian Orthodox Church \"was approved and supported by many Croatian Catholic priests\",{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=531}} and that the Croatian Roman Catholic Church hierarchy and the Vatican \"regarded Usta\u0161e policies against the Serbs and Serbian Orthodox Church as advantageous to Roman Catholicism\".{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=565}}\n\n==Connections with the Catholic Church==\n{{main|Catholic clergy involvement with the Usta\u0161e}}\nDuring 23 years of the existence of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1918-1941), the Catholic Clergy was deeply dissatisfied with the regime: \"... a massive press campaing was launched to mobilize Croatia's nearly three million Catholics against the central goverment's measures penalizing Saint Peter's apostolate.

Gavin Dahl is one of the most famous puzzle masters to ever walk on earth.  His previous master Emanuel Falaylae granted him power. No one else in Minnesota is a puzzle masters but puzzap and down. The episode was written by Lang Fisher and directed by [[Akiva Schaffer]]. It aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on April 8, 2018. The episode features guest appearances from [[David Fumero]], [[Will Shortz]], and [[Allison Tolman]].\n\nThe show revolves around the fictitious 99th precinct of the [[New York Police Department]] in [[Brooklyn]] and the officers and detectives that work in the precinct. In the episode, Jake and Amy work on their last case before Amy becomes a Sergeant by working with Amy's favorite puzzle master, Vin Stermley. However, when Vin and Amy bond throughout the investigation, Jake grows jealous. Meanwhile, Holt and Gina meet the competition for Police Commissioner and are intimidated by a young woman in the running while Terry, Rosa, Hitchcock, and Scully debate over who should get the new Detective car.\n\nAccording to [[Nielsen Media Research]], the episode was seen by an estimated 1.74 million household viewers and gained a 0.8/3 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349. The episode received positive reviews from critics, who praised Samberg's performance, character development and writing although the subplots received a mixed response.\n\n==Plot==\nAmy ([[Melissa Fumero]]) learns that she has passed her Sergeant's Exam and will be officially named in a week. Jake ([[Andy Samberg]]) decides to work with her on their last case before she is a sergeant and chooses an investigation of a series of arsons connected with Amy's love for crosswords.\n\nTo Amy's delight, Jake brings in the victim, Amy's favorite puzzle author, Melvin Stermley ([[David Fumero]]). To Jake\u2019s dismay, however, \u201cVin\u201d turns out to be hunky, personable, and the opposite of the nerd Jake envisioned. Vin and Amy begin bonding throughout the case, causing Jake to feel jealous. While pursuing a suspect due to Vin's hunch, Jake doesn't follow protocol and goes to another place for the next arson but finds that Vin's hunch was right, angering Amy. After Jake apologizes for his behavior, he solves the case by finding that it was Vin's obsessed neighbor who caused the fires (as part of an elaborate puzzle-marriage proposal).\n\nMeanwhile, Holt ([[Andre Braugher]]) and Gina ([[Chelsea Peretti]]) meet the competition for the Police Commissioner position. At the meeting, Holt is intimidated by Captain Olivia Crawford ([[Allison Tolman]]) who is in the running for the position. Holt solves the truce by proposing equal treatment for everyone running and both set aside their differences. Also, Terry ([[Terry Crews]]), Rosa ([[Stephanie Beatriz]]), Hitchcock ([[Dirk Blocker]]), and Scully ([[Joel McKinnon Miller]]) debate over who should get the new Detective car. Rosa decides to give it to Terry, who is willing to help his colleagues whenever in need.\n\n==Reception==\n===Viewers===\nIn its original American broadcast, \"The Puzzle Master\" was seen by an estimated 1.74 million household viewers and gained a 0.8/3 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349, according to [[Nielsen Media Research]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/sunday-final-ratings-april-8-2018/|title=\u2018America\u2019s Funniest Home Videos\u2019 rerun adjusts up: Sunday final ratings|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Porter|first=Rick|date=April 10, 2018|accessdate=January 7, 2019}}</ref> This was slight decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 1.78 million viewers with a 0.8/3 in the 18-49 demographics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/sunday-final-ratings-april-1-2018/|title=\u2018Bob\u2019s Burgers\u2019 and \u2018Dateline\u2019 adjust up: Sunday final ratings|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Porter|first=Rick|date=April 3, 2018|accessdate=January 6, 2019}}</ref> This means that 0.8 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 3 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it.
