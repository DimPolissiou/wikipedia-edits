There he befriends [[Norman Bates]] and ends up inheriting the Bates Motel. It was originally produced as a [[television pilot|pilot]] for a proposed TV series set in the Bates Motel, but it was not picked up by the network.\n\n==Plot==\nAlex West ([[Bud Cort]]) roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) at the state lunatic asylum nearly twenty years for killing his abusive stepfather, and they became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willie ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, Mrs. Bates, are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest.\n\nAlex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by.

The force comprised [[No. 151 Wing RAF|151 Wing]] [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), with two squadrons of [[Hawker Hurricane]] [[fighter aircraft|fighters]]. The wing flew against the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (German air force) and the ''[[Suomen Ilmavoimat]]'' (Finnish Air Force) from Vaenga (now [[Severomorsk]]) in northern [[USSR]] and train Soviet pilots and ground crews to operate the Hurricanes when their British pilots and ground crews returned to Britain.\n\nTwenty-four Hurricanes were delivered by [[Operation Strength (1941)|Operation Strength]], flying direct to Vaenga from the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Argus|I49|6}} but [[Operation Dervish (1941)|Operation Dervish]], the first Arctic convoy, was diverted from Murmansk to Archangelsk another {{convert|400|mi|km|abbr=on}} on. The fifteen crated Hurricanes for 151 Wing had to be assembled at Keg Ostrov airstrip. Despite primitive conditions, the Hurricanes were readied in nine days, with excellent co-operation from the Russian authorities; the aircraft flew to Vaenga on 12 September.\n\nIn five weeks of operations, 151 Wing claimed 16 victories, four probables and seven aircraft damaged. The winter snows began on 22 September and converting pilots and ground crews of [[Soviet Naval Aviation]] ({{lang|ru|Aviatsiya voyenno-morskogo flota}}) of the VVS to Hurricanes began in mid-October. The RAF party departed for Britain in late November, less various signals staff, arrived on 7 December and 151 Wing disbanded. The British and Russian governments gave Benedict much publicity and four members of 151 Wing received the [[Order of Lenin]].\n\n== Background ==\n\n===Diplomacy===\n\n{{main|Operation Barbarossa}}\n\nOn 22 June 1941, the [[Soviet Union]] was invaded by [[Nazi Germany]] and its allies. That evening, [[Winston Churchill]] broadcast a promise of assistance to the USSR against the common enemy. On 7 July, Churchill wrote to Stalin and ordered the British ambassador in Moscow, [[Stafford Cripps]], to begin discussions for a treaty of mutual assistance. On 12 July, an Anglo-Soviet Agreement was signed in Moscow, to fight together and not make a separate peace.{{sfn|Golley|1987|p=59}} On the same day a Soviet commission met the [[Royal Navy]] and the RAF in London and it was decided to use the airfield at [[Vaenga airfield|Vaenga]] (now [[Severomorsk]]) as a fighter base to defend ships while unloading at the ports of Murmansk, Arkhangelsk and [[Polyarny District|Polyarny]].{{sfn|Richards|Saunders|1975|p=78}} [[Ivan Maisky]], the Soviet ambassador in London since 1932, replied on 18 July that new fronts in northern France and the Arctic would improve the situation in the USSR.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|pp=8\u201315}}\n\nOperations in the Arctic were favoured by Stalin and Churchill, but the First Sea Lord, Admiral [[Dudley Pound]] considered such proposals unsound, \"with the dice loaded against us in every direction\". The [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and Churchill met at [[Placentia Bay]], [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] on 9 August and on 12 August communicated an assurance to Stalin that the western Allies were going to provide \"the very maximum of supplies\".{{sfn|Woodman|2004|pp=8\u201315}} A joint supply mission led by [[W. Averell Harriman]] and [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Max Aitken (Lord Beaverbrook)]] arrived at Archangelsk on 27 September and on 6 October, Churchill made a commitment to sail a convoy every ten days from Iceland to north Russia.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|pp=8\u201315}} When Arctic convoys passed by the north of Norway into the [[Barents Sea]], they came well into range of German aircraft, U-boats and ships operating from bases in Norway and Finland. The ports of arrival, especially Murmansk, only about {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of the front line were vulnerable to attack by the ''Luftwaffe''.{{sfn|Richards|Saunders|1975|p=78}}\n\n===151 Wing===\n\n{{main|No. 151 Wing RAF}}\n\nThe RAF contingent was to consist of two squadrons of [[Hawker Hurricane]]s and one squadron each of twin-engined [[Bristol Blenheim]]s and [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s. The Commander-in-Chief of the RAF [[Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford|Charles Portal]] decided on 25 July to send only [[No. 151 Wing RAF]] ([[Neville Ramsbottom-Isherwood]]) comprising [[No. 81 Squadron RAF|81 Squadron]] (Squadron Leader A. H. [Tony] Rook) and [[No. 134 Squadron RAF|134 Squadron]] (Squadron Leader A. G. [Tony] Miller), equipped with Hawker Hurricane Mk IIBs.{{sfn|Mellinger|2006|p=7}} A Flight of [[No. 504 Squadron RAF|504 Squadron]], based in Exeter, formed the nucleus of a new 81 Squadron and were sent on leave, to return to [[RAF Leconfield]] in Yorkshire or had just completed their training; two pilots of [[No. 615 Squadron RAF|615 Squadron]] who had deliberately failed a night fighter conversion course, were also posted to 151 Wing. The wing headquarters comprised about 350 administrative, signals, engineering, maintenance, transport, medical and non-technical staff and each squadron had a commanding officer, two flight commanders, at least thirty pilots and about 100 ground staff.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=73, 79, 87}} The wing was to be transported to north Russia in the first Arctic convoy and was to operate until the weather in October or November grounded the aircraft. During the winter lull, the fighters were to be handed over to the [[Soviet Air Forces]] (VVS, ''Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily'').{{sfn|Richards|Saunders|1975|p=78}} After several delays, a 151 Wing advance party of two officers and 23 men departed from Leconfield in mid-August.{{sfn|Golley|1987|p=81}}{{efn|81 Squadron Hurricanes: BD697, BD792, BD818, BD822, Z3746, Z3768, Z3977, Z4006, Z4017, Z4018, Z5107, Z5122, Z5157, Z5207, Z5208,Z5209, Z5227, Z5122 and Z5228; 134 Squadron machines: BD699, BD790, BD825, Z3763, Z3978, Z4012, Z4013, Z5120, Z5123, Z5134, Z5159, Z5205, Z5206, Z5210, Z5211, Z5226, Z5236, Z5253, Z5303 and Z5763.{{sfn|Harkins|2013|p=61}}}}\n\n===Voyage===\n\n{{main|Operation Dervish (1941)}}\n\n[[File:Hurricane.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Preserved Hurricane Mk IIB ''Z5140''}}]]\nThe Main Party, the majority of the 2,700 men of 151 Wing, including fourteen pilots was embarked on the troopship [[Landing ship, infantry|SS ''Llanstephan Castle'']] together with 15 Hurricanes packed in crates, at the [[Scapa Flow]] anchorage in the [[Orkney Islands]].{{sfn|Woodman|2004|pp=36\u201337}} The ships departed from Scapa Flow on 17 August 1941 with the Dervish Convoy and headed towards the [[Svalbard]] Archipelago and the [[midnight sun]], to circle as far north around Norway as possible. Also embarked were Vernon Bartlett MP, an American newspaper reporter Wallace Carrol, [[Feliks Topolski]], the Polish expressionist painter travelling as an official British and Polish [[war artist]], a Polish Legation, a Czechoslovak commission and [[Charlotte Haldane]] a noted feminist and member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], who lectured on ''Domestic life in Russia'' as part of an impromptu course laid on by the civilian passengers. The danger of ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' attacks on Murmansk led to the ships being diverted at Archangelsk, another {{convert|400|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the east. As the ''Llanstephan Castle'' sailed upriver to dock, rifle shots were heard and a member of the crew was hit in the arm, the gunfire coming from people onshore who mistook the British uniforms for German ones.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=82, 85\u201390}}\n\nThe ship anchored about {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the dock and workers began to build a wooden dock outwards towards them, a race against time before the waters froze; the passengers being surprised to find that most of the dockworkers were women. Ramsbottom-Isherwood had made a plan in case a British liaison party from Moscow failed to arrive and intended to use the 151 Wing transport to travel to Vaenga, only to be surprised to find that that no roads to Murmansk existed. The liaison party led by Air Vice-Marshal [[Basil Collier]] did arrive and discussions ensued as to the whereabouts of the Advance Party which had travelled ahead with equipment and stores. The pilots on ''Argus'' were due to arrive at Vaenga in a few days' time and he also needed the fifteen dismantled and crated Hurricanes carried by Dervish, to make up the wing complement of 39 Hurricanes. It had been intended to transport the wing by train but the Kandalaksha\u2013Murmansk railway had been bombed by the ''Luftwaffe''. A small party of signallers were sent to Keg Ostrov (island) airfield outside Arachangelsk and a party of 200 men with the wing commander were to travel by sea in the destroyers {{HMS|Electra|H27|6}} and {{HMS|Active|H14|2}} in two days' time. Two days later a group was to travel by tramp steamer to Kandalaksha, thence by train to Vaenga and two parties were to follow by rail, once the line had been repaired.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=90\u201393}}\n\n===Operation Strength===\n\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A12882.jpg|thumb|left|{{centre|HMS ''Argus'', photographed in 1942 during [[Operation Torch]] (A12882)}}]]\nTwenty-four aircraft and pilots went on board the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Argus|I49|6}} at [[Gourock]] near Glasgow and sailed for Scapa Flow. The departure of the ship was delayed for ten days and fears rose that the voyage would be cancelled but eventually ''Argus'' sailed, escorted by a cruiser and three destroyers.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|pp=36\u201337}} Much of the journey was in fog, only a marker from the ship in front being visible. The rum ration was appreciated and the pilots inspected the new Hurricane Mk IIB fighters, stored below decks minus their wings. The Hurricane pilots thought that the deck was rather short for taking off and took an interest in the two Martlet ([[Grumman F4F Wildcat]]) fighters kept at readiness. The weather remained unchanged as the carrier turned south for Russia but when the ship reached the departure point, it was dead calm and ''Argus'' had to sail in circles until the wind rose sufficiently. The Martlets had to be dismantled before the Hurricanes could be put on the flight deck six at a time; ''Argus'' would be steaming into wind at {{convert|17|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=94\u201396}}\n\nThe [[Fleet Air Arm]] aircrew briefed the pilots, to make sure that they rolled onto the ramp at the end of the flight deck, to get a shove into the air. To avoid problems with magnetic compasses at that latitude, one of the destroyers would point towards the coast and once three Hurricane pilots had formed a [[Vic formation|vic]], they were to line up along it and keep going until they reached the coast, then turn right for Vaenga, a few miles inland.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=94\u201396}} The squadron commanders briefed their pilots that 134 Squadron would take off first and that they were to keep a sharp lookout for German fighters but that they would carry only six of their twelve machine-guns to save weight. The first Hurricanes came up on the lift into a grey overcast day and the fight deck began to vibrate as the ship picked up speed into a light headwind and the Hurricane engines were started. Tony Miller, the 134 Squadron leader, went first, hit the ramp as suggested by the navy pilots and got airborne, despite the undercarriage being too damaged to retract. The other pilots saw that they would have to get airborne ''without'' hitting the ramp, because Hurricane undercarriages were not robust enough to use the method. Each vic assembled at about {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, flew along the destroyer guide and after about twenty minutes reached the coast and turned to starboard. Visibility was good and after about seventy minutes' flying, Vaenga was easy to see, as was the first Hurricane to land, which had come in wheels-up.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=96\u2013101}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Keg Ostrov===\n\nThe first men off ''Llanstephen Castle'' were mostly the R/T personnel needed at Vaenga to communicate with the Hurricanes when they arrived from ''Argus''. The men were flown from Keg Ostrov on successive days, the first flight being routine. On the second day the aircraft was intercepted by German aircraft and had to run for home, fortunate that German aircraft were at the limit of their range and could not pursue; the pilot tried again next day and reached Vaenga. A group of about 200 men sailed on the two destroyers and reached Murmansk in 22 hours but missed a Russian destroyer which was supposed to guide them into port through the minefields; the captain used the [[Sonar|Asdic]] set instead and docked safely. On 28 August, the men at Archangelsk formed an Erection Party (sic) of 36 men under the engineer-officer Flt/Lt Gittins and Warrant Officer Hards. The men went by boat to Keg Ostrov and found fifteen crates on a mud flat near the hangars. One crate was emptied to accommodate the wireless section and then the men found that some types of specialist tools had been omitted from the maintenance kits but that tropical insulation covers for the engines had been included. A Russian engineer officer improvised airscrew and spark-plug spanners in the airfield workshop and later built proper engine covers, with a trunk underneath for a \"hot air lorry\" to boost the temperature of the engine.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=103\u2013105}}\n\nAt {{nowrap|1:30 p.m.}} the second Hurricane was extracted from its packing case and at {{nowrap|3:30 p.m.}} was pushed into a hangar, followed by a third at {{nowrap|6:30 p.m.}} by when the [[Wireless telegraphy|WT]] station was operational. Due to a lack of lifting gear work stopped soon after and the British were accommodated on a paddleboat that looked like a Mississippi steamer. The main problem in re-assembling the aircraft was a lack of lifting gear for un-crating, jacking-up, lowering onto the undercarriage, adding the wings tail unit, then arming, fuelling and air testing. Next day, the Russians provided three {{convert|1000|kg|lb|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} cranes, which had to be wound by hand to jack up the aircraft. By the evening of the second day, two Hurricanes had their wings on and as it had begun to rain, no more Hurricanes were unpacked. The men were split into three groups, to concentrate on fitting wings and tail units of the ones already out. The British worked thirteen-hour days and were surprised by the lavish Russian hospitality compared with the rations at home, which manifested in stomach upsets (the ''grumbleguts''); a doctor was sent up from ''Llanstephen Castle''. By afternoon, five aircraft had been assembled and pushed into the hangar. The Main Party on the troopship were still cooped up but parties going ashore were required to be armed in case the locals took them for Germans. When the final assembly of the first Hurricane was complete on the fifth day, an engine test was run at {{nowrap|8:37 p.m.}} in front of a throng of dignitaries and spectators.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=105\u2013109}}\n\nOn the sixth day, three Hurricanes were prepared for air tests, which attracted more dignitaries including admirals of the navy and naval air force. The local military forces and anti-aircraft units were notified and then the Hurricane pilots put on as much of a show as the low cloud base allowed, mainly tight turns and low-level passes. Next day engineers arrived from Moscow to discuss the fuel to be used in the Hurricanes, Soviet aircraft still using 87-octane rather than the 100-octane of the British machines. Henry Broquet worked with the engineers to make the local fuel compatible with the Merlin engine, which led to the development of a tin catalyst which improved combustion efficiency.{{sfn|Broquet|1999|pp=1\u20132}} In the evening the British had some English food for a change and by the ninth day, all fifteen aircraft were ready and had improved the morale of the Archangelsk residents who had seen them perform.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=109\u2013110}} The aircraft were flown the {{convert|300|mi|km|abbr=on}} to Vaenga on 12 September, guided by a Russian bomber, with the cloud base up to {{convert|6000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The formation flew over the White Sea, exchanging recognition signals with Russian ships and landed safely at Vaenga, just as the Hurricanes from ''Argus'' returned from a sortie.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=131\u2013132}} Two Hurricanes, whose pilots succumbed to Russian hospitality at a refuelling stop, were late, having to continue the morning after.{{sfn|Richards|Saunders|1975|p=78}}\n\n===Vaenga airfield===\n\n{{main|Murmansk Oblast|Severomorsk}}\n\n [[File:Polikarpov I-16-Spain (clipped).jpg|thumb|{{centre|Modern example of a Polikarpov I-16}}]]\nVaenga (now Severomorsk) airfield was the base of the 72nd SAP-SF (Composite Aviation Regiment-Northern Fleet) commanded by Colonel Georgii Gubanov, part of the Northern Fleet Air Force (Major-General [[A. A. Kuznetsov]]) of the Naval Air Fleet. The 4th Squadron of the 72 SAP-SF (Captain [[Boris Safonov]]), flying [[Polikarpov I-16]] fighters, was also based at Vaenga.{{sfn|Mellinger|2006|p=8}} The airfield had an adequate surface of compacted sand, a large oval about {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} long, on its east-west axis. The airfield was in a bowl surrounded by hillocks and woods and was found to get very very bumpy in wet weather.{{sfn|Golley|1987|p=100}} The front line was about {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the west and the airfield facilities were almost invisible, being well dispersed, dug in and camouflaged among the hillocks and growths of silver birch. There was a tarmac road about {{convert|1|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} long along which lay buildings but there were only cart tracks and paths linking the buildings and huts.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=113\u2013114, 142}}\n\nThe airfield was under occasional attack by the ''Luftwaffe'' and Russian soldiers guarded the airfield from positions in the woods around the perimeter.{{sfn|Golley|1987|p=142}} With the autumn rains and the number of lorries driving people to and fro, the tracks quickly became potholed. The aircraft hangars were part-buried for camouflage but had been built for the Polikarpov I-16s and were too narrow for the Hurricanes; Russian workers appeared to widen them, working-non-stop until the enlargement was complete.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=113\u2013114}} Accommodation was in brick buildings and wooden huts, the huts being found to be unkempt, some infested with lice. The bedding was new, the food was ample, though some considered it to be a little greasy and the sanitation was hideous, leading to the British naming the main latrine, directly over a cesspit, \"The Kremlin\". Co-operation from the Russians was excellent and Isherwood established rapport with the Soviet commanding general and arranged bomber escort tactics with the local air commanders.{{sfn|Richards|Saunders|1975|pp=78\u201380}}\n\n==151 Wing operations==\n\n===11 September===\n\n[[File:Fisher Peninsula.svg|thumb|{{centre|Map showing the Rybachy Peninsula (also Fisherman's Island)}}]]\nThe Arctic autumn was cold but the air was dry, not like the damp cold of England. On 11 September, the first operation was flown, a familiarisation flight to learn the local geography and to test their guns. There was good visibility among broken clouds and the formation flew at {{convert|3500|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The pilots studied the [[Rybachy Peninsula]] and Murmansk then flew towards the south, to avoid [[Petsamo, Finland|Petsamo]] to the west. Without the ground radar control available in Britain. The pilots would have to navigate for themselves but there was a pleasing lack of mountains and it was a simple matter to fly north to follow the coast home or west to reach the [[Kola Bay|Kola Inlet]]. There were a few flurries of snow during the evening but the Russians assured the British that the real winter snows would not begin until late September \u2013 early October. The last Hurricanes to be assembled were still at Keg Ostrov, the engines had to be adjusted to fly on [[Avgas|87-octane]] fuel and a shortage of [[Sear (firearm)|sears]], necessary to trigger the guns, meant only six per aircraft instead of the twelve usually carried.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=115\u2013117}}\n\n===12\u201313 September===\n\n[[File:Henschel Hs 126 (15247029576).jpg|thumb|{{centre|A Henschel Hs 126 reconnaissance aircraft of the type shot down on 12 September (15247029576)}}]]\nOn 12 September, three Hurricanes of 134 Squadron carried out the inaugural patrol of 151 Wing; in good visibility the Hurricane pilots saw German bombers but were not able to make contact. The second patrol was flown by two Hurricanes of 81 Squadron, which damaged a Me 110 and later on, 134 Squadron escorted two uneventful Soviet bomber sorties.{{sfn|Golley|1987|p=118}} Five Hurricanes of 81 Squadron at readiness were [[Scrambling (military)|scramble]] and flew westwards at {{convert|5000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Midway between Murmansk and the coast, the pilots looked for Russian anti-aircraft fire, to indicate the location of the German aircraft. After a few minutes, the pilots saw flak bursts and saw a formation of a [[Henschel Hs 126]] reconnaissance aircraft with five [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]E escorts from Petsamo, flying from left to right. Unexpectedly, the Bf 109s turned away as the Hurricanes attacked. Three of the Bf 109s were confirmed shot down and the Henschel, hit in the engine and seen leaving a plume of smoke was recorded as a probable, for a loss of one pilot (Sergeant \"Nudger\" Smith) and his Hurricane. Later in the afternoon, aircraft of 134 Squadron went on patrol and attacked a formation of three German bombers and four Bf 109s heading for Archangelsk; the Germans saw the Hurricanes, jettisoned their bombs and turned for home before the Hurricanes could attack.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=119\u2013133}}\n\n===14\u201327 September===\n\n[[File:Petlyakov Pe-2 Peshka (Pawn) (14467132393).jpg|thumb|{{centre|Petlyakov Pe-2 ''Peshka'' (Pawn) (14467132393)}}]]\n\"Nudger\" Smith was buried on 14 September at a village overlooking the Kola Inlet. On 17 September 81 Squadron was to escort Soviet bombers but German aircraft were reported near the Kola Inlet and the squadron was scrambled and climbed to {{convert|5000|ft|m|abbr=on}} below low cloud. Without warning, the Hurricanes were bounced by Bf 109s, one of which missed a Hurricane, overshot and was promptly shot down, as were three more by other pilots, for no loss. One patrol was flown on 19 September in poor misty weather and next day, two patrols were flown in similar weather. The first real snow fell on 22 September for about ten minutes, leaving a clear sky then began again, leaving the aircraft dispersals and the sand runway full of puddles. Next morning was fine and 81 Squadron escorted [[Petlyakov Pe-2]] light bombers raiding a target in Norway, the Hurricane pilots finding it necessary to fly very fast to keep up. Weather forecasters said that now that the snow had come, the British could expect about six days' decent weather a month.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=144, 151\u2013157, 160\u2013163}}\n\nOn 25 September, the weather improved in the afternoon and Kuznetsov made his first flight in a Hurricane. Bomber escort missions would continue but in second place to the programme to convert Russian pilots and ground crews to the British fighter. On the same day, 81 Squadron was briefed to escort bombers and dive-bombers who were to attack German ground troops near Petsamo; A Flight would cover the dive-bombers and B Flight the medium bombers. A Flight made a formation take-off and then the Pe-2 dive-bombers from a nearby airstrip, followed by B Flight and then the Pe-2 FTs, the Hurricanes flying {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the bombers. The flight to the target and the bombing was uneventful but soon after turning for home, B Flight was bounced by six Bf 109s, three of which were shot down for no loss. The weather on 27 September was very good with some high cloud and 81 Squadron took off again to escort Russian bombers and shot down two more Bf 109s. On the other side of the airfield, 134 Squadron had flown a similar number of patrols and escort sorties but had not been in action against any German aircraft. Around noon, a [[Junkers Ju 88]] flew over Vaenga and 134 Squadron was scrambled. The ground was so wet that the pilots needed a lot of throttle to move and two airmen per aircraft hung over the back of the fuselage to keep the tail down. When the Ju 88 appeared, Flight Lieutenant Vic Berg tried to take off before the airmen had alighted from the tail. when Berg took off the Hurricane rose vertically for about {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}}, then dived into the ground, the two airmen on the back being killed and Berg receiving severe leg injuries.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=164\u2013169}}\n\n===28\u201330 September===\n\n[[File:Silberfuchs-plan.png|left|thumb|{{centre|Map showing the German advance and positions of the 2nd and 3rd Mountain divisions}}]]\nA bomber raid on a {{convert|100|yd|m|abbr=on}} bridge over the [[Pechenga River]] was planned for 28 September. A road the length of the Rybachy Peninsula to the Gulf of Bothnia on the Baltic Sea ran parallel to the river and the bridge was on the only supply route to the German [[2nd Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd]] and [[3rd Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|3rd Mountain]] divisions. The bridge was defended by a large quantity of Flak which rose up at the Pe-2s as they dived to drop their {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bombs. The water smoke and soil thrown up made it impossible to see if the bridge had been hit. As the aircraft flew home, two of the British pilots put on an exhibition of close formation flying for the Russian bomber crews.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=169\u2013170}}\n\nNot long after the aircraft turned for home the {{convert|1500|yd|m|abbr=on}} of ground between the river and the road slipped into the river valley and buried the bridge. With the river blocked, the waters rose and flooded the road, stranding about 15,000 German troops, 7,000 horses and thousands of motor vehicles. The [[6th Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|6th Mountain Division]] had to be diverted to Parkkina for rescue work. Engineers had to dig channels through the earth blocking the river to lower its depth for footbridges to be built to manhandle supplies to the isolated troops. That evening, the rum ration [{{convert|0.5|impgi|ml}}] commenced, as a means to alleviate the cold.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=169\u2013170, 172\u2013173}}{{efn|While the Hurricanes were escorting the bombers, Ramsbottom-Isherwood had to decide what to do with Corporal Flockhart, who it was discovered, had sneaked off and flown as an air-gunner in a Russian bomber.

On 7 October, the weather cleared, with a high cloud base and good visibility and fourteen Ju 88s with six Bf 109 escorts attacked the airfield in the middle of the afternoon. Some of the Hurricanes were airborne before the attack and others, at readiness, scrambled along with other pilots near machines when the alarm sounded. One pilot, \"Scotty\" Edmiston was stopped by a bomb exploding in front of the Hurricane which stopped the engine; as Edmiston climbed out, another bomb blew him into a deep puddle. Two of the Ju 88s were shot down by 134 Squadron, along with three probables and six damaged. Micky Rook, cousin of the 81 Squadron commander, joined a formation of 134 Squadron Hurricanes that turned out to be Bf 109s, shot one down and was chased home by the other five, evading them by flying past a destroyer off Murmansk at masthead height.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=179\u2013180}} The Germans built a new bridge over the Pechenga, a gargantuan enterprise; baulks of timber had to be hauled from a sawmill {{convert|120|mi|km|abbr=on}} away, lighter planks were shipped from [[Kirkenes]] and thousands of round logs were diverted from the stores of the nickel mines in Petsamo. The new [[Prince Eugene of Savoy|Prinz Eugen]] Bridge was completed in eleven days, two days early, an outstanding feat of engineering. On 9 October an Arctic gale brought deep snow and a steep drop in temperature, which halted all movement; porters got lost in the snowstorm and froze to death; negated the rebuilding of the bridge. With the bombing of the original bridge and the early winter, the Red Army was able to prevent the capture of Murmansk.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=171\u2013172, 180}}\n\n===10 October\u2013November===\n\n[[File:No. 151 Wing Royal Air Force Operations in Russia, September-november 1941. CR189.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Pilots of the Soviet Naval Aviation inspect the cockpit of an 81 Squadron Hurricane, under the supervision of an RAF pilot, during conversion training at Vaenga (CR189)}}]]\nOnce the winter freeze began, work parties with rollers flattened the runway into a mixture of frozen snow and sand; in the middle of the month, 151 Wing began to convert Russian pilots and ground crews to the Hurricane, most of the training being organised by Flight Lieutenant Ross of 134 Squadron. The success of the RAF pilots and their record of fifteen German aircraft for one Hurricane and no Soviet bomber losses, on the few days with flying weather, made converting to the type very popular among Russian pilots. After several landing mishaps and damage to wing tips and undercarriages, the Soviet pilots took more notice of RAF advice, especially after Safonov damaged his flaps. The Russian pilots were reluctant to raise the undercarriage during circuits and bumps or close the cockpit hood, until Kuznetsov threatened to ground any pilot caught disobeying orders.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=187\u2013192}}\n\nThe Russians took to keeping the hoods closed all the time, even when taxiing and raised the undercarriage as soon as they were airborne. Russian pilots tested their guns while on the ground but were persuaded to stop, when told that the gun barrels needed more cleaning and that patches over the gun ports had to be replaced. Some of the Soviet pilots confused ''maximum'' for ''normal'' and one pilot was surprised at running out of fuel while trying to fly to the maximum range of {{convert|750|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} at full throttle, writing off his aircraft.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=187\u2013192}} The engineering and wireless parts of the Wing remained busy training Russian students. Wireless technicians sometimes tried to modify the R/T transmitters, a practice which also had to be stamped out by Kuznetsov. Despite the need for interpreters, Soviet ground crews achieved an average pass mark of 80 percent, despite the engineering officer setting a high bar and marking severely.{{sfn|Golley|1987|p=201}}\n\nMost of the Russian pilots were experienced and took little time to convert. On 15 October, the aircraft of A Flight 81 Squadron were taken over by Soviet pilots who flew six sorties; on 19 October, the Hurricanes of 134 Squadron were handed over and on 22 October, the rest of the 81 Squadron Hurricanes were taken over. The VVS organised squadrons of twelve aircraft in sections of three. Aircraft had two ground crew and each section was overseen by an NCO mechanic. Two wireless technicians and one electrician were assigned to each squadron, which the RAF suggested was inadequate. On 26 October, the Russians shot down a Bf 110 in an ex-124 Squadron Hurricane, their first victory with the type; one Soviet Hurricane returned damaged.{{sfn|Harkins|2013|p=56}} By November, three Russian squadrons were operational and capable of training other students; the ground crews were competent in servicing and maintenance.{{sfn|Golley|1987|p=201}}\n\nIn the gloom of the Arctic winter, with the temperature plummeting to {{convert|-10|to|-15|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} and ink-wells freezing, little flying was possible. On 16 October there was an air raid by the ''Luftwaffe'' which did little damage and on 17 October, the wing flew three patrols. On 20 October, the last equipment was handed over to the VVS VMF, which left the flying personnel of 151 Wing with little to do. Two days' later, 151 Wing HQ took over the administration of the two squadrons, which made them defunct as operational units.{{sfn|Harkins|2013|p=55}} The pilots got hold of a [[Shooting-brake]] and used it to tow a sleigh at high speed, until several injuries led to the practice being stopped. Ramsbottom-Isherwood re-instituted route marches and rifle shooting, football and physical training until the temperature dropped to {{convert|-5|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}, too low for safety. The last outdoor activity was fitness training before breakfast for young officers but [[wind chill]] put an end to this in November.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=192\u2013194}}\n\n===Return to Britain===\n\n[[File:HMS KENYA IN THE ARCTIC CIRCLE.

When Ramsbottom-Isherwood took soundings from his Russian opposite numbers, it appeared that this might entail a rail journey of {{convert|2000|mi|km|abbr=on}}. Such a trek became even less encouraging when the Air Ministry signalled that the British Embassy and the Military and Air Mission were decamping for [[Samara]] (Kuybyshev 1935\u20131991) {{convert|500|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Moscow. During November, the prospect of a trans-continental journey receded and a sea journey from Murmansk to Britain was substituted. When the Navy sent a message to prepare to leave, little packing was necessary beyond personal effects, except for the Wing mascot, a young reindeer donated by Kuznetsov.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=193, 202\u2013204}} The cruiser {{HMS|Kenya|14|6}} arrived with [[Convoy PQ 3]] and took 151 Wing on board, departed and to the surprise of the RAF, bombarded Axis shore artillery at [[Vard\u00f8 (town)|Vard\u00f8]], in company with two British and two Soviet destroyers. Kenya returned to Murmansk and departed again on 27 November with [[Convoy QP 3]], the cruiser arriving at [[Rosyth]] in Scotland on 7 December.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|p=45}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n[[File:Order of Lenin badge with ribbon.png|thumb|upright=.5|{{centre|Order of Lenin}}]]\nOn the journey home, a wireless message to ''Kenya'' announced that on 27 November the [[Order of Lenin]] had been awarded to Ramsbotham-Isherwood, Rook, Miller and Flight Sergeant C. \"Wag\" Haw, who was the top-scoring pilot of the wing. When Kenya arrived at Rosyth, news also arrived of the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbour]]. The personnel of 151 Wing were sent on leave and the wing was disbanded, many of the members being surprised at the public interest shown in Operation Benedict. Film and photographs had been sent by the Russians, which the Air Ministry fed to the press and newsreels. Several men were even door-stepped by the local and national press; Haw was front-page news and the wing was also shown in Soviet newsreels. The four Orders of Lenin were the only ones awarded to Allies in the war; no British campaign medal was struck and the operation became a footnote in history.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=207\u2013208}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n'''Books'''\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Golley|1987}}\n|title=Hurricanes over Murmansk |last=Golley |first=J. |authorlink= |year=1987 |publisher=Patrick Stephens |edition=1st |location=Wellingborough |isbn=978-0-85059-832-2}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Harkins|2013}}\n|last=Harkins |first=H. |title=Hurricane IIB Combat Log: 151 Wing RAF North Russia 1941 |year=2013 |publisher=Centurion |location=Glasgow |isbn=978-1-903630-46-4}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Mellinger|2006}}\n|last=Mellinger |first=George |year=2006 |title=Soviet Lend-Lease Fighter Aces of World War 2 |publisher=Osprey |location=Oxford |isbn=978-1-84603041-3}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Richards|Saunders|1975}}\n|last1=Richards |first1=Denis |last2=St G.

The force comprised [[No. 151 Wing RAF|151 Wing]] [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), with two squadrons of [[Hawker Hurricane]] [[fighter aircraft|fighters]]. The wing flew against the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (German air force) and the ''[[Suomen Ilmavoimat]]'' (Finnish Air Force) from Vaenga (now [[Severomorsk]]) in northern [[USSR]] and train Soviet pilots and ground crews to operate the Hurricanes when their British pilots and ground crews returned to Britain.\n\nTwenty-four Hurricanes were delivered by [[Operation Strength (1941)|Operation Strength]], flying direct to Vaenga from the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Argus|I49|6}} but [[Operation Dervish (1941)|Operation Dervish]], the first Arctic convoy, was diverted from Murmansk to Archangelsk another {{convert|400|mi|km|abbr=on}} on. The fifteen crated Hurricanes for 151 Wing had to be assembled at Keg Ostrov airstrip. Despite primitive conditions, the Hurricanes were readied in nine days, with excellent co-operation from the Russian authorities; the aircraft flew to Vaenga on 12 September.\n\nIn five weeks of operations, 151 Wing claimed 16 victories, four probables and seven aircraft damaged. The winter snows began on 22 September and converting pilots and ground crews of [[Soviet Naval Aviation]] ({{lang|ru|Aviatsiya voyenno-morskogo flota}}) of the VVS to Hurricanes began in mid-October. The RAF party departed for Britain in late November, less various signals staff, arrived on 7 December and 151 Wing disbanded. The British and Russian governments gave Benedict much publicity and four members of 151 Wing received the [[Order of Lenin]].\n\n== Background ==\n\n===Diplomacy===\n\n{{main|Operation Barbarossa}}\n\nOn 22 June 1941, the [[Soviet Union]] was invaded by [[Nazi Germany]] and its allies. That evening, [[Winston Churchill]] broadcast a promise of assistance to the USSR against the common enemy. On 7 July, Churchill wrote to Stalin and ordered the British ambassador in Moscow, [[Stafford Cripps]], to begin discussions for a treaty of mutual assistance. On 12 July, an Anglo-Soviet Agreement was signed in Moscow, to fight together and not make a separate peace.{{sfn|Golley|1987|p=59}} On the same day a Soviet commission met the [[Royal Navy]] and the RAF in London and it was decided to use the airfield at [[Vaenga airfield|Vaenga]] (now [[Severomorsk]]) as a fighter base to defend ships while unloading at the ports of Murmansk, Arkhangelsk and [[Polyarny District|Polyarny]].{{sfn|Richards|Saunders|1975|p=78}} [[Ivan Maisky]], the Soviet ambassador in London since 1932, replied on 18 July that new fronts in northern France and the Arctic would improve the situation in the USSR.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|pp=8\u201315}}\n\nOperations in the Arctic were favoured by Stalin and Churchill, but the First Sea Lord, Admiral [[Dudley Pound]] considered such proposals unsound, \"with the dice loaded against us in every direction\". The [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and Churchill met at [[Placentia Bay]], [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] on 9 August and on 12 August communicated an assurance to Stalin that the western Allies were going to provide \"the very maximum of supplies\".{{sfn|Woodman|2004|pp=8\u201315}} A joint supply mission led by [[W. Averell Harriman]] and [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Max Aitken (Lord Beaverbrook)]] arrived at Archangelsk on 27 September and on 6 October, Churchill made a commitment to sail a convoy every ten days from Iceland to north Russia.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|pp=8\u201315}} When Arctic convoys passed by the north of Norway into the [[Barents Sea]], they came well into range of German aircraft, U-boats and ships operating from bases in Norway and Finland. The ports of arrival, especially Murmansk, only about {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of the front line were vulnerable to attack by the ''Luftwaffe''.{{sfn|Richards|Saunders|1975|p=78}}\n\n===151 Wing===\n\n{{main|No. 151 Wing RAF}}\n\nThe RAF contingent was to consist of two squadrons of [[Hawker Hurricane]]s and one squadron each of twin-engined [[Bristol Blenheim]]s and [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s. The Commander-in-Chief of the RAF [[Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford|Charles Portal]] decided on 25 July to send only [[No. 151 Wing RAF]] ([[Neville Ramsbottom-Isherwood]]) comprising [[No. 81 Squadron RAF|81 Squadron]] (Squadron Leader A. H. [Tony] Rook) and [[No. 134 Squadron RAF|134 Squadron]] (Squadron Leader A. G. [Tony] Miller), equipped with Hawker Hurricane Mk IIBs.{{sfn|Mellinger|2006|p=7}} A Flight of [[No. 504 Squadron RAF|504 Squadron]], based in Exeter, formed the nucleus of a new 81 Squadron and were sent on leave, to return to [[RAF Leconfield]] in Yorkshire or had just completed their training; two pilots of [[No. 615 Squadron RAF|615 Squadron]] who had deliberately failed a night fighter conversion course, were also posted to 151 Wing. The wing headquarters comprised about 350 administrative, signals, engineering, maintenance, transport, medical and non-technical staff and each squadron had a commanding officer, two flight commanders, at least thirty pilots and about 100 ground staff.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=73, 79, 87}} The wing was to be transported to north Russia in the first Arctic convoy and was to operate until the weather in October or November grounded the aircraft. During the winter lull, the fighters were to be handed over to the [[Soviet Air Forces]] (VVS, ''Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily'').{{sfn|Richards|Saunders|1975|p=78}} After several delays, a 151 Wing advance party of two officers and 23 men departed from Leconfield in mid-August.{{sfn|Golley|1987|p=81}}{{efn|81 Squadron Hurricanes: BD697, BD792, BD818, BD822, Z3746, Z3768, Z3977, Z4006, Z4017, Z4018, Z5107, Z5122, Z5157, Z5207, Z5208,Z5209, Z5227, Z5122 and Z5228; 134 Squadron machines: BD699, BD790, BD825, Z3763, Z3978, Z4012, Z4013, Z5120, Z5123, Z5134, Z5159, Z5205, Z5206, Z5210, Z5211, Z5226, Z5236, Z5253, Z5303 and Z5763.{{sfn|Harkins|2013|p=61}}}}\n\n===Voyage===\n\n{{main|Operation Dervish (1941)}}\n\n[[File:Hurricane.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Preserved Hurricane Mk IIB ''Z5140''}}]]\nThe Main Party, the majority of the 2,700 men of 151 Wing, including fourteen pilots was embarked on the troopship [[Landing ship, infantry|SS ''Llanstephan Castle'']] together with 15 Hurricanes packed in crates, at the [[Scapa Flow]] anchorage in the [[Orkney Islands]].{{sfn|Woodman|2004|pp=36\u201337}} The ships departed from Scapa Flow on 17 August 1941 with the Dervish Convoy and headed towards the [[Svalbard]] Archipelago and the [[midnight sun]], to circle as far north around Norway as possible. Also embarked were Vernon Bartlett MP, an American newspaper reporter Wallace Carrol, [[Feliks Topolski]], the Polish expressionist painter travelling as an official British and Polish [[war artist]], a Polish Legation, a Czechoslovak commission and [[Charlotte Haldane]] a noted feminist and member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], who lectured on ''Domestic life in Russia'' as part of an impromptu course laid on by the civilian passengers. The danger of ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' attacks on Murmansk led to the ships being diverted at Archangelsk, another {{convert|400|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the east. As the ''Llanstephan Castle'' sailed upriver to dock, rifle shots were heard and a member of the crew was hit in the arm, the gunfire coming from people onshore who mistook the British uniforms for German ones.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=82, 85\u201390}}\n\nThe ship anchored about {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the dock and workers began to build a wooden dock outwards towards them, a race against time before the waters froze; the passengers being surprised to find that most of the dockworkers were women. Ramsbottom-Isherwood had made a plan in case a British liaison party from Moscow failed to arrive and intended to use the 151 Wing transport to travel to Vaenga, only to be surprised to find that that no roads to Murmansk existed. The liaison party led by Air Vice-Marshal [[Basil Collier]] did arrive and discussions ensued as to the whereabouts of the Advance Party which had travelled ahead with equipment and stores. The pilots on ''Argus'' were due to arrive at Vaenga in a few days' time and he also needed the fifteen dismantled and crated Hurricanes carried by Dervish, to make up the wing complement of 39 Hurricanes. It had been intended to transport the wing by train but the Kandalaksha\u2013Murmansk railway had been bombed by the ''Luftwaffe''. A small party of signallers were sent to Keg Ostrov (island) airfield outside Arachangelsk and a party of 200 men with the wing commander were to travel by sea in the destroyers {{HMS|Electra|H27|6}} and {{HMS|Active|H14|2}} in two days' time. Two days later a group was to travel by tramp steamer to Kandalaksha, thence by train to Vaenga and two parties were to follow by rail, once the line had been repaired.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=90\u201393}}\n\n===Operation Strength===\n\n[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A12882.jpg|thumb|left|{{centre|HMS ''Argus'', photographed in 1942 during [[Operation Torch]] (A12882)}}]]\nTwenty-four aircraft and pilots went on board the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Argus|I49|6}} at [[Gourock]] near Glasgow and sailed for Scapa Flow. The departure of the ship was delayed for ten days and fears rose that the voyage would be cancelled but eventually ''Argus'' sailed, escorted by a cruiser and three destroyers.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|pp=36\u201337}} Much of the journey was in fog, only a marker from the ship in front being visible. The rum ration was appreciated and the pilots inspected the new Hurricane Mk IIB fighters, stored below decks minus their wings. The Hurricane pilots thought that the deck was rather short for taking off and took an interest in the two Martlet ([[Grumman F4F Wildcat]]) fighters kept at readiness. The weather remained unchanged as the carrier turned south for Russia but when the ship reached the departure point, it was dead calm and ''Argus'' had to sail in circles until the wind rose sufficiently. The Martlets had to be dismantled before the Hurricanes could be put on the flight deck six at a time; ''Argus'' would be steaming into wind at {{convert|17|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=94\u201396}}\n\nThe [[Fleet Air Arm]] aircrew briefed the pilots, to make sure that they rolled onto the ramp at the end of the flight deck, to get a shove into the air. To avoid problems with magnetic compasses at that latitude, one of the destroyers would point towards the coast and once three Hurricane pilots had formed a [[Vic formation|vic]], they were to line up along it and keep going until they reached the coast, then turn right for Vaenga, a few miles inland.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=94\u201396}} The squadron commanders briefed their pilots that 134 Squadron would take off first and that they were to keep a sharp lookout for German fighters but that they would carry only six of their twelve machine-guns to save weight. The first Hurricanes came up on the lift into a grey overcast day and the fight deck began to vibrate as the ship picked up speed into a light headwind and the Hurricane engines were started. Tony Miller, the 134 Squadron leader, went first, hit the ramp as suggested by the navy pilots and got airborne, despite the undercarriage being too damaged to retract. The other pilots saw that they would have to get airborne ''without'' hitting the ramp, because Hurricane undercarriages were not robust enough to use the method. Each vic assembled at about {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, flew along the destroyer guide and after about twenty minutes reached the coast and turned to starboard. Visibility was good and after about seventy minutes' flying, Vaenga was easy to see, as was the first Hurricane to land, which had come in wheels-up.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=96\u2013101}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Keg Ostrov===\n\nThe first men off ''Llanstephen Castle'' were mostly the R/T personnel needed at Vaenga to communicate with the Hurricanes when they arrived from ''Argus''. The men were flown from Keg Ostrov on successive days, the first flight being routine. On the second day the aircraft was intercepted by German aircraft and had to run for home, fortunate that German aircraft were at the limit of their range and could not pursue; the pilot tried again next day and reached Vaenga. A group of about 200 men sailed on the two destroyers and reached Murmansk in 22 hours but missed a Russian destroyer which was supposed to guide them into port through the minefields; the captain used the [[Sonar|Asdic]] set instead and docked safely. On 28 August, the men at Archangelsk formed an Erection Party (sic) of 36 men under the engineer-officer Flt/Lt Gittins and Warrant Officer Hards. The men went by boat to Keg Ostrov and found fifteen crates on a mud flat near the hangars. One crate was emptied to accommodate the wireless section and then the men found that some types of specialist tools had been omitted from the maintenance kits but that tropical insulation covers for the engines had been included. A Russian engineer officer improvised airscrew and spark-plug spanners in the airfield workshop and later built proper engine covers, with a trunk underneath for a \"hot air lorry\" to boost the temperature of the engine.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=103\u2013105}}\n\nAt {{nowrap|1:30 p.m.}} the second Hurricane was extracted from its packing case and at {{nowrap|3:30 p.m.}} was pushed into a hangar, followed by a third at {{nowrap|6:30 p.m.}} by when the [[Wireless telegraphy|WT]] station was operational. Due to a lack of lifting gear work stopped soon after and the British were accommodated on a paddleboat that looked like a Mississippi steamer. The main problem in re-assembling the aircraft was a lack of lifting gear for un-crating, jacking-up, lowering onto the undercarriage, adding the wings tail unit, then arming, fuelling and air testing. Next day, the Russians provided three {{convert|1000|kg|lb|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} cranes, which had to be wound by hand to jack up the aircraft. By the evening of the second day, two Hurricanes had their wings on and as it had begun to rain, no more Hurricanes were unpacked. The men were split into three groups, to concentrate on fitting wings and tail units of the ones already out. The British worked thirteen-hour days and were surprised by the lavish Russian hospitality compared with the rations at home, which manifested in stomach upsets (the ''grumbleguts''); a doctor was sent up from ''Llanstephen Castle''. By afternoon, five aircraft had been assembled and pushed into the hangar. The Main Party on the troopship were still cooped up but parties going ashore were required to be armed in case the locals took them for Germans. When the final assembly of the first Hurricane was complete on the fifth day, an engine test was run at {{nowrap|8:37 p.m.}} in front of a throng of dignitaries and spectators.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=105\u2013109}}\n\nOn the sixth day, three Hurricanes were prepared for air tests, which attracted more dignitaries including admirals of the navy and naval air force. The local military forces and anti-aircraft units were notified and then the Hurricane pilots put on as much of a show as the low cloud base allowed, mainly tight turns and low-level passes. Next day engineers arrived from Moscow to discuss the fuel to be used in the Hurricanes, Soviet aircraft still using 87-octane rather than the 100-octane of the British machines. Henry Broquet worked with the engineers to make the local fuel compatible with the Merlin engine, which led to the development of a tin catalyst which improved combustion efficiency.{{sfn|Broquet|1999|pp=1\u20132}} In the evening the British had some English food for a change and by the ninth day, all fifteen aircraft were ready and had improved the morale of the Archangelsk residents who had seen them perform.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=109\u2013110}} The aircraft were flown the {{convert|300|mi|km|abbr=on}} to Vaenga on 12 September, guided by a Russian bomber, with the cloud base up to {{convert|6000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The formation flew over the White Sea, exchanging recognition signals with Russian ships and landed safely at Vaenga, just as the Hurricanes from ''Argus'' returned from a sortie.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=131\u2013132}} Two Hurricanes, whose pilots succumbed to Russian hospitality at a refuelling stop, were late, having to continue the morning after.{{sfn|Richards|Saunders|1975|p=78}}\n\n===Vaenga airfield===\n\n{{main|Murmansk Oblast|Severomorsk}}\n\n [[File:Polikarpov I-16-Spain (clipped).jpg|thumb|{{centre|Modern example of a Polikarpov I-16}}]]\nVaenga (now Severomorsk) airfield was the base of the 72nd SAP-SF (Composite Aviation Regiment-Northern Fleet) commanded by Colonel Georgii Gubanov, part of the Northern Fleet Air Force (Major-General [[A. A. Kuznetsov]]) of the Naval Air Fleet. The 4th Squadron of the 72 SAP-SF (Captain [[Boris Safonov]]), flying [[Polikarpov I-16]] fighters, was also based at Vaenga.{{sfn|Mellinger|2006|p=8}} The airfield had an adequate surface of compacted sand, a large oval about {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} long, on its east-west axis. The airfield was in a bowl surrounded by hillocks and woods and was found to get very very bumpy in wet weather.{{sfn|Golley|1987|p=100}} The front line was about {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the west and the airfield facilities were almost invisible, being well dispersed, dug in and camouflaged among the hillocks and growths of silver birch. There was a tarmac road about {{convert|1|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} long along which lay buildings but there were only cart tracks and paths linking the buildings and huts.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=113\u2013114, 142}}\n\nThe airfield was under occasional attack by the ''Luftwaffe'' and Russian soldiers guarded the airfield from positions in the woods around the perimeter.{{sfn|Golley|1987|p=142}} With the autumn rains and the number of lorries driving people to and fro, the tracks quickly became potholed. The aircraft hangars were part-buried for camouflage but had been built for the Polikarpov I-16s and were too narrow for the Hurricanes; Russian workers appeared to widen them, working-non-stop until the enlargement was complete.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=113\u2013114}} Accommodation was in brick buildings and wooden huts, the huts being found to be unkempt, some infested with lice. The bedding was new, the food was ample, though some considered it to be a little greasy and the sanitation was hideous, leading to the British naming the main latrine, directly over a cesspit, \"The Kremlin\". Co-operation from the Russians was excellent and Isherwood established rapport with the Soviet commanding general and arranged bomber escort tactics with the local air commanders.{{sfn|Richards|Saunders|1975|pp=78\u201380}}\n\n==151 Wing operations==\n\n===11 September===\n\n[[File:Fisher Peninsula.svg|thumb|{{centre|Map showing the Rybachy Peninsula (also Fisherman's Island)}}]]\nThe Arctic autumn was cold but the air was dry, not like the damp cold of England. On 11 September, the first operation was flown, a familiarisation flight to learn the local geography and to test their guns. There was good visibility among broken clouds and the formation flew at {{convert|3500|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The pilots studied the [[Rybachy Peninsula]] and Murmansk then flew towards the south, to avoid [[Petsamo, Finland|Petsamo]] to the west. Without the ground radar control available in Britain. The pilots would have to navigate for themselves but there was a pleasing lack of mountains and it was a simple matter to fly north to follow the coast home or west to reach the [[Kola Bay|Kola Inlet]]. There were a few flurries of snow during the evening but the Russians assured the British that the real winter snows would not begin until late September \u2013 early October. The last Hurricanes to be assembled were still at Keg Ostrov, the engines had to be adjusted to fly on [[Avgas|87-octane]] fuel and a shortage of [[Sear (firearm)|sears]], necessary to trigger the guns, meant only six per aircraft instead of the twelve usually carried.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=115\u2013117}}\n\n===12\u201313 September===\n\n[[File:Henschel Hs 126 (15247029576).jpg|thumb|{{centre|A Henschel Hs 126 reconnaissance aircraft of the type shot down on 12 September (15247029576)}}]]\nOn 12 September, three Hurricanes of 134 Squadron carried out the inaugural patrol of 151 Wing; in good visibility the Hurricane pilots saw German bombers but were not able to make contact. The second patrol was flown by two Hurricanes of 81 Squadron, which damaged a Me 110 and later on, 134 Squadron escorted two uneventful Soviet bomber sorties.{{sfn|Golley|1987|p=118}} Five Hurricanes of 81 Squadron at readiness were [[Scrambling (military)|scramble]] and flew westwards at {{convert|5000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Midway between Murmansk and the coast, the pilots looked for Russian anti-aircraft fire, to indicate the location of the German aircraft. After a few minutes, the pilots saw flak bursts and saw a formation of a [[Henschel Hs 126]] reconnaissance aircraft with five [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]E escorts from Petsamo, flying from left to right. Unexpectedly, the Bf 109s turned away as the Hurricanes attacked. Three of the Bf 109s were confirmed shot down and the Henschel, hit in the engine and seen leaving a plume of smoke was recorded as a probable, for a loss of one pilot (Sergeant \"Nudger\" Smith) and his Hurricane. Later in the afternoon, aircraft of 134 Squadron went on patrol and attacked a formation of three German bombers and four Bf 109s heading for Archangelsk; the Germans saw the Hurricanes, jettisoned their bombs and turned for home before the Hurricanes could attack.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=119\u2013133}}\n\n===14\u201327 September===\n\n[[File:Petlyakov Pe-2 Peshka (Pawn) (14467132393).jpg|thumb|{{centre|Petlyakov Pe-2 ''Peshka'' (Pawn) (14467132393)}}]]\n\"Nudger\" Smith was buried on 14 September at a village overlooking the Kola Inlet. On 17 September 81 Squadron was to escort Soviet bombers but German aircraft were reported near the Kola Inlet and the squadron was scrambled and climbed to {{convert|5000|ft|m|abbr=on}} below low cloud. Without warning, the Hurricanes were bounced by Bf 109s, one of which missed a Hurricane, overshot and was promptly shot down, as were three more by other pilots, for no loss. One patrol was flown on 19 September in poor misty weather and next day, two patrols were flown in similar weather. The first real snow fell on 22 September for about ten minutes, leaving a clear sky then began again, leaving the aircraft dispersals and the sand runway full of puddles. Next morning was fine and 81 Squadron escorted [[Petlyakov Pe-2]] light bombers raiding a target in Norway, the Hurricane pilots finding it necessary to fly very fast to keep up. Weather forecasters said that now that the snow had come, the British could expect about six days' decent weather a month.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=144, 151\u2013157, 160\u2013163}}\n\nOn 25 September, the weather improved in the afternoon and Kuznetsov made his first flight in a Hurricane. Bomber escort missions would continue but in second place to the programme to convert Russian pilots and ground crews to the British fighter. On the same day, 81 Squadron was briefed to escort bombers and dive-bombers who were to attack German ground troops near Petsamo; A Flight would cover the dive-bombers and B Flight the medium bombers. A Flight made a formation take-off and then the Pe-2 dive-bombers from a nearby airstrip, followed by B Flight and then the Pe-2 FTs, the Hurricanes flying {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the bombers. The flight to the target and the bombing was uneventful but soon after turning for home, B Flight was bounced by six Bf 109s, three of which were shot down for no loss. The weather on 27 September was very good with some high cloud and 81 Squadron took off again to escort Russian bombers and shot down two more Bf 109s. On the other side of the airfield, 134 Squadron had flown a similar number of patrols and escort sorties but had not been in action against any German aircraft. Around noon, a [[Junkers Ju 88]] flew over Vaenga and 134 Squadron was scrambled. The ground was so wet that the pilots needed a lot of throttle to move and two airmen per aircraft hung over the back of the fuselage to keep the tail down. When the Ju 88 appeared, Flight Lieutenant Vic Berg tried to take off before the airmen had alighted from the tail. when Berg took off the Hurricane rose vertically for about {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}}, then dived into the ground, the two airmen on the back being killed and Berg receiving severe leg injuries.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=164\u2013169}}\n\n===28\u201330 September===\n\n[[File:Silberfuchs-plan.png|left|thumb|{{centre|Map showing the German advance and positions of the 2nd and 3rd Mountain divisions}}]]\nA bomber raid on a {{convert|100|yd|m|abbr=on}} bridge over the [[Pechenga River]] was planned for 28 September. A road the length of the Rybachy Peninsula to the Gulf of Bothnia on the Baltic Sea ran parallel to the river and the bridge was on the only supply route to the German [[2nd Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd]] and [[3rd Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|3rd Mountain]] divisions. The bridge was defended by a large quantity of Flak which rose up at the Pe-2s as they dived to drop their {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bombs. The water smoke and soil thrown up made it impossible to see if the bridge had been hit. As the aircraft flew home, two of the British pilots put on an exhibition of close formation flying for the Russian bomber crews.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=169\u2013170}}\n\nNot long after the aircraft turned for home the {{convert|1500|yd|m|abbr=on}} of ground between the river and the road slipped into the river valley and buried the bridge. With the river blocked, the waters rose and flooded the road, stranding about 15,000 German troops, 7,000 horses and thousands of motor vehicles. The [[6th Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|6th Mountain Division]] had to be diverted to Parkkina for rescue work. Engineers had to dig channels through the earth blocking the river to lower its depth for footbridges to be built to manhandle supplies to the isolated troops. That evening, the rum ration [{{convert|0.5|impgi|ml}}] commenced, as a means to alleviate the cold.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=169\u2013170, 172\u2013173}}{{efn|While the Hurricanes were escorting the bombers, Ramsbottom-Isherwood had to decide what to do with Corporal Flockhart, who it was discovered, had sneaked off and flown as an air-gunner in a Russian bomber. Not catered for in [[Queen's Regulations|King's Regulations]], Ramsbottom-Isherwood told him \"Personally, I admire your spirit. Personally, I think it's a bloody good show. But all the same, if you had got shot down you'd have put me in the soup, see? Now get out!\".{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=171\u2013172}}}}\n\n===1\u20139 October===\nIn October, there were far fewer flying days and only air tests and local flights were possible, between showers of rain and sleet. On 7 October, the weather cleared, with a high cloud base and good visibility and fourteen Ju 88s with six Bf 109 escorts attacked the airfield in the middle of the afternoon. Some of the Hurricanes were airborne before the attack and others, at readiness, scrambled along with other pilots near machines when the alarm sounded. One pilot, \"Scotty\" Edmiston was stopped by a bomb exploding in front of the Hurricane which stopped the engine; as Edmiston climbed out, another bomb blew him into a deep puddle. Two of the Ju 88s were shot down by 134 Squadron, along with three probables and six damaged. Micky Rook, cousin of the 81 Squadron commander, joined a formation of 134 Squadron Hurricanes that turned out to be Bf 109s, shot one down and was chased home by the other five, evading them by flying past a destroyer off Murmansk at masthead height.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=179\u2013180}} The Germans built a new bridge over the Pechenga, a gargantuan enterprise; baulks of timber had to be hauled from a sawmill {{convert|120|mi|km|abbr=on}} away, lighter planks were shipped from [[Kirkenes]] and thousands of round logs were diverted from the stores of the nickel mines in Petsamo. The new [[Prince Eugene of Savoy|Prinz Eugen]] Bridge was completed in eleven days, two days early, an outstanding feat of engineering. On 9 October an Arctic gale brought deep snow and a steep drop in temperature, which halted all movement; porters got lost in the snowstorm and froze to death; negated the rebuilding of the bridge. With the bombing of the original bridge and the early winter, the Red Army was able to prevent the capture of Murmansk.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=171\u2013172, 180}}\n\n===10 October\u2013November===\n\n[[File:No. 151 Wing Royal Air Force Operations in Russia, September-november 1941. CR189.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Pilots of the Soviet Naval Aviation inspect the cockpit of an 81 Squadron Hurricane, under the supervision of an RAF pilot, during conversion training at Vaenga (CR189)}}]]\nOnce the winter freeze began, work parties with rollers flattened the runway into a mixture of frozen snow and sand; in the middle of the month, 151 Wing began to convert Russian pilots and ground crews to the Hurricane, most of the training being organised by Flight Lieutenant Ross of 134 Squadron. The success of the RAF pilots and their record of fifteen German aircraft for one Hurricane and no Soviet bomber losses, on the few days with flying weather, made converting to the type very popular among Russian pilots. After several landing mishaps and damage to wing tips and undercarriages, the Soviet pilots took more notice of RAF advice, especially after Safonov damaged his flaps. The Russian pilots were reluctant to raise the undercarriage during circuits and bumps or close the cockpit hood, until Kuznetsov threatened to ground any pilot caught disobeying orders.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=187\u2013192}}\n\nThe Russians took to keeping the hoods closed all the time, even when taxiing and raised the undercarriage as soon as they were airborne. Russian pilots tested their guns while on the ground but were persuaded to stop, when told that the gun barrels needed more cleaning and that patches over the gun ports had to be replaced. Some of the Soviet pilots confused ''maximum'' for ''normal'' and one pilot was surprised at running out of fuel while trying to fly to the maximum range of {{convert|750|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} at full throttle, writing off his aircraft.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=187\u2013192}} The engineering and wireless parts of the Wing remained busy training Russian students. Wireless technicians sometimes tried to modify the R/T transmitters, a practice which also had to be stamped out by Kuznetsov. Despite the need for interpreters, Soviet ground crews achieved an average pass mark of 80 percent, despite the engineering officer setting a high bar and marking severely.{{sfn|Golley|1987|p=201}}\n\nMost of the Russian pilots were experienced and took little time to convert. On 15 October, the aircraft of A Flight 81 Squadron were taken over by Soviet pilots who flew six sorties; on 19 October, the Hurricanes of 134 Squadron were handed over and on 22 October, the rest of the 81 Squadron Hurricanes were taken over. The VVS organised squadrons of twelve aircraft in sections of three. Aircraft had two ground crew and each section was overseen by an NCO mechanic. Two wireless technicians and one electrician were assigned to each squadron, which the RAF suggested was inadequate. On 26 October, the Russians shot down a Bf 110 in an ex-124 Squadron Hurricane, their first victory with the type; one Soviet Hurricane returned damaged.{{sfn|Harkins|2013|p=56}} By November, three Russian squadrons were operational and capable of training other students; the ground crews were competent in servicing and maintenance.{{sfn|Golley|1987|p=201}}\n\nIn the gloom of the Arctic winter, with the temperature plummeting to {{convert|-10|to|-15|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} and ink-wells freezing, little flying was possible. On 16 October there was an air raid by the ''Luftwaffe'' which did little damage and on 17 October, the wing flew three patrols. On 20 October, the last equipment was handed over to the VVS VMF, which left the flying personnel of 151 Wing with little to do. Two days' later, 151 Wing HQ took over the administration of the two squadrons, which made them defunct as operational units.{{sfn|Harkins|2013|p=55}} The pilots got hold of a [[Shooting-brake]] and used it to tow a sleigh at high speed, until several injuries led to the practice being stopped. Ramsbottom-Isherwood re-instituted route marches and rifle shooting, football and physical training until the temperature dropped to {{convert|-5|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}, too low for safety. The last outdoor activity was fitness training before breakfast for young officers but [[wind chill]] put an end to this in November.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=192\u2013194}}\n\n===Return to Britain===\n\n[[File:HMS KENYA IN THE ARCTIC CIRCLE. MAY 1942. A9223.jpg|thumb|{{centre|HMS ''Kenya'' in the Arctic Ocean, May 1942 (A9223)}}]]\nIn October it had seemed as though 151 Wing was to move on to the Middle East, according to signals from the [[Air Ministry]]. When Ramsbottom-Isherwood took soundings from his Russian opposite numbers, it appeared that this might entail a rail journey of {{convert|2000|mi|km|abbr=on}}. Such a trek became even less encouraging when the Air Ministry signalled that the British Embassy and the Military and Air Mission were decamping for [[Samara]] (Kuybyshev 1935\u20131991) {{convert|500|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Moscow. During November, the prospect of a trans-continental journey receded and a sea journey from Murmansk to Britain was substituted. When the Navy sent a message to prepare to leave, little packing was necessary beyond personal effects, except for the Wing mascot, a young reindeer donated by Kuznetsov.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=193, 202\u2013204}} The cruiser {{HMS|Kenya|14|6}} arrived with [[Convoy PQ 3]] and took 151 Wing on board, departed and to the surprise of the RAF, bombarded Axis shore artillery at [[Vard\u00f8 (town)|Vard\u00f8]], in company with two British and two Soviet destroyers. Kenya returned to Murmansk and departed again on 27 November with [[Convoy QP 3]], the cruiser arriving at [[Rosyth]] in Scotland on 7 December.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|p=45}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n[[File:Order of Lenin badge with ribbon.png|thumb|upright=.5|{{centre|Order of Lenin}}]]\nOn the journey home, a wireless message to ''Kenya'' announced that on 27 November the [[Order of Lenin]] had been awarded to Ramsbotham-Isherwood, Rook, Miller and Flight Sergeant C. \"Wag\" Haw, who was the top-scoring pilot of the wing. When Kenya arrived at Rosyth, news also arrived of the Japanese [[Attack on Pearl Harbour]]. The personnel of 151 Wing were sent on leave and the wing was disbanded, many of the members being surprised at the public interest shown in Operation Benedict. Film and photographs had been sent by the Russians, which the Air Ministry fed to the press and newsreels. Several men were even door-stepped by the local and national press; Haw was front-page news and the wing was also shown in Soviet newsreels. The four Orders of Lenin were the only ones awarded to Allies in the war; no British campaign medal was struck and the operation became a footnote in history.{{sfn|Golley|1987|pp=207\u2013208}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n'''Books'''\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Golley|1987}}\n|title=Hurricanes over Murmansk |last=Golley |first=J. |authorlink= |year=1987 |publisher=Patrick Stephens |edition=1st |location=Wellingborough |isbn=978-0-85059-832-2}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Harkins|2013}}\n|last=Harkins |first=H. |title=Hurricane IIB Combat Log: 151 Wing RAF North Russia 1941 |year=2013 |publisher=Centurion |location=Glasgow |isbn=978-1-903630-46-4}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Mellinger|2006}}\n|last=Mellinger |first=George |year=2006 |title=Soviet Lend-Lease Fighter Aces of World War 2 |publisher=Osprey |location=Oxford |isbn=978-1-84603041-3}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Richards|Saunders|1975}}\n|last1=Richards |first1=Denis |last2=St G.

The team was founded in 1976 by former [[Brabham]] mechanic [[Ron Dennis]]. At the end of 1980, the team merged with the [[McLaren]] [[Formula One]] team.\n\nThe team name lived on in the designation of the McLaren F1 race cars from {{f1|1981}} to the {{f1|2016}} season, all McLarens, starting with the [[John Barnard]] designed [[McLaren MP4/1]], had carried the \"MP4\" name. MP4 standing for \"Marlboro Project 4\" and later \"McLaren Project 4\". From {{f1|2017}} onward, after the departure of Dennis from McLaren, the team began to designate their cars with the name \"MCL\".<ref>{{cite web|title=McLaren on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/McLarenF1/status/827479893940248577|website=Twitter|accessdate=3 February 2017|ref=McLarenMCL|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Racing history==\n\n===Formula Two===\nThe team competed in the [[European Formula Two Championship]]. Driving a [[BMW in motorsport|BMW]] powered [[Ralt RT1]], [[Eddie Cheever]] recorded the team's first race win in [[1977 European Formula Two season|1977]] in the second of two races making up Round 4 at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] on his way to finishing second for the round. Cheever then went on to win Round 8 at the [[Rouen-Les-Essarts]] circuit. He finished the season in second place, 12 points behind [[Ren\u00e9 Arnoux]].\n\nOver the next three seasons, Project Four would win just four more races before the team moved into Formula One with its last win coming thanks to [[Andrea de Cesaris]] who won Round 8 of the [[1980 European Formula Two season|1980 season]] at [[Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli|Misano]] in [[Italy]] driving a [[March Engineering|March 802]]-BMW.\n\n===Formula Three===\nProject Four also raced in the [[British Formula 3 Championship]]. Its first win came thanks to [[Chico Serra]] who won the opening round of the [[1979 British Formula 3 season|1979 championship]] on [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]]'s Club Circuit driving a [[Toyota Motorsport GmbH|Toyota]] powered March 793. Serra won five of the seasons twenty races to win the championship from Andrea de Cesaris who drove a March 793-Toyota for [[Tiga Race Cars|Tiga]].\n\n=== BMW M1 Procar Championship ===\nFor the [[BMW M1 Procar Championship]], all cars were built to identical standards, although their origins varied. [[BS Fabrications]] constructed five cars for the BMW factory team, while cars for other competitors were constructed by Project Four Racing or the Italian constructor [[Osella]]. The racing cars, designed to meet Group 4 technical regulations, shared only some basics from the M1 road cars.\n\nIn 1979, Procar constructor Project Four entered a car for [[Niki Lauda]] when he was not in the factory entries. Lauda won 3 races for P4, and the series, before retiring from F1 racing in late September. In 1980, [[Hans-Joachim Stuck]] won two events for P4, finishing 3rd overall.\n\n==Complete European Formula Two results==\n([[:Template:Motorsport driver results legend|key]]) (Results in '''bold''' indicate pole position; results in ''italics'' indicate fastest lap.)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%\"\n!

The team was founded in 1976 by former [[Brabham]] mechanic [[Ron Dennis]]. At the end of 1980, the team merged with the [[McLaren]] [[Formula One]] team.\n\nThe team name lived on in the designation of the McLaren F1 race cars from {{f1|1981}} to the {{f1|2016}} season, all McLarens, starting with the [[John Barnard]] designed [[McLaren MP4/1]], had carried the \"MP4\" name. MP4 standing for \"Marlboro Project 4\" and later \"McLaren Project 4\". From {{f1|2017}} onward, after the departure of Dennis from McLaren, the team began to designate their cars with the name \"MCL\".<ref>{{cite web|title=McLaren on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/McLarenF1/status/827479893940248577|website=Twitter|accessdate=3 February 2017|ref=McLarenMCL|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Racing history==\n\n===Formula Two===\nThe team competed in the [[European Formula Two Championship]]. Driving a [[BMW in motorsport|BMW]] powered [[Ralt RT1]], [[Eddie Cheever]] recorded the teams first race win in [[1977 European Formula Two season|1977]] in the second of two races making up Round 4 at the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] on his way to finishing second for the round. Cheever then went on to win Round 8 at the [[Rouen-Les-Essarts]] circuit. He finished the season in second place, 12 points behind [[Ren\u00e9 Arnoux]].\n\nOver the next three seasons, Project Four would win just four more races before the team moved into Formula One with its last win coming thanks to [[Andrea de Cesaris]] who won Round 8 of the [[1980 European Formula Two season|1980 season]] at [[Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli|Misano]] in [[Italy]] driving a [[March Engineering|March 802]]-BMW.\n\n===Formula Three===\nProject Four also raced in the [[British Formula 3 Championship]]. Its first win came thanks to [[Chico Serra]] who won the opening round of the [[1979 British Formula 3 season|1979 championship]] on [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]]'s Club Circuit driving a [[Toyota Motorsport GmbH|Toyota]] powered March 793. Serra won five of the seasons twenty races to win the championship from Andrea de Cesaris who drove a March 793-Toyota for [[Tiga Race Cars|Tiga]].\n\n=== BMW M1 Procar Championship ===\nFor the [[BMW M1 Procar Championship]], all cars were built to identical standards, although their origins varied. [[BS Fabrications]] constructed five cars for the BMW factory team, while cars for other competitors were constructed by Project Four Racing or the Italian constructor [[Osella]]. The racing cars, designed to meet Group 4 technical regulations, shared only some basics from the M1 road cars.\n\nIn 1979, Procar constructor Project Four entered a car for [[Niki Lauda]] when he was not in the factory entries. Lauda won 3 races for P4, and the series, before retiring from F1 racing in late September. In 1980, [[Hans-Joachim Stuck]] won two events for P4, finishing 3rd overall.\n\n==Complete European Formula Two results==\n([[:Template:Motorsport driver results legend|key]]) (Results in '''bold''' indicate pole position; results in ''italics'' indicate fastest lap.)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%\"\n!

{"title_page": "Justice delayed is justice denied", "text_new": "{{short description|Legal maxim}}\n'''\"Justice delayed is justice denied\"''' is a [[legal maxim]] meaning that if [[Legal remedy|legal redress]] is available for a party that has suffered some injury, but is not forthcoming in a timely fashion, it is effectively the same as having no redress at all. This principle is the basis for the right to a [[speedy trial]] and similar rights which are meant to expedite the legal system, because it is unfair for the injured party to have to sustain the injury with little hope for resolution. The phrase has become a rallying cry for [[law reform|legal reformers]] who view [[court]]s or [[government]]s as acting too slowly in resolving legal issues either because the existing system is too complex or overburdened, or because the issue or party in question lacks political favour.\n\n==Origin==\nThere are conflicting accounts of who first noted the phrase.

This suggest that the rearrangements took place at a time that both parental copies of the [[chromosome]] were present and hence early on the development of the [[cancer]] cell. This also supports the fact that chromothripsis occurs as one catastrophic event in the cells history as once heterozygosity is lost it generally can't be regained and hence the 2 copy heterozygous state occurring in patches throughout the chromothriptic region is hard to explain.<ref name=\"Maher, Wilson 2012\"/><ref name=\"NRC 2012\"/><ref name=\"Korbel, Campbell 2013\"/>\n*Recently, several additional criteria for the inference of chromothripsis events have been described: clustering of chromosomal breakpoints; prevalence of rearrangements affecting a single haplotype; randomness of fragment joins (that is an approximately equal distribution of tail-to-head, head-to-tail, head-to-head and tail-to-tail segmental connections occurring in conjunction with chromothripsis); and randomness of DNA fragment order along resultant derivative chromosome.<ref name=\"Korbel, Campbell 2013\"/> Furthermore, if all DNA rearrangements in a region with chromothripsis are detectable, the relative order in which segments are joined can be reconstructed and chromothripsis events identified through \"derivative chromosome walks\".<ref name=\"Korbel, Campbell 2013\"/>\n\n==Breakage and repair of chromosomes==\n[[File:Non homologous end joining and microhomology mediated end joining.png|400px|thumb|Non homologous end joining and Microhomology mediated end joining]]\nThe most widely accepted and straightforward model for chromothripsis is that within a single chromosome, distinct [[chromosomal region]]s become fragmented/shattered almost simultaneously and subsequently rejoined in an incorrect orientation. [[deletion (genetics)|Deletion]] of certain fragments, including deletions that are a few hundred [[base pair|base pairs long]], and hence gene segments is possible and consequently the production of [[double minute|double minute chromosomes]].<ref name=\"Stephens2011\"/> When multiple [[chromosome]]s are involved in chromothripsis, fragments of both chromosomes are joined together by paired end joining and the exchange of fragments between the original chromosomes.<ref name=\"NRC 2012\"/>\n\nRejoining of fragments require very minimal or even no sequence [[Homology (biology)|homology]] and consequently suggesting that nonhomologous or microhomologous repair mechanisms  such as [[non-homologous end joining]] (NHEJ) and [[microhomology-mediated end joining|microhomology-mediated break induced repair]] (MMBIR) dominate [[double-strand break|double stranded break]] repair and are involved in modelling the chromothriptic landscape, opposed to [[homologous recombination]] which requires [[sequence homology]]. Joining of fragments and rearrangements have also been shown to take place on paternal chromosomes.<ref name=\"Kloosterman2011\"/>\n\nAs well as in [[cancer cell]]s, chromothripsis has also be reported in patients with developmental and [[congenital disorder|congenital defects]], i.e. [[germ cell|germ line cells]]. Using multiple molecular techniques of these germ line cells that have appeared to have undergone a chromothripsis like process, as well as [[chromosomal inversion|inversions]] and [[chromosomal translocation|translocations]], [[gene duplication|duplications]] and triplications were also seen and hence increases in [[copy-number variation|copy number]].

It is the first [[sequel]] to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the second film in the [[Psycho (franchise)|''Psycho'' franchise]]. Set 22 years after the first film, it follows [[Norman Bates]] after he is released from the mental institution and returns to the house and Bates Motel to continue a normal life. However, his troubled past continues to haunt him. It is unrelated to the 1982 novel ''[[Psycho II (novel)|Psycho II]]'' by [[Robert Bloch]], which he wrote as a sequel to his original novel ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]''.\n\nIn preparing the film, Universal hired Holland to write an entirely different screenplay, while Australian director Franklin, a one-time student of Hitchcock, was hired to direct. The film marked Franklins's American feature film debut.<ref name=afi/> Released on June 3, 1983, ''Psycho II'' grossed $34.7 million at the box office on a budget of $5 million.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=June 3, 2018|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho2.htm|title=Psycho II}}</ref> The film was followed by ''[[Psycho III]]'' (1986).\n\n==Plot==\nAfter 22 years in a mental institution, [[Norman Bates]] has been cured of his insanity and accepted that his mother is dead. As such, the court has him released. Marion's sister Lila, who married Marion's lover Sam Loomis, vehemently protests, but her plea is dismissed. Against the advice of Dr. Bill Raymond, Norman takes up residence in his old home behind the Bates Motel. He reports to a prearranged job at a nearby diner, where an old lady named [[Emma Spool]] works. After work, a young waitress at the diner, Mary Samuels, has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey, has been using the motel for dealing drugs. He immediately fires Toomey.\n\nNorman's assimilation into society appears to be going well until he begins to receive mysterious phone calls and notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. During a work shift, a drunk Toomey picks a fight with Norman, and he suspects him of the notes and phone calls. Shortly after, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death as he is packing to leave the motel.\n \nBecoming increasingly sympathetic to and impressed by Norman's fight to keep his sanity, Mary takes up permanent residence in a guest room at his house. While Norman is renovating his motel, he hears voices in the house, and enters his mother's bedroom to find it exactly as it was 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Meanwhile, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window to have sex. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts police. Mary finds Norman in the attic and he shows her his mother's bedroom, only to find it back to its state of disuse. The sheriff arrives and questions them about the boy's murder. Mary claims they were out walking together at the time. After the sheriff leaves, Norman rebukes her for lying. He fears he may have killed the boy, since Mary told him the attic was unlocked when she found him.\n\nThat evening, Mary and Norman find a bloody rag stuffed in the toilet. Norman is horrified, believing he committed another murder, but Mary insists he is innocent. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, her mother; Lila and Mary have in fact been making the phone calls and notes, even posing at the window dressed as Norma Bates. Mary altered Norman's room and locked Norman in the attic so she could change it back. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted. However, Mary's growing friendship with Norman has convinced her he is no longer capable of killing. She suspects someone else is in the house, pointing out that Norman was locked in the attic at the time of the boy's death.\n\nDr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and tells Norman that Mary and Lila must be the ones harassing him. He also has the corpse of Norma Bates exhumed, to prove Norman is not being haunted by his mother. Norman is only partially convinced, saying the one behind everything must be his \"real mother\", despite there being no record of him being adopted. Norman confronts Mary with what Dr. Raymond told him. She says that she has given up her part in Lila's ruse, but Lila will not stop. Later, Norman becomes too terrified to leave his room, saying he saw his real mother in the house. Mary admits to Norman that his sanity is beginning to erode and stays to comfort him.\n\nWhile Lila is retrieving her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the cellar floor, a figure steps out of the shadows and murders her. Meanwhile, the police dredge the swamp and find a car, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Mary runs to the house to try to convince Norman to flee. The phone rings, Norman answers, and starts speaking to \"Mother\". Mary listens in; nobody is on the line with Norman. While Norman debates with \"Mother\" about her command to kill Mary, Mary runs into the cellar and dresses up as Mother, complete with butcher knife, in an unsuccessful bid to get Norman to \"hang up\". Dr. Raymond grabs her from behind, thinking he has caught her in the act of trying to drive Norman insane, and in her fright Mary plunges the butcher knife into his heart. Confronted by the sight of \"Mother\" standing over Dr. Raymond's bloody corpse, Norman's sanity snaps and he advances upon Mary, babbling. Mary backs into the fruit cellar and stumbles upon Lila's body, buried in a pile of coal. Assuming Norman is responsible, Mary raises her knife to kill him but is shot dead by the incoming police. The ensuing investigation is inconclusive, but in light of an overheard argument between Mary and Lila, Mary's attempt to kill Norman, and her dressing as Norma Bates, the police deduce Mary most likely committed all the murders.\n\nLater, Emma Spool, the diner co-worker, visits Norman. Spool tells Norman she is his real mother, and that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Spool was institutionalized. She reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. In response, Norman strikes her in the head with a shovel, killing her. He then carries the body upstairs to Mother's room, and begins talking to himself in her voice, signifying that Norman\u2019s \u201cMother\u201d personality has once again taken control of his mind.\n\n[[File:Anthony Perkins (1983).jpg|thumb|150px|[[Anthony Perkins]] in 1983]]\n==Cast==\n* [[Anthony Perkins]] as [[Norman Bates]]\n* [[Vera Miles]] as [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]]\n* [[Robert Loggia]] as Dr. Bill Raymond\n* [[Meg Tilly]] as Mary \"Samuels\" Loomis\n* [[Dennis Franz]] as Warren Toomey\n* [[Hugh Gillin]] as Sheriff John Hunt\n* [[Robert Alan Browne]] as Ralph Statler\n* [[Claudia Bryar]] as [[Emma Spool]]\n* Ben Hartigan as Judge\n* [[Lee Garlington]] as Myrna\n* Jill Caroll as Kim\n\n==Production==\n\n===Screenplay===\nIn 1982, author [[Robert Bloch]] published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films.

It is the first [[sequel]] to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the second film in the ''[[Psycho (franchise)|Psycho]]'' series. Set 22 years after the first film, it follows [[Norman Bates]] after he is released from the mental institution and returns to the house and Bates Motel to continue a normal life. However, his troubled past continues to haunt him. It is unrelated to the 1982 novel ''[[Psycho II (novel)|Psycho II]]'' by [[Robert Bloch]], which he wrote as a sequel to his original novel ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]''.\n\nIn preparing the film, Universal hired Holland to write an entirely different screenplay, while Australian director Franklin, a one-time student of Hitchcock, was hired to direct. The film marked Franklins's American feature film debut.<ref name=afi/> Released on June 3, 1983, ''Psycho II'' grossed $34.7 million at the box office on a budget of $5 million.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=June 3, 2018|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho2.htm|title=Psycho II}}</ref> The film was followed by ''[[Psycho III]]'' (1986).\n\n==Plot==\nAfter 22 years in a mental institution, [[Norman Bates]] has been cured of his insanity and accepted that his mother is dead. As such, the court has him released. Marion's sister Lila, who married Marion's lover Sam Loomis, vehemently protests, but her plea is dismissed. Against the advice of Dr. Bill Raymond, Norman takes up residence in his old home behind the Bates Motel. He reports to a prearranged job at a nearby diner, where an old lady named [[Emma Spool]] works. After work, a young waitress at the diner, Mary Samuels, has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey, has been using the motel for dealing drugs. He immediately fires Toomey.\n\nNorman's assimilation into society appears to be going well until he begins to receive mysterious phone calls and notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. During a work shift, a drunk Toomey picks a fight with Norman, and he suspects him of the notes and phone calls. Shortly after, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death as he is packing to leave the motel.\n \nBecoming increasingly sympathetic to and impressed by Norman's fight to keep his sanity, Mary takes up permanent residence in a guest room at his house. While Norman is renovating his motel, he hears voices in the house, and enters his mother's bedroom to find it exactly as it was 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Meanwhile, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window to have sex. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts police. Mary finds Norman in the attic and he shows her his mother's bedroom, only to find it back to its state of disuse. The sheriff arrives and questions them about the boy's murder. Mary claims they were out walking together at the time. After the sheriff leaves, Norman rebukes her for lying. He fears he may have killed the boy, since Mary told him the attic was unlocked when she found him.\n\nThat evening, Mary and Norman find a bloody rag stuffed in the toilet. Norman is horrified, believing he committed another murder, but Mary insists he is innocent. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, her mother; Lila and Mary have in fact been making the phone calls and notes, even posing at the window dressed as Norma Bates. Mary altered Norman's room and locked Norman in the attic so she could change it back. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted. However, Mary's growing friendship with Norman has convinced her he is no longer capable of killing. She suspects someone else is in the house, pointing out that Norman was locked in the attic at the time of the boy's death.\n\nDr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and tells Norman that Mary and Lila must be the ones harassing him. He also has the corpse of Norma Bates exhumed, to prove Norman is not being haunted by his mother. Norman is only partially convinced, saying the one behind everything must be his \"real mother\", despite there being no record of him being adopted. Norman confronts Mary with what Dr. Raymond told him. She says that she has given up her part in Lila's ruse, but Lila will not stop. Later, Norman becomes too terrified to leave his room, saying he saw his real mother in the house. Mary admits to Norman that his sanity is beginning to erode and stays to comfort him.\n\nWhile Lila is retrieving her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the cellar floor, a figure steps out of the shadows and murders her. Meanwhile, the police dredge the swamp and find a car, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Mary runs to the house to try to convince Norman to flee. The phone rings, Norman answers, and starts speaking to \"Mother\". Mary listens in; nobody is on the line with Norman. While Norman debates with \"Mother\" about her command to kill Mary, Mary runs into the cellar and dresses up as Mother, complete with butcher knife, in an unsuccessful bid to get Norman to \"hang up\". Dr. Raymond grabs her from behind, thinking he has caught her in the act of trying to drive Norman insane, and in her fright Mary plunges the butcher knife into his heart. Confronted by the sight of \"Mother\" standing over Dr. Raymond's bloody corpse, Norman's sanity snaps and he advances upon Mary, babbling. Mary backs into the fruit cellar and stumbles upon Lila's body, buried in a pile of coal. Assuming Norman is responsible, Mary raises her knife to kill him but is shot dead by the incoming police. The ensuing investigation is inconclusive, but in light of an overheard argument between Mary and Lila, Mary's attempt to kill Norman, and her dressing as Norma Bates, the police deduce Mary most likely committed all the murders.\n\nLater, Emma Spool, the diner co-worker, visits Norman.

Twenty-three minutes after departure, the [[control tower]] tried to make contact with the plane, but there were no response, and a [[search and rescue|search operation]] was commenced.

On the morning of 17 April 2009, while en route to Mulia, the aircraft [[controlled flight into terrain|impacted]] Mount Gergaji, killing all eleven people on board.\n\nThe Mimika Air crash was the second fatal aviation accident in Papua, and the third in Indonesia, in less than two weeks.<ref name=upi/> A [[cargo aircraft]] had also crashed in Papua on April 9, killing six people,<ref name=upi>{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Wreckage of crashed plane located in Papua |url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/04/18/Wreckage-of-crashed-plane-located-in-Papua/UPI-96761240098125/|work=[[United Press International]]|publisher=|date=2009-04-18 |accessdate=2009-04-19}}</ref> and an [[Indonesian Air Force]] aircraft had [[2009 Indonesian Air Force Fokker F27-400M crash|crashed]] in West Java on April 6, killing 24 people.<ref>{{ASN accident|title=Fokker F-27 Friendship {{sic|nolink=y|400M}} ''A-2703''|id=20090406-0 |accessdate=2014-02-13}}</ref>\n\nThe Indonesian [[National Transportation Safety Committee]] released a report that concluded the crash was due to the [[pilot (aviation)|pilot's]] lack of familiarization with the route, coupled with [[spatial disorientation]] occurring after the aircraft entered clouds. \n\n==Flight route==\nThe Ilaga-Mulia route is at a high elevation among numerous mountain peaks. Pilots familiar with the route and the aircraft type reported that it was impossible for a Pilatus Porter to depart from Ilaga and climb over Mount Gergaji without making a series of circles in flight. Such maneuvering necessarily increases the route's required time beyond the planned 18 minutes.<ref name=upi/><ref name=ntsc/>\n\nAboard the flight were one pilot, one observer, and nine passengers: eight adults and one infant. The aircraft was also carrying a voting box and paper for the country's upcoming [[Indonesian legislative election, 2009|national legislative election]].<ref name=asiannewsnet>{{cite news|title=Ten people killed in Papua plane crash |url=http://www.asianewsnet.net/news.php?id=5277&sec=1 |work=[[The Jakarta Post]] |date=2009-04-19 |accessdate=2009-04-19 |url-status=usurped |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421012912/http://www.asianewsnet.net/news.php?id=5277&sec=1 |archivedate=21 April 2009 }}</ref><ref name=ntsc/> The pilot operating the flight had logged 2,664 hours of flying experience, of which 1,412 were on the Porter. He held a current [[commercial pilot license]] from Myanmar. A validation certificate was also received by the Indonesian Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on 12 February 2009.<ref name=ntsc/>\n\n==Crash==\nThe plane departed from Ilaga Airport at 10:00 AM local time, under [[visual flight rules]]. According to records, there was no radio contact between Flight 514 and the tower. Twenty-three minutes after departure, the [[control tower]] tried to make contact with the plane, but there were no response, and a [[search and rescue|search operation]] was commenced. Later, the search operation was scaled up when a signal from the crashed aircraft's electronic locator transmitter was picked up by search aircraft.<ref name=ntsc/>\n\nIndonesian search teams discovered the crash site the following day, during an air search.<ref name=upi/> The location of the accident was not on the route normally flown by the flight.<ref name=ntsc/> The wreckage, which showed the plane had crashed inverted, was still smoking when found. The engine, both propellers, [[cockpit]], and wings was destroyed by the post-impact fire. The forward [[fuselage]] was also burned down, along with with the main [[landing gear]].<ref name=upi/>\n\nThe Porter had gone down about 12,000 feet up Mount Gergaji, close to the site of a 2006 [[Trigana Air Service]] aircraft crash which had killed nine people.<ref name=upi/> None of the eleven people on board the Porter survived.<ref name=ntsc/> At the time of the accident, the weather in the area, as observed by the [[Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics]], was mostly clear, with some clouds near the impact area.\n\nFindings by the NTSC concluded that Flight 514 crashed due to [[pilot error]]. The pilot joined Mimika Air on 12 February, and lacked knowledge about the route. The pilot attempted to fly a direct route to Mulia using [[GPS]], and tried flying over Mount Gergaji without any circling attempts. When the flight entered clouds, the pilot became spatially disorientated and lost control of the aircraft.<ref name =ntsc>{{cite web |title=KNKT.09.04.13.04 |url=https://knkt.dephub.go.id/knkt/ntsc_aviation/aaic.htm |website=knkt.dephub.go.id |publisher=NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY COMMITTEE |accessdate=22 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Santa Barbara Airlines Flight 518]]\n* [[Trigana Air Service Flight 267]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/12/03/mimika-starts-new-plane-ferry-tankers.html Jakarta Post:Mimika starts new plane, ferry, tankers]\n*[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/09/03/palembang-evening-flights-reduced-mimika-starts.html Jakarta Post: Palembang evening flights reduced, Mimika starts up]\n\n{{coord missing|Indonesia}}\n\n{{Aviation accidents and incidents in 2009}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mimika Air Crash, 2009}}\n[[Category:2009 in Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Indonesia]]\n[[Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2009]]\n[[Category:Papua (province)]]\n[[Category:Western New Guinea]]\n[[Category:April 2009 events in Asia]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimika_Air_Flight_514"}
