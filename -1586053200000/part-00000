It was released on October 25, 2019, through [[GOOD Music]] and distributed by [[Def Jam Recordings]]. The album follows a [[Christianity|Christian]] theme, with West describing it as \"an expression of [[the gospel]].\" West had formed his [[Gospel music|gospel]] group the [[Sunday Service Choir]] in January 2019, performing gospel songs and covers of songs from West's discography. The song \"[[Water (Kanye West song)|Water]]\" was performed live prior to release by the group.\n\n''Jesus Is King'' features guest appearances from [[Clipse]], [[Ty Dolla Sign]], [[Kenny G]], [[Fred Hammond]], [[Ant Clemons]], and the Sunday Service Choir. Production is included from West, [[Benny Blanco]], BoogzDaBeast, [[Francis Starlite]], [[Pi'erre Bourne]], and [[Timbaland]], among others. West quit taking medication for his [[bipolar disorder]] and began recording the album in August 2018, originally announcing it as ''Yandhi''. The album missed two initial release dates in September and November 2018 under the original title, before being delayed indefinitely.\n\nIn August 2019, West's wife [[Kim Kardashian]] reannounced ''Yandhi'' as ''Jesus Is King'', but it missed two planned release dates for late September 2019 under the new title. The final release was simultaneous with that of a [[concert film]] [[Jesus Is King (film)|of the same name]], which included a number of the tracks as part of the soundtrack. \"[[Follow God]]\" was released as the lead single in November 2019, followed by \"[[Closed on Sunday]]\" later that same month. The album received mixed reviews from music critics. Some praised it in comparison to West's previous solo album ''[[Ye (album)|Ye]]'' and complemented the composition, while other critics expressed negative feelings towards the lyrical content and the inconsistency of ideas.\n\n''Jesus Is King'' stood as West's record-equaling ninth consecutive album to debut atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. With the release, West became the first artist to occupy all top ten spots on the US [[Christian Songs]] and [[Billboard charts|Gospel Songs]] charts, respectively. West also became the first artist to simultaneously top five separate US charts: the ''Billboard'' 200, [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]], [[Rap Albums|Top Rap Albums]], [[Top Christian Albums Chart|Top Christian Albums]] and [[Top Gospel Albums]]. The album was a chart topper in eight other countries, including Australia and Canada, while attaining top five positions in the Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. A companion album, ''[[Jesus Is Born]]'', was released in December 2019 by the Sunday Service Choir, and West's collaborative sequel album ''[[Jesus Is King Part II]]'' with [[Dr. Dre]] is slated for a future release.\n\n==Background and recording==\n===August \u2013 November 2018: ''Yandhi'', Chicago and Uganda===\nThroughout May and June 2018, five seven-track albums produced by West at his ranch in [[Jackson Hole, Wyoming]] were successively released as the Wyoming Sessions. [[Pusha T]]'s third studio album ''[[Daytona (album)|Daytona]]'' was released first, followed by West's eighth studio album ''[[Ye (album)|Ye]]'', West's collaborative studio album ''[[Kids See Ghosts (album)|Kids See Ghosts]]'', with [[Kid Cudi]] as [[Kids See Ghosts]], [[Nas]]' twelfth studio album ''[[Nasir (album)|Nasir]]'', and [[Teyana Taylor]]'s second studio album ''[[K.T.S.E.]]''; all of the albums were released in 2018. On ''Ye'', West acknowledged his [[bipolar disorder]] diagnosis. He stopped taking his medication for the disorder in June 2018 during the rollout of the Wyoming Sessions albums.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/12/kanye-mental-health/|title=Kanye: \"6 months off meds I can feel me again\"|date=December 15, 2018|accessdate=March 11, 2019|magazine=[[Consequence of Sound]]|first=Alex|last=Young|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215215103/https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/12/kanye-mental-health/|archive-date=December 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2018/12/13/nicki-minaj-kanye-west-tekashi-6ix9ine-worst-album-rollout-2018/|title=Nicki Minaj, Kanye West, Tekashi 6ix9ine: Which Rapper Had The Worst Album Rollout Of 2018?|magazine=[[Forbes]]|date=December 13, 2018|first=Bryan|last=Rolli|accessdate=September 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214123613/https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2018/12/13/nicki-minaj-kanye-west-tekashi-6ix9ine-worst-album-rollout-2018/|archive-date=December 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2018, Chicago music artist [[Chance the Rapper]] announced that West was coming to Chicago to produce for his seven-track debut studio album.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8465190/chance-the-rapper-kanye-west-chicago-produce-new-album|title=Chance the Rapper Says Kanye West Is Heading to Chicago to Produce His New Album|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 12, 2018|first=Carl|last=Lamarre|accessdate=March 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714091209/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8465190/chance-the-rapper-kanye-west-chicago-produce-new-album|archive-date=July 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>{{efn|Chance the Rapper's debut studio album ''[[The Big Day (album)|The Big Day]]'' was later released in July 2019 with no contributions from West.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tinymixtapes.com/news/chance-rapper-the-big-day-new-album|title=Chance The Rapper drops ''The Big Day'', featuring everyone but Kanye West|date=July 26, 2019|accessdate=September 9, 2019|website=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727021530/https://www.tinymixtapes.com/news/chance-rapper-the-big-day-new-album|archive-date=July 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>}} West was seen in the city at the end of August 2018, and simultaneously confirmed to [[Fox News]] that the two of them were recording music together.<ref name=\"August\">{{Cite news|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/kanye-west-chicago-chance-the-rapper-album/|title=Kanye West in Chicago working with Chance the Rapper|date=August 29, 2018|accessdate=March 13, 2019|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|first=Alice|last=Bazerghi|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829193755/https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/kanye-west-chicago-chance-the-rapper-album/|archive-date=August 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/08/kanye-chance-the-rapper-new-album/|title=Kanye in Chicago to work on Chance the Rapper's new album|date=August 30, 2018|accessdate=September 19, 2019|magazine=Consequence of Sound|first=Alex|last=Young|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830084551/https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/08/kanye-chance-the-rapper-new-album/|archive-date=August 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> West later stated that his recording sessions with Chance the Rapper had helped the former reconnect with his roots and faith in [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2019/08/kanye-west-new-album-jesus-is-king-timeline/december-15-2018|title=Kanye West's Road From 'Yandhi' to 'Jesus Is King'|date=August 30, 2019|accessdate=September 9, 2019|website=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|first=Jessica|last=McKinney|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831145326/https://www.complex.com/music/2019/08/kanye-west-new-album-jesus-is-king-timeline/|archive-date=August 31, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The following month, West released the collaborative single \"[[I Love It (Kanye West and Lil Pump song)|I Love It]]\" with fellow rapper [[Lil Pump]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hot97.com/news/news/kanye-west-releases-brand-new-nsfw-single-i-love-it-ft-lil-pump-video|title=Kanye West Releases Brand New NSFW Single 'I Love It' ft.

It was released on October 25, 2019, through [[GOOD Music]] and distributed by [[Def Jam Recordings]]. The album follows a [[Christianity|Christian]] theme, with West describing it as \"an expression of [[the gospel]].\" West had formed his [[Gospel music|gospel]] group the [[Sunday Service Choir]] in January 2019, performing gospel songs and covers of songs from West's discography. The song \"[[Water (Kanye West song)|Water]]\" was performed live prior to release by the group.\n\n''Jesus Is King'' features guest appearances from [[Clipse]], [[Ty Dolla Sign]], [[Kenny G]], [[Fred Hammond]], [[Ant Clemons]], and the Sunday Service Choir. Production is included from West, [[Benny Blanco]], BoogzDaBeast, [[Francis Starlite]], [[Pi'erre Bourne]], and [[Timbaland]], among others. West quit taking medication for his [[bipolar disorder]] and began recording the album in August 2018, originally announcing it as ''Yandhi''. The album missed two initial release dates in September and November 2018 under the original title, before being delayed indefinitely.\n\nIn August 2019, West's wife [[Kim Kardashian]] reannounced ''Yandhi'' as ''Jesus Is King'', but it missed two planned release dates for late September 2019 under the new title. The final release was simultaneous with that of a [[concert film]] [[Jesus Is King (film)|of the same name]], which included a number of the tracks as part of the soundtrack. \"[[Follow God]]\" was released as the lead single in November 2019, followed by \"[[Closed on Sunday]]\" later that same month. The album received mixed reviews from music critics. Some praised it in comparison to West's previous solo album ''[[Ye (album)|Ye]]'' and complemented the composition, while other critics expressed negative feelings towards the lyrical content and the inconsistency of ideas.\n\n''Jesus Is King'' stood as West's record-equaling ninth consecutive album to debut atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. With the release, West became the first artist to occupy all top ten spots on the US [[Christian Songs]] and [[Billboard charts|Gospel Songs]] charts, respectively. West also became the first artist to simultaneously top five separate US charts: the ''Billboard'' 200, [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]], [[Rap Albums|Top Rap Albums]], [[Top Christian Albums Chart|Top Christian Albums]] and [[Top Gospel Albums]]. The album was a chart topper in eight other countries, including Australia and Canada, while attaining top five positions in the Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. A companion album, ''[[Jesus Is Born]]'', was released in December 2019 by the Sunday Service Choir, and West's collaborative sequel album ''[[Jesus Is King Part II]]'' with [[Dr. Dre]] is slated for a future release.\n\n==Background and recording==\n===August \u2013 November 2018: ''Yandhi'', Chicago and Uganda===\nThroughout May and June 2018, five seven-track albums produced by West at his ranch in [[Jackson Hole, Wyoming]] were successively released as the Wyoming Sessions. [[Pusha T]]'s third studio album ''[[Daytona (album)|Daytona]]'' was released first, followed by West's eighth studio album ''[[Ye (album)|Ye]]'', West's collaborative studio album ''[[Kids See Ghosts (album)|Kids See Ghosts]]'', with [[Kid Cudi]] as [[Kids See Ghosts]], [[Nas]]' twelfth studio album ''[[Nasir (album)|Nasir]]'', and [[Teyana Taylor]]'s second studio album ''[[K.T.S.E.]]''; all of the albums were released in 2018. On ''Ye'', West acknowledged his [[bipolar disorder]] diagnosis. He stopped taking his medication for the disorder in June 2018 during the rollout of the Wyoming Sessions albums.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/12/kanye-mental-health/|title=Kanye: \"6 months off meds I can feel me again\"|date=December 15, 2018|accessdate=March 11, 2019|magazine=[[Consequence of Sound]]|first=Alex|last=Young|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215215103/https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/12/kanye-mental-health/|archive-date=December 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2018/12/13/nicki-minaj-kanye-west-tekashi-6ix9ine-worst-album-rollout-2018/|title=Nicki Minaj, Kanye West, Tekashi 6ix9ine: Which Rapper Had The Worst Album Rollout Of 2018?|magazine=[[Forbes]]|date=December 13, 2018|first=Bryan|last=Rolli|accessdate=September 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214123613/https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrolli/2018/12/13/nicki-minaj-kanye-west-tekashi-6ix9ine-worst-album-rollout-2018/|archive-date=December 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2018, Chicago music artist [[Chance the Rapper]] announced that West was coming to Chicago to produce for his seven-track debut studio album.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8465190/chance-the-rapper-kanye-west-chicago-produce-new-album|title=Chance the Rapper Says Kanye West Is Heading to Chicago to Produce His New Album|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 12, 2018|first=Carl|last=Lamarre|accessdate=March 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714091209/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8465190/chance-the-rapper-kanye-west-chicago-produce-new-album|archive-date=July 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>{{efn|Chance the Rapper's debut studio album ''[[The Big Day (album)|The Big Day]]'' was later released in July 2019 with no contributions from West.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tinymixtapes.com/news/chance-rapper-the-big-day-new-album|title=Chance The Rapper drops ''The Big Day'', featuring everyone but Kanye West|date=July 26, 2019|accessdate=September 9, 2019|website=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727021530/https://www.tinymixtapes.com/news/chance-rapper-the-big-day-new-album|archive-date=July 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>}} West was seen in the city at the end of August 2018, and simultaneously confirmed to [[Fox News]] that the two of them were recording music together.<ref name=\"August\">{{Cite news|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/kanye-west-chicago-chance-the-rapper-album/|title=Kanye West in Chicago working with Chance the Rapper|date=August 29, 2018|accessdate=March 13, 2019|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|first=Alice|last=Bazerghi|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829193755/https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/kanye-west-chicago-chance-the-rapper-album/|archive-date=August 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/08/kanye-chance-the-rapper-new-album/|title=Kanye in Chicago to work on Chance the Rapper's new album|date=August 30, 2018|accessdate=September 19, 2019|magazine=Consequence of Sound|first=Alex|last=Young|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830084551/https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/08/kanye-chance-the-rapper-new-album/|archive-date=August 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> West later stated that his recording sessions with Chance the Rapper had helped the former reconnect with his roots and faith in [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2019/08/kanye-west-new-album-jesus-is-king-timeline/december-15-2018|title=Kanye West's Road From 'Yandhi' to 'Jesus Is King'|date=August 30, 2019|accessdate=September 9, 2019|website=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|first=Jessica|last=McKinney|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190831145326/https://www.complex.com/music/2019/08/kanye-west-new-album-jesus-is-king-timeline/|archive-date=August 31, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The following month, West released the collaborative single \"[[I Love It (Kanye West and Lil Pump song)|I Love It]]\" with fellow rapper [[Lil Pump]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hot97.com/news/news/kanye-west-releases-brand-new-nsfw-single-i-love-it-ft-lil-pump-video|title=Kanye West Releases Brand New NSFW Single 'I Love It' ft.
