[[Monmouth University]] is located off Route 71 in West Long Branch.\n\nRoute 71 is the former alignment of [[New Jersey Route 4|State Highway Route 4]] and Route 35. In 1927, the alignment became the designation of '''State Highway Route 4-N'''. This alignment remained intact until the [[1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering|state highway renumbering in 1953]], when it became Route 71. The route has remained virtually unchanged since.

The route heads northward through Brielle as Union Avenue, passing through the commercial district and residential after the intersection with Harvey Avenue. Route&nbsp;71 continues northward through Brielle as a two-lane highway before beginning a parallel with [[NJ Transit]]'s [[North Jersey Coast Line]]. After entering the community of [[Manasquan, New Jersey|Manasquan]], the highway enters a large commercial district and crosses over the Stockton Brook before curving onto Seventh Avenue. After the intersection with [[County Route 49 (Monmouth County, New Jersey)|Monmouth County Route&nbsp;49]] (Sea Girt Avenue), Route&nbsp;71 enters the community of [[Sea Girt, New Jersey|Sea Girt]]. The route continues north through Sea Girt until the intersection with [[County Route 20 (Monmouth County, New Jersey)|Monmouth County Route&nbsp;20]] (Manasquan Turnpike), where it enters a short portion of [[Wall Township, New Jersey|Wall Township]]. There, the route crosses over the North Branch of the Wreck Pond and enters [[Spring Lake Heights, New Jersey|Spring Lake Heights]].

After crossing the intersection with [[County Route 18 (Monmouth County, New Jersey)|Monmouth County Route&nbsp;18]] (Sixteenth Avenue), Route 71 enters the downtown portion of Belmar, intersecting with Route&nbsp;35 (River Road). There, Routes&nbsp;35 and 71 become concurrent through Belmar, passing the local [[Belmar (NJT station)|Belmar train station]]. At the intersection with Eighth Street, Route 71 turns off to the east and crosses parallel to Route&nbsp;35 over the [[Shark River (New Jersey)|Shark River]] to the community of [[Avon-by-the-Sea, New Jersey|Avon-by-the-Sea]]. There, the two routes continue to parallel, with Route 71 becoming a divided one-way street through Avon-by-the-Sea. The route continues northward through the residential seashore community, crossing the Sylvan Creek and entering [[Bradley Beach, New Jersey|Bradley Beach]]. Through Bradley Beach, Route 71 intersects with [[County Route 2 (Monmouth County, New Jersey)|Monmouth County Route&nbsp;2]], which serves access to the [[Bradley Beach (NJT station)|Bradley Beach train station]]. The highway continues northward through the residential district, and enters [[Neptune Township, New Jersey|Neptune Township]]. There, Route 71 intersects with the eastern terminus of the cross-state [[New Jersey Route 33]] at Corlies Avenue before entering the large city of [[Asbury Park, New Jersey|Asbury Park]].<ref name=\"bing\" />\n\n[[File:New Jersey State Route 71 at Monmouth University.jpg|left|thumb|Route 71 at Monmouth University in West Long Branch]]\nThrough Asbury Park, Route&nbsp;71 intersects with several local streets at traffic lights as Main Street. The route also serves as the terminus of both [[County Route 16 (Monmouth County, New Jersey)|County Route 16]] and [[County Route 18 (Monmouth County, New Jersey)|County Route 18]]. After crossing through Sunset Park, Route 71 approaches [[Deal Lake]], where the highway turns to the east along Deal Lake Drive. Route 71's right-of-way on Main Street becomes [[County Route 15 (Monmouth County, New Jersey)|County Route 15]] and Route 71 continues through the lakeshore community as a two-lane arterial. Soon after, Route&nbsp;71 turns on Park Avenue, crosses over Deal Lake and enters [[Loch Arbour, New Jersey|Loch Arbour]]. However, the highway heads northward into the community of [[Allenhurst, New Jersey|Allenhurst]] soon after. Route 71, now known as Norwood Avenue, crosses out of Allenhurst after an intersection with Cedar Avenue, entering the community of [[Deal, New Jersey|Deal]]. Before the intersection with Roseld Avenue, the highway becomes a divided one with a center median. The route continues this way through the residential portions of Deal, crossing into [[Ocean Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey|Ocean Township]]. There, the route comes back together, crossing over the North Jersey Coast Line once again near the [[Elberon (NJT station)|Elberon train station]]. Route 71 continues through Ocean Township until entering the community of [[West Long Branch, New Jersey|West Long Branch]] near Whale Pond Brook. At that point, Route 71 serves as the main road to access [[Monmouth University]]. At the intersection with Cedar Avenue, Norwood Avenue ends, and Route 71 northbound turns westward along Cedar. The route crosses through Monmouth University and enters the residential portions of West Long Branch, intersecting with County Route&nbsp;15 and [[County Route 32 (Monmouth County, New Jersey)|32]] within a mile of each other. At the intersection with County Route&nbsp;15, Route&nbsp;71 turns to the northwest through a residential area.<ref name=\"bing\" />\n\n[[File:Eatontown, NJ - Route 71 at 35.jpg|right|thumb|Northern terminus of Route 71 at Route 35 in Eatontown (Route 71 southbound ahead)]]\nRoute 71 parallels the [[Glenwood Cemetery West Long Branch|Glenwood Cemetery]] before intersecting with [[New Jersey Route 36]] in West Long Branch. Here, Route&nbsp;71 continues northwestward on Monmouth Road through large commercial complexes and the local country club. The highway continues northward into [[Eatontown, New Jersey|Eatontown]], where it enters a local residential area and intersects with [[County Route 547 (New Jersey)|County Route 547]] (Eatontown Boulevard), which become concurrent. Routes 71 and 547 enter downtown Eatontown as Broad Street, heading westward with County Route 547 splitting at Wyckoff Road. The highway continues into the commercial district of Eatontown, where it intersects [[New Jersey Route 35]] once again but Route&nbsp;71 terminates.<ref name=\"bing\" />\n\n==History==\n{{infobox road small\n|state=NJ\n|type=NJ 1926\n|county=\n|route=4N\n|location= [[Brielle, New Jersey|Brielle]]&ndash;[[Eatontown, New Jersey|Eatontown]]\n|length_mi=\n|length_round=\n|length_ref=\n|formed=1927<ref name=\"1927map\" />\n|deleted=1953<ref name=\"nj1953\" />\n}}\nRoute 71 originates as part of the Jersey Coast Way, an auto trail running from the Staten Island Ferry to Cape May.
