{"title_page": "List of home video game consoles", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2016}}\n{{VG history|expandmenu=2}}\n\nThis is a '''list of home video game consoles''' in chronological order, which includes all known [[home video game console]]s after the first generation, from the first console, [[Magnavox Odyssey]], to the first ever [[ROM cartridge]]-based console [[Fairchild Channel F]], ranging from the major video game companies such as [[Magnavox]], [[Atari]], [[Fairchild]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}, [[Intellivision|Intellivision Entertainment]], [[Coleco]], [[Nintendo]], [[Sega]], [[NEC]], [[The 3DO Company|3DO]], [[SNK]], [[Sony]], and [[Microsoft]] to modern market consoles.whats up drama nation its your host killer keemstar\n\nThis list is divided into eras which are named based on the dominant console type of the era, though not all consoles of those eras are of the same type. Some eras are referred to based on how many bits a major console could process. The \"128-bit era\" ([[Sixth generation of video game consoles|sixth generation]]) was the final era in which this practice was widespread.\n\nThis list does not include other types of [[video game console]]s such as [[handheld game console]]s, which are usually of lower computational power than [[home console]]s due to their smaller size, [[microconsoles]], which are usually low-cost Android-based devices that rely on downloading, or [[dedicated console]]s past the first generation, which have games built in and do not use any form of physical media. Consoles have been redesigned from time to time to improve their market appeal. Redesigned models are not listed on their own.\n\n== Map key ==\nThere are a total of '''{{#expr:{{table row counter|id=2gencon|ignore=2}}+{{table row counter|id=3gencon|ignore=3}}+{{table row counter|id=4gencon|ignore=5}}+{{table row counter|id=5gencon|ignore=1}}+{{table row counter|id=6gencon|ignore=3}}+{{table row counter|id=7gencon|ignore=2}}+{{table row counter|id=8gencon|ignore=1}}}}''' video game platforms released since the second generation, and '''10''' canceled platforms.\n\nThis list only counts the first iteration of each console's hardware, because several systems have had slim, enhanced or other hardware revisions, but they aren't individually listed here. The list also includes unreleased systems. If a series of home video game consoles begins in a generation and lasts to another generation, it is listed in the generation the series began. This list does not claim to be complete.\n\n:{{legend|{{{1|#b6fcb6}}}|size=50%| ''Background shading indicates the [[List of best-selling game consoles|best-selling console]] of each respective generation.'' }}\n:{{legend|{{{1|#FFE8E8}}}|size=50%| ''Background shading indicates canceled systems that either stopped being developed at any stage or were canceled.'' }}\n:{{Legend|| outline = #FFFFFF|size=50%|{{Hash-tag}} ''Hash-tags indicate console series/platforms that have different hardware revisions.''}}\n\n== First generation (1972\u20131984) ==\n{{Main article|List of first generation home video game consoles}}{{See also|First generation of video game consoles}}\n\nThere were '''{{table row counter|id=genonecon|page=List of first generation home video game consoles|ignore=1}}''' home video game consoles known to have been released in the first generation of video game consoles.

Some eras are referred to based on how many bits a major console could process. The \"128-bit era\" ([[Sixth generation of video game consoles|sixth generation]]) was the final era in which this practice was widespread.\n\nThis list does not include other types of [[video game console]]s such as [[handheld game console]]s, which are usually of lower computational power than [[home console]]s due to their smaller size, [[microconsoles]], which are usually low-cost Android-based devices that rely on downloading, or [[dedicated console]]s past the first generation, which have games built in and do not use any form of physical media. Consoles have been redesigned from time to time to improve their market appeal.

This bridge held the record for longest span in the world for twenty nine years, until it was surpassed by the [[Quebec Bridge]].

The suspended span, where [[Kaichi Watanabe]] sits, is seen in the center. The need to resist compression of the lower [[Chord (truss construction)|chord]] is seen in the use of wooden poles while the tension of the upper chord is shown by the outstretched arms.

In a common variant, the '''suspended span''', the cantilever arms do not meet in the center; instead, they support a central [[truss bridge]] which rests on the ends of the cantilever arms. The suspended span may be built off-site and lifted into place, or constructed in place using special travelling supports.\n\n{{clear}}\n[[File:CooperRiverBridge.svg|500px|thumb|center|A diagram of the parts of the [[John P. Grace Memorial Bridge]] ]]\n{{clear}}\n\nA common way to construct steel truss and prestressed concrete cantilever spans is to counterbalance each cantilever arm with another cantilever arm projecting the opposite direction, forming a '''balanced cantilever'''; when they attach to a solid foundation, the counterbalancing arms are called '''anchor arms'''. Thus, in a bridge built on two foundation piers, there are four cantilever arms: two which span the obstacle, and two anchor arms which extend away from the obstacle. Because of the need for more strength at the balanced cantilever's supports, the bridge superstructure often takes the form of towers above the foundation piers. The [[Commodore Barry Bridge]] is an example of this type of cantilever bridge.\n\nSteel truss cantilevers support loads by [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] of the upper members and [[compression (physical)|compression]] of the lower ones. Commonly, the structure distributes the tension via the anchor arms to the outermost supports, while the compression is carried to the foundations beneath the central towers. Many truss cantilever bridges use pinned joints and are therefore [[statically determinate]] with no members carrying mixed loads.\n\nPrestressed concrete balanced cantilever bridges are often built using [[Segmental bridge|segmental construction]].\n\n== Construction methods==\nSome steel arch bridges (such as the [[Navajo Bridge]]) are built using pure cantilever spans from each side, with neither falsework below nor temporary supporting towers and cables above. These are then joined with a pin, usually after forcing the union point apart, and when jacks are removed and the bridge decking is added the bridge becomes a [[truss arch bridge]]. Such unsupported construction is only possible where appropriate rock is available to support the tension in the upper chord of the span during construction, usually limiting this method to the spanning of narrow canyons.\n\n[[File:SFOBB-OldEastSpanDismantleCropped.png|500px|thumb|center|The old eastern span of the [[San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge]], pictured in August 2014, is deconstructed in nearly the reverse order of its construction.

In a common variant, the '''suspended span''', the cantilever arms do not meet in the center; instead, they support a central [[truss bridge]] which rests on the ends of the cantilever arms. The suspended span may be built off-site and lifted into place, or constructed in place using special travelling supports.\n\n{{clear}}\n[[File:CooperRiverBridge.svg|500px|thumb|center|A diagram of the parts of the [[John P. Grace Memorial Bridge]] ]]\n{{clear}}\n\nA common way to construct steel truss and prestressed concrete cantilever spans is to counterbalance each cantilever arm with another cantilever arm projecting the opposite direction, forming a '''balanced cantilever'''; when they attach to a solid foundation, the counterbalancing arms are called '''anchor arms'''. Thus, in a bridge built on two foundation piers, there are four cantilever arms: two which span the obstacle, and two anchor arms which extend away from the obstacle. Because of the need for more strength at the balanced cantilever's supports, the bridge superstructure often takes the form of towers above the foundation piers. The [[Commodore Barry Bridge]] is an example of this type of cantilever bridge.\n\nSteel truss cantilevers support loads by [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] of the upper members and [[compression (physical)|compression]] of the lower ones. Commonly, the structure distributes the tension via the anchor arms to the outermost supports, while the compression is carried to the foundations beneath the central towers. Many truss cantilever bridges use pinned joints and are therefore [[statically determinate]] with no members carrying mixed loads.\n\nPrestressed concrete balanced cantilever bridges are often built using [[Segmental bridge|segmental construction]].\n\n== Construction methods==\nSome steel arch bridges (such as the [[Navajo Bridge]]) are built using pure cantilever spans from each side, with neither falsework below nor temporary supporting towers and cables above. These are then joined with a pin, usually after forcing the union point apart, and when jacks are removed and the bridge decking is added the bridge becomes a [[truss arch bridge]]. Such unsupported construction is only possible where appropriate rock is available to support the tension in the upper chord of the span during construction, usually limiting this method to the spanning of narrow canyons.\n\n[[File:SFOBB-OldEastSpanDismantleCropped.png|500px|thumb|center|The old eastern span of the [[San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge]], pictured in August 2014, is deconstructed in nearly the reverse order of its construction. Similar temporary supports were used under each anchor arm during the bridge's construction.]]\n\n== List by length ==\n{{main|List of longest cantilever bridges|List of cantilever bridges}}\nWorld's longest cantilever bridges (by longest span):<ref name=\"NSBA-longbridge\">{{Cite book |url=http://www.aisc.org/Content/ContentGroups/Documents/NSBA5/20_NSBA_LongestSpans.PDF |format=PDF |title=National Steel Bridge Alliance: World's Longest Bridge Spans |last=Durkee |first=Jackson |publisher=American Institute of Steel Construction, Inc |date=1999-05-24 |accessdate=2007-11-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020601114245/http://www.aisc.org/Content/ContentGroups/Documents/NSBA5/20_NSBA_LongestSpans.PDF |archivedate=2002-06-01 }}</ref>\n# [[Quebec Bridge]] ([[Quebec]], [[Canada]], 1919) {{convert|1800|ft|m|0}}\n# [[Forth Bridge]] ([[Firth of Forth]], [[Scotland]], 1890) 2 x {{convert|1710|ft|m|0}}\n# [[Minato Bridge]] ([[Osaka, Japan]], 1973) {{convert|1673|ft|m|0}}\n# [[Commodore Barry Bridge]] ([[Chester, Pennsylvania]], USA, 1974) {{convert|1644|ft|m|0}}\n# [[Crescent City Connection]] (dual spans) ([[New Orleans, Louisiana]], USA, 1958 and 1988) {{convert|1575|ft|m|0}}\n# [[Howrah Bridge]] ([[Kolkata]], [[West Bengal]], India, 1943) {{convert|1500|ft|m|0}}\n# [[Gramercy Bridge]] ([[Gramercy, Louisiana]], USA, 1995) {{convert|1460|ft|m|0}}\n# [[Tokyo Gate Bridge]] ([[Tokyo, Japan]], 2012) {{convert|1443|ft|m|0}}\n# [[J.

In 1751\u201352 Rockingham joined [[White's]], the [[Jockey Club]] and the [[Royal Society]].{{r|hoff|page1=10}}\n\nRockingham's maiden speech was on 17 March 1752 in support of the Bill which disposed of Scottish lands confiscated in the aftermath of the Jacobite rising of 1745. He wanted the lands cultivated by people \"employed in husbandry & handicrafts\" who repudiated \"plunder, rapine & rebellion\". He said \"the highlanders have remained in their ancient state, prolific, bold, idle, & consequently hives of rebellion\". He compared his favoured policy with the policy which his ancestor Lord Strafford had used in Ireland. Rockingham's speech was not well received, with [[Horace Walpole]] criticising him for venturing into \"a debate so much above his force\".{{r|hoff|page1=11}} Rockingham's uncle [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|William Murray]], the Solicitor-General, believed him to be poorly educated so he employed Quarme as Rockingham's tutor again.

The [[Secretary at War]], [[William Barrington, 2nd Viscount Barrington|Lord Barrington]], wrote to him: \"You are the only instance of a Lord lieutenant's exerting the civil authority upon these occasions\".{{r|hoff|page1=21}} Rockingham asked in 1760 to be made a knight of the [[Order of the Garter]] and the King consented.\n\nIn 1760, George II died, and his grandson ascended the throne as [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. Rockingham was allied to the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]] and his supporters, whilst the new King had a favourite in [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]]. Rockingham believed that Bute and his supporters wanted to take \"the whole Administration & Government of this country into their hands\" and wanted Newcastle to resign now before he would be inevitably disposed of. Rockingham believed that the revolution in British politics since George III's accession was harmful to the country, since it removed the Whigs from their ascendancy which had settled the constitution and secured the House of Hanover on the British throne. Rockingham wrote to Newcastle:\n\n<blockquote>...without flattery to your Grace, I must look and ever shall upon you and your connections as the solid foundations on which every good which has happened to this country since the [Glorious] Revolution, have been erected. ... What a medley of government is probably soon to take place & when it does what an alarm will ensue!{{r|hoff|page1=37}}</blockquote>\n\nRockingham resigned as Lord of the Bedchamber on 3 November 1762 in protest at the King's policies and other Whigs associated with the Duke of Newcastle did the same.{{r|hoff|page1=43\u201344}} The next month the King removed Rockingham from the office of Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding, Lord Lieutenant of the city and county of York, as custos rotulorum of the North and West Riding, as custos rotulorum of the city and county of York and as Vice Admiral of [[York]] and county.{{r|hoff|page1=45}}\n\nOver the next several years, Rockingham gradually became the leader of those of Newcastle's supporters who were unwilling to reconcile themselves to the premierships of Bute and his successor, [[George Grenville]].\n\n==Prime Minister: 1765\u20131766==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[First premiership of Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham]], [[First premiership of Lord Rockingham]], [[First premiership of the Marquess of Rockingham]], [[First prime ministership of Lord Rockingham]], [[First prime ministership of the Marquess of Rockingham]] -->\n{{Further|First Rockingham ministry}}\nThe king's dislike, as well as Grenville's general lack of parliamentary support, led to his dismissal in 1765, and, following negotiations conducted through the medium of the king's uncle, the [[Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]], Lord Rockingham was appointed Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Langford |title=The First Rockingham Administration. 1765\u20131766 |url=https://archive.org/details/firstrockinghama0000lang |url-access=registration |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1973 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/firstrockinghama0000lang/page/8 8\u201311]}}</ref> Rockingham recovered the honours of which he had been deprived in 1762.

Also at this time, [[Edmund Burke]], the Irish statesman and philosopher, became his private secretary and would remain a lifelong friend, political ally and advisor until Rockingham's premature death in 1782.\n\nRockingham's administration was dominated by the American issue. Rockingham wished for repeal of the [[Stamp Act 1765]] and won a Commons vote on the repeal resolution by 275 to 167 in 1766.{{r|hoff|page1=113}} However Rockingham also passed the [[Declaratory Act]], which asserted that the British Parliament had the right to legislate for the American colonies in all cases whatsoever.\n\nHowever, internal dissent within the cabinet led to his resignation and the appointment of [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Lord Chatham]] as Prime Minister (the Duke of Grafton was appointed [[First Lord of the Treasury]], one of the few cases in which those two offices were separate).\n\n==Opposition: 1766\u20131782==\n[[File:Charles Watson-Wentworth, Second Marquis of Rockingham.jpg|thumb|upright|Lord Rockingham painted by [[Joshua Reynolds]] in 1768]]\nRockingham spent the next sixteen years in opposition.

The old Rockingham party fragmented, with Fox and the Duke of Portland leading a coalition of Whigs. The Whig party further split over the [[French Revolution]], with Burke writing to Fitzwilliam on 4 January 1797: \"As to our old friends, they are so many individuals, not a jot more separated from your Lordship, than they are from one another. There is no mutual affection, communication, or concert between them\".{{r|hoff|page1=385}}\n\nThe Whig historian [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]] was an admirer of Rockingham and his Whig faction:\n\n{{quote|They were men worthy to have charged by the side of [[John Hampden|Hampden]] at [[Battle of Chalgrove|Chalgrove]], or to have exchanged the last embrace with [[William Russell, Lord Russell|Russell]] on the scaffold in Lincoln's Inn Fields. They carried into politics the same high principles of virtue which regulated their private dealings, nor would they stoop to promote even the noblest and most salutary ends by means which honour and probity condemn. Such men were Lord John Cavendish, Sir George Savile, and others whom we hold in honour as the second founders of the Whig party, as the restorers of its pristine health and energy after half a century of degeneracy. The chief of this respectable band was the Marquess of Rockingham, a man of splendid fortune, excellent sense, and stainless character. He was indeed nervous to such a degree that, to the very close of his life, he never rose without great reluctance and embarrassment to address the House of Lords. But, though not a great orator, he had in a high degree some of the qualities of a statesman. He chose his friends well; and he had, in an extraordinary degree, the art of attaching them to him by ties of the most honourable kind.

He became the patron of many Whigs, known as the [[Rockingham Whigs]], and served as a leading Whig grandee. He served in only two high offices during his lifetime (Prime Minister and [[Leader of the House of Lords]]), but was nonetheless very influential during his one and a half years of service.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life: 1730\u20131751==\nA descendant of the [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|1st Earl of Strafford]], Lord Rockingham was brought up at the family home of [[Wentworth Woodhouse]] near [[Rotherham]]<ref name=\"York1911\"/> in [[Yorkshire]].

Rockingham did this without parental consent and Cumberland wrote to Rockingham's father, saying that his \"zeal on this occasion shows the same principles fix't that you yourself have given such strong proofs of\".{{r|hoff|page1=3}} Rockingham wrote to his father that Cumberland \"blamed me for my disobedience, yet as I came with a design of saving my King and country...it greatly palliated my offence\".{{r|hoff|page1=3}} Rockingham's mother wrote to his father: \"Though I hope you won't tell it him, never any thing met with such general applause, in short he is the hero of these times, and his Majesty talks of this young Subject, in such terms, as must please you to hear...in the Drawing Room<ref>The British royal morning receptions that the French called  ''[[Lev\u00e9e (ceremony)|lev\u00e9e]]s'' were called \"drawing rooms\", with the sense originally that the privileged members of court would gather in the drawing room outside the king's bedroom, where he would make his first formal public appearance of the day.</ref> no two people talk together, but he makes part of the discourse\".{{r|hoff|page1=4}}\n\nIn April 1746 Rockingham's father was made a [[marquess]] (remaining the only [[marquess]] in the British peerage for quite some time) and Rockingham himself assumed the courtesy title of Earl of Malton. These honours came about due to the patronage of [[Henry Pelham]].{{r|hoff|page1=4}} At this time Rockingham was travelling across Europe under the tutorship of George Quarme, as his father had decided against sending him to Cambridge.{{r|hoff|page1=5\u20139}}<ref>Rigg (1899) has him attending [[St John's College, Cambridge]]. However, there is no mention of him in ''[[Alumni Cantabrigienses]]'', and the ''DNB'' is not followed in this detail by the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford DNB]]''.</ref> During his stay in Rome, Rockingham noted that amongst Englishmen Whigs outnumbered Jacobites four-to-one and there were \"no Persons of rank about the Pretender\" and that \"the vile spirit of Jacobitism\" was greatly declining.{{r|hoff|page1=8}} When in [[Herrenhausen]], [[Hanover]] Rockingham met George II and made an impression: the King told Rockingham's uncle Henry Finch that he had never seen a finer or a more promising youth.{{r|hoff|page1=9}} In September 1750, two months before his father's death, he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland in his own right as Baron Malton and Earl Malton.\n\n==Early political career: 1751\u201365==\n[[File:Young Marquess of Rockingham.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A young Rockingham]]\nOn 13 May 1751 (his 21st birthday), Rockingham inherited his father's estates. The rents from the land in Yorkshire, Northamptonshire and Ireland gave him an annual income of \u00a320,000 ({{Inflation|UK|20000|1751|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} He also controlled both of the borough parliamentary seats of [[Malton (UK Parliament constituency)|Malton]] and one seat for the single-member borough of [[Higham Ferrers (UK Parliament constituency)|Higham Ferrers]] (Northants), along with twenty-three livings and five chaplaincies in the church.{{r|hoff|page1=10}} In July he was appointed Lord Lieutenant and [[custos rotulorum]] of the West Riding in Yorkshire, Lord Lieutenant of York city, and custos rotulorum of York city and county. In 1751\u201352 Rockingham joined [[White's]], the [[Jockey Club]] and the [[Royal Society]].{{r|hoff|page1=10}}\n\nRockingham's maiden speech was on 17 March 1752 in support of the Bill which disposed of Scottish lands confiscated in the aftermath of the Jacobite rising of 1745. He wanted the lands cultivated by people \"employed in husbandry & handicrafts\" who repudiated \"plunder, rapine & rebellion\". He said \"the highlanders have remained in their ancient state, prolific, bold, idle, & consequently hives of rebellion\". He compared his favoured policy with the policy which his ancestor Lord Strafford had used in Ireland. Rockingham's speech was not well received, with [[Horace Walpole]] criticising him for venturing into \"a debate so much above his force\".{{r|hoff|page1=11}} Rockingham's uncle [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|William Murray]], the Solicitor-General, believed him to be poorly educated so he employed Quarme as Rockingham's tutor again. Rockingham was for four months to study [[Demosthenes]] for oratory, to learn the histories of the Assyrian, Persian, Greek and Roman empires along with modern history. Murray wanted Rockingham to take after Sir [[Walter Raleigh]].{{r|hoff|page1=11}}\n\n[[File:Mary Bright.jpg|thumb|upright|Charles Watson-Wentworth married Mary Bright (pictured) in 1752]]\n\nIn 1752, Rockingham was appointed [[Gentleman of the Bedchamber|Lord of the Bedchamber]] to George II and married Mary Bright.<ref>{{Cite ODNB|id=68349|title=Wentworth, Mary Watson-}}</ref> In 1753 the Rockingham Club was formed, containing the first Rockingham Whigs.

The club held monthly meetings and a list written in June 1754 showed it had 133 members.{{r|hoff|page1=20}} In 1755 the King appointed him to the honorary office of Vice Admiral of the North.{{r|hoff|page1=21}} During a French [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|invasion scare]] in 1756 Rockingham raised a volunteer militia at his own expense and when rioting broke out against Army enlistments Rockingham restored order without the use of military force in Sheffield. The [[Secretary at War]], [[William Barrington, 2nd Viscount Barrington|Lord Barrington]], wrote to him: \"You are the only instance of a Lord lieutenant's exerting the civil authority upon these occasions\".{{r|hoff|page1=21}} Rockingham asked in 1760 to be made a knight of the [[Order of the Garter]] and the King consented.\n\nIn 1760, George II died, and his grandson ascended the throne as [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. Rockingham was allied to the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]] and his supporters, whilst the new King had a favourite in [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]]. Rockingham believed that Bute and his supporters wanted to take \"the whole Administration & Government of this country into their hands\" and wanted Newcastle to resign now before he would be inevitably disposed of. Rockingham believed that the revolution in British politics since George III's accession was harmful to the country, since it removed the Whigs from their ascendancy which had settled the constitution and secured the House of Hanover on the British throne. Rockingham wrote to Newcastle:\n\n<blockquote>...without flattery to your Grace, I must look and ever shall upon you and your connections as the solid foundations on which every good which has happened to this country since the [Glorious] Revolution, have been erected. ... What a medley of government is probably soon to take place & when it does what an alarm will ensue!{{r|hoff|page1=37}}</blockquote>\n\nRockingham resigned as Lord of the Bedchamber on 3 November 1762 in protest at the King's policies and other Whigs associated with the Duke of Newcastle did the same.{{r|hoff|page1=43\u201344}} The next month the King removed Rockingham from the office of Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding, Lord Lieutenant of the city and county of York, as custos rotulorum of the North and West Riding, as custos rotulorum of the city and county of York and as Vice Admiral of [[York]] and county.{{r|hoff|page1=45}}\n\nOver the next several years, Rockingham gradually became the leader of those of Newcastle's supporters who were unwilling to reconcile themselves to the premierships of Bute and his successor, [[George Grenville]].\n\n==Prime Minister: 1765\u20131766==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[First premiership of Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham]], [[First premiership of Lord Rockingham]], [[First premiership of the Marquess of Rockingham]], [[First prime ministership of Lord Rockingham]], [[First prime ministership of the Marquess of Rockingham]] -->\n{{Further|First Rockingham ministry}}\nThe king's dislike, as well as Grenville's general lack of parliamentary support, led to his dismissal in 1765, and, following negotiations conducted through the medium of the king's uncle, the [[Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]], Lord Rockingham was appointed Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Langford |title=The First Rockingham Administration. 1765\u20131766 |url=https://archive.org/details/firstrockinghama0000lang |url-access=registration |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1973 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/firstrockinghama0000lang/page/8 8\u201311]}}</ref> Rockingham recovered the honours of which he had been deprived in 1762. Rockingham appointed his allies [[Henry Seymour Conway]] and the [[Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton|Duke of Grafton]] as [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|secretaries of state]]. Also at this time, [[Edmund Burke]], the Irish statesman and philosopher, became his private secretary and would remain a lifelong friend, political ally and advisor until Rockingham's premature death in 1782.\n\nRockingham's administration was dominated by the American issue. Rockingham wished for repeal of the [[Stamp Act 1765]] and won a Commons vote on the repeal resolution by 275 to 167 in 1766.{{r|hoff|page1=113}} However Rockingham also passed the [[Declaratory Act]], which asserted that the British Parliament had the right to legislate for the American colonies in all cases whatsoever.\n\nHowever, internal dissent within the cabinet led to his resignation and the appointment of [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|Lord Chatham]] as Prime Minister (the Duke of Grafton was appointed [[First Lord of the Treasury]], one of the few cases in which those two offices were separate).\n\n==Opposition: 1766\u20131782==\n[[File:Charles Watson-Wentworth, Second Marquis of Rockingham.jpg|thumb|upright|Lord Rockingham painted by [[Joshua Reynolds]] in 1768]]\nRockingham spent the next sixteen years in opposition. He was a keen supporter of constitutional rights for colonists.\n\nRockingham wrote to [[Edmund Burke]] on 14 February 1771: \"I fear indeed the future struggles of the people in defence of their Constitutional Rights will grow weaker and weaker. It is much too probable that the power and influence of the Crown will increase rapidly.

Burke wrote to Fitzwilliam on 3 July 1782: \"You are Lord Rockingham in every thing. ... I have no doubt that you will take it in good part, that his old friends, who were attached to him by every tie of affection, and of principle, and among others myself, should look to you, and should not think it an act of forwardness and intrusion to offer you their services\".{{r|hoff|page1=383}} On 7 July 150 supporters of Rockingham met at Fitzwilliam's house and decided to withdraw support for Lord Shelburne's administration. The old Rockingham party fragmented, with Fox and the Duke of Portland leading a coalition of Whigs. The Whig party further split over the [[French Revolution]], with Burke writing to Fitzwilliam on 4 January 1797: \"As to our old friends, they are so many individuals, not a jot more separated from your Lordship, than they are from one another. There is no mutual affection, communication, or concert between them\".{{r|hoff|page1=385}}\n\nThe Whig historian [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]] was an admirer of Rockingham and his Whig faction:\n\n{{quote|They were men worthy to have charged by the side of [[John Hampden|Hampden]] at [[Battle of Chalgrove|Chalgrove]], or to have exchanged the last embrace with [[William Russell, Lord Russell|Russell]] on the scaffold in Lincoln's Inn Fields. They carried into politics the same high principles of virtue which regulated their private dealings, nor would they stoop to promote even the noblest and most salutary ends by means which honour and probity condemn. Such men were Lord John Cavendish, Sir George Savile, and others whom we hold in honour as the second founders of the Whig party, as the restorers of its pristine health and energy after half a century of degeneracy. The chief of this respectable band was the Marquess of Rockingham, a man of splendid fortune, excellent sense, and stainless character. He was indeed nervous to such a degree that, to the very close of his life, he never rose without great reluctance and embarrassment to address the House of Lords. But, though not a great orator, he had in a high degree some of the qualities of a statesman. He chose his friends well; and he had, in an extraordinary degree, the art of attaching them to him by ties of the most honourable kind. The cheerful fidelity with which they adhered to him through many years of almost hopeless opposition was less admirable than the disinterestedness and delicacy which they showed when he rose to power.<ref>{{cite news |first=Thomas Babington |last=Macaulay |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2332/pg2332.html |title=The Earl of Chatham |work=Edinburgh Review |date=October 1844}}</ref>}}\n\n===Places named after Lord Rockingham===\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n'''Canada'''\n* [[Rockingham, Nova Scotia]]\n{{Col-break}}\n'''United States'''\n* [[Rockingham County, New Hampshire]]\n* [[Rockingham County, North Carolina]]\n* [[Rockingham County, Virginia]]\n* [[Rockingham, Vermont]]\n* [[Rockingham, North Carolina]]\n* [[Wentworth, North Carolina]]\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Cabinets of Lord Rockingham==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n\n===1765\u20131766===\n{{transcluded section|source=First Rockingham ministry}}\n{{#section::First Rockingham ministry|July 1765 to July 1766}}\n\n===1782===\n{{transcluded section|source=Second Rockingham ministry}}\n{{#section::Second Rockingham ministry|March to July 1782}}\n\n==Titles==\n*The Hon.

It was released by [[Warner Records]] as the album's [[lead single]] on 31 October 2019. Lipa wrote the track with [[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]], and its producer [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. Inspired by music by the [[Bee Gees]] and [[Daft Punk]], \"Don't Start Now\" is a [[nu-disco]] song with several [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] elements. It is built around a percolating [[Funk music|funk]] [[bassline]] and [[Accent (music)|accented]] disco strings. In the lyrics, Lipa addresses a former lover about moving on from their breakup. \n\n\"Don't Start Now\" received acclaim from music critics upon release, with many noting a significant growth in Lipa's sound and identity as a singer. The song was a commercial success worldwide, charting in the top 10 in over 40 different countries. It peaked at number two on both the [[UK Singles Chart]] and US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], surpassing 2017's \"[[New Rules]]\" to become Lipa's highest-charting single in the US. The music video for \"Don't Start Now\" was directed by [[Nabil Elderkin]], and shows Lipa passing through a basement nightclub and masked ball. To promote the single, the singer performed it on many television programmes, and at several awards shows, including the [[2019 MTV Europe Music Awards]] and [[American Music Awards of 2019|2019 American Music Awards]].\n\n==Background==\nLipa co-wrote \"Don't Start Now\" with the same team who wrote her 2017 single \"[[New Rules]]\": [[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]] and [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. She said working with them again naturally made her choose it as ''[[Future Nostalgia (Dua Lipa album)|Future Nostalgia]]''{{'}}s [[lead single]] to \"close one chapter of my life and start another\" with a \"new sound\".<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/dua-lipa-shares-snippet-of-new-track-dont-start-now-album-2559838|title=Dua Lipa shares new disco-tinged single 'Don't Start Now'|last=Skinner|first=Tom|website=[[NME]]|date=1 November 2019|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> \"Don't Start Now\" first came about after the [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] head at Lipa's record label, Joe Kentish, challenged Kirkpatrick in late 2018 to produce another track for the singer following the success of \"New Rules\".<ref name=\"Billboard Interview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/news/9350891/producer-ian-kirkpatrick-interview|title=Producer Ian Kirkpatrick on Chart Success During Quarantine: 'It's a Very Strange Duality'|last=LeDonne|first=Rob|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=6 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> The song was first composed at Ailin's home in [[Wyoming]].<ref name=\"SU\">{{cite web|url=https://www.songwriteruniverse.com/ian-kirkpatrick-songwriter-2020.htm|title=Ian Kirkpatrick Interview - Hit Songwriter and Producer|last=Kawashima|first=Dale|website=Songwriter Universe|date=20 February 2020|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> Kirkpatrick recalls it being \"a back and forth\" between the [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] sound that Lipa envisioned.

It was released by [[Warner Records]] as the album's [[lead single]] on 31 October 2019. Lipa wrote the track with [[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]], and its producer [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. Inspired by music by the [[Bee Gees]] and [[Daft Punk]], \"Don't Start Now\" is a [[nu-disco]] song with several [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] elements. It is built around a percolating [[Funk music|funk]] [[bassline]] and [[Accent (music)|accented]] disco strings. In the lyrics, Lipa addresses a former lover about moving on from their breakup. \n\n\"Don't Start Now\" received acclaim from music critics upon release, with many noting a significant growth in Lipa's sound and identity as a singer. The song was a commercial success worldwide, charting in the top 10 in over 40 different countries. It peaked at number two on both the [[UK Singles Chart]] and US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], surpassing 2017's \"[[New Rules]]\" to become Lipa's highest-charting single in the US. The music video for \"Don't Start Now\" was directed by [[Nabil Elderkin]], and shows Lipa passing through a basement nightclub and masked ball. To promote the single, the singer performed it on many television programmes, and at several awards shows, including the [[2019 MTV Europe Music Awards]] and [[American Music Awards of 2019|2019 American Music Awards]].\n\n==Background==\nLipa co-wrote \"Don't Start Now\" with the same team who wrote her 2017 single \"[[New Rules]]\": [[Caroline Ailin]], [[Emily Warren]] and [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. She said working with them again naturally made her choose it as ''[[Future Nostalgia (Dua Lipa album)|Future Nostalgia]]''{{'}}s [[lead single]] to \"close one chapter of my life and start another\" with a \"new sound\".<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/dua-lipa-shares-snippet-of-new-track-dont-start-now-album-2559838|title=Dua Lipa shares new disco-tinged single 'Don't Start Now'|last=Skinner|first=Tom|website=[[NME]]|date=1 November 2019|accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> \"Don't Start Now\" first came about after the [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] head at Lipa's record label, Joe Kentish, challenged Kirkpatrick in late 2018 to produce another track for the singer following the success of \"New Rules\".<ref name=\"Billboard Interview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/news/9350891/producer-ian-kirkpatrick-interview|title=Producer Ian Kirkpatrick on Chart Success During Quarantine: 'It's a Very Strange Duality'|last=LeDonne|first=Rob|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=6 April 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref> The song was first composed at Ailin's home in [[Wyoming]].<ref name=\"SU\">{{cite web|url=https://www.songwriteruniverse.com/ian-kirkpatrick-songwriter-2020.htm|title=Ian Kirkpatrick Interview - Hit Songwriter and Producer|last=Kawashima|first=Dale|website=Songwriter Universe|date=20 February 2020|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> Kirkpatrick recalls it being \"a back and forth\" between the [[1980s in music|1980s]] and [[disco]] sound that Lipa envisioned. Producer J Kash was involved during initial writing sessions.<ref name=\"Billboard Interview\"/>\n\nThe lyrics were written in January 2019 with a \"dance-around-the-room attitude\". Kirkpatrick included the use of a [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]] in the first [[Demo (music)|demo]], based on phrasing in the chorus and inspired by music by [[Two Door Cinema Club]].
