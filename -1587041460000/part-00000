He was [[Emperor of the French]] as '''Napoleon I''' from 1804 until 1814 and again briefly in 1815 during the [[Hundred Days]]. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a [[First French Empire|large empire]] that ruled over much of continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. He is considered one of the greatest commanders in history, and his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy has endured as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history.<ref name=\"Roberts, Andrew 2014\">Roberts, Andrew. ''Napoleon: A Life''.

He was serving as an artillery officer in the French army when the French Revolution erupted in 1789. He rapidly rose through the ranks of the military, seizing the new opportunities presented by the Revolution and becoming a general at age 24. The [[French Directory]] eventually gave him command of the [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]] after he suppressed the [[13 Vend\u00e9miaire]] revolt against the government from royalist insurgents. At age 26, he began his [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|first military campaign]] against the Austrians and the Italian monarchs aligned with the Habsburgs\u2014winning virtually every battle, conquering the Italian Peninsula in a year while establishing \"[[sister republic]]s\" with local support, and becoming a war hero in France. In 1798, he led a [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|military expedition to Egypt]] that served as a springboard to political power. He orchestrated a [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|coup in November 1799]] and became [[French Consulate|First Consul]] of the Republic. After the Peace of Amiens in 1802, Napoleon turned his attention to France's colonies. He sold the [[Louisiana Territory]] to the United States, and he attempted to restore slavery to the French Caribbean colonies. However, while he was successful in restoring slavery in the eastern Caribbean, Napoleon failed in his attempts to subdue [[Saint-Domingue]], and the colony that France once proudly boasted of as the \"Pearl of the Antilles\" became independent as [[Haiti]] in 1804. Napoleon's ambition and public approval inspired him to go further, and he became the first Emperor of the French in 1804. Intractable differences with the British meant that the French were facing a [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]] by 1805. Napoleon shattered this coalition with decisive victories in the [[Ulm Campaign]] and a historic triumph over the [[Russian Empire]] and [[Austrian Empire]] at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] which led to the [[dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire]]. In 1806, the [[War of the Fourth Coalition|Fourth Coalition]] took up arms against him because [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] became worried about growing French influence on the continent. Napoleon quickly defeated Prussia at the [[Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt|battles of Jena and Auerstedt]], then marched his ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'' deep into [[Eastern Europe]] and annihilated the Russians in June 1807 at the [[Battle of Friedland]]. France then forced the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to sign the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] in July 1807, bringing an uneasy peace to the continent. Tilsit signified the high-water mark of the French Empire. In 1809, the Austrians and the British challenged the French again during the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]], but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the [[Battle of Wagram]] in July.\n\nNapoleon then [[Napoleonic invasion of Iberia|occupied the Iberian Peninsula]], hoping to extend the [[Continental System]] and choke off British trade with the European mainland, and declared his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]] the [[King of Spain]] in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted with British support. The [[Peninsular War]] lasted six years, featured extensive [[guerrilla warfare]], and ended in victory for the Allies against Napoleon. The Continental System caused recurring diplomatic conflicts between France and its client states, especially Russia. The Russians were unwilling to bear the economic consequences of reduced trade and routinely violated the Continental System, enticing Napoleon into another war. The French launched a major [[French invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]] in the summer of 1812. The campaign destroyed Russian cities, but did not yield the decisive victory Napoleon wanted. It resulted in the collapse of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' and inspired a renewed push against Napoleon by his enemies. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] against France. A lengthy military campaign culminated in a large Allied army defeating Napoleon at the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in October 1813, but his tactical victory at the minor [[Battle of Hanau]] allowed retreat onto French soil. The Allies then [[1814 campaign in France|invaded France]] and captured Paris in the spring of 1814, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April. He was exiled to the island of [[Elba]] off the coast of [[Tuscany]], and the [[Bourbon dynasty]] was [[Bourbon Restoration|restored to power]]. Napoleon escaped from Elba in February 1815 and took control of France once again. The Allies responded by forming a [[War of the Seventh Coalition|Seventh Coalition]] which defeated him at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in June. The British exiled him to the remote island of [[Saint Helena]] in the South Atlantic, where he died six years later at the age of 51.\n\nNapoleon's influence on the modern world brought liberal reforms to the numerous territories that he conquered and controlled, such as the [[Low Countries]], [[Switzerland]], and large parts of modern [[Italy]] and [[Germany]]. He implemented fundamental liberal policies in France and throughout Western Europe. His [[Napoleonic Code]] has influenced the legal systems of more than 70 nations around the world. British historian [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]] states: \"The ideas that underpin our modern world\u2014meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on\u2014were championed, consolidated, codified and geographically extended by Napoleon. To them he added a rational and efficient local administration, an end to rural banditry, the encouragement of science and the arts, the abolition of feudalism and the greatest codification of laws since the [[fall of the Roman Empire]]\".<ref>Andrew Roberts, ''Napoleon: A Life'' (2014), p. xxxiii.</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Carlo Buonaparte.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Half-length portrait of a wigged middle-aged man with a well-to-do jacket.

He immediately went on the offensive, hoping to defeat the forces of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont]] before their Austrian allies could intervene. In a series of rapid victories during the [[Montenotte Campaign]], he knocked Piedmont out of the war in two weeks. The French then focused on the Austrians for the remainder of the war, the highlight of which became the protracted [[Siege of Mantua (1796\u201397)|struggle for Mantua]]. The Austrians launched a series of offensives against the French to break the siege, but Napoleon defeated every relief effort, scoring victories at the battles of [[Battle of Castiglione|Castiglione]], [[Battle of Bassano|Bassano]], [[Battle of Arcole|Arcole]], and [[Battle of Rivoli|Rivoli]]. The decisive French triumph at Rivoli in January 1797 led to the collapse of the Austrian position in Italy. At Rivoli, the Austrians lost up to 14,000 men while the French lost about 5,000.{{sfn|Bell|2015|p=29}}\n\nThe next phase of the campaign featured the French invasion of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] heartlands. French forces in Southern Germany had been defeated by the [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]] in 1796, but the Archduke withdrew his forces to protect Vienna after learning about Napoleon's assault. In the first encounter between the two commanders, Napoleon pushed back his opponent and advanced deep into Austrian territory after winning at the [[Battle of Tarvis (1797)|Battle of Tarvis]] in March 1797. The Austrians were alarmed by the French thrust that reached all the way to [[Leoben]], about 100&nbsp;km from Vienna, and finally decided to sue for peace.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|pp=284\u201385}}</ref> The [[Treaty of Leoben]], followed by the more comprehensive [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], gave France control of most of northern Italy and the [[Low Countries]], and a secret clause promised the [[Republic of Venice]] to Austria.

At the [[Battle of Austerlitz]], in [[Moravia]] on 2 December, he deployed the French army below the Pratzen Heights and deliberately weakened his right flank, enticing the Allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling up the whole French line.

France and Austria agreed to an armistice immediately and the Treaty of Pressburg followed shortly after on 26 December. Pressburg took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of [[Treaty of Campo Formio|Campo Formio]] and of [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville|Lun\u00e9ville]] between the two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian loss of lands to France in [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italy]] and [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]], and lands in Germany to Napoleon's German allies.

Wiping out half of Prussian territories from the map, Napoleon created a new kingdom of {{convert|1100|sqmi|km2|order=flip}} called [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]] and appointed his young brother J\u00e9r\u00f4me as its monarch. Prussia's humiliating treatment at Tilsit caused a deep and bitter antagonism which festered as the [[Napoleonic era]] progressed. Moreover, Alexander's pretensions at friendship with Napoleon led the latter to seriously misjudge the true intentions of his Russian counterpart, who would violate numerous provisions of the treaty in the next few years. Despite these problems, the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] at last gave Napoleon a respite from war and allowed him to return to France, which he had not seen in over 300 days.{{sfn|Roberts|2014|pages=459\u201361}}\n\n==== Peninsular War and Erfurt ====\n{{Main|Peninsular War}}\nThe settlements at Tilsit gave Napoleon time to organize his empire. One of his major objectives became enforcing the Continental System against the British. He decided to focus his attention on the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], which consistently violated his trade prohibitions. After defeat in the [[War of the Oranges]] in 1801, Portugal adopted a double-sided policy. At first, [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]] agreed to close his ports to British trade. The situation changed dramatically after the Franco-Spanish defeat at Trafalgar; John grew bolder and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations with Britain.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n[[File:Joseph-Bonaparte.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Bonaparte]], Napoleon's brother, as King of Spain]]\n\nUnhappy with this change of policy by the Portuguese government, Napoleon negotiated a [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1807)|secret treaty]] with [[Charles IV of Spain]] and sent an army to invade Portugal.<ref>{{cite book |last=Horne |first=Alistair |author-link=Alistair Horne |title=How Far From Austerlitz?

Throughout the winter of 1808, French agents became increasingly involved in Spanish internal affairs, attempting to incite discord between members of the [[House of Bourbon|Spanish royal family]]. On 16 February 1808, secret French machinations finally materialized when Napoleon announced that he would intervene to mediate between the rival political factions in the country.<ref>Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 198\u201399.</ref>\n\n[[Joachim Murat|Marshal Murat]] led 120,000 troops into Spain. The French arrived in [[Madrid]] on 24 March,<ref>Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 199.</ref> where wild riots against the occupation erupted just a few weeks later. Napoleon appointed his brother, [[Joseph Bonaparte]], as the new King of Spain in the summer of 1808. The appointment enraged a heavily religious and conservative Spanish population. Resistance to French aggression soon spread throughout Spain. The shocking French defeat at the [[Battle of Bail\u00e9n]] in July gave hope to Napoleon's enemies and partly persuaded the French emperor to intervene in person.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nBefore going to Iberia, Napoleon decided to address several lingering issues with the Russians. At the [[Congress of Erfurt]] in October 1808, Napoleon hoped to keep Russia on his side during the upcoming struggle in Spain and during any potential conflict against Austria. The two sides reached an agreement, the Erfurt Convention, that called upon Britain to cease its war against France, that recognized the Russian conquest of [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]] from [[Kingdom of Sweden (1721\u20131809)|Sweden]], and that affirmed Russian support for France in a possible war against Austria \"to the best of its ability\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c_erfurt.html |title=The Erfurt Convention 1808 |publisher=Napoleon-series.org |accessdate=22 April 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021094131/http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c_erfurt.html |archivedate=21 October 2013  }}</ref>\n\nNapoleon then returned to France and prepared for war. The ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', under the Emperor's personal command, rapidly crossed the [[Ebro]] River in November 1808 and inflicted a series of crushing defeats against the Spanish forces. After clearing the last Spanish force guarding the capital at [[Battle of Somosierra|Somosierra]], Napoleon entered Madrid on 4 December with 80,000 troops.<ref>Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 205.</ref> He then unleashed his soldiers against [[John Moore (British soldier)|Moore]] and the British forces. The British were swiftly driven to the coast, and they withdrew from Spain entirely after a last stand at the [[Battle of Corunna]] in January 1809.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n[[File:Antoine-Jean Gros - Capitulation de Madrid, le 4 d\u00e9cembre 1808.jpg|thumb|Napoleon accepting the surrender of [[Madrid]], 4 December 1808]]\nNapoleon would end up leaving Iberia in order to deal with the Austrians in Central Europe, but the Peninsular War continued on long after his absence. He never returned to Spain after the 1808 campaign. Several months after Corunna, the British sent another army to the peninsula under the future [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. The war then settled into a complex and asymmetric strategic deadlock where all sides struggled to gain the upper hand. The highlight of the conflict became the brutal ''[[guerrilla warfare]]'' that engulfed much of the Spanish countryside. Both sides committed the worst atrocities of the Napoleonic Wars during this phase of the conflict.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|pp=659\u201360}}</ref>\n\nThe vicious guerrilla fighting in Spain, largely absent from the French campaigns in Central Europe, severely disrupted the French lines of supply and communication. Although France maintained roughly 300,000 troops in Iberia during the Peninsular War, the vast majority were tied down to garrison duty and to intelligence operations.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The French were never able to concentrate all of their forces effectively, prolonging the war until events elsewhere in Europe finally turned the tide in favour of the Allies. After the invasion of Russia in 1812, the number of French troops in Spain vastly declined as Napoleon needed reinforcements to conserve his strategic position in Europe. By 1814, after scores of battles and sieges throughout Iberia, the Allies had managed to push the French out of the peninsula.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe impact of the Napoleonic invasion of Spain and ousting of the Spanish Bourbon monarchy in favour of his brother Joseph had an enormous impact on the [[Spanish empire]]. In [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]] many local elites formed juntas and set up mechanisms to rule in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]], whom they considered the legitimate Spanish monarch. The outbreak of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] in most of the empire was a result of Napoleon's destabilizing actions in Spain and led to the rise of [[Strongman (politics)|strongmen]] in the wake of these wars.<ref>[[John Lynch (historian)|John Lynch]], ''Caudillos in Spanish America 1800\u20131850''.

Austria could not count on Russian support because the latter was at war with [[Anglo-Russian War (1807\u20131812)|Britain]], [[Finnish War|Sweden]], and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806\u20131812)|Ottoman Empire]] in 1809. [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William]] of Prussia initially promised to help the Austrians, but reneged before conflict began.<ref name=\"Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 106\">Fisher & Fremont-Barnes, p. 106.</ref> A report from the Austrian finance minister suggested that the treasury would run out of money by the middle of 1809 if the large army that the Austrians had formed since the Third Coalition remained mobilized.<ref name=\"Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 106\" /> Although [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]] warned that the Austrians were not ready for another showdown with Napoleon, a stance that landed him in the so-called \"peace party\", he did not want to see the army demobilized either.<ref name=\"Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 106\" /> On 8 February 1809, the advocates for war finally succeeded when the Imperial Government secretly decided on another confrontation against the French.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn the early morning of 10 April, leading elements of the Austrian army crossed the [[Inn River]] and invaded Bavaria. The early Austrian attack surprised the French; Napoleon himself was still in Paris when he heard about the invasion. He arrived at [[Donauw\u00f6rth]] on the 17th to find the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' in a dangerous position, with its two wings separated by {{convert|75|mi|km|sigfig=2|order=flip|abbr=on}} and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated ''Landshut Maneuver''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=690}}</ref> He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of [[Eckm\u00fchl]]. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting [[Battle of Eckm\u00fchl]], forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the [[Danube]] and into [[Bohemia]]. On 13 May, Vienna fell for the second time in four years, although the war continued since most of the Austrian army had survived the initial engagements in Southern Germany.\n\n[[File:Wigand-Entry of Napoleon in Sch\u00f6nbrunn.jpg|thumb|The entry of Napoleon in [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace|Sch\u00f6nbrunn]], Vienna]]\nBy 17 May, the main Austrian army under Charles had arrived on the Marchfeld. Charles kept the bulk of his troops several kilometres away from the river bank in hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross. On 21 May, the French made their first major effort to cross the Danube, precipitating the [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]]. The Austrians enjoyed a comfortable numerical superiority over the French throughout the battle. On the first day, Charles disposed of 110,000 soldiers against only 31,000 commanded by Napoleon.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=701}}</ref> By the second day, reinforcements had boosted French numbers up to 70,000.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=705}}</ref>\n\nThe battle was characterized by a vicious back-and-forth struggle for the two villages of Aspern and Essling, the focal points of the French bridgehead. By the end of the fighting, the French had lost Aspern but still controlled Essling. A sustained Austrian artillery bombardment eventually convinced Napoleon to withdraw his forces back onto Lobau Island. Both sides inflicted about 23,000 casualties on each other.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=706}}</ref> It was the first defeat Napoleon suffered in a major set-piece battle, and it caused excitement throughout many parts of Europe because it proved that he could be beaten on the battlefield.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=707}}</ref>\n\nAfter the setback at Aspern-Essling, Napoleon took more than six weeks in planning and preparing for contingencies before he made another attempt at crossing the Danube.<ref name=\"David G.

The British army only landed at [[Walcheren]] on 30 July, by which point the Austrians had already been defeated. The Walcheren Campaign was characterized by little fighting but heavy casualties thanks to the popularly dubbed \"[[Walcheren Fever]]\".

Emperor Francis wanted to wait and see how the British performed in their theatre before entering into negotiations with Napoleon. Once it became apparent that the British were going nowhere, the Austrians agreed to peace talks.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe resulting [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn]] in October 1809 was the harshest that France had imposed on Austria in recent memory. [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]] and Archduke Charles had the preservation of the [[Austrian Empire|Habsburg Empire]] as their fundamental goal, and to this end they succeeded by making Napoleon seek more modest goals in return for promises of friendship between the two powers.<ref name=\"Todd Fisher p. 144\">Todd Fisher & Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ''The Napoleonic Wars: The Rise and Fall of an Empire''. p. 144.</ref> Nevertheless, while most of the hereditary lands remained a part of the Habsburg realm, France received [[Carinthia (province)|Carinthia]], [[Carniola]], and the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] ports, while [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] was given to the [[Duchy of Warsaw|Poles]] and the [[Salzburg]] area of the [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] went to the [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavarians]].<ref name=\"Todd Fisher p. 144\" /> Austria lost over three million subjects, about one-fifth of her total population, as a result of these territorial changes.<ref>David G.

[[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais|Empress Jos\u00e9phine]] had still not given birth to a child from Napoleon, who became worried about the future of his empire following his death. Desperate for a legitimate heir, Napoleon divorced Jos\u00e9phine on 10 January 1810 and started looking for a new wife. Hoping to cement the recent alliance with Austria through a family connection, Napoleon married the [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma]], daughter of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], who was 18 years old at the time. On 20 March 1811, Marie Louise gave birth to a baby boy, whom Napoleon made heir apparent and bestowed the title of ''[[King of the Romans|King of Rome]]''. His son never actually ruled the empire, but given his brief titular rule and cousin Louis-Napol\u00e9on's subsequent naming himself Napol\u00e9on III, historians often refer to him as ''[[Napoleon II]]''.<ref>David Watkin, ''The Roman Forum''.

The leaders had a friendly personal relationship after their first meeting at Tilsit in 1807.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=378}}</ref> By 1811, however, tensions had increased and Alexander was under pressure from the [[Russian nobility]] to break off the alliance.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} A major strain on the relationship between the two nations became the regular violations of the Continental System by the Russians, which led Napoleon to threaten Alexander with serious consequences if he formed an alliance with Britain.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=495}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Napoleon in burning Moscow - Adam Albrecht (1841).jpg|thumb|Napoleon watching the [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|fire of Moscow]] in September 1812, by Adam Albrecht (1841)]]\n[[File:Napoleons retreat from moscow.jpg|thumb|''Napoleon's withdrawal from Russia'', painting by [[Adolph Northen]]]]\n\nBy 1812, advisers to Alexander suggested the possibility of an invasion of the French Empire and the recapture of Poland. On receipt of intelligence reports on Russia's war preparations, Napoleon expanded his ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' to more than 450,000 men.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=507}}</ref> He ignored repeated advice against an invasion of the Russian heartland and prepared for an offensive campaign; on 24 June 1812 the invasion commenced.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=506}}</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to gain increased support from Polish nationalists and patriots, Napoleon termed the war the ''Second Polish War''\u2014the ''First Polish War'' had been the [[Bar Confederation]] uprising by Polish nobles against Russia in 1768. Polish patriots wanted the Russian part of Poland to be joined with the Duchy of Warsaw and an independent Poland created. This was rejected by Napoleon, who stated he had promised his ally Austria this would not happen. Napoleon refused to [[manumission|manumit]] the Russian [[serf]]s because of concerns this might provoke a reaction in his army's rear. The serfs later committed atrocities against French soldiers during France's retreat.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|pp=504\u201305}}</ref>\n\nThe Russians avoided Napoleon's objective of a decisive engagement and instead retreated deeper into Russia. A brief attempt at resistance was made at [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|Smolensk]] in August; the Russians were defeated in a series of battles, and Napoleon resumed his advance. The Russians again avoided battle, although in a few cases this was only achieved because Napoleon uncharacteristically hesitated to attack when the opportunity arose. Owing to the Russian army's [[scorched earth]] tactics, the French found it increasingly difficult to forage food for themselves and their horses.<ref>Harvey 2006, p. 773</ref>\n\nThe Russians eventually offered battle outside Moscow on 7 September: the [[Battle of Borodino]] resulted in approximately 44,000 Russian and 35,000 French dead, wounded or captured, and may have been the bloodiest day of battle in history up to that point in time.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=518}}</ref> Although the French had won, the Russian army had accepted, and withstood, the major battle Napoleon had hoped would be decisive. Napoleon's own account was: \"The most terrible of all my battles was the one before Moscow. The French showed themselves to be worthy of victory, but the Russians showed themselves worthy of being invincible\".<ref>Markham 1988, p. 194</ref>\n\nThe Russian army withdrew and retreated past Moscow. Napoleon entered the city, assuming its fall would end the war and Alexander would negotiate peace. However, on orders of the city's governor [[Feodor Rostopchin]], rather than capitulation, Moscow was burned. After five weeks, Napoleon and his army left. In early November Napoleon got concerned about loss of control back in France after the [[Malet coup of 1812]]. His army walked through snow up to their knees, and nearly 10,000 men and horses froze to death on the night of 8/9 November alone. After the [[Battle of Berezina]] Napoleon managed to escape but had to abandon much of the remaining artillery and baggage train. On 5 December, shortly before arriving in Vilnius, Napoleon left the army in a sledge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-1812.nl/english.php|title=Napoleon1812|work=napoleon-1812.nl|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213205204/http://napoleon-1812.nl/english.php|archivedate=13 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe French suffered in the course of a ruinous retreat, including from the harshness of the [[Russian Winter]].

Napoleon would remain as Emperor of France, but it would be reduced to its \"natural frontiers\". That meant that France could retain control of Belgium, Savoy and the Rhineland (the west bank of the Rhine River), while giving up control of all the rest, including all of Spain and the Netherlands, and most of Italy and Germany. Metternich told Napoleon these were the best terms the Allies were likely to offer; after further victories, the terms would be harsher and harsher. Metternich's motivation was to maintain France as a balance against Russian threats, while ending the highly destabilizing series of wars.<ref name=\"J. P.

His description of Napoleon in the months before his death led [[Sten Forshufvud]] in a 1961 paper in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' to put forward other causes for his death, including deliberate [[arsenic poisoning]].<ref name=Cullen>Cullen 2008, pp. 146\u201348</ref> Arsenic was used as a poison during the era because it was undetectable when administered over a long period. Furthermore, in a 1978 book with [[Ben Weider]], Forshufvud noted that Napoleon's body was found to be well preserved when moved in 1840. Arsenic is a strong preservative, and therefore this supported the poisoning hypothesis. Forshufvud and Weider observed that Napoleon had attempted to quench abnormal thirst by drinking large amounts of [[orgeat syrup]] that contained cyanide compounds in the almonds used for flavouring.<ref name=Cullen />\n\nThey maintained that the [[potassium tartrate]] used in his treatment prevented his stomach from expelling these compounds and that his thirst was a symptom of the poison. Their hypothesis was that the [[calomel]] given to Napoleon became an overdose, which killed him and left extensive [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] damage behind.<ref name=Cullen /> According to a 2007 article, the type of arsenic found in Napoleon's hair shafts was mineral, the most toxic, and according to toxicologist Patrick Kintz, this supported the conclusion that he was murdered.<ref name=cullen156>Cullen 2008, p. 156</ref>\n\nThere have been modern studies that have supported the original autopsy finding.<ref name=cullen156 /> In a 2008 study, researchers analysed samples of Napoleon's hair from throughout his life, as well as samples from his family and other contemporaries. All samples had high levels of arsenic, approximately 100 times higher than the current average. According to these researchers, Napoleon's body was already heavily contaminated with arsenic as a boy, and the high arsenic concentration in his hair was not caused by intentional poisoning; people were constantly exposed to arsenic from glues and dyes throughout their lives.{{Efn|The body can tolerate large doses of arsenic if ingested regularly, and arsenic was a fashionable [[Panacea (medicine)|cure-all]].<ref>Cullen 2008, p. 50</ref>}} Studies published in 2007 and 2008 dismissed evidence of arsenic poisoning, and confirmed evidence of [[peptic ulcer]] and [[gastric cancer]] as the cause of death.<ref>Cullen 2008, p. 161, and Hindmarsh et al. 2008, p. 2092</ref>\n\n== Religion ==\n{{Further|Napoleon and the Catholic Church}}\n[[File:France dioceses 1801.svg|thumb|right|Reorganisation of the religious geography: France is divided into 59 [[diocese]]s and 10 [[ecclesiastical provinces]].]]\n\nNapoleon was baptised in [[Ajaccio]] on 21 July 1771.

He also wore his [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] star, medal and ribbon, and the [[Order of the Iron Crown]] decorations, white French-style [[culotte]]s and white stockings. This was in contrast to the complex uniforms with many decorations of his [[Marshal of the Empire|marshals]] and those around him.\n\nIn his later years he gained quite a bit of weight and had a complexion considered pale or sallow, something contemporaries took note of. Novelist Paul de Kock, who saw him in 1811 on the balcony of the Tuileries, called Napoleon \"yellow, obese, and bloated\".<ref>Seward, Desmond. ''Napoleon's Family''.

He continued the policy, which emerged from the Revolution, of promotion based primarily on merit.<ref name=Archer />\n\n[[Corps]] replaced divisions as the largest army units, [[Self-propelled artillery|mobile artillery]] was integrated into reserve batteries, the staff system became more fluid and cavalry returned as an important formation in French military doctrine.

The increased importance of artillery after 1807 stemmed from his creation of a highly mobile artillery force, the growth in artillery numbers, and changes in artillery practices. As a result of these factors, Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defences, now could use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line that was then exploited by supporting infantry and cavalry. McConachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the French army beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the French infantry and, later, France's inferiority in cavalry numbers.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.reenactor.ru/ARH/PDF/McConachy.pdf |url-status=live |jstor=2677528 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119131512/http://www.reenactor.ru/ARH/PDF/McConachy.pdf |archive-date=19 January 2012|title=The Roots of Artillery Doctrine: Napoleonic Artillery Tactics Reconsidered |journal=The Journal of Military History |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=617\u2013640 |last1=McConachy |first1=Bruce |year=2001 |doi=10.2307/2677528 }}</ref> Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, but 18th-century [[operational mobility]] underwent change.<ref>Archer et al. 2002, p. 383</ref>\n\nNapoleon's biggest influence was in the conduct of warfare.

The propagandistic rhetoric changed in relation to events and to the atmosphere of Napoleon's reign, focusing first on his role as a general in the army and identification as a soldier, and moving to his role as emperor and a civil leader. Specifically targeting his civilian audience, Napoleon fostered a relationship with the contemporary art community, taking an active role in commissioning and controlling different forms of art production to suit his propaganda goals.<ref>Alan Forrest, \"Propaganda and the Legitimation of Power in Napoleonic France\".

He was [[Emperor of the French]] as '''Napoleon I''' from 1804 until 1814 and again briefly in 1815 during the [[Hundred Days]]. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a [[First French Empire|large empire]] that ruled over much of continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. He is considered one of the greatest commanders in history, and his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy has endured as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history.<ref name=\"Roberts, Andrew 2014\">Roberts, Andrew. ''Napoleon: A Life''.

He was serving as an artillery officer in the French army when the French Revolution erupted in 1789. He rapidly rose through the ranks of the military, seizing the new opportunities presented by the Revolution and becoming a general at age 24. The [[French Directory]] eventually gave him command of the [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]] after he suppressed the [[13 Vend\u00e9miaire]] revolt against the government from royalist insurgents. At age 26, he began his [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|first military campaign]] against the Austrians and the Italian monarchs aligned with the Habsburgs\u2014winning virtually every battle, conquering the Italian Peninsula in a year while establishing \"[[sister republic]]s\" with local support, and becoming a war hero in France. In 1798, he led a [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|military expedition to Egypt]] that served as a springboard to political power. He orchestrated a [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|coup in November 1799]] and became [[French Consulate|First Consul]] of the Republic. After the Peace of Amiens in 1802, Napoleon turned his attention to France's colonies. He sold the [[Louisiana Territory]] to the United States, and he attempted to restore slavery to the French Caribbean colonies. However, while he was successful in restoring slavery in the eastern Caribbean, Napoleon failed in his attempts to subdue [[Saint-Domingue]], and the colony that France once proudly boasted of as the \"Pearl of the Antilles\" became independent as [[Haiti]] in 1804. Napoleon's ambition and public approval inspired him to go further, and he became the first Emperor of the French in 1804. Intractable differences with the British meant that the French were facing a [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]] by 1805. Napoleon shattered this coalition with decisive victories in the [[Ulm Campaign]] and a historic triumph over the [[Russian Empire]] and [[Austrian Empire]] at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] which led to the [[dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire]]. In 1806, the [[War of the Fourth Coalition|Fourth Coalition]] took up arms against him because [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] became worried about growing French influence on the continent. Napoleon quickly defeated Prussia at the [[Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt|battles of Jena and Auerstedt]], then marched his ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'' deep into [[Eastern Europe]] and annihilated the Russians in June 1807 at the [[Battle of Friedland]]. France then forced the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to sign the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] in July 1807, bringing an uneasy peace to the continent. Tilsit signified the high-water mark of the French Empire. In 1809, the Austrians and the British challenged the French again during the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]], but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the [[Battle of Wagram]] in July.\n\nNapoleon then [[Napoleonic invasion of Iberia|occupied the Iberian Peninsula]], hoping to extend the [[Continental System]] and choke off British trade with the European mainland, and declared his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]] the [[King of Spain]] in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted with British support. The [[Peninsular War]] lasted six years, featured extensive [[guerrilla warfare]], and ended in victory for the Allies against Napoleon. The Continental System caused recurring diplomatic conflicts between France and its client states, especially Russia. The Russians were unwilling to bear the economic consequences of reduced trade and routinely violated the Continental System, enticing Napoleon into another war. The French launched a major [[French invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]] in the summer of 1812. The campaign destroyed Russian cities, but did not yield the decisive victory Napoleon wanted. It resulted in the collapse of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' and inspired a renewed push against Napoleon by his enemies. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition]] against France. A lengthy military campaign culminated in a large Allied army defeating Napoleon at the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in October 1813, but his tactical victory at the minor [[Battle of Hanau]] allowed retreat onto French soil. The Allies then [[1814 campaign in France|invaded France]] and captured Paris in the spring of 1814, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April. He was exiled to the island of [[Elba]] off the coast of [[Tuscany]], and the [[Bourbon dynasty]] was [[Bourbon Restoration|restored to power]]. Napoleon escaped from Elba in February 1815 and took control of France once again. The Allies responded by forming a [[War of the Seventh Coalition|Seventh Coalition]] which defeated him at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in June. The British exiled him to the remote island of [[Saint Helena]] in the South Atlantic, where he died six years later at the age of 51.\n\nNapoleon's influence on the modern world brought liberal reforms to the numerous territories that he conquered and controlled, such as the [[Low Countries]], [[Switzerland]], and large parts of modern [[Italy]] and [[Germany]]. He implemented fundamental liberal policies in France and throughout Western Europe. His [[Napoleonic Code]] has influenced the legal systems of more than 70 nations around the world. British historian [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]] states: \"The ideas that underpin our modern world\u2014meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on\u2014were championed, consolidated, codified and geographically extended by Napoleon. To them he added a rational and efficient local administration, an end to rural banditry, the encouragement of science and the arts, the abolition of feudalism and the greatest codification of laws since the [[fall of the Roman Empire]]\".<ref>Andrew Roberts, ''Napoleon: A Life'' (2014), p. xxxiii.</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Carlo Buonaparte.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Half-length portrait of a wigged middle-aged man with a well-to-do jacket.

He immediately went on the offensive, hoping to defeat the forces of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont]] before their Austrian allies could intervene. In a series of rapid victories during the [[Montenotte Campaign]], he knocked Piedmont out of the war in two weeks. The French then focused on the Austrians for the remainder of the war, the highlight of which became the protracted [[Siege of Mantua (1796\u201397)|struggle for Mantua]]. The Austrians launched a series of offensives against the French to break the siege, but Napoleon defeated every relief effort, scoring victories at the battles of [[Battle of Castiglione|Castiglione]], [[Battle of Bassano|Bassano]], [[Battle of Arcole|Arcole]], and [[Battle of Rivoli|Rivoli]]. The decisive French triumph at Rivoli in January 1797 led to the collapse of the Austrian position in Italy. At Rivoli, the Austrians lost up to 14,000 men while the French lost about 5,000.{{sfn|Bell|2015|p=29}}\n\nThe next phase of the campaign featured the French invasion of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] heartlands. French forces in Southern Germany had been defeated by the [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]] in 1796, but the Archduke withdrew his forces to protect Vienna after learning about Napoleon's assault. In the first encounter between the two commanders, Napoleon pushed back his opponent and advanced deep into Austrian territory after winning at the [[Battle of Tarvis (1797)|Battle of Tarvis]] in March 1797. The Austrians were alarmed by the French thrust that reached all the way to [[Leoben]], about 100&nbsp;km from Vienna, and finally decided to sue for peace.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|pp=284\u201385}}</ref> The [[Treaty of Leoben]], followed by the more comprehensive [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], gave France control of most of northern Italy and the [[Low Countries]], and a secret clause promised the [[Republic of Venice]] to Austria. Bonaparte marched on Venice and forced its surrender, ending 1,100 years of independence. He also authorized the French to loot treasures such as the [[Horses of Saint Mark]].<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=132}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bonaparte re\u00e7oit les prisonniers sur le champ de bataille, 1797.jpg|thumb|Bonaparte during the Italian campaign in 1797]]\nHis application of conventional military ideas to real-world situations enabled his military triumphs, such as creative use of artillery as a mobile force to support his infantry. He stated later in life:{{When|date=August 2016}} \"I have fought sixty battles and I have learned nothing which I did not know at the beginning. Look at Caesar; he fought the first like the last\".<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=145}}</ref>\n\nBonaparte could win battles by concealment of troop deployments and concentration of his forces on the \"hinge\" of an enemy's weakened front. If he could not use his favourite [[Pincer movement|envelopment strategy]], he would take up the central position and attack two co-operating forces at their hinge, swing round to fight one until it fled, then turn to face the other.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=142}}</ref> In this Italian campaign, Bonaparte's army captured 150,000 prisoners, 540 cannons, and 170 [[flag|standards]].<ref>Harvey 2006, p. 179</ref> The French army fought 67 actions and won 18 [[pitched battle]]s through superior artillery technology and Bonaparte's tactics.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=135}}</ref>\n\nDuring the campaign, Bonaparte became increasingly influential in French politics. He founded two newspapers: one for the troops in his army and another for circulation in France.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|p=306}}</ref> The royalists attacked Bonaparte for looting Italy and warned that he might become a dictator.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dwyer|2008|p=305}}</ref> Napoleon's forces extracted an estimated $45 million in funds from Italy during their campaign there, another $12 million in precious metals and jewels.

This left Barras and his Republican allies in control again but dependent on Bonaparte, who proceeded to peace negotiations with Austria.

At the [[Battle of Austerlitz]], in [[Moravia]] on 2 December, he deployed the French army below the Pratzen Heights and deliberately weakened his right flank, enticing the Allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling up the whole French line. A forced march from Vienna by [[Louis-Nicolas Davout|Marshal Davout]] and his [[III Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|III Corps]] plugged the gap left by Napoleon just in time.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, the heavy Allied deployment against the French right flank weakened their center on the Pratzen Heights, which was viciously attacked by the [[IV Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|IV Corps]] of [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Marshal Soult]]. With the Allied center demolished, the French swept through both enemy flanks and sent the Allies fleeing chaotically, capturing thousands of prisoners in the process. The battle is often seen as a tactical masterpiece because of the near-perfect execution of a calibrated but dangerous plan\u2014of the same stature as [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], the celebrated triumph by [[Hannibal]] some 2,000 years before.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe Allied disaster at Austerlitz significantly shook the faith of Emperor Francis in the British-led war effort. France and Austria agreed to an armistice immediately and the Treaty of Pressburg followed shortly after on 26 December. Pressburg took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of [[Treaty of Campo Formio|Campo Formio]] and of [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville|Lun\u00e9ville]] between the two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian loss of lands to France in [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italy]] and [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]], and lands in Germany to Napoleon's German allies. It also imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated Habsburgs and allowed the fleeing Russian troops free passage through hostile territories and back to their home soil. Napoleon went on to say, \"The battle of Austerlitz is the finest of all I have fought\".<ref>Schom 1997, p. 414</ref> Frank McLynn suggests that Napoleon was so successful at Austerlitz that he lost touch with reality, and what used to be French foreign policy became a \"personal Napoleonic one\".<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=350}}</ref> [[Vincent Cronin]] disagrees, stating that Napoleon was not overly ambitious for himself, \"he embodied the ambitions of thirty million Frenchmen\".<ref>Cronin 1994, p. 344</ref>\n\n==== Middle-Eastern alliances ====\n{{Main|Franco-Ottoman alliance|Franco-Persian alliance}}\n[[File:The Persian Envoy Mirza Mohammed Reza Qazvini Finkenstein Castle 27 Avril 1807 by Francois Mulard.jpg|thumb|The Iranian envoy Mirza Mohammed Reza-Qazvini meeting with Napoleon I at the [[Finckenstein Palace]] in [[West Prussia]], 27 April 1807, to sign the [[Treaty of Finckenstein]]]]\nNapoleon continued to entertain a grand scheme to establish a French presence in the Middle East in order to put pressure on Britain and Russia, and perhaps form an alliance with the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=Watson>Watson 2003, pp. 13\u201314</ref> In February 1806, Ottoman Emperor [[Selim III]] recognised Napoleon as ''Emperor''.

A collection of German states intended to serve as a buffer zone between France and Central Europe, the creation of the Confederation spelled the end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and significantly alarmed the Prussians. The brazen reorganization of German territory by the French risked threatening Prussian influence in the region, if not eliminating it outright. War fever in Berlin rose steadily throughout the summer of 1806. At the insistence of his court, especially his wife [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Louise]], [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] decided to challenge the French domination of Central Europe by going to war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael V.

As in previous campaigns, his fundamental objective was to destroy one opponent before reinforcements from another could tip the balance of the war. Upon learning the whereabouts of the Prussian army, the French swung westwards and crossed the Saale with overwhelming force. At the twin [[Battle of Jena\u2013Auerstedt|battles of Jena and Auerstedt]], fought on 14 October, the French convincingly defeated the Prussians and inflicted heavy casualties. With several major commanders dead or incapacitated, the Prussian king proved incapable of effectively commanding the army, which began to quickly disintegrate.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\nIn a vaunted pursuit that epitomized the \"peak of Napoleonic warfare\", according to historian Richard Brooks,<ref name=\"auto2\"/> the French managed to capture 140,000 soldiers, over 2,000 cannons and hundreds of ammunition wagons, all in a single month. Historian David Chandler wrote of the Prussian forces: \"Never has the morale of any army been more completely shattered\".<ref name=\"Chandler 1966, p. 467-8\" /> Despite their overwhelming defeat, the Prussians refused to negotiate with the French until the Russians had an opportunity to enter the fight.\n\n[[File:Tilsitz 1807.JPG|thumb|The [[Treaties of Tilsit]]: Napoleon meeting with [[Alexander I of Russia]] on a raft in the middle of the [[Neman River]]]]\n\nFollowing his triumph, Napoleon imposed the first elements of the Continental System through the [[Berlin Decree]] issued in November 1806.

The scale of their defeat convinced the Russians to make peace with the French. On 19 June, Tsar Alexander sent an envoy to seek an armistice with Napoleon. The latter assured the envoy that the [[Vistula River]] represented the natural borders between French and Russian influence in Europe. On that basis, the two emperors began peace negotiations at the town of [[Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Tilsit]] after meeting on an iconic raft on the [[Neman (river)|River Niemen]]. The very first thing Alexander said to Napoleon was probably well-calibrated: \"I hate the English as much as you do\".<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\nAlexander faced pressure from his brother, [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia|Duke Constantine]], to make peace with Napoleon. Given the victory he had just achieved, the French emperor offered the Russians relatively lenient terms\u2014demanding that Russia join the Continental System, withdraw its forces from [[Wallachia]] and [[Moldavia]], and hand over the [[Ionian Islands]] to France.{{sfn|Roberts|2014|pages=458\u201359}} By contrast, Napoleon dictated very harsh peace terms for Prussia, despite the ceaseless exhortations of [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Louise]]. Wiping out half of Prussian territories from the map, Napoleon created a new kingdom of {{convert|1100|sqmi|km2|order=flip}} called [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]] and appointed his young brother J\u00e9r\u00f4me as its monarch. Prussia's humiliating treatment at Tilsit caused a deep and bitter antagonism which festered as the [[Napoleonic era]] progressed. Moreover, Alexander's pretensions at friendship with Napoleon led the latter to seriously misjudge the true intentions of his Russian counterpart, who would violate numerous provisions of the treaty in the next few years. Despite these problems, the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] at last gave Napoleon a respite from war and allowed him to return to France, which he had not seen in over 300 days.{{sfn|Roberts|2014|pages=459\u201361}}\n\n==== Peninsular War and Erfurt ====\n{{Main|Peninsular War}}\nThe settlements at Tilsit gave Napoleon time to organize his empire. One of his major objectives became enforcing the Continental System against the British. He decided to focus his attention on the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], which consistently violated his trade prohibitions. After defeat in the [[War of the Oranges]] in 1801, Portugal adopted a double-sided policy. At first, [[John VI of Portugal|John VI]] agreed to close his ports to British trade. The situation changed dramatically after the Franco-Spanish defeat at Trafalgar; John grew bolder and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations with Britain.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n[[File:Joseph-Bonaparte.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Bonaparte]], Napoleon's brother, as King of Spain]]\n\nUnhappy with this change of policy by the Portuguese government, Napoleon negotiated a [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1807)|secret treaty]] with [[Charles IV of Spain]] and sent an army to invade Portugal.<ref>{{cite book |last=Horne |first=Alistair |author-link=Alistair Horne |title=How Far From Austerlitz?

Throughout the winter of 1808, French agents became increasingly involved in Spanish internal affairs, attempting to incite discord between members of the [[House of Bourbon|Spanish royal family]]. On 16 February 1808, secret French machinations finally materialized when Napoleon announced that he would intervene to mediate between the rival political factions in the country.<ref>Fisher & Fremont-Barnes pp. 198\u201399.</ref>\n\n[[Joachim Murat|Marshal Murat]] led 120,000 troops into Spain. The French arrived in [[Madrid]] on 24 March,<ref>Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 199.</ref> where wild riots against the occupation erupted just a few weeks later. Napoleon appointed his brother, [[Joseph Bonaparte]], as the new King of Spain in the summer of 1808. The appointment enraged a heavily religious and conservative Spanish population. Resistance to French aggression soon spread throughout Spain. The shocking French defeat at the [[Battle of Bail\u00e9n]] in July gave hope to Napoleon's enemies and partly persuaded the French emperor to intervene in person.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nBefore going to Iberia, Napoleon decided to address several lingering issues with the Russians. At the [[Congress of Erfurt]] in October 1808, Napoleon hoped to keep Russia on his side during the upcoming struggle in Spain and during any potential conflict against Austria. The two sides reached an agreement, the Erfurt Convention, that called upon Britain to cease its war against France, that recognized the Russian conquest of [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Finland]] from [[Kingdom of Sweden (1721\u20131809)|Sweden]], and that affirmed Russian support for France in a possible war against Austria \"to the best of its ability\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c_erfurt.html |title=The Erfurt Convention 1808 |publisher=Napoleon-series.org |accessdate=22 April 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021094131/http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/diplomatic/c_erfurt.html |archivedate=21 October 2013  }}</ref>\n\nNapoleon then returned to France and prepared for war. The ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'', under the Emperor's personal command, rapidly crossed the [[Ebro]] River in November 1808 and inflicted a series of crushing defeats against the Spanish forces. After clearing the last Spanish force guarding the capital at [[Battle of Somosierra|Somosierra]], Napoleon entered Madrid on 4 December with 80,000 troops.<ref>Fisher & Fremont-Barnes p. 205.</ref> He then unleashed his soldiers against [[John Moore (British soldier)|Moore]] and the British forces. The British were swiftly driven to the coast, and they withdrew from Spain entirely after a last stand at the [[Battle of Corunna]] in January 1809.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n[[File:Antoine-Jean Gros - Capitulation de Madrid, le 4 d\u00e9cembre 1808.jpg|thumb|Napoleon accepting the surrender of [[Madrid]], 4 December 1808]]\nNapoleon would end up leaving Iberia in order to deal with the Austrians in Central Europe, but the Peninsular War continued on long after his absence. He never returned to Spain after the 1808 campaign. Several months after Corunna, the British sent another army to the peninsula under the future [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. The war then settled into a complex and asymmetric strategic deadlock where all sides struggled to gain the upper hand. The highlight of the conflict became the brutal ''[[guerrilla warfare]]'' that engulfed much of the Spanish countryside. Both sides committed the worst atrocities of the Napoleonic Wars during this phase of the conflict.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|pp=659\u201360}}</ref>\n\nThe vicious guerrilla fighting in Spain, largely absent from the French campaigns in Central Europe, severely disrupted the French lines of supply and communication. Although France maintained roughly 300,000 troops in Iberia during the Peninsular War, the vast majority were tied down to garrison duty and to intelligence operations.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> The French were never able to concentrate all of their forces effectively, prolonging the war until events elsewhere in Europe finally turned the tide in favour of the Allies. After the invasion of Russia in 1812, the number of French troops in Spain vastly declined as Napoleon needed reinforcements to conserve his strategic position in Europe. By 1814, after scores of battles and sieges throughout Iberia, the Allies had managed to push the French out of the peninsula.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe impact of the Napoleonic invasion of Spain and ousting of the Spanish Bourbon monarchy in favour of his brother Joseph had an enormous impact on the [[Spanish empire]]. In [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]] many local elites formed juntas and set up mechanisms to rule in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]], whom they considered the legitimate Spanish monarch. The outbreak of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] in most of the empire was a result of Napoleon's destabilizing actions in Spain and led to the rise of [[Strongman (politics)|strongmen]] in the wake of these wars.<ref>[[John Lynch (historian)|John Lynch]], ''Caudillos in Spanish America 1800\u20131850''.

The early Austrian attack surprised the French; Napoleon himself was still in Paris when he heard about the invasion. He arrived at [[Donauw\u00f6rth]] on the 17th to find the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' in a dangerous position, with its two wings separated by {{convert|75|mi|km|sigfig=2|order=flip|abbr=on}} and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops. Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a plan to cut off the Austrians in the celebrated ''Landshut Maneuver''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=690}}</ref> He realigned the axis of his army and marched his soldiers towards the town of [[Eckm\u00fchl]]. The French scored a convincing win in the resulting [[Battle of Eckm\u00fchl]], forcing Charles to withdraw his forces over the [[Danube]] and into [[Bohemia]]. On 13 May, Vienna fell for the second time in four years, although the war continued since most of the Austrian army had survived the initial engagements in Southern Germany.\n\n[[File:Wigand-Entry of Napoleon in Sch\u00f6nbrunn.jpg|thumb|The entry of Napoleon in [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace|Sch\u00f6nbrunn]], Vienna]]\nBy 17 May, the main Austrian army under Charles had arrived on the Marchfeld. Charles kept the bulk of his troops several kilometres away from the river bank in hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross. On 21 May, the French made their first major effort to cross the Danube, precipitating the [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]]. The Austrians enjoyed a comfortable numerical superiority over the French throughout the battle. On the first day, Charles disposed of 110,000 soldiers against only 31,000 commanded by Napoleon.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=701}}</ref> By the second day, reinforcements had boosted French numbers up to 70,000.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|p=705}}</ref>\n\nThe battle was characterized by a vicious back-and-forth struggle for the two villages of Aspern and Essling, the focal points of the French bridgehead. By the end of the fighting, the French had lost Aspern but still controlled Essling.

Desperate for a legitimate heir, Napoleon divorced Jos\u00e9phine on 10 January 1810 and started looking for a new wife. Hoping to cement the recent alliance with Austria through a family connection, Napoleon married the [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma]], daughter of [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], who was 18 years old at the time. On 20 March 1811, Marie Louise gave birth to a baby boy, whom Napoleon made heir apparent and bestowed the title of ''[[King of the Romans|King of Rome]]''.

The serfs later committed atrocities against French soldiers during France's retreat.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|pp=504\u201305}}</ref>\n\nThe Russians avoided Napoleon's objective of a decisive engagement and instead retreated deeper into Russia. A brief attempt at resistance was made at [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|Smolensk]] in August; the Russians were defeated in a series of battles, and Napoleon resumed his advance. The Russians again avoided battle, although in a few cases this was only achieved because Napoleon uncharacteristically hesitated to attack when the opportunity arose. Owing to the Russian army's [[scorched earth]] tactics, the French found it increasingly difficult to forage food for themselves and their horses.<ref>Harvey 2006, p. 773</ref>\n\nThe Russians eventually offered battle outside Moscow on 7 September: the [[Battle of Borodino]] resulted in approximately 44,000 Russian and 35,000 French dead, wounded or captured, and may have been the bloodiest day of battle in history up to that point in time.<ref>{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=518}}</ref> Although the French had won, the Russian army had accepted, and withstood, the major battle Napoleon had hoped would be decisive. Napoleon's own account was: \"The most terrible of all my battles was the one before Moscow. The French showed themselves to be worthy of victory, but the Russians showed themselves worthy of being invincible\".<ref>Markham 1988, p. 194</ref>\n\nThe Russian army withdrew and retreated past Moscow. Napoleon entered the city, assuming its fall would end the war and Alexander would negotiate peace. However, on orders of the city's governor [[Feodor Rostopchin]], rather than capitulation, Moscow was burned. After five weeks, Napoleon and his army left. In early November Napoleon got concerned about loss of control back in France after the [[Malet coup of 1812]]. His army walked through snow up to their knees, and nearly 10,000 men and horses froze to death on the night of 8/9 November alone. After the [[Battle of Berezina]] Napoleon managed to escape but had to abandon much of the remaining artillery and baggage train. On 5 December, shortly before arriving in Vilnius, Napoleon left the army in a sledge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-1812.nl/english.php|title=Napoleon1812|work=napoleon-1812.nl|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213205204/http://napoleon-1812.nl/english.php|archivedate=13 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe French suffered in the course of a ruinous retreat, including from the harshness of the [[Russian Winter]].

Napoleon would remain as Emperor of France, but it would be reduced to its \"natural frontiers\". That meant that France could retain control of Belgium, Savoy and the Rhineland (the west bank of the Rhine River), while giving up control of all the rest, including all of Spain and the Netherlands, and most of Italy and Germany. Metternich told Napoleon these were the best terms the Allies were likely to offer; after further victories, the terms would be harsher and harsher. Metternich's motivation was to maintain France as a balance against Russian threats, while ending the highly destabilizing series of wars.<ref name=\"J. P.

Furthermore, in a 1978 book with [[Ben Weider]], Forshufvud noted that Napoleon's body was found to be well preserved when moved in 1840. Arsenic is a strong preservative, and therefore this supported the poisoning hypothesis.

All samples had high levels of arsenic, approximately 100 times higher than the current average. According to these researchers, Napoleon's body was already heavily contaminated with arsenic as a boy, and the high arsenic concentration in his hair was not caused by intentional poisoning; people were constantly exposed to arsenic from glues and dyes throughout their lives.{{Efn|The body can tolerate large doses of arsenic if ingested regularly, and arsenic was a fashionable [[Panacea (medicine)|cure-all]].<ref>Cullen 2008, p. 50</ref>}} Studies published in 2007 and 2008 dismissed evidence of arsenic poisoning, and confirmed evidence of [[peptic ulcer]] and [[gastric cancer]] as the cause of death.<ref>Cullen 2008, p. 161, and Hindmarsh et al. 2008, p. 2092</ref>\n\n== Religion ==\n{{Further|Napoleon and the Catholic Church}}\n[[File:France dioceses 1801.svg|thumb|right|Reorganisation of the religious geography: France is divided into 59 [[diocese]]s and 10 [[ecclesiastical provinces]].]]\n\nNapoleon was baptised in [[Ajaccio]] on 21 July 1771.

Napoleon reorganized what had been the Holy Roman Empire, made up of more than a thousand entities, {{Quantify|date=August 2016}} into a more streamlined forty-state [[Confederation of the Rhine]]; this helped promote the [[German Confederation]] and the [[unification of Germany]] in 1871.<ref>Scheck 2008, Chapter: The Road to National Unification</ref>\n\nThe movement toward national unification in Italy was similarly precipitated by Napoleonic rule.<ref>Astarita 2005, p. 264</ref> These changes contributed to the development of nationalism and the [[nation state]].<ref>Alter 2006, pp. 61\u201376</ref>\n\nNapoleon implemented a wide array of liberal reforms in France and across Continental Europe, especially in Italy and Germany, as summarized by British historian [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]]:\n\n{{quote|The ideas that underpin our modern world\u2014meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on\u2014were championed, consolidated, codified and geographically extended by Napoleon.

He continued the policy, which emerged from the Revolution, of promotion based primarily on merit.<ref name=Archer />\n\n[[Corps]] replaced divisions as the largest army units, [[Self-propelled artillery|mobile artillery]] was integrated into reserve batteries, the staff system became more fluid and cavalry returned as an important formation in French military doctrine.

The increased importance of artillery after 1807 stemmed from his creation of a highly mobile artillery force, the growth in artillery numbers, and changes in artillery practices. As a result of these factors, Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defences, now could use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy's line that was then exploited by supporting infantry and cavalry. McConachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the French army beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the French infantry and, later, France's inferiority in cavalry numbers.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.reenactor.ru/ARH/PDF/McConachy.pdf |url-status=live |jstor=2677528 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119131512/http://www.reenactor.ru/ARH/PDF/McConachy.pdf |archive-date=19 January 2012|title=The Roots of Artillery Doctrine: Napoleonic Artillery Tactics Reconsidered |journal=The Journal of Military History |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=617\u2013640 |last1=McConachy |first1=Bruce |year=2001 |doi=10.2307/2677528 }}</ref> Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, but 18th-century [[operational mobility]] underwent change.<ref>Archer et al. 2002, p. 383</ref>\n\nNapoleon's biggest influence was in the conduct of warfare.

Invasions of enemy territory occurred over broader fronts which made wars costlier and more decisive. The political effect of war increased; defeat for a European power meant more than the loss of isolated enclaves.

She became known as \"Cleopatra\".{{Efn|One night, during an illicit liaison with the actress Marguerite George, Napoleon had a major fit.

Despite his divorce from Josephine, Napoleon showed his dedication to her for the rest of his life. When he heard the news of her death while on exile in Elba, he locked himself in his room and would not come out for two full days.<ref name=\"pbs.org\"/> Her name would also be his final word on his deathbed in 1821.\n\nOn 11 March 1810 by [[proxy marriage|proxy]], he married the 19-year-old [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie Louise]], Archduchess of Austria, and a great niece of [[Marie Antoinette]]. Thus he had married into a [[Family tree of the German monarchs|German royal and imperial family]].<ref name=\"McLynn 1998, p.663\">{{Harvnb|McLynn|1998|p=663}}</ref> Louise was less than happy with the arrangement, at least at first, stating: \"Just to see the man would be the worst form of torture\". Her great-aunt had been executed in France, while Napoleon had fought numerous campaigns against Austria all throughout his military career. However, she seemed to warm up to him over time. After her wedding, she wrote to her father: \"He loves me very much. I respond to his love sincerely. There is something very fetching and very eager about him that is impossible to resist\".<ref name=\"pbs.org\"/>\n\nNapoleon and Marie Louise remained married until his death, though she did not join him in exile on Elba and thereafter never saw her husband again. The couple had one child, [[Napoleon II|Napoleon Francis Joseph Charles]] (1811\u20131832), known from birth as the [[King of the Romans|King of Rome]]. He became Napoleon II in 1814 and reigned for only two weeks.

Set during the end of term at Elmsmere, it focuses on Crispin Bell, filming a documentary with the help of Fleur Murphy. He focuses on Elmsmere's curriculum, sporting activities and education, and also discusses the history of Elmsmere, about how Elmsbury and Fowlmere merged.\n\nThe series features clips from the second and third series, as the many topics of the documentary are discussed. The series also features Nero and his friends, who discuss the events of the third series. Isaac and Ash made their final appearances in Elmsmere uniform, discussing Josh's mishaps with Rachel and the adventures they had in Elmsbury and Elmsmere.\n\nDexter and Nunn were also caught teasing each other, at the expense of Dexter's end of year reports, whom he did Josh's and Zoe-Marie's reports. Josh is absent from the series (due to his departure for Hillview). He only appears in clips from previous series.\n\nThe programme aired on CBBC, between 14 and 19 December 2014.\n\n==Production==\nConstructed raps are featured in every episode, usually relating to the current situation.  As such, the series takes a musical style.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Since the show began, all series have been filmed on location in [[Greater Manchester]]. For the first series, filmed in 2011, ''4 O'Clock Club'' was filmed in a secondary school that is still in use: [[Smithills School]], [[Bolton]]. \n\nThe second series was filmed at Offerton High School (now Fairway Primary School) in [[Stockport]] in 2012, which was also used briefly in 2013 for the third series. From 2013 to 2016, the series was filmed in the former site of [[St Ambrose Barlow RC High School]] in Swinton.

The nation is linked to North America and Europe by [[satellite]] communications for telephone and television service.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe department of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon is served by three television stations: Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon 1\u00e8re ([[call letter]]s FQN) on Channel 8, with a repeater on Channel 31, and [[France \u00d4]] on Channel 6. While Saint-Pierre and Miquelon use the French [[SECAM]]-K1 [[broadcast television systems|standard for television broadcasts]], the local telecommunications provider (SPM Telecom) carries many North American television stations and cable channels, converted from North America's [[NTSC]] standard. In addition, Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon 1\u00e8re is carried on [[Shaw Direct]] satellite and most digital cable services in Canada, converted to NTSC.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nSPM Telecom is also the department's main [[Internet Service Provider]], with its internet service being named \"Cheznoo\" (a play on Chez-Nous, French for \"Our Place\"). SPM Telecom also offers cellular phone and mobile phone service (for phones that adhere to the [[GSM]] standard). SPM Telecom uses the GSM 900&nbsp;MHz band,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gsmworld.com/roaming/gsminfo/cou_pm.shtml|title=GSM Coverage Maps \u2013 Saint-Pierre and Miquelon|accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref> which is different from the GSM 850&nbsp;MHz and 1900&nbsp;MHz bands used in the rest of North America.\n\nThe islands are treated as a separate country-level entity among radio amateurs, identifiable with ITU prefix \"FP\". Visiting radio amateurs, mainly from the US, activate Saint-Pierre and Miquelon every year on amateur radio frequencies. The islands are well known among radio amateurs, who collect contacts with these stations for [[Islands on the Air]] and [[DX Century Club]] awards; the geographic location of Saint Pierre and Miquelon gives a very good takeoff for shortwave communication all over the world.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n==Education==\nThe archipelago has four primary schools (Saint Odile, Henriette Bonin, Feu Rouge, les Quatre-Temps), one middle school (Coll\u00e8ge de Miquelon/College Saint-Christophe) with an annex in Miquelon, one state (government) high school ([[Lyc\u00e9e-coll\u00e8ge d\u2019Etat Emile Letournel]]) and one vocational high school.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe students who wish to further their studies after high school are granted access to scholarships to study overseas.

During the ''Yajna'', a beautiful woman appeared, introducing herself as a [[Brahmin]]i who wished to participate. She said that she and her companion had come a long way and asked for food. Shandilya welcomed her and told her that the rules of the ''Yajna'' forbade him from giving her the food: the ''Yajna'' had to be completed, and the ''Purohits'' fed first. The Brahmini grew angry and declared herself to be [[V\u0101c]], the Vedic goddess and [[Adi Parashakti|Divine Mother]].

Shandilya, addressing her as the Divine Mother, asked her to revive the dead and restore the village and forest.

During Lalitaditya's reign (713-755), a group of assassins from the [[Gauda Kingdom]] entered Kashmir under the guise of a pilgrimage to Sharada Peeth.<ref name=\":32\" /> Kalhana also describes a rebellion during his own liftetime. Three princes, Lothana, Vigraharaja and Bhoja, rebelled against [[Lohara dynasty#Jayasimha|King Jayasimha of Kashmir]]. These princes, pursued by the Royal Army, sought refuge in the upper Kishenganga Valley, in the Sirahsila Castle. Kalhana believed that the Royal Army took refuge in Sharada Peeth, because it had the open space required for a temporary military village, and because the area surrounding the Sirahsila Castle was not large enough to host a camp for a siege without the siege force being vulnerable to archers.<ref name=\"Qazi 111\u20131202\" />[[File:Raja_Ravi_Varma_-_Sankaracharya.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|299x299px|Adi Shankara, who opened Sharada Peeth's south door]]In the 14th century text ''Madhaviya Shankara Vijayam'', there is a test, unique to Sharada Peeth, known as the ''Sarvajna Peetham'', or Throne of Omniscience.

He was said to be welcomed by the common people, but challenged by the scholars of the region. As he approached the southern door, he was stopped by various learned men from the [[Nyaya]] school of philosophy, Buddhists, [[Digambara|Digambara Jains]], and the followers of [[Jaimini]]. Engaging with them, he managed to persuade all of them of his proficiency in philosophy, and they stood aside to let him open the entrance. Finally, as he was about to ascend the throne, he heard the voice of the goddess Sharada challenging him. The voice said that omniscience was not enough if one was impure, and that Shankara, who lived in the palace of King Amaruka, could not be pure. Shankara replied that his body had never committed a sin, and the sins committed by another could not blemish him. The goddess Sharada accepted his explanation and permitted him to ascend.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the [[Carnatic music]] song ''kalavathi kamalasana yuvathi'', the 19th century composer [[Muthuswami Dikshitar]] refers to Sharada Peeth as [[Saraswati|Saraswati's]] abode.

They believed that the goddess would convey approval of the pages of writings by leaving them undisturbed, and disapproval by leaving the pages ruffled. In addition, an annual fair would be held at Shardi village, with pilgrims travelling through [[Kupwara]] (in present-day Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir), in worship of the goddess Sharada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ikashmir.net/sharda/sharda5.html|title=Kashmir: Religious Practices|website=ikashmir.net|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> Kashmiri Pandits believe that the Sharada pilgrimage parallels Shandilya's journey, and that the act of bathing in the confluence of the Neelum River and Madhumati stream cleanses the pilgrim of their sins.<ref name=\":32\" /> In 1947, the Kashmiri saint Swami Nand Lal Ji moved some of the stone idols to Tikker in [[Kupwara]].

Historical records of the temple's architecture are scarce. A late 19th century account by [[Aurel Stein]] describes the temple's walls as intact to a height of approximately {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=}}, and its pillars rising approximately {{Convert|16|ft|m|abbr=}}. [[File:Sharada_temple.Stein1893.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sharada_temple.Stein1893.jpg|alt=|thumb|280x280px|A photograph of Sharada Peeth in 1893 by [[Aurel Stein|Sir Aurel Stein]]. A Kashmiri Pandit stands at the entrance]]\nThe compound is situated on a hill, and is approached on its west side, through an imposing stone staircase. The facades are repetitive, possibly because architects disliked plain outside walls, or else possibly so that even if the spire collapsed, a visitor would be able to tell what the temple originally looked like. The design is simple, with a plain conical Sharada spire. The temple sits on a raised [[plinth]], {{Convert|24|sqft|sqm|abbr=}} in area and {{Convert|5.25|ft|m|abbr=}} in height. The walls of the [[cella]] recede {{Convert|2|ft|m|abbr=}} from the edge of the plinth. The temple is surrounded by a quadrangle which measures {{Convert|142|ft|m|abbr=}} by {{Convert|94|ft|m|abbr=}}. The quadrangle is enclosed by walls of {{Convert|11|ft|m|abbr=}} in height and {{Convert|6|ft|m|abbr=}} in width. On the north, east, and south, the walls of the [[cella]] are adorned by [[Trefoil arch|Trefoil arches]] and supporting [[Pilaster|pilasters]], which are constructed in high relief, rising higher than either the walls or pillars. Below these are small, trefoil-headed niches covered by double [[Pediment|pediments]]. Although a pyramidal stone roof is more typical to Kashmiri architecture, in Stein's description, the temple is covered by a low [[shingle roof]]. By the 21st century, the roof is no longer present and the interior of the temple is exposed to the elements. The temple appears imposing even from outside the walled enclosure, because of the plinths it is raised on to equalise the uneven elevations of the ground. The north side of the wall contained a small recess, in which two ancient [[Lingam|''linga'']] could be seen.\n\nThe interior of the cella is plain, and forms a square of {{Convert|12.25|ft|m|abbr=}} on each side. It houses a large slab of stone measuring {{Convert|6|ft|m|abbr=}} by {{Convert|7|ft|m|abbr=}}.

It recounts the ''[[rishi]]'' Shandilya as performing a grand ''[[Yajna]]'' in the Sharda area, involving the local people and hundreds of worthy priests. During the ''Yajna'', a beautiful woman appeared, introducing herself as a [[Brahmin]]i who wished to participate. She said that she and her companion had come a long way and asked for food. Shandilya welcomed her and told her that the rules of the ''Yajna'' forbade him from giving her the food: the ''Yajna'' had to be completed, and the ''Purohits'' fed first. The Brahmini grew angry and declared herself to be [[V\u0101c]], the Vedic goddess and [[Adi Parashakti|Divine Mother]]. She revealed to him that the [[Paramatman]] he worshipped was the essence of the goddess. In her anger, she transformed before him into the divine ''Neela'' (or ''blue'') form of [[Saraswati]], with ornaments, weapons, and clouds, and declared that she would absorb the world. In shock, remorse and fear, Shandilya collapsed and died. Seeing his remorse, the goddess had him revived with ''[[Amrita]]'', the elixir of life, and transformed into a different, graceful form of Saraswati. Addressing him as \"son\", she told him that she was pleased with his devotion and compassion and would grant him whatever he wished. Shandilya, addressing her as the Divine Mother, asked her to revive the dead and restore the village and forest. Saraswati did so, instructing him to build his [[ashram]] at the base of the hill near the Madhumati river (present-day Neelum River). She took her abode there at Sharada Peeth.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Tikkoo|first=Brij Nath|url=https://archive.org/details/ShriSharadaMahatmyaBrijNathTikkoo|title=Shri Sharada Mahatmya|publisher=Vikas Printing Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=Ajmer|pages=(ii), 1, 7\u201313}}</ref>\n\nAn alternative account holds that Shandilya prayed to the goddess Sharada with great devotion, and was rewarded when she appeared to him and promised to show him her real, divine form. She advised him to look for the Sharada forest, and his journey was filled with miraculous experiences. On his way, he had a vision of the god [[Ganesha]] on the eastern side of a hill. When he reached the Neelum river, he bathed in it and saw half his body turn golden. Eventually, the goddess revealed herself to him in her triple form of Sharada, Saraswati and Vagdevi, and invited him to her abode. As he was preparing for a ritual, he drew water from the ''Mah\u0101sindhu''. Half of this water transformed into honey, and became a stream, now known as the ''Madhumati'' stream.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\nA third account holds that during a fight between good and evil, the goddess Sharada saved a mythical container of knowledge and hid it in a hole in the ground.

The two mountains overlooking the valley, Shardi and Nardi, are named after them. One day, Narada saw, from her abode on the mountain, that Sharada had died, and that giants were fleeing from her body. Furious, she summoned them and ordered them to build her a tomb, which became Sharada Peeth. The second legend says that there one was a giant who loved a princess. She desired a palace, and so he began work. At the time of morning [[Adhan|azan]], by which time he was supposed to have finished, the roof remained incomplete, and for that reason, Sharada Peeth today remains without a roof.<ref name=\"Qazi 111\u2013120\" />\n\n== Literary and cultural references ==\n[[File:View_From_Sharda_Fort,_Azad_Jammu_&_Kashmir,_Pakistan.jpg|alt=|thumb|320x320px|View of Neelum Valley from Sharada Peeth, where King Jayasimha's Royal Army would have camped]]Sharada Peeth has appeared in various historical and literary texts.

During Lalitaditya's reign (713-755), a group of assassins from the [[Gauda Kingdom]] entered Kashmir under the guise of a pilgrimage to Sharada Peeth.<ref name=\":32\" /> Kalhana also describes a rebellion during his own liftetime. Three princes, Lothana, Vigraharaja and Bhoja, rebelled against [[Lohara dynasty#Jayasimha|King Jayasimha of Kashmir]]. These princes, pursued by the Royal Army, sought refuge in the upper Kishenganga Valley, in the Sirahsila Castle. Kalhana believed that the Royal Army took refuge in Sharada Peeth, because it had the open space required for a temporary military village, and because the area surrounding the Sirahsila Castle was not large enough to host a camp for a siege without the siege force being vulnerable to archers.<ref name=\"Qazi 111\u20131202\" />[[File:Raja_Ravi_Varma_-_Sankaracharya.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|299x299px|Adi Shankara, who opened Sharada Peeth's south door]]In the 14th century text ''Madhaviya Shankara Vijayam'', there is a test, unique to Sharada Peeth, known as the ''Sarvajna Peetham'', or Throne of Omniscience.

As he approached the southern door, he was stopped by various learned men from the [[Nyaya]] school of philosophy, Buddhists, [[Digambara|Digambara Jains]], and the followers of [[Jaimini]]. Engaging with them, he managed to persuade all of them of his proficiency in philosophy, and they stood aside to let him open the entrance. Finally, as he was about to ascend the throne, he heard the voice of the goddess Sharada challenging him. The voice said that omniscience was not enough if one was impure, and that Shankara, who lived in the palace of King Amaruka, could not be pure. Shankara replied that his body had never committed a sin, and the sins committed by another could not blemish him.

Historical records of the temple's architecture are scarce. A late 19th century account by [[Aurel Stein]] describes the temple's walls as intact to a height of approximately {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=}}, and its pillars rising approximately {{Convert|16|ft|m|abbr=}}. [[File:Sharada_temple.Stein1893.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sharada_temple.Stein1893.jpg|alt=|thumb|280x280px|A photograph of Sharada Peeth in 1893 by [[Aurel Stein|Sir Aurel Stein]]. A Kashmiri Pandit stands at the entrance]]\nThe compound is situated on a hill, and is approached on its west side, through an imposing stone staircase. The facades are repetitive, possibly because architects disliked plain outside walls, or else possibly so that even if the spire collapsed, a visitor would be able to tell what the temple originally looked like. The design is simple, with a plain conical Sharada spire. The temple sits on a raised [[plinth]], {{Convert|24|sqft|sqm|abbr=}} in area and {{Convert|5.25|ft|m|abbr=}} in height. The walls of the [[cella]] recede {{Convert|2|ft|m|abbr=}} from the edge of the plinth. The temple is surrounded by a quadrangle which measures {{Convert|142|ft|m|abbr=}} by {{Convert|94|ft|m|abbr=}}. The quadrangle is enclosed by walls of {{Convert|11|ft|m|abbr=}} in height and {{Convert|6|ft|m|abbr=}} in width. On the north, east, and south, the walls of the [[cella]] are adorned by [[Trefoil arch|Trefoil arches]] and supporting [[Pilaster|pilasters]], which are constructed in high relief, rising higher than either the walls or pillars. Below these are small, trefoil-headed niches covered by double [[Pediment|pediments]]. Although a pyramidal stone roof is more typical to Kashmiri architecture, in Stein's description, the temple is covered by a low [[shingle roof]]. By the 21st century, the roof is no longer present and the interior of the temple is exposed to the elements. The temple appears imposing even from outside the walled enclosure, because of the plinths it is raised on to equalise the uneven elevations of the ground. The north side of the wall contained a small recess, in which two ancient [[Lingam|''linga'']] could be seen.\n\nThe interior of the cella is plain, and forms a square of {{Convert|12.25|ft|m|abbr=}} on each side. It houses a large slab of stone measuring {{Convert|6|ft|m|abbr=}} by {{Convert|7|ft|m|abbr=}}. This slab covers the holy spring where the goddess Sharada is believed to have appeared to rishi Shandilya. In the 19th century, this sacred spot was surmounted by a red cloth canopy and tinsel. The remainder of the interior was filled with ornaments of worship such as conches and bells. <ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":22\" />\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[\u015a\u0101rad\u0101 script]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=50em}}\n*{{Cite book\n|last=Pollock\n|first=Sheldon\n|year=2006\n|title=Language of the Gods in the World of Men\n|publisher=University of California Press\n|ref=harv\n}}.\n*{{cite book |last1=Chitkara |first1=M.G |title=Kashmir Shaivism: Under Siege |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5CK0DFijayQC&pg=PA273#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=13 August 2012 |edition=2002 |publisher=A.P.H.Publishing Corporation |location= New Delhi|isbn=8176483605 |year=2002 }}\n*{{cite book |last=Pandit |first=Bansi|title=Explore Kashmiri Pandits |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zsoC6GWr47QC&pg=PA84#v=onepage&q=sharda&f=false |accessdate=13 August 2012 |edition=2008 |publisher=Dharma Publications |location=USA |language= |isbn=0963479865 }}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Sharada Peeth}}\n*[http://www.pbase.com/hgharib/shardatemple Photo gallery of Sharada Peeth]\n\n{{Ancient Dharmic centres of Higher Learning|state=expanded}}\n{{Hindu temples in Pakistan}}\n{{Cultural heritage sites in Azad Kashmir}}\n\n[[Category:Adi Shankara]]\n[[Category:Destroyed temples]]\n[[Category:Buddhist universities and colleges]]\n[[Category:Hindu pilgrimage sites in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Hindu temples in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:History of Pakistan]]\n[[Category:History of Kashmir]]\n[[Category:Kashmiri Brahmins]]\n[[Category:Saraswati temples]]\n[[Category:Ancient universities of the Indian subcontinent]]\n[[Category:Forts in Azad Kashmir]]\n[[Category:Neelam District]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in Azad Kashmir]]\n", "name_user": "Kohlrabi Pickle", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAs a centre of learning:minor copyediting", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharada_Peeth"}
