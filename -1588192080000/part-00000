J\u016brmala is a [[Seaside resort|resort]] town stretching {{convert|32|km|mi|0|abbr=in}} and sandwiched between the [[Gulf of Riga]] and the [[Lielupe]] River. It has a {{convert|33|km|0|abbr=in}} stretch of white-sand beach, and a population of 49,325 in 2019, making it the fifth largest city in Latvia.\n\nWhile Latvia was part of the [[Soviet Union]], J\u016brmala was a favorite holiday-resort and tourist destination for high-level Communist Party officials, particularly [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. Although it has many amenities such as beach-houses and concrete hotels remain, some have fallen into disrepair. J\u016brmala remains a tourist attraction with long beaches facing the [[Gulf of Riga]] and romantic wooden houses in the [[Art Nouveau]] style.\n\n== Names and administrative history ==\nThe name '''J\u016brmala''' stems from [[Latvian language|Latvian]] ''j\u016bra'' (\"sea\") and ''mala'' (\"edge\", \"side\", \"margin\"), thus \"seaside\" in [[English language|English]]. \n\nIn 1920, soon after Latvian independence, the town of '''R\u012bgas J\u016brmala''' (\"Seaside of Riga\") was established.<ref>J\u016aRMALA, Nature and Cultural Heritage, Ed. LaimaSlava, Neputns 2004, {{ISBN|9984-729-49-4}}, page 77</ref> In [[German language|German]] it became known as '''Rigasche Strand''' and '''Riga-Strand''' (Beach of Riga), and advertised as part of ''Baltische Riviera'' (the Baltic Riviera)<ref>Der Rigasche Strand - Baltische Riviera: illustrierter F\u00fchrer durch Die Badeorte des Rigaschen Strandes. - Herausg. - [Riga] : Kulturverein des Rigaschen Strandes, [1928?]</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], J\u016brmala lost its autonomy and by 1946 it was a district of Riga.<ref>J\u016aRMALA, Nature and Cultural Heritage, Ed. LaimaSlava, Neputns 2004, {{ISBN|9984-729-49-4}}, page 96</ref> In 1949 this district was enlarged to include [[Priedaine]]. Finally, in 1959 the district of J\u016brmala was removed from the city of Riga and merged with the health resorts [[Sloka, Latvia|Sloka]] and [[\u0136emeri]] to establish '''J\u016brmalas pils\u0113ta''' (City of J\u016brmala).<ref>J\u016aRMALA, Nature and Cultural Heritage, Ed. LaimaSlava, Neputns 2004, {{ISBN|9984-729-49-4}}, page 77</ref> In publications dating from the Soviet period, the city name was occasionally spelled in English as \"Yurmala\", a back-transliteration from Russian ''\u042e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0430''.\n\nAs a result of the administrative territorial reform of Latvia in 2009, J\u016brmala became one of the [[republican cities of Latvia]] (''Republikas pils\u0113tas''), and is currently (2011) the fifth largest by population.\n\n==History==\n[[File:J\u016brmala 2.jpg|left|thumb|Jomas street in Jurmala]]\nThe city of J\u016brmala actually consists of a string of small resorts.

Wealthy landowners began the tradition of relaxing at the seaside, and Russian army officers came here to rest after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], returning later with their families. The peak of the J\u016brmala area's development was the opening of the [[Tor\u0146akalns \u2013 Tukums II Railway|Riga - Tukums railway]] in 1877 (which still passes through J\u016brmala) that gave a great boost to the numbers of visitors, and thus a boost to the development of the town as a resort. J\u016brmala also gained a reputation as a health spa. The sea breeze, pine aroma, mineral springs, and sandy beach encouraged many sanatoriums to develop within the city.\n\nIn Soviet times J\u016brmala was popular with the Communist officials because of its beach and sanatoriums - holidays were also given as rewards for top union members. It became one of the most popular holiday destinations in the whole Union. The spas offered facilities from mud baths to riding therapy and hiking in the woods. In summer there are many concerts.\n\nWhereas [[Riga]] has advanced rapidly to embrace and cater for growing numbers of Western tourists, J\u016brmala has lagged behind. Russians are now subject to strict visa requirements and its beaches have yet to attract significant numbers of Europeans, leaving the tourist industry with a hard task on its hands. However, during the past few years, J\u016brmala has started to recover. Many Russian celebrities, successful businessmen and others have been buying houses near the beach, and lots of different festivals and other activities have brought more and more people to the town each summer. At the moment, J\u016brmala has almost achieved the popularity that it experienced by the Soviet elite.\n\nThe main beach at Majori and another at Bulduri now bear blue eco-flags signalling the sea is clean and safe to swim in, and the [[Latvian Academy of Science]] boasts a hotel for its members in the town. There is also the Midsummer Festival in June, celebrating the longest day of the year.

Most of the buildings were built by [[Baltic German]] and Latvian architects, but there are also works of Russian, Finnish and other architects. J\u016brmala's architecture typically falls into classicism, national romanticism, and modern styles. The town has an official list of 414 historical buildings under protection, as well as over 4,000 wooden structures.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}.

The beach is equipped with playgrounds, small benches, football fields and volleyball courts, as well as descents for prams and wheelchairs. In Spring and Autumn amber pieces can be found on the beach.\n\nEach region's beach has its own character. In [[Majori]] and [[Bulduri]], where the [[Blue Flag beach|Blue Flag]] flies, it is possible to rent water bicycles or relax in the beach cafe. In Dubulti and Dzintari competitions in beach football and volleyball take place, but on Pumpuri beach there is kite surfing and windsurfing.\n\nInternational water sports contests, including [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[sailing]], and [[waterskiing]] that take place on the river Lielupe.\n\n[[File:Pano20.jpg|thumb|700px|center|Panoramic View of the beach at J\u016brmala]]\n\n==Tourist attractions==\n===Livu Akvaparks===\n[[File:L\u012bvu Akvaparks.jpg|thumb|Livu Akvaparks, Jurmala]]\n[[Livu Akvaparks]] ({{lang-lv|L\u012bvu Akvaparks}}) in J\u016brmala is one of the largest water amusement parks in Northern Europe.

language|Latvian]]:|Lv-Jurmala.ogg}} \"seaside\") is a [[city]] in [[Latvia]], about {{convert|25|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Riga]]. J\u016brmala is a [[Seaside resort|resort]] town stretching {{convert|32|km|mi|0|abbr=in}} and sandwiched between the [[Gulf of Riga]] and the [[Lielupe]] River. It has a {{convert|33|km|0|abbr=in}} stretch of white-sand beach, and a population of 49,325 in 2019, making it the fifth largest city in Latvia.\n\nWhile Latvia was part of the [[Soviet Union]], J\u016brmala was a favorite holiday-resort and tourist destination for high-level Communist Party officials, particularly [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. Although it has many amenities such as beach-houses and concrete hotels remain, some have fallen into disrepair. J\u016brmala remains a tourist attraction with long beaches facing the [[Gulf of Riga]] and romantic wooden houses in the [[Art Nouveau]] style.\n\n== Names and administrative history ==\nThe name '''J\u016brmala''' stems from [[Latvian language|Latvian]] ''j\u016bra'' (\"sea\") and ''mala'' (\"edge\", \"side\", \"margin\"), thus \"seaside\" in [[English language|English]]. \n\nIn 1920, soon after Latvian independence, the town of '''R\u012bgas J\u016brmala''' (\"Seaside of Riga\") was established.<ref>J\u016aRMALA, Nature and Cultural Heritage, Ed. LaimaSlava, Neputns 2004, {{ISBN|9984-729-49-4}}, page 77</ref> In [[German language|German]] it became known as '''Rigasche Strand''' and '''Riga-Strand''' (Beach of Riga), and advertised as part of ''Baltische Riviera'' (the Baltic Riviera)<ref>Der Rigasche Strand - Baltische Riviera: illustrierter F\u00fchrer durch Die Badeorte des Rigaschen Strandes. - Herausg. - [Riga] : Kulturverein des Rigaschen Strandes, [1928?]</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], J\u016brmala lost its autonomy and by 1946 it was a district of Riga.<ref>J\u016aRMALA, Nature and Cultural Heritage, Ed. LaimaSlava, Neputns 2004, {{ISBN|9984-729-49-4}}, page 96</ref> In 1949 this district was enlarged to include [[Priedaine]]. Finally, in 1959 the district of J\u016brmala was removed from the city of Riga and merged with the health resorts [[Sloka, Latvia|Sloka]] and [[\u0136emeri]] to establish '''J\u016brmalas pils\u0113ta''' (City of J\u016brmala).<ref>J\u016aRMALA, Nature and Cultural Heritage, Ed. LaimaSlava, Neputns 2004, {{ISBN|9984-729-49-4}}, page 77</ref> In publications dating from the Soviet period, the city name was occasionally spelled in English as \"Yurmala\", a back-transliteration from Russian ''\u042e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0430''.\n\nAs a result of the administrative territorial reform of Latvia in 2009, J\u016brmala became one of the [[republican cities of Latvia]] (''Republikas pils\u0113tas''), and is currently (2011) the fifth largest by population.\n\n==History==\n[[File:J\u016brmala 2.jpg|left|thumb|Jomas street in Jurmala]]\nThe city of J\u016brmala actually consists of a string of small resorts. From west to east, these include [[\u0136emeri]], [[Jaun\u0137emeri]], [[Sloka, Latvia|Sloka]], [[Kauguri, Latvia|Kauguri]], [[Vaivari]], [[Asari, Latvia|Asari]], [[Mellu\u017ei]], [[Pumpuri]], [[Jaundubulti]], [[Dubulti]], [[Majori]], [[Dzintari]], [[Bulduri]] and [[Lielupe]].\n\nJ\u016brmala's reputation as a spa destination began in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Wealthy landowners began the tradition of relaxing at the seaside, and Russian army officers came here to rest after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], returning later with their families. The peak of the J\u016brmala area's development was the opening of the [[Tor\u0146akalns \u2013 Tukums II Railway|Riga - Tukums railway]] in 1877 (which still passes through J\u016brmala) that gave a great boost to the numbers of visitors, and thus a boost to the development of the town as a resort. J\u016brmala also gained a reputation as a health spa. The sea breeze, pine aroma, mineral springs, and sandy beach encouraged many sanatoriums to develop within the city.\n\nIn Soviet times J\u016brmala was popular with the Communist officials because of its beach and sanatoriums - holidays were also given as rewards for top union members. It became one of the most popular holiday destinations in the whole Union. The spas offered facilities from mud baths to riding therapy and hiking in the woods. In summer there are many concerts.\n\nWhereas [[Riga]] has advanced rapidly to embrace and cater for growing numbers of Western tourists, J\u016brmala has lagged behind. Russians are now subject to strict visa requirements and its beaches have yet to attract significant numbers of Europeans, leaving the tourist industry with a hard task on its hands. However, during the past few years, J\u016brmala has started to recover. Many Russian celebrities, successful businessmen and others have been buying houses near the beach, and lots of different festivals and other activities have brought more and more people to the town each summer. At the moment, J\u016brmala has almost achieved the popularity that it experienced by the Soviet elite.\n\nThe main beach at Majori and another at Bulduri now bear blue eco-flags signalling the sea is clean and safe to swim in, and the [[Latvian Academy of Science]] boasts a hotel for its members in the town. There is also the Midsummer Festival in June, celebrating the longest day of the year. The \"Jaunais Vilnis\" [[New Wave (competition)]]<ref>[http://www.newwavestars.com/en/]</ref> music festival showcases the latest music from all over Europe. The [[Lonely Planet]] guide to the region states that it is one of the highlights of Latvia.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jurmala is its architecture of the 19th century and a half of the 20th century|url=http://www.riga-guide.com/experiences/jurmala/|accessdate=8 July 2016|work=riga-guide}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Good Stay Eiropa Hotel at night.jpg|thumb|right|J\u016brmala is famous for its wooden houses.]]\nThe most distinguishing architectural feature in J\u016brmala is the prevalence of wooden houses dating from the 19th and first half of the 20th century. Most of the buildings were built by [[Baltic German]] and Latvian architects, but there are also works of Russian, Finnish and other architects. J\u016brmala's architecture typically falls into classicism, national romanticism, and modern styles. The town has an official list of 414 historical buildings under protection, as well as over 4,000 wooden structures.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}. [[Dubulti Station]] is an example of sculptural [[concrete shell]] [[Modernist architecture]].\n[[File:Emilija Racene Former Establishment, Jurmala, Latvia.jpg|thumb|Former Swimming Establishment of Emilija Racene on the beach in [[Majori]] - The building was constructed at the beginning of the 20th century and saw its expansion in 1914.

The shallow coastal waters are suitable and safe for children. The beach is equipped with playgrounds, small benches, football fields and volleyball courts, as well as descents for prams and wheelchairs. In Spring and Autumn amber pieces can be found on the beach.\n\nEach region's beach has its own character. In [[Majori]] and [[Bulduri]], where the [[Blue Flag beach|Blue Flag]] flies, it is possible to rent water bicycles or relax in the beach cafe. In Dubulti and Dzintari competitions in beach football and volleyball take place, but on Pumpuri beach there is kite surfing and windsurfing.\n\nInternational water sports contests, including [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[sailing]], and [[waterskiing]] that take place on the river Lielupe.\n\n[[File:Pano20.jpg|thumb|700px|center|Panoramic View of the beach at J\u016brmala]]\n\n==Tourist attractions==\n===Livu Akvaparks===\n[[File:L\u012bvu Akvaparks.jpg|thumb|Livu Akvaparks, Jurmala]]\n[[Livu Akvaparks]] ({{lang-lv|L\u012bvu Akvaparks}}) in J\u016brmala is one of the largest water amusement parks in Northern Europe.
