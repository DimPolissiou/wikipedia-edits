Twenty-four helicopters were upgraded to IAR 330 SOCAT in cooperation with [[Elbit Systems]] ([[Israel]]).<ref>[http://www.roaf.ro/en/dotare/socat_en.php IAR-330 Puma SOCAT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007120023/http://www.roaf.ro/en/dotare/socat_en.php |date=2007-10-07 }}</ref>\n\n==Design and development==\n\n===Production===\nDespite being a [[COMECON]] and [[Warsaw Pact]] member, Romania strove for some measure of independence from the USSR. Instead of buying popular Soviet designs, Romania bought a licence to manufacture the French [[A\u00e9rospatiale SA 330 Puma]] on 30 July 1974. The first licensed helicopter was flown on 22 October 1975 under the designation IAR-330L.<ref name=marnix/>\n\nAt least 163 of these helicopters have been built, out of which 104 were assigned to Romania's military, 2 were retained by the manufacturer and 57 were produced for export<ref name=marnix/> ([[Pakistan]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Sudan]], [[Ecuador]]). There is also a search and rescue (SAR) version, fitted with inflatable floats for emergency landing at sea, which has been built in a small batch. Production is still ongoing at the [[Industria Aeronautic\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103]] plant at [[Ghimbav]] near [[Bra\u015fov|Bra\u0219ov]].\n\n===SOCAT version===\nIn the 1990s, the Romanian Air Force decided to enhance the combat capabilities of the IAR 330L, making it a [[gunship|universal anti-tank and support helicopter]]. At that time, Romania started to cooperate with Israel on some military programs. The Israeli company [[Elbit Systems]] was chosen, and in September 1995 the Romanian Air Force signed a contract to upgrade 24 helicopters with the SOCAT system (''Sistem Optronic de Cercetare \u0219i Anti-Tanc'').<ref name=marnix/> The first IAR 330L SOCAT was flown on 26 May 1998, from IAR's airfield in [[Ghimbav]], near [[Bra\u0219ov]]. On 23 October 1999, the second prototype flew. The first IAR 330L SOCAT was delivered to a combat unit in 2001. In all, 25 SOCATs were made, including the prototype, rebuilt to production standard in 2005.<ref name=marnix/>\n\nThe IAR 330M NATO is a modernized transport version with the SOCAT version's avionics, but without weapons and [[Optoelectronics|optronic]] systems. Among others, it has a weather radar. Twelve IAR 330Ls were modernized to 330M standard between 2005 and 2008.<ref name=marnix/>\n\n===Naval version===\n\nThe first IAR 330 NAVAL helicopter was officially unveiled at Ghimbav on 30 January 2007. The [[Romanian Naval Forces]] ordered three of this variant. The helicopter is in a similar configuration to the Romanian Air Force variant, including the SOCAT upgrade package; the Navy aircraft also have flotation gear fitted under the nose and main undercarriage fairings. They are operated from Navy frigates for [[search and rescue]], [[medevac]] and maritime surveillance missions.<ref>[http://www.zf.ro/articol_132511/primul_elicopter_iar_330_puma_naval_intra_maine_in_serviciul_fnr.html ''First IAR 330 Puma Naval helicopter enters Romanian Naval Forces service''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623183227/http://www.zf.ro/articol_132511/primul_elicopter_iar_330_puma_naval_intra_maine_in_serviciul_fnr.html |date=2008-06-23 }}, [[Ziarul Financiar]], July 12, 2007.

The area quickly evolved into several small agricultural communities. As the area soon began to flourish, a county government was established and a courthouse was built in Jerseyville, the county seat. The Jersey County Courthouse was designed by architect Henry Elliott who also designed the courthouses in nearby [[Greene County, Illinois|Greene County]], [[Edgar County, Illinois]], [[DeWitt County, Illinois]] (later demolished in 1987) and [[Pike County, Illinois]]. The cornerstone for the courthouse was laid on July 4, 1893. The Romanesque Revival style courthouse is a magnificent architectural structure of limestone quarried from the nearby town of Grafton, Illinois.\n<gallery>\nFile:Jersey County Illinois 1839.png|Jersey County at the time of its creation in 1839\n</gallery>\n\n===Recent history===\nToday, while the county maintains its agricultural base, it is also within commuting distance of jobs and industry in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] and the surrounding area.  A large portion of the population works outside of Jersey County and benefits from being \"Near the crowd, but not in it.\", the official slogan of the [http://www.jerseycounty.org/ Jersey County Business Association's] advertising campaign. The bordering rivers play an important part in Jersey County's economy by supporting agricultural producers and [[agribusiness]], and by creating a strong tourist market.

Spring is the wettest season and produces severe weather ranging from tornadoes to snow or ice storms. Summers are hot and humid, and the humidity often makes the [[heat index]] rise to temperatures feeling well above {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. Fall is mild with lower humidity and can produce intermittent bouts of heavy rainfall with the first [[snow flurry|snow flurries]] usually forming in late November. Winters can be cold at times with periodic light snow and temperatures below freezing.\n\nIn recent years, average temperatures in Jerseyville have ranged from a low of {{convert|17|\u00b0F}} in January to a high of {{convert|88|\u00b0F}} in July. The record low temperature of {{convert|-25|\u00b0F}} was recorded in January 1977 and the record high temperature of {{convert|112|\u00b0F}} was recorded in July 1954.

It voted solidly Democratic until [[Warren G. Harding]] carried the county in his record 1920 landslide. It voted Republican again in [[Herbert Hoover]]\u2019s landslide of 1920 and 1928, but otherwise was firmly Democratic until [[World War II]], when opposition to US involvement turned the county to [[Wendell Willkie]] and then [[Thomas E. Dewey]]. Between 1948 and 2004, Jersey County became something of a [[bellwether]] county, voting for every winning Presidential candidate except in the Catholicism-influenced 1960 election, and that of 1988 which was heavily influenced by [[1988\u201389 North American drought|a major Midwestern drought]]. Disagreement with the Democratic Party\u2019s liberal views on social issues since the 1990s has caused a powerful swing back to the Republicans in the past quarter-century.<ref>Cohn, Nate; [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/upshot/southern-whites-loyalty-to-gop-nearing-that-of-blacks-to-democrats.html \u2018Demographic Shift: Southern Whites\u2019 Loyalty to G.O.P.

The area quickly evolved into several small agricultural communities. As the area soon began to flourish, a county government was established and a courthouse was built in Jerseyville, the county seat. The Jersey County Courthouse was designed by architect Henry Elliott who also designed the courthouses in nearby [[Greene County, Illinois|Greene County]], [[Edgar County, Illinois]], [[DeWitt County, Illinois]] (later demolished in 1987) and [[Pike County, Illinois]]. The cornerstone for the courthouse was laid on July 4, 1893. The Romanesque Revival style courthouse is a magnificent architectural structure of limestone quarried from the nearby town of Grafton, Illinois.\n<gallery>\nFile:Jersey County Illinois 1839.png|Jersey County at the time of its creation in 1839\n</gallery>\n\n===Recent history===\nToday, while the county maintains its agricultural base, it is also within commuting distance of jobs and industry in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] and the surrounding area.  A large portion of the population works outside of Jersey County and benefits from being \"Near the crowd, but not in it.\", the official slogan of the [http://www.jerseycounty.org/ Jersey County Business Association's] advertising campaign. The bordering rivers play an important part in Jersey County's economy by supporting agricultural producers and [[agribusiness]], and by creating a strong tourist market. Education, manufacturing, and retail are also among the county's largest industries.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|377|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|369|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|7.9|sqmi}} (2.1%) is water.<ref name=\"census-density\"/> Jersey County is bordered by three bodies of water: the [[Mississippi River]] to the south, the [[Illinois River]] to the west, and [[Macoupin Creek]] to the northwest.\n\n===Climate===\n{{climate chart\n|[[Jerseyville, Illinois]]\n|17|35|1.92\n|22|41|2.01\n|32|53|3.51\n|42|64|4.14\n|52|74|3.95\n|61|83|3.68\n|66|88|3.51\n|63|86|2.91\n|55|79|3.23\n|43|68|2.86\n|34|53|3.77\n|23|40|2.82\n|float=right\n|units=imperial\n|clear=both\n|source=The Weather Channel<ref name=\"weather\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIL0588\n  |title=Monthly Averages for Jerseyville, Illinois\n  |accessdate=2011-01-27\n  |publisher=The Weather Channel\n}}</ref>}}\n\nTypically, the county's climate reflects most [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] areas, located in the transitional zone between the [[humid continental climate]] type and the [[humid subtropical climate]] type ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfa'' and ''Cfa'', respectively), with neither large mountains nor large bodies of water to moderate its temperature. Spring is the wettest season and produces severe weather ranging from tornadoes to snow or ice storms. Summers are hot and humid, and the humidity often makes the [[heat index]] rise to temperatures feeling well above {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. Fall is mild with lower humidity and can produce intermittent bouts of heavy rainfall with the first [[snow flurry|snow flurries]] usually forming in late November. Winters can be cold at times with periodic light snow and temperatures below freezing.\n\nIn recent years, average temperatures in Jerseyville have ranged from a low of {{convert|17|\u00b0F}} in January to a high of {{convert|88|\u00b0F}} in July. The record low temperature of {{convert|-25|\u00b0F}} was recorded in January 1977 and the record high temperature of {{convert|112|\u00b0F}} was recorded in July 1954.

The number, size, and visible locations of these megalithic monuments (especially [[La Hougue Bie]]) have suggested that social organisation over a wide area, including surrounding coasts, was required for the construction.  Archaeological evidence also shows that trading links with [[Brittany]] and the south coast of England existed during this time.\n\n===Hoards===\n\n{{see also|List of hoards in the Channel Islands}}\nEvidence of occupation and wealth has been discovered in the form of [[hoards]]. In 1889, during construction of a house in Saint Helier, a 746-g gold [[torc]] of Irish origin was unearthed. A [[Bronze Age Europe|Bronze Age]] hoard consisting of 110 implements, mostly spears and swords, was discovered in Saint Lawrence in 1976 - probably a smith's stock.

Tradition has it that [[Helier|Saint Helier]] from [[Tongeren]] in modern-day Belgium first brought Christianity to the island in the 6th century, part of the walls of the [[Fishermen's Chapel]] dates from this period and [[Charlemagne]] sent his emissary to the island (at that time called ''Angia'', also spelt ''Agna'')<ref>{{cite web | title = History of stamps | publisher = [[Jersey Post]] | url = http://www.jerseypost.com/jppage.aspx?id=170 | accessdate = 2006-10-24 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061022131444/http://www.jerseypost.com/jppage.aspx?id=170 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-10-22}}</ref> in 803.

The Channel Islands remained politically linked to [[Brittany]] until 933, when [[William I of Normandy|William Longsword]], [[Duke of Normandy]] seized the [[Cotentin peninsula|Cotentin]] and the islands and added them to his domain; in 1066, Duke [[William I of England|William II]] of [[Normandy]] defeated [[Harold Godwinson|Harold]] at [[Battle of Hastings|Hastings]] to become king of England; however, he continued to rule his French possessions as a separate entity,<ref>{{cite web | title = A Short Constitutional History of Jersey | publisher = Voisin & Co | date = 1999-05-18 | url = http://www.voisinlaw.com/default.asp?contentID=368 | accessdate = 2009-06-25 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101206062513/http://www.voisinlaw.com/default.asp?contentID=368 | archive-date = 2010-12-06 | url-status = dead }}</ref> as [[fealty]] was owed as a Duke, to the King of France.\n\nAccording to the Rolls of the Norman Exchequer, in 1180 Jersey was divided for administrative purposes into three ministeria:<ref>{{cite book |last=Stapleton |first=Thomas |title=Magni rotuli scaccarii Normanni\u00e6 sub regibus Angli\u00e6 |date=1840}}</ref> ''de Gorroic'', ''de Groceio'' and ''de Crapau Doit'' (possibly containing four parishes each).<ref name=\"BHJ\">{{cite book |last=Syvret |first=Marguerite |title=Balleine\u2019s History of Jersey |publisher= The History Press  |date=2011 |ISBN= 978-1860776502 }}</ref>{{rp|23}} This was a time of building or extending churches with most parish churches in the island being built/rebuilt in a Norman style chosen by the abbey or priory to which each church had been granted.

In the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]] (1259), the King of France gave up claim to the Channel Islands. The claim was based upon his position as feudal overlord of the Duke of Normandy. The King of England gave up claim to mainland Normandy and appointed a Warden, a position now termed [[Lieutenant Governor of Jersey]] and a [[bailiff]] to govern in his stead. The Channel Islands were never absorbed into the Kingdom of England.

There was no attempt to introduce English law. The law was conducted through 12 jurats, constables (''conn\u00e9table'') and a bailiff (''Baill\u00e9''). These titles have different meanings and duties to those in England.<ref name=BHJ/>{{rp|27\u20138}}\n\n[[Mont Orgueil]] castle was built at this time to serve as a royal fortress and military base.

The island was held by the French until 1468, when Yorkist forces and [[Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey|local militia]] were able to recapture the castle.<ref>Watts (2004), pp. 16\u201317</ref>\n\nDue to the island's strategic importance to the English crown, the islanders were able to negotiate, over a number of centuries, the right to retain privileges and improve on certain benefits, such as trade rights, from the King.\n\n==Reformation to the civil war==\nDuring the 16th century, ideas of the reformation of the church coupled with the split with the Catholic Faith by [[Henry VIII of England]], resulted in the islanders adopting the [[Protestant]] religion, in 1569 the churches moved under the control of the [[Diocese of Winchester]].<ref name=BHJ/>{{rp|81}} [[Calvinism]] in Jersey meant that life became very austere. Laws were strictly enforced, punishment for wrong doers was severe, but education was improved.<ref name=BHJ/>{{rp|83\u20136}}\n\nThe excommunication of [[Elizabeth I of England]] by the Pope increased the military threat to the island and the increasing use of gunpowder on the battlefield meant that the fortifications on the island had to be adapted. A new fortress was built to defend [[Saint Aubin, Jersey|St Aubin's Bay]], the new [[Elizabeth Castle]] was named after the queen by Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] when he was governor. The island militia was reorganised on a parish basis and each parish had two cannon which were usually housed in the church - one of the [[Saint Peter, Jersey|St Peter]] cannon can still be seen at the bottom of Beaumont Hill.\n\n[[Image:Map of Jersey by G Mercator 1639..JPG|thumb|250px|This map of Jersey, published in 1639, shows interior details such as Le Mont \u00e8s Pendus (the gallows hill, now called Westmount).

The civil war also divided Jersey, and while the sympathy of islanders lay with Parliament, the de Carterets (see Sir [[George Carteret]] and Sir [[Philippe de Carteret II]]) held the island for the king.\n\nThe Prince of Wales, the future [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] visited the island in 1646 and again in October 1649 following the [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|trial]] and [[execution of Charles I|execution]] of his father, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].

The Jersey merchants built up a thriving business empire in the Newfoundland and [[Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula|Gasp\u00e9]] fisheries. Companies such as Robins and the Le Boutilliers set up thriving businesses.\n\n==18th century==\n[[Image:Jersey round tower.jpg|thumb|left|Round towers were built along the coasts to protect the Island from French attack.]]\nBy the 1720s, a discrepancy in coinage values between Jersey and France was threatening economic stability. The States of Jersey therefore resolved to [[Devaluation|devalue]] the [[Liard (coin)|liard]] to six to the [[Sou (coin)|sou]]. The legislation to that effect implemented in 1729 caused popular riots that shook the establishment.<ref>*''Balleine's History of Jersey'', Marguerite Syvret and Joan Stevens (1998) {{ISBN|1-86077-065-7}}</ref> The devaluation was therefore cancelled.\n\nThe [[Chamber of Commerce]] founded 24 February 1768 is the oldest in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].\n\nThe ''Code'' of 1771 laid down for the first time in one place the extant laws of Jersey, and from this time, the functions of the Royal Court and the States of Jersey were delimited, with sole legislative power vested in the States.\n\n[[Methodism]] arrived in Jersey in 1774, brought by fishermen returning from [[Newfoundland]]. Conflict with the authorities ensued when men refused to attend militia drill when that coincided with chapel meetings. The Royal Court attempted to proscribe Methodist meetings, but King George III refused to countenance such interference with liberty of religion. The first Methodist minister in Jersey was appointed in 1783, and [[John Wesley]] preached in Jersey in August 1789, his words being interpreted into the vernacular for the benefit of those from the country parishes. The first building constructed specifically for Methodist worship was erected in [[Saint Ouen, Jersey|St. Ouen]] in 1809.\n\n[[Image:John Singleton Copley 001.jpg|thumb|''[[The Death of Major Peirson]]'', [[John Singleton Copley]], 1782\u20131784.]]\n\nThe 18th century was a period of political tension between Britain and France, as the two nations clashed all over the world as their ambitions grew. Because of its position, Jersey was more or less on a continuous war footing.\n\nDuring the [[American Wars of Independence]], two attempted invasions of the island were made. In 1779, the Prince of Orange [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]] was prevented from landing at St Ouen's Bay; on 6 January 1781, a force led by [[Baron de Rullecourt]] captured St Helier in a daring dawn raid, but was defeated by a British army led by Major [[Francis Peirson]] in  the [[Battle of Jersey]]. A short-lived peace was followed by the French Revolutionary Wars and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] which, when they had ended, had changed Jersey forever. In 1799\u20131800, over 6000 Russian troops under the command of [[Charles du Houx de Viom\u00e9nil]] were quartered in Jersey after an evacuation of Holland.\n\nThe first printing press was introduced to Jersey in 1784.\n\n==19th century==\n[[Image:Jersey cattle judging-1.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Jersey cattle]] were developed as a breed during the 19th century. Judging the quality of cows remains a feature of rural life.]]\n\nThe number of English-speaking soldiers stationed on the island and the number of retired officers and English-speaking labourers who came to the islands in the 1820s led to the island gradually moving towards an English-speaking culture in the town.\n\nThe ''[[livre tournois]]'' had been used as the legal [[currency]] for centuries. However, it was abolished during the [[French Revolution]]ary period. Although the coins were no longer minted, they remained the legal currency in Jersey until 1837, when dwindling supplies and consequent difficulties in trade and payment obliged the adoption of the [[Jersey pound|pound sterling]] as [[legal tender]].\n\nThe military roads constructed (on occasion at gunpoint in the face of opposition from landowners) by the governor, [[George Don (British Army officer)|General George Don]], to link coastal fortifications with St. Helier harbour had an unexpected effect on agriculture once peace restored reliable trade links. Farmers in previously isolated valleys were able to swiftly transport crops grown in the island's [[microclimate]] to waiting ships and then on to the markets of London and Paris ahead of the competition. In conjunction with the introduction of [[steamship]]s and the development of the French and British [[railway]] systems, Jersey's agriculture was no longer as isolated as before.\n\nThe population of Jersey rose rapidly, from 47,544 in 1841 to 56,078 20 years later, despite a 20% mortality rate amongst new born children. Life expectancy was 35 years. Both immigration and emigration increased.<ref name=\"RL\"/>{{rp|186}}\n\nThe town expanded with many new streets and houses in a Georgian style, in 1843 it was agreed to erect street names.

The population fell slightly in the 20 years to 1881.\n\nIn the late 19th century, as the former thriving [[cider]] and wool industries declined, island farmers benefited from the development of two luxury products - [[Jersey cattle]] and [[Jersey Royal]] potatoes. The former was the product of careful and selective breeding programmes; the latter was a total fluke.\n\nThe anarchist philosopher, [[Peter Kropotkin]], who visited the Channel Islands in 1890, 1896, and 1903, described the agriculture of Jersey in ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]''.\n\nThe 19th century also saw the rise of [[tourism]] as an important industry (linked with the improvement in passenger ships)<ref name=RL/>{{rp|196}} which reached its climax in the period from the end of the Second World War to the 1980s.\n\n==20th century==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[New World Tapestry]].

The States of Jersey refused and offered instead a one-off contribution to war costs. After negotiations, Jersey's one-off contribution was accepted.\n\nThe first motor car had arrived in 1899, and by the 1930s, competition from motor buses had rendered the railways unprofitable, with final closure coming in 1935 (except for the later German reintroduction of rail during the military occupation).

In the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]] (1259), the King of France gave up claim to the Channel Islands. The claim was based upon his position as feudal overlord of the Duke of Normandy. The King of England gave up claim to mainland Normandy and appointed a Warden, a position now termed [[Lieutenant Governor of Jersey]] and a [[bailiff]] to govern in his stead. The Channel Islands were never absorbed into the Kingdom of England. However the churches in Jersey were left under the control of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Coutances|Diocese of Coutances]] for another 300 years.<ref name=BHJ/>{{rp|27}}\n\nThe existing Norman customs and laws were allowed to continue, with the exception that the ultimate head of the legal system was the King of England rather than the Duke of Normandy. There was no attempt to introduce English law. The law was conducted through 12 jurats, constables (''conn\u00e9table'') and a bailiff (''Baill\u00e9''). These titles have different meanings and duties to those in England.<ref name=BHJ/>{{rp|27\u20138}}\n\n[[Mont Orgueil]] castle was built at this time to serve as a royal fortress and military base.

An English relief fleet arrived in time.<ref>Ford (2004), p. 23</ref> On 7 October 1406, 1,000 French men at arms led by Pero Nino, a Castilian nobleman turned corsair, invaded Jersey, landing at St Aubin's Bay and defeated the 3,000 defenders but failed to capture the island.<ref name=BHJ/>{{rp|50\u20131}}\n\nThe rise of [[Joan of Arc]] inspired France to evict the English from mainland France, with the exception of Calais, putting Jersey back in the front line.<ref name=BHJ/>{{rp|54}} The French did not succeed in capturing Jersey during the Hundred Years' War, but by taking advantage of the split in England during the [[Wars of the Roses]] captured Mont Orgueil in the summer of 1461, allegedly as part of a secret deal between [[Margaret of Anjou]] and [[Pierre de Br\u00e9z\u00e9]] to gain French support for the Lancastrian cause. The island was held by the French until 1468, when Yorkist forces and [[Royal Militia of the Island of Jersey|local militia]] were able to recapture the castle.<ref>Watts (2004), pp. 16\u201317</ref>\n\nDue to the island's strategic importance to the English crown, the islanders were able to negotiate, over a number of centuries, the right to retain privileges and improve on certain benefits, such as trade rights, from the King.\n\n==Reformation to the civil war==\nDuring the 16th century, ideas of the reformation of the church coupled with the split with the Catholic Faith by [[Henry VIII of England]], resulted in the islanders adopting the [[Protestant]] religion, in 1569 the churches moved under the control of the [[Diocese of Winchester]].<ref name=BHJ/>{{rp|81}} [[Calvinism]] in Jersey meant that life became very austere.

A new fortress was built to defend [[Saint Aubin, Jersey|St Aubin's Bay]], the new [[Elizabeth Castle]] was named after the queen by Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] when he was governor. The island militia was reorganised on a parish basis and each parish had two cannon which were usually housed in the church - one of the [[Saint Peter, Jersey|St Peter]] cannon can still be seen at the bottom of Beaumont Hill.\n\n[[Image:Map of Jersey by G Mercator 1639..JPG|thumb|250px|This map of Jersey, published in 1639, shows interior details such as Le Mont \u00e8s Pendus (the gallows hill, now called Westmount).

The civil war also divided Jersey, and while the sympathy of islanders lay with Parliament, the de Carterets (see Sir [[George Carteret]] and Sir [[Philippe de Carteret II]]) held the island for the king.\n\nThe Prince of Wales, the future [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] visited the island in 1646 and again in October 1649 following the [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|trial]] and [[execution of Charles I|execution]] of his father, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. In the Royal Square in [[Saint Helier|St. Helier]] on 17 February 1649, Charles was publicly proclaimed king after his father's death (following the first public proclamation in Edinburgh on 5 February 1649).<ref>{{cite book |first=Maija |last=Jansso |title=Art and Diplomacy: Seventeenth-Century English Decorated Royal Letters to Russia and the Far East |publisher=BRILL, 2015 |ISBN=9789004300453 |page=204}}</ref> Parliamentarian forces eventually captured the island in 1651 and Elizabeth Castle seven weeks later.

The Jersey merchants built up a thriving business empire in the Newfoundland and [[Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula|Gasp\u00e9]] fisheries. Companies such as Robins and the Le Boutilliers set up thriving businesses.\n\n==18th century==\n[[Image:Jersey round tower.jpg|thumb|left|Round towers were built along the coasts to protect the Island from French attack.]]\nBy the 1720s, a discrepancy in coinage values between Jersey and France was threatening economic stability. The States of Jersey therefore resolved to [[Devaluation|devalue]] the [[Liard (coin)|liard]] to six to the [[Sou (coin)|sou]]. The legislation to that effect implemented in 1729 caused popular riots that shook the establishment.<ref>*''Balleine's History of Jersey'', Marguerite Syvret and Joan Stevens (1998) {{ISBN|1-86077-065-7}}</ref> The devaluation was therefore cancelled.\n\nThe [[Chamber of Commerce]] founded 24 February 1768 is the oldest in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].\n\nThe ''Code'' of 1771 laid down for the first time in one place the extant laws of Jersey, and from this time, the functions of the Royal Court and the States of Jersey were delimited, with sole legislative power vested in the States.\n\n[[Methodism]] arrived in Jersey in 1774, brought by fishermen returning from [[Newfoundland]]. Conflict with the authorities ensued when men refused to attend militia drill when that coincided with chapel meetings. The Royal Court attempted to proscribe Methodist meetings, but King George III refused to countenance such interference with liberty of religion. The first Methodist minister in Jersey was appointed in 1783, and [[John Wesley]] preached in Jersey in August 1789, his words being interpreted into the vernacular for the benefit of those from the country parishes. The first building constructed specifically for Methodist worship was erected in [[Saint Ouen, Jersey|St. Ouen]] in 1809.\n\n[[Image:John Singleton Copley 001.jpg|thumb|''[[The Death of Major Peirson]]'', [[John Singleton Copley]], 1782-1784.]]\n\nThe 18th century was a period of political tension between Britain and France, as the two nations clashed all over the world as their ambitions grew. Because of its position, Jersey was more or less on a continuous war footing.\n\nDuring the [[American Wars of Independence]], two attempted invasions of the island were made. In 1779, the Prince of Orange [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]] was prevented from landing at St Ouen's Bay; on 6 January 1781, a force led by [[Baron de Rullecourt]] captured St Helier in a daring dawn raid, but was defeated by a British army led by Major [[Francis Peirson]] in  the [[Battle of Jersey]]. A short-lived peace was followed by the French Revolutionary Wars and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] which, when they had ended, had changed Jersey forever. In 1799-1800, over 6000 Russian troops under the command of [[Charles du Houx de Viom\u00e9nil]] were quartered in Jersey after an evacuation of Holland.\n\nThe first printing press was introduced to Jersey in 1784.\n\n==19th century==\n[[Image:Jersey cattle judging-1.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Jersey cattle]] were developed as a breed during the 19th century. Judging the quality of cows remains a feature of rural life.]]\n\nThe number of English-speaking soldiers stationed on the island and the number of retired officers and English-speaking labourers who came to the islands in the 1820s led to the island gradually moving towards an English-speaking culture in the town.\n\nThe ''[[livre tournois]]'' had been used as the legal [[currency]] for centuries. However, it was abolished during the [[French Revolution]]ary period. Although the coins were no longer minted, they remained the legal currency in Jersey until 1837, when dwindling supplies and consequent difficulties in trade and payment obliged the adoption of the [[Jersey pound|pound sterling]] as [[legal tender]].\n\nThe military roads constructed (on occasion at gunpoint in the face of opposition from landowners) by the governor, [[George Don (British Army officer)|General George Don]], to link coastal fortifications with St. Helier harbour had an unexpected effect on agriculture once peace restored reliable trade links. Farmers in previously isolated valleys were able to swiftly transport crops grown in the island's [[microclimate]] to waiting ships and then on to the markets of London and Paris ahead of the competition. In conjunction with the introduction of [[steamship]]s and the development of the French and British [[railway]] systems, Jersey's agriculture was no longer as isolated as before.\n\nThe population of Jersey rose rapidly, from 47,544 in 1841 to 56,078 20 years later, despite a 20% mortality rate amongst new born children. Life expectancy was 35 years. Both immigration and emigration increased.<ref name=\"RL\"/>{{rp|186}}\n\nThe town expanded with many new streets and houses in a Georgian style, in 1843 it was agreed to erect street names.

The population fell slightly in the 20 years to 1881.\n\nIn the late 19th century, as the former thriving [[cider]] and wool industries declined, island farmers benefited from the development of two luxury products - [[Jersey cattle]] and [[Jersey Royal]] potatoes. The former was the product of careful and selective breeding programmes; the latter was a total fluke.\n\nThe anarchist philosopher, [[Peter Kropotkin]], who visited the Channel Islands in 1890, 1896, and 1903, described the agriculture of Jersey in ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]''.\n\nThe 19th century also saw the rise of [[tourism]] as an important industry (linked with the improvement in passenger ships)<ref name=RL/>{{rp|196}} which reached its climax in the period from the end of the Second World War to the 1980s.\n\n==20th century==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[New World Tapestry]].

The States of Jersey refused and offered instead a one-off contribution to war costs. After negotiations, Jersey's one-off contribution was accepted.\n\nThe first motor car had arrived in 1899, and by the 1930s, competition from motor buses had rendered the railways unprofitable, with final closure coming in 1935 (except for the later German reintroduction of rail during the military occupation).

The Census estimated Jenks' population as 23,354 in 2018.<ref>[http://censusviewer.com/city/OK/JenksCensusViewer:Jenks, Oklahoma Population.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203083421/http://censusviewer.com/city/OK/JenksCensusViewer:Jenks, |date=2015-02-03 }} Retrieved January 5, 2014.</ref>\n\n==History==\nJenks began in 1904 as a community site established by the [[Midland Valley Railroad]] between [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] and [[Muskogee, Oklahoma|Muskogee]], alongside the [[Arkansas River]]. Though the river could only be utilized by shallow draft [[steamboat]]s while the water level was up, these two transportation routes proved vital to Jenks' early development.\n\nJenks was named after William Henry Jenks the owner and director of the [[Midland Valley Railroad]].  According to a 1957 article in the ''Tulsa Tribune'', an agent for the townsite company was told by the railroad home office to name a town for the director.<ref name=\"EOHC-Jenks\">Davidson, Bridget. ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture''. \"Jenks.\" [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/J/JE004.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018203351/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/J/JE004.html |date=2010-10-18 }}</ref>\n\nThe town was officially platted on July 15, 1905. Also in 1905, a major [[petroleum]] discovery was made, further bolstering the economy of the area. The \"[[Glenn Pool]]\" oil well and subsequent oil claims brought many business people to the general area. In 1906, many [[oil depot]]s (also known as \"tank farms\") were constructed in Jenks. By the time of statehood, Jenks had 465 inhabitants.\n\nAs oil production waned, tank farms were dismantled, and agriculture became once again a major contributor to the Jenks economy. The economy of the area was further improved in the 1920s when many [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] families immigrated to the area to farm. These immigrants established many vegetable farms.\n\nFrom 1904 through the 1950s, Jenks experienced many floods from the overflow of the [[Arkansas River]] and Polecat Creek. In the 1920s and 1930s floods were very severe.  During one flood in the late 1920s the water was so deep that it completely covered every building but the roof of the three-story-high school.  Everyone was evacuated except two men and one woman.  They had one shotgun, one small boat, food and a tent on top of the school.  They guarded the remains of Jenks for several weeks until the water receded.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}  In 1948, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] built a [[levee]] around Jenks, and the community subsequently grew as a result of the increased safety and security. There was another threat of [[Flooding and flood control in Tulsa|severe flooding in 1986]], when severe rainstorms upstream along the Arkansas River the Corps of Engineers to release as much as 300,000 cubic feet per second from the [[Keystone Dam]] into the river. This caused a mandatory evacuation order in Jenks and several other river communities.<ref name=\"Palmer\">[http://newsok.com/tulsa-area-residents-move-out-as-corps-releases-record-flood/article/2161843 Palmer, Griff and Bobby Trammell. \"Tulsa Area Residents Move Out As Corps Releases Record Flood.\"]  NewsOK.

In 1910, a single-lane bridge was built and strengthened the economic success of the area. 1948 saw the construction of a replacement two-lane bridge which still stands today and now serves as a pedestrian crossing between the Riverwalk and the South Tulsa River Parks.  The original 1910 bridge was destroyed and all that is left are a few columns and pieces of metal that are seen when the water level is low. A four-lane bridge was built in 1996.\n\nThe current [[Jenks High School|High School]] building was built in 1960-61 and has had 3 major additions.  The United States Census of 1970 placed the population of the City at 1990 and there were approximately 1100 student in public school.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Tulsa water system was expanded into Jenks. That decade also saw the construction of a nearby [[American Electric Power|Public Service of Oklahoma]] gas-fired electric power plant. These developments improved the infrastructure of the area and helped the economy.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[Kimberly-Clark]] built a manufacturing facility that provides many jobs for the area to this day.\n\n==Geography==\nJenks is located at {{coord|36|0|37|N|95|58|47|W|type:city}} (36.010276, -95.979850).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020527061848/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|archive-date=2002-05-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20121203233054/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/40/4037800.html United States Census Bureau], the city has a total area of {{convert|17.73|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|17.13|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.6|sqmi|km2}} of it (3.69%) is water.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 290\n|1920= 1508\n|1930= 1110\n|1940= 1026\n|1950= 1037\n|1960= 1734\n|1970= 2685\n|1980= 5876\n|1990= 7493\n|2000= 9577\n|2010= 16924\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=23354\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"GR2\" /><ref name=\"Census1910\">{{cite web|title=Population-Oklahoma|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/36894832v3ch3.pdf|work=U.S. Census 1910|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1930\">{{cite web|title=Population-Oklahoma|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/03815512v1ch08.pdf|work=15th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=27 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Oklahoma|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/37749197v1p38ch2.pdf|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Oklahoma: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-38.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=25 November 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archive-date=11 June 2013|df= }}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2000 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 9,557 people, 3,451 households, and 2,757 families residing in the city.

The city's population was 9,557 in the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]], but by 2010, the population was 16,924, an increase of 77.1 percent. The Census estimated Jenks' population as 23,354 in 2018.<ref>[http://censusviewer.com/city/OK/JenksCensusViewer:Jenks, Oklahoma Population.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203083421/http://censusviewer.com/city/OK/JenksCensusViewer:Jenks, |date=2015-02-03 }} Retrieved January 5, 2014.</ref>\n\n==History==\nJenks began in 1904 as a community site established by the [[Midland Valley Railroad]] between [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] and [[Muskogee, Oklahoma|Muskogee]], alongside the [[Arkansas River]]. Though the river could only be utilized by shallow draft [[steamboat]]s while the water level was up, these two transportation routes proved vital to Jenks' early development.\n\nJenks was named after William Henry Jenks the owner and director of the [[Midland Valley Railroad]].  According to a 1957 article in the ''Tulsa Tribune'', an agent for the townsite company was told by the railroad home office to name a town for the director.<ref name=\"EOHC-Jenks\">Davidson, Bridget. ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture''. \"Jenks.\" [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/J/JE004.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018203351/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/J/JE004.html |date=2010-10-18 }}</ref>\n\nThe town was officially platted on July 15, 1905. Also in 1905, a major [[petroleum]] discovery was made, further bolstering the economy of the area. The \"[[Glenn Pool]]\" oil well and subsequent oil claims brought many business people to the general area. In 1906, many [[oil depot]]s (also known as \"tank farms\") were constructed in Jenks. By the time of statehood, Jenks had 465 inhabitants.\n\nAs oil production waned, tank farms were dismantled, and agriculture became once again a major contributor to the Jenks economy. The economy of the area was further improved in the 1920s when many [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] families immigrated to the area to farm. These immigrants established many vegetable farms.\n\nFrom 1904 through the 1950s, Jenks experienced many floods from the overflow of the [[Arkansas River]] and Polecat Creek. In the 1920s and 1930s floods were very severe.  During one flood in the late 1920s the water was so deep that it completely covered every building but the roof of the three-story-high school.  Everyone was evacuated except two men and one woman.  They had one shotgun, one small boat, food and a tent on top of the school.  They guarded the remains of Jenks for several weeks until the water receded.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}  In 1948, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] built a [[levee]] around Jenks, and the community subsequently grew as a result of the increased safety and security. There was another threat of [[Flooding and flood control in Tulsa|severe flooding in 1986]], when severe rainstorms upstream along the Arkansas River the Corps of Engineers to release as much as 300,000 cubic feet per second from the [[Keystone Dam]] into the river. This caused a mandatory evacuation order in Jenks and several other river communities.<ref name=\"Palmer\">[http://newsok.com/tulsa-area-residents-move-out-as-corps-releases-record-flood/article/2161843 Palmer, Griff and Bobby Trammell. \"Tulsa Area Residents Move Out As Corps Releases Record Flood.\"]  NewsOK.

In 1910, a single-lane bridge was built and strengthened the economic success of the area. 1948 saw the construction of a replacement two-lane bridge which still stands today and now serves as a pedestrian crossing between the Riverwalk and the South Tulsa River Parks.  The original 1910 bridge was destroyed and all that is left are a few columns and pieces of metal that are seen when the water level is low. A four-lane bridge was built in 1996.\n\nThe current [[Jenks High School|High School]] building was built in 1960-61 and has had 3 major additions.  The United States Census of 1970 placed the population of the City at 1990 and there were approximately 1100 student in public school.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Tulsa water system was expanded into Jenks. That decade also saw the construction of a nearby [[American Electric Power|Public Service of Oklahoma]] gas-fired electric power plant. These developments improved the infrastructure of the area and helped the economy.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[Kimberly-Clark]] built a manufacturing facility that provides many jobs for the area to this day.\n\n==Geography==\nJenks is located at {{coord|36|0|37|N|95|58|47|W|type:city}} (36.010276, -95.979850).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020527061848/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|archive-date=2002-05-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20121203233054/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/40/4037800.html United States Census Bureau], the city has a total area of {{convert|17.73|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|17.13|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.6|sqmi|km2}} of it (3.69%) is water.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 290\n|1920= 1508\n|1930= 1110\n|1940= 1026\n|1950= 1037\n|1960= 1734\n|1970= 2685\n|1980= 5876\n|1990= 7493\n|2000= 9577\n|2010= 16924\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=23354\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=Sources:<ref name=\"GR2\" /><ref name=\"Census1910\">{{cite web|title=Population-Oklahoma|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/36894832v3ch3.pdf|work=U.S. Census 1910|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1930\">{{cite web|title=Population-Oklahoma|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/03815512v1ch08.pdf|work=15th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=27 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Census1960\">{{cite web|title=Number of Inhabitants: Oklahoma|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/37749197v1p38ch2.pdf|work=18th Census of the United States|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=\"Census1990\">{{cite web|title=Oklahoma: Population and Housing Unit Counts|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen1990/cph2/cph-2-38.pdf|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"CensusPopEst\">{{cite web|title=Incorporated Places and Minor Civil Divisions Datasets: Subcounty Population Estimates: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2012|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=25 November 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130611010502/http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012.html|archive-date=11 June 2013|df= }}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2000 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 9,557 people, 3,451 households, and 2,757 families residing in the city.

After the incorporation of local lands to Poland in 1945, the city was given the name of Jelenia G\u00f3ra. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Latin words appear in different records, for example Mons Cervi, Cervimontia, Monscervinus, Cervigera. The Polish name Jelenia G\u00f3ra together with Hyrszberg is mentioned in the book \"Kr\u00f3tki rys jeografii Szl\u0105ska dla nauki pocz\u0105tkowej\" published in [[G\u0142og\u00f3wek]] in 1847 by writer J\u00f3zef Lompa.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Hirschberg Notiz 1384.png|thumb|left|207px|First documented mention of Jelenia G\u00f3ra - ''Hirsb(er)g'', 1384]]\nThe city's origins officially date back to the legendary founding of the settlement by Polish prince [[Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth]] in 1108,<ref>[http://um.jeleniagora.pl/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1&Itemid=6&lang=pl Informacje Og\u00f3lne] Jelenia G\u00f3ra City Official Webpage</ref> and in 2008 celebrated its 900th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wroclaw.naszemiasto.pl/archiwum/1747536,900-bebnow-na-900-lat-jeleniej-gory,id,t.html|title=900 b\u0119bn\u00f3w na 900 lat Jeleniej G\u00f3ry - Wroc\u0142aw - NaszeMiasto.pl|website=wroclaw.naszemiasto.pl|accessdate=25 September 2017}}</ref> Jelenia Gora is also mentioned as having been used as a base by [[Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth]] for his campaigns against the [[Duchy of Bohemia|Czechs]] in 1110.<ref>Piotr Pregiel, Tomasz Przerwa, ''Dzieje \u015al\u0105ska'' (''The History of Silesia''), page 30 ''W odwecie Krzywousty najecha\u0142 Czechy (1110), zaskakuj\u0105c przeciwnika przej\u015bciem przez Karkonosze (wykorzystuj\u0105c baz\u0119 w Jeleniej G\u00f3rze)''.

A Protestant school was built in 1566. In 1560 a fire destroyed large parts of the city and stopped the economic development, which until then had been characterized by linen-weaving. The city recovered when Joachim Girnth, a shoemaker on a return journey from [[Holland]], introduced veil-weaving. The first \"light veils\" were offered in 1625, and five years later the city received an imperial privilege by [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] for these veils.\n\n[[File:PL Jelenia G\u00f3ra Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 Podwy\u017cszenia Krzy\u017ca \u015aw. 03.JPG|thumb|left|Holy Cross Church, 18th-century]]\n[[File:Paulinum hotel Jelenia Gora.jpg|thumb|left|Paulinum Palace, now a hotel]]\n\nDuring the [[Thirty Years' War]] the city suffered badly. Hirschberg was beleaguered by troops of both parties, paid high contributions, and during a siege in 1634 the city burned down again. Two more sieges followed in 1640 and 1641. The town needed several years to recover. One reason for the new boost was the creation of a merchant society 1658, which secured Hirschberg's position as the most important center of linen and veil trade in the Silesian mountains during the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nThe Protestants of the city were oppressed during the [[Counter-Reformation]], but the second [[Altranst\u00e4dt|Treaty of Altranst\u00e4dt]], which allowed a Protestant community center and church to be established outside the medieval city walls, brought relief. Great sacrifices by the merchant society, especially its most prominent member Christian Menzel, made the construction of a large church, modeled after [[Katarina Church|Church of Catherine in Stockholm]], possible. The cemetery of the church was the preferred burial place for most merchant families.\n\nHirschberg was annexed with [[Lower Silesia]] by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] during the [[Silesian Wars]]. The city was again partly destroyed, had to pay contributions and was seized several times. The detachment from Austria and the new border in the mountains to the south badly damaged the economy as the merchants lost a large part of their customers. Although Prussia took on substantial efforts to revive the economy, they never recovered completely and finally lost their position during the [[industrial revolution]].\n\nIn 1800, [[John Quincy Adams]], ambassador in Berlin at that time and future [[President of the United States]], visited Hirschberg<ref name=KH>{{cite web|title=Kalendarium historyczne|url=http://turystyka.jeleniagora.pl/content/kalendarium-historyczne|publisher=City of Jelenia G\u00f3ra|accessdate=6 August 2014|language=Polish}}</ref> and said: \"Nothing can be more beautiful than the location of Hirschberg, a beautifully built city with numerous splendid buildings, in a valley surrounded by hills on all sides, with the magnificent view of the Giant Mountains (Karkonosze/Riesengebirge Mountains)\".\n\n[[File:0001 Jelenia G\u00f3ra - ratusz.jpg|thumb|right|Town Hall, built between 1744 and 1749, is located on the main square]]\n\nIn 1871 the town became part of the [[German Empire]] with the Prussian-led [[unification of Germany]], as one of the largest towns in the [[Province of Silesia]]. In 1889 the ''Deutsche Riesengebirgsverein'' (German Giant Mountains Club), an organization to protect the environment of the Giant Mountains ([[Krkono\u0161e]]) and to promote tourism, was founded by Theodor Donat and 47 other dignitaries of the region.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], the town became part of the Prussian [[Province of Lower Silesia]] in 1919, and in 1922 became a separate city. During the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]] under the regime of [[Adolf Hitler]], a subcamp of [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp|KZ Gross-Rosen]] was located in Hirschberg. On September 1, 1939, the day of the German [[invasion of Poland]] and the outbreak of [[World War II]], [[Luftwaffe]] used the airport in Hirschberg to conduct air raids on Poland.<ref>Basa\u0142ygo, ''[[Op. cit.]]'', p. 236</ref> In April 1940, the first transport of 2,000 [[Poles]] deported from [[Sosnowiec]], [[B\u0119dzin]] and [[Olkusz]] for [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labor]] arrived to the city.<ref>Basa\u0142ygo, ''Op. cit.'', p. 241</ref> In the city, the Germans organized 19 labor camps in which they imprisoned mainly Poles, Czechs, Frenchmen and Belgians, but also Luxembourgers, Russians, Ukrainians, Greeks, Estonians, including women.

The town was handed over to Polish Authorities. German inhabitants reported of being protected from the Polish authorities by the Soviet command. In Hirschberg region the Polish army began expelling Germans from the town and surrounding villages in mid June 1945 to west of the [[Oder-Neisse line]] which was 70 km to the west. It has been reported that Soviet authorities often stopped expulsions and arrested Polish soldiers executing the expulsion.\n\nAccording to the decisions of the [[Potsdam Conference]], the town was placed under Polish administration and became officially known by its Polish name of Jelenia G\u00f3ra, which was first recorded in 1882, and is a literal translation of the German name \"Hirschberg\".<ref name=\"Barbara Czopek 1995, pp.66\"/> All remaining [[Germans|German]] inhabitants were [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled westward]]<ref>Franke, p.13</ref> and new [[Poles|Polish settlers]] came to the area.

In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the population was about six thousand people, to rise up to about 20 thousand in the early twentieth century. The population of Hirschberg/Jelenia Gora in 1939 increased to over 35 thousand people and after World War II, the city had a population of 39 thousand residents, including more than 35 thousand Germans. During the period 1945-1947 the German population was mostly expelled from Jelenia Gora. After the creation of (voivodeship) Jelenia G\u00f3ra province in 1975 and connection to the city surrounding towns, including [[:pl:Cieplice \u015al\u0105skie-Zdr\u00f3j|Cieplice \u015al\u0105skie-Zdr\u00f3j]], Population increased to 80 thousand. In subsequent years, the city's population grew, but mainly as a result of joining another nearby villages.  The population rose to 93,570 inhabitants by 1996, but after the administrative reform in 1998 and the establishment of Lower Silesia [[voivodeship]], the population of Jelenia Gora is steadily decreasing.

Dungeons served as a prison. In 1480, the tower due to strong wind collapsed burying five people. Quickly it was rebuilt by adding the clock and the dome with a lantern, and this state has survived to this day. Coats of arms have been placed on the pillars: Prussian, Silesia, urban and inscription. In 1869, the gate was dismantled and moved to the barracks at Obro\u0144c\u00f3w Pokoju street. After the renovation in 1998, returned to its former place. Located inside the medieval bastion was the St. Anne Chapel of the Wojanowska gate. In the portal above the entrance to the chapel there is an inscription: \" \u201eHonorI Magnae ChrIstI aVlae DIVae Annae ereCta\u201d\"(built for the glory of the great grandmother of Christ, St. Anna) with a hidden date of 1715.\n\nThe Basilica of St. Erasmus and St. Pancras built in the 14th century features the chapel dedicated to the Patrons of Jelenia Gora; however, it got its present form in the next century. The church was built of stone in the form of a three-nave basilica topped with a tower. Even today, you can admire numerous Gothic stone details best preserved in portals and window frames. The southern portal is exceptionally rich and interesting. Two sepulchral chapels (from the 17th and 18th century) were built into the church's walls; over 20 epitaphs and tombstones from the 16th and 18th century were placed on the two chapels. The main entrance to the chapel is located on the west, on the ground floor. The interior is also Gothic, but the fittings come from Renaissance and Baroque. The incredibly rich and monumental altar from the 18th century dominates the interior. The temple also houses priceless organs from the same period made in the workshop of an Italian organ builder \u2013 Adam Casparini. The 16th century pulpit and the intarsiated (made of different wood types) choir stalls are a little older. There are also two 18th century figures on the church grounds \u2013 the Marian column is near the main entrance, and on the northern side there is a sculpture of St. John of Nepomuk. It used to be located on one bridge over the M\u0142ynowka river; however, after it was damaged and then reconstructed in the 19th century, it was moved to its present place.\n\n[[File:Feast of the Holy Cross Church.png|thumb|right|Feast of the Holy Cross Church]]\n\nThe Feast of the Holy Cross Church was erected as a proof of grace of the catholic Emperor of Austria for the Silesian evangelicals. Under the arrangement concluded in Altranstadt after a religious war they were granted the right to build six churches in Silesia which at that time was under Austrian rule. The design of the temple was prepared by the architect, Martin Frantz of Tallinn. The construction works lasted nine years (1709\u20131718) and the newly built church was deceptively similar to its prototype \u2013 St. Catherine's Church in Stockholm (the work of the same designer). The structure was erected on the plan of a cross and topped with a dome. The interior was equipped with a three-storey matronea which can accommodate more than two thousand members of the congregation. The railings were adorned with citations and paintings displaying scenes from the Old and New Testament. The altar together with the organ front placed over it make up an extended, beautifully adorned architectural form.\n\nThe town hall is the central point of the market square. The building was erected between 1744 and 1749. The entire square is surrounded by Baroque tenement houses with arcades, which originally used to serve the merchants to sell their goods. At the beginning of the 20th century the tenement houses near the City Hall were bought and adjoined to the town hall (the so-called \"Seven-Houses\"). Right next to the town hall there is a fountain with a sculpture of Neptune \u2013 god of the seas. The sculpture is to commemorate old trade relations with overseas lands.\n\n[[File:Schaffgotsch Palace - Cieplice.png|thumb|Schaffgotsch Palace \u2013 Cieplice]]\nThe Schaffgotsch family ruling vast lands around Karkonosze settled in Cieplice in 1675.

After the incorporation of local lands to Poland in 1945, the city was given the name of Jelenia G\u00f3ra. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Latin words appear in different records, for example Mons Cervi, Cervimontia, Monscervinus, Cervigera. The Polish name Jelenia G\u00f3ra together with Hyrszberg is mentioned in the book \"Kr\u00f3tki rys jeografii Szl\u0105ska dla nauki pocz\u0105tkowej\" published in [[G\u0142og\u00f3wek]] in 1847 by writer J\u00f3zef Lompa.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Hirschberg Notiz 1384.png|thumb|left|207px|First documented mention of Jelenia G\u00f3ra - ''Hirsb(er)g'', 1384]]\nThe city's origins officially date back to the legendary founding of the settlement by Polish prince [[Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth]] in 1108,<ref>[http://um.jeleniagora.pl/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1&Itemid=6&lang=pl Informacje Og\u00f3lne] Jelenia G\u00f3ra City Official Webpage</ref> and in 2008 celebrated its 900th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wroclaw.naszemiasto.pl/archiwum/1747536,900-bebnow-na-900-lat-jeleniej-gory,id,t.html|title=900 b\u0119bn\u00f3w na 900 lat Jeleniej G\u00f3ry - Wroc\u0142aw - NaszeMiasto.pl|website=wroclaw.naszemiasto.pl|accessdate=25 September 2017}}</ref> Jelenia Gora is also mentioned as having been used as a base by [[Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth]] for his campaigns against the [[Duchy of Bohemia|Czechs]] in 1110.<ref>Piotr Pregiel, Tomasz Przerwa, ''Dzieje \u015al\u0105ska'' (''The History of Silesia''), page 30 ''W odwecie Krzywousty najecha\u0142 Czechy (1110), zaskakuj\u0105c przeciwnika przej\u015bciem przez Karkonosze (wykorzystuj\u0105c baz\u0119 w Jeleniej G\u00f3rze)''.

A Protestant school was built in 1566. In 1560 a fire destroyed large parts of the city and stopped the economic development, which until then had been characterized by linen-weaving. The city recovered when Joachim Girnth, a shoemaker on a return journey from [[Holland]], introduced veil-weaving. The first \"light veils\" were offered in 1625, and five years later the city received an imperial privilege by [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] for these veils.\n\n[[File:PL Jelenia G\u00f3ra Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 Podwy\u017cszenia Krzy\u017ca \u015aw. 03.JPG|thumb|left|Holy Cross Church, 18th-century]]\n[[File:Paulinum hotel Jelenia Gora.jpg|thumb|left|Paulinum Palace, now a hotel]]\n\nDuring the [[Thirty Years' War]] the city suffered badly. Hirschberg was beleaguered by troops of both parties, paid high contributions, and during a siege in 1634 the city burned down again. Two more sieges followed in 1640 and 1641. The town needed several years to recover. One reason for the new boost was the creation of a merchant society 1658, which secured Hirschberg's position as the most important center of linen and veil trade in the Silesian mountains during the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nThe Protestants of the city were oppressed during the [[Counter-Reformation]], but the second [[Altranst\u00e4dt|Treaty of Altranst\u00e4dt]], which allowed a Protestant community center and church to be established outside the medieval city walls, brought relief. Great sacrifices by the merchant society, especially its most prominent member Christian Menzel, made the construction of a large church, modeled after [[Katarina Church|Church of Catherine in Stockholm]], possible. The cemetery of the church was the preferred burial place for most merchant families.\n\nHirschberg was annexed with [[Lower Silesia]] by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] during the [[Silesian Wars]]. The city was again partly destroyed, had to pay contributions and was seized several times. The detachment from Austria and the new border in the mountains to the south badly damaged the economy as the merchants lost a large part of their customers. Although Prussia took on substantial efforts to revive the economy, they never recovered completely and finally lost their position during the [[industrial revolution]].\n\nIn 1800, [[John Quincy Adams]], ambassador in Berlin at that time and future [[President of the United States]], visited Hirschberg<ref name=KH>{{cite web|title=Kalendarium historyczne|url=http://turystyka.jeleniagora.pl/content/kalendarium-historyczne|publisher=City of Jelenia G\u00f3ra|accessdate=6 August 2014|language=Polish}}</ref> and said: \"Nothing can be more beautiful than the location of Hirschberg, a beautifully built city with numerous splendid buildings, in a valley surrounded by hills on all sides, with the magnificent view of the Giant Mountains (Karkonosze/Riesengebirge Mountains)\".\n\n[[File:0001 Jelenia G\u00f3ra - ratusz.jpg|thumb|right|Town Hall, built between 1744 and 1749, is located on the main square]]\n\nIn 1871 the town became part of the [[German Empire]] with the Prussian-led [[unification of Germany]], as one of the largest towns in the [[Province of Silesia]]. In 1889 the ''Deutsche Riesengebirgsverein'' (German Giant Mountains Club), an organization to protect the environment of the Giant Mountains ([[Krkono\u0161e]]) and to promote tourism, was founded by Theodor Donat and 47 other dignitaries of the region.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], the town became part of the Prussian [[Province of Lower Silesia]] in 1919, and in 1922 became a separate city. During the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi era]] under the regime of [[Adolf Hitler]], a subcamp of [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp|KZ Gross-Rosen]] was located in Hirschberg. On September 1, 1939, the day of the German [[invasion of Poland]] and the outbreak of [[World War II]], [[Luftwaffe]] used the airport in Hirschberg to conduct air raids on Poland.<ref>Basa\u0142ygo, ''[[Op. cit.]]'', p. 236</ref> In April 1940, the first transport of 2,000 [[Poles]] deported from [[Sosnowiec]], [[B\u0119dzin]] and [[Olkusz]] for [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labor]] arrived to the city.<ref>Basa\u0142ygo, ''Op. cit.'', p. 241</ref> In the city, the Germans organized 19 labor camps in which they imprisoned mainly Poles, Czechs, Frenchmen and Belgians, but also Luxembourgers, Russians, Ukrainians, Greeks, Estonians, including women.

The town was handed over to Polish Authorities. German inhabitants reported of being protected from the Polish authorities by the Soviet command. In Hirschberg region the Polish army began expelling Germans from the town and surrounding villages in mid June 1945 to west of the [[Oder-Neisse line]] which was 70 km to the west. It has been reported that Soviet authorities often stopped expulsions and arrested Polish soldiers executing the expulsion.\n\nAccording to the decisions of the [[Potsdam Conference]], the town was placed under Polish administration and became officially known by its Polish name of Jelenia G\u00f3ra, which was first recorded in 1882, and is a literal translation of the German name \"Hirschberg\".<ref name=\"Barbara Czopek 1995, pp.66\"/> All remaining [[Germans|German]] inhabitants were [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled westward]]<ref>Franke, p.13</ref> and new [[Poles|Polish settlers]] came to the area.

Dungeons served as a prison. In 1480, the tower due to strong wind collapsed burying five people. Quickly it was rebuilt by adding the clock and the dome with a lantern, and this state has survived to this day. Coats of arms have been placed on the pillars: Prussian, Silesia, urban and inscription. In 1869, the gate was dismantled and moved to the barracks at Obro\u0144c\u00f3w Pokoju street. After the renovation in 1998, returned to its former place. Located inside the medieval bastion was the St. Anne Chapel of the Wojanowska gate. In the portal above the entrance to the chapel there is an inscription: \" \u201eHonorI Magnae ChrIstI aVlae DIVae Annae ereCta\u201d\"(built for the glory of the great grandmother of Christ, St. Anna) with a hidden date of 1715.\n\nThe Basilica of St. Erasmus and St. Pancras built in the 14th century features the chapel dedicated to the Patrons of Jelenia Gora; however, it got its present form in the next century. The church was built of stone in the form of a three-nave basilica topped with a tower. Even today, you can admire numerous Gothic stone details best preserved in portals and window frames. The southern portal is exceptionally rich and interesting. Two sepulchral chapels (from the 17th and 18th century) were built into the church\u2019s walls; over 20 epitaphs and tombstones from the 16th and 18th century were placed on the two chapels. The main entrance to the chapel is located on the west, on the ground floor. The interior is also Gothic, but the fittings come from Renaissance and Baroque. The incredibly rich and monumental altar from the 18th century dominates the interior. The temple also houses priceless organs from the same period made in the workshop of an Italian organ builder \u2013 Adam Casparini. The 16th century pulpit and the intarsiated (made of different wood types) choir stalls are a little older. There are also two 18th century figures on the church grounds \u2013 the Marian column is near the main entrance, and on the northern side there is a sculpture of St. John of Nepomuk. It used to be located on one bridge over the M\u0142ynowka river; however, after it was damaged and then reconstructed in the 19th century, it was moved to its present place.\n\n[[File:Feast of the Holy Cross Church.png|thumb|right|Feast of the Holy Cross Church]]\n\nThe Feast of the Holy Cross Church was erected as a proof of grace of the catholic Emperor of Austria for the Silesian evangelicals. Under the arrangement concluded in Altranstadt after a religious war they were granted the right to build six churches in Silesia which at that time was under Austrian rule. The design of the temple was prepared by the architect, Martin Frantz of Tallinn. The construction works lasted nine years (1709\u20131718) and the newly built church was deceptively similar to its prototype \u2013 St. Catherine\u2019s Church in Stockholm (the work of the same designer). The structure was erected on the plan of a cross and topped with a dome. The interior was equipped with a three storey matronea which can accommodate more than two thousand members of the congregation. The railings were adorned with citations and paintings displaying scenes from the Old and New Testament. The altar together with the organ front placed over it make up an extended, beautifully adorned architectural form.\n\nThe town hall is the central point of the market square. The building was erected between 1744 and 1749. The entire square is surrounded by Baroque tenement houses with arcades, which originally used to serve the merchants to sell their goods.
