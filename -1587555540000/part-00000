After she completed \"five months\" ({{bibleref|Luke|1:21-25|9}}) of her pregnancy, Gabriel is mentioned again:\n\n<blockquote><poem>Luke 1:26 \u00b6 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,\n27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name ''was'' Mary.\n28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, ''thou that art'' highly favoured, the Lord ''is'' with thee: blessed ''art'' thou among women.\n29 And when she saw ''him'', she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.\n30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.\n31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.\n32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:\n33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.\n34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?\n35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\n36 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.\n37 For with God nothing shall be impossible.\n38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.\n({{bibleref|Luke|1:26-38|KJV}} KJV) (other versions: {{bibleref|Luke|1:26-38|!}})</poem></blockquote>\n\nGabriel only appears by name in those two passages in Luke. In the first passage the angel identified himself as Gabriel, but in the second it is Luke who identified him as Gabriel.  The only other named angels in the New Testament are Michael the Archangel (in {{bibleref|Jude|1:9|9}}) and [[Abaddon]] (in {{bibleref|Revelation|9:11|9}}). Gabriel is not called an archangel in the Bible. Believers are expressly warned not to worship angels (in {{bibleref|Colossians|2:18-19|9}} and {{bibleref|Revelation|19:10|9}}).<ref>See also Easton's Bible Dictionary [[s:Easton's Bible Dictionary (1897)/Angel|angel]] entry</ref>\n\n===Gabriel's horn===\nThe [[Literary trope|trope]] of Gabriel blowing a trumpet blast to indicate the Lord's return to Earth is especially familiar in [[Spirituals]]. However, though the Bible mentions a trumpet blast preceding the resurrection of the dead, it never specifies Gabriel as the trumpeter. Different passages state different things: the angels of the Son of Man (Matthew 24:31); the voice of the Son of God (John 5:25-29); God's trumpet (I Thessalonians 4:16); seven angels sounding a series of blasts (Revelation 8-11); or simply \"a trumpet will sound\" (I Corinthians 15:52).<ref name=\"svm\">S.

In Judaism, trumpets are prominent, and they seem to be blown by God himself, or sometimes [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]]. In [[Zoroastrianism]], there is no trumpeter at the last judgement. In Islamic tradition, it is [[Israfil]] who blows the trumpet, though he is not named in the [[Qur'an]]. The Christian [[Church Fathers]] do not mention Gabriel as the trumpeter; early English literature similarly does not.<ref name=\"svm\"/>\n\nThe earliest known identification of Gabriel as the trumpeter comes in John Wycliffe's 1382 tract, ''De Ecclesi\u00e6 Dominio''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tracts & Treatises of John De Wycliffe, D.D.|last=Vaughn|first=Robert|publisher=Wycliffe Society|year=1845|isbn=|location=|pages=79|via=}}</ref> In the year 1455, in [[Armenian art]], there is an illustration in an Armenian manuscript showing Gabriel sounding his trumpet as the dead climb out of their graves.<ref>Walters MS 543, fol. 14.</ref> Two centuries later, Gabriel is identified as the trumpeter, in [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667):<ref name=\"svm\"/><ref>Milton, ''Paradise Lost'', XI.72ff</ref>\n<blockquote><poem>\nBetwixt these rockie pillars Gabriel sat\nChief of the Angelic guards (IV.545f)...\nHe ended, and the Son gave signal high\nTo the bright minister that watch'd, he blew\nHis trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps\nWhen God descended, and perhaps once more\nTo sound at general doom.

After she completed \"five months\" ({{bibleref|Luke|1:21-25|9}}) of her pregnancy, Gabriel is mentioned again:\n\n<blockquote><poem>Luke 1:26 \u00b6 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,\n27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name ''was'' Mary.\n28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, ''thou that art'' highly favoured, the Lord ''is'' with thee: blessed ''art'' thou among women.\n29 And when she saw ''him'', she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.\n30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.\n31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.\n32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:\n33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.\n34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?\n35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.\n36 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.\n37 For with God nothing shall be impossible.\n38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word.

In the first passage the angel identified himself as Gabriel, but in the second it is Luke who identified him as Gabriel.  The only other named angels in the New Testament are Michael the Archangel (in {{bibleref|Jude|1:9|9}}) and [[Abaddon]] (in {{bibleref|Revelation|9:11|9}}). Gabriel is not called an archangel in the Bible.

However, though the Bible mentions a trumpet blast preceding the resurrection of the dead, it never specifies Gabriel as the trumpeter. Different passages state different things: the angels of the Son of Man (Matthew 24:31); the voice of the Son of God (John 5:25-29); God's trumpet (I Thessalonians 4:16); seven angels sounding a series of blasts (Revelation 8-11); or simply \"a trumpet will sound\" (I Corinthians 15:52).<ref name=\"svm\">S.

In Judaism, trumpets are prominent, and they seem to be blown by God himself, or sometimes [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]]. In [[Zoroastrianism]], there is no trumpeter at the last judgement. In Islamic tradition, it is [[Israfil]] who blows the trumpet, though he is not named in the [[Qur'an]].

The Proto-Villanovans practiced [[cremation]] and buried the ashes of their dead in pottery urns of a distinctive double-cone shape. Generally speaking, Proto-Villanovan settlements have been found in almost the whole Italian peninsula from Veneto to eastern Sicily, although they were most numerous in the northern-central part of Italy. The most important settlements excavated are those of Frattesina in [[Veneto]] region, [[Pietra di Bismantova|Bismantova]] in [[Emilia-Romagna]] and near the [[Monti della Tolfa]], north of [[Rome]]. The Latino-Faliscans, the [[Adriatic Veneti|Veneti]], and possibly the [[Osco-Umbrian languages|Osco-Umbrians]] too, have been associated with this culture.\n\nIn the 13th century BCE, Proto-[[Celts]] (probably the ancestors of the [[Lepontii]] people), coming from the area of modern-day [[Switzerland]], eastern [[France]] and south-western Germany (''RSFO'' Urnfield group), entered [[Northern Italy]] ([[Lombardy]] and eastern [[Piedmont]]), starting the [[Canegrate culture]], who not long time after, merging with the indigenous [[Ligurians]], produced the mixed [[Golasecca culture]].\n\n===Iron Age===\n[[File:Italy 400bC en.svg|thumb|Ethnic groups of Italy (as defined by today's borders) in 400 BC.]]\nIn the early Iron Age, the relatively homogeneous Proto-Villanovan culture (1200-900 BCE), closely associated with the Celtic [[Halstatt culture]] of Alpine Austria, characterised by the introduction of iron-working and the practice of cremation coupled with the burial of ashes in distinctive pottery, shows a process of fragmentation and regionalisation. In Tuscany and in part of Emilia-Romagna, Latium and [[Campania]], the Proto-Villanovan culture was followed by the [[Villanovan culture]]. The earliest remains of Villanovan culture date back to circa 900 BCE.\n\nIn the region south of the [[Tiber]] (''Latium Vetus''), the [[Latial culture]] of the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]] emerged, while in the north-east of the peninsula the [[Este culture]] of the Veneti appeared. Roughly in the same period, from their core area in central Italy (modern-day [[Umbria]] and [[Sabina (region)|Sabina]] region), the [[Osci|Osco]]-[[Umbri|Umbrians]] began to emigrate in various waves, through the process of [[Ver sacrum]], the ritualized extension of colonies, in southern Latium, [[Molise]] and the whole southern half of the peninsula, replacing the previous tribes, such as the [[Opici]] and the [[Oenotrians]]. This corresponds with the emergence of the Terni culture, which had strong similarities with the Celtic cultures of Hallstatt and [[La T\u00e8ne culture|La T\u00e8ne]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Leonelli|first1=Valentina|title=La necropoli delle Acciaierie di Terni: contributi per una edizione critica|page=33|edition=Cestres}}</ref> The Umbrian necropolis of [[Terni]], which dates back to the 10th century BCE, was identical in every aspect to the Celtic necropolis of the Golasecca culture.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Farinacci|first1=Manlio|title=Carsulae svelata e Terni sotterranea|publisher=Associazione Culturale UMRU - Terni}}</ref>\n\n===Antiquity===\nBy the mid-first millennium BCE, the Latins of [[Rome]] were growing in power and influence. This led to the establishment of [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman civilization]]. In order to combat the non-Italic Etruscans, several Italic tribes united in the [[Latin League]]. After the Latins had liberated themselves from Etruscan rule they acquired a dominant position among the Italic tribes. Frequent conflict between various Italic tribes followed. The best documented of these are the [[Samnite Wars|wars]] between the Latins and the [[Samnites]].<ref name=\"WM452\"/> \n\nThe Latins eventually succeeded in unifying the Italic elements in the country. Many non-Latin Italic tribes adopted Latin culture and acquired Roman citizenship. During this time Italic [[Colonies in antiquity|colonies]] were established throughout the country, and non-Italic elements eventually adopted the [[Latin]] language and culture in a process known as [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]].<ref name=\"EB_Europe\"/> In the early first century BCE, several Italic tribes, in particular the [[Marsi]] and the Samnites, rebelled against Roman rule. This conflict is called the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]]. After Roman victory was secured, all peoples in Italy, except for the [[Celts]] of the Po Valley, were granted [[Roman citizenship]].<ref name=\"WM452\"/>\n\nIn the subsequent centuries, Italic tribes adopted [[Latin]] language and culture in a process known as [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]].

The cable functioned for only three weeks, but it was the first such project to yield practical results. The first official telegram to pass between two continents was a letter of congratulations from [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom]] to [[President of the United States]] [[James Buchanan]] on August 16. Signal quality declined rapidly, slowing transmission to an almost unusable speed. The cable was destroyed the following month when [[Wildman Whitehouse]] applied excessive voltage to it while trying to achieve faster operation. It has been argued that the faulty manufacture, storage and handling of the 1858 cable would have led to premature failure in any case.<ref>{{cite web|last1=de Cogan|first1=D.|title=Dr E.O.W.

A second attempt was undertaken in 1865 with much-improved material and, following some setbacks, a connection was completed and put into service on July 28, 1866. This cable proved more durable.\n\nBefore the first transatlantic cable, communications between Europe and the Americas took place only by ship. Sometimes, however, severe winter storms delayed ships for weeks. The transatlantic cable reduced communication time considerably, allowing a message and a response in the same day. Five attempts to lay a cable were made over a nine-year period \u2013 one in 1857, two in 1858, one in 1865, and one in 1866.  Lasting connections were finally achieved with the 1866 cable and the 1865 cable, which was repaired by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s ship {{SS|Great Eastern||6}}, captained by [[Sir James Anderson]].<ref>Wilson, Arthur (1994).

Morse]] proclaimed his faith in the idea of a submarine line across the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. By 1850 a cable was run between England and France. That same year Bishop [[John T. Mullock]], head of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], proposed a telegraph line through the forest from [[St. John's, Newfoundland|St. John's]] to [[Cape Ray]], and cables across the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] from Cape Ray to [[Nova Scotia]] across the [[Cabot Strait]].\n\nAt about the same time a similar plan occurred to [[Frederic Newton Gisborne]], a telegraph engineer in Nova Scotia. In the spring of 1851, Gisborne procured a grant from the legislature of Newfoundland and, having formed a company, began the construction of the landline. In 1853 his company collapsed, he was arrested for debt and he lost everything.\n\n== A plan takes shape ==\nIn 1854 Gisborne was introduced to [[Cyrus West Field]]. Field invited Gisborne to his house to discuss the project. From his visitor, Field considered the idea that the cable to Newfoundland might be extended across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nField was ignorant of submarine cables and the deep sea. He consulted Morse as well as Lieutenant [[Matthew Maury]], an authority on [[oceanography]].  The charts Maury constructed from [[depth sounding|soundings]] in the logs of multiple ships indicated that there was a feasible route across the Atlantic.  The area seemed so ideal for cable laying that Maury named it [[Telegraph Plateau]].  Maury's charts also predicted that a route going directly to the US was too rugged to be tenable, as well as being longer.<ref>Rozwadowski, p. 83</ref>  Field adopted Gisborne's scheme as a preliminary step to the bigger undertaking, and promoted the [[New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company]] to establish a telegraph line between America and Europe.\n\nThe first step was to finish the line between St. John's and Nova Scotia, which was undertaken by Gisborne and Fields brother, Matthew.<ref>Lindley, p. 128</ref>  In 1855 an attempt was made to lay a cable across the Cabot Strait in the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]]. It was laid out from a [[barque]] in tow of a steamer. When half the cable was laid, a [[gale]] rose, and the line was cut to keep the barque from sinking. In 1856 a [[steamboat]] was fitted out for the purpose, and the link from Cape Ray, Newfoundland to Aspy Bay, Nova Scotia was successfully laid.<ref name=\"HindKeefer1864\">{{cite book|author1=Henry Youle Hind|author2=Thomas C.

Even before forming the a company to carry out the project, Field ordered 2,500 miles of cable from the [[Gutta Percha Company]].<ref>Lindley, p. 129</ref>  The [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]] was formed in October 1856 with Brett as president and Field as vice-president.  [[Charles Tilston Bright]], who already worked for Brett, was made chief engineer.  [[Wildman Whitehouse]], a medical doctor, was appointed chief electrician.  Field provided a quarter of the capital himself.<ref>Clayton, p. 30</ref>  After the  remaining shares were sold, largely to existing investors in Brett's company,<ref>Kieve, pp. 106\u2013107</ref> an unpaid board of directors was formed which included [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], the future Lord Kelvin and a respected scientist.

It weighed nearly 550&nbsp;kg/km (1.1&nbsp;tons per nautical mile), was relatively flexible and was able to withstand a pull of several tens of [[kilonewton]]s (several tons). It was made jointly by two English firms \u2013 [[Enderby's Wharf|Glass, Elliot & Co.]], of [[Greenwich]], and [[R.S. Newall and Company]], of [[Birkenhead]]. Late in manufacturing it was discovered that the respective sections had been made with strands twisted in opposite directions.

Field also solicited aid from the U.S. government. A bill authorizing a subsidy was submitted in [[United States Congress|Congress]]. The subsidy bill passed the [[United States Senate|Senate]] by a single vote, due to opposition from protectionist senators. In the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], the bill encountered similar resistance, but passed, and was signed by President [[Franklin Pierce]].\n\nThe first attempt, in 1857, was a failure. The cable-laying vessels were the converted warships [[HMS Agamemnon (1852)|HMS ''Agamemnon'']] and [[USS Niagara (1855)|USS ''Niagara'']] borrowed from their respective governments.  Both ships were needed as neither was sufficient to hold 2,500 miles of cable alone.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>  The cable was started at the white strand near [[Ballycarbery Castle]] in [[County Kerry]], on the southwest coast of [[Ireland]], on August 5, 1857.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Books/1857Isaac/index.htm |title = History of the Atlantic Cable \u2013 Submarine Telegraphy \u2013 1857 \u2013 Laying the Atlantic Telegraph From Ship To Shore |accessdate = August 5, 2008}}</ref> The cable broke on the first day, but was [[Grappling hook|grappled]] and repaired; it broke again over the Telegraph Plateau, nearly 3,200&nbsp;m (2&nbsp;[[statute mile]]s) deep, and the operation was abandoned for the year.  300 miles of cable had been lost, but with 1,800 miles still remaining, the director's agreed to try again the following year.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>  Also in this period, Morse clashed with Field and takes no further part in the enterprise.<ref>Lindley, p. 134</ref>\n\nThe problems with cables breaking were largely due to difficulty controlling the tension of the cable with the braking mechanism as the cable was payed out.  A new mechanism was designed and successfully trialed in the [[Bay of Biscay]] with ''Agamemnon'' in May 1858.<ref>Lindley, pp. 130, 133</ref>  On 10 June, ''Agamemnon'' and ''Niagara'' set sail to try again.  Ten days out they found themselves in a severe storm and the enterprise was nearly brought to a premature end.  The ships were top heavy with cable that could not all fit in the hold and strugggled not to capsize.  Ten sailors were hurt and Thomson's electrical cabin was flooded.<ref>Lindley, p. 134</ref> The vessels were to meet in the middle of the Atlantic, where the two halves of the cable were to be [[wikt:splice|spliced]] together, and while ''Agamemnon'' paid out eastwards to Valentia Island, ''Niagara'' was to pay out westward to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. On June 26, the middle splice was made and the cable was dropped. Again the cable broke, the first time after less than 5.5&nbsp;km (three nautical miles), again after some 100&nbsp;km (54&nbsp;nautical miles) and for a third time when about 370&nbsp;km (200 nautical miles) of cable had run out of each vessel.\n\nThe expedition returned to [[Queenstown, County Cork]], Ireland, and set out again on July 17, with little enthusiasm among the crews. The middle splice was finished on July 29, 1858. The cable ran easily this time. ''Niagara'' arrived in [[Trinity Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Trinity Bay, Newfoundland]] on August 4 and the next morning the shore end was landed. ''Agamemnon'' made an equally successful run. On August 5, she arrived at Valentia Island, and the shore end was landed at Knightstown and then laid to the nearby cable house.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Article/1858Leslies/index.htm |title = History of the Atlantic Cable \u2013 Submarine Telegraphy \u2013 Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper 1858 Cable News |accessdate = August 5, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==First contact==\n[[File:Irl-ValentiaTelegraph.jpg|thumb|275px|right|The Telegraph Field,<ref name=tel-field>{{cite web|url=http://thetelegraphfield.com|title=\u30b6\u30c6\u30ec\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9|website=thetelegraphfield.com}}</ref> [[Valentia Island]], Ireland, the site of the earliest message sent from Ireland to North America.

Whitehouse was a medical doctor by training but had taken an enthusiastic interest in the new electrical technology and had given up his medical practice to follow a new career.  He had no formal training in physics; all his knowledge had been gained through practical experience.  The two clashed even before the project had started when Whitehouse disputed Thomson's [[law of squares]] when he presented it to a [[British Association]] meeting in 1855.  Thomson's law predicted that transmission speed on the cable would be very slow due to an effect called retardation.<ref>Lindley, p. 125</ref>  Whitehouse, with access to the Magnetic Telegraph Company's lines, was able to join several lines to a distance similar to the transatlantic route and declare that there would be no problem.<ref>Bright, pp. 25\u201326</ref>  Thomson believed that a larger cable was needed, which would improve the retardation problem predicted by the law of squares.  In mid-1857, Thomson, on his own initiative, examined samples of copper core of alleged identical specification and found variations in resistance up to a factor of two.  But the cable manufacturing was already underway and Whitehouse supported use of a thinner cable so Field went with the cheaper option.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>\n[[File:Edward-orange-wildman-whitehouse.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Wildman Whitehouse]]\nAnother point of contention was the itinerary for cable laying.  Thomson favoured starting mid-Atlantic and the two ships heading in opposite directions.  This would halve the time taken to complete.  Whitehouse wanted both ships to travel together from Ireland so that progress could be reported back to the base in Valentia through the cable.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>  Whitehouse overruled Thomson's suggestion on the 1857 voyage, but Bright convinced the directors to approve a mid-ocean start on the subsequent 1858 voyage.<ref>Lindley, p. 134</ref>  Whitehouse, as chief electrician, was supposed to be on board the cable laying vessel, but he declined to go at the last moment.  He repeatedly did this; for the 1857 attempt, the trials in the [[Bay of Biscay]],<ref>Lindley, p. 133</ref> and the attempt in 1858.<ref>Lindley, p. 134</ref>  In 1857, Thomson was sent in his place,<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref> and in 1858 Field diplomatically assigned the two to different ships to avoid conflict, but in the event Thomson went alone.<ref>Lindley, p. 134</ref>\n[[File:Thomsons mirror galvanometer, 1858. (9663806048).jpg|thumb|Thomson's mirror galvanometer]]\nAfter his experience on the 1857 voyage, Thomson realised that a better method of detecting the telegraph signal was required.  He spent the time waiting for a new voyage inventing his [[mirror galvanometer]].  This was an extremely sensitive instrument, much better than any existing equipment.  He requested \u00a32,000 from the board to build several of them, but was only given \u00a3500 for a prototype, and permission to trial it on the next voyage.<ref>Lindley, p. 133</ref>  The mirror galvanometer was extremely good at detecting the positive, or negative edge of a telegraph pulse respectively representing a Morse 'dash' and a Morse 'dot' (this was the standard system on submarine cables \u2013 both pulse types were the same length, unlike overland telegraph).  Thomson believed he could use this instrument with the low voltages from regular telegraph equipment even over the vast length of the Atlantic cable.  He successfully tested the instrument on 2,700 miles of cable in underwater storage at [[Plymouth]].<ref>Lindley, p. 133</ref>\n\nThe mirror galvanometer proved to be yet another point of contention.  Whitehouse wanted to work the cable with a very different scheme.<ref>Voice Across the Sea \u2013 Arthur C Clarke</ref>  He wanted to drive the line with a massive high-voltage [[induction coil]], producing several thousand volts, so that enough current was available to drive standard electromechanical [[printing telegraph]]s used on inland telegraphs.<ref>Lindley, p. 139</ref>  Thomson's instrument had to be read by hand.  It was not capable of printing, but much later he invented the [[syphon recorder]] for the second transatlantic attempt in 1866.<ref>Clayton, p. 73</ref>  The decision to start mid-Atlantic combined with Whitehouse dropping out of another voyage left Thomson, on board ''Agememnon'' sailing towards Ireland, with a free hand to use his equipment without Whitehouse's interference.  Although Thomson had the status of a mere advisor to engineer C. W. de Sauty, it was not long before all electrical decisions were deferred to him.  Whitehouse in Valentia remained out of contact until the ship reached Ireland and landed the cable.<ref>Lindley, pp. 133\u2013134</ref>\n\nAround this time, the board started to have doubts over Whitehouse's generally negative attitude.  Not only did he repeatedly clash with Thomson, but he was also critical of Field, and his repeated refusal to carry out his primary duty as chief electrician on board ship made a very bad impression.  But at this time no action was taken.<ref>Lindley, p. 133</ref>\n\nThe effects of the poor handling and design of the cable, coupled with Whitehouse's repeated attempts to drive the cable with high voltages, resulted in the insulation of the cable being compromised.  All the while, it was taking longer and longer to send messages.  Towards the end, sending half a page of message text was taking as long as a day.\n\nIn September 1858, after several days of progressive deterioration of the insulation, the cable failed. The reaction to this news was tremendous. Some writers even hinted that the line was a mere hoax, and others pronounced it a stock exchange speculation.  In the enquiry that followed, Dr Whitehouse was deemed responsible for the failure, and the company did not escape criticism for employing an electrical engineer with no recognised qualifications.\n\nAlthough the cable was never put into service for public use, and never worked well, there was time for a few messages to be passed that went beyond testing.  The collision between the [[Cunard Line]] ships ''Europa'' and ''Arabia'' was reported on 17 August. The British Government used the cable to countermand an order for two regiments in Canada to embark for England, saving \u00a350,000.  A total of 732 messages were passed before failure.<ref name=\"Kieve, p. 109\"/>\n\n== Preparing a new attempt ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2012|Just about all this section can be cited to the Kieve source I added}}\n\nField was undaunted by the failure. He was eager to renew the work, but the public had lost confidence in the scheme and his efforts to revive the company were futile. It was not until 1864 that, with the assistance of [[Thomas Brassey]] and [[John Pender]], he succeeded in raising the necessary capital. The Glass, Elliot, and Gutta-Percha Companies were united to form the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company (Telcon, later part of [[British Insulated Callender's Cables|BICC]]), which undertook to manufacture and lay the new cable. [[C.F. Varley]] replaced Whitehouse as chief electrician.<ref name=\"guarnieri 7-1\"/>\n\nIn the meantime, long cables had been submerged in the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Red Sea]]. With this experience, an improved cable was designed. The core consisted of seven twisted strands of very pure copper weighing 300 pounds per nautical mile (73&nbsp;kg/km), coated with [[Chatterton's compound]], then covered with four layers of [[gutta-percha]], alternating with four thin layers of the compound cementing the whole, and bringing the weight of the insulator to 400&nbsp;lb/nmi (98&nbsp;kg/km). This core was covered with [[hemp]] saturated in a preservative solution, and on the hemp were helically wound eighteen single strands of high tensile steel wire produced by [[Webster and Horsfall|Webster & Horsfall Ltd]] of Hay Mills [[Birmingham]], each covered with fine strands of [[manila hemp|manila]] yarn steeped in the preservative. The weight of the new cable was 35.75 long [[hundredweight]] (4000&nbsp;lb) per nautical mile (980&nbsp;kg/km), or nearly twice the weight of the old.

On July 13, 1866, ''Great Eastern'' started paying out once more. Despite problems with the weather on the evening of Friday, July 27, the expedition reached the port of Heart's Content in a thick fog. The next morning at 9&nbsp;a.m. a message from England cited these words from the [[editorial|leader]] in ''[[The Times]]'': \"It is a great work, a glory to our age and nation, and the men who have achieved it deserve to be honoured among the benefactors of their race.\" \"Treaty of peace signed between Prussia and Austria.\" The shore end was landed during the day by ''Medway''.

Suddenly, on August 10, ''Albany'' \"caught\" the cable and brought it to the surface. It seemed to be an unrealistically easy success, and that is how it turned out. During the night, the cable slipped from the buoy to which it had been secured and the process had to start all over again. This happened several more times, with the cable slipping after being secured in a frustrating battle against rough seas. One time, a sailor even was flung across the deck when the grapnel rope snapped and recoiled around him. ''Great Eastern'' and another grappling ship, ''Medway'', arrived to join the search on the 12th. It was not until over a fortnight later, in early September 1866, that the cable was finally retrieved so that it could be worked on; it took 26 hours to get it safely on board ''Great Eastern''. The cable was carried to the electrician's room, where it was determined that the cable was connected. All on the ship cheered or wept as rockets were sent up into the sky to light the sea. The recovered cable was then spliced to a fresh cable in her hold, and paid out to [[Heart's Content, Newfoundland and Labrador|Heart's Content, Newfoundland]], where she arrived on Saturday, September 7. There were now two working telegraph lines.\n\n== Repairing the cable ==\nBroken cables required an elaborate repair procedure. The approximate distance to the break is determined by measuring the resistance of the broken cable. The repair ship navigated to the location. The cable was hooked with a grapple and brought on board to test for electrical continuity. Buoys were deployed to mark the ends of good cable and a splice was made between the two ends.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UoxAwrVzc88C&pg=PA515&lpg=PA515&dq=transatlantic+cable+buoy&source=bl&ots=vM5O99xNRP&sig=3J7hvgSPZ2usC7pZwgw3-ZfJgo0&hl=en&ei=ugXKTcmWC-jkiAKmoaWjBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CCwQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=transatlantic+cable+buoy&f=false|title=The Encyclopaedia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information|first=Hugh|last=Chisholm|date=March 18, 2018|publisher=Encyclopaedia britannica Company|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/1915CCC/index.htm|title=History of the Atlantic Cable & Submarine Telegraphy - 1915: How submarine cables are made and laid|website=atlantic-cable.com}}</ref>\n\n==Communication speeds==\nInitially messages were sent by an operator sending [[Morse code]].

This is despite the use of a highly sensitive [[mirror galvanometer]], a new invention at the time.\n\nThe first message on the 1858 cable took over 17 hours to transmit.<ref name=lac-fam-msg>{{cite web |url=http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/205/301/ic/cdc/cable/fmessages.htm |work=Famous Messages Received and Sent |title=1858 August 16 Queen Victoria Sends Telegram to President Buchanan |publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]] |accessdate = July 9, 2010}}</ref>  For the 1866 cable, the methods of cable manufacture, as well as sending messages, had been vastly improved.

[[Oliver Heaviside|Heaviside]] and [[Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin]] in later decades understood that the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of a cable is hindered by an imbalance between capacitive and inductive [[reactance (electronics)|reactance]], which causes a severe [[dispersion relation|dispersion]] and hence a signal distortion; see [[Telegrapher's equations]]. This has to be solved by iron tape or by [[load coil]]s. It was not until the 20th century that message transmission speeds over transatlantic cables would reach even 120 words per minute. Despite this, London had become the world center in telecommunications. Eventually, no fewer than eleven cables radiated from [[Porthcurno]] Cable Station near [[Land's End]] and formed with their Commonwealth links a \"live\" girdle around the world; the [[All Red Line]].\n\n== Later cables ==\nAdditional cables were laid between Foilhommerum and Heart's Content in 1873, 1874, 1880, and 1894. By the end of the 19th century, British-, French-, German-, and American-owned cables linked Europe and North America in a sophisticated web of telegraphic communications.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016|reason=Need a citation for both sentences here.}}\n\nThe original cables were not fitted with [[repeater]]s, which potentially could completely solve the retardation problem and consequently speed up operation.  Repeaters amplify the signal periodically along the line.  On telegraph lines this is done with [[relay]]s, but there was no practical way to power them in a submarine cable. The first transatlantic cable with repeaters was [[TAT-1]] in 1956.  This was a telephone cable and used a different technology for its repeaters.\n\n==Impact==\nA 2018 study in the ''[[The American Economic Review|American Economic Review]]'' found that the transatlantic telegraph substantially increased trade over the Atlantic and reduced prices.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Steinwender|first=Claudia|date=2018|title=Real Effects of Information Frictions: When the States and the Kingdom Became United|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20150681|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=108|issue=3|pages=657\u2013696|doi=10.1257/aer.20150681|issn=0002-8282|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref> The study estimates that \"the efficiency gains of the telegraph to be equivalent to 8 percent of export value\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Robert Halpin]] \u2013 Captain of ''Great Eastern''\n* [[Transatlantic telephone cable]]\n* [[Western Union Telegraph Expedition]] \u2013 overland alternative via Russia\n* [[1929 Grand Banks earthquake]]\n* [[Commercial Cable Company]]\n* [[Enderby's Wharf]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References and further reading ==\n* [[Charles Tilston Bright|Bright, Charles Tilston]], [https://archive.org/details/cihm_00867/page/n3 ''Submarine Telegraphs''], London: Crosby Lockwood, 1898 {{oclc|776529627}}.\n* [[Arthur C.

The first was laid across the floor of the Atlantic from Telegraph Field, Foilhommerum Bay, [[Valentia Island]] in western [[Ireland]] to [[Heart's Content Cable Station|Heart's Content]] in eastern [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. The first communications occurred August 16, 1858, reducing the communication time between [[North America]] and [[Europe]] from ten days\u2014the time it took to deliver a message by ship\u2014to a matter of minutes. Transatlantic telegraph cables have been replaced by [[transatlantic telecommunications cable]]s.\n\n[[Cyrus West Field]] and the [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]] were behind the construction of the first transatlantic telegraph cable.<ref name=\"guarnieri 7-1\">{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2014|title=The Conquest of the Atlantic|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=8|issue=1|pages=53\u201356/67|doi=10.1109/MIE.2014.2299492|ref=harv}}</ref> The project began in 1854 and was completed in 1858. The cable functioned for only three weeks, but it was the first such project to yield practical results. The first official telegram to pass between two continents was a letter of congratulations from [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom]] to [[President of the United States]] [[James Buchanan]] on August 16. Signal quality declined rapidly, slowing transmission to an almost unusable speed. The cable was destroyed the following month when [[Wildman Whitehouse]] applied excessive voltage to it while trying to achieve faster operation. It has been argued that the faulty manufacture, storage and handling of the 1858 cable would have led to premature failure in any case.<ref>{{cite web|last1=de Cogan|first1=D.|title=Dr E.O.W.

A second attempt was undertaken in 1865 with much-improved material and, following some setbacks, a connection was completed and put into service on July 28, 1866. This cable proved more durable.\n\nBefore the first transatlantic cable, communications between Europe and the Americas took place only by ship. Sometimes, however, severe winter storms delayed ships for weeks. The transatlantic cable reduced communication time considerably, allowing a message and a response in the same day. Five attempts to lay a cable were made over a nine-year period \u2013 one in 1857, two in 1858, one in 1865, and one in 1866.  Lasting connections were finally achieved with the 1866 cable and the 1865 cable, which was repaired by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s ship {{SS|Great Eastern||6}}, captained by [[Sir James Anderson]].<ref>Wilson, Arthur (1994).

Morse]] proclaimed his faith in the idea of a submarine line across the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. By 1850 a cable was run between England and France. That same year Bishop [[John T. Mullock]], head of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], proposed a telegraph line through the forest from [[St. John's, Newfoundland|St. John's]] to [[Cape Ray]], and cables across the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] from Cape Ray to [[Nova Scotia]] across the [[Cabot Strait]].\n\nAt about the same time a similar plan occurred to [[Frederic Newton Gisborne]], a telegraph engineer in Nova Scotia. In the spring of 1851, Gisborne procured a grant from the legislature of Newfoundland and, having formed a company, began the construction of the landline. In 1853 his company collapsed, he was arrested for debt and he lost everything.\n\n== A plan takes shape ==\nIn 1854 Gisborne was introduced to [[Cyrus West Field]]. Field invited Gisborne to his house to discuss the project. From his visitor, Field considered the idea that the cable to Newfoundland might be extended across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nField was ignorant of submarine cables and the deep sea. He consulted Morse as well as Lieutenant [[Matthew Maury]], an authority on [[oceanography]].  The charts Maury constructed from [[depth sounding|soundings]] in the logs of multiple ships indicated that there was a feasible route across the Atlantic.  The area seemed so ideal for cable laying that Maury named it [[Telegraph Plateau]].  Maury's charts also predicted that a route going directly to the US was too rugged to be tenable, as well as being longer.<ref>Rozwadowski, p. 83</ref>  Field adopted Gisborne's scheme as a preliminary step to the bigger undertaking, and promoted the [[New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company]] to establish a telegraph line between America and Europe.\n\nThe first step was to finish the line between St. John's and Nova Scotia, which was undertaken by Gisborne and Fields brother, Matthew.<ref>Lindley, p. 128</ref>  In 1855 an attempt was made to lay a cable across the Cabot Strait in the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]]. It was laid out from a [[barque]] in tow of a steamer. When half the cable was laid, a [[gale]] rose, and the line was cut to keep the barque from sinking. In 1856 a [[steamboat]] was fitted out for the purpose, and the link from Cape Ray, Newfoundland to Aspy Bay, Nova Scotia was successfully laid.<ref name=\"HindKeefer1864\">{{cite book|author1=Henry Youle Hind|author2=Thomas C.

It was made jointly by two English firms \u2013 [[Enderby's Wharf|Glass, Elliot & Co.]], of [[Greenwich]], and [[R.S. Newall and Company]], of [[Birkenhead]]. Late in manufacturing it was discovered that the respective sections had been made with strands twisted in opposite directions.

Field also solicited aid from the U.S. government. A bill authorizing a subsidy was submitted in [[United States Congress|Congress]]. The subsidy bill passed the [[United States Senate|Senate]] by a single vote, due to opposition from protectionist senators. In the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], the bill encountered similar resistance, but passed, and was signed by President [[Franklin Pierce]].\n\nThe first attempt, in 1857, was a failure. The cable-laying vessels were the converted warships [[HMS Agamemnon (1852)|HMS ''Agamemnon'']] and [[USS Niagara (1855)|USS ''Niagara'']] borrowed from their respective governments.  Both ships were needed as neither was sufficient to hold 2,500 miles of cable alone.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>  The cable was started at the white strand near [[Ballycarbery Castle]] in [[County Kerry]], on the southwest coast of [[Ireland]], on August 5, 1857.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Books/1857Isaac/index.htm |title = History of the Atlantic Cable \u2013 Submarine Telegraphy \u2013 1857 \u2013 Laying the Atlantic Telegraph From Ship To Shore |accessdate = August 5, 2008}}</ref> The cable broke on the first day, but was [[Grappling hook|grappled]] and repaired; it broke again over the Telegraph Plateau, nearly 3,200&nbsp;m (2&nbsp;[[statute mile]]s) deep, and the operation was abandoned for the year.  300 miles of cable had been lost, but with 1,800 miles still remaining, the director's agreed to try again the following year.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>  Also in this period, Morse clashed with Field and takes no further part in the enterprise.<ref>Lindley, p. 134</ref>\n\nThe problems with cables breaking were largely due to difficulty controlling the tension of the cable with the braking mechanism as the cable was payed out.  A new mechanism was designed and successfully trialed in the [[Bay of Biscay]] with ''Agamemnon'' in May 1858.<ref>Lindley, pp. 130, 133</ref>  On 10 June, ''Agamemnon'' and ''Niagara'' set sail to try again.  Ten days out they found themselves in a severe storm and the enterprise was nearly brought to a premature end.  The ships were top heavy with cable that could not all fit in the hold and strugggled not to capsize.  Ten sailors were hurt and Thomson's electrical cabin was flooded.<ref>Lindley, p. 134</ref> The vessels were to meet in the middle of the Atlantic, where the two halves of the cable were to be [[wikt:splice|spliced]] together, and while ''Agamemnon'' paid out eastwards to Valentia Island, ''Niagara'' was to pay out westward to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. On June 26, the middle splice was made and the cable was dropped. Again the cable broke, the first time after less than 5.5&nbsp;km (three nautical miles), again after some 100&nbsp;km (54&nbsp;nautical miles) and for a third time when about 370&nbsp;km (200 nautical miles) of cable had run out of each vessel.\n\nThe expedition returned to [[Queenstown, County Cork]], Ireland, and set out again on July 17, with little enthusiasm among the crews. The middle splice was finished on July 29, 1858. The cable ran easily this time. ''Niagara'' arrived in [[Trinity Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Trinity Bay, Newfoundland]] on August 4 and the next morning the shore end was landed. ''Agamemnon'' made an equally successful run. On August 5, she arrived at Valentia Island, and the shore end was landed at Knightstown and then laid to the nearby cable house.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Article/1858Leslies/index.htm |title = History of the Atlantic Cable \u2013 Submarine Telegraphy \u2013 Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper 1858 Cable News |accessdate = August 5, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==First contact==\n[[File:Irl-ValentiaTelegraph.jpg|thumb|275px|right|The Telegraph Field,<ref name=tel-field>{{cite web|url=http://thetelegraphfield.com|title=\u30b6\u30c6\u30ec\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9|website=thetelegraphfield.com}}</ref> [[Valentia Island]], Ireland, the site of the earliest message sent from Ireland to North America.

Whitehouse was a medical doctor by training but had taken an enthusiastic interest in the new electrical technology and had given up his medical practice to follow a new career.  He had no formal training in physics; all his knowledge had been gained through practical experience.  The two clashed even before the project had started when Whitehouse disputed Thomson's [[law of squares]] when he presented it to a [[British Association]] meeting in 1855.  Thomson's law predicted that transmission speed on the cable would be very slow due to an effect called retardation.<ref>Lindley, p. 125</ref>  Whitehouse, with access to the Magnetic Telegraph Company's lines, was able to join several lines to a distance similar to the transatlantic route and declare that there would be no problem.<ref>Bright, pp. 25\u201326</ref>  Thomson believed that a larger cable was needed, which would improve the retardation problem predicted by the law of squares.  In mid-1857, Thomson, on his own initiative, examined samples of copper core of alleged identical specification and found variations in resistance up to a factor of two.  But the cable manufacturing was already underway and Whitehouse supported use of a thinner cable so Field went with the cheaper option.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>\n[[File:Edward-orange-wildman-whitehouse.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Wildman Whitehouse]]\nAnother point of contention was the itinerary for cable laying.  Thomson favoured starting mid-Atlantic and the two ships heading in opposite directions.  This would halve the time taken to complete.  Whitehouse wanted both ships to travel together from Ireland so that progress could be reported back to the base in Valentia through the cable.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>  Whitehouse overruled Thomson's suggestion on the 1857 voyage, but Bright convinced the directors to approve a mid-ocean start on the subsequent 1858 voyage.<ref>Lindley, p. 134</ref>  Whitehouse, as chief electrician, was supposed to be on board the cable laying vessel, but he declined to go at the last moment.  He repeatedly did this; for the 1857 attempt, the trials in the [[Bay of Biscay]],<ref>Lindley, p. 133</ref> and the attempt in 1858.<ref>Lindley, p. 134</ref>  In 1857, Thomson was sent in his place,<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref> and in 1858 Field diplomatically assigned the two to different ships to avoid conflict, but in the event Thomson went alone.<ref>Lindley, p. 134</ref>\n[[File:Thomsons mirror galvanometer, 1858. (9663806048).jpg|thumb|Thomson's mirror galvanometer]]\nAfter his experience on the 1857 voyage, Thomson realised that a better method of detecting the telegraph signal was required.  He spent the time waiting for a new voyage inventing his [[mirror galvanometer]].  This was an extremely sensitive instrument, much better than any existing equipment.  He requested \u00a32,000 from the board to build several of them, but was only given \u00a3500 for a prototype, and permission to trial it on the next voyage.<ref>Lindley, p. 133</ref>  The mirror galvanometer was extremely good at detecting the positive, or negative edge of a telegraph pulse respectively representing a Morse 'dash' and a Morse 'dot' (this was the standard system on submarine cables \u2013 both pulse types were the same length, unlike overland telegraph).  Thomson believed he could use this instrument with the low voltages from regular telegraph equipment even over the vast length of the Atlantic cable.  He successfully tested the instrument on 2,700 miles of cable in underwater storage at [[Plymouth]].<ref>Lindley, p. 133</ref>\n\nThe mirror galvanometer proved to be yet another point of contention.  Whitehouse wanted to work the cable with a very different scheme.<ref>Voice Across the Sea \u2013 Arthur C Clarke</ref>  He wanted to drive the line with a massive high-voltage [[induction coil]], producing several thousand volts, so that enough current was available to drive standard electromechanical [[printing telegraph]]s used on inland telegraphs.<ref>Lindley, p. 139</ref>  Thomson's instrument had to be read by hand.  It was not capable of printing, but much later he invented the [[syphon recorder]] for the second transatlantic attempt in 1866.<ref>Clayton, p. 73</ref>  The decision to start mid-Atlantic combined with Whitehouse dropping out of another voyage left Thomson, on board ''Agememnon'' sailing towards Ireland, with a free hand to use his equipment without Whitehouse's interference.  Although Thomson had the status of a mere advisor to engineer C. W. de Sauty, it was not long before all electrical decisions were deferred to him.  Whitehouse in Valentia remained out of contact until the ship reached Ireland and landed the cable.<ref>Lindley, pp. 133\u2013134</ref>\n\nAround this time, the board started to have doubts over Whitehouse's generally negative attitude.  Not only did he repeatedly clash with Thomson, but he was also critical of Field, and his repeated refusal to carry out his primary duty as chief electrician on board ship made a very bad impression.  But at this time no action was taken.<ref>Lindley, p. 133</ref>\n\nThe effects of the poor handling and design of the cable, coupled with Whitehouse's repeated attempts to drive the cable with high voltages, resulted in the insulation of the cable being compromised.  All the while, it was taking longer and longer to send messages.  Towards the end, sending half a page of message text was taking as long as a day.\n\nIn September 1858, after several days of progressive deterioration of the insulation, the cable failed. The reaction to this news was tremendous. Some writers even hinted that the line was a mere hoax, and others pronounced it a stock exchange speculation.  In the enquiry that followed, Dr Whitehouse was deemed responsible for the failure, and the company did not escape criticism for employing an electrical engineer with no recognised qualifications.\n\nAlthough the cable was never put into service for public use, and never worked well, there was time for a few messages to be passed that went beyond testing.  The collision between the [[Cunard Line]] ships ''Europa'' and ''Arabia'' was reported on 17 August. The British Government used the cable to countermand an order for two regiments in Canada to embark for England, saving \u00a350,000.  A total of 732 messages were passed before failure.<ref name=\"Kieve, p. 109\"/>\n\n== Preparing a new attempt ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2012|Just about all this section can be cited to the Kieve source I added}}\n\nField was undaunted by the failure. He was eager to renew the work, but the public had lost confidence in the scheme and his efforts to revive the company were futile. It was not until 1864 that, with the assistance of [[Thomas Brassey]] and [[John Pender]], he succeeded in raising the necessary capital. The Glass, Elliot, and Gutta-Percha Companies were united to form the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company (Telcon, later part of [[British Insulated Callender's Cables|BICC]]), which undertook to manufacture and lay the new cable. [[C.F. Varley]] replaced Whitehouse as chief electrician.<ref name=\"guarnieri 7-1\"/>\n\nIn the meantime, long cables had been submerged in the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Red Sea]]. With this experience, an improved cable was designed. The core consisted of seven twisted strands of very pure copper weighing 300 pounds per nautical mile (73&nbsp;kg/km), coated with [[Chatterton's compound]], then covered with four layers of [[gutta-percha]], alternating with four thin layers of the compound cementing the whole, and bringing the weight of the insulator to 400&nbsp;lb/nmi (98&nbsp;kg/km). This core was covered with [[hemp]] saturated in a preservative solution, and on the hemp were helically wound eighteen single strands of high tensile steel wire produced by [[Webster and Horsfall|Webster & Horsfall Ltd]] of Hay Mills [[Birmingham]], each covered with fine strands of [[manila hemp|manila]] yarn steeped in the preservative. The weight of the new cable was 35.75 long [[hundredweight]] (4000&nbsp;lb) per nautical mile (980&nbsp;kg/km), or nearly twice the weight of the old. The Haymills site successfully manufactured {{convert|30,000|mi|km}} of wire (1,600 tons), made by 250 workers over eleven months.\n\n== ''Great Eastern'' and the second attempt ==\n[[File:Great Eastern 1866.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Great Eastern'' at [[Heart's Content, Newfoundland and Labrador|Heart's Content]]]]\nThe new cable was laid by the ship [[SS Great Eastern|''Great Eastern'']] captained by [[Sir James Anderson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Cableships/GreatEastern/|title=History of the Atlantic Cable & Submarine Telegraphy - Great Eastern|website=www.atlantic-cable.com}}</ref> Her immense hull was fitted with three iron tanks for the reception of {{convert|2,300|nmi|km}} of cable, and her decks furnished with the paying-out gear. At noon on July 15, 1865, ''Great Eastern'' left the [[Nore]] for Foilhommerum Bay, Valentia Island, where the shore end was laid by ''Caroline''. This attempt failed on July 31 when, after 1,062&nbsp;miles (1968&nbsp;km) had been paid out, the cable snapped near the stern of the ship, and the end was lost.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/Gooch/index.html |title = History of the Atlantic Cable \u2013 Submarine Telegraphy \u2013 Daniel Gooch |accessdate = August 5, 2008}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|1866}}<!--[[1866 transatlantic telegraph cable]] redirects here -->\n''Great Eastern'' steamed back to England, where Field issued another prospectus, and formed the [[Anglo-American Telegraph Company]],<ref>http://atlantic-cable.com/CableCos/AngloAmerican/index.htm Anglo-American Telegraph Company</ref> to lay a new cable and complete the broken one. On July 13, 1866, ''Great Eastern'' started paying out once more. Despite problems with the weather on the evening of Friday, July 27, the expedition reached the port of Heart's Content in a thick fog. The next morning at 9&nbsp;a.m. a message from England cited these words from the [[editorial|leader]] in ''[[The Times]]'': \"It is a great work, a glory to our age and nation, and the men who have achieved it deserve to be honoured among the benefactors of their race.\" \"Treaty of peace signed between Prussia and Austria.\" The shore end was landed during the day by ''Medway''. Congratulations poured in, and friendly telegrams were again exchanged between Queen Victoria and the United States.\n\n[[File:Great Eastern Grappling Hook.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[Grappling hook]] used for lifting the cable]]\nIn August 1866, several ships, including ''Great Eastern'', put to sea again in order to grapple the lost cable of 1865. Their goal was to find the end of the lost cable, splice it to new cable, and complete the run to Newfoundland.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/1866Recovery/index.htm |title = History of the Atlantic Cable \u2013 Submarine Telegraphy-Recovery of the Lost Cable |accessdate = August 5, 2008}}</ref>   They were determined to find it, and their search was based solely upon positions recorded \"principally by Captain Moriarty, R.N.\" who placed the end of the lost cable at longitude 38\u00b0 50' W.<ref>Bright, Edward B., \"[http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/1866Bright/index.htm Description of the Manufacture, Laying and Working of the Cables of 1865 and 1866...],\" History of the Atlantic Cable & Undersea Communications, Retrieved April 18, 2019.</ref>\n\nThere were some who thought it hopeless to try, declaring that to locate a cable {{cvt|2.5|mi|||}} down would be like looking for a small needle in a large haystack. However, [[Robert Halpin]] navigated HMS ''Terrible'' and grappling ship ''Albany'' to the correct location.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Laying the French Atlantic Cable|journal=Nautical Magazine|year=1869|volume=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7o4EAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA460|accessdate=September 10, 2011|page=460|publisher=Brown, Son and Ferguson|quote=To have navigated the ship in a fog so exactly to her proper position was certainly a most wonderful testimony to Captain Halpin's judgment and skill, ...}}</ref>  ''Albany'' moved slowly here and there, \"fishing\" for the lost cable with a five-pronged [[grappling hook]] at the end of a stout rope. Suddenly, on August 10, ''Albany'' \"caught\" the cable and brought it to the surface. It seemed to be an unrealistically easy success, and that is how it turned out. During the night, the cable slipped from the buoy to which it had been secured and the process had to start all over again. This happened several more times, with the cable slipping after being secured in a frustrating battle against rough seas. One time, a sailor even was flung across the deck when the grapnel rope snapped and recoiled around him. ''Great Eastern'' and another grappling ship, ''Medway'', arrived to join the search on the 12th. It was not until over a fortnight later, in early September 1866, that the cable was finally retrieved so that it could be worked on; it took 26 hours to get it safely on board ''Great Eastern''. The cable was carried to the electrician's room, where it was determined that the cable was connected. All on the ship cheered or wept as rockets were sent up into the sky to light the sea. The recovered cable was then spliced to a fresh cable in her hold, and paid out to [[Heart's Content, Newfoundland and Labrador|Heart's Content, Newfoundland]], where she arrived on Saturday, September 7. There were now two working telegraph lines.\n\n== Repairing the cable ==\nBroken cables required an elaborate repair procedure. The approximate distance to the break is determined by measuring the resistance of the broken cable. The repair ship navigated to the location. The cable was hooked with a grapple and brought on board to test for electrical continuity. Buoys were deployed to mark the ends of good cable and a splice was made between the two ends.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UoxAwrVzc88C&pg=PA515&lpg=PA515&dq=transatlantic+cable+buoy&source=bl&ots=vM5O99xNRP&sig=3J7hvgSPZ2usC7pZwgw3-ZfJgo0&hl=en&ei=ugXKTcmWC-jkiAKmoaWjBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CCwQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=transatlantic+cable+buoy&f=false|title=The Encyclopaedia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information|first=Hugh|last=Chisholm|date=March 18, 2018|publisher=Encyclopaedia britannica Company|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/1915CCC/index.htm|title=History of the Atlantic Cable & Submarine Telegraphy - 1915: How submarine cables are made and laid|website=atlantic-cable.com}}</ref>\n\n==Communication speeds==\nInitially messages were sent by an operator sending [[Morse code]].

[[Oliver Heaviside|Heaviside]] and [[Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin]] in later decades understood that the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of a cable is hindered by an imbalance between capacitive and inductive [[reactance (electronics)|reactance]], which causes a severe [[dispersion relation|dispersion]] and hence a signal distortion; see [[Telegrapher's equations]]. This has to be solved by iron tape or by [[load coil]]s. It was not until the 20th century that message transmission speeds over transatlantic cables would reach even 120 words per minute. Despite this, London had become the world center in telecommunications. Eventually, no fewer than eleven cables radiated from [[Porthcurno]] Cable Station near [[Land's End]] and formed with their Commonwealth links a \"live\" girdle around the world; the [[All Red Line]].\n\n== Later cables ==\nAdditional cables were laid between Foilhommerum and Heart's Content in 1873, 1874, 1880, and 1894. By the end of the 19th century, British-, French-, German-, and American-owned cables linked Europe and North America in a sophisticated web of telegraphic communications.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016|reason=Need a citation for both sentences here.}}\n\nThe original cables were not fitted with [[repeater]]s, which potentially could completely solve the retardation problem and consequently speed up operation.  Repeaters amplify the signal periodically along the line.  On telegraph lines this is done with [[relay]]s, but there was no practical way to power them in a submarine cable. The first transatlantic cable with repeaters was [[TAT-1]] in 1956.  This was a telephone cable and used a different technology for its repeaters.\n\n==Impact==\nA 2018 study in the ''[[The American Economic Review|American Economic Review]]'' found that the transatlantic telegraph substantially increased trade over the Atlantic and reduced prices.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Steinwender|first=Claudia|date=2018|title=Real Effects of Information Frictions: When the States and the Kingdom Became United|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20150681|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=108|issue=3|pages=657\u2013696|doi=10.1257/aer.20150681|issn=0002-8282|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref> The study estimates that \"the efficiency gains of the telegraph to be equivalent to 8 percent of export value\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Robert Halpin]] \u2013 Captain of ''Great Eastern''\n* [[Transatlantic telephone cable]]\n* [[Western Union Telegraph Expedition]] \u2013 overland alternative via Russia\n* [[1929 Grand Banks earthquake]]\n* [[Commercial Cable Company]]\n* [[Enderby's Wharf]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References and further reading ==\n* [[Charles Tilston Bright|Bright, Charles Tilston]], [https://archive.org/details/cihm_00867/page/n3 ''Submarine Telegraphs''], London: Crosby Lockwood, 1898 {{oclc|776529627}}.\n* [[Arthur C.

It was preceded by a popular [[revolt]] against the Argentine government, rallying behind the motto \"All of them must go!\" ({{Lang-es|\u00a1Que se vayan todos!}}), which caused the [[resignation]] of then-president [[Fernando de la R\u00faa]], giving way to a period of political instability during which five government officials performed the duties of the [[President of Argentina|Argentinian presidency]]. This period of instability occurred during the larger period of crisis known as the [[1998\u20132002 Argentine great depression|Argentine great depression]], an economic, political, and social crisis that lasted from 1998 until 1567.\n\nThe December 2001 crisis was a direct response to the government's imposition of \"Corral\" policies ({{Lang-es|[[Corralito]]}}) at the behest of economic minister [[Domingo Cavallo]], which restricted people's ability to withdraw [[cash]] from banks. Rioting and protests became widespread on 19 December 2001, immediately following the president's declaration of a state of emergency and his resignation on the following day. A state of extreme institutional instability continued for the next twelve days, during which the successor president [[Adolfo Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1]] resigned as well. While the degree of instability subsided, the events of December 2001 would become a blow against the legitimacy of the [[Argentine government]] that would persist for the following years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe majority of the participants in the protests were unaffiliated with any political party or organization. Over the course of the protests, 39 people were killed by [[police]] and security forces. Of the 39 killed, nine were [[Minor (law)|minors]], which is an indication of the degree of repression ordered by the government to oppose the protests.\n\n== Background ==\n{{History of Argentina}}\n\n=== The Argentinian economy ===\n{{Main article|1998\u20132002 Argentine great depression}}[[Fernando de la R\u00faa]], as the candidate for the [[Alliance for Work, Justice and Education]] , had assumed the role of president in December 1999 in the middle of a recession, which was caused in part by the [[Convertibility plan]] ({{Lang-es|Ley de Convertibilidad}}) passed in 1991 which pegged the value of the [[Argentine peso]] to the [[United States dollar]].\n\nWhile political reforms under the previous president [[Carlos Menem]] had succeeded in reducing [[inflation]], the downsides of his economic policies became more and more apparent starting in 1997.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Maintaining the convertibility of pesos to dollars required the government of Argentina to obtain an abundant supply of American dollars. At first, this supply was maintained by the [[privatization]] of nearly all of the Argentinian [[State (polity)|state's]] industries and [[pension]] funds. As the privatization process was completed, Argentina's [[agriculture]] [[export]]-based economy was unable to maintain a sufficient flow of dollars to the state, and the system began to require more and more [[sovereign debt]].\n\n=== Fernando de la R\u00faa's presidency ===\nOne of the key factors leading to the victory of the ''Alliance'' in the 1999 elections was its promise to uphold the convertibility plan. One of de la R\u00faa's campaign slogans declared \"With me, one peso, one dollar\" ({{Lang-es|Conmigo, un peso, un d\u00f3lar}}). Despite a changing international economic situation (including economic downturns in [[Brazil]], one of Argentina's key economic partners), and mounting demands for increased [[monetary sovereignty]],{{By whom|date=April 2018}} the ''Alliance'' committed itself to maintain the status quo at all costs.\n\n==== October 2000 Crisis ====\nDe la R\u00faa's political situation was precarious. His arrival to power in 1999 had been possible thanks to the [[Alliance for Work, Justice and Education]]  ({{Lang-es|Alianza para el Trabajo, la Justicia y la Educaci\u00f3n}}), a coalition formed by the [[Radical Civic Union]] and the [[Front for a Country in Solidarity|FrePaSo]], which managed to defeat the incumbent [[Justicialist Party]] (the [[Peronism|Peronist]] party) in that year's presidential elections. However, the Alliance (as it was known) failed to achieve a majority in the [[Argentine Senate|Senate]] and the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]], and lost the provincial elections to the Peronists, who then remained in charge of large and critical districts such as the [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], [[C\u00f3rdoba Province (Argentina)|C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] provinces.\n\nThe government coalition was strained from the first moment; the FrePaSo leaders resented being \"junior members\" of the government (being forced to that position after losing their bid to the Governorship of Buenos Aires), while the Radicals were divided between their left- and right-leaning factions (De la R\u00faa was a leader of the party's conservatives), especially regarding economic policy. In late 2000 a [[political scandal]] broke out when it was reported that [[Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia|SIDE]], Argentina's [[intelligence service]], had paid massive [[bribe]]s to a number of senators to approve a controversial Labor Reform Act. The head of SIDE, Fernando de Santiba\u00f1es, was a personal friend of De la R\u00faa. The crisis came to a head on October 2000 when Vice President [[Carlos \u00c1lvarez (vice-president)|Carlos \u00c1lvarez]] resigned, citing De la R\u00faa's unwillingness to tackle corruption.\n\n==== March 2001 Crisis ====\nDe la R\u00faa's economic policies suffered a severe blow in March 2001 when Economy Minister [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Machinea]] resigned from office. He was briefly replaced by the then-Defense Minister [[Ricardo L\u00f3pez Murphy]], who himself was forced to resign following negative reception to his shock program. After only two weeks in office, L\u00f3pez Murphy was replaced by [[Domingo Cavallo]], who had previously served as Economy Minister between 1991 and 1996, and who was the original author of the Convertibility plan during Menem's presidency.\n\nBecause of the worsening economic situation and mounting foreign debt, the government enacted two enormous campaigns of debt-expansion and [[refinancing]] under the supervision of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), named \"The armoring\" ({{Lang-es|El blindaje}}) and \"The [[Megacanje|Megaexchange]]\"  ({{Lang-es|El Megacanje}}) respectively. From the first moment, there were allegations of corruption and [[money laundering]] about the ''megacanje''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe crisis also caused the resignation of all the FrePaSo Cabinet ministers, leaving de la R\u00faa without political support. The [[Elections in Argentina, 2001|congressional elections of October 2001]] were a disaster for the government, which lost many of its seats in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies to the Peronists. The election results marked also a growing unrest within Argentina's voters, who took to cast millions of null or blank votes. The Peronists seized the opportunity to appoint Senator [[Ram\u00f3n Puerta]] to be President Pro-Tempore of the Argentine Senate, a situation which added to De la R\u00faa's political weakness since in the Argentine system the President Pro-Tempore of the Senate is next in line for the Presidency after the Vice President. With no Vice President of its own, Puerta's designation meant that De la R\u00faa had a virtual Peronist Vice President.\n\nSocial unrest was also growing. Since the late 1990s, protest movements had formed in Argentina, notably the [[piquetero]]s (\"picketeers\"), initially made up of unemployed workers. The piqueteros [[blockade]]d major roads and highways demanding government subsidies and other [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] measures. They featured prominently during the March 2001 crisis.\n\nThe crisis reached a breaking point on 29 November 2001, as major [[investor]]s began to withdraw their deposits from the banks, summarily causing the collapse of the Argentinian banking system due to [[capital flight]]. This was compounded by the IMF's decision to refuse to refinance Argentina's debt.\n\n=== Corralito ===\n{{main article|Corralito}}\nAt the beginning of December 2001, the IMF cut off the flow of funds to Argentina and capital flight became uncontrollable, with 25% of all the money in Argentinian banks having been withdrawn since the beginning of 2001. On 2 December, Finance Minister Cavallo announced a national cash-withdrawal limit of $250/week. Popular opinion was very negative, especially amongst the [[middle class]] (bearing in mind that the weekly withdrawal limit was higher than the total savings of the majority of the Argentinian population), for whom the economic crisis caused a breach of political confidence. Protests were held throughout December, although the largest and most important protests were those held on 19 and 20 December.\n\nAlthough people could still use their money via [[credit card]]s, [[cheque|check]]s and other forms of non-cash payments, the enforcement of these measures caused delays and problems for the general population and especially for businesses. Massive queues at every bank and growing reports of political crisis contributed to inflame Argentina's political scenario.\n\nDe la R\u00faa's position had become unsustainable, and an attempt by the [[Catholic Church]] to mediate between the government and the opposition in mid-December failed. Between 16 and 19 December there were several incidents involving unemployed activists and protesters which demanded the handing-out of food bags from supermarkets. These incidents ended up with outright looting of [[supermarket]]s and [[convenience store]]s on 18 December, taking place on [[Rosario]] and the [[Greater Buenos Aires]] areas.\n\n=== General strike and looting ===\nOn 13 December, the [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|General Confederation of Labour]] and the [[Argentine Workers' Central Union]] declared their seventh [[general strike]] against the policies of de la R\u00faa's government. The strike had a high participation rate, including strikes in sectors that rarely participated in general strikes, such as the [[financial sector]] and un-[[unionized]] workplaces.\n\nDuring the time of the strike, there were riots in the [[working class]] neighborhoods of some cities, largely instigated by the striking ''piqueteros''. Looting occurred in various commercial districts in the country's interior and in [[Buenos Aires]]. Thousands of people participated in looting, truck-robbery, and street-blocking. From 13 to 19 December, seven people were killed by security forces and shopowners.\n\n== 19 December ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2007}}\n[[File:De.la.rua.ogv|thumb|250px|right|19 December 2001, [[President of Argentina|President]] [[Fernando de la R\u00faa|De la R\u00faa]] declares the [[state of emergency|state of siege]] throughout the country. Following the broadcast, a strong \"[[cacerolazo]]\" took place in Buenos Aires and other major cities of Argentina, and thousands took the streets and main plazas in protest. (video in Spanish)]]\n\nThroughout the day new lootings took place, and the Government believed that Peronist agitators were fueling the protests, especially in the province of [[Province of Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires]]. This came after noting that the lootings often took place in Peronist-governed towns, and that the [[Buenos Aires Provincial Police]] (which ultimately answered to Buenos Aires Governor [[Carlos Ruckauf]], a top Peronist) was strangely mild in restoring order. With violence mounting across Argentina's major cities, President De la R\u00faa began to consider alternative measures to restore order.\n\nThe first option considered was to deploy the military to contain the violence. However, Argentine legislation forbids military intervention in domestic security matters unless the police and security forces are overwhelmed, a situation quickly pointed out by the Chairman of the Joint General Staff and the Chiefs of Staff of the [[Argentine Army|Army]], [[Argentine Navy|Navy]] and [[Argentine Air Force|Air Force]]. The military also pointed out that they would only intervene if their deployment was authorized by a law voted in Congress, something impossible given the Peronist majority in both Houses. The Argentine military was unwilling to take the blame if violence grew worse, learning from what had previously happened when President [[Isabel Per\u00f3n]] issued an [[Operativo_Independencia#February_1975_\"annihilation_decree\"|executive order commanding them to fight the subversive guerrilla]] movements of the 1970s (see [[Dirty War]]).\n\nWith military intervention no longer an option, De la R\u00faa resorted to declare a [[state of siege]] (essentially a [[state of emergency]]) throughout the country, deploying the [[Polic\u00eda Federal Argentina|Federal Police]], the [[Gendarmer\u00eda Nacional Argentina|National Gendarmerie]] (border guard) and the [[Prefectura Naval Argentina|Naval Prefecture]] (coast guard) to contain the growing violence.\n\nLater that night, De la R\u00faa addressed the nation to announce the state of siege and to call the Peronists to negotiate a \"government of national unity\". Following the broadcast, spontaneous ''[[cacerolazo]]s'' (\"pot banging\") took place throughout Buenos Aires and other major cities, signaling the middle-class' own unrest. 19 December concluded with the resignation of Domingo Cavallo, who had lost whatever support he had within the government. Groups of protesters mobilized throughout Buenos Aires, some of them arriving to [[Plaza de Mayo]], where there were incidents with the Federal Police forces.\n\n== 20 December ==\n[[File:Crisis 20 diciembre 2001.jpg|thumb|Police intervention in the conflict]]\n\nWhat had begun as rioting by unemployed and leftist-leaning groups had turned into a middle-class protest with the ''cacerolazos'', and the resignation of Cavallo did nothing to calm down the situation.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1721201.stm Crisis grips Argentina] [[BBC News]], 20 December 2001</ref> The De la R\u00faa administration had agreed with the military to participate in an emergency handing-out of food, however, the plan failed due to lack of cooperation from the Ministry of Social Development.\n\nThroughout the morning, groups of protesters converged on Plaza de Mayo despite the state of siege.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1720607.stm Argentina plunges into turmoil] BBC News, 20 December 2001</ref> The [[Argentine Federal Police|Federal Police]], acting under orders from the government, proceeded to try to control the protests. An attempt by a federal judge to halt police operations was disregarded, and the situation worsened with the arrival of new groups of protesters.\n\nAs violence expanded, President De la R\u00faa tried to impose censorship on all news outlets from Buenos Aires. The idea was to use the state of siege to force the television networks to stop transmitting current events and broadcast emergency programming. This plan also failed because De la R\u00faa's own Media Secretary refused to carry out his instructions. The state's repression was thus broadcast both within Argentina and abroad, causing further mobilizations toward the Plaza.\n\nViolent incidents between the police and protesters spread throughout the country. The most notorious ones took place at the Plaza de Mayo, where five people were killed. Some claim that the deaths were provoked by covert elements of the [[Buenos Aires Provincial Police]] in an attempt to further destabilize De la R\u00faa.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nWith his options steadily being reduced, De la R\u00faa went onto national television at 4 p.m. to offer the Peronists to join the government and try to bring some peace to the country. At that time, a caucus of Peronist governors was taking place at a country villa in the province of [[San Luis Province|San Luis]]. Three hours later, Humberto Roggero, head of the Peronist bloc of the House of Deputies, announced that the Peronist Party would not be a part of a \"government of national unity\".\n\nWhen he heard the Peronists' response, De la R\u00faa decided to resign from office.<ref>[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A12FC355A0C728EDDAB0994D9404482 \"Argentine Leader, his Nation frayed, abruptly resigns\"]  by Clifford Krauss. ''[[The New York Times]]'', 21 December 2001</ref> The situation on Plaza de Mayo (right in front of the [[Casa Rosada]], the Presidential Palace) was still too violent for De la R\u00faa to leave by car to his official residence at Olivos. Thus, the President's security detail decided to take him out of the Casa Rosada on board an Air Force helicopter. The iconic{{cn|date=October 2019}} images of De la R\u00faa's \"escape\" by helicopter were broadcast throughout the country.\nThe violence slowly abated. By the end of the day, 26 people had died, five of them in Buenos Aires. \n\nWith \u00c1lvarez having resigned a year earlier, the President Pro-Tempore of the Senate, [[Ram\u00f3n Puerta]], took over as Interim President until Congress could appoint a successor to De la R\u00faa.\n\n=== Victims and criminal investigation ===\n{{See also|Pocho Lepratti}}\nAll told, 36 people were killed by police forces during the December riots, including 7 children. The largest incidence of violence was in the Plaza de Mayo of Buenos Aires, in what would become known in Argentina as the \"Plaza de Mayo Massacre\" ({{Lang-es|Masacre de Plaza de Mayo}}), where 5 people were killed and 227 were injured. These crimes were investigated and brought to court. Seventeen people were charged with murder, attempted murder, including the then-Secretary of Security Enrique Mathov and the former head of the Argentinian Federal Police, Ruben Santos.\n\nWhile various officials and police officers have been charged and sentenced to prison, as of 2016 the majority of cases pertaining to violence during the December riots have not moved forward.\n\n== Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 Administration ==\n[[File:Adolfo Rodr\u00edguez Saa.JPG|thumb|[[Adolfo Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1]] at his office in the ''[[Casa Rosada]]'']]\nAccording to the Acephaly Act, Puerta would only be President until the Legislative Assembly (a joint session of the Senate and the House of Deputies) convened and appointed a new President from either one member of Congress or a provincial governor to complete the resigning President's period.\n\nThe Peronist governors assembled at San Luis -arguably the most powerful men in Argentina at the period- were divided on whom to nominate. There were three \"natural candidates\", who were the governors of the three largest provinces: [[Carlos Ruckauf]] of Buenos Aires, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel de la Sota]] of [[C\u00f3rdoba Province (Argentina)|C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Carlos Reutemann]] of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]]. As a temporary arrangement, the governors decided to nominate [[Adolfo Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1]], Governor of San Luis. The Peronists' easy majority in both houses of Congress ensured that Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 was elected on 22 December.\n\nWhile de la R\u00faa's term expired in 2003, some argued that only a president legitimated by popular vote would be able to bring Argentina out of the crisis. To that end, Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 was designated as interim president for only three months, until presidential elections were held on 3 March. If needed, a [[ballotage in Argentina|ballotage]] would be held on 17 March. The winner would take office on 5 April for the balance of de la R\u00faa's term. \n\nHowever, Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 didn't seem at all satisfied with being a caretaker president. From the first moment, Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 embarked on ambitious projects aimed at giving him popularity. In his inaugural speech, he announced that Argentina would [[default (finance)|default]] on its foreign debt, an announcement received by rousing applause from the members of Congress. He then proceeded to announce the issuing of a \"third currency\" (alongside the peso and the dollar) to boost consumption. Later on, Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 announced that he would extradite every former military officer charged with human rights abuses during the Dirty War who was requested by foreign courts. Another measure was to stand down the state of siege.\n\nThere were also some unpopular designations to the Cabinet. The most notorious one was the appointment of former Mayor of Buenos Aires [[Carlos Grosso]], arguably one of the most corrupt figures in Argentine politics. Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 also courted the powerful Peronist [[trade unions]] in a move that was recognized as an attempt to wrestle power from the other Peronist governors.\n\nNew riots and ''cacerolazos'' took place on Buenos Aires, with some protesters entering the Congress Palace and burning furniture. On 30 December, Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 called for a summit of Peronist governors at the Presidential holiday retreat of Chapadmalal, {{convert|19|km|abbr=off}} south of [[Mar del Plata]]. Of the fourteen Peronist governors, only five attended. Realizing that he lacked support from his own party, Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 returned to his home province to announce his own resignation to the Presidency after barely a week in office.\n\n== Designation of Eduardo Duhalde ==\n[[Image:Duhalde.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Former President Eduardo Duhalde (2002\u20132003)]]\nRam\u00f3n Puerta refused to take over as interim President again, resigning as President Pro-Tempore of the Senate. With no President, Vice President or President Pro-Tempore of the Senate, the Presidency of Argentina was placed in the hands of the next-in-line: [[Eduardo Cama\u00f1o]], who was the Speaker of the House of Deputies.\n\nCama\u00f1o was to take over until a new Legislative Assembly was convened. The Assembly convened on 1 January 2002, and debated extensively before designating Senator [[Eduardo Duhalde]] as President almost at midnight.\n\nDuhalde was one of the top leaders of the Peronist Party. However, many had thought that Duhalde's political career was ruined after his defeat in the [[Elections in Argentina, 1999|1999 presidential elections]]. In an ironic twist of events, Duhalde was called to complete the term of the man who beat him in the elections, Fernando de la R\u00faa. This was not to be a provisional presidency, as Duhalde was designated to complete the interrupted term of De la R\u00faa until the [[Elections in Argentina, 2003|2003 presidential elections]].\n\nWith regard to the economy Duhalde and his Economy Minister [[Jorge Remes Lenicov]] decided on an even more extreme freezing of the bank deposits, which was then coupled with the so-called ''pesificaci\u00f3n'' (\"peso-ification\", a forced transformation of all dollar-denominated accounts into pesos at an arbitrary fixed [[exchange rate]]), and a regulated [[devaluation]]. The fixed exchange rate system was abandoned soon afterwards, which was followed by a large [[depreciation (currency)|depreciation]].\n\n== Social changes ==\nDuring the unrest millions of people formed [[Participatory democracy|neighbourhood assemblies]], occupied unused land and factories, created [[barter]] and [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]] networks, implemented workers' self-management across hundreds of factories and rejected trade unionism and political parties.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Que Se Vayan Todos: Argentina's Popular Rebellion|last=Whitney|first=Jennifer|publisher=Kersplebedeb|year=2003|isbn=|location=Montreal|pages=56}}</ref> Around a third of the population participated in these creations and these efforts have been repeatedly praised by [[Anarchism|anarchists]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anarchy Works|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[1989 riots in Argentina]]\n* [[List of cases of police brutality in Argentina]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources and further reading ==\n* {{cite book \n|last= Reato\n|first= Ceferino\n|date= 2015\n|title= Doce noches\n|trans-title= Twelve nights\n|language= Spanish\n|location= Argentina\n|publisher= Sudamericana\n|isbn= 978-950-07-5203-9}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/americas/12/19/argentina.riots/ |title=Argentina in state of siege after deadly riots |publisher=CNN.com |date=20 December 2001}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/americas/12/20/argentina/index.html |title=Argentina teeters on possible economic collapse |publisher=CNN.com |date=21 December 2001 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024022128/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/americas/12/20/argentina/index.html |archivedate=24 October 2007 }}\n* {{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1721103.stm |title=The events that triggered Argentina's crisis |publisher=BBC News -

It was preceded by a popular [[revolt]] against the Argentine government, rallying behind the motto \"All of them must go!\" ({{Lang-es|\u00a1Que se vayan todos!}}), which caused the [[resignation]] of then-president [[Fernando de la R\u00faa]], giving way to a period of political instability during which five government officials performed the duties of the [[President of Argentina|Argentinian presidency]]. This period of instability occurred during the larger period of crisis known as the [[1998\u20132002 Argentine great depression|Argentine great depression]], an economic, political, and social crisis that lasted from 1998 until 2002.\n\nThe December 2001 crisis was a direct response to the government's imposition of \"Corral\" policies ({{Lang-es|[[Corralito]]}}) at the behest of economic minister [[Domingo Cavallo]], which restricted people's ability to withdraw [[cash]] from banks. Rioting and protests became widespread on 19 December 2001, immediately following the president's declaration of a state of emergency and his resignation on the following day. A state of extreme institutional instability continued for the next twelve days, during which the successor president [[Adolfo Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1]] resigned as well. While the degree of instability subsided, the events of December 2001 would become a blow against the legitimacy of the [[Argentine government]] that would persist for the following years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe majority of the participants in the protests were unaffiliated with any political party or organization. Over the course of the protests, 39 people were killed by [[police]] and security forces. Of the 39 killed, nine were [[Minor (law)|minors]], which is an indication of the degree of repression ordered by the government to oppose the protests.\n\n== Background ==\n{{History of Argentina}}\n\n=== The Argentinian economy ===\n{{Main article|1998\u20132002 Argentine great depression}}[[Fernando de la R\u00faa]], as the candidate for the [[Alliance for Work, Justice and Education]] , had assumed the role of president in December 1999 in the middle of a recession, which was caused in part by the [[Convertibility plan]] ({{Lang-es|Ley de Convertibilidad}}) passed in 1991 which pegged the value of the [[Argentine peso]] to the [[United States dollar]].\n\nWhile political reforms under the previous president [[Carlos Menem]] had succeeded in reducing [[inflation]], the downsides of his economic policies became more and more apparent starting in 1997.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Maintaining the convertibility of pesos to dollars required the government of Argentina to obtain an abundant supply of American dollars. At first, this supply was maintained by the [[privatization]] of nearly all of the Argentinian [[State (polity)|state's]] industries and [[pension]] funds. As the privatization process was completed, Argentina's [[agriculture]] [[export]]-based economy was unable to maintain a sufficient flow of dollars to the state, and the system began to require more and more [[sovereign debt]].\n\n=== Fernando de la R\u00faa's presidency ===\nOne of the key factors leading to the victory of the ''Alliance'' in the 1999 elections was its promise to uphold the convertibility plan. One of de la R\u00faa's campaign slogans declared \"With me, one peso, one dollar\" ({{Lang-es|Conmigo, un peso, un d\u00f3lar}}). Despite a changing international economic situation (including economic downturns in [[Brazil]], one of Argentina's key economic partners), and mounting demands for increased [[monetary sovereignty]],{{By whom|date=April 2018}} the ''Alliance'' committed itself to maintain the status quo at all costs.\n\n==== October 2000 Crisis ====\nDe la R\u00faa's political situation was precarious. His arrival to power in 1999 had been possible thanks to the [[Alliance for Work, Justice and Education]]  ({{Lang-es|Alianza para el Trabajo, la Justicia y la Educaci\u00f3n}}), a coalition formed by the [[Radical Civic Union]] and the [[Front for a Country in Solidarity|FrePaSo]], which managed to defeat the incumbent [[Justicialist Party]] (the [[Peronism|Peronist]] party) in that year's presidential elections. However, the Alliance (as it was known) failed to achieve a majority in the [[Argentine Senate|Senate]] and the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]], and lost the provincial elections to the Peronists, who then remained in charge of large and critical districts such as the [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]], [[C\u00f3rdoba Province (Argentina)|C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] provinces.\n\nThe government coalition was strained from the first moment; the FrePaSo leaders resented being \"junior members\" of the government (being forced to that position after losing their bid to the Governorship of Buenos Aires), while the Radicals were divided between their left- and right-leaning factions (De la R\u00faa was a leader of the party's conservatives), especially regarding economic policy. In late 2000 a [[political scandal]] broke out when it was reported that [[Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia|SIDE]], Argentina's [[intelligence service]], had paid massive [[bribe]]s to a number of senators to approve a controversial Labor Reform Act. The head of SIDE, Fernando de Santiba\u00f1es, was a personal friend of De la R\u00faa. The crisis came to a head on October 2000 when Vice President [[Carlos \u00c1lvarez (vice-president)|Carlos \u00c1lvarez]] resigned, citing De la R\u00faa's unwillingness to tackle corruption.\n\n==== March 2001 Crisis ====\nDe la R\u00faa's economic policies suffered a severe blow in March 2001 when Economy Minister [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Machinea]] resigned from office. He was briefly replaced by the then-Defense Minister [[Ricardo L\u00f3pez Murphy]], who himself was forced to resign following negative reception to his shock program. After only two weeks in office, L\u00f3pez Murphy was replaced by [[Domingo Cavallo]], who had previously served as Economy Minister between 1991 and 1996, and who was the original author of the Convertibility plan during Menem's presidency.\n\nBecause of the worsening economic situation and mounting foreign debt, the government enacted two enormous campaigns of debt-expansion and [[refinancing]] under the supervision of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), named \"The armoring\" ({{Lang-es|El blindaje}}) and \"The [[Megacanje|Megaexchange]]\"  ({{Lang-es|El Megacanje}}) respectively. From the first moment, there were allegations of corruption and [[money laundering]] about the ''megacanje''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe crisis also caused the resignation of all the FrePaSo Cabinet ministers, leaving de la R\u00faa without political support. The [[Elections in Argentina, 2001|congressional elections of October 2001]] were a disaster for the government, which lost many of its seats in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies to the Peronists. The election results marked also a growing unrest within Argentina's voters, who took to cast millions of null or blank votes. The Peronists seized the opportunity to appoint Senator [[Ram\u00f3n Puerta]] to be President Pro-Tempore of the Argentine Senate, a situation which added to De la R\u00faa's political weakness since in the Argentine system the President Pro-Tempore of the Senate is next in line for the Presidency after the Vice President. With no Vice President of its own, Puerta's designation meant that De la R\u00faa had a virtual Peronist Vice President.\n\nSocial unrest was also growing. Since the late 1990s, protest movements had formed in Argentina, notably the [[piquetero]]s (\"picketeers\"), initially made up of unemployed workers. The piqueteros [[blockade]]d major roads and highways demanding government subsidies and other [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] measures. They featured prominently during the March 2001 crisis.\n\nThe crisis reached a breaking point on 29 November 2001, as major [[investor]]s began to withdraw their deposits from the banks, summarily causing the collapse of the Argentinian banking system due to [[capital flight]]. This was compounded by the IMF's decision to refuse to refinance Argentina's debt.\n\n=== Corralito ===\n{{main article|Corralito}}\nAt the beginning of December 2001, the IMF cut off the flow of funds to Argentina and capital flight became uncontrollable, with 25% of all the money in Argentinian banks having been withdrawn since the beginning of 2001. On 2 December, Finance Minister Cavallo announced a national cash-withdrawal limit of $250/week. Popular opinion was very negative, especially amongst the [[middle class]] (bearing in mind that the weekly withdrawal limit was higher than the total savings of the majority of the Argentinian population), for whom the economic crisis caused a breach of political confidence. Protests were held throughout December, although the largest and most important protests were those held on 19 and 20 December.\n\nAlthough people could still use their money via [[credit card]]s, [[cheque|check]]s and other forms of non-cash payments, the enforcement of these measures caused delays and problems for the general population and especially for businesses. Massive queues at every bank and growing reports of political crisis contributed to inflame Argentina's political scenario.\n\nDe la R\u00faa's position had become unsustainable, and an attempt by the [[Catholic Church]] to mediate between the government and the opposition in mid-December failed. Between 16 and 19 December there were several incidents involving unemployed activists and protesters which demanded the handing-out of food bags from supermarkets. These incidents ended up with outright looting of [[supermarket]]s and [[convenience store]]s on 18 December, taking place on [[Rosario]] and the [[Greater Buenos Aires]] areas.\n\n=== General strike and looting ===\nOn 13 December, the [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|General Confederation of Labour]] and the [[Argentine Workers' Central Union]] declared their seventh [[general strike]] against the policies of de la R\u00faa's government. The strike had a high participation rate, including strikes in sectors that rarely participated in general strikes, such as the [[financial sector]] and un-[[unionized]] workplaces.\n\nDuring the time of the strike, there were riots in the [[working class]] neighborhoods of some cities, largely instigated by the striking ''piqueteros''. Looting occurred in various commercial districts in the country's interior and in [[Buenos Aires]]. Thousands of people participated in looting, truck-robbery, and street-blocking. From 13 to 19 December, seven people were killed by security forces and shopowners.\n\n== 19 December ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2007}}\n[[File:De.la.rua.ogv|thumb|250px|right|19 December 2001, [[President of Argentina|President]] [[Fernando de la R\u00faa|De la R\u00faa]] declares the [[state of emergency|state of siege]] throughout the country. Following the broadcast, a strong \"[[cacerolazo]]\" took place in Buenos Aires and other major cities of Argentina, and thousands took the streets and main plazas in protest. (video in Spanish)]]\n\nThroughout the day new lootings took place, and the Government believed that Peronist agitators were fueling the protests, especially in the province of [[Province of Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires]]. This came after noting that the lootings often took place in Peronist-governed towns, and that the [[Buenos Aires Provincial Police]] (which ultimately answered to Buenos Aires Governor [[Carlos Ruckauf]], a top Peronist) was strangely mild in restoring order. With violence mounting across Argentina's major cities, President De la R\u00faa began to consider alternative measures to restore order.\n\nThe first option considered was to deploy the military to contain the violence. However, Argentine legislation forbids military intervention in domestic security matters unless the police and security forces are overwhelmed, a situation quickly pointed out by the Chairman of the Joint General Staff and the Chiefs of Staff of the [[Argentine Army|Army]], [[Argentine Navy|Navy]] and [[Argentine Air Force|Air Force]]. The military also pointed out that they would only intervene if their deployment was authorized by a law voted in Congress, something impossible given the Peronist majority in both Houses. The Argentine military was unwilling to take the blame if violence grew worse, learning from what had previously happened when President [[Isabel Per\u00f3n]] issued an [[Operativo_Independencia#February_1975_\"annihilation_decree\"|executive order commanding them to fight the subversive guerrilla]] movements of the 1970s (see [[Dirty War]]).\n\nWith military intervention no longer an option, De la R\u00faa resorted to declare a [[state of siege]] (essentially a [[state of emergency]]) throughout the country, deploying the [[Polic\u00eda Federal Argentina|Federal Police]], the [[Gendarmer\u00eda Nacional Argentina|National Gendarmerie]] (border guard) and the [[Prefectura Naval Argentina|Naval Prefecture]] (coast guard) to contain the growing violence.\n\nLater that night, De la R\u00faa addressed the nation to announce the state of siege and to call the Peronists to negotiate a \"government of national unity\". Following the broadcast, spontaneous ''[[cacerolazo]]s'' (\"pot banging\") took place throughout Buenos Aires and other major cities, signaling the middle-class' own unrest. 19 December concluded with the resignation of Domingo Cavallo, who had lost whatever support he had within the government. Groups of protesters mobilized throughout Buenos Aires, some of them arriving to [[Plaza de Mayo]], where there were incidents with the Federal Police forces.\n\n== 20 December ==\n[[File:Crisis 20 diciembre 2001.jpg|thumb|Police intervention in the conflict]]\n\nWhat had begun as rioting by unemployed and leftist-leaning groups had turned into a middle-class protest with the ''cacerolazos'', and the resignation of Cavallo did nothing to calm down the situation.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1721201.stm Crisis grips Argentina] [[BBC News]], 20 December 2001</ref> The De la R\u00faa administration had agreed with the military to participate in an emergency handing-out of food, however, the plan failed due to lack of cooperation from the Ministry of Social Development.\n\nThroughout the morning, groups of protesters converged on Plaza de Mayo despite the state of siege.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1720607.stm Argentina plunges into turmoil] BBC News, 20 December 2001</ref> The [[Argentine Federal Police|Federal Police]], acting under orders from the government, proceeded to try to control the protests. An attempt by a federal judge to halt police operations was disregarded, and the situation worsened with the arrival of new groups of protesters.\n\nAs violence expanded, President De la R\u00faa tried to impose censorship on all news outlets from Buenos Aires. The idea was to use the state of siege to force the television networks to stop transmitting current events and broadcast emergency programming. This plan also failed because De la R\u00faa's own Media Secretary refused to carry out his instructions. The state's repression was thus broadcast both within Argentina and abroad, causing further mobilizations toward the Plaza.\n\nViolent incidents between the police and protesters spread throughout the country. The most notorious ones took place at the Plaza de Mayo, where five people were killed. Some claim that the deaths were provoked by covert elements of the [[Buenos Aires Provincial Police]] in an attempt to further destabilize De la R\u00faa.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nWith his options steadily being reduced, De la R\u00faa went onto national television at 4 p.m. to offer the Peronists to join the government and try to bring some peace to the country. At that time, a caucus of Peronist governors was taking place at a country villa in the province of [[San Luis Province|San Luis]]. Three hours later, Humberto Roggero, head of the Peronist bloc of the House of Deputies, announced that the Peronist Party would not be a part of a \"government of national unity\".\n\nWhen he heard the Peronists' response, De la R\u00faa decided to resign from office.<ref>[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A12FC355A0C728EDDAB0994D9404482 \"Argentine Leader, his Nation frayed, abruptly resigns\"]  by Clifford Krauss. ''[[The New York Times]]'', 21 December 2001</ref> The situation on Plaza de Mayo (right in front of the [[Casa Rosada]], the Presidential Palace) was still too violent for De la R\u00faa to leave by car to his official residence at Olivos. Thus, the President's security detail decided to take him out of the Casa Rosada on board an Air Force helicopter. The iconic{{cn|date=October 2019}} images of De la R\u00faa's \"escape\" by helicopter were broadcast throughout the country.\nThe violence slowly abated. By the end of the day, 26 people had died, five of them in Buenos Aires. \n\nWith \u00c1lvarez having resigned a year earlier, the President Pro-Tempore of the Senate, [[Ram\u00f3n Puerta]], took over as Interim President until Congress could appoint a successor to De la R\u00faa.\n\n=== Victims and criminal investigation ===\n{{See also|Pocho Lepratti}}\nAll told, 36 people were killed by police forces during the December riots, including 7 children. The largest incidence of violence was in the Plaza de Mayo of Buenos Aires, in what would become known in Argentina as the \"Plaza de Mayo Massacre\" ({{Lang-es|Masacre de Plaza de Mayo}}), where 5 people were killed and 227 were injured. These crimes were investigated and brought to court. Seventeen people were charged with murder, attempted murder, including the then-Secretary of Security Enrique Mathov and the former head of the Argentinian Federal Police, Ruben Santos.\n\nWhile various officials and police officers have been charged and sentenced to prison, as of 2016 the majority of cases pertaining to violence during the December riots have not moved forward.\n\n== Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 Administration ==\n[[File:Adolfo Rodr\u00edguez Saa.JPG|thumb|[[Adolfo Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1]] at his office in the ''[[Casa Rosada]]'']]\nAccording to the Acephaly Act, Puerta would only be President until the Legislative Assembly (a joint session of the Senate and the House of Deputies) convened and appointed a new President from either one member of Congress or a provincial governor to complete the resigning President's period.\n\nThe Peronist governors assembled at San Luis -arguably the most powerful men in Argentina at the period- were divided on whom to nominate. There were three \"natural candidates\", who were the governors of the three largest provinces: [[Carlos Ruckauf]] of Buenos Aires, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel de la Sota]] of [[C\u00f3rdoba Province (Argentina)|C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Carlos Reutemann]] of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]]. As a temporary arrangement, the governors decided to nominate [[Adolfo Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1]], Governor of San Luis. The Peronists' easy majority in both houses of Congress ensured that Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 was elected on 22 December.\n\nWhile de la R\u00faa's term expired in 2003, some argued that only a president legitimated by popular vote would be able to bring Argentina out of the crisis. To that end, Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 was designated as interim president for only three months, until presidential elections were held on 3 March. If needed, a [[ballotage in Argentina|ballotage]] would be held on 17 March. The winner would take office on 5 April for the balance of de la R\u00faa's term. \n\nHowever, Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 didn't seem at all satisfied with being a caretaker president. From the first moment, Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 embarked on ambitious projects aimed at giving him popularity. In his inaugural speech, he announced that Argentina would [[default (finance)|default]] on its foreign debt, an announcement received by rousing applause from the members of Congress. He then proceeded to announce the issuing of a \"third currency\" (alongside the peso and the dollar) to boost consumption. Later on, Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 announced that he would extradite every former military officer charged with human rights abuses during the Dirty War who was requested by foreign courts. Another measure was to stand down the state of siege.\n\nThere were also some unpopular designations to the Cabinet. The most notorious one was the appointment of former Mayor of Buenos Aires [[Carlos Grosso]], arguably one of the most corrupt figures in Argentine politics. Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 also courted the powerful Peronist [[trade unions]] in a move that was recognized as an attempt to wrestle power from the other Peronist governors.\n\nNew riots and ''cacerolazos'' took place on Buenos Aires, with some protesters entering the Congress Palace and burning furniture. On 30 December, Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 called for a summit of Peronist governors at the Presidential holiday retreat of Chapadmalal, {{convert|19|km|abbr=off}} south of [[Mar del Plata]]. Of the fourteen Peronist governors, only five attended. Realizing that he lacked support from his own party, Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1 returned to his home province to announce his own resignation to the Presidency after barely a week in office.\n\n== Designation of Eduardo Duhalde ==\n[[Image:Duhalde.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Former President Eduardo Duhalde (2002\u20132003)]]\nRam\u00f3n Puerta refused to take over as interim President again, resigning as President Pro-Tempore of the Senate. With no President, Vice President or President Pro-Tempore of the Senate, the Presidency of Argentina was placed in the hands of the next-in-line: [[Eduardo Cama\u00f1o]], who was the Speaker of the House of Deputies.\n\nCama\u00f1o was to take over until a new Legislative Assembly was convened. The Assembly convened on 1 January 2002, and debated extensively before designating Senator [[Eduardo Duhalde]] as President almost at midnight.\n\nDuhalde was one of the top leaders of the Peronist Party. However, many had thought that Duhalde's political career was ruined after his defeat in the [[Elections in Argentina, 1999|1999 presidential elections]]. In an ironic twist of events, Duhalde was called to complete the term of the man who beat him in the elections, Fernando de la R\u00faa. This was not to be a provisional presidency, as Duhalde was designated to complete the interrupted term of De la R\u00faa until the [[Elections in Argentina, 2003|2003 presidential elections]].\n\nWith regard to the economy Duhalde and his Economy Minister [[Jorge Remes Lenicov]] decided on an even more extreme freezing of the bank deposits, which was then coupled with the so-called ''pesificaci\u00f3n'' (\"peso-ification\", a forced transformation of all dollar-denominated accounts into pesos at an arbitrary fixed [[exchange rate]]), and a regulated [[devaluation]]. The fixed exchange rate system was abandoned soon afterwards, which was followed by a large [[depreciation (currency)|depreciation]].\n\n== Social changes ==\nDuring the unrest millions of people formed [[Participatory democracy|neighbourhood assemblies]], occupied unused land and factories, created [[barter]] and [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]] networks, implemented workers' self-management across hundreds of factories and rejected trade unionism and political parties.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Que Se Vayan Todos: Argentina's Popular Rebellion|last=Whitney|first=Jennifer|publisher=Kersplebedeb|year=2003|isbn=|location=Montreal|pages=56}}</ref> Around a third of the population participated in these creations and these efforts have been repeatedly praised by [[Anarchism|anarchists]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Anarchy Works|last=Gelderloos|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[1989 riots in Argentina]]\n* [[List of cases of police brutality in Argentina]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources and further reading ==\n* {{cite book \n|last= Reato\n|first= Ceferino\n|date= 2015\n|title= Doce noches\n|trans-title= Twelve nights\n|language= Spanish\n|location= Argentina\n|publisher= Sudamericana\n|isbn= 978-950-07-5203-9}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/americas/12/19/argentina.riots/ |title=Argentina in state of siege after deadly riots |publisher=CNN.com |date=20 December 2001}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/americas/12/20/argentina/index.html |title=Argentina teeters on possible economic collapse |publisher=CNN.com |date=21 December 2001 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024022128/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/americas/12/20/argentina/index.html |archivedate=24 October 2007 }}\n* {{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1721103.stm |title=The events that triggered Argentina's crisis |publisher=BBC News - Business |date=21 December 2001}}\n* {{cite journal|url=http://www.sunysb.edu/sociol/faculty/Auyero/Food%20Riots%203.pdf |title=The Dynamics of Collective Violence: Dissecting Food Riots in Contemporary Argentina |author=Javier Auyero, Timothy Patrick Moran |publisher=Department of Sociology, State University of New York \u2013 Stony Brook |format=PDF |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615180050/http://www.sunysb.edu/sociol/faculty/Auyero/Food%20Riots%203.pdf |archivedate=15 June 2007 }}\n* {{cite journal |url=http://www.wdm.org.uk/campaigns/cambriefs/debt/stateunrest3/unrest3i.htm |author=Mark Ellis-Jones |title=States of unrest III: Resistance to IMF and World Bank policies in poor countries: Argentina |publisher=World Development Movement |date=April 2003 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109185014/http://www.wdm.org.uk/campaigns/cambriefs/debt/stateunrest3/unrest3i.htm |archivedate=9 November 2005 }}\n\n{{Argentina topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:December 2001 Riots In Argentina}}\n[[Category:Emergency laws]]\n[[Category:Protest marches]]\n[[Category:Economic history of Argentina]]\n[[Category:Protests in Argentina]]\n[[Category:Riots and civil disorder in Argentina]]\n[[Category:Police misconduct in Argentina]]\n[[Category:2001 riots]]\n[[Category:2001 in Argentina]]\n[[Category:Presidency of Fernando de la R\u00faa]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:2001 protests]]\n[[Category:December 2001 events in South America]]\n", "name_user": "2a02:c7f:2402:a00:e467:8e1:8d1f:2a08", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_2001_riots_in_Argentina"}

Mwakikagile, ''My Life as an African: Autobiographical Writings'', Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: New Africa Press, 2009, p. 21. {{ISBN|9789987160051}}.</ref> His father Elijah Mwakikagile, who once worked at the internationally renowned [[Amani Research Institute]] in the late forties, was a medical assistant during the British colonial era and was one of the very few in the entire country of 10 million people. Medical assistants underwent an intensive three-year training after finishing secondary school and worked as a substitute for doctors. They were even called ''madaktari'' (doctors) in Swahili and formed the backbone of the medical system in Tanganyika as was the case in other British colonies. There were fewer than 10 doctors in colonial Tanganyika in the forties and fifties and only 12 at independence on 9 December 1961. And there were fewer than 300 medical assistants during those years serving millions of people in a vast country of more than 365,000 square miles. Godfrey's mother Syabumi Mwakikagile (n\u00e9e Mwambapa), a pupil of Tanganyika's prominent British feminist educator and later member of parliament Mary Hancock, was a housewife.<ref name=\"Kyoso pp. 8-9\" /> The eldest of his siblings, he was named Godfrey by his aunt Isabella, one of his father's younger sisters, and was baptised at an early age.<ref name=\"Kyoso\" />\n\nHis father played a critical role in his early life and education. He was a very strict disciplinarian and taught him at home when he was attending primary school and during the first two years of middle school before he left home to go to boarding school when he was 13 years old. His mother, who taught Sunday school and was a volunteer adult education teacher for some time teaching adults how to read and write, also taught him at home when he was in primary school.<ref>Kyoso, p. 123, 169, 176</ref>\n\n===Family connections===\nMwakikagile grew up in a politically conscious family. His parents, especially his father, were friends with some of the leading figures in the struggle for independence, and some renowned [[African nationalism|African nationalists]] and [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-Africanists]] of that era. They included [[Austin Shaba]], Elijah Mwakikagile's co-worker as a medical assistant and earlier his classmate at a medical training centre at Tanganyika's largest hospital in the capital [[Dar es Salaam]] later transformed into the country's first medical school who also served as a member of parliament for [[Mtwara]] and cabinet member in [[President of Tanzania|the first independence cabinet]]\u2014 serving as Minister of Local Government under [[Julius Nyerere]], and later as Minister of Health and Housing, and as Deputy [[List of Speakers of the National Assembly of Tanzania|Speaker of Parliament]];\n[[John Mwakangale]], a classmate of Elijah Mwakikagile from Standard One at [[Tukuyu]] Primary School to [[Malangali Secondary School]]. They came from the same area, five miles apart, and knew each other since childhood. Mwakangale became one of the prominent leaders of the [[Tanganyika African National Union]] (TANU) and of the [[Pan-African Freedom Movement for East and Central Africa]] (PAFMECA) under the leadership of Pan-Africanist and African nationalist Julius Nyerere.\n\nJohn Mwakangale was also the first leader [[Nelson Mandela]] met in newly independent Tanganyika in January 1962 - just one month after the country emerged from colonial rule - when Mandela secretly left [[South Africa]] on 11 January to seek assistance from other African countries in the struggle against apartheid and wrote about him in his autobiography [[Long Walk to Freedom]]. Tanganyika was the first independent African country Mandela visited and the first in the region to win independence. He went to other African countries using a travel document given to him by the government of Tanganyika. The document stated: \"This is Nelson Mandela, a citizen of the Republic of South Africa. He has permission to leave Tanganyika and return here.\" Tanganyika was chosen by other African leaders in May 1963 to be the headquarters of all the African liberation movements under the leadership of President Julius Nyerere when they met in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to form the [[Organisation of African Unity]] ([[OAU]]).\n\nJohn Mwakangale was also a member of parliament and served in the cabinet as Minister of Labour under Nyerere in the early part of independence. Professor [[John Iliffe (historian)|John Iliffe]] in his book ''A Modern History of Tanganyika'' described John Mwakangale as a \"vehement nationalist.\" He did not even want American [[Peace Corps]] in Tanganyika and accused them of causing trouble. He was quoted in a news report, \"M.P. Attacks American Peace Corps,\" which was the main story on the front page of the Tanganyika ''Standard'', 12 June 1964, stating: \"These people are not here for peace, they are here for trouble. We do not want any more Peace Corps.\"\n\nAmerican Peace Corps were some of Godfrey Mwakikagile's teachers in middle school and secondary school. One of them was [[Leonard Levitt]], his teacher in middle school in 1964 who became a renowned author. He wrote, among other works, ''An African Season'', the first book ever written by a Peace Corps.\n\nOther classmates of Elijah Mwakikagile were Wilbard B.K. Mwanjisi from Standard One at Tukuyu Primary School to Malangali Secondary School who became a doctor, prominent member of TANU and, before leaving government service, was president of a national organisation for African government employees during colonial rule; [[Jeremiah Kasambala]], Elijah Mwakikagile's classmate at Malangali Secondary School who became head of the [[Rungwe]] African Cooperative Union responsible for mobilising support from farmers to join the struggle for independence. Kasambala went on to become a cabinet member in the early years of independence\u2014taking over the portfolio for [[Minister of Industry and Trade (Tanzania)|Commerce and Cooperatives]] and later served as Minister of Industries, Minerals and Energy; and Brown Ngwilulupi, appointed by President Nyerere as Secretary General of the [[Cooperative Union of Tanganyika]] (CUT), the largest farmers' union in the country.\n\nNgwilulupi later left the ruling party, [[Chama Cha Mapinduzi]], and became co-founder of Tanzania's largest opposition party [[Chadema]] and served as vice chairman. Brown Ngwilulupi and Elijah Mwakikagile came from the same village four miles south of the town of [[Tukuyu]] in Rungwe District ringed by misty blue mountains north of Lake Nyasa in the Great Rift Valley in the Southern Highlands Province and were classmates from Standard One at Tukuyu Primary School to Malangali Secondary School, one of the top schools in colonial Tanganyika where Elijah was head prefect. They later became relatives-in-law. Their respective wives, who came from the same area their husbands came from, were first cousins to each other and were born and brought up together in the same household. Brown Ngwilulupi was an elder brother of Ephraim Weidi Ngwilulupi Mwasakafyuka\u2014a former senior diplomat at the Tanzania Mission to the [[United Nations]] and at the Tanzanian embassy in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]], and later Tanzania's ambassador to [[France]] and [[Nigeria]] who also left the ruling party and joined one of the main opposition parties where he became head of its foreign affairs division. He also once served as head of the [[Africa]] and [[Middle East]] Division at the Tanzanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.<ref>Kyoso, pp. 22, 193-4</ref><ref>Mwakikagile, Godfrey, ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'', New Africa Press (2007), p. 105, {{ISBN|9780980253412}} [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=D4LcR4iOmcYC&pg=PA105#v=onepage&q&f=false] (last retrieved 1 December 2018)</ref><ref>[[AllAfrica.com]] - ''Tanzania: Recalling the First Union Cabinet of 1964'' (25 November 2010) [https://allafrica.com/stories/201011260028.html]</ref><ref>Mwakikagile, Godfrey, ''Life under British Colonial Rule: Recollections of an African and a British Administrator in Tanganyika and Southern Rhodesia'', New Africa Press (2018), p. 112, {{ISBN|9789987160426}}[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8BZaDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA112#v=onepage&q&f=false] (last retrieved 1 December 2018)</ref>\n\nThe American ambassador to Tanzania, [[James W.

Owen's father was an elder brother of Godfrey's mother, the last-born in her family. And Godfrey's father was a first cousin of one of Tanzania's first commercial airline pilots Oscar Mwamwaja who was shot but survived when he was a co-pilot of an Air Tanzania plane that was hijacked on 26 February 1982 and forced to fly from Tanzania to [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Elijah's mother was an elder sister of Oscar's father.\n\n===Education and early employment===\nGodfrey Mwakikagile attended Kyimbila Primary School - founded by British feminist educator Mary Hancock and transformed into a co-educational institution - near the town of Tukuyu, and Mpuguso Middle School in Rungwe District, [[Mbeya Region]], in the Southern Highlands. The headmaster of Mpuguso Middle School, Moses Mwakibete, was his math teacher in 1961 and later became a judge at the High Court of Tanzania appointed by President Nyerere. Mwakikagile also attended [[Songea]] Secondary School in [[Ruvuma Region]] which was once a part of the Southern Province, and Tambaza High School (up to Form Six) in Dar es Salaam.<ref>Mwakikagile, Godfrey, ''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'', pp.&nbsp;44, 77, 122; ''My Life as an African'', pp.&nbsp;47-48, 78, 89, 92, 117, 119, 138, 154, 172, 175; ''Tanzania under Mwalimu Nyerere: Reflections on an African Statesman'', pp.&nbsp;15\u201316, New Africa Press - Pretoria, South Africa, (2006), {{ISBN|9780980253498}}</ref>\n\nWhile still in high school at Tambaza, Mwakikagile joined the editorial staff of the ''Standard'' (later renamed the [[Daily News (Tanzania)|Daily News]]) in 1969 as a reporter.<ref name=\"Stan\">''My Life as an African'', pp. 89\u201390; \"Newsman Leaves for America,\" ''Daily News'', Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, 7 November 1972, p.&nbsp;3; ''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'', p.&nbsp;56.</ref> Founded in 1930, it was the oldest and largest English newspaper in the country and one of the three largest in [[East Africa]], a region comprising [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]] and Tanzania.\n\nAfter finishing high school in November 1970, Mwakikagile joined the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force|National Service]] in January 1971 which was mandatory for all those who had completed secondary school, high school and college or university studies. He underwent training, which included basic military training, at [[Ruvu, Kibaha District|Ruvu]] National Service camp when it was headed by his former primary school teacher Eslie Mwakyambiki before he became a Member of Parliament (MP) and Deputy Minister of Defence and National Service under President Nyerere. Mwakikagile then progressed to another National Service camp in [[Bukoba]] on the shores of [[Lake Victoria]] in the North-West Region bordering Uganda.\n\nAfter leaving National Service, Mwakikagile returned to the ''Daily News''. His editor then was Sammy Mdee who later served as President Nyerere's press secretary and as  Tanzania's deputy ambassador to the United Nations, and then [[Benjamin Mkapa]] who helped him to further his studies in the [[United States]]. Years later, Mkapa became President of Tanzania after serving as President Nyerere's press secretary, Minister of Foreign Affairs and as ambassador to Nigeria, Canada and the United States among other cabinet and ambassadorial posts. He was a student of Nyerere in secondary school<ref>\"Newsman Leaves for America,\" ''Daily News'', 7 November 1972, p.&nbsp;3; ''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'', p.&nbsp;123; ''My Life as an African'', p.&nbsp;90.</ref>\n\nMwakikagile also worked as an [[information officer]] at the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (now known as the [[Ministry of Information, Youth, Culture and Sports]]) in Dar es Salaam before going to the United States in November 1972 for further studies.<ref>\"Newsman Leaves for America,\" ''Daily News'', 7 November 1972, p.&nbsp;3; ''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'', pp.&nbsp;122\u2013123; ''My Life as an African'', p.&nbsp;176.</ref>\n\nIn the United States, Godfrey Mwakikagile served as president of the African Students Union whilst attending [[Wayne State University]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].

One of his professors of economics and head of the economics department at Aquinas was [[Kenneth Marin]] who had worked as an economist for the government of Tanzania in Dar es Salaam in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Before he went to Tanzania, Professor Marin was appointed by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] to serve on Wage and Price Control during the mid-sixties. President Johnson appointed him as a member of the [[White House]] Consumer Advisory Council. In 1966, Professor Marin was a member of a U.S. State Department evaluation team that was assigned to review various performances in the economic and political arena in six South American countries. After he left Tanzania, he returned to his  home town, Grand Rapids, to teach at Aquinas College, his alma mater. He was also a graduate of the [[University of Michigan]], [[Ann Arbor]].<ref>''My Life as an African'', pp.&nbsp;306, 328; ''Nyerere and Africa'', p.&nbsp;649.</ref><ref>\"Former CUNA (Credit Union National Association) chairman Ken Marin dies,\" ''Credit Union Times'', Hoboken, New Jersey, 8 January 2008.

Mwakikagile lived under this system of racial segregation and discrimination when he was growing up in Tanganyika in the fifties. [[Racial segregation|Racial segregation based on skin colour]] similar to those in [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]] and the [[United States]] was inflicted against the native Africans by the European colonialists. Lavatories were labelled \"Europeans,\" \"Asians\" and \"Africans.\" Some hotels and bars were labelled \"Europeans.\" There were separate schools for Europeans, Asians and Africans. Facilities for Africans - black people - were the worst.\n\nAfrican leaders, including [[Julius Nyerere]], campaigning for independence were subjected to the same racial indignities which continued even after the end of colonial rule, especially during the early years, but drew a swift response from the new government which was predominantly black and multi-racial. As Mwakikagile stated in his book ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'', citing Legum and Mmari:\n\n:\"Mwalimu [Julius Nyerere] himself had experienced racial discrimination, what we in East Africa \u2013 and elsewhere including southern Africa \u2013 also call colour bar. As [[Colin Legum]] states in a book he edited with Tanzanian professor, Geoffrey Mmari, ''Mwalimu: The Influence of Nyerere'':\n\n::''I was privileged to meet Nyerere while he was still a young teacher in short trousers at the very beginning of his political career, and to engage in private conversations with him since the early 1950s.''\n\n::''My very first encounter in 1953 taught me something about his calm authority in the face of racism in colonial Tanganyika. I had arranged a meeting with four leaders of the nascent nationalist movement at the Old Africa Hotel in [[Dar es Salaam]]. We sat at a table on the pavement and ordered five beers, but before we could lift our glasses an African waiter rushed up and whipped away all the glasses except mine.''\n\n::''I rose to protest to the white manager, but Nyerere restrained me. 'I am glad it happened,' he said, 'now you can go and tell your friend Sir Edward Twining [the colonial governor at the time] how things are in this country.'''\n\n::''His manner was light and amusing, with no hint of anger.''\n\nSimple, yet profound. For, beneath the surface lay a steely character with a deep passion for justice across the colour line and an uncompromising commitment to the egalitarian ideals he espoused and implemented throughout his political career, favouring none.\n\nYears later his son, Andrew Nyerere, told me about an incident that also took place in the capital Dar es Salaam shortly after Tanganyika won independence in 1961 near the school he and I attended and where we also stayed from 1969 - 1970.  Like the incident earlier when Julius Nyerere was humiliated at the Old Africa Hotel back in 1953, this one also involved race. As Andrew stated in a letter to me in 2002 when I was writing this book:\n\n'As you remember, Sheikh Amri Abeid was the first mayor of Dar es Salaam. Soon after independence, the mayor went to Palm Beach Hotel (near our high school, Tambaza, on United Nations Road in Upanga). There was a sign at the hotel which clearly stated: 'No Africans and dogs allowed inside.' He was blocked from entering the hotel, and said in protest, 'But I am the Mayor.' Still he was told, 'You will not get in.' Shortly thereafter, the owner of the hotel was given 48 hours to leave the country. When the nationalization exercise began, that hotel was the first to be nationalized.'\n\nSuch insults were the last thing that could be tolerated in newly independent Tanganyika. And President Nyerere, probably more than any other African leader, would not have tolerated, and did not tolerate, seeing even the humblest of peasants being insulted and humiliated by anyone including fellow countrymen.\" - (Godfrey Mwakikagile, ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'', Fifth Edition, New Africa Press, 2010, pp. 501 \u2013 502).\n\nThere was also residential segregation in urban areas reminiscent of apartheid South Africa and the United States during and even after the era of segregation. Members of different races lived in their own areas. Dar es Salaam was a typical example. As [[Trevor Grundy]], a British journalist who worked in Tanzania at the same newspaper where Godfrey Mwakikagile also worked as a news reporter during the same period, stated in his review of Professor Thomas Molony's book, ''Nyerere - The Early Years'':\n\n\"The British turned Tanganyika into an undeclared apartheid state that was socially divided between divided Africans, Europeans and Asians....It was British-style apartheid - their secret was never to give racial segregation a name.\" - (Trevor Grundy, \"Julius Nyerere Reconsidered\", review of Thomas Molony, ''Nyerere - The Early Years'', africaunauthorised.com, 4 May 2015).\n\nThe years Godfrey Mwakikagile spent under segregation when he was growing up in different parts of Tanganyika shaped his thinking and perspective on race relations and on the impact of colonial rule on the colonised when he became a writer of non-fiction books about colonial and post-colonial Africa.\n\nThere was also racial discrimination in employment during colonial rule when Godfrey Mwakikagile was growing up in the fifties. Europeans, Asians and members of other races earned more than Africans did even if they had the same skills and level of education. His father was a victim of such discrimination when he worked for the colonial government, as he has stated in his autobiographical writings.\n\nThe struggle for independence in Tanganyika in the 1950s, Mwakikagile's formative years, was partly fuelled by such racial injustices which, years later, became the focus of some of his writings.\n\n'''Racial incidents'''\n\nHe has written about racism in his book ''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'' and other works including ''Life under British Colonial Rule: Recollections of an African'' in which he has described some incidents of racial injustice. One such incident involved his father when a white supervisor where he worked told him he could not have lunch in the office they shared or even put it on the table. But the supervisor could eat there.\n\nAnother one had to do with Godfrey Mwakikagile himself when, as a six-year-old walking to school with other boys, he was severely injured after being chased and bitten by a dog owned by a white couple who lived in a house the children went by everyday, on a public road, on their way to and from school. Decades later, he stated in his autobiographical writings, ''Life under British Colonial Rule: Recollections of an African'' published in 2018, that he still had a highly visible scar on his right knee where he was bitten by the dog. It was a large dog and it could have killed him.\n\nThe couple had two dogs, including a German shepherd, which used to chase the boys. They knew the children went by their house and saw them on their way to and from school everyday but did not tie the dogs or keep them on leashes.\n\nThe house was on a tea plantation at Kyimbila, the children passed through, and the husband was the manager of Kyimbila Tea Estate.\n\nThat was in 1956 when Godfrey Mwakikagile was in Standard One in primary school in Rungwe District in the Southern Highlands Province, as he stated in his books ''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'', ''My Life as an African'', ''Life under British Colonial Rule'' and ''Tanzania under Mwalimu Nyerere: Reflections on an African Statesman''.\n\nAfter being bitten by the dog, he stated in his autobiographical writings that he went on to school where he attended class without getting any help \u2013 there was no medical assistance at the primary school, not even a First Aid kit \u2013 until he returned home in the evening. He continued to go to school in the following days. And nothing could be done to the dog owners during those days. It was colonial rule, blacks did not have the same rights whites had and \"knew their place\" in terms of social status as colonial subjects not as equal citizens in a racially divided society which was vertically structured not only to keep whites on top of other races, especially blacks, but also virtually above the law.\n\nGodfrey Mwakikagile also stated in his autobiographical works that when he was bitten by the dog, the attack was seared in his memory but as a six-year-old he did not see it in terms of racism until he became a teenager. Years later, he stated in some of his writings that had the children been white, the white couple would probably not have allowed the dogs to roam freely knowing they could attack them.\n\nThe colonial rulers and many white settlers had total disregard for the well-being of Africans as Godfrey Mwakikagile himself experienced when he was growing up in colonial Tanganyika and almost lost his life when he was attacked by a dog owned by a white couple who did not care about the safety of African children, or any other blacks, passing by their house even though they walked on a public road.  As he stated in his book, ''Life under British Colonial Rule'':\n\n\"There is no question that justice was colour-conscious during colonial rule. That was one of the tragedies of being colonised; our status defined by the colour of our skin.\n\nColour is immaterial but it carries a lot of weight.\" - (Godfrey Mwakikagile, ''Life under British Colonial Rule'', New Africa Press, 2018, p.&nbsp;108; G. Mwakikagile, ''Black Conservatives in the United States'', 2006, p.&nbsp;96).\n\n==Writings==\n\nMwakikagile's first book, ''Economic Development in Africa'', was published in June 1999. He has maintained a steady pace since then, writing more than 70 books in 20 years as his bibliography shows, mostly about Africa during the post-colonial era. He has been described as a political scientist and as a historian although his works defy classification. He has written about history, politics, economics, as well as contemporary and international affairs from an African and a Third World perspective.\n\nHe takes an interdisciplinary approach in his works combining history, political science, economics, philosophy, cultural and international studies and other academic disciplines in his analysis of a wide range of issues focusing on Africa, especially during the post-colonial era. He has also written some books about the African diaspora, mainly Black America and the Afro-Caribbean region including Afro-Caribbean communities in Britain and the United States.\n\n===Book: ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era''===\n\nHe is known for his book ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'',<ref>Godfrey Mwakikagile, ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'', 5th Edition, {{ISBN|0980253411}}, Pretoria, South Africa: New Africa Press, 2010.</ref> published not long after Nyerere died.

Professor Southall was also the editor of the journal during that period.\n\nOthers who reviewed the book include Professor A.B. Assensoh, a [[Ghanaian]] teaching at [[Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], [[Indiana]], in the [[United States]]. He reviewed the first edition of ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'' in the ''African Studies Review'', an academic journal of the [[African Studies Association]], in 2003.\n\nIt is also a comprehensive work on post-colonial Africa in terms of the major events covered since the sixties when most countries on the continent won independence.\n\nEvents covered include emergence and consolidation of the one-party state as a continental phenomenon after the end of colonial rule; the Congo crisis triggered by the secession of [[Katanga Province]] and the assassination of [[Patrice Lumumba]]; the end of Mobutu's reign over Congo after decades in power since Lumumba's assassination; the [[Zanzibar revolution]] followed by the union of Tanganyika and Zanzibar to form Tanzania; declaration of independence by Biafra and subsequent civil war ignited by the secession of the Eastern Region resolutely opposed by Federal Nigeria; the war between Tanzania and Uganda under Idi Amin.\n\nOther events Mwakikagile has covered in his book include Western involvement in the countries of southern Africa in support of white minority governments; the liberation struggle in [[Mozambique]] and eventual victory by the freedom fighters of the [[Front for the Liberation of Mozambique]] ([[Frelimo]]); the war in [[Zimbabwe]] leading to victory by the liberation forces of [[ZANU]] and [[ZAPU]]; the struggle for independence in Angola led by the [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] ([[MPLA]]) and subsequent victory over the Portuguese colonial forces.\n\nThe influence of Nyerere as a continental and Third World leader also constitutes a significant part of the book including a chapter on Nyerere and Nkrumah on the different approaches they took in an attempt to achieve continental unity under one government.\n\nThe first and last chapters provide a comprehensive look at the continent from the sixties to the nineties and beyond, constituting a panoramic view of post-colonial Africa during some of its most turbulent times since the end of colonial rule.\n\nThe book has also been cited by a number of African leaders including [[South Africa|South African]] Vice-President [[Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka]] in one of her speeches about African leadership and development in which she quoted the author.<ref>Godfrey Mwakikagile quoted by South African Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka in \"Address Delivered by the Deputy President, Ms. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka at the Third Annual Julius Nyerere Memorial Lecture at the University of the Western Cape, South Africa.\" Issued by the Presidency through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Pretoria, South Africa, 6 September 2006.</ref>\n\n===Book: ''Africa and the West''===\n\nGodfrey Mwakikagile's 2000 book ''Africa and the West'' was favourably reviewed in a number of publications, including the influential ''West Africa'' magazine by editor Kofi Akosah-Sarpong, who described Mwakikagile as an author who articulates the position of [[African Renaissance]] thinkers.<!--, a [[Ghanaian]] who also once was a visiting lecturer and scholar-in-residence at the [[University of Botswana]], gave the book an excellent review.\n\nThe book is a sweeping survey of the continent before the advent of colonial rule and during the colonial era as well as after independence, was also reviewed by ''West Africa'' magazine in its edition of 21\u201327 January 2002--><ref>Kofi Akosah-Sarpong, \"Back to The Roots,\" in ''West Africa'', 21\u201327 January 2002, p.&nbsp;43.</ref> The book has been described as an appeal to Africans to respect their cultures, values, and traditions and take a firm stand against alien ideas that pollute African minds and undermine Africa. A strong condemnation of the conquest of Africa by the imperial powers, it is also a philosophical text used in a number of colleges and universities in the study of African identity, philosophy, and history.\n\nMwakikagile has written about the impact of Western influence on Africa and how it has affected the continent's destiny even in terms of perception of its people by the rest of the world. Although he concedes there may have been some benefits \u2013 on both sides \u2013 from the interaction between Africa and Europe, he contends that the effect of Western influence on Africans has largely been negative and has served to reinforce racial stereotypes about Africans which have a long history in the minds of Westerners from the first time they came into contact with Africans.\n\nHe contends that racism has been a major factor in this interaction between Africa and the West, including total disregard for the well-being of Africans which was a continental phenomenon especially during colonial rule even if the parallels were not exact; it was the same experience, and humiliation, nonetheless, be it in Tanganyika, [[Kenya]], [[Guinea]] or [[Mali]]. As he states in his book ''Africa and The West'':\n\n\u201cIn all the African colonies, exploitation went hand in hand with degradation and brutality. In the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] under the [[Belgian]] [[King Leopold II]], Belgians chopped off the hands and arms of Africans who did not collect enough rubber from the forest. In Tanganyika, when it was [[German East Africa]], [[Germans]] introduced forced labor and corporal punishment, virtually enslaving Africans, a practice which triggered the [[Maji Maji]] war of resistance from 1905 \u2013 07 and covered almost half of the country. The uprising almost ended German rule which was saved only after reinforcements were rushed from [[Germany]].\n\nThe [[French people|French]] in [[West Africa]] also introduced forced labor. Some of the leaders of independent Africa toiled in those labor camps. Madeira Keita, a native of Mali who was active in the politics of Guinea before it won independence in 1958 and collaborated closely with [[Sekou Toure]] in founding the [[Democratic Party of Guinea]], was one of them. In April 1959, he became Interior Minister of Mali, and in August 1960, he also became Minister of National Defense, holding two ministerial posts under President Modibo Keita. He related his experience as a conscripted laborer:\n\n'Before 1945, there was a colonial regime with government by decree, the regime of the ''indignat''. The ''indignat'' form of government permitted the colonial administration to put Africans in prison without any trial. Sometimes you were put in prison for two weeks because you did not greet the administrator or the commander. You were happy enough if they did not throw stones at you or send you to a work camp, because there was also forced labor at that time. In 1947, I met French journalists who were very surprised to learn that forced labor was nonvoluntary and not paid for. Transportation was not even covered; nor were food and lodging. The only thing that was covered was work.'\n\nThe conquest of Africa inexorably led to such brutality because its purpose was exploitation which has no room for compassion. It was an invasion we could very well have done without. The baneful foreign influence Africa is still subjected to is a result of that invasion. And we are now inextricably linked with our former conquerors, for better or for worse, in an international system which accentuates inequalities and from which no part of humanity can extricate itself.\n\nBut the materialism of the West, which has found its way into Africa with devastating impact, must be counterbalanced with the spirituality and sense of sharing of the African which animates his culture, indeed his very being.\" - Godfrey Mwakikagile, ''Africa and The West'', Huntington, New York: Nova Science Publishers, Inc., 2000, pp. 14 \u2013 15; Madeira Keita, \"Le Parti Unique en Afrique,\" in ''Presence Africaine'', No. 30, February \u2013 March 1960; and Madeira Keita, \"The Single Party in Africa,\" in Paul E. Sigmund, ed., ''The Ideologies of the Developing Nations'', New York: Praeger, 1963, p.&nbsp;170. On the African uprising and war of resistance against German colonial rule in Tanganyika, see, among other works, G. C. K. Gwassa and John Iliffe, eds., ''Records of the Maji-Maji Rising'', Dar es Salaam: Tanzania Publishing House, 1968).\n\nMwakikagile further stated in ''Africa and The West'':\n\n\"The argument that we blacks are genetically inferior to members of other races is nothing new. It is a stereotype rooted in Western intellectual tradition and has even been given \"credibility\" by some of the most eminent thinkers of the Western world including [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Georg Hegel]], [[David Hume]], and [[Baron de Montesquieu]]. Some of them did not even consider blacks to be full human beings. As Montesquieu stated in ''The Spirit of the Laws'':\n\n'These creatures are all over black, and with such a flat nose, that they can scarcely be pitied. It is hardly to be believed that God, who is a wise Being, should place a soul, especially a good soul, in such a black, ugly body. The Negroes prefer a glass necklace to that gold which polite nations so highly value: can there be a greater proof of their wanting common sense? It is impossible for us to suppose these creatures to be men.'\n\nThe other philosophers were no less racist. According to Kant:\n\n'The Negroes of Africa have received from nature no intelligence that rises above the foolish. The difference between the two races (black and white) is thus a substantial one: it appears to be just as great in respect of the faculties of the mind as in color.'\n\nHume:\n\n'I am apt to suspect the Negroes...to be naturally inferior to the whites. There never was any civilized nation of any other complexion than white, nor even any individual eminent in action or speculation. No ingenious manufactures among them, no arts, no sciences...Such a uniform and constant difference could not happen, in so many countries and ages, if nature had not made an original distinction betwixt these breeds of men.'\n\nAnd according to Hegel:\n\n'Africa...is no historical part of the world; it has no movement or development to exhibit.'\n\nIt is a sentiment echoed more than 100 years later in contemporary times by many people including British historian [[Arnold Toynbee]] who died in 1975. As he put it:\n\n'The black races alone have not contributed positively to any civilization.'\n\nAnd in the words of that great humanitarian Dr. [[Albert Schweitzer]]:\n\n'The Negro is a child, and with children nothing can be done without the use of authority. We must, therefore, so arrange the circumstances of daily life that my natural authority can find expression. With regard to the Negroes, then, I have coined the formula: 'I am your brother, it is true, but your elder brother\"...\n\nThe conquest of Africa led not only to oppression and exploitation, but also to denigration of her culture and indigenous institutions. Africans, at least a vary large number of them, were brainwashed into believing that they had no history they could be proud of; that all their customs and traditions were bad, and that even their languages were bad.... When Africa was conquered by the imperial powers, she was also conquered by ideas...as a very effective weapon for conquering other people by conquering their minds....\n\nThere is no other continent which is endowed with so much in terms of natural resources. But there is also no other continent where it has been so easy for foreigners to take what does not belong to them....\nBecause of the pervasive nature of Western influence, its negative impact has reached all parts of the world, including Africa where the devastation wrought is difficult to contain because of the underdeveloped nature of our economies, and also because of our inability to resist such penetration. The sheer scope of such influence, as well as its negative attraction especially among the youth who are mesmerized by the glitter of the West, is mind-boggling and far beyond our capacity to resist it. That is especially the case in the cities which continue to attract millions of people in search of better - read, Western - life. It is a burden Africa cannot bear.\n\nThe West may have harnessed the forces of nature and pushed the frontiers of knowledge in many areas, from which Africa has indeed benefited as has the rest of the world. But Africa's contribution \u2013 material and spiritual as well as intellectual \u2013 to the growth of Western civilization has never been fully acknowledged. Nor has the destruction of African civilization by the West through imperial conquest. That is undoubtedly one of the saddest chapters in the history of relations between Africa and the West. As Immanuel Kant, although a racist, conceded in one of his works ''Eternal Peace and Other Essays'':\n\n'If we compare the barbarian instances of inhospitality...with the inhuman behavior of the civilized, and especially the commercial, states of our continent, the injustice practiced by them even in their first contact with foreign lands and peoples fills us with horror; the mere visiting of such peoples being regarded by them as equivalent to a conquest...The Negro lands,...The Cape of Good Hope, etc., on being discovered, were treated as countries that belonged to nobody; for the aboriginal inhabitants were reckoned as nothing...And all this has been done by nations who make a great ado about their piety, and who, while drinking up iniquity like water, would have themselves regarded as the very elect of orthodox faith.'\n\nAfrica has yet to recover from the multiple wounds inflicted on her by this Western invasion. But there is a glimmer of hope. And that is traditional Africa. In spite of all the devastating blows our continent has sustained from the West, traditional Africa continues to be the continent's spiritual anchor and bedrock of our values without which we are no more than a dilapidated house shifting on quick sand. It is to traditional society that we must turn to save Africa from the West, and also save ourselves \u2013 from ourselves....Our future may lie in the past.\" - (G. Mwakikagile, ''Africa and The Wes''t, ibid., pp. vii \u2013 ix, vi, 208, 218).\n\nIf Africans don't do that, true African Renaissance is impossible. It is traditional Africa which defines who and what we are as a people and as an organic entity because it is the heart and soul, and essence, of our very being, but capable of coexistence with others on the basis of equality without necessarily leading to a higher synthesis of cultures at the expense of individual cultural identities, he contends.\n\nMwakikagile further contends that it is this essence of African-ness which is acknowledged even by some Westernised or brainwashed Africans in rare moments of nostalgia when they say: That is how we lived before the coming of Europeans; that is how our ancestors lived; that is what our ancestors did; not everything was good but they were good old days; our communal and family ties were stronger in those days than they are today; that is how we lived as Africans; that is what it meant to be African - those days are gone.\n\nIt was an essence, of African-ness, that was not contaminated or threatened in its pristine beauty, by foreign influence, because there was no such influence. When they acknowledge this essence, they are invoking the essence of their very being, yet at the same repudiate it when they embrace Westernisation or any other foreign influence and identity because they think it is better than being African, he contends.\n\nHe goes on to argue that Africans can continue to be active members of the global community and benefit from modernisation without losing or compromising their essence as Africans. And that means reclaiming the spirit and values of traditional Africa and its institutions as well as indigenous knowledge to enable them to chart their way forward and navigate in the treacherous waters of globalisation which threatens the integrity and well-being of the continent in terms of identity and personality.\n\nOtherwise we are going to copy everything from other people and become a product of other cultures as if we did not have our own essence and identity before we came into contact with them, he contends.\n\nHe goes on to argue that culture is a vital force and source of life for a nation. A nation without culture has no soul. It has no spiritual identity. And it has no vitality of its own as if it is a lifeless corporeal entity, he contends.\n\nHe also states that by turning against traditional Africa, modernised Africans have lost their soul since it is traditional Africa which is the essence of their very being.\n\n'''Effects of colonial rule'''\n\nMwakikagile also contends that cultural imperialism has had a devastating impact on many Africans in terms of identity, with many of them preferring to be anything else but African because they are ashamed of their \"primitive\" African heritage and Africa's \"backwardness.\" Some of them even proudly profess they have \"forgotten\" their native languages after living abroad, especially in the West, for only a few years; sometimes for only two to three - let alone five or more. They say they can no longer speak [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Kikuyu language|Gikuyu]] and so on.\n\nThey can only speak [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] or some other European language. Many of them don't even know those languages well. Yet they are so proud of speaking them, and with phoney accents just to sound British or American, French, German and so on, because they are not African languages. And there are those who anglicise their African names or spell them in some other European language because it makes them \"sophisticated\" and no longer \"primitive.\" \n\nHe further states that many Africans like to mix English, French or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] - languages of their former colonial masters - with the native languages they speak as a sign of \"sophistication\" and of being \"well-educated,\" a phenomenon which, in East Africa, has led to the evolution of what is known as Kiswanglish, a hybrid of [[Kiswahili]] and English especially in Kenya and Tanzania. He goes on to state that this is especially so among the elite, most of whom are a product of Western education even in local schools in terms of intellectual preparation from the primary school level patterned after the colonial educational systems of Western origin.\n\nMwakikagile also contends that even African countries are described as English-speaking, French-speaking and Portuguese-speaking even though the vast majority of the people in those countries don't even understand let alone speak those languages. Africans themselves describe their countries in terms of being [[Anglophone]], [[Francophone]] and [[Lusophone]] instead of describing them as multi-lingual African-speaking countries since most of the people in those countries speak indigenous languages.\n\nHe goes on to state that many Africans are even proud of being called \"British\" or \"French\" as was the case during colonial rule when many educated Africans in \"Anglophone\" and \"Francophone\" Africa thought it was a very high compliment when their own people and the colonial rulers said to them: \"Oh, you're very British,\" \"You're very French,\" instead of seeing that as insult to them and their African identity. And whey they became leaders and bureaucrats in their own countries after the end of colonial rule, they continued to glorify their former colonial masters and serve the metropolitan powers. They were so brainwashed that they agreed with their former colonial rulers and even themselves believed that there was something wrong with being African.\n\nMwakikagile further states that cultural imperialism also has been very destructive in terms of indigenous knowledge that has been lost through suppression of native languages which are the repository of such knowledge transmitted from one generation to the next. Languages of the conquerors who ruled Africa are still given priority at the expense of native languages even decades after independence.\n\nLittle or nothing is being done to give native languages the status they deserve as vital tools for the preservation and dissemination of indigenous knowledge while, at the same time, continuing to use the languages of the former colonial powers - English, French and Portuguese - out of necessity. It is as if native languages are irrelevant to the well-being of Africans, reinforcing the attitude that nothing good comes out of Africa except minerals and other natural resources. And nothing good, not even indigenous knowledge and institutions, ever came from Africans except labour, especially manual labour.\n\nHe also contends that Western education was intended to de-Africanise Africans, as educated Africans also deliberately attempted to de-Africanise themselves by turning against their own indigenous cultures and traditional ways of life and values - hence against their very being - in order to become \"British,\" \"French,\" and \"Portuguese,\" the colonial powers which ruled Africa. Western education was also intended to alienate them from their own people - the more educated they were, the more de-Africanised they became - and turn them into loyal servants of their conquerors to perpetuate imperial domination of Africa even after the end of colonial rule; a goal that was achieved in most cases as has been demonstrated by the existence of neo-colonial governments in all parts of the continent since independence.\n\nHe says there were only a few exceptions such as Ghana under [[Nkrumah]], Tanzania under Nyerere, and Guinea under Sekou Toure where the leaders made a genuine attempt to achieve true independence. But even in those countries, there were subversive elements within the government and elsewhere in society working with the imperialist powers to undermine the leaders in order to sabotage their efforts to achieve true liberation from foreign domination.\n\nThe colonial rulers never really left Africa; they only changed faces, he contends.\n\nGodfrey Mwakikagile goes on to state that conquest of the mind was the worst form of imperial subjugation, a position he articulates in his works, ''Life under British Colonial Rule: Recollections of an African'' and ''Conquest of the Mind: Imperial subjugation of Africa'' which was published on his birthday in 2019 and its extended version, ''Colonial Mentality and the Destiny of Africa'' published in 2020, in which he examines the negative impact of colonial mentality on Africa's well-being as a continental crisis and how it impedes Africa's progress and the quest for an African renaissance. \n\nHe contends in his books that in many cases, the conquered ended up identifying with their conquerors. They emulated them and even tried to be more British than the British themselves, or more French than the French themselves, and glorified them as if they were the best specimen of mankind in spite of all the suffering and humiliation the colonial rulers inflicted on them.\n\nHe further contends that many Africans even identify themselves with their former colonial masters more than they do with fellow Africans who were ruled by other colonial powers. For example, Malians and Senegalese identify with the French more than they do with Ghanaians and Nigerians who were ruled by the British, further reinforcing the racist notion that Europeans are superior to Africans \u2013 it is better to be a part of them than it is to be a part of fellow Africans.\n\nHe goes on to state that the political and cultural divide between Francophone and Anglophone Africa is evident even in the [[African Union]] (AU) as was the case before in the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). There is rivalry and even mistrust between member countries which were ruled by the two colonial powers: France and Britain. The most tragic case, within a country, is the bloody conflict between [[Anglophone Cameroon]] and [[Francophone Cameroon]] in a nation where the former colonial power, [[France]], still wields enormous power and influence to the detriment of English-speaking Cameroonians of [[Southern Cameroons]] in the southwestern part of the country.\n\nMwakikagile contends that imperial control of Africa is manifested in many other ways, making a mockery of independence Africans are so proud of.\n\nHe also states that one of the tragedies that befell Africa was that to many Africans, their conquerors - European colonialists - not only became their role models; they emulated them in many ways and, by doing so, ended up destroying themselves in terms of their Africanness. He says it was a diminution of African identity and an attack on the African personality that goes on even today.\n\nHe contends all that is a victory for cultural imperialism not only in terms of language, European manners and mannerisms and culture adopted by many Africans but also in terms of ideas propagated by the West.\n\nThat is also the imperial logic, deliberately placing Africans in the sub-human category not only in terms of intellect but also in every other conceivable way.\n\nAnd that was the attitude of some settlers even in Tanganyika, placing Africans in the same category with dogs or other animals, especially monkeys, when Godfrey Mwakikagile was growing up in the fifties. That was the case even after independence in the early sixties, like the white manager of a hotel in the nation's capital Dar es Salaam who had a sign at the entrance of his hotel clearly stating, \"No Africans and dogs allowed inside\", and even refused to let in the mayor simply because the mayor was black.\n\nThere were many incidents of racism in Tanganyika during British colonial rule. In his book ''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'', Mwakikagile wrote about the British settlers he interviewed - then living in different parts of the world - and what they said about life in Tanganyika in those days. One of them stated the following in an interview in 2006:\n\n\"The behaviour of the white settlers towards the Africans was not always as good as it should have been. Mind you, many of the white people were unsettled by the war, totally footloose and earning more money in East Africa than was possible back \u2018home\u2019. Many should not have been given work out there. Too much money and not enough facilities to spend it on....\n\nI remember being shocked to hear one European admit that he treated his dogs better than he treated his African staff. \n\nMany of the Africans looking for work stated very clearly that they would only work either for a priest or a teacher. If work was not available then they would wander off in search of work elsewhere....\n\nWhites and Africans just did not mix. The white population had their meeting places and the Africans likewise. \n\nI was not aware of any Europeans who were opposed to the status quo. Whites and Blacks just did not mix. Except, that is, in Church. The Europeans sat on the left and the Africans sat on the right hand side of the little straw covered church in Nach (Nachingwea). My mother was frequently the pianist at the services....\n\nThe House servants were a vital part of everyday life; but were very firmly kept in place. \n\nI did though, witness one distressing event. An African was walking along a town street (in Nachingwea), minding his own business, when an Alsatian leapt at him from the back of a pick-up truck. The African was shocked and scared witless. He leapt out of the way and into the road. He landed in the path of an oncoming car. The (white) driver of the car only just managed to pull up in time. He leapt out of his vehicle and punched the hapless African in such a way that his jaw was fractured. Dad took it upon himself to ferry the unfortunate man to the local hospital....\n\nThe Europeans had arrived and taken over the best land for themselves. There was an overwhelming feeling that the African 'so newly brought out of barbarism' was incapable of looking after himself without the benevolent eye of the European. For the most part White and African got on. Mainly this was because the African 'knew his place'....\n\nMany Europeans were aware that not enough was being done for the welfare of the Africans, but were unwilling to say so for fear of disturbing their own newly acquired life-style. My father had signed a contract to head a school for Europeans (in Nachingwea). He was not allowed to teach African children. The only Africans who got near the place were those learning to become office workers. They came to what was effectively nightschool....\n\nThe idea of being led by Africans was anathema to a great many Europeans....\n\nBefore we returned for the last time to the UK we were living in Nakuru (Kenya). Dad was in the process of taking over Greensteds School. The positioning of the buildings was perfect,\nabsolutely alongside the Rift Valley.\n\nThe Mau Mau uprising had just started. White settlers living away from civilisation were seen as easy targets. Many Europeans chose to carry guns....\n\nAs children we were taken once a week to a firing range and issued with 5 x 0.22 cartridges and expected to hit a tiny target. This I found immensely difficult. Because of the seriousness of the situation , the school was allocated a detachment of Africans from the \u2018King\u2019s African Rifles\u2019. They patrolled at night.\n\nNothing ever happened that I got to know about, except that the local Police station was raided by the Mau Mau; they stole 30 African Police uniforms and got away without being spotted....\n\nThe general feeling amongst the Europeans was that all this was a little local nuisance and that given time and a few strongarm European tactics, the indigenous population would be subdued. As we all know that situation escalated.\n\nAnother of the silly aspects of the Mau Mau situation was that the colonial ladies took to carrying small pistols and had different coloured holsters to match whatever outfit they were wearing.\" - (Nicholas Edmondson, UK, interviewed by Godfrey Mwakikagile, ''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'', Third Edition, New Africa Press, 2010, pp. 258 - 259, 260 \u2013 263, 264 - 265, 266).\n\nMwakikagile also states that even members of other races, not just whites, have been equally condescending and outright racist towards blacks. They include [[Mahatma Gandhi]] who was not a champion of racial equality yet was revered by a number of African and African American leaders such as [[Kwame Nkrumah]], [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Martin Luther King]] for using non-violent methods of [[civil disobedience]] in the struggle against racial injustices and to fight for India's independence.\n\nWhen he lived in [[South Africa]] for 21 years, Gandhi expressed extreme racist views and described black people as \"raw [[kaffir (racial term)|kaffir]]s\", an extremely offensive term used by racist white South Africans and others which is equivalent to calling black people [[niggers]]. He argued that Indians were \"infinitely superior\" to blacks who were \"savage,\" \"half-heathen natives\" and inferior to other people as well in many ways. He also supported racial segregation to keep blacks away from members of other races. He said unlike blacks, Indians should be on the same level with whites because they were of the same stock; they had the same [[Aryan]] roots.\n\nIn 2016, his statue was removed from the [[University of Ghana]] in [[Accra]] because he did not deserve to be honoured as an icon in the struggle for racial equality and justice when he despised blacks. His statues sparked similar outrage in South Africa.\n\nMwakikagile further states that many Asians - mostly of [[Indian people|Indian]] and [[Pakistani]] origin - and [[Arabs]] in Tanganyika, later Tanzania, also held racist views but did not express them openly in a country where they were far outnumbered by blacks and whose destiny lay in the hands of the black majority.\n\nHe also states that East Africans who were born and brought up during colonial rule had more direct experience with racism than West Africans did because of the larger white population in East Africa with significant settler communities, especially in Kenya, although smaller and fewer in Tanganyika. Many of them had bitter experience with the colonial rulers and the white settlers because of the racial injustices perpetrated against them, including doubts about their intelligence and even common sense expressed by some whites. As he stated in ''Africa and The West'':\n\n\"Colonialism, as a system of oppression and exploitation, not only continued to plunder Africa but sought to instill in the minds of Africans feelings of inferiority to justify such domination...This is just one example \u2013 what Colonel Ewart Grogan, the doyen of the white settlers in colonial Kenya and leader of the Kenya British Empire Party, said about Africans attending the renowned Makerere University College in Uganda:\n\n'Just teaching a lot of stupid monkeys to dress up like Europeans. Won\u2019t do any good. Just cause a lot of discontent. They can never be like us, so better for them not to try.'\n\nAnother (Kenyan) settler in the 'Dark Continent' had this:\n\n'I\u2019ve actually got a farm hand who wears a tie \u2013 but the stupid bastard doesn\u2019t realize you don\u2019t wear a tie without a shirt!'\n\nThe implication is obvious. It is a sweeping indictment against all 'native Africans' as a bunch of idiots.\n\nYet another one, Sir Godfrey Huggins, Prime Minister of [[Southern Rhodesia]], acclaimed as a [[British people|British]] liberal, shot point-blank at a press conference in [[London]]:\n\n'It is time for the people in England to realize that the white man in Africa is not prepared and never will be prepared to accept the African as an equal, either socially or politically. Is there something in their chromosomes which makes them more backward and different from peoples living in the East and West?'\" - (Godfrey Mwakikagile, ibid., pp.&nbsp;9 \u2013 10, 69; [[Colin M. Turnbull]], ''The Lonely African'', New York: Simon and Schuster, 1962, pp.&nbsp;89, 21, 90, 97).\n\nGodfrey Mwakikagile also stated that the total disregard for the rights and well-being of Africans was earlier demonstrated by the arrogance of the imperial powers at the [[Berlin Conference]] in 1885 which led to the [[partition of Africa]]. He went on to state that Africans were not even represented at the conference, yet it was their fate that was being determined by Europeans who decided to partition the continent among themselves as if Africans did not even exist.\n\nHe also stated that this kind of arrogance and contempt for Africans was expressed in its crudest form in many ways including inflicting humiliating punishment on full-grown black men. They were subjected to corporal punishment at the hands of the white settlers who were young enough to be their sons. And shooting blacks was equated with shooting wild animals, as some white settlers in Kenya conceded, including those who had moved there from apartheid South Africa.\n\nArbitrary seizure of land, depriving Africans of their only means of livelihood, was simply seen as a white man's right exercised at will in what had become a white man's possession. In his book ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'', Godfrey Mwakikagile has given one example of this kind of imperial arrogance demonstrated by what happened to [[Tom Mboya]] who, together with [[Oginga Odinga]], was one of the leaders of the Kenyan delegation to the constitutional talks in London in 1960 on Kenyan independence. Mboya stated in his book ''Freedom and After'' that when he was walking on a street in London, one old English lady stopped him and asked him:\n\n\"Which one of our possessions do you come from?\"\n\nThe British settlers in East Africa even wanted to establish a giant federation of Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika, Nyasaland, Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia and turn it into a white dominion. Kenya was even declared a \u201cwhite man's country.\u201d Blacks were nothing. It was a sentiment shared by many white settlers. Ewart Grogan, the most outspoken leader of the white settlers in Kenya, was known for such imperial arrogance, as Godfrey Mwakikagile stated in his book ''Africa and The West'':\n\n\"A man with a flair for controversy and an outspoken racist, Grogan described himself as 'the baddest and boldest of a bold bad gang.' He also gained notoriety for publicly flogging Africans in Nairobi. The settlers from South Africa also came 'with the racial prejudices of that country. Frederick Jackson, Sir Charles Eliot's Deputy Commissioner, told the Foreign Office that the Protectorate was becoming a country of 'nigger-' and game-shooters'...\n\nColonel Ewart Grogan, a leader of the white settlers, bluntly stated: 'We Europeans have to go on ruling this country and rule it with iron discipline...If the whole of the Kikuyu land unit is reverted to the Crown, then every Kikuyu would know that our little queen was a great Bwana.' - (G. Mwakikagile, ibid., pp.&nbsp;97, 113; E. S. Grogan, in the ''East African Standard'', Nairobi, Kenya, 12 November 1910; [[Elspeth Huxley]], ''White Man\u2019s Country'', Vol. I, London and New York: Macmillan, 1935, pp.&nbsp;222 \u2013 223, 261 - 262; [[George Padmore]], ''Pan-Africanism or Communism?: The Coming Struggle for Africa'', London: Denis Dobson, 1956, pp.&nbsp;255, 256).\n\nThe humanity of Africans, and their lives, meant absolutely nothing to many whites, demonstrated by the injustices and indignities black people suffered under colonial rule. African children, even if not the primary target, sometimes witnessed their parents and other adults being humiliated by their colonial masters. It happened in Kenya, and in Tanganyika, Mwakikagile's home country, even when the countries were approaching independence; the fifties being one of the most critical periods in the history of colonial rule in Africa.\n\nSchool children who grew up in the fifties were among the victims in terms racial inequalities. The problem was compounded by inequities in the provision of funds and facilities for education. Meagre resources were allocated to education for African children in sharp contrast with the amount spent on schools for European and Asian children. The school Godfrey Mwakikagile attended was no exception. It was also the dawn of a new era in the history of Tanganyika.\n\nHe stated in his autobiographical works that the fifties which was a decade that preceded independence was a transitional period which symbolised the identity and partly shaped the thinking of those who grew up in those years as a product of both eras, colonial and post-colonial. They also served as a bridge between the two.\n\nGodfrey Mwakikagile also stated in his works, ''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'' and ''Life under British Colonial Rule'' among others, that it was in the same year he was bitten by the white couple's dog on his way to school that [[Princess Margaret]] visited Mbeya and Sao Hill in his home region, the Southern Highlands Province, as well as other parts of the country, in October 1956; a visit that symbolised British imperial rule over Tanganyika but also at a time when the nationalist movement was gaining momentum in the struggle for independence. The party that led the country to independence, [[Tanganyika African National Union]] (TANU), had been formed just two years before, in July 1954, and within months succeeded in mobilising massive support across the country in its quest to end colonial rule. Independence was inevitable.\n\nA few months after Princess Margaret visited Tanganyika, the Gold Coast became the first black African country to emerge from colonial rule as the new nation of Ghana in March 1957, blazing the trail for the African independence movement; while Tanganyika blazed the trail in East Africa four years later.\n\nGodfrey Mwakikagile has written about incidents of racial injustice and other subjects to show how life was in colonial Tanganyika in the fifties from the perspective of colonial subjects who hardly had any rights in their own country ruled and dominated by whites. Africans were lowest in the racial hierarchy, with Asians and Arabs ranked next to whites.\n\nBut in spite of his passionate defence of Africa, past and present, Mwakikagile is highly critical of some [[Afrocentric]] scholars who propagate myths about Africa's past and even reinvent the past just to glorify the continent, claiming spectacular achievements in the precolonial era in some areas where there were hardly any or none; for example, in advanced science, technology, and medicine. They also inflate achievements in some areas. He contends that \"true scholarship requires rigorous intellectual discipline and entails objective enquiry and analysis of facts and evidence including admitting failures and shortcomings.\" Otherwise you lose credibility, he contends. It is a position he forcefully articulates in ''Africa and The West'' and ''Africa is in A Mess: What Went Wrong and What Should be Done'', among other works.\n\nIt is a position that led one renowned Afrocentric Ghanaian political analyst and columnist Francis Kwarteng to describe Godfrey Mwakikagile as a \"Eurocentric Africanist\" in his article \"End of the Dilemma: The Tower of Babel,\" on GhanaWeb, 28 September 2013,  in which he discussed the role and the question of race, religion, and ethnicity in Ghana's politics and, by extension, in a Pan-African context including the [[African diaspora]]; which is a wrong characterisation of Mwakikagile since all his works are written from a purely African, not a [[Eurocentric]], perspective.\n\nIn his article, Francis Kwarteng also cited one of Godfrey Mwakikagile's books, ''Ethnic Politics in Kenya and Nigeria'', in his analysis of the role of ethnicity in national politics in Africa:\n\n\"[[Wole Soyinka]]...rightly admits in ''Of Africa'' that if America, a racist country at that, can elect a person of African ancestry, a black man of Luo ethnicity, president, then, he sees no reason Kenya shouldn't learn from that\u2014that precedent....Soyinka believes Kenya's democratic process must allow enough political space for the accommodation of ethnic diversification, so that qualified minorities can also partake in leadership positions, principally the presidency....But Soyinka's Nigeria has its own fair share of problems, a cornucopia of them. A truism flies across Nigeria's social and political landscape that Hausas are born natural rulers....Yet Nigeria has about 250 ethnic groups. So, what defines the criteria for Nigeria's multiethnic exclusivism from the presidential pie?....This is not unique to Nigeria, however. The same thing happened in Ghana and [[Uganda]], producing the likes of [[Idi Amin]]. This phenomenon is captured in the Eurocentric [[Africa]]nist Godfrey Mwakikagile's ''Ethnic Politics in Kenya and Nigeria''.\"\n\nIn another article on GhanaWeb, 15 October 2013, Francis Kwarteng also stated:\n\n\"We all know how Western material culture and unholy spiritualism are destroying Africa. Corruption in Africa is proliferating like cancerous cells in the body politic. Corrupt African politicians collaborate with Western banking officials to secrete the people's money in Western banks, monies, which, however you look at it, either fortunately for the West or unfortunately for Africa, are reinvested in Western national economies. So, in the long run Africa becomes positively poorer and the West negatively wealthier. Analytically, this runs counter to the central thesis of Rodney's [[How Europe Underdeveloped Africa]]. In fact, it's what the Eurocentric Africanist Godfrey Mwakikagile calls 'Africa in a Mess.' This inverse relationship of economic bilateralism is unhealthy and must be critically addressed by Africa.\"\n\nIt is a case of Africans themselves, especially the leaders, contributing to the underdevelopment of Africa. Bad leadership including corruption in African countries is one of the subjects Mwakikagile has addressed extensively in his books, especially in ''Africa is in A Mess: What Went Wrong and What Should be Done'', ''The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation'', ''Africa After Independence: Realities of Nationhood'', ''Africa at the End of the Twentieth Century: What Lies Ahead'', ''Statecraft and Nation Building in Africa: A Post-colonial Study'', ''Africa in Transition: Witness to Change'', and ''Post-colonial Africa: A General Survey''.\n\nHe contends that bad leadership is the biggest problem most African countries have faced since independence, and everything else revolves around it.\n\nAfricans of all ideological stripes agree corruption is one of the biggest problems African countries face. It is even acknowledged by some leaders. And a number of African scholars including Godfrey Mwakikagile have addressed the problem, proposing solutions to a seemingly intractable problem. As Francis Kwarteng stated in \"A Political Coin of Three Sides: What Do We Actually Want?\", GhanaWeb, 8 November 2013:\n\n\"Today's leadership has failed to show moral and social leadership in the face of mounting national crisis. Indeed corruption threatens the very future of the youth....President Mahama's book ''My First Coup D'\u00e9tat'' must be read in tandem with Wole Soyinka's ''The Open Sore of a Continent'', Ali Mazrui's ''The African Condition: A Political Diagnosis'', Molefi Kete Asante's ''Rooming in the Master's House'', and Godfrey Mwakikagile's ''Africa is in A Mess: What Went Wrong and What Should Be Done'' and ''Africa After Independence: Realities of Nationhood''. In fact, these bibliographies must be included in every secondary school curriculum as well as the curricula of teacher training institutions across the country. We may then use them as bibliographical platforms to ask students to come up with comprehensive solutions to our myriad national problems.\"\n\nAs he stated in another article, \"Africa Must Practice Its Own Democracy: A Moral Necessity,\" GhanaWeb, 17 October 2013:\n\n\"We were not the first to raise this question; others had before us! Celebrated prescient leaders like Kwame Nkrumah made this philosophical mantra part of their political platform, so were others \u2015 Patrice Lumumba, Amilcar Cabral, etc. Literacy scholars like Chinua Achebe, and [[Ngugi wa Thiong'o]]; international economists like [[Dambisa Moyo]] and Yaw Nyarko; political scientists like Ali Mazrui, Godfrey Mwakikagile, and [[Mahmood Mamdani]]; legal experts like Shadrack Gutto and Randall Robinson; world-renowned anthropologists and linguists like Cheikh Anta Diop and Th\u00e9ophile Obenga; and Afrocentrists like Molefi Kete Asante, Chinweizu, Maulana Karenga, and Ama Mazama had made similar arguments in the past few decades\u2015via their prolific scholarship, organizations, and political activism.\"\n\nOne of the problems Africa faces in nation building is how to achieve unity in diversity in countries composed of different ethnic groups and threatened by ethno-regional loyalties and rivalries. It is one of the subjects Godfrey Mwakikagile has addressed in his books.\n\n<!--One of the problems Africa faces in nation building and which African leaders have not adequately addressed is how to achieve unity in diversity in countries composed of different ethnic groups and threatened by ethno-regional loyalties and rivalries. It is one of the subjects Godfrey Mwakikagile has addressed in his books.-->Mwakikagile has written extensively about ethnicity and politics in Africa in the post-colonial era and how the two phenomena are inextricably linked in the African political context. He has used case studies in different analyses of the subject in different parts of the continent. One of his works, ''Ethnicity and National Identity in Uganda'', has been described by Tierney Tully as \"a great book, but very dense.\"\n\nMwakikagile's other books on the subject include ''Identity Politics and Ethnic Conflicts in Rwanda and Burundi: A Comparative Study''; ''Burundi: The Hutu and The Tutsi: Cauldron of Conflict and Quest for Dynamic Compromise''; ''Civil Wars in Rwanda and Burundi: Conflict Resolution in Africa''; ''Ethnic Diversity and Integration in The Gambia''; ''The People of Ghana: Ethnic Diversity and National Unity'', and ''Belize and Its Identity: A Multicultural Perspective'', re-published as ''British Honduras to Belize: Transformation of a Nation'',  a scholarly work on the Central American nation founded by the British colonial rulers and African slaves as [[British Honduras]] and which, culturally and historically, is considered to be an integral part of the [[Afro-Caribbean]] region, hence of the African diaspora. Although written by an African, the book is an important part of Afro-Caribbean literature.\n\nOne American journalist who interviewed Godfrey Mwakikagile described him as an independent scholar who was also a widely read and highly regarded author. Mwakikagile responded by saying that he was just an ordinary African, like tens of millions of others, deeply concerned about the plight of his continent. <!--But there is no question that he is a serious writer whose writings are widely read even if he considers himself to be just an ordinary African like millions of his brethren across the continent and elsewhere.-->\n\nIn his book ''African Political Thought'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012), Professor Guy Martin has described Godfrey Mwakikagile as one of Africa's leading populist scholars and thinkers who refuse to operate and function within the limits and confines of Western ideologies \u2013 or any other external parameters \u2013 and who exhort fellow Africans to find solutions to African problems within Africa itself and fight the syndrome of dependency in all areas and create a \"new African.\"\n\nProfessor Martin examines the political thought of leading African political thinkers throughout history dating back to ancient times (Kush/Nubia, sixth century BCE) and systematically introduces the reader to the ideas of specific theorists and their biographies. The thinkers and theorists he has examined include Julius Nyerere, [[Am\u00edlcar Cabral]], [[Kwame Nkrumah]], [[Cheikh Anta Diop]], [[Steve Biko]], [[Claude Ake]], and Godfrey Mwakikagile.\n\nProfessor Edmond J. Keller, chairman of the political science department, director of the UCLA Globalization Research Center-Africa and former director of the James S. Coleman African Studies Center at the University of California-Los Angeles, described Godfrey Mwakikagile as a \"public intellectual\" and an \"academic theorist\" in his review of Professor Guy Martin's book, ''African Political Thought''. The review was published in one of the leading academic journals on African research and studies, ''Africa Today'', Volume 60, Number 2, Winter 2013, Indiana University Press.\n\nProfessor Ryan Ronnenberg who wrote an article about Godfrey Mwakikagile as a prominent African scholar and writer in the ''Dictionary of African Biography'', ''Volume 6'' (Oxford University Press, 2011) covering the lives and legacies of notable African men and women since ancient times, edited by Harvard University professors, Emmanuel K. Akyeampong and Henry Louis Gates, Jr., stated that Mwakikagile has written major works of scholarship which have had a great impact in the area of African studies and continue to do so. He went on to state that Mwakikagile embraced Tanzania's independence, and the independence of the African continent as a whole, with fierce pride. 'I was too young to play a role in the independence movement, but old enough to know what Mau Mau in neighbouring Kenya was all about, and who our leaders were: from Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana to Julius Nyerere in Tanganyika; from Nnamdi Azikiwe in Nigeria to Jomo Kenyatta in Kenya and Patrice Lumumba in Belgian Congo' (''Africa and the West'', 2000).\n\nHis experience also inspired his thinking regarding Africa and its relationship to the Western world, which led to several academic works dedicated to the subject. Professor Ronnenberg further stated that Mwakikagile's early works focused on pressing issues in African studies, particularly the theory and realisation of development in Africa. ''Economic Development in Africa'' (1999) uses the rich case study of Tanzania's [[transition economy|transition from socialism to free-market capitalism]] as a foundation for broader conclusions concerning the continent's development failures.\n\nProfessor Ronnenberg also stated that Mwakikagile writes about Africa as a whole in such a way as to suggest that he possesses not only a keen understanding of the way things are, but also a deep understanding of the way they should be. The acerbically titled ''Africa Is in a Mess: What Went Wrong and What Should Be Done'' reflects on the decades since independence with pragmatism and regret, observing the loss of both leadership and ingenuity as the continent's intellectual elite settle abroad, while suggesting how this process might be reversed.\n \nIn fact, as the years have passed, and as those early optimistic moments after independence have slipped away, Mwakikagile has taken it upon himself to write about why Africa has fallen short of its vision. Professor Ronnenberg went on to state that Mwakikagile has translated his experience as a youth in colonial East Africa and his adulthood in postcolonial Tanzania into provocative scholarship concerning topics vitally important to African studies.\n\nMwakikagile's books are used in various academic disciplines up to the post-graduate level including doctoral studies. He has also been invited to give lectures at different colleges and universities. And as a public intellectual, he has also been sought for interviews by [[BBC]], [[PBS]] and [[Voice of America]] ([[VOA]]), among other media outlets.\n\nAlthough he has been exposed to Western cultures, was educated in the Western intellectual tradition and lived in the United States for many years, Mwakikagile's perspectives and philosophical conceptions have undoubtedly been shaped by his African upbringing and are deeply rooted in African cultures and traditions. And he rejects the notion that Africa was a blank slate until Europeans came to write on it. He argues that the history written about Africa by Europeans when they first went to Africa and even during colonial rule as well as after independence is not African history but the history of Europeans in Africa and how they see Africa and Africans from their European perspective.\n\nHe also contends that traditional Africa has produced philosophers and other original thinkers whose knowledge and ideas \u2013 including ideas at a high level of abstraction \u2013 can match and even surpass the best in the West and elsewhere in the world. He forcefully articulates that position in his book, ''Africa and The West''.<ref>Godfrey Mwakikagile, ''Africa and The West'', {{ISBN|9781560728405}}, Huntington, New York, 2001, pp.&nbsp;1\u201346, and 201\u2013218.</ref>\n\nAnd although he sees Africa as an indivisible whole, he argues that all nations, including those in Africa, have different national characters. He looks at the concept of national character in the African context in his book ''Kenya: Identity of A Nation'', and makes a compelling case for this idea, which is sometimes highly controversial. The work is, among other subjects, a study of comparative analysis in which the author looks at the national characters of Kenya and Tanzania<!--, thus demonstrating that nations do indeed have different national characters and have been that way throughout history-->. Kenyans themselves have had to grapple with questions of identity, ethnic versus national, and how to reconcile the two for the sake of national unity, peace and prosperity.\n\nTanzania is one of the few countries on the continent to have been spared the agony and scourge of ethnic conflicts, unlike Kenya which Mwakikagile has used for comparative analysis in looking at the identities of the two neighbouring countries. In his books, including ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'', he has also explained how Tanzania has been able to contain and even neutralise tribalism unlike other countries on the continent.\n\nMwakikagile has written extensively about tribalism, contending that it is one of the biggest problems Africa faces and is the source of instability in many countries on the continent, including civil wars.<!--\n\nHe undoubtedly has strong convictions but does not neatly fit into any ideological category.-->He expresses strong [[Pan-Africanist]] views in his writings and sees Africa as a collective entity and one organic body and has strongly been influenced by staunch Pan-Africanist leaders such as [[Kwame Nkrumah]], [[Julius Nyerere]], [[Ahmed Sekou Toure]] and [[Patrice Lumumba]] whom he also strongly admires.<ref>Godfrey Mwakikagile, ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'', 5th Edition, 2010. For Mwakikagile's Pan-Africanist views and perspectives, see also Professor Eric Edi of Temple University, \"Pan-West Africanism and Political Instability: Perspectives and Reflections,\" which cites Mwakikagile's books ''Military Coups in West Africa Since The Sixties'' and ''The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation''.</ref>\n\nHe also strongly admires [[Thomas Sankara]] as a man of the people like Nyerere and contends that among the new breed of African leaders, Sankara showed great promise but was eliminated by some of his so-called compatriots working for France and other Western powers before he could realise his full potential the same way Lumumba was, eliminated by the United States and Belgium. Mwakikagile has written about Sankara in ''Military Coups in West Africa Since The Sixties'' and in ''African Countries'' among other works.\n\nBut some of his critics contend that he overlooks or glosses over the shortcomings of these leaders precisely because they are liberation icons and played a leading role in the struggle for independence and against [[white minority rule]] in Southern Africa.<ref>Kwesi Johnson-Taylor, \"Author, a shrewd intellectual in defence of liberation icons,\" review of ''Nyerere and Africa'', amazon.com, 21 February 2006.</ref>\n\nHe also seems to be \"trapped\" in the past, in liberation days, especially in the 1970s when the struggle against white minority rule was most intense. But that may be for understandable reasons.<ref>''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era''.</ref> He was a part of that generation when the liberation struggle was going on and some of his views have unquestionably been shaped by what happened during those days as his admiration for [[Robert Mugabe]], for example, as a liberation icon clearly shows; although he also admits in ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'' that the land reform programme in [[Zimbabwe]] could have been implemented in an orderly fashion and in a peaceful way and without disrupting the economy.\n\nBut his admiration for Mugabe as a true [[African nationalist]] and Pan-Africanist remains intact, a position that does not sit well with some of his critics although he does not condone despotic rule. He admires Mugabe mostly as a [[freedom fighter]] and liberation hero who freed his people from [[colonial rule]] and racial oppression and exploitation, and as a strong leader who has taken a firm and an uncompromising stand against Western domination of Africa.\n \nBy remarkable contrast, his contempt for African leaders whom he sees as whites with a black skin also remains intact. He mentions Dr. [[Hastings Kamuzu Banda]] as a typical example of those leaders.

The OAU chose Tanzania to be the headquarters of the African liberation movements under the auspices of the OAU Liberation Committee which was based in Tanzania's capital Dar es Salaam.</ref>\n\n==Newspaper background==\nIn those days, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, was the headquarters of all the African liberation movements, under the leadership of President Julius Nyerere, and Mwakikagile got the chance to know many of the freedom fighters who were based there when he worked as a young news reporter in the nation's capital.<ref>''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'', pp.&nbsp;92\u201393. See also ''Nyerere and Africa'', pp.&nbsp;10\u201312, 65, 314, 363, 375, 484.</ref> They included Joaquim Chissano, who was the head of the [[FRELIMO]] office in Dar es Salaam, and later became the minister of foreign affairs and then president of Mozambique when his country won independence after 500 years of Portuguese colonial rule.<ref>''Nyerere and Africa'', pp.&nbsp;224, 487\u2013488; \"Newsman Leaves for America,\" ''Daily News'', 7 November 1972, p.&nbsp;3.</ref>\n\n<!--Many other freedom fighters who were based in Dar es Salaam also went on to become national leaders in their respective countries after the end of white minority rule in Southern Africa, and they all still have strong ties to Tanzania even today.-->\nIn his seminal work ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'', he has written extensively about the liberation struggle, and the liberation movements in Southern Africa in what is probably one of the best accounts of that critical phase in the history of Africa, as well as an excellent analysis of the [[Congo Crisis]] during the turbulent 1960s.\n\nMwakikagile has also written a book entitled ''South Africa in Contemporary Times'' (2008) about the struggle against apartheid and the end of white minority rule in South Africa and on the prospects and challenges the country faces in the post-apartheid era.\n\nThe years he spent on the editorial staff at the ''Standard'' and the ''Daily News'' were critical to his future career as a writer. Those were his formative years, and had he not become a news reporter, his life, and his career as an author, might have taken a different turn.\n\nAs he states in ''Nyerere and Africa'', he was first hired by renowned British journalist David Martin who was the deputy managing and news editor of the Tanganyika ''Standard''. The managing editor was Brendon Grimshaw, also British who, in the 1970s, bought Moyenne Island in the Seychelles and became its only permanent inhabitant. Brendon Grimshaw also played a major role in recruiting Mwakikagile as a member of the editorial staff at the ''Standard''.<ref>''Nyerere and Africa'', pp.&nbsp;360, 486. See also, \"Brendon Grimshaw Dead,\" ''Seychelles Nation'', Victoria, Seychelles, Thursday, 7 July 2012; \"Brendon Grimshaw is dead,\" ''Daily News'', Dar es Salaam, 7 July 2012.</ref>\n\nIt was a turning point in Mwakikagile's life. That was in June 1969 when he was a student at Tambaza High School in Dar es Salaam. He was 19 years old and probably the youngest reporter on the editorial staff at the ''Standard'' during that time.\n\nThe ''Standard'', the largest English newspaper in Tanzania and one of the largest and most influential in East Africa, served Mwakikagile well, not only in terms of providing him with an opportunity to sharpen his writing skills but also \u2013 after it became the ''Daily News'' in 1970 \u2013 in helping him to attend school in the United States, where he became an author many years after he graduated from college.\n\nDavid Martin, when he worked at the Tanganyika ''Standard'' and at the ''Daily News'', and thereafter, was the most prominent foreign journalist in Eastern and Southern Africa in the 1960s and '70s, and wrote extensively about the liberation struggle in the region for the London ''[[The Observer|Observer]]'' and the [[BBC]]. In ''Nyerere and Africa'', Mwakikagile has written about the role Martin played as a journalist during the liberation struggle in Southern Africa. But Martin was also instrumental in opening the door for Mwakikagile into the world of journalism, writing every day, after which both became successful writers.<ref>''Nyerere and Africa'', pp.&nbsp;486, 500, 569; ''My Life as an African: Autobiographical Writings'', pp.&nbsp;89, 156, 176, 375\u2013376, 378.</ref>\n\nAs Mwakikagile has stated in his books, including ''Nyerere and Africa'', ''Africa after Independence: Realities of Nationhood'', ''The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation'', ''Military Coups in West Africa Since The Sixties'' and in ''Africa is in A Mess: What Went Wrong and What Should Be Done'', his background as a news reporter, which included meeting deadlines when writing news articles, prepared him for the rigorous task of writing books.<!-- information repeated in Bibliography<ref>''Nyerere and Africa''; Godfrey Mwakikagile, ''Africa after Independence: Realities of Nationhood'', ISBN 9789987160143, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: New Africa Press, 2006; ''The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation'', ISBN 9781560729365, Huntington, NY: [[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]], 2001; ''Military Coups in West Africa Since The Sixties'', ISBN 9781560729457, Huntington, NY: Nova Science Publishers, Inc., 2001; ''Africa is in A Mess: What Went Wrong and What Should Be Done'', ISBN 0980253470, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: New Africa Press, 2006.</ref>-->\n\n==Criticism of post-colonial Africa==\n\nMwakikagile grew up under the leadership of [[Tanzanian President]] [[Julius Nyerere]], a staunch [[Pan-Africanist]] and one of the most influential leaders Africa has produced. In his writings, Mwakikagile has defended his socialist policies because of the egalitarian ideals they instilled in Tanzanians, despite the poverty they endured under [[ujamaa]], Nyerere's African version of socialism.\n\nMwakikagile, however, has been highly critical in his writings of other African leaders from the same generation who led their countries to independence. He has contended that most of them did not care about the well-being of their people.<ref>''Africa is in A Mess: What Went Wrong and What Should Be Done'', 2006; ''Africa After Independence: Realities of Nationhood'', {{ISBN|9789987160143}}, New Africa Press, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, 2006; ''The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation'', {{ISBN|9781560729365}}, [[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]], Huntington, New York, 2001; ''Military Coups in West Africa Since the Sixties'', {{ISBN|9781560729457}}, Huntington, New York, 2001; ''Military Coups in West Africa Since the Sixties'', 2001.

He even wrote a book, ''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'', about those years.\n\nIndependence from Britain was very important to Mwakikagile. When he was 12 years old, his uncle took him to [[Tukuyu]] to participate in the independence celebrations when Tanganyika attained sovereign status under Nyerere. He witnessed the flags changing at midnight when the Union Jack was lowered and the flag of the newly independent Tanganyika went up. His recollections are stated in his book, ''My Life as an African: Autobiographical Writings''.\n\nEarly in his life when he was a teenager, he developed strong Pan-Africanist views under the influence of Nyerere and other Pan-Africanist leaders such as [[Kwame Nkrumah]] and [[Ahmed Sekou Toure]]. He still holds those views today, crystallised into an ideology for a new African liberation and forcefully articulated in his writings.\n\nAs Professor Guy Martin states in his book ''African Political Thought'' (pp.&nbsp;8, 6) about Mwakikagile and other Pan-Africanist theorists and thinkers, their individual national identities are secondary to their primary identity as Africans and even irrelevant when they articulate their position from a Pan-African perspective: \"Note that all these scholars are dedicated Pan-Africanists and many would shun the reference to their nationality, preferring to be simply called 'Africans'.... Some of the most prominent Africanist-populist scholars include... Godfrey Mwakikagile....\"\n\nOne of Mwakikagile's critics has described him as \"a shrewd intellectual in defence of liberation icons\" and accuses him of not being intellectually honest about leaders such as [[Nyerere]], Nkrumah and Sekou Toure for not criticising them harshly for their failures because he admires them so much as staunch Pan-Africanists.<ref>Kwesi Johnson-Taylor, \"Author, a shrewd intellectual in defence of liberation icons,\" in his review of Mwakikagile's book, ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'', on amazon.com, 21 February 2006.</ref><!--\n\nIn a way, some people may see him as a complex character not always easy to understand, although he articulates his position clearly and forcefully.-->Some of the confusion among his readers about his position on African leaders of the independence generation has to do with his own background since he was an integral part of that generation in the sense that he witnessed the end of colonial rule and the emergence of the newly independent African states although he was not old enough to have participated in the independence struggle.<ref>''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'', pp.&nbsp;7\u20138.</ref>\n\nHe admires the leaders who led their countries to independence, yet he is highly critical of them in most cases for their failures during the post-colonial period. He became disillusioned with the leadership on the continent through the years, filled with broken promises, and not long after the countries won independence. He admires many aspects of Nyerere's socialist policies in Tanzania, yet concedes the policies were also a failure in many cases. And he strongly favours fundamental change in African countries, yet he is nostalgic about the past.<ref>''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'', pp.&nbsp;31 \u2013 32. See also ''Africa is in A Mess'' and ''Africa and The West''.</ref>\n\nHis advocacy for fundamental change is articulated in many of his writings including ''The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation'', which was published in 2001 and which is also one of his most well-known books.\n\nIn his review of the book, Ronald Taylor-Lewis [born of a Sierra Leonean father], editor of ''Mano Vision'' magazine, London, described it as \"a masterpiece of fact and analysis.\"<ref>Ronald Taylor-Lewis, in his review of Godfrey Mwakikagile, ''The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation'', in ''Mano Vision'', London, Issue 23, October 2001, pp.&nbsp;34\u201335. See also Professor Catherine S. M. Duggan, Department of Political Science, Stanford University, in her paper, \"Do Different Coups Have Different Implications for Investment? Some Intuitions and A Test With A New Set of Data,\" in which she cites Mwakikagile on fundamental changes in African countries. See also Godfrey Mwakikagile, cited in Christopher E. Miller, ''A Glossary of Terms and Concepts in Peace and Conflict Studies'', p.&nbsp;87; and in Gabi Hesselbein, Frederick Golooba-Mutebi, and James Putzel, \"Economic and Political Foundations of State-Making in Africa: Understanding State Reconstruction,\" ''Working Paper No. 3'', 2006.</ref>\n\nThe book has also been reviewed in other publications. Tana Worku Anglana reviewed Godfrey Mwakikagile's ''Modern African State: Quest for Transformation'' in ''Articolo'' and described it as \"unbiased literature.\"<ref>''The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation''; Wole Soyinka, ''The Open Sore of a Continent: A Personal Narrative of The Nigerian Crisis'', {{ISBN|9780195119213}}, Oxford University Press, 1997; Chinua Achebe, ''The Trouble with Nigeria'', {{ISBN|9789781561474}}, Enugu, Nigeria: Fourth Dimension Publishing Co., 2000.</ref>\n\nEthnic conflicts in [[Rwanda]] and Burundi between the [[Hutu]] and the [[Tutsi]] is one of the subjects Mwakikagile has addressed extensively in his book ''The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation''.\n\nIn many of his writings, Mwakikagile focuses on internal factors \u2013 including corruption, [[tribalism]] and tyranny \u2013 as the main cause of Africa's predicament, but not to the total exclusion of external forces.\n\nThe union of Tanganyika and Zanzibar and the Zanzibar revolution are subjects Mwakikagile has also addressed in detail in two of his other books: ''Why Tanganyika united with Zanzibar to form Tanzania'' and ''Africa in The Sixties''.\n\nAnd his diagnosis of \u2013 and prescription for \u2013 Africa's ailments has also been cited by scholars and other people for its relevance in other parts of the Third World. As Dr. Hengene Payani, a political scientist at the University of Papua New Guinea in [[Port Moresby]], [[Papua New Guinea]], stated in his review of Mwakikagile's book ''Africa is in A Mess'' on amazon.com, \"the book is excellent, honest and thought-provoking and is relevant even in the context of Papua New Guinea, a country which has been ruined by greedy politicians.\"<!-- He also contacted Mwakikagile to congratulate him for his work.-->\n\nAlthough he has written mostly about Africa, and as a political scientist or as a political analyst, his works cover a wide range of scholarship including American studies.\n\nBut there are limitations to the role played by people such as Godfrey Mwakikagile in their quest for fundamental change in African countries. Their contribution is limited in one fundamental respect: They are not actively involved with the masses at the grassroots level precisely because of what they are. They belong to an elite class, and the concepts they expound as well as the solutions they propose are discussed mainly by fellow elites but rarely implemented.\n\nAfrican writers such as Mwakikagile and other intellectuals are also severely compromised in their mission because most African leaders don't want to change. Therefore, they don't listen to them\u2014in many cases the entire state apparatus needs to be dismantled to bring about meaningful change.<ref>See also Ismail Rashid, a Sierra Leonian in exile in Canada, in the ''New African'', London, May 1992, p.&nbsp;10; Rashid Ismail in G.

R. Latigo, ''The Best Options for Africa: 11 Political, Economic and Divine Principles'', {{ISBN|9781426907678}}, Trafford Publishing, Victoria, BC, Canada, 2010, pp.&nbsp;114\u2013115; Senyo B-S.K.

But it is not the kind of effect that reverberates across the spectrum all the way down to the grassroots level precisely because they are not an integral part of the masses, and also because they are not actively involved with the masses to transform society.\n\nSo, while they generate ideas, they have not been able to effectively transmit those ideas to the masses without whose involvement fundamental change in Africa is impossible, except at the top, recycling the elite. And while they identify with the masses in terms of suffering and as fellow Africans, many of them \u2013 not all but many of them \u2013 have not and still do not make enough sacrifices in their quest for social and political transformation of African countries. Mwakikagile is fully aware of these shortcomings, and apparent contradictions, in the role played by the African elite. He's one himself.\n\nYet, he has not explicitly stated so in his writings concerning this problem of African intellectuals; a dilemma similar to the one faced by the black intelligentsia in the United States and which was addressed by [[Harold Cruse]], an internationally renowned black American professor who taught at the [[University of Michigan]] for many years, in his monumental study, ''The Crisis of The Negro Intellectual''. The book was first published in 1967 at the peak of the [[civil rights movement]], five years before Godfrey Mwakikagile went to the United States for the first time as a student.\n\nBut that does not really explain why he has not fully addressed the subject, the dilemma African intellectuals face in their quest for fundamental change, especially in his books \u2013 ''The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation'', ''Africa is in A Mess: What Went Wrong and What Should Done'', and ''Africa After Independence: Realities of Nationhood'' \u2013 which are almost exclusively devoted to such transformation in Africa in the post-colonial era.\n\nStill, Mwakikagile belongs to a group of African writers and the African elite who believe that the primary responsibility of transforming Africa lies in the hands of the Africans themselves, and not foreigners, and that acknowledgement of mistakes by African leaders is one of the first steps towards bringing about much-needed change in African countries; a position he forcefully articulates in his writings. For example, Political Science Professor Claude E. Welch at the State University of New York-Buffalo, in his review of one of Mwakikagile's books \u2013 ''Military Coups in West Africa Since The Sixties'' \u2013 published in the ''African Studies Review'' (Vol. 45, No. 3, December 2002, p.&nbsp;114), described the author as being merciless in his condemnation of African tyrants.<!--And that is valid criticism of African leadership in post-colonial Africa by Godfrey Mwakikagile. Corrupt and despotic rulers don't deserve mercy. They don't deserve sympathy. They are not entitled to it. They have destroyed Africa.-->\n\n== Vision for an African Federal Government ==\nMwakikagile advocates for a closer union within Africa in the form of an African confederation or African federal government starting with economic integration, leading to an African common market, and eventually, resulting in a political union. Concretely, he proposed the following plan for a Union of African states: \"If the future of Africa lies in federation, that federation could even be a giant federation of numerous autonomous units which have replaced the modern African state in order to build, on a continental or sub-continental scale, a common market, establish a common currency, a common defense and maybe even pursue a common foreign policy under some kind of central authority - including collective leadership on rotational basis - which Africans think is best for them\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Modern_African_State.html?id=zw6PgwJVaMwC|title=The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation|last=Mwakikagile|first=Godfrey|date=2001-01-01|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=9781560729365|language=en}}</ref>\n\nMwakikagile identifies the type of government best suited for the African situation as a ''democracy by consensus,'' which, in his view, would allow all social, ethnic and regional factions to freely express themselves. Such a democracy should take the form of a government of national unity, inclusive of both the winners and the losers in the electoral process, and would entail a multiparty system approved by national referendum; it should also be based on extreme decentralization down to the lowest grassroots level to enable the masses, not just the leaders and the elite, to participate in formulating policies and making decisions which affect their lives. That is the only way it can be a people's government and federation that belongs to the masses and ordinary citizens instead of being a government and federation of only the elite and professional politicians. Let the people decide. He has elaborated on that in his other books, ''Africa at the End of the Twentieth Century: What Lies Ahead'' and ''Restructuring The African State and Quest for Regional Integration: New Approaches''.\n\nHe also believes that in this democratic system the tenure of the president must be limited to one term (preferably five to six years), and the tenure of the members of the national legislatures to two three-year terms.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/African_Political_Thought.html?id=rqYEhtONIBgC|title=African Political Thought|last=Martin|first=G.|date=2012-12-23|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137062055|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nIn what is probably his most controversial book, ''Africa is in A Mess: What Went Wrong and What Should Be Done'', Mwakikagile strongly criticises most of the leaders of post-colonial Africa for tyranny and corruption, and for practising tribalism, a common theme in the works of many African writers and other people including well-known ones and many African scholars in and outside Africa. But his book stands out as one of the most blunt ever written about Africa's rotten leadership.\n\nUnfortunately, because of its vitriolic condemnation of most African leaders during the post-colonial era, the book has been cited by some people as a clarion call for the re-colonisation of Africa although the author says exactly the opposite in his work.<ref>Dr. Kenday Samuel Kamara of Walden University in his abstract \"Considering the Enormity of Africa's Problems, is Re-Colonization an Option?\" cites ''Africa is in A Mess: What Went Wrong and What Should Be Done'' and related works by other African leading academic authors, including Professor Ali Mazrui, and Professor George Ayittey's ''Africa in Chaos''. See also Tunde Obadina, \"The Myth of Neo-Colonialism,\" in ''Africa Economic Analysis'', 2000; and Timothy Murithi, ''The African Union: Pan-Africanism, Peacebuilding and Development''.</ref>\n\nYet in spite of all that, Mwakikagile unequivocally states in ''Africa is in A Mess'' that he does not support any attempt or scheme, by anybody, to recolonise Africa, but also bluntly states that African countries have lost their sovereignty to donor nations and multilateral institutions such as the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) dominated by Western powers including those who once colonised Africa and are therefore virtual colonies already.\n\nThe premier of Western Cape Province in South Africa, [[Helen Zille]], in her speech in the provincial parliament on 28 March 2017, also cited Godfrey Mwakikagile's analysis of the impact of colonial rule on Africa in defence of her tweets which her critics said were a defence of colonialism and even called for her resignation. She said her analysis was the same as Mwakikagile's and those of other prominent people including Nelson Mandela, Chinua Achebe, Ali Mazrui, and former Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and wondered why she faced so much criticism when she made exactly the same point they did.\n\nMwakikagile also contends that African countries have really never been free in spite of the instruments of sovereignty they are supposed to have. He also warns about the dangers of the Second Scramble for Africa by the industrialised nations which are busy exploiting Africa's resources for their own benefit and contends that globalisation is in many ways a new form of imperialism.\n\nYet he has wrongly been portrayed, along with some prominent African and European scholars including Professor [[Ali Mazrui]], [[Christoph Blocher]], [[Mahmood Mamdani]], Peter Niggli, and R. W. Johnson, as someone who advocates the recolonisation of Africa.<ref>Professor Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gatsheni, a Zimbambwean teaching international studies at Monash University, South Africa campus, in his abstract \"Gods of Development, Demons of Underdevelopment and Western Salvation: A Critique of Development Discourse as a Sequel to the CODESRIA and OSSREA International Conferences on Development in Africa\" (June 2006), advances the same argument as Mwakikagile and cites ''Africa is in A Mess'' to support his thesis. See also Floyd Shivambu, \"Floyd's Perspectives: Societal Tribalism in South Africa,\" 1 September 2005, who cites Mwakikagile's ''Ethnic Politics in Kenya and Nigeria'', in his condemnation of tribalism in post-apartheid South Africa; Mary Elizabeth Flournoy of Agnes Scott College, in her paper \"Nigeria: Bounded by Ropes of Oil,\" citing Mwakikagile's writings, including ''Ethnic Politics in Kenya and Nigeria''; Professor Eric Edi of Temple University, in his paper, \"Pan West Africanism and Political Instability: Perspectives and Reflections,\" citing Mwakikagile's books ''Military Coups in West Africa Since The Sixties'' and ''The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation''.</ref>\n\nMwakikagile says exactly the opposite in ''Africa is in A Mess''. In fact, the title, although not the sub-title, comes from President Julius Nyerere who used exactly the same words in 1985: \"Africa is in a mess.\" Mwakikagile explicitly states that he got the title from Nyerere's statement and felt it was appropriate for his work, although the tone and content might be disturbing to some people. He is brutally frank about the continent's deplorable condition.\n\nAnd in the same book, Mwakikagile is also highly critical of Western powers for ruthlessly exploiting Africa even today in collusion with many African leaders.\n\nHis harsh criticism of bad leadership on the African continent prompted Ghanaian columnist and political analyst Francis Kwarteng to put him in the same category with George Ayittey, a Ghanaian professor of economics at The American University, Washington, D.C., and author of ''Africa Betrayed'' and ''Africa in Chaos'', among other books.\n\n==Academic reviews==\nMwakikagile's books have been reviewed in a number of academic publications, including the highly prestigious academic journal ''African Studies Review'', by leading scholars in their fields. They include ''Military Coups in West Africa Since The Sixties'', which was reviewed in that journal by Professor Claude E. Welch of the Department of Political Science at the State University of New York, Buffalo; and ''Ethnic Politics in Kenya and Nigeria'', reviewed by Nigerian Professor Khadijat K.

Rashid of Gallaudet University, Washington, D.C. in ''African Studies Review'', Vol. 46, No. 2, September 2003, pp.&nbsp;92 \u2013 98.</ref>\n\nOther books by Mwakikagile have also been reviewed in the ''African Studies Review'' and in the ''Journal of Contemporary African Studies'', including ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'' and ''The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation'' which were reviewed in the ''African Studies Review''. ''Nyerere and Africa'' was also reviewed in the ''Journal of Contemporary African Studies''.\n\nHis book, ''Western Involvement in Nkrumah's Downfall'', was reviewed by Professor E. Ofori Bekoe,  in ''Africa Today'', an academic journal published by Indiana University Press.\n\nMwakikagile has also written about race relations in the United States and relations between continental Africans and people of African descent in the diaspora in his titles such as ''Black Conservatives in The United States''; ''Relations Between Africans and African Americans''; and ''Relations Between Africans, African Americans and Afro-Caribbeans''. Professor Kwame Essien of Gettysburg College, later Lehigh University, a Ghanaian, reviewed ''Relations Between Africans and African Americans: Misconceptions, Myths and Realities'', in ''Souls: A Critical Journal of Black Politics, Culture, and Society, Volume 13, Issue 2, 2011'', an academic journal of Columbia University, New York, and described it as an \"insightful and voluminous\" work covering a wide range of subjects from a historical and contemporary perspective, addressing some of the most controversial issues in relations between the two. It is also one of the most important books on the subject of relations between Africans and African Americans.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n\n*''Economic Development in

He was also a news reporter for the ''Standard'' (later renamed the [[Daily News (Tanzania)|Daily News]]) \u2014 the oldest and largest English newspaper in Tanzania and one of the three largest in [[East Africa]].<ref name=\"Stan\" />\n\nMwakikagile came to prominence after he wrote ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'' \u2014 a major biographical book on the life of former Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]] set in the backdrop of Africa's early post-colonial years and the liberation wars in the countries of southern Africa in which Nyerere played a major role.\n\nGrowing up in the 1950s, Mwakikagile experienced a form of [[apartheid]] and [[racial segregation]] in [[Tanganyika]], what is now mainland Tanzania, and wrote extensively about it in some of his works, as he did about the political climate of Tanganyika during the colonial era.<ref name=\"Kyoso\">Kyoso, David E., ''Godfrey Mwakikagile: Biography of an Africanist'', Intercontinental Books (2017), pp. 7 -12, 116  {{ISBN|9781981731503}}[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=njZFDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA7]</ref>\n\n==Early life and family==\nMwakikagile was born on 4 October 1949 into a [[middle class]] Tanganyikan family in the town of [[Kigoma]], Western Province of [[Tanganyika]] \u2013 what is now mainland [[Tanzania]].<ref>Godfrey Mwakikagile, ''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'', {{ISBN|9789987160129}}, New Africa Press, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, 2009, p. 19.

Mwakikagile, ''My Life as an African: Autobiographical Writings'', Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: New Africa Press, 2009, p. 21. {{ISBN|9789987160051}}.</ref> His father Elijah Mwakikagile, who once worked at the internationally renowned [[Amani Research Institute]] in the late forties, was a medical assistant during the British colonial era and was one of the very few in the entire country of 10 million people. Medical assistants underwent an intensive three-year training after finishing secondary school and worked as a substitute for doctors. They were even called ''madaktari'' (doctors) in Swahili and formed the backbone of the medical system in Tanganyika as was the case in other British colonies. There were fewer than 10 doctors in colonial Tanganyika in the forties and fifties and only 12 at independence on 9 December 1961. And there were fewer than 300 medical assistants during those years serving millions of people in a vast country of more than 365,000 square miles. Godfrey's mother Syabumi Mwakikagile (n\u00e9e Mwambapa), a pupil of Tanganyika's prominent British feminist educator and later member of parliament Mary Hancock, was a housewife.<ref name=\"Kyoso pp. 8-9\" /> The eldest of his siblings, he was named Godfrey by his aunt Isabella, one of his father's younger sisters, and was baptised at an early age.<ref name=\"Kyoso\" />\n\nHis father played a critical role in his early life and education. He was a very strict disciplinarian and taught him at home when he was attending primary school and during the first two years of middle school before he left home to go to boarding school when he was 13 years old. His mother, who taught Sunday school and was a volunteer adult education teacher for some time teaching adults how to read and write, also taught him at home when he was in primary school.<ref>Kyoso, p. 123, 169, 176</ref>\n\n===Family connections===\nMwakikagile grew up in a politically conscious family. His parents, especially his father, were friends with some of the leading figures in the struggle for independence, and some renowned [[African nationalism|African nationalists]] and [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-Africanists]] of that era. They included [[Austin Shaba]], Elijah Mwakikagile's co-worker as a medical assistant and earlier his classmate at a medical training centre at Tanganyika's largest hospital in the capital [[Dar es Salaam]] later transformed into the country's first medical school who also served as a member of parliament for [[Mtwara]] and cabinet member in [[President of Tanzania|the first independence cabinet]]\u2014 serving as Minister of Local Government under [[Julius Nyerere]], and later as Minister of Health and Housing, and as Deputy [[List of Speakers of the National Assembly of Tanzania|Speaker of Parliament]];\n[[John Mwakangale]], a classmate of Elijah Mwakikagile from Standard One at [[Tukuyu]] Primary School to [[Malangali Secondary School]]. They came from the same area, five miles apart, and knew each other since childhood. Mwakangale became one of the prominent leaders of the [[Tanganyika African National Union]] (TANU) and of the [[Pan-African Freedom Movement for East and Central Africa]] (PAFMECA) under the leadership of Pan-Africanist and African nationalist Julius Nyerere.\n\nJohn Mwakangale was also the first leader [[Nelson Mandela]] met in newly independent Tanganyika in January 1962 - just one month after the country emerged from colonial rule - when Mandela secretly left [[South Africa]] on 11 January to seek assistance from other African countries in the struggle against apartheid and wrote about him in his autobiography [[Long Walk to Freedom]]. Tanganyika was the first independent African country Mandela visited and the first in the region to win independence. He went to other African countries using a travel document given to him by the government of Tanganyika. The document stated: \"This is Nelson Mandela, a citizen of the Republic of South Africa. He has permission to leave Tanganyika and return here.\" Tanganyika was chosen by other African leaders in May 1963 to be the headquarters of all the African liberation movements under the leadership of President Julius Nyerere when they met in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to form the [[Organisation of African Unity]] ([[OAU]]).\n\nJohn Mwakangale was also a member of parliament and served in the cabinet as Minister of Labour under Nyerere in the early part of independence. Professor [[John Iliffe (historian)|John Iliffe]] in his book ''A Modern History of Tanganyika'' described John Mwakangale as a \"vehement nationalist.\" He did not even want American [[Peace Corps]] in Tanganyika and accused them of causing trouble. He was quoted in a news report, \"M.P. Attacks American Peace Corps,\" which was the main story on the front page of the Tanganyika ''Standard'', 12 June 1964, stating: \"These people are not here for peace, they are here for trouble. We do not want any more Peace Corps.\"\n\nAmerican Peace Corps were some of Godfrey Mwakikagile's teachers in middle school and secondary school. One of them was [[Leonard Levitt]], his teacher in middle school in 1964 who became a renowned author. He wrote, among other works, ''An African Season'', the first book ever written by a Peace Corps.\n\nOther classmates of Elijah Mwakikagile were Wilbard B.K. Mwanjisi from Standard One at Tukuyu Primary School to Malangali Secondary School who became a doctor, prominent member of TANU and, before leaving government service, was president of a national organisation for African government employees during colonial rule; [[Jeremiah Kasambala]], Elijah Mwakikagile's classmate at Malangali Secondary School who became head of the [[Rungwe]] African Cooperative Union responsible for mobilising support from farmers to join the struggle for independence. Kasambala went on to become a cabinet member in the early years of independence\u2014taking over the portfolio for [[Minister of Industry and Trade (Tanzania)|Commerce and Cooperatives]] and later served as Minister of Industries, Minerals and Energy; and Brown Ngwilulupi, appointed by President Nyerere as Secretary General of the [[Cooperative Union of Tanganyika]] (CUT), the largest farmers' union in the country.\n\nNgwilulupi later left the ruling party, [[Chama Cha Mapinduzi]], and became co-founder of Tanzania's largest opposition party [[Chadema]] and served as vice chairman. Brown Ngwilulupi and Elijah Mwakikagile came from the same village four miles south of the town of [[Tukuyu]] in Rungwe District ringed by misty blue mountains north of Lake Nyasa in the Great Rift Valley in the Southern Highlands Province and were classmates from Standard One at Tukuyu Primary School to Malangali Secondary School, one of the top schools in colonial Tanganyika where Elijah was head prefect. They later became relatives-in-law. Their respective wives, who came from the same area their husbands came from, were first cousins to each other and were born and brought up together in the same household. Brown Ngwilulupi was an elder brother of Ephraim Weidi Ngwilulupi Mwasakafyuka\u2014a former senior diplomat at the Tanzania Mission to the [[United Nations]] and at the Tanzanian embassy in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]], and later Tanzania's ambassador to [[France]] and [[Nigeria]] who also left the ruling party and joined one of the main opposition parties where he became head of its foreign affairs division. He also once served as head of the [[Africa]] and [[Middle East]] Division at the Tanzanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.<ref>Kyoso, pp. 22, 193-4</ref><ref>Mwakikagile, Godfrey, ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'', New Africa Press (2007), p. 105, {{ISBN|9780980253412}} [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=D4LcR4iOmcYC&pg=PA105#v=onepage&q&f=false] (last retrieved 1 December 2018)</ref><ref>[[AllAfrica.com]] - ''Tanzania: Recalling the First Union Cabinet of 1964'' (25 November 2010) [https://allafrica.com/stories/201011260028.html]</ref><ref>Mwakikagile, Godfrey, ''Life under British Colonial Rule: Recollections of an African and a British Administrator in Tanganyika and Southern Rhodesia'', New Africa Press (2018), p. 112, {{ISBN|9789987160426}}[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8BZaDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA112#v=onepage&q&f=false] (last retrieved 1 December 2018)</ref>\n\nThe American ambassador to Tanzania, [[James W. Spain]], described Weidi Mwasakafyuka in the following terms, according to a \"Public Library of US Diplomacy\" report, 5 May 1976:\n\n\"E.W. N. Mwasakafyuka, Director of Africa and Middle East Division of Foreign Ministry (also Head of the [[OAU]] Affairs Section at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs), educated at the [[University of California-Los Angeles]] (and [[Carleton University]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]])...is a career Foreign Service Officer who has served in Addis Ababa and at the U.N.

He is friendly with Americans, has a strong but dry sense of humor, and looks like a black Disraeli....FonOff (Foreign Office) number one African expert...a forthright source when he is unleashed. A regular embassy contact.\"\n\nGodfrey Mwakikagile is also a first cousin of Brigadier-General Owen Rhodfrey Mwambapa, a graduate of [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]], a royal military academy in the [[United Kingdom]], and former head of the [[Tanzania Military Academy]], an army officers' training school at [[Monduli]] in [[Arusha Region]]. Owen's father was an elder brother of Godfrey's mother, the last-born in her family. And Godfrey's father was a first cousin of one of Tanzania's first commercial airline pilots Oscar Mwamwaja who was shot but survived when he was a co-pilot of an Air Tanzania plane that was hijacked on 26 February 1982 and forced to fly from Tanzania to [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Elijah's mother was an elder sister of Oscar's father.\n\n===Education and early employment===\nGodfrey Mwakikagile attended Kyimbila Primary School - founded by British feminist educator Mary Hancock and transformed into a co-educational institution - near the town of Tukuyu, and Mpuguso Middle School in Rungwe District, [[Mbeya Region]], in the Southern Highlands. The headmaster of Mpuguso Middle School, Moses Mwakibete, was his math teacher in 1961 and later became a judge at the High Court of Tanzania appointed by President Nyerere. Mwakikagile also attended [[Songea]] Secondary School in [[Ruvuma Region]] which was once a part of the Southern Province, and Tambaza High School (up to Form Six) in Dar es Salaam.<ref>Mwakikagile, Godfrey, ''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'', pp.&nbsp;44, 77, 122; ''My Life as an African'', pp.&nbsp;47-48, 78, 89, 92, 117, 119, 138, 154, 172, 175; ''Tanzania under Mwalimu Nyerere: Reflections on an African Statesman'', pp.&nbsp;15\u201316, New Africa Press - Pretoria, South Africa, (2006), {{ISBN|9780980253498}}</ref>\n\nWhile still in high school at Tambaza, Mwakikagile joined the editorial staff of the ''Standard'' (later renamed the [[Daily News (Tanzania)|Daily News]]) in 1969 as a reporter.<ref name=\"Stan\">''My Life as an African'', pp. 89\u201390; \"Newsman Leaves for America,\" ''Daily News'', Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, 7 November 1972, p.&nbsp;3; ''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'', p.&nbsp;56.</ref> Founded in 1930, it was the oldest and largest English newspaper in the country and one of the three largest in [[East Africa]], a region comprising [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]] and Tanzania.\n\nAfter finishing high school in November 1970, Mwakikagile joined the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force|National Service]] in January 1971 which was mandatory for all those who had completed secondary school, high school and college or university studies. He underwent training, which included basic military training, at [[Ruvu, Kibaha District|Ruvu]] National Service camp when it was headed by his former primary school teacher Eslie Mwakyambiki before he became a Member of Parliament (MP) and Deputy Minister of Defence and National Service under President Nyerere. Mwakikagile then progressed to another National Service camp in [[Bukoba]] on the shores of [[Lake Victoria]] in the North-West Region bordering Uganda.\n\nAfter leaving National Service, Mwakikagile returned to the ''Daily News''. His editor then was Sammy Mdee who later served as President Nyerere's press secretary and as  Tanzania's deputy ambassador to the United Nations, and then [[Benjamin Mkapa]] who helped him to further his studies in the [[United States]]. Years later, Mkapa became President of Tanzania after serving as President Nyerere's press secretary, Minister of Foreign Affairs and as ambassador to Nigeria, Canada and the United States among other cabinet and ambassadorial posts. He was a student of Nyerere in secondary school<ref>\"Newsman Leaves for America,\" ''Daily News'', 7 November 1972, p.&nbsp;3; ''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'', p.&nbsp;123; ''My Life as an African'', p.&nbsp;90.</ref>\n\nMwakikagile also worked as an [[information officer]] at the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (now known as the [[Ministry of Information, Youth, Culture and Sports]]) in Dar es Salaam before going to the United States in November 1972 for further studies.<ref>\"Newsman Leaves for America,\" ''Daily News'', 7 November 1972, p.&nbsp;3; ''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'', pp.&nbsp;122\u2013123; ''My Life as an African'', p.&nbsp;176.</ref>\n\nIn the United States, Godfrey Mwakikagile served as president of the African Students Union whilst attending [[Wayne State University]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].

One of his professors of economics and head of the economics department at Aquinas was [[Kenneth Marin]] who had worked as an economist for the government of Tanzania in Dar es Salaam in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Before he went to Tanzania, Professor Marin was appointed by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] to serve on Wage and Price Control during the mid-sixties. President Johnson appointed him as a member of the [[White House]] Consumer Advisory Council. In 1966, Professor Marin was a member of a U.S. State Department evaluation team that was assigned to review various performances in the economic and political arena in six South American countries. After he left Tanzania, he returned to his  home town, Grand Rapids, to teach at Aquinas College, his alma mater.

[[Racial segregation|Racial segregation based on skin colour]] similar to those in [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]] and the [[United States]] was inflicted against the native Africans by the European colonialists. Lavatories were labelled \"Europeans,\" \"Asians\" and \"Africans.\" Some hotels and bars were labelled \"Europeans.\" There were separate schools for Europeans, Asians and Africans. Facilities for Africans - black people - were the worst.\n\nAfrican leaders, including [[Julius Nyerere]], campaigning for independence were subjected to the same racial indignities which continued even after the end of colonial rule, especially during the early years, but drew a swift response from the new government which was predominantly black and multi-racial. As Mwakikagile stated in his book ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'', citing Legum and Mmari:\n\n:\"Mwalimu [Julius Nyerere] himself had experienced racial discrimination, what we in East Africa \u2013 and elsewhere including southern Africa \u2013 also call colour bar. As [[Colin Legum]] states in a book he edited with Tanzanian professor, Geoffrey Mmari, ''Mwalimu: The Influence of Nyerere'':\n\n::''I was privileged to meet Nyerere while he was still a young teacher in short trousers at the very beginning of his political career, and to engage in private conversations with him since the early 1950s.''\n\n::''My very first encounter in 1953 taught me something about his calm authority in the face of racism in colonial Tanganyika. I had arranged a meeting with four leaders of the nascent nationalist movement at the Old Africa Hotel in [[Dar es Salaam]]. We sat at a table on the pavement and ordered five beers, but before we could lift our glasses an African waiter rushed up and whipped away all the glasses except mine.''\n\n::''I rose to protest to the white manager, but Nyerere restrained me. 'I am glad it happened,' he said, 'now you can go and tell your friend Sir Edward Twining [the colonial governor at the time] how things are in this country.'''\n\n::''His manner was light and amusing, with no hint of anger.''\n\nSimple, yet profound. For, beneath the surface lay a steely character with a deep passion for justice across the colour line and an uncompromising commitment to the egalitarian ideals he espoused and implemented throughout his political career, favouring none.\n\nYears later his son, Andrew Nyerere, told me about an incident that also took place in the capital Dar es Salaam shortly after Tanganyika won independence in 1961 near the school he and I attended and where we also stayed from 1969 - 1970.  Like the incident earlier when Julius Nyerere was humiliated at the Old Africa Hotel back in 1953, this one also involved race. As Andrew stated in a letter to me in 2002 when I was writing this book:\n\n'As you remember, Sheikh Amri Abeid was the first mayor of Dar es Salaam. Soon after independence, the mayor went to Palm Beach Hotel (near our high school, Tambaza, on United Nations Road in Upanga). There was a sign at the hotel which clearly stated: 'No Africans and dogs allowed inside.' He was blocked from entering the hotel, and said in protest, 'But I am the Mayor.' Still he was told, 'You will not get in.' Shortly thereafter, the owner of the hotel was given 48 hours to leave the country. When the nationalization exercise began, that hotel was the first to be nationalized.'\n\nSuch insults were the last thing that could be tolerated in newly independent Tanganyika. And President Nyerere, probably more than any other African leader, would not have tolerated, and did not tolerate, seeing even the humblest of peasants being insulted and humiliated by anyone including fellow countrymen.\" - (Godfrey Mwakikagile, ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'', Fifth Edition, New Africa Press, 2010, pp. 501 \u2013 502).\n\nThere was also residential segregation in urban areas reminiscent of apartheid South Africa and the United States during and even after the era of segregation. Members of different races lived in their own areas. Dar es Salaam was a typical example. As [[Trevor Grundy]], a British journalist who worked in Tanzania at the same newspaper where Godfrey Mwakikagile also worked as a news reporter during the same period, stated in his review of Professor Thomas Molony's book, ''Nyerere - The Early Years'':\n\n\"The British turned Tanganyika into an undeclared apartheid state that was socially divided between divided Africans, Europeans and Asians....It was British-style apartheid - their secret was never to give racial segregation a name.\" - (Trevor Grundy, \"Julius Nyerere Reconsidered\", review of Thomas Molony, ''Nyerere - The Early Years'', africaunauthorised.com, 4 May 2015).\n\nThe years Godfrey Mwakikagile spent under segregation when he was growing up in different parts of Tanganyika shaped his thinking and perspective on race relations and on the impact of colonial rule on the colonised when he became a writer of non-fiction books about colonial and post-colonial Africa.\n\nThere was also racial discrimination in employment during colonial rule when Godfrey Mwakikagile was growing up in the fifties. Europeans, Asians and members of other races earned more than Africans did even if they had the same skills and level of education. His father was a victim of such discrimination when he worked for the colonial government, as he has stated in his autobiographical writings.\n\nThe struggle for independence in Tanganyika in the 1950s, Mwakikagile's formative years, was partly fuelled by such racial injustices which, years later, became the focus of some of his writings.\n\n'''Racial incidents'''\n\nHe has written about racism in his book ''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'' and other works including ''Life under British Colonial Rule: Recollections of an African'' in which he has described some incidents of racial injustice. One such incident involved his father when a white supervisor where he worked told him he could not have lunch in the office they shared or even put it on the table. But the supervisor could eat there.\n\nAnother one had to do with Godfrey Mwakikagile himself when, as a six-year-old walking to school with other boys, he was severely injured after being chased and bitten by a dog owned by a white couple who lived in a house the children went by everyday, on a public road, on their way to and from school. Decades later, he stated in his autobiographical writings, ''Life under British Colonial Rule: Recollections of an African'' published in 2018, that he still had a highly visible scar on his right knee where he was bitten by the dog. It was a large dog and it could have killed him.\n\nThe couple had two dogs, including a German shepherd, which used to chase the boys. They knew the children went by their house and saw them on their way to and from school everyday but did not tie the dogs or keep them on leashes.\n\nThe house was on a tea plantation at Kyimbila, the children passed through, and the husband was the manager of Kyimbila Tea Estate.\n\nThat was in 1956 when Godfrey Mwakikagile was in Standard One in primary school in Rungwe District in the Southern Highlands Province, as he stated in his books ''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'', ''My Life as an African'', ''Life under British Colonial Rule'' and ''Tanzania under Mwalimu Nyerere: Reflections on an African Statesman''.\n\nAfter being bitten by the dog, he stated in his autobiographical writings that he went on to school where he attended class without getting any help \u2013 there was no medical assistance at the primary school, not even a First Aid kit \u2013 until he returned home in the evening. He continued to go to school in the following days. And nothing could be done to the dog owners during those days. It was colonial rule, blacks did not have the same rights whites had and \"knew their place\" in terms of social status as colonial subjects not as equal citizens in a racially divided society which was vertically structured not only to keep whites on top of other races, especially blacks, but also virtually above the law.\n\nGodfrey Mwakikagile also stated in his autobiographical works that when he was bitten by the dog, the attack was seared in his memory but as a six-year-old he did not see it in terms of racism until he became a teenager. Years later, he stated in some of his writings that had the children been white, the white couple would probably not have allowed the dogs to roam freely knowing they could attack them.\n\nThe colonial rulers and many white settlers had total disregard for the well-being of Africans as Godfrey Mwakikagile himself experienced when he was growing up in colonial Tanganyika and almost lost his life when he was attacked by a dog owned by a white couple who did not care about the safety of African children, or any other blacks, passing by their house even though they walked on a public road.  As he stated in his book, ''Life under British Colonial Rule'':\n\n\"There is no question that justice was colour-conscious during colonial rule. That was one of the tragedies of being colonised; our status defined by the colour of our skin.\n\nColour is immaterial but it carries a lot of weight.\" - (Godfrey Mwakikagile, ''Life under British Colonial Rule'', New Africa Press, 2018, p.&nbsp;108; G. Mwakikagile, ''Black Conservatives in the United States'', 2006, p.&nbsp;96).\n\n==Writings==\n\nMwakikagile's first book, ''Economic Development in Africa'', was published in June 1999. He has maintained a steady pace since then, writing more than 70 books in 20 years as his bibliography shows, mostly about Africa during the post-colonial era. He has been described as a political scientist and as a historian although his works defy classification. He has written about history, politics, economics, as well as contemporary and international affairs from an African and a Third World perspective.\n\nHe takes an interdisciplinary approach in his works combining history, political science, economics, philosophy, cultural and international studies and other academic disciplines in his analysis of a wide range of issues focusing on Africa, especially during the post-colonial era. He has also written some books about the African diaspora, mainly Black America and the Afro-Caribbean region including Afro-Caribbean communities in Britain and the United States.\n\n===Book: ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era''===\n\nHe is known for his book ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'',<ref>Godfrey Mwakikagile, ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'', 5th Edition, {{ISBN|0980253411}}, Pretoria, South Africa: New Africa Press, 2010.</ref> published not long after Nyerere died.

Professor Southall was also the editor of the journal during that period.\n\nOthers who reviewed the book include Professor A.B. Assensoh, a [[Ghanaian]] teaching at [[Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], [[Indiana]], in the [[United States]]. He reviewed the first edition of ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'' in the ''African Studies Review'', an academic journal of the [[African Studies Association]], in 2003.\n\nIt is also a comprehensive work on post-colonial Africa in terms of the major events covered since the sixties when most countries on the continent won independence.\n\nEvents covered include emergence and consolidation of the one-party state as a continental phenomenon after the end of colonial rule; the Congo crisis triggered by the secession of [[Katanga Province]] and the assassination of [[Patrice Lumumba]]; the end of Mobutu's reign over Congo after decades in power since Lumumba's assassination; the [[Zanzibar revolution]] followed by the union of Tanganyika and Zanzibar to form Tanzania; declaration of independence by Biafra and subsequent civil war ignited by the secession of the Eastern Region resolutely opposed by Federal Nigeria; the war between Tanzania and Uganda under Idi Amin.\n\nOther events Mwakikagile has covered in his book include Western involvement in the countries of southern Africa in support of white minority governments; the liberation struggle in [[Mozambique]] and eventual victory by the freedom fighters of the [[Front for the Liberation of Mozambique]] ([[Frelimo]]); the war in [[Zimbabwe]] leading to victory by the liberation forces of [[ZANU]] and [[ZAPU]]; the struggle for independence in Angola led by the [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] ([[MPLA]]) and subsequent victory over the Portuguese colonial forces.\n\nThe influence of Nyerere as a continental and Third World leader also constitutes a significant part of the book including a chapter on Nyerere and Nkrumah on the different approaches they took in an attempt to achieve continental unity under one government.\n\nThe first and last chapters provide a comprehensive look at the continent from the sixties to the nineties and beyond, constituting a panoramic view of post-colonial Africa during some of its most turbulent times since the end of colonial rule.\n\nThe book has also been cited by a number of African leaders including [[South Africa|South African]] Vice-President [[Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka]] in one of her speeches about African leadership and development in which she quoted the author.<ref>Godfrey Mwakikagile quoted by South African Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka in \"Address Delivered by the Deputy President, Ms. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka at the Third Annual Julius Nyerere Memorial Lecture at the University of the Western Cape, South Africa.\" Issued by the Presidency through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Pretoria, South Africa, 6 September 2006.</ref>\n\n===Book: ''Africa and the West''===\n\nGodfrey Mwakikagile's 2000 book ''Africa and the West'' was favourably reviewed in a number of publications, including the influential ''West Africa'' magazine by editor Kofi Akosah-Sarpong, who described Mwakikagile as an author who articulates the position of [[African Renaissance]] thinkers.<!--, a [[Ghanaian]] who also once was a visiting lecturer and scholar-in-residence at the [[University of Botswana]], gave the book an excellent review.\n\nThe book is a sweeping survey of the continent before the advent of colonial rule and during the colonial era as well as after independence, was also reviewed by ''West Africa'' magazine in its edition of 21\u201327 January 2002--><ref>Kofi Akosah-Sarpong, \"Back to The Roots,\" in ''West Africa'', 21\u201327 January 2002, p.&nbsp;43.</ref> The book has been described as an appeal to Africans to respect their cultures, values, and traditions and take a firm stand against alien ideas that pollute African minds and undermine Africa. A strong condemnation of the conquest of Africa by the imperial powers, it is also a philosophical text used in a number of colleges and universities in the study of African identity, philosophy, and history.\n\nMwakikagile has written about the impact of Western influence on Africa and how it has affected the continent's destiny even in terms of perception of its people by the rest of the world. Although he concedes there may have been some benefits \u2013 on both sides \u2013 from the interaction between Africa and Europe, he contends that the effect of Western influence on Africans has largely been negative and has served to reinforce racial stereotypes about Africans which have a long history in the minds of Westerners from the first time they came into contact with Africans.\n\nHe contends that racism has been a major factor in this interaction between Africa and the West, including total disregard for the well-being of Africans which was a continental phenomenon especially during colonial rule even if the parallels were not exact; it was the same experience, and humiliation, nonetheless, be it in Tanganyika, [[Kenya]], [[Guinea]] or [[Mali]]. As he states in his book ''Africa and The West'':\n\n\u201cIn all the African colonies, exploitation went hand in hand with degradation and brutality. In the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] under the [[Belgian]] [[King Leopold II]], Belgians chopped off the hands and arms of Africans who did not collect enough rubber from the forest. In Tanganyika, when it was [[German East Africa]], [[Germans]] introduced forced labor and corporal punishment, virtually enslaving Africans, a practice which triggered the [[Maji Maji]] war of resistance from 1905 \u2013 07 and covered almost half of the country. The uprising almost ended German rule which was saved only after reinforcements were rushed from [[Germany]].\n\nThe [[French people|French]] in [[West Africa]] also introduced forced labor. Some of the leaders of independent Africa toiled in those labor camps. Madeira Keita, a native of Mali who was active in the politics of Guinea before it won independence in 1958 and collaborated closely with [[Sekou Toure]] in founding the [[Democratic Party of Guinea]], was one of them. In April 1959, he became Interior Minister of Mali, and in August 1960, he also became Minister of National Defense, holding two ministerial posts under President Modibo Keita. He related his experience as a conscripted laborer:\n\n'Before 1945, there was a colonial regime with government by decree, the regime of the ''indignat''. The ''indignat'' form of government permitted the colonial administration to put Africans in prison without any trial. Sometimes you were put in prison for two weeks because you did not greet the administrator or the commander. You were happy enough if they did not throw stones at you or send you to a work camp, because there was also forced labor at that time. In 1947, I met French journalists who were very surprised to learn that forced labor was nonvoluntary and not paid for. Transportation was not even covered; nor were food and lodging. The only thing that was covered was work.'\n\nThe conquest of Africa inexorably led to such brutality because its purpose was exploitation which has no room for compassion. It was an invasion we could very well have done without. The baneful foreign influence Africa is still subjected to is a result of that invasion. And we are now inextricably linked with our former conquerors, for better or for worse, in an international system which accentuates inequalities and from which no part of humanity can extricate itself.\n\nBut the materialism of the West, which has found its way into Africa with devastating impact, must be counterbalanced with the spirituality and sense of sharing of the African which animates his culture, indeed his very being.\" - Godfrey Mwakikagile, ''Africa and The West'', Huntington, New York: Nova Science Publishers, Inc., 2000, pp. 14 \u2013 15; Madeira Keita, \"Le Parti Unique en Afrique,\" in ''Presence Africaine'', No. 30, February \u2013 March 1960; and Madeira Keita, \"The Single Party in Africa,\" in Paul E. Sigmund, ed., ''The Ideologies of the Developing Nations'', New York: Praeger, 1963, p.&nbsp;170. On the African uprising and war of resistance against German colonial rule in Tanganyika, see, among other works, G. C. K. Gwassa and John Iliffe, eds., ''Records of the Maji-Maji Rising'', Dar es Salaam: Tanzania Publishing House, 1968).\n\nMwakikagile further stated in ''Africa and The West'':\n\n\"The argument that we blacks are genetically inferior to members of other races is nothing new. It is a stereotype rooted in Western intellectual tradition and has even been given \"credibility\" by some of the most eminent thinkers of the Western world including [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Georg Hegel]], [[David Hume]], and [[Baron de Montesquieu]]. Some of them did not even consider blacks to be full human beings. As Montesquieu stated in ''The Spirit of the Laws'':\n\n'These creatures are all over black, and with such a flat nose, that they can scarcely be pitied. It is hardly to be believed that God, who is a wise Being, should place a soul, especially a good soul, in such a black, ugly body. The Negroes prefer a glass necklace to that gold which polite nations so highly value: can there be a greater proof of their wanting common sense? It is impossible for us to suppose these creatures to be men.'\n\nThe other philosophers were no less racist. According to Kant:\n\n'The Negroes of Africa have received from nature no intelligence that rises above the foolish. The difference between the two races (black and white) is thus a substantial one: it appears to be just as great in respect of the faculties of the mind as in color.'\n\nHume:\n\n'I am apt to suspect the Negroes...to be naturally inferior to the whites. There never was any civilized nation of any other complexion than white, nor even any individual eminent in action or speculation. No ingenious manufactures among them, no arts, no sciences...Such a uniform and constant difference could not happen, in so many countries and ages, if nature had not made an original distinction betwixt these breeds of men.'\n\nAnd according to Hegel:\n\n'Africa...is no historical part of the world; it has no movement or development to exhibit.'\n\nIt is a sentiment echoed more than 100 years later in contemporary times by many people including British historian [[Arnold Toynbee]] who died in 1975. As he put it:\n\n'The black races alone have not contributed positively to any civilization.'\n\nAnd in the words of that great humanitarian Dr. [[Albert Schweitzer]]:\n\n'The Negro is a child, and with children nothing can be done without the use of authority. We must, therefore, so arrange the circumstances of daily life that my natural authority can find expression. With regard to the Negroes, then, I have coined the formula: 'I am your brother, it is true, but your elder brother\"...\n\nThe conquest of Africa led not only to oppression and exploitation, but also to denigration of her culture and indigenous institutions. Africans, at least a vary large number of them, were brainwashed into believing that they had no history they could be proud of; that all their customs and traditions were bad, and that even their languages were bad.... When Africa was conquered by the imperial powers, she was also conquered by ideas...as a very effective weapon for conquering other people by conquering their minds....\n\nThere is no other continent which is endowed with so much in terms of natural resources. But there is also no other continent where it has been so easy for foreigners to take what does not belong to them....\nBecause of the pervasive nature of Western influence, its negative impact has reached all parts of the world, including Africa where the devastation wrought is difficult to contain because of the underdeveloped nature of our economies, and also because of our inability to resist such penetration. The sheer scope of such influence, as well as its negative attraction especially among the youth who are mesmerized by the glitter of the West, is mind-boggling and far beyond our capacity to resist it. That is especially the case in the cities which continue to attract millions of people in search of better - read, Western - life. It is a burden Africa cannot bear.\n\nThe West may have harnessed the forces of nature and pushed the frontiers of knowledge in many areas, from which Africa has indeed benefited as has the rest of the world. But Africa's contribution \u2013 material and spiritual as well as intellectual \u2013 to the growth of Western civilization has never been fully acknowledged. Nor has the destruction of African civilization by the West through imperial conquest. That is undoubtedly one of the saddest chapters in the history of relations between Africa and the West. As Immanuel Kant, although a racist, conceded in one of his works ''Eternal Peace and Other Essays'':\n\n'If we compare the barbarian instances of inhospitality...with the inhuman behavior of the civilized, and especially the commercial, states of our continent, the injustice practiced by them even in their first contact with foreign lands and peoples fills us with horror; the mere visiting of such peoples being regarded by them as equivalent to a conquest...The Negro lands,...The Cape of Good Hope, etc., on being discovered, were treated as countries that belonged to nobody; for the aboriginal inhabitants were reckoned as nothing...And all this has been done by nations who make a great ado about their piety, and who, while drinking up iniquity like water, would have themselves regarded as the very elect of orthodox faith.'\n\nAfrica has yet to recover from the multiple wounds inflicted on her by this Western invasion. But there is a glimmer of hope. And that is traditional Africa. In spite of all the devastating blows our continent has sustained from the West, traditional Africa continues to be the continent's spiritual anchor and bedrock of our values without which we are no more than a dilapidated house shifting on quick sand. It is to traditional society that we must turn to save Africa from the West, and also save ourselves \u2013 from ourselves....Our future may lie in the past.\" - (G. Mwakikagile, ''Africa and The Wes''t, ibid., pp. vii \u2013 ix, vi, 208, 218).\n\nIf Africans don't do that, true African Renaissance is impossible. It is traditional Africa which defines who and what we are as a people and as an organic entity because it is the heart and soul, and essence, of our very being, but capable of coexistence with others on the basis of equality without necessarily leading to a higher synthesis of cultures at the expense of individual cultural identities, he contends.\n\nMwakikagile further contends that it is this essence of African-ness which is acknowledged even by some Westernised or brainwashed Africans in rare moments of nostalgia when they say: That is how we lived before the coming of Europeans; that is how our ancestors lived; that is what our ancestors did; not everything was good but they were good old days; our communal and family ties were stronger in those days than they are today; that is how we lived as Africans; that is what it meant to be African - those days are gone.\n\nIt was an essence, of African-ness, that was not contaminated or threatened in its pristine beauty, by foreign influence, because there was no such influence. When they acknowledge this essence, they are invoking the essence of their very being, yet at the same repudiate it when they embrace Westernisation or any other foreign influence and identity because they think it is better than being African, he contends.\n\nHe goes on to argue that Africans can continue to be active members of the global community and benefit from modernisation without losing or compromising their essence as Africans. And that means reclaiming the spirit and values of traditional Africa and its institutions as well as indigenous knowledge to enable them to chart their way forward and navigate in the treacherous waters of globalisation which threatens the integrity and well-being of the continent in terms of identity and personality.\n\nOtherwise we are going to copy everything from other people and become a product of other cultures as if we did not have our own essence and identity before we came into contact with them, he contends.\n\nHe goes on to argue that culture is a vital force and source of life for a nation. A nation without culture has no soul. It has no spiritual identity. And it has no vitality of its own as if it is a lifeless corporeal entity, he contends.\n\nHe also states that by turning against traditional Africa, modernised Africans have lost their soul since it is traditional Africa which is the essence of their very being.\n\n'''Effects of colonial rule'''\n\nMwakikagile also contends that cultural imperialism has had a devastating impact on many Africans in terms of identity, with many of them preferring to be anything else but African because they are ashamed of their \"primitive\" African heritage and Africa's \"backwardness.\" Some of them even proudly profess they have \"forgotten\" their native languages after living abroad, especially in the West, for only a few years; sometimes for only two to three - let alone five or more. They say they can no longer speak [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Kikuyu language|Gikuyu]] and so on.\n\nThey can only speak [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] or some other European language. Many of them don't even know those languages well. Yet they are so proud of speaking them, and with phoney accents just to sound British or American, French, German and so on, because they are not African languages. And there are those who anglicise their African names or spell them in some other European language because it makes them \"sophisticated\" and no longer \"primitive.\" \n\nHe further states that many Africans like to mix English, French or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] - languages of their former colonial masters - with the native languages they speak as a sign of \"sophistication\" and of being \"well-educated,\" a phenomenon which, in East Africa, has led to the evolution of what is known as Kiswanglish, a hybrid of [[Kiswahili]] and English especially in Kenya and Tanzania. He goes on to state that this is especially so among the elite, most of whom are a product of Western education even in local schools in terms of intellectual preparation from the primary school level patterned after the colonial educational systems of Western origin.\n\nMwakikagile also contends that even African countries are described as English-speaking, French-speaking and Portuguese-speaking even though the vast majority of the people in those countries don't even understand let alone speak those languages. Africans themselves describe their countries in terms of being [[Anglophone]], [[Francophone]] and [[Lusophone]] instead of describing them as multi-lingual African-speaking countries since most of the people in those countries speak indigenous languages.\n\nHe goes on to state that many Africans are even proud of being called \"British\" or \"French\" as was the case during colonial rule when many educated Africans in \"Anglophone\" and \"Francophone\" Africa thought it was a very high compliment when their own people and the colonial rulers said to them: \"Oh, you're very British,\" \"You're very French,\" instead of seeing that as insult to them and their African identity. And whey they became leaders and bureaucrats in their own countries after the end of colonial rule, they continued to glorify their former colonial masters and serve the metropolitan powers. They were so brainwashed that they agreed with their former colonial rulers and even themselves believed that there was something wrong with being African.\n\nMwakikagile further states that cultural imperialism also has been very destructive in terms of indigenous knowledge that has been lost through suppression of native languages which are the repository of such knowledge transmitted from one generation to the next. Languages of the conquerors who ruled Africa are still given priority at the expense of native languages even decades after independence.\n\nLittle or nothing is being done to give native languages the status they deserve as vital tools for the preservation and dissemination of indigenous knowledge while, at the same time, continuing to use the languages of the former colonial powers - English, French and Portuguese - out of necessity. It is as if native languages are irrelevant to the well-being of Africans, reinforcing the attitude that nothing good comes out of Africa except minerals and other natural resources. And nothing good, not even indigenous knowledge and institutions, ever came from Africans except labour, especially manual labour.\n\nHe also contends that Western education was intended to de-Africanise Africans, as educated Africans also deliberately attempted to de-Africanise themselves by turning against their own indigenous cultures and traditional ways of life and values - hence against their very being - in order to become \"British,\" \"French,\" and \"Portuguese,\" the colonial powers which ruled Africa. Western education was also intended to alienate them from their own people - the more educated they were, the more de-Africanised they became - and turn them into loyal servants of their conquerors to perpetuate imperial domination of Africa even after the end of colonial rule; a goal that was achieved in most cases as has been demonstrated by the existence of neo-colonial governments in all parts of the continent since independence.\n\nHe says there were only a few exceptions such as Ghana under [[Nkrumah]], Tanzania under Nyerere, and Guinea under Sekou Toure where the leaders made a genuine attempt to achieve true independence. But even in those countries, there were subversive elements within the government and elsewhere in society working with the imperialist powers to undermine the leaders in order to sabotage their efforts to achieve true liberation from foreign domination.\n\nThe colonial rulers never really left Africa; they only changed faces, he contends.\n\nGodfrey Mwakikagile goes on to state that conquest of the mind was the worst form of imperial subjugation, a position he articulates in his works, ''Life under British Colonial Rule: Recollections of an African'' and ''Conquest of the Mind: Imperial subjugation of Africa'' which was published on his birthday in 2019 and its extended version, ''Colonial Mentality and the Destiny of Africa'' published in 2020, in which he examines the negative impact of colonial mentality on Africa's well-being as a continental crisis and how it impedes Africa's progress and the quest for an African renaissance. \n\nHe contends in his books that in many cases, the conquered ended up identifying with their conquerors. They emulated them and even tried to be more British than the British themselves, or more French than the French themselves, and glorified them as if they were the best specimen of mankind in spite of all the suffering and humiliation the colonial rulers inflicted on them.\n\nHe further contends that many Africans even identify themselves with their former colonial masters more than they do with fellow Africans who were ruled by other colonial powers. For example, Malians and Senegalese identify with the French more than they do with Ghanaians and Nigerians who were ruled by the British, further reinforcing the racist notion that Europeans are superior to Africans \u2013 it is better to be a part of them than it is to be a part of fellow Africans.\n\nHe goes on to state that the political and cultural divide between Francophone and Anglophone Africa is evident even in the [[African Union]] (AU) as was the case before in the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). There is rivalry and even mistrust between member countries which were ruled by the two colonial powers: France and Britain. The most tragic case, within a country, is the bloody conflict between [[Anglophone Cameroon]] and [[Francophone Cameroon]] in a nation where the former colonial power, [[France]], still wields enormous power and influence to the detriment of English-speaking Cameroonians of [[Southern Cameroons]] in the southwestern part of the country.\n\nMwakikagile contends that imperial control of Africa is manifested in many other ways, making a mockery of independence Africans are so proud of.\n\nHe also states that one of the tragedies that befell Africa was that to many Africans, their conquerors - European colonialists - not only became their role models; they emulated them in many ways and, by doing so, ended up destroying themselves in terms of their Africanness. He says it was a diminution of African identity and an attack on the African personality that goes on even today.\n\nHe contends all that is a victory for cultural imperialism not only in terms of language, European manners and mannerisms and culture adopted by many Africans but also in terms of ideas propagated by the West.\n\nThat is also the imperial logic, deliberately placing Africans in the sub-human category not only in terms of intellect but also in every other conceivable way.\n\nAnd that was the attitude of some settlers even in Tanganyika, placing Africans in the same category with dogs or other animals, especially monkeys, when Godfrey Mwakikagile was growing up in the fifties. That was the case even after independence in the early sixties, like the white manager of a hotel in the nation's capital Dar es Salaam who had a sign at the entrance of his hotel clearly stating, \"No Africans and dogs allowed inside\", and even refused to let in the mayor simply because the mayor was black.\n\nThere were many incidents of racism in Tanganyika during British colonial rule. In his book ''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'', Mwakikagile wrote about the British settlers he interviewed - then living in different parts of the world - and what they said about life in Tanganyika in those days. One of them stated the following in an interview in 2006:\n\n\"The behaviour of the white settlers towards the Africans was not always as good as it should have been. Mind you, many of the white people were unsettled by the war, totally footloose and earning more money in East Africa than was possible back \u2018home\u2019. Many should not have been given work out there. Too much money and not enough facilities to spend it on....\n\nI remember being shocked to hear one European admit that he treated his dogs better than he treated his African staff. \n\nMany of the Africans looking for work stated very clearly that they would only work either for a priest or a teacher. If work was not available then they would wander off in search of work elsewhere....\n\nWhites and Africans just did not mix. The white population had their meeting places and the Africans likewise. \n\nI was not aware of any Europeans who were opposed to the status quo. Whites and Blacks just did not mix. Except, that is, in Church. The Europeans sat on the left and the Africans sat on the right hand side of the little straw covered church (in Nach - Nachingwea). My mother was frequently the pianist at the services....\n\nThe House servants were a vital part of everyday life; but were very firmly kept in place. \n\nI did though, witness one distressing event. An African was walking along a town street (in Nachingwea), minding his own business, when an Alsatian leapt at him from the back of a pick-up truck. The African was shocked and scared witless. He leapt out of the way and into the road. He landed in the path of an oncoming car. The (white) driver of the car only just managed to pull up in time. He leapt out of his vehicle and punched the hapless African in such a way that his jaw was fractured. Dad took it upon himself to ferry the unfortunate man to the local hospital....\n\nThe Europeans had arrived and taken over the best land for themselves. There was an overwhelming feeling that the African 'so newly brought out of barbarism' was incapable of looking after himself without the benevolent eye of the European. For the most part White and African got on. Mainly this was because the African 'knew his place'....\n\nMany Europeans were aware that not enough was being done for the welfare of the Africans, but were unwilling to say so for fear of disturbing their own newly acquired life-style. My father had signed a contract to head a school for Europeans (in Nachingwea). He was not allowed to teach African children. The only Africans who got near the place were those learning to become office workers. They came to what was effectively nightschool....\n\nThe idea of being led by Africans was anathema to a great many Europeans....\n\nBefore we returned for the last time to the UK we were living in Nakuru (Kenya). Dad was in the process of taking over Greensteds School. The positioning of the buildings was perfect,\nabsolutely alongside the Rift Valley.\n\nThe Mau Mau uprising had just started. White settlers living away from civilisation were seen as easy targets. Many Europeans chose to carry guns....\n\nAs children we were taken once a week to a firing range and issued with 5 x 0.22 cartridges and expected to hit a tiny target. This I found immensely difficult. Because of the seriousness of the situation , the school was allocated a detachment of Africans from the \u2018King\u2019s African Rifles\u2019. They patrolled at night.\n\nNothing ever happened that I got to know about, except that the local Police station was raided by the Mau Mau; they stole 30 African Police uniforms and got away without being spotted....\n\nThe general feeling amongst the Europeans was that all this was a little local nuisance and that given time and a few strongarm European tactics, the indigenous population would be subdued. As we all know that situation escalated.\n\nAnother of the silly aspects of the Mau Mau situation was that the colonial ladies took to carrying small pistols and had different coloured holsters to match whatever outfit they were wearing.\" - (Nicholas Edmondson, UK, interviewed by Godfrey Mwakikagile, ''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'', Third Edition, New Africa Press, 2010, pp. 258 - 259, 260 \u2013 263, 264 - 265, 266).\n\nMwakikagile also states that even members of other races, not just whites, have been equally condescending and outright racist towards blacks. They include [[Mahatma Gandhi]] who was not a champion of racial equality yet was revered by a number of African and African American leaders such as [[Kwame Nkrumah]], [[Nelson Mandela]] and [[Martin Luther King]] for using non-violent methods of [[civil disobedience]] in the struggle against racial injustices and to fight for India's independence.\n\nWhen he lived in [[South Africa]] for 21 years, Gandhi expressed extreme racist views and described black people as \"raw [[kaffir (racial term)|kaffir]]s\", an extremely offensive term used by racist white South Africans and others which is equivalent to calling black people [[niggers]]. He argued that Indians were \"infinitely superior\" to blacks who were \"savage,\" \"half-heathen natives\" and inferior to other people as well in many ways. He also supported racial segregation to keep blacks away from members of other races. He said unlike blacks, Indians should be on the same level with whites because they were of the same stock; they had the same [[Aryan]] roots.\n\nIn 2016, his statue was removed from the [[University of Ghana]] in [[Accra]] because he did not deserve to be honoured as an icon in the struggle for racial equality and justice when he despised blacks. His statues sparked similar outrage in South Africa.\n\nMwakikagile further states that many Asians - mostly of [[Indian people|Indian]] and [[Pakistani]] origin - and [[Arabs]] in Tanganyika, later Tanzania, also held racist views but did not express them openly in a country where they were far outnumbered by blacks and whose destiny lay in the hands of the black majority.\n\nHe also states that East Africans who were born and brought up during colonial rule had more direct experience with racism than West Africans did because of the larger white population in East Africa with significant settler communities, especially in Kenya, although smaller and fewer in Tanganyika. Many of them had bitter experience with the colonial rulers and the white settlers because of the racial injustices perpetrated against them, including doubts about their intelligence and even common sense expressed by some whites. As he stated in ''Africa and The West'':\n\n\"Colonialism, as a system of oppression and exploitation, not only continued to plunder Africa but sought to instill in the minds of Africans feelings of inferiority to justify such domination...This is just one example \u2013 what Colonel Ewart Grogan, the doyen of the white settlers in colonial Kenya and leader of the Kenya British Empire Party, said about Africans attending the renowned Makerere University College in Uganda:\n\n'Just teaching a lot of stupid monkeys to dress up like Europeans. Won\u2019t do any good. Just cause a lot of discontent. They can never be like us, so better for them not to try.'\n\nAnother (Kenyan) settler in the 'Dark Continent' had this:\n\n'I\u2019ve actually got a farm hand who wears a tie \u2013 but the stupid bastard doesn\u2019t realize you don\u2019t wear a tie without a shirt!'\n\nThe implication is obvious. It is a sweeping indictment against all 'native Africans' as a bunch of idiots.\n\nYet another one, Sir Godfrey Huggins, Prime Minister of [[Southern Rhodesia]], acclaimed as a [[British people|British]] liberal, shot point-blank at a press conference in [[London]]:\n\n'It is time for the people in England to realize that the white man in Africa is not prepared and never will be prepared to accept the African as an equal, either socially or politically. Is there something in their chromosomes which makes them more backward and different from peoples living in the East and West?'\" - (Godfrey Mwakikagile, ibid., pp.&nbsp;9 \u2013 10, 69; [[Colin M. Turnbull]], ''The Lonely African'', New York: Simon and Schuster, 1962, pp.&nbsp;89, 21, 90, 97).\n\nGodfrey Mwakikagile also stated that the total disregard for the rights and well-being of Africans was earlier demonstrated by the arrogance of the imperial powers at the [[Berlin Conference]] in 1885 which led to the [[partition of Africa]]. He went on to state that Africans were not even represented at the conference, yet it was their fate that was being determined by Europeans who decided to partition the continent among themselves as if Africans did not even exist.\n\nHe also stated that this kind of arrogance and contempt for Africans was expressed in its crudest form in many ways including inflicting humiliating punishment on full-grown black men. They were subjected to corporal punishment at the hands of the white settlers who were young enough to be their sons. And shooting blacks was equated with shooting wild animals, as some white settlers in Kenya conceded, including those who had moved there from apartheid South Africa.\n\nArbitrary seizure of land, depriving Africans of their only means of livelihood, was simply seen as a white man's right exercised at will in what had become a white man's possession. In his book ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'', Godfrey Mwakikagile has given one example of this kind of imperial arrogance demonstrated by what happened to [[Tom Mboya]] who, together with [[Oginga Odinga]], was one of the leaders of the Kenyan delegation to the constitutional talks in London in 1960 on Kenyan independence. Mboya stated in his book ''Freedom and After'' that when he was walking on a street in London, one old English lady stopped him and asked him:\n\n\"Which one of our possessions do you come from?\"\n\nThe British settlers in East Africa even wanted to establish a giant federation of Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika, Nyasaland, Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia and turn it into a white dominion. Kenya was even declared a \u201cwhite man's country.\u201d Blacks were nothing. It was a sentiment shared by many white settlers. Ewart Grogan, the most outspoken leader of the white settlers in Kenya, was known for such imperial arrogance, as Godfrey Mwakikagile stated in his book ''Africa and The West'':\n\n\"A man with a flair for controversy and an outspoken racist, Grogan described himself as 'the baddest and boldest of a bold bad gang.' He also gained notoriety for publicly flogging Africans in Nairobi. The settlers from South Africa also came 'with the racial prejudices of that country. Frederick Jackson, Sir Charles Eliot's Deputy Commissioner, told the Foreign Office that the Protectorate was becoming a country of 'nigger-' and game-shooters'...\n\nColonel Ewart Grogan, a leader of the white settlers, bluntly stated: 'We Europeans have to go on ruling this country and rule it with iron discipline...If the whole of the Kikuyu land unit is reverted to the Crown, then every Kikuyu would know that our little queen was a great Bwana.' - (G. Mwakikagile, ibid., pp.&nbsp;97, 113; E. S. Grogan, in the ''East African Standard'', Nairobi, Kenya, 12 November 1910; [[Elspeth Huxley]], ''White Man\u2019s Country'', Vol. I, London and New York: Macmillan, 1935, pp.&nbsp;222 \u2013 223, 261 - 262; [[George Padmore]], ''Pan-Africanism or Communism?: The Coming Struggle for Africa'', London: Denis Dobson, 1956, pp.&nbsp;255, 256).\n\nThe humanity of Africans, and their lives, meant absolutely nothing to many whites, demonstrated by the injustices and indignities black people suffered under colonial rule. African children, even if not the primary target, sometimes witnessed their parents and other adults being humiliated by their colonial masters. It happened in Kenya, and in Tanganyika, Mwakikagile's home country, even when the countries were approaching independence; the fifties being one of the most critical periods in the history of colonial rule in Africa.\n\nSchool children who grew up in the fifties were among the victims in terms racial inequalities. The problem was compounded by inequities in the provision of funds and facilities for education. Meagre resources were allocated to education for African children in sharp contrast with the amount spent on schools for European and Asian children. The school Godfrey Mwakikagile attended was no exception. It was also the dawn of a new era in the history of Tanganyika.\n\nHe stated in his autobiographical works that the fifties which was a decade that preceded independence was a transitional period which symbolised the identity and partly shaped the thinking of those who grew up in those years as a product of both eras, colonial and post-colonial. They also served as a bridge between the two.\n\nGodfrey Mwakikagile also stated in his works, ''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'' and ''Life under British Colonial Rule'' among others, that it was in the same year he was bitten by the white couple's dog on his way to school that [[Princess Margaret]] visited Mbeya and Sao Hill in his home region, the Southern Highlands Province, as well as other parts of the country, in October 1956; a visit that symbolised British imperial rule over Tanganyika but also at a time when the nationalist movement was gaining momentum in the struggle for independence. The party that led the country to independence, [[Tanganyika African National Union]] (TANU), had been formed just two years before, in July 1954, and within months succeeded in mobilising massive support across the country in its quest to end colonial rule. Independence was inevitable.\n\nA few months after Princess Margaret visited Tanganyika, the Gold Coast became the first black African country to emerge from colonial rule as the new nation of Ghana in March 1957, blazing the trail for the African independence movement; while Tanganyika blazed the trail in East Africa four years later.\n\nGodfrey Mwakikagile has written about incidents of racial injustice and other subjects to show how life was in colonial Tanganyika in the fifties from the perspective of colonial subjects who hardly had any rights in their own country ruled and dominated by whites. Africans were lowest in the racial hierarchy, with Asians and Arabs ranked next to whites.\n\nBut in spite of his passionate defence of Africa, past and present, Mwakikagile is highly critical of some [[Afrocentric]] scholars who propagate myths about Africa's past and even reinvent the past just to glorify the continent, claiming spectacular achievements in the precolonial era in some areas where there were hardly any or none; for example, in advanced science, technology, and medicine. They also inflate achievements in some areas. He contends that \"true scholarship requires rigorous intellectual discipline and entails objective enquiry and analysis of facts and evidence including admitting failures and shortcomings.\" Otherwise you lose credibility, he contends. It is a position he forcefully articulates in ''Africa and The West'' and ''Africa is in A Mess: What Went Wrong and What Should be Done'', among other works.\n\nIt is a position that led one renowned Afrocentric Ghanaian political analyst and columnist Francis Kwarteng to describe Godfrey Mwakikagile as a \"Eurocentric Africanist\" in his article \"End of the Dilemma: The Tower of Babel,\" on GhanaWeb, 28 September 2013,  in which he discussed the role and the question of race, religion, and ethnicity in Ghana's politics and, by extension, in a Pan-African context including the [[African diaspora]]; which is a wrong characterisation of Mwakikagile since all his works are written from a purely African, not a [[Eurocentric]], perspective.\n\nIn his article, Francis Kwarteng also cited one of Godfrey Mwakikagile's books, ''Ethnic Politics in Kenya and Nigeria'', in his analysis of the role of ethnicity in national politics in Africa:\n\n\"[[Wole Soyinka]]...rightly admits in ''Of Africa'' that if America, a racist country at that, can elect a person of African ancestry, a black man of Luo ethnicity, president, then, he sees no reason Kenya shouldn't learn from that\u2014that precedent....Soyinka believes Kenya's democratic process must allow enough political space for the accommodation of ethnic diversification, so that qualified minorities can also partake in leadership positions, principally the presidency....But Soyinka's Nigeria has its own fair share of problems, a cornucopia of them. A truism flies across Nigeria's social and political landscape that Hausas are born natural rulers....Yet Nigeria has about 250 ethnic groups. So, what defines the criteria for Nigeria's multiethnic exclusivism from the presidential pie?....This is not unique to Nigeria, however. The same thing happened in Ghana and [[Uganda]], producing the likes of [[Idi Amin]]. This phenomenon is captured in the Eurocentric [[Africa]]nist Godfrey Mwakikagile's ''Ethnic Politics in Kenya and Nigeria''.\"\n\nIn another article on GhanaWeb, 15 October 2013, Francis Kwarteng also stated:\n\n\"We all know how Western material culture and unholy spiritualism are destroying Africa. Corruption in Africa is proliferating like cancerous cells in the body politic. Corrupt African politicians collaborate with Western banking officials to secrete the people's money in Western banks, monies, which, however you look at it, either fortunately for the West or unfortunately for Africa, are reinvested in Western national economies. So, in the long run Africa becomes positively poorer and the West negatively wealthier. Analytically, this runs counter to the central thesis of Rodney's [[How Europe Underdeveloped Africa]]. In fact, it's what the Eurocentric Africanist Godfrey Mwakikagile calls 'Africa in a Mess.' This inverse relationship of economic bilateralism is unhealthy and must be critically addressed by Africa.\"\n\nIt is a case of Africans themselves, especially the leaders, contributing to the underdevelopment of Africa. Bad leadership including corruption in African countries is one of the subjects Mwakikagile has addressed extensively in his books, especially in ''Africa is in A Mess: What Went Wrong and What Should be Done'', ''The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation'', ''Africa After Independence: Realities of Nationhood'', ''Africa at the End of the Twentieth Century: What Lies Ahead'', ''Statecraft and Nation Building in Africa: A Post-colonial Study'', ''Africa in Transition: Witness to Change'', and ''Post-colonial Africa: A General Survey''.\n\nHe contends that bad leadership is the biggest problem most African countries have faced since independence, and everything else revolves around it.\n\nAfricans of all ideological stripes agree corruption is one of the biggest problems African countries face. It is even acknowledged by some leaders. And a number of African scholars including Godfrey Mwakikagile have addressed the problem, proposing solutions to a seemingly intractable problem. As Francis Kwarteng stated in \"A Political Coin of Three Sides: What Do We Actually Want?\", GhanaWeb, 8 November 2013:\n\n\"Today's leadership has failed to show moral and social leadership in the face of mounting national crisis. Indeed corruption threatens the very future of the youth....President Mahama's book ''My First Coup D'\u00e9tat'' must be read in tandem with Wole Soyinka's ''The Open Sore of a Continent'', Ali Mazrui's ''The African Condition: A Political Diagnosis'', Molefi Kete Asante's ''Rooming in the Master's House'', and Godfrey Mwakikagile's ''Africa is in A Mess: What Went Wrong and What Should Be Done'' and ''Africa After Independence: Realities of Nationhood''. In fact, these bibliographies must be included in every secondary school curriculum as well as the curricula of teacher training institutions across the country. We may then use them as bibliographical platforms to ask students to come up with comprehensive solutions to our myriad national problems.\"\n\nAs he stated in another article, \"Africa Must Practice Its Own Democracy: A Moral Necessity,\" GhanaWeb, 17 October 2013:\n\n\"We were not the first to raise this question; others had before us! Celebrated prescient leaders like Kwame Nkrumah made this philosophical mantra part of their political platform, so were others \u2015 Patrice Lumumba, Amilcar Cabral, etc. Literacy scholars like Chinua Achebe, and [[Ngugi wa Thiong'o]]; international economists like [[Dambisa Moyo]] and Yaw Nyarko; political scientists like Ali Mazrui, Godfrey Mwakikagile, and [[Mahmood Mamdani]]; legal experts like Shadrack Gutto and Randall Robinson; world-renowned anthropologists and linguists like Cheikh Anta Diop and Th\u00e9ophile Obenga; and Afrocentrists like Molefi Kete Asante, Chinweizu, Maulana Karenga, and Ama Mazama had made similar arguments in the past few decades\u2015via their prolific scholarship, organizations, and political activism.\"\n\nOne of the problems Africa faces in nation building is how to achieve unity in diversity in countries composed of different ethnic groups and threatened by ethno-regional loyalties and rivalries. It is one of the subjects Godfrey Mwakikagile has addressed in his books.\n\n<!--One of the problems Africa faces in nation building and which African leaders have not adequately addressed is how to achieve unity in diversity in countries composed of different ethnic groups and threatened by ethno-regional loyalties and rivalries. It is one of the subjects Godfrey Mwakikagile has addressed in his books.-->Mwakikagile has written extensively about ethnicity and politics in Africa in the post-colonial era and how the two phenomena are inextricably linked in the African political context. He has used case studies in different analyses of the subject in different parts of the continent. One of his works, ''Ethnicity and National Identity in Uganda'', has been described by Tierney Tully as \"a great book, but very dense.\"\n\nMwakikagile's other books on the subject include ''Identity Politics and Ethnic Conflicts in Rwanda and Burundi: A Comparative Study''; ''Burundi: The Hutu and The Tutsi: Cauldron of Conflict and Quest for Dynamic Compromise''; ''Civil Wars in Rwanda and Burundi: Conflict Resolution in Africa''; ''Ethnic Diversity and Integration in The Gambia''; ''The People of Ghana: Ethnic Diversity and National Unity'', and ''Belize and Its Identity: A Multicultural Perspective'', re-published as ''British Honduras to Belize: Transformation of a Nation'',  a scholarly work on the Central American nation founded by the British colonial rulers and African slaves as [[British Honduras]] and which, culturally and historically, is considered to be an integral part of the [[Afro-Caribbean]] region, hence of the African diaspora. Although written by an African, the book is an important part of Afro-Caribbean literature.\n\nOne American journalist who interviewed Godfrey Mwakikagile described him as an independent scholar who was also a widely read and highly regarded author. Mwakikagile responded by saying that he was just an ordinary African, like tens of millions of others, deeply concerned about the plight of his continent. <!--But there is no question that he is a serious writer whose writings are widely read even if he considers himself to be just an ordinary African like millions of his brethren across the continent and elsewhere.-->\n\nIn his book ''African Political Thought'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012), Professor Guy Martin has described Godfrey Mwakikagile as one of Africa's leading populist scholars and thinkers who refuse to operate and function within the limits and confines of Western ideologies \u2013 or any other external parameters \u2013 and who exhort fellow Africans to find solutions to African problems within Africa itself and fight the syndrome of dependency in all areas and create a \"new African.\"\n\nProfessor Martin examines the political thought of leading African political thinkers throughout history dating back to ancient times (Kush/Nubia, sixth century BCE) and systematically introduces the reader to the ideas of specific theorists and their biographies. The thinkers and theorists he has examined include Julius Nyerere, [[Am\u00edlcar Cabral]], [[Kwame Nkrumah]], [[Cheikh Anta Diop]], [[Steve Biko]], [[Claude Ake]], and Godfrey Mwakikagile.\n\nProfessor Edmond J. Keller, chairman of the political science department, director of the UCLA Globalization Research Center-Africa and former director of the James S. Coleman African Studies Center at the University of California-Los Angeles, described Godfrey Mwakikagile as a \"public intellectual\" and an \"academic theorist\" in his review of Professor Guy Martin's book, ''African Political Thought''. The review was published in one of the leading academic journals on African research and studies, ''Africa Today'', Volume 60, Number 2, Winter 2013, Indiana University Press.\n\nProfessor Ryan Ronnenberg who wrote an article about Godfrey Mwakikagile as a prominent African scholar and writer in the ''Dictionary of African Biography'', ''Volume 6'' (Oxford University Press, 2011) covering the lives and legacies of notable African men and women since ancient times, edited by Harvard University professors, Emmanuel K. Akyeampong and Henry Louis Gates, Jr., stated that Mwakikagile has written major works of scholarship which have had a great impact in the area of African studies and continue to do so. He went on to state that Mwakikagile embraced Tanzania's independence, and the independence of the African continent as a whole, with fierce pride. 'I was too young to play a role in the independence movement, but old enough to know what Mau Mau in neighbouring Kenya was all about, and who our leaders were: from Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana to Julius Nyerere in Tanganyika; from Nnamdi Azikiwe in Nigeria to Jomo Kenyatta in Kenya and Patrice Lumumba in Belgian Congo' (''Africa and the West'', 2000).\n\nHis experience also inspired his thinking regarding Africa and its relationship to the Western world, which led to several academic works dedicated to the subject. Professor Ronnenberg further stated that Mwakikagile's early works focused on pressing issues in African studies, particularly the theory and realisation of development in Africa. ''Economic Development in Africa'' (1999) uses the rich case study of Tanzania's [[transition economy|transition from socialism to free-market capitalism]] as a foundation for broader conclusions concerning the continent's development failures.\n\nProfessor Ronnenberg also stated that Mwakikagile writes about Africa as a whole in such a way as to suggest that he possesses not only a keen understanding of the way things are, but also a deep understanding of the way they should be. The acerbically titled ''Africa Is in a Mess: What Went Wrong and What Should Be Done'' reflects on the decades since independence with pragmatism and regret, observing the loss of both leadership and ingenuity as the continent's intellectual elite settle abroad, while suggesting how this process might be reversed.\n \nIn fact, as the years have passed, and as those early optimistic moments after independence have slipped away, Mwakikagile has taken it upon himself to write about why Africa has fallen short of its vision. Professor Ronnenberg went on to state that Mwakikagile has translated his experience as a youth in colonial East Africa and his adulthood in postcolonial Tanzania into provocative scholarship concerning topics vitally important to African studies.\n\nMwakikagile's books are used in various academic disciplines up to the post-graduate level including doctoral studies. He has also been invited to give lectures at different colleges and universities. And as a public intellectual, he has also been sought for interviews by [[BBC]], [[PBS]] and [[Voice of America]] ([[VOA]]), among other media outlets.\n\nAlthough he has been exposed to Western cultures, was educated in the Western intellectual tradition and lived in the United States for many years, Mwakikagile's perspectives and philosophical conceptions have undoubtedly been shaped by his African upbringing and are deeply rooted in African cultures and traditions. And he rejects the notion that Africa was a blank slate until Europeans came to write on it. He argues that the history written about Africa by Europeans when they first went to Africa and even during colonial rule as well as after independence is not African history but the history of Europeans in Africa and how they see Africa and Africans from their European perspective.\n\nHe also contends that traditional Africa has produced philosophers and other original thinkers whose knowledge and ideas \u2013 including ideas at a high level of abstraction \u2013 can match and even surpass the best in the West and elsewhere in the world. He forcefully articulates that position in his book, ''Africa and The West''.<ref>Godfrey Mwakikagile, ''Africa and The West'', {{ISBN|9781560728405}}, Huntington, New York, 2001, pp.&nbsp;1\u201346, and 201\u2013218.</ref>\n\nAnd although he sees Africa as an indivisible whole, he argues that all nations, including those in Africa, have different national characters. He looks at the concept of national character in the African context in his book ''Kenya: Identity of A Nation'', and makes a compelling case for this idea, which is sometimes highly controversial. The work is, among other subjects, a study of comparative analysis in which the author looks at the national characters of Kenya and Tanzania<!--, thus demonstrating that nations do indeed have different national characters and have been that way throughout history-->. Kenyans themselves have had to grapple with questions of identity, ethnic versus national, and how to reconcile the two for the sake of national unity, peace and prosperity.\n\nTanzania is one of the few countries on the continent to have been spared the agony and scourge of ethnic conflicts, unlike Kenya which Mwakikagile has used for comparative analysis in looking at the identities of the two neighbouring countries. In his books, including ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'', he has also explained how Tanzania has been able to contain and even neutralise tribalism unlike other countries on the continent.\n\nMwakikagile has written extensively about tribalism, contending that it is one of the biggest problems Africa faces and is the source of instability in many countries on the continent, including civil wars.<!--\n\nHe undoubtedly has strong convictions but does not neatly fit into any ideological category.-->He expresses strong [[Pan-Africanist]] views in his writings and sees Africa as a collective entity and one organic body and has strongly been influenced by staunch Pan-Africanist leaders such as [[Kwame Nkrumah]], [[Julius Nyerere]], [[Ahmed Sekou Toure]] and [[Patrice Lumumba]] whom he also strongly admires.<ref>Godfrey Mwakikagile, ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'', 5th Edition, 2010. For Mwakikagile's Pan-Africanist views and perspectives, see also Professor Eric Edi of Temple University, \"Pan-West Africanism and Political Instability: Perspectives and Reflections,\" which cites Mwakikagile's books ''Military Coups in West Africa Since The Sixties'' and ''The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation''.</ref>\n\nHe also strongly admires [[Thomas Sankara]] as a man of the people like Nyerere and contends that among the new breed of African leaders, Sankara showed great promise but was eliminated by some of his so-called compatriots working for France and other Western powers before he could realise his full potential the same way Lumumba was, eliminated by the United States and Belgium. Mwakikagile has written about Sankara in ''Military Coups in West Africa Since The Sixties'' and in ''African Countries'' among other works.\n\nBut some of his critics contend that he overlooks or glosses over the shortcomings of these leaders precisely because they are liberation icons and played a leading role in the struggle for independence and against [[white minority rule]] in Southern Africa.<ref>Kwesi Johnson-Taylor, \"Author, a shrewd intellectual in defence of liberation icons,\" review of ''Nyerere and Africa'', amazon.com, 21 February 2006.</ref>\n\nHe also seems to be \"trapped\" in the past, in liberation days, especially in the 1970s when the struggle against white minority rule was most intense. But that may be for understandable reasons.<ref>''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era''.</ref> He was a part of that generation when the liberation struggle was going on and some of his views have unquestionably been shaped by what happened during those days as his admiration for [[Robert Mugabe]], for example, as a liberation icon clearly shows; although he also admits in ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'' that the land reform programme in [[Zimbabwe]] could have been implemented in an orderly fashion and in a peaceful way and without disrupting the economy.\n\nBut his admiration for Mugabe as a true [[African nationalist]] and Pan-Africanist remains intact, a position that does not sit well with some of his critics although he does not condone despotic rule. He admires Mugabe mostly as a [[freedom fighter]] and liberation hero who freed his people from [[colonial rule]] and racial oppression and exploitation, and as a strong leader who has taken a firm and an uncompromising stand against Western domination of Africa.\n \nBy remarkable contrast, his contempt for African leaders whom he sees as whites with a black skin also remains intact. He mentions Dr. [[Hastings Kamuzu Banda]] as a typical example of those leaders. He has written about Banda and other African leaders, among other subjects, in ''Africa After Independence: Realities of Nationhood''.<ref>Godfrey Mwakikagile, ''Africa After Independence: Realities of Nationhood'', 2006, pp.&nbsp;86, 91, 168\u2013171; Godfrey Mwakikagile, ''Africa 1960 \u2013 1970: Chronicle and Analysis'', 2009, p.&nbsp;510; Roger Pfister, ''Apartheid South Africa and African States: From Pariah to Middle Power, 1961\u20131994'', London/New York: I.B.

The OAU chose Tanzania to be the headquarters of the African liberation movements under the auspices of the OAU Liberation Committee which was based in Tanzania's capital Dar es Salaam.</ref>\n\n==Newspaper background==\nIn those days, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, was the headquarters of all the African liberation movements, under the leadership of President Julius Nyerere, and Mwakikagile got the chance to know many of the freedom fighters who were based there when he worked as a young news reporter in the nation's capital.<ref>''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'', pp.&nbsp;92\u201393. See also ''Nyerere and Africa'', pp.&nbsp;10\u201312, 65, 314, 363, 375, 484.</ref> They included Joaquim Chissano, who was the head of the [[FRELIMO]] office in Dar es Salaam, and later became the minister of foreign affairs and then president of Mozambique when his country won independence after 500 years of Portuguese colonial rule.<ref>''Nyerere and Africa'', pp.&nbsp;224, 487\u2013488; \"Newsman Leaves for America,\" ''Daily News'', 7 November 1972, p.&nbsp;3.</ref>\n\n<!--Many other freedom fighters who were based in Dar es Salaam also went on to become national leaders in their respective countries after the end of white minority rule in Southern Africa, and they all still have strong ties to Tanzania even today.-->\nIn his seminal work ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'', he has written extensively about the liberation struggle, and the liberation movements in Southern Africa in what is probably one of the best accounts of that critical phase in the history of Africa, as well as an excellent analysis of the [[Congo Crisis]] during the turbulent 1960s.\n\nMwakikagile has also written a book entitled ''South Africa in Contemporary Times'' (2008) about the struggle against apartheid and the end of white minority rule in South Africa and on the prospects and challenges the country faces in the post-apartheid era.\n\nThe years he spent on the editorial staff at the ''Standard'' and the ''Daily News'' were critical to his future career as a writer. Those were his formative years, and had he not become a news reporter, his life, and his career as an author, might have taken a different turn.\n\nAs he states in ''Nyerere and Africa'', he was first hired by renowned British journalist David Martin who was the deputy managing and news editor of the Tanganyika ''Standard''. The managing editor was Brendon Grimshaw, also British who, in the 1970s, bought Moyenne Island in the Seychelles and became its only permanent inhabitant. Brendon Grimshaw also played a major role in recruiting Mwakikagile as a member of the editorial staff at the ''Standard''.<ref>''Nyerere and Africa'', pp.&nbsp;360, 486. See also, \"Brendon Grimshaw Dead,\" ''Seychelles Nation'', Victoria, Seychelles, Thursday, 7 July 2012; \"Brendon Grimshaw is dead,\" ''Daily News'', Dar es Salaam, 7 July 2012.</ref>\n\nIt was a turning point in Mwakikagile's life. That was in June 1969 when he was a student at Tambaza High School in Dar es Salaam. He was 19 years old and probably the youngest reporter on the editorial staff at the ''Standard'' during that time.\n\nThe ''Standard'', the largest English newspaper in Tanzania and one of the largest and most influential in East Africa, served Mwakikagile well, not only in terms of providing him with an opportunity to sharpen his writing skills but also \u2013 after it became the ''Daily News'' in 1970 \u2013 in helping him to attend school in the United States, where he became an author many years after he graduated from college.\n\nDavid Martin, when he worked at the Tanganyika ''Standard'' and at the ''Daily News'', and thereafter, was the most prominent foreign journalist in Eastern and Southern Africa in the 1960s and '70s, and wrote extensively about the liberation struggle in the region for the London ''[[The Observer|Observer]]'' and the [[BBC]]. In ''Nyerere and Africa'', Mwakikagile has written about the role Martin played as a journalist during the liberation struggle in Southern Africa. But Martin was also instrumental in opening the door for Mwakikagile into the world of journalism, writing every day, after which both became successful writers.<ref>''Nyerere and Africa'', pp.&nbsp;486, 500, 569; ''My Life as an African: Autobiographical Writings'', pp.&nbsp;89, 156, 176, 375\u2013376, 378.</ref>\n\nAs Mwakikagile has stated in his books, including ''Nyerere and Africa'', ''Africa after Independence: Realities of Nationhood'', ''The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation'', ''Military Coups in West Africa Since The Sixties'' and in ''Africa is in A Mess: What Went Wrong and What Should Be Done'', his background as a news reporter, which included meeting deadlines when writing news articles, prepared him for the rigorous task of writing books.<!-- information repeated in Bibliography<ref>''Nyerere and Africa''; Godfrey Mwakikagile, ''Africa after Independence: Realities of Nationhood'', ISBN 9789987160143, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: New Africa Press, 2006; ''The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation'', ISBN 9781560729365, Huntington, NY: [[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]], 2001; ''Military Coups in West Africa Since The Sixties'', ISBN 9781560729457, Huntington, NY: Nova Science Publishers, Inc., 2001; ''Africa is in A Mess: What Went Wrong and What Should Be Done'', ISBN 0980253470, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: New Africa Press, 2006.</ref>-->\n\n==Criticism of post-colonial Africa==\n\nMwakikagile grew up under the leadership of [[Tanzanian President]] [[Julius Nyerere]], a staunch [[Pan-Africanist]] and one of the most influential leaders Africa has produced. In his writings, Mwakikagile has defended his socialist policies because of the egalitarian ideals they instilled in Tanzanians, despite the poverty they endured under [[ujamaa]], Nyerere's African version of socialism.\n\nMwakikagile, however, has been highly critical in his writings of other African leaders from the same generation who led their countries to independence. He has contended that most of them did not care about the well-being of their people.<ref>''Africa is in A Mess: What Went Wrong and What Should Be Done'', 2006; ''Africa After Independence: Realities of Nationhood'', {{ISBN|9789987160143}}, New Africa Press, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, 2006; ''The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation'', {{ISBN|9781560729365}}, [[Nova Science Publishers, Inc.]], Huntington, New York, 2001; ''Military Coups in West Africa Since the Sixties'', {{ISBN|9781560729457}}, Huntington, New York, 2001; ''Military Coups in West Africa Since the Sixties'', 2001.

He even wrote a book, ''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'', about those years.\n\nIndependence from Britain was very important to Mwakikagile. When he was 12 years old, his uncle took him to [[Tukuyu]] to participate in the independence celebrations when Tanganyika attained sovereign status under Nyerere. He witnessed the flags changing at midnight when the Union Jack was lowered and the flag of the newly independent Tanganyika went up. His recollections are stated in his book, ''My Life as an African: Autobiographical Writings''.\n\nEarly in his life when he was a teenager, he developed strong Pan-Africanist views under the influence of Nyerere and other Pan-Africanist leaders such as [[Kwame Nkrumah]] and [[Ahmed Sekou Toure]]. He still holds those views today, crystallised into an ideology for a new African liberation and forcefully articulated in his writings.\n\nAs Professor Guy Martin states in his book ''African Political Thought'' (pp.&nbsp;8, 6) about Mwakikagile and other Pan-Africanist theorists and thinkers, their individual national identities are secondary to their primary identity as Africans and even irrelevant when they articulate their position from a Pan-African perspective: \"Note that all these scholars are dedicated Pan-Africanists and many would shun the reference to their nationality, preferring to be simply called 'Africans'.... Some of the most prominent Africanist-populist scholars include... Godfrey Mwakikagile....\"\n\nOne of Mwakikagile's critics has described him as \"a shrewd intellectual in defence of liberation icons\" and accuses him of not being intellectually honest about leaders such as [[Nyerere]], Nkrumah and Sekou Toure for not criticising them harshly for their failures because he admires them so much as staunch Pan-Africanists.<ref>Kwesi Johnson-Taylor, \"Author, a shrewd intellectual in defence of liberation icons,\" in his review of Mwakikagile's book, ''Nyerere and Africa: End of an Era'', on amazon.com, 21 February 2006.</ref><!--\n\nIn a way, some people may see him as a complex character not always easy to understand, although he articulates his position clearly and forcefully.-->Some of the confusion among his readers about his position on African leaders of the independence generation has to do with his own background since he was an integral part of that generation in the sense that he witnessed the end of colonial rule and the emergence of the newly independent African states although he was not old enough to have participated in the independence struggle.<ref>''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'', pp.&nbsp;7\u20138.</ref>\n\nHe admires the leaders who led their countries to independence, yet he is highly critical of them in most cases for their failures during the post-colonial period. He became disillusioned with the leadership on the continent through the years, filled with broken promises, and not long after the countries won independence. He admires many aspects of Nyerere's socialist policies in Tanzania, yet concedes the policies were also a failure in many cases. And he strongly favours fundamental change in African countries, yet he is nostalgic about the past.<ref>''Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties'', pp.&nbsp;31 \u2013 32. See also ''Africa is in A Mess'' and ''Africa and The West''.</ref>\n\nHis advocacy for fundamental change is articulated in many of his writings including ''The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation'', which was published in 2001 and which is also one of his most well-known books.\n\nIn his review of the book, Ronald Taylor-Lewis [born of a Sierra Leonean father], editor of ''Mano Vision'' magazine, London, described it as \"a masterpiece of fact and analysis.\"<ref>Ronald Taylor-Lewis, in his review of Godfrey Mwakikagile, ''The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation'', in ''Mano Vision'', London, Issue 23, October 2001, pp.&nbsp;34\u201335. See also Professor Catherine S. M. Duggan, Department of Political Science, Stanford University, in her paper, \"Do Different Coups Have Different Implications for Investment? Some Intuitions and A Test With A New Set of Data,\" in which she cites Mwakikagile on fundamental changes in African countries. See also Godfrey Mwakikagile, cited in Christopher E. Miller, ''A Glossary of Terms and Concepts in Peace and Conflict Studies'', p.&nbsp;87; and in Gabi Hesselbein, Frederick Golooba-Mutebi, and James Putzel, \"Economic and Political Foundations of State-Making in Africa: Understanding State Reconstruction,\" ''Working Paper No. 3'', 2006.</ref>\n\nThe book has also been reviewed in other publications. Tana Worku Anglana reviewed Godfrey Mwakikagile's ''Modern African State: Quest for Transformation'' in ''Articolo'' and described it as \"unbiased literature.\"<ref>''The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation''; Wole Soyinka, ''The Open Sore of a Continent: A Personal Narrative of The Nigerian Crisis'', {{ISBN|9780195119213}}, Oxford University Press, 1997; Chinua Achebe, ''The Trouble with Nigeria'', {{ISBN|9789781561474}}, Enugu, Nigeria: Fourth Dimension Publishing Co., 2000.</ref>\n\nEthnic conflicts in [[Rwanda]] and Burundi between the [[Hutu]] and the [[Tutsi]] is one of the subjects Mwakikagile has addressed extensively in his book ''The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation''.\n\nIn many of his writings, Mwakikagile focuses on internal factors \u2013 including corruption, [[tribalism]] and tyranny \u2013 as the main cause of Africa's predicament, but not to the total exclusion of external forces.\n\nThe union of Tanganyika and Zanzibar and the Zanzibar revolution are subjects Mwakikagile has also addressed in detail in two of his other books: ''Why Tanganyika united with Zanzibar to form Tanzania'' and ''Africa in The Sixties''.\n\nAnd his diagnosis of \u2013 and prescription for \u2013 Africa's ailments has also been cited by scholars and other people for its relevance in other parts of the Third World. As Dr. Hengene Payani, a political scientist at the University of Papua New Guinea in [[Port Moresby]], [[Papua New Guinea]], stated in his review of Mwakikagile's book ''Africa is in A Mess'' on amazon.com, \"the book is excellent, honest and thought-provoking and is relevant even in the context of Papua New Guinea, a country which has been ruined by greedy politicians.\"<!-- He also contacted Mwakikagile to congratulate him for his work.-->\n\nAlthough he has written mostly about Africa, and as a political scientist or as a political analyst, his works cover a wide range of scholarship including American studies.\n\nBut there are limitations to the role played by people such as Godfrey Mwakikagile in their quest for fundamental change in African countries. Their contribution is limited in one fundamental respect: They are not actively involved with the masses at the grassroots level precisely because of what they are. They belong to an elite class, and the concepts they expound as well as the solutions they propose are discussed mainly by fellow elites but rarely implemented.\n\nAfrican writers such as Mwakikagile and other intellectuals are also severely compromised in their mission because most African leaders don't want to change. Therefore, they don't listen to them\u2014in many cases the entire state apparatus needs to be dismantled to bring about meaningful change.<ref>See also Ismail Rashid, a Sierra Leonian in exile in Canada, in the ''New African'', London, May 1992, p.&nbsp;10; Rashid Ismail in G.

R. Latigo, ''The Best Options for Africa: 11 Political, Economic and Divine Principles'', {{ISBN|9781426907678}}, Trafford Publishing, Victoria, BC, Canada, 2010, pp.&nbsp;114\u2013115; Senyo B-S.K.

But it is not the kind of effect that reverberates across the spectrum all the way down to the grassroots level precisely because they are not an integral part of the masses, and also because they are not actively involved with the masses to transform society.\n\nSo, while they generate ideas, they have not been able to effectively transmit those ideas to the masses without whose involvement fundamental change in Africa is impossible, except at the top, recycling the elite. And while they identify with the masses in terms of suffering and as fellow Africans, many of them \u2013 not all but many of them \u2013 have not and still do not make enough sacrifices in their quest for social and political transformation of African countries. Mwakikagile is fully aware of these shortcomings, and apparent contradictions, in the role played by the African elite. He's one himself.\n\nYet, he has not explicitly stated so in his writings concerning this problem of African intellectuals; a dilemma similar to the one faced by the black intelligentsia in the United States and which was addressed by [[Harold Cruse]], an internationally renowned black American professor who taught at the [[University of Michigan]] for many years, in his monumental study, ''The Crisis of The Negro Intellectual''. The book was first published in 1967 at the peak of the [[civil rights movement]], five years before Godfrey Mwakikagile went to the United States for the first time as a student.\n\nBut that does not really explain why he has not fully addressed the subject, the dilemma African intellectuals face in their quest for fundamental change, especially in his books \u2013 ''The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation'', ''Africa is in A Mess: What Went Wrong and What Should Done'', and ''Africa After Independence: Realities of Nationhood'' \u2013 which are almost exclusively devoted to such transformation in Africa in the post-colonial era.\n\nStill, Mwakikagile belongs to a group of African writers and the African elite who believe that the primary responsibility of transforming Africa lies in the hands of the Africans themselves, and not foreigners, and that acknowledgement of mistakes by African leaders is one of the first steps towards bringing about much-needed change in African countries; a position he forcefully articulates in his writings. For example, Political Science Professor Claude E. Welch at the State University of New York-Buffalo, in his review of one of Mwakikagile's books \u2013 ''Military Coups in West Africa Since The Sixties'' \u2013 published in the ''African Studies Review'' (Vol. 45, No. 3, December 2002, p.&nbsp;114), described the author as being merciless in his condemnation of African tyrants.<!--And that is valid criticism of African leadership in post-colonial Africa by Godfrey Mwakikagile. Corrupt and despotic rulers don't deserve mercy. They don't deserve sympathy. They are not entitled to it. They have destroyed Africa.-->\n\n== Vision for an African Federal Government ==\nMwakikagile advocates for a closer union within Africa in the form of an African confederation or African federal government starting with economic integration, leading to an African common market, and eventually, resulting in a political union. Concretely, he proposed the following plan for a Union of African states: \"If the future of Africa lies in federation, that federation could even be a giant federation of numerous autonomous units which have replaced the modern African state in order to build, on a continental or sub-continental scale, a common market, establish a common currency, a common defense and maybe even pursue a common foreign policy under some kind of central authority - including collective leadership on rotational basis - which Africans think is best for them\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Modern_African_State.html?id=zw6PgwJVaMwC|title=The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation|last=Mwakikagile|first=Godfrey|date=2001-01-01|publisher=Nova Publishers|isbn=9781560729365|language=en}}</ref>\n\nMwakikagile identifies the type of government best suited for the African situation as a ''democracy by consensus,'' which, in his view, would allow all social, ethnic and regional factions to freely express themselves. Such a democracy should take the form of a government of national unity, inclusive of both the winners and the losers in the electoral process, and would entail a multiparty system approved by national referendum; it should also be based on extreme decentralization down to the lowest grassroots level to enable the masses, not just the leaders and the elite, to participate in formulating policies and making decisions which affect their lives. That is the only way it can be a people's government and federation that belongs to the masses and ordinary citizens instead of being a government and federation of only the elite and professional politicians. Let the people decide. He has elaborated on that in his other books, ''Africa at the End of the Twentieth Century: What Lies Ahead'' and ''Restructuring The African State and Quest for Regional Integration: New Approaches''.\n\nHe also believes that in this democratic system the tenure of the president must be limited to one term (preferably five to six years), and the tenure of the members of the national legislatures to two three-year terms.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/African_Political_Thought.html?id=rqYEhtONIBgC|title=African Political Thought|last=Martin|first=G.|date=2012-12-23|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137062055|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nIn what is probably his most controversial book, ''Africa is in A Mess: What Went Wrong and What Should Be Done'', Mwakikagile strongly criticises most of the leaders of post-colonial Africa for tyranny and corruption, and for practising tribalism, a common theme in the works of many African writers and other people including well-known ones and many African scholars in and outside Africa. But his book stands out as one of the most blunt ever written about Africa's rotten leadership.\n\nUnfortunately, because of its vitriolic condemnation of most African leaders during the post-colonial era, the book has been cited by some people as a clarion call for the re-colonisation of Africa although the author says exactly the opposite in his work.<ref>Dr. Kenday Samuel Kamara of Walden University in his abstract \"Considering the Enormity of Africa's Problems, is Re-Colonization an Option?\" cites ''Africa is in A Mess: What Went Wrong and What Should Be Done'' and related works by other African leading academic authors, including Professor Ali Mazrui, and Professor George Ayittey's ''Africa in Chaos''. See also Tunde Obadina, \"The Myth of Neo-Colonialism,\" in ''Africa Economic Analysis'', 2000; and Timothy Murithi, ''The African Union: Pan-Africanism, Peacebuilding and Development''.</ref>\n\nYet in spite of all that, Mwakikagile unequivocally states in ''Africa is in A Mess'' that he does not support any attempt or scheme, by anybody, to recolonise Africa, but also bluntly states that African countries have lost their sovereignty to donor nations and multilateral institutions such as the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) dominated by Western powers including those who once colonised Africa and are therefore virtual colonies already.\n\nThe premier of Western Cape Province in South Africa, [[Helen Zille]], in her speech in the provincial parliament on 28 March 2017, also cited Godfrey Mwakikagile's analysis of the impact of colonial rule on Africa in defence of her tweets which her critics said were a defence of colonialism and even called for her resignation. She said her analysis was the same as Mwakikagile's and those of other prominent people including Nelson Mandela, Chinua Achebe, Ali Mazrui, and former Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and wondered why she faced so much criticism when she made exactly the same point they did.\n\nMwakikagile also contends that African countries have really never been free in spite of the instruments of sovereignty they are supposed to have. He also warns about the dangers of the Second Scramble for Africa by the industrialised nations which are busy exploiting Africa's resources for their own benefit and contends that globalisation is in many ways a new form of imperialism.\n\nYet he has wrongly been portrayed, along with some prominent African and European scholars including Professor [[Ali Mazrui]], [[Christoph Blocher]], [[Mahmood Mamdani]], Peter Niggli, and R. W. Johnson, as someone who advocates the recolonisation of Africa.<ref>Professor Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gatsheni, a Zimbambwean teaching international studies at Monash University, South Africa campus, in his abstract \"Gods of Development, Demons of Underdevelopment and Western Salvation: A Critique of Development Discourse as a Sequel to the CODESRIA and OSSREA International Conferences on Development in Africa\" (June 2006), advances the same argument as Mwakikagile and cites ''Africa is in A Mess'' to support his thesis. See also Floyd Shivambu, \"Floyd's Perspectives: Societal Tribalism in South Africa,\" 1 September 2005, who cites Mwakikagile's ''Ethnic Politics in Kenya and Nigeria'', in his condemnation of tribalism in post-apartheid South Africa; Mary Elizabeth Flournoy of Agnes Scott College, in her paper \"Nigeria: Bounded by Ropes of Oil,\" citing Mwakikagile's writings, including ''Ethnic Politics in Kenya and Nigeria''; Professor Eric Edi of Temple University, in his paper, \"Pan West Africanism and Political Instability: Perspectives and Reflections,\" citing Mwakikagile's books ''Military Coups in West Africa Since The Sixties'' and ''The Modern African State: Quest for Transformation''.</ref>\n\nMwakikagile says exactly the opposite in ''Africa is in A Mess''. In fact, the title, although not the sub-title, comes from President Julius Nyerere who used exactly the same words in 1985: \"Africa is in a mess.\" Mwakikagile explicitly states that he got the title from Nyerere's statement and felt it was appropriate for his work, although the tone and content might be disturbing to some people. He is brutally frank about the continent's deplorable condition.\n\nAnd in the same book, Mwakikagile is also highly critical of Western powers for ruthlessly exploiting Africa even today in collusion with many African leaders.\n\nHis harsh criticism of bad leadership on the African continent prompted Ghanaian columnist and political analyst Francis Kwarteng to put him in the same category with George Ayittey, a Ghanaian professor of economics at The American University, Washington, D.C., and author of ''Africa Betrayed'' and ''Africa in Chaos'', among other books.\n\n==Academic reviews==\nMwakikagile's books have been reviewed in a number of academic publications, including the highly prestigious academic journal ''African Studies Review'', by leading scholars in their fields. They include ''Military Coups in West Africa Since The Sixties'', which was reviewed in that journal by Professor Claude E.

Sahara has claimed that the said bonds are hybrid product, thus does not come under the jurisdiction of SEBI, instead is governed by Registrar of Companies (ROC) under Ministry of Corporate Affairs, from which the two companies of Sahara has already taken permission and submitted the red herring prospectus with ROC before issuing the bonds.\n\nSEBI in return ordered Sahara's two companies to stop issuing the said bonds and return money to investors. Sahara contested the case in various courts which eventually came to Supreme Court of India. On 14 June 2012, (during the final hearing of the case), the group had provided details of its financials up to 30 April 2012. While the court reserved its order, Sahara claims that it has already paid to 95% of the investors and discharged its OFCD liability to the tune of Rs. 23500 crores and only around Rs. 2260.69 crores are left against which Sahara has already deposited more than Rs. 12,000 crore which has with interest swelled to Rs. 16000 Crore. By 31 August 2012 the date of Supreme Court order, the group repaid majority of its OFCD investors between May the last date of hearing and by 30 August 2012 the final order. Since these repayments have not been taken into consideration, Sahara maintains that any money paid now will obviously mean a double payment towards one liability.\n\nIt is also been reported that Sahara has paid Rs 725.97 crore as TDS (tax deducted at source) to the Income Tax Departments on the interest which along with investment was repaid to 95 percent of the investors, between 2009\u201310 and 2012\u201313. The income tax authorities had found that the beneficiary investors were existent and accordingly confirmed the repayments made in those particular years. One of Sahara's arguments in the apex court revolves around the fact that if one government body has found investors, why can't the other.<ref name=\"firstpost.com\"/>\n\nThe case itself comprises big numbers such as collection of over Rs 24,000 crore from three crore individuals, while once in 2013 Sahara sent 127 trucks containing 31,669 cartons full of over three crore application forms and two crore redemption vouchers to Sebi office. Apparently, this had resulted into a huge traffic jam on outskirts of Mumbai, where the regulator is headquartered. SEBI on the other hand because the trucks reached after office hours SEBI rejected the second batch of files, which as per Sahara contained 25% of the investor information.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Sahara-to-get-truckloads-of-papers-back-from-Sebi/articleshow/50989184.cms|title=Sahara to get truckloads of papers back from Sebi|publisher=Times Of India|accessdate= 15 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the market regulator SEBI advertised four times in more than 144 newspapers to ask the investors of Sahara to refund the money. And since August 2012 Sebi has only refunded Rs. 64 crore to the investors while it has Rs. 16000 crore from Sahara. On October 2014, a shocking revelation was made when only around 4,600 investors in two Sahara group companies had come forward to claim refunds from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which had asked those who had purchased bonds issued by the entities to claim their money. This gave a valid point to Sahara's argument before courts that it had repaid most of the investors who had come forward to claim the investment which they had made in bonds issued by two group companies.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/4600-Sahara-investors-claim-refund-from-Sebi/articleshow/44765138.cms|title=4,600 Sahara investors claim refund from Sebi|publisher=Times Of India|accessdate= 10 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nReports also suggested that between the time that SEBI first initiated the inquiry four years ago and Roy's eventual detention and it is to note that till today there is not a single charge against him, there has not been a single instance of an investor in either of the two Sahara firms under watch actually filing a police complaint or going to court.<ref>{{cite web|url= \nhttp://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/subrata-roy-arrest-row-the-not-so-beautiful-story/|title=Subrata Roy arrest row: The not-so-beautiful story|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate= 9 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nHe was granted interim bail by the Supreme Court on 26 March 2014 on the condition that he would deposit the huge bail amount of Rs 10,000 crore.<ref>{{cite web|title=SC grants conditional bail to Sahara chief Subrata Roy|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-grants-conditional-bail-to-Sahara-chief-Subrata-Roy/articleshow/32719977.cms|publisher=[[Times of India]]|accessdate=26 March 2014}}</ref> Subrata was eventually taken into judicial custody and sent to [[Tihar jail]], along with two other Sahara directors, on 4 March 2014 for failing to deposit Rs 10,000 crore with SEBI.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/subrata-roy-sent-to-tihar-jail-full-text-of-sc-order-on-sahara-case-1419081.html|title=Subrata Roy sent to Tihar jail: Full text of SC order on Sahara case|newspaper=First Post|date=4 March 2014|accessdate=1 August 2016}}</ref> In Tihar jail, Subrata unsuccessfully tried to sell some of his hotel properties to raise Rs 10,000 crore for his bail bond.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/From-Tihar-jail-Sahara-chief-Subrata-Roy-tries-to-sell-the-New-York-Plaza/articleshow/39987868.cms|title=From Tihar jail, Sahara chief Subrata Roy tries to sell the New York Plaza|newspaper=Times of India |date=10 August 2014|accessdate=20 August 2014}}</ref> He remained in Tihar jail for more than two years, and was released on parole in May 2016 to attend the last rites of his deceased mother.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sahara-chief-subrata-roy-gets-4week-parole-for-mothers-funeral/article8565838.ece|title=SC grants four-week parole to Sahara chief|work=The Hindu|date=7 May 2016|accessdate=1 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 July 2018, the group revealed that majority of Rs 20,000 crore of Sahara's money (including the interest) which is with SEBI will be refunded back to Sahara India as the group had already made majority of the payments to its investors.

Sahara has claimed that the said bonds are hybrid product, thus does not come under the jurisdiction of SEBI, instead is governed by Registrar of Companies (ROC) under Ministry of Corporate Affairs, from which the two companies of Sahara has already taken permission and submitted the red herring prospectus with ROC before issuing the bonds.\n\nSEBI in return ordered Sahara's two companies to stop issuing the said bonds and return money to investors. Sahara contested the case in various courts which eventually came to Supreme Court of India. On 14 June 2012, (during the final hearing of the case), the group had provided details of its financials up to 30 April 2012. While the court reserved its order, Sahara claims that it has already paid to 95% of the investors and discharged its OFCD liability to the tune of Rs. 23500 crores and only around Rs. 2260.69 crores are left against which Sahara has already deposited more than Rs. 12,000 crore which has with interest swelled to Rs. 16000 Crore. By 31 August 2012 the date of Supreme Court order, the group repaid majority of its OFCD investors between May the last date of hearing and by 30 August 2012 the final order. Since these repayments have not been taken into consideration, Sahara maintains that any money paid now will obviously mean a double payment towards one liability.\n\nIt is also been reported that Sahara has paid Rs 725.97 crore as TDS (tax deducted at source) to the Income Tax Departments on the interest which along with investment was repaid to 95 percent of the investors, between 2009\u201310 and 2012\u201313. The income tax authorities had found that the beneficiary investors were existent and accordingly confirmed the repayments made in those particular years. One of Sahara's arguments in the apex court revolves around the fact that if one government body has found investors, why can't the other.<ref name=\"firstpost.com\"/>\n\nThe case itself comprises big numbers such as collection of over Rs 24,000 crore from three crore individuals, while once in 2013 Sahara sent 127 trucks containing 31,669 cartons full of over three crore application forms and two crore redemption vouchers to Sebi office. Apparently, this had resulted into a huge traffic jam on outskirts of Mumbai, where the regulator is headquartered. SEBI on the other hand because the trucks reached after office hours SEBI rejected the second batch of files, which as per Sahara contained 25% of the investor information.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Sahara-to-get-truckloads-of-papers-back-from-Sebi/articleshow/50989184.cms|title=Sahara to get truckloads of papers back from Sebi|publisher=Times Of India|accessdate= 15 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the market regulator SEBI advertised four times in more than 144 newspapers to ask the investors of Sahara to refund the money. And since August 2012 Sebi has only refunded Rs. 64 crore to the investors while it has Rs. 16000 crore from Sahara. On October 2014, a shocking revelation was made when only around 4,600 investors in two Sahara group companies had come forward to claim refunds from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which had asked those who had purchased bonds issued by the entities to claim their money. This gave a valid point to Sahara's argument before courts that it had repaid most of the investors who had come forward to claim the investment which they had made in bonds issued by two group companies.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/4600-Sahara-investors-claim-refund-from-Sebi/articleshow/44765138.cms|title=4,600 Sahara investors claim refund from Sebi|publisher=Times Of India|accessdate= 10 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nReports also suggested that between the time that SEBI first initiated the inquiry four years ago and Roy's eventual detention and it is to note that till today there is not a single charge against him, there has not been a single instance of an investor in either of the two Sahara firms under watch actually filing a police complaint or going to court.<ref>{{cite web|url= \nhttp://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/subrata-roy-arrest-row-the-not-so-beautiful-story/|title=Subrata Roy arrest row: The not-so-beautiful story|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate= 9 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nHe was granted interim bail by the Supreme Court on 26 March 2014 on the condition that he would deposit the huge bail amount of Rs 10,000 crore.<ref>{{cite web|title=SC grants conditional bail to Sahara chief Subrata Roy|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/SC-grants-conditional-bail-to-Sahara-chief-Subrata-Roy/articleshow/32719977.cms|publisher=[[Times of India]]|accessdate=26 March 2014}}</ref> Subrata was eventually taken into judicial custody and sent to [[Tihar jail]], along with two other Sahara directors, on 4 March 2014 for failing to deposit Rs 10,000 crore with SEBI.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/subrata-roy-sent-to-tihar-jail-full-text-of-sc-order-on-sahara-case-1419081.html|title=Subrata Roy sent to Tihar jail: Full text of SC order on Sahara case|newspaper=First Post|date=4 March 2014|accessdate=1 August 2016}}</ref> In Tihar jail, Subrata unsuccessfully tried to sell some of his hotel properties to raise Rs 10,000 crore for his bail bond.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/From-Tihar-jail-Sahara-chief-Subrata-Roy-tries-to-sell-the-New-York-Plaza/articleshow/39987868.cms|title=From Tihar jail, Sahara chief Subrata Roy tries to sell the New York Plaza|newspaper=Times of India |date=10 August 2014|accessdate=20 August 2014}}</ref> He remained in Tihar jail for more than two years, and was released on parole in May 2016 to attend the last rites of his deceased mother.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sahara-chief-subrata-roy-gets-4week-parole-for-mothers-funeral/article8565838.ece|title=SC grants four-week parole to Sahara chief|work=The Hindu|date=7 May 2016|accessdate=1 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 July 2018, the group revealed that majority of Rs 20,000 crore of Sahara's money (including the interest) which is with SEBI will be refunded back to Sahara India as the group had already made majority of the payments to its investors. The group also stated that SEBI will be directed to start the verification of the documents of Sahara's investors, which are already provided to them by Sahara India Pariwar.

{"title_page": "Cooper River Bridge Run", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=August 2018}}\nThe '''Cooper River Bridge Run''' is an annual {{convert|10|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}} event [[road running]] designed to steal money from runners in the name of 'charity'.[[Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge]] It is held in the cities of [[Mount Pleasant, South Carolina|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] in [[South Carolina]], on the first Saturday in August (had been first Sunday of April in 1978, first Saturday in April from 1979 to 2019, unless that Saturday is [[Holy Week]], race moved to August in 2020). The Bridge Run is the only competition in South Carolina sanctioned by [[USA Track and Field]] as an elite event.  Based on number of race finishers, the event is the third largest 10K and the fifth largest road race in the [[United States]].<ref>http://results.xacte.com/?kw=crb#</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nIn the mid-1970s, [[Medical University of South Carolina]] employee Dr. Marcus Newberry had visited his [[Ohio]] hometown and noticed Bonne Bell had built a running track around their offices to encourage employees' physical fitness.  Dr. Newberry wanted a way to encourage fitness in the Charleston Metropolitan region, and believed the best way was to feature an event running through the bridges crossing the [[Cooper River (South Carolina)|Cooper River]].  The event organisers featured officials from the Charleston Running Club, [[The Citadel (Military College)|The Citadel]], the [[Medical University of South Carolina]], and the [[College of Charleston]].\n\n[[South Carolina Senate|South Carolina state senator]] Dewey Wise introduced legislation to permit the event to be held over the [[reversible lane]] on the three-lane Silas Pearman Bridge.\n\nOn April 2, 1978, the initial race began from Patriots Point in Mount Pleasant to the White Point Gardens in Charleston's [[Battery Park (Charleston)|Battery]] region.  Police shortened the initial event to 9,850 meters after the gun had sounded to start the initial Bridge Run. Officials expected 500 runners for the event (with 340 pre-registered), but on race day an additional 600 to 700 runners registered.  766 runners finished. Many dropped out of the race and some were hospitalized for effects from the heat, as there were no [[water stop (sports)|water stop]]s on the course. In the tradition of historic Charleston's Civil War and Revolutionary War heritage, a cannon is fired to start the event. The first [[Kenya]]n runners to participate were a pair of [[Charleston Southern University|Baptist College]] teammates in 1978.  Runners from that country have dominated the run since 1993.\n\nFollowing complaints from heat exhaustion and also from area churches (While Charleston County has some Blue Laws exceptions in Charleston County in deference to the Jewish community, churches on the course complained about the Bridge Run taking place while church services took place), the 1979 event was moved to the Saturday in March, where it would be held until 1985.  One water stop at the terminus of the bridge was added.  (Four water stops were on the 2005 course.)  The finish line moved to the campus of the [[College of Charleston]].  Over 1,350 were entered, with over 1,000 finishing. The 1979 event, the first at 10,000 meters, was the first South Carolina running event with over 1,000 participants. The 1980 finish ended in a tie.\n\nTwo consecutive Bridge Runs (1986 and 1987) were marred by illegal runners.  In 1986, between 300 and 500 runners did not make the start, which had been delayed 30 minutes because of a vehicular collision on the Pearman Bridge (the only access to the start line) between two shuttle buses carrying runners to the start and an automobile 70 minutes before the scheduled start.  They ran down the Pearman, through the cut between the two bridges, and started their run midway through the course, on the Grace.\n\nIn 1987, with unusually cold temperatures (start temperature was 39 degrees Fahrenheit (4c) with wind gusts from 20-35 MPH (32\u201355&nbsp;km/h), runners kept their warmups instead of displaying their bibs.  Officials estimated about 10% of the nearly 7,000 runners who crossed the finish lines were illegal, or \"bandit\", runners.  The bandits were allowed to cross the finish line because officials could not distinguish who was legitimate and who was not.\n\nIn 1989, elite runners were warming up ahead of the start line on SC 703 when the cannon fired.  Grete Waitz's record time was disallowed, but she was allowed to keep the win, when she was caught ahead of the start line at the cannon.\n\nThe 1995 event was the first time over 10,000 runners participated, and women made up over 3,000 of the runners, the first time in North or South Carolina where over 3,000 women finished in a running event.\n\nTransponder timing was instituted in 1997.  The 2005-2008 races featured a permanent transponder which the runner could keep was implemented.  A D-Tag timing system was used from 2009\u201310, and from 2011, transponder tags were affixed to competitors' bibs.\n\nThe total Bridge Run and Walk participants in 2004 was 29,930.  Females accounted for 45.1% of finishers.\n\nIn 2012, logistical problems (only one shuttle bus entry point) led to over 10,000 runners being stuck on the shuttle buses on the Ravenel's northbound lanes (which the course uses) where officials could not close the bridge until 7:45 AM, 15 minutes before the scheduled start.  The race was delayed to an 8:19 start time for the wheelchair division and an 8:59 start for the elite runners as result.\n\nThe last run on the Pearman in 2005 had a 42,000 runner and walker cap (25,000 runners, 17,000 walkers) for 2005, but many did not appear because of inclement weather which marred the start.  The current limit is 44,000. The 2012 race featured 36,652 finishers, women dominated with 59.45% (21,789 F vs 14,917 M) of runners.\n\n==Course and event changes==\n\nThe scheduled start time was 10 AM in 1978, 9 AM from 1979 until 1982, 8:30 AM in 1983 until 1986, and 8 AM until 2019. Two unusual start delays caused by the unfamiliar course moved the 1984 start to 9 AM.  The 2020 race will start at 7 AM with a wheelchair start at 6:30 AM.\n\nThe [[John P. Grace Memorial Bridge]] had been declared unsafe for heavy trucks over ten tons in 1979, and the [[South Carolina Department of Transportation]] eliminated the reversible lane on the [[Silas N. Pearman Bridge]] which had been used for the Bridge Run course, as trucks on [[US Highway 17]] South were now required to use that lane, instead of using the Grace.  State Senator Wise was able to push for legislation to use the Grace bridge for the Bridge Run, SC Statue 56-5-3880.\n\nIn 1983, the Grace Bridge run added a second uphill climb on the Crosstown Overpass connecting the Grace Bridge to US Highway 17 and [[Interstate 26]], and the race finished in front of the United States Federal Building in Marion Square at Meeting Street.  With the number of entrants exceeding 2,000, the start moved from Patriots Point in 1984 to SC Highway 703 (Coleman Boulevard) at Shem Creek.  This course became the first Bridge Run course to be certified by [[USA Track and Field|The Athletics Congress]].\n\nRoad construction near Market Street in Charleston forced a slight rerouting in 1986, when the Bridge Run was moved to its present date in April unless Easter fell on that weekend.\n\nWith entrants exceeding 8,500 and a new 7,000 meter walk added, totaling over 10,000 participants, and tighter restrictions on weight on the Grace Bridge, in 1995 officials returned the Bridge Run to the Pearman bridge, with all three lanes being used, as traffic to Charleston could now be diverted to the [[Don N. Holt Bridge]] near Daniel Island on [[Interstate 526]], which had opened in 1992.  A new start line on SC 703 near Live Oak Street was positioned with runners passing Coming, Line, King, Market, and Meeting at Marion Square.  With congestion becoming a concern, a year later officials moved back the finish to the corner of Meeting and Calhoun in Marion Square, resulting in a corresponding move back of the start on SC 703.\n\nIn 2000, the Bridge Run course went through a complete overhaul with the start further back on SC 703 near the shopping center, giving runners a 3,000 meter run on SC 703 before joining the walkers at the foot of the first span of the Pearman, then crossing the Crosstown Overpass, King Street, Calhoun Street, and finishing at Alexander.  The course eliminated the use of Meeting Street, which had been used as the primary street in the past.  This course would be used until 2005, when the Pearman and Grace bridges closed.\n\nIn 2003, a youth event was held on the Friday at Hampton Park to expand the festivities.\n\nMajor alterations to the course were necessary for 2006 as [[USA Track and Field]] had to measure a new course to reflect the opening of the [[Arthur Ravenel, Jr. Bridge]] and construction on the Ansonborough Fields complex resulted in the moving of the finish line away from Alexander Street, where it had been set since 2000, and a new finish line at George Street and Meeting Street, across from the [[Carolina First Arena]] in Charleston, was established.  The finish festival was held at Marion Square, which is located a short walk as runners made the cooldown from the finish line.\n\nThe start line was slightly moved but remains near the shopping center, and proceeds on SC 703 for 3,000 meters before approaching the northbound exit ramp to SC 703 (run southbound, towards Charleston, the opposite direction of normal vehicular traffic), with the runners proceeding on the [[Arthur Ravenel, Jr. Bridge]] southbound on the four northbound lanes (the four southbound lanes on the bridge are not used;  furthermore, the bike-pedestrian lane (which is aligned with the northbound lanes, but just off to East Bay Street and is not part of the course) is reserved for use by emergency staff) for 3,200 meters before exiting the bridge using the two-lane Meeting Street entrance ramp (runners are running the opposite direction of normal vehicular traffic), turning left on Meeting for 2,000 meters before, making a right at the Visitor's Center at John Street, then a quick left at King Street, before turning left at Wentworth Street, before a final run up Meeting Street the other direction before the finish line.\n\nTwo potential forms of cheating near the finish were dealt with using fencing at Marion Square at King Street (the finish festival site), and sponsor Bi-Lo parking a tractor-trailer at the intersection of Meeting and John to force runners to make the turn back to King.  Furthermore, the live bands which play at the finish festival will be heard twice, as runners pass through Marion Square the first time on King Street, and after crossing the finish line and cooling down.\n\nConcerns over bottlenecking by walkers on course who entered the bridge walk at the 3,000 meter mark on Coleman Boulevard at Patriots Point (the original start line) and the [[WCBD|NBC 2 studios]] eliminated the 7,000 meter walk, and required walkers to proceed through the entire 10,000 meter run starting in 2006.  However, the rule was not as enforced as some had thought.  Some walkers (and lower-seeded runners too) lined up on the sidewalks on SC 703 from Shem Creek to that studio, which is at the foot of the exit ramp from the bridge, instead of lining behind all runners at the start line, which was the instruction given to participants in the 2006 event in order to prevent incidents.\n\nAnother rule change in 2006 required runners to be seeded by time;  elite and invited runners were ahead, then runners in the under 40 minute category, then 40-50, 50-60, past one hour, and walkers.  The main goal was to prevent certain bottlenecking, although some bottlenecking did take place at the start line because of the transponder timing system.\n\nThe 2006 event also debuted the wheelchair category as a competitive event;  twelve wheelchair and crankchair athletes competed in the event, which started at 7:30 AM, although Manny Marshall attempted to complete the course in a wheelchair by entering at the Chanel 2 studios at the 3km point.\n\nFor 2010 the turn from Meeting to King was changed from John Street to Wolfe Street, to avoid Piggly Wiggly #1 (a direct competitor to race sponsor Bi-Lo, although Bi-Lo later purchased this location in 2013), and to allow the bars to have bands perform.  One notable performer was Dave Seitz and the King Street Band, fronted by the popular former [[South Carolina Stingrays]] player whose #14 is retired.\n\nStarting with the 2011 event, a wave start system is utilized to better handle crowding in the Mount Pleasant.\n\nThe 2020 race will be the first race to be held in the summer, as the Bridge Run moved to an August date.\n\n==Competitors==\nInitially, the race attracted national-level runners. Benji Durden, whose opportunity to make the Olympic team was denied by President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1980, won the first run. [[Frank Shorter]] and [[Ruth Wysocki]] ran in the early 1980s and Olympians [[Mark Conover]] and [[Janis Klecker]] were participants in the early 1990s. The race has featured top level international competitors, including Olympic medalists [[Grete Waitz]], [[Catherine Ndereba]], and [[Elana Meyer]].\n\nOutside of elite runners, the run has also featured people prominent in other cultural spheres. Television personality [[Oprah Winfrey]], running under a  [[pseudonym]], finished the 1994 race (3,839th with a time of 55:48 min). Actor [[Bill Murray]] fired the cannon for the 1997 Bridge Run and ran the event.  In 2011, then-[[NASCAR Nationwide Series]] driver [[Aric Almirola]], his wife Janice, and two members of the [[JR Motorsports]] #88 team from the 2011 season participated during an off-week in that series,  and former state Governor [[Mark Sanford]] and two of his children also participated. Irish Olympic runner [[Sean Dollman]], who retired after taking a job at the [[College of Charleston]], came out of retirement at the Bridge Run and won the Dr. Marcus Newberry Award for best runner residing in the Charleston metropolitan region (Charleston, Berkeley, Dorchester counties) in 2002. In 2012, [[Zeddie Little]] became an internet meme known as the \"ridiculously photogenic guy\" after having a photo of him taken by Will King while running the race.\n\n==Past

The Bridge Run is the only competition in South Carolina sanctioned by [[USA Track and Field]] as an elite event.  Based on number of race finishers, the event is the third largest 10K and the fifth largest road race in the [[United States]].<ref>http://results.xacte.com/?kw=crb#</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nIn the mid-1970s, [[Medical University of South Carolina]] employee Dr. Marcus Newberry had visited his [[Ohio]] hometown and noticed Bonne Bell had built a running track around their offices to encourage employees' physical fitness.  Dr. Newberry wanted a way to encourage fitness in the Charleston Metropolitan region, and believed the best way was to feature an event running through the bridges crossing the [[Cooper River (South Carolina)|Cooper River]].  The event organisers featured officials from the Charleston Running Club, [[The Citadel (Military College)|The Citadel]], the [[Medical University of South Carolina]], and the [[College of Charleston]].\n\n[[South Carolina Senate|South Carolina state senator]] Dewey Wise introduced legislation to permit the event to be held over the [[reversible lane]] on the three-lane Silas Pearman Bridge.\n\nOn April 2, 1978, the initial race began from Patriots Point in Mount Pleasant to the White Point Gardens in Charleston's [[Battery Park (Charleston)|Battery]] region.  Police shortened the initial event to 9,850 meters after the gun had sounded to start the initial Bridge Run. Officials expected 500 runners for the event (with 340 pre-registered), but on race day an additional 600 to 700 runners registered.  766 runners finished. Many dropped out of the race and some were hospitalized for effects from the heat, as there were no [[water stop (sports)|water stop]]s on the course. In the tradition of historic Charleston's Civil War and Revolutionary War heritage, a cannon is fired to start the event. The first [[Kenya]]n runners to participate were a pair of [[Charleston Southern University|Baptist College]] teammates in 1978.  Runners from that country have dominated the run since 1993.\n\nFollowing complaints from heat exhaustion and also from area churches (While Charleston County has some Blue Laws exceptions in Charleston County in deference to the Jewish community, churches on the course complained about the Bridge Run taking place while church services took place), the 1979 event was moved to the Saturday in March, where it would be held until 1985.  One water stop at the terminus of the bridge was added.  (Four water stops were on the 2005 course.)  The finish line moved to the campus of the [[College of Charleston]].  Over 1,350 were entered, with over 1,000 finishing. The 1979 event, the first at 10,000 meters, was the first South Carolina running event with over 1,000 participants. The 1980 finish ended in a tie.\n\nTwo consecutive Bridge Runs (1986 and 1987) were marred by illegal runners.  In 1986, between 300 and 500 runners did not make the start, which had been delayed 30 minutes because of a vehicular collision on the Pearman Bridge (the only access to the start line) between two shuttle buses carrying runners to the start and an automobile 70 minutes before the scheduled start.  They ran down the Pearman, through the cut between the two bridges, and started their run midway through the course, on the Grace.\n\nIn 1987, with unusually cold temperatures (start temperature was 39 degrees Fahrenheit (4c) with wind gusts from 20-35 MPH (32\u201355&nbsp;km/h), runners kept their warmups instead of displaying their bibs.  Officials estimated about 10% of the nearly 7,000 runners who crossed the finish lines were illegal, or \"bandit\", runners.  The bandits were allowed to cross the finish line because officials could not distinguish who was legitimate and who was not.\n\nIn 1989, elite runners were warming up ahead of the start line on SC 703 when the cannon fired.  Grete Waitz's record time was disallowed, but she was allowed to keep the win, when she was caught ahead of the start line at the cannon.\n\nThe 1995 event was the first time over 10,000 runners participated, and women made up over 3,000 of the runners, the first time in North or South Carolina where over 3,000 women finished in a running event.\n\nTransponder timing was instituted in 1997.  The 2005-2008 races featured a permanent transponder which the runner could keep was implemented.  A D-Tag timing system was used from 2009\u201310, and from 2011, transponder tags were affixed to competitors' bibs.\n\nThe total Bridge Run and Walk participants in 2004 was 29,930.  Females accounted for 45.1% of finishers.\n\nIn 2012, logistical problems (only one shuttle bus entry point) led to over 10,000 runners being stuck on the shuttle buses on the Ravenel's northbound lanes (which the course uses) where officials could not close the bridge until 7:45 AM, 15 minutes before the scheduled start.  The race was delayed to an 8:19 start time for the wheelchair division and an 8:59 start for the elite runners as result.\n\nThe last run on the Pearman in 2005 had a 42,000 runner and walker cap (25,000 runners, 17,000 walkers) for 2005, but many did not appear because of inclement weather which marred the start.  The current limit is 44,000. The 2012 race featured 36,652 finishers, women dominated with 59.45% (21,789 F vs 14,917 M) of runners.\n\n==Course and event changes==\n\nThe scheduled start time was 10 AM in 1978, 9 AM from 1979 until 1982, 8:30 AM in 1983 until 1986, and 8 AM until 2019. Two unusual start delays caused by the unfamiliar course moved the 1984 start to 9 AM.  The 2020 race will start at 7 AM with a wheelchair start at 6:30 AM.\n\nThe [[John P. Grace Memorial Bridge]] had been declared unsafe for heavy trucks over ten tons in 1979, and the [[South Carolina Department of Transportation]] eliminated the reversible lane on the [[Silas N. Pearman Bridge]] which had been used for the Bridge Run course, as trucks on [[US Highway 17]] South were now required to use that lane, instead of using the Grace.  State Senator Wise was able to push for legislation to use the Grace bridge for the Bridge Run, SC Statue 56-5-3880.\n\nIn 1983, the Grace Bridge run added a second uphill climb on the Crosstown Overpass connecting the Grace Bridge to US Highway 17 and [[Interstate 26]], and the race finished in front of the United States Federal Building in Marion Square at Meeting Street.  With the number of entrants exceeding 2,000, the start moved from Patriots Point in 1984 to SC Highway 703 (Coleman Boulevard) at Shem Creek.  This course became the first Bridge Run course to be certified by [[USA Track and Field|The Athletics Congress]].\n\nRoad construction near Market Street in Charleston forced a slight rerouting in 1986, when the Bridge Run was moved to its present date in April unless Easter fell on that weekend.\n\nWith entrants exceeding 8,500 and a new 7,000 meter walk added, totaling over 10,000 participants, and tighter restrictions on weight on the Grace Bridge, in 1995 officials returned the Bridge Run to the Pearman bridge, with all three lanes being used, as traffic to Charleston could now be diverted to the [[Don N. Holt Bridge]] near Daniel Island on [[Interstate 526]], which had opened in 1992.  A new start line on SC 703 near Live Oak Street was positioned with runners passing Coming, Line, King, Market, and Meeting at Marion Square.  With congestion becoming a concern, a year later officials moved back the finish to the corner of Meeting and Calhoun in Marion Square, resulting in a corresponding move back of the start on SC 703.\n\nIn 2000, the Bridge Run course went through a complete overhaul with the start further back on SC 703 near the shopping center, giving runners a 3,000 meter run on SC 703 before joining the walkers at the foot of the first span of the Pearman, then crossing the Crosstown Overpass, King Street, Calhoun Street, and finishing at Alexander.  The course eliminated the use of Meeting Street, which had been used as the primary street in the past.  This course would be used until 2005, when the Pearman and Grace bridges closed.\n\nIn 2003, a youth event was held on the Friday at Hampton Park to expand the festivities.\n\nMajor alterations to the course were necessary for 2006 as [[USA Track and Field]] had to measure a new course to reflect the opening of the [[Arthur Ravenel, Jr. Bridge]] and construction on the Ansonborough Fields complex resulted in the moving of the finish line away from Alexander Street, where it had been set since 2000, and a new finish line at George Street and Meeting Street, across from the [[Carolina First Arena]] in Charleston, was established.  The finish festival was held at Marion Square, which is located a short walk as runners made the cooldown from the finish line.\n\nThe start line was slightly moved but remains near the shopping center, and proceeds on SC 703 for 3,000 meters before approaching the northbound exit ramp to SC 703 (run southbound, towards Charleston, the opposite direction of normal vehicular traffic), with the runners proceeding on the [[Arthur Ravenel, Jr. Bridge]] southbound on the four northbound lanes (the four southbound lanes on the bridge are not used;  furthermore, the bike-pedestrian lane (which is aligned with the northbound lanes, but just off to East Bay Street and is not part of the course) is reserved for use by emergency staff) for 3,200 meters before exiting the bridge using the two-lane Meeting Street entrance ramp (runners are running the opposite direction of normal vehicular traffic), turning left on Meeting for 2,000 meters before, making a right at the Visitor's Center at John Street, then a quick left at King Street, before turning left at Wentworth Street, before a final run up Meeting Street the other direction before the finish line.\n\nTwo potential forms of cheating near the finish were dealt with using fencing at Marion Square at King Street (the finish festival site), and sponsor Bi-Lo parking a tractor-trailer at the intersection of Meeting and John to force runners to make the turn back to King.  Furthermore, the live bands which play at the finish festival will be heard twice, as runners pass through Marion Square the first time on King Street, and after crossing the finish line and cooling down.\n\nConcerns over bottlenecking by walkers on course who entered the bridge walk at the 3,000 meter mark on Coleman Boulevard at Patriots Point (the original start line) and the [[WCBD|NBC 2 studios]] eliminated the 7,000 meter walk, and required walkers to proceed through the entire 10,000 meter run starting in 2006.  However, the rule was not as enforced as some had thought.  Some walkers (and lower-seeded runners too) lined up on the sidewalks on SC 703 from Shem Creek to that studio, which is at the foot of the exit ramp from the bridge, instead of lining behind all runners at the start line, which was the instruction given to participants in the 2006 event in order to prevent incidents.\n\nAnother rule change in 2006 required runners to be seeded by time;  elite and invited runners were ahead, then runners in the under 40 minute category, then 40-50, 50-60, past one hour, and walkers.  The main goal was to prevent certain bottlenecking, although some bottlenecking did take place at the start line because of the transponder timing system.\n\nThe 2006 event also debuted the wheelchair category as a competitive event;  twelve wheelchair and crankchair athletes competed in the event, which started at 7:30 AM, although Manny Marshall attempted to complete the course in a wheelchair by entering at the Chanel 2 studios at the 3km point.\n\nFor 2010 the turn from Meeting to King was changed from John Street to Wolfe Street, to avoid Piggly Wiggly #1 (a direct competitor to race sponsor Bi-Lo, although Bi-Lo later purchased this location in 2013), and to allow the bars to have bands perform.  One notable performer was Dave Seitz and the King Street Band, fronted by the popular former [[South Carolina Stingrays]] player whose #14 is retired.\n\nStarting with the 2011 event, a wave start system is utilized to better handle crowding in the Mount Pleasant.\n\nThe 2020 race will be the first race to be held in the summer, as the Bridge Run moved to an August date.\n\n==Competitors==\nInitially, the race attracted national-level runners. Benji Durden, whose opportunity to make the Olympic team was denied by President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1980, won the first run. [[Frank Shorter]] and [[Ruth Wysocki]] ran in the early 1980s and Olympians [[Mark Conover]] and [[Janis Klecker]] were participants in the early 1990s. The race has featured top level international competitors, including Olympic medalists [[Grete Waitz]], [[Catherine Ndereba]], and [[Elana Meyer]].\n\nOutside of elite runners, the run has also featured people prominent in other cultural spheres. Television personality [[Oprah Winfrey]], running under a  [[pseudonym]], finished the 1994 race (3,839th with a time of 55:48 min). Actor [[Bill Murray]] fired the cannon for the 1997 Bridge Run and ran the event.  In 2011, then-[[NASCAR Nationwide Series]] driver [[Aric Almirola]], his wife Janice, and two members of the [[JR Motorsports]] #88 team from the 2011 season participated during an off-week in that series,  and former state Governor [[Mark Sanford]] and two of his children also participated. Irish Olympic runner [[Sean Dollman]], who retired after taking a job at the [[College of Charleston]], came out of retirement at the Bridge Run and won the Dr. Marcus Newberry Award for best runner residing in the Charleston metropolitan region (Charleston, Berkeley, Dorchester counties) in 2002. In 2012, [[Zeddie Little]] became an internet meme known as the \"ridiculously photogenic guy\" after having a photo of him taken by Will King while running the race.\n\n==Past
