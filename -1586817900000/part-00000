The Spaniards encouraged its use, so Quechua ultimately [[historical linguistics|survived]] and variants are still widely spoken today, being the co-official language of many regions and the second most spoken language in Peru.\n\n==History==\nQuechua had already expanded across wide ranges of the central Andes long before the expansion of the [[Inca Empire]]. The Inca were one among many peoples in present-day Peru who already spoke a form of Quechua. In the [[Cusco]] region, Quechua was influenced by neighboring languages such as [[Aymara language|Aymara]], which caused it to develop as distinct. In similar ways, diverse dialects developed in different areas, borrowing from local languages, when the Inca Empire ruled and imposed Quechua as the official language.\n\nAfter the [[Spanish conquest of Peru]] in the 16th century, Quechua continued to be used widely by the indigenous peoples as the \"common language\". It was officially recognized by the Spanish administration and many Spanish learned it in order to communicate with local peoples.<ref>{{cite book | title=De la etnohistoria a la historia en los Andes : 51o Congreso Internacional de Americanistas, Santiago de Chile, 2003 | editor1= Fisher, John|editor2=Cahill, David Patrick | publisher=Congreso Internacional de Americanistas | year=2008 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=IFH0Z5_HKVEC&pg=PA295&dq=%22lenguas+generales%22+peru+Virreinato#v=onepage | page=295| isbn= 9789978227398}}</ref>  Clergy of the [[Catholic Church]] adopted Quechua to use as the language of [[evangelism|evangelization]]. Given its use by the Catholic missionaries, the range of Quechua continued to expand in some areas.\n\nIn the late 18th century, colonial officials ended administrative and religious use of Quechua, banning it from public use in Peru after the [[T\u00fapac Amaru II]] rebellion of indigenous peoples.<ref name=adelaar167/> The Crown banned even \"loyal\" pro-Catholic texts in Quechua, such as Garcilaso de la Vega's ''[[Comentarios Reales de los Incas|Comentarios Reales]].''<ref>Aybar cited by Hart, Stephen M. ''A Companion to Latin American Literature,'' p. 6.</ref>\n\nDespite a brief revival of the language immediately after the Latin American nations achieved independence in the 19th century, the prestige of Quechua had decreased sharply. Gradually its use declined so that it was spoken mostly by indigenous people in the more isolated and conservative rural areas. Nevertheless, in the 21st century, Quechua language speakers number 8 to 10 million people across South America,<ref name=adelaar167/> the most speakers of any indigenous language.\n\nThe oldest written records of the language are by missionary [[Domingo de Santo Tom\u00e1s]], who arrived in Peru in 1538 and learned the language from 1540. He published his ''Grammatica o arte de la lengua general de los indios de los reynos del Per\u00fa'' (Grammar or Art of the General Language of the Indians of the Royalty of Peru) in 1560.<ref>{{Cite book\n |last=Torero\n |first=Alfredo\n |authorlink=Alfredo Torero\n | chapter = La familia ling\u00fb\u00edstica quechua\n |year=1983\n |title=Am\u00e9rica Latina en sus lenguas ind\u00edgenas\n | place = Caracas\n |publisher=Monte \u00c1vila\n |isbn=92-3-301926-8\n }}\n</ref><ref>{{Cite book\n |last=Torero\n |first=Alfredo\n |authorlink=Alfredo Torero\n |year=1974\n |title=El quechua y la historia social andina\n | place = Lima\n |publisher=Universidad Ricardo Palma, Direcci\u00f3n Universitaria de Investigaci\u00f3n\n |isbn=978-603-45-0210-9\n }}</ref>\n\nAs result of [[Incas in Central Chile|Inca expansion into Central Chile]] there were bilingual Quechua-[[Mapuche language|Mapudungu]] [[Mapuche]] in Central Chile at the time of the [[Conquest of Chile|Spanish arrival]].<ref name=Hernadez/><ref name=Telles43>{{cite book |last=T\u00e9llez |first=Eduardo |title=Los Diaguitas: Estudios |url= |year=2008 |edition= |publisher=Ediciones Akhilleus |location=[[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], Chile |isbn=978-956-8762-00-1 |language=Spanish|page=43}}<!--|accessdate=August 27, 2019 --></ref> It has been argued that Mapuche, Quechua and Spanish coexisted in [[Central Chile]], with significant biligualism, during the 17th century.<ref name=Hernadez>{{cite journal |last1=Hern\u00e1ndez Salles |first1=Arturo |date=1981 |title=Influencia del mapuche en el castellano |url= |journal=[[Documentos Ling\u00fc\u00edsticos y Literarios]] |volume=7 |issue= |pages=34\u201344 |doi= |access-date=|language=Spanish }}</ref> Quechua is the indigenous language that has influenced [[Chilean Spanish]] the most.<ref name=Hernadez/>\n\nIn 2016 the first thesis defense done in Quechua in Europe was done by Peruvian [[Carmen Escalante Guti\u00e9rrez]] at [[Pablo de Olavide University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/Peruvian-Prof.-Presents-First-Quechuan-Thesis-Defense-in-Europe-20170318-0003.html|title=Peruvian Prof. Presents First Quechuan Thesis Defense in Europe|publisher=[[Telesur]]|accessdate=2019-10-28}}</ref>{{deprecated inline|certain=y|November 2019}} A Peruvian student, [[Roxana Quispe Collantes]] of the [[University of San Marcos]], completed and defended the first thesis in the language group in 2019; it concerned the works of poet {{ill|Andr\u00e9s Alencastre Guti\u00e9rrez|es|Andr\u00e9s Alencastre Guti\u00e9rrez|qu|Andr\u00e9s Alencastre Guti\u00e9rrez}} and it was also the first non-Spanish native language thesis done at that university.<ref name=CollynsCollantes>{{cite web|author=Collyns, Dan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/27/peru-student-roxana-quispe-collantes-thesis-inca-language-quechua|title=Student in Peru makes history by writing thesis in the Incas' language |work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2019-10-27|accessdate=2019-10-28}}</ref>\n\n==Current status==\n[[File:El quechua como lengua materna (censo nacional 2007).png|thumb|upright=1.59|Map of Peru showing the distribution of overall Quechua speakers by district]]\nIn 1975, Peru became the first country to recognize Quechua as one of its official languages.<ref name=NYT1975>{{cite news |title=Peru officially adopting Indian tongue |first=Jonathan Gay |last=Kandell |date=May 22, 1975 |work=New York Times |url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1975/05/23/issue.html}}</ref> Ecuador conferred official status on the language in its 2006 constitution, and in 2009, Bolivia adopted a new constitution that recognized Quechua and several other indigenous languages as official languages of the country.<ref name=Andes>{{cite book |title=The Andes: A Geographical Portrait|first=Axel|last=Borsdorf |date=12 March 2015|page=142 |isbn=9783319035307|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lgEyBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA142&lpg=PA142&dq=ecuador+constitution+quechua#v=onepage}}</ref>\n\nThe major obstacle to the usage and teaching of Quechuan languages is the lack of written materials in the languages, such as books, newspapers, software, and magazines. The Bible has been translated into Quechua and is distributed by certain missionary groups. Quechua, along with [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and minor indigenous languages, remains essentially a [[spoken language]].\n\nIn recent years, Quechua has been introduced in [[intercultural bilingual education]] (IBE) in [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]]. Even in these areas, the governments are reaching only a part of the Quechua-speaking populations. Some indigenous people in each of the countries are having their children study in Spanish for the purposes of social advancement.<ref>Adelaar 2004, pp. 258\u2013259: \"The Quechua speakers' wish for social mobility for their children is often heard as an argument for not transmitting the language to the next generation.... As observed quite adequately by [[Rodolfo Cerr\u00f3n Palomino|Cerr\u00f3n Palomino]], \"Quechua (and [[Aymaran languages|Aymara]]) speakers seem to have taken the project of assimilation begun by the dominating classes and made it their own.\"</ref>\n\n[[Radio Nacional del Per\u00fa]] broadcasts news and agrarian programs in Quechua for periods in the mornings.\n\nQuechua and Spanish are now heavily intermixed in much of the Andean region, with many hundreds of Spanish loanwords in Quechua. Similarly, Quechua phrases and words are commonly used by Spanish speakers. In southern rural Bolivia, for instance, many Quechua words such as ''wawa'' (infant), ''misi'' (cat), ''waska'' (strap or thrashing), are as commonly used as their Spanish counterparts, even in entirely Spanish-speaking areas. Quechua has also had a profound influence on other native languages of the Americas, such as [[Mapuche language|Mapuche]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Number of speakers===\nThe number of speakers given varies widely according to the sources. The total in ''Ethnologue'' 16 is 10 million, mostly based on figures published 1987\u20132002, but with a few dating from the 1960s. The figure for Imbabura Highland Quechua in ''Ethnologue'', for example, is 300,000, an estimate from 1977.\n\nThe missionary organization FEDEPI, on the other hand, estimated one million Imbabura dialect speakers (published 2006). Census figures are also problematic, due to under-reporting. The 2001 Ecuador census reports only 500,000 Quechua speakers, compared to the estimate in most linguistic sources of more than 2 million. The censuses of Peru (2007) and Bolivia (2001) are thought to be more reliable.\n\n*Argentina: 900,000 (1971)\n*Bolivia: 2,100,000 (2001 census); 2,800,000 South Bolivian (1987)\n*Chile: few, if any; 8200 in ethnic group (2002 census)\n*Colombia: 4,402 to 16,000<ref>[http://www.ling.fi/DICCIONARIO.htm Alain Fabre, Diccionario etnoling\u00fc\u00edstico y gu\u00eda bibliogr\u00e1fica de los pubelos ind\u00edgenas sudamericanos]</ref>\n*Ecuador: 2,300,000 (Adelaar 1991)\n*Peru: 3,800,000 (2017 census<ref>http://censos2017.inei.gob.pe/redatam/</ref>); 3,500,000 to 4,400,000 (Adelaar 2000)\n\nAdditionally, there are an unknown number of speakers in emigrant communities, including [[Queens]], New York, and [[Paterson, New Jersey]], in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news\n| last = Claudio Torrens\n| title = Some NY immigrants cite lack of Spanish as barrier\n| work = UTSanDiego.com\n| accessdate = 2013-02-10\n| date = 2011-05-28\n| url = http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2011/may/28/some-ny-immigrants-cite-lack-of-spanish-as-barrier/\n}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Quechuan_distribution.svg|thumb|The four branches of Quechua: I (Central), II-A (North Peruvian), II-B (Northern), II-C (Southern)]]\nThere are significant differences among the varieties of Quechua spoken in the central Peruvian highlands and the peripheral varieties of Ecuador, as well as those of southern Peru and Bolivia. They can be labeled Quechua I (or Quechua B, central) and Quechua II (or Quechua A, peripheral). Within the two groups, there are few sharp boundaries, making them [[dialect continuum|dialect continua]].\n\nHowever, there is a secondary division in Quechua II between the grammatically simplified northern varieties of Ecuador, Quechua II-B, known there as [[Kichwa language|Kichwa]], and the generally more conservative varieties of the southern highlands, Quechua II-C, which include the old Inca capital of [[Cusco]]. The closeness is at least in part because of the influence of [[Cusco Quechua]] on the Ecuadorean varieties in the Inca Empire. Because Northern nobles were required to educate their children in Cusco, this was maintained as the [[prestige dialect]] in the north.\n\nSpeakers from different points within any of the three regions can generally understand one another reasonably well. There are nonetheless significant local-level differences across each. ([[Wanka Quechua]], in particular, has several very distinctive characteristics that make the variety more difficult to understand, even for other Central Quechua speakers.) Speakers from different major regions, particularly Central or Southern Quechua, are not able to communicate effectively.\n\nThe lack of [[mutual intelligibility]] among the dialects is the basic criterion that defines Quechua not as a single language, but as a language family. The complex and progressive nature of how speech varies across the dialect continua makes it nearly impossible to differentiate discrete varieties; ''Ethnologue'' lists 45 varieties which are then divided into two groups; Central and Peripheral. Due to the non-intelligibility among the two groups, they are all classified as separate languages.<ref name=Ethnologue>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=que Ethnologue report for Quechua (macrolanguage) (SIL)]</ref>\n\nAs a reference point, the overall degree of diversity across the family is a little less than that of the [[Romance languages|Romance]] or [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] families, and more of the order of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] or [[Arabic]]. The greatest diversity is within Central Quechua, or Quechua I, which is believed to lie close to the homeland of the ancestral Proto-Quechua language.\n\n===Family tree===\n[[Alfredo Torero]] devised the traditional classification, the three divisions above, plus a fourth, a northern or Peruvian branch. The latter causes complications in the classification, however, as the northern dialects ([[Cajamarca\u2013Ca\u00f1aris Quechua|Cajamarca\u2013Ca\u00f1aris]], [[Pacaraos Quechua|Pacaraos]], and [[Yauyos\u2013Chincha Quechua|Yauyos\u2013Chincha]]) have features of both Quechua I and Quechua II, and so are difficult to assign to either.\n\nTorero classifies them as the following:\n\n* [[Quechua I]] or ''Quechua B,'' aka ''Central Quechua'' or ''Waywash,'' spoken in Peru's central highlands and coast.\n** The most widely spoken varieties are Huaylas, Huaylla Wanca, and Conchucos.\n* [[Quechua II]] or ''Quechua A'' or ''Peripheral Quechua'' or ''Wanp'una'', divided into\n** Yungay (Yunkay) Quechua or ''Quechua II A,'' spoken in the northern mountains of Peru; the most widely spoken dialect is Cajamarca.\n** [[Northern Quechua]] or ''Quechua II B,'' spoken in Ecuador ([[Kichwa language|Kichwa]]), northern Peru, and Colombia ([[Inga Kichwa]])\n*** The most widely spoken varieties in this group are Chimborazo Highland Quichua and Imbabura Highland Quichua.\n** [[Southern Quechua]] or ''Quechua II C,'' spoken in Bolivia, southern Peru, Chile, and Argentina.\n*** The most widely spoken varieties are South Bolivian, Cusco, Ayacucho, and Puno (Collao).\n\n<!-- This schematic was introduced with the summary of Torero above, but it does not reflect Torero's classification, and its origin is not clear.\n{{Clade\n| label1=Proto-Quechua\n| 1={{Clade\n  | label1=[[Quechua I]]\n  | 1={{Clade\n     | label1=Central\n     | 1={{Clade\n        | label1='''[[Ancash Quechua|Huaylay]]'''\n        | 1={{Clade\n           | 1=Huaylas\n           | 2=Conchucos}}\n        | label2='''&nbsp;[[Alto Pativilca\u2013Alto Mara\u00f1\u00f3n\u2013Alto Huallaga Quechua|Alto Pativilca\u2013Alto Mara\u00f1\u00f3n\u2013Alto Huallaga]]&nbsp;'''\n        | 2={{Clade\n           | 1=Alto Pativilca\n           | 2=Alto Mara\u00f1\u00f3n\n           | 3=Alto Huallaga }}\n        | label3=Huancay\n        | 3={{Clade\n           | 1='''[[Yaru Quechua|Yaru]]'''\n           | 2='''[[Wanka Quechua|Jauja\u2013Huanca]]'''\n           | 3=[[Yauyos\u2013Chincha Quechua|Huang\u00e1scar\u2013Topar\u00e1]] }} }}\n     | 2=[[Pacaraos Quechua|Pacaraos]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n       }}\n  | label2=[[Quechua II]]\n  | 2={{Clade\n     | label1=Yungay <br/>(Quechua&nbsp;II-A)\n     | 1={{Clade\n        | label2='''[[Northern Peruvian Quechua|Northern Peruvian]]'''\n        | 2={{Clade\n            | 1=Inkawasi\u2013Ka\u00f1aris\n            | 2=Cajamarca}}\n        | label1='''[[Yauyos\u2013Chincha Quechua|Central]]'''\n        | 1={{Clade\n           | 1=Laraos\n           | 2=[[Lincha Quechua|Lincha]]\n           | 3=Apur\u00ed\n           | 4=Chocos\n           | 5=Madean }} }}\n     | label2=Chinchay\n     | 2={{Clade\n        | label1=[[Northern Quechua|Northern]] <br/>(Quechua&nbsp;II-B)\n        | 1={{Clade\n           | 1='''[[Kichwa|Ecuador\u2013Colombia]]'''\n           | 2=[[Chachapoyas Quechua|Chachapoyas]] (Amazonas)\n           | 3=[[Lamas Quechua|Lamas]] (San Mart\u00edn) }}\n        | label2='''Classical'''{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n        | 2={{Clade\n           | 1=\u2020 ''quechua''\n           | label2= '''[[Southern Quechua]]''' <br/>(Quechua&nbsp;II-C)\n           | 2={{Clade\n              | 1=[[Ayacucho Quechua|Ayacucho]]\n              | label2=Cuzco\u2013Collao\n              | 2={{Clade\n                 | 1=[[Cuzco Quechua|Cuzco]]\n                 | 2=Northern Bolivia\n                 | 3=[[South Bolivian Quechua|Southern Bolivia]] }}\n              | 3=[[Santiago del Estero Quichua|Santiago del Estero]] }}}} }} }}}} }}\n-->\n[[Willem Adelaar]] adheres to the Quechua I / Quechua II (central/peripheral) bifurcation.

That hypothesis is generally rejected by specialists, however. The parallels are better explained by mutual influence and borrowing through intensive and long-term contact. Many Quechua\u2013Aymara cognates are close, often closer than intra-Quechua cognates, and there is little relationship in the [[affix]]al system. \n\nThe [[Puquina language]] of the [[Tiwanaku Empire]] is a possible source for some of the shared vocabulary between Quechua and Aymara.<ref name=Moulianetal2015>{{cite journal |last1=Moulian |first1=Rodr\u00edgo |last2=Catrileo |first2=Mar\u00eda|last3=Landeo |first3=Pablo|author-link2=Mar\u00eda Catrileo |date=2015 |title=Afines quechua en el vocabulario mapuche de Luis de Valdivia |trans-title=Akins Quechua words in the Mapuche vocabulary of Luis de Valdivia |url=https://scielo.conicyt.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0718-48832015000200004&script=sci_arttext|journal=[[Revista de ling\u00fc\u00edstica te\u00f3rica y aplicada]] |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages= 73\u201396|doi=10.4067/S0718-48832015000200004 |access-date=January 13, 2019|language=Spanish|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n==Vocabulary==\nA number of Quechua [[loanword]]s have entered [[English language|English]] (also in [[English language|French]] with minor orthographic adaptations) via [[Spanish language|Spanish]], including ''[[coca]]'', ''[[condor]]'', ''[[guano]]'', ''[[jerky]]'', ''[[llama]]'' (''lama'' in French), ''[[pampa]]'', ''[[poncho]]'', ''[[puma (genus)|puma]]'', ''[[quinine]]'', ''[[quinoa]]'', ''[[vicu\u00f1a]]'' (''vigogne'' in French), and, possibly, ''[[gaucho]]''.  The word ''[[lagniappe]]'' comes from the Quechuan word ''yapay'' (\"to increase; to add\"), via Spanish then [[Louisiana French]], with the French or Spanish article ''la'' in front of it, ''la \u00f1apa'' in Louisiana French or Creole, or ''la yapa'' in Spanish.\n\nThe influence on Latin American Spanish includes such borrowings as ''papa'' for \"potato\",  ''chuchaqui'' for \"hangover\" in [[Ecuador]], and diverse borrowings for \"[[altitude sickness]]\", in [[Bolivia]] from Quechuan ''suruqch'i'' to Bolivian ''sorojchi'', in [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]] ''soroche''.\n\nA rare instance of a Quechua word being taken into general Spanish use is given by ''carpa'' for \"tent\" (Quechua ''karpa'').<ref>Edward A. Roberts, ''A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the Spanish Language...'', 2014.</ref>\n\nIn Bolivia, particularly, Quechua words are used extensively even by non-Quechua speakers. These include wawa (baby, infant), ch'aki (hangover), misi (cat), juk'ucho (mouse), q'omer uchu (green pepper), jacu (\"lets go\"), chhiri and chhurco (curly haired), among many others. Quechua grammar also enters Bolivian Spanish, such as the use of the suffix -ri. In Bolivian Quechua, -ri is added to verbs to signify an action is performed with affection or, in the imperative, as a rough equivalent to please. In Bolivia -ri is often included in the Spanish imperative to imply \"please\" or to soften commands. For example, the standard \"p\u00e1same\" (pass me), becomes pasarime.\n\nQuechua has borrowed a large number of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] words, such as ''piru'' (from ''pero'', but), ''bwenu'' (from ''bueno'', good), iskwila (from \"escuela,\" school), waka (from \"vaca,\" cow) and ''burru'' (from ''burro'', donkey).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ru.nl/publish/pages/632031/root_affix_asymmetries.pdf|title=Root/Affix asymmetries in contact and transfer: Case studies from the Andes|last=Muysken|first=Pieter|date=|website=www.ru.nl|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Etymology of Quechua===\nAt first, Spaniards referred to the language of the Inca empire as the ''lengua general'', the ''general language''. The name ''quichua'' was first used in 1560 by [[Domingo de Santo Tom\u00e1s]] in his ''Grammatica o arte de la lengua general de los indios de los reynos del Per\u00fa''.<ref name=Adelaar179>Adelaar 2004, p. 179.</ref> It is not known what name the native speakers gave to their language before colonial times and whether it was Spaniards who called it ''quechua''.<ref name=Adelaar179/>\n\nThere are two possible etymologies of Quechua as the name of the language. There is a possibility that the name Quechua was derived from ''*qi\u0109.wa'', the native word which originally meant the \"temperate valley\" altitude ecological zone in the Andes (suitable for maize cultivation) and to its inhabitants.<ref name=Adelaar179/>\n\nAlternatively, [[Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n]] and [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]], the early Spanish chroniclers, mention the existence of a people called Quichua in the present [[Apur\u00edmac Region]], and it could be inferred that their name was given to the entire language.<ref name=Adelaar179/>\n\nThe Hispanicised spellings ''Quechua'' and ''Quichua'' have been used in Peru and Bolivia since the 17th century, especially after the [[Third Council of Lima]]. Today, the various local pronunciations of \"Quechua Simi\" include {{IPA-qu|\u02c8q\u02b0e\u0283wa&nbsp;\u02c8simi|}}, {{IPA-qu|\u02c8\u03c7et\u0283wa&nbsp;\u02c8\u0283imi|}}, {{IPA-qu|\u02c8kit\u0283wa&nbsp;\u02c8\u0283imi|}}, and {{IPA-qu|\u02c8\u0294it\u0283wa&nbsp;\u02c8\u0283imi|}}.\n\nAnother name that native speakers give to their own language is ''runa simi'', \"language of man/people\"; it also seems to have emerged during the colonial period.<ref name=Adelaar179/>\n\n==Phonology==\nThe description below applies to [[Cusco Quechua]]; there are significant differences in other varieties of Quechua.\n\n===Vowels===\nQuechua only has three vowel phonemes: {{IPA|/a/}} {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}, as in Aymara (including [[Jaqaru language|Jaqaru]]). Monolingual speakers pronounce them as {{IPA|[\u00e6, \u026a, \u028a]}} respectively, but [[Spanish language|Spanish]] realizations {{IPA|[\u00e4, i, u]}} may also be found. When the vowels appear adjacent to uvular consonants ({{IPA|/q/}}, {{IPA|/q\u02bc/}}, and {{IPA|/q\u02b0/}}), they are rendered more like {{IPA|[\u0251]}}, {{IPA|[\u025b]}} and {{IPA|[\u0254]}}, respectively.\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Cusco Quechua consonant phonemes\n|-\n! colspan=2|\n!

Because reflexes of a given Proto-Quechua word may have different stops in neighboring dialects (Proto-Quechua ''\u010daki'' 'foot' becomes ''\u010d'aki'' and ''\u010daka'' 'bridge' becomes ''\u010daka''), they are thought to be innovations in Quechua from [[Aymara language|Aymara]], borrowed independently after branching off from Proto-Quechua.\n\nGemination of the tap {{IPA|/\u027e/}} results in a trill {{IPA|[r]}}.\n\n===Stress===\nStress is penultimate in most dialects of Quechua. In some varieties, factors such as [[apocope]] of word-final vowels may cause exceptional final stress.\n\n==Orthography==\n{{main|Quechua alphabet}}\n{{further|Southern Quechua#Standard Quechua|l1=Southern Quechua \u00a7 Standard Quechua}}\n\nQuechua has been written using the Roman alphabet since the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire]]. However, written Quechua is rarely used by Quechua speakers because of the lack of printed<!--hiding this because incomprehensible/illogical: referential --> material in Quechua.\n\nUntil the 20th century, Quechua was written with a Spanish-based [[orthography]], for example ''Inca, Huayna C\u00e1pac, Collasuyo, Mama Ocllo, Viracocha, quipu, tambo, condor''. This orthography is the most familiar to Spanish speakers and so has been used for most borrowings into English, which essentially always happen through Spanish.\n\nIn 1975, the Peruvian government of [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]] adopted a new orthography for Quechua. This is the system preferred by the [[Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua]], which results in the following spellings of the examples listed above: ''Inka, Wayna Qhapaq, Qollasuyu, Mama Oqllo, Wiraqocha, khipu, tampu, kuntur''. This orthography has the following features:\n* It uses  '''w''' instead of ''hu'' for {{IPA|/w/}}.\n* It distinguishes velar ''k'' from uvular ''q'', both of which were spelled ''c'' or ''qu'' in the traditional system.{{Examples|date=December 2018}}\n* It distinguishes simple, ejective, and aspirated stops in dialects (such as that of the [[Cusco Region]]) that make these distinctions, e.g. the aspirated ''khipu'' above.\n* It continues to use the Spanish five-vowel system.\n\nIn 1985, a variation of this system was adopted by the Peruvian government that uses the Quechuan three-vowel system, resulting in the following spellings: ''Inka, Wayna Qhapaq, Qullasuyu, Mama Uqllu, Wiraqucha, khipu, tampu, kuntur''.\n\nThe different orthographies are still highly controversial in Peru. Advocates of the traditional system believe that the new orthographies look too foreign and believe that it makes Quechua harder to learn for people who have first been exposed to written Spanish. Those who prefer the new system maintain that it better matches the phonology of Quechua, and they point to studies showing that teaching the five-vowel system to children later causes reading difficulties in Spanish.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nFor more on this, see [[Quechuan and Aymaran spelling shift]].\n\nWriters differ in the treatment of Spanish loanwords. These are sometimes adapted to the modern orthography and sometimes left as in Spanish. For instance, \"I am Roberto\" could be written ''Robertom kani'' or ''Ruwirtum kani''. (The ''-m'' is not part of the name; it is an evidential suffix, showing how the information is known: firsthand, in this case.)\n\nThe Peruvian linguist [[Rodolfo Cerr\u00f3n Palomino]] has proposed an orthographic norm for all of [[Southern Quechua]]: this Standard Quechua (''el Quechua est\u00e1ndar'' or ''Hanan Runasimi'') conservatively integrates features of the two widespread dialects [[Ayacucho Quechua]] and [[Cusco Quechua]].

According to article 20 of the decree ''Decreto Supremo No 004-2016-MC'', which approves regulations relative to Law 29735, published in the  official newspaper El Peruano on July 22, 2016, adequate spellings of the [[toponym]]s in the normalized alphabets of the indigenous languages must progressively be proposed, with the aim of standardizing the spellings used by the National Geographic Institute ''(Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico Nacional, IGN)'' The IGN implements the necessary changes on the official maps of Peru.<ref name=decree>{{cite web |url=http://busquedas.elperuano.com.pe/normaslegales/decreto-supremo-que-aprueba-el-reglamento-de-la-ley-n-29735-decreto-supremo-n-004-2016-mc-1407753-5/|title=Decreto Supremo que aprueba el Reglamento de la Ley N\u00b0 29735, Ley que regula el uso, preservaci\u00f3n, desarrollo, recuperaci\u00f3n, fomento y difusi\u00f3n de las lenguas originarias del Per\u00fa, Decreto Supremo N\u00b0 004-2016-MC|last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=July 10, 2017|quote=}}</ref>\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Morphological type===\nQuechua is an agglutinating language. Words are built up from basic roots followed by several suffixes each of which carry one meaning. All varieties of Quechua are very regular [[agglutinative language]]s, as opposed to [[isolating language|isolating]] or [[fusional language|fusional]] ones  [Thompson]. Their normal sentence order is SOV ([[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]]). Their large number of [[suffix]]es changes both the overall meaning of words and their subtle shades of meaning.  Notable grammatical features include bipersonal [[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] (verbs agree with both subject and object), [[evidentiality]] (indication of the source and veracity of knowledge), a set of [[topic (linguistics)|topic]] [[grammatical particle|particles]], and suffixes indicating who benefits from an action and the speaker's attitude toward it, but some languages and varieties may lack some of the characteristics.\n\n===Pronouns===\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"  style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em; background:#f9f9f9; border:1px gray solid; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:95%; vertical-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 rowspan=2 style=\"background:white;border-top:2px white solid;border-right:1px solid gray;border-bottom:1px solid gray;border-left:2px white solid;\"|\n| colspan=\"2\"  style=\"text-align:center; background:#9fb6cd;\"|<big>'''Number'''</big>\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#b9d3ee;\"\n||'''''Singular'''''\n||'''''Plural'''''\n|-\n| rowspan=3 style=\"background:#9FB6CD\"|<big>'''Person'''</big>\n|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#b9d3ee;\"|'''''First'''''\n|\u00d1uqa\n|\u00d1uqanchik ''(inclusive)''\n\u00d1uqayku ''(exclusive)''\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#b9d3ee;\"|'''''Second'''''\n|Qam\n|Qamkuna\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#b9d3ee;\"|'''''Third'''''\n|Pay\n|Paykuna\n|}\nIn Quechua, there are seven [[pronoun]]s. First-person plural pronouns (equivalent to \"we\") may be [[clusivity|inclusive or exclusive]]; which mean, respectively, that the [[addressee]] (\"you\") is and is not part of the \"we\". Quechua also adds the suffix ''-kuna'' to the second and third person singular pronouns ''qam'' and ''pay'' to create the plural forms, ''qam-kuna'' and ''pay-kuna''.\n\n===Adjectives===\n[[Adjective]]s in Quechua are always placed before nouns. They lack gender and number and are not declined to agree with [[noun|substantives]].\n\n===Numbers===\n*[[Cardinal number (linguistics)|Cardinal number]]s. ''ch'usaq'' (0), ''huk'' (1), ''iskay'' (2), ''kimsa'' (3), ''tawa'' (4), ''pichqa'' (5), ''suqta'' (6), ''qanchis'' (7), ''pusaq'' (8), ''isqun'' (9), ''chunka'' (10), ''chunka hukniyuq'' (11), ''chunka iskayniyuq'' (12), ''iskay chunka'' (20), ''pachak'' (100), ''waranqa'' (1,000), ''hunu'' (1,000,000), ''lluna'' (1,000,000,000,000).\n*Ordinal numbers. To form ordinal numbers, the word ''\u00f1iqin'' is put after the appropriate cardinal number (''iskay \u00f1iqin'' = \"second\"). The only exception is that, in addition to ''huk \u00f1iqin'' (\"first\"), the phrase ''\u00f1awpaq'' is also used in the somewhat more restricted sense of \"the initial, primordial, the oldest\".\n\n===Nouns===\n[[Noun]] roots accept suffixes that indicate [[grammatical person|person]] (defining of possession, not identity), [[grammatical number|number]], and [[grammatical case|case]]. In general, the personal suffix precedes that of number.

They are also formed by adding suffixes to [[demonstrative]]s: ''chay'' (\"that\") \u2013 ''chaypi'' (\"there\"), ''kay'' (\"this\") \u2013 ''kayman'' (\"hither\").\n\nThere are several original adverbs. For Europeans, it is striking that the adverb ''qhipa'' means both \"behind\" and \"future\" and ''\u00f1awpa'' means \"ahead, in front\" and \"past\".<ref>This occurs in English, where \"before\" means \"in the past\", and Shakespeare's Macbeth says \"The greatest is behind\", meaning in the future.</ref> Local and temporal concepts of adverbs in Quechua (as well as in [[Aymara language|Aymara]]) are associated to each other reversely, compared to European languages. For the speakers of Quechua, we are moving backwards into the future (we cannot see it: it is unknown), facing the past (we can see it: it is remembered).\n\n===Verbs===\nThe infinitive forms (unconjugated) have the suffix ''-y'' (''much'a''= \"kiss\"; ''much'a-y'' = \"to kiss\"). These are the endings for the indicative:\n{| style=\"margin:auto;\"  class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! Present\n! Past\n!Past Habitual\n! Future\n!

Paykuna\n| -n-ku\n| -rqa-(n)ku\n| -q-ku\n| -nqa-ku\n| -sqa-ku\n| -nku-man\n|}\n\nThe suffixes shown in the table above usually indicate the [[grammatical subject|subject]]; the person of the [[grammatical object|object]] is also indicated by a suffix (''-a-'' for first person and ''-su-'' for second person), which precedes the suffixes in the table. In such cases, the plural suffixes from the table (''-chik'' and ''-ku'') can be used to express the number of the object rather than the subject.\n\nVarious suffixes are added to the stem to change the meaning. For example, ''-chi'' is a causative and  ''-ku'' is a reflexive (example: ''wa\u00f1uy'' = \"to die\"; ''wa\u00f1uchiy'' = to kill ''wa\u00f1uchikuy'' = \"to commit suicide\"); ''-naku'' is used for mutual action (example: ''marq'ay''= \"to hug\"; ''marq'anakuy''= \"to hug each other\"), and ''-chka'' is a progressive, used for an ongoing action (e.g., ''mikhuy'' = \"to eat\"; ''mikhuchkay'' = \"to be eating\").\n\n===Grammatical particles===\n[[Grammatical particle|Particles]] are indeclinable: they do not accept suffixes. They are relatively rare, but the most common are ''ar\u00ed'' (\"yes\") and ''mana'' (\"no\"), although ''mana'' can take some suffixes, such as ''-n''/''-m'' (''manan''/''manam''), ''-raq'' (''manaraq'', not yet) and ''-chu'' (''manachu?'', or not?), to intensify the meaning. Other particles are ''yaw'' (\"hey\", \"hi\"), and certain loan words from Spanish, such as ''piru'' (from Spanish ''pero'' \"but\") and ''sinuqa'' (from ''sino'' \"rather\").\n\n===Evidentiality===\nThe Quechuan languages have three different morphemes that mark [[evidentiality]].  Evidentiality refers to a morpheme whose primary purpose is to indicate the source of information.<ref>Aikhenvald 2004, p. 3.</ref>  In Quechuan languages, evidentiality is a three-term system: there are three evidential morphemes that mark varying levels of source information. The markers can apply to first, second, and third persons.<ref name=\"Aikhenvald 2004, p. 377\">Aikhenvald 2004, p. 377.</ref> The chart below depicts an example of these morphemes from [[Wanka Quechua]]:<ref>Aikhenvald 2004, p. 42.</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Evidential morphemes ||''-m(i)'' || ''-chr(a)'' || ''-sh(i)''\n|-\n| Meaning || Direct evidence || Inferred; conjecture || Reported; hearsay\n|}\n\nThe parentheses around the vowels indicate that the vowel can be dropped in when following an open vowel. For the sake of cohesiveness, the above forms are used to discuss the evidential morphemes. There are dialectal variations to the forms. The variations will be presented in the following descriptions.\n\nThe following sentences provide examples of the three evidentials and further discuss the meaning behind each of them.\n\n====''-m(i)'' : Direct evidence and commitment<ref>Floyd 1999, p. 60.</ref>====\nRegional variations: In [[Cusco Quechua]], the direct evidential presents itself as ''\u2013mi''  and ''\u2013n''.\n\nThe evidential ''\u2013mi'' indicates that the speaker has a \"strong personal conviction the veracity of the circumstance expressed.\"<ref>Floyd 1999, p. 57.</ref>  It has the basis of direct personal experience.\n\nWanka Quechua<ref>Floyd 1999, p. 61.</ref>\n{|\n|-\n|''\u00f1awi-i-wan-'''mi''''' ||''lika-la-a''\n|-\n| eye-<small>1P</small>-with-<small>DIR</small> || see-<small>PST</small>-1\n|}\nI saw them with my own eyes.\n\n====''-chr(a)'' : Inference and attenuation<ref>Floyd 1999, p. 95.</ref>====\n\nIn Quechuan languages, not specified by the source, the inference morpheme appears as ''\u2013ch(i), -ch(a), -chr(a)''.\n\nThe ''\u2013chr(a)'' evidential indicates that the utterance is an inference or form of conjecture. That inference relays the speaker's non-commitment to the truth-value of the statement. It also appears in cases such as acquiescence, irony, interrogative constructions, and first person inferences. These uses constitute nonprototypical use and will be discussed later in the ''changes in meaning and other uses'' section.\n\nWanka Quechua<ref>Floyd 1999, p. 103.</ref>\n{|\n|-\n| ''kuti-mu-n'a-qa-'''chr''''' || ''ni-ya-ami''\n|-\n| return-<small>AFAR</small>-<small>3FUT</small>-now-<small>CONJ</small> || say-<small>IMPV</small>-1-<small>DIR</small>\n|}\nI think they will probably come back.\n\n====''-sh(i)'' : Hearsay<ref>Floyd 1999, p. 123.</ref>====\nRegional variations: It can appear as ''\u2013sh(i)'' or ''\u2013s(i)'' depending on the dialect.\n\nWith the use of this morpheme, the speaker \"serves as a conduit through which information from another source passes.\" The information being related is hearsay or revelatory in nature. It also works to express the uncertainty of the speaker regarding the situation. However, it also appears in other constructions that are discussed in the ''changes in meaning'' section.\n\nWanka Quechua<ref>Floyd 1999, p. 127.</ref>\n{|\n|-\n| ''shanti-'''sh''''' || ''prista-ka-mu-la''\n|-\n| Shanti-<small>REP</small> || borrow-<small>REF</small>-<small>AFAR</small>-<small>PST</small>\n|}\n(I was told) Shanti borrowed it.\n\nHintz discusses an interesting case of evidential behavior found in the Sihaus dialect of [[Ancash Quechua]]. The author postulates that instead of three single evidential markers, that Quechuan language contains three pairs of evidential markers.<ref>Hintz 1999, p. 1.</ref>\n\n====Affix or clitic====\nThe evidential morphemes have been referred to as markers or morphemes. The literature seems to differ on whether or not the evidential morphemes are acting as affixes or clitics, in some cases, such as Wanka Quechua, enclitics. Lefebvre and Muysken (1998) discuss this issue in terms of case but remark the line between affix and clitic is not clear.<ref>Lefebvre & Muysken 1998, p. 89.</ref> Both terms are used interchangeably throughout these sections.\n\n====Position in the sentence====\nEvidentials in the Quechuan languages are \"second position enclitics\", which usually attach to the first constituent in the sentence, as shown in this example.<ref>Aikhenvald 2004, p. 68-69.</ref>\n{|\n|-\n| ''huk-'''si''''' || ''ka-sqa'' || ''huk'' || ''machucha-piwan'' || ''payacha''\n|-\n| once-<small>REP</small> || be-<small>SD</small> || one || old.man-<small>WITH</small> || woman\n|}\nOnce, there were an old man and an old woman.\n\nThey can, however, also occur on a focused constituent.\n{|\n|-\n| ''Pidru'' || ''kunana-'''mi''''' || ''wasi-ta'' || ''tuwa-sha-n''\n|-\n| Pedro || now-<small>DIR.EV</small> || house-<small>ACC</small> || build-<small>PROG</small>-<small>3SG</small>\n|}\nIt is now that Pedro is building the house.\n\nSometimes, the affix is described as attaching to the focus, particularly in the Tarma dialect of [[Yaru Quechua]],<ref>Weber 1986, p. 145.</ref> but this does not hold true for all varieties of Quechua. In Huanuco Quechua, the evidentials may follow any number of topics, marked by the topic marker ''\u2013qa'', and the element with the evidential must precede the main verb or be the main verb.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to that rule, and the more topics there are in a sentence, the more likely the sentence is to deviate from the usual pattern.\n{|\n|-\n| ''Chawrana-qa'' || ''puntataruu-qu'' || ''trayaruptin-qa'' || ''wamrata-qa'' || ''mayna-'''shi''''' || ''Diosninchi-qa'' || ''heqarkaykachisha'' || ''syelutana-shi''\n|-\n| so:already-<small>TOP</small> || at:the:peak-<small>TOP</small> || arriving-<small>TOP</small> || child-<small>TOP</small> || already-<small>IND</small> || our:God-<small>TOP</small> || had:taken:her:up || to:heaven:already-<small>IND</small>\n|}\nWhen she (the witch) reached the peak, God had already taken the child up into heaven.\n\n====Changes in meaning and other uses====\nEvidentials can be used to relay different meanings depending on the context and perform other functions. The following examples are restricted to Wanka Quechua.\n\n'''''The direct evidential, -mi'''''\n\nThe direct evidential appears in wh-questions and yes/no questions. By considering the direct evidential in terms of prototypical semantics, it seems somewhat counterintuitive to have a direct evidential, basically an evidential that confirms the speaker's certainty about a topic, in a question. However, if one focuses less on the structure and more on the situation, some sense can be made. The speaker is asking the addressee for information so the speaker assumes the speaker knows the answer. That assumption is where the direct evidential comes into play. The speaker holds a certain amount of certainty that the addressee will know the answer. The speaker interprets the addressee as being in \"direct relation\" to the proposed content; the situation is the same as when, in regular sentences, the speaker assumes direct relation to the proposed information.<ref>Floyd 1999, p. 87.</ref>\n{|\n|-\n| ''imay-'''mi''''' || ''wankayuu-pu'' || ''kuti-mu-la''\n|-\n| when-<small>DIR</small> || Huancayo-<small>ABL</small> || return-<small>AFAR</small>-<small>PAST</small>\n|}\nWhen did he come back from Huancayo?\n\n(Floyd 1999, p. 85)\n\nThe direct evidential affix is also seen in yes/no questions, similar to the situation with wh-questions. Floyd describes yes/no questions as being \"characterized as instructions to the addressee to assert one of the propositions of a disjunction.\"<ref>Floyd 1999, p. 89.</ref> Once again, the burden of direct evidence is being placed on the addressee, not on the speaker. The question marker in Wanka Quechua, ''-chun'', is derived from the negative \u2013chu marker and the direct evidential (realized as \u2013n in some dialects).\n{|\n|-\n| ''tarma-kta'' || ''li-n-'''chun'''''\n|-\n| Tarma-<small>ACC</small> || go-<small>3</small>-<small>YN</small>\n|}\nIs he going to Tarma?\n\n(Floyd 1999, p.&nbsp;89)\n\n====Inferential evidential, -chr(a)====\n\nWhile ''\u2013chr(a)'' is usually used in an inferential context, it has some non-prototypical uses.\n\n''Mild Exhortation''\nIn these constructions the evidential works to reaffirm and encourage the addressee's actions or thoughts.\n{|\n|-\n| ''mas'' || ''kalu-kuna-kta'' || ''li-la-a'' || ''ni-nki-'''chra'''-ri''\n|-\n| more || far-<small>PL</small>-<small>ACC</small> || go-<small>PST</small>-<small>1</small> || say-<small>2</small>-<small>CONJ</small>-<small>EMPH</small>\n|}\nYes, tell them, \"I've gone farther.\"\n\n(Floyd 1999, p.&nbsp;107)\n\nThis example comes from a conversation between husband and wife, discussing the reactions of their family and friends after they have been gone for a while. The husband says he plans to stretch the truth and tell them about distant places to which he has gone, and his wife (in the example above) echoes and encourages his thoughts.\n\n''Acquiescence''\nWith these, the evidential is used to highlight the speaker's assessment of inevitability of an event and acceptance of it. There is a sense of resistance, diminished enthusiasm, and disinclination in these constructions.\n{|\n|-\n| ''paaga-lla-shrayki-'''chra'''-a''\n|-\n| pay-<small>POL</small>-1\u203a2<small>FUT</small>-<small>CONJ</small>-<small>EMPH</small>\n|}\nI suppose I'll pay you then.\n\n(Floyd 1999, p.&nbsp;109)\n\nThis example comes from a discourse where a woman demands compensation from the man (the speaker in the example) whose pigs ruined her potatoes. He denies the pigs as being his but finally realizes he may be responsible and produces the above example.\n\n''Interrogative''\nSomewhat similar to the ''\u2013mi'' evidential, the inferential evidential can be found in content questions. However, the salient difference between the uses of the evidentials in questions is that in the ''\u2013m(i)'' marked questions, an answer is expected. That is not the case with ''\u2013chr(a)'' marked questions.\n{|\n|-\n| ''ima-lla-kta-'''chr''''' || ''u-you-shrun'' || ''llapa'' || ''ayllu-kuna-kta-si'' || ''chra-alu-l''\n|-\n| what-<small>LIM</small>-<small>ACC</small>-<small>CONJ</small> || give-<small>ASP</small>-<small>12FUT</small> || all || family-<small>PL</small>-<small>ACC</small>-<small>EVEN</small> || arrive-<small>ASP</small>-<small>SS</small>\n|}\nI wonder what we will give our families when we arrive.\n\n(Floyd 1999, p. 111)\n\n''Irony''\nIrony in language can be a somewhat complicated topic in how it functions differently in languages, and by its semantic nature, it is already somewhat vague.  For these purposes, it is suffice to say that when irony takes place in Wanka Quechua, the ''\u2013chr(a)'' marker is used.\n\n{|\n|-\n| ''chay-nuu-pa-'''chr''''' || ''yachra-nki''\n|-\n| that-<small>SIM</small>-<small>GEN</small>-<small>CONJ</small> || know-<small>2</small> \n|}\n(I suppose) That's how you learn [that is the way in which you will learn].\n\n(Floyd 199, p.&nbsp;115)\n\nThis example comes from discourse between a father and daughter about her refusal to attend school. It can be interpreted as a genuine statement (perhaps one can learn by resisting school) or as an ironic statement (that is an absurd idea).\n\n====Hearsay evidential, -sh(i)====\n\nAside from being used to express hearsay and revelation, this affix also has other uses.\n\n''Folktales, myths, and legends''\n\nBecause folktales, myths, and legends are, in essence, reported speech, it follows that the hearsay marker would be used with them.  Many of these types of stories are passed down through generations, furthering this aspect of reported speech. A difference between simple hearsay and folktales can be seen in the frequency of the ''\u2013sh(i)'' marker.  In normal conversation using reported speech, the marker is used less, to avoid redundancy.\n\n''Riddles''\n\nRiddles are somewhat similar to myths and folktales in that their nature is to be passed by word of mouth.\n{|\n|-\n| ''ima-lla-'''shi''''' || ''ayka-lla-'''sh''''' || ''juk'' || ''machray-chru'' || ''pu\u00f1u-ya-n'' || ''puka'' || ''waaka''\n|-\n| what-<small>LIM</small>-<small>REP</small> || how^much-<small>LIM</small>-<small>REP</small> || one || cave-<small>LOC</small> || sleep-<small>IMPF</small>-<small>3</small> || red || cow\n|}\n\n(Floyd 1999, p.&nbsp;142)\n\n====Omission and overuse of evidential affixes====\n\nIn certain grammatical structures, the evidential marker does not appear at all. In all Quechuan languages the evidential will not appear in a dependent clause. Sadly, no example was given to depict this omission.<ref>Aikhenvald 2004, p. 72.</ref>\nOmissions occur in Quechua. The sentence is understood to have the same evidentiality as the other sentences in the context. Quechuan speakers vary as to how much they omit evidentials, but they occur only in connected speech.<ref>Aikhenvald 2004, p. 79.</ref>\n\nAn interesting contrast to omission of evidentials is overuse of evidentials. If a speaker uses evidentials too much with no reason, competence is brought into question.  For example, the overuse of \u2013m(i) could lead others to believe that the speaker is not a native speaker or, in some extreme cases, that one is mentally ill.<ref name=\"Aikhenvald 2004, p. 377\"/>\n\n====Cultural aspect====\n\nBy using evidentials, the Quechua culture has certain assumptions about the information being relayed. Those who do not abide by the cultural customs should not be trusted. A passage from Weber (1986) summarizes them nicely below:\n# (Only) one's experience is reliable.\n# Avoid unnecessary risk by assuming responsibility for information of which one is not absolutely certain.\n# Do not be gullible. There are many folktales in which the villain is foiled by his gullibility.\n#Assume responsibility only if it is safe to do so. Successful assumption of responsibility builds stature in the community.<ref>Aikhenvald 2004, p. 358.</ref>\n\nEvidentials also show that being precise and stating the source of one's information is extremely important in the language and the culture. Failure to use them correctly can lead to diminished standing in the community. Speakers are aware of the evidentials and even use proverbs to teach children the importance of being precise and truthful. Precision and information source are of the utmost importance. They are a powerful and resourceful method of human communication.<ref>Aikhenvald 2004, p. 380.</ref>\n\n==Literature==\nAlthough the body of literature in Quechua is not as sizable as its historical and current prominence would suggest, it is nevertheless not negligible.\n\nAs in the case of the [[List of pre-Columbian cultures|pre-Columbian Mesoamerica]], there are a number of surviving Andean documents in the local language that were written down in Latin characters after the European conquest, but they express, to a great extent, the culture of pre-Conquest times. That type of Quechua literature is somewhat scantier, but nevertheless significant. It includes the so-called [[Huarochir\u00ed Manuscript]] (1598), describing the mythology and religion of the valley of [[Huarochir\u00ed Province|Huarochir\u00ed]] as well as Quechua poems quoted within the Spanish-language texts of some chronicles dealing with the pre-Conquest period. There are a number of anonymous or signed Quechua dramas dating from the post-conquest period (starting from the 17th century), some of which deal with the Inca era, while most are on religious topics and of European inspiration. The most famous dramas is ''[[Ollantay]]'' and the plays describing the death of [[Atahualpa]]. For example, [[Juan de Espinosa Medrano]] wrote several dramas in the language.

The Spaniards encouraged its use, so Quechua ultimately [[historical linguistics|survived]] and variants are still widely spoken today, being the co-official language of many regions and the second most spoken language in Peru.\n\n==History==\nQuechua had already expanded across wide ranges of the central Andes long before the expansion of the [[Inca Empire]]. The Inca were one among many peoples in present-day Peru who already spoke a form of Quechua. In the [[Cusco]] region, Quechua was influenced by neighboring languages such as [[Aymara language|Aymara]], which caused it to develop as distinct. In similar ways, diverse dialects developed in different areas, borrowing from local languages, when the Inca Empire ruled and imposed Quechua as the official language.\n\nAfter the [[Spanish conquest of Peru]] in the 16th century, Quechua continued to be used widely by the indigenous peoples as the \"common language\". It was officially recognized by the Spanish administration and many Spanish learned it in order to communicate with local peoples.<ref>{{cite book | title=De la etnohistoria a la historia en los Andes : 51o Congreso Internacional de Americanistas, Santiago de Chile, 2003 | editor1= Fisher, John|editor2=Cahill, David Patrick | publisher=Congreso Internacional de Americanistas | year=2008 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=IFH0Z5_HKVEC&pg=PA295&dq=%22lenguas+generales%22+peru+Virreinato#v=onepage | page=295| isbn= 9789978227398}}</ref>  Clergy of the [[Catholic Church]] adopted Quechua to use as the language of [[evangelism|evangelization]]. Given its use by the Catholic missionaries, the range of Quechua continued to expand in some areas.\n\nIn the late 18th century, colonial officials ended administrative and religious use of Quechua, banning it from public use in Peru after the [[T\u00fapac Amaru II]] rebellion of indigenous peoples.<ref name=adelaar167/> The Crown banned even \"loyal\" pro-Catholic texts in Quechua, such as Garcilaso de la Vega's ''[[Comentarios Reales de los Incas|Comentarios Reales]].''<ref>Aybar cited by Hart, Stephen M. ''A Companion to Latin American Literature,'' p. 6.</ref>\n\nDespite a brief revival of the language immediately after the Latin American nations achieved independence in the 19th century, the prestige of Quechua had decreased sharply. Gradually its use declined so that it was spoken mostly by indigenous people in the more isolated and conservative rural areas. Nevertheless, in the 21st century, Quechua language speakers number 8 to 10 million people across South America,<ref name=adelaar167/> the most speakers of any indigenous language.\n\nThe oldest written records of the language are by missionary [[Domingo de Santo Tom\u00e1s]], who arrived in Peru in 1538 and learned the language from 1540.

The Bible has been translated into Quechua and is distributed by certain missionary groups. Quechua, along with [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and minor indigenous languages, remains essentially a [[spoken language]].\n\nIn recent years, Quechua has been introduced in [[intercultural bilingual education]] (IBE) in [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]]. Even in these areas, the governments are reaching only a part of the Quechua-speaking populations. Some indigenous people in each of the countries are having their children study in Spanish for the purposes of social advancement.<ref>Adelaar 2004, pp. 258\u2013259: \"The Quechua speakers' wish for social mobility for their children is often heard as an argument for not transmitting the language to the next generation.... As observed quite adequately by [[Rodolfo Cerr\u00f3n Palomino|Cerr\u00f3n Palomino]], \"Quechua (and [[Aymaran languages|Aymara]]) speakers seem to have taken the project of assimilation begun by the dominating classes and made it their own.\"</ref>\n\n[[Radio Nacional del Per\u00fa]] broadcasts news and agrarian programs in Quechua for periods in the mornings.\n\nQuechua and Spanish are now heavily intermixed in much of the Andean region, with many hundreds of Spanish loanwords in Quechua. Similarly, Quechua phrases and words are commonly used by Spanish speakers. In southern rural Bolivia, for instance, many Quechua words such as ''wawa'' (infant), ''misi'' (cat), ''waska'' (strap or thrashing), are as commonly used as their Spanish counterparts, even in entirely Spanish-speaking areas. Quechua has also had a profound influence on other native languages of the Americas, such as [[Mapuche language|Mapuche]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===Number of speakers===\nThe number of speakers given varies widely according to the sources. The total in ''Ethnologue'' 16 is 10 million, mostly based on figures published 1987\u20132002, but with a few dating from the 1960s. The figure for Imbabura Highland Quechua in ''Ethnologue'', for example, is 300,000, an estimate from 1977.\n\nThe missionary organization FEDEPI, on the other hand, estimated one million Imbabura dialect speakers (published 2006). Census figures are also problematic, due to under-reporting. The 2001 Ecuador census reports only 500,000 Quechua speakers, compared to the estimate in most linguistic sources of more than 2 million. The censuses of Peru (2007) and Bolivia (2001) are thought to be more reliable.\n\n*Argentina: 900,000 (1971)\n*Bolivia: 2,100,000 (2001 census); 2,800,000 South Bolivian (1987)\n*Chile: few, if any; 8200 in ethnic group (2002 census)\n*Colombia: 4,402 to 16,000<ref>[http://www.ling.fi/DICCIONARIO.htm Alain Fabre, Diccionario etnoling\u00fc\u00edstico y gu\u00eda bibliogr\u00e1fica de los pubelos ind\u00edgenas sudamericanos]</ref>\n*Ecuador: 2,300,000 (Adelaar 1991)\n*Peru: 3,800,000 (2017 census<ref>http://censos2017.inei.gob.pe/redatam/</ref>); 3,500,000 to 4,400,000 (Adelaar 2000)\n\nAdditionally, there are an unknown number of speakers in emigrant communities, including [[Queens]], New York, and [[Paterson, New Jersey]], in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news\n| last = Claudio Torrens\n| title = Some NY immigrants cite lack of Spanish as barrier\n| work = UTSanDiego.com\n| accessdate = 2013-02-10\n| date = 2011-05-28\n| url = http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2011/may/28/some-ny-immigrants-cite-lack-of-spanish-as-barrier/\n}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Quechuan_distribution.svg|thumb|The four branches of Quechua: I (Central), II-A (North Peruvian), II-B (Northern), II-C (Southern)]]\nThere are significant differences among the varieties of Quechua spoken in the central Peruvian highlands and the peripheral varieties of Ecuador, as well as those of southern Peru and Bolivia. They can be labeled Quechua I (or Quechua B, central) and Quechua II (or Quechua A, peripheral). Within the two groups, there are few sharp boundaries, making them [[dialect continuum|dialect continua]].\n\nHowever, there is a secondary division in Quechua II between the grammatically simplified northern varieties of Ecuador, Quechua II-B, known there as [[Kichwa language|Kichwa]], and the generally more conservative varieties of the southern highlands, Quechua II-C, which include the old Inca capital of [[Cusco]]. The closeness is at least in part because of the influence of [[Cusco Quechua]] on the Ecuadorean varieties in the Inca Empire. Because Northern nobles were required to educate their children in Cusco, this was maintained as the [[prestige dialect]] in the north.\n\nSpeakers from different points within any of the three regions can generally understand one another reasonably well. There are nonetheless significant local-level differences across each. ([[Wanka Quechua]], in particular, has several very distinctive characteristics that make the variety more difficult to understand, even for other Central Quechua speakers.) Speakers from different major regions, particularly Central or Southern Quechua, are not able to communicate effectively.\n\nThe lack of [[mutual intelligibility]] among the dialects is the basic criterion that defines Quechua not as a single language, but as a language family. The complex and progressive nature of how speech varies across the dialect continua makes it nearly impossible to differentiate discrete varieties; ''Ethnologue'' lists 45 varieties which are then divided into two groups; Central and Peripheral. Due to the non-intelligibility among the two groups, they are all classified as separate languages.<ref name=Ethnologue>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=que Ethnologue report for Quechua (macrolanguage) (SIL)]</ref>\n\nAs a reference point, the overall degree of diversity across the family is a little less than that of the [[Romance languages|Romance]] or [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] families, and more of the order of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] or [[Arabic]]. The greatest diversity is within Central Quechua, or Quechua I, which is believed to lie close to the homeland of the ancestral Proto-Quechua language.\n\n===Family tree===\n[[Alfredo Torero]] devised the traditional classification, the three divisions above, plus a fourth, a northern or Peruvian branch. The latter causes complications in the classification, however, as the northern dialects ([[Cajamarca\u2013Ca\u00f1aris Quechua|Cajamarca\u2013Ca\u00f1aris]], [[Pacaraos Quechua|Pacaraos]], and [[Yauyos\u2013Chincha Quechua|Yauyos\u2013Chincha]]) have features of both Quechua I and Quechua II, and so are difficult to assign to either.\n\nTorero classifies them as the following:\n\n* [[Quechua I]] or ''Quechua B,'' aka ''Central Quechua'' or ''Waywash,'' spoken in Peru's central highlands and coast.\n** The most widely spoken varieties are Huaylas, Huaylla Wanca, and Conchucos.\n* [[Quechua II]] or ''Quechua A'' or ''Peripheral Quechua'' or ''Wanp'una'', divided into\n** Yungay (Yunkay) Quechua or ''Quechua II A,'' spoken in the northern mountains of Peru; the most widely spoken dialect is Cajamarca.\n** [[Northern Quechua]] or ''Quechua II B,'' spoken in Ecuador ([[Kichwa language|Kichwa]]), northern Peru, and Colombia ([[Inga Kichwa]])\n*** The most widely spoken varieties in this group are Chimborazo Highland Quichua and Imbabura Highland Quichua.\n** [[Southern Quechua]] or ''Quechua II C,'' spoken in Bolivia, southern Peru, Chile, and Argentina.\n*** The most widely spoken varieties are South Bolivian, Cusco, Ayacucho, and Puno (Collao).\n\n<!-- This schematic was introduced with the summary of Torero above, but it does not reflect Torero's classification, and its origin is not clear.\n{{Clade\n| label1=Proto-Quechua\n| 1={{Clade\n  | label1=[[Quechua I]]\n  | 1={{Clade\n     | label1=Central\n     | 1={{Clade\n        | label1='''[[Ancash Quechua|Huaylay]]'''\n        | 1={{Clade\n           | 1=Huaylas\n           | 2=Conchucos}}\n        | label2='''&nbsp;[[Alto Pativilca\u2013Alto Mara\u00f1\u00f3n\u2013Alto Huallaga Quechua|Alto Pativilca\u2013Alto Mara\u00f1\u00f3n\u2013Alto Huallaga]]&nbsp;'''\n        | 2={{Clade\n           | 1=Alto Pativilca\n           | 2=Alto Mara\u00f1\u00f3n\n           | 3=Alto Huallaga }}\n        | label3=Huancay\n        | 3={{Clade\n           | 1='''[[Yaru Quechua|Yaru]]'''\n           | 2='''[[Wanka Quechua|Jauja\u2013Huanca]]'''\n           | 3=[[Yauyos\u2013Chincha Quechua|Huang\u00e1scar\u2013Topar\u00e1]] }} }}\n     | 2=[[Pacaraos Quechua|Pacaraos]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n       }}\n  | label2=[[Quechua II]]\n  | 2={{Clade\n     | label1=Yungay <br/>(Quechua&nbsp;II-A)\n     | 1={{Clade\n        | label2='''[[Northern Peruvian Quechua|Northern Peruvian]]'''\n        | 2={{Clade\n            | 1=Inkawasi\u2013Ka\u00f1aris\n            | 2=Cajamarca}}\n        | label1='''[[Yauyos\u2013Chincha Quechua|Central]]'''\n        | 1={{Clade\n           | 1=Laraos\n           | 2=[[Lincha Quechua|Lincha]]\n           | 3=Apur\u00ed\n           | 4=Chocos\n           | 5=Madean }} }}\n     | label2=Chinchay\n     | 2={{Clade\n        | label1=[[Northern Quechua|Northern]] <br/>(Quechua&nbsp;II-B)\n        | 1={{Clade\n           | 1='''[[Kichwa|Ecuador\u2013Colombia]]'''\n           | 2=[[Chachapoyas Quechua|Chachapoyas]] (Amazonas)\n           | 3=[[Lamas Quechua|Lamas]] (San Mart\u00edn) }}\n        | label2='''Classical'''{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n        | 2={{Clade\n           | 1=\u2020 ''quechua''\n           | label2= '''[[Southern Quechua]]''' <br/>(Quechua&nbsp;II-C)\n           | 2={{Clade\n              | 1=[[Ayacucho Quechua|Ayacucho]]\n              | label2=Cuzco\u2013Collao\n              | 2={{Clade\n                 | 1=[[Cuzco Quechua|Cuzco]]\n                 | 2=Northern Bolivia\n                 | 3=[[South Bolivian Quechua|Southern Bolivia]] }}\n              | 3=[[Santiago del Estero Quichua|Santiago del Estero]] }}}} }} }}}} }}\n-->\n[[Willem Adelaar]] adheres to the Quechua I / Quechua II (central/peripheral) bifurcation.

It is also spoken in the Amazonian lowlands of Colombia, Ecuador, and in pockets in Peru\n*II-C: [[Southern Quechua]], in the highlands further south, from [[Huancavelica]] through the [[Ayacucho]], [[Cusco]], and [[Puno]] regions of [[Peru]], across much of [[Bolivia]], and in pockets in north-western [[Argentina]].

That hypothesis is generally rejected by specialists, however. The parallels are better explained by mutual influence and borrowing through intensive and long-term contact. Many Quechua\u2013Aymara cognates are close, often closer than intra-Quechua cognates, and there is little relationship in the [[affix]]al system. \n\nThe [[Puquina language]] of the [[Tiwanaku Empire]] is a possible source for some of the shared vocabulary between Quechua and Aymara.<ref name=Moulianetal2015>{{cite journal |last1=Moulian |first1=Rodr\u00edgo |last2=Catrileo |first2=Mar\u00eda|last3=Landeo |first3=Pablo|author-link2=Mar\u00eda Catrileo |date=2015 |title=Afines quechua en el vocabulario mapuche de Luis de Valdivia |trans-title=Akins Quechua words in the Mapuche vocabulary of Luis de Valdivia |url=https://scielo.conicyt.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0718-48832015000200004&script=sci_arttext|journal=[[Revista de ling\u00fc\u00edstica te\u00f3rica y aplicada]] |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages= 73\u201396|doi=10.4067/S0718-48832015000200004 |access-date=January 13, 2019|language=Spanish|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\n==Vocabulary==\nA number of Quechua [[loanword]]s have entered [[English language|English]] (also in [[English language|French]] with minor orthographic adaptations) via [[Spanish language|Spanish]], including ''[[coca]]'', ''[[condor]]'', ''[[guano]]'', ''[[jerky]]'', ''[[llama]]'' (''lama'' in French), ''[[pampa]]'', ''[[poncho]]'', ''[[puma (genus)|puma]]'', ''[[quinine]]'', ''[[quinoa]]'', ''[[vicu\u00f1a]]'' (''vigogne'' in French), and, possibly, ''[[gaucho]]''.  The word ''[[lagniappe]]'' comes from the Quechuan word ''yapay'' (\"to increase; to add\"), via Spanish then [[Louisiana French]], with the French or Spanish article ''la'' in front of it, ''la \u00f1apa'' in Louisiana French or Creole, or ''la yapa'' in Spanish.\n\nThe influence on Latin American Spanish includes such borrowings as ''papa'' for \"potato\",  ''chuchaqui'' for \"hangover\" in [[Ecuador]], and diverse borrowings for \"[[altitude sickness]]\", in [[Bolivia]] from Quechuan ''suruqch'i'' to Bolivian ''sorojchi'', in [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]] ''soroche''.\n\nA rare instance of a Quechua word being taken into general Spanish use is given by ''carpa'' for \"tent\" (Quechua ''karpa'').<ref>Edward A. Roberts, ''A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the Spanish Language...'', 2014.</ref>\n\nIn Bolivia, particularly, Quechua words are used extensively even by non-Quechua speakers. These include wawa (baby, infant), ch'aki (hangover), misi (cat), juk'ucho (mouse), q'omer uchu (green pepper), jacu (\"lets go\"), chhiri and chhurco (curly haired), among many others. Quechua grammar also enters Bolivian Spanish, such as the use of the suffix -ri. In Bolivian Quechua, -ri is added to verbs to signify an action is performed with affection or, in the imperative, as a rough equivalent to please. In Bolivia -ri is often included in the Spanish imperative to imply \"please\" or to soften commands. For example, the standard \"p\u00e1same\" (pass me), becomes pasarime.\n\nQuechua has borrowed a large number of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] words, such as ''piru'' (from ''pero'', but), ''bwenu'' (from ''bueno'', good), iskwila (from \"escuela,\" school), waka (from \"vaca,\" cow) and ''burru'' (from ''burro'', donkey).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ru.nl/publish/pages/632031/root_affix_asymmetries.pdf|title=Root/Affix asymmetries in contact and transfer: Case studies from the Andes|last=Muysken|first=Pieter|date=|website=www.ru.nl|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Etymology of Quechua===\nAt first, Spaniards referred to the language of the Inca empire as the ''lengua general'', the ''general language''. The name ''quichua'' was first used in 1560 by [[Domingo de Santo Tom\u00e1s]] in his ''Grammatica o arte de la lengua general de los indios de los reynos del Per\u00fa''.<ref name=Adelaar179>Adelaar 2004, p. 179.</ref> It is not known what name the native speakers gave to their language before colonial times and whether it was Spaniards who called it ''quechua''.<ref name=Adelaar179/>\n\nThere are two possible etymologies of Quechua as the name of the language. There is a possibility that the name Quechua was derived from ''*qi\u0109.wa'', the native word which originally meant the \"temperate valley\" altitude ecological zone in the Andes (suitable for maize cultivation) and to its inhabitants.<ref name=Adelaar179/>\n\nAlternatively, [[Pedro Cieza de Le\u00f3n]] and [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]], the early Spanish chroniclers, mention the existence of a people called Quichua in the present [[Apur\u00edmac Region]], and it could be inferred that their name was given to the entire language.<ref name=Adelaar179/>\n\nThe Hispanicised spellings ''Quechua'' and ''Quichua'' have been used in Peru and Bolivia since the 17th century, especially after the [[Third Council of Lima]]. Today, the various local pronunciations of \"Quechua Simi\" include {{IPA-qu|\u02c8q\u02b0e\u0283wa&nbsp;\u02c8simi|}}, {{IPA-qu|\u02c8\u03c7et\u0283wa&nbsp;\u02c8\u0283imi|}}, {{IPA-qu|\u02c8kit\u0283wa&nbsp;\u02c8\u0283imi|}}, and {{IPA-qu|\u02c8\u0294it\u0283wa&nbsp;\u02c8\u0283imi|}}.\n\nAnother name that native speakers give to their own language is ''runa simi'', \"language of man/people\"; it also seems to have emerged during the colonial period.<ref name=Adelaar179/>\n\n==Phonology==\nThe description below applies to [[Cusco Quechua]]; there are significant differences in other varieties of Quechua.\n\n===Vowels===\nQuechua only has three vowel phonemes: {{IPA|/a/}} {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}, as in Aymara (including [[Jaqaru language|Jaqaru]]). Monolingual speakers pronounce them as {{IPA|[\u00e6, \u026a, \u028a]}} respectively, but [[Spanish language|Spanish]] realizations {{IPA|[\u00e4, i, u]}} may also be found.

Because reflexes of a given Proto-Quechua word may have different stops in neighboring dialects (Proto-Quechua ''\u010daki'' 'foot' becomes ''\u010d'aki'' and ''\u010daka'' 'bridge' becomes ''\u010daka''), they are thought to be innovations in Quechua from [[Aymara language|Aymara]], borrowed independently after branching off from Proto-Quechua.\n\nGemination of the tap {{IPA|/\u027e/}} results in a trill {{IPA|[r]}}.\n\n===Stress===\nStress is penultimate in most dialects of Quechua. In some varieties, factors such as [[apocope]] of word-final vowels may cause exceptional final stress.\n\n==Orthography==\n{{main|Quechua alphabet}}\n{{further|Southern Quechua#Standard Quechua|l1=Southern Quechua \u00a7 Standard Quechua}}\n\nQuechua has been written using the Roman alphabet since the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire]]. However, written Quechua is rarely used by Quechua speakers because of the lack of printed<!--hiding this because incomprehensible/illogical: referential --> material in Quechua.\n\nUntil the 20th century, Quechua was written with a Spanish-based [[orthography]], for example ''Inca, Huayna C\u00e1pac, Collasuyo, Mama Ocllo, Viracocha, quipu, tambo, condor''. This orthography is the most familiar to Spanish speakers and so has been used for most borrowings into English, which essentially always happen through Spanish.\n\nIn 1975, the Peruvian government of [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]] adopted a new orthography for Quechua. This is the system preferred by the [[Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua]], which results in the following spellings of the examples listed above: ''Inka, Wayna Qhapaq, Qollasuyu, Mama Oqllo, Wiraqocha, khipu, tampu, kuntur''. This orthography has the following features:\n* It uses  '''w''' instead of ''hu'' for {{IPA|/w/}}.\n* It distinguishes velar ''k'' from uvular ''q'', both of which were spelled ''c'' or ''qu'' in the traditional system.{{Examples|date=December 2018}}\n* It distinguishes simple, ejective, and aspirated stops in dialects (such as that of the [[Cusco Region]]) that make these distinctions, e.g. the aspirated ''khipu'' above.\n* It continues to use the Spanish five-vowel system.\n\nIn 1985, a variation of this system was adopted by the Peruvian government that uses the Quechuan three-vowel system, resulting in the following spellings: ''Inka, Wayna Qhapaq, Qullasuyu, Mama Uqllu, Wiraqucha, khipu, tampu, kuntur''.\n\nThe different orthographies are still highly controversial in Peru. Advocates of the traditional system believe that the new orthographies look too foreign and believe that it makes Quechua harder to learn for people who have first been exposed to written Spanish. Those who prefer the new system maintain that it better matches the phonology of Quechua, and they point to studies showing that teaching the five-vowel system to children later causes reading difficulties in Spanish.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nFor more on this, see [[Quechuan and Aymaran spelling shift]].\n\nWriters differ in the treatment of Spanish loanwords. These are sometimes adapted to the modern orthography and sometimes left as in Spanish. For instance, \"I am Roberto\" could be written ''Robertom kani'' or ''Ruwirtum kani''. (The ''-m'' is not part of the name; it is an evidential suffix, showing how the information is known: firsthand, in this case.)\n\nThe Peruvian linguist [[Rodolfo Cerr\u00f3n Palomino]] has proposed an orthographic norm for all of [[Southern Quechua]]: this Standard Quechua (''el Quechua est\u00e1ndar'' or ''Hanan Runasimi'') conservatively integrates features of the two widespread dialects [[Ayacucho Quechua]] and [[Cusco Quechua]]. For instance:<ref>To listen to recordings of these and many other words as pronounced in many different Quechua-speaking regions, see the external website [http://www.quechua.org.uk/Eng/Sounds The Sounds of the Andean Languages].

According to article 20 of the decree ''Decreto Supremo No 004-2016-MC'', which approves regulations relative to Law 29735, published in the  official newspaper El Peruano on July 22, 2016, adequate spellings of the [[toponym]]s in the normalized alphabets of the indigenous languages must progressively be proposed, with the aim of standardizing the spellings used by the National Geographic Institute ''(Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico Nacional, IGN)'' The IGN implements the necessary changes on the official maps of Peru.<ref name=decree>{{cite web |url=http://busquedas.elperuano.com.pe/normaslegales/decreto-supremo-que-aprueba-el-reglamento-de-la-ley-n-29735-decreto-supremo-n-004-2016-mc-1407753-5/|title=Decreto Supremo que aprueba el Reglamento de la Ley N\u00b0 29735, Ley que regula el uso, preservaci\u00f3n, desarrollo, recuperaci\u00f3n, fomento y difusi\u00f3n de las lenguas originarias del Per\u00fa, Decreto Supremo N\u00b0 004-2016-MC|last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=July 10, 2017|quote=}}</ref>\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Morphological type===\nQuechua is an agglutinating language. Words are built up from basic roots followed by several suffixes each of which carry one meaning. All varieties of Quechua are very regular [[agglutinative language]]s, as opposed to [[isolating language|isolating]] or [[fusional language|fusional]] ones  [Thompson]. Their normal sentence order is SOV ([[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]]). Their large number of [[suffix]]es changes both the overall meaning of words and their subtle shades of meaning.  Notable grammatical features include bipersonal [[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] (verbs agree with both subject and object), [[evidentiality]] (indication of the source and veracity of knowledge), a set of [[topic (linguistics)|topic]] [[grammatical particle|particles]], and suffixes indicating who benefits from an action and the speaker's attitude toward it, but some languages and varieties may lack some of the characteristics.\n\n===Pronouns===\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"  style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em; background:#f9f9f9; border:1px gray solid; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:95%; vertical-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 rowspan=2 style=\"background:white;border-top:2px white solid;border-right:1px solid gray;border-bottom:1px solid gray;border-left:2px white solid;\"|\n| colspan=\"2\"  style=\"text-align:center; background:#9fb6cd;\"|<big>'''Number'''</big>\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#b9d3ee;\"\n||'''''Singular'''''\n||'''''Plural'''''\n|-\n| rowspan=3 style=\"background:#9FB6CD\"|<big>'''Person'''</big>\n|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#b9d3ee;\"|'''''First'''''\n|\u00d1uqa\n|\u00d1uqanchik ''(inclusive)''\n\u00d1uqayku ''(exclusive)''\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#b9d3ee;\"|'''''Second'''''\n|Qam\n|Qamkuna\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:center; background:#b9d3ee;\"|'''''Third'''''\n|Pay\n|Paykuna\n|}\nIn Quechua, there are seven [[pronoun]]s. First-person plural pronouns (equivalent to \"we\") may be [[clusivity|inclusive or exclusive]]; which mean, respectively, that the [[addressee]] (\"you\") is and is not part of the \"we\". Quechua also adds the suffix ''-kuna'' to the second and third person singular pronouns ''qam'' and ''pay'' to create the plural forms, ''qam-kuna'' and ''pay-kuna''.\n\n===Adjectives===\n[[Adjective]]s in Quechua are always placed before nouns. They lack gender and number and are not declined to agree with [[noun|substantives]].\n\n===Numbers===\n*[[Cardinal number (linguistics)|Cardinal number]]s. ''ch'usaq'' (0), ''huk'' (1), ''iskay'' (2), ''kimsa'' (3), ''tawa'' (4), ''pichqa'' (5), ''suqta'' (6), ''qanchis'' (7), ''pusaq'' (8), ''isqun'' (9), ''chunka'' (10), ''chunka hukniyuq'' (11), ''chunka iskayniyuq'' (12), ''iskay chunka'' (20), ''pachak'' (100), ''waranqa'' (1,000), ''hunu'' (1,000,000), ''lluna'' (1,000,000,000,000).\n*Ordinal numbers. To form ordinal numbers, the word ''\u00f1iqin'' is put after the appropriate cardinal number (''iskay \u00f1iqin'' = \"second\"). The only exception is that, in addition to ''huk \u00f1iqin'' (\"first\"), the phrase ''\u00f1awpaq'' is also used in the somewhat more restricted sense of \"the initial, primordial, the oldest\".\n\n===Nouns===\n[[Noun]] roots accept suffixes that indicate [[grammatical person|person]] (defining of possession, not identity), [[grammatical number|number]], and [[grammatical case|case]]. In general, the personal suffix precedes that of number. In the [[Santiago del Estero]] variety, however, the order is reversed.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|first = Jorge R.\n|last = Alderetes\n|title = Morfolog\u00eda nominal del quechua santiague\u00f1o\n|year = 1997\n|id=\n|isbn=\n|url=http://usuarios.arnet.com.ar/yanasu/Cap3-1.htm\n}}</ref> From variety to variety, suffixes may change.\n\n{| style=\"margin:auto;\"  class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples using the word ''wasi'' (house)''\n! colspan=2 | Function\n!

They are also formed by adding suffixes to [[demonstrative]]s: ''chay'' (\"that\") \u2013 ''chaypi'' (\"there\"), ''kay'' (\"this\") \u2013 ''kayman'' (\"hither\").\n\nThere are several original adverbs. For Europeans, it is striking that the adverb ''qhipa'' means both \"behind\" and \"future\" and ''\u00f1awpa'' means \"ahead, in front\" and \"past\".<ref>This occurs in English, where \"before\" means \"in the past\", and Shakespeare's Macbeth says \"The greatest is behind\", meaning in the future.</ref> Local and temporal concepts of adverbs in Quechua (as well as in [[Aymara language|Aymara]]) are associated to each other reversely, compared to European languages. For the speakers of Quechua, we are moving backwards into the future (we cannot see it: it is unknown), facing the past (we can see it: it is remembered).\n\n===Verbs===\nThe infinitive forms (unconjugated) have the suffix ''-y'' (''much'a''= \"kiss\"; ''much'a-y'' = \"to kiss\"). These are the endings for the indicative:\n{| style=\"margin:auto;\"  class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! Present\n! Past\n!Past Habitual\n! Future\n!

In such cases, the plural suffixes from the table (''-chik'' and ''-ku'') can be used to express the number of the object rather than the subject.\n\nVarious suffixes are added to the stem to change the meaning. For example, ''-chi'' is a causative and  ''-ku'' is a reflexive (example: ''wa\u00f1uy'' = \"to die\"; ''wa\u00f1uchiy'' = to kill ''wa\u00f1uchikuy'' = \"to commit suicide\"); ''-naku'' is used for mutual action (example: ''marq'ay''= \"to hug\"; ''marq'anakuy''= \"to hug each other\"), and ''-chka'' is a progressive, used for an ongoing action (e.g., ''mikhuy'' = \"to eat\"; ''mikhuchkay'' = \"to be eating\").\n\n===Grammatical particles===\n[[Grammatical particle|Particles]] are indeclinable: they do not accept suffixes. They are relatively rare, but the most common are ''ar\u00ed'' (\"yes\") and ''mana'' (\"no\"), although ''mana'' can take some suffixes, such as ''-n''/''-m'' (''manan''/''manam''), ''-raq'' (''manaraq'', not yet) and ''-chu'' (''manachu?'', or not?), to intensify the meaning. Other particles are ''yaw'' (\"hey\", \"hi\"), and certain loan words from Spanish, such as ''piru'' (from Spanish ''pero'' \"but\") and ''sinuqa'' (from ''sino'' \"rather\").\n\n===Evidentiality===\nThe Quechuan languages have three different morphemes that mark [[evidentiality]].  Evidentiality refers to a morpheme whose primary purpose is to indicate the source of information.<ref>Aikhenvald 2004, p. 3.</ref>  In Quechuan languages, evidentiality is a three-term system: there are three evidential morphemes that mark varying levels of source information. The markers can apply to first, second, and third persons.<ref name=\"Aikhenvald 2004, p. 377\">Aikhenvald 2004, p. 377.</ref> The chart below depicts an example of these morphemes from [[Wanka Quechua]]:<ref>Aikhenvald 2004, p. 42.</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Evidential morphemes ||''-m(i)'' || ''-chr(a)'' || ''-sh(i)''\n|-\n| Meaning || Direct evidence || Inferred; conjecture || Reported; hearsay\n|}\n\nThe parentheses around the vowels indicate that the vowel can be dropped in when following an open vowel.

The literature seems to differ on whether or not the evidential morphemes are acting as affixes or clitics, in some cases, such as Wanka Quechua, enclitics. Lefebvre and Muysken (1998) discuss this issue in terms of case but remark the line between affix and clitic is not clear.<ref>Lefebvre & Muysken 1998, p. 89.</ref> Both terms are used interchangeably throughout these sections.\n\n====Position in the sentence====\nEvidentials in the Quechuan languages are \"second position enclitics\", which usually attach to the first constituent in the sentence, as shown in this example.<ref>Aikhenvald 2004, p. 68-69.</ref>\n{|\n|-\n| ''huk-'''si''''' || ''ka-sqa'' || ''huk'' || ''machucha-piwan'' || ''payacha''\n|-\n| once-<small>REP</small> || be-<small>SD</small> || one || old.man-<small>WITH</small> || woman\n|}\nOnce, there were an old man and an old woman.\n\nThey can, however, also occur on a focused constituent.\n{|\n|-\n| ''Pidru'' || ''kunana-'''mi''''' || ''wasi-ta'' || ''tuwa-sha-n''\n|-\n| Pedro || now-<small>DIR.EV</small> || house-<small>ACC</small> || build-<small>PROG</small>-<small>3SG</small>\n|}\nIt is now that Pedro is building the house.\n\nSometimes, the affix is described as attaching to the focus, particularly in the Tarma dialect of [[Yaru Quechua]],<ref>Weber 1986, p. 145.</ref> but this does not hold true for all varieties of Quechua. In Huanuco Quechua, the evidentials may follow any number of topics, marked by the topic marker ''\u2013qa'', and the element with the evidential must precede the main verb or be the main verb.\n\nHowever, there are exceptions to that rule, and the more topics there are in a sentence, the more likely the sentence is to deviate from the usual pattern.\n{|\n|-\n| ''Chawrana-qa'' || ''puntataruu-qu'' || ''trayaruptin-qa'' || ''wamrata-qa'' || ''mayna-'''shi''''' || ''Diosninchi-qa'' || ''heqarkaykachisha'' || ''syelutana-shi''\n|-\n| so:already-<small>TOP</small> || at:the:peak-<small>TOP</small> || arriving-<small>TOP</small> || child-<small>TOP</small> || already-<small>IND</small> || our:God-<small>TOP</small> || had:taken:her:up || to:heaven:already-<small>IND</small>\n|}\nWhen she (the witch) reached the peak, God had already taken the child up into heaven.\n\n====Changes in meaning and other uses====\nEvidentials can be used to relay different meanings depending on the context and perform other functions. The following examples are restricted to Wanka Quechua.\n\n'''''The direct evidential, -mi'''''\n\nThe direct evidential appears in wh-questions and yes/no questions. By considering the direct evidential in terms of prototypical semantics, it seems somewhat counterintuitive to have a direct evidential, basically an evidential that confirms the speaker's certainty about a topic, in a question. However, if one focuses less on the structure and more on the situation, some sense can be made. The speaker is asking the addressee for information so the speaker assumes the speaker knows the answer. That assumption is where the direct evidential comes into play. The speaker holds a certain amount of certainty that the addressee will know the answer. The speaker interprets the addressee as being in \"direct relation\" to the proposed content; the situation is the same as when, in regular sentences, the speaker assumes direct relation to the proposed information.<ref>Floyd 1999, p. 87.</ref>\n{|\n|-\n| ''imay-'''mi''''' || ''wankayuu-pu'' || ''kuti-mu-la''\n|-\n| when-<small>DIR</small> || Huancayo-<small>ABL</small> || return-<small>AFAR</small>-<small>PAST</small>\n|}\nWhen did he come back from Huancayo?\n\n(Floyd 1999, p. 85)\n\nThe direct evidential affix is also seen in yes/no questions, similar to the situation with wh-questions. Floyd describes yes/no questions as being \"characterized as instructions to the addressee to assert one of the propositions of a disjunction.\"<ref>Floyd 1999, p. 89.</ref> Once again, the burden of direct evidence is being placed on the addressee, not on the speaker. The question marker in Wanka Quechua, ''-chun'', is derived from the negative \u2013chu marker and the direct evidential (realized as \u2013n in some dialects).\n{|\n|-\n| ''tarma-kta'' || ''li-n-'''chun'''''\n|-\n| Tarma-<small>ACC</small> || go-<small>3</small>-<small>YN</small>\n|}\nIs he going to Tarma?\n\n(Floyd 1999, p.&nbsp;89)\n\n====Inferential evidential, -chr(a)====\n\nWhile ''\u2013chr(a)'' is usually used in an inferential context, it has some non-prototypical uses.\n\n''Mild Exhortation''\nIn these constructions the evidential works to reaffirm and encourage the addressee's actions or thoughts.\n{|\n|-\n| ''mas'' || ''kalu-kuna-kta'' || ''li-la-a'' || ''ni-nki-'''chra'''-ri''\n|-\n| more || far-<small>PL</small>-<small>ACC</small> || go-<small>PST</small>-<small>1</small> || say-<small>2</small>-<small>CONJ</small>-<small>EMPH</small>\n|}\nYes, tell them, \"I've gone farther.\"\n\n(Floyd 1999, p.&nbsp;107)\n\nThis example comes from a conversation between husband and wife, discussing the reactions of their family and friends after they have been gone for a while. The husband says he plans to stretch the truth and tell them about distant places to which he has gone, and his wife (in the example above) echoes and encourages his thoughts.\n\n''Acquiescence''\nWith these, the evidential is used to highlight the speaker's assessment of inevitability of an event and acceptance of it. There is a sense of resistance, diminished enthusiasm, and disinclination in these constructions.\n{|\n|-\n| ''paaga-lla-shrayki-'''chra'''-a''\n|-\n| pay-<small>POL</small>-1\u203a2<small>FUT</small>-<small>CONJ</small>-<small>EMPH</small>\n|}\nI suppose I'll pay you then.\n\n(Floyd 1999, p.&nbsp;109)\n\nThis example comes from a discourse where a woman demands compensation from the man (the speaker in the example) whose pigs ruined her potatoes. He denies the pigs as being his but finally realizes he may be responsible and produces the above example.\n\n''Interrogative''\nSomewhat similar to the ''\u2013mi'' evidential, the inferential evidential can be found in content questions. However, the salient difference between the uses of the evidentials in questions is that in the ''\u2013m(i)'' marked questions, an answer is expected. That is not the case with ''\u2013chr(a)'' marked questions.\n{|\n|-\n| ''ima-lla-kta-'''chr''''' || ''u-you-shrun'' || ''llapa'' || ''ayllu-kuna-kta-si'' || ''chra-alu-l''\n|-\n| what-<small>LIM</small>-<small>ACC</small>-<small>CONJ</small> || give-<small>ASP</small>-<small>12FUT</small> || all || family-<small>PL</small>-<small>ACC</small>-<small>EVEN</small> || arrive-<small>ASP</small>-<small>SS</small>\n|}\nI wonder what we will give our families when we arrive.\n\n(Floyd 1999, p. 111)\n\n''Irony''\nIrony in language can be a somewhat complicated topic in how it functions differently in languages, and by its semantic nature, it is already somewhat vague.  For these purposes, it is suffice to say that when irony takes place in Wanka Quechua, the ''\u2013chr(a)'' marker is used.\n\n{|\n|-\n| ''chay-nuu-pa-'''chr''''' || ''yachra-nki''\n|-\n| that-<small>SIM</small>-<small>GEN</small>-<small>CONJ</small> || know-<small>2</small> \n|}\n(I suppose) That's how you learn [that is the way in which you will learn].\n\n(Floyd 199, p.&nbsp;115)\n\nThis example comes from discourse between a father and daughter about her refusal to attend school. It can be interpreted as a genuine statement (perhaps one can learn by resisting school) or as an ironic statement (that is an absurd idea).\n\n====Hearsay evidential, -sh(i)====\n\nAside from being used to express hearsay and revelation, this affix also has other uses.\n\n''Folktales, myths, and legends''\n\nBecause folktales, myths, and legends are, in essence, reported speech, it follows that the hearsay marker would be used with them.  Many of these types of stories are passed down through generations, furthering this aspect of reported speech. A difference between simple hearsay and folktales can be seen in the frequency of the ''\u2013sh(i)'' marker.  In normal conversation using reported speech, the marker is used less, to avoid redundancy.\n\n''Riddles''\n\nRiddles are somewhat similar to myths and folktales in that their nature is to be passed by word of mouth.\n{|\n|-\n| ''ima-lla-'''shi''''' || ''ayka-lla-'''sh''''' || ''juk'' || ''machray-chru'' || ''pu\u00f1u-ya-n'' || ''puka'' || ''waaka''\n|-\n| what-<small>LIM</small>-<small>REP</small> || how^much-<small>LIM</small>-<small>REP</small> || one || cave-<small>LOC</small> || sleep-<small>IMPF</small>-<small>3</small> || red || cow\n|}\n\n(Floyd 1999, p.&nbsp;142)\n\n====Omission and overuse of evidential affixes====\n\nIn certain grammatical structures, the evidential marker does not appear at all. In all Quechuan languages the evidential will not appear in a dependent clause. Sadly, no example was given to depict this omission.<ref>Aikhenvald 2004, p. 72.</ref>\nOmissions occur in Quechua. The sentence is understood to have the same evidentiality as the other sentences in the context. Quechuan speakers vary as to how much they omit evidentials, but they occur only in connected speech.<ref>Aikhenvald 2004, p. 79.</ref>\n\nAn interesting contrast to omission of evidentials is overuse of evidentials. If a speaker uses evidentials too much with no reason, competence is brought into question.  For example, the overuse of \u2013m(i) could lead others to believe that the speaker is not a native speaker or, in some extreme cases, that one is mentally ill.<ref name=\"Aikhenvald 2004, p. 377\"/>\n\n====Cultural aspect====\n\nBy using evidentials, the Quechua culture has certain assumptions about the information being relayed. Those who do not abide by the cultural customs should not be trusted. A passage from Weber (1986) summarizes them nicely below:\n# (Only) one's experience is reliable.\n# Avoid unnecessary risk by assuming responsibility for information of which one is not absolutely certain.\n# Do not be gullible. There are many folktales in which the villain is foiled by his gullibility.\n#Assume responsibility only if it is safe to do so. Successful assumption of responsibility builds stature in the community.<ref>Aikhenvald 2004, p. 358.</ref>\n\nEvidentials also show that being precise and stating the source of one's information is extremely important in the language and the culture. Failure to use them correctly can lead to diminished standing in the community. Speakers are aware of the evidentials and even use proverbs to teach children the importance of being precise and truthful. Precision and information source are of the utmost importance. They are a powerful and resourceful method of human communication.<ref>Aikhenvald 2004, p. 380.</ref>\n\n==Literature==\nAlthough the body of literature in Quechua is not as sizable as its historical and current prominence would suggest, it is nevertheless not negligible.\n\nAs in the case of the [[List of pre-Columbian cultures|pre-Columbian Mesoamerica]], there are a number of surviving Andean documents in the local language that were written down in Latin characters after the European conquest, but they express, to a great extent, the culture of pre-Conquest times. That type of Quechua literature is somewhat scantier, but nevertheless significant. It includes the so-called [[Huarochir\u00ed Manuscript]] (1598), describing the mythology and religion of the valley of [[Huarochir\u00ed Province|Huarochir\u00ed]] as well as Quechua poems quoted within the Spanish-language texts of some chronicles dealing with the pre-Conquest period. There are a number of anonymous or signed Quechua dramas dating from the post-conquest period (starting from the 17th century), some of which deal with the Inca era, while most are on religious topics and of European inspiration. The most famous dramas is ''[[Ollantay]]'' and the plays describing the death of [[Atahualpa]]. For example, [[Juan de Espinosa Medrano]] wrote several dramas in the language. Poems in Quechua were also composed during the colonial period.<ref name=adelaar254/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robert_beer/history.htm |title=History |publisher=Homepage.ntlworld.com |accessdate=2012-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515235927/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/robert_beer/history.htm |archive-date=2013-05-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThere is at least one Quechuan version of the [[Bible]].<ref name=CollynsCollantes/>\n\nDramas and poems continued to be written in the 19th and especially in 20th centuries as well; in addition, in the 20th century and more recently, more prose has been published.

It is today a significant tourist destination.\n\nThe county itself was formed following the [[Plantations of Ireland#Early Plantations (1556\u20131576)|Tudor plantations]] of Laois and Offaly in an attempt by the [[English Crown]] to expand its sphere of influence in Ireland which had declined following the [[Norman Conquest of Ireland]]. Both Laois (Leix) and Offaly (U\u00ed Failghe) were [[petty kingdom]]s in [[Gaelic Ireland]] located just outside the [[The Pale|Pale]] (a region around Dublin and the mid east of Ireland that remained loyal to the [[English Crown]] following the [[Norman Conquest]]). The older kingdoms of Leix and U\u00ed Failghe are not coterminous with the present day counties that were formed. The [[Kingdom of U\u00ed Failghe]] from which the name '''Offaly''' is derived, was ruled by the '''\u00d3 Conchobhair Failghe''' (anglicised as: O'Conor Faly) whose territory extended from the east of the county into north Kildare. The Kingdom of Firceall ruled by the '''O'Molloy''' clan constituted much of the centre of the county. The Kingdom of [[Firceall]] was part of the [[Kingdom of Meath]] while U\u00ed Failghe was part of the [[Kingdom of Leinster]]. Much of the south of the present day county (as well as northern [[County Tipperary]]) was ruled by '''\u00d3 Cearbhaill of [[\u00c9ile]]''' (anglicised as: O'Carroll Ely). Ely formed part of the [[Kingdom of Munster]].  These [[petty kingdom]]s were swept aside by the [[Plantations of Ireland#Early Plantations (1556\u20131576)|Tudor plantations]]. In 1556, an Act of the [[Parliament of Ireland]] created \"King's County\", named after [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]], the then [[king of Ireland]].<ref>3 & 4 Phil & Mar, c.2 (1556)</ref> This replaced the old Kingdoms with [[Baronies of Ireland|Baronies]] and the present day County System.\n\nDespite the county's name being upheld as Offaly through the 2001 Local Government Act, no legislation was ever enacted after independence explicitly changing the name from King's County, the name formally established under the 1898 Local Government Act which continued to have legal effect. Legal transfers and assignments of [[Real property|land]] in the county still refer to it as \"King's County\".\n\n==Places of interest==\n[[File:Birr Castle, Offaly.jpg|right|thumb|[[Birr Castle]]]]\n[[File:Sunrise- 60 Degrees, Sky Train, December 28,2008 lo res.jpg|thumb|[[Sculpture in the Parklands|Sculpture Park]] at [[Boora Bog|Lough Boora]]]]\n* [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]] in the south of the county is best known for its castle and gardens.

The population increased by 11.3% between 2002 and 2006 which was a greater rate than the national average rate of 8.2%. This may be attributed to the county's proximity to the [[Greater Dublin Area]], increased accessibility to [[Dublin]] ([[M6 motorway (Ireland)|M6]], [[M7 motorway (Ireland)|M7]], and improved rail services) and lower house prices than in Dublin.<ref name=\"DC\"/>\n\nThe population of many towns rose during the period 1996 to 2006: Birr +21.5%, Tullamore +28.8% and Edenderry +53.9%. The population of [[Portarlington, County Laois|Portarlington]] increased by 50.1% between 2002 and 2006.<ref name=\"DC\"/>\n\nThe population as of census 2016 was 77,961 people with 34.7% (27,085 people) under the age of 25 and 13.6% (10,951 people) over the age of 65.<ref name=cso2016/>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Bord na Mona - \"The Bog Train\" - At Edenderry, Co. Offaly, Ireland (14225837858).jpg|thumb|Commercial [[peat]] extraction was traditionally the largest industry in the county]]\nTraditionally, agriculture and industry have been the main driving force of the economy in the county. Offaly has extensive bogland, particularly in the northern parts of the county, that forms part of the [[Bog of Allen]]. [[Bord na M\u00f3na]] was founded in 1946 and provided employment to hundreds of people in Offaly by making peat briquettes (for home domestic use) and supplying peat to power stations operated by [[ESB Group|ESB]]. Peat briquettes are currently made at the Bord na M\u00f3na factory at Derrinlough near Birr. Power stations are operating at [[Shannonbridge]] and Edenderry. With the continuing depletion of the bogs a number of power stations have closed down in recent years. The ESB power station at Lumcloon, [[Ferbane]] was a major employer in the midlands but closed in 2001. [[Rhode, County Offaly|Rhode]] power station closed down soon afterwards. These were major landmarks in Offaly with large [[cooling tower]]s that were visible for miles around Offaly and beyond, but were demolished soon after the stations closed. Many bogs are now used as wildlife reserves or for tourism activities such as Lough Boora.\n\nThe opening of the [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal]] in the 18th century brought prosperity to towns such as [[Banagher]] and [[Tullamore]]. Both towns were important stops on the [[Dublin]] to [[Limerick]] navigation which supported a number of industries and brought cheap and efficient water transport to the county in that era.\n\nThe [[Celtic Tiger]] also brought an increase in economic activity to Offaly with business enterprise and industrial parks opening in Birr, Edenderry and [[Tullamore]]. Many people particularly in the east of the county are within an easy commuting distance to [[Dublin]] where many find employment.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n===Transport===\n====Rail====\n[[File:Clara Station - geograph.org.uk - 2236128.jpg|thumb|right|[[Clara railway station]]]]\nOffaly is well served by rail transport. Railway stations are located at [[Tullamore railway station|Tullamore]] and [[Clara railway station|Clara]]. Both stations are on the main [[Dublin-Westport/Galway railway line]] with regular trains serving the area especially for [[Dublin]] commuters. [[Portarlington railway station]] is located just over the [[County Laois]] border and is in a catchment area for the south east of the county. Portarlington railway station is on the main [[Dublin-Cork railway line]] with regular commuter services to [[Heuston Station]], Dublin and intercity services to [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]], [[Killarney]] & [[Tralee]].\n\nThe [[Limerick-Ballybrophy railway line]] travels through the south of the county however there are no railway stations on the line in County Offaly. The nearest stations are located at [[Cloughjordan railway station|Cloughjordan]] and [[Roscrea railway station|Roscrea]] both just outside the county boundary. A railway line from Birr connected to the line at Roscrea until it was closed in the 1960s. A controversial railway line also connected Birr to [[Portumna]] between 1868 and 1878, and became something of a folk legend.\n\n====Road====\n[[File:OffalyRoadMap.png|thumb|right|Road network of Offaly]]\nThree main national secondary routes pass through the county. The [[N52 road (Ireland)|N52 road]] passes from [[Kilbeggan]] to Tullamore and Birr which then continues to [[Nenagh]] where it intersects with the [[M7 motorway (Ireland)|M7]]. The [[N62 road (Ireland)|N62]] from [[Athlone]] passes through [[Ferbane]] and Birr and continues onto [[Roscrea]] and [[Thurles]]. The [[N80 road (Ireland)|N80]] route starts in Tullamore and continues to the south east passing through [[Portlaoise]] and [[Carlow]]. There are no main national primary routes in the county, however, the [[M6 motorway (Ireland)|M6]] skirts the county to the north and the [[M7 motorway (Ireland)|M7]] skirts the county to the south through [[Moneygall]]. Road infrastructure has improved with the completion of the Tullamore bypass in 2009 and improved access to regional cities following completion of the intercity motorway network.\n\n====Bus====\n[[Bus \u00c9ireann]] provide public transport services throughout the county with regular bus services to [[Limerick]] and [[Waterford]] from Athlone bus station. Other private bus coach services provide direct bus services from Birr to [[Dublin]] such as Kearns bus service who run several services daily. Slieve Bloom Coaches run services from Tullamore and Portarlington to Dublin.\n[[File:Ballycommon Radio Mast Offaly.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Radio transmitter in [[Ballycommon]]]]\n====Waterway====\nThe [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal]] connecting Dublin to the river Shannon was constructed through the towns of Edenderry and Tullamore and joins the Shannon at [[Shannon Harbour]]. Traditionally this was an important route for transport, communication and trade between Dublin, Limerick and the midlands of Ireland. The route fell into decline as road transport became more popular. Much of the route is now used for [[boating]] and leisure activities.\n\n===Media===\n====Radio====\n[[Midlands 103]] (originally Midlands Radio 3) which broadcasts to Laois, Offaly and Westmeath is based in Tullamore and has studios across the midlands. \nRT\u00c9's [[medium wave transmitter]] broadcasting [[RT\u00c9 Radio 1]] was also located in Tullamore but transmission stopped in 2008.\n\n====Print====\nA number of local newspapers are published in Offaly. The [[Offaly Independent]] and Tullamore Tribune are based in Tullamore. The Midland Tribune based in Birr covers local news in the west and south of the county as well as parts of northern Tipperary including the towns of Birr, [[Roscrea]] and [[Nenagh]] and surrounding areas. The [[Offaly Express]] was a former newspaper based in Tullamore. It closed down in July 2012 after 29 years in operation. It is now an on line news platform for the county at www.offalyexpress.ie [http://www.offalyexpress.ie]\n\n==Sport==\n===GAA===\n[[File:Seir Kieran, Offaly JHC champions 1937 and IHC champions 1938.png|thumb|right|[[Seir Kieran GAA]] [[hurling|hurlers]], 1938]]\n[[Gaelic games]] are popular in the county. [[Offaly GAA]] consists of some 44 clubs playing [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]] in communities throughout the county. [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]] is generally considered a hurling stronghold with [[Birr GAA]] winning four [[All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship]]s. County teams have also had national success in both hurling and football, winning the [[Liam MacCarthy Cup]] four times and the [[Sam Maguire Cup]] three times. The football team is perhaps best known for the [[Seamus Darby]] goal in the \ndying minutes of the [[1982 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|1982 football final]] when Offaly took the title by one point denying [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] an historic five All-Ireland titles in a row. \nTraditionally, west Offaly has been the hurling stronghold with clubs like [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]], [[Coolderry]], And [[Kilcormac/Killoughey]] enjoying success in the [[Leinster]] and All-Ireland Championships\n\nFamous hurlers from Offaly include:\n*Brian Whelahan, [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]]\n*The Dooley Brothers, [[Clareen]]\n*Brian Carroll, [[Coolderry]]\n*Rory Hanniffy, [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]]\n*Shane Dooley, [[Tullamore]]\n*Michael Duignan, [[Banagher]]\n[[File:Shane Lowry 8107.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[2019 Open Championship]] winner [[Shane Lowry (golfer)|Shane Lowry]]]]\nFamous Footballers from Offaly include:\n*Matt Conor, [[Walsh Island]]\n*Richie Conor, [[Walsh Island]]\n*Ciar\u00e1n McManus, [[Tubber, County Offaly|Tubber]]\n*Niall McNamee, [[Rhode, County Offaly|Rhode]]\n*Martin Furlong, [[Tullamore]]\n*Seamus Darby, [[Rhode, County Offaly|Rhode]]\n*Mick Brady, [[Edenderry]]\n*Finbarr Cullen, [[Edenderry]]\n\n===Association football===\n[[Tullamore Town F.C.]] play at [[Leah Victoria Park]].

Offaly borders seven counties: [[County Galway|Galway]], [[County Roscommon|Roscommon]], [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]], [[County Laois|Laois]], [[County Westmeath|Westmeath]], [[County Kildare|Kildare]] and [[County Meath|Meath]]. The [[Slieve Bloom Mountains]] are in the southern part of the county on the border with County Laois. Offaly has the [[List of Irish counties by highest point|24th highest county peak]] in Ireland. The highest point is [[Arderin]] ({{irish place name|Ard \u00c9ireann|}}) in the Slieve Blooms at {{convert|527|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The Slieve Bloom Mountains contain the county's highest points including [[Stillbrook Hill]] and [[Wolftrap Mountain]] which are the county's second and third highest peaks. [[Croghan Hill]] rises from the Bog of Allen and is located in northern Offaly. Although only 234 metres high, it is known for its view over the surrounding area and it stands out by itself.\n\nThe floodplain of the [[River Shannon]] is in the north-western part of the county. The [[River Camcor]] runs through the town of [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]] and is a Wild Trout Conservation Area. The [[River Brosna]] runs across the county from [[Lough Owel]] in Westmeath to [[Shannon Harbour]]. [[Silver River (Ireland)|Silver River]] runs through several towns in the south of the county before joining [[River Brosna|Brosna]] near the town of [[Ferbane]]. The [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal]] also runs across the county from Edenderry on the north-east to Shannon Harbour before joining the [[River Shannon|Shannon]]. The county contains many small lakes from [[Lough Boora]] to [[Pallas Lough|Pallas Lake]] and it also contains 42 hectares of swamp land. There are a number [[Esker]]s in the counties landscape including [[Esker Riada]].\n\nOffaly largely comprises a flat landscape and is known for its extensive bog and peatlands. There are many large bogs in Offaly including the [[Bog of Allen]], [[Clara bog]], [[Boora bog]] and [[Raheenmore Bog]] which are spread out across the county with the Bog of Allen extending into four other counties. The county consists of approximately 42,000 hectares of peatlands which is 21% of Offaly's total land area.\n\nOffaly contains approximately {{convert|9000|ha|acre|abbr=off}} of forest and woodland area, which only amounts to 4.5% of the county's land area. This includes woodlands within the Slieve Blooms and the Lough Boora Parklands. Roughly 75% of Offaly's forested area is [[Pinophyta|Conifer High Forest]].\n\n===Baronies===\n[[File:Baronies of Offaly.jpg|300px|thumb|Baronies of Offaly]]\nThe following are the historical baronies of County Offaly:\n*[[Ballyboy (barony)|Ballyboy]]\n*[[Ballybrit]]\n*[[Ballycowan (barony)|Ballycowan]]\n*[[Clonlisk]]\n*[[Coolestown]]\n*[[Eglish (barony)|Eglish]]\n*[[Garrycastle]]\n*[[Geashill (barony)|Geashill]]\n*[[Kilcoursey]]\n*[[Lower Philipstown]]\n*[[Upper Philipstown]]\n*[[Warrenstown]]\n\n=== Towns and villages ===\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Ballinagar]]\n* [[Ballyboy]]\n* [[Ballycumber]]\n* [[Banagher]]\n* [[Belmont, County Offaly|Belmont]]\n* [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]]\n* [[Bracknagh]]\n* [[Cadamstown]]\n* [[Clara, County Offaly|Clara]]\n* [[Clareen]]\n* [[Cloghan, County Offaly|Cloghan]]\n* [[Clonygowan]]\n* [[Clonbullogue]]\n* [[Clonmacnoise]]\n* [[Coolderry]]\n* [[Crinkill]]\n* [[Croghan (village), County Offaly|Croghan]]\n* [[Daingean]]\n* [[Dunkerrin]]\n* [[Edenderry]]\n* [[Ferbane]]\n* [[Geashill]]\n* [[Horseleap]]\n* [[Kilcormac]]\n* [[Killeigh]]\n* [[Killoughey]]\n* [[Kinnitty]]\n* [[Lusmagh]]\n* [[Moneygall]]\n* [[Mountbolus]]\n* [[Mucklagh]]\n* [[Pullough]]\n* [[Portarlington, County Laois|Portarlington]]\n* [[Rahan, County Offaly|Rahan]]\n* [[Rath, County Offaly|Rath]]\n* [[Rhode, County Offaly|Rhode]]\n* [[Shannonbridge]]\n* [[Shannon Harbour]]\n* [[Shinrone]]\n* [[Tullamore]]\n* [[Tubber, County Offaly|Tubber]]\n* [[Walsh Island]]\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Local government and politics==\n[[Offaly County Council]] is the [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] for the county.

It is today a significant tourist destination.\n\nThe county itself was formed following the [[Plantations of Ireland#Early Plantations (1556\u20131576)|Tudor plantations]] of Laois and Offaly in an attempt by the [[English Crown]] to expand its sphere of influence in Ireland which had declined following the [[Norman Conquest of Ireland]]. Both Laois (Leix) and Offaly (U\u00ed Failghe) were [[petty kingdom]]s in [[Gaelic Ireland]] located just outside the [[The Pale|Pale]] (a region around Dublin and the mid east of Ireland that remained loyal to the [[English Crown]] following the [[Norman Conquest]]). The older kingdoms of Leix and U\u00ed Failghe are not coterminous with the present day counties that were formed. The [[Kingdom of U\u00ed Failghe]] from which the name '''Offaly''' is derived, was ruled by the '''\u00d3 Conchobhair Failghe''' (anglicised as: O'Conor Faly) whose territory extended from the east of the county into north Kildare. The Kingdom of Firceall ruled by the '''O'Molloy''' clan constituted much of the centre of the county. The Kingdom of [[Firceall]] was part of the [[Kingdom of Meath]] while U\u00ed Failghe was part of the [[Kingdom of Leinster]]. Much of the south of the present day county (as well as northern [[County Tipperary]]) was ruled by '''\u00d3 Cearbhaill of [[\u00c9ile]]''' (anglicised as: O'Carroll Ely). Ely formed part of the [[Kingdom of Munster]].  These [[petty kingdom]]s were swept aside by the [[Plantations of Ireland#Early Plantations (1556\u20131576)|Tudor plantations]]. In 1556, an Act of the [[Parliament of Ireland]] created \"King's County\", named after [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]], the then [[king of Ireland]].<ref>3 & 4 Phil & Mar, c.2 (1556)</ref> This replaced the old Kingdoms with [[Baronies of Ireland|Baronies]] and the present day County System.\n\nDespite the county's name being upheld as Offaly through the 2001 Local Government Act, no legislation was ever enacted after independence explicitly changing the name from King's County, the name formally established under the 1898 Local Government Act which continued to have legal effect. Legal transfers and assignments of [[Real property|land]] in the county still refer to it as \"King's County\".\n\n==Places of interest==\n[[File:Birr Castle, Offaly.jpg|right|thumb|[[Birr Castle]]]]\n[[File:Sunrise- 60 Degrees, Sky Train, December 28,2008 lo res.jpg|thumb|[[Sculpture in the Parklands|Sculpture Park]] at [[Boora Bog|Lough Boora]]]]\n* [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]] in the south of the county is best known for its castle and gardens.

The population of [[Portarlington, County Laois|Portarlington]] increased by 50.1% between 2002 and 2006.<ref name=\"DC\"/>\n\nThe population as of census 2016 was 77,961 people with 34.7% (27,085 people) under the age of 25 and 13.6% (10,951 people) over the age of 65.<ref name=cso2016/>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Bord na Mona - \"The Bog Train\" - At Edenderry, Co. Offaly, Ireland (14225837858).jpg|thumb|Commercial [[peat]] extraction was traditionally the largest industry in the county]]\nTraditionally, agriculture and industry have been the main driving force of the economy in the county. Offaly has extensive bogland, particularly in the northern parts of the county, that forms part of the [[Bog of Allen]]. [[Bord na M\u00f3na]] was founded in 1946 and provided employment to hundreds of people in Offaly by making peat briquettes (for home domestic use) and supplying peat to power stations operated by [[ESB Group|ESB]]. Peat briquettes are currently made at the Bord na M\u00f3na factory at Derrinlough near Birr. Power stations are operating at [[Shannonbridge]] and Edenderry. With the continuing depletion of the bogs a number of power stations have closed down in recent years. The ESB power station at Lumcloon, [[Ferbane]] was a major employer in the midlands but closed in 2001. [[Rhode, County Offaly|Rhode]] power station closed down soon afterwards. These were major landmarks in Offaly with large [[cooling tower]]s that were visible for miles around Offaly and beyond, but were demolished soon after the stations closed. Many bogs are now used as wildlife reserves or for tourism activities such as Lough Boora.\n\nThe opening of the [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal]] in the 18th century brought prosperity to towns such as [[Banagher]] and [[Tullamore]]. Both towns were important stops on the [[Dublin]] to [[Limerick]] navigation which supported a number of industries and brought cheap and efficient water transport to the county in that era.\n\nThe [[Celtic Tiger]] also brought an increase in economic activity to Offaly with business enterprise and industrial parks opening in Birr, Edenderry and [[Tullamore]]. Many people particularly in the east of the county are within an easy commuting distance to [[Dublin]] where many find employment.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n===Transport===\n====Rail====\n[[File:Clara Station - geograph.org.uk - 2236128.jpg|thumb|right|[[Clara railway station]]]]\nOffaly is well served by rail transport. Railway stations are located at [[Tullamore railway station|Tullamore]] and [[Clara railway station|Clara]]. Both stations are on the main [[Dublin-Westport/Galway railway line]] with regular trains serving the area especially for [[Dublin]] commuters. [[Portarlington railway station]] is located just over the [[County Laois]] border and is in a catchment area for the south east of the county. Portarlington railway station is on the main [[Dublin-Cork railway line]] with regular commuter services to [[Heuston Station]], Dublin and intercity services to [[Cork (city)|Cork]], [[Limerick]], [[Killarney]] & [[Tralee]].\n\nThe [[Limerick-Ballybrophy railway line]] travels through the south of the county however there are no railway stations on the line in County Offaly. The nearest stations are located at [[Cloughjordan railway station|Cloughjordan]] and [[Roscrea railway station|Roscrea]] both just outside the county boundary. A railway line from Birr connected to the line at Roscrea until it was closed in the 1960s. A controversial railway line also connected Birr to [[Portumna]] between 1868 and 1878, and became something of a folk legend.\n\n====Road====\n[[File:OffalyRoadMap.png|thumb|right|Road network of Offaly]]\nThree main national secondary routes pass through the county. The [[N52 road (Ireland)|N52 road]] passes from [[Kilbeggan]] to Tullamore and Birr which then continues to [[Nenagh]] where it intersects with the [[M7 motorway (Ireland)|M7]]. The [[N62 road (Ireland)|N62]] from [[Athlone]] passes through [[Ferbane]] and Birr and continues onto [[Roscrea]] and [[Thurles]]. The [[N80 road (Ireland)|N80]] route starts in Tullamore and continues to the south east passing through [[Portlaoise]] and [[Carlow]]. There are no main national primary routes in the county, however, the [[M6 motorway (Ireland)|M6]] skirts the county to the north and the [[M7 motorway (Ireland)|M7]] skirts the county to the south through [[Moneygall]]. Road infrastructure has improved with the completion of the Tullamore bypass in 2009 and improved access to regional cities following completion of the intercity motorway network.\n\n====Bus====\n[[Bus \u00c9ireann]] provide public transport services throughout the county with regular bus services to [[Limerick]] and [[Waterford]] from Athlone bus station. Other private bus coach services provide direct bus services from Birr to [[Dublin]] such as Kearns bus service who run several services daily. Slieve Bloom Coaches run services from Tullamore and Portarlington to Dublin.\n[[File:Ballycommon Radio Mast Offaly.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Radio transmitter in [[Ballycommon]]]]\n====Waterway====\nThe [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal]] connecting Dublin to the river Shannon was constructed through the towns of Edenderry and Tullamore and joins the Shannon at [[Shannon Harbour]]. Traditionally this was an important route for transport, communication and trade between Dublin, Limerick and the midlands of Ireland. The route fell into decline as road transport became more popular. Much of the route is now used for [[boating]] and leisure activities.\n\n===Media===\n====Radio====\n[[Midlands 103]] (originally Midlands Radio 3) which broadcasts to Laois, Offaly and Westmeath is based in Tullamore and has studios across the midlands. \nRT\u00c9's [[medium wave transmitter]] broadcasting [[RT\u00c9 Radio 1]] was also located in Tullamore but transmission stopped in 2008.\n\n====Print====\nA number of local newspapers are published in Offaly. The [[Offaly Independent]] and Tullamore Tribune are based in Tullamore. The Midland Tribune based in Birr covers local news in the west and south of the county as well as parts of northern Tipperary including the towns of Birr, [[Roscrea]] and [[Nenagh]] and surrounding areas. The [[Offaly Express]] was a former newspaper based in Tullamore. It closed down in July 2012 after 29 years in operation. It is now an on line news platform for the county at www.offalyexpress.ie [http://www.offalyexpress.ie]\n\n==Sport==\n===GAA===\n[[File:Seir Kieran, Offaly JHC champions 1937 and IHC champions 1938.png|thumb|right|[[Seir Kieran GAA]] [[hurling|hurlers]], 1938]]\n[[Gaelic games]] are popular in the county. [[Offaly GAA]] consists of some 44 clubs playing [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]] in communities throughout the county. [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]] is generally considered a hurling stronghold with [[Birr GAA]] winning four [[All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship]]s. County teams have also had national success in both hurling and football, winning the [[Liam MacCarthy Cup]] four times and the [[Sam Maguire Cup]] three times. The football team is perhaps best known for the [[Seamus Darby]] goal in the \ndying minutes of the [[1982 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|1982 football final]] when Offaly took the title by one point denying [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] an historic five All-Ireland titles in a row. \nTraditionally, west Offaly has been the hurling stronghold with clubs like [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]], [[Coolderry]], And [[Kilcormac/Killoughey]] enjoying success in the [[Leinster]] and All-Ireland Championships\n\nFamous hurlers from Offaly include:\n*Brian Whelahan, [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]]\n*The Dooley Brothers, [[Clareen]]\n*Brian Carroll, [[Coolderry]]\n*Rory Hanniffy, [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]]\n*Shane Dooley, [[Tullamore]]\n*Michael Duignan, [[Banagher]]\n[[File:Shane Lowry 8107.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[2019 Open Championship]] winner [[Shane Lowry (golfer)|Shane Lowry]]]]\nFamous Footballers from Offaly include:\n*Matt Conor, [[Walsh Island]]\n*Richie Conor, [[Walsh Island]]\n*Ciar\u00e1n McManus, [[Tubber, County Offaly|Tubber]]\n*Niall McNamee, [[Rhode, County Offaly|Rhode]]\n*Martin Furlong, [[Tullamore]]\n*Seamus Darby, [[Rhode, County Offaly|Rhode]]\n*Mick Brady, [[Edenderry]]\n*Finbarr Cullen, [[Edenderry]]\n\n===Association football===\n[[Tullamore Town F.C.]] play at [[Leah Victoria Park]].

Birr Golf Club and Esker Hills Golf Club near Tullamore are popular. Irish golfer [[Shane Lowry (golfer)|Shane Lowry]] is a member of Esker Hills. He is from the town of Clara outside Tullamore.  As an amateur, he won the 2009 Irish Open. In 2019, Lowry won The Open Championship in Royal Portrush Golf Club, becoming the first Offaly man to win one of the golfing majors.\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Tullamore_DEW_and_Rocks_Tumbler.jpg|thumb|190px|right|[[Tullamore Dew]], the second best-selling global brand of [[Irish whiskey]]]]\n===People===\n*[[George Brent]], Hollywood actor\n*[[Ged Corcoran]], Irish [[rugby league]] footballer\n*[[Brian Cowen]], former [[Taoiseach]], born in Clara, 10 January 1960 and now living on the outskirts of Tullamore\n*[[Neil Delamere]], comedian\n*[[Barry Glendenning]], journalist\n*[[Rex Ingram (director)|Rex Ingram]], Hollywood [[silent film]] director, born in [[Dublin]] but lived in [[Kinnitty]]\n*[[John Joly]], scientist, born at [[Bracknagh]] in 1857\n*[[Shane Lowry (golfer)|Shane Lowry]], golfer\n*[[Mundy]], musician\n*[[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|William Parsons]], 3rd [[Earl of Rosse]], astronomer; also the father of [[Charles Algernon Parsons]] who invented the [[steam turbine]]. \n*[[George Johnstone Stoney]] (1826 - 1911) Physicist.

He was cousin to Sir [[Richard Grenville (sea captain)|Richard Grenville]] and younger half-brother of Sir [[Humphrey Gilbert]]. He is also well known for popularising [[tobacco]] in England. Raleigh was one of the most notable figures of the [[Elizabethan era]].\n\nRaleigh was born to a [[Protestant]] family in [[Devon]], the son of Walter Raleigh and Catherine Champernowne. Little is known of his early life, though in his late teens he spent some time in [[France]] taking part in the religious civil wars. In his 20s he took part in the suppression of rebellion in [[Ireland]] participating in the [[Siege of Smerwick]]. Later, he became a landlord of property confiscated from the native Irish. He rose rapidly in the favour of [[Queen Elizabeth I]] and was knighted in 1585. Raleigh was instrumental in the English colonisation of North America and was granted a [[royal patent]] to explore [[Virginia]], paving the way for future English settlements. In 1591, he secretly married [[Elizabeth Throckmorton]], one of the Queen's [[Lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]], without the Queen's permission, for which he and his wife were sent to the [[Tower of London]]. After his release, they retired to his estate at [[Sherborne]], [[Dorset]].\n\nIn 1594, Raleigh heard of a \"City of Gold\" in [[South America]] and sailed to find it, publishing an exaggerated account of his experiences in a book that contributed to the legend of \"[[El Dorado]]\". After Queen Elizabeth died in 1603, Raleigh was again imprisoned in the Tower, this time for being involved in the [[Main Plot]] against [[King James I]], who was not favourably disposed towards him. In 1616, he was released to lead a second expedition in search of El Dorado. During the expedition, men led by his top commander ransacked a Spanish outpost, in violation of both the terms of his pardon and the [[Treaty of London (1604)|1604 peace treaty with Spain]]. Raleigh returned to England and, to appease the Spanish, he was arrested and executed in 1618.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Millais Boyhood of Raleigh.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Boyhood of Raleigh]]'' by [[John Everett Millais]], 1871]]\nLittle is known about Sir Walter Raleigh's birth<ref name=b724>''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature''.

Walter Raleigh junior's immediate family included his full brother [[Carew Raleigh]], and half-brothers John Gilbert, [[Humphrey Gilbert]] and Adrian Gilbert. As a consequence of their kinship with the Champernowne family, all of the Raleigh and Gilbert brothers became prominent during the reigns of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and [[James VI and I|James I]]. \n\nRaleigh's family was highly [[Protestant]] in religious orientation and had a number of near escapes during the reign of [[Roman Catholic]] Queen [[Mary I of England]]. In the most notable of these, his father had to hide in a tower to avoid execution. As a result, Raleigh developed a hatred of Roman Catholicism during his childhood, and proved himself quick to express it after Protestant Queen Elizabeth I came to the throne in 1558. In matters of religion, Elizabeth was more moderate than her half sister Mary.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bremer|first1=Francis J.|last2=Webster|first2=Tom|title=Puritans and Puritanism in Europe and America|volume=1|year=2006|publisher=ABC-CLIO Inc|location=Santa Barbara, California|page=454}}</ref>\n\nIn 1569, Raleigh left for France to serve with the [[Huguenot]]s in the French religious civil wars.<ref name=b724/> In 1572, Raleigh was registered as an undergraduate at [[Oriel College, Oxford]], but he left a year later without a degree.

This made him one of the principal landowners in [[Munster]], but he had limited success inducing English tenants to settle on his [[Plantations of Ireland|estates]].\n\nRaleigh made the town of Youghal his occasional home during his 17 years as an Irish landlord, frequently being domiciled at [[Killua Castle]], [[Clonmellon]], [[County Westmeath]]. He was mayor there from 1588 to 1589. His town mansion of [[Myrtle Grove, Youghal|Myrtle Grove]] is assumed to be the setting for the story that his servant doused him with a bucket of water after seeing clouds of smoke coming from Raleigh's pipe, in the belief that he had been set alight. But this story is also told of other places associated with Raleigh: the Virginia Ash Inn in [[Henstridge]] near [[Sherborne]], [[Sherborne Castle]], and [[South Wraxall Manor]] in [[Wiltshire]], home of Raleigh's friend [[Sir Walter Long (1565\u20131610)|Sir Walter Long]].\n\nAmongst Raleigh's acquaintances in Munster was another Englishman who had been granted land there, poet [[Edmund Spenser]]. In the 1590s, he and Raleigh travelled together from Ireland to the court at London, where Spenser presented part of his allegorical poem ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' to Elizabeth I.\n\nRaleigh's management of his Irish estates ran into difficulties which contributed to a decline in his fortunes. In 1602, he sold the lands to [[Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork]], who subsequently prospered under kings [[James VI and I|James I]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].<ref name=\"National Biography page 133\">''Concise Dictionary of National Biography'', founded 1882 by George Smith, part 1 \u2013 to 1900. p. 133</ref> Following Raleigh's death, members of his family approached Boyle for compensation on the ground that Raleigh had struck an improvident bargain.\n\n==New World==\n[[File:Raleigh-Walter-Sir-LOC.jpg|thumb|Engraved portrait of Raleigh]]\nIn 1584, Queen Elizabeth granted Raleigh a royal charter authorising him to explore, colonise and rule any \"remote, heathen and barbarous lands, countries and territories, not actually possessed of any Christian Prince or inhabited by Christian People,\" in return for one-fifth of all the gold and silver that might be mined there.<ref>{{cite web|title=Charter to Sir Walter Raleigh: 1584|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/16th_century/raleigh.asp|website=The Avalon Project|publisher=Yale Law School, Lillian Goldman Law Library|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>  This charter specified that Raleigh had seven years in which to establish a settlement, or else lose his right to do so.

Raleigh himself never visited North America, although he led expeditions in 1595 and 1617 to the [[Orinoco River]] basin in [[South America]] in search of the golden city of [[El Dorado]].

He was buried at West Horsley. He left three surviving children \u2013 Elizabeth, Philippa and Anne. Philippa (who married Oliver Weekes, of Tortingdon, Sussex) and Anne (who married William Knight, of Barrells, Warwickshire) left descendants. It was Philippa Weekes\u2019 daughter, Elizabeth Elwes, who seems to have owned the main store of Raleigh memorabilia and was consulted by William Oldys in 1735 when he was writing his ''Life of Raleigh''. \n\nAnne Raleigh married Sir Peter Tyrrell, of Castlethorpe, Bucks. Her granddaughter, Harriet, married Francis Mann, of Kidlington, Oxfordshire, and died in 1785, leaving descendants.\n\nPhilip Raleigh championed his grandfather's cause, publishing several of his hitherto unpublished papers. He had a family of four sons and three daughters. The youngest son, Carew Raleigh, page of honour to William III, was serving as a captain's servant on H.M.S. Bredah when he died of fever in the West Indies in 1697, aged seventeen. The second son, Lieut. Brudenell Raleigh, was also serving in the navy in the West Indies when he died of fever in June 1698, aged 22. The eldest son, Capt. Walter Raleigh, Grenadier Guards, was page of honour to Queen Mary, and was killed at the siege of Schellenberg in 1704, aged 31. He was unmarried. After Walter's death, his father was granted a pension by the crown, \u2018in consideration of his 3 sons being slain in the late and present war\u2019. The third son, Captain-Lieutenant Grenville Raleigh, served in Marlborough's army throughout the War of the Spanish Succession and died of fever in 1717, while guarding the prisoners at Chester after the 1715 Jacobite rising. He had married and had two sons and a daughter, Mary. On the death of his daughter in Bath in 1783, it was noted that she was \u2018the only surviving descendant in the direct line of Sir Walter Raleigh\u2019. \n\nOf Philip Raleigh's daughters,  Anne and Elizabeth both died unmarried. The eldest daughter, Frances, married William Honywood, eldest son of Sir William Honywood, of Evington Place, Elmsted, Kent and died in 1730. Her many descendants include the present Lord Mountbatten of Burma and Hugh Grant, the actor.   \n\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of colonial governors of Virginia]]\n* [[Sir Walter]], a race horse\n* [[The Armada Service]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* Adamson, J.H. and Folland, H.

He was cousin to Sir [[Richard Grenville (sea captain)|Richard Grenville]] and younger half-brother of Sir [[Humphrey Gilbert]]. He is also well known for popularising [[tobacco]] in England. Raleigh was one of the most notable figures of the [[Elizabethan era]].\n\nRaleigh was born to a [[Protestant]] family in [[Devon]], the son of Walter Raleigh and Catherine Champernowne. Little is known of his early life, though in his late teens he spent some time in [[France]] taking part in the religious civil wars. In his 20s he took part in the suppression of rebellion in [[Ireland]] participating in the [[Siege of Smerwick]]. Later, he became a landlord of property confiscated from the native Irish. He rose rapidly in the favour of [[Queen Elizabeth I]] and was knighted in 1585. Raleigh was instrumental in the English colonisation of North America and was granted a [[royal patent]] to explore [[Virginia]], paving the way for future English settlements. In 1591, he secretly married [[Elizabeth Throckmorton]], one of the Queen's [[Lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]], without the Queen's permission, for which he and his wife were sent to the [[Tower of London]]. After his release, they retired to his estate at [[Sherborne]], [[Dorset]].\n\nIn 1594, Raleigh heard of a \"City of Gold\" in [[South America]] and sailed to find it, publishing an exaggerated account of his experiences in a book that contributed to the legend of \"[[El Dorado]]\". After Queen Elizabeth died in 1603, Raleigh was again imprisoned in the Tower, this time for being involved in the [[Main Plot]] against [[King James I]], who was not favourably disposed towards him. In 1616, he was released to lead a second expedition in search of El Dorado. During the expedition, men led by his top commander ransacked a Spanish outpost, in violation of both the terms of his pardon and the [[Treaty of London (1604)|1604 peace treaty with Spain]]. Raleigh returned to England and, to appease the Spanish, he was arrested and executed in 1618.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Millais Boyhood of Raleigh.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Boyhood of Raleigh]]'' by [[John Everett Millais]], 1871]]\nLittle is known about Sir Walter Raleigh's birth<ref name=b724>''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature''.

Walter Raleigh junior's immediate family included his full brother [[Carew Raleigh]], and half-brothers John Gilbert, [[Humphrey Gilbert]] and Adrian Gilbert. As a consequence of their kinship with the Champernowne family, all of the Raleigh and Gilbert brothers became prominent during the reigns of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and [[James VI and I|James I]]. \n\nRaleigh's family was highly [[Protestant]] in religious orientation and had a number of near escapes during the reign of [[Roman Catholic]] Queen [[Mary I of England]]. In the most notable of these, his father had to hide in a tower to avoid execution. As a result, Raleigh developed a hatred of Roman Catholicism during his childhood, and proved himself quick to express it after Protestant Queen Elizabeth I came to the throne in 1558. In matters of religion, Elizabeth was more moderate than her half sister Mary.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bremer|first1=Francis J.|last2=Webster|first2=Tom|title=Puritans and Puritanism in Europe and America|volume=1|year=2006|publisher=ABC-CLIO Inc|location=Santa Barbara, California|page=454}}</ref>\n\nIn 1569, Raleigh left for France to serve with the [[Huguenot]]s in the French religious civil wars.<ref name=b724/> In 1572, Raleigh was registered as an undergraduate at [[Oriel College, Oxford]], but he left a year later without a degree.

This made him one of the principal landowners in [[Munster]], but he had limited success inducing English tenants to settle on his [[Plantations of Ireland|estates]].\n\nRaleigh made the town of Youghal his occasional home during his 17 years as an Irish landlord, frequently being domiciled at [[Killua Castle]], [[Clonmellon]], [[County Westmeath]]. He was mayor there from 1588 to 1589. His town mansion of [[Myrtle Grove, Youghal|Myrtle Grove]] is assumed to be the setting for the story that his servant doused him with a bucket of water after seeing clouds of smoke coming from Raleigh's pipe, in the belief that he had been set alight. But this story is also told of other places associated with Raleigh: the Virginia Ash Inn in [[Henstridge]] near [[Sherborne]], [[Sherborne Castle]], and [[South Wraxall Manor]] in [[Wiltshire]], home of Raleigh's friend [[Sir Walter Long (1565\u20131610)|Sir Walter Long]].\n\nAmongst Raleigh's acquaintances in Munster was another Englishman who had been granted land there, poet [[Edmund Spenser]]. In the 1590s, he and Raleigh travelled together from Ireland to the court at London, where Spenser presented part of his allegorical poem ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' to Elizabeth I.\n\nRaleigh's management of his Irish estates ran into difficulties which contributed to a decline in his fortunes. In 1602, he sold the lands to [[Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork]], who subsequently prospered under kings [[James VI and I|James I]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].<ref name=\"National Biography page 133\">''Concise Dictionary of National Biography'', founded 1882 by George Smith, part 1 \u2013 to 1900. p. 133</ref> Following Raleigh's death, members of his family approached Boyle for compensation on the ground that Raleigh had struck an improvident bargain.\n\n==New World==\n[[File:Raleigh-Walter-Sir-LOC.jpg|thumb|Engraved portrait of Raleigh]]\nIn 1584, Queen Elizabeth granted Raleigh a royal charter authorising him to explore, colonise and rule any \"remote, heathen and barbarous lands, countries and territories, not actually possessed of any Christian Prince or inhabited by Christian People,\" in return for one-fifth of all the gold and silver that might be mined there.<ref>{{cite web|title=Charter to Sir Walter Raleigh: 1584|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/16th_century/raleigh.asp|website=The Avalon Project|publisher=Yale Law School, Lillian Goldman Law Library|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>  This charter specified that Raleigh had seven years in which to establish a settlement, or else lose his right to do so. Raleigh and Elizabeth intended that the venture should provide riches from the New World and a base from which to send [[privateer]]s on raids against the treasure fleets of [[Spain]]. Raleigh himself never visited North America, although he led expeditions in 1595 and 1617 to the [[Orinoco River]] basin in [[South America]] in search of the golden city of [[El Dorado]]. Instead, he sent others in 1585 to found the [[Roanoke Colony]], later known as the \"[[Lost Colony]]\".<ref>David B.

She gave birth to a son, believed to be named Damerei, who was given to a [[wet nurse]] at Durham House, but he died in October 1592 of plague. Bess resumed her duties to the queen. The following year, the unauthorised marriage was discovered and the Queen ordered Raleigh to be imprisoned and Bess dismissed from court. Both were imprisoned in the Tower of London in June 1592. He was released from prison in August 1592 to manage a recently returned expedition and attack on the Spanish coast.

[[C. S. Lewis]] considered Raleigh one of the era's \"silver poets\", a group of writers who resisted the [[Italian Renaissance]] influence of dense classical reference and elaborate poetic devices. His writing contains strong personal treatments of themes such as love, loss, beauty, and time. Most of his poems are short lyrics that were inspired by actual events.<ref name=b724/>\n\nIn poems such as ''What is Our Life'' and ''[[The Lie (poem)|The Lie]]'', Raleigh expresses a ''[[contemptus mundi]]'' (contempt of the world) attitude more characteristic of [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]] than of the dawning era of humanistic optimism.

He was buried at West Horsley. He left three surviving children \u2013 Elizabeth, Philippa and Anne. Philippa (who married Oliver Weekes, of Tortingdon, Sussex) and Anne (who married William Knight, of Barrells, Warwickshire) left descendants. It was Philippa Weekes\u2019 daughter, Elizabeth Elwes, who seems to have owned the main store of Raleigh memorabilia and was consulted by William Oldys in 1735 when he was writing his ''Life of Raleigh''. \n\nAnne Raleigh married Sir Peter Tyrrell, of Castlethorpe, Bucks. Her granddaughter, Harriet, married Francis Mann, of Kidlington, Oxfordshire, and died in 1785, leaving descendants.\n\nPhilip Raleigh championed his grandfather\u2019s cause, publishing several of his hitherto unpublished papers. He had a family of four sons and three daughters. The youngest son, Carew Raleigh, page of honour to William III, was serving as a captain\u2019s servant on H.M.S. Bredah when he died of fever in the West Indies in 1697, aged seventeen. The second son, Lieut. Brudenell Raleigh, was also serving in the navy in the West Indies when he died of fever in June 1698, aged 22. The eldest son, Capt. Walter Raleigh, Grenadier Guards, was page of honour to Queen Mary, and was killed at the siege of Schellenberg in 1704, aged 31. He was unmarried. After Walter\u2019s death, his father was granted a pension by the crown, \u2018in consideration of his 3 sons being slain in the late and present war\u2019. The third son, Captain-Lieutenant Grenville Raleigh, served in Marlborough\u2019s army throughout the War of the Spanish Succession and died of fever in 1717, while guarding the prisoners at Chester after the 1715 Jacobite rising. He had married and had two sons and a daughter, Mary. On the death of his daughter in Bath in 1783, it was noted that she was \u2018the only surviving descendant in the direct line of Sir Walter Raleigh\u2019. \n\nOf Philip Raleigh\u2019s daughters,  Anne and Elizabeth both died unmarried. The eldest daughter, Frances, married William Honywood, eldest son of Sir William Honywood, of Evington Place, Elmsted, Kent and died in 1730. Her many descendants include the present Lord Mountbatten of Burma and Hugh Grant, the actor.   \n\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of colonial governors of Virginia]]\n* [[Sir Walter]], a race horse\n* [[The Armada Service]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* Adamson, J.H. and Folland, H.
