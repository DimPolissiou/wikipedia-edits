Hair can become more visible during and after [[puberty]] and men tend to have thicker, more visible body hair than women.<ref name=\"Shellow\">Shellow, Victoria (2006) ''Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History'', Greenwood Publishing Group. p.67. ({{ISBN|0-313-33145-6}})</ref>\nBoth men and women have visible hair on the [[Hair|head]], [[eyebrow]]s, [[eyelash]]es, [[Armpit hair|armpits]], [[pubic hair|pubic region]], [[arm]]s, and [[Leg shaving|legs]]; men and some women also have thicker hair on their [[Facial hair|face]], [[Abdominal hair|abdomen]], [[Human back|back]] and [[Chest hair|chest]]. Hair does not generally grow on the [[lips]], the underside of the [[hand]]s or [[foot|feet]] or on certain areas of the [[genitalia]].\n\nHair removal may be practised for cultural, [[aesthetic]], [[hygiene]], sexual, medical or religious reasons. Forms of hair removal have been practised in almost all human cultures since at least the [[Neolithic]] era. The methods used to remove hair have varied in different times and regions, but [[shaving]] is the most common method.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n== History ==\nIn early history, hair was removed for cleanliness and fashion reasons. If the hair was cut and shaven it meant one was high class. In [[Ancient Egypt]], besides being a fashion statement hair removal also served as a treatment for [[Louse|louse infestation]], which was a prevalent issue in the region.{{citation needed |date=December 2019 |reason=contradicts research claiming long hair demonstrated power, example https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/18730/ \"long hair was predominant among women of all social statuses in all periods\"}} Commonly, they would replace the removed hair with wigs, which were seen as easier to maintain and also fashionable. They would remove their hair using two methods: [[waxing]] and [[shaving]]. If they chose to wax they would use caramelized sugar, and if they wanted to shave, they would use an early form of the [[straight razor]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=given illumin cite is insufficient to verify - it itself cites a now dead touregypt webpage.}}<ref name=\"illumin.usc.edu\">{{cite web |first=Amber |last=Bhargava |date=November 26, 2012 |url=http://illumin.usc.edu/277/beauty-and-the-geek-the-engineering-behind-laser-hair-removal/ |title=Beauty and the Geek: The Engineering Behind Laser Hair Removal |publisher=Illumin }}{{self-published source|date=October 2017}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=October 2017}}\n\nAs time went on new techniques were found to remove hair such as [[Laser hair removal]].\n\n== Cultural and sexual aspects ==\n{{See also|Bikini waxing|History of removal of leg and underarm hair in the United States}}\n[[File:Mujer afeitando sus piernas.jpg|thumb|[[Leg shaving]] by a female using a women's [[razor]].]]\n\nEach [[culture]] of human [[society]] developed [[social norms]] relating to the presence or absence of body hair, which has changed from one time to another. Different standards can apply to females and males. People whose hair falls outside a culture's aesthetic standards may experience real or perceived social acceptance problems. For example, for women in several societies, exposure in public of body hair other than head hair, eyelashes and eyebrows is generally considered to be [[aesthetic|unaesthetic]], unattractive and [[Embarrassment|embarrassing]].<ref name=Embod1>Heinz Tschachler, Maureen Devine, Michael Draxlbauer; ''The EmBodyment of American Culture''; pp 61\u201362; LIT Verlag, Berlin-Hamburg-M\u00fcnster; 2003; {{ISBN|3-8258-6762-5}}.</ref> In Middle Eastern societies, removal of the female body hair has been considered proper [[hygiene]], necessitated by local customs, for many centuries.<ref>Kutty, Ahmad (September 13, 2005) [http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&cid=1126012472670 \"Islamic Ruling on Waxing Unwanted Hair\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213192038/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&cid=1126012472670 |date=2008-02-13 }} Retrieved March 29, 2006</ref><ref>Irvin Cemil Schick, \"Some Islamic Determinants of Dress and Personal Appearance in Southwest Asia,\" ''Khil\u2019a'' 3 (2007\u20132009 [2011]), 25\u201353.</ref>\n\nWith the increased popularity in many countries of women wearing shorter dresses and swimsuits during the 20th century and the consequential exposure of parts of the body on which hair is commonly found, there has been an increase in the practice of women removing unwanted body hair, such as on legs, underarms and elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_012.html |title=Who decided women should shave their legs and underarms? |publisher=The Straight Dope |date=1991-02-06 |accessdate=2018-08-27}}</ref>  In the United States, for example, the vast majority of women regularly shave their legs and armpits, while roughly half also shave their bikini lines.\n\nMany men in Western cultures shave their facial hair, so only a minority of men have a [[beard]], even though fast-growing facial hair must be shaved daily to achieve a [[clean-shaven]] or hairless look. Some men shave because they cannot grow a \"full\" beard (generally defined as an even density from cheeks to neck) because their beard color is different from their scalp hair color, or because their facial hair grows in many directions, making a [[Personal grooming|groomed]] look difficult. Some men shave because their beards are very coarse, causing itchiness and irritation. Some men grow a beard or [[moustache]] from time to time to change their appearance.\n\nSome men [[head shaving|shave their heads]], either as a fashion statement, because they find a shaved head preferable to the appearance of [[male pattern baldness]], or in order to attain enhanced cooling of the skull \u2013 particularly for people suffering from [[hyperhidrosis]]. A much smaller number of Western women also shave their heads, often as a fashion or political statement.\n\nSome women also shave their heads for cultural or social reasons. In India, tradition required widows in some sections of the society to shave their heads as part of being [[ostracize]]d (see {{slink|Women in Hinduism|Widowhood and remarriage}}). The outlawed custom is still infrequently encountered mostly in rural areas. The society at large and the government are working to end the practice of ostracizing widows.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/07/05/damon.india.widows/index.html Shunned from society, widows flock to city to die], 2007-07-05, [http://www.cnn.com/ CNN.com], Retrieved 2007-07-05</ref> In addition, it continues to be common practice for men to shave their heads prior to embarking on a pilgrimage.\n\nPeople may also remove some or all of their [[pubic hair]] for [[bikini waxing|aesthetic or sexual reasons]]. This custom can be motivated by reasons of potentially increased cleanliness and hygiene, heightened enjoyment during [[sexual activity]], the desire to take on a more youthful appearance, and/or to boost self-confidence. Moreover, unwanted hair is often removed in preparatory situations by both sexes, in order to avoid socially awkward situations. For example, unwanted hair is removed in preparation for a sexual encounter or before visiting the beach.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThough traditionally in Western culture women remove body hair and men do not, some women choose not to remove hair from their bodies, either as a preference or as an act of defiance against what they regard to be an oppressive ritual, while some men remove or trim their body hair, a practice that is referred to as being a part of \"manscaping\" (a [[portmanteau word|portmanteau expression]] for [[Male grooming|male-specific grooming]]).\n\n===Fashions===\n\nThe term ''glabrousness'' also has been applied to human fashions,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} wherein some participate in culturally motivated hair removal by depilation (surface removal by [[shaving]], [[chemical depilatory|dissolving]]), or [[wiktionary:epilation|epilation]] (removal of the entire hair, such as [[waxing]] or [[plucking (hair removal)|plucking]]).\n\nAlthough the appearance of secondary hair on parts of the human body commonly occurs during [[puberty]], and therefore, is often seen as a symbol of adulthood, removal of this and other hair may become fashionable in some cultures and subcultures. In many modern [[Western culture]]s, men currently are encouraged to shave their beards, and women are encouraged to remove hair growth in various areas. Commonly depilated areas for women are the underarms, legs, and [[Pubic hair]]. Some individuals depilate the forearms. In recent years, bodily depilation in men has increased in popularity among some subcultures of Western males.\n\nAs with any cosmetic practice, the particulars of hair removal have changed over the years. Western female depilation has been significantly influenced by the evolution of clothing in the past century. Leg and underarm shaving became popular again{{when|date=January 2013}} in some parts of Western society with the advent of off-the-shoulder dresses, higher hemlines, and transparent stockings. The reduction of the minimum acceptable standards for bodily coverage over recent years has resulted in the exposure of more flesh, giving rise to more extensive hair removal in some cultures.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nEncouragement by commercial interests may be seen in advertising. At present, this has resulted in the \"[[Brazilian waxing]]\" trend involving the partial or full removal of pubic hair, as the [[G-string|thongs]] worn on Brazilian beaches are too small to conceal very much of it.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Indeed, a culture is now emerging around \"intimate shaving\" and other hair removal options geared specifically toward pubic hair. (''cf.'' [[bikini waxing]]) What was once kept a personal secret now is discussed more openly, although still in carefully non-explicit language, as advertised in magazines and on television.{{original research inline|date=March 2012}}\n\nFor men, the practice of depilating the pubic area is commonly referred to as manscaping, even though technically this term is applicable to hair removal all over the body. Many men will try this at some point in their lives, especially for aesthetic reasons. Most men will use a razor to shave this area, however, as best practice, it is recommended to use a body trimmer to shorten the length of the hair before shaving it off completely.\n\n===Cultural and other influences===\nIn ancient Egypt, depilation was commonly practiced, with [[pumice]] and [[razor]]s used to shave.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Boroughs|first1=Michael|last2=Cafri|first2=Guy|last3=Thompson|first3=J.

It is represented in some artistic depictions of male and female nudity, {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} examples of which may be seen in [[red figure pottery]] and sculptures like the [[Kouros]] of Ancient Greece in which both men and women were depicted without body or pubic hair. Emperor [[Augustus]] was said, by Suetonius, to have applied \"hot nutshells\" on his legs as a form of depilation.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Twelve Caesars, Aug. 68.}}</ref>\n\nThe majority of Muslims believe that adult removal of pubic and [[axillary hair]], as a hygienic measure, is [[religion|religiously]] beneficial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.understanding-islam.com/shaving-pubic-hair/ |title=Shaving Pubic Hair |work=Understanding Islam |date=10 February 1999}}</ref>\n\nBaptized [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] are specifically instructed never to cut, shave, or otherwise remove any hair on their bodies; this is a major tenet of the Sikh faith (''see [[Kesh (Sikhism)|Kesh]]'').\n\nIn the [[clothes free movement]], the term \"smoothie\" refers to an individual who has removed most of their hair. In the past, such practices were frowned upon and in some cases, members of clothes-free clubs were forbidden to remove their pubic hair: violators could face exclusion from the club. Enthusiasts grouped together and formed societies of their own that catered to that fashion and the fashion became more popular, with smoothies becoming a major percentage at some nudist venues.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euronaturist.com/smooth.htm |publisher=Euro Naturist |title=smooth naturists & nudists - Smoothies |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050508073900/http://www.euronaturist.com/smooth.htm |archivedate=2005-05-08 }}</ref> The first Smoothie club (TSC) was founded by a British couple in 1991.<ref>[http://www.wnn.nu/UK/welcome.html World of the Nudest Nudist, beauty of the shaved body] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814204219/http://www.wnn.nu/UK/welcome.html |date=August 14, 2007 }}</ref>  A Dutch branch was founded in 1993<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnn.nu/ |title=World of the Nudest Nudist - home of the barest naturists |publisher=Wnn.nu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21}}</ref> in order to give the idea of a hairless body greater publicity in the [[Netherlands]].

With this technology, light is directed at the hair and is absorbed by dark pigment, resulting in the destruction of the hair follicle. This hair removal method sometimes becomes permanent after several sessions. The number of sessions needed depends upon the amount and type of hair being removed. Equipment for performing laser hair removal at home has become available in recent years.\n* [[Intense pulsed light]] (IPL)\n*[[Diode]] epilation (high energy [[LED]]s but not [[laser diode]]s)\n\n== Clinical comparisons of effectiveness ==\nA 2006 review article in the journal \"Lasers in Medical Science\" compared intense pulsed light (IPL) and both alexandrite and diode lasers.

Hair reduction after 6 months was reported as 68.75% for alexandrite lasers, 71.71% for diode lasers, and 66.96% for IPL.

Some of these methods are still in the testing phase and have not been clinically proven.\n\nOne issue that can be considered an advantage or a disadvantage depending upon an individual's viewpoint, is that removing hair has the effect of removing information about the individual's hair growth patterns due to [[Genetics|genetic]] predisposition, illness, [[androgen]] levels (such as from pubertal hormonal imbalances or drug side effects), and/or [[gender]] status.\n\nIn the hair follicle, stem cells reside in a discrete microenvironment called the bulge, located at the base of the part of the follicle that is established during morphogenesis but does not degenerate during the hair cycle.

Hair does not generally grow on the [[lips]], the underside of the [[hand]]s or [[foot|feet]] or on certain areas of the [[genitalia]].\n\nHair removal may be practised for cultural, [[aesthetic]], [[hygiene]], sexual, medical or religious reasons. Forms of hair removal have been practised in almost all human cultures since at least the [[Neolithic]] era. The methods used to remove hair have varied in different times and regions, but [[shaving]] is the most common method.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n== History ==\nIn early history, hair was removed for cleanliness and fashion reasons. If the hair was cut and shaven it meant one was high class. In [[Ancient Egypt]], besides being a fashion statement hair removal also served as a treatment for [[Louse|louse infestation]], which was a prevalent issue in the region.{{citation needed |date=December 2019 |reason=contradicts research claiming long hair demonstrated power, example https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/18730/ \"long hair was predominant among women of all social statuses in all periods\"}} Commonly, they would replace the removed hair with wigs, which were seen as easier to maintain and also fashionable. They would remove their hair using two methods: [[waxing]] and [[shaving]]. If they chose to wax they would use caramelized sugar, and if they wanted to shave, they would use an early form of the [[straight razor]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=given illumin cite is insufficient to verify - it itself cites a now dead touregypt webpage.}}<ref name=\"illumin.usc.edu\">{{cite web |first=Amber |last=Bhargava |date=November 26, 2012 |url=http://illumin.usc.edu/277/beauty-and-the-geek-the-engineering-behind-laser-hair-removal/ |title=Beauty and the Geek: The Engineering Behind Laser Hair Removal |publisher=Illumin }}{{self-published source|date=October 2017}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=October 2017}}\n\nAs time went on new techniques were found to remove hair such as [[Laser hair removal]].\n\n== Cultural and sexual aspects ==\n{{See also|Bikini waxing|History of removal of leg and underarm hair in the United States}}\n[[File:Mujer afeitando sus piernas.jpg|thumb|[[Leg shaving]] by a female using a women's [[razor]].]]\n\nEach [[culture]] of human [[society]] developed [[social norms]] relating to the presence or absence of body hair, which has changed from one time to another. Different standards can apply to females and males. People whose hair falls outside a culture's aesthetic standards may experience real or perceived social acceptance problems. For example, for women in several societies, exposure in public of body hair other than head hair, eyelashes and eyebrows is generally considered to be [[aesthetic|unaesthetic]], unattractive and [[Embarrassment|embarrassing]].<ref name=Embod1>Heinz Tschachler, Maureen Devine, Michael Draxlbauer; ''The EmBodyment of American Culture''; pp 61\u201362; LIT Verlag, Berlin-Hamburg-M\u00fcnster; 2003; {{ISBN|3-8258-6762-5}}.</ref> In Middle Eastern societies, removal of the female body hair has been considered proper [[hygiene]], necessitated by local customs, for many centuries.<ref>Kutty, Ahmad (September 13, 2005) [http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&cid=1126012472670 \"Islamic Ruling on Waxing Unwanted Hair\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213192038/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&cid=1126012472670 |date=2008-02-13 }} Retrieved March 29, 2006</ref><ref>Irvin Cemil Schick, \"Some Islamic Determinants of Dress and Personal Appearance in Southwest Asia,\" ''Khil\u2019a'' 3 (2007\u20132009 [2011]), 25\u201353.</ref>\n\nWith the increased popularity in many countries of women wearing shorter dresses and swimsuits during the 20th century and the consequential exposure of parts of the body on which hair is commonly found, there has been an increase in the practice of women removing unwanted body hair, such as on legs, underarms and elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_012.html |title=Who decided women should shave their legs and underarms? |publisher=The Straight Dope |date=1991-02-06 |accessdate=2018-08-27}}</ref>  In the United States, for example, the vast majority of women regularly shave their legs and armpits, while roughly half also shave their bikini lines.\n\nMany men in Western cultures shave their facial hair, so only a minority of men have a [[beard]], even though fast-growing facial hair must be shaved daily to achieve a [[clean-shaven]] or hairless look. Some men shave because they cannot grow a \"full\" beard (generally defined as an even density from cheeks to neck) because their beard color is different from their scalp hair color, or because their facial hair grows in many directions, making a [[Personal grooming|groomed]] look difficult. Some men shave because their beards are very coarse, causing itchiness and irritation. Some men grow a beard or [[moustache]] from time to time to change their appearance.\n\nSome men [[head shaving|shave their heads]], either as a fashion statement, because they find a shaved head preferable to the appearance of [[male pattern baldness]], or in order to attain enhanced cooling of the skull \u2013 particularly for people suffering from [[hyperhidrosis]]. A much smaller number of Western women also shave their heads, often as a fashion or political statement.\n\nSome women also shave their heads for cultural or social reasons. In India, tradition required widows in some sections of the society to shave their heads as part of being [[ostracize]]d (see {{slink|Women in Hinduism|Widowhood and remarriage}}). The outlawed custom is still infrequently encountered mostly in rural areas. The society at large and the government are working to end the practice of ostracizing widows.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/07/05/damon.india.widows/index.html Shunned from society, widows flock to city to die], 2007-07-05, [http://www.cnn.com/ CNN.com], Retrieved 2007-07-05</ref> In addition, it continues to be common practice for men to shave their heads prior to embarking on a pilgrimage.\n\nPeople may also remove some or all of their [[pubic hair]] for [[bikini waxing|aesthetic or sexual reasons]]. This custom can be motivated by reasons of potentially increased cleanliness and hygiene, heightened enjoyment during [[sexual activity]], the desire to take on a more youthful appearance, and/or to boost self-confidence. Moreover, unwanted hair is often removed in preparatory situations by both sexes, in order to avoid socially awkward situations. For example, unwanted hair is removed in preparation for a sexual encounter or before visiting the beach.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThough traditionally in Western culture women remove body hair and men do not, some women choose not to remove hair from their bodies, either as a preference or as an act of defiance against what they regard to be an oppressive ritual, while some men remove or trim their body hair, a practice that is referred to as being a part of \"manscaping\" (a [[portmanteau word|portmanteau expression]] for [[Male grooming|male-specific grooming]]).\n\n===Fashions===\n\nThe term ''glabrousness'' also has been applied to human fashions,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} wherein some participate in culturally motivated hair removal by depilation (surface removal by [[shaving]], [[chemical depilatory|dissolving]]), or [[wiktionary:epilation|epilation]] (removal of the entire hair, such as [[waxing]] or [[plucking (hair removal)|plucking]]).\n\nAlthough the appearance of secondary hair on parts of the human body commonly occurs during [[puberty]], and therefore, is often seen as a symbol of adulthood, removal of this and other hair may become fashionable in some cultures and subcultures. In many modern [[Western culture]]s, men currently are encouraged to shave their beards, and women are encouraged to remove hair growth in various areas. Commonly depilated areas for women are the underarms, legs, and [[Pubic hair]]. Some individuals depilate the forearms. In recent years, bodily depilation in men has increased in popularity among some subcultures of Western males.\n\nAs with any cosmetic practice, the particulars of hair removal have changed over the years. Western female depilation has been significantly influenced by the evolution of clothing in the past century. Leg and underarm shaving became popular again{{when|date=January 2013}} in some parts of Western society with the advent of off-the-shoulder dresses, higher hemlines, and transparent stockings. The reduction of the minimum acceptable standards for bodily coverage over recent years has resulted in the exposure of more flesh, giving rise to more extensive hair removal in some cultures.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nEncouragement by commercial interests may be seen in advertising. At present, this has resulted in the \"[[Brazilian waxing]]\" trend involving the partial or full removal of pubic hair, as the [[G-string|thongs]] worn on Brazilian beaches are too small to conceal very much of it.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Indeed, a culture is now emerging around \"intimate shaving\" and other hair removal options geared specifically toward pubic hair. (''cf.'' [[bikini waxing]]) What was once kept a personal secret now is discussed more openly, although still in carefully non-explicit language, as advertised in magazines and on television.{{original research inline|date=March 2012}}\n\nFor men, the practice of depilating the pubic area is commonly referred to as manscaping, even though technically this term is applicable to hair removal all over the body. Many men will try this at some point in their lives, especially for aesthetic reasons. Most men will use a razor to shave this area, however, as best practice, it is recommended to use a body trimmer to shorten the length of the hair before shaving it off completely.\n\n===Cultural and other influences===\nIn ancient Egypt, depilation was commonly practiced, with [[pumice]] and [[razor]]s used to shave.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Boroughs|first1=Michael|last2=Cafri|first2=Guy|last3=Thompson|first3=J.

Emperor [[Augustus]] was said, by Suetonius, to have applied \"hot nutshells\" on his legs as a form of depilation.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Twelve Caesars, Aug. 68.}}</ref>\n\nThe majority of Muslims believe that adult removal of pubic and [[axillary hair]], as a hygienic measure, is [[religion|religiously]] beneficial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.understanding-islam.com/shaving-pubic-hair/ |title=Shaving Pubic Hair |work=Understanding Islam |date=10 February 1999}}</ref>\n\nBaptized [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] are specifically instructed never to cut, shave, or otherwise remove any hair on their bodies; this is a major tenet of the Sikh faith (''see [[Kesh (Sikhism)|Kesh]]'').\n\nIn the [[clothes free movement]], the term \"smoothie\" refers to an individual who has removed most of their hair. In the past, such practices were frowned upon and in some cases, members of clothes-free clubs were forbidden to remove their pubic hair: violators could face exclusion from the club. Enthusiasts grouped together and formed societies of their own that catered to that fashion and the fashion became more popular, with smoothies becoming a major percentage at some nudist venues.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euronaturist.com/smooth.htm |publisher=Euro Naturist |title=smooth naturists & nudists - Smoothies |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050508073900/http://www.euronaturist.com/smooth.htm |archivedate=2005-05-08 }}</ref> The first Smoothie club (TSC) was founded by a British couple in 1991.<ref>[http://www.wnn.nu/UK/welcome.html World of the Nudest Nudist, beauty of the shaved body] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814204219/http://www.wnn.nu/UK/welcome.html |date=August 14, 2007 }}</ref>  A Dutch branch was founded in 1993<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnn.nu/ |title=World of the Nudest Nudist - home of the barest naturists |publisher=Wnn.nu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21}}</ref> in order to give the idea of a hairless body greater publicity in the [[Netherlands]].

In field environments, soldiers are susceptible to infestation of [[lice]], [[tick]]s, and [[flea]]s. In addition, short hair is also more difficult for an enemy to grab hold of in hand-to-hand combat, and short hair makes fitting [[gas mask]]s and [[helmet]]s easier.\n\nThe practice serves to cultivate a group-oriented environment through the process of removing exterior signs of individuality.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In many militaries head-shaving is mandatory for males when beginning their training. However, even after the initial recruitment phase, when head-shaving is no longer required, many soldiers maintain a completely or partially shaven hairstyle (such as a \"[[high and tight]]\", \"[[flattop]]\" or \"[[buzz cut]]\") for personal convenience and an exterior symbol of military [[solidarity]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}  Head-shaving is not required and is often not allowed of females in military service, although they must have their hair cut or tied to regulation length.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nArmies may also require males to maintain clean-shaven faces as facial hair can prevent an air-tight seal between the face and breathing or safety equipment, such as a pilot's oxygen mask, a diver's mask, or a soldier's gas mask.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n=== In sport ===\nIt is a common practice for professional [[association football|footballers (soccer)]] and [[road cycling|road cyclists]] to remove leg hair for a number of reasons. In the case of a crash or tackle, the absence of the leg hair means the injuries (usually [[road rash]] or scarring) can be cleaned up more efficiently, and treatment is not impeded. Professional cyclists, as well as professional footballers, also receive regular leg massages, and the absence of hair reduces the friction and increases their comfort and effectiveness.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIt is also common for [[swimming (sport)|competitive swimmers]] to shave the hair off their legs, arms, and torsos, to reduce drag and provide a heightened \"feel\" for the water by removing the exterior layer of skin along with the body hair.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kostich|first=Alex|title=Why Swimmers Shave Their Bodies|url=http://www.active.com/swimming/Articles/Why-Swimmers-Shave-Their-Bodies.htm|work=active.com|publisher=Active network|accessdate=23 March 2014|date=2001-05-15}}</ref>  Some professional soccer players also shave their legs. One of the reasons is that they are required to wear shin guards and in case of a skin rash the affected area can be treated more efficiently.\n\n=== As punishment ===\nIn some situations, people's hair is shaved as a punishment or a form of humiliation.

The most common form of depilation is [[shaving]] or [[Cutting|trimming]]. Another option is the use of [[chemical depilatory|chemical depilatories]], which work by breaking the [[disulfide bond]]s that link the [[protein]] chains that give hair its strength.\n\n'''Epilation''' is the removal of the entire hair, including the part below the skin. Methods include [[waxing]], [[Sugaring (epilation)|sugaring]], [[epilator|epilation devices]], [[laser hair removal|lasers]], [[Threading (epilation)|threading]], [[intense pulsed light]] or [[electrology]].

Born in [[Guangzhou]] but raised in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Shanghai]], Pei drew inspiration at an early age from the garden villas at [[Suzhou]], the traditional retreat of the [[scholar-gentry]] to which his family belonged. In 1935, he moved to the United States and enrolled in the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s architecture school, but he quickly transferred to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. He was unhappy with the focus at both schools on [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], and spent his free time researching emerging architects, especially [[Le Corbusier]]. After graduating, he joined the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] (GSD) and became a friend of the [[Bauhaus]] architects [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Marcel Breuer]]. In 1948, Pei was recruited by [[New York City]] real estate magnate [[William Zeckendorf]], for whom he worked for seven years before establishing an independent design firm in 1955, I. M. Pei & Associates. In 1966 that became I. M. Pei & Partners in 1966, and in 1989 became [[Pei Cobb Freed & Partners]]. Pei retired from full-time practice in 1990. In his retirement, he worked as an architectural consultant primarily from his sons' architectural firm [[Pei Partnership Architects]].\n\nPei's first major recognition came with the [[Mesa Laboratory]] at the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] in [[Colorado]] (designed in 1961, and completed in 1967). His new stature led to his selection as chief architect for the [[John F. Kennedy Library]] in Massachusetts. He went on to design [[Dallas City Hall]] and the East Building of the [[National Gallery of Art]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |last1=Goldberger |first1=Paul |title=I.M.

In the early 1980s, Pei was the focus of controversy when he designed [[Louvre Pyramid|a glass-and-steel pyramid]] for the [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]] in Paris. He later returned to the world of the arts by designing the [[Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center]] in [[Dallas]], the [[Miho Museum]] in Japan, Shigaraki, near Kyoto, and the chapel of the junior and high school: MIHO Institute of Aesthetics, the [[Suzhou Museum]] in Suzhou,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://my-travel-in-china.com/category/jiangsu/ |title=Suzhou Museum \u2013 Suzhou |website=My \u00bbTravel in China\u00ab Site |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321151846/https://my-travel-in-china.com/category/jiangsu/ |archive-date=21 March 2019 |access-date=2019-03-21}}</ref> [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha|Museum of Islamic Art]] in [[Qatar]], and the [[Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art]], abbreviated to Mudam, in [[Luxembourg]].\n\nPei won a wide variety of prizes and awards in the field of architecture, including the [[AIA Gold Medal]] in 1979, the first [[Praemium Imperiale]] for Architecture in 1989, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum]] in 2003. In 1983, he won the [[Pritzker Prize]], which is sometimes referred to as the [[Nobel Prize]] of architecture.\n\n== Childhood ==\n[[File:Shizlinhehuaci.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Men and women stand on curving rock formations overlooking a pond containing flowery plants.|As a child, Pei found the [[Lion Grove Garden|Shizilin Garden]] in [[Suzhou]] to be \"an ideal playground\".<ref name=\"vb18\">Boehm, p. 18.</ref>]]\n\nPei's ancestry traces back to the [[Ming dynasty]], when his family moved from [[Anhui]] province to [[Suzhou]]. The family made their wealth in medicinal herbs, then proceeded to join the ranks of the scholar-gentry, a class which stressed the importance of helping the less fortunate.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 29\u201330; von Boehm, p. 17.</ref> Ieoh Ming Pei was born on 26 April 1917 to Tsuyee and Lien Kwun, and the family moved to [[Hong Kong]] one year later. The family eventually included five children. As a boy, Pei was very close to his mother, a devout [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] who was recognized for her skills as a [[flautist]]. She invited him (and not his brothers or sisters) to join her on meditation retreats.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 31\u201332; von Boehm, p. 25.</ref> His relationship with his father was less intimate. Their interactions were respectful but distant.<ref name=\"Wiseman, p. 31\">Wiseman, p. 31.</ref>\n\nPei's ancestors' success meant that the family lived in the upper echelons of society, but Pei said his father was \"not cultivated in the ways of the arts\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 31.</ref> The younger Pei, drawn more to music and other cultural forms than to his father's domain of banking, explored art on his own. \"I have cultivated myself,\" he said later.<ref name=\"Wiseman, p. 31\" />\n\nWhen Pei was 10, his father received a promotion and relocated with his family to Shanghai. Pei attended St. John's Middle School, run by [[Anglican]] missionaries. Academic discipline was rigorous; students were allowed only one half-day each month for leisure. Pei enjoyed playing [[Cue sports|billiards]] and watching Hollywood movies, especially those of [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]]. He also learned rudimentary English skills by reading the [[Bible]] and novels by [[Charles Dickens]].<ref name=\"w3133\">Wiseman, pp. 31\u201333.</ref>\n\n[[File:Shanghai Bund 2006.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Pedestrians walk before a row of trees and a series of tall buildings. A blue sky overhead is obscured slightly by several clouds.|Pei describes the architecture of Shanghai's [[The Bund (Shanghai)|Bund]] waterfront area (seen here in a 2006 photo) as \"very much a colonial past\".<ref>Boehm, p. 22.</ref>]]\n\nShanghai's many international elements gave it the name \"Paris of the East\".<ref>Boehm, p. 21.</ref> The city's global architectural flavors had a profound influence on Pei, from [[The Bund (Shanghai)|The Bund]] waterfront area to the [[Park Hotel Shanghai|Park Hotel]], built in 1934. He was also impressed by the many gardens of Suzhou, where he spent the summers with extended family and regularly visited a nearby ancestral shrine. The [[Lion Grove Garden|Shizilin Garden]], built in the 14th century by a Buddhist monk and owned by Pei's uncle Bei Runsheng, was especially influential. Its unusual rock formations, stone bridges, and waterfalls remained etched in Pei's memory for decades. He spoke later of his fondness for the garden's blending of natural and human-built structures.<ref name=\"vb18\" /><ref name=\"w3133\" />\n\nSoon after the move to Shanghai, Pei's mother developed cancer. As a pain reliever, she was prescribed [[opium]], and assigned the task of preparing her pipe to Pei. She died shortly after his thirteenth birthday, and he was profoundly upset.<ref>Boehm, p. 25.</ref> The children were sent to live with extended family; their father became more consumed by his work and more physically distant. Pei said: \"My father began living his own separate life pretty soon after that.\"<ref>Boehm, p. 26.</ref>  His father later married a woman named Aileen, who moved to New York later in her life.<ref>Gonzalez, David. \"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E5D91339F93BA15752C1A96E958260 About New York; A Chinese Oasis for the Soul on Staten Island]\". ''[[The New York Times]]''. 28 November 1998. Accessed on 17 January 2011.</ref>\n\n== Education and formative years ==\nAs Pei neared the end of his secondary education, he decided to study at a university. He was accepted in a number of schools, but decided to enroll at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 33\u201334.</ref> Pei's choice had two roots. While studying in Shanghai, he had closely examined the catalogs for various institutions of higher learning around the world. The architectural program at the University of Pennsylvania stood out to him.<ref>Wiseman, p. 34.</ref> The other major factor was Hollywood. Pei was fascinated by the representations of college life in the films of [[Bing Crosby]], which differed tremendously from the academic atmosphere in China. \"College life in the U.S. seemed to me to be mostly fun and games\", he said in 2000. \"Since I was too young to be serious, I wanted to be part of it&nbsp;... You could get a feeling for it in Bing Crosby's movies. College life in America seemed very exciting to me. It's not real, we know that. Nevertheless, at that time it was very attractive to me. I decided that was the country for me.\"<ref>Boehm, p. 34.</ref> Pei added that \"Crosby's films in particular had a tremendous influence on my choosing the United States instead of England to pursue my education.\"<ref>Boehm, pp. 33\u201334.</ref>\n\nIn 1935 Pei boarded a boat and sailed to [[San Francisco]], then traveled by train to [[Philadelphia]]. What he found once he arrived, however, differed vastly from his expectations. Professors at the University of Pennsylvania based their teaching in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts style]], rooted in the classical traditions of [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]]. Pei was more intrigued by [[modern architecture]], and also felt intimidated by the high level of [[Architectural drawing|drafting]] proficiency shown by other students. He decided to abandon architecture and transferred to the engineering program at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT). Once he arrived, however, the dean of the architecture school commented on his eye for design and convinced Pei to return to his original major.<ref>Wiseman, p. 35.</ref>\n\nMIT's architecture faculty was also focused on the Beaux-Arts school, and Pei found himself uninspired by the work. In the library he found three books by the Swiss-French architect [[Le Corbusier]]. Pei was inspired by the innovative designs of the new [[International Style (architecture)|International style]], characterized by simplified form and the use of glass and steel materials. Le Corbusier visited MIT in {{Nowrap|November 1935}}, an occasion which powerfully affected Pei: \"The two days with Le Corbusier, or 'Corbu' as we used to call him, were probably the most important days in my architectural education.\"<ref name=\"vb36\">Boehm, p. 36.</ref> Pei was also influenced by the work of U.S. architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. In 1938 he drove to [[Spring Green, Wisconsin|Spring Green]], [[Wisconsin]], to visit Wright's famous [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] building. After waiting for two hours, however, he left without meeting Wright.<ref name=\"wright\">Boehm, p. 36; Wiseman, p. 36.</ref>\n\nAlthough he disliked the Beaux-Arts emphasis at MIT, Pei excelled in his studies. \"I certainly don't regret the time at MIT\", he said later. \"There I learned the science and technique of building, which is just as essential to architecture.\"<ref name=\"vb40\">Boehm, p. 40.</ref> Pei received his [[Bachelor of Architecture|B.Arch.]] degree in 1940; his thesis was titled \"Standardized Propaganda Units for War Time and Peace Time China\".<ref>Boehm, pp. 40\u201341. Pei believed the term \"propaganda\" to be value-neutral; his advisers disapproved.</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.mit.edu/2019/renowned-architect-mit-alumnus-im-pei-dies-0517|title=Renowned architect I.M.

They began dating and they married in the spring of 1942. She enrolled in the [[landscape architecture]] program at [[Harvard University]], and Pei was thus introduced to members of the faculty at Harvard's [[Harvard Graduate School of Design|Graduate School of Design]] (GSD). He was excited by the lively atmosphere, and joined the GSD in {{Nowrap|December 1942}}.<ref>Wiseman, p. 39; Boehm, pp. 36\u201337.</ref>\n\nLess than a month later, Pei suspended his work at Harvard to join the [[National Defense Research Committee]], which coordinated scientific research into U.S. weapons technology during [[World War&nbsp;II]]. Pei's background in architecture was seen as a considerable asset; one member of the committee told him: \"If you know how to build you should also know how to destroy.\"<ref>Quoted in von Boehm, p. 42; a slightly different wording appears in Wiseman, p. 39: \"If you know how to build a building, you know how to destroy it.\"</ref> The fight against Germany was ending, so he focused on the [[Pacific War]]. The U.S. realized that its bombs used against the stone buildings of Europe would be ineffective against Japanese cities, mostly constructed from wood and paper; Pei was assigned to work on [[incendiary device|incendiary bombs]]. Pei spent two and a half years with the NDRC, but revealed few details of his work.<ref>Boehm, p. 42.</ref>\n\nIn 1945 Eileen gave birth to a son, T'ing Chung; she withdrew from the landscape architecture program in order to care for him. Pei returned to Harvard in the autumn of 1945, and received a position as assistant professor of design. The GSD was developing into a hub of resistance to the Beaux-Arts orthodoxy. At the center were members of the [[Bauhaus]], a European architectural movement that had advanced the cause of modernist design. The [[Nazi regime]] had condemned the Bauhaus school, and its leaders left Germany. Two of these, [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Marcel Breuer]], took positions at the Harvard GSD. Their iconoclastic focus on modern architecture appealed to Pei, and he worked closely with both men.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 41\u201343; Boehm, pp. 37\u201340.</ref>\n\nOne of Pei's design projects at the GSD was a plan for an art museum in Shanghai. He wanted to create a mood of Chinese authenticity in the architecture without using traditional materials or styles.<ref name=\"qw44\">Quoted in Wiseman, p., 44.</ref> The design was based on straight modernist structures, organized around a central courtyard garden, with other similar natural settings arranged nearby. It was very well received; Gropius, in fact, called it \"the best thing done in [my] master class\".<ref name=\"qw44\" /> Pei received his [[Master of Architecture|M.Arch.]] degree in 1946, and taught at Harvard for another two years.<ref name=\"Pei Cobb Freed & Partner\" /><ref>Wiseman, p. 45.</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n=== 1948\u20131956: early career with Webb and Knapp ===\n\nIn the spring of 1948 Pei was recruited by New York real estate magnate [[William Zeckendorf]] to join a staff of architects for his firm of [[Webb and Knapp]] to design buildings around the country. Pei found Zeckendorf's personality the opposite of his own; his new boss was known for his loud speech and gruff demeanor. Nevertheless, they became good friends and Pei found the experience personally enriching. Zeckendorf was well connected politically, and Pei enjoyed learning about the social world of New York's city planners.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 48\u201349.</ref>\n\nHis first project for Webb and Knapp was an apartment building with funding from the [[Housing Act of 1949]]. Pei's design was based on a circular tower with concentric rings. The areas closest to the supporting pillar handled utilities and circulation; the apartments themselves were located toward the outer edge. Zeckendorf loved the design and even showed it off to Le Corbusier when they met. The cost of such an unusual design was too high, however, and the building never moved beyond the model stage.<ref>Wiseman, p. 51.</ref>\n\n[[File:131 Ponce de Leon Ave., Atlanta - I.M. Pei building.JPG|thumb|left|Pei's first project (1949)<br /> [[131 Ponce de Leon Avenue]], Atlanta]]\n\nPei finally saw his architecture come to life in 1949,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcf-p.com/a/f/fme/imp/p/p.html|title=I. M. Pei|website=www.pcf-p.com}}</ref> when he designed a two-story [[131 Ponce de Leon Avenue|corporate building for Gulf Oil]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. The building was demolished in February 2013 although the front facade will be retained as part of an apartment development. His use of marble for the exterior [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]] brought praise from the journal ''Architectural Forum''.<ref>Wiseman, p. 52.</ref> Pei's designs echoed the work of [[Mies van der Rohe]] in the beginning of his career as also shown in his own weekend-house in [[Katonah, New York]] in 1952. Soon Pei was so inundated with projects that he asked Zeckendorf for assistants, which he chose from his associates at the GSD, including [[Henry N. Cobb]] and [[Ulrich Franzen]]. They set to work on a variety of proposals, including the [[Roosevelt Field (Shopping Mall)|Roosevelt Field Shopping Mall]]. The team also redesigned the Webb and Knapp office building, transforming Zeckendorf's office into a circular space with [[teak]] walls and a glass [[clerestory]]. They also installed a control panel into the desk that allowed their boss to control the lighting in his office. The project took one year and exceeded its budget, but Zeckendorf was delighted with the results.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 53\u201354.</ref>\n\n[[File:L'Enfant Plaza - IMG 1926.JPG|thumb|right|Pei wanted the open spaces and buildings of [[L'Enfant Plaza]] to be \"functionally and visually related\" to one another.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 61.</ref>]]\n\nIn 1952 Pei and his team began work on a series of projects in [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]]. The first of these was the Mile High Center, which compressed the core building into less than 25 percent of the total site; the rest is adorned with an exhibition hall and fountain-dotted plazas.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 57\u201358.</ref> One block away, Pei's team also redesigned Denver's Courthouse Square, which combined office spaces, commercial venues, and hotels. These projects helped Pei conceptualize architecture as part of the larger urban geography. \"I learned the process of development,\" he said later, \"and about the city as a living organism.\"<ref name=\"vb52\">Boehm, p. 52.</ref> These lessons, he said, became essential for later projects.<ref name=\"vb52\" />\n\nPei and his team also designed a united urban area for Washington, D.C., called [[L'Enfant Plaza]] (named for French-American architect [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]]).<ref name=\"PeiLenfant\">Williams, 2005, p. 120; Moeller and Weeks, 2006, p. 59.</ref> Pei's associate [[Araldo Cossutta]] was the lead architect for the plaza's North Building (955 L'Enfant Plaza SW) and South Building (490 L'Enfant Plaza SW).<ref name=\"PeiLenfant\" /> [[Vlastimil Koubek]] was the architect for the East Building ([[L'Enfant Plaza Hotel]], located at 480 L'Enfant Plaza SW), and for the Center Building (475 L'Enfant Plaza SW; now the [[United States Postal Service]] headquarters).<ref name=\"PeiLenfant\" /> The team set out with a broad vision that was praised by both ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[Washington Star]]'' (which rarely agreed on anything), but funding problems forced revisions and a significant reduction in scale.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 60\u201362.</ref>\n\nIn 1955 Pei's group took a step toward institutional independence from Webb and Knapp by establishing a new firm called I.&nbsp;M. Pei & Associates. (The name changed later to I.&nbsp;M. Pei & Partners.) They gained the freedom to work with other companies, but continued working primarily with Zeckendorf. The new firm distinguished itself through the use of detailed [[architectural model]]s. They took on the [[Kips Bay]] residential area on the east side of Manhattan, where Pei set up [[Kips Bay Towers]], two large long towers of apartments with recessed windows (to provide shade and privacy) in a neat grid, adorned with rows of trees. Pei involved himself in the construction process at Kips Bay, even inspecting the bags of concrete to check for consistency of color.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 62\u201364.</ref>\n\nThe company continued its urban focus with the [[Society Hill]] project in central [[Philadelphia]]. Pei designed the [[Society Hill Towers]], a three-building residential block injecting cubist design into the 18th-century milieu of the neighborhood. As with previous projects, abundant green spaces were central to Pei's vision, which also added traditional [[townhouse]]s to aid the transition from classical to modern design.<ref>Boehm, p. 51.</ref>\n\nFrom 1958 to 1963 Pei and [[Ray Affleck]] developed a key downtown block of [[Montreal]] in a phased process that involved one of Pei's most admired structures in the Commonwealth, the cruciform tower known as the Royal Bank Plaza ([[Place Ville Marie]]). According to ''[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]'' \"its grand plaza and lower office buildings, designed by internationally famous US architect I. M. Pei, helped to set new standards for architecture in [[Canada]] in the 1960s ... The tower's smooth aluminum and glass surface and crisp unadorned geometric form demonstrate Pei's adherence to the mainstream of 20th-century modern design.\"<ref>The Canadian Encyclopedia online version</ref>\n\nAlthough these projects were satisfying, Pei wanted to establish an independent name for himself. In 1959 he was approached by MIT to design a building for its [[Earth science]] program. The [[Green Building (MIT)|Green Building]] continued the grid design of Kips Bay and Society Hill. The pedestrian walkway at the ground floor, however, was prone to sudden gusts of wind, which embarrassed Pei. \"Here I was from MIT,\" he said, \"and I didn't know about [[wind-tunnel]] effects.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 67.</ref> At the same time, he designed the [[Luce Memorial Chapel]] in at [[Tunghai University]] in [[Taichung]], [[Taiwan]]. The soaring structure, commissioned by the same organisation that had run his middle school in Shanghai, broke severely from the cubist grid patterns of his urban projects.<ref>Wiseman, p. 67.</ref><ref>Wiseman, pp. 66\u201368.</ref>\n\nThe challenge of coordinating these projects took an artistic toll on Pei. He found himself responsible for acquiring new building contracts and supervising the plans for them. As a result, he felt disconnected from the actual creative work. \"Design is something you have to put your hand to,\" he said. \"While my people had the luxury of doing one job at a time, I had to keep track of the whole enterprise.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 69.</ref> Pei's dissatisfaction reached its peak at a time when financial problems began plaguing Zeckendorf's firm. I.&nbsp;M. Pei and Associates officially broke from Webb and Knapp in 1960, which benefited Pei creatively but pained him personally. He had developed a close friendship with Zeckendorf, and both men were sad to part ways.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 69\u201371.</ref>\n\n=== NCAR and related projects ===\n[[File:National Center for Atmospheric Research - Boulder, Colorado.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A series of brown boxlike buildings stand in front of a mountain.|Pei said he wanted the [[Mesa Laboratory]] of the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] to look \"as if it were carved out of the mountain\".<ref name=\"vb60\">Boehm, p. 60.</ref>]]\n\nPei was able to return to hands-on design when he was approached in 1961 by [[Walter Orr Roberts]] to design the new [[Mesa Laboratory]] for the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] outside [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], Colorado. The project differed from Pei's earlier urban work; it would rest in an open area in the foothills of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. He drove with his wife around the region, visiting assorted buildings and surveying the natural environs. He was impressed by the [[United States Air Force Academy]] in Colorado Springs, but felt it was \"detached from nature\".<ref>Boehm, p. 59.</ref>\n\nThe conceptualization stages were important for Pei, presenting a need and an opportunity to break from the Bauhaus tradition. He later recalled the long periods of time he spent in the area: \"I recalled the places I had seen with my mother when I was a little boy\u2014the mountaintop Buddhist retreats. There in the Colorado mountains, I tried to listen to the silence again\u2014just as my mother had taught me. The investigation of the place became a kind of religious experience for me.\"<ref name=\"vb60\" /> Pei also drew inspiration from the [[Mesa Verde National Park|Mesa Verde]] cliff dwellings of the [[Ancestral Puebloans]]; he wanted the buildings to exist in harmony with their natural surroundings.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 75\u201376.</ref> To this end, he called for a rock-treatment process that could color the buildings to match the nearby mountains. He also set the complex back on the mesa overlooking the city, and designed the approaching road to be long, winding, and indirect.<ref>Wiseman, p. 80.</ref>\n\nRoberts disliked Pei's initial designs, referring to them as \"just a bunch of towers\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 79.</ref> Roberts intended his comments as typical of scientific experimentation, rather than artistic critique; still, Pei was frustrated. His second attempt, however, fit Roberts' vision perfectly: a spaced-out series of clustered buildings, joined by lower structures and complemented by two underground levels. The complex uses many elements of [[Cubism|cubist]] design, and the walkways are arranged to increase the probability of casual encounters among colleagues.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 73, 86, and 90; Boehm, p. 61.</ref>\n\n[[File:Palm court 1995.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A grid of palm trees arranged in a tiled courtyard stands to the right of a dormitory building.|As with NCAR, Pei combined elements of cubism and natural harmony when designing the dormitories at [[New College of Florida]] in the mid-1960s.<ref>Wiseman, p. 94.</ref>]]\n\nOnce the laboratory was built, several problems with its construction became apparent. Leaks in the roof caused difficulties for researchers, and the shifting of clay soil beneath caused cracks in the buildings which were expensive to repair. Still, both architect and project manager were pleased with the final result. Pei referred to the NCAR complex as his \"breakout building\", and he remained a friend of Roberts until the scientist died in {{Nowrap|March 1990}}.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 91 and 74.</ref>\n\nThe success of NCAR brought renewed attention to Pei's design acumen. He was recruited to work on a variety of projects, including the [[S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications]] at [[Syracuse University]], the [[Everson Museum of Art]] in [[Syracuse, New York]], the [[Sundrome]] terminal at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in New York City, and dormitories at [[New College of Florida]].<ref>[http://www.ncf.edu/about-us/history History]. 2009. New College of Florida. Retrieved on 12 November 2009.</ref>\n\n=== Kennedy Library ===\n[[File:JFK library Stitch Crop.jpg|thumb|250px|left|alt=A white triangular tower rises beside a black glass building, with circular structures on either side.|Pei considered the [[John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum|John F. Kennedy Library]] \"the most important commission\" in his life.<ref name=\"vb56\">Boehm, p. 56.</ref>]]\n\nAfter President [[John F. Kennedy]] was [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassinated]] in {{Nowrap|November 1963}}, his family and friends discussed how to construct a library that would serve as a fitting memorial. A committee was formed to advise Kennedy's widow [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline]], who would make the final decision. The group deliberated for months and considered many famous architects.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 96\u201398.</ref> Eventually, Kennedy chose Pei to design the library, based on two considerations. First, she appreciated the variety of ideas he had used for earlier projects. \"He didn't seem to have just one way to solve a problem,\" she said. \"He seemed to approach each commission thinking only of it and then develop a way to make something beautiful.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 98.</ref> Ultimately, however, Kennedy made her choice based on her personal connection with Pei. Calling it \"really an emotional decision\", she explained: \"He was so full of promise, like Jack; they were born in the same year. I decided it would be fun to take a great leap with him.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 99.</ref>\n\nThe project was plagued with problems from the outset. The first was scope. President Kennedy had begun considering the structure of his library soon after taking office, and he wanted to include archives from his administration, a museum of personal items, and a political science institute. After the assassination, the list expanded to include a fitting memorial tribute to the slain president. The variety of necessary inclusions complicated the design process and caused significant delays.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 95 and 100.</ref>\n\nPei's first proposed design included a large glass pyramid that would fill the interior with sunlight, meant to represent the optimism and hope that Kennedy's administration had symbolized for so many in the United States. Mrs. Kennedy liked the design, but resistance began in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], the first proposed site for the building, as soon as the project was announced. Many community members worried that the library would become a tourist attraction, causing particular problems with traffic congestion. Others worried that the design would clash with the architectural feel of nearby [[Harvard Square]]. By the mid-70s, Pei tried proposing a new design, but the library's opponents resisted every effort.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 102\u2013113.</ref> These events pained Pei, who had sent all three of his sons to Harvard, and although he rarely discussed his frustration, it was evident to his wife. \"I could tell how tired he was by the way he opened the door at the end of the day,\" she said. \"His footsteps were dragging. It was very hard for I.&nbsp;M. to see that so many people didn't want the building.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 113.</ref>\n\nFinally the project moved to [[Columbia Point (Boston)|Columbia Point]], near the [[University of Massachusetts Boston]]. The new site was less than ideal; it was located on an old landfill, and just over a large sewage pipe. Pei's architectural team added more fill to cover the pipe and developed an elaborate ventilation system to conquer the odor. A new design was unveiled, combining a large square glass-enclosed atrium with a triangular tower and a circular walkway.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 115\u2013116.</ref>\n\nThe [[John F. Kennedy Library|John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum]] was dedicated on 20 October 1979. Critics generally liked the finished building, but the architect himself was unsatisfied. The years of conflict and compromise had changed the nature of the design, and Pei felt that the final result lacked its original passion. \"I wanted to give something very special to the memory of President Kennedy,\" he said in 2000. \"It could and should have been a great project.\"<ref name=\"vb56\" /> Pei's work on the Kennedy project boosted his reputation as an architect of note.<ref>Wiseman, p. 119.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|\"Pei Plan\" in Oklahoma City}}\n\n=== \"Pei Plan\" in Oklahoma City ===\n{{Main|Pei Plan}}\n\nThe Pei Plan was a failed urban redevelopment initiative designed for downtown [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]], Oklahoma, in the 1960s and 1970s. It is the informal name for two related commissions by Pei\u2014namely the Central Business District General Neighborhood Renewal Plan (design completed 1964) and the Central Business District Project I-A Development Plan (design completed 1966). It was formally adopted in 1965, and implemented in various public and private phases throughout the 1960s and 1970s.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe plan called for the demolition of hundreds of old downtown structures in favor of renewed parking, office building, and retail developments, in addition to public projects such as the Myriad Convention Center and the Myriad Botanical Gardens. It was the dominant template for downtown development in Oklahoma City from its inception through the 1970s. The plan generated mixed results and opinion, largely succeeding in re-developing office building and parking infrastructure but failing to attract its anticipated retail and residential development. Significant public resentment also developed as a result of the destruction of multiple historic structures. As a result, Oklahoma City's leadership avoided large-scale urban planning for downtown throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, until the passage of the [[Metropolitan Area Projects Plan|Metropolitan Area Projects]] (MAPS) initiative in 1993.<ref>[http://www.impeiokc.com/history/pei-model-history/ \"Pei Plan and Pei Model History\".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109035740/http://www.impeiokc.com/history/pei-model-history/ |date=9 November 2010 }} IM Pei Oklahoma City.

In 1964 the acting mayor of Dallas, [[J. Erik Jonsson|Erik Jonsson]], began working to change the community's image. Dallas was known and disliked as the city where the president had been killed, but Jonsson began a program designed to initiate a community renewal. One of the goals was a new city hall, which could be a \"symbol of the people\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 123.</ref> Jonsson, a co-founder of [[Texas Instruments]], learned about Pei from his associate [[Cecil Howard Green]], who had recruited the architect for MIT's [[Green Building (MIT)|Earth Sciences building]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 121\u2013123.</ref>\n\nPei's approach to the new [[Dallas City Hall]] mirrored those of other projects; he surveyed the surrounding area and worked to make the building fit. In the case of Dallas, he spent days meeting with residents of the city and was impressed by their civic pride. He also found that the skyscrapers of the downtown business district dominated the skyline, and sought to create a building which could face the tall buildings and represent the importance of the public sector. He spoke of creating \"a public-private dialogue with the commercial high-rises\".<ref>Wiseman, p. 125.</ref>\n\nWorking with his associate Theodore Musho, Pei developed a design centered on a building with a top much wider than the bottom; the facade leans at an angle of 34 degrees, which shades the building from the Texas sun. A plaza stretches out before the building, and a series of support columns holds it up. It was influenced by Le Corbusier's [[Government of Chandigarh|High Court building in Chandigarh]], India; Pei sought to use the significant overhang to unify the building and plaza. The project cost much more than initially expected, and took 11 years to complete. Revenue was secured in part by including a subterranean parking garage. The interior of the city hall is large and spacious; windows in the ceiling above the eighth floor fill the main space with light.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 127\u2013135.</ref>\n\nThe city of Dallas received the building well, and a local television news crew found unanimous approval of the new city hall when it officially opened to the public in 1978. Pei himself considered the project a success, even as he worried about the arrangement of its elements. He said: \"It's perhaps stronger than I would have liked; it's got more strength than finesse.\"<ref name=\"w136\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 136.</ref> He felt that his relative lack of experience left him without the necessary design tools to refine his vision, but the community liked the city hall enough to invite him back. Over the years he went on to design five additional buildings in the Dallas area.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 136\u2013137.</ref>\n\n=== Hancock Tower, Boston ===\n[[File:Plylwood palace.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Two dark buildings rise into the early evening sky. The tower on the right is spotted with plywood on its side.|The disastrous failure of windows on the [[200 Clarendon Street|Hancock Tower]] required replacing them with plywood; some called it \"the world's tallest wood building\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 149.</ref>]]\n\nWhile Pei and Musho were coordinating the Dallas project, their associate [[Henry N. Cobb|Henry Cobb]] had taken the helm for a commission in Boston. [[John Hancock Insurance]] chairman Robert Slater hired I.&nbsp;M. Pei & Partners to design a building that could overshadow the [[Prudential Tower]], erected by [[Prudential Insurance|their rival]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 140 and 145.</ref>\n\nAfter the firm's first plan was discarded due to a need for more office space, Cobb developed a new plan around a towering parallelogram, slanted away from the [[Trinity Church (Boston)|Trinity Church]] and accented by a wedge cut into each narrow side. To minimize the visual impact, the building was covered in large reflective glass panels; Cobb said this would make the building a \"background and foil\" to the older structures around it.<ref>Wiseman, p. 147.</ref> When the [[200 Clarendon Street|Hancock Tower]] was finished in 1976, it was the tallest building in [[New England]].<ref>Wiseman, p. 145.</ref>\n[[File:Johnson-museum-of-art-cornell.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Herbert F.

Many glass panels fractured in a windstorm during construction in 1973. Some detached and fell to the ground, causing no injuries but sparking concern among Boston residents. In response, the entire tower was reglazed with smaller panels. This significantly increased the cost of the project. Hancock sued the glass manufacturers, Libbey-Owens-Ford, as well as I.&nbsp;M. Pei & Partners, for submitting plans that were \"not good and workmanlike\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 150.</ref> LOF countersued Hancock for defamation, accusing Pei's firm of poor use of their materials; I.&nbsp;M. Pei & Partners sued LOF in return. All three companies settled out of court in 1981.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 149\u2013150.</ref>\n\nThe project became an [[Albatross (metaphor)|albatross]] for Pei's firm. Pei himself refused to discuss it for many years. The pace of new commissions slowed and the firm's architects began looking overseas for opportunities. Cobb worked in [[Australia]] and Pei took on jobs in [[Singapore]], [[Iran]], and [[Kuwait]]. Although it was a difficult time for everyone involved, Pei later reflected with patience on the experience. \"Going through this trial toughened us,\" he said. \"It helped to cement us as partners; we did not give up on each other.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 153.</ref>\n\n=== National Gallery East Building, Washington, DC ===\n\n[[File:National Gallery East Wing by Matthew Bisanz.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A large grey building rises above a stone plaza. Short square towers appear on either side of the building, and an array of irregular glass pyramids are in the middle of the plaza.|''Time'' magazine headlined its review of Pei's design for the East Building \"Masterpiece on the Mall\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 181.</ref>]]\n\nIn the mid-1960s, directors of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], declared the need for a new building. [[Paul Mellon]], a primary benefactor of the gallery and a member of its building committee, set to work with his assistant [[J. Carter Brown]] (who became gallery director in 1969) to find an architect. The new structure would be located to the east of the original building, and tasked with two functions: offer a large space for public appreciation of various popular collections; and house office space as well as archives for scholarship and research. They likened the scope of the new facility to the [[Library of Alexandria]]. After inspecting Pei's work at the [[Des Moines Art Center]] in Iowa and the [[Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art|Johnson Museum]] at [[Cornell University]], they offered him the commission.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 155\u2013161.</ref>\n\nPei took to the project with vigor, and set to work with two young architects he had recently recruited to the firm, [[William Pedersen (architect)|William Pedersen]] and [[Yann Weymouth]]. Their first obstacle was the unusual shape of the building site, a [[trapezoid]] of land at the intersection of [[Constitution Avenue|Constitution]] and [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenues]]. Inspiration struck Pei in 1968, when he scrawled a rough diagram of two triangles on a scrap of paper. The larger building would be the public gallery; the smaller would house offices and archives. This triangular shape became a singular vision for the architect. As the date for groundbreaking approached, Pedersen suggested to his boss that a slightly different approach would make construction easier. Pei simply smiled and said: \"No compromises.\"<ref>Wiseman, pp. 164\u2013165.</ref>\n\nThe growing popularity of art museums presented unique challenges to the architecture. Mellon and Pei both expected large crowds of people to visit the new building, and they planned accordingly. To this end, Pei designed a large lobby roofed with enormous skylights. Individual galleries are located along the periphery, allowing visitors to return after viewing each exhibit to the spacious main room. A large [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobile sculpture]] by American artist [[Alexander Calder]] was later added to the lobby.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 179\u2013180.</ref> Pei hoped the lobby would be exciting to the public in the same way as the central room of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] is in New York City. The modern museum, he said later, \"must pay greater attention to its educational responsibility, especially to the young\".<ref>Boehm, p. 65.</ref>\n\n[[File:Nga fg04.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A large open cement room contains several people on the ground far below a balcony. Several trees are planted in the concrete floor, and an array of clear windows let in sunshine from above.|Critic Richard Hennessy complained in  ''[[Artforum]]'' about the East Building's \"shocking fun-house atmosphere\".<ref name=\"w182\" />]]\n\nMaterials for the building's exterior were chosen with careful precision. To match the look and texture of the original gallery's marble walls, builders re-opened the quarry in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], Tennessee, from which the first batch of stone had been harvested. The project even found and hired Malcolm Rice, a quarry supervisor who had overseen the original 1941 gallery project. The marble was cut into three-inch-thick blocks and arranged over the concrete foundation, with darker blocks at the bottom and lighter blocks on top.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 177\u2013178.</ref>\n\nThe East Building was honored on 30 May 1978, two days before its public unveiling, with a black-tie party attended by celebrities, politicians, benefactors, and artists. When the building opened, popular opinion was enthusiastic. Large crowds visited the new museum, and critics generally voiced their approval. [[Ada Louise Huxtable]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Pei's building was \"a palatial statement of the creative accommodation of contemporary art and architecture\".<ref name=\"w182\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 182.</ref> The sharp angle of the smaller building has been a particular note of praise for the public; over the years it has become stained and worn from the hands of visitors.<ref>Boehm, p. 68.</ref>\n\nSome critics disliked the unusual design, however, and criticized the reliance on triangles throughout the building. Others took issue with the large main lobby, particularly its attempt to lure casual visitors. In his review for ''[[Artforum]]'', critic Richard Hennessy described a \"shocking fun-house atmosphere\" and \"aura of ancient Roman patronage\".<ref name=\"w182\" /> One of the earliest and most vocal critics, however, came to appreciate the new gallery once he saw it in person. [[Allan Greenberg]] had scorned the design when it was first unveiled, but wrote later to [[J. Carter Brown]]: \"I am forced to admit that you are right and I was wrong! The building is a masterpiece.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 183.</ref>\n<!--\nStarting in 2005, the joints attaching the marble panels to the walls began to show signs of strain, creating a risk of panels falling off the building onto the public below.  In 2008 officials decided that it would be necessary to remove and reinstall ''all'' the panels.  The project was scheduled for completion in 2013.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703558004574581890709007568 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=An Ultramodern Building Shows Signs of Age | first=Catesby | last=Leigh | date=8 December 2009}}</ref>\n-->\n\n=== Fragrant Hills, China ===\nAfter U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] made his famous [[1972 Nixon visit to China|1972 visit to China]], a wave of exchanges took place between the two countries. One of these was a delegation of the [[American Institute of Architects]] in 1974, which Pei joined. It was his first trip back to China since leaving in 1935. He was favorably received, returned the welcome with positive comments, and a series of lectures ensued. Pei noted in one lecture that since the 1950s Chinese architects had been content to imitate Western styles; he urged his audience in one lecture to search China's native traditions for inspiration.<ref>Wiseman, p. 189.</ref>\n[[File:Fragrant Hill Hotel.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A white building with ornamented windows faces a lake ringed with rock structures. Trees appear around the structure.|Pei was surprised by public resistance to his traditional design of the hotel at [[Fragrant Hills]] in China. \"Many people thought I was being reactionary,\" he said.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 193.</ref>]]\nIn 1978, Pei was asked to initiate a project for his home country. After surveying a number of different locations, Pei fell in love with a valley that had once served as an imperial garden and hunting preserve known as [[Fragrant Hills]]. The site housed a decrepit hotel; Pei was invited to tear it down and build a new one. As usual, he approached the project by carefully considering the context and purpose. Likewise, he considered modernist styles inappropriate for the setting. Thus, he said, it was necessary to find \"a third way\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 192; Wiseman, pp. 189\u201392.</ref>\n\nAfter visiting his ancestral home in Suzhou, Pei created a design based on some simple but nuanced techniques he admired in traditional residential Chinese buildings. Among these were abundant gardens, integration with nature, and consideration of the relationship between enclosure and opening. Pei's design included a large central atrium covered by glass panels that functioned much like the large central space in his East Building of the National Gallery. Openings of various shapes in walls invited guests to view the natural scenery beyond. Younger Chinese who had hoped the building would exhibit some of Cubist flavor for which Pei had become known were disappointed, but the new hotel found more favour with government officials and architects.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 192\u2013193.</ref>\n\nThe hotel, with 325 guest rooms and a four-story central atrium, was designed to fit perfectly into its natural habitat. The trees in the area were of special concern, and particular care was taken to cut down as few as possible. He worked with an expert from Suzhou to preserve and renovate a water maze from the original hotel, one of only five in the country. Pei was also meticulous about the arrangement of items in the garden behind the hotel; he even insisted on transporting {{convert|230|ST|t}} of rocks from a location in southwest China to suit the natural aesthetic. An associate of Pei's said later that he never saw the architect so involved in a project.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 201\u2013203.</ref>\n\nDuring construction, a series of mistakes collided with the nation's lack of technology to strain relations between architects and builders. Whereas 200&nbsp;or so workers might have been used for a similar building in the US, the Fragrant Hill project employed over 3,000&nbsp;workers. This was mostly because the construction company lacked the sophisticated machines used in other parts of the world. The problems continued for months, until Pei had an uncharacteristically emotional moment during a meeting with Chinese officials. He later explained that his actions included \"shouting and pounding the table\" in frustration.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 205.</ref> The design staff noticed a difference in the manner of work among the crew after the meeting. As the opening neared, however, Pei found the hotel still needed work. He began scrubbing floors with his wife and ordered his children to make beds and vacuum floors. The project's difficulties took an emotional and physical strain on the Pei family.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 204\u2013205.</ref>\n\nThe Fragrant Hill Hotel opened on 17 October 1982 but quickly fell into disrepair. A member of Pei's staff returned for a visit several years later and confirmed the dilapidated condition of the hotel. He and Pei attributed this to the country's general unfamiliarity with deluxe buildings.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 206.</ref> The Chinese architectural community at the time gave the structure little attention, as their interest at the time centered on the work of American [[postmodern architecture|postmodernists]] such as [[Michael Graves]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 206\u2013207.</ref>\n\n=== Javits Convention Center, New York ===\n[[File:Javits Center 11av jeh.JPG|thumb|alt=A building of dark tinted glass stands over a city street. The corners of the building are smoothed at 45-degree angles.|Pei said of the [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center]]: \"The complications exceeded even my expectations.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 211.</ref>]]\n\nAs the Fragrant Hill project neared completion, Pei began work on the [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center]] in New York City, for which his associate [[James Ingo Freed|James Freed]] served as lead designer. Hoping to create a vibrant community institution in what was then a run-down neighborhood on Manhattan's west side, Freed developed a glass-coated structure with an intricate [[space frame]] of interconnected metal rods and spheres.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 211\u2013216.</ref>\n\nThe convention center was plagued from the start by budget problems and construction blunders. City regulations forbid a general contractor having final authority over the project, so architects and program manager Richard Kahan had to coordinate the wide array of builders, plumbers, electricians, and other workers. The forged steel globes to be used in the space frame came to the site with hairline cracks and other defects: 12,000 were rejected. These and other problems led to media comparisons with the disastrous Hancock Tower. One New York City official blamed Kahan for the difficulties, indicating that the building's architectural flourishes were responsible for delays and financial crises.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 222\u2013224.</ref> The Javits Center opened on 3 April 1986, to a generally positive reception. During the inauguration ceremonies, however, neither Freed nor Pei was recognized for their role in the project.\n\n=== Le Grand Louvre, Paris ===\n{{main|Louvre Pyramid}}\n[[File:Paris 75001 Cour Napol\u00e9on Louvre Aile Turgot 02a.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A classical building with ornamental design rises above a small crowd. Rounded archways line the front of the structure.|Pei was acutely aware, as he said, that \"the history of Paris was embedded in the stones of the Louvre.\"<ref name=\"Boehm, p. 84\">Boehm, p. 84.</ref>]]\n\nWhen [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] was elected President of France in 1981, he laid out an ambitious plan for a variety of construction projects. One of these was the renovation of the [[Louvre Museum]]. Mitterrand appointed a civil servant named \u00c9mile Biasini {{ill|\u00c9mile Biasini|fr}} to oversee it. After visiting museums in Europe and the United States, including the U.S. National Gallery, he asked Pei to join the team. The architect made three secretive trips to Paris, to determine the feasibility of the project; only one museum employee knew why he was there.<ref>Wiseman, p. 233; Boehm, p. 77.</ref> Pei finally agreed that a reconstruction project was not only possible, but necessary for the future of the museum. He thus became the first foreign architect to work on the Louvre.<ref>Wiseman, p. 234.</ref>\n\nThe heart of the new design included not only a renovation of the ''Cour Napol\u00e9on'' in the midst of the buildings, but also a transformation of the interiors. Pei proposed a central entrance, not unlike the lobby of the National Gallery East Building, which would link the three major buildings. Below would be a complex of additional floors for research, storage, and maintenance purposes. At the center of the courtyard he designed a [[Louvre Pyramid|glass and steel pyramid]], first proposed with the Kennedy Library, to serve as entrance and anteroom skylight. It was mirrored by [[Pyramide Invers\u00e9e|another inverted pyramid]] underneath, to reflect sunlight into the room. These designs were partly an homage to the fastidious geometry of the famous French landscape architect [[Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre]] (1613\u20131700).<ref>Wiseman, pp. 235\u2013236.</ref> Pei also found the pyramid shape best suited for stable transparency, and considered it \"most compatible with the architecture of the Louvre, especially with the faceted planes of its roofs\".<ref name=\"Boehm, p. 84\" />\n\nBiasini and Mitterrand liked the plans, but the scope of the renovation displeased Louvre director Andr\u00e9 Chabaud. He resigned from his post, complaining that the project was \"unfeasible\" and posed \"architectural risks\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 240.</ref> The public also reacted harshly to the design, mostly because of the proposed pyramid.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 249\u2013250.</ref> One critic called it a \"gigantic, ruinous gadget\";<ref name=\"w249\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 249.</ref> another charged Mitterrand with \"despotism\" for inflicting Paris with the \"atrocity\".<ref name=\"w249\" /> Pei estimated that 90&nbsp;percent of Parisians opposed his design. \"I received many angry glances in the streets of Paris,\" he said.<ref>Boehm, p. 80.</ref> Some condemnations carried [[nationalism|nationalistic]] overtones. One opponent wrote: \"I am surprised that one would go looking for a Chinese architect in America to deal with the historic heart of the capital of France.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 250.</ref>\n\n[[File:Louvre Museum Wikimedia Commons.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A grey pyramid sits in the center of a courtyard, surrounded by ancient buildings.|Pei decided that a pyramid was \"most compatible\" with the other structures at the Louvre, complementing their roofs' faceted planes.<ref name=\"Boehm, p. 84\" />]]\nSoon, however, Pei and his team won the support of several key cultural icons, including the conductor [[Pierre Boulez]] and [[Claude Pompidou]], widow of former French President [[Georges Pompidou]], after whom [[Centre Georges Pompidou|another controversial museum]] was named. In an attempt to soothe public ire, Pei took a suggestion from then-mayor of Paris [[Jacques Chirac]] and placed a full-sized cable model of the pyramid in the courtyard. During the four days of its exhibition, an estimated 60,000&nbsp;people visited the site. Some critics eased their opposition after witnessing the proposed scale of the pyramid.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 251\u2013252.</ref>\n\nTo minimize the impact of the structure, Pei demanded a method of glass production that resulted in clear panes. The pyramid was constructed at the same time as the subterranean levels below, which caused difficulties during the building stages. As they worked, construction teams came upon an abandoned set of rooms containing 25,000&nbsp;historical items; these were incorporated into the rest of the structure to add a new exhibition zone.<ref>Wiseman, p. 257.</ref>\n\nThe new Louvre courtyard was opened to the public on 14 October 1988, and the Pyramid entrance was opened the following March. By this time, public opinion had softened on the new installation; a poll found a 56 percent approval rating for the pyramid, with 23 percent still opposed. The newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' had vehemently criticized Pei's design, but later celebrated the tenth anniversary of its magazine supplement at the pyramid.<ref name=\"w255\">Wiseman, pp. 255\u2013259.</ref> [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] of Britain surveyed the new site with curiosity, and declared it \"marvelous, very exciting\".<ref name=\"w259\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 259.</ref> A writer in ''[[Le Quotidien de Paris]]'' wrote: \"The much-feared pyramid has become adorable.\"<ref name=\"w259\" />\n\nThe experience was exhausting for Pei, but also rewarding. \"After the Louvre,\" he said later, \"I thought no project would be too difficult.\"<ref>Boehm, p. 90.</ref>  The pyramid achieved further widepread international recognition for its central role in the plot at the denouement of ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' by [[Dan Brown]] and its appearance in the final scene of the subsequent [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|screen adaptation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.louvre.fr/en/routes/da-vinci-code|title=Visitor trails : The Da Vinci Code: Between Fiction and Fact \u2013 Louvre Museum \u2013 Paris|website=www.louvre.fr}}</ref> The ''[[Louvre Pyramid]]'' has become Pei's most famous structure.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ching|first=Francis|author2=Jarxombek, Mark|others=Prakash, Vikramaditya|title=A Global History of Architecture|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc|location=New Jersey|year=2007|page=[https://archive.org/details/globalhistoryofa0000chin/page/742 742]|isbn=978-0-471-26892-5|url=https://archive.org/details/globalhistoryofa0000chin/page/742}}</ref>\n\n=== Meyerson Symphony Center, Dallas ===\nThe opening of the Louvre Pyramid coincided with four other projects on which Pei had been working, prompting architecture critic [[Paul Goldberger]] to declare 1989 \"the year of Pei\" in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/17/arts/architecture-view-a-year-of-years-for-the-high-priest-of-modernism.html?pagewanted=all|title=ARCHITECTURE VIEW; A Year of Years for the High Priest of Modernism|work=The New York Times |authorlink=Paul Goldberger|first=Paul|last=Goldberger|date=17 September 1989|accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref> It was also the year in which Pei's firm changed its name to [[Pei Cobb Freed & Partners]], to reflect the increasing stature and prominence of his associates. At the age of 72, Pei had begun thinking about retirement, but continued working long hours to see his designs come to light.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 263\u2013264.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dallas Meyerson Center 02.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A beige cube rises at an angle around a half-cone made of glass and steel. In front, a square archway overlooks a stone courtyard.|Although he usually designed entirely by hand, Pei used a computer to \"confirm the spaces\" for the [[Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center]] in [[Dallas]].<ref>Wiseman, p. 272.</ref>]]\nOne of the projects took Pei back to Dallas, Texas, to design the [[Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center]]. The success of city's performing artists, particularly the [[Dallas Symphony Orchestra]] then led by conductor [[Eduardo Mata]], led to interest by city leaders in creating a modern center for musical arts that could rival the best halls in [[Europe]]. The organizing committee contacted 45&nbsp;architects, but at first Pei did not respond, thinking that his work on the Dallas City Hall had left a negative impression. One of his colleagues from that project, however, insisted that he meet with the committee. He did and, although it would be his first concert hall, the committee voted unanimously to offer him the commission. As one member put it: \"We were convinced that we would get the world's greatest architect putting his best foot forward.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 267.</ref>\n\nThe project presented a variety of specific challenges. Because its main purpose was the presentation of live music, the hall needed a design focused on [[acoustics]] first, then public access and exterior aesthetics. To this end, a professional sound technician was hired to design the interior. He proposed a [[Shoebox style (architecture)|shoebox]] auditorium, used in the acclaimed designs of top European symphony halls such as the [[Concertgebouw|Amsterdam Concertgebouw]] and [[Musikverein|Vienna Musikverein]]. Pei drew inspiration for his adjustments from the designs of the German architect [[Johann Balthasar Neumann]], especially the [[Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers]]. He also sought to incorporate some of the panache of the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Op\u00e9ra]] designed by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 269\u2013270.</ref>\n\nPei's design placed the rigid shoebox at an angle to the surrounding street grid, connected at the north end to a long rectangular office building, and cut through the middle with an assortment of circles and cones. The design attempted to reproduce with modern features the acoustic and visual functions of traditional elements like [[filigree]]. The project was risky: its goals were ambitious and any unforeseen acoustic flaws would be virtually impossible to remedy after the hall's completion. Pei admitted that he did not completely know how everything would come together. \"I can imagine only 60&nbsp;percent of the space in this building,\" he said during the early stages. \"The rest will be as surprising to me as to everyone else.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 272.</ref> As the project developed, costs rose steadily and some sponsors considered withdrawing their support. Billionaire tycoon [[Ross Perot]] made a donation of US$10&nbsp;million, on the condition that it be named in honor of Morton H. Meyerson, the longtime patron of the arts in Dallas.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 273\u2013274.</ref>\n\nThe building opened and immediately garnered widespread praise, especially for its acoustics. After attending a week of performances in the hall, a music critic for ''The New York Times'' wrote an enthusiastic account of the experience and congratulated the architects. One of Pei's associates told him during a party before the opening that the symphony hall was \"a very mature building\"; he smiled and replied: \"Ah, but did I have to wait this long?\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 286.</ref>\n\n=== Bank of China, Hong Kong ===\n\nA new offer had arrived for Pei from the Chinese government in 1982. With an eye toward the [[transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong]] from the British in 1997, authorities in China sought Pei's aid on a new tower for the local branch of the [[Bank of China]]. The Chinese government was preparing for a new wave of engagement with the outside world and sought a tower to represent modernity and economic strength. Given the elder Pei's history with the bank before the Communist takeover, government officials visited the 89-year-old man in New York to gain approval for his son's involvement. Pei then spoke with his father at length about the proposal. Although the architect remained pained by his experience with Fragrant Hills, he agreed to accept the commission.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 286\u2013287.</ref>\n\nThe proposed site in Hong Kong's [[Central, Hong Kong|Central District]] was less than ideal; a tangle of highways lined it on three sides. The area had also been home to a headquarters for Japanese military police during World War&nbsp;II, and was notorious for prisoner torture. The small parcel of land made a tall tower necessary, and Pei had usually shied away from such projects; in Hong Kong especially, the skyscrapers lacked any real architectural character. Lacking inspiration and unsure of how to approach the building, Pei took a weekend vacation to the family home in [[Katonah, New York|Katonah]], New York. There he found himself experimenting with a bundle of sticks until he happened upon a cascading sequence.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 287\u2013288.</ref>\n\nPei felt that his design for the [[Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong|Bank of China Tower]] needed to reflect \"the aspirations of the Chinese people\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 288.</ref>  The design that he developed for the skyscraper was not only unique in appearance, but also sound enough to pass the city's rigorous standards for wind-resistance. The building is composed of four triangular shafts rising up from a square base, supported by a visible [[truss]] structure that distributes stress to the four corners of the base. Using the reflective glass that had become something of a trademark for him, Pei organized the facade around  diagonal bracing in a union of structure and form that reiterates the triangle motif established in the plan. At the top, he designed the roofs at sloping angles to match the rising aesthetic of the building. Some influential advocates of ''[[feng shui]]'' in Hong Kong and China criticized the design, and Pei and government officials responded with token adjustments.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 289\u2013291.</ref>\n\nAs the tower neared completion, Pei was shocked to witness the government's massacre of unarmed civilians at the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. He wrote an opinion piece for ''The New York Times'' titled \"China Won't Ever Be the Same,\" in which he said that the killings \"tore the heart out of a generation that carries the hope for the future of the country\".<ref name=\"WQ294\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 294.</ref> The massacre deeply disturbed his entire family, and he wrote that \"China is besmirched.\"<ref name=\"WQ294\" />\n\n=== 1990\u20132019: museum projects ===\n[[File:Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A grey tiled building rises over a lake, with a cylinder set on a narrow pole, and a sloping glass wall on one end.|One staff member sympathized with Pei's frustrations with the lack of organization at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], admitting that he was \"operating in a vacuum\".<ref name=\"WQ307\" />]]\n\nAs the 1990s began, Pei transitioned into a role of decreased involvement with his firm. The staff had begun to shrink, and Pei wanted to dedicate himself to smaller projects allowing for more creativity. Before he made this change, however, he set to work on his last major project as active partner: the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. Considering his work on such bastions of [[high culture]] as the Louvre and U.S. National Gallery, some critics were surprised by his association with what many considered a tribute to [[low culture]]. The sponsors of the hall, however, sought Pei for specifically this reason; they wanted the building to have an aura of respectability from the beginning. As in the past, Pei accepted the commission in part because of the unique challenge it presented.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 303\u2013306.</ref>\n\nUsing a glass wall for the entrance, similar in appearance to his Louvre pyramid, Pei coated the exterior of the main building in white metal, and placed a large cylinder on a narrow perch to serve as a performance space. The combination of off-centered wraparounds and angled walls was, Pei said, designed to provide \"a sense of tumultuous youthful energy, rebelling, flailing about\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 306.</ref>\n\nThe building opened in 1995, and was received with moderate praise. ''The New York Times'' called it \"a fine building\", but Pei was among those who felt disappointed with the results. The museum's early beginnings in New York combined with an unclear mission created a fuzzy understanding among project leaders for precisely what was needed.<ref name=\"WQ307\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 307.</ref> Although the city of Cleveland benefited greatly from the new tourist attraction, Pei was unhappy with it.<ref name=\"WQ307\" />\n\nAt the same time, Pei designed a new museum for [[Luxembourg]], the ''Mus\u00e9e d'art moderne Grand-Duc Jean'', commonly known as the [[Mudam]]. Drawing from the original shape of the [[Fort Th\u00fcngen]] walls where the museum was located, Pei planned to remove a portion of the original foundation. Public resistance to the historical loss forced a revision of his plan, however, and the project was nearly abandoned. The size of the building was halved, and it was set back from the original wall segments to preserve the foundation. Pei was disappointed with the alterations, but remained involved in the building process even during construction.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 311\u2013313.</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Pei was hired to design an extension to the ''[[Deutsches Historisches Museum]]'', or German Historical Museum in Berlin. Returning to the challenge of the East Building of the U.S. National Gallery, Pei worked to combine a [[Modernism|modernist]] approach with a classical main structure. He described the glass cylinder addition as a \"beacon,\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 315.</ref> and topped it with a glass roof to allow plentiful sunlight inside. Pei had difficulty working with German government officials on the project; their utilitarian approach clashed with his passion for aesthetics. \"They thought I was nothing but trouble\", he said.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 316.</ref>\n\nPei also worked at this time on two projects for a [[Japanese new religions|new Japanese religious movement]] called ''[[Shinji Shumeikai]]''. He was approached by the movement's spiritual leader, Kaishu Koyama, who impressed the architect with her sincerity and willingness to give him significant artistic freedom. One of the buildings was a bell tower, designed to resemble the ''[[bachi]]'' used when playing traditional instruments like the ''[[shamisen]]''. Pei was unfamiliar with the movement's beliefs, but explored them in order to represent something meaningful in the tower. As he said: \"It was a search for the sort of expression that is not at all technical.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 300.</ref>\n\n[[File:Miho museum02n3872.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A curving circular tunnel opens to reveal a building with a tall sloping roof and a circular window in the front door.|Pei's tunnel through a mountain leading to the [[Miho Museum]] was partly inspired by a story from fourth-century Chinese poet [[Tao Yuanming]].<ref>Boehm, pp. 99\u2013100.</ref>]]\nThe experience was rewarding for Pei, and he agreed immediately to work with the group again. The new project was the [[Miho Museum]], to display Koyama's collection of [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] artifacts. Pei visited the site in [[Shiga Prefecture]], and during their conversations convinced Koyama to expand her collection. She conducted a global search and acquired more than 300&nbsp;items showcasing the history of the [[Silk Road]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 317\u2013319.</ref>\n\nOne major challenge was the approach to the museum. The Japanese team proposed a winding road up the mountain, not unlike the approach to the NCAR building in Colorado. Instead, Pei ordered a hole cut through a nearby mountain, connected to a major road via a bridge suspended from ninety-six steel cables and supported by a post set into the mountain. The museum itself was built into the mountain, with 80&nbsp;percent of the building underground.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 318\u2013320.</ref>\n\nWhen designing the exterior, Pei borrowed from the tradition of Japanese temples, particularly those found in nearby [[Kyoto]]. He created a concise [[Space frame|spaceframe]] wrapped into French limestone and covered with a glass roof. Pei also oversaw specific decorative details, including a bench in the entrance lobby, carved from a 350-year-old ''[[Zelkova serrata|keyaki]]'' tree. Because of Koyama's considerable wealth, money was rarely considered an obstacle; estimates at the time of completion put the cost of the project at US$350&nbsp;million.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 320\u2013322.</ref>\n\nDuring the first decade of the 2000s, Pei designed a variety of buildings, including the [[Suzhou Museum]] near his childhood home.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/09/arts/design/09pei.html |title=I.

Although it was originally planned for the [[corniche]] road along [[Doha Bay]], Pei convinced the project coordinators to build a new island to provide the needed space. He then spent six months touring the region and surveying mosques in Spain, Syria, and Tunisia. He was especially impressed with the elegant simplicity of the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] in [[Cairo]].\n\nOnce again, Pei sought to combine new design elements with the classical aesthetic most appropriate for the location of the building. The sand-colored rectangular boxes rotate evenly to create a subtle movement, with small arched windows at regular intervals into the limestone exterior. Inside, galleries are arranged around a massive atrium, lit from above. The museum's coordinators were pleased with the project; its official website describes its \"true splendour unveiled in the sunlight,\" and speaks of \"the shades of colour and the interplay of shadows paying tribute to the essence of Islamic architecture\".<ref name=\"mia\">[http://www.mia.org.qa/en/about/the-museum-building \"The Architect: Introduction\"].

The building is in a prominent position by the sea and is now a Macau landmark.<ref name=\"peopledaily\" />\n\nPei's career ended with his death in May 2019.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Style and method ==\nPei's style was described as thoroughly modernist, with significant cubist themes.<ref>Wiseman, p. 11; Boehm, pp. 45\u201346.</ref> He was known for combining traditional architectural principles with progressive designs based on simple geometric patterns\u2014circles, squares, and triangles are common elements of his work in both plan and elevation. As one critic wrote: \"Pei has been aptly described as combining a classical sense of form with a contemporary mastery of method.\"<ref>Heyer, p. 309.</ref> In 2000, biographer Carter Wiseman called Pei \"the most distinguished member of his Late-Modernist generation still in practice\".<ref name=\"Wiseman, p. 323\">Wiseman, p. 323.</ref> At the same time, Pei himself rejected simple dichotomies of architectural trends. He once said: \"The talk about modernism versus [[postmodern architecture|post-modernism]] is unimportant. It's a side issue. An individual building, the style in which it is going to be designed and built, is not that important. The important thing, really, is the community. How does it affect life?\"<ref>Quoted in Diamonstein, p. 145.</ref>\n\nPei's work is celebrated throughout the world of architecture. His colleague [[John Portman]] once told him: \"Just once, I'd like to do something like the [[East Building]].\"<ref name=\"WQ215\" /> But this originality did not always bring large financial reward; as Pei replied to the successful architect: \"Just once, I'd like to make the kind of money you do.\"<ref name=\"WQ215\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 215.</ref> His concepts, moreover, were too individualized and dependent on context to have given rise to a particular school of design. Pei referred to his own \"analytical approach\" when explaining the lack of a \"Pei School\".\n\n\"For me,\" he said, \"the important distinction is between a stylistic approach to the design; and an analytical approach giving the process of due consideration to time, place, and purpose&nbsp;... My analytical approach requires a full understanding of the three essential elements&nbsp;... to arrive at an ideal balance among them.\"<ref>Boehm, p. 113.</ref>\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nIn the words of his biographer, Pei won \"every award of any consequence in his art\",<ref name=\"Wiseman, p. 323\" /> including the Arnold Brunner Award from the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]] (1963), the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters Gold Medals|Gold Medal]] for Architecture from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] (1979), the [[AIA Gold Medal]] (1979), the first ''[[Praemium Imperiale]]'' for Architecture from the Japan Art Association (1989), the Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum]], the 1998 [[Edward MacDowell Medal]] in the Arts,<ref>The MacDowell Colony</ref> and the 2010 [[Royal Gold Medal]] from the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]]. In 1983 he was awarded the [[Pritzker Prize]], sometimes referred to as the [[Nobel Prize]] of architecture.

Born in [[Guangzhou]] but raised in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Shanghai]], Pei drew inspiration at an early age from the garden villas at [[Suzhou]], the traditional retreat of the [[scholar-gentry]] to which his family belonged. In 1935, he moved to the United States and enrolled in the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s architecture school, but he quickly transferred to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. He was unhappy with the focus at both schools on [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], and spent his free time researching emerging architects, especially [[Le Corbusier]]. After graduating, he joined the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] (GSD) and became a friend of the [[Bauhaus]] architects [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Marcel Breuer]]. In 1948, Pei was recruited by [[New York City]] real estate magnate [[William Zeckendorf]], for whom he worked for seven years before establishing an independent design firm in 1955, I. M. Pei & Associates. In 1966 that became I. M. Pei & Partners in 1966, and in 1989 became [[Pei Cobb Freed & Partners]]. Pei retired from full-time practice in 1990. In his retirement, he worked as an architectural consultant primarily from his sons' architectural firm [[Pei Partnership Architects]].\n\nPei's first major recognition came with the [[Mesa Laboratory]] at the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] in [[Colorado]] (designed in 1961, and completed in 1967). His new stature led to his selection as chief architect for the [[John F. Kennedy Library]] in Massachusetts. He went on to design [[Dallas City Hall]] and the East Building of the [[National Gallery of Art]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |last1=Goldberger |first1=Paul |title=I.M.

In 1983, he won the [[Pritzker Prize]], which is sometimes referred to as the [[Nobel Prize]] of architecture.\n\n== Childhood ==\n[[File:Shizlinhehuaci.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Men and women stand on curving rock formations overlooking a pond containing flowery plants.|As a child, Pei found the [[Lion Grove Garden|Shizilin Garden]] in [[Suzhou]] to be \"an ideal playground\".<ref name=\"vb18\">Boehm, p. 18.</ref>]]\n\nPei's ancestry traces back to the [[Ming dynasty]], when his family moved from [[Anhui]] province to [[Suzhou]]. The family made their wealth in medicinal herbs, then proceeded to join the ranks of the scholar-gentry, a class which stressed the importance of helping the less fortunate.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 29\u201330; von Boehm, p. 17.</ref> Ieoh Ming Pei was born on 26 April 1917 to Tsuyee and Lien Kwun, and the family moved to [[Hong Kong]] one year later. The family eventually included five children. As a boy, Pei was very close to his mother, a devout [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] who was recognized for her skills as a [[flautist]]. She invited him (and not his brothers or sisters) to join her on meditation retreats.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 31\u201332; von Boehm, p. 25.</ref> His relationship with his father was less intimate. Their interactions were respectful but distant.<ref name=\"Wiseman, p. 31\">Wiseman, p. 31.</ref>\n\nPei's ancestors' success meant that the family lived in the upper echelons of society, but Pei said his father was \"not cultivated in the ways of the arts\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 31.</ref> The younger Pei, drawn more to music and other cultural forms than to his father's domain of banking, explored art on his own. \"I have cultivated myself,\" he said later.<ref name=\"Wiseman, p. 31\" />\n\nWhen Pei was 10, his father received a promotion and relocated with his family to Shanghai. Pei attended St. John's Middle School, run by [[Anglican]] missionaries. Academic discipline was rigorous; students were allowed only one half-day each month for leisure. Pei enjoyed playing [[Cue sports|billiards]] and watching Hollywood movies, especially those of [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]]. He also learned rudimentary English skills by reading the [[Bible]] and novels by [[Charles Dickens]].<ref name=\"w3133\">Wiseman, pp. 31\u201333.</ref>\n\n[[File:Shanghai Bund 2006.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Pedestrians walk before a row of trees and a series of tall buildings. A blue sky overhead is obscured slightly by several clouds.|Pei describes the architecture of Shanghai's [[The Bund (Shanghai)|Bund]] waterfront area (seen here in a 2006 photo) as \"very much a colonial past\".<ref>Boehm, p. 22.</ref>]]\n\nShanghai's many international elements gave it the name \"Paris of the East\".<ref>Boehm, p. 21.</ref> The city's global architectural flavors had a profound influence on Pei, from [[The Bund (Shanghai)|The Bund]] waterfront area to the [[Park Hotel Shanghai|Park Hotel]], built in 1934. He was also impressed by the many gardens of Suzhou, where he spent the summers with extended family and regularly visited a nearby ancestral shrine. The [[Lion Grove Garden|Shizilin Garden]], built in the 14th century by a Buddhist monk and owned by Pei's uncle Bei Runsheng, was especially influential. Its unusual rock formations, stone bridges, and waterfalls remained etched in Pei's memory for decades. He spoke later of his fondness for the garden's blending of natural and human-built structures.<ref name=\"vb18\" /><ref name=\"w3133\" />\n\nSoon after the move to Shanghai, Pei's mother developed cancer. As a pain reliever, she was prescribed [[opium]], and assigned the task of preparing her pipe to Pei. She died shortly after his thirteenth birthday, and he was profoundly upset.<ref>Boehm, p. 25.</ref> The children were sent to live with extended family; their father became more consumed by his work and more physically distant. Pei said: \"My father began living his own separate life pretty soon after that.\"<ref>Boehm, p. 26.</ref>  His father later married a woman named Aileen, who moved to New York later in her life.<ref>Gonzalez, David. \"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E5D91339F93BA15752C1A96E958260 About New York; A Chinese Oasis for the Soul on Staten Island]\". ''[[The New York Times]]''. 28 November 1998. Accessed on 17 January 2011.</ref>\n\n== Education and formative years ==\nAs Pei neared the end of his secondary education, he decided to study at a university. He was accepted in a number of schools, but decided to enroll at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 33\u201334.</ref> Pei's choice had two roots. While studying in Shanghai, he had closely examined the catalogs for various institutions of higher learning around the world. The architectural program at the University of Pennsylvania stood out to him.<ref>Wiseman, p. 34.</ref> The other major factor was Hollywood. Pei was fascinated by the representations of college life in the films of [[Bing Crosby]], which differed tremendously from the academic atmosphere in China. \"College life in the U.S. seemed to me to be mostly fun and games\", he said in 2000. \"Since I was too young to be serious, I wanted to be part of it&nbsp;... You could get a feeling for it in Bing Crosby's movies. College life in America seemed very exciting to me. It's not real, we know that. Nevertheless, at that time it was very attractive to me. I decided that was the country for me.\"<ref>Boehm, p. 34.</ref> Pei added that \"Crosby's films in particular had a tremendous influence on my choosing the United States instead of England to pursue my education.\"<ref>Boehm, pp. 33\u201334.</ref>\n\nIn 1935 Pei boarded a boat and sailed to [[San Francisco]], then traveled by train to [[Philadelphia]]. What he found once he arrived, however, differed vastly from his expectations. Professors at the University of Pennsylvania based their teaching in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts style]], rooted in the classical traditions of [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]]. Pei was more intrigued by [[modern architecture]], and also felt intimidated by the high level of [[Architectural drawing|drafting]] proficiency shown by other students. He decided to abandon architecture and transferred to the engineering program at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT). Once he arrived, however, the dean of the architecture school commented on his eye for design and convinced Pei to return to his original major.<ref>Wiseman, p. 35.</ref>\n\nMIT's architecture faculty was also focused on the Beaux-Arts school, and Pei found himself uninspired by the work. In the library he found three books by the Swiss-French architect [[Le Corbusier]]. Pei was inspired by the innovative designs of the new [[International Style (architecture)|International style]], characterized by simplified form and the use of glass and steel materials. Le Corbusier visited MIT in {{Nowrap|November 1935}}, an occasion which powerfully affected Pei: \"The two days with Le Corbusier, or 'Corbu' as we used to call him, were probably the most important days in my architectural education.\"<ref name=\"vb36\">Boehm, p. 36.</ref> Pei was also influenced by the work of U.S. architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. In 1938 he drove to [[Spring Green, Wisconsin|Spring Green]], [[Wisconsin]], to visit Wright's famous [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] building. After waiting for two hours, however, he left without meeting Wright.<ref name=\"wright\">Boehm, p. 36; Wiseman, p. 36.</ref>\n\nAlthough he disliked the Beaux-Arts emphasis at MIT, Pei excelled in his studies. \"I certainly don't regret the time at MIT\", he said later. \"There I learned the science and technique of building, which is just as essential to architecture.\"<ref name=\"vb40\">Boehm, p. 40.</ref> Pei received his [[Bachelor of Architecture|B.Arch.]] degree in 1940; his thesis was titled \"Standardized Propaganda Units for War Time and Peace Time China\".<ref>Boehm, pp. 40\u201341. Pei believed the term \"propaganda\" to be value-neutral; his advisers disapproved.</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.mit.edu/2019/renowned-architect-mit-alumnus-im-pei-dies-0517|title=Renowned architect I.M.

They began dating and they married in the spring of 1942. She enrolled in the [[landscape architecture]] program at [[Harvard University]], and Pei was thus introduced to members of the faculty at Harvard's [[Harvard Graduate School of Design|Graduate School of Design]] (GSD). He was excited by the lively atmosphere, and joined the GSD in {{Nowrap|December 1942}}.<ref>Wiseman, p. 39; Boehm, pp. 36\u201337.</ref>\n\nLess than a month later, Pei suspended his work at Harvard to join the [[National Defense Research Committee]], which coordinated scientific research into U.S. weapons technology during [[World War&nbsp;II]]. Pei's background in architecture was seen as a considerable asset; one member of the committee told him: \"If you know how to build you should also know how to destroy.\"<ref>Quoted in von Boehm, p. 42; a slightly different wording appears in Wiseman, p. 39: \"If you know how to build a building, you know how to destroy it.\"</ref> The fight against Germany was ending, so he focused on the [[Pacific War]]. The U.S. realized that its bombs used against the stone buildings of Europe would be ineffective against Japanese cities, mostly constructed from wood and paper; Pei was assigned to work on [[incendiary device|incendiary bombs]]. Pei spent two and a half years with the NDRC, but revealed few details of his work.<ref>Boehm, p. 42.</ref>\n\nIn 1945 Eileen gave birth to a son, T'ing Chung; she withdrew from the landscape architecture program in order to care for him. Pei returned to Harvard in the autumn of 1945, and received a position as assistant professor of design. The GSD was developing into a hub of resistance to the Beaux-Arts orthodoxy. At the center were members of the [[Bauhaus]], a European architectural movement that had advanced the cause of modernist design. The [[Nazi regime]] had condemned the Bauhaus school, and its leaders left Germany. Two of these, [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Marcel Breuer]], took positions at the Harvard GSD. Their iconoclastic focus on modern architecture appealed to Pei, and he worked closely with both men.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 41\u201343; Boehm, pp. 37\u201340.</ref>\n\nOne of Pei's design projects at the GSD was a plan for an art museum in Shanghai. He wanted to create a mood of Chinese authenticity in the architecture without using traditional materials or styles.<ref name=\"qw44\">Quoted in Wiseman, p., 44.</ref> The design was based on straight modernist structures, organized around a central courtyard garden, with other similar natural settings arranged nearby. It was very well received; Gropius, in fact, called it \"the best thing done in [my] master class\".<ref name=\"qw44\" /> Pei received his [[Master of Architecture|M.Arch.]] degree in 1946, and taught at Harvard for another two years.<ref name=\"Pei Cobb Freed & Partner\" /><ref>Wiseman, p. 45.</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n=== 1948\u20131956: early career with Webb and Knapp ===\n\nIn the spring of 1948 Pei was recruited by New York real estate magnate [[William Zeckendorf]] to join a staff of architects for his firm of [[Webb and Knapp]] to design buildings around the country. Pei found Zeckendorf's personality the opposite of his own; his new boss was known for his loud speech and gruff demeanor. Nevertheless, they became good friends and Pei found the experience personally enriching. Zeckendorf was well connected politically, and Pei enjoyed learning about the social world of New York's city planners.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 48\u201349.</ref>\n\nHis first project for Webb and Knapp was an apartment building with funding from the [[Housing Act of 1949]]. Pei's design was based on a circular tower with concentric rings. The areas closest to the supporting pillar handled utilities and circulation; the apartments themselves were located toward the outer edge. Zeckendorf loved the design and even showed it off to Le Corbusier when they met. The cost of such an unusual design was too high, however, and the building never moved beyond the model stage.<ref>Wiseman, p. 51.</ref>\n\n[[File:131 Ponce de Leon Ave., Atlanta - I.M. Pei building.JPG|thumb|left|Pei's first project (1949)<br /> [[131 Ponce de Leon Avenue]], Atlanta]]\n\nPei finally saw his architecture come to life in 1949,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcf-p.com/a/f/fme/imp/p/p.html|title=I. M. Pei|website=www.pcf-p.com}}</ref> when he designed a two-story [[131 Ponce de Leon Avenue|corporate building for Gulf Oil]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. The building was demolished in February 2013 although the front facade will be retained as part of an apartment development. His use of marble for the exterior [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]] brought praise from the journal ''Architectural Forum''.<ref>Wiseman, p. 52.</ref> Pei's designs echoed the work of [[Mies van der Rohe]] in the beginning of his career as also shown in his own weekend-house in [[Katonah, New York]] in 1952. Soon Pei was so inundated with projects that he asked Zeckendorf for assistants, which he chose from his associates at the GSD, including [[Henry N. Cobb]] and [[Ulrich Franzen]]. They set to work on a variety of proposals, including the [[Roosevelt Field (Shopping Mall)|Roosevelt Field Shopping Mall]]. The team also redesigned the Webb and Knapp office building, transforming Zeckendorf's office into a circular space with [[teak]] walls and a glass [[clerestory]]. They also installed a control panel into the desk that allowed their boss to control the lighting in his office. The project took one year and exceeded its budget, but Zeckendorf was delighted with the results.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 53\u201354.</ref>\n\n[[File:L'Enfant Plaza - IMG 1926.JPG|thumb|right|Pei wanted the open spaces and buildings of [[L'Enfant Plaza]] to be \"functionally and visually related\" to one another.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 61.</ref>]]\n\nIn 1952 Pei and his team began work on a series of projects in [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]]. The first of these was the Mile High Center, which compressed the core building into less than 25 percent of the total site; the rest is adorned with an exhibition hall and fountain-dotted plazas.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 57\u201358.</ref> One block away, Pei's team also redesigned Denver's Courthouse Square, which combined office spaces, commercial venues, and hotels. These projects helped Pei conceptualize architecture as part of the larger urban geography. \"I learned the process of development,\" he said later, \"and about the city as a living organism.\"<ref name=\"vb52\">Boehm, p. 52.</ref> These lessons, he said, became essential for later projects.<ref name=\"vb52\" />\n\nPei and his team also designed a united urban area for Washington, D.C., called [[L'Enfant Plaza]] (named for French-American architect [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]]).<ref name=\"PeiLenfant\">Williams, 2005, p. 120; Moeller and Weeks, 2006, p. 59.</ref> Pei's associate [[Araldo Cossutta]] was the lead architect for the plaza's North Building (955 L'Enfant Plaza SW) and South Building (490 L'Enfant Plaza SW).<ref name=\"PeiLenfant\" /> [[Vlastimil Koubek]] was the architect for the East Building ([[L'Enfant Plaza Hotel]], located at 480 L'Enfant Plaza SW), and for the Center Building (475 L'Enfant Plaza SW; now the [[United States Postal Service]] headquarters).<ref name=\"PeiLenfant\" /> The team set out with a broad vision that was praised by both ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[Washington Star]]'' (which rarely agreed on anything), but funding problems forced revisions and a significant reduction in scale.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 60\u201362.</ref>\n\nIn 1955 Pei's group took a step toward institutional independence from Webb and Knapp by establishing a new firm called I.&nbsp;M. Pei & Associates. (The name changed later to I.&nbsp;M. Pei & Partners.) They gained the freedom to work with other companies, but continued working primarily with Zeckendorf. The new firm distinguished itself through the use of detailed [[architectural model]]s. They took on the [[Kips Bay]] residential area on the east side of Manhattan, where Pei set up [[Kips Bay Towers]], two large long towers of apartments with recessed windows (to provide shade and privacy) in a neat grid, adorned with rows of trees. Pei involved himself in the construction process at Kips Bay, even inspecting the bags of concrete to check for consistency of color.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 62\u201364.</ref>\n\nThe company continued its urban focus with the [[Society Hill]] project in central [[Philadelphia]]. Pei designed the [[Society Hill Towers]], a three-building residential block injecting cubist design into the 18th-century milieu of the neighborhood. As with previous projects, abundant green spaces were central to Pei's vision, which also added traditional [[townhouse]]s to aid the transition from classical to modern design.<ref>Boehm, p. 51.</ref>\n\nFrom 1958 to 1963 Pei and [[Ray Affleck]] developed a key downtown block of [[Montreal]] in a phased process that involved one of Pei's most admired structures in the Commonwealth, the cruciform tower known as the Royal Bank Plaza ([[Place Ville Marie]]). According to ''[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]'' \"its grand plaza and lower office buildings, designed by internationally famous US architect I. M. Pei, helped to set new standards for architecture in [[Canada]] in the 1960s ... The tower's smooth aluminum and glass surface and crisp unadorned geometric form demonstrate Pei's adherence to the mainstream of 20th-century modern design.\"<ref>The Canadian Encyclopedia online version</ref>\n\nAlthough these projects were satisfying, Pei wanted to establish an independent name for himself. In 1959 he was approached by MIT to design a building for its [[Earth science]] program. The [[Green Building (MIT)|Green Building]] continued the grid design of Kips Bay and Society Hill. The pedestrian walkway at the ground floor, however, was prone to sudden gusts of wind, which embarrassed Pei. \"Here I was from MIT,\" he said, \"and I didn't know about [[wind-tunnel]] effects.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 67.</ref> At the same time, he designed the [[Luce Memorial Chapel]] in at [[Tunghai University]] in [[Taichung]], [[Taiwan]]. The soaring structure, commissioned by the same organisation that had run his middle school in Shanghai, broke severely from the cubist grid patterns of his urban projects.<ref>Wiseman, p. 67.</ref><ref>Wiseman, pp. 66\u201368.</ref>\n\nThe challenge of coordinating these projects took an artistic toll on Pei. He found himself responsible for acquiring new building contracts and supervising the plans for them. As a result, he felt disconnected from the actual creative work. \"Design is something you have to put your hand to,\" he said. \"While my people had the luxury of doing one job at a time, I had to keep track of the whole enterprise.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 69.</ref> Pei's dissatisfaction reached its peak at a time when financial problems began plaguing Zeckendorf's firm. I.&nbsp;M. Pei and Associates officially broke from Webb and Knapp in 1960, which benefited Pei creatively but pained him personally. He had developed a close friendship with Zeckendorf, and both men were sad to part ways.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 69\u201371.</ref>\n\n=== NCAR and related projects ===\n[[File:National Center for Atmospheric Research - Boulder, Colorado.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A series of brown boxlike buildings stand in front of a mountain.|Pei said he wanted the [[Mesa Laboratory]] of the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] to look \"as if it were carved out of the mountain\".<ref name=\"vb60\">Boehm, p. 60.</ref>]]\n\nPei was able to return to hands-on design when he was approached in 1961 by [[Walter Orr Roberts]] to design the new [[Mesa Laboratory]] for the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] outside [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], Colorado. The project differed from Pei's earlier urban work; it would rest in an open area in the foothills of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. He drove with his wife around the region, visiting assorted buildings and surveying the natural environs. He was impressed by the [[United States Air Force Academy]] in Colorado Springs, but felt it was \"detached from nature\".<ref>Boehm, p. 59.</ref>\n\nThe conceptualization stages were important for Pei, presenting a need and an opportunity to break from the Bauhaus tradition. He later recalled the long periods of time he spent in the area: \"I recalled the places I had seen with my mother when I was a little boy\u2014the mountaintop Buddhist retreats. There in the Colorado mountains, I tried to listen to the silence again\u2014just as my mother had taught me. The investigation of the place became a kind of religious experience for me.\"<ref name=\"vb60\" /> Pei also drew inspiration from the [[Mesa Verde National Park|Mesa Verde]] cliff dwellings of the [[Ancestral Puebloans]]; he wanted the buildings to exist in harmony with their natural surroundings.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 75\u201376.</ref> To this end, he called for a rock-treatment process that could color the buildings to match the nearby mountains. He also set the complex back on the mesa overlooking the city, and designed the approaching road to be long, winding, and indirect.<ref>Wiseman, p. 80.</ref>\n\nRoberts disliked Pei's initial designs, referring to them as \"just a bunch of towers\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 79.</ref> Roberts intended his comments as typical of scientific experimentation, rather than artistic critique; still, Pei was frustrated. His second attempt, however, fit Roberts' vision perfectly: a spaced-out series of clustered buildings, joined by lower structures and complemented by two underground levels. The complex uses many elements of [[Cubism|cubist]] design, and the walkways are arranged to increase the probability of casual encounters among colleagues.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 73, 86, and 90; Boehm, p. 61.</ref>\n\n[[File:Palm court 1995.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A grid of palm trees arranged in a tiled courtyard stands to the right of a dormitory building.|As with NCAR, Pei combined elements of cubism and natural harmony when designing the dormitories at [[New College of Florida]] in the mid-1960s.<ref>Wiseman, p. 94.</ref>]]\n\nOnce the laboratory was built, several problems with its construction became apparent. Leaks in the roof caused difficulties for researchers, and the shifting of clay soil beneath caused cracks in the buildings which were expensive to repair. Still, both architect and project manager were pleased with the final result. Pei referred to the NCAR complex as his \"breakout building\", and he remained a friend of Roberts until the scientist died in {{Nowrap|March 1990}}.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 91 and 74.</ref>\n\nThe success of NCAR brought renewed attention to Pei's design acumen. He was recruited to work on a variety of projects, including the [[S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications]] at [[Syracuse University]], the [[Everson Museum of Art]] in [[Syracuse, New York]], the [[Sundrome]] terminal at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in New York City, and dormitories at [[New College of Florida]].<ref>[http://www.ncf.edu/about-us/history History]. 2009. New College of Florida. Retrieved on 12 November 2009.</ref>\n\n=== Kennedy Library ===\n[[File:JFK library Stitch Crop.jpg|thumb|250px|left|alt=A white triangular tower rises beside a black glass building, with circular structures on either side.|Pei considered the [[John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum|John F. Kennedy Library]] \"the most important commission\" in his life.<ref name=\"vb56\">Boehm, p. 56.</ref>]]\n\nAfter President [[John F. Kennedy]] was [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassinated]] in {{Nowrap|November 1963}}, his family and friends discussed how to construct a library that would serve as a fitting memorial. A committee was formed to advise Kennedy's widow [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline]], who would make the final decision. The group deliberated for months and considered many famous architects.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 96\u201398.</ref> Eventually, Kennedy chose Pei to design the library, based on two considerations. First, she appreciated the variety of ideas he had used for earlier projects. \"He didn't seem to have just one way to solve a problem,\" she said. \"He seemed to approach each commission thinking only of it and then develop a way to make something beautiful.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 98.</ref> Ultimately, however, Kennedy made her choice based on her personal connection with Pei. Calling it \"really an emotional decision\", she explained: \"He was so full of promise, like Jack; they were born in the same year. I decided it would be fun to take a great leap with him.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 99.</ref>\n\nThe project was plagued with problems from the outset. The first was scope. President Kennedy had begun considering the structure of his library soon after taking office, and he wanted to include archives from his administration, a museum of personal items, and a political science institute. After the assassination, the list expanded to include a fitting memorial tribute to the slain president. The variety of necessary inclusions complicated the design process and caused significant delays.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 95 and 100.</ref>\n\nPei's first proposed design included a large glass pyramid that would fill the interior with sunlight, meant to represent the optimism and hope that Kennedy's administration had symbolized for so many in the United States. Mrs. Kennedy liked the design, but resistance began in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], the first proposed site for the building, as soon as the project was announced. Many community members worried that the library would become a tourist attraction, causing particular problems with traffic congestion. Others worried that the design would clash with the architectural feel of nearby [[Harvard Square]]. By the mid-70s, Pei tried proposing a new design, but the library's opponents resisted every effort.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 102\u2013113.</ref> These events pained Pei, who had sent all three of his sons to Harvard, and although he rarely discussed his frustration, it was evident to his wife. \"I could tell how tired he was by the way he opened the door at the end of the day,\" she said. \"His footsteps were dragging. It was very hard for I.&nbsp;M. to see that so many people didn't want the building.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 113.</ref>\n\nFinally the project moved to [[Columbia Point (Boston)|Columbia Point]], near the [[University of Massachusetts Boston]]. The new site was less than ideal; it was located on an old landfill, and just over a large sewage pipe. Pei's architectural team added more fill to cover the pipe and developed an elaborate ventilation system to conquer the odor. A new design was unveiled, combining a large square glass-enclosed atrium with a triangular tower and a circular walkway.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 115\u2013116.</ref>\n\nThe [[John F. Kennedy Library|John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum]] was dedicated on 20 October 1979. Critics generally liked the finished building, but the architect himself was unsatisfied. The years of conflict and compromise had changed the nature of the design, and Pei felt that the final result lacked its original passion. \"I wanted to give something very special to the memory of President Kennedy,\" he said in 2000. \"It could and should have been a great project.\"<ref name=\"vb56\" /> Pei's work on the Kennedy project boosted his reputation as an architect of note.<ref>Wiseman, p. 119.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|\"Pei Plan\" in Oklahoma City}}\n\n=== \"Pei Plan\" in Oklahoma City ===\n{{Main|Pei Plan}}\n\nThe Pei Plan was a failed urban redevelopment initiative designed for downtown [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]], Oklahoma, in the 1960s and 1970s. It is the informal name for two related commissions by Pei\u2014namely the Central Business District General Neighborhood Renewal Plan (design completed 1964) and the Central Business District Project I-A Development Plan (design completed 1966). It was formally adopted in 1965, and implemented in various public and private phases throughout the 1960s and 1970s.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe plan called for the demolition of hundreds of old downtown structures in favor of renewed parking, office building, and retail developments, in addition to public projects such as the Myriad Convention Center and the Myriad Botanical Gardens. It was the dominant template for downtown development in Oklahoma City from its inception through the 1970s. The plan generated mixed results and opinion, largely succeeding in re-developing office building and parking infrastructure but failing to attract its anticipated retail and residential development. Significant public resentment also developed as a result of the destruction of multiple historic structures. As a result, Oklahoma City's leadership avoided large-scale urban planning for downtown throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, until the passage of the [[Metropolitan Area Projects Plan|Metropolitan Area Projects]] (MAPS) initiative in 1993.<ref>[http://www.impeiokc.com/history/pei-model-history/ \"Pei Plan and Pei Model History\".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109035740/http://www.impeiokc.com/history/pei-model-history/ |date=9 November 2010 }} IM Pei Oklahoma City.

In 1964 the acting mayor of Dallas, [[J. Erik Jonsson|Erik Jonsson]], began working to change the community's image. Dallas was known and disliked as the city where the president had been killed, but Jonsson began a program designed to initiate a community renewal. One of the goals was a new city hall, which could be a \"symbol of the people\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 123.</ref> Jonsson, a co-founder of [[Texas Instruments]], learned about Pei from his associate [[Cecil Howard Green]], who had recruited the architect for MIT's [[Green Building (MIT)|Earth Sciences building]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 121\u2013123.</ref>\n\nPei's approach to the new [[Dallas City Hall]] mirrored those of other projects; he surveyed the surrounding area and worked to make the building fit. In the case of Dallas, he spent days meeting with residents of the city and was impressed by their civic pride. He also found that the skyscrapers of the downtown business district dominated the skyline, and sought to create a building which could face the tall buildings and represent the importance of the public sector. He spoke of creating \"a public-private dialogue with the commercial high-rises\".<ref>Wiseman, p. 125.</ref>\n\nWorking with his associate Theodore Musho, Pei developed a design centered on a building with a top much wider than the bottom; the facade leans at an angle of 34 degrees, which shades the building from the Texas sun. A plaza stretches out before the building, and a series of support columns holds it up. It was influenced by Le Corbusier's [[Government of Chandigarh|High Court building in Chandigarh]], India; Pei sought to use the significant overhang to unify the building and plaza. The project cost much more than initially expected, and took 11 years to complete. Revenue was secured in part by including a subterranean parking garage. The interior of the city hall is large and spacious; windows in the ceiling above the eighth floor fill the main space with light.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 127\u2013135.</ref>\n\nThe city of Dallas received the building well, and a local television news crew found unanimous approval of the new city hall when it officially opened to the public in 1978. Pei himself considered the project a success, even as he worried about the arrangement of its elements. He said: \"It's perhaps stronger than I would have liked; it's got more strength than finesse.\"<ref name=\"w136\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 136.</ref> He felt that his relative lack of experience left him without the necessary design tools to refine his vision, but the community liked the city hall enough to invite him back. Over the years he went on to design five additional buildings in the Dallas area.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 136\u2013137.</ref>\n\n=== Hancock Tower, Boston ===\n[[File:Plylwood palace.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Two dark buildings rise into the early evening sky. The tower on the right is spotted with plywood on its side.|The disastrous failure of windows on the [[200 Clarendon Street|Hancock Tower]] required replacing them with plywood; some called it \"the world's tallest wood building\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 149.</ref>]]\n\nWhile Pei and Musho were coordinating the Dallas project, their associate [[Henry N. Cobb|Henry Cobb]] had taken the helm for a commission in Boston. [[John Hancock Insurance]] chairman Robert Slater hired I.&nbsp;M. Pei & Partners to design a building that could overshadow the [[Prudential Tower]], erected by [[Prudential Insurance|their rival]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 140 and 145.</ref>\n\nAfter the firm's first plan was discarded due to a need for more office space, Cobb developed a new plan around a towering parallelogram, slanted away from the [[Trinity Church (Boston)|Trinity Church]] and accented by a wedge cut into each narrow side. To minimize the visual impact, the building was covered in large reflective glass panels; Cobb said this would make the building a \"background and foil\" to the older structures around it.<ref>Wiseman, p. 147.</ref> When the [[200 Clarendon Street|Hancock Tower]] was finished in 1976, it was the tallest building in [[New England]].<ref>Wiseman, p. 145.</ref>\n[[File:Johnson-museum-of-art-cornell.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Herbert F. Johnson Museum at Cornell University|Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, Cornell University]]\nSerious issues of execution became evident in the tower almost immediately. Many glass panels fractured in a windstorm during construction in 1973. Some detached and fell to the ground, causing no injuries but sparking concern among Boston residents. In response, the entire tower was reglazed with smaller panels. This significantly increased the cost of the project. Hancock sued the glass manufacturers, Libbey-Owens-Ford, as well as I.&nbsp;M. Pei & Partners, for submitting plans that were \"not good and workmanlike\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 150.</ref> LOF countersued Hancock for defamation, accusing Pei's firm of poor use of their materials; I.&nbsp;M. Pei & Partners sued LOF in return. All three companies settled out of court in 1981.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 149\u2013150.</ref>\n\nThe project became an [[Albatross (metaphor)|albatross]] for Pei's firm. Pei himself refused to discuss it for many years. The pace of new commissions slowed and the firm's architects began looking overseas for opportunities. Cobb worked in [[Australia]] and Pei took on jobs in [[Singapore]], [[Iran]], and [[Kuwait]]. Although it was a difficult time for everyone involved, Pei later reflected with patience on the experience. \"Going through this trial toughened us,\" he said. \"It helped to cement us as partners; we did not give up on each other.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 153.</ref>\n\n=== National Gallery East Building, Washington, DC ===\n\n[[File:National Gallery East Wing by Matthew Bisanz.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A large grey building rises above a stone plaza. Short square towers appear on either side of the building, and an array of irregular glass pyramids are in the middle of the plaza.|''Time'' magazine headlined its review of Pei's design for the East Building \"Masterpiece on the Mall\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 181.</ref>]]\n\nIn the mid-1960s, directors of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], declared the need for a new building. [[Paul Mellon]], a primary benefactor of the gallery and a member of its building committee, set to work with his assistant [[J. Carter Brown]] (who became gallery director in 1969) to find an architect. The new structure would be located to the east of the original building, and tasked with two functions: offer a large space for public appreciation of various popular collections; and house office space as well as archives for scholarship and research. They likened the scope of the new facility to the [[Library of Alexandria]]. After inspecting Pei's work at the [[Des Moines Art Center]] in Iowa and the [[Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art|Johnson Museum]] at [[Cornell University]], they offered him the commission.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 155\u2013161.</ref>\n\nPei took to the project with vigor, and set to work with two young architects he had recently recruited to the firm, [[William Pedersen (architect)|William Pedersen]] and [[Yann Weymouth]]. Their first obstacle was the unusual shape of the building site, a [[trapezoid]] of land at the intersection of [[Constitution Avenue|Constitution]] and [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenues]]. Inspiration struck Pei in 1968, when he scrawled a rough diagram of two triangles on a scrap of paper. The larger building would be the public gallery; the smaller would house offices and archives. This triangular shape became a singular vision for the architect. As the date for groundbreaking approached, Pedersen suggested to his boss that a slightly different approach would make construction easier. Pei simply smiled and said: \"No compromises.\"<ref>Wiseman, pp. 164\u2013165.</ref>\n\nThe growing popularity of art museums presented unique challenges to the architecture. Mellon and Pei both expected large crowds of people to visit the new building, and they planned accordingly. To this end, Pei designed a large lobby roofed with enormous skylights. Individual galleries are located along the periphery, allowing visitors to return after viewing each exhibit to the spacious main room. A large [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobile sculpture]] by American artist [[Alexander Calder]] was later added to the lobby.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 179\u2013180.</ref> Pei hoped the lobby would be exciting to the public in the same way as the central room of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] is in New York City. The modern museum, he said later, \"must pay greater attention to its educational responsibility, especially to the young\".<ref>Boehm, p. 65.</ref>\n\n[[File:Nga fg04.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A large open cement room contains several people on the ground far below a balcony. Several trees are planted in the concrete floor, and an array of clear windows let in sunshine from above.|Critic Richard Hennessy complained in  ''[[Artforum]]'' about the East Building's \"shocking fun-house atmosphere\".<ref name=\"w182\" />]]\n\nMaterials for the building's exterior were chosen with careful precision. To match the look and texture of the original gallery's marble walls, builders re-opened the quarry in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], Tennessee, from which the first batch of stone had been harvested. The project even found and hired Malcolm Rice, a quarry supervisor who had overseen the original 1941 gallery project. The marble was cut into three-inch-thick blocks and arranged over the concrete foundation, with darker blocks at the bottom and lighter blocks on top.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 177\u2013178.</ref>\n\nThe East Building was honored on 30 May 1978, two days before its public unveiling, with a black-tie party attended by celebrities, politicians, benefactors, and artists. When the building opened, popular opinion was enthusiastic. Large crowds visited the new museum, and critics generally voiced their approval. [[Ada Louise Huxtable]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Pei's building was \"a palatial statement of the creative accommodation of contemporary art and architecture\".<ref name=\"w182\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 182.</ref> The sharp angle of the smaller building has been a particular note of praise for the public; over the years it has become stained and worn from the hands of visitors.<ref>Boehm, p. 68.</ref>\n\nSome critics disliked the unusual design, however, and criticized the reliance on triangles throughout the building. Others took issue with the large main lobby, particularly its attempt to lure casual visitors. In his review for ''[[Artforum]]'', critic Richard Hennessy described a \"shocking fun-house atmosphere\" and \"aura of ancient Roman patronage\".<ref name=\"w182\" /> One of the earliest and most vocal critics, however, came to appreciate the new gallery once he saw it in person. [[Allan Greenberg]] had scorned the design when it was first unveiled, but wrote later to [[J. Carter Brown]]: \"I am forced to admit that you are right and I was wrong! The building is a masterpiece.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 183.</ref>\n<!--\nStarting in 2005, the joints attaching the marble panels to the walls began to show signs of strain, creating a risk of panels falling off the building onto the public below.  In 2008 officials decided that it would be necessary to remove and reinstall ''all'' the panels.  The project was scheduled for completion in 2013.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703558004574581890709007568 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=An Ultramodern Building Shows Signs of Age | first=Catesby | last=Leigh | date=8 December 2009}}</ref>\n-->\n\n=== Fragrant Hills, China ===\nAfter U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] made his famous [[1972 Nixon visit to China|1972 visit to China]], a wave of exchanges took place between the two countries. One of these was a delegation of the [[American Institute of Architects]] in 1974, which Pei joined. It was his first trip back to China since leaving in 1935. He was favorably received, returned the welcome with positive comments, and a series of lectures ensued. Pei noted in one lecture that since the 1950s Chinese architects had been content to imitate Western styles; he urged his audience in one lecture to search China's native traditions for inspiration.<ref>Wiseman, p. 189.</ref>\n[[File:Fragrant Hill Hotel.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A white building with ornamented windows faces a lake ringed with rock structures. Trees appear around the structure.|Pei was surprised by public resistance to his traditional design of the hotel at [[Fragrant Hills]] in China. \"Many people thought I was being reactionary,\" he said.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 193.</ref>]]\nIn 1978, Pei was asked to initiate a project for his home country. After surveying a number of different locations, Pei fell in love with a valley that had once served as an imperial garden and hunting preserve known as [[Fragrant Hills]]. The site housed a decrepit hotel; Pei was invited to tear it down and build a new one. As usual, he approached the project by carefully considering the context and purpose. Likewise, he considered modernist styles inappropriate for the setting. Thus, he said, it was necessary to find \"a third way\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 192; Wiseman, pp. 189\u201392.</ref>\n\nAfter visiting his ancestral home in Suzhou, Pei created a design based on some simple but nuanced techniques he admired in traditional residential Chinese buildings. Among these were abundant gardens, integration with nature, and consideration of the relationship between enclosure and opening. Pei's design included a large central atrium covered by glass panels that functioned much like the large central space in his East Building of the National Gallery. Openings of various shapes in walls invited guests to view the natural scenery beyond. Younger Chinese who had hoped the building would exhibit some of Cubist flavor for which Pei had become known were disappointed, but the new hotel found more favour with government officials and architects.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 192\u2013193.</ref>\n\nThe hotel, with 325 guest rooms and a four-story central atrium, was designed to fit perfectly into its natural habitat. The trees in the area were of special concern, and particular care was taken to cut down as few as possible. He worked with an expert from Suzhou to preserve and renovate a water maze from the original hotel, one of only five in the country. Pei was also meticulous about the arrangement of items in the garden behind the hotel; he even insisted on transporting {{convert|230|ST|t}} of rocks from a location in southwest China to suit the natural aesthetic. An associate of Pei's said later that he never saw the architect so involved in a project.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 201\u2013203.</ref>\n\nDuring construction, a series of mistakes collided with the nation's lack of technology to strain relations between architects and builders. Whereas 200&nbsp;or so workers might have been used for a similar building in the US, the Fragrant Hill project employed over 3,000&nbsp;workers. This was mostly because the construction company lacked the sophisticated machines used in other parts of the world. The problems continued for months, until Pei had an uncharacteristically emotional moment during a meeting with Chinese officials. He later explained that his actions included \"shouting and pounding the table\" in frustration.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 205.</ref> The design staff noticed a difference in the manner of work among the crew after the meeting. As the opening neared, however, Pei found the hotel still needed work. He began scrubbing floors with his wife and ordered his children to make beds and vacuum floors. The project's difficulties took an emotional and physical strain on the Pei family.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 204\u2013205.</ref>\n\nThe Fragrant Hill Hotel opened on 17 October 1982 but quickly fell into disrepair. A member of Pei's staff returned for a visit several years later and confirmed the dilapidated condition of the hotel. He and Pei attributed this to the country's general unfamiliarity with deluxe buildings.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 206.</ref> The Chinese architectural community at the time gave the structure little attention, as their interest at the time centered on the work of American [[postmodern architecture|postmodernists]] such as [[Michael Graves]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 206\u2013207.</ref>\n\n=== Javits Convention Center, New York ===\n[[File:Javits Center 11av jeh.JPG|thumb|alt=A building of dark tinted glass stands over a city street. The corners of the building are smoothed at 45-degree angles.|Pei said of the [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center]]: \"The complications exceeded even my expectations.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 211.</ref>]]\n\nAs the Fragrant Hill project neared completion, Pei began work on the [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center]] in New York City, for which his associate [[James Ingo Freed|James Freed]] served as lead designer. Hoping to create a vibrant community institution in what was then a run-down neighborhood on Manhattan's west side, Freed developed a glass-coated structure with an intricate [[space frame]] of interconnected metal rods and spheres.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 211\u2013216.</ref>\n\nThe convention center was plagued from the start by budget problems and construction blunders. City regulations forbid a general contractor having final authority over the project, so architects and program manager Richard Kahan had to coordinate the wide array of builders, plumbers, electricians, and other workers. The forged steel globes to be used in the space frame came to the site with hairline cracks and other defects: 12,000 were rejected. These and other problems led to media comparisons with the disastrous Hancock Tower. One New York City official blamed Kahan for the difficulties, indicating that the building's architectural flourishes were responsible for delays and financial crises.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 222\u2013224.</ref> The Javits Center opened on 3 April 1986, to a generally positive reception. During the inauguration ceremonies, however, neither Freed nor Pei was recognized for their role in the project.\n\n=== Le Grand Louvre, Paris ===\n{{main|Louvre Pyramid}}\n[[File:Paris 75001 Cour Napol\u00e9on Louvre Aile Turgot 02a.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A classical building with ornamental design rises above a small crowd. Rounded archways line the front of the structure.|Pei was acutely aware, as he said, that \"the history of Paris was embedded in the stones of the Louvre.\"<ref name=\"Boehm, p. 84\">Boehm, p. 84.</ref>]]\n\nWhen [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] was elected President of France in 1981, he laid out an ambitious plan for a variety of construction projects. One of these was the renovation of the [[Louvre Museum]]. Mitterrand appointed a civil servant named \u00c9mile Biasini {{ill|\u00c9mile Biasini|fr}} to oversee it. After visiting museums in Europe and the United States, including the U.S. National Gallery, he asked Pei to join the team. The architect made three secretive trips to Paris, to determine the feasibility of the project; only one museum employee knew why he was there.<ref>Wiseman, p. 233; Boehm, p. 77.</ref> Pei finally agreed that a reconstruction project was not only possible, but necessary for the future of the museum. He thus became the first foreign architect to work on the Louvre.<ref>Wiseman, p. 234.</ref>\n\nThe heart of the new design included not only a renovation of the ''Cour Napol\u00e9on'' in the midst of the buildings, but also a transformation of the interiors. Pei proposed a central entrance, not unlike the lobby of the National Gallery East Building, which would link the three major buildings. Below would be a complex of additional floors for research, storage, and maintenance purposes. At the center of the courtyard he designed a [[Louvre Pyramid|glass and steel pyramid]], first proposed with the Kennedy Library, to serve as entrance and anteroom skylight. It was mirrored by [[Pyramide Invers\u00e9e|another inverted pyramid]] underneath, to reflect sunlight into the room. These designs were partly an homage to the fastidious geometry of the famous French landscape architect [[Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre]] (1613\u20131700).<ref>Wiseman, pp. 235\u2013236.</ref> Pei also found the pyramid shape best suited for stable transparency, and considered it \"most compatible with the architecture of the Louvre, especially with the faceted planes of its roofs\".<ref name=\"Boehm, p. 84\" />\n\nBiasini and Mitterrand liked the plans, but the scope of the renovation displeased Louvre director Andr\u00e9 Chabaud. He resigned from his post, complaining that the project was \"unfeasible\" and posed \"architectural risks\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 240.</ref> The public also reacted harshly to the design, mostly because of the proposed pyramid.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 249\u2013250.</ref> One critic called it a \"gigantic, ruinous gadget\";<ref name=\"w249\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 249.</ref> another charged Mitterrand with \"despotism\" for inflicting Paris with the \"atrocity\".<ref name=\"w249\" /> Pei estimated that 90&nbsp;percent of Parisians opposed his design. \"I received many angry glances in the streets of Paris,\" he said.<ref>Boehm, p. 80.</ref> Some condemnations carried [[nationalism|nationalistic]] overtones. One opponent wrote: \"I am surprised that one would go looking for a Chinese architect in America to deal with the historic heart of the capital of France.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 250.</ref>\n\n[[File:Louvre Museum Wikimedia Commons.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A grey pyramid sits in the center of a courtyard, surrounded by ancient buildings.|Pei decided that a pyramid was \"most compatible\" with the other structures at the Louvre, complementing their roofs' faceted planes.<ref name=\"Boehm, p. 84\" />]]\nSoon, however, Pei and his team won the support of several key cultural icons, including the conductor [[Pierre Boulez]] and [[Claude Pompidou]], widow of former French President [[Georges Pompidou]], after whom [[Centre Georges Pompidou|another controversial museum]] was named. In an attempt to soothe public ire, Pei took a suggestion from then-mayor of Paris [[Jacques Chirac]] and placed a full-sized cable model of the pyramid in the courtyard. During the four days of its exhibition, an estimated 60,000&nbsp;people visited the site. Some critics eased their opposition after witnessing the proposed scale of the pyramid.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 251\u2013252.</ref>\n\nTo minimize the impact of the structure, Pei demanded a method of glass production that resulted in clear panes. The pyramid was constructed at the same time as the subterranean levels below, which caused difficulties during the building stages.

At the age of 72, Pei had begun thinking about retirement, but continued working long hours to see his designs come to light.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 263\u2013264.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dallas Meyerson Center 02.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A beige cube rises at an angle around a half-cone made of glass and steel. In front, a square archway overlooks a stone courtyard.|Although he usually designed entirely by hand, Pei used a computer to \"confirm the spaces\" for the [[Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center]] in [[Dallas]].<ref>Wiseman, p. 272.</ref>]]\nOne of the projects took Pei back to Dallas, Texas, to design the [[Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center]]. The success of city's performing artists, particularly the [[Dallas Symphony Orchestra]] then led by conductor [[Eduardo Mata]], led to interest by city leaders in creating a modern center for musical arts that could rival the best halls in [[Europe]]. The organizing committee contacted 45&nbsp;architects, but at first Pei did not respond, thinking that his work on the Dallas City Hall had left a negative impression. One of his colleagues from that project, however, insisted that he meet with the committee. He did and, although it would be his first concert hall, the committee voted unanimously to offer him the commission. As one member put it: \"We were convinced that we would get the world's greatest architect putting his best foot forward.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 267.</ref>\n\nThe project presented a variety of specific challenges. Because its main purpose was the presentation of live music, the hall needed a design focused on [[acoustics]] first, then public access and exterior aesthetics. To this end, a professional sound technician was hired to design the interior. He proposed a [[Shoebox style (architecture)|shoebox]] auditorium, used in the acclaimed designs of top European symphony halls such as the [[Concertgebouw|Amsterdam Concertgebouw]] and [[Musikverein|Vienna Musikverein]]. Pei drew inspiration for his adjustments from the designs of the German architect [[Johann Balthasar Neumann]], especially the [[Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers]]. He also sought to incorporate some of the panache of the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Op\u00e9ra]] designed by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 269\u2013270.</ref>\n\nPei's design placed the rigid shoebox at an angle to the surrounding street grid, connected at the north end to a long rectangular office building, and cut through the middle with an assortment of circles and cones. The design attempted to reproduce with modern features the acoustic and visual functions of traditional elements like [[filigree]]. The project was risky: its goals were ambitious and any unforeseen acoustic flaws would be virtually impossible to remedy after the hall's completion. Pei admitted that he did not completely know how everything would come together. \"I can imagine only 60&nbsp;percent of the space in this building,\" he said during the early stages. \"The rest will be as surprising to me as to everyone else.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 272.</ref> As the project developed, costs rose steadily and some sponsors considered withdrawing their support. Billionaire tycoon [[Ross Perot]] made a donation of US$10&nbsp;million, on the condition that it be named in honor of Morton H. Meyerson, the longtime patron of the arts in Dallas.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 273\u2013274.</ref>\n\nThe building opened and immediately garnered widespread praise, especially for its acoustics. After attending a week of performances in the hall, a music critic for ''The New York Times'' wrote an enthusiastic account of the experience and congratulated the architects. One of Pei's associates told him during a party before the opening that the symphony hall was \"a very mature building\"; he smiled and replied: \"Ah, but did I have to wait this long?\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 286.</ref>\n\n=== Bank of China, Hong Kong ===\n\nA new offer had arrived for Pei from the Chinese government in 1982. With an eye toward the [[transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong]] from the British in 1997, authorities in China sought Pei's aid on a new tower for the local branch of the [[Bank of China]]. The Chinese government was preparing for a new wave of engagement with the outside world and sought a tower to represent modernity and economic strength. Given the elder Pei's history with the bank before the Communist takeover, government officials visited the 89-year-old man in New York to gain approval for his son's involvement. Pei then spoke with his father at length about the proposal. Although the architect remained pained by his experience with Fragrant Hills, he agreed to accept the commission.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 286\u2013287.</ref>\n\nThe proposed site in Hong Kong's [[Central, Hong Kong|Central District]] was less than ideal; a tangle of highways lined it on three sides. The area had also been home to a headquarters for Japanese military police during World War&nbsp;II, and was notorious for prisoner torture. The small parcel of land made a tall tower necessary, and Pei had usually shied away from such projects; in Hong Kong especially, the skyscrapers lacked any real architectural character. Lacking inspiration and unsure of how to approach the building, Pei took a weekend vacation to the family home in [[Katonah, New York|Katonah]], New York. There he found himself experimenting with a bundle of sticks until he happened upon a cascading sequence.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 287\u2013288.</ref>\n\nPei felt that his design for the [[Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong|Bank of China Tower]] needed to reflect \"the aspirations of the Chinese people\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 288.</ref>  The design that he developed for the skyscraper was not only unique in appearance, but also sound enough to pass the city's rigorous standards for wind-resistance. The building is composed of four triangular shafts rising up from a square base, supported by a visible [[truss]] structure that distributes stress to the four corners of the base. Using the reflective glass that had become something of a trademark for him, Pei organized the facade around  diagonal bracing in a union of structure and form that reiterates the triangle motif established in the plan. At the top, he designed the roofs at sloping angles to match the rising aesthetic of the building. Some influential advocates of ''[[feng shui]]'' in Hong Kong and China criticized the design, and Pei and government officials responded with token adjustments.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 289\u2013291.</ref>\n\nAs the tower neared completion, Pei was shocked to witness the government's massacre of unarmed civilians at the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. He wrote an opinion piece for ''The New York Times'' titled \"China Won't Ever Be the Same,\" in which he said that the killings \"tore the heart out of a generation that carries the hope for the future of the country\".<ref name=\"WQ294\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 294.</ref> The massacre deeply disturbed his entire family, and he wrote that \"China is besmirched.\"<ref name=\"WQ294\" />\n\n=== 1990\u20132019: museum projects ===\n[[File:Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A grey tiled building rises over a lake, with a cylinder set on a narrow pole, and a sloping glass wall on one end.|One staff member sympathized with Pei's frustrations with the lack of organization at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], admitting that he was \"operating in a vacuum\".<ref name=\"WQ307\" />]]\n\nAs the 1990s began, Pei transitioned into a role of decreased involvement with his firm. The staff had begun to shrink, and Pei wanted to dedicate himself to smaller projects allowing for more creativity. Before he made this change, however, he set to work on his last major project as active partner: the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. Considering his work on such bastions of [[high culture]] as the Louvre and U.S. National Gallery, some critics were surprised by his association with what many considered a tribute to [[low culture]]. The sponsors of the hall, however, sought Pei for specifically this reason; they wanted the building to have an aura of respectability from the beginning. As in the past, Pei accepted the commission in part because of the unique challenge it presented.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 303\u2013306.</ref>\n\nUsing a glass wall for the entrance, similar in appearance to his Louvre pyramid, Pei coated the exterior of the main building in white metal, and placed a large cylinder on a narrow perch to serve as a performance space. The combination of off-centered wraparounds and angled walls was, Pei said, designed to provide \"a sense of tumultuous youthful energy, rebelling, flailing about\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 306.</ref>\n\nThe building opened in 1995, and was received with moderate praise. ''The New York Times'' called it \"a fine building\", but Pei was among those who felt disappointed with the results. The museum's early beginnings in New York combined with an unclear mission created a fuzzy understanding among project leaders for precisely what was needed.<ref name=\"WQ307\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 307.</ref> Although the city of Cleveland benefited greatly from the new tourist attraction, Pei was unhappy with it.<ref name=\"WQ307\" />\n\nAt the same time, Pei designed a new museum for [[Luxembourg]], the ''Mus\u00e9e d'art moderne Grand-Duc Jean'', commonly known as the [[Mudam]]. Drawing from the original shape of the [[Fort Th\u00fcngen]] walls where the museum was located, Pei planned to remove a portion of the original foundation. Public resistance to the historical loss forced a revision of his plan, however, and the project was nearly abandoned. The size of the building was halved, and it was set back from the original wall segments to preserve the foundation. Pei was disappointed with the alterations, but remained involved in the building process even during construction.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 311\u2013313.</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Pei was hired to design an extension to the ''[[Deutsches Historisches Museum]]'', or German Historical Museum in Berlin. Returning to the challenge of the East Building of the U.S. National Gallery, Pei worked to combine a [[Modernism|modernist]] approach with a classical main structure. He described the glass cylinder addition as a \"beacon,\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 315.</ref> and topped it with a glass roof to allow plentiful sunlight inside. Pei had difficulty working with German government officials on the project; their utilitarian approach clashed with his passion for aesthetics. \"They thought I was nothing but trouble\", he said.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 316.</ref>\n\nPei also worked at this time on two projects for a [[Japanese new religions|new Japanese religious movement]] called ''[[Shinji Shumeikai]]''. He was approached by the movement's spiritual leader, Kaishu Koyama, who impressed the architect with her sincerity and willingness to give him significant artistic freedom. One of the buildings was a bell tower, designed to resemble the ''[[bachi]]'' used when playing traditional instruments like the ''[[shamisen]]''. Pei was unfamiliar with the movement's beliefs, but explored them in order to represent something meaningful in the tower. As he said: \"It was a search for the sort of expression that is not at all technical.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 300.</ref>\n\n[[File:Miho museum02n3872.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A curving circular tunnel opens to reveal a building with a tall sloping roof and a circular window in the front door.|Pei's tunnel through a mountain leading to the [[Miho Museum]] was partly inspired by a story from fourth-century Chinese poet [[Tao Yuanming]].<ref>Boehm, pp. 99\u2013100.</ref>]]\nThe experience was rewarding for Pei, and he agreed immediately to work with the group again. The new project was the [[Miho Museum]], to display Koyama's collection of [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] artifacts. Pei visited the site in [[Shiga Prefecture]], and during their conversations convinced Koyama to expand her collection. She conducted a global search and acquired more than 300&nbsp;items showcasing the history of the [[Silk Road]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 317\u2013319.</ref>\n\nOne major challenge was the approach to the museum. The Japanese team proposed a winding road up the mountain, not unlike the approach to the NCAR building in Colorado. Instead, Pei ordered a hole cut through a nearby mountain, connected to a major road via a bridge suspended from ninety-six steel cables and supported by a post set into the mountain. The museum itself was built into the mountain, with 80&nbsp;percent of the building underground.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 318\u2013320.</ref>\n\nWhen designing the exterior, Pei borrowed from the tradition of Japanese temples, particularly those found in nearby [[Kyoto]]. He created a concise [[Space frame|spaceframe]] wrapped into French limestone and covered with a glass roof. Pei also oversaw specific decorative details, including a bench in the entrance lobby, carved from a 350-year-old ''[[Zelkova serrata|keyaki]]'' tree. Because of Koyama's considerable wealth, money was rarely considered an obstacle; estimates at the time of completion put the cost of the project at US$350&nbsp;million.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 320\u2013322.</ref>\n\nDuring the first decade of the 2000s, Pei designed a variety of buildings, including the [[Suzhou Museum]] near his childhood home.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/09/arts/design/09pei.html |title=I.

Although it was originally planned for the [[corniche]] road along [[Doha Bay]], Pei convinced the project coordinators to build a new island to provide the needed space. He then spent six months touring the region and surveying mosques in Spain, Syria, and Tunisia. He was especially impressed with the elegant simplicity of the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] in [[Cairo]].\n\nOnce again, Pei sought to combine new design elements with the classical aesthetic most appropriate for the location of the building. The sand-colored rectangular boxes rotate evenly to create a subtle movement, with small arched windows at regular intervals into the limestone exterior. Inside, galleries are arranged around a massive atrium, lit from above. The museum's coordinators were pleased with the project; its official website describes its \"true splendour unveiled in the sunlight,\" and speaks of \"the shades of colour and the interplay of shadows paying tribute to the essence of Islamic architecture\".<ref name=\"mia\">[http://www.mia.org.qa/en/about/the-museum-building \"The Architect: Introduction\"].

As one critic wrote: \"Pei has been aptly described as combining a classical sense of form with a contemporary mastery of method.\"<ref>Heyer, p. 309.</ref> In 2000, biographer Carter Wiseman called Pei \"the most distinguished member of his Late-Modernist generation still in practice\".<ref name=\"Wiseman, p. 323\">Wiseman, p. 323.</ref> At the same time, Pei himself rejected simple dichotomies of architectural trends. He once said: \"The talk about modernism versus [[postmodern architecture|post-modernism]] is unimportant. It's a side issue. An individual building, the style in which it is going to be designed and built, is not that important. The important thing, really, is the community. How does it affect life?\"<ref>Quoted in Diamonstein, p. 145.</ref>\n\nPei's work is celebrated throughout the world of architecture. His colleague [[John Portman]] once told him: \"Just once, I'd like to do something like the [[East Building]].\"<ref name=\"WQ215\" /> But this originality did not always bring large financial reward; as Pei replied to the successful architect: \"Just once, I'd like to make the kind of money you do.\"<ref name=\"WQ215\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 215.</ref> His concepts, moreover, were too individualized and dependent on context to have given rise to a particular school of design. Pei referred to his own \"analytical approach\" when explaining the lack of a \"Pei School\".\n\n\"For me,\" he said, \"the important distinction is between a stylistic approach to the design; and an analytical approach giving the process of due consideration to time, place, and purpose&nbsp;...
