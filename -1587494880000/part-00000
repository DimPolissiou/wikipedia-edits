The demonstration of some 350,000 Moroccans advanced several kilometres into the Western Sahara territory, escorted by nearly 20,000 Moroccan troops, and meeting very little response from the [[Sahrawi people|Sahrawi]] [[Polisario Front]]. Nevertheless, the events quickly escalated into a fully waged war between Morocco and the militias of the Polisario, the [[Western Sahara War]], which would last for 16 years. Morocco later gained control over most of the former Spanish Sahara, which it continues to hold.\n\n==Background==\n{{further|Greater Morocco}}\n{{Sahara conflict}}\n{{History of Morocco}}\n\nMorocco, to the north of the Spanish Sahara, had long claimed that the territory was historically an integral part of Morocco.

Since 1973, a Sahrawi [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] led by the Polisario Front (armed and financed by Algiers) had challenged Spanish control, and in October 1975 Spain had quietly begun negotiations for a handover of power with leaders of the rebel movement, both in [[El Aai\u00fan]], and with foreign minister [[Pedro Cortina y Mauri]] meeting [[El Ouali]] in [[Algiers]].<ref>{{cite journal| first= Jacob |last= Mundy| title= Neutrality or Complicity?

Instead, the court argued, the indigenous population (the Sahrawis) were the owners of the land, and thus possessed the right of [[self-determination]]. This meant that regardless of which political solution was found to the question of sovereignty (integration with Spain, Morocco, Mauritania, partition, or independence), it had to be explicitly approved by the people of the territory. Complicating matters, a [[United Nations visiting mission to Spanish Sahara|UN visiting mission]] had concluded on 15 October, the day before the ICJ verdict was released, that Sahrawi support for independence was \"overwhelming\".\n\nHowever, the reference to previous Moroccan-Sahrawi ties of allegiance was presented by Hassan II as a vindication of his position, with no public mention of the court's further ruling on self-determination. (Seven years later, he formally agreed to a referendum before the [[Organisation of African Unity]]). Within hours of the ICJ verdict's release, he announced the organizing of a \"green march\" to Spanish Sahara, to \"[[Greater Morocco|reunite it with the Motherland]]\".\n\nIn order to prepare the terrain and to riposte to any potential counter-invasion from [[Algeria]] (interested by the access to the Atlantic and the potential gas resources) or in order to invade militarily the land and kill or deport the Sahrawi population (according to the [[Polisario Front]]), the [[Moroccan Army]] entered the northeast of the region on October 31, where it met with hard resistance from the [[Polisario]], by then a two-year-old independence movement.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://mondediplo.com/2006/01/12asahara |title= How the US and Morocco seized the Spanish Sahara| first= Jacob |last= Mundy| date= January 2006 | website= mondediplo.com}}</ref>\n\n==The Green March==\n[[File:100 dirham back.jpg|thumb|left|A 100 [[Moroccan dirham|dirham]] note from 1991 commemorating the Green March]]\n\nThe Green March was a well-publicized popular march of enormous proportions.

The ''[[caudillo]]'' General [[Francisco Franco|Franco]], who had led the country for 36 years, was dying. Despite the overwhelming military and logistic superiority of the Spanish armed forces based in Western Sahara in relation to the Moroccan armed forces, the Spanish government feared that the conflict with Morocco could lead to an open colonial war in Africa, which could put [[Francoist Spain]] into question and lead to an abrupt political change or a social instability and disaster. The Spanish government, directed by Prince [[Juan Carlos I|Juan Carlos]], who was acting Head of State in substitution of General Franco, and the incumbent Prime Minister Don Carlos [[Arias Navarro]], was in no mood for troubles in the colony. Only the year before, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|government]] had been [[Carnation Revolution|toppled by the Portuguese armed forces]] after becoming bogged down in colonial wars in [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]]. Therefore, following the Green March, and with a view to avoid war and preserving as much as possible of its interest in the territory, Spain agreed to enter direct bilateral negotiations with Morocco, bringing in also Mauritania, who had made similar demands. Under pressure from Morocco, Spain also agreed that no representatives of the native population would be present in the negotiations that resulted in the 14 November [[Madrid Accords]]. This was a treaty which divided Spanish Sahara between Mauritania and Morocco.<ref>Trilateral Agreement concluded exclusively between the Spanish, Moroccan and Mauritanian Governments, the text of which has been transmitted to the Secretary General of the UN on November 18, 1975.

Morocco and Mauritania then formally annexed the parts they had been allotted in the Accords. Morocco claimed the northern part, i.e. [[Saguia el-Hamra]] and approximately half of [[R\u00edo de Oro]], while Mauritania proceeded to occupy the southern third of the country under the name [[Tiris al-Gharbiyya]]. Mauritania later abandoned all claims to its portion in August 1979 and ceded this area to Popular Army of Saharwi Liberation (Polisario), but it was instead promptly occupied by Morocco. Nevertheless, Mauritania preserved for itself a small area called [[Ras Nouadhibou]] to preserve the security of its capital [[Nouakchott]].\n\nThe Polisario, now with heavy [[Algeria]]n backing, refused the Madrid Accords, and demanded that the ICJ's opinion on Sahrawi [[self-determination]] be respected; it turned its weapons on the new rulers of the country, sticking to its demand for independence outright, or a referendum on the matter. The conflict has still not been resolved. Currently, there is a [[cease-fire]] in effect, after a Moroccan-Polisario [[Settlement Plan|agreement]] was struck in 1991 to solve the dispute through the organization of a [[referendum]] on independence. A UN peace-keeping mission ([[United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara|MINURSO]]) has been charged with overseeing the cease-fire and organizating the referendum, which has still not taken place {{As of|2019|lc=on}}. Morocco has rejected the idea of the referendum as not workable in 2000 and is suggesting an [[autonomy for Western Sahara]] within Morocco. That proposal been rejected by Spain, the Polisario, and also by its Algerian backers; it was presented to the UN in April 2007.\n\nSpain is divided between its desire to preserve a good relation with Morocco, its Southern neighbour with whom it shares terrestrial [[Morocco\u2013Spain border|borders]] in [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]], and its responsibility to the international legality as the former colonial power. The traditional position of all the Spanish democratic governments until the arrival of Prime Minister [[Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero|Zapatero]] to the Government, had been that the wishes of the Saharian population have to be respected, and of support to the organization of the referendum requested by the United Nations. According to the US Department of State's documents leaked by Wikileaks, Spain, under Zapatero, has changed its traditional position concerning the organisation of the referendum for the Sahara, and now supports the Moroccan position. The documents also stated that Spain had been trying to broker an agreement between the two parties. However, in her speech to the Spanish Parliament of 15 December 2010, the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Trinidad Jimenez]] denied that Spain supports the Moroccan position in Spanish Sahara. She also argued that Spain will support any agreement between the Polisario and Morocco.\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Western Sahara]]\n* [[List of Spanish colonial wars in Morocco]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Western Sahara conflict]]\n[[Category:November]]\n[[Category:Marching]]\n[[Category:1975 in Spanish Sahara]]\n[[Category:Morocco\u2013Spain relations]]\n[[Category:Settlement schemes]]\n[[Category:1975 in Morocco]]\n[[Category:Politically motivated migrations]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the historical event|the aerobatic team|Marche Verte}}\n{{short description|Event}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| battle_name = ''Green march''\n| image = Gr\u00fcner Marsch Karte.png\n| caption = Marches of November 7 (in green) and military action of October 31 (in red)\n| conflict = Hispanic-Moroccan conflicts\n| date = 6 November 1975\n| place = [[Spanish Sahara]]\n| casus = Moroccan invasion of the territory\n| result = [[Madrid Accords|Madrid Agreements]]\n| territory = Spain leaves territory\n| combatant1 = {{flagcountry | Francoist Spain | 1945}}\n| combatant2 = {{MAR}}\n'''International support'''\n* {{USA}} {{Sfn | Boukhari | 2004}}\n* {{FRA}} {{Sfn | Boukhari | 2004}}\n| commander1 = {{flagicon image |Estandarte del infante Juan Carlos de Borb\u00f3n como Pr\u00edncipe de Espa\u00f1a.svg}} [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos de Borb\u00f3n]]\n| commander2 = {{flagicon image | Royal standard of Morocco.svg}} [[Hassan II of Morocco|Hasan II]]\n| units1 = Units of [[Regular army|Nomadic Troops]]\nLight cavalry groups of the Third and Fourth Thirds of the [[Spanish Legion|Legion]] <ref name = \"Meneses\" />\nExpeditionary battalion of the Canary Infantry Regiment 50\n| units2 = [[Royal Moroccan Army|Royal Armed Forces]]\n| strength1 = 5000 [[Spanish Legion|legionaries]]\n| strength2 = 350,000 civilians <br /> 25,000 soldiers\n| casualties1 =\n| casualties2 =\n| injured1 =\n| injured2 =\n| campaign = Hispanic-Moroccan conflicts\n}}\n{{Campaignbox Spanish colonial wars in Morocco}}\n\nThe '''Green March''' was a strategic mass demonstration in November 1975, coordinated by the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] government, to force [[Spain]] to hand over the disputed, autonomous semi-metropolitan province of [[Spanish Sahara]] to Morocco.

Therefore, following the Green March, and with a view to avoid war and preserving as much as possible of its interest in the territory, Spain agreed to enter direct bilateral negotiations with Morocco, bringing in also Mauritania, who had made similar demands. Under pressure from Morocco, Spain also agreed that no representatives of the native population would be present in the negotiations that resulted in the 14 November [[Madrid Accords]]. This was a treaty which divided Spanish Sahara between Mauritania and Morocco.<ref>Trilateral Agreement concluded exclusively between the Spanish, Moroccan and Mauritanian Governments, the text of which has been transmitted to the Secretary General of the UN on November 18, 1975. (Resolution 3458 (XXX) B. 10/12/1975).</ref> In the agreements Spain agreed to cede the possession of the colony to Morocco and Mauritania, under the condition, expressed in point 3 of the Trilateral Agreement, that the views of the Saharan population had to be respected.\n\nSpain received a 35% concession in the [[phosphate]] mines of [[Bou Craa]] and offshore fishing rights<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.arso.org/CLAIHR.htm |website= arso.org | author= Canadian Lawyers Association for International Human Rights | year= 1997| title= Western Sahara Initiative| publisher= Support Association to a free and fair referendum in Western Sahara| accessdate= 21 April 2015}}</ref> that were not respected by Morocco. Morocco and Mauritania then formally annexed the parts they had been allotted in the Accords. Morocco claimed the northern part, i.e. [[Saguia el-Hamra]] and approximately half of [[R\u00edo de Oro]], while Mauritania proceeded to occupy the southern third of the country under the name [[Tiris al-Gharbiyya]]. Mauritania later abandoned all claims to its portion in August 1979 and ceded this area to Popular Army of Saharwi Liberation (Polisario), but it was instead promptly occupied by Morocco. Nevertheless, Mauritania preserved for itself a small area called [[Ras Nouadhibou]] to preserve the security of its capital [[Nouakchott]].\n\nThe Polisario, now with heavy [[Algeria]]n backing, refused the Madrid Accords, and demanded that the ICJ's opinion on Sahrawi [[self-determination]] be respected; it turned its weapons on the new rulers of the country, sticking to its demand for independence outright, or a referendum on the matter. The conflict has still not been resolved. Currently, there is a [[cease-fire]] in effect, after a Moroccan-Polisario [[Settlement Plan|agreement]] was struck in 1991 to solve the dispute through the organization of a [[referendum]] on independence. A UN peace-keeping mission ([[United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara|MINURSO]]) has been charged with overseeing the cease-fire and organizating the referendum, which has still not taken place {{As of|2019|lc=on}}. Morocco has rejected the idea of the referendum as not workable in 2000 and is suggesting an [[autonomy for Western Sahara]] within Morocco. That proposal been rejected by Spain, the Polisario, and also by its Algerian backers; it was presented to the UN in April 2007.\n\nSpain is divided between its desire to preserve a good relation with Morocco, its Southern neighbour with whom it shares terrestrial [[Morocco\u2013Spain border|borders]] in [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]], and its responsibility to the international legality as the former colonial power. The traditional position of all the Spanish democratic governments until the arrival of Prime Minister [[Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero|Zapatero]] to the Government, had been that the wishes of the Saharian population have to be respected, and of support to the organization of the referendum requested by the United Nations. According to the US Department of State's documents leaked by Wikileaks, Spain, under Zapatero, has changed its traditional position concerning the organisation of the referendum for the Sahara, and now supports the Moroccan position. The documents also stated that Spain had been trying to broker an agreement between the two parties. However, in her speech to the Spanish Parliament of 15 December 2010, the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Trinidad Jimenez]] denied that Spain supports the Moroccan position in Spanish Sahara. She also argued that Spain will support any agreement between the Polisario and Morocco.\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Western Sahara]]\n* [[List of Spanish colonial wars in Morocco]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Western Sahara conflict]]\n[[Category:November]]\n[[Category:Marching]]\n[[Category:1975 in Spanish Sahara]]\n[[Category:Morocco\u2013Spain relations]]\n[[Category:Settlement schemes]]\n[[Category:1975 in Morocco]]\n[[Category:Politically motivated migrations]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toSahrawi(link changed toSahrawi people) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_March"}
