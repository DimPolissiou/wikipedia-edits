He was related to the [[counts of Tusculum]], a powerful Roman family which had dominated papal politics for over half a century. He became pope in his late teenage years or early twenties. In 960, he clashed with the [[Lombards]] to the south. Unable to control Rome easily, he sought help from King [[Otto I of Germany]] and [[coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|crowned him emperor]].

His mother is believed to have been Alda of Vienne, Alberic's stepsister and the daughter of King [[Hugh of Italy]]. However, there is some doubt about this. [[Benedict of Soracte]] recorded that Octavianus was the son of a concubine (''Genuit (Alberic) ex his principem ex concubinam filium, imposuit eis nomen Octabianus''), but his [[Latin]] is unclear.

Right from the start, in relation to secular issues, the new pope issued his directives under the name of Octavian, while in all matters relating to the Church, he issued papal bulls and other material under his pontifical name of John.{{sfn|Norwich|2011|p=76}}{{sfn|Mann|1910|p=245}}\n\n==Early reign==\nIn around 960, John personally led an attack against the [[Lombards|Lombard]] duchies of [[Duchy of Benevento|Beneventum]] and [[Principality of Capua|Capua]], presumably to reclaim parts of the [[Papal States]] which had been lost to them. Confronted by the sight of John marching at the head of an army of men from [[Tusculum]] and [[Spoleto]], the dukes of Beneventum and Capua appealed for help from [[Gisulf I of Salerno]], who came to their aid.{{sfn|Gregorovius|1895|p=330}} John retreated north and entered into negotiations with Gisulf at [[Terracina]]. A treaty was secured between the two parties, and the price for Gisulf's non-interference was John agreeing that the papacy would no longer claim [[Salerno]] as a [[Papal patrimony]].{{sfn|Mann|1910|pp= 246\u2013247}}\n\nJohn soon found that he was unable to control the powerful Roman nobility as his father had so effortlessly done.{{sfn|Gregorovius|1895|p=331}} At around the same time, King [[Berengar II of Italy]] began to attack the territory of the pope. In order to protect himself against political intrigues in Rome and the power of Berengar II, John sent papal legates in 960 to King [[Otto I of Germany]], who had previously been granted the rank of [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]], asking for his aid.{{sfn|Mann|1910|p=247}} Agreeing to John's invitation, Otto entered Italy in 961. Berengar quickly retreated to his strongholds, and Otto proceeded to enter Rome on 31 January 962. There he met with John and proceeded to swear under oath that he would do everything to defend the pope:\n{{quote|To thee, the Lord Pope John, I, King Otto, promise and swear, by the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, by the wood of the life-giving cross, and by these relics of the saints, that, if by the will of God I come to Rome, I will exalt to the best of my ability the Holy Roman Church and you its ruler; and never with my will or at my instigation shall you lose life or limb or the honour which you possess. And without your consent never, within the city of Rome, will I hold a ''[[placitum]]'' (plea) or make any regulation which affects you or the Romans. Whatever territory of St. Peter comes within my grasp, I will give up to you. And to whomsoever I shall entrust the kingdom of Italy, I will make him swear to help you as far as he can to defend the lands of St. Peter.{{sfn|Mann|1910|p=248}}{{sfn|Gregorovius|1895|pp=332\u2013333}}}}\n\nJohn then proceeded to crown Otto as [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperor]], the first in the west since the death of [[Berengar I of Italy]] almost 40 years before. The pope and the Roman nobility swore an oath over the buried remains of [[Saint Peter]] to be faithful to Otto, and not to provide aid to Berengar II or his son [[Adalbert of Italy|Adalbert]].{{sfn|Mann|1910|p=250}} Eleven days later, the pope and emperor ratified the ''[[Diploma Ottonianum]]'', under which the emperor became the guarantor of the independence of the [[Papal States]], which ran from [[Naples]] and [[Capua]] in the south to [[La Spezia]] and [[Venice]] in the north. This was the first effective guarantee of such protection since the collapse of the [[Carolingian Empire]] nearly 100 years before. He also confirmed the freedom of papal elections, but retained the imperial right to agree to the election before the papal consecration, whilst at the same time retaining the clauses of the [[Constitutio Romana]] which restricted temporal papal power.{{sfn|Mann|1910|p=252}}{{sfn|Gregorovius|1895|p=338}}\n\n==Church affairs==\n[[File:Coins of Pope John XII.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Coins of John XII]]\nAlthough Pope John XII was condemned for his worldly ways, he still managed to devote some time towards church affairs. In early 956 he wrote to William of [[Mainz|Mayence]], the [[papal legate]] in [[Germany]], urging him to continue in his work there, especially against those who would \u201cdevastate the churches of God\u201d. He asked William to inform him of the goings on both in [[West Francia]] and Germany. John also wrote to [[Henry I (Archbishop of Trier)|Henry]], the new [[archbishop of Trier]], granting him the [[pallium]] and encouraging him to lead a good life.{{sfn|Mann|1910|p=245}} In 958, he granted privileges to [[Subiaco Abbey]], on condition that:\n{{quote|every day by priests and monks should be recited, for the good of our soul and the souls of our successors, a hundred Kyrie-eleisons and a hundred Christe-eleisons, and that thrice each week the priests should offer the Holy Mass to Almighty God for the absolution of our soul and those of our successors.{{sfn|Mann|1910|p=246}}}}\n\nIn 960 John confirmed the appointment of [[Saint Dunstan]] as [[archbishop of Canterbury]], who travelled to Rome to receive the pallium directly from John XII's hands.{{sfn|Mann|1910|pp=265\u2013266}}\n\nOn 12 February 962, John convened a [[synod]] in Rome at the behest of Emperor Otto. In it, John agreed to establish the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg]] and the [[Bishopric of Merseburg]], bestowed the pallium on the [[archbishop of Salzburg]] and [[archbishop of Trier]], and confirmed the appointment of [[Ratherius|Rather]] as [[bishop of Verona]]. It also passed a resolution [[excommunicating]] Bishop [[Hugh of Vermandois (Bishop)|Hugh of Vermandois]], who had attempted to reclaim his former position as [[archbishop of Reims]].{{sfn|Mann|1910|pp=253\u2013254}} This excommunication was reconfirmed by John at another synod held at [[Pavia]] later that same year.{{sfn|Mann|1910|p=235}}\n\nAccording to [[Horace Kinder Mann]], \"ecclesiastical affairs did not seem to have had much attraction for John XII.\"{{sfn|Mann|1910|p=254}}\n\n==Conflict with Otto and death==\n\nOtto left Rome on 14 February 962 in order to bring Berengar II to heel. Before leaving he suggested that John, \"who passed his whole life in vanity and adultery\", give up his worldly and sensual lifestyle. John ignored this advice and watched with increasing anxiety as Otto quickly drove Berengar out of the Papal States. Growing ever more fearful of the emperor's power, he sent envoys to the [[Magyars]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]] to form a league against Otto. He also entered into negotiations with Berengar's son Adalbert.{{sfn|Mann|1910|p=254}}\n\nJohn's ambassadors were captured by Otto I, who sent a deputation to Rome to discover what was happening behind his back.{{sfn|Gregorovius|1895|p=340}}  John in the meantime sent his own envoys to Otto, including the future [[Pope Leo VIII]], who tried to reassure the emperor that John was seeking to reform the papal court.{{sfn|Mann|1910|pp=255\u2013256}} However, in 963, Otto next learned that Adalbert had been allowed to enter Rome for discussions with John. With Berengar effectively defeated and imprisoned, Otto returned to Rome, besieging it in the summer of 963. He found a city divided; supporters of the emperor who had reported Adalbert's arrival in Rome had dug themselves in at Joannispolis, a fortified section of Rome centred on the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]]. John and his supporters meanwhile retained the old [[Leonine City]]. At first John prepared to defend the city; appearing in armour, he managed to drive Otto's forces across the [[Tiber River]].{{sfn|Gregorovius|1895|pp= 341\u2013342}} However, he quickly decided that he could not continue to defend the city, and so taking the papal treasury with him, he and Adalbert fled to [[Tibur]].{{sfn|Norwich|2011|p=79}}{{sfn|Mann|1910|p=256}}\n\nOtto I subsequently summoned a [[Synod of Rome (963)|council]] which demanded that John present himself and defend himself against a number of charges. John responded by threatening to excommunicate anyone who attempted to depose him.{{sfn|Gregorovius|1895|p=347}} Undeterred, the emperor and the council deposed John XII, who by this time had gone hunting in the mountains of [[Campania]],{{sfn|Norwich|2011|p=80}} and elected [[Pope Leo VIII]] in his stead.{{sfn|Luttwak|2009|p=150}}\n\nAn attempt at a revolt in support of John was mounted by the inhabitants of Rome even before Otto I left the city, but was put down with a large loss of life. However, upon the emperor's departure, John XII returned at the head of a large company of friends and retainers, causing Leo VIII to flee to the emperor for safety.{{sfn|Gregorovius|1895|pp=349\u2013350}} Entering Rome in February 964, John proceeded to summon a [[Synod of Rome (964)|synod]] which pronounced his deposition as uncanonical. After mutilating some of his enemies, he again was the effective ruler of Rome.{{sfn|Norwich|2011|pp=80\u201381}}{{sfn|Mann|1910|pp=262\u2013264}} Sending Otgar, [[Bishopric of Speyer|Bishop of Speyer]] to the emperor, he attempted to come to some accommodation with Otto, but before anything could come of it, John XII died on 14 May 964. According to [[Liudprand of Cremona]], John died whilst enjoying an adulterous sexual encounter outside Rome, either as the result of [[apoplexy]], or at the hands of an outraged husband.{{sfn|Mann|1910|p=264}}\n\nJohn was buried in the Lateran. [[Pope Benedict V]] soon succeeded him, but he was successfully deposed by [[Leo VIII]].\n\n==Character and reputation==\nJohn's dual role as the secular prince of Rome and the spiritual head of the church saw his behaviour lean towards the former rather than the latter.{{sfn|Gregorovius|1895|p=329}} He was depicted as a coarse, immoral man in the writings which remain about his papacy, whose life was such that the [[Lateran Palace]] was spoken of as a [[brothel]], and the moral corruption in Rome became the subject of general disgrace. His lifestyle suited the secular prince he was, and his political enemies would use these accusations to blacken his reputation not only to justify, but to obscure the political dimensions of his deposition.\n\nIt is for this purpose that [[Liudprand of Cremona]], a partisan of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], gives an account of the charges levelled against him at the [[Synod of Rome (963)|Synod of Rome]] in 963:\n{{quote|Then, rising up, the [[cardinal priest]] Peter testified that he himself had seen John XII celebrate [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] without taking communion. John, [[bishop of Narni]], and John, a [[cardinal deacon]], professed that they themselves saw that a deacon had been ordained in a horse stable, but were unsure of the time. Benedict, cardinal deacon, with other co-deacons and priests, said they knew that he had been paid for [[consecration|ordaining]] [[bishop]]s, specifically that he had ordained a ten-year-old bishop in the city of [[Todi]] ... They testified about his [[adultery]], which they did not see with their own eyes, but nonetheless knew with certainty: he had [[fornication|fornicated]] with the [[widow]] of Rainier, with Stephana his father's [[concubine]], with the widow Anna, and with his own niece, and he made the [[Apostolic Palace|sacred palace]] into a whorehouse. They said that he had gone hunting publicly; that he had blinded his [[confessor]] Benedict, and thereafter Benedict had died; that he had killed John, cardinal [[subdeacon]], after [[castration|castrating]] him; and that he had set fires, girded on a sword, and put on a helmet and [[cuirass]]. All, clerics as well as laymen, declared that he had [[Toast (honor)|toast]]ed to the devil with wine. They said when playing at dice, he invoked [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and other [[demon]]s. They even said he did not celebrate [[Matins]] at the [[canonical hours]] nor did he make the [[sign of the cross]].}}\n\nHowever, other contemporaries also accused John of immoral behaviour. For example, [[Ratherius|Ratherius of Verona]] wrote:\n{{quote|What improvement could be looked for if one who was leading an immoral life, who was bellicose and perjured, and who was devoted to hunting, hawking, gaming, and wine, were to be elected to the Apostolic See?{{sfn|Mann|1910|p=242}}}}\n\nIn the end though, much of the subsequent extreme condemnation of John XII is derived from the accusations recorded by Liudprand of Cremona. So according to fiercely anti-Catholic [[Louis Marie de la Haye, Vicomte de Cormenin|Louis Marie DeCormenin]]:\n{{quote|John XII was worthy of being the rival of [[Elagabalus]] ... a robber, a murderer, and incestuous person, unworthy to represent Christ upon the pontifical throne ... This abominable priest soiled the chair of St. Peter for nine entire years and deserved to be called the most wicked of popes.{{sfn|DeCormenin|Gihon|1857|pp=296\u2013298}}}}\n\nThe historian [[Ferdinand Gregorovius]] was somewhat more sympathetic:\n{{quote|John's princely instincts were stronger than his taste for spiritual duties, and the two natures\u2014that of Octavian and that of John the Twelfth\u2014stood in unequal conflict. Called as he was in the immaturity of youth to a position which gave him claims on the reverence of the world, his judgment deserted him, and he plunged into the most unbridled sensuality.  The Lateran palace was turned into an abode of riot and debauchery. The gilded youths of the city were his daily companions ... The son of the glorious Alberic thus fell a sacrifice to his own unbridled passion, and to the anomalous position which he held as Prince and Pope at the same time. His youth, the greatness of his father, the tragic discords of his position, claim for him a lenient judgment.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gregorovius |first1=Ferdinand |title=History of the City of Rome in the Middle Ages, Volume 3 |date=1895 |publisher=G.

The pope and the Roman nobility swore an oath over the buried remains of [[Saint Peter]] to be faithful to Otto, and not to provide aid to Berengar II or his son [[Adalbert of Italy|Adalbert]].{{sfn|Mann|1910|p=250}} Eleven days later, the pope and emperor ratified the ''[[Diploma Ottonianum]]'', under which the emperor became the guarantor of the independence of the [[Papal States]], which ran from [[Naples]] and [[Capua]] in the south to [[La Spezia]] and [[Venice]] in the north. This was the first effective guarantee of such protection since the collapse of the [[Carolingian Empire]] nearly 100 years before. He also confirmed the freedom of papal elections, but retained the imperial right to agree to the election before the papal consecration, whilst at the same time retaining the clauses of the [[Constitutio Romana]] which restricted temporal papal power.{{sfn|Mann|1910|p=252}}{{sfn|Gregorovius|1895|p=338}}\n\n==Church affairs==\n[[File:Coins of Pope John XII.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Coins of John XII]]\nAlthough Pope John XII was condemned for his worldly ways, he still managed to devote some time towards church affairs. In early 956 he wrote to William of [[Mainz|Mayence]], the [[papal legate]] in [[Germany]], urging him to continue in his work there, especially against those who would \u201cdevastate the churches of God\u201d. He asked William to inform him of the goings on both in [[West Francia]] and Germany. John also wrote to [[Henry I (Archbishop of Trier)|Henry]], the new [[archbishop of Trier]], granting him the [[pallium]] and encouraging him to lead a good life.{{sfn|Mann|1910|p=245}} In 958, he granted privileges to [[Subiaco Abbey]], on condition that:\n{{quote|every day by priests and monks should be recited, for the good of our soul and the souls of our successors, a hundred Kyrie-eleisons and a hundred Christe-eleisons, and that thrice each week the priests should offer the Holy Mass to Almighty God for the absolution of our soul and those of our successors.{{sfn|Mann|1910|p=246}}}}\n\nIn 960 John confirmed the appointment of [[Saint Dunstan]] as [[archbishop of Canterbury]], who travelled to Rome to receive the pallium directly from John XII's hands.{{sfn|Mann|1910|pp=265\u2013266}}\n\nOn 12 February 962, John convened a [[synod]] in Rome at the behest of Emperor Otto. In it, John agreed to establish the [[Archbishopric of Magdeburg]] and the [[Bishopric of Merseburg]], bestowed the pallium on the [[archbishop of Salzburg]] and [[archbishop of Trier]], and confirmed the appointment of [[Ratherius|Rather]] as [[bishop of Verona]]. It also passed a resolution [[excommunicating]] Bishop [[Hugh of Vermandois (Bishop)|Hugh of Vermandois]], who had attempted to reclaim his former position as [[archbishop of Reims]].{{sfn|Mann|1910|pp=253\u2013254}} This excommunication was reconfirmed by John at another synod held at [[Pavia]] later that same year.{{sfn|Mann|1910|p=235}}\n\nAccording to [[Horace Kinder Mann]], \"ecclesiastical affairs did not seem to have had much attraction for John XII.\"{{sfn|Mann|1910|p=254}}\n\n==Conflict with Otto and death==\n\nOtto left Rome on 14 February 962 in order to bring Berengar II to heel. Before leaving he suggested that John, \"who passed his whole life in vanity and adultery\", give up his worldly and sensual lifestyle. John ignored this advice and watched with increasing anxiety as Otto quickly drove Berengar out of the Papal States. Growing ever more fearful of the emperor's power, he sent envoys to the [[Magyars]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]] to form a league against Otto. He also entered into negotiations with Berengar's son Adalbert.{{sfn|Mann|1910|p=254}}\n\nJohn's ambassadors were captured by Otto I, who sent a deputation to Rome to discover what was happening behind his back.{{sfn|Gregorovius|1895|p=340}}  John in the meantime sent his own envoys to Otto, including the future [[Pope Leo VIII]], who tried to reassure the emperor that John was seeking to reform the papal court.{{sfn|Mann|1910|pp=255\u2013256}} However, in 963, Otto next learned that Adalbert had been allowed to enter Rome for discussions with John. With Berengar effectively defeated and imprisoned, Otto returned to Rome, besieging it in the summer of 963. He found a city divided; supporters of the emperor who had reported Adalbert's arrival in Rome had dug themselves in at Joannispolis, a fortified section of Rome centred on the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]]. John and his supporters meanwhile retained the old [[Leonine City]]. At first John prepared to defend the city; appearing in armour, he managed to drive Otto's forces across the [[Tiber River]].{{sfn|Gregorovius|1895|pp= 341\u2013342}} However, he quickly decided that he could not continue to defend the city, and so taking the papal treasury with him, he and Adalbert fled to [[Tibur]].{{sfn|Norwich|2011|p=79}}{{sfn|Mann|1910|p=256}}\n\nOtto I subsequently summoned a [[Synod of Rome (963)|council]] which demanded that John present himself and defend himself against a number of charges. John responded by threatening to excommunicate anyone who attempted to depose him.{{sfn|Gregorovius|1895|p=347}} Undeterred, the emperor and the council deposed John XII, who by this time had gone hunting in the mountains of [[Campania]],{{sfn|Norwich|2011|p=80}} and elected [[Pope Leo VIII]] in his stead.{{sfn|Luttwak|2009|p=150}}\n\nAn attempt at a revolt in support of John was mounted by the inhabitants of Rome even before Otto I left the city, but was put down with a large loss of life. However, upon the emperor's departure, John XII returned at the head of a large company of friends and retainers, causing Leo VIII to flee to the emperor for safety.{{sfn|Gregorovius|1895|pp=349\u2013350}} Entering Rome in February 964, John proceeded to summon a [[Synod of Rome (964)|synod]] which pronounced his deposition as uncanonical. After mutilating some of his enemies, he again was the effective ruler of Rome.{{sfn|Norwich|2011|pp=80\u201381}}{{sfn|Mann|1910|pp=262\u2013264}} Sending Otgar, [[Bishopric of Speyer|Bishop of Speyer]] to the emperor, he attempted to come to some accommodation with Otto, but before anything could come of it, John XII died on 14 May 964. According to [[Liudprand of Cremona]], John died whilst enjoying an adulterous sexual encounter outside Rome, either as the result of [[apoplexy]], or at the hands of an outraged husband.{{sfn|Mann|1910|p=264}}\n\nJohn was buried in the Lateran. [[Pope Benedict V]] soon succeeded him, but he was successfully deposed by [[Leo VIII]].\n\n==Character and reputation==\nJohn's dual role as the secular prince of Rome and the spiritual head of the church saw his behaviour lean towards the former rather than the latter.{{sfn|Gregorovius|1895|p=329}} He was depicted as a coarse, immoral man in the writings which remain about his papacy, whose life was such that the [[Lateran Palace]] was spoken of as a [[brothel]], and the moral corruption in Rome became the subject of general disgrace. His lifestyle suited the secular prince he was, and his political enemies would use these accusations to blacken his reputation not only to justify, but to obscure the political dimensions of his deposition.\n\nIt is for this purpose that [[Liudprand of Cremona]], a partisan of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], gives an account of the charges levelled against him at the [[Synod of Rome (963)|Synod of Rome]] in 963:\n{{quote|Then, rising up, the [[cardinal priest]] Peter testified that he himself had seen John XII celebrate [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] without taking communion. John, [[bishop of Narni]], and John, a [[cardinal deacon]], professed that they themselves saw that a deacon had been ordained in a horse stable, but were unsure of the time. Benedict, cardinal deacon, with other co-deacons and priests, said they knew that he had been paid for [[consecration|ordaining]] [[bishop]]s, specifically that he had ordained a ten-year-old bishop in the city of [[Todi]] ... They testified about his [[adultery]], which they did not see with their own eyes, but nonetheless knew with certainty: he had [[fornication|fornicated]] with the [[widow]] of Rainier, with Stephana his father's [[concubine]], with the widow Anna, and with his own niece, and he made the [[Apostolic Palace|sacred palace]] into a whorehouse. They said that he had gone hunting publicly; that he had blinded his [[confessor]] Benedict, and thereafter Benedict had died; that he had killed John, cardinal [[subdeacon]], after [[castration|castrating]] him; and that he had set fires, girded on a sword, and put on a helmet and [[cuirass]]. All, clerics as well as laymen, declared that he had [[Toast (honor)|toast]]ed to the devil with wine. They said when playing at dice, he invoked [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and other [[demon]]s. They even said he did not celebrate [[Matins]] at the [[canonical hours]] nor did he make the [[sign of the cross]].}}\n\nHowever, other contemporaries also accused John of immoral behaviour. For example, [[Ratherius|Ratherius of Verona]] wrote:\n{{quote|What improvement could be looked for if one who was leading an immoral life, who was bellicose and perjured, and who was devoted to hunting, hawking, gaming, and wine, were to be elected to the Apostolic See?{{sfn|Mann|1910|p=242}}}}\n\nIn the end though, much of the subsequent extreme condemnation of John XII is derived from the accusations recorded by Liudprand of Cremona. So according to fiercely anti-Catholic [[Louis Marie de la Haye, Vicomte de Cormenin|Louis Marie DeCormenin]]:\n{{quote|John XII was worthy of being the rival of [[Elagabalus]] ... a robber, a murderer, and incestuous person, unworthy to represent Christ upon the pontifical throne ... This abominable priest soiled the chair of St. Peter for nine entire years and deserved to be called the most wicked of popes.{{sfn|DeCormenin|Gihon|1857|pp=296\u2013298}}}}\n\nThe historian [[Ferdinand Gregorovius]] was somewhat more sympathetic:\n{{quote|John's princely instincts were stronger than his taste for spiritual duties, and the two natures\u2014that of Octavian and that of John the Twelfth\u2014stood in unequal conflict. Called as he was in the immaturity of youth to a position which gave him claims on the reverence of the world, his judgment deserted him, and he plunged into the most unbridled sensuality.  The Lateran palace was turned into an abode of riot and debauchery. The gilded youths of the city were his daily companions ... The son of the glorious Alberic thus fell a sacrifice to his own unbridled passion, and to the anomalous position which he held as Prince and Pope at the same time. His youth, the greatness of his father, the tragic discords of his position, claim for him a lenient judgment.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gregorovius |first1=Ferdinand |title=History of the City of Rome in the Middle Ages, Volume 3 |date=1895 |publisher=G.

To the southwest is the [[Crown Range]] and town of [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] ({{convert|120|km|mi}}); to the north the [[Haast Pass]] cuts through the [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]] near [[Makarora]]. To the northeast are the towns of [[Omarama]] and [[Twizel]]. Very close to Lake W\u0101naka is [[Lake H\u0101wea]], in a parallel [[U-shaped valley|glacial valley]], which has a recently developed settlement of about 1,500 people. To the south of the town lies more of the Southern Alps. The [[Glendhu Bay]] motorpark is close to the town, leading into the [[Matukituki River]] valley which gives access to the [[Mount Aspiring National Park]].\n\nThe centre of the town lies on flat land beside Roy's Bay. Parts of the town have expanded into the hills surrounding the centre and around Roy's Bay in both directions. The lakeside area of the town is prone to occasional flooding in spring, when heavy rain and snowmelt can cause the lake to rise quickly, as in November 1999.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20030830102213/http://www.civildefence.govt.nz:80/memwebsite.NSF/Files/Tephra2003-Flood-forcasts/$file/Tephra2003-Flood-forcasts.pdf ]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927105052/http://www.qldc.govt.nz/Documents/ContentDocuments/agendas_and_minutes/061003Extra-OrdinaryCouncilFlood.pdf ]</ref>\n\n===Climate===\n\nDespite its [[oceanic climate]], Wanaka is one of the few areas in New Zealand to enjoy a semi-[[continental climate]], with four distinct seasons.

To the southwest is the [[Crown Range]] and town of [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] ({{convert|120|km|mi}}); to the north the [[Haast Pass]] cuts through the [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]] near [[Makarora]]. To the northeast are the towns of [[Omarama]] and [[Twizel]]. Very close to Lake W\u0101naka is [[Lake H\u0101wea]], in a parallel [[U-shaped valley|glacial valley]], which has a recently developed settlement of about 1,500 people. To the south of the town lies more of the Southern Alps. The [[Glendhu Bay]] motorpark is close to the town, leading into the [[Matukituki River]] valley which gives access to the [[Mount Aspiring National Park]].\n\nThe centre of the town lies on flat land beside Roy's Bay. Parts of the town have expanded into the hills surrounding the centre and around Roy's Bay in both directions.

He is widely considered one of the greatest military commanders in world history. His father, [[Hamilcar Barca]], was a leading Carthaginian commander during the [[First Punic War]] (264\u2013241&nbsp;BC). His younger brothers were [[Mago Barca|Mago]] and [[Hasdrubal Barca|Hasdrubal]], and he was brother-in-law to [[Hasdrubal the Fair]]; all also commanded Carthaginian armies.\n\nHannibal lived during a period of great tension in the western Mediterranean Basin, triggered by the emergence of the [[Roman Republic]] as a great power after it had established its supremacy over Italy. Although Rome had won the First Punic War, [[revanchism]] prevailed in Carthage, symbolised by the alleged pledge that Hannibal made to his father never to be a friend of Rome. The [[Second Punic War]] broke out in 218 after Hannibal's attack on [[Saguntum]], an ally of Rome in [[Hispania]].  He then made his famous military exploit of carrying war to Italy by [[Hannibal's crossing of the Alps|crossing the Alps]] with his [[Elephants in war|African elephants]]. In his first few years in Italy, he won a succession of dramatic victories at [[Battle of the Trebia|the Trebia]], [[Battle of Lake Trasimene|Lake Trasimene]], and [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]. He distinguished himself for his ability to determine his and his opponent's respective strengths and weaknesses, and to plan battles accordingly. Hannibal's well-planned strategies allowed him to conquer several Italian cities allied to Rome. Hannibal occupied most of southern Italy for 15 years, but could not win a decisive victory, as the Romans led by [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus|Fabius Maximus]] avoided confrontation with him, instead waging a war of [[Fabian strategy|attrition]]. A counter-invasion of North Africa led by [[Scipio Africanus]] forced him to return to Carthage. Scipio eventually defeated Hannibal at the [[Battle of Zama]], having previously driven Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal out of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nAfter the war, Hannibal successfully ran for the office of [[shophet|sufet]]. He enacted political and financial reforms to enable the payment of the war indemnity imposed by Rome; however, those reforms were unpopular with members of the Carthaginian aristocracy and in Rome, and he fled into voluntary exile. During this time, he lived at the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] court, where he acted as military advisor to [[Antiochus III the Great]] in his war against Rome. Antiochus met defeat at the [[Battle of Magnesia]] and was forced to accept Rome's terms, and Hannibal fled again, making a stop in the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. His flight ended in the court of [[Bithynia]]. He was afterwards betrayed to the Romans and committed suicide by poisoning himself.\n\nHannibal is often regarded as one of the greatest military strategists in history and one of the greatest generals of Mediterranean antiquity, together with [[Philip of Macedon]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Julius Caesar]], Scipio Africanus and [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]]. [[Plutarch]] states that Scipio supposedly asked Hannibal \"who the greatest general was\", to which Hannibal replied \"either Alexander or Pyrrhus, then himself\".<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Titus Flamininus'' 21.3\u20134.  Plutarch adds that \"when asked what his choices would be if he had beaten Scipio, he replied that he would be the best of them all\".  However, Plutarch gives another version in his ''Life of Pyrrhus'', 8.2: \"Pyrrhus, Scipio, then himself\".</ref> Military historian [[Theodore Ayrault Dodge]] called Hannibal the \"father of strategy\",<ref name=\"dodge\">{{cite book|title=Hannibal: A History of the Art of War Among the Carthaginians and Romans Down to the Battle of Pydna, 168 BC|first=Theodore Ayrault |last=Dodge|publisher=Da Capo Press |year=1995}}</ref> because Roman armies adopted elements of his military tactics into their own strategic arsenal.\n\n==Name==\n''Hannibal'' was a common [[Hannibal (given name)|Carthaginian personal name]]. It is recorded in Carthaginian sources as {{sc|\u1e25nb\u02bfl}}{{sfnp|Huss|1985|p=[https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=NvEK7kc3qnQC&pg=PA565 565]}} ({{lang-xpu|\ud802\udd07\ud802\udd0d\ud802\udd01\ud802\udd0f\ud802\udd0b}}). It is a combination of the common Carthaginian masculine given name [[Hanno (disambiguation)|Hanno]] with the [[Northwest Semitic]] [[Canaan]]ite deity [[Baal]] (<small>lit.</small>{{nbsp}}\"lord\").

He maintained this post for eight years until 221&nbsp;BC. Soon the Romans became aware of an alliance between Carthage and the [[Celts]] of the [[Po Valley]] in [[Northern Italy]]. The Celts were amassing forces to invade farther south in Italy, presumably with Carthaginian backing. Therefore, the Romans preemptively invaded the Po region in 225&nbsp;BC.

De Beer was one of only three interpreters \u2013 the others being John Lazenby and Jakob Seibert \u2013 to have visited all the Alpine high passes and presented a view on which was most plausible. Both De Beer and Siebert had selected the Col de la Traversette as the one most closely matching the ancient descriptions.<ref>de Beer, S.

It is moreover the most southerly, as [[Varro]] in his ''De re rustica'' relates, agreeing that Hannibal's Pass was the highest in Western Alps and the most southerly. Mahaney ''et al''. argue that factors used by De Beer to support Col de la Traversette including \"gauging ancient place names against modern, close scrutiny of times of flood in major rivers and distant viewing of the Po plains\" taken together with \"massive radiocarbon and microbiological and parasitical evidence\" from the alluvial sediments either side of the pass furnish \"supporting evidence, proof if you will\" that Hannibal's invasion went that way.<ref>W.

The fired rockfall event is mentioned only by Livy; Polybius is mute on the subject and there is no evidence<ref>Mahaney, W.C., et al., 2009. \"The Traversette rockfall: geomorphological reconstruction and importance in interpreting classical history.\" Archaeometry, v. 52, no. 1, pp. 156\u2013172.</ref> of carbonized rock at the only two-tier rockfall in the Western Alps, located below the [[Col de la Traversette]] (Mahaney, 2008). If Polybius is correct in his figure for the number of troops that he commanded after the crossing of the Rh\u00f4ne, this would suggest that he had lost almost half of his force. Historians such as Serge Lancell have questioned the reliability of the figures for the number of troops that he had when he left Hispania.<ref>S. Lancel, ''Hannibal'' (1995; English translation 1999) page 60.</ref> From the start, he seems to have calculated that he would have to operate without aid from Hispania.\n\nHannibal's vision of military affairs was derived partly from the teaching of his Greek tutors and partly from experience gained alongside his father, and it stretched over most of the Hellenistic World of his time. Indeed, the breadth of his vision gave rise to his grand strategy of conquering Rome by opening a northern front and subduing allied city-states on the peninsula, rather than by attacking Rome directly. Historical events which led to the defeat of Carthage during the First Punic War when his father commanded the Carthaginian Army also led Hannibal to plan the invasion of Italy by land across the Alps.\n\nThe task was daunting, to say the least. It involved the mobilization of between 60,000 and 100,000 troops and the training of a war-elephant corps, all of which had to be provisioned along the way. The alpine invasion of Italy was a military operation that would shake the Mediterranean World of 218&nbsp;BC with repercussions for more than two decades.\n\n===Battle of Trebia===\n{{Main|Battle of the Trebia}}\n[[File:Battle trebia.gif|thumb|right|300px|A diagram depicting the tactics used in the [[Battle of the Trebia]]]]\nHannibal's perilous march brought him into the Roman territory and frustrated the attempts of the enemy to fight out the main issue on foreign ground. His sudden appearance among the [[Gaul]]s of the Po Valley, moreover, enabled him to detach those tribes from their new allegiance to the Romans before the Romans could take steps to check the rebellion. [[Publius Cornelius Scipio (consul 218 BC)|Publius Cornelius Scipio]] was the consul who commanded the Roman force sent to intercept Hannibal (he was also the father of Scipio Africanus). He had not expected Hannibal to make an attempt to cross the Alps, since the Romans were prepared to fight the war in the Iberian Peninsula. With a small detachment still positioned in Gaul, Scipio made an attempt to intercept Hannibal. He succeeded, through prompt decision and speedy movement, in transporting his army to Italy by sea in time to meet Hannibal. Hannibal's forces moved through the Po Valley and were engaged in the [[Battle of Ticinus]]. Here, Hannibal forced the Romans to evacuate the plain of [[Lombardy]], by virtue of his superior [[cavalry]].<ref name=\"dodge_old\">[[Theodore Ayrault Dodge|Dodge, Theodore]]. ''Hannibal''. Cambridge Massachusetts: De Capo Press, 1891 {{ISBN|0-306-81362-9}}</ref> The victory was minor, but it encouraged the Gauls and Ligurians to join the Carthaginian cause, whose troops bolstered his army back to around 40,000 men. Scipio was severely injured, his life only saved by the bravery of his son who rode back onto the field to rescue his fallen father. Scipio retreated across the Trebia to camp at [[Piacenza|Placentia]] with his army mostly intact.<ref name=\"dodge_old\" />\n\nThe other [[Roman consul]]ar army was rushed to the Po Valley. Even before news of the defeat at Ticinus had reached Rome, the Senate had ordered Consul [[Tiberius Sempronius Longus (consul 218 BC)|Tiberius Sempronius Longus]] to bring his army back from Sicily to meet Scipio and face Hannibal. Hannibal, by skillful maneuvers, was in position to head him off, for he lay on the direct road between Placentia and Arminum, by which Sempronius would have to march to reinforce Scipio. He then captured Clastidium, from which he drew large amounts of supplies for his men. But this gain was not without loss, as Sempronius avoided Hannibal's watchfulness, slipped around his flank, and joined his colleague in his camp near the [[Trebbia|Trebia River]] near [[Piacenza|Placentia]]. There Hannibal had an opportunity to show his masterful military skill at the Trebia in December of the same year, after wearing down the superior Roman [[infantry]], when he cut it to pieces with a surprise attack and ambush from the flanks.\n\n===Battle of Lake Trasimene===\n{{Main|Battle of Lake Trasimene}}\nHannibal quartered his troops for the winter with the Gauls, whose support for him had abated. In the spring of 217&nbsp;BC, Hannibal decided to find a more reliable base of operations farther south. Gnaeus Servilius and Gaius Flaminius (the new consuls of Rome) were expecting Hannibal to advance on Rome, and they took their armies to block the eastern and western routes that Hannibal could use.<ref>Polybius, ''Histories'', Book III, 77</ref>\n[[File:Battle of lake trasimene.gif|right|300px|thumb|[[Battle of Lake Trasimene]], 217&nbsp;BC.<br />From the Department of History, United States Military Academy]]\nThe only alternative route to central Italy lay at the mouth of the [[Arno]]. This area was practically one huge marsh, and happened to be overflowing more than usual during this particular season. Hannibal knew that this route was full of difficulties, but it remained the surest and certainly the quickest way to central Italy. [[Polybius]] claims that Hannibal's men marched for four days and three nights, \"through a land that was under water\", suffering terribly from fatigue and enforced want of sleep. He crossed without opposition over both the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] (during which he lost his right eye<ref>{{cite book |author1=John Selby Watson |author2=Marcus Junianus |author3=Justinus, Cornelius |author4=Nepos, Eutropius | url = https://archive.org/details/justincornelius00watsgoog |quote=hannibal greatest. | title = Justin, Cornelius Nepos, and Eutropius: Literally Translated, with Notes | year = 1853 | publisher = H.

As Polybius recounts, \"he [Hannibal] calculated that, if he passed the camp and made a descent into the district beyond, Flaminius (partly for fear of popular reproach and partly of personal irritation) would be unable to endure watching passively the devastation of the country but would spontaneously follow him... and give him opportunities for attack.\"<ref>[[B. H. Liddell Hart|Liddell Hart, B. H.]], ''Strategy'', New York City, New York, Penguin Group, 1967</ref> At the same time, Hannibal tried to break the allegiance of Rome's allies by proving that Flaminius was powerless to protect them. Despite this, Flaminius remained passively encamped at Arretium. Hannibal marched boldly around Flaminius' left flank, unable to draw him into battle by mere devastation, and effectively cut him off from Rome (thus executing the first recorded [[turning movement]] in military history). He then advanced through the uplands of [[Etruria]], provoking Flaminius into a hasty pursuit and catching him in a [[defile (geography)|defile]] on the shore of [[Lake Trasimeno|Lake Trasimenus]]. There Hannibal destroyed Flaminius' army in the waters or on the adjoining slopes, killing Flaminius as well (see [[Battle of Lake Trasimene]]). This was the most costly ambush that the Romans ever sustained until the [[Battle of Carrhae]] against the [[Parthian Empire]].\n\nHannibal had now disposed of the only field force that could check his advance upon Rome, but he realized that, without [[siege engine]]s, he could not hope to take the capital. He preferred to exploit his victory by entering into central and southern Italy and encouraging a general revolt against the sovereign power.<ref>[http://www.iwar.org.uk/military/resources/hannibal/Parker_J_P_01.pdf USAWC] ''Comparing Strategies of the 2nd Punic War'' by James Parker.

Departing from Roman military traditions, Fabius adopted the [[Fabian strategy|strategy named after him]], avoiding open battle while placing several Roman armies in Hannibal's vicinity in order to watch and limit his movements.\n\nHannibal ravaged Apulia but was unable to bring Fabius to battle, so he decided to march through [[Samnium]] to [[Campania]], one of the richest and most fertile provinces of Italy, hoping that the devastation would draw Fabius into battle. Fabius closely followed Hannibal's path of destruction, yet still refused to let himself be drawn out of the defensive. This strategy was unpopular with many Romans, who believed that it was a form of cowardice.\n\nHannibal decided that it would be unwise to winter in the already devastated lowlands of Campania, but Fabius had ensured that all the passes were blocked out of Campania. To avoid this, Hannibal deceived the Romans into thinking that the Carthaginian army was going to escape through the woods. As the Romans moved off towards the woods, Hannibal's army occupied the pass, and then made their way through the pass unopposed. Fabius was within striking distance but in this case his caution worked against him. Smelling a stratagem (rightly), he stayed put. For the winter, Hannibal found comfortable quarters in the [[Apulia]]n plain. What Hannibal achieved in extricating his army was, as [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] puts it, \"a classic of ancient generalship, finding its way into nearly every historical narrative of the war and being used by later military manuals\".<ref>Goldsworthy, Adrian K. ''The Roman Army at War 100 BC&nbsp;\u2014 AD 200'', New York</ref> This was a severe blow to Fabius' prestige and soon after this his period of dictatorial power ended.\n\n===Battle of Cannae===\n[[File:Battle cannae destruction.gif|right|thumb|330px|Destruction of the Roman army (red), courtesy of the Department of History, United States Military Academy]]{{Main|Battle of Cannae}}\nIn the spring of 216&nbsp;BC, Hannibal took the initiative and seized the large supply depot at Cannae in the Apulian plain. By capturing Cannae, Hannibal had placed himself between the Romans and their crucial sources of supply.<ref name=\"polybius\">{{cite web| url = http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/polybius-cannae.html | title = Internet Ancient History Sourcebook}}</ref> Once the Roman Senate resumed their consular elections in 216&nbsp;BC, they appointed [[Gaius Terentius Varro]] and [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 219 BC)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]] as [[Roman consul|consuls]]. In the meantime, the Romans hoped to gain success through sheer strength and weight of numbers, and they raised a new army of unprecedented size, estimated by some to be as large as 100,000 men, but more likely around 50\u201380,000.<ref name=\"cottrell\">Cottrell, Leonard, ''Enemy of Rome'', Evans Bros, 1965, {{ISBN|0-237-44320-1}}</ref>\n\nThe Romans and allied legions resolved to confront Hannibal and marched southward to [[Apulia]]. They eventually found him on the left bank of the Aufidus River, and encamped {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} away. On this occasion, the two armies were combined into one, the consuls having to alternate their command on a daily basis. Varro was in command on the first day, a man of reckless and hubristic nature (according to Livy) and determined to defeat Hannibal.<ref name=\"cottrell\"/> Hannibal capitalized on the eagerness of Varro and drew him into a trap by using an [[Pincer movement|envelopment tactic]]. This eliminated the Roman numerical advantage by shrinking the combat area. Hannibal drew up his least reliable infantry in a semicircle in the center with the wings composed of the Gallic and Numidian horse.<ref name=\"cottrell\"/> The Roman legions forced their way through Hannibal's weak center, but the Libyan mercenaries on the wings, swung around by the movement, menaced their flanks. The onslaught of Hannibal's cavalry was irresistible. Hannibal's chief cavalry commander [[Maharbal]] led the mobile [[Numidian cavalry]] on the right, and they shattered the Roman cavalry opposing them. Hannibal's Iberian and Gallic heavy cavalry, led by Hanno on the left, defeated the Roman heavy cavalry, and then both the Carthaginian heavy cavalry and the Numidians attacked the legions from behind. As a result, the Roman army was hemmed in with no means of escape.\n\nDue to these brilliant tactics, Hannibal managed to surround and destroy all but a small remnant of his enemy, despite his own inferior numbers. Depending upon the source, it is estimated that 50,000\u201370,000 Romans were killed or captured.<ref name=\"dodge\" /> Among the dead were Roman Consul [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 219 BC)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]], as well as two consuls for the preceding year, two [[quaestor]]s, twenty-nine out of the forty-eight [[military tribune]]s, and an additional eighty senators (at a time when the Roman Senate was composed of no more than 300 men, this constituted 25%\u201330% of the governing body). This makes the battle one of the most catastrophic defeats in the history of [[Ancient Rome]], and one of the bloodiest battles in all of human history (in terms of the number of lives lost within a single day).<ref name=\"cottrell\"/>\n\nAfter Cannae, the Romans were very hesitant to confront Hannibal in pitched battle, preferring instead to weaken him by attrition, relying on their advantages of interior lines, supply, and manpower. As a result, Hannibal fought no more major battles in Italy for the rest of the war. It is believed that his refusal to bring the war to Rome itself was due to a lack of commitment from Carthage of men, money, and material&nbsp;\u2014 principally siege equipment. Whatever the reason, the choice prompted Maharbal to say, \"Hannibal, you know how to gain a victory, but not how to use one.\"<ref>Prevas, John, ''Hannibal Crosses the Alps'', p.

Hannibal also secured an alliance with newly appointed [[tyrant]] [[Hieronymus of Syracuse]]. It is often argued that, if Hannibal had received proper material reinforcements from Carthage, he might have succeeded with a direct attack upon Rome. Instead, he had to content himself with subduing the fortresses that still held out against him, and the only other notable event of 216&nbsp;BC was the defection of certain Italian territories, including [[Capua]], the second largest city of Italy, which Hannibal made his new base. However, only a few of the Italian city-states that he had expected to gain as allies defected to him.\n\n===Stalemate===\nThe war in Italy settled into a strategic stalemate. The Romans used the [[Attrition warfare|attritional]] strategy that Fabius had taught them, and which, they finally realized, was the only feasible means of defeating Hannibal.<ref>Prevas, John, ''Hannibal Crosses the Alps: The Invasion of Italy and the Second Punic War'', p.

His immediate objectives were reduced to minor operations centered mainly round the cities of [[Campania]].\n\nThe forces detached to his lieutenants were generally unable to hold their own, and neither his home government nor his new ally Philip V of Macedon helped to make up his losses. His position in southern Italy, therefore, became increasingly difficult and his chance of ultimately conquering Rome grew ever more remote. Hannibal still won a number of notable victories: completely destroying two Roman armies in 212&nbsp;BC, and killing two consuls (including the famed [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]]) in a battle in 208&nbsp;BC. However, Hannibal slowly began losing ground\u2014inadequately supported by his Italian allies, abandoned by his government (either because of jealousy or simply because Carthage was overstretched), and unable to match Rome's resources. He was never able to bring about another grand decisive victory that could produce a lasting strategic change.\n\nCarthaginian political will was embodied in the ruling oligarchy. There was a Carthaginian Senate, but the real power was with the inner \"[[Council of 30 Nobles]]\" and the board of judges from ruling families known as the \"[[Hundred and Four]]\". These two bodies came from the wealthy, commercial families of Carthage. Two political factions operated in Carthage: the war party, also known as the \"[[Barcid]]s\" (Hannibal's family name); and the peace party led by [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno II the Great]]. Hanno had been instrumental in denying Hannibal's requested reinforcements following the battle at Cannae.\n\nHannibal started the war without the full backing of Carthaginian oligarchy. His attack of Saguntum had presented the oligarchy with a choice of war with Rome or loss of prestige in Iberia. The oligarchy, not Hannibal, controlled the strategic resources of Carthage. Hannibal constantly sought reinforcements from either Iberia or North Africa. Hannibal's troops who were lost in combat were replaced with less well-trained and motivated mercenaries from Italy or Gaul. The commercial interests of the Carthaginian oligarchy dictated the reinforcement and supply of Iberia rather than Hannibal throughout the campaign.\n\n===Hannibal's retreat in Italy===\n[[File:Escipi\u00f3n africano.JPG|thumb|upright|Bust of [[Scipio Africanus]] from the [[Villa of the Papyri]]]]\nIn March 212&nbsp;BC, Hannibal [[Battle of Tarentum (212 BC)|captured]] [[Taranto|Tarentum]] in a surprise attack but he failed to obtain control of its harbour. The tide was slowly turning against him, and in favor of Rome.\n\nThe Roman consuls mounted a [[Battle of Capua|siege of Capua]] in 212 BC. Hannibal attacked them, forcing their withdrawal from Campania. He moved to Lucania and destroyed a 16,000-man Roman army at the [[Battle of the Silarus]], with 15,000 Romans killed. Another opportunity presented itself soon after, a Roman army of 18,000 men being destroyed by Hannibal at the [[Battle of Herdonia (212 BC)|first battle of Herdonia]] with 16,000 Roman dead, freeing Apulia from the Romans for the year. The Roman consuls mounted another [[Battle of Capua (211 BC)|siege of Capua]] in 211&nbsp;BC, conquering the city. Hannibal attempted to lift the siege with an assault on the Roman siege lines but failed. He marched on Rome to force the recall of the Roman armies. He drew off 15,000 Roman soldiers, but the siege continued and Capua fell. In 212 BC, Marcellus [[Siege of Syracuse (213\u2013212 BC)|conquered]] Syracuse and the Romans destroyed the Carthaginian army in Sicily in 211\u2013210 BC. In 210 BC, the Romans entered into an alliance with the [[Aetolian League]] to counter [[Philip V of Macedon]]. Philip, who attempted to exploit Rome's preoccupation in Italy to conquer [[Illyria]], now found himself under attack from several sides at once and was quickly subdued by Rome and her Greek allies.\n\nIn 210&nbsp;BC, Hannibal again proved his superiority in tactics by inflicting a severe defeat at the [[Battle of Herdonia (210 BC)|Battle of Herdonia]] (modern [[Ordona]]) in Apulia upon a [[proconsul]]ar army and, in 208&nbsp;BC, destroyed a Roman force engaged in the siege of [[Locri]] at the [[Battle of Petelia]]. But with the loss of Tarentum in 209&nbsp;BC and the gradual reconquest by the Romans of [[Samnium]] and [[Lucania]], his hold on south Italy was almost lost. In 207&nbsp;BC, he succeeded in making his way again into Apulia, where he waited to concert measures for a combined march upon Rome with his brother [[Hasdrubal Barca|Hasdrubal]]. On hearing, however, of his brother's defeat and death at the [[battle of the Metaurus]], he retired to [[Calabria]], where he maintained himself for the ensuing years. His brother's head had been cut off, carried across Italy, and tossed over the palisade of Hannibal's camp as a cold message of the iron-clad will of the Roman Republic. The combination of these events marked the end to Hannibal's success in Italy. With the failure of his brother Mago in [[Liguria]] (205\u2013203&nbsp;BC) and of his own negotiations with Phillip V, the last hope of recovering his ascendancy in Italy was lost. In 203&nbsp;BC, after nearly fifteen years of fighting in Italy, and with the military fortunes of Carthage rapidly declining, Hannibal was recalled to Carthage to direct the defense of his native country against a Roman invasion under Scipio Africanus.\n\n{{anchor|Conclusion of the Second Punic War}}\n\n==Conclusion of the Second Punic War (203\u2013201 BC)==\n{{anchor|Return}}\n\n===Return to Carthage===\n[[File:Campagna africana di Scipione 202 aC.png|thumb|left|upright=2.0|Final act of the Second Punic War with the [[battle of Zama]] (202 BC)]]\n\nIn 203&nbsp;BC, Hannibal was recalled from Italy by the war party in Carthage. After leaving a record of his expedition engraved in [[Punic language|Punic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] upon bronze tablets in the temple of [[Juno Lacinia]] at [[Crotone|Crotona]], he sailed back to Africa.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12582/12582-h/12582-h.htm#b46 |title=28.46 |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=11 June 2004 |accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref> His arrival immediately restored the predominance of the war party, which placed him in command of a combined force of [[Africa]]n [[conscription|levies]] and his mercenaries from Italy. In 202&nbsp;BC, Hannibal met Scipio in a fruitless peace conference. Despite mutual admiration, negotiations floundered due to Roman allegations of \"Punic Faith,\" referring to the breach of protocols that ended the First Punic War by the Carthaginian attack on Saguntum, and a Carthaginan attack on a stranded Roman fleet. Scipio and Carthage had worked out a peace plan, which was approved by Rome. The terms of the treaty were quite modest, but the war had been long for the Romans. Carthage could keep its African territory but would lose its overseas empire. Masinissa ([[Numidia]]) was to be independent. Also, Carthage was to reduce its fleet and pay a war indemnity. But Carthage then made a terrible blunder. Its long-suffering citizens had captured a stranded Roman fleet in the [[Gulf of Tunis]] and stripped it of supplies, an action that aggravated the faltering negotiations. Meanwhile, Hannibal, recalled from Italy by the Carthaginian Senate, had returned with his army. Fortified by both Hannibal and the supplies, the Carthaginians rebuffed the treaty and Roman protests. The decisive [[battle of Zama]] soon followed; the defeat removed Hannibal's air of invincibility.\n\n===Battle of Zama (202 BC)===\n{{Main|Battle of Zama}}\nUnlike most battles of the [[Second Punic War]], at Zama, the Romans were superior in cavalry and the Carthaginians had the edge in infantry. This Roman cavalry superiority was due to the betrayal of [[Masinissa]], who had earlier assisted Carthage in Iberia, but changed sides in 206&nbsp;BC with the promise of land and due to his personal conflicts with [[Syphax]], a Carthaginian ally. Although the aging Hannibal was suffering from mental exhaustion and deteriorating health after years of campaigning in Italy, the Carthaginians still had the advantage in numbers and were boosted by the presence of 80 war elephants.<!-- 80 elephants, cited to sources by main article -->\n\n[[File:Slaget ved Zama - Cornelis Cort, 1567.jpg|right|thumb|Engraving of the [[Battle of Zama]] by [[Cornelis Cort]], 1567. Note that [[Asian elephant]]s are illustrated rather than the very small [[North African elephant]]s used by Carthage.]]\n\nThe Roman cavalry won an early victory by swiftly routing the Carthaginian horse, and standard Roman tactics for limiting the effectiveness of the Carthaginian war elephants were successful, including playing trumpets to frighten the elephants into running into the Carthaginian lines. Some historians say that the elephants routed the Carthaginian cavalry and not the Romans, whilst others suggest that it was actually a tactical retreat planned by Hannibal.<ref>Scullard, H.H. ''Scipio Africanus: Soldier and Politician'', p. 150, 1970. Gabriel, Richard. ''Scipio Africanus: Rome's Greatest General'', p. 192, 2008</ref> Whatever the truth, the battle remained closely fought. At one point, it seemed that Hannibal was on the verge of victory, but Scipio was able to rally his men, and his cavalry, having routed the Carthaginian cavalry, attacked Hannibal's rear. This two-pronged attack caused the Carthaginian formation to collapse.\n\nWith their foremost general defeated, the Carthaginians had no choice but to surrender. Carthage lost approximately 20,000 troops with an additional 15,000 wounded. In contrast, the Romans suffered only 2,500 casualties. The last major battle of the Second Punic War resulted in a loss of respect for Hannibal by his fellow Carthaginians. The conditions of defeat were such that Carthage could no longer battle for Mediterranean supremacy.\n\n==Later career==\n{{anchor|Peacetime Carthage}}\n[[File:Carthage Tetradrachm Tanit &amp; Horse, with a Serrated Edge.

When Phormio finished a discourse on the duties of a general, Hannibal was asked his opinion. He replied, \"I have seen during my life many old fools; but this one beats them all.\" Another story, according to [[Aulus Gellius]], is that when Antiochus III showed off the gigantic and elaborately equipped army he had created to invade Greece to Hannibal, he asked him if they would be enough for the Roman Republic, to which Hannibal replied, \"I think all this will be enough, yes, quite enough, for the Romans, even though they are most avaricious.\"<ref>[[Aulus Gellius]].

They considered him the greatest enemy Rome had ever faced. [[Livy]] gives us the idea that Hannibal was extremely cruel. Even [[Cicero]], when he talked of Rome and its two great enemies, spoke of the \"honourable\" [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] and the \"cruel\" Hannibal. Yet a different picture sometimes emerges. When Hannibal's successes had brought about the death of two [[Roman consul]]s, he vainly searched for the body of [[Gaius Flaminius]] on the shores of [[Lake Trasimeno|Lake Trasimene]], held ceremonial rituals in recognition of [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (General)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]], and sent [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus|Marcellus]]' ashes back to his family in Rome. Any bias attributed to [[Polybius]], however, is more troublesome. [[Ronald J. Mellor|Ronald Mellor]] considered the Greek scholar a loyal partisan of [[Scipio Aemilianus]],<ref>[[Ronald J. Mellor|Mellor, Ronald J.]] ''The Historians of Ancient Rome''</ref> while H. Ormerod does not view him as an 'altogether unprejudiced witness' when it came to his pet peeves, the Aetolians, the Carthaginians, and the Cretans.<ref>Omerod, H. ''Piracy in the Ancient World'', p.141</ref> Nonetheless, Polybius did recognize that the reputation for cruelty the Romans attached to Hannibal might in reality have been due to mistaking him for one of his officers, Hannibal Monomachus.<ref>[[Gavin de Beer|De Beer, Sir Gavin]] (1969).

According to [[Appian]], several years after the Second Punic War, Hannibal served as a political advisor in the Seleucid Kingdom and [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio]] arrived there on a diplomatic mission from Rome.\n{{quote|It is said that at one of their meetings in the gymnasium Scipio and Hannibal had a conversation on the subject of generalship, in the presence of a number of bystanders, and that Scipio asked Hannibal whom he considered the greatest general, to which the latter replied, \"[[Alexander the Great|Alexander of Macedonia]]\".\n\nTo this Scipio assented since he also yielded the first place to Alexander. Then he asked Hannibal whom he placed next, and he replied, \"[[Pyrrhus of Epirus]]\", because he considered boldness the first qualification of a general; \"for it would not be possible\", he said, \"to find two kings more enterprising than these\".\n\nScipio was rather nettled by this, but nevertheless he asked Hannibal to whom he would give the third place, expecting that at least the third would be assigned to him; but Hannibal replied, \"to myself; for when I was a young man I conquered Hispania and crossed the Alps with an army, the first after [[Hercules]].\"\n\nAs Scipio saw that he was likely to prolong his self-laudation he said, laughing, \"where would you place yourself, Hannibal, if you had not been defeated by me?\" Hannibal, now perceiving his jealousy, replied, \"in that case I should have put myself before Alexander\". Thus Hannibal continued his self-laudation, but flattered Scipio in an indirect manner by suggesting that he had conquered one who was the superior of Alexander.\n\nAt the end of this conversation Hannibal invited Scipio to be his guest, and Scipio replied that he would be so gladly if Hannibal were not living with [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus]], who was held in suspicion by the Romans. Thus did they, in a manner worthy of great commanders, cast aside their enmity at the end of their wars.<ref name=\"appian\">Appian, ''History of the Syrian Wars'', \u00a710 and \u00a711 at [https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_syriaca_02.html Livius.org]</ref>}}\n\nMilitary academies all over the world continue to study Hannibal's exploits, especially his victory at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]].<ref>{{cite document | title=THE INFLUENCE OF HANNIBAL OF CARTHAGE ON THE ART OF WAR AND HOW HIS LEGACY HAS BEEN INTERPRETED | author=RICK JAY MESSER|citeseerx = 10.1.1.582.1385}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hannibal in Italy by Jacopo Ripanda - Sala di Annibale - Palazzo dei Conservatori - Musei Capitolini - Rome 2016 (2).jpg|thumb|right| Hannibal's celebrated feat in crossing the Alps with [[war elephant]]s passed into European legend: detail of a fresco by [[Jacopo Ripanda]], {{circa | 1510}}, [[Capitoline Museums]], [[Rome]].]]\n\nMaximilian Otto Bismarck Caspari, in his article in the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] (1910-1911), praises Hannibal in these words:\n{{quotation|As to the transcendent military genius of Hannibal there cannot be two opinions. The man who for fifteen years could hold his ground in a hostile country against several powerful armies and a succession of able generals must have been a commander and a [[:wikt:tactician|tactician]] of supreme capacity. In the use of strategies and [[ambush|ambuscades]] he certainly surpassed all other generals of antiquity. Wonderful as his achievements were, we must marvel the more when we take into account the grudging support he received from Carthage. As his veterans melted away, he had to organize fresh levies on the spot. We never hear of a mutiny in his army, composed though it was of North Africans, Iberians and [[Gauls]]. Again, all we know of him comes for the most part from hostile sources. The Romans feared and hated him so much that they could not do him justice. Livy speaks of his great qualities, but he adds that his vices were equally great, among which he singles out his more than Punic perfidy and an inhuman cruelty. For the first there would seem to be no further justification than that he was consummately skillful in the use of ambuscades. For the latter there is, we believe, no more ground than that at certain crises he acted in the general spirit of ancient warfare. Sometimes he contrasts most favorably with his enemy. No such brutality stains his name as that perpetrated by [[Gaius Claudius Nero]] on the vanquished [[Hasdrubal Barca|Hasdrubal]]. Polybius merely says that he was accused of cruelty by the Romans and of avarice by the Carthaginians. He had indeed bitter enemies, and his life was one continuous struggle against destiny. For steadfastness of purpose, for organizing capacity and a mastery of military science he has perhaps never had an equal.<ref name=\"1911britannica\">{{Cite EB1911 |last= Caspari |first= M.O.B. |wstitle= Hannibal (general)}}</ref>}}\n\nEven the Roman chroniclers acknowledged Hannibal's supreme military leadership, writing that \"he never required others to do what he could and would not do himself\".<ref>[http://www.carpenoctem.tv/military/hannibal.html Hannibal] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160101031649/http://www.carpenoctem.tv/military/hannibal.html |date= 1 January 2016 }} at ''CarpeNoctem.tv''</ref>\nAccording to Polybius 23, 13, p.&nbsp;423:\n{{quote |It is a remarkable and very cogent proof of Hannibal's having been by nature a real leader and far superior to anyone else in statesmanship, that though he spent seventeen years in the field, passed through so many barbarous countries, and employed to aid him in desperate and extraordinary enterprises numbers of men of different nations and languages, no one ever dreamt of conspiring against him, nor was he ever deserted by those who had once joined him or submitted to him.}}\n[[File:Museum of Antiquities Hannibal.JPG|thumb |A bust of Hannibal, 17th century, [[Museum of Antiquities (Saskatoon)]]]]\n\nCount [[Alfred von Schlieffen]] developed his eponymously titled \"[[Schlieffen Plan]]\" (1905/1906) from his military studies, with a particularly heavy emphasis on the envelopment technique which Hannibal employed to surround and destroy the Roman army in the [[Battle of Cannae]].<ref>{{cite book|ref= harv|last= Daly|first= Gregory|authorlink= Gregory Daly|title= Cannae: The Experience of Battle in the Second Punic War|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=qayiX4SFonkC&pg=PR10|year= 2003|publisher= Psychology Press|isbn= 978-0-415-32743-5}}, p. x</ref><ref>{{cite book|ref= harv|last= Cottrell|first= Leonard|authorlink= Leonard Cottrell|title= Hannibal: Enemy of Rome|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zRx9xyqkJKwC&pg=RA4-PA134|year= 1992|publisher= Perseus Books Group|isbn= 978-0-306-80498-4}}, p. 134</ref> [[George S.

No battle in history is a finer sample of tactics than Cannae. But he was yet greater in logistics and strategy. No captain ever marched to and fro among so many armies of troops superior to his own numbers and material as fearlessly and skillfully as he. No man ever held his own so long or so ably against such odds. Constantly overmatched by better soldiers, led by generals always respectable, often of great ability, he yet defied all their efforts to drive him from Italy, for half a generation. Excepting in the case of Alexander, and some few isolated instances, all wars up to the Second Punic War, had been decided largely, if not entirely, by battle-tactics. Strategic ability had been comprehended only on a minor scale. Armies had marched towards each other, had fought in parallel order, and the conqueror had imposed terms on his opponent. Any variation from this rule consisted in ambuscades or other stratagems. That war could be waged by avoiding in lieu of seeking battle; that the results of a victory could be earned by attacks upon the enemy's communications, by flank-maneuvers, by seizing positions from which safely to threaten him in case he moved, and by other devices of strategy, was not understood... [However] For the first time in the history of war, we see two contending generals avoiding each other, occupying impregnable camps on heights, marching about each other's flanks to seize cities or supplies in their rear, harassing each other with small-war, and rarely venturing on a battle which might prove a fatal disaster\u2014all with a well-conceived purpose of placing his opponent at a strategic disadvantage...

He is widely considered one of the greatest military commanders in history. His father, [[Hamilcar Barca]], was a leading Carthaginian commander during the [[First Punic War]] (264\u2013241&nbsp;BC). His younger brothers were [[Mago Barca|Mago]] and [[Hasdrubal Barca|Hasdrubal]], and he was brother-in-law to [[Hasdrubal the Fair]]; all also commanded Carthaginian armies.\n\nHannibal lived during a period of great tension in the western Mediterranean Basin, triggered by the emergence of the [[Roman Republic]] as a great power after it had established its supremacy over Italy. Although Rome had won the First Punic War, [[revanchism]] prevailed in Carthage, symbolised by the alleged pledge that Hannibal made to his father never to be a friend of Rome. The [[Second Punic War]] broke out in 218 after Hannibal's attack on [[Saguntum]], an ally of Rome in [[Hispania]].  He then made his famous military exploit of carrying war to Italy by [[Hannibal's crossing of the Alps|crossing the Alps]] with his [[Elephants in war|African elephants]]. In his first few years in Italy, he won a succession of dramatic victories at [[Battle of the Trebia|the Trebia]], [[Battle of Lake Trasimene|Lake Trasimene]], and [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]. He distinguished himself for his ability to determine his and his opponent's respective strengths and weaknesses, and to plan battles accordingly. Hannibal's well-planned strategies allowed him to conquer several Italian cities allied to Rome. Hannibal occupied most of southern Italy for 15 years, but could not win a decisive victory, as the Romans led by [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus|Fabius Maximus]] avoided confrontation with him, instead waging a war of [[Fabian strategy|attrition]]. A counter-invasion of North Africa led by [[Scipio Africanus]] forced him to return to Carthage. Scipio eventually defeated Hannibal at the [[Battle of Zama]], having previously driven Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal out of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nAfter the war, Hannibal successfully ran for the office of [[shophet|sufet]]. He enacted political and financial reforms to enable the payment of the war indemnity imposed by Rome; however, those reforms were unpopular with members of the Carthaginian aristocracy and in Rome, and he fled into voluntary exile. During this time, he lived at the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] court, where he acted as military advisor to [[Antiochus III the Great]] in his war against Rome. Antiochus met defeat at the [[Battle of Magnesia]] and was forced to accept Rome's terms, and Hannibal fled again, making a stop in the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. His flight ended in the court of [[Bithynia]]. He was afterwards betrayed to the Romans and committed suicide by poisoning himself.\n\nHannibal is often regarded as one of the greatest military strategists in history and one of the greatest generals of Mediterranean antiquity, together with [[Philip of Macedon]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Julius Caesar]], Scipio Africanus and [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]]. [[Plutarch]] states that Scipio supposedly asked Hannibal \"who the greatest general was\", to which Hannibal replied \"either Alexander or Pyrrhus, then himself\".<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Titus Flamininus'' 21.3\u20134.  Plutarch adds that \"when asked what his choices would be if he had beaten Scipio, he replied that he would be the best of them all\".  However, Plutarch gives another version in his ''Life of Pyrrhus'', 8.2: \"Pyrrhus, Scipio, then himself\".</ref> Military historian [[Theodore Ayrault Dodge]] called Hannibal the \"father of strategy\",<ref name=\"dodge\">{{cite book|title=Hannibal: A History of the Art of War Among the Carthaginians and Romans Down to the Battle of Pydna, 168 BC|first=Theodore Ayrault |last=Dodge|publisher=Da Capo Press |year=1995}}</ref> because Roman armies adopted elements of his military tactics into their own strategic arsenal.\n\n==Name==\n''Hannibal'' was a common [[Hannibal (given name)|Carthaginian personal name]]. It is recorded in Carthaginian sources as {{sc|\u1e25nb\u02bfl}}{{sfnp|Huss|1985|p=[https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=NvEK7kc3qnQC&pg=PA565 565]}} ({{lang-xpu|\ud802\udd07\ud802\udd0d\ud802\udd01\ud802\udd0f\ud802\udd0b}}). It is a combination of the common Carthaginian masculine given name [[Hanno (disambiguation)|Hanno]] with the [[Northwest Semitic]] [[Canaan]]ite deity [[Baal]] (<small>lit.</small>{{nbsp}}\"lord\"). Its precise vocalization remains a matter of debate. Suggested readings include ''\u1e24annoba\u02bfal'',<ref name=brown>Brown, John Pairman. 2000.

Although he is by far the most famous Hannibal, when further clarification is necessary he is usually referred to as \"Hannibal, son of Hamilcar\", or Hannibal the Barcid, the latter term applying to the family of his father, Hamilcar Barca.  ''[[B-R-Q|Barca]]'' ({{lang-xpu|\ud802\udd01\ud802\udd13\ud802\udd12}}, {{sc|brq}}) is a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[cognomen]] meaning \"lightning\" or \"thunderbolt\",<ref>{{citation |last=Sullivan |first=Robert Joseph |title=A Dictionary of the English Language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d24CAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA489 |p=489 |year=1877 }}</ref> a surname acquired by Hamilcar on account of the swiftness and ferocity of his attacks.<ref>S.

He was born in what is present day northern Tunisia, one of many [[Mediterranean]] regions colonised by the [[Canaanites]] from their homelands in [[Phoenicia]]. He had several sisters and two brothers, [[Hasdrubal Barca|Hasdrubal]] and [[Mago Barca|Mago]]. His brothers-in-law were [[Hasdrubal the Fair]] and the [[Numidians|Numidian]] king [[Naravas]]. He was still a child when his sisters married, and his brothers-in-law were close associates during his father's struggles in the [[Mercenary War]] and the Punic conquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].<ref>Lancel, S. ''Hannibal'' p.6.</ref>\n\nAfter Carthage's defeat in the [[First Punic War]], Hamilcar set out to improve his family's and Carthage's fortunes. With that in mind and supported by [[C\u00e1diz|Gades]], Hamilcar began the subjugation of the tribes of the Iberian Peninsula. Carthage at the time was in such a poor state that it lacked a navy able to transport his army; instead, Hamilcar had to march his forces across [[Numidia]] towards the [[Pillars of Hercules]] and then cross the [[Strait of Gibraltar]].<ref>[[Gavin de Beer|De Beer, Sir Gavin]] (1969). ''Hannibal: Challenging Rome's Supremacy'' p.91.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Polybius]], Hannibal much later said that when he came upon his father and begged to go with him, Hamilcar agreed and demanded that he swear that as long as he lived he would never be a friend of Rome. There is even an account of him at a very young age (9 years old) begging his father to take him to an overseas war. In the story, Hannibal's father took him up and brought him to a sacrificial chamber. Hamilcar held Hannibal over the fire roaring in the chamber and made him swear that he would never be a friend of Rome. Other sources report that Hannibal told his father, \"I swear so soon as age will permit...I will use fire and steel to arrest the destiny of Rome.\"<ref name=\"dodge\"/><ref>[http://www.reversespins.com/patton.html Reverse Spins] ''Patton, the Second Coming of Hannibal''.</ref> According to the tradition, Hannibal's oath took place in the town of [[Pe\u00f1\u00edscola]], today part of the [[Valencian Community]], Spain.<ref>Hilowitz, Beverley (1974).

Hasdrubal pursued a policy of consolidation of Carthage's Iberian interests, even signing a [[treaty]] with Rome whereby Carthage would not expand north of the [[Ebro]] so long as Rome did not expand south of it.<ref>[[Gavin de Beer|De Beer, Sir Gavin]] (1969).

The Roman scholar [[Livy]] gives a depiction of the young Carthaginian: \"No sooner had he arrived...the old soldiers fancied they saw Hamilcar in his youth given back to them; the same bright look; the same fire in his eye, the same trick of countenance and features. Never was one and the same spirit more skillful to meet opposition, to obey, or to command[.]\"<ref name=\"brainfly1\"/>\n\nLivy also records that Hannibal married a woman of [[Castulo]], a powerful Spanish city closely allied with Carthage.<ref name=\"brainfly1\"/> The Roman [[epic poet]] [[Silius Italicus]] names her as [[Imilce]].<ref>Silius Italicus, ''Punica'', III, 97</ref> Silius suggests a Greek origin for Imilce, but [[Gilbert Charles-Picard]] argued for a Punic heritage based on an etymology from the Semitic root m-l-k ('chief, the 'king').<ref>[[Gilbert Charles-Picard|Picard, Gilbert Charles]](1967), ''Hannibal'' p. 119</ref> Silius also suggests the existence of a son,<ref>Silius Italicus, ''Punica'', III, 63-64</ref> who is otherwise not attested by Livy, [[Polybius]], or [[Appian]].\n\nAfter he assumed command, Hannibal spent two years consolidating his holdings and completing the conquest of Hispania, south of the Ebro.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Dodge|first=Theodore Ayrault|authorlink=Theodore Ayrault Dodge|title=Hannibal: A History of the Art of War Among the Carthaginians and Romans Down to the Battle of Pydna, 168 B.C., with a Detailed Account of the Second Punic War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8nOkDyOwnUC&pg=PA143|year=2004|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81362-7}}, page 143</ref> In his first campaign, Hannibal attacked and stormed the [[Olcades]]' strongest centre, Alithia, which promptly led to their surrender, and brought Punic power close to the River [[Tagus]]. His following campaign in 220 BC was against the [[Vaccaei]] to the west, where he stormed the Vaccaen strongholds of Helmantice and Arbucala. On his return home, laden with many spoils, a coalition of Spanish tribes, led by the [[Carpetani]], attacked, and Hannibal won his first major battlefield success and showed off his tactical skills at the battle of the River Tagus.<ref>Hoyos, D. ''Hannibal's Dynasty: Power and Politics in the Western Mediterranean, 247\u2013183 BC'', pp. 89\u201391, 2003</ref> However, Rome, fearing the growing strength of Hannibal in Iberia, made an alliance with the city of [[Sagunto|Saguntum]], which lay a considerable distance south of the River Ebro and claimed the city as its [[protectorate]]. Hannibal not only perceived this as a breach of the treaty signed with Hasdrubal, but as he was already planning an attack on Rome, this was his way to start the war. So he laid [[siege]] to the city, which fell after eight months.<ref>[[Gavin de Beer|De Beer, Sir Gavin]] (1969). ''Hannibal: Challenging Rome's Supremacy'' p.112-113.</ref>\n\nHannibal sent the booty from Saguntum to Carthage, a shrewd move which gained him much support from the government; Livy records that only [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno II the Great]] spoke against him.<ref name=\"brainfly1\"/> In Rome, the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] reacted to this apparent violation of the treaty by dispatching a delegation to Carthage to demand whether Hannibal had destroyed Saguntum in accordance with orders from Carthage.

He maintained this post for eight years until 221&nbsp;BC. Soon the Romans became aware of an alliance between Carthage and the [[Celts]] of the [[Po Valley]] in [[Northern Italy]]. The Celts were amassing forces to invade farther south in Italy, presumably with Carthaginian backing. Therefore, the Romans preemptively invaded the Po region in 225&nbsp;BC. By 220&nbsp;BC, the Romans had annexed the area as [[Cisalpine Gaul]].<ref>Fagan, Garret G. \"The History of Ancient Rome\". Lecture 13: \"The Second Punic War\". Teaching Company, \"Great Courses\" series.</ref> Hasdrubal was assassinated around the same time (221&nbsp;BC), bringing Hannibal to the fore. It seems that the Romans lulled themselves into a false sense of security, having dealt with the threat of a Gallo-Carthaginian invasion, and perhaps knowing that the original Carthaginian commander had been killed.\n\nHannibal departed [[Cartagena, Spain|New Carthage]] in late spring of 218&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Lancel|first=Serge|authorlink=Serge Lancel|title=Hannibal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uVh2FH-LF4C&pg=PA225|year=1999|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-631-21848-7}}, p. 225</ref> He fought his way through the northern tribes to the foothills of the [[Pyrenees]], subduing the tribes through clever mountain tactics and stubborn fighting.

Hunt responds to this by proposing that Hannibal's Celtic guides purposefully misguided the Carthaginian general.\n\nMost recently, W. C.

Mahaney ''et al''. have concluded that this and other evidence strongly supports the Col de la Traversette as being the 'Hannibalic Route' as had been argued by [[Gavin de Beer]] in 1974. De Beer was one of only three interpreters \u2013 the others being John Lazenby and Jakob Seibert \u2013 to have visited all the Alpine high passes and presented a view on which was most plausible. Both De Beer and Siebert had selected the Col de la Traversette as the one most closely matching the ancient descriptions.<ref>de Beer, S. G., 1974, Hannibal: The struggle for power in the Mediterranean, Book Club Associates, London.</ref> [[Polybius]] wrote that Hannibal had crossed the highest of the Alpine passes: Col de la Traversette, between the upper Guil valley and the upper Po river is the highest pass. It is moreover the most southerly, as [[Varro]] in his ''De re rustica'' relates, agreeing that Hannibal's Pass was the highest in Western Alps and the most southerly. Mahaney ''et al''. argue that factors used by De Beer to support Col de la Traversette including \"gauging ancient place names against modern, close scrutiny of times of flood in major rivers and distant viewing of the Po plains\" taken together with \"massive radiocarbon and microbiological and parasitical evidence\" from the alluvial sediments either side of the pass furnish \"supporting evidence, proof if you will\" that Hannibal's invasion went that way.<ref>W.

G., 1969, Hannibal: Challenging Rome's supremacy, Viking, New York, NY. pp. 163-180</ref>\n\nBy Livy's account, the crossing was accomplished in the face of huge difficulties.<ref>Livy History of Rome book21,36</ref> These Hannibal surmounted with ingenuity, such as when he used [[fire-setting|vinegar and fire]] to break through a rockfall.<ref>Livy History of Rome, Book 21 sections 32\u201336</ref> According to Polybius, he arrived in Italy accompanied by 20,000-foot soldiers, 4,000 horsemen, and only a few elephants. The fired rockfall event is mentioned only by Livy; Polybius is mute on the subject and there is no evidence<ref>Mahaney, W.C., et al., 2009. \"The Traversette rockfall: geomorphological reconstruction and importance in interpreting classical history.\" Archaeometry, v. 52, no. 1, pp. 156\u2013172.</ref> of carbonized rock at the only two-tier rockfall in the Western Alps, located below the [[Col de la Traversette]] (Mahaney, 2008). If Polybius is correct in his figure for the number of troops that he commanded after the crossing of the Rh\u00f4ne, this would suggest that he had lost almost half of his force. Historians such as Serge Lancell have questioned the reliability of the figures for the number of troops that he had when he left Hispania.<ref>S. Lancel, ''Hannibal'' (1995; English translation 1999) page 60.</ref> From the start, he seems to have calculated that he would have to operate without aid from Hispania.\n\nHannibal's vision of military affairs was derived partly from the teaching of his Greek tutors and partly from experience gained alongside his father, and it stretched over most of the Hellenistic World of his time. Indeed, the breadth of his vision gave rise to his grand strategy of conquering Rome by opening a northern front and subduing allied city-states on the peninsula, rather than by attacking Rome directly. Historical events which led to the defeat of Carthage during the First Punic War when his father commanded the Carthaginian Army also led Hannibal to plan the invasion of Italy by land across the Alps.\n\nThe task was daunting, to say the least. It involved the mobilization of between 60,000 and 100,000 troops and the training of a war-elephant corps, all of which had to be provisioned along the way. The alpine invasion of Italy was a military operation that would shake the Mediterranean World of 218&nbsp;BC with repercussions for more than two decades.\n\n===Battle of Trebia===\n{{Main|Battle of the Trebia}}\n[[File:Battle trebia.gif|thumb|right|300px|A diagram depicting the tactics used in the [[Battle of the Trebia]]]]\nHannibal's perilous march brought him into the Roman territory and frustrated the attempts of the enemy to fight out the main issue on foreign ground. His sudden appearance among the [[Gaul]]s of the Po Valley, moreover, enabled him to detach those tribes from their new allegiance to the Romans before the Romans could take steps to check the rebellion. [[Publius Cornelius Scipio (consul 218 BC)|Publius Cornelius Scipio]] was the consul who commanded the Roman force sent to intercept Hannibal (he was also the father of Scipio Africanus). He had not expected Hannibal to make an attempt to cross the Alps, since the Romans were prepared to fight the war in the Iberian Peninsula. With a small detachment still positioned in Gaul, Scipio made an attempt to intercept Hannibal. He succeeded, through prompt decision and speedy movement, in transporting his army to Italy by sea in time to meet Hannibal. Hannibal's forces moved through the Po Valley and were engaged in the [[Battle of Ticinus]]. Here, Hannibal forced the Romans to evacuate the plain of [[Lombardy]], by virtue of his superior [[cavalry]].<ref name=\"dodge_old\">[[Theodore Ayrault Dodge|Dodge, Theodore]]. ''Hannibal''. Cambridge Massachusetts: De Capo Press, 1891 {{ISBN|0-306-81362-9}}</ref> The victory was minor, but it encouraged the Gauls and Ligurians to join the Carthaginian cause, whose troops bolstered his army back to around 40,000 men. Scipio was severely injured, his life only saved by the bravery of his son who rode back onto the field to rescue his fallen father. Scipio retreated across the Trebia to camp at [[Piacenza|Placentia]] with his army mostly intact.<ref name=\"dodge_old\" />\n\nThe other [[Roman consul]]ar army was rushed to the Po Valley. Even before news of the defeat at Ticinus had reached Rome, the Senate had ordered Consul [[Tiberius Sempronius Longus (consul 218 BC)|Tiberius Sempronius Longus]] to bring his army back from Sicily to meet Scipio and face Hannibal. Hannibal, by skillful maneuvers, was in position to head him off, for he lay on the direct road between Placentia and Arminum, by which Sempronius would have to march to reinforce Scipio. He then captured Clastidium, from which he drew large amounts of supplies for his men. But this gain was not without loss, as Sempronius avoided Hannibal's watchfulness, slipped around his flank, and joined his colleague in his camp near the [[Trebbia|Trebia River]] near [[Piacenza|Placentia]]. There Hannibal had an opportunity to show his masterful military skill at the Trebia in December of the same year, after wearing down the superior Roman [[infantry]], when he cut it to pieces with a surprise attack and ambush from the flanks.\n\n===Battle of Lake Trasimene===\n{{Main|Battle of Lake Trasimene}}\nHannibal quartered his troops for the winter with the Gauls, whose support for him had abated. In the spring of 217&nbsp;BC, Hannibal decided to find a more reliable base of operations farther south. Gnaeus Servilius and Gaius Flaminius (the new consuls of Rome) were expecting Hannibal to advance on Rome, and they took their armies to block the eastern and western routes that Hannibal could use.<ref>Polybius, ''Histories'', Book III, 77</ref>\n[[File:Battle of lake trasimene.gif|right|300px|thumb|[[Battle of Lake Trasimene]], 217&nbsp;BC.<br />From the Department of History, United States Military Academy]]\nThe only alternative route to central Italy lay at the mouth of the [[Arno]]. This area was practically one huge marsh, and happened to be overflowing more than usual during this particular season. Hannibal knew that this route was full of difficulties, but it remained the surest and certainly the quickest way to central Italy. [[Polybius]] claims that Hannibal's men marched for four days and three nights, \"through a land that was under water\", suffering terribly from fatigue and enforced want of sleep. He crossed without opposition over both the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] (during which he lost his right eye<ref>{{cite book |author1=John Selby Watson |author2=Marcus Junianus |author3=Justinus, Cornelius |author4=Nepos, Eutropius | url = https://archive.org/details/justincornelius00watsgoog |quote=hannibal greatest. | title = Justin, Cornelius Nepos, and Eutropius: Literally Translated, with Notes | year = 1853 | publisher = H.

As Polybius recounts, \"he [Hannibal] calculated that, if he passed the camp and made a descent into the district beyond, Flaminius (partly for fear of popular reproach and partly of personal irritation) would be unable to endure watching passively the devastation of the country but would spontaneously follow him... and give him opportunities for attack.\"<ref>[[B. H. Liddell Hart|Liddell Hart, B. H.]], ''Strategy'', New York City, New York, Penguin Group, 1967</ref> At the same time, Hannibal tried to break the allegiance of Rome's allies by proving that Flaminius was powerless to protect them. Despite this, Flaminius remained passively encamped at Arretium. Hannibal marched boldly around Flaminius' left flank, unable to draw him into battle by mere devastation, and effectively cut him off from Rome (thus executing the first recorded [[turning movement]] in military history). He then advanced through the uplands of [[Etruria]], provoking Flaminius into a hasty pursuit and catching him in a [[defile (geography)|defile]] on the shore of [[Lake Trasimeno|Lake Trasimenus]]. There Hannibal destroyed Flaminius' army in the waters or on the adjoining slopes, killing Flaminius as well (see [[Battle of Lake Trasimene]]). This was the most costly ambush that the Romans ever sustained until the [[Battle of Carrhae]] against the [[Parthian Empire]].\n\nHannibal had now disposed of the only field force that could check his advance upon Rome, but he realized that, without [[siege engine]]s, he could not hope to take the capital. He preferred to exploit his victory by entering into central and southern Italy and encouraging a general revolt against the sovereign power.<ref>[http://www.iwar.org.uk/military/resources/hannibal/Parker_J_P_01.pdf USAWC] ''Comparing Strategies of the 2nd Punic War'' by James Parker.

Departing from Roman military traditions, Fabius adopted the [[Fabian strategy|strategy named after him]], avoiding open battle while placing several Roman armies in Hannibal's vicinity in order to watch and limit his movements.\n\nHannibal ravaged Apulia but was unable to bring Fabius to battle, so he decided to march through [[Samnium]] to [[Campania]], one of the richest and most fertile provinces of Italy, hoping that the devastation would draw Fabius into battle. Fabius closely followed Hannibal's path of destruction, yet still refused to let himself be drawn out of the defensive. This strategy was unpopular with many Romans, who believed that it was a form of cowardice.\n\nHannibal decided that it would be unwise to winter in the already devastated lowlands of Campania, but Fabius had ensured that all the passes were blocked out of Campania. To avoid this, Hannibal deceived the Romans into thinking that the Carthaginian army was going to escape through the woods. As the Romans moved off towards the woods, Hannibal's army occupied the pass, and then made their way through the pass unopposed. Fabius was within striking distance but in this case his caution worked against him. Smelling a stratagem (rightly), he stayed put. For the winter, Hannibal found comfortable quarters in the [[Apulia]]n plain. What Hannibal achieved in extricating his army was, as [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] puts it, \"a classic of ancient generalship, finding its way into nearly every historical narrative of the war and being used by later military manuals\".<ref>Goldsworthy, Adrian K. ''The Roman Army at War 100 BC&nbsp;\u2014 AD 200'', New York</ref> This was a severe blow to Fabius' prestige and soon after this his period of dictatorial power ended.\n\n===Battle of Cannae===\n[[File:Battle cannae destruction.gif|right|thumb|330px|Destruction of the Roman army (red), courtesy of the Department of History, United States Military Academy]]{{Main|Battle of Cannae}}\nIn the spring of 216&nbsp;BC, Hannibal took the initiative and seized the large supply depot at Cannae in the Apulian plain. By capturing Cannae, Hannibal had placed himself between the Romans and their crucial sources of supply.<ref name=\"polybius\">{{cite web| url = http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/polybius-cannae.html | title = Internet Ancient History Sourcebook}}</ref> Once the Roman Senate resumed their consular elections in 216&nbsp;BC, they appointed [[Gaius Terentius Varro]] and [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 219 BC)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]] as [[Roman consul|consuls]]. In the meantime, the Romans hoped to gain success through sheer strength and weight of numbers, and they raised a new army of unprecedented size, estimated by some to be as large as 100,000 men, but more likely around 50\u201380,000.<ref name=\"cottrell\">Cottrell, Leonard, ''Enemy of Rome'', Evans Bros, 1965, {{ISBN|0-237-44320-1}}</ref>\n\nThe Romans and allied legions resolved to confront Hannibal and marched southward to [[Apulia]]. They eventually found him on the left bank of the Aufidus River, and encamped {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} away. On this occasion, the two armies were combined into one, the consuls having to alternate their command on a daily basis. Varro was in command on the first day, a man of reckless and hubristic nature (according to Livy) and determined to defeat Hannibal.<ref name=\"cottrell\"/> Hannibal capitalized on the eagerness of Varro and drew him into a trap by using an [[Pincer movement|envelopment tactic]]. This eliminated the Roman numerical advantage by shrinking the combat area. Hannibal drew up his least reliable infantry in a semicircle in the center with the wings composed of the Gallic and Numidian horse.<ref name=\"cottrell\"/> The Roman legions forced their way through Hannibal's weak center, but the Libyan mercenaries on the wings, swung around by the movement, menaced their flanks. The onslaught of Hannibal's cavalry was irresistible. Hannibal's chief cavalry commander [[Maharbal]] led the mobile [[Numidian cavalry]] on the right, and they shattered the Roman cavalry opposing them. Hannibal's Iberian and Gallic heavy cavalry, led by Hanno on the left, defeated the Roman heavy cavalry, and then both the Carthaginian heavy cavalry and the Numidians attacked the legions from behind. As a result, the Roman army was hemmed in with no means of escape.\n\nDue to these brilliant tactics, Hannibal managed to surround and destroy all but a small remnant of his enemy, despite his own inferior numbers. Depending upon the source, it is estimated that 50,000\u201370,000 Romans were killed or captured.<ref name=\"dodge\" /> Among the dead were Roman Consul [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 219 BC)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]], as well as two consuls for the preceding year, two [[quaestor]]s, twenty-nine out of the forty-eight [[military tribune]]s, and an additional eighty senators (at a time when the Roman Senate was composed of no more than 300 men, this constituted 25%\u201330% of the governing body). This makes the battle one of the most catastrophic defeats in the history of [[Ancient Rome]], and one of the bloodiest battles in all of human history (in terms of the number of lives lost within a single day).<ref name=\"cottrell\"/>\n\nAfter Cannae, the Romans were very hesitant to confront Hannibal in pitched battle, preferring instead to weaken him by attrition, relying on their advantages of interior lines, supply, and manpower. As a result, Hannibal fought no more major battles in Italy for the rest of the war. It is believed that his refusal to bring the war to Rome itself was due to a lack of commitment from Carthage of men, money, and material&nbsp;\u2014 principally siege equipment. Whatever the reason, the choice prompted Maharbal to say, \"Hannibal, you know how to gain a victory, but not how to use one.\"<ref>Prevas, John, ''Hannibal Crosses the Alps'', p.

Hannibal also secured an alliance with newly appointed [[tyrant]] [[Hieronymus of Syracuse]]. It is often argued that, if Hannibal had received proper material reinforcements from Carthage, he might have succeeded with a direct attack upon Rome. Instead, he had to content himself with subduing the fortresses that still held out against him, and the only other notable event of 216&nbsp;BC was the defection of certain Italian territories, including [[Capua]], the second largest city of Italy, which Hannibal made his new base. However, only a few of the Italian city-states that he had expected to gain as allies defected to him.\n\n===Stalemate===\nThe war in Italy settled into a strategic stalemate. The Romans used the [[Attrition warfare|attritional]] strategy that Fabius had taught them, and which, they finally realized, was the only feasible means of defeating Hannibal.<ref>Prevas, John, ''Hannibal Crosses the Alps: The Invasion of Italy and the Second Punic War'', p.

His immediate objectives were reduced to minor operations centered mainly round the cities of [[Campania]].\n\nThe forces detached to his lieutenants were generally unable to hold their own, and neither his home government nor his new ally Philip V of Macedon helped to make up his losses. His position in southern Italy, therefore, became increasingly difficult and his chance of ultimately conquering Rome grew ever more remote. Hannibal still won a number of notable victories: completely destroying two Roman armies in 212&nbsp;BC, and killing two consuls (including the famed [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]]) in a battle in 208&nbsp;BC. However, Hannibal slowly began losing ground\u2014inadequately supported by his Italian allies, abandoned by his government (either because of jealousy or simply because Carthage was overstretched), and unable to match Rome's resources. He was never able to bring about another grand decisive victory that could produce a lasting strategic change.\n\nCarthaginian political will was embodied in the ruling oligarchy. There was a Carthaginian Senate, but the real power was with the inner \"[[Council of 30 Nobles]]\" and the board of judges from ruling families known as the \"[[Hundred and Four]]\". These two bodies came from the wealthy, commercial families of Carthage. Two political factions operated in Carthage: the war party, also known as the \"[[Barcid]]s\" (Hannibal's family name); and the peace party led by [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno II the Great]]. Hanno had been instrumental in denying Hannibal's requested reinforcements following the battle at Cannae.\n\nHannibal started the war without the full backing of Carthaginian oligarchy. His attack of Saguntum had presented the oligarchy with a choice of war with Rome or loss of prestige in Iberia. The oligarchy, not Hannibal, controlled the strategic resources of Carthage. Hannibal constantly sought reinforcements from either Iberia or North Africa. Hannibal's troops who were lost in combat were replaced with less well-trained and motivated mercenaries from Italy or Gaul. The commercial interests of the Carthaginian oligarchy dictated the reinforcement and supply of Iberia rather than Hannibal throughout the campaign.\n\n===Hannibal's retreat in Italy===\n[[File:Escipi\u00f3n africano.JPG|thumb|upright|Bust of [[Scipio Africanus]] from the [[Villa of the Papyri]]]]\nIn March 212&nbsp;BC, Hannibal [[Battle of Tarentum (212 BC)|captured]] [[Taranto|Tarentum]] in a surprise attack but he failed to obtain control of its harbour. The tide was slowly turning against him, and in favor of Rome.\n\nThe Roman consuls mounted a [[Battle of Capua|siege of Capua]] in 212 BC. Hannibal attacked them, forcing their withdrawal from Campania. He moved to Lucania and destroyed a 16,000-man Roman army at the [[Battle of the Silarus]], with 15,000 Romans killed. Another opportunity presented itself soon after, a Roman army of 18,000 men being destroyed by Hannibal at the [[Battle of Herdonia (212 BC)|first battle of Herdonia]] with 16,000 Roman dead, freeing Apulia from the Romans for the year. The Roman consuls mounted another [[Battle of Capua (211 BC)|siege of Capua]] in 211&nbsp;BC, conquering the city. Hannibal attempted to lift the siege with an assault on the Roman siege lines but failed. He marched on Rome to force the recall of the Roman armies. He drew off 15,000 Roman soldiers, but the siege continued and Capua fell. In 212 BC, Marcellus [[Siege of Syracuse (213\u2013212 BC)|conquered]] Syracuse and the Romans destroyed the Carthaginian army in Sicily in 211\u2013210 BC. In 210 BC, the Romans entered into an alliance with the [[Aetolian League]] to counter [[Philip V of Macedon]]. Philip, who attempted to exploit Rome's preoccupation in Italy to conquer [[Illyria]], now found himself under attack from several sides at once and was quickly subdued by Rome and her Greek allies.\n\nIn 210&nbsp;BC, Hannibal again proved his superiority in tactics by inflicting a severe defeat at the [[Battle of Herdonia (210 BC)|Battle of Herdonia]] (modern [[Ordona]]) in Apulia upon a [[proconsul]]ar army and, in 208&nbsp;BC, destroyed a Roman force engaged in the siege of [[Locri]] at the [[Battle of Petelia]]. But with the loss of Tarentum in 209&nbsp;BC and the gradual reconquest by the Romans of [[Samnium]] and [[Lucania]], his hold on south Italy was almost lost. In 207&nbsp;BC, he succeeded in making his way again into Apulia, where he waited to concert measures for a combined march upon Rome with his brother [[Hasdrubal Barca|Hasdrubal]]. On hearing, however, of his brother's defeat and death at the [[battle of the Metaurus]], he retired to [[Calabria]], where he maintained himself for the ensuing years. His brother's head had been cut off, carried across Italy, and tossed over the palisade of Hannibal's camp as a cold message of the iron-clad will of the Roman Republic. The combination of these events marked the end to Hannibal's success in Italy. With the failure of his brother Mago in [[Liguria]] (205\u2013203&nbsp;BC) and of his own negotiations with Phillip V, the last hope of recovering his ascendancy in Italy was lost. In 203&nbsp;BC, after nearly fifteen years of fighting in Italy, and with the military fortunes of Carthage rapidly declining, Hannibal was recalled to Carthage to direct the defense of his native country against a Roman invasion under Scipio Africanus.\n\n{{anchor|Conclusion of the Second Punic War}}\n\n==Conclusion of the Second Punic War (203\u2013201 BC)==\n{{anchor|Return}}\n\n===Return to Carthage===\n[[File:Campagna africana di Scipione 202 aC.png|thumb|left|upright=2.0|Final act of the Second Punic War with the [[battle of Zama]] (202 BC)]]\n\nIn 203&nbsp;BC, Hannibal was recalled from Italy by the war party in Carthage. After leaving a record of his expedition engraved in [[Punic language|Punic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] upon bronze tablets in the temple of [[Juno Lacinia]] at [[Crotone|Crotona]], he sailed back to Africa.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12582/12582-h/12582-h.htm#b46 |title=28.46 |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=11 June 2004 |accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref> His arrival immediately restored the predominance of the war party, which placed him in command of a combined force of [[Africa]]n [[conscription|levies]] and his mercenaries from Italy. In 202&nbsp;BC, Hannibal met Scipio in a fruitless peace conference. Despite mutual admiration, negotiations floundered due to Roman allegations of \"Punic Faith,\" referring to the breach of protocols that ended the First Punic War by the Carthaginian attack on Saguntum, and a Carthaginan attack on a stranded Roman fleet. Scipio and Carthage had worked out a peace plan, which was approved by Rome. The terms of the treaty were quite modest, but the war had been long for the Romans. Carthage could keep its African territory but would lose its overseas empire. Masinissa ([[Numidia]]) was to be independent. Also, Carthage was to reduce its fleet and pay a war indemnity. But Carthage then made a terrible blunder. Its long-suffering citizens had captured a stranded Roman fleet in the [[Gulf of Tunis]] and stripped it of supplies, an action that aggravated the faltering negotiations. Meanwhile, Hannibal, recalled from Italy by the Carthaginian Senate, had returned with his army. Fortified by both Hannibal and the supplies, the Carthaginians rebuffed the treaty and Roman protests. The decisive [[battle of Zama]] soon followed; the defeat removed Hannibal's air of invincibility.\n\n===Battle of Zama (202 BC)===\n{{Main|Battle of Zama}}\nUnlike most battles of the [[Second Punic War]], at Zama, the Romans were superior in cavalry and the Carthaginians had the edge in infantry. This Roman cavalry superiority was due to the betrayal of [[Masinissa]], who had earlier assisted Carthage in Iberia, but changed sides in 206&nbsp;BC with the promise of land and due to his personal conflicts with [[Syphax]], a Carthaginian ally. Although the aging Hannibal was suffering from mental exhaustion and deteriorating health after years of campaigning in Italy, the Carthaginians still had the advantage in numbers and were boosted by the presence of 80 war elephants.<!-- 80 elephants, cited to sources by main article -->\n\n[[File:Slaget ved Zama - Cornelis Cort, 1567.jpg|right|thumb|Engraving of the [[Battle of Zama]] by [[Cornelis Cort]], 1567. Note that [[Asian elephant]]s are illustrated rather than the very small [[North African elephant]]s used by Carthage.]]\n\nThe Roman cavalry won an early victory by swiftly routing the Carthaginian horse, and standard Roman tactics for limiting the effectiveness of the Carthaginian war elephants were successful, including playing trumpets to frighten the elephants into running into the Carthaginian lines. Some historians say that the elephants routed the Carthaginian cavalry and not the Romans, whilst others suggest that it was actually a tactical retreat planned by Hannibal.<ref>Scullard, H.H.

At one point, it seemed that Hannibal was on the verge of victory, but Scipio was able to rally his men, and his cavalry, having routed the Carthaginian cavalry, attacked Hannibal's rear. This two-pronged attack caused the Carthaginian formation to collapse.\n\nWith their foremost general defeated, the Carthaginians had no choice but to surrender. Carthage lost approximately 20,000 troops with an additional 15,000 wounded. In contrast, the Romans suffered only 2,500 casualties. The last major battle of the Second Punic War resulted in a loss of respect for Hannibal by his fellow Carthaginians. The conditions of defeat were such that Carthage could no longer battle for Mediterranean supremacy.\n\n==Later career==\n{{anchor|Peacetime Carthage}}\n[[File:Carthage Tetradrachm Tanit &amp; Horse, with a Serrated Edge.

They considered him the greatest enemy Rome had ever faced. [[Livy]] gives us the idea that Hannibal was extremely cruel. Even [[Cicero]], when he talked of Rome and its two great enemies, spoke of the \"honourable\" [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] and the \"cruel\" Hannibal. Yet a different picture sometimes emerges. When Hannibal's successes had brought about the death of two [[Roman consul]]s, he vainly searched for the body of [[Gaius Flaminius]] on the shores of [[Lake Trasimeno|Lake Trasimene]], held ceremonial rituals in recognition of [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (General)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]], and sent [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus|Marcellus]]' ashes back to his family in Rome. Any bias attributed to [[Polybius]], however, is more troublesome. [[Ronald J. Mellor|Ronald Mellor]] considered the Greek scholar a loyal partisan of [[Scipio Aemilianus]],<ref>[[Ronald J. Mellor|Mellor, Ronald J.]] ''The Historians of Ancient Rome''</ref> while H.

According to [[Appian]], several years after the Second Punic War, Hannibal served as a political advisor in the Seleucid Kingdom and [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio]] arrived there on a diplomatic mission from Rome.\n{{quote|It is said that at one of their meetings in the gymnasium Scipio and Hannibal had a conversation on the subject of generalship, in the presence of a number of bystanders, and that Scipio asked Hannibal whom he considered the greatest general, to which the latter replied, \"[[Alexander the Great|Alexander of Macedonia]]\".\n\nTo this Scipio assented since he also yielded the first place to Alexander. Then he asked Hannibal whom he placed next, and he replied, \"[[Pyrrhus of Epirus]]\", because he considered boldness the first qualification of a general; \"for it would not be possible\", he said, \"to find two kings more enterprising than these\".\n\nScipio was rather nettled by this, but nevertheless he asked Hannibal to whom he would give the third place, expecting that at least the third would be assigned to him; but Hannibal replied, \"to myself; for when I was a young man I conquered Hispania and crossed the Alps with an army, the first after [[Hercules]].\"\n\nAs Scipio saw that he was likely to prolong his self-laudation he said, laughing, \"where would you place yourself, Hannibal, if you had not been defeated by me?\" Hannibal, now perceiving his jealousy, replied, \"in that case I should have put myself before Alexander\". Thus Hannibal continued his self-laudation, but flattered Scipio in an indirect manner by suggesting that he had conquered one who was the superior of Alexander.\n\nAt the end of this conversation Hannibal invited Scipio to be his guest, and Scipio replied that he would be so gladly if Hannibal were not living with [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus]], who was held in suspicion by the Romans. Thus did they, in a manner worthy of great commanders, cast aside their enmity at the end of their wars.<ref name=\"appian\">Appian, ''History of the Syrian Wars'', \u00a710 and \u00a711 at [https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_syriaca_02.html Livius.org]</ref>}}\n\nMilitary academies all over the world continue to study Hannibal's exploits, especially his victory at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]].<ref>{{cite document | title=THE INFLUENCE OF HANNIBAL OF CARTHAGE ON THE ART OF WAR AND HOW HIS LEGACY HAS BEEN INTERPRETED | author=RICK JAY MESSER|citeseerx = 10.1.1.582.1385}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hannibal in Italy by Jacopo Ripanda - Sala di Annibale - Palazzo dei Conservatori - Musei Capitolini - Rome 2016 (2).jpg|thumb|right| Hannibal's celebrated feat in crossing the Alps with [[war elephant]]s passed into European legend: detail of a fresco by [[Jacopo Ripanda]], {{circa | 1510}}, [[Capitoline Museums]], [[Rome]].]]\n\nMaximilian Otto Bismarck Caspari, in his article in the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] (1910-1911), praises Hannibal in these words:\n{{quotation|As to the transcendent military genius of Hannibal there cannot be two opinions. The man who for fifteen years could hold his ground in a hostile country against several powerful armies and a succession of able generals must have been a commander and a [[:wikt:tactician|tactician]] of supreme capacity. In the use of strategies and [[ambush|ambuscades]] he certainly surpassed all other generals of antiquity. Wonderful as his achievements were, we must marvel the more when we take into account the grudging support he received from Carthage. As his veterans melted away, he had to organize fresh levies on the spot. We never hear of a mutiny in his army, composed though it was of North Africans, Iberians and [[Gauls]]. Again, all we know of him comes for the most part from hostile sources. The Romans feared and hated him so much that they could not do him justice. Livy speaks of his great qualities, but he adds that his vices were equally great, among which he singles out his more than Punic perfidy and an inhuman cruelty. For the first there would seem to be no further justification than that he was consummately skillful in the use of ambuscades. For the latter there is, we believe, no more ground than that at certain crises he acted in the general spirit of ancient warfare. Sometimes he contrasts most favorably with his enemy. No such brutality stains his name as that perpetrated by [[Gaius Claudius Nero]] on the vanquished [[Hasdrubal Barca|Hasdrubal]]. Polybius merely says that he was accused of cruelty by the Romans and of avarice by the Carthaginians. He had indeed bitter enemies, and his life was one continuous struggle against destiny.

Constantly overmatched by better soldiers, led by generals always respectable, often of great ability, he yet defied all their efforts to drive him from Italy, for half a generation. Excepting in the case of Alexander, and some few isolated instances, all wars up to the Second Punic War, had been decided largely, if not entirely, by battle-tactics. Strategic ability had been comprehended only on a minor scale. Armies had marched towards each other, had fought in parallel order, and the conqueror had imposed terms on his opponent. Any variation from this rule consisted in ambuscades or other stratagems. That war could be waged by avoiding in lieu of seeking battle; that the results of a victory could be earned by attacks upon the enemy's communications, by flank-maneuvers, by seizing positions from which safely to threaten him in case he moved, and by other devices of strategy, was not understood... [However] For the first time in the history of war, we see two contending generals avoiding each other, occupying impregnable camps on heights, marching about each other's flanks to seize cities or supplies in their rear, harassing each other with small-war, and rarely venturing on a battle which might prove a fatal disaster\u2014all with a well-conceived purpose of placing his opponent at a strategic disadvantage... That it did so was due to the teaching of Hannibal.<ref name=\"dodge\" />}}\n\n===Other===\nHannibal is the \"hero\" of teenager [[Sigmund Freud]]. His idealized image is reflected in the analysis by the founder of [[psychoanalysis]] of his \"dreams of Rome\" in ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]''.

The affinity group's leader generally send a personal written communication to the affinity group membership to strengthen credibility and the members' confidence in the product.  Other marketing such as newsletters and electronic social media marketing are also used.\n* \"The shared incentives concept\"<ref name=\"macchiette\" /> describes the main motivations facing the affinity group and the organizations involved. Promoting prescription discount cards and medical negotiation services to an affinity group that was created to promote lower healthcare costs is an example.\n* \"The enhancement package\"<ref name=\"macchiette\" /> consists in designing the product in a way that it meets exactly the consumer's needs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fock|first1=Henry|title=Member\u2013organization connection impacts in affinity marketing|journal=Journal of Business Research|date=July 2011|volume=64 | issue = 7 |pages=672\u2013679|doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2010.08.015}}</ref> Knowing the consumers potential to purchase a specific product is key to the success of the campaign.  Similar to the above example, a package of medical service savings coupons and discounts as well as prescription discount cards and coupons sold to the members that are known to struggle with the high cost of insurance and healthcare would be considered and enhancement package.  This may differ from the above, shared incentive concept, in that this medical savings package is valuable to members of affinity groups regardless of the stated purpose of the affinity group.\n\nThe example of prescription discount cards used by football teams' fans help to figure out affinity marketing's characteristics. The first feature as it is stated above is the third party endorsement. In this case, the fact of endorsement by using the club's logo is just considered an endorsement and is passively marketed through newsletters and possibly sponsorship signage and mentions as a means to advertise.\n\nIt is only when the affinity group is actively involved in marketing the product that this becomes an example of the second affinity marketing features anan shared incentive type of marketing. The team's manager or captain sends a personalized letter to his fans spurring them to use the prescription discount card. Possibly electronic direct marketing  and telephonic marketing can be used to increase utilization of the card. The affinity group receives a share of the revenue generated by the use of the card and are therefore incentivised and motivated to continue the marketing and advertisement campaigns, creating further utilization  of the card. Then, the second feature i the shared incentives concept which can be in this example the utilization of the credit card and the enhancement of the brand fidelity for the bank.  The football team for its part, benefits from profit share, more games and products sales. Finally, the enhancement package can consist of loyalty rewards distributed after using the card a certain number of times.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Swayne|first1=Linda|last2=Dodds|first2=Mark|title=Encyclopedia of sports management and marketing|date=2011|publisher=SAGE Publications|pages=1960}}</ref> as well as the former two concepts\n\n== Benefits ==\nThere are plenty of benefits for all bodies when employing an affinity marketing strategy.\n\n===Suppliers===\nThe supplier sells at lower price his products because he reduces his expenses in marketing research. He also profits from the customer's increase in fidelity. By joining the affinity partner, the supplier strengthens his reputation. Furthermore, he knows better his target audience simplified by the fact that he has access to the affinity group's information and has the opportunity to carry out some research programs with its members.\n\n===Affinity groups===\nEach affinity group is seeking for different advantages. But usually, affinity groups increase their income by asking a commission for example. Affinity groups have also a better connection and affinity with their members. Finally, they protect and enhance their reputation without taking any risks as well as avoiding the costs involved in [[merchandising]] directly the [[Product (business)|product]] or [[Service (economics)|service]].\n\n===Customers ===\nSuppliers and affinity groups are not the only parties profiting from this marketing scheme. End-consumers benefit from it, but their benefits depend on the nature of the affinity partner (charitable organization) and the nature of the product or service sold. Again, generally customers are directly satisfied to profit from extra discounts for example, and they become more confident in their choices because of the partnership between their affinity group and the company. Furthermore, they benefit from products and services that have been designed and manufactured especially for them.<ref name=\"consultaffinity\" />\n\n==Failure and limitations==\nWhen employing an affinity marketing program it is not always assured that the scheme is going to succeed. It is due to the fact that some organizations totally refuse to endorse the brand of a company and consider such a partnership as a violation of their dignity. A total affinity marketing scheme failure is also explained by a bad timing in the sense that some companies choose to target the customers at the wrong time. For example, summer and Christmas are not the right moments to focus on pupils and academic staff because of the holiday. Another reason for this lack of success is that the target audience's income is not sufficient for the products offered. Moreover, many affinity marketing efforts fail to tailor the promoted goods and services to that affinity group's specific needs.<ref name=\"macchiette\" />\n\n==In e-commerce==\nIn the context of [[e-commerce]], affinity marketing consists in sharing referrals by promoting [[icons]] and [[Hyperlink|links]] connected to other websites that meet the customers' needs. The aim of employing affinity marketing schemes on the internet is to increase sales, enhance website visibility, encourage traffic. Search engines are involved in affinity marketing by selling links when users type keywords. As e-commerce websites tend to increasingly segment the market, some applications analyze the customers' online conduct in order to personalize them and offer them tailored products.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Emigh|first1=Jacqueline|title=Affinity marketing|journal=Computerworld|date=Sep 27, 1999|volume=64}}</ref>\n\n==Market segmentation==\nHaving an essential function in affinity marketing, the nature of the individual's common bond is indispensable for understanding the concept. In other words, it is important to know in what way or manner the relationship was built and to know to which [[affinity group]] the customer belongs.<ref name=customerservice/> When segmenting the market, the affinity marketers also need to take into account the purpose of the Affinity Group's existence, any other [http://www.affiliate-programs.biz/ Affiliate Program], the number of people who are composing the group, the nature of the people in the group, members' solvency and the receptivity to the goods and services offered. Further, in analyzing affinity [[marketing]] one needs to acknowledge the power and nature of affinity.<ref name=\"macchiette\" /> An affinity marketing strategy is focused on one of the four different aspects of affinity. First, affinity is related to the support of a deserving cause. Second, affinity is based on relationships creating a sense of recognition in an organization that doesn't necessary have to exist (for instance a country, a family or an animal).  Third, affinity comes from a sense of desiring to be part of a dissimilar social group (aspirational). Last, affinity is correlated to the wish for personally acquiring discounts, or privileges from goods and services sold by a specific organization (self-interest). This group may include [http://kyoba.boxlake.com/Views/public/Content.aspx?page_id=184 Captive Associations] such as some State Bar Associations which make membership mandatory, [[doi:10.1111/j.1467-9442.2012.01694.x|Professional and Trade Unions]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goerke|first=Laszlo|last2=Pannenberg|first2=Markus|date=2012-04-20|title=Risk Aversion and Trade-Union Membership*|journal=The Scandinavian Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=114|issue=2|pages=275\u2013295|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9442.2012.01694.x|issn=0347-0520|hdl=10419/150637|url=http://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.79230.de/diw_sp0088.pdf}}</ref> other Professional Associations such as Realtor  Associations where they are not captive but membership is compelled by controlling access to tools and support essential to their work. A few affinity groups use more than one of these facets to achieve their marketing scheme.

In this case, the fact of endorsement by using the club's logo is just considered an endorsement and is passively marketed through newsletters and possibly sponsorship signage and mentions as a means to advertise.  \n\nIt is only when the affinity group is actively involved in marketing the product that this becomes an example of the second affinity marketing features anan shared incentive type of marketing. The team's manager or captain sends a personalized letter to his fans spurring them to use the prescription discount card. Possibly electronic direct marketing  and telephonic marketing can be used to increase utilization of the card. The affinity group receives a share of the revenue generated by the use of the card and are therefor incentivised and motivated to continue the marketing and advertisement campaigns, creating further utilization  of the card. Then, the second feature i the shared incentives concept which can be in this example the utilization of the credit card and the enhancement of the brand fidelity for the bank.  The football team for its part, benefits from profit share, more games and products sales. Finally, the enhancement package can consist of loyalty rewards distributed after using the card a certain number of times.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Swayne|first1=Linda|last2=Dodds|first2=Mark|title=Encyclopedia of sports management and marketing|date=2011|publisher=SAGE Publications|pages=1960}}</ref> as well as the former two concepts\n\n== Benefits ==\nThere are plenty of benefits for all bodies when employing an affinity marketing strategy.\n\n===Suppliers===\nThe supplier sells at lower price his products because he reduces his expenses in marketing research. He also profits from the customer's increase in fidelity. By joining the affinity partner, the supplier strengthens his reputation. Furthermore, he knows better his target audience simplified by the fact that he has access to the affinity group's information and has the opportunity to carry out some research programs with its members.\n\n===Affinity groups===\nEach affinity group is seeking for different advantages. But usually, affinity groups increase their income by asking a commission for example. Affinity groups have also a better connection and affinity with their members. Finally, they protect and enhance their reputation without taking any risks as well as avoiding the costs involved in [[merchandising]] directly the [[Product (business)|product]] or [[Service (economics)|service]].\n\n===Customers ===\nSuppliers and affinity groups are not the only parties profiting from this marketing scheme. End-consumers benefit from it, but their benefits depend on the nature of the affinity partner (charitable organization) and the nature of the product or service sold. Again, generally customers are directly satisfied to profit from extra discounts for example, and they become more confident in their choices because of the partnership between their affinity group and the company. Furthermore, they benefit from products and services that have been designed and manufactured especially for them.<ref name=\"consultaffinity\" />\n\n==Failure and limitations==\nWhen employing an affinity marketing program it is not always assured that the scheme is going to succeed. It is due to the fact that some organizations totally refuse to endorse the brand of a company and consider such a partnership as a violation of their dignity. A total affinity marketing scheme failure is also explained by a bad timing in the sense that some companies choose to target the customers at the wrong time. For example, summer and Christmas are not the right moments to focus on pupils and academic staff because of the holiday. Another reason for this lack of success is that the target audience's income is not sufficient for the products offered. Moreover, many affinity marketing efforts fail to tailor the promoted goods and services to that affinity group's specific needs.<ref name=\"macchiette\" />\n\n==In e-commerce==\nIn the context of [[e-commerce]], affinity marketing consists in sharing referrals by promoting [[icons]] and [[Hyperlink|links]] connected to other websites that meet the customers' needs. The aim of employing affinity marketing schemes on the internet is to increase sales, enhance website visibility, encourage traffic. Search engines are involved in affinity marketing by selling links when users type keywords. As e-commerce websites tend to increasingly segment the market, some applications analyze the customers' online conduct in order to personalize them and offer them tailored products.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Emigh|first1=Jacqueline|title=Affinity marketing|journal=Computerworld|date=Sep 27, 1999|volume=64}}</ref>\n\n==Market segmentation==\nHaving an essential function in affinity marketing, the nature of the individual's common bond is indispensable for understanding the concept. In other words, it is important to know in what way or manner the relationship was built and to know to which [[affinity group]] the customer belongs.<ref name=customerservice/> When segmenting the market, the affinity marketers also need to take into account the purpose of the Affinity Group's existence, any other [http://www.affiliate-programs.biz/ Affiliate Program], the number of people who are composing the group, the nature of the people in the group, members' solvency and the receptivity to the goods and services offered. Further, in analyzing affinity [[marketing]] one needs to acknowledge the power and nature of affinity.<ref name=\"macchiette\" /> An affinity marketing strategy is focused on one of the four different aspects of affinity. First, affinity is related to the support of a deserving cause. Second, affinity is based on relationships creating a sense of recognition in an organization that doesn't necessary have to exist (for instance a country, a family or an animal).  Third, affinity comes from a sense of desiring to be part of a dissimilar social group (aspirational). Last, affinity is correlated to the wish for personally acquiring discounts, or privileges from goods and services sold by a specific organization (self-interest). This group may include [http://kyoba.boxlake.com/Views/public/Content.aspx?page_id=184 Captive Associations] such as some State Bar Associations which make membership mandatory, [[doi:10.1111/j.1467-9442.2012.01694.x|Professional and Trade Unions]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goerke|first=Laszlo|last2=Pannenberg|first2=Markus|date=2012-04-20|title=Risk Aversion and Trade-Union Membership*|journal=The Scandinavian Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=114|issue=2|pages=275\u2013295|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9442.2012.01694.x|issn=0347-0520|hdl=10419/150637|url=http://www.diw.de/documents/publikationen/73/diw_01.c.79230.de/diw_sp0088.pdf}}</ref> other Professional Associations such as Realtor  Associations where they are not captive but membership is compelled by controlling access to tools and support essential to their work.

Much of the time \u2013 most recently from the 13th century to the late 16th century \u2013 the Amu Darya emptied into both the Aral and the Caspian Seas, reaching the latter via a large [[distributary]] called the [[Uzboy River]]. The Uzboy splits off from the main channel just south of the river's delta. Sometimes the flow through the two branches was more or less equal, but often most of the Amu Darya's flow split to the west and flowed into the Caspian.\n\nPeople began to settle along the lower Amu Darya and the Uzboy in the 5th century, establishing a thriving chain of agricultural lands, towns, and cities. In about AD 985, the massive Gurganj Dam at the bifurcation of the forks started to divert water to the Aral. [[Genghis Khan]]'s troops destroyed the dam in 1221, and the Amu Darya shifted to distributing its flow more or less equally between the main stem and the Uzboy.<ref name=\"Oxus\">{{cite web |last=Volk |first=Sylvia |url=http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/~volk/sylvia/OxusRiver.htm |title=The Course of the Oxus River |publisher=University of Calgary |date=2000-11-11 |access-date=2010-02-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223173101/http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/~volk/sylvia/OxusRiver.htm |archive-date=2009-12-23}}</ref> But in the 18th century, the river again turned north, flowing into the Aral Sea, a path it has taken since.

The [[Qaraqum Canal]], Karshi Canal, and Bukhara Canal were among the larger of the irrigation diversions built. However, the [[Main Turkmen Canal]], which would have diverted water along the dry Uzboy River bed into central Turkmenistan, was never built.

Much of the time \u2013 most recently from the 13th century to the late 16th century \u2013 the Amu Darya emptied into both the Aral and the Caspian Seas, reaching the latter via a large [[distributary]] called the [[Uzboy River]]. The Uzboy splits off from the main channel just south of the river's delta. Sometimes the flow through the two branches was more or less equal, but often most of the Amu Darya's flow split to the west and flowed into the Caspian.\n\nPeople began to settle along the lower Amu Darya and the Uzboy in the 5th century, establishing a thriving chain of agricultural lands, towns, and cities. In about AD 985, the massive Gurganj Dam at the bifurcation of the forks started to divert water to the Aral. [[Genghis Khan]]'s troops destroyed the dam in 1221, and the Amu Darya shifted to distributing its flow more or less equally between the main stem and the Uzboy.<ref name=\"Oxus\">{{cite web |last=Volk |first=Sylvia |url=http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/~volk/sylvia/OxusRiver.htm |title=The Course of the Oxus River |publisher=University of Calgary |date=2000-11-11 |access-date=2010-02-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223173101/http://www.iras.ucalgary.ca/~volk/sylvia/OxusRiver.htm |archive-date=2009-12-23}}</ref> But in the 18th century, the river again turned north, flowing into the Aral Sea, a path it has taken since.

A direct route crosses extremely high mountain passes in the [[Hindu Kush]] and isolated areas like [[Kafiristan]]. Some in Britain feared that the Empire of Russia, which at the time wielded great influence over the Oxus area, would overcome these obstacles and find a suitable route through which to invade [[British India]] \u2013 but this never came to pass.<ref>See for example ''Can Russia invade India?'' by Henry Bathurst Hanna, 1895, (Google eBook), or ''The K\u00e1firs of the Hindu-Kush'', Sir George Scott Robertson, Illustrated by Arthur David McCormick, Lawrence & Bullen, Limited, 1896, (Google eBook)</ref> The area was taken over by Russia during the [[Russian conquest of Turkestan]].\n\nThe [[Soviet Union]] became the ruling power in the early 1920s and expelled [[Mohammed Alim Khan]].

Before this time, water from the rivers was already being used for agriculture, but not on this massive scale. The [[Qaraqum Canal]], Karshi Canal, and Bukhara Canal were among the larger of the irrigation diversions built. However, the [[Main Turkmen Canal]], which would have diverted water along the dry Uzboy River bed into central Turkmenistan, was never built. The 1970s, in the course of the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]], Soviet forces used the valley to invade Afghanistan through [[Termez]].<ref>Termez \u2013 See the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]] article</ref> The Soviet Union fell in the 1990s and Central Asia split up into the many smaller countries that lie within or partially within the Amu Darya basin.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pavlovskaya |first=L.
