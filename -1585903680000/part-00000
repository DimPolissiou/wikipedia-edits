[[Raj Kapoor]] rechristened Nawab Banoo as \"Nimmi\".\n\n==Early life==\n{{unsourced|section|date=March 2020}}\nNawab Banoo was born in [[Agra]] to a Muslim family. Her mother was a courtesan, a singer and an actress, known as Wahidan. She was well connected within the film industry. Nimmi's father, Abdul Hakim, worked as a military contractor. Nimmi's true forename of \"Nawab\" was given by her grandfather while her grandmother added \"Banoo\". As a young child, Nimmi had memories of visiting [[Bombay]], and her mother being on good terms with [[Mehboob Khan]] and his family, who were prominent and influential within the movie-making business.\n\nWhen Nimmi was only eleven years old, her mother died suddenly. Her father lived in [[Meerut]] where he worked and had a family; by this time, his contact with Nimmi's mother was minimal. Nimmi was therefore sent to live in [[Abbottabad]] near [[Rawalpindi]] with her maternal grandmother. The [[partition of India]] happened in 1947, and Abbotabad fell in [[Pakistan]]. Nimmi's grandmother moved to [[Mumbai]] (then known as Bombay) and settled in the household of her other daughter, known by the name Jyoti. Herself a former actress, Jyoti was married to [[G. M. Durrani]], a popular Indian playback singer, actor, and music director.\n\n==Career==\n{{unsourced|section|date=March 2020}}\nIn 1948, via the connection with her mother who had worked with him in the 1930s, the famous filmmaker [[Mehboob Khan]], invited the young Nimmi to watch the making of his current production ''[[Andaz (1949 film)|Andaz]]'' at Central Studios. She had shown an interest in movies and this was an opportunity to understand the film making process. On the sets of ''Andaz'', Nimmi met [[Raj Kapoor]], who was starring in the film.\n\nAt the time [[Raj Kapoor]] was filming his production of ''[[Barsaat (1949 film)|Barsaat]]'' (1949). Having already cast the famous actress [[Nargis]] in the female lead role, he was on the lookout for a young girl to play the second lead. After observing Nimmi's unaffected and shy behaviour as a guest on the sets of ''Andaz'', he cast the teenaged Nimmi in ''Barsaat'' opposite the actor [[Prem Nath]]. Nimmi played the role of an innocent mountain shepherdess in love with a heartless city man. ''Barsaat'', released in 1949, made movie history. It was a phenomenal critical and commercial success. Despite the presence of established and popular stars [[Nargis]], [[Raj Kapoor]] and Premnath, Nimmi had a very prominent and well-received role and was an instant hit with audiences.  \n\n===Rise to stardom===\nAfter ''[[Barsaat (1949 film)|Barsaat]]'', Nimmi was flooded with film offers. She quietly polished her histrionic abilities and developed a mannered but effectively unique style of acting. The diminutive actress quickly won a loyal fan base with her intense and expressive performances.\n\n====1950s====\nShe worked with top heroes like [[Raj Kapoor]] (''[[Banwara]]''), and Dev Anand (''[[Sazaa (1951 film)|Sazaa]]'', ''[[Aandhiyan (1952 film)|Aandhiyan]]''). To her great advantage Nimmi formed a very popular and dependable screen pair with [[Dilip Kumar]], after the success of films like ''[[Deedar (1951 film)|Deedar]]'' (1951) and ''[[Daag (1952 film)|Daag]]'' (1952). Aside from [[Nargis]] with whom she co-starred  in ''Barsaat'' and ''Deedar'', Nimmi also appeared alongside many notable leading ladies including [[Madhubala]] (''[[Amar (1954 film)|Amar]]''), [[Suraiya]] (''[[Shama (1961 film)|Shama]]''), [[Geeta Bali]] (''[[Usha Kiran (1952 film)|Usha Kiran]]''), and [[Meena Kumari]] (''[[Char Dil Char Rahen (1959)|Char Dil Char Rahen]]'' (1959). Nimmi was also a singer and sang her own songs in the film ''[[Bedardi (1951 film)|Bedardi]]'' (1951) in which she also acted. However, she never continued singing, and recorded songs only for this film.\n\n[[Mehboob Khan]] was next to cast her in ''[[Aan]]'' (1952). The film was made with an extremely large budget. Nimmi played one of the female leads. Such was Nimmi's popularity at this point that when a first edit of the film was shown to the film's financiers and distributors, they objected that Nimmi's character died too early. An extended dream sequence was added to give Nimmi more prominence and screen time in the film. ''[[Aan]]'' was one of the first Indian movies to have a worldwide release. The film had an extremely lavish [[London]] premiere which Nimmi attended. The [[English language|English]] version was entitled ''[[Savage Princess]]''. On the [[London]] trip, Nimmi met many western film personalities including [[Errol Flynn]]. When Flynn attempted to kiss her hand she pulled it away, exclaiming, \"I am an Indian girl, you cannot do that!\" The incident made the headlines and the press raved about Nimmi as the ''\"... unkissed girl of [[India]]\"''.\n\nNimmi further revealed in a 2013 interview, that at the London premiere of Aan, she received four serious offers from Hollywood, including Cecil B. DeMille who greatly admired the film and Nimmi's performance. Nimmi declined these offers, choosing to focus on her flourishing career in India. After the great box-office success of ''[[Aan]]'', [[Mehboob Khan]] asked her to appear in his next film ''[[Amar (1954 film)|Amar]]'' (1954). Nimmi played a poor, milkmaid seduced by a lawyer ([[Dilip Kumar]]). The film also starred [[Madhubala]] as Kumar's wronged fianc\u00e9e. Its controversial subject of rape was way ahead of its time and although the film was not a commercial success, Nimmi's intense performance and the film were applauded by critics. It remained the favorite film of [[Mehboob Khan]] amongst his own productions. She acted and turned producer with the popular film ''[[Danka (1954 film)|Danka]]'' (1954) which was released under her own production banner. ''[[Kundan (1955 film)|Kundan]]'' (1955), produced by [[Sohrab Modi]] co-starring newcomer [[Sunil Dutt]], gave Nimmi a memorable double role as mother and daughter. Her sensitive portrayal earned her further recognition as a talented and spirited actress. In ''[[Uran Khatola]]'' (1955), her last of five films with [[Dilip Kumar]], she starred in one of the biggest box-office successes of her career. \n\nNimmi next had two big successes in 1956 with ''[[Basant Bahar (film)|Basant Bahar]]'' and ''[[Bhai-Bhai (1956 film)|Bhai-Bhai]]''. In 1957, at the age of 24, Nimmi received the critic's award for best actress for her role in ''[[Bhai Bhai (1956 film)|Bhai Bhai]]''. These films were also notable for her songs which were dubbed by [[Lata Mangeshkar]]. By this point, with a largely consistent run of success at the box-office, Nimmi had firmly established herself as one of the most bankable and popular leading ladies in [[Hindi]] cinema.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Nimmi worked with renowned directors [[Chetan Anand (producer & director)|Chetan Anand]] (''[[Anjali (1957 film)|Anjali]]'' ), [[K. A. Abbas]] (''[[Char Dil Char Rahen]]'') and [[Vijay Bhatt]] (''[[Angulimala]]''). Prepared to take risks, Nimmi took on controversial characterizations, such as the prostitute of ''Char Dil Char Raahen'' (1959). It was during this phase that Nimmi became very selective as she strove for better quality projects and roles. However, her judgment was sometimes questionable when she rejected films like [[B. R. Chopra]]'s ''[[Sadhna]]'' (1958), and ''[[Woh Kaun Thi?]]'' (1963), both of which went on to be big successes for [[Vyjayanthimala]] and [[Sadhana]], respectively.\n\n====Completion of Love & God====\nAt this point, Nimmi opted for early retirement and marriage, but not before investing her best efforts into one last film production. Director [[K. Asif]] had started his version of the [[Laila]]-[[Majnu]] love legend, ''[[Love & God]]'' even before completing his magnum opus ''[[Mughal-e-Azam]]'' (1960). Nimmi believed that ''Love & God'' would be a fitting [[swan song]] to her career and her claim to eternal fame just as ''Mughal-e-Azam'' had immortalised its leading lady, [[Madhubala]]. K. Asif had problems casting the male lead before finally selecting [[Guru Dutt]] as Nimmi's co-star.  However, Guru Dutt's sudden and premature death put a halt to the film's shooting. [[Sanjeev Kumar]] was cast as his replacement but the film was shelved altogether when the director K. Asif died.\n\nNimmi had retired from films for over two decades by the time K. Asif's widow [[Akhtar Asif]] released ''Love & God'' on 6 June 1986 in incomplete form. The film suffers badly from compromised editing in an attempt to cover the fact that several key scenes and a clear climax were not filmed before Asif died. But the footage that Nimmi completed before the film was shelved showed she had delivered a subtle and sensitive portrayal and looked beautiful in [[Technicolor]] and the period costumes.\n\n[[File:Nimmi.jpg|thumb|Nimmi in recent years]]\nIn 2013, in a rare interview with [[Rajya Sabha TV]], Nimmi recounted her complete Hindi film career, from her beginnings as a child in Agra, her first break in Barsaat to the current day, and her experiences during this time.<ref name=\"ht\">{{cite news |title=Guftagoo, the only uninterrupted Bollywood celebrity show on Indian television |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/guftagoo-the-only-uninterrupted-bollywood-celebrity-show-on-indian-television/story-UbEgXaEB9k6mtjvu6zFwkL.html |accessdate=23 November 2018 |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=20 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=M |first1=Irfan |title=Guftagoo with Nimmi |url=http://fullreels.com/en/video/O5qe8NMuZA8/Guftagoo-with-Nimmi |website=https://rstv.nic.in/promo-guftagoo.html |publisher=Rajya Sabha TV |accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File: Portrait Nimmi.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Nimmi in 1949]]\nIn her interview with Irfan and [[Rajya Sabha TV]], Nimmi recounted that she first saw a photo of her husband Raza, himself a scriptwriter with [[Mehboob Studio|Mehboob studios]], during a shooting at [[Famous Studios|Famous studio]]. Her hairdresser had shown her Raza's photo in the film magazine \"[[Filmindia]]\" and asked her why she did not want to marry him. She liked the idea as she had heard about Raza. Soon, her co-actor [[Mukri]] also suggested the same. They acted as cupids, subsequently, their parents met, and were married. Thus, the match was arranged by the two families in the usual Indian way. The couple was not blessed with children, and they were both deeply disappointed by this. They subsequently adopted Nimmi's sister's son, who now lives in [[London]].<ref name=\"rstvfull\">{{cite news |last1=m |first1=Irfan |title=Guftagoo with Nimmi : Complete interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5qe8NMuZA8 |accessdate=23 November 2018 |publisher=Rajya Sabha TV |date=28 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 March 2020, she died at age 87.<ref>https://www.deccanherald.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/bollywood-actor-nimmi-no-more-817861.html</ref> <ref>https://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/hindi/2020/mar/27/veteran-actor-nimmi-passes-away-at-88-2121982.html</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Film\n!Role\n!Notes \n|-\n|1949\n|''[[Barsaat (1949 film)|Barsaat]]''\n|Neela\n|Debut film \n|-\n|rowspan=3|1950\n|''[[Wafaa (film)|Wafaa]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|''[[Raj Mukut]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|''[[Jalte Deep]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=5|1951\n|''[[Sazaa (1951 film)|Sazaa]]''\n|Asha\n|\n|-\n|''[[Buzdil]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|''[[Deedar (1951 film)|Deedar]]''\n|Champa\n|\n|-\n|''Bedardi''\n|\n|\n|-\n|''[[Badi Bahu]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1952\n|''[[Daag (1952 film)|Daag]]''\n|Parvati \"Paro\"\n|\n|-\n|''[[Aan]]''\n|Mangala\n|\n|-\n|''[[Aandhiyan (1952 film)|Aandhiyan]]''\n|Rani\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1953\n|''[[Humdard]]''\n| \n|\n|-\n|''[[Aabshar]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|''[[Alif Laila (1953 film)|Alif Laila]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=4|1954\n|''[[Amar (1954 film)|Amar]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|''[[Pyaase Nain]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|''Kasturi''\n|\n|\n|-\n|''Danka''\n|\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=4|1955\n|''[[Society (1955 film)|Society]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|''[[Uran Khatola (film)|Uran Khatola]]''\n|Soni / Shibu\n|\n|-\n|''[[Kundan (film)|Kundan]]''\n|Radha\n|\n|-\n|''[[Bhagwat Mahima]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=3|1956\n|''[[Rajdhani (film)|Rajdhani]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|''[[Bhai-Bhai (1956 film)|Bhai-Bhai]]''\n|Rani\n|\n|-\n|''[[Basant Bahar (film)|Basant Bahar]]''\n|Gopi\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1957\n|''[[Anjali (1957 film)|Anjali]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|''[[Chotte Babu]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|1958\n|''[[Sohni Mahiwal (1958 film)|Sohni Mahiwal]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1959\n|''[[Pehli Raat (film)|Pehli Raat]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|''[[Char Dil Char Rahen]]''\n|Pyari\n|\n|-\n|1960\n|''[[Angulimaal (film)|Angulimaal]]''\n|Princess Maya\n|\n|-\n|1961\n|''[[Shamma]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|1963\n|''[[Mere Mehboob]]''\n|Najma, Anwar's sister\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1964\n|''[[Pooja Ke Phool]]''\n|Gauri\n|\n|-\n|''[[Daal Me Kala]]''\n|Manju\n|\n|-\n|1965\n|''[[Akashdeep]]''\n|\n|\n|-\n|1986\n|''[[Love & God]]''\n|Laila\n|Starting production in 1963, the film was released in 1986.\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* Interview, ''Nimmi: \"I have a dream to be Queen\"'', [[The Indian Express]] Newspaper, Issue date: Friday, 30 May 1997.

But the footage that Nimmi completed before the film was shelved showed she had delivered a subtle and sensitive portrayal and looked beautiful in [[Technicolor]] and the period costumes.\n\n[[File:Nimmi.jpg|thumb|Nimmi in recent years]]\nIn 2013, in a rare interview with [[Rajya Sabha TV]], Nimmi recounted her complete Hindi film career, from her beginnings as a child in Agra, her first break in Barsaat to the current day, and her experiences during this time.<ref name=\"ht\">{{cite news |title=Guftagoo, the only uninterrupted Bollywood celebrity show on Indian television |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/guftagoo-the-only-uninterrupted-bollywood-celebrity-show-on-indian-television/story-UbEgXaEB9k6mtjvu6zFwkL.html |accessdate=23 November 2018 |publisher=Hindustan Times |date=20 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=M |first1=Irfan |title=Guftagoo with Nimmi |url=http://fullreels.com/en/video/O5qe8NMuZA8/Guftagoo-with-Nimmi |website=https://rstv.nic.in/promo-guftagoo.html |publisher=Rajya Sabha TV |accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File: Portrait Nimmi.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Nimmi in 1949]]\nIn her interview with Irfan and [[Rajya Sabha TV]], Nimmi recounted that she first saw a photo of her husband Raza, himself a scriptwriter with [[Mehboob Studio|Mehboob studios]], during a shooting at [[Famous Studios|Famous studio]]. Her hairdresser had shown her Raza's photo in the film magazine \"[[Filmindia]]\" and asked her why she did not get married to him. She liked the idea as she had heard about Raza. Soon, her co-actor [[Mukri]] also suggested the same. They acted as cupids, subsequently, their parents met, and they got married. Thus, the match was arranged by the two families in the usual Indian way. The couple was not blessed with children, and they were both deeply disappointed by this.

They were acquitted of all charges other than three charges of child cruelty against one of the defendants, on which the jury was unable to reach a verdict.<ref>{{cite web |title=Former St Gilbert's head teacher cleared of child cruelty |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-45976040 |website=BBC News |date=7 November 2018}}</ref> Other, named, abusers were reported to have died.<ref name=gilbdec14/>\n\nThere were other cases with many victims in countries including Scotland (St Ninian's in Gartmore, Stirlingshire; St Joseph's in Tranent; St Mary's in Bishopbriggs),<ref>[http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/executive-fights-to-halt-163-8-5m-claim-from-abused-former-pupils-1-688720 The Scotsman, Executive fights to halt \u00a38.5m claim from abused former pupils, 17 January 2006]</ref> Australia,<ref name=brokenrites>[http://brokenrites.org.au/drupal/node/39 Broken Rites helped two female victims to gain an apology]</ref><ref>[http://ncronline.org/news/accountability/catholic-church-appears-australian-royal-commission-sexual-abuse  National Catholic Reporter: Catholic church appears before Australian Royal Commission into sexual abuse, 13 December 2013]</ref> and Ireland.<ref name=cica>[http://www.childabusecommission.ie/rpt/01-01.php Government of Ireland:Establishment of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (CICA):The De La Salle Brothers, 1.129\u20131.131]</ref> Serious and detailed allegations about decades-old abuse have been reported in the US, with several lawsuits being settled in favour of victims.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/25/us/63-million-to-be-paid-to-settle-abuse-case.html |title=$6.3 Million to Be Paid to Settle Abuse Case |newspaper=The New York Times |date= 25 December 2004 |author=NEELA BANERJEE |accessdate= 12 July 2018}}<!--Article names \"Christian Brothers, but text shows it's La Salle, not Irish Brothers--></ref><ref>[http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/La-Salle-alumnus-alleges-sex-abuse-5773612.php TimesUnion.com: La Salle alumnus alleges sex abuse, 22 September 2014] Troy, New York]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_12698380?nclick_check=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060629/https://www.mercurynews.com/breakingnews/ci_12698380?nclick_check=1|archive-date=4 March 2016|title=Former De La Salle teacher faces new sexual abuse allegations in Minnesota|website=Mercury News|author=John Simerman|date=26 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/07/catholic-school-hid-abuse_n_793300.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307221343/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/07/catholic-school-hid-abuse_n_793300.html|archive-date=7 March 2016|title=Top Catholic School Program Concealed Sexual Abuse Knowledge|date=7 December 2010|author=PATRICK CONDON|newspaper=Huffington Post (from AP)}}</ref> After the scandal became widely known, branches of the Order apologised, publicly or to individual victims, for several of these cases.<ref name=gilbdec14/><ref name=brokenrites/><ref name=cica/> At St William's residential school in [[Market Weighton]], England, between 1970 and 1991 many boys were abused; 200 now adult men have said they were abused.

While there were no changes to the judging panel or the host of the program, the third season brought in a number of changes to the program, including additional episodes of auditions for its broadcast schedule, the involvement of quarter-finals alongside semi-finals and the final, doubling the number of participants that advanced from the bootcamp stage,  and cosmetic revamps to set pieces used on the program.\n\nThe third season was won by opera singer  [[Neal E. Boyd]], with singer and pianist [[Eli Mattson]] finishing in second place, and violinists Nuttin' But Stringz placing third. During its broadcast, the season averaged over 10 million viewers.\n\n==Season Overview==\nFollowing the previous season, auditions took place within five major cities - [[New York City|New York]], [[Chicago]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Dallas]], and [[Atlanta]] - with an additional round of auditions made online via [[Myspace]] and [[Facebook]]. Production staff had make changes to the schedule of their live episodes, after having to take into account the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] - because the event would receive live coverage on [[NBC]], the production staff had to place the program on a hiatus between August 7\u201326, in order to avoid it clashing with the network's schedule of the sporting event.\n\nThe third season saw a number of additional changes put into place with the program's format following the second season, two of which brought it along a similar arrangement used for ''Britain's Got Talent''. Editing of filmed auditions for their respective episodes were conducted in a similar manner to the British edition, in that footage in each episode consisted of a montage chosen from each major city whose venue featured audition sessions - for example, a collection of auditions, both minor and notable from Dallas, would precede those from another major city following a commercial break. Participants in live rounds now would be determined by two separate votes - the public would decide the first four to advance, while the judges would chose the fifth participant to join them from those who placed 5th and 6th respectively in the public vote. The remaining changes included an expanded number of participants for the \"Las Vegas Callback\" stage of auditions, along with cosmetic updates to the program - alongside a new title card, the judges' table and the red Xs were re-styled to match the design of those used in ''Britain's Got Talent''. Results episodes for this season were arranged on a sporadic schedule alongside live episodes, rather than a pre-ordained arrangement - quarter-finals had their results announced on the same day; semi-finals and the knockout final amongst the top 10 were done the day after the performance episode had been broadcast; while the grand-final's results were aired a week after the performance episode.\n\nOf the participants who auditioned for this season, 40 secured a place in the live quarter-finals, with ten quarterfinalists in each. Around 20 from these rounds advanced and were split between the two semi-finals, with around 10 semi-finalists securing a place in the final, and 5 finalists securing a place in the season's grand-final.

While there were no changes to the judging panel or the host of the program, the third season brought in a number of changes to the program, including additional episodes of auditions for its broadcast schedule, the involvement of quarter-finals alongside semi-finals and the final, doubling the number of participants that advanced from the bootcamp stage,  and cosmetic revamps to set pieces used on the program.\n\nThe third season was won by opera singer  [[Neal E. Boyd]], with singer and pianist [[Eli Mattson]] finishing in second place, and violinists Nuttin' But Stringz placing third. During its broadcast, the season averaged over 10 million viewers.\n\n==Season Overview==\nFollowing the previous season, auditions took place within five major cities - [[New York City|New York]], [[Chicago]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Dallas]], and [[Atlanta]] - with an additional round of auditions made online via [[Myspace]] and [[Facebook]]. Production staff had make changes to the schedule of their live episodes, after having to take into account the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] - because the event would receive live coverage on [[NBC]], the production staff had to place the program on a hiatus between August 7\u201326, in order to avoid it clashing with the network's schedule of the sporting event.\n\nThe third season saw a number of additional changes put into place with the program's format following the second season, two of which brought it along a similar arrangement used for ''Britain's Got Talent''. Editing of filmed auditions for their respective episodes were conducted in a similar manner to the British edition, in that footage in each episode consisted of a montage chosen from each major city whose venue featured audition sessions - for example, a collection of auditions, both minor and notable from Dallas, would precede those from another major city following a commercial break. Participants in live rounds now would be determined by two separate votes - the public would decide the first four to advance, while the judges would chose the fifth participant to join them from those who placed 5th and 6th respectively in the public vote. The remaining changes included an expanded number of participants for the \"Las Vegas Callback\" stage of auditions, along with cosmetic updates to the program - alongside a new title card, the judges' table and the red Xs were re-styled to match the design of those used in ''Britain's Got Talent''. Results episodes for this season were arranged on a sporadic schedule alongside live episodes, rather than a pre-ordained arrangement - quarter-finals had their results announced on the same day; semi-finals and the knockout final amongst the top 10 were done the day after the performance episode had been broadcast; while the grand-final's results were aired a week after the performance episode.\n\nOf the participants who auditioned for this season, 40 secured a place in the live quarter-finals, with ten quarterfinalists in each. Around 20 from these rounds advanced and were split between the two semi-finals, with around 10 semi-finalists securing a place in the final, and 5 finalists securing a place in the season's grand-final.

Working as an [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineer]] and [[computer scientist]] at the same time, he was one of the very few players who achieved distinction in another career while playing top-class competitive chess. He was also a pioneer of [[computer chess]].\n\nBotvinnik was the first world-class player to develop within the Soviet Union, putting him under political pressure but also giving him considerable influence within Soviet chess. From time to time he was accused of using that influence to his own advantage, but the evidence is unclear and some suggest{{who|date=May 2014}} he resisted attempts by Soviet officials to intimidate some of his rivals.\n\nBotvinnik also played a major role in the organization of chess, making a significant contribution to the design of the [[World Chess Championship]] system after World War II and becoming a leading member of the coaching system that enabled the Soviet Union to dominate top-class chess during that time.

At about the same time, Mikhail started reading newspapers, and became a committed [[Communist]].<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\" />\n\nIn autumn 1923, at the age of twelve,<ref name=\"NYTBotvinnikObit\" /> Mikhail Botvinnik was taught chess by a school friend of his older brother, using a home-made set, and instantly fell in love with the game.<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\" /> He finished in mid-table in the school championship, sought advice from another of his brother's friends, and concluded that for him it was better to think out \"concrete concepts\" and then derive general principles from these \u2013 and went on to beat his brother's friend quite easily. In winter 1924, Botvinnik won his school's championship, and exaggerated his age by three years in order to become a member of the [[Petrograd]] Chess Assembly \u2013 to which the Assembly's President turned a blind eye.<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\" /> Botvinnik won his first two tournaments organized by the Assembly. Shortly afterwards, [[Nikolai Krylenko]], a devoted chess player and leading member of the [[Soviet law|Soviet legal system]] who later organized [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[show trials]], began building a huge nationwide chess organization, and the Assembly was replaced by a club in the city's Palace of Labor.<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\" />\n\nTo test the strength of Soviet chess masters, Krylenko organized the [[Moscow 1925 chess tournament]]. On a rest day during the event,<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\" />  world champion [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]] gave a [[simultaneous exhibition]] in [[Leningrad]]. Botvinnik was selected as one of his opponents, and won their game.<ref name=\"Fine1952Botvinnik\" /> In 1926, he reached the final stage of the Leningrad championship. Later that year, he was selected for Leningrad's team in a match against [[Stockholm]], held in Sweden, and scored +1=1 against the future [[grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] [[G\u00f6sta Stoltz]]. On his return, he entertained his schoolmates with a vivid account of the rough sea journey back to Russia. Botvinnik was commissioned to annotate two games from the match, and the fact that his analyses were to be published made him aware of the need for objectivity. In December 1926, he became a candidate member of his school's [[Komsomol]] branch. Around this time his mother became concerned about his poor physique, and as a result he started a program of daily exercise, which he maintained for most of his life.<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\" />\n\n[[File:Botvinnik (1927).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Botvinnik in 1927]]\nWhen Botvinnik finished the school curriculum, he was below the minimum age for the entrance examinations for higher education.<ref name=\"BotvinnikPolyEntrance\">{{cite book|last=Botvinnik |first=M.M.|author2=Cafferty, B.|title=Achieving the Aim|pages=16\u201322|chapter=The Polytechnic}}</ref> While waiting, he qualified for his first [[USSR Chess Championship|USSR Championship]] final stage in 1927 as the youngest player ever at that time, tied for fifth place and won the title of National Master.<ref name=\"Fine1952Botvinnik\" /> He wanted to study Electrical Technology at the [[Leningrad Polytechnical Institute]] and passed the entrance examination; however, there was a persistent excess of applications for this course and the ''Proletstud'', which controlled admissions, had a policy of admitting only children of engineers and industrial workers. After an appeal by a local chess official, he was admitted in 1928 to Leningrad University's Mathematics Department.<ref name=\"BotvinnikPolyEntrance\" /> In January 1929, Botvinnik played for Leningrad in the student team chess championship against Moscow. Leningrad won and the team manager, who was also Deputy Chairman of the ''Proletstud'', secured Botvinnik a transfer to the Polytechnic's Electromechanical Department, where he was one of only four students who entered straight from school.

He remained involved with competitive chess, appearing in several highly rated tournaments and continuing to produce memorable games.\n\nHe retired from competitive play in 1970, aged 59, preferring instead to occupy himself with the development of [[computer chess]] programs and to assist with the training of younger Soviet players, earning him the nickname of \"Patriarch of the Soviet Chess School\" (see below).\n\nBotvinnik's autobiography, ''K Dostizheniyu Tseli'', was published in Russian in 1978, and in English translation as ''Achieving the Aim'' ({{ISBN|0-08-024120-4}}) in 1981. A staunch Communist, he was noticeably shaken by the collapse of the Soviet Union and lost some of his standing in Russian chess during the [[Boris Yeltsin]] era.\n\nIn the 1980s Botvinnik proposed a computer program to manage the Soviet economy. However, his proposals did not receive significant attention from the Soviet government.\n\nDuring the last few years of his life he personally financed his economic computer project that he hoped would be used to manage the Russian economy.

Alekhine was of noble background, with a father who was a member of the Fourth Duma. He was one of the top players in the world at the time of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], won the first official Soviet Championship in 1920, then fled Moscow for good shortly afterwards in 1921. This was seen as a shameful repudiation of his homeland, and few crimes were more serious in Soviet eyes at that time. Botvinnik's [[Nottingham]] 1936 victory, the first by a Soviet master outside his homeland, earned him the government's favour.\n\nThe head of the [[Soviet Chess Federation]] in the early-to-mid 1930s was Nikolai Krylenko, also the State prosecutor who had run the infamous [[Show Trials]] of the late 1920s and early 1930s. When Botvinnik lost for the third time (without winning) to [[Fedor Bogatyrchuk]], Krylenko told Bogatyrchuk, \"You will never beat Botvinnik again.\" That proved to be true as the two never played each other again.\n\n[[Boris Verlinsky]] had won the 1929 Soviet Championship and was granted the first Soviet [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] title for this achievement, yet he was later stripped of it, when it was thought more politically correct to make Botvinnik the first official Soviet GM (not the same thing as the [[FIDE]] Grandmaster title).<ref name=Sorcerer/>\n\nBotvinnik did not win the [[AVRO tournament]] of 1938, placing third behind Keres and Fine, yet soon afterwards began angling through the Soviet government channels for a match with Alekhine for the World Championship. Botvinnik did win the 1939 Soviet Championship with a dramatic last-round victory over runner-up [[Alexander Kotov]]. But he played relatively poorly in the very strong 1940 Soviet Championship, finishing in a tie for 5th\u20136th places, with 11.5/19, two full points behind Bondarevsky and Lilienthal. How would it look for him to be trying for a world title match, yet doing that poorly in his own national championship? With World War II underway by this time, and the strong possibility of little or no chess for some time in the future, Botvinnik seems to have prevailed upon the Soviet chess leadership to hold another tournament \"in order to clarify the situation\".<ref>Egon Varnusz: \"Paul Keres' Best Games, Volume 1: Closed Games\" (London, Cadogan 1994, translated by Andras Barabas, ISBN 1-85744-064-1), page xi.</ref> This wound up being the 1941 Absolute Championship of the USSR, which featured the top six finishers from the 1940 event, playing each other four times. Botvinnik won this tournament convincingly, to reclaim his prominence.\n\nThe Soviet Union entered World War II with the German invasion in 1941. From 1941 to 1943, Botvinnik gave all of his time to his work as an engineer, visiting and testing power stations, as well as repairing insulations. By the beginning of 1943, he was able to take up chess again on a limited basis, studying and playing two days per week. He won the strong [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]] 1943 tournament, and played hors concours in the 1943 Moscow Championship, winning with 13.5/16.\n\nImmediately following the end of the 1946 Groningen tournament, with Alekhine having died earlier that year, and with no set system for choosing the new world champion, Botvinnik personally invited Samuel Reshevsky, Reuben Fine, Max Euwe, Vasily Smyslov, and Paul Keres to join him in a tournament to decide the new world champion.<ref name=Sorcerer/>\n\nFIDE, the World Chess Federation, was set to take over the system for choosing the world champion, following Alekhine's death. One proposal then was to either declare former champion Euwe the new champion, or to hold a match between Euwe and Reshevsky, with the winner becoming the new champion.<ref>''Botvinnik's Best Games 1947\u201370'', by Mikhail Botvinnik; introduction by Viktor Baturinsky, page 1.</ref> But at this stage, the Soviet chess organization was not even a member of FIDE, so how could they influence its decisions!? The Soviets joined FIDE in 1947, and their proposal for the new world championship format (the one originally put forth by Botvinnik the year before in an informal fashion at Groningen) was accepted. Fine eventually declined to play, but otherwise, this wound up being the format used in 1948 to select the new champion, who turned out to be Botvinnik.\n\nBronstein, in his book, writing in 1995, argues that certain other exceptionally strong players, who had emerged during the war years, perhaps could have been invited as well to the 1948 World Championship tournament, especially since Fine had withdrawn. He mentions [[Miguel Najdorf]], [[Isaac Boleslavsky]], [[Gideon Stahlberg]] and himself. Najdorf had defeated Botvinnik quite drastically at their first meeting, Groningen 1946.\n\nBronstein also criticized the timing and sequencing of the two 1948 major events. The World Championship tournament was held early in 1948, beginning in March, and then the [[Interzonal]] tournament (which Bronstein won) was held later the same year. Bronstein suggests that a fairer method would have been to reverse the order, with the top players from the Interzonal, held first, advancing to the World Championship tournament.\n\nBronstein's allegations are difficult to evaluate. Chess historian Taylor Kingston writes,<ref>[http://www.chesscafe.com/text/kb2.pdf The Keres\u2013Botvinnik Case: A Survey of the Evidence, Part II], Taylor Kingston, 1998</ref>\n<blockquote>\n''Bronstein in sum paints a very unflattering picture of Botvinnik: a petty, pompous egoist who reveled in his role as a tin god of Socialist Culture, and who had few if any scruples about reaching and maintaining himself on that pedestal. What to make of this? It could be dismissed as the catty cheap shots of a disgruntled has-been, and some of Bronstein's book does smack of sour grapes and fogeyism. Yet Bronstein has always been respected for his integrity, and the accuracy of his memory. Clearly on the Najdorf veto, either he or Botvinnik is wrong or lying... And it is clear that Bronstein and Botvinnik cannot both be taken at face value.''\n</blockquote>\nThe notion that Botvinnik was an orthodox member of the Soviet system is refuted by the fact that he was one of only three grandmasters ([[Bronstein]] and [[Spassky]] were the others) who refused to sign a condemnation of [[Korchnoi]]'s defection to the West.\n-->\n\n== Assessment ==\n\n=== Playing strength and style ===\n{{further|Comparison of top chess players throughout history}}\n[[Reuben Fine]], writing in 1976, observed that Botvinnik was at or near the top of the chess world for thirty years\u2014from 1933, when he drew a match against Flohr, to 1963, when he lost the world championship for the final time, to Petrosian\u2014\"a feat equaled historically only by [[Emanuel Lasker]] and [[Wilhelm Steinitz]]\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Fine|first=R.|title=The World's Great Chess Games|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1976|edition=2|pages=263|isbn=0-486-24512-8}}</ref> The statistical rating system used in [[Raymond Keene]] and [[Nathan Divinsky]]'s book ''Warriors of the Mind'' concludes that Botvinnik was the fourth strongest player of all time: behind [[Garry Kasparov]], [[Anatoly Karpov]] and [[Bobby Fischer]] but ahead of [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]], Lasker, [[Viktor Korchnoi]], [[Boris Spassky]], [[Vasily Smyslov]] and [[Tigran Petrosian]].<ref name=\"KeeneDivinskyWarriors\">''Warriors of the Mind'', [[Raymond Keene]] and [[Nathan Divinsky]], 1989.</ref> The [[Chessmetrics]] system is sensitive to the length of the periods being compared but places Botvinnik third in a comparison of players' best individual years (1946 for Botvinnik) and sixth in a comparison of fifteen-year periods (1935\u20131949 in Botvinnik's case).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PeakList.asp?Params=199510SSSSS1S000000000000111000000000000010100 |title=Peak Average Ratings: 1 year peak range |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309155451/http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PeakList.asp?Params=199510SSSSS1S000000000000111000000000000010100 |archivedate=2012-03-09 }}</ref><ref name=\"chessmetrics15Years\">{{cite web|url=http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PeakList.asp?Params=199510SSSSSFS000000000000111000000000000010100 |title=Peak Average Ratings: 15 year peak range |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309154756/http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PeakList.asp?Params=199510SSSSSFS000000000000111000000000000010100 |archivedate=2012-03-09 }}</ref> In 2005, Chessmetrics' creator Jeff Sonas wrote an article which examined various ways of comparing the strength of \"world number one\" players, some not based on Chessmetrics; and Botvinnik generally emerged as one of the top six (the greatest exceptions were in criteria related to tournament results).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=2409 | title=The Greatest Chess Player of All Time \u2013 Part IV |author=Sonas, J. | publisher=Chessbase | year=2005}} Part IV gives links to the three earlier parts</ref>  [[FIDE]] did not adopt the [[Elo rating system]] until 1970, by which time Botvinnik's strength had been declining for several years.

But after the FIDE [[World Chess Championship|world championship cycle]] was established in 1948, reigning champions had to play the strongest contender every three years, and successful title defenses became less common than in the pre-World War II years, when the titleholder could select his challenger. Despite this, Botvinnik held the world title for a longer period than any of his successors except [[Garry Kasparov]]. Botvinnik also became world champion at the relatively late age of 37, because World War II brought international competition to a virtual halt for six years; and he was 52 years old when he finally lost his title (only [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] and Emanuel Lasker were older when they were defeated).

In his eight World Championship matches, he never started a game with an e4-opening, and his usual choices as White were the [[English Opening]] or [[Queen's Gambit]]. When playing the black pieces, he preferred the [[French Defense]] or [[Sicilian Defense]] in response to 1.e4, and the [[Slav Defense]] or [[Nimzo-Indian Defense]] in response to 1.d4. While Botvinnik did not use a wide range of openings, he made major contributions to those he did use, for example: the Botvinnik Variation of the [[Semi-Slav Defense]] in the [[Queen's Gambit Declined]], the Kasparov/Botvinnik system in the Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined, the [[Caro\u2013Kann Defence]] (both the Panov\u2013Botvinnik Attack for White and various approaches for Black), the Winawer Variation of the French Defense, the Botvinnik System in the [[English Opening]].

This was the only feasible approach for the primitive computers available in the Soviet Union in the early 1960s, which were only capable of searching three or four [[ply (game theory)|half-moves]] deep (i.e. A's move, B's move, A's move, B's move) if they tried to examine every variation. Botvinnik eventually developed an [[algorithm]] that was reasonably good at finding the right move in difficult positions, but it often missed the right move in simple positions, e.g. where it was possible to checkmate in two moves. This \"selective\" approach turned out to be a [[wikt:dead end|dead end]], as computers were powerful enough by the mid-1970s to perform a [[brute-force search]] (checking all possible moves) several moves deep and today's vastly more powerful computers do this well enough to beat human world champions.<ref name=\"Brudno2000Computer Chess\">{{cite web\n |

[[chess]] [[International Grandmaster|grandmaster]] and [[World Chess Championship|World Chess Champion]] for most of 1948 to 1963. Working as an [[Electrical engineering|electrical engineer]] and [[computer scientist]] at the same time, he was one of the very few players who achieved distinction in another career while playing top-class competitive chess. He was also a pioneer of [[computer chess]].\n\nBotvinnik was the first world-class player to develop within the Soviet Union, putting him under political pressure but also giving him considerable influence within Soviet chess. From time to time he was accused of using that influence to his own advantage, but the evidence is unclear and some suggest{{who|date=May 2014}} he resisted attempts by Soviet officials to intimidate some of his rivals.\n\nBotvinnik also played a major role in the organization of chess, making a significant contribution to the design of the [[World Chess Championship]] system after World War II and becoming a leading member of the coaching system that enabled the Soviet Union to dominate top-class chess during that time. His pupils include World Champions [[Anatoly Karpov]], [[Garry Kasparov]] and [[Vladimir Kramnik]].\n\n== Early years ==\n<!-- *****\nWhom did B. marry & when?\nhttp://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=946 refers to her as Gannochka\n\"Achieving the aim\" p 192 Gayane Davidnova\n****** -->\nMikhail Moiseyevich Botvinnik was born on August 17, 1911,<ref name=\"NYTBotvinnikObit\" /> in what was then [[Repino, Saint Petersburg|Kuokkala]], [[Vyborg Governorate]], [[Grand Duchy of Finland]],<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.jewishgen.org/BELARUS/rje_b.htm | accessdate=2009-06-06\n| title=Russian Jewish Encyclopedia | year=1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Service|first=R.|title=Lenin: a biography|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2000|pages=180\u2013181|chapter=Russia from Far and Near|isbn=0-674-00828-6|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=frDGHIxc4EUC&pg=PA180&dq=kuokkala#PPR8,M1|accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref> but is now the district of Repino in [[Saint Petersburg]].<ref name=\"Beizer2007SovietMetropolis\">{{cite book|last=Beizer|first=M.|title=Revolution, repression, and revival|editor=Gitelman, Z. |editor2=Ro'i, Y.|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield: the Soviet Jewish Experience|year=2007|pages=113\u2013119|chapter=The Jews of a Soviet Metropolis|isbn=978-0-7425-5817-5|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cd3RM6Emko0C&pg=PA118&dq=kuokkala+repino#PPA118,M1|accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref> His parents were [[Russian Jews]], his father was a [[dental technician]] and his mother a [[dentist]],<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\">{{cite book|last=Botvinnik |first=M.M.|author2=Cafferty, B.|title=Achieving the Aim|pages=1\u201316|chapter=FirstMoves}}</ref> which allowed the family to live outside the [[Pale of Settlement]] to which most Jews in the [[Russian Empire]] were restricted at the time.

At about the same time, Mikhail started reading newspapers, and became a committed [[Communist]].<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\" />\n\nIn autumn 1923, at the age of twelve,<ref name=\"NYTBotvinnikObit\" /> Mikhail Botvinnik was taught chess by a school friend of his older brother, using a home-made set, and instantly fell in love with the game.<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\" /> He finished in mid-table in the school championship, sought advice from another of his brother's friends, and concluded that for him it was better to think out \"concrete concepts\" and then derive general principles from these \u2013 and went on to beat his brother's friend quite easily. In winter 1924, Botvinnik won his school's championship, and exaggerated his age by three years in order to become a member of the [[Petrograd]] Chess Assembly \u2013 to which the Assembly's President turned a blind eye.<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\" /> Botvinnik won his first two tournaments organized by the Assembly. Shortly afterwards, [[Nikolai Krylenko]], a devoted chess player and leading member of the [[Soviet law|Soviet legal system]] who later organized [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[show trials]], began building a huge nationwide chess organization, and the Assembly was replaced by a club in the city's Palace of Labor.<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\" />\n\nTo test the strength of Soviet chess masters, Krylenko organized the [[Moscow 1925 chess tournament]]. On a rest day during the event,<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\" />  world champion [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]] gave a [[simultaneous exhibition]] in [[Leningrad]]. Botvinnik was selected as one of his opponents, and won their game.<ref name=\"Fine1952Botvinnik\" /> In 1926, he reached the final stage of the Leningrad championship. Later that year, he was selected for Leningrad's team in a match against [[Stockholm]], held in Sweden, and scored +1=1 against the future [[grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] [[G\u00f6sta Stoltz]]. On his return, he entertained his schoolmates with a vivid account of the rough sea journey back to Russia. Botvinnik was commissioned to annotate two games from the match, and the fact that his analyses were to be published made him aware of the need for objectivity. In December 1926, he became a candidate member of his school's [[Komsomol]] branch. Around this time his mother became concerned about his poor physique, and as a result he started a program of daily exercise, which he maintained for most of his life.<ref name=\"BotvinnikFirstMoves\" />\n\n[[File:Botvinnik (1927).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Botvinnik in 1927]]\nWhen Botvinnik finished the school curriculum, he was below the minimum age for the entrance examinations for higher education.<ref name=\"BotvinnikPolyEntrance\">{{cite book|last=Botvinnik |first=M.M.|author2=Cafferty, B.|title=Achieving the Aim|pages=16\u201322|chapter=The Polytechnic}}</ref> While waiting, he qualified for his first [[USSR Chess Championship|USSR Championship]] final stage in 1927 as the youngest player ever at that time, tied for fifth place and won the title of National Master.<ref name=\"Fine1952Botvinnik\" /> He wanted to study Electrical Technology at the [[Leningrad Polytechnical Institute]] and passed the entrance examination; however, there was a persistent excess of applications for this course and the ''Proletstud'', which controlled admissions, had a policy of admitting only children of engineers and industrial workers.

He remained involved with competitive chess, appearing in several highly rated tournaments and continuing to produce memorable games.\n\nHe retired from competitive play in 1970, aged 59, preferring instead to occupy himself with the development of [[computer chess]] programs and to assist with the training of younger Soviet players, earning him the nickname of \"Patriarch of the Soviet Chess School\" (see below).\n\nBotvinnik's autobiography, ''K Dostizheniyu Tseli'', was published in Russian in 1978, and in English translation as ''Achieving the Aim'' ({{ISBN|0-08-024120-4}}) in 1981. A staunch Communist, he was noticeably shaken by the collapse of the Soviet Union and lost some of his standing in Russian chess during the [[Boris Yeltsin]] era.\n\nIn the 1980s Botvinnik proposed a computer program to manage the Soviet economy. However, his proposals did not receive significant attention from the Soviet government.\n\nDuring the last few years of his life he personally financed his economic computer project that he hoped would be used to manage the Russian economy.

Alekhine was of noble background, with a father who was a member of the Fourth Duma. He was one of the top players in the world at the time of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], won the first official Soviet Championship in 1920, then fled Moscow for good shortly afterwards in 1921. This was seen as a shameful repudiation of his homeland, and few crimes were more serious in Soviet eyes at that time. Botvinnik's [[Nottingham]] 1936 victory, the first by a Soviet master outside his homeland, earned him the government's favour.\n\nThe head of the [[Soviet Chess Federation]] in the early-to-mid 1930s was Nikolai Krylenko, also the State prosecutor who had run the infamous [[Show Trials]] of the late 1920s and early 1930s. When Botvinnik lost for the third time (without winning) to [[Fedor Bogatyrchuk]], Krylenko told Bogatyrchuk, \"You will never beat Botvinnik again.\" That proved to be true as the two never played each other again.\n\n[[Boris Verlinsky]] had won the 1929 Soviet Championship and was granted the first Soviet [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] title for this achievement, yet he was later stripped of it, when it was thought more politically correct to make Botvinnik the first official Soviet GM (not the same thing as the [[FIDE]] Grandmaster title).<ref name=Sorcerer/>\n\nBotvinnik did not win the [[AVRO tournament]] of 1938, placing third behind Keres and Fine, yet soon afterwards began angling through the Soviet government channels for a match with Alekhine for the World Championship. Botvinnik did win the 1939 Soviet Championship with a dramatic last-round victory over runner-up [[Alexander Kotov]]. But he played relatively poorly in the very strong 1940 Soviet Championship, finishing in a tie for 5th\u20136th places, with 11.5/19, two full points behind Bondarevsky and Lilienthal. How would it look for him to be trying for a world title match, yet doing that poorly in his own national championship? With World War II underway by this time, and the strong possibility of little or no chess for some time in the future, Botvinnik seems to have prevailed upon the Soviet chess leadership to hold another tournament \"in order to clarify the situation\".<ref>Egon Varnusz: \"Paul Keres' Best Games, Volume 1: Closed Games\" (London, Cadogan 1994, translated by Andras Barabas, ISBN 1-85744-064-1), page xi.</ref> This wound up being the 1941 Absolute Championship of the USSR, which featured the top six finishers from the 1940 event, playing each other four times. Botvinnik won this tournament convincingly, to reclaim his prominence.\n\nThe Soviet Union entered World War II with the German invasion in 1941. From 1941 to 1943, Botvinnik gave all of his time to his work as an engineer, visiting and testing power stations, as well as repairing insulations. By the beginning of 1943, he was able to take up chess again on a limited basis, studying and playing two days per week. He won the strong [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]] 1943 tournament, and played hors concours in the 1943 Moscow Championship, winning with 13.5/16.\n\nImmediately following the end of the 1946 Groningen tournament, with Alekhine having died earlier that year, and with no set system for choosing the new world champion, Botvinnik personally invited Samuel Reshevsky, Reuben Fine, Max Euwe, Vasily Smyslov, and Paul Keres to join him in a tournament to decide the new world champion.<ref name=Sorcerer/>\n\nFIDE, the World Chess Federation, was set to take over the system for choosing the world champion, following Alekhine's death. One proposal then was to either declare former champion Euwe the new champion, or to hold a match between Euwe and Reshevsky, with the winner becoming the new champion.<ref>''Botvinnik's Best Games 1947\u201370'', by Mikhail Botvinnik; introduction by Viktor Baturinsky, page 1.</ref> But at this stage, the Soviet chess organization was not even a member of FIDE, so how could they influence its decisions!? The Soviets joined FIDE in 1947, and their proposal for the new world championship format (the one originally put forth by Botvinnik the year before in an informal fashion at Groningen) was accepted. Fine eventually declined to play, but otherwise, this wound up being the format used in 1948 to select the new champion, who turned out to be Botvinnik.\n\nBronstein, in his book, writing in 1995, argues that certain other exceptionally strong players, who had emerged during the war years, perhaps could have been invited as well to the 1948 World Championship tournament, especially since Fine had withdrawn. He mentions [[Miguel Najdorf]], [[Isaac Boleslavsky]], [[Gideon Stahlberg]] and himself. Najdorf had defeated Botvinnik quite drastically at their first meeting, Groningen 1946.\n\nBronstein also criticized the timing and sequencing of the two 1948 major events. The World Championship tournament was held early in 1948, beginning in March, and then the [[Interzonal]] tournament (which Bronstein won) was held later the same year. Bronstein suggests that a fairer method would have been to reverse the order, with the top players from the Interzonal, held first, advancing to the World Championship tournament.\n\nBronstein's allegations are difficult to evaluate. Chess historian Taylor Kingston writes,<ref>[http://www.chesscafe.com/text/kb2.pdf The Keres\u2013Botvinnik Case: A Survey of the Evidence, Part II], Taylor Kingston, 1998</ref>\n<blockquote>\n''Bronstein in sum paints a very unflattering picture of Botvinnik: a petty, pompous egoist who reveled in his role as a tin god of Socialist Culture, and who had few if any scruples about reaching and maintaining himself on that pedestal. What to make of this? It could be dismissed as the catty cheap shots of a disgruntled has-been, and some of Bronstein's book does smack of sour grapes and fogeyism. Yet Bronstein has always been respected for his integrity, and the accuracy of his memory. Clearly on the Najdorf veto, either he or Botvinnik is wrong or lying... And it is clear that Bronstein and Botvinnik cannot both be taken at face value.''\n</blockquote>\nThe notion that Botvinnik was an orthodox member of the Soviet system is refuted by the fact that he was one of only three grandmasters ([[Bronstein]] and [[Spassky]] were the others) who refused to sign a condemnation of [[Korchnoi]]'s defection to the West.\n-->\n\n== Assessment ==\n\n=== Playing strength and style ===\n{{further|Comparison of top chess players throughout history}}\n[[Reuben Fine]], writing in 1976, observed that Botvinnik was at or near the top of the chess world for thirty years\u2014from 1933, when he drew a match against Flohr, to 1963, when he lost the world championship for the final time, to Petrosian\u2014\"a feat equaled historically only by [[Emanuel Lasker]] and [[Wilhelm Steinitz]]\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Fine|first=R.|title=The World's Great Chess Games|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1976|edition=2|pages=263|isbn=0-486-24512-8}}</ref> The statistical rating system used in [[Raymond Keene]] and [[Nathan Divinsky]]'s book ''Warriors of the Mind'' concludes that Botvinnik was the fourth strongest player of all time: behind [[Garry Kasparov]], [[Anatoly Karpov]] and [[Bobby Fischer]] but ahead of [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]], Lasker, [[Viktor Korchnoi]], [[Boris Spassky]], [[Vasily Smyslov]] and [[Tigran Petrosian]].<ref name=\"KeeneDivinskyWarriors\">''Warriors of the Mind'', [[Raymond Keene]] and [[Nathan Divinsky]], 1989.</ref> The [[Chessmetrics]] system is sensitive to the length of the periods being compared but places Botvinnik third in a comparison of players' best individual years (1946 for Botvinnik) and sixth in a comparison of fifteen-year periods (1935\u20131949 in Botvinnik's case).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PeakList.asp?Params=199510SSSSS1S000000000000111000000000000010100 |title=Peak Average Ratings: 1 year peak range |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309155451/http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PeakList.asp?Params=199510SSSSS1S000000000000111000000000000010100 |archivedate=2012-03-09 }}</ref><ref name=\"chessmetrics15Years\">{{cite web|url=http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PeakList.asp?Params=199510SSSSSFS000000000000111000000000000010100 |title=Peak Average Ratings: 15 year peak range |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309154756/http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PeakList.asp?Params=199510SSSSSFS000000000000111000000000000010100 |archivedate=2012-03-09 }}</ref> In 2005, Chessmetrics' creator Jeff Sonas wrote an article which examined various ways of comparing the strength of \"world number one\" players, some not based on Chessmetrics; and Botvinnik generally emerged as one of the top six (the greatest exceptions were in criteria related to tournament results).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=2409 | title=The Greatest Chess Player of All Time \u2013 Part IV |author=Sonas, J. | publisher=Chessbase | year=2005}} Part IV gives links to the three earlier parts</ref>  [[FIDE]] did not adopt the [[Elo rating system]] until 1970, by which time Botvinnik's strength had been declining for several years.

But after the FIDE [[World Chess Championship|world championship cycle]] was established in 1948, reigning champions had to play the strongest contender every three years, and successful title defenses became less common than in the pre-World War II years, when the titleholder could select his challenger. Despite this, Botvinnik held the world title for a longer period than any of his successors except [[Garry Kasparov]]. Botvinnik also became world champion at the relatively late age of 37, because World War II brought international competition to a virtual halt for six years; and he was 52 years old when he finally lost his title (only [[Wilhelm Steinitz]] and Emanuel Lasker were older when they were defeated).

This was the only feasible approach for the primitive computers available in the Soviet Union in the early 1960s, which were only capable of searching three or four [[ply (game theory)|half-moves]] deep (i.e. A's move, B's move, A's move, B's move) if they tried to examine every variation. Botvinnik eventually developed an [[algorithm]] that was reasonably good at finding the right move in difficult positions, but it often missed the right move in simple positions, e.g. where it was possible to checkmate in two moves. This \"selective\" approach turned out to be a [[wikt:dead end|dead end]], as computers were powerful enough by the mid-1970s to perform a [[brute-force search]] (checking all possible moves) several moves deep and today's vastly more powerful computers do this well enough to beat human world champions.<ref name=\"Brudno2000Computer Chess\">{{cite web\n |
