The leaves are greyish green, narrow egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, {{cvt|15-30|mm}} long and {{cvt|5-10|mm}} wide on a short petiole. The flowers are borne on short side shoots, usually in pairs of different ages, and are usually {{cvt|15-20|mm}} wide. There are many reddish brown [[bract]]s around the flower buds but most fall off as the flower opens. The [[Hypanthium|floral cup]] is mostly [[wikt:glabrous|glabrous]], {{cvt|3-4|mm}} long with the upper part expanded. The [[sepal]]s are triangular, about {{cvt|2|mm}} long, the [[petal]]s white, {{cvt|5-8|mm}} long and the [[stamen]]s {{cvt|1.5-2.5|mm}} long. Flowering mainly occurs from August to October and the fruit is a [[Capsule (botany)|capsule]] {{cvt|7-8|mm}} wide with the remains of the sepals initially attached.

It has thin, rough bark on the older stems, narrow egg-shaped leaves, relatively large white flowers and flat topped fruit that is shed shortly after reaching maturity.\n\n==Description==\n''Leptospermum laevigatum'' is a bushy shrub or tree that typically grows to a height of {{cvt|1.5-6|m}} and has thin, rough bark on the older stems. The young stems are covered with silky hairs at first and have a groove near the base of the [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]]. The leaves are greyish green, narrow egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, {{cvt|15-30|mm}} long and {{cvt|5-10|mm}} wide on a short petiole. The flowers are borne on short side shoots, usually in pairs of different ages, and are usually {{cvt|15-20|mm}} wide. There are many reddish brown [[bract]]s around the flower buds but most fall off as the flower opens. The [[Hypanthium|floral cup]] is mostly [[wikt:glabrous|glabrous]], {{cvt|3-4|mm}} long with the upper part expanded. The [[sepal]]s are triangular, about {{cvt|2|mm}} long, the [[petal]]s white, {{cvt|5-8|mm}} long and the [[stamen]]s {{cvt|1.5-2.5|mm}} long. Flowering mainly occurs from August to October and the fruit is a [[Capsule (botany)|capsule]] {{cvt|7-8|mm}} wide with the remains of the sepals initially attached. The fruit mostly fall from the plant shortly after reaching maturity.<ref name=\"RBGV\" /><ref name=\"RBGS\">{{cite web |title=''Leptospermum laevigatum'' |url=http://plantnet.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/NSWfl.pl?page=nswfl&lvl=sp&name=Leptospermum~laevigatum |publisher=Royal Botanic Garden Sydney |accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Telopea\">{{cite journal |last1=Thompson |first1=Joy |title=A revision of the genus ''Leptospermum'' (Myrtaceae) |journal=Telopea |date=1989 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=372\u2013373}}</ref><ref name=\"ANPSA\">{{cite web |title=''Leptospermum laevigatum'' |url=http://anpsa.org.au/l-lae.html |publisher=Australian Native Plants Society (Australia) |accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy and naming==\nThis teatree was first formally described in 1788 by [[Joseph Gaertner]] who gave it the name ''Fabricia laevigata'' and published the description in his book ''[[De Fructibus et Seminibus Plantarum]]''.<ref name=APNI1>{{cite web|title=''Fabricia laevigata''|url= https://id.biodiversity.org.au/instance/apni/462791 |publisher=APNI|accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref> In 1858, [[Ferdinand von Mueller]] changed the name to ''Leptospermum laevigatum''.<ref name=APNI>{{cite web|title=''Leptospermum laevigatum''|url= https://id.biodiversity.org.au/instance/apni/524798|publisher=APNI|accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref> The [[Botanical name|specific epithet]] (''laevigatum'') is from a Latin word meaning \"made smooth\" or \"having a polished surface\".<ref name=\"Sharr\">{{cite book |author=[[Francis Aubie Sharr]]|title=Western Australian Plant Names and their Meanings |date=2019 |publisher=Four Gables Press |location=Kardinya, Western Australia |isbn=9780958034180 |page=233}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Leptospermum laevigatum'' is native to New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania where it grows in heath, sometimes forest and on coastal dunes and cliffs south from [[Nambucca Heads, New South Wales|Nambucca Heads]] in New South Wales to [[Anglesea, Victoria|Anglesea]] in Victoria and northern Tasmania.

Through most of his career, Ford was a [[right midfielder|right-sided midfielder]], but in the later years of his career, he was converted to [[right-back]]. In a career that spanned 26 years, across four decades, Ford played no fewer than 931 [[The Football League|league]] matches, which is [[List of footballers in England and Scotland by number of league appearances|the all-time record for matches played in the English league by an outfield player]] with not one game played in the top-flight division. Only goalkeeper [[Peter Shilton]] (1005 matches) has played more. Ford is in fact only one of three outfield players to play in English football to have ever passed [[List of footballers with the most official appearances|1000 games in competitive matches]] (league and cup), the others being [[Scott McGleish]]<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/08/scott-mcgleish-1000-games-chesham-leyton-orient-striker-goal Scott McGleish at 44 and 1,000 games: 'I can't see myself giving up soon' | Football | The Guardian<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and [[Graham Alexander]].<ref name=\"alexander\">{{cite news |title=Burnley 2\u20131 Swansea  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/13022994.stm  |publisher=BBC News |date=14 April 2011 |accessdate=14 April 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Playing career===\nFord began his career at his hometown club [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]], where he made his first-team debut as a 16-year-old in October 1975. He spent 11 years at Blundell Park, where he made his name as one of the most talented players outside the top division. In 1986, he left Grimsby. He first had a short loan spell at [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], and later joined [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke]] in a permanent deal.\n\nFord spent two and a half years at Stoke, before being transferred to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich]] midway through the [[1988\u201389 in English football|1988\u201389]] season. After three years at The Hawthorns, he rejoined Grimsby in late 1991. His second spell at Blundell Park lasted three seasons, and he left the club at the end of the [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]] season, having played 423 league games for the club, which at the time placed him second on the club's career appearance list behind [[Keith Jobling]] (he has since been passed on that list by [[John McDermott (English footballer)|John McDermott]] and [[Paul Groves (footballer)|Paul Groves]]).\n\nIn 1994, Ford joined Grimsby's arch-rivals [[Scunthorpe United|Scunthorpe]], where he played two seasons. When he was released at the end of the [[1995\u201396 in English football|1995\u201396]] season, it seemed like his career at league level had come to an end. However, after a short spell at non-league side [[Barrow A.F.C.|Barrow]], he was asked by [[Steve Parkin]], a former teammate at Stoke and WBA, who had recently been appointed manager at [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield]] to become his assistant. This allowed Ford to continue his playing career, and in early 1999, he played his 825th career league game, breaking [[Terry Paine]]'s record for career appearances by an outfield player.\n\n===Coaching career===\nIn the summer of 1999, Parkin resigned as Mansfield manager to take a similar job at [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]]. Once again, he appointed Ford as his assistant, and despite now being well past 40, Ford continued to play regularly. The final goal of his career was the winner in a 1\u20130 win at Swansea City on 9 October 2001<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/1584523.stm\n|title=Swansea 0\u20131 Rochdale\n|publisher=BBC Sport\n|date=9 October 2001\n|accessdate=17 April 2012}}</ref> and his final professional appearance came the following month against Torquay United.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/1632758.stm\n|title=Rochdale 2\u20130 Torquay\n|publisher=BBC Sport\n|date=3 November 2001\n|accessdate=17 April 2012}}</ref> He finally retired from playing in November 2001 when he and Parkin took up the same positions at Barnsley understandably feeling himself unequal to Division One football once more. He was sacked along with Parkin some 11 months later but in August 2003 he returned to his old role at Rochdale under new manager [[Alan Buckley]]. He kept his job when Buckley made way for Parkin on 31 December 2003 but was sacked along with the latter three years later.\n\nHe went on to work for former club [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] as a scout but was relieved of his duties in May 2011.\n\n==Career statistics==\nSource:<ref>{{ENFA}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:

Through most of his career, Ford was a [[right midfielder|right-sided midfielder]], but in the later years of his career, he was converted to [[right-back]]. In a career that spanned 26 years, across four decades, Ford played no fewer than 931 [[The Football League|league]] matches, which is [[List of footballers in England and Scotland by number of league appearances|the all-time record for matches played in the English league by an outfield player]] with not one game played in the top-flight division. Only goalkeeper [[Peter Shilton]] (1005 matches) has played more. Ford is in fact only one of three outfield players to play in English football to have ever passed [[List of footballers with the most official appearances|1000 games in competitive matches]] (league and cup), the others being [[Scott McGleish]]<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/08/scott-mcgleish-1000-games-chesham-leyton-orient-striker-goal Scott McGleish at 44 and 1,000 games: \u2018I can\u2019t see myself giving up soon\u2019 | Football | The Guardian<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and [[Graham Alexander]].<ref name=\"alexander\">{{cite news |title=Burnley 2\u20131 Swansea  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/13022994.stm  |publisher=BBC News |date=14 April 2011 |accessdate=14 April 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Playing career===\nFord began his career at his hometown club [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]], where he made his first-team debut as a 16-year-old in October 1975. He spent 11 years at Blundell Park, where he made his name as one of the most talented players outside the top division. In 1986, he left Grimsby. He first had a short loan spell at [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], and later joined [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke]] in a permanent deal.\n\nFord spent two and a half years at Stoke, before being transferred to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich]] midway through the [[1988\u201389 in English football|1988\u201389]] season. After three years at The Hawthorns, he rejoined Grimsby in late 1991. His second spell at Blundell Park lasted three seasons, and he left the club at the end of the [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]] season, having played 423 league games for the club, which at the time placed him second on the club's career appearance list behind [[Keith Jobling]] (he has since been passed on that list by [[John McDermott (English footballer)|John McDermott]] and [[Paul Groves (footballer)|Paul Groves]]).\n\nIn 1994, Ford joined Grimsby's arch-rivals [[Scunthorpe United|Scunthorpe]], where he played two seasons. When he was released at the end of the [[1995\u201396 in English football|1995\u201396]] season, it seemed like his career at league level had come to an end. However, after a short spell at non-league side [[Barrow A.F.C.|Barrow]], he was asked by [[Steve Parkin]], a former teammate at Stoke and WBA, who had recently been appointed manager at [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield]] to become his assistant. This allowed Ford to continue his playing career, and in early 1999, he played his 825th career league game, breaking [[Terry Paine]]'s record for career appearances by an outfield player.\n\n===Coaching career===\nIn the summer of 1999, Parkin resigned as Mansfield manager to take a similar job at [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]]. Once again, he appointed Ford as his assistant, and despite now being well past 40, Ford continued to play regularly. The final goal of his career was the winner in a 1\u20130 win at Swansea City on 9 October 2001<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/1584523.stm\n|title=Swansea 0\u20131 Rochdale\n|publisher=BBC Sport\n|date=9 October 2001\n|accessdate=17 April 2012}}</ref> and his final professional appearance came the following month against Torquay United.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/1632758.stm\n|title=Rochdale 2\u20130 Torquay\n|publisher=BBC Sport\n|date=3 November 2001\n|accessdate=17 April 2012}}</ref> He finally retired from playing in November 2001 when he and Parkin took up the same positions at Barnsley understandably feeling himself unequal to Division One football once more. He was sacked along with Parkin some 11 months later but in August 2003 he returned to his old role at Rochdale under new manager [[Alan Buckley]]. He kept his job when Buckley made way for Parkin on 31 December 2003 but was sacked along with the latter three years later.\n\nHe went on to work for former club [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] as a scout but was relieved of his duties in May 2011.\n\n==Career statistics==\nSource:<ref>{{ENFA}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:

Some of the inhibitory effects include distance, physical barriers and host defenses.

Firstly, there must be sufficient quantity of virus available to initiate infection. Cells at the site of infection must be accessible, in that they possess host factors that the virus can exploit for entry into the cell, and the host anti-viral defense systems must be ineffective or absent.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name =\"raca\"/>\n\n===Implantation at point of entry===\nThe virus must implant at the entry portal of the body. Implantation is the earliest stage of pathogenesis. Implantation frequency is at its greatest where viruses directly contact living cells. Viruses usually implant on cells of respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin and genital tissues.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> Some viruses are capable of implanting in a fetus through infected germ cells at the time of [[fertilization]]. Implantation can also occur later in the pregnancy via the placenta, and also at birth.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Local replication and spread=== \nFollowing implantation, the virus hijacks the host cell machinery to undergo viral amplification. Here, the virus must modulate the host innate immune response to prevent its elimination by the body while facilitating its replication. Replicated virus from the initially infected cell then disperse to infect neighbouring susceptible cells, possibly with spread to different cell types like leukocytes. This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\">{{cite book |title=Molecular Pathology and the Dynamics of Disease |last=Mitchell |first=Maika G.  |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/C2016-0-04893-3 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=978-0-12-814610-1|date=2010-04-16 }}</ref>  Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]) are examples of localised infections.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> \n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus [[Envelope glycoprotein GP120|glycoprotein gp120]] initially uses CCR5 (mainly on macrophages) as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 (mainly on [[T cell]]s) as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n \nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells,<ref name=\"baron\"/> and JC viral gene expression requires host transcription factors expressed exclusively in glial cells.<ref name =\"robbins\"> {{cite book |title =Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=9 |editor1=Kumar, Vinay |editor2=Abbas, Abul K. |editor3=Aster, Jon C. |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780323313094|date =2014 }} </ref>\n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism.

In latent infections, reactivation of disease may occur a long time after the initial infection.]]\n\nImportantly, viral infections can differ by the \u201clifestyle strategy\u201d \u2013 infections can be generally categorised as acute or persistent. '''Acute infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, [[lytic cycle|lytic viruses]] are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nLytic viruses are capable of destroying host cells by incurring and/or interfering with the specialised functions of host cells. An example would be the triggering of [[necrosis]] in host cells infected with the virus. Otherwise, signatures of viral infection, like the binding of HIV to co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, can also trigger cell death via [[apoptosis]] through host signalling cascades by immune cells. However, many viruses encode proteins that can modulate apoptosis depending on whether the infection is acute or persistent. Induction of apoptosis, such as through interaction with [[caspase]]s, will promote viral shedding for lytic viruses to facilitate transmission, while viral inhibition of apoptosis could prolong the production of virus in cells, or allow the virus to remain hidden from the immune system in chronic, persistent infections.<ref name =\"robbins\" /><ref name=gonzalez/> Nevertheless, induction of apoptosis in major immune cells or [[antigen-presenting cell]]s may also act as a mechanism of [[immunosuppression]] in persistent infections like HIV. The primary cause of immunosuppression in HIV patients is due to the depletion of [[T helper cell|CD4+ T helper cells]].<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\nInterestingly, [[adenovirus]] has an '''[[Adenovirus early region 1A|E1A]]''' protein to induce apoptosis by initiating the cell cycle, and an '''[[Adenovirus E1B protein|E1B]]''' protein to block the apoptotic pathway through inhibition of caspase interaction.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Eileen White | title=Regulation of Apoptosis by Adenovirus E1A and E1B Oncogenes | journal=Seminars in Virology | volume=8 | year=1998 | pages=505-513 | url=https://doi.org/10.1006/smvy.1998.0155 }}  </ref>\n\nPersistent viruses can sometimes [[Carcinogenesis|transform host cells into cancer cells]].

This damage caused by the immune system is known as virus-induced [[immunopathology]]. \n\nSpecifically, immunopathology is caused by the excessive release of [[antibody|antibodies]], [[interferon]]s and pro-inflammatory [[cytokines]], activation of the [[complement system]], or hyperactivity of [[cytotoxic T cell]]s. Secretion of interferons and other cytokines can trigger cell damage, fever and flu-like symptoms.

The bystander mechanism hypothesizes the initiation of a non-specific and overreactive antiviral response that tackles self-antigens in the process.

The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs. Surprisingly, generalised infections by [[togaviruses]] have a short incubation period due to the direct entry of the virus into target cells through insect bites.<ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\nThere are several other factors that affect the incubation period. The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name=\"baron\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations. \n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits. The release of wild European rabbits in 1859 into Victoria, Australia for sport resulted in a rabbit plague. In order to curb with rabbit overpopulation, [[myxoma virus]], a lethal species-specific poxvirus responsible for myxomatosis in rabbits, was deliberately released in South Australia in 1950. This led to a 90% decrease in rabbit populations, and the disease became [[endemic]] in a span of five years. Significantly, severely attenuated strains of the myxoma virus were detected in merely 2 years of its release, and genetic resistance in rabbits emerged within seven years.<ref name=\"Kerr2012\">  {{Cite journal | author=Peter J Kerr | title=Myxomatosis in Australia and Europe: A model for emerging infectious diseases | journal=[[Antiviral Research]] | volume=93 | year=2012 | pages=387-415 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.01.009 }}  </ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pathogen]]\n*[[Pathogenesis]]\n*[[List of human diseases associated with infectious pathogens]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Virology]]\n", "text_old": "'''Viral pathogenesis''' is the study of how [[virus]]es cause diseases in their target [[Host (biology)|host]]s, usually carried out at the cellular or molecular level.

Firstly, there must be sufficient quantity of virus available to initiate infection. Cells at the site of infection must be accessible, in that they possess host factors that the virus can exploit for entry into the cell, and the host anti-viral defense systems must be ineffective or absent.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name =\"raca\"/>\n\n===Implantation at point of entry===\nThe virus must implant at the entry portal of the body. Implantation is the earliest stage of pathogenesis. Implantation frequency is at its greatest where viruses directly contact living cells. Viruses usually implant on cells of respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin and genital tissues.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> Some viruses are capable of implanting in a fetus through infected germ cells at the time of [[fertilization]]. Implantation can also occur later in the pregnancy via the placenta, and also at birth.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Local replication and spread=== \nFollowing implantation, the virus hijacks the host cell machinery to undergo viral amplification. Here, the virus must modulate the host innate immune response to prevent its elimination by the body while facilitating its replication. Replicated virus from the initially infected cell then disperse to infect neighbouring susceptible cells, possibly with spread to different cell types like leukocytes. This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\">{{cite book |title=Molecular Pathology and the Dynamics of Disease |last=Mitchell |first=Maika G.  |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/C2016-0-04893-3 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=978-0-12-814610-1|date=2010-04-16 }}</ref>  Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]) are examples of localised infections.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> \n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus [[Envelope glycoprotein GP120|glycoprotein gp120]] initially uses CCR5 (mainly on macrophages) as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell.

It is therefore hypothesized that the host immune system and defense mechanisms might differ with age.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\">{{cite book |title=Jawetz, Melnick, & Adelberg\u2019s Medical Microbiology |edition=28|last=Cann |first=Alan |page=[https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9] | year=2016 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780128011744 |date=2016-01-04 |url-access=registration |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9 }}</ref>\n\n==Disease mechanisms: How do viral infections cause disease?==\n\nA viral infection does not always cause disease. A viral infection simply involves viral replication in the host, but [[disease]] is the damage caused by the viral multiplication.<ref name=\"refMM\" /> An individual who has a viral infection but does not display disease symptoms is known as a [[Asymptomatic carrier|carrier]]. \n\n[[File:Damage caused by viruses to host cells.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|alt=Diagram representing the various ways viral infections can induce damage and disease to host cells|Mechanisms by which viruses cause damage and disease to host cells]]\n\n===Damage caused by the virus===\n\nOnce inside host cells, viruses can destroy cells through a variety of mechanisms.

Acute infections tend to occur for a relatively short duration, while persistent infections are when the virus is not completely cleared from the body. In latent infections, reactivation of disease may occur a long time after the initial infection.]]\n\nImportantly, viral infections can differ by the \u201clifestyle strategy\u201d \u2013 infections can be generally categorised as acute or persistent. '''Acute infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, [[lytic cycle|lytic viruses]] are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nLytic viruses are capable of destroying host cells by incurring and/or interfering with the specialised functions of host cells. An example would be the triggering of [[necrosis]] in host cells infected with the virus. Otherwise, signatures of viral infection, like the binding of HIV to co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, can also trigger cell death via [[apoptosis]] through host signalling cascades by immune cells. However, many viruses encode proteins that can modulate apoptosis depending on whether the infection is acute or persistent. Induction of apoptosis, such as through interaction with [[caspase]]s, will promote viral shedding for lytic viruses to facilitate transmission, while viral inhibition of apoptosis could prolong the production of virus in cells, or allow the virus to remain hidden from the immune system in chronic, persistent infections.<ref name =\"robbins\" /><ref name=gonzalez/> Nevertheless, induction of apoptosis in major immune cells or [[antigen-presenting cell]]s may also act as a mechanism of [[immunosuppression]] in persistent infections like HIV. The primary cause of immunosuppression in HIV patients is due to the depletion of [[T helper cell|CD4+ T helper cells]].<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\nInterestingly, [[adenovirus]] has an '''[[Adenovirus early region 1A|E1A]]''' protein to induce apoptosis by initiating the cell cycle, and an '''[[Adenovirus E1B protein|E1B]]''' protein to block the apoptotic pathway through inhibition of caspase interaction.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Eileen White | title=Regulation of Apoptosis by Adenovirus E1A and E1B Oncogenes | journal=Seminars in Virology | volume=8 | year=1998 | pages=505-513 | url=https://doi.org/10.1006/smvy.1998.0155 }}  </ref>\n\nPersistent viruses can sometimes [[Carcinogenesis|transform host cells into cancer cells]]. Viruses such as the [[human papillomavirus infection|human papillomavirus]] (HPV), [[human T-lymphotropic virus]] (HTLV) etc, can stimulate growth of tumours in infected hosts, either by disrupting tumour suppressor gene expression (HPV) or upregulating [[oncogene|proto-oncogene]] expression (HTLV).<ref name=\"modernvirology\" /><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Walther Mothes | author2=Nathan M.

The stimulation of the [[Innate immune system|innate]] and [[adaptive immune system|adaptive]] immune system in response to viral infections destroys infected cells, which may lead to severe pathological consequences to the host. This damage caused by the immune system is known as virus-induced [[immunopathology]]. \n\nSpecifically, immunopathology is caused by the excessive release of [[antibody|antibodies]], [[interferon]]s and pro-inflammatory [[cytokines]], activation of the [[complement system]], or hyperactivity of [[cytotoxic T cell]]s. Secretion of interferons and other cytokines can trigger cell damage, fever and flu-like symptoms. In severe cases of certain viral infections, as in the [[Global spread of H5N1 in 2005|avian H5N1 influenza pandemic in 2005]], aberrant induction of the host immune response can elicit a [[cytokine storm]].<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Tisoncik JR, Korth MJ, Simmons CP, Farrar J, Martin TR, Katze MG | title=Into the Eye of the Cytokine Storm | journal=[[Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews]] | volume=76 | year=2012 | pages=3826\u20133833 | doi=10.1128/MMBR.05015-11 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\nIn some instances, viral infection can initiate an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune response]], which occurs via two proposed mechanisms: '''molecular mimicry''' and '''bystander mechanism'''. [[Molecular mimicry]] refers to an overlap in structural similarity between a viral [[antigen]] and a self-antigen. The bystander mechanism hypothesizes the initiation of a non-specific and overreactive antiviral response that tackles self-antigens in the process. Damage caused by the host itself due to autoimmunity was observed in infections such as [[multiple sclerosis]] or the [[West Nile virus]].<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Smatti MK, Cyprian FS, Nasrallah GK, Al Thani AA, Almishal RO, Yassine HM | title=Viruses and Autoimmunity: A Review on the Potential Interaction and Molecular Mechanisms | journal=[[Viruses (journal)]] | volume=8 | year=2019 | doi=10.3390/v11080762 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\n==Incubation Period==\nViruses display variable [[incubation period]]s upon virus entry into the host. The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs. Surprisingly, generalised infections by [[togaviruses]] have a short incubation period due to the direct entry of the virus into target cells through insect bites.<ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\nThere are several other factors that affect the incubation period. The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name=\"baron\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations. \n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits. The release of wild European rabbits in 1859 into Victoria, Australia for sport resulted in a rabbit plague. In order to curb with rabbit overpopulation, [[myxoma virus]], a lethal species-specific poxvirus responsible for myxomatosis in rabbits, was deliberately released in South Australia in 1950. This led to a 90% decrease in rabbit populations, and the disease became [[endemic]] in a span of five years. Significantly, severely attenuated strains of the myxoma virus were detected in merely 2 years of its release, and genetic resistance in rabbits emerged within seven years.<ref name=\"Kerr2012\">  {{Cite journal | author=Peter J Kerr | title=Myxomatosis in Australia and Europe: A model for emerging infectious diseases | journal=[[Antiviral Research]] | volume=93 | year=2012 | pages=387-415 | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.01.009 }}  </ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pathogen]]\n*[[Pathogenesis]]\n*[[List of human diseases associated with infectious pathogens]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Virology]]\n", "name_user": "Isabellelyy", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eVirus factors", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_pathogenesis"}
