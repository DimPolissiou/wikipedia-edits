This frenzy first occurred in Berlin in 1841 and the term was later coined by [[Heinrich Heine]] in a [[feuilleton]] he wrote on April 25, 1844, discussing the 1844 Parisian concert season. Lisztomania was characterized by intense levels of [[hysteria]] demonstrated by fans, akin to the treatment of [[celebrity]] musicians today \u2013 but in a time not known for such musical excitement.\n\n==When was Franz liszt born?==\n[[Franz Liszt]] began receiving [[piano]] lessons at the age of seven from his father [[Adam Liszt]], a talented musician who played the [[piano]], [[violin]], [[cello]], and [[guitar]], and who knew [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]], and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] personally. By age 11, Franz Liszt was already composing music and appearing in concerts. As he grew older, Liszt continued to study and develop his expertise at playing piano.\n\nIn 1839 [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] began an extensive tour of Europe, which he continued for the next eight years. This period was Liszt's most brilliant as a concert pianist and he received many honours and much adulation during his tours. Scholars have called these years a period of \"transcendental execution\" for Liszt.<ref name='NY Times'>{{cite news|first=Johanna |last=Keller |title=In Search of a Liszt to Be Loved |date=14 January 2001 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/14/arts/14KELL.html?pagewanted=all |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=14 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420024121/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/14/arts/14KELL.html?pagewanted=all |archivedate=April 20, 2011 }}</ref> During this period, the first reports of intense responses from Liszt's fans appeared, which became referred to as Lisztomania.\n\nLiszt arrived in Berlin around Christmas 1841 and word of his arrival soon spread.<ref name=W371>Walker, ''Virtuoso Years'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=lCw4cxHmpgYC&pg=PA371 371.]</ref> That night, a group of thirty students serenaded him with a performance of his song \"Rheinweinlied\".<ref name=W371 /> He later played his first recital in Berlin on December 27, 1841, at the [[Sing-Akademie zu Berlin]] to an enthusiastic crowd.

Heine wrote a series of musical [[feuilleton]]s over several different music seasons discussing the music of the day. His review of the musical season of 1844, written in Paris on April 25, 1844, is the first place where he uses the term Lisztomania:\n\n{{quote|When formerly I heard of the fainting spells which broke out in Germany and specially in Berlin, when Liszt showed himself there, I shrugged my shoulders pityingly and thought: quiet sabbatarian Germany does not wish to lose the opportunity of getting the little necessary exercise permitted it...

Yet I was mistaken, after all, and I did not notice it until last week, at the Italian Opera House, where Liszt gave his first concert...This was truly no Germanically sentimental, sentimentalizing Berlinate audience, before which Liszt played, quite alone, or rather, accompanied solely by his genius. And yet, how convulsively his mere appearance affected them! How boisterous was the applause which rang to meet him!...[W]hat acclaim it was!

Instead, Lisztomania had much more of a medical emphasis because the term \"mania\" was a much stronger term in the 1840s, whereas in the 20th century \"mania\" could refer to something as mild as a new fashion craze. Lisztomania was considered by some a genuine [[Contagious disease|contagious]] medical condition and critics recommended measures to [[Immunization|immunize]] the public.<ref name=Gooley />\n\nSome critics of the day thought that Lisztomania, or \"Liszt fever\" as it was sometimes called, was mainly a reflection of the attitudes of Berliners and Northern Germans and that Southern German cities would not have such episodes of Lisztomania because of the difference in constitutions of the populace. As one report stated in a Munich paper in 1843:\n\n{{quote|Liszt fever, a contagion that breaks out in every city our artist visits, and which neither age nor wisdom can protect, seems to appear here only sporadically, and asphyxiating cases such as appeared so often in northern capitals need not be feared by our residents, with their strong constitutions.<ref name=Gooley>{{cite book | last = Gooley | first = Dana Andrew | title = The virtuoso Liszt | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2004 | pages = 201\u201335 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=koSQAjlxeOIC&pg=PA201&dq=alan+walker+lisztomania&cd=1#v=onepage&q=alan%20walker%20lisztomania&f=false | isbn = 0-521-83443-0}}</ref>}}\n\n==Causes==\nThere was no known cause for Lisztomania, but there were attempts to explain the condition. Heine tried to explain the cause of Lisztomania in the same letter in which he first used the term. In that letter he wrote:\n{{quote|What is the reason of this phenomenon? The solution of this question belongs to the domain of pathology rather than that of aesthetics. A physician, whose speciality is female diseases, and whom I asked to explain the magic our Liszt exerted upon the public, smiled in the strangest manner, and at the same time said all sorts of things about [[magnetism]], [[galvanism]], [[electricity]], of the contagion of the close hall filled with countless wax lights and several hundred perfumed and perspiring human beings, of historical epilepsy, of the phenomenon of [[tickling]], of musical [[cantharides|cantherides]], and other scabrous things, which, I believe have reference to the mysteries of the ''[[Bona Dea|bona dea]].'' Perhaps the solution of the question is not buried in such adventurous depths, but floats on a very prosaic surface. It seems to me at times that all this sorcery may be explained by the fact that no one on earth knows so well how to organize his successes, or rather their ''mise en scene'', as our Franz Liszt.<ref name='Heines letter' />}}\n\nDana Gooley argues that different people attributed the cause of Lisztomania in Berlin audiences in a different manner based on their political leanings at the time; furthermore, those who had a [[wikt:progressive|progressive]] view of affairs thought that the outpouring of emotions by Berlin audiences was largely a side effect of the repressive and censorious state and that the enthusiasm for Liszt was \"compensatory, an illusory substitute for the lack of agency and public participation among Berliners\". The opposing positive view of Lisztomania was that it was a response to Liszt's great benevolence and charity.<ref name=Gooley /> This view was explained as follows:\n\n{{quote|[[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm&nbsp;IV's]] optimistic and popular political rhetoric, with its promise of liberal social reforms, predisposed the Berlin public to appreciate Liszt's various gestures in support of charitable, humanitarian causes, as they saw themselves and their monarch echoes in Liszt's benevolence. But significantly, they found evidence of it not solely in his donations. His personal openness, his behavior towards audiences, and his performing style all became emblems of \"charity\" as well.<ref name=Gooley />}}\n\nOne contributing factor to Lisztomania is also assumed to have been that Liszt, in his younger years, was known to be a handsome man.<ref>[http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160817-franz-liszt-the-worlds-first-musical-superstar BBC - Culture - \"Forget The Beatles - Liszt was music's first 'superstar.'\" August 17, 2016.] Read May 4, 2019.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Stendhal syndrome]]\n* [[Collective behaviour]]\n* [[Fad]]\n* [[Beatlemania]]\n* [[Lisztomania (film)|''Lisztomania'' (film)]]\n* [[Lisztomania (song)|\"Lisztomania\" (song)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Alan Walker (musicologist)|Walker, Alan]]: ''Franz Liszt, The Virtuoso Years (1811\u20131847)'', revised edition, [[Cornell University Press]] 1987.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20170228080446/http://www.lisztomania.at/no_cache/home/ Lisztomania 2011 Festival], Burgenland, Austria\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20170707203128/http://necmusic.edu/liszt Lisztomania 2011], festival of seven concerts at [[New England Conservatory]], Boston\n*[https://www.npr.org/2011/10/22/141617637/how-franz-liszt-became-the-worlds-first-rock-star/ \"How Franz Liszt Became The World's First Rock Star\"], [[NPR]] story about Lisztomania\n\n{{Franz Liszt}}\n{{Heinrich Heine}}\n\n[[Category:Franz Liszt]]\n[[Category:History of European art music]]\n[[Category:Mania]]\n[[Category:Somatic symptom disorders]]\n[[Category:Music fandom]]\n[[Category:1840s in music]]\n[[Category:1840s in Europe]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the fan frenzy towards Franz Liszt|other uses|Lisztomania (disambiguation)}}\n[[File:Liszt in 1843.jpg|thumb|upright|Liszt in 1843]]\n'''Lisztomania''' or '''Liszt fever''' was the intense fan frenzy directed toward Hungarian composer [[Franz Liszt]] during his performances.
