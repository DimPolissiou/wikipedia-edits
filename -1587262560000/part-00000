He was a gifted public speaker and singer of religious songs. He provided impetus to the Arya Samaj movement in Fiji. Under his influence Arya Samaj schools and temples were established in Fiji. He was responsible for the establishment of the ''[[Hindu Maha Sabha (Fiji)|Hindu Maha Sabha]]'' for the purpose of uniting all [[Hindus]] in Fiji. He advocated ''[[shuddhi]]'' (reconversion to Hinduism) and this caused conflict with [[Muslim]]s and [[Christians]] in Fiji.\n\nSharma also started a monthly Hindi language newspaper called the ''Vedic Sandesh''.<ref name=\"Kanwal1980\">{{cite book |last=Kanwal |first=J.
