The [[Bronx\u2013Whitestone Bridge]] is approximately 8.5 miles (14&nbsp;km) south of the town. It is also 13 miles (21&nbsp;km) northeast of [[LaGuardia Airport]] and 19.5 miles (31&nbsp;km) north of [[John F.

It included all of [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]] and present-day [[Pelham Bay Park]] east of the [[Hutchinson River]]. In 1889, the town was incorporated at its current boundaries. In 1891, the village of Pelham Manor incorporated. In 1896, the village of North Pelham and the village of Pelham incorporated.

In July 1896 a frame church was built in the newly incorporated village of Pelham on land donated by Mr. and Mrs. Patrick Farrell. In December 1897 St. Catharine's became a separate parish with Rev. Francis P. McNichol as first pastor. A school was established in 1904, staffed by the Sisters of St. Francis. At the end of the school year in 1983 St. Catharine's School closed bringing to an end 75 years of Catholic education in the parish. The school building was converted to a Parish Center to provide space for Religious Education classes, parish activities and groups to meet.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://olph-pelhammanor.org/web/index.php/about-us/parish-history |title=\"Parish History\", Our Lady of Perpetual Help-St. Catherine Parish |access-date=2016-12-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202170501/http://olph-pelhammanor.org/web/index.php/about-us/parish-history |archive-date=2016-12-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A new church was dedicated in 1909.<ref name=Lafort>[https://books.google.com/books?id=KL4YAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA399 Lafort, Remigius.

The growth continued until the second half of the 20th century, when tourism declined and some local industries closed. A regeneration programme is being undertaken with attractions including the [[The Helicopter Museum (Weston)|Helicopter Museum]], [[Weston Museum]], and the [[Grand Pier, Weston-super-Mare|Grand Pier]].

Weston owes its growth and prosperity to the [[Victorian era]] boom in seaside holidays. Construction of the first hotel in the village started in 1808; it was called \"Reeves\" (now the Royal Hotel).<ref name=\"somharbours\">{{cite book |title=Somerset harbours, including the port of Bristol |last=Farr |first=Grahame Edgar |authorlink= |year=1954 |publisher=Christopher Johnson |location=London |isbn= |pages=76\u201379 }}</ref> Along with nearby [[Burnham-on-Sea]], Weston benefited from proximity to [[Bristol]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and [[South Wales]].

With the opening of the railway in 1841, thousands of visitors came to the town from Bristol, the [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]] and further afield, on works outings and [[bank holiday]]s. Mining families also came across the [[Bristol Channel]] from South Wales by [[steamboat|paddle steamer]]. To cater for them, [[Birnbeck Pier]] was completed in 1867, offering in its heyday [[amusement arcade]]s, tea rooms, [[amusement ride]]s and a [[photography|photographic]] studio.

Large detached villas, for the middle classes, were built on the southern slopes of Worlebury Hill. Semi-detached and terraced housing was built on the low \"moorland\" behind the sea front in an area known as South Ward. Many of these houses have now been converted into [[bedsit]]s. Most of the houses built in the Victorian era are built from stone and feature details made from [[Bath Stone]], influenced by local architect [[Hans Price]].\n\nIn 1885, the first transatlantic telegraph cable of the [[Commercial Cable Company]] was brought ashore and the company started a long association with the town, ending in 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cial.org.uk/cable13.htm|title=The Commercial Cable Company, early development as told by the president and others|publisher=John Crellin|accessdate=20 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Guglielmo Marconi]], the inventor of wireless telegraphy, successfully transmitted radio signals across the Bristol Channel in the spring of 1897, from Penarth (near Cardiff) to [[Brean Down]] (just south west of Weston, on the other side of the [[River Axe (Bristol Channel)|River Axe]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swehs.co.uk/archives/news03su.pdf|title=Marconi \u2013 the Father of Radio|last=Phillips|first=Barrie|year=1996|work=Supplement to Histalec News NO.3|publisher=South Western Electricity Historical Society|accessdate=20 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nA second railway, the [[Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Light Railway]], opened on 1 December 1897, connecting Weston to [[Clevedon]].<ref name=maggswcp>Maggs, Colin G.

It lies by the [[Bristol Channel]] {{convert|18|mi|km|0}} south west of [[Bristol]] between [[Worlebury Hill]] and [[Bleadon Hill]]. It includes the suburbs of Oldmixon, West Wick and [[Worle]].

The growth continued until the second half of the 20th century, when tourism declined and some local industries closed. A regeneration programme is being undertaken with attractions including the [[The Helicopter Museum (Weston)|Helicopter Museum]], [[Weston Museum]], and the [[Grand Pier, Weston-super-Mare|Grand Pier]]. The [[PS Waverley|Paddle Steamer ''Waverley'']] and [[MV Balmoral (1949)|MV ''Balmoral'']] offer day sea trips from Knightstone Island to various destinations along the Bristol Channel and [[Severn Estuary]]. Cultural venues include [[The Playhouse, Weston-super-Mare|The Playhouse]], the [[Winter Gardens Pavilion, Weston-super-Mare|Winter Gardens]] and the [[The Blakehay Theatre, Weston-super-Mare|Blakehay Theatre]].\n\nPartly owing to the large [[tidal range]] in the Bristol Channel, the low tide mark in [[Weston Bay]] is about {{convert|1|mi|km}} from the seafront. Although the beach itself is sandy, low tide uncovers areas of thick mud, hence the colloquial name, Weston-super-Mud.<ref>{{cite web|title=Weston super Mare|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/place_page.jsp?p_id=703|work=Vision of Britain|publisher=University of Portsmouth|accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Weston super Mare|url=http://www.bristolnomads.org.uk/location_reports/s_bristol_channel/wsm.htm|publisher=Bristol Nomads|accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Miles of Golden Sands|url=http://www.weston-super-mare.com/Beach-GoldenSands|publisher=Weston super Mare|accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref> These [[mudflat]]s are very dangerous to walk in and are crossed by the mouth of the [[River Axe (Bristol Channel)|River Axe]].

Weston owes its growth and prosperity to the [[Victorian era]] boom in seaside holidays. Construction of the first hotel in the village started in 1808; it was called \"Reeves\" (now the Royal Hotel).<ref name=\"somharbours\">{{cite book |title=Somerset harbours, including the port of Bristol |last=Farr |first=Grahame Edgar |authorlink= |year=1954 |publisher=Christopher Johnson |location=London |isbn= |pages=76\u201379 }}</ref> Along with nearby [[Burnham-on-Sea]], Weston benefited from proximity to [[Bristol]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] and [[South Wales]]. The first attempt at an artificial harbour was made in the late 1820s at the islet of Knightstone and a slipway built from Anchor Head towards Birnbeck Island.<ref name=\"somharbours\"/>\n\n[[File:Birnbeck Pier and Island.jpg |thumb |alt=Structure supported on metal legs crossing the sea to an island which has some buildings on it.

With the opening of the railway in 1841, thousands of visitors came to the town from Bristol, the [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]] and further afield, on works outings and [[bank holiday]]s. Mining families also came across the [[Bristol Channel]] from South Wales by [[steamboat|paddle steamer]]. To cater for them, [[Birnbeck Pier]] was completed in 1867, offering in its heyday [[amusement arcade]]s, tea rooms, [[amusement ride]]s and a [[photography|photographic]] studio. It is now in a derelict state and has been added to [[English Heritage]]'s [[Heritage at Risk Register|Buildings at Risk Register]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/advice/heritage-at-risk/search-register/list-entry/46865|title=Birnbeck Pier|work=Heritage at Risk|publisher=Historic England|accessdate=10 February 2018}}</ref> but visitors can still admire its structure from behind barbed wire.

Large detached villas, for the middle classes, were built on the southern slopes of Worlebury Hill. Semi-detached and terraced housing was built on the low \"moorland\" behind the sea front in an area known as South Ward. Many of these houses have now been converted into [[bedsit]]s. Most of the houses built in the Victorian era are built from stone and feature details made from [[Bath Stone]], influenced by local architect [[Hans Price]].\n\nIn 1885, the first transatlantic telegraph cable of the [[Commercial Cable Company]] was brought ashore and the company started a long association with the town, ending in 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cial.org.uk/cable13.htm|title=The Commercial Cable Company, early development as told by the president and others|publisher=John Crellin|accessdate=20 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Guglielmo Marconi]], the inventor of wireless telegraphy, successfully transmitted radio signals across the Bristol Channel in the spring of 1897, from Penarth (near Cardiff) to [[Brean Down]] (just south west of Weston, on the other side of the [[River Axe (Bristol Channel)|River Axe]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swehs.co.uk/archives/news03su.pdf|title=Marconi \u2013 the Father of Radio|last=Phillips|first=Barrie|year=1996|work=Supplement to Histalec News NO.3|publisher=South Western Electricity Historical Society|accessdate=20 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nA second railway, the [[Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Light Railway]], opened on 1 December 1897, connecting Weston to [[Clevedon]].<ref name=maggswcp>Maggs, Colin G.

Notable among the architects working in the 19th century was [[Hans Price]] (1835\u20131912). Many examples of his work are still to be seen: the Town Hall, the ''Mercury'' Office, the Constitutional Club (originally the Lodge of St Kew), villas and numerous other domestic dwellings. The [[Odeon Cinema, Weston-super-Mare|Odeon Cinema]] by [[Thomas Cecil Howitt]] is notable for fully retaining many [[Art Deco]] features both internally and externally, and retaining its original [[theatre organ]], a [[John Compton (organ builder)|Compton]] from 1935.
