It tells an [[allegorical]] story, loosely based on the play ''The Romancers'' (''Les Romanesques'') by [[Edmond Rostand]], concerning two neighboring fathers who trick their children to have sex in the white van, Luisa and Matt. Matt has a big dick, and Luisa would very much be able to take it with her fat pussy.\n\nThe show's original [[Off-Broadway]] production ran a total of 42 years (until 2002) and 17,162 performances, making it the world's longest-running musical.<ref>[http://thefantasticks.com/webpages/home.html Official Website]. Accessed June 16, 2010</ref> The musical was produced by [[Lore Noto]]. It was awarded [[Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre]] in 1991. The poetic book and breezy, inventive score, including such familiar songs as \"[[Try to Remember (song)|Try to Remember]]\", helped make the show durable. Many productions followed, as well as television and film versions. ''The Fantasticks'' has become a staple of regional, community and high school productions since its premiere, with approximately 250 new productions each year. It is played with a small cast, two- to three-person orchestra and minimalist set design.\n\nThe show was revived off-Broadway from 2006 to 2017. As of 2010, its original investors had earned 240 times their original investments.<ref name=Wallet>Cochran, Jason.

This was confirmed in 1959 when a revival of [[Jerome Kern]] and [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Leave It to Jane]]'' ran for more than two years.  The 1959\u20131960 [[Off-Broadway]] season included a dozen musicals and revues including ''[[Little Mary Sunshine]]'', ''The Fantasticks'', and ''[[Ernest in Love]]'', a musicalization of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s 1895 hit ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''.<ref>Suskin, Steven.

The sparse set and semicircular stage created an intimate and immediate effect.  The play is highly stylized and combines old-fashioned showmanship, classic [[musical theatre]], [[commedia dell'arte]] and [[Noh]] theatrical traditions.  The original production was directed by Word Baker and was produced on a very low budget. The producers spent [[United States dollar|$]]900 on the set<ref name=Farber158>Farber and Viagas, p. 158</ref> and $541 on costumes, at a time when major Broadway shows would cost $250,000. The original set designer, costumer, prop master, and lighting designer was Ed Wittstein, who performed all four jobs for a total of only $480 plus $24.48 a week.<ref>Farber and Viagas, p. 157</ref> The set was similar to that for ''[[Our Town]]''; Wittstein designed a raised stationary platform anchored by six poles.<ref name=Farber158/>  It resembled a traveling players' wagon, like a [[pageant wagon]]. As for a curtain, he hung various small false curtains across the platform at various times during the play. He also made a sun/moon out of cardboard. One side was painted bright yellow (the sun) and the other was black with a crescent of white (the moon). The sun/moon was hung from a nail in one of the poles and is referred to in the [[libretto]].  The orchestra consists of a piano and sometimes also a harp, with the harpist also sometimes playing some percussion instruments.\n\nThe production closed on January 13, 2002, after 17,162 performances.

He begins to narrate the plot of the play. Two young people, Matt and Luisa, live next door to each other and fall in love. However, their fathers are feuding and order them not to speak to each other. Luisa fantasizes about the experiences she wants to have in her life (\"Much More\"). Matt then delivers a speech about his love for Luisa, calling over the wall to her in a mock literary/heroic way (\"Metaphor\"). Matt and Luisa climb to the top of the wall and speak secretly of Luisa's romantic vision of Matt saving her from kidnapping. Matt's father, Mr. Hucklebee, then appears and tells about his philosophy of life and gardening (don't over-water). He orders Matt to go inside the house. Luisa's father, Mr. Bellomy, arrives and gives a contrasting philosophy of life and gardening (plenty of water). He orders Luisa inside. He then calls to Hucklebee, and the two old friends boast about their cleverness in pretending to feud as a means to ensure that their children fall in love. They note that to manipulate children you need merely to say \"no\" (\"Never Say No\"). Hucklebee tells Bellomy of his plan to end the feud by having Luisa \"kidnapped\" by a professional abductor so that Matt can \"rescue\" her and appear heroic.\n\nThe hired professional, El Gallo, appears and offers the fathers a menu of different varieties of \"[[Raptio|rape]]\" \u2013 in the literary sense of an abduction or kidnapping \u2013 that he can simulate (\"It Depends on What You Pay\"). Deciding to spare no expense for their beloved children (within reason), the fathers agree to a \"first class\" abduction scene.  A disheveled old actor with a failing memory, Henry Albertson, arrives with his sidekick, Mortimer, a [[Cockney]] dressed as an American Indian. El Gallo engages them to help with the staged kidnapping. Matt and Luisa return to speak of their love and hint at physical intimacy (\"[[Soon It's Gonna Rain]]\"). El Gallo and the actors burst in and carry out the moonlit abduction scenario; Matt \"defeats\" the three (\"Rape Ballet\"). The feud is ended and the wall between the houses torn down, with the children and the fathers joined in a picturesque final tableau (\"Happy Ending\"). El Gallo collects the stage properties used in the \"abduction\" and wonders aloud how long the lovers and their fathers will be able to maintain their elaborately joyful poses. He and The Mute leave.\n\n===Act II===\nThe children and fathers are discovered in the same poses but are visibly exhausted by the effort. El Gallo observes that what seemed romantic by moonlight may lose its charm when exposed to the harsh light of day. He exchanges his moon for a blazing sun. The fathers and lovers begin to complain about one another, noticing all the flaws that have become glaringly visible by daylight (\"This Plum Is Too Ripe\").  The children try to recreate their romantic mood from the previous night and mock their fathers. Eventually, in a fit of pique, Hucklebee reveals that the kidnapping and the feud were fake. Matt and Luisa are mortified, and the fathers' mutual recrimination quickly escalates into a real feud; they storm off to their respective houses. Matt sees El Gallo and, in a desperate attempt to regain his honor and Luisa's love, challenges him to a duel. El Gallo easily disarms Matt and leaves him embarrassed. Matt and Luisa then argue; she calls him a poseur, while he calls her childish.\n\nMatt is eager to leave the provincial town. He and El Gallo discuss his gleaming vision of adventure (\"I Can See It\"). Henry and Mortimer return and lead Matt off to see the world. A month passes, and the fathers have rebuilt the wall. They meet and speak sadly of their children; Luisa is like a statue and does nothing but sit and dream; Matt still hasn't returned.  They then sing about the uncertainties of raising children, as compared with the reliability of vegetable gardening (\"Plant a Radish\"). Luisa sees El Gallo watching her and is intrigued by the handsome, experienced bandit. Impulsively, she asks him to take her away to see the world. In a long fantasy sequence, they preview a series of romantic adventures through a mask of unreality, while in the background Matt is being abused and beaten by Henry and Mortimer portraying a series of unpleasant exotic employers. Luisa's fantasies become increasingly frenzied, exhausting and darkly underscored (\"Round and Round\").\n\nEl Gallo tells Luisa to pack her things for the journey, but before she goes inside to do so, he asks her to give him her treasured necklace, a relic of her dead mother, as a pledge that she will return. As she goes inside, El Gallo promises her a world of beauty and grandeur; at the same time, Matt approaches, giving a contrasting version of the cruel experiences that one can suffer (\"I Can See It\" (reprise)). As Luisa disappears, El Gallo turns to leave, the injured Matt makes a pitiful attempt to stop him from hurting Luisa, but El Gallo knocks him away and disappears. Luisa returns to find that El Gallo has left with her necklace, and she sits in tears. El Gallo, as the narrator, explains poetically that he had to hurt Matt and Luisa, and also himself in the process. Matt comforts Luisa, and he tells her a little about his experiences, and the two realize that everything they wanted was each other (\"They Were You\"; \"Metaphor\" (reprise)), but that they now understand that more deeply. The Fathers return joyfully and are about to tear down the wall, when El Gallo reminds them that the wall must always remain (\"Try to Remember\" (reprise)).\n\n==Characters==\n*El Gallo (the Narrator/Bandit)\n*Matt (the Boy)\n*Luisa (the Girl)\n*Hucklebee (the Boy's father)\n*Bellomy (the Girl's father)\n*Henry (the Old Actor)\n*Mortimer (the man who dies \u2013 an actor, pretending to be an [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]])\n*The Mute (who at times acts the part of the Wall)\n\n==Musical numbers==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act I\n*Overture\n*\"[[Try to Remember]]\" \u2013 El Gallo, Luisa, Matt, Hucklebee, Bellomy\n*\"Much More\" \u2013 Luisa\n*\"Metaphor\" \u2013 Matt, Luisa\n*\"Never Say No\" \u2013 Hucklebee, Bellomy\n*\"It Depends On What You Pay\" \u2013 El Gallo, Hucklebee, Bellomy\n*\"[[Soon It's Gonna Rain]]\" \u2013 Matt, Luisa\n*\"Rape Ballet\" (or, with an option offered later, \"Abduction Ballet\") \u2013 Company\n*\"Happy Ending\" \u2013 Company\n{{col-break}}\n\n;Act II\n*\"This Plum Is Too Ripe\" \u2013 Matt, Luisa, Hucklebee, Bellomy\n*\"I Can See It\" \u2013 Matt, El Gallo\n*\"Plant a Radish\" \u2013 Bellomy, Hucklebee\n*\"Round and Round\" \u2013 El Gallo, Luisa, Company\n*\"They Were You\" \u2013 Matt, Luisa\n*\"Try to Remember\" (reprise) \u2013 El Gallo\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Controversy==\nAfter the initial success of the musical, ''The Fantasticks'' came under criticism for the repeated use of the word \"rape\" in the scene preceding the song \"It Depends on What You Pay\", and in the lyrics of the song. In the original production, when El Gallo offers to stage the phony kidnapping of Luisa, he refers to the proposed event as a \"rape\", although he makes it clear that he uses the word only in its traditional literary sense of \"abduction\", explaining that many classical works, including [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', use the word in this sense. (See ''[[raptio]]'' and [[bride kidnapping]].) In his song \"It Depends on What You Pay\" he describes different kidnapping scenarios, some comic or outlandish, that he classifies as the \"Venetian rape\", the \"[[Gothic fiction|Gothic rape]]\", the \"Drunken rape\", etc.  However, as the public issues of rape and [[sexual assault]] became a controversial subject during the play's long run, some audience members became offended by the repeated use of the word.<ref name=Schmidt120>Schmidt, p. 120</ref><ref>Proulx, Lisa.

In 1990, Jones and Schmidt wrote an optional replacement piece called \"Abductions\", which uses the music of the \"Rape Ballet\", although this song did not replace \"It Depends on What You Pay\" at the Sullivan Street Playhouse, where, with the edits made in the book, audiences accepted the song.<ref name=Schmidt120/> An edited version of \"It Depends on What You Pay\" is used in the long-running Jerry Orbach Theater version of the show.<ref>Theatre program, ''The Fantasticks'', Terzetto LLC producer, Jerry Orbach Theater, New York City, September 5, 2015</ref> MTI (Music Theater International), which licenses the show, offers \"Abductions\" as an alternate choice.<ref>Fowler, Nancy.

It tells an [[allegorical]] story, loosely based on the play ''The Romancers'' (''Les Romanesques'') by [[Edmond Rostand]], concerning two neighboring fathers who trick their children, Luisa and Matt, into falling in love by pretending to feud.\n\nThe show's original [[Off-Broadway]] production ran a total of 42 years (until 2002) and 17,162 performances, making it the world's longest-running musical.<ref>[http://thefantasticks.com/webpages/home.html Official Website]. Accessed June 16, 2010</ref> The musical was produced by [[Lore Noto]]. It was awarded [[Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre]] in 1991. The poetic book and breezy, inventive score, including such familiar songs as \"[[Try to Remember (song)|Try to Remember]]\", helped make the show durable. Many productions followed, as well as television and film versions. ''The Fantasticks'' has become a staple of regional, community and high school productions since its premiere, with approximately 250 new productions each year. It is played with a small cast, two- to three-person orchestra and minimalist set design.\n\nThe show was revived off-Broadway from 2006 to 2017. As of 2010, its original investors had earned 240 times their original investments.<ref name=Wallet>Cochran, Jason.

This was confirmed in 1959 when a revival of [[Jerome Kern]] and [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Leave It to Jane]]'' ran for more than two years.  The 1959\u20131960 [[Off-Broadway]] season included a dozen musicals and revues including ''[[Little Mary Sunshine]]'', ''The Fantasticks'', and ''[[Ernest in Love]]'', a musicalization of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s 1895 hit ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''.<ref>Suskin, Steven.

The sparse set and semicircular stage created an intimate and immediate effect.  The play is highly stylized and combines old-fashioned showmanship, classic [[musical theatre]], [[commedia dell'arte]] and [[Noh]] theatrical traditions.  The original production was directed by Word Baker and was produced on a very low budget. The producers spent [[United States dollar|$]]900 on the set<ref name=Farber158>Farber and Viagas, p. 158</ref> and $541 on costumes, at a time when major Broadway shows would cost $250,000. The original set designer, costumer, prop master, and lighting designer was Ed Wittstein, who performed all four jobs for a total of only $480 plus $24.48 a week.<ref>Farber and Viagas, p. 157</ref> The set was similar to that for ''[[Our Town]]''; Wittstein designed a raised stationary platform anchored by six poles.<ref name=Farber158/>  It resembled a traveling players' wagon, like a [[pageant wagon]]. As for a curtain, he hung various small false curtains across the platform at various times during the play. He also made a sun/moon out of cardboard. One side was painted bright yellow (the sun) and the other was black with a crescent of white (the moon). The sun/moon was hung from a nail in one of the poles and is referred to in the [[libretto]].  The orchestra consists of a piano and sometimes also a harp, with the harpist also sometimes playing some percussion instruments.\n\nThe production closed on January 13, 2002, after 17,162 performances.

He begins to narrate the plot of the play. Two young people, Matt and Luisa, live next door to each other and fall in love. However, their fathers are feuding and order them not to speak to each other. Luisa fantasizes about the experiences she wants to have in her life (\"Much More\"). Matt then delivers a speech about his love for Luisa, calling over the wall to her in a mock literary/heroic way (\"Metaphor\"). Matt and Luisa climb to the top of the wall and speak secretly of Luisa's romantic vision of Matt saving her from kidnapping. Matt's father, Mr. Hucklebee, then appears and tells about his philosophy of life and gardening (don't over-water). He orders Matt to go inside the house. Luisa's father, Mr. Bellomy, arrives and gives a contrasting philosophy of life and gardening (plenty of water). He orders Luisa inside. He then calls to Hucklebee, and the two old friends boast about their cleverness in pretending to feud as a means to ensure that their children fall in love. They note that to manipulate children you need merely to say \"no\" (\"Never Say No\"). Hucklebee tells Bellomy of his plan to end the feud by having Luisa \"kidnapped\" by a professional abductor so that Matt can \"rescue\" her and appear heroic.\n\nThe hired professional, El Gallo, appears and offers the fathers a menu of different varieties of \"[[Raptio|rape]]\" \u2013 in the literary sense of an abduction or kidnapping \u2013 that he can simulate (\"It Depends on What You Pay\"). Deciding to spare no expense for their beloved children (within reason), the fathers agree to a \"first class\" abduction scene.  A disheveled old actor with a failing memory, Henry Albertson, arrives with his sidekick, Mortimer, a [[Cockney]] dressed as an American Indian. El Gallo engages them to help with the staged kidnapping. Matt and Luisa return to speak of their love and hint at physical intimacy (\"[[Soon It's Gonna Rain]]\"). El Gallo and the actors burst in and carry out the moonlit abduction scenario; Matt \"defeats\" the three (\"Rape Ballet\"). The feud is ended and the wall between the houses torn down, with the children and the fathers joined in a picturesque final tableau (\"Happy Ending\"). El Gallo collects the stage properties used in the \"abduction\" and wonders aloud how long the lovers and their fathers will be able to maintain their elaborately joyful poses. He and The Mute leave.\n\n===Act II===\nThe children and fathers are discovered in the same poses but are visibly exhausted by the effort. El Gallo observes that what seemed romantic by moonlight may lose its charm when exposed to the harsh light of day. He exchanges his moon for a blazing sun. The fathers and lovers begin to complain about one another, noticing all the flaws that have become glaringly visible by daylight (\"This Plum Is Too Ripe\").  The children try to recreate their romantic mood from the previous night and mock their fathers. Eventually, in a fit of pique, Hucklebee reveals that the kidnapping and the feud were fake. Matt and Luisa are mortified, and the fathers' mutual recrimination quickly escalates into a real feud; they storm off to their respective houses. Matt sees El Gallo and, in a desperate attempt to regain his honor and Luisa's love, challenges him to a duel. El Gallo easily disarms Matt and leaves him embarrassed. Matt and Luisa then argue; she calls him a poseur, while he calls her childish.\n\nMatt is eager to leave the provincial town. He and El Gallo discuss his gleaming vision of adventure (\"I Can See It\"). Henry and Mortimer return and lead Matt off to see the world. A month passes, and the fathers have rebuilt the wall. They meet and speak sadly of their children; Luisa is like a statue and does nothing but sit and dream; Matt still hasn't returned.  They then sing about the uncertainties of raising children, as compared with the reliability of vegetable gardening (\"Plant a Radish\"). Luisa sees El Gallo watching her and is intrigued by the handsome, experienced bandit. Impulsively, she asks him to take her away to see the world. In a long fantasy sequence, they preview a series of romantic adventures through a mask of unreality, while in the background Matt is being abused and beaten by Henry and Mortimer portraying a series of unpleasant exotic employers. Luisa's fantasies become increasingly frenzied, exhausting and darkly underscored (\"Round and Round\").\n\nEl Gallo tells Luisa to pack her things for the journey, but before she goes inside to do so, he asks her to give him her treasured necklace, a relic of her dead mother, as a pledge that she will return. As she goes inside, El Gallo promises her a world of beauty and grandeur; at the same time, Matt approaches, giving a contrasting version of the cruel experiences that one can suffer (\"I Can See It\" (reprise)). As Luisa disappears, El Gallo turns to leave, the injured Matt makes a pitiful attempt to stop him from hurting Luisa, but El Gallo knocks him away and disappears. Luisa returns to find that El Gallo has left with her necklace, and she sits in tears. El Gallo, as the narrator, explains poetically that he had to hurt Matt and Luisa, and also himself in the process. Matt comforts Luisa, and he tells her a little about his experiences, and the two realize that everything they wanted was each other (\"They Were You\"; \"Metaphor\" (reprise)), but that they now understand that more deeply. The Fathers return joyfully and are about to tear down the wall, when El Gallo reminds them that the wall must always remain (\"Try to Remember\" (reprise)).\n\n==Characters==\n*El Gallo (the Narrator/Bandit)\n*Matt (the Boy)\n*Luisa (the Girl)\n*Hucklebee (the Boy's father)\n*Bellomy (the Girl's father)\n*Henry (the Old Actor)\n*Mortimer (the man who dies \u2013 an actor, pretending to be an [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]])\n*The Mute (who at times acts the part of the Wall)\n\n==Musical numbers==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act I\n*Overture\n*\"[[Try to Remember]]\" \u2013 El Gallo, Luisa, Matt, Hucklebee, Bellomy\n*\"Much More\" \u2013 Luisa\n*\"Metaphor\" \u2013 Matt, Luisa\n*\"Never Say No\" \u2013 Hucklebee, Bellomy\n*\"It Depends On What You Pay\" \u2013 El Gallo, Hucklebee, Bellomy\n*\"[[Soon It's Gonna Rain]]\" \u2013 Matt, Luisa\n*\"Rape Ballet\" (or, with an option offered later, \"Abduction Ballet\") \u2013 Company\n*\"Happy Ending\" \u2013 Company\n{{col-break}}\n\n;Act II\n*\"This Plum Is Too Ripe\" \u2013 Matt, Luisa, Hucklebee, Bellomy\n*\"I Can See It\" \u2013 Matt, El Gallo\n*\"Plant a Radish\" \u2013 Bellomy, Hucklebee\n*\"Round and Round\" \u2013 El Gallo, Luisa, Company\n*\"They Were You\" \u2013 Matt, Luisa\n*\"Try to Remember\" (reprise) \u2013 El Gallo\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Controversy==\nAfter the initial success of the musical, ''The Fantasticks'' came under criticism for the repeated use of the word \"rape\" in the scene preceding the song \"It Depends on What You Pay\", and in the lyrics of the song. In the original production, when El Gallo offers to stage the phony kidnapping of Luisa, he refers to the proposed event as a \"rape\", although he makes it clear that he uses the word only in its traditional literary sense of \"abduction\", explaining that many classical works, including [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', use the word in this sense. (See ''[[raptio]]'' and [[bride kidnapping]].) In his song \"It Depends on What You Pay\" he describes different kidnapping scenarios, some comic or outlandish, that he classifies as the \"Venetian rape\", the \"[[Gothic fiction|Gothic rape]]\", the \"Drunken rape\", etc.  However, as the public issues of rape and [[sexual assault]] became a controversial subject during the play's long run, some audience members became offended by the repeated use of the word.<ref name=Schmidt120>Schmidt, p. 120</ref><ref>Proulx, Lisa.

In 1990, Jones and Schmidt wrote an optional replacement piece called \"Abductions\", which uses the music of the \"Rape Ballet\", although this song did not replace \"It Depends on What You Pay\" at the Sullivan Street Playhouse, where, with the edits made in the book, audiences accepted the song.<ref name=Schmidt120/> An edited version of \"It Depends on What You Pay\" is used in the long-running Jerry Orbach Theater version of the show.<ref>Theatre program, ''The Fantasticks'', Terzetto LLC producer, Jerry Orbach Theater, New York City, September 5, 2015</ref> MTI (Music Theater International), which licenses the show, offers \"Abductions\" as an alternate choice.<ref>Fowler, Nancy.

It combines the conquering [[lion of Judah]], symbol of the Ethiopian monarchy, with green, gold, and red.]]\n'''Rastafari''', also known as '''Rastafarianism''', is an [[Abrahamic religion]] that developed in [[Jamaica]] during the 1930s. It is classified as both a [[new religious movement]] and a [[social movement]] by [[Religious studies|scholars of religion]]. There is no central authority in control of the movement and much diversity exists among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas.\n\nRasta beliefs are based on a specific interpretation of the [[Bible]]. Central is a [[monotheistic]] belief in a single God, referred to as [[Jah]], who partially resides within each individual. Rastafari also maintains that Jah incarnated in human form as [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus Christ]]. Rastas accord [[Haile Selassie]], the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] between 1930 and 1974, central importance; many regard him as the [[Second Coming of Christ]] and thus Jah incarnate, while others see him as a human prophet who fully recognized the inner divinity in every individual. Rastafari is [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and focuses attention on the [[African diaspora]], which it believes is oppressed within Western society, or \"Babylon\". Many Rastas call for this diaspora's resettlement in Africa, a continent they consider the [[Promised Land]] of \"Zion\". Some practitioners extend these views into [[Black supremacy|black supremacism]]. Rastas refer to their practices as \"[[Livity (spiritual concept)|livity]]\". Communal meetings are known as \"groundations\", and are typified by music, chanting, discussions, and the [[Entheogenic use of cannabis|smoking of cannabis]], the latter regarded as a [[sacrament]] with beneficial properties. Rastas emphasise what they regard as living \"naturally\", adhering to [[ital]] dietary requirements, twisting their hair into [[dreadlocks]], and following [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] gender roles.\n\nRastafari originated among impoverished and socially disenfranchised [[Afro-Jamaican]] communities in 1930s Jamaica. Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica's then-dominant [[Colony of Jamaica|British colonial culture]]. It was influenced by both [[Ethiopian movement|Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back-to-Africa movement]] promoted by [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] figures such as [[Marcus Garvey]]. The movement developed after several [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christianity|Christian]] clergymen, most notably [[Leonard Howell]], proclaimed that Haile Selassie's crowning as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the 1950s, Rastafari's [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clashes with law enforcement. In the 1960s and 1970s it gained increased respectability within Jamaica and greater visibility abroad through the popularity of Rasta-inspired [[reggae]] musicians, most notably [[Bob Marley]]. Enthusiasm for Rastafari declined in the 1980s, following the deaths of Haile Selassie and Marley, but the movement survived and has a presence in many parts of the world.\n\nThe Rasta movement is decentralised and organised on a largely cellular basis. There are several denominations, or \"[[Mansions of Rastafari]]\", the most prominent of which are the [[Nyahbinghi]], [[Bobo Ashanti]], and the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]], each offering a different interpretation of Rasta belief. There are an estimated 700,000 to 1&nbsp;million Rastas across the world. The largest population is in Jamaica, although communities can be found in most of the world's major population centres. Rastas come from various ethnic groups although the majority are of black African descent and some Mansions only accept black members.\n\n==Definition==\n\nRastafari has been described as a religion,{{sfnm|1a1=Gjerset|1y=1994|1p=75, 76|2a1=Loadenthal|2y=2013|2p=3}} meeting many of the proposed definitions for what constitutes a religion,{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=216}} and is legally recognised as such in various countries.{{sfn|Mhango|2008|pp=223, 225\u2013226}} [[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] have categorised Rastafari as a [[new religious movement]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=11|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=92|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=182}} Others have proposed additional classifications: Leonard E. Barrett referred to it as a [[sect]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} while [[Sheila Kitzinger]] and Ernest Cashmore called it a [[cult]],{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=240|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=6}} and Ennis B. Edmonds argued that it could best be understood as a [[revitalization movement]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}} Edmonds also suggested that Rastafari was \"emerging\" as a [[world religion]], not because of the number of adherents that it had, but because of its global spread.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=71\u201372}} Although Rastafari focuses on Africa as a source of identity, Maboula Soumahoro noted that it was not an \"authentic\" African religion but an example of [[creolization]], a product of the unique social environment that existed in the Americas.{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=43}} Katrin Hansing described it as \"one of the leading Afro-Caribbean religions\".{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=733|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=62}} Many Rastas nevertheless dislike the notion that Rastafari should be called a religion, instead referring to it as a \"way of life\",{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=188|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=267|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=92|4a1=Glazier|4y=2012|4p=614|5a1=Chawane|5y=2014|5p=214}} a \"[[philosophy]]\",{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=6}} or as a \"[[spirituality]]\".{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=214}}\n\n[[File:Street vendors in Zeerust.jpg|thumb|left|Two Rasta street vendors in [[Zeerust]], [[South Africa]]; they are wearing and selling items that display their commitment to the religion]]\n\nOther scholars have categorized it in different ways. Emphasising its political stance, particularly in support of [[African nationalism]] and [[Pan-Africanism]], some have seen Rastafari as a political movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Kebede|1a2=Knottnerus|1y=1998|1p=502|2a1=Loadenthal|2y=2013|2p=4|3a1=Chawane|3y=2014|3p=218|4a1=Williams|4y=2017|4p=477}} a \"politico-religious\" movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=240|2a1=Watson|2y=1973|2p=189|3a1=Ifekwe|3y=2008|3p=106}} or a protest movement.{{sfn|Watson|1974|p=329}} It has alternatively been labelled a [[social movement]],{{sfnm|1a1=Watson|1y=1973|1p=189|2a1=Campbell|2y=1988|2p=78|3a1=Kebede|3a2=Knottnerus|3y=1998|3p=501|4a1=King|4y=2002|4p=136}} or more specifically as a [[new social movement]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}} Many Rastas nevertheless dislike the idea of Rastafari as a \"movement\".{{sfn|Lake|1994|p=253}} In 1989, a British Industrial Tribunal concluded that\u2014for the purposes of the [[Race Relations Act 1976]]\u2014Rastafarians could be considered an ethnic group because they have a long, shared heritage which distinguished themselves from other groups, their own cultural traditions, a common language, and a common religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Banton|1y=1989|1p=153|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1989|2pp=158\u2013160}}\n\nRastafari is a decentralised and heterogeneous movement;{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} it is neither monolithic nor homogenous.{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=240|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=77|3a1=Hansing|3y=2006|3pp=62\u201363}} The movement has continuously changed and developed over the course of its history,{{sfn|King|2002|p=13}} with significant doctrinal variation existing among practitioners depending on the group to which they belong.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=75}} It is not a unified movement,{{sfn|Simpson|1985|p=291}} and there has never been a single leader followed by all Rastas.{{sfn|Barnett|2006|p=881}} It is thus difficult to make broad generalisations about the movement without obscuring the complexities within it.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=49|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=961}} Darren J.

the African diaspora in Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} Some Rastas living elsewhere in Africa see no need to migrate to Ethiopia specifically because they believe that all of Africa falls under the

paradise.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=11, 70}} In the 1980s, Rastas believed that the Day of Judgment would happen around the year 2000.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=11, 69}} A common view in the Rasta community was that the world's white people would wipe themselves out through [[nuclear war]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}} with black Africans then ruling the world, something that they argue is prophesied in the [[Book of Daniel]] (2:31\u201332).{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}}\n\nRastas do not believe that there is a specific [[afterlife]] to which human individuals go following bodily death.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=74}} They believe in the possibility of eternal life,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=108}} and that only those who shun righteousness will actually die.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=75|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=112}} One Rasta view is that those who are righteous are believed to undergo [[reincarnation]],{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=74}} with an individual's

Jah.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=112}} He suggested that this attitude stemmed from the large numbers of young people that were then members of the movement, and who had thus seen only few Rastas die.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=113}} In keeping with their views on death, Rastas eschew celebrating physical death and often avoid funerals,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=247|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=75|3a1=Barnett|3y=2005|3p=72}} also repudiating the practice of [[ancestor veneration]] that is common among [[African traditional

Rastas believe that to determine whether they should undertake a certain act or not, they should consult the presence of Jah within themselves.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=54}}\n\nRastafari promotes the idea of \"living naturally\",{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=79|2a1=Barnett|2y=2002|2p=57|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=47}} in accordance with what Rastas regard as nature's laws.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=83}} It endorses the idea that Africa is the \"natural\" abode of black Africans, a continent where they can live according to African culture and tradition and be themselves on a physical, emotional, and intellectual level.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=82}} Practitioners believe that Westerners and Babylon have detached themselves from nature through technological development and thus have become debilitated, slothful, and decadent.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=83|2a1=Barnett|2y=2002|2p=57}} Some Rastas express the view that they should adhere to what they regard as African laws rather than the laws of Babylon, thus defending their involvement in certain acts which may be illegal in the countries that they are living in.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=177}} In emphasising his Afrocentric approach, Rastafari expresses overtones of [[black nationalism]].{{sfn|Watson|1973|p=192}}\n\nMaureen Warner-Lewis observed that Rastafari combined a \"radical, even revolutionary\" stance on socio-political issues, particularly regarding race, with a \"profoundly traditional\" approach to \"philosophical conservatism\" on other religious issues.{{sfn|Warner-Lewis|1993|p=122}} Rastas typically look critically upon modern capitalism with its consumerism and materialism.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=54}} They favour small-scale, pre-industrial and agricultural societies.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=57}} Some Rastas have promoted activism as a means of achieving socio-political change, while others believe in awaiting change that will be brought about through divine intervention in human affairs.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In Jamaica, Rastas typically do not vote,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=247|2a1=Chevannes|2y=1994|2p=150|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=220}} derogatorily dismissing politics as \"politricks\".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=220}} The Rasta tendency to believe that socio-political change is inevitable opens the religion up to the criticism from the [[Left-wing politics|political left]] that it encouraged adherents to do little or nothing to change the status quo.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1pp=175\u2013176, 179|2a1=Barnett|2y=2006|2p=891}} Other Rastas do engage in political activism; the Ghanaian Rasta singer-songwriter [[Rocky Dawuni]] for instance was involved in campaigns promoting democratic elections,{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=165\u2013167}} while in [[Grenada]], many Rastas joined the [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada)|People's Revolutionary Government]] which was formed in 1979.{{sfn|Newland|2013|p=205}}\n\n====Gender roles and

men.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=85}} Rastafari women usually accept this subordinate position and regard it as their duty to obey their men;{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=178}} the academic Maureen Rowe suggested that women were willing to join the religion despite its restrictions because they valued the life of structure and discipline it provided.{{sfn|Rowe|1980|p=16}} Rasta discourse often presents women as morally weak and susceptible to deception by [[evil]],{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=97}} and claims that they are impure while [[menstruation|menstruating]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rowe|1y=1980|1p=15|2a1=Lake|2y=1994|2p=244|3a1=Sabelli|3y=2011|3p=141|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=98}} Rastas legitimise these gender roles by citing Biblical

in favour of long skirts;{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=98}} women are expected to cover their head while praying,{{sfn|Rowe|1980|p=15}} and in some Rasta groups this is expected of them whenever in public.{{sfn|Barnett|2006|p=889}} Rasta discourse insists this female dress code is necessary to prevent women attracting men and presents it as an antidote to the [[sexual objectification]] of women in Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=98, 99}} Rasta men are permitted to wear whatever they choose.{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2002|1p=55|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=98}} Although men and women took part in early Rasta rituals alongside each other, from the late 1940s and 1950s a more radical movement within the Rasta community encouraged gender segregation for ceremonies.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}} This was legitimised with the explanation that women were impure through menstruation and that their presence at the ceremonies would distract male participants.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}}\n\nAs it existed in Jamaica, Rastafari did not promote monogamy.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=38}} Rasta men are permitted multiple female sex partners,{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=252|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=99}} while women are expected to reserve their sexual activity for their one male partner.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=99}} Marriage is not usually formalised through legal ceremonies but is a [[common law marriage|common law]] affair,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1966|1p=38|2a1=Kitzinger|2y=1969|2p=253|3a1=Clarke|3y=1986|3p=88|4a1=Semaj|4y=2013|4p=106}} although there are many Rastas who are legally married.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=78\u201379}} Rasta men refer to their female partners as

relationships are known as \"kingmen\".{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=245|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=99}} Rastafari places great importance on family life and the raising of children,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=87\u201388}} with reproduction being encouraged.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=37}} The religion emphasises the place of men in child-rearing, associating this with the recovery of African manhood.{{sfnm|1a1=Kebede|1a2=Knottnerus|1y=1998|1p=504|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=103\u2013104}} Women often work, sometimes while the man is left to raise the children at

have called for greater gender equity in the movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=87|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=107}} The scholar Terisa E. Turner for instance encountered Kenyan feminists who were appropriating Rastafari content to suit their political agenda.{{sfn|Turner|1991|p=86}} Some Rasta women have challenged gender norms by wearing their hair uncovered in public and donning trousers.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=109}}\n\nRastafari regards procreation as the purpose of sex, and thus [[oral sex|oral]] and [[anal sex]] are usually considered forbidden.{{sfn|Sabelli|2011|p=141}} Both [[contraception]] and [[abortion]] are usually censured by Rastas,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=253|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=79|3a1=Clarke|3y=1986|3p=88|4a1=Barrett|4y=1997|4p=209|5a1=Edmonds|5y=2012|5p=99}} and a common claim in Rasta discourse is that these were inventions of Babylon created in an attempt to decrease the black African birth-rate.{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1966|1p=37|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=88|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=100|4a1=Sibanda|4y=2016|4p=192}} Rastas typically express hostile attitudes to homosexuality, regarding homosexuals as evil and unnatural;{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1966|1p=35|2a1=Kitzinger|2y=1969|2pp=254\u2013255|3a1=Cashmore|3y=1983|3p=79|4a1=Barnett|4y=2006|4p=879|5a1=Sibanda|5y=2016|5pp=180, 181, 191}} this attitude derives from [[The Bible and homosexuality|references to same-sex sexual activity in the Bible]].{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=184}} Homosexual Rastas probably conceal their sexual orientation because of these attitudes.{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=192}} Rastas typically see the growing acceptance of birth control and homosexuality in Western society as evidence of the degeneration of Babylon as it approaches its apocalyptic end.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\n==Practices==\n{{Main|Livity (spiritual concept)}}\n\nRastas refer to their cultural and religious practices as \"livity\".{{sfnm|1a1=Gjerset|1y=1994|1p=71|2a1=Kebede|2a2=Knottnerus|2y=1998|2p=503|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=32}} Rastafari does not place emphasis on hierarchical structures,{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=54}} and has no professional priesthood,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=32}} with Rastas believing that there is no need for a priest to act as mediator between the worshipper and divinity.{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2002|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=53}} It nevertheless has \"Elders\", an honorific title bestowed upon those with a good reputation among the community.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}} Although respected figures, they do not necessarily have any administrative functions or responsibilities.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}} When they do oversee ritual meetings, they are often responsible for helping to interpret current events in terms of Biblical scripture.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1969|p=262}} Elders are often in communication with each other through a network.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}}\n\n===Grounding===\n\n[[File:Rastafarians celebrate Marcus Garvey.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A group of Rastas in [[Liberia]] celebrating Marcus Garvey's birthday]]\nThe term \"grounding\" is used among Rastas to refer to the establishment of relationships between like-minded practitioners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} Groundings often take place in a commune or yard, and are presided over by an elder.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=88}} The elder is charged with keeping discipline in the group, and can ban certain individuals from attending.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}} The number of participants can range from a handful to several hundred.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=88}} Activities that take place at groundings include the playing of drums, chanting, the singing of hymns, and the recitation of poetry.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=88|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=54}} Ganja, or cannabis, is often smoked.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=88|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=54}} Most groundings contain only men, with women being excluded.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=100}} Some Rasta women have established their own, all-female grounding circles.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=100}}\n\nOne of the central activities at groundings is \"[[reasoning (Rastafari)|reasoning]]\".{{sfnm|1a1=Kebede|1a2=Knottnerus|1y=1998|1p=505|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=56|3a1=Chawane|3y=2014|3p=234}} This is a discussion among assembled Rastas about the religion's principles and their relevance to current events.{{sfnm|1a1=Kebede|1a2=Knottnerus|1y=1998|1pp=505\u2013506|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=56|3a1=Chawane|3y=2014|3p=234}} These discussions are supposed to be non-combative, although attendees can point out the fallacies in any arguments presented.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=56\u201357}} Those assembled inform each other about the revelations that they have received through meditation and dream.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=88}} Each contributor is supposed to push the boundaries of understanding until the entire group has gained greater insight into the topic under discussion.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=57}} In meeting together with likeminded individuals, reasoning helps Rastas to reassure one another of the correctness of their beliefs.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=127}} Rastafari meetings are opened and closed with prayers.

it may have been through Kumina that cannabis became part of Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} A second possible source was the use of cannabis in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] rituals.{{sfnm|1a1=Benard|1y=2007|1p=95, 96|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=55}} Hindu migrants arrived in Jamaica as indentured servants from [[British India]] between 1834 and 1917, and brought cannabis with them.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} A Jamaican Hindu priest, Laloo, was one of Howell's spiritual advisors, and may have influenced his adoption of ganja.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}}\n\nThe adoption of cannabis may also have been influenced by the widespread medicinal and recreational use of cannabis among Afro-Jamaicans in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} Early Rastafarians may have taken an element of Jamaican culture which they associated with their peasant past and the rejection of capitalism and sanctified it by according it Biblical correlates.{{sfn|Benard|2007|pp=91\u201392}} In many countries, cannabis is illegal and by using it, Rastas protest the rules and regulations of Babylon;{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=129}} in the United States, for example, thousands of practitioners have been arrested because of their possession of the drug.{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=5}}  Rastas have also advocated for the legalisation of cannabis in those jurisdictions where it is illegal.{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=76|2a1=Barnett|2y=2006|2p=892|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=184}} In November 2019, the government of [[Barbados]] passed legislation allowing for Rastafarians to use cannabis for religious reasons, provided that groups first follow certain provisions.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=24 November 2019 |title=Government passes ganja legislation for Rastafarians, conditions apply |url=http://www.loopnewsbarbados.com/content/rastas-get-ganja-permission-conditions# |work=Loop |access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[File:RastaBongo.jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta using a bongo drum]]\nRastafari music developed at reasoning sessions,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=93}} where drumming, chanting, and dancing are all present.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} Rasta music is performed to praise and commune with Jah,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} and to reaffirm the rejection of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Rastas believe that their music has healing properties, with the ability to cure colds, fevers, and headaches.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Many of these songs are sung to the tune of older Christian hymns,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=94|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=123|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=58}} but others are original Rasta creations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}}\n\nThe bass-line of Rasta music is provided by the [[akete]], a three-drum set, which is accompanied by [[percussion instruments]] like [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s and [[tambourine]]s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} A syncopated rhythm is then provided by the [[fundeh]] drum.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} In addition, a [[peta (drum)|peta]] drum improvises over the rhythm.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} The different components of the music are regarded as displaying different symbolism; the bassline symbolises blows against Babylon, while the lighter beats denote hope for the future.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}}\n\nAs Rastafari developed, popular music became its chief communicative medium.{{sfn|King|2002|p=5}} During the 1950s, [[ska]] was a popular musical style in Jamaica, and although its protests against social and political conditions were mild, it gave early expression to Rasta socio-political ideology.{{sfn|King|2002|p=4}} Particularly prominent in the connection between Rastafari and ska were the musicians [[Count Ossie]] and [[Don Drummond]].{{sfnm|1a1=King|1y=2002|1p=24|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=115}} Ossie was a drummer who believed that black people needed to develop their own style of music;{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=93|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=162}} he was heavily influenced by [[Kumina]] and [[Burru]], two drumming styles developed by African-Jamaicans.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=113}} Ossie subsequently popularised this new Rastafari ritual music by playing at various groundings and groundations around Jamaica,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=113}} with songs like \"Another Moses\" and \"Babylon Gone\" reflecting Rasta influence.{{sfn|King|2002|p=24}} Rasta themes also appeared in Drummond's work, with songs such as \"Reincarnation\" and \"Tribute to Marcus Garvey\".{{sfn|King|2002|p=24}}\n\n1968 saw the development of [[reggae]] in Jamaica, a musical style typified by slower, heavier rhythms than ska and the increased use of [[patois]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=46}} Although like [[calypso music|calypso]], reggae was a medium for [[social commentary]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=vii}} it demonstrated a wider use of radical political and Rasta themes than were previously present in Jamaican popular music.{{sfn|King|2002|p=46}} Reggae artists incorporated Rasta ritual rhythms,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=117}} and also adopted Rasta chants, language, motifs, and social critiques.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=117}} Songs like [[The Wailers]]' \"[[African Herbsman]]\" and [[Peter Tosh]]'s \"Legalize It\" referenced cannabis use,{{sfn|King|2002|p=57}} while tracks like [[The Melodians]]' \"[[Rivers of Babylon]]\" and [[Junior Byles]]' \"Beat Down Babylon\" referenced Rasta beliefs in Babylon.{{sfn|King|2002|p=56}} Reggae gained widespread international popularity during the mid-1970s,{{sfn|King|2002|p=96}} coming to be viewed as music of the oppressed by black people in many different countries.{{sfn|King|2002|p=100}} Many Rastas grew critical of reggae, believing that it had commercialised their religion.{{sfn|King|2002|p=102}} Although reggae contains much Rastafari symbolism,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} and the two are widely associated,{{sfn|King|2002|p=xiii}} the connection is often exaggerated by non-Rastas.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=245}} Most Rastas do not listen to reggae music,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=245}} and reggae has also been utilised by other religious groups, such as evangelical Protestants.{{sfn|Rommen|2006|pp=235\u2013236}} Out of reggae came [[dub music]]; dub artists often employ Rastafari terminology, even when not Rastas themselves.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=178}}\n\n===Language and symbolism===\n\n{{Main|Rastafari vocabulary}}\nIn the 1940s, a distinct form of Rasta language, often known as \"dreadtalk\", developed among Jamaican practitioners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=45}} Rastas typically regard words as having an intrinsic power,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=47}} with Rastafari language reflecting Rastas' own experiences,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=45}} as well as fostering a group identity and cultivating particular values.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=92}} Rastas seek to avoid language that contributes to servility, self-degradation, and the objectification of the person.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=92\u201393}} They believe that by formulating their own language they are launching an ideological attack on the integrity of the [[English language]], which they view as a tool of Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=46, 47}} The use of this language helps Rastas distinguish and separate themselves from non-Rastas,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=93|2a1=Kebede|2a2=Knottnerus|2y=1998|2p=509}} for whom\u2014according to Barrett\u2014Rasta rhetoric can be \"meaningless babbling\".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=103}}\n\n[[File:Flag of Ethiopia (1975\u20131987).svg|thumb|left|Rastas regularly use the three colours of the Ethiopian flag for their movement, although often add black to this tricolour, symbolising the black skin of the African people]]\nRastas make wide use of the pronoun \"I\".{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=1985|1p=288|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=92|3a1=Chevannes|3y=1994|3p=167|4a1=Kebede|4a2=Knottnerus|4y=1998|4p=509|5a1=Edmonds|5y=2012|5p=45}} The use of this word denotes the Rasta view that the self is divine.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=2, 38}} It also reminds each Rasta that they are a human being, not a slave, and that they have value, worth, and dignity as a human being.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=92|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=37}} For instance, Rastas use \"I\" in place of \"me\", \"I and I\" in place of \"we\", \"I-ceive\" in place of \"receive\", \"I-sire\" in place of \"desire\", \"I-rate\" in place of \"create\", and \"I-men\" in place of \"[[Amen]]\".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=92}} Rastas refer to this process as \"InI Consciousness\" or \"Isciousness\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=37}} Rastas typically refer to Haile Selaisse as \"Haile Selassie I\", thus indicating their belief in his divinity.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=92|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=37}} Rastas also typically believe that the [[phonetics]] of a word should be linked to its meaning.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=47}} For instance, Rastas often use the word \"downpression\" in place of \"oppression\" because oppression bears ''down'' on people rather than lifting them ''up'', with \"up\" being phonetically akin to the \"opp-\".{{sfnm|1a1=King|1y=2002|1p=xx|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=47}} Similarly, they often favour \"livicate\" over \"dedicate\" because \"ded-\" is phonetically akin to the word \"dead\".{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=1985|1p=288|2a1=Kebede|2a2=Knottnerus|2y=1998|2p=509|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=47}} In its early decades, Rastas often said \"Peace and Love\" as a greeting, although the use of this declined as the religion aged.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=269|2a1=Semaj|2y=2013|2p=108}}\n\nRastas often make use of the colours red, black, green, and gold.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} Red, gold, and green were used in the [[Flag of Ethiopia|Ethiopian flag]] while, prior to the development of Rastafari, the Jamaican [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] activist Marcus Garvey had used red, green, and black as the colours for his [[United Negro Improvement Association]].{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=159|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=143|3a1=White|3y=2010|3p=307}} According to Garvey, the red symbolised the blood of martyrs, the black symbolised the skin of Africans, and the green represented the vegetation of the land.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=160|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=143}} Many Rastas endorse these associations to the colours.{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} The colour gold is often included alongside Garvey's three colours; it has been adopted from the [[Flag of Jamaica|Jamaican flag]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=143}} and is often interpreted as symbolising the minerals and raw materials which constitute Africa's wealth.{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} Rastas often paint these colours onto their buildings, vehicles, kiosks, and other items,{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} or display them on their clothing, helping to demarcate Rastas from non-Rastas and allowing adherents to recognise their co-religionists.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=160}} As well as being used by Rastas, the colour set has also been adopted by Pan-Africanists more broadly, who use it to display their identification with Afrocentricity;{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} for this reason it was adopted on the flags of many post-independence African states.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} Rastas often accompany the use of these three or four colours with the image of the [[Lion of Judah]], also adopted from the Ethiopian flag and symbolizing Haile Selassie.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}}\n\n===Diet===\n{{Main|Ital}}\n\n[[File:Ital food - 01.jpg|thumb|right|An ital breakfast;

Here, they were sold to European planters and forced to work on the plantations.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} Around a third of these transported Africans were relocated in the Caribbean, with under 700,000 being settled in Jamaica.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} In 1834, slavery in Jamaica was abolished after the British government passed the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=24|2a1=Chevannes|2y=1994|2p=3}} Racial prejudice nevertheless remained prevalent across Jamaican society,{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=3}} with the overwhelming majority of Jamaica's legislative council remaining white throughout the nineteenth century,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=25}} and those of African descent being treated as [[second-class citizen]]s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=24}}\n\nChristian Revivalism was a key influence on Rastafari.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=120}} Many Afro-Jamaicans joined Christian churches during the Great Revival of 1860\u201361.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=25|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=21}} They brought with them many inherited African beliefs and rituals, which syncretised with Christianity in various ways and to varying degrees.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=25}} Some of the new religions that emerged, such as Pukkumina, remained heavily based on traditional African religion, while others, like Revival Zion, were more fully Christian.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=25|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=22}} The majority of these groups practiced spiritual healing and incorporated drumming and chanting, counselling, and spirit possession into their structures.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=26}} Increasing numbers of [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] missionaries from the United States arrived in Jamaica during the early twentieth century, reaching a climax in the 1920s.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=26|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=25}} They provided a way for black Jamaicans\u2014who continued to live with the social memory of enslavement and who were denied any substantial participation in Jamaica's political institutions\u2014to express their hopes, fears, and aspirations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=26}}\n\n===Ethiopianism, Back to Africa, and Marcus Garvey===\n\n[[File:Marcus Garvey 1924-08-05.jpg|thumb|upright|Marcus Garvey, a prominent black nationalist theorist who heavily influenced Rastafari and is regarded as a prophet by many Rastas]]\nAccording to Edmonds, Rastafari emerged from \"the convergence of several religious, cultural, and intellectual streams\",{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=7}} while fellow scholar Wigmoore Francis described it as owing much of its self-understanding to \"intellectual and conceptual frameworks\" dating from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.{{sfn|Francis|2013|p=52}} Both [[Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back to Africa]] ethos remain \"fundamental ingredients of Rastafarian ideology\".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=27}} These two movements predated Rastafari and can be traced back to the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27\u201328}}\n\nIn the nineteenth century, there were growing calls for the African diaspora located in Western Europe and the Americas to be resettled in Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27\u201328}} In that century, many members of the African diaspora were moved to Sierra Leone and Liberia.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27\u201328}} Based in Liberia, the black Christian preacher [[Edward Wilmot Blyden]] began promoting African pride and the preservation of African tradition, customs, and institutions.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1pp=29\u201334|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=75\u201376|3a1=Francis|3y=2013|3pp=54\u201356}} Blyden sought to promote a form of Christianity that was suited to the African context,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=32\u201333}} and believed that black people had to acquire their own historical knowledge about themselves.{{sfn|Francis|2013|p=66}} The idea of the African diaspora's return to Africa was given impetus by the creation of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948 as a nation-state for the [[Jewish diaspora]] to return to.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=18}}\n\nAlso spreading through Africa was Ethiopianism, a movement that accorded special status to the east African nation of Ethiopia because it was mentioned in various Biblical passages.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=34|2a1=Chawane|2y=2014|2p=221}} For adherents of Ethiopianism, \"Ethiopia\" was regarded as a synonym of Africa as a whole.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=34}} Across the continent, although particularly in South Africa, Christian churches were established that referred to themselves as \"Ethiopian\"; these groups were at the forefront of the burgeoning African nationalist movement that sought liberation from European colonial rule.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=34\u201335}}\n\nOf significant influence on Rastafari was the Jamaican-born activist Marcus Garvey, who spent much of his adult life in the United States and United Kingdom. Garvey supported the idea of global [[Black separatism|racial separatism]] and rejected the idea that black people of African descent living in the Americas should campaign for their civil rights; instead he believed that they should migrate ''en masse'' back to Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=41\u201342}} His ideas were opposed by many blacks in the Americas and he experienced hostility from African-American civil rights activists like [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=43}} He also faced opposition from the government of Liberia, which did not want millions of unskilled migrants arriving on its shores.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=44}} As a mass movement, Garveyism declined in the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=43}}\n\nA rumour later spread that in 1916, Garvey had called on his supporters to \"look to Africa\" for the crowning of a black king; this quote was never verified.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=22|2a1=Soumahoro|2y=2007|2pp=38\u201339}} Soumahoro noted that this statement was \"legendary\".{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=38}} Rather, Garvey was critical of Haile Selassie for leaving Ethiopia at the time of the Italian Fascist occupation, describing the king as \"a great coward\" who rules a \"country where black men are chained and flogged.\"{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=22}} Rastafari does not promote all of the views that Garvey espoused, but nevertheless shares many of the same perspectives.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=44}} Rastas hold Garvey in great esteem,{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=77}} with many regarding him as a prophet.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=35|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=7|3a1=Semaj|3y=2013|3p=99|4a1=Chawane|4y=2014|4p=221}} According to Soumahoro, Rastafari \"emerged from the socio-political ferment inaugurated by Marcus Garvey\",{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=39}} while for Cashmore, Garvey was the \"most important\" precursor of the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=3}}\n\n===Haile Selassie and the early Rastas: 1930\u20131949===\n\nHaile Selassie was crowned Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930. A number of Jamaica's Christian clergymen claimed that Selassie's coronation was evidence that he was the black messiah that they believed was prophesied in the Book of Revelation (5:2\u20135; 19:16), the [[Book of Daniel]] (7:3), and the [[Psalms|Book of Psalms]] (68:31).{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=46|2a1=Lewis|2y=1993|2pp=1\u20132|3a1=Loadenthal|3y=2013|3p=10}} Over the following years, a number of street preachers\u2014most notably [[Leonard Howell]], [[Archibald Dunkley]], [[Robert Hinds]], and [[Joseph Hibbert]]\u2014began promoting the idea that Haile Selassie was the returned Jesus.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1993|1p=2|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=81|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=9}} These preachers began promoting this idea within Kingston, and soon the message spread throughout 1930s Jamaica.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=46|2a1=Lewis|2y=1993|2p=2}} Clarke stated that \"to all intents and purposes this was the beginning\" of the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=46}}\n\n[[File:Addis Ababa-8e00855u.jpg|thumb|right|Emperor Haile Selassie, considered by many Rastas to be the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.]]\n\nHowell has been described as the \"leading figure\" in the early Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=82}} Howell preached that black Africans were superior to white Europeans and that Afro-Jamaicans should owe their allegiance to Haile Selassie rather than to [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], King of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]]. The island's British authorities arrested him and charged him with sedition, resulting in a two-year imprisonment.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=46|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=85\u201386|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=11, 13}} Following his release, Howell established the [[Ethiopian Salvation Society]] and in 1939 created a Rasta community known as Pinnacle, in St Catherine. The community attracted between 500 and 2000 people, who were largely self-sufficient.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=25|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=46|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=86|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4pp=13\u201314}} Police feared that Howell was training his followers for an armed rebellion and were angered that it was producing marijuana for sale among the wider community. They raided the community on several occasions and Howell was imprisoned for a further two years.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=26|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=87|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=14\u201315}} On his release he returned to Pinnacle, but the police continued with their raids and shut down the community in 1954; Howell himself was committed to a mental hospital.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=87|2a1=Edmonds |2y= 2012|2p= 15}}\n\nIn 1936, Italy [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invaded and occupied Ethiopia]], with Haile Selassie going into exile. The event brought international condemnation and growing sympathy for the Ethiopian cause.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} In 1937, Selassie then created the [[Ethiopian World Federation]], which established a branch in Jamaica later that decade.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=27|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=47|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=89|4a1=Bonacci|4y=2013|4pp=74, 78}} In 1941, the Italians were driven out of Ethiopia and Selassie returned.  For many Rastas, this event was interpreted as the fulfilment of an event described in the Book of Revelation (19:11\u201319).{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}}\n\n===Growing visibility: 1950\u20131969===\n\nRastafari's main appeal was among the lower classes of Jamaican society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} For its first thirty years, Rastafari was in a conflictual relationship with the Jamaican authorities.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=10}} Jamaica's Rastas expressed contempt for many aspects of the island's society, viewing the government, police, bureaucracy, professional classes, and established churches as instruments of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} Relations between practitioners and the police were strained, with Rastas often being arrested for cannabis possession.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=49|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=93}} During the 1950s the movement grew rapidly in Jamaica itself and also spread to other Caribbean islands, the United States, and the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}}\n\n[[Image:Bob-Marley-in-Concert Zurich 05-30-80.jpg|thumb|left|Reggae musician [[Bob Marley]] did much to raise international awareness of the Rastafari movement]]\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, a more militant brand of Rastafari emerged.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=15}} The vanguard of this was the [[House of Youth Black Faith]], a group whose members were largely based in [[West Kingston, Jamaica|West Kingston]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=16}}\nBacklash against the Rastas grew after a practitioner of the religion allegedly killed a woman in 1957.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In March 1958, the first Rastafarian Universal Convention was held in [[Back-o-Wall]], Kingston.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=50|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=92}} Following the event, militant Rastas unsuccessfully tried to capture the city in the name of Haile Selassie.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=28|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=93}} Later that year they tried again in [[Spanish Town]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} The increasing militancy of some Rastas resulted in growing alarm about the religion in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} According to Cashmore, the Rastas became \"folk devils\" in Jamaican society.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=28}} In 1959, the self-declared prophet and founder of the [[African Reform Church]], [[Claudius Henry]], sold thousands of black Jamaicans, including many Rastas, tickets for a ship that he claimed would take them to Africa. The ship never arrived and Henry was charged with fraud. In 1960 he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the government.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=28\u201329|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3pp=95\u201398|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=19}} Henry's son was accused of being part of a paramilitary

prominent clashes between Rastas and law enforcement was the [[Coral Gardens incident]] of 1963.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=22}} Clamping down on the Rasta movement, in 1964 the island's government implemented tougher laws surrounding marijuana use.{{sfn|King|2002|p=79}}\n\nAt the invite of Jamaica's government, Haile Selassie visited the island for the first time in August 1966, with crowds of Rastas assembling to meet him at the airport.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=158\u2013160|3a1=King|3y=2002|3pp=82\u201383|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=24}} The event was the high point for many of the religion's members.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} Over the course of the 1960s, Jamaica's Rasta community underwent a process of [[Charismatic authority#Routinizing charisma|routinization]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=146}} with the late 1960s witnessing the launch of the first official Rastafarian newspaper, the [[Rastafarian Movement Association]]'s ''Rasta Voice''.{{sfn|King|2002|p=52}} The decade also saw Rastafari develop in increasingly complex ways.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} During that decade, some Rastas began to reinterpret the idea that salvation required a physical return to Africa, instead interpreting salvation as coming through a process of mental decolonisation that embraced African approaches to life.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}}\n\nWhereas its membership had previously come predominantly from poorer sectors of Jamaican society, in the 1960s Rastafari began to attract support from more privileged groups like students and professional musicians.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=25}} The foremost group emphasising this approach were the Twelve Tribes of Israel, whose members came to be known as \"Uptown Rastas\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=25}} Among those attracted to Rastafari in this decade were middle-class intellectuals like [[Leahcim Semaj]], who called for the religious community to place greater emphasis on scholarly social theory as a method of achieving change.{{sfn|King|2002|p=103}} Although some Jamaican Rastas were critical of him,{{sfn|King|2002|p=81}} many came under the influence of the Guyanese black nationalist academic [[Walter Rodney]], who lectured to their community in 1968 before publishing his thoughts as the pamphlet ''Groundings''.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2013|2pp=297-298|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=26}} Like Rodney, many Jamaican Rastas were influenced by the U.S.-based [[Black Power]] movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=25\u201326}} After Black Power declined following the deaths of prominent exponents such as [[Malcolm X]], [[Michael X]], and [[George

exploded.{{sfn|King|2002|p=96}} The most successful reggae artist was Bob Marley, who\u2014according to Cashmore\u2014\"more than any other individual, was responsible for introducing Rastafarian themes, concepts and demands to a truly universal audience\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=108}} Reggae's popularity led to a growth in \"pseudo-Rastafarians\", individuals who listened to reggae and wore Rasta clothing but did not share its belief system.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=100, 102}} Many Rastas were angered by this, believing it commercialised their religion.{{sfn|King|2002|p=102}}\n\nThrough reggae, Rasta musicians became increasingly important in Jamaica's political life during the 1970s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=53}} In his desire to move towards [[democratic socialism]], Jamaican Prime Minister [[Michael Manley]] employed some Rasta imagery, and also courted and obtained support from Marley and other reggae musicians, thus helping to bolster his popularity with the electorate.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Lewis|2y=1993|2p=12|3a1=Lewis|3y=1994|3pp=290\u2013291|4a1=King|4y=2002|4pp=105, 108\u2013111}} Manley described Rastas as a \"beautiful and remarkable people\",{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=ix}} and carried a cane, the \"rod of correction\", which he claimed was a gift from Haile

employed Rasta language, symbols, and reggae references in their campaigns,{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1994|1p=12|2a1=Lewis|2y=1994|2p=291|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=27}} while Rasta symbols became increasingly mainstream in Jamaican society.{{sfn|King|2002|p=106}} This helped to confer greater legitimacy on Rastafari,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=27}} with reggae and Rasta imagery being increasingly presented as a core part of Jamaica's [[cultural heritage]] for the marketing purposes of the growing tourist industry.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nEnthusiasm for Rastafari was likely dampened by the death of Haile Selassie in 1975 and that of Marley in 1981.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=28}} During the 1980s, the number of Rastas in Jamaica declined,{{sfn|King|2002|p=120}} with Pentecostal and other Charismatic Christian groups proving more successful at attracting young recruits.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} Several publicly prominent Rastas converted to Christianity,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} and two of those who did so\u2014[[Judy Mowatt]] and [[Tommy Cowan]]\u2014maintained that Marley had converted from Rastafari to Christianity, in the form of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]], during his final days.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=29\u201330}} The significance of Rastafari messages in reggae also declined with the growing popularity of [[dancehall]], a Jamaican musical genre that typically foregrounded lyrical themes of hyper-masculinity, violence, and sexual activity rather than religious symbolism.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} However, in the 1980s, a Rasta practitioner, [[Barbara Makeda Blake Hannah]], was appointed a Senator in the Jamaican Parliament.{{sfn|Semaj|2013|p=98}}\n\nThe mid-1990s saw a revival of Rastafari-focused reggae associated with musicians like [[Anthony B]], [[Buju Banton]], [[Luciano]], [[Sizzla]], and [[Capleton]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} From the 1990s, Jamaica also witnessed the growth of organised political activity within the Rasta community, seen for instance through campaigns for the legalisation of marijuana and the creation of political parties like the [[Jamaican Alliance Movement]] and the [[Imperial Ethiopian World Federation Incorporated Political Party]], none of which attained more than minimal electoral support.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=30\u201331}} In 1995, the Rastafari Centralization Organization was established in Jamaica as an attempt to organise the Rastafari community.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=56}}\n\n==Organization==\n\nRastafari is not a homogeneous movement and has no single administrative structure,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} nor any single leader.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=91|2a1=King|2y=2002|2p=xvii}} Rastas avoid centralised and hierarchical structures because they do not want to replicate the structures of Babylon and because their religion's ultra-individualistic ethos places emphasis on inner divinity.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=52\u201353}} The structure of Rastafari groups is less like those of Christian denominations and is instead akin to the cellular structure of other African diasporic traditions like [[Haitian Vodou]], Cuban [[Santer\u00eda]], and Jamaica's [[Revival Zion]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} Since the 1970s, there have been attempts to unify all Rastas, namely through the establishment of the [[Rastafari Movement Association]], which sought political mobilisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} In 1982, the first international assembly of Rastafari groups took place in [[Toronto]], Canada.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} This and subsequent international

Rastafari===\n\n{{Main|Mansions of Rastafari}}\n\n[[File:ReggaeV4.0.png|thumb|right|A stylized Rastafari motif, depicting the [[Lion of Judah]]]]\n\nSub-divisions of Rastafari are often referred to as \"houses\" or \"mansions\", in keeping with a passage from the [[Gospel of John]] (14:2): as translated in the [[King James Bible]], Jesus states \"In my father's house are many mansions\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The three most prominent branches are the House of Nyabinghi, the Bobo Ashanti, and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, although other important groups include the Church of Haile Selassie I, Inc., and the Fulfilled Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}}\n\nProbably the largest Rastafari group, the [[Nyabinghi|House of Nyabinghi]] is an aggregate of more traditional and militant Rastas who seek to retain the movement close to the way in which it existed during the 1940s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} They stress the idea that Haile Selassie was Jah and the reincarnation of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The wearing of dreadlocks is regarded as indispensable and patriarchal gender roles are strongly emphasised,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} while, according to Cashmore, they are  \"vehemently anti-white\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=25}} Nyabinghi Rastas refuse to compromise with Babylon, and are often critical of reggae musicians like Marley, whom they regard as having collaborated with the commercial music industry.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=59, 62}}\n\nThe [[Bobo Ashanti]] sect was founded in Jamaica by [[Charles Edwards (Rastafarian)|Emanuel Charles Edwards]] through the establishment of his Ethiopia Africa Black International Congress (EABIC) in 1958.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=2012|1p=63|2a1=Merritt|2y=2017|2p=285}} The group established a commune in [[Bull Bay]], where they were led by Edwards until his 1994 death.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=2012|1p=64|2a1=Merritt|2y=2017|2pp=285\u2013286}} The group hold to a highly rigid ethos.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} Edwards advocated the idea of a new trinity, with Haile Selassie as the living God, himself as the Christ, and Garvey as the prophet.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=182|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=69|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}} Male members are divided into two categories: the \"priests\" who conduct religious services and the \"prophets\" who take place in reasoning sessions.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} It places greater restrictions on women than most other forms of Rastafari;{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=69}} women are regarded as impure because of menstruation and childbirth, and so are not permitted to cook for men.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group teaches that black Africans are God's chosen people and are superior to white Europeans,{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=69|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=64}} with members often refusing to associate with white people.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=157}} Bobo Ashanti Rastas are recognisable by their long, flowing robes and turbans.{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=247|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=69|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}}\n\n[[File:Twelve Tribes of Israel headquarters.jpg|thumb|left|The headquarters of the Twelve Tribes of Israel organisation in Shashamane, Ethiopia]]\n\nThe [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]] sect was founded in 1968 in Kingston by [[Vernon Carrington]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1993|1p=11|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=227|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2010|3pp=961, 962|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=64}} He proclaimed himself the reincarnation of the Old Testament prophet [[Gad (son of Jacob)|Gad]] and his followers call him \"Prophet Gad\", \"Brother Gad\", or \"Gadman\".{{sfnm|1a1=Rubenstein|1a2=Suarez|1y=1994|1p=2|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=962|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}} It is commonly regarded as the most liberal form of Rastafari and the closest to Christianity;{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}} some Rastas regard it as being heretical.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=323}} Practitioners are often dubbed \"Christian Rastas\" because they believe Jesus is the only saviour; Haile Selassie is accorded importance, but is not viewed as the second coming of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=67}} The group divides its members into twelve groups according to which [[Hebrew calendar]] month they were born; each month is associated with a particular colour, body part, and mental function.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=229|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=68|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=65}} Maintaining dreadlocks and an ital diet are considered commendable but not essential,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=66\u201367}} while adherents are called upon to read a chapter of the Bible each day.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=2012|1p=68|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=67|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2013|3p=302}} Membership is open to individuals of any racial background.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=68}}\n\nThe Twelve Tribes peaked in popularity during the 1970s, when it attracted artists, musicians, and many middle-class followers, resulting in the term \"middle-class Rastas\" and \"uptown Rastas\" being applied to members of the group.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} Marley was one such of these musicians belonging to the Twelve Tribes.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=54|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=230}} Carrington died in 2005, since which time the Twelve Tribes of Israel have been led by an executive council.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} As of 2010, it was recorded as being the largest of the centralized Rasta groups.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} It remains headquartered in Kingston, although has followers outside Jamaica;{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|pp=961\u2013962}} it was responsible for establishing the Rasta community in Shashame, Ethiopia.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1993|1p=11|2a1=Rubenstein|2a2=Suarez|2y=1994|2p=4}}\n\nThe Church of Haile Selassie, Inc was founded by Abuna Foxe, and operated much like a mainstream Christian church, with a hierarchy of functionaries, weekly services, and [[Sunday schools]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=68\u201369}} In adopting this broad approach, the Church seeks to develop Rastafari's respectability in wider society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} Fulfilled Rastafari is a multi-ethnic movement that has spread in popularity during the twenty-first century, in large part through the [[Internet]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The Fulfilled Rastafari group accept Haile Selassie's statements that he was a man and that he was a devout Christian, and so place emphasis on worshipping Jesus through the example set forth by Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The wearing of dreadlocks and the adherence to an ital diet are considered issues up to the individual.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}}\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Born in the ghettos of Kingston, Jamaica, the Rastafarian movement has captured the imagination of thousands of black youth, and some white youth, throughout Jamaica, the Caribbean, Britain, France, and other countries in Western Europe and North America. It is also to be found in smaller numbers in parts of Africa\u2014for example, in Ethiopia, Ghana, and Senegal\u2014and in Australia and New Zealand, particularly among the Maori.|source=\u2014 Sociologist of religion [[Peter B. Clarke]], 1986{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=17}} }}\n\nAs of 2012, there were an estimated 700,000 to 1&nbsp;million Rastas worldwide.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} They can be found in many different regions, including most of the world's major population centers.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} Rastafari's influence on wider society has been more substantial than its numerical size,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=14|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=71}} particularly in fostering a racial, political, and cultural consciousness among the African diaspora, Africans themselves, and other dominated communities across the world.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} Men dominate Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} In its early years, most of its followers were men, and the women who did adhere to it tended to remain in the background.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} This picture of Rastafari's demographics has been confirmed by ethnographic studies conducted in the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nThe Rasta message resonates with many people who feel marginalised and alienated by the values and institutions of their society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Internationally, it has proved most popular among the poor and among marginalised youth.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=63}} In valorising Africa and blackness, Rastafari provides a positive identity for youth in the African diaspora by allowing them to psychologically reject their social stigmatisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} It then provides these disaffected people with the discursive stance from which they can challenge capitalism and consumerism, providing them with symbols of resistance and defiance.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Cashmore expressed the view that \"whenever there are black people who sense an injust disparity between their own material conditions and those of the whites who surround them and tend to control major social institutions, the Rasta messages have relevance.\"{{sfn|Cashmore|1984|p=3}}\n\n===Conversion and deconversion===\n\nRastafari is a non-missionary religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} However, elders from Jamaica often go \"trodding\" to instruct new converts in the fundamentals of the religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} On researching English Rastas during the 1970s, Cashmore noted that they had not [[religious conversion|converted]] instantaneously, but rather had undergone \"a process of drift\" through which they gradually adopted Rasta beliefs and practices, resulting in their ultimate acceptance of Haile Selassie's central importance.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=55}} Rastas often claim that\u2014rather than converting to the religion\u2014they were actually always a Rasta and that their embrace of its beliefs was merely the realisation of this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=6}} There is no formal ritual carried out to mark an individual's entry into the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=128}} Rastas regard themselves as an exclusive and elite community, membership of which is restricted to those who have the \"insight\" to recognise Haile Selassie's importance.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=9}} Practitioners thus often regard themselves as the \"enlightened ones\" who have \"seen the light\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=57}} Many see no point in establishing good relations with non-Rastas, believing that the latter will never accept Rastafari doctrine as truth.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nSome Rastas have left the religion. Clarke noted that among British Rastas, some returned to Pentecostalism and other forms of Christianity, while others embraced [[Islam]] or no religion.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some English ex-Rastas described disillusionment when the societal transformation promised by Rastafari failed to appear, while others felt that while Rastafari would be appropriate for agrarian communities in Africa and the Caribbean, it was not suited to industrialised British society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some experienced disillusionment after developing the view that Haile Selassie had been an oppressive leader of the Ethiopian people.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Cashmore found that some British Rastas who had more militant views left the religion after finding its focus on reasoning and music insufficient for the struggle against white domination and racism.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=97}}\n\n===Regional spread===\n\nAlthough it remains most concentrated in the Caribbean,{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=2}} Rastafari has spread to many areas of the world and adapted into many localised variants.{{sfn|Hansing|2001|p=733}} It has spread primarily in Anglophone regions and countries, largely because reggae music has primarily been produced in the English language.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=63}} It is thus most commonly found in the Anglophone Caribbean, United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, and Anglophone parts of Africa.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=64}}\n\n====Jamaica and the Americas====\n[[File:Jamaican Man.jpg|thumb|upright|A Rastafari man in Jamaica.]]\n\nBarrett described Rastafari as \"the largest, most identifiable, indigenous movement in Jamaica.\"{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} In the mid-1980s, there were approximately 70,000 members and sympathisers of Rastafari in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} The majority of them were male, working-class, former Christians aged between 18 and 40.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} In the 2011 Jamaican census, 29,026 individuals identified as Rastas.<ref name=\"state2007\">{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90259.htm |title=Jamaica |publisher=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (US State Department)|date=September 14, 2007 |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref> Jamaica's Rastas were initially entirely from the Afro-Jamaican majority,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=2}} and although most remain Afro-Jamaican, Rastafari has also gained members from the island's [[Chinese Jamaicans|Chinese]], [[Indo-Jamaicans|Indian]], Afro-Chinese, Afro-Jewish, [[mulatto]], and [[White Jamaican|white]] minorities.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2\u20133}} Until 1965 the vast majority were from the lower classes, although it has since attracted many middle-class members; by the 1980s there were Jamaican Rastas working as lawyers and university professors.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2, 241}} Jamaica is often valorised by Rastas as the fountain-head of their faith, and many Rastas living elsewhere travel to the island on [[pilgrimage]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=87}}\n\nBoth through travel between the islands,{{sfn|Gjerset|1994|p=67}} and through reggae's popularity,{{sfnm|1a1=Gjerset|1y=1994|1p=67|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=81}} Rastafari spread across the eastern Caribbean during the 1970s. Here, its ideas complemented the anti-colonial and Afrocentric views prevalent in countries like Trinidad, Grenada, Dominica, and St Vincent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=81}} In these countries, the early Rastas often engaged in cultural and political movements to a greater extent than their Jamaican counterparts had.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=82}} Various Rastas were involved in Grenada's 1979 [[New Jewel Movement]] and were given positions in the Grenadine government until it was overthrown and replaced following the [[Invasion of Grenada|U.S. invasion of 1983]].{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1pp=50\u201351|2a1=Simpson|2y=1985|2p=291|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=82}} Although [[Fidel Castro]]'s Marxist\u2013Leninist government generally discouraged foreign influences, Rastafari was introduced to Cuba alongside reggae in the 1970s.{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=734|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=65|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=82\u201383}} Foreign Rastas studying in Cuba during the 1990s connected with its reggae scene and helped to further ground it in Rasta beliefs.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=82\u201383}} In Cuba, most Rastas have been male and from the [[Afro-Cuban]] population.{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=736|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=69}}\n\nRastafari was introduced to the United States and Canada with the migration of Jamaicans to continental North America in the 1960s and 1970s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} American police were often suspicious of Rastas and regarded Rastafari as a criminal sub-culture.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=76}} Rastafari also attracted converts from within several Native American communities,{{sfn|Hansing|2001|p=733}} and picked up some support from white members of the [[Hippy]] subculture, which was then in decline.{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=12}} In Latin America, small communities of Rastas have also established in Brazil, Panama, and Nicaragua.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=64}}\n\n====Africa====\n\nSome Rastas in the African diaspora have followed through with their beliefs about resettlement in Africa, with Ghana and Nigeria being particularly favoured.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=78}} Caribbean Rastas arrived in Ghana during the 1960s, encouraged by its first post-independence president, [[Kwame Nkrumah]], while some native Ghanaians also converted to the religion.{{sfn|White|2010|pp=304, 306\u2013307}} The largest congregation of Rastas has been in southern parts of Ghana, around [[Accra]], [[Tema]], and the [[Cape Coast]],{{sfn|White|2010|p=314}} although Rasta communities also exist in the Muslim-majority area of northern Ghana.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=152}} The Rasta migrants' wearing of dreadlocks was akin to that of the native [[fetish priest]]s, which may have assisted the presentation of these Rastas as having authentic African roots in Ghanaian society.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=154\u2013155}} However, Ghanaian Rastas have complained of social ostracism and prosecution for cannabis possession, while non-Rastas in often consider them to be \"drop-outs\", \"too Western\", and \"not African enough\".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=161\u2013162}} Another West African group to wear dreadlocks are the [[Baye Faal]], a [[Mouride]] sect in [[Senegambia]], some of whose practitioners have started calling themselves \"Rastas\" in reference to their visual similarity to Rastafari.{{sfn|Savishinsky|1994|p=211}} The popularity of dreadlocks and marijuana among the Baye Faal may have been spread in large part through access to Rasta-influenced reggae in the 1970s.{{sfn|Savishinsky|1994|p=214}} A small community of Rastas also established in Burkina Faso.{{sfn|Wittmann|2011|pp=158\u2013159}}\n\n[[File:East London, Eastern Cape, South Africa (20512396425).jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta street vendor in South Africa's [[Eastern Cape]]]]\n\nIn the 1960s, a Rasta settlement was established in [[Shashamane]], Ethiopia, on land made available by Haile Selassie's Ethiopian World Federation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} The community faced many problems; 500 acres were confiscated by the Marxist government of [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} There were also conflicts with local Ethiopians, who largely regarded the incoming Rastas, and their Ethiopia-born children, as foreigners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} The Shashamane community peaked at a population of 2,000, although subsequently declined to around 200.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}}\n\nBy the early 1990s, a Rasta community was present in [[Nairobi]], Kenya, whose approach to the religion was informed both by reggae and by traditional [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] religion.{{sfn|Turner|1991|p=82}} Rastafari groups have also appeared in Zimbabwe,{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=182}} and in South Africa;{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=220}} in 2008, there were at least 12,000 Rastas in the country.{{sfn|Mhango|2008|p=234}} At an [[African Union]]/[[Caribbean Diaspora]] conference in South Africa in 2005, a statement was released characterising Rastafari as a force for integration of Africa and the African

settled in the [[Notting Hill]] area of Northwest London.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} By the late 1960s, Rastafari had attracted converts from the second-generation of British Caribbean people, offering an outlet for the economic hardship, racial discrimination, and social isolation that many faced.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} It spread among the black working-classes not just of London, but also in [[Birmingham]], [[Leicester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], and [[Bristol]].{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=58}} Its spread was aided by the [[gang]] structures that had been cultivated among black British youth by the [[rudeboy]] subculture; these gangs proved to be a breeding ground for Rastafari themes.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=56}} British Rastafari gained increasing attention in the 1970s through reggae's popularity,{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1p=176|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=74}} although the police commonly regarded it as a criminal sub-culture.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=74\u201375}} Following

It combines the conquering [[lion of Judah]], symbol of the Ethiopian monarchy, with green, gold, and red.]]\n'''Rastafari''', also known as '''Rastafarianism''', is an [[Abrahamic religion]] that developed in [[Jamaica]] during the 1930s. It is classified as both a [[new religious movement]] and a [[social movement]] by [[Religious studies|scholars of religion]]. There is no central authority in control of the movement and much diversity exists among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas.\n\nRasta beliefs are based on a specific interpretation of the [[Bible]]. Central is a [[monotheistic]] belief in a single God, referred to as [[Jah]], who partially resides within each individual. Rastafari also maintains that Jah incarnated in human form as [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus Christ]]. Rastas accord [[Haile Selassie]], the [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] between 1930 and 1974, central importance; many regard him as the [[Second Coming of Christ]] and thus Jah incarnate, while others see him as a human prophet who fully recognized the inner divinity in every individual. Rastafari is [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and focuses attention on the [[African diaspora]], which it believes is oppressed within Western society, or \"Babylon\". Many Rastas call for this diaspora's resettlement in Africa, a continent they consider the [[Promised Land]] of \"Zion\". Some practitioners extend these views into [[Black supremacy|black supremacism]]. Rastas refer to their practices as \"[[Livity (spiritual concept)|livity]]\". Communal meetings are known as \"groundations\", and are typified by music, chanting, discussions, and the [[Entheogenic use of cannabis|smoking of cannabis]], the latter regarded as a [[sacrament]] with beneficial properties. Rastas emphasise what they regard as living \"naturally\", adhering to [[ital]] dietary requirements, twisting their hair into [[dreadlocks]], and following [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] gender roles.\n\nRastafari originated among impoverished and socially disenfranchised [[Afro-Jamaican]] communities in 1930s Jamaica. Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica's then-dominant [[Colony of Jamaica|British colonial culture]]. It was influenced by both [[Ethiopian movement|Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back-to-Africa movement]] promoted by [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] figures such as [[Marcus Garvey]]. The movement developed after several [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christianity|Christian]] clergymen, most notably [[Leonard Howell]], proclaimed that Haile Selassie's crowning as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the 1950s, Rastafari's [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clashes with law enforcement. In the 1960s and 1970s it gained increased respectability within Jamaica and greater visibility abroad through the popularity of Rasta-inspired [[reggae]] musicians, most notably [[Bob Marley]]. Enthusiasm for Rastafari declined in the 1980s, following the deaths of Haile Selassie and Marley, but the movement survived and has a presence in many parts of the world.\n\nThe Rasta movement is decentralised and organised on a largely cellular basis. There are several denominations, or \"[[Mansions of Rastafari]]\", the most prominent of which are the [[Nyahbinghi]], [[Bobo Ashanti]], and the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]], each offering a different interpretation of Rasta belief. There are an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas across the world. The largest population is in Jamaica, although communities can be found in most of the world's major population centres. Rastas come from various ethnic groups although the majority are of black African descent and some Mansions only accept black members.\n\n==Definition==\n\nRastafari has been described as a religion,{{sfnm|1a1=Gjerset|1y=1994|1p=75, 76|2a1=Loadenthal|2y=2013|2p=3}} meeting many of the proposed definitions for what constitutes a religion,{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=216}} and is legally recognised as such in various countries.{{sfn|Mhango|2008|pp=223, 225\u2013226}} [[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] have categorised Rastafari as a [[new religious movement]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=11|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=92|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=182}} Others have proposed additional classifications: Leonard E. Barrett referred to it as a [[sect]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} while [[Sheila Kitzinger]] and Ernest Cashmore called it a [[cult]],{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=240|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=6}} and Ennis B. Edmonds argued that it could best be understood as a [[revitalization movement]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}} Edmonds also suggested that Rastafari was \"emerging\" as a [[world religion]], not because of the number of adherents that it had, but because of its global spread.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=71\u201372}} Although Rastafari focuses on Africa as a source of identity, Maboula Soumahoro noted that it was not an \"authentic\" African religion but an example of [[creolization]], a product of the unique social environment that existed in the Americas.{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=43}} Katrin Hansing described it as \"one of the leading Afro-Caribbean religions\".{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=733|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=62}} Many Rastas nevertheless dislike the notion that Rastafari should be called a religion, instead referring to it as a \"way of life\",{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=188|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=267|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=92|4a1=Glazier|4y=2012|4p=614|5a1=Chawane|5y=2014|5p=214}} a \"[[philosophy]]\",{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=6}} or as a \"[[spirituality]]\".{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=214}}\n\n[[File:Street vendors in Zeerust.jpg|thumb|left|Two Rasta street vendors in [[Zeerust]], [[South Africa]]; they are wearing and selling items that display their commitment to the religion]]\n\nOther scholars have categorized it in different ways. Emphasising its political stance, particularly in support of [[African nationalism]] and [[Pan-Africanism]], some have seen Rastafari as a political movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Kebede|1a2=Knottnerus|1y=1998|1p=502|2a1=Loadenthal|2y=2013|2p=4|3a1=Chawane|3y=2014|3p=218|4a1=Williams|4y=2017|4p=477}} a \"politico-religious\" movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=240|2a1=Watson|2y=1973|2p=189|3a1=Ifekwe|3y=2008|3p=106}} or a protest movement.{{sfn|Watson|1974|p=329}} It has alternatively been labelled a [[social movement]],{{sfnm|1a1=Watson|1y=1973|1p=189|2a1=Campbell|2y=1988|2p=78|3a1=Kebede|3a2=Knottnerus|3y=1998|3p=501|4a1=King|4y=2002|4p=136}} or more specifically as a [[new social movement]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}} Many Rastas nevertheless dislike the idea of Rastafari as a \"movement\".{{sfn|Lake|1994|p=253}} In 1989, a British Industrial Tribunal concluded that\u2014for the purposes of the [[Race Relations Act 1976]]\u2014Rastafarians could be considered an ethnic group because they have a long, shared heritage which distinguished themselves from other groups, their own cultural traditions, a common language, and a common religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Banton|1y=1989|1p=153|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1989|2pp=158\u2013160}}\n\nRastafari is a decentralised and heterogeneous movement;{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} it is neither monolithic nor homogenous.{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=240|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=77|3a1=Hansing|3y=2006|3pp=62\u201363}} The movement has continuously changed and developed over the course of its history,{{sfn|King|2002|p=13}} with significant doctrinal variation existing among practitioners depending on the group to which they belong.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=75}} It is not a unified movement,{{sfn|Simpson|1985|p=291}} and there has never been a single leader followed by all Rastas.{{sfn|Barnett|2006|p=881}} It is thus difficult to make broad generalisations about the movement without obscuring the complexities within it.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=49|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=961}} Darren J. N. Middleton suggested that it was appropriate to speak of \"a plethora of ''Rasta spiritualities''\" displaying a \"shifting eclecticism\",{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=158}} while William F.

paradise.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=11, 70}} In the 1980s, Rastas believed that the Day of Judgment would happen around the year 2000.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=11, 69}} A common view in the Rasta community was that the world's white people would wipe themselves out through [[nuclear war]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}} with black Africans then ruling the world, something that they argue is prophesied in the [[Book of Daniel]] (2:31\u201332).{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}}\n\nRastas do not believe that there is a specific [[afterlife]] to which human individuals go following bodily death.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=74}} They believe in the possibility of eternal life,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=108}} and that only those who shun righteousness will actually die.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=75|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=112}} One Rasta view is that those who are righteous are believed to undergo [[reincarnation]],{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=74}} with an individual's

Jah.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=112}} He suggested that this attitude stemmed from the large numbers of young people that were then members of the movement, and who had thus seen only few Rastas die.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=113}} In keeping with their views on death, Rastas eschew celebrating physical death and often avoid funerals,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=247|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=75|3a1=Barnett|3y=2005|3p=72}} also repudiating the practice of [[ancestor veneration]] that is common among [[African traditional

Rastas believe that to determine whether they should undertake a certain act or not, they should consult the presence of Jah within themselves.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=54}}\n\nRastafari promotes the idea of \"living naturally\",{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=79|2a1=Barnett|2y=2002|2p=57|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=47}} in accordance with what Rastas regard as nature's laws.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=83}} It endorses the idea that Africa is the \"natural\" abode of black Africans, a continent where they can live according to African culture and tradition and be themselves on a physical, emotional, and intellectual level.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=82}} Practitioners believe that Westerners and Babylon have detached themselves from nature through technological development and thus have become debilitated, slothful, and decadent.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=83|2a1=Barnett|2y=2002|2p=57}} Some Rastas express the view that they should adhere to what they regard as African laws rather than the laws of Babylon, thus defending their involvement in certain acts which may be illegal in the countries that they are living in.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=177}} In emphasising his Afrocentric approach, Rastafari expresses overtones of [[black nationalism]].{{sfn|Watson|1973|p=192}}\n\nMaureen Warner-Lewis observed that Rastafari combined a \"radical, even revolutionary\" stance on socio-political issues, particularly regarding race, with a \"profoundly traditional\" approach to \"philosophical conservatism\" on other religious issues.{{sfn|Warner-Lewis|1993|p=122}} Rastas typically look critically upon modern capitalism with its consumerism and materialism.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=54}} They favour small-scale, pre-industrial and agricultural societies.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=57}} Some Rastas have promoted activism as a means of achieving socio-political change, while others believe in awaiting change that will be brought about through divine intervention in human affairs.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In Jamaica, Rastas typically do not vote,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=247|2a1=Chevannes|2y=1994|2p=150|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=220}} derogatorily dismissing politics as \"politricks\".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=220}} The Rasta tendency to believe that socio-political change is inevitable opens the religion up to the criticism from the [[Left-wing politics|political left]] that it encouraged adherents to do little or nothing to change the status quo.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1pp=175\u2013176, 179|2a1=Barnett|2y=2006|2p=891}} Other Rastas do engage in political activism; the Ghanaian Rasta singer-songwriter [[Rocky Dawuni]] for instance was involved in campaigns promoting democratic elections,{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=165\u2013167}} while in [[Grenada]], many Rastas joined the [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada)|People's Revolutionary Government]] which was formed in 1979.{{sfn|Newland|2013|p=205}}\n\n====Gender roles and

men.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=85}} Rastafari women usually accept this subordinate position and regard it as their duty to obey their men;{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=178}} the academic Maureen Rowe suggested that women were willing to join the religion despite its restrictions because they valued the life of structure and discipline it provided.{{sfn|Rowe|1980|p=16}} Rasta discourse often presents women as morally weak and susceptible to deception by [[evil]],{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=97}} and claims that they are impure while [[menstruation|menstruating]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rowe|1y=1980|1p=15|2a1=Lake|2y=1994|2p=244|3a1=Sabelli|3y=2011|3p=141|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=98}} Rastas legitimise these gender roles by citing Biblical

public.{{sfn|Barnett|2006|p=889}} Rasta discourse insists this female dress code is necessary to prevent women attracting men and presents it as an antidote to the [[sexual objectification]] of women in Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=98, 99}} Rasta men are permitted to wear whatever they choose.{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2002|1p=55|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=98}} Although men and women took part in early Rasta rituals alongside each other, from the late 1940s and 1950s a more radical movement within the Rasta community encouraged gender segregation for ceremonies.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}} This was legitimised with the explanation that women were impure through menstruation and that their presence at the ceremonies would distract male participants.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}}\n\nAs it existed in Jamaica, Rastafari did not promote monogamy.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=38}} Rasta men are permitted multiple female sex partners,{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=252|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=99}} while women are expected to reserve their sexual activity for their one male partner.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=99}} Marriage is not usually formalised through legal ceremonies but is a [[common law marriage|common law]] affair,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1966|1p=38|2a1=Kitzinger|2y=1969|2p=253|3a1=Clarke|3y=1986|3p=88|4a1=Semaj|4y=2013|4p=106}} although there are many Rastas who are legally

relationships are known as \"kingmen\".{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=245|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=99}} Rastafari places great importance on family life and the raising of children,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=87\u201388}} with reproduction being encouraged.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=37}} The religion emphasises the place of men in child-rearing, associating this with the recovery of African manhood.{{sfnm|1a1=Kebede|1a2=Knottnerus|1y=1998|1p=504|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=103\u2013104}} Women often work, sometimes while the man is left to raise the children at

have called for greater gender equity in the movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=87|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=107}} The scholar Terisa E. Turner for instance encountered Kenyan feminists who were appropriating Rastafari content to suit their political agenda.{{sfn|Turner|1991|p=86}} Some Rasta women have challenged gender norms by wearing their hair uncovered in public and donning trousers.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=109}}\n\nRastafari regards procreation as the purpose of sex, and thus [[oral sex|oral]] and [[anal sex]] are usually considered forbidden.{{sfn|Sabelli|2011|p=141}} Both [[contraception]] and [[abortion]] are usually censured by Rastas,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1969|1p=253|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=79|3a1=Clarke|3y=1986|3p=88|4a1=Barrett|4y=1997|4p=209|5a1=Edmonds|5y=2012|5p=99}} and a common claim in Rasta discourse is that these were inventions of Babylon created in an attempt to decrease the black African birth-rate.{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1966|1p=37|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=88|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=100|4a1=Sibanda|4y=2016|4p=192}} Rastas typically express hostile attitudes to homosexuality, regarding homosexuals as evil and unnatural;{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1966|1p=35|2a1=Kitzinger|2y=1969|2pp=254\u2013255|3a1=Cashmore|3y=1983|3p=79|4a1=Barnett|4y=2006|4p=879|5a1=Sibanda|5y=2016|5pp=180, 181, 191}} this attitude derives from [[The Bible and homosexuality|references to same-sex sexual activity in the Bible]].{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=184}} Homosexual Rastas probably conceal their sexual orientation because of these attitudes.{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=192}} Rastas typically see the growing acceptance of birth control and homosexuality in Western society as evidence of the degeneration of Babylon as it approaches its apocalyptic end.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\n==Practices==\n{{Main|Livity (spiritual concept)}}\n\nRastas refer to their cultural and religious practices as \"livity\".{{sfnm|1a1=Gjerset|1y=1994|1p=71|2a1=Kebede|2a2=Knottnerus|2y=1998|2p=503|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=32}} Rastafari does not place emphasis on hierarchical structures,{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=54}} and has no professional priesthood,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=32}} with Rastas believing that there is no need for a priest to act as mediator between the worshipper and divinity.{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2002|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=53}} It nevertheless has \"Elders\", an honorific title bestowed upon those with a good reputation among the community.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}} Although respected figures, they do not necessarily have any administrative functions or responsibilities.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}} When they do oversee ritual meetings, they are often responsible for helping to interpret current events in terms of Biblical scripture.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1969|p=262}} Elders are often in communication with each other through a network.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}}\n\n===Grounding===\n\n[[File:Rastafarians celebrate Marcus Garvey.jpg|250px|thumb|right|A group of Rastas in [[Liberia]] celebrating Marcus Garvey's birthday]]\nThe term \"grounding\" is used among Rastas to refer to the establishment of relationships between like-minded practitioners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} Groundings often take place in a commune or yard, and are presided over by an elder.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=88}} The elder is charged with keeping discipline in the group, and can ban certain individuals from attending.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}} The number of participants can range from a handful to several hundred.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=88}} Activities that take place at groundings include the playing of drums, chanting, the singing of hymns, and the recitation of poetry.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=88|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=54}} Ganja, or cannabis, is often smoked.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=88|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=54}} Most groundings contain only men, with women being excluded.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=100}} Some Rasta women have established their own, all-female grounding circles.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=100}}\n\nOne of the central activities at groundings is \"[[reasoning (Rastafari)|reasoning]]\".{{sfnm|1a1=Kebede|1a2=Knottnerus|1y=1998|1p=505|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=56|3a1=Chawane|3y=2014|3p=234}} This is a discussion among assembled Rastas about the religion's principles and their relevance to current events.{{sfnm|1a1=Kebede|1a2=Knottnerus|1y=1998|1pp=505\u2013506|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=56|3a1=Chawane|3y=2014|3p=234}} These discussions are supposed to be non-combative, although attendees can point out the fallacies in any arguments presented.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=56\u201357}} Those assembled inform each other about the revelations that they have received through meditation and dream.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=88}} Each contributor is supposed to push the boundaries of understanding until the entire group has gained greater insight into the topic under discussion.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=57}} In meeting together with likeminded individuals, reasoning helps Rastas to reassure one another of the correctness of their beliefs.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=127}} Rastafari meetings are opened and closed with prayers.

it may have been through Kumina that cannabis became part of Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} A second possible source was the use of cannabis in [[Hinduism|Hindu]] rituals.{{sfnm|1a1=Benard|1y=2007|1p=95, 96|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=55}} Hindu migrants arrived in Jamaica as indentured servants from [[British India]] between 1834 and 1917, and brought cannabis with them.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} A Jamaican Hindu priest, Laloo, was one of Howell's spiritual advisors, and may have influenced his adoption of ganja.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}}\n\nThe adoption of cannabis may also have been influenced by the widespread medicinal and recreational use of cannabis among Afro-Jamaicans in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} Early Rastafarians may have taken an element of Jamaican culture which they associated with their peasant past and the rejection of capitalism and sanctified it by according it Biblical correlates.{{sfn|Benard|2007|pp=91\u201392}} In many countries, cannabis is illegal and by using it, Rastas protest the rules and regulations of Babylon;{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=129}} in the United States, for example, thousands of practitioners have been arrested because of their possession of the drug.{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=5}}  Rastas have also advocated for the legalisation of cannabis in those jurisdictions where it is illegal.{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=76|2a1=Barnett|2y=2006|2p=892|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=184}} In November 2019, the government of [[Barbados]] passed legislation allowing for Rastafarians to use cannabis for religious reasons, provided that groups first follow certain provisions.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=24 November 2019 |title=Government passes ganja legislation for Rastafarians, conditions apply |url=http://www.loopnewsbarbados.com/content/rastas-get-ganja-permission-conditions# |work=Loop |access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n[[File:RastaBongo.jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta using a bongo drum]]\nRastafari music developed at reasoning sessions,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=93}} where drumming, chanting, and dancing are all present.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} Rasta music is performed to praise and commune with Jah,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} and to reaffirm the rejection of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Rastas believe that their music has healing properties, with the ability to cure colds, fevers, and headaches.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Many of these songs are sung to the tune of older Christian hymns,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=94|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=123|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=58}} but others are original Rasta creations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}}\n\nThe bass-line of Rasta music is provided by the [[akete]], a three-drum set, which is accompanied by [[percussion instruments]] like [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s and [[tambourine]]s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} A syncopated rhythm is then provided by the [[fundeh]] drum.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} In addition, a [[peta (drum)|peta]] drum improvises over the rhythm.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} The different components of the music are regarded as displaying different symbolism; the bassline symbolises blows against Babylon, while the lighter beats denote hope for the future.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}}\n\nAs Rastafari developed, popular music became its chief communicative medium.{{sfn|King|2002|p=5}} During the 1950s, [[ska]] was a popular musical style in Jamaica, and although its protests against social and political conditions were mild, it gave early expression to Rasta socio-political ideology.{{sfn|King|2002|p=4}} Particularly prominent in the connection between Rastafari and ska were the musicians [[Count Ossie]] and [[Don Drummond]].{{sfnm|1a1=King|1y=2002|1p=24|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=115}} Ossie was a drummer who believed that black people needed to develop their own style of music;{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=93|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=162}} he was heavily influenced by [[Kumina]] and [[Burru]], two drumming styles developed by African-Jamaicans.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=113}} Ossie subsequently popularised this new Rastafari ritual music by playing at various groundings and groundations around Jamaica,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=113}} with songs like \"Another Moses\" and \"Babylon Gone\" reflecting Rasta influence.{{sfn|King|2002|p=24}} Rasta themes also appeared in Drummond's work, with songs such as \"Reincarnation\" and \"Tribute to Marcus Garvey\".{{sfn|King|2002|p=24}}\n\n1968 saw the development of [[reggae]] in Jamaica, a musical style typified by slower, heavier rhythms than ska and the increased use of [[patois]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=46}} Although like [[calypso music|calypso]], reggae was a medium for [[social commentary]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=vii}} it demonstrated a wider use of radical political and Rasta themes than were previously present in Jamaican popular music.{{sfn|King|2002|p=46}} Reggae artists incorporated Rasta ritual rhythms,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=117}} and also adopted Rasta chants, language, motifs, and social critiques.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=117}} Songs like [[The Wailers]]' \"[[African Herbsman]]\" and [[Peter Tosh]]'s \"Legalize It\" referenced cannabis use,{{sfn|King|2002|p=57}} while tracks like [[The Melodians]]' \"[[Rivers of Babylon]]\" and [[Junior Byles]]' \"Beat Down Babylon\" referenced Rasta beliefs in Babylon.{{sfn|King|2002|p=56}} Reggae gained widespread international popularity during the mid-1970s,{{sfn|King|2002|p=96}} coming to be viewed as music of the oppressed by black people in many different countries.{{sfn|King|2002|p=100}} Many Rastas grew critical of reggae, believing that it had commercialised their religion.{{sfn|King|2002|p=102}} Although reggae contains much Rastafari symbolism,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} and the two are widely associated,{{sfn|King|2002|p=xiii}} the connection is often exaggerated by non-Rastas.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=245}} Most Rastas do not listen to reggae music,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=245}} and reggae has also been utilised by other religious groups, such as evangelical Protestants.{{sfn|Rommen|2006|pp=235\u2013236}} Out of reggae came [[dub music]]; dub artists often employ Rastafari terminology, even when not Rastas themselves.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=178}}\n\n===Language and symbolism===\n\n{{Main|Rastafari vocabulary}}\nIn the 1940s, a distinct form of Rasta language, often known as \"dreadtalk\", developed among Jamaican practitioners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=45}} Rastas typically regard words as having an intrinsic power,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=47}} with Rastafari language reflecting Rastas' own experiences,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=45}} as well as fostering a group identity and cultivating particular values.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=92}} Rastas seek to avoid language that contributes to servility, self-degradation, and the objectification of the person.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=92\u201393}} They believe that by formulating their own language they are launching an ideological attack on the integrity of the [[English language]], which they view as a tool of Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=46, 47}} The use of this language helps Rastas distinguish and separate themselves from non-Rastas,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=93|2a1=Kebede|2a2=Knottnerus|2y=1998|2p=509}} for whom\u2014according to Barrett\u2014Rasta rhetoric can be \"meaningless babbling\".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=103}}\n\n[[File:Flag of Ethiopia (1975\u20131987).svg|thumb|left|Rastas regularly use the three colours of the Ethiopian flag for their movement, although often add black to this tricolour, symbolising the black skin of the African people]]\nRastas make wide use of the pronoun \"I\".{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=1985|1p=288|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=92|3a1=Chevannes|3y=1994|3p=167|4a1=Kebede|4a2=Knottnerus|4y=1998|4p=509|5a1=Edmonds|5y=2012|5p=45}} The use of this word denotes the Rasta view that the self is divine.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=2, 38}} It also reminds each Rasta that they are a human being, not a slave, and that they have value, worth, and dignity as a human being.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=92|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=37}} For instance, Rastas use \"I\" in place of \"me\", \"I and I\" in place of \"we\", \"I-ceive\" in place of \"receive\", \"I-sire\" in place of \"desire\", \"I-rate\" in place of \"create\", and \"I-men\" in place of \"[[Amen]]\".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=92}} Rastas refer to this process as \"InI Consciousness\" or \"Isciousness\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=37}} Rastas typically refer to Haile Selaisse as \"Haile Selassie I\", thus indicating their belief in his divinity.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=92|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=37}} Rastas also typically believe that the [[phonetics]] of a word should be linked to its meaning.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=47}} For instance, Rastas often use the word \"downpression\" in place of \"oppression\" because oppression bears ''down'' on people rather than lifting them ''up'', with \"up\" being phonetically akin to the \"opp-\".{{sfnm|1a1=King|1y=2002|1p=xx|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=47}} Similarly, they often favour \"livicate\" over \"dedicate\" because \"ded-\" is phonetically akin to the word \"dead\".{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=1985|1p=288|2a1=Kebede|2a2=Knottnerus|2y=1998|2p=509|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=47}} In its early decades, Rastas often said \"Peace and Love\" as a greeting, although the use of this declined as the religion aged.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=269|2a1=Semaj|2y=2013|2p=108}}\n\nRastas often make use of the colours red, black, green, and gold.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} Red, gold, and green were used in the [[Flag of Ethiopia|Ethiopian flag]] while, prior to the development of Rastafari, the Jamaican [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] activist Marcus Garvey had used red, green, and black as the colours for his [[United Negro Improvement Association]].{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=159|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=143|3a1=White|3y=2010|3p=307}} According to Garvey, the red symbolised the blood of martyrs, the black symbolised the skin of Africans, and the green represented the vegetation of the land.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=160|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=143}} Many Rastas endorse these associations to the colours.{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} The colour gold is often included alongside Garvey's three colours; it has been adopted from the [[Flag of Jamaica|Jamaican flag]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=143}} and is often interpreted as symbolising the minerals and raw materials which constitute Africa's wealth.{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} Rastas often paint these colours onto their buildings, vehicles, kiosks, and other items,{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} or display them on their clothing, helping to demarcate Rastas from non-Rastas and allowing adherents to recognise their co-religionists.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=160}} As well as being used by Rastas, the colour set has also been adopted by Pan-Africanists more broadly, who use it to display their identification with Afrocentricity;{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} for this reason it was adopted on the flags of many post-independence African states.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} Rastas often accompany the use of these three or four colours with the image of the [[Lion of Judah]], also adopted from the Ethiopian flag and symbolizing Haile Selassie.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}}\n\n===Diet===\n{{Main|Ital}}\n\n[[File:Ital food - 01.jpg|thumb|right|An ital breakfast;

Here, they were sold to European planters and forced to work on the plantations.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} Around a third of these transported Africans were relocated in the Caribbean, with under 700,000 being settled in Jamaica.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} In 1834, slavery in Jamaica was abolished after the British government passed the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=24|2a1=Chevannes|2y=1994|2p=3}} Racial prejudice nevertheless remained prevalent across Jamaican society,{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=3}} with the overwhelming majority of Jamaica's legislative council remaining white throughout the nineteenth century,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=25}} and those of African descent being treated as [[second-class citizen]]s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=24}}\n\nChristian Revivalism was a key influence on Rastafari.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=120}} Many Afro-Jamaicans joined Christian churches during the Great Revival of 1860\u201361.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=25|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=21}} They brought with them many inherited African beliefs and rituals, which syncretised with Christianity in various ways and to varying degrees.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=25}} Some of the new religions that emerged, such as Pukkumina, remained heavily based on traditional African religion, while others, like Revival Zion, were more fully Christian.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=25|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=22}} The majority of these groups practiced spiritual healing and incorporated drumming and chanting, counselling, and spirit possession into their structures.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=26}} Increasing numbers of [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] missionaries from the United States arrived in Jamaica during the early twentieth century, reaching a climax in the 1920s.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=26|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=25}} They provided a way for black Jamaicans\u2014who continued to live with the social memory of enslavement and who were denied any substantial participation in Jamaica's political institutions\u2014to express their hopes, fears, and aspirations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=26}}\n\n===Ethiopianism, Back to Africa, and Marcus Garvey===\n\n[[File:Marcus Garvey 1924-08-05.jpg|thumb|upright|Marcus Garvey, a prominent black nationalist theorist who heavily influenced Rastafari and is regarded as a prophet by many Rastas]]\nAccording to Edmonds, Rastafari emerged from \"the convergence of several religious, cultural, and intellectual streams\",{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=7}} while fellow scholar Wigmoore Francis described it as owing much of its self-understanding to \"intellectual and conceptual frameworks\" dating from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.{{sfn|Francis|2013|p=52}} Both [[Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back to Africa]] ethos remain \"fundamental ingredients of Rastafarian ideology\".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=27}} These two movements predated Rastafari and can be traced back to the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27\u201328}}\n\nIn the nineteenth century, there were growing calls for the African diaspora located in Western Europe and the Americas to be resettled in Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27\u201328}} In that century, many members of the African diaspora were moved to Sierra Leone and Liberia.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27\u201328}} Based in Liberia, the black Christian preacher [[Edward Wilmot Blyden]] began promoting African pride and the preservation of African tradition, customs, and institutions.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1pp=29\u201334|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=75\u201376|3a1=Francis|3y=2013|3pp=54\u201356}} Blyden sought to promote a form of Christianity that was suited to the African context,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=32\u201333}} and believed that black people had to acquire their own historical knowledge about themselves.{{sfn|Francis|2013|p=66}} The idea of the African diaspora's return to Africa was given impetus by the creation of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948 as a nation-state for the [[Jewish diaspora]] to return to.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=18}}\n\nAlso spreading through Africa was Ethiopianism, a movement that accorded special status to the east African nation of Ethiopia because it was mentioned in various Biblical passages.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=34|2a1=Chawane|2y=2014|2p=221}} For adherents of Ethiopianism, \"Ethiopia\" was regarded as a synonym of Africa as a whole.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=34}} Across the continent, although particularly in South Africa, Christian churches were established that referred to themselves as \"Ethiopian\"; these groups were at the forefront of the burgeoning African nationalist movement that sought liberation from European colonial rule.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=34\u201335}}\n\nOf significant influence on Rastafari was the Jamaican-born activist Marcus Garvey, who spent much of his adult life in the United States and United Kingdom. Garvey supported the idea of global [[Black separatism|racial separatism]] and rejected the idea that black people of African descent living in the Americas should campaign for their civil rights; instead he believed that they should migrate ''en masse'' back to Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=41\u201342}} His ideas were opposed by many blacks in the Americas and he experienced hostility from African-American civil rights activists like [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=43}} He also faced opposition from the government of Liberia, which did not want millions of unskilled migrants arriving on its shores.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=44}} As a mass movement, Garveyism declined in the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=43}}\n\nA rumour later spread that in 1916, Garvey had called on his supporters to \"look to Africa\" for the crowning of a black king; this quote was never verified.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=22|2a1=Soumahoro|2y=2007|2pp=38\u201339}} Soumahoro noted that this statement was \"legendary\".{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=38}} Rather, Garvey was critical of Haile Selassie for leaving Ethiopia at the time of the Italian Fascist occupation, describing the king as \"a great coward\" who rules a \"country where black men are chained and flogged.\"{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=22}} Rastafari does not promote all of the views that Garvey espoused, but nevertheless shares many of the same perspectives.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=44}} Rastas hold Garvey in great esteem,{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=77}} with many regarding him as a prophet.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=35|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=7|3a1=Semaj|3y=2013|3p=99|4a1=Chawane|4y=2014|4p=221}} According to Soumahoro, Rastafari \"emerged from the socio-political ferment inaugurated by Marcus Garvey\",{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=39}} while for Cashmore, Garvey was the \"most important\" precursor of the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=3}}\n\n===Haile Selassie and the early Rastas: 1930\u20131949===\n\nHaile Selassie was crowned Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930. A number of Jamaica's Christian clergymen claimed that Selassie's coronation was evidence that he was the black messiah that they believed was prophesied in the Book of Revelation (5:2\u20135; 19:16), the [[Book of Daniel]] (7:3), and the [[Psalms|Book of Psalms]] (68:31).{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=46|2a1=Lewis|2y=1993|2pp=1\u20132|3a1=Loadenthal|3y=2013|3p=10}} Over the following years, a number of street preachers\u2014most notably [[Leonard Howell]], [[Archibald Dunkley]], [[Robert Hinds]], and [[Joseph Hibbert]]\u2014began promoting the idea that Haile Selassie was the returned Jesus.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1993|1p=2|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=81|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=9}} These preachers began promoting this idea within Kingston, and soon the message spread throughout 1930s Jamaica.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=46|2a1=Lewis|2y=1993|2p=2}} Clarke stated that \"to all intents and purposes this was the beginning\" of the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=46}}\n\n[[File:Addis Ababa-8e00855u.jpg|thumb|right|Emperor Haile Selassie, considered by many Rastas to be the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.]]\n\nHowell has been described as the \"leading figure\" in the early Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=82}} Howell preached that black Africans were superior to white Europeans and that Afro-Jamaicans should owe their allegiance to Haile Selassie rather than to [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], King of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]]. The island's British authorities arrested him and charged him with sedition, resulting in a two-year imprisonment.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=46|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=85\u201386|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=11, 13}} Following his release, Howell established the [[Ethiopian Salvation Society]] and in 1939 created a Rasta community known as Pinnacle, in St Catherine. The community attracted between 500 and 2000 people, who were largely self-sufficient.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=25|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=46|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=86|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4pp=13\u201314}} Police feared that Howell was training his followers for an armed rebellion and were angered that it was producing marijuana for sale among the wider community. They raided the community on several occasions and Howell was imprisoned for a further two years.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=26|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=87|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=14\u201315}} On his release he returned to Pinnacle, but the police continued with their raids and shut down the community in 1954; Howell himself was committed to a mental hospital.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=87|2a1=Edmonds |2y= 2012|2p= 15}}\n\nIn 1936, Italy [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invaded and occupied Ethiopia]], with Haile Selassie going into exile. The event brought international condemnation and growing sympathy for the Ethiopian cause.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} In 1937, Selassie then created the [[Ethiopian World Federation]], which established a branch in Jamaica later that decade.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=27|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=47|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=89|4a1=Bonacci|4y=2013|4pp=74, 78}} In 1941, the Italians were driven out of Ethiopia and Selassie returned.  For many Rastas, this event was interpreted as the fulfilment of an event described in the Book of Revelation (19:11\u201319).{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}}\n\n===Growing visibility: 1950\u20131969===\n\nRastafari's main appeal was among the lower classes of Jamaican society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} For its first thirty years, Rastafari was in a conflictual relationship with the Jamaican authorities.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=10}} Jamaica's Rastas expressed contempt for many aspects of the island's society, viewing the government, police, bureaucracy, professional classes, and established churches as instruments of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} Relations between practitioners and the police were strained, with Rastas often being arrested for cannabis possession.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=49|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=93}} During the 1950s the movement grew rapidly in Jamaica itself and also spread to other Caribbean islands, the United States, and the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}}\n\n[[Image:Bob-Marley-in-Concert Zurich 05-30-80.jpg|thumb|left|Reggae musician [[Bob Marley]] did much to raise international awareness of the Rastafari movement]]\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, a more militant brand of Rastafari emerged.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=15}} The vanguard of this was the [[House of Youth Black Faith]], a group whose members were largely based in [[West Kingston, Jamaica|West Kingston]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=16}}\nBacklash against the Rastas grew after a practitioner of the religion allegedly killed a woman in 1957.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In March 1958, the first Rastafarian Universal Convention was held in [[Back-o-Wall]], Kingston.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=50|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=92}} Following the event, militant Rastas unsuccessfully tried to capture the city in the name of Haile Selassie.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=28|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=93}} Later that year they tried again in [[Spanish Town]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} The increasing militancy of some Rastas resulted in growing alarm about the religion in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} According to Cashmore, the Rastas became \"folk devils\" in Jamaican society.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=28}} In 1959, the self-declared prophet and founder of the [[African Reform Church]], [[Claudius Henry]], sold thousands of black Jamaicans, including many Rastas, tickets for a ship that he claimed would take them to Africa. The ship never arrived and Henry was charged with fraud. In 1960 he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the government.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=28\u201329|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3pp=95\u201398|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=19}} Henry's son was accused of being part of a paramilitary

prominent clashes between Rastas and law enforcement was the [[Coral Gardens incident]] of 1963.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=22}} Clamping down on the Rasta movement, in 1964 the island's government implemented tougher laws surrounding marijuana use.{{sfn|King|2002|p=79}}\n\nAt the invite of Jamaica's government, Haile Selassie visited the island for the first time in August 1966, with crowds of Rastas assembling to meet him at the airport.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=158\u2013160|3a1=King|3y=2002|3pp=82\u201383|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=24}} The event was the high point for many of the religion's members.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} Over the course of the 1960s, Jamaica's Rasta community underwent a process of [[Charismatic authority#Routinizing charisma|routinization]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=146}} with the late 1960s witnessing the launch of the first official Rastafarian newspaper, the [[Rastafarian Movement Association]]'s ''Rasta Voice''.{{sfn|King|2002|p=52}} The decade also saw Rastafari develop in increasingly complex ways.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} During that decade, some Rastas began to reinterpret the idea that salvation required a physical return to Africa, instead interpreting salvation as coming through a process of mental decolonisation that embraced African approaches to life.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}}\n\nWhereas its membership had previously come predominantly from poorer sectors of Jamaican society, in the 1960s Rastafari began to attract support from more privileged groups like students and professional musicians.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=25}} The foremost group emphasising this approach were the Twelve Tribes of Israel, whose members came to be known as \"Uptown Rastas\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=25}} Among those attracted to Rastafari in this decade were middle-class intellectuals like [[Leahcim Semaj]], who called for the religious community to place greater emphasis on scholarly social theory as a method of achieving change.{{sfn|King|2002|p=103}} Although some Jamaican Rastas were critical of him,{{sfn|King|2002|p=81}} many came under the influence of the Guyanese black nationalist academic [[Walter Rodney]], who lectured to their community in 1968 before publishing his thoughts as the pamphlet ''Groundings''.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2013|2pp=297-298|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=26}} Like Rodney, many Jamaican Rastas were influenced by the U.S.-based [[Black Power]] movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=25\u201326}} After Black Power declined following the deaths of prominent exponents such as [[Malcolm X]], [[Michael X]], and [[George

exploded.{{sfn|King|2002|p=96}} The most successful reggae artist was Bob Marley, who\u2014according to Cashmore\u2014\"more than any other individual, was responsible for introducing Rastafarian themes, concepts and demands to a truly universal audience\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=108}} Reggae's popularity led to a growth in \"pseudo-Rastafarians\", individuals who listened to reggae and wore Rasta clothing but did not share its belief system.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=100, 102}} Many Rastas were angered by this, believing it commercialised their religion.{{sfn|King|2002|p=102}}\n\nThrough reggae, Rasta musicians became increasingly important in Jamaica's political life during the 1970s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=53}} In his desire to move towards [[democratic socialism]], Jamaican Prime Minister [[Michael Manley]] employed some Rasta imagery, and also courted and obtained support from Marley and other reggae musicians, thus helping to bolster his popularity with the electorate.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Lewis|2y=1993|2p=12|3a1=Lewis|3y=1994|3pp=290\u2013291|4a1=King|4y=2002|4pp=105, 108\u2013111}} Manley described Rastas as a \"beautiful and remarkable people\",{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=ix}} and carried a cane, the \"rod of correction\", which he claimed was a gift from Haile

employed Rasta language, symbols, and reggae references in their campaigns,{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1994|1p=12|2a1=Lewis|2y=1994|2p=291|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=27}} while Rasta symbols became increasingly mainstream in Jamaican society.{{sfn|King|2002|p=106}} This helped to confer greater legitimacy on Rastafari,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=27}} with reggae and Rasta imagery being increasingly presented as a core part of Jamaica's [[cultural heritage]] for the marketing purposes of the growing tourist industry.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nEnthusiasm for Rastafari was likely dampened by the death of Haile Selassie in 1975 and that of Marley in 1981.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=28}} During the 1980s, the number of Rastas in Jamaica declined,{{sfn|King|2002|p=120}} with Pentecostal and other Charismatic Christian groups proving more successful at attracting young recruits.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} Several publicly prominent Rastas converted to Christianity,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} and two of those who did so\u2014[[Judy Mowatt]] and [[Tommy Cowan]]\u2014maintained that Marley had converted from Rastafari to Christianity, in the form of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]], during his final days.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=29\u201330}} The significance of Rastafari messages in reggae also declined with the growing popularity of [[dancehall]], a Jamaican musical genre that typically foregrounded lyrical themes of hyper-masculinity, violence, and sexual activity rather than religious symbolism.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} However, in the 1980s, a Rasta practitioner, [[Barbara Makeda Blake Hannah]], was appointed a Senator in the Jamaican Parliament.{{sfn|Semaj|2013|p=98}}\n\nThe mid-1990s saw a revival of Rastafari-focused reggae associated with musicians like [[Anthony B]], [[Buju Banton]], [[Luciano]], [[Sizzla]], and [[Capleton]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} From the 1990s, Jamaica also witnessed the growth of organised political activity within the Rasta community, seen for instance through campaigns for the legalisation of marijuana and the creation of political parties like the [[Jamaican Alliance Movement]] and the [[Imperial Ethiopian World Federation Incorporated Political Party]], none of which attained more than minimal electoral support.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=30\u201331}} In 1995, the Rastafari Centralization Organization was established in Jamaica as an attempt to organise the Rastafari community.{{sfn|Barnett|2002|p=56}}\n\n==Organization==\n\nRastafari is not a homogeneous movement and has no single administrative structure,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} nor any single leader.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=91|2a1=King|2y=2002|2p=xvii}} Rastas avoid centralised and hierarchical structures because they do not want to replicate the structures of Babylon and because their religion's ultra-individualistic ethos places emphasis on inner divinity.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=52\u201353}} The structure of Rastafari groups is less like those of Christian denominations and is instead akin to the cellular structure of other African diasporic traditions like [[Haitian Vodou]], Cuban [[Santer\u00eda]], and Jamaica's [[Revival Zion]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} Since the 1970s, there have been attempts to unify all Rastas, namely through the establishment of the [[Rastafari Movement Association]], which sought political mobilisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} In 1982, the first international assembly of Rastafari groups took place in [[Toronto]], Canada.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} This and subsequent international

Rastafari===\n\n{{Main|Mansions of Rastafari}}\n\n[[File:ReggaeV4.0.png|thumb|right|A stylized Rastafari motif, depicting the [[Lion of Judah]]]]\n\nSub-divisions of Rastafari are often referred to as \"houses\" or \"mansions\", in keeping with a passage from the [[Gospel of John]] (14:2): as translated in the [[King James Bible]], Jesus states \"In my father's house are many mansions\".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The three most prominent branches are the House of Nyabinghi, the Bobo Ashanti, and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, although other important groups include the Church of Haile Selassie I, Inc., and the Fulfilled Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}}\n\nProbably the largest Rastafari group, the [[Nyabinghi|House of Nyabinghi]] is an aggregate of more traditional and militant Rastas who seek to retain the movement close to the way in which it existed during the 1940s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} They stress the idea that Haile Selassie was Jah and the reincarnation of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The wearing of dreadlocks is regarded as indispensable and patriarchal gender roles are strongly emphasised,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} while, according to Cashmore, they are  \"vehemently anti-white\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=25}} Nyabinghi Rastas refuse to compromise with Babylon, and are often critical of reggae musicians like Marley, whom they regard as having collaborated with the commercial music industry.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=59, 62}}\n\nThe [[Bobo Ashanti]] sect was founded in Jamaica by [[Charles Edwards (Rastafarian)|Emanuel Charles Edwards]] through the establishment of his Ethiopia Africa Black International Congress (EABIC) in 1958.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=2012|1p=63|2a1=Merritt|2y=2017|2p=285}} The group established a commune in [[Bull Bay]], where they were led by Edwards until his 1994 death.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=2012|1p=64|2a1=Merritt|2y=2017|2pp=285\u2013286}} The group hold to a highly rigid ethos.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} Edwards advocated the idea of a new trinity, with Haile Selassie as the living God, himself as the Christ, and Garvey as the prophet.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=182|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=69|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}} Male members are divided into two categories: the \"priests\" who conduct religious services and the \"prophets\" who take place in reasoning sessions.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} It places greater restrictions on women than most other forms of Rastafari;{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=69}} women are regarded as impure because of menstruation and childbirth, and so are not permitted to cook for men.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group teaches that black Africans are God's chosen people and are superior to white Europeans,{{sfnm|1a1=Barnett|1y=2005|1p=69|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=64}} with members often refusing to associate with white people.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=157}} Bobo Ashanti Rastas are recognisable by their long, flowing robes and turbans.{{sfnm|1a1=Lake|1y=1994|1p=247|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=69|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}}\n\n[[File:Twelve Tribes of Israel headquarters.jpg|thumb|left|The headquarters of the Twelve Tribes of Israel organisation in Shashamane, Ethiopia]]\n\nThe [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]] sect was founded in 1968 in Kingston by [[Vernon Carrington]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1993|1p=11|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=227|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2010|3pp=961, 962|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=64}} He proclaimed himself the reincarnation of the Old Testament prophet [[Gad (son of Jacob)|Gad]] and his followers call him \"Prophet Gad\", \"Brother Gad\", or \"Gadman\".{{sfnm|1a1=Rubenstein|1a2=Suarez|1y=1994|1p=2|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=962|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}} It is commonly regarded as the most liberal form of Rastafari and the closest to Christianity;{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}} some Rastas regard it as being heretical.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=323}} Practitioners are often dubbed \"Christian Rastas\" because they believe Jesus is the only saviour; Haile Selassie is accorded importance, but is not viewed as the second coming of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=67}} The group divides its members into twelve groups according to which [[Hebrew calendar]] month they were born; each month is associated with a particular colour, body part, and mental function.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=229|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=68|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=65}} Maintaining dreadlocks and an ital diet are considered commendable but not essential,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=66\u201367}} while adherents are called upon to read a chapter of the Bible each day.{{sfnm|1a1=Edmonds|1y=2012|1p=68|2a1=Barnett|2y=2005|2p=67|3a1=Bedasse|3y=2013|3p=302}} Membership is open to individuals of any racial background.{{sfn|Barnett|2005|p=68}}\n\nThe Twelve Tribes peaked in popularity during the 1970s, when it attracted artists, musicians, and many middle-class followers, resulting in the term \"middle-class Rastas\" and \"uptown Rastas\" being applied to members of the group.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} Marley was one such of these musicians belonging to the Twelve Tribes.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=54|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=230}} Carrington died in 2005, since which time the Twelve Tribes of Israel have been led by an executive council.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} As of 2010, it was recorded as being the largest of the centralized Rasta groups.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} It remains headquartered in Kingston, although has followers outside Jamaica;{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|pp=961\u2013962}} it was responsible for establishing the Rasta community in Shashame, Ethiopia.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1993|1p=11|2a1=Rubenstein|2a2=Suarez|2y=1994|2p=4}}\n\nThe Church of Haile Selassie, Inc was founded by Abuna Foxe, and operated much like a mainstream Christian church, with a hierarchy of functionaries, weekly services, and [[Sunday schools]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=68\u201369}} In adopting this broad approach, the Church seeks to develop Rastafari's respectability in wider society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} Fulfilled Rastafari is a multi-ethnic movement that has spread in popularity during the twenty-first century, in large part through the [[Internet]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The Fulfilled Rastafari group accept Haile Selassie's statements that he was a man and that he was a devout Christian, and so place emphasis on worshipping Jesus through the example set forth by Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The wearing of dreadlocks and the adherence to an ital diet are considered issues up to the individual.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}}\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Born in the ghettos of Kingston, Jamaica, the Rastafarian movement has captured the imagination of

It is also to be found in smaller numbers in parts of Africa\u2014for example, in Ethiopia, Ghana, and Senegal\u2014and in Australia and New Zealand, particularly among the Maori.|source=\u2014 Sociologist of religion [[Peter B. Clarke]], 1986{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=17}} }}\n\nAs of 2012, there were an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas worldwide.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} They can be found in many different regions, including most of the world's major population centers.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} Rastafari's influence on wider society has been more substantial than its numerical size,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=14|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=71}} particularly in fostering a racial, political, and cultural consciousness among the African diaspora, Africans themselves, and other dominated communities across the world.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} Men dominate Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} In its early years, most of its followers were men, and the women who did adhere to it tended to remain in the background.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} This picture of Rastafari's demographics has been confirmed by ethnographic studies conducted in the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nThe Rasta message resonates with many people who feel marginalised and alienated by the values and institutions of their society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Internationally, it has proved most popular among the poor and among marginalised youth.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=63}} In valorising Africa and blackness, Rastafari provides a positive identity for youth in the African diaspora by allowing them to psychologically reject their social stigmatisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} It then provides these disaffected people with the discursive stance from which they can challenge capitalism and consumerism, providing them with symbols of resistance and defiance.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Cashmore expressed the view that \"whenever there are black people who sense an injust disparity between their own material conditions and those of the whites who surround them and tend to control major social institutions, the Rasta messages have relevance.\"{{sfn|Cashmore|1984|p=3}}\n\n===Conversion and deconversion===\n\nRastafari is a non-missionary religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} However, elders from Jamaica often go \"trodding\" to instruct new converts in the fundamentals of the religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} On researching English Rastas during the 1970s, Cashmore noted that they had not [[religious conversion|converted]] instantaneously, but rather had undergone \"a process of drift\" through which they gradually adopted Rasta beliefs and practices, resulting in their ultimate acceptance of Haile Selassie's central importance.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=55}} Rastas often claim that\u2014rather than converting to the religion\u2014they were actually always a Rasta and that their embrace of its beliefs was merely the realisation of this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=6}} There is no formal ritual carried out to mark an individual's entry into the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=128}} Rastas regard themselves as an exclusive and elite community, membership of which is restricted to those who have the \"insight\" to recognise Haile Selassie's importance.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=9}} Practitioners thus often regard themselves as the \"enlightened ones\" who have \"seen the light\".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=57}} Many see no point in establishing good relations with non-Rastas, believing that the latter will never accept Rastafari doctrine as truth.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nSome Rastas have left the religion. Clarke noted that among British Rastas, some returned to Pentecostalism and other forms of Christianity, while others embraced [[Islam]] or no religion.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some English ex-Rastas described disillusionment when the societal transformation promised by Rastafari failed to appear, while others felt that while Rastafari would be appropriate for agrarian communities in Africa and the Caribbean, it was not suited to industrialised British society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some experienced disillusionment after developing the view that Haile Selassie had been an oppressive leader of the Ethiopian people.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Cashmore found that some British Rastas who had more militant views left the religion after finding its focus on reasoning and music insufficient for the struggle against white domination and racism.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=97}}\n\n===Regional spread===\n\nAlthough it remains most concentrated in the Caribbean,{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=2}} Rastafari has spread to many areas of the world and adapted into many localised variants.{{sfn|Hansing|2001|p=733}} It has spread primarily in Anglophone regions and countries, largely because reggae music has primarily been produced in the English language.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=63}} It is thus most commonly found in the Anglophone Caribbean, United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, and Anglophone parts of Africa.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=64}}\n\n====Jamaica and the Americas====\n[[File:Jamaican Man.jpg|thumb|upright|A Rastafari man in Jamaica.]]\n\nBarrett described Rastafari as \"the largest, most identifiable, indigenous movement in Jamaica.\"{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} In the mid-1980s, there were approximately 70,000 members and sympathisers of Rastafari in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} The majority of them were male, working-class, former Christians aged between 18 and 40.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} In the 2011 Jamaican census, 29,026 individuals identified as Rastas.<ref name=\"state2007\">{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90259.htm |title=Jamaica |publisher=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (US State Department)|date=September 14, 2007 |accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref> Jamaica's Rastas were initially entirely from the Afro-Jamaican majority,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=2}} and although most remain Afro-Jamaican, Rastafari has also gained members from the island's [[Chinese Jamaicans|Chinese]], [[Indo-Jamaicans|Indian]], Afro-Chinese, Afro-Jewish, [[mulatto]], and [[White Jamaican|white]] minorities.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2\u20133}} Until 1965 the vast majority were from the lower classes, although it has since attracted many middle-class members; by the 1980s there were Jamaican Rastas working as lawyers and university professors.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2, 241}} Jamaica is often valorised by Rastas as the fountain-head of their faith, and many Rastas living elsewhere travel to the island on [[pilgrimage]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=87}}\n\nBoth through travel between the islands,{{sfn|Gjerset|1994|p=67}} and through reggae's popularity,{{sfnm|1a1=Gjerset|1y=1994|1p=67|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=81}} Rastafari spread across the eastern Caribbean during the 1970s. Here, its ideas complemented the anti-colonial and Afrocentric views prevalent in countries like Trinidad, Grenada, Dominica, and St Vincent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=81}} In these countries, the early Rastas often engaged in cultural and political movements to a greater extent than their Jamaican counterparts had.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=82}} Various Rastas were involved in Grenada's 1979 [[New Jewel Movement]] and were given positions in the Grenadine government until it was overthrown and replaced following the [[Invasion of Grenada|U.S. invasion of 1983]].{{sfnm|1a1=Campbell|1y=1980|1pp=50\u201351|2a1=Simpson|2y=1985|2p=291|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=82}} Although [[Fidel Castro]]'s Marxist\u2013Leninist government generally discouraged foreign influences, Rastafari was introduced to Cuba alongside reggae in the 1970s.{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=734|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=65|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=82\u201383}} Foreign Rastas studying in Cuba during the 1990s connected with its reggae scene and helped to further ground it in Rasta beliefs.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=82\u201383}} In Cuba, most Rastas have been male and from the [[Afro-Cuban]] population.{{sfnm|1a1=Hansing|1y=2001|1p=736|2a1=Hansing|2y=2006|2p=69}}\n\nRastafari was introduced to the United States and Canada with the migration of Jamaicans to continental North America in the 1960s and 1970s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} American police were often suspicious of Rastas and regarded Rastafari as a criminal sub-culture.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=76}} Rastafari also attracted converts from within several Native American communities,{{sfn|Hansing|2001|p=733}} and picked up some support from white members of the [[Hippy]] subculture, which was then in decline.{{sfn|Loadenthal|2013|p=12}} In Latin America, small communities of Rastas have also established in Brazil, Panama, and Nicaragua.{{sfn|Hansing|2006|p=64}}\n\n====Africa====\n\nSome Rastas in the African diaspora have followed through with their beliefs about resettlement in Africa, with Ghana and Nigeria being particularly favoured.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=78}} Caribbean Rastas arrived in Ghana during the 1960s, encouraged by its first post-independence president, [[Kwame Nkrumah]], while some native Ghanaians also converted to the religion.{{sfn|White|2010|pp=304, 306\u2013307}} The largest congregation of Rastas has been in southern parts of Ghana, around [[Accra]], [[Tema]], and the [[Cape Coast]],{{sfn|White|2010|p=314}} although Rasta communities also exist in the Muslim-majority area of northern Ghana.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=152}} The Rasta migrants' wearing of dreadlocks was akin to that of the native [[fetish priest]]s, which may have assisted the presentation of these Rastas as having authentic African roots in Ghanaian society.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=154\u2013155}} However, Ghanaian Rastas have complained of social ostracism and prosecution for cannabis possession, while non-Rastas in often consider them to be \"drop-outs\", \"too Western\", and \"not African enough\".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=161\u2013162}} Another West African group to wear dreadlocks are the [[Baye Faal]], a [[Mouride]] sect in [[Senegambia]], some of whose practitioners have started calling themselves \"Rastas\" in reference to their visual similarity to Rastafari.{{sfn|Savishinsky|1994|p=211}} The popularity of dreadlocks and marijuana among the Baye Faal may have been spread in large part through access to Rasta-influenced reggae in the 1970s.{{sfn|Savishinsky|1994|p=214}} A small community of Rastas also established in Burkina Faso.{{sfn|Wittmann|2011|pp=158\u2013159}}\n\n[[File:East London, Eastern Cape, South Africa (20512396425).jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta street vendor in South Africa's [[Eastern Cape]]]]\n\nIn the 1960s, a Rasta settlement was established in [[Shashamane]], Ethiopia, on land made available by Haile Selassie's Ethiopian World Federation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} The community faced many problems; 500 acres were confiscated by the Marxist government of [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} There were also conflicts with local Ethiopians, who largely regarded the incoming Rastas, and their Ethiopia-born children, as foreigners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} The Shashamane community peaked at a population of 2,000, although subsequently declined to around 200.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}}\n\nBy the early 1990s, a Rasta community was present in [[Nairobi]], Kenya, whose approach to the religion was informed both by reggae and by traditional [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] religion.{{sfn|Turner|1991|p=82}} Rastafari groups have also appeared in Zimbabwe,{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=182}} and in South Africa;{{sfn|Chawane|2014|p=220}} in 2008, there were at least 12,000 Rastas in the country.{{sfn|Mhango|2008|p=234}} At an [[African Union]]/[[Caribbean Diaspora]] conference in South Africa in 2005, a statement was released characterising Rastafari as a force for integration of Africa and the African

settled in the [[Notting Hill]] area of Northwest London.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} By the late 1960s, Rastafari had attracted converts from the second-generation of British Caribbean people, offering an outlet for the economic hardship, racial discrimination, and social isolation that many faced.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} It spread among the black working-classes not just of London, but also in [[Birmingham]], [[Leicester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], and [[Bristol]].{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=58}} Its spread was aided by the [[gang]] structures that had been cultivated among black British youth by the [[rudeboy]] subculture; these gangs proved to be a breeding ground for Rastafari themes.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=56}} British Rastafari gained increasing attention in the 1970s through reggae's popularity,{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1p=176|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=74}} although the police commonly regarded it as a criminal sub-culture.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=74\u201375}} Following

The screenplay by [[Mark L. Smith]] and I\u00f1\u00e1rritu is based in part on [[Michael Punke]]'s [[The Revenant (novel)|2002 novel of the same name]], describing [[frontiersman]] [[Hugh Glass]]'s experiences in 1823. That novel is in turn based on the 1915 poem ''[[Cycle of the West#The Song of Hugh Glass|The Song of Hugh Glass]]''. The film stars [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], [[Tom Hardy]], [[Domhnall Gleeson]], and [[Will Poulter]].\n\nDevelopment began in August 2001 when producer [[Akiva Goldsman]] purchased Punke's manuscript. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu signed on to direct in August 2011 and in April 2014, after several delays due to other projects, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu confirmed that he was beginning work on ''The Revenant'' and that DiCaprio would play the lead role. [[Principal photography]] began in October 2014. Location and crew concerns delayed the film from May to August 2015.\n\n''The Revenant'' premiered at the [[TCL Chinese Theatre]] on December 16, 2015, and had a [[limited release]] on December 25, [[wide release|expanding]] on January 8, 2016. The film received largely positive reviews, with praise for DiCaprio and Hardy's performances, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's direction, and Lubezki's cinematography.<ref name=\"Stephanie Zacharek 2016, p54\">Stephanie Zacharek, TIME magazine, January 18, 2016, p54.</ref><ref name=\"MoraskiCBS_151225\" /><ref name=\"newyorkerreview\">{{cite web|last1=Lane|first1=Anthony|title=Wilder West \"The Hateful Eight\" and \"The Revenant.\"|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/01/04/wilder-west|accessdate=February 8, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"newyorkerreview\" /> It won three [[Golden Globe Award]]s and five [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]]. At the [[88th Academy Awards]], the film received 12 nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] (Hardy), winning [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (I\u00f1\u00e1rritu), [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (DiCaprio), and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] ([[Emmanuel Lubezki]]). DiCaprio also won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]], [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role|Screen Actors Guild Award]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role|BAFTA]], and [[Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actor|Critics' Choice Award]] for Best Actor.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, summaries should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn late 1823, [[Hugh Glass]] guides Captain [[Andrew Henry (fur trader)|Andrew Henry]]'s [[trapping|trappers]] through territory of the present day [[Dakotas]]. While he and his half-[[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] son, Hawk, are hunting, the company's camp is attacked by an [[Arikara]] war party seeking to recover their Chief's abducted daughter, Powaqa. Many of the trappers are killed during the fight, while the rest escape onto a boat. Guided by Glass, the survivors travel on foot to [[Fort Kiowa]], as he believes traveling downriver will make them vulnerable. After docking, the crew stashes the pelts near the shore.\n\nWhile scouting game, Glass is attacked by a [[grizzly bear]] and left near death. Trapper John Fitzgerald, fearful of another Arikara attack, argues that the group must [[Euthanasia|mercy-kill]] Glass and keep moving. Henry agrees, but is unable to pull the trigger; instead, he offers money for someone to stay with Glass and bury him after his death. When the only volunteers are Hawk and the young [[Jim Bridger]], Fitzgerald agrees to stay for money, to recoup his losses from the abandoned pelts.\n\nAfter the others leave, Fitzgerald attempts to smother Glass but is discovered by Hawk. Fitzgerald, concerned that Hawk's loud reaction to him attempting to kill Glass could alert Bridger, who is away gathering water, stabs Hawk to death as Glass watches helplessly. The next morning, Fitzgerald convinces Bridger, who is unaware of Hawk's murder, that the Arikara are approaching and they must abandon Glass. Bridger protests at first, but ultimately follows Fitzgerald after the latter leaves Glass half-buried alive in a makeshift grave. He also leaves his canteen, in which he engraved a spiral symbol, with Glass. After they depart, Fitzgerald admits he lied about the Arikara approaching. When Fitzgerald and Bridger later meet Henry at the fort, Fitzgerald tells him that Glass died and Hawk vanished. Bridger is complicit in the lie about Glass's death, even though he knew nothing of Hawk's.\n\nGlass begins an arduous journey through the wilderness. He performs crude [[cauterization|self-surgery]] and eludes the pursuing Arikara by jumping into white water [[rapids]]. Bridger and Fitzgerald scout a pillaged Indian village. Bridger leaves some food behind for a lone survivor.\n\nGlass encounters Pawnee refugee Hikuc, who says that \"revenge is in the Creator's hands.\" The men share bison meat and travel together. As a storm approaches, Hikuc constructs a makeshift sweat lodge for a feverish Glass to shelter in. After a hallucinogenic experience in the lodge, Glass emerges to discover his wounds healing and Hikuc hanged by French hunters. He infiltrates their camp and sees the leader raping Powaqa. He frees her, kills several hunters, and recovers Hikuc's horse as Powaqa removes her rapist's genitals, leaving Bridger's canteen behind. The next morning, Glass is ambushed by the Arikara and driven over a cliff on his horse. He survives the stormy night by [[Disembowelment|eviscerating]] the horse and sheltering inside its carcass.\n\nA frightened French survivor staggers into Fort Kiowa and Bridger recognizes his canteen as Glass's due to the spiral symbol. Believing it stolen, Henry organizes a search party. Fitzgerald, realizing Glass is alive, empties the outpost's safe and flees. The search party finds the exhausted Glass. Furious, Henry orders Bridger arrested, but Glass vouches that Bridger wasn't present when Fitzgerald murdered Hawk, and was later deceived by the higher-ranking Fitzgerald. Glass and Henry set out in pursuit of Fitzgerald.\n\nAfter the two split up, Fitzgerald ambushes, kills and scalps Henry. Glass uses Henry's corpse on his horse as a decoy and shoots Fitzgerald in the arm. He pursues Fitzgerald to a riverbank where they engage in a brutal fight. Glass is about to kill Fitzgerald, but spots a band of Arikara downstream. He remembers Hikuc's words and pushes Fitzgerald downstream into the hands of the Arikara. Elk Dog kills and scalps Fitzgerald and the Arikara (having found Powaqa) spare Glass. Near death, Glass retreats into the mountains where he is visited by the spirit of his wife.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as [[Hugh Glass]]\n* [[Tom Hardy]] as John Fitzgerald\n* [[Domhnall Gleeson]] as [[Andrew Henry (fur trader)|Andrew Henry]]\n* [[Will Poulter]] as [[Jim Bridger]]\n* [[Forrest Goodluck]] as Hawk\n* [[Paul Anderson (actor)|Paul Anderson]] as Anderson\n* [[Kristoffer Joner]] as Murphy\n* [[Duane Howard]] as Elk Dog\n* [[Melaw Nakehk'o]] as Powaqa\n* [[Arthur Redcloud]] as Hikuc\n* [[Lukas Haas]] as Jones\n* [[Brendan Fletcher]] as Fryman\n* [[Grace Dove]] as Hugh Glass's wife\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development and financing===\nDevelopment of ''The Revenant'' began in August 2001, with producer [[Akiva Goldsman]] acquiring the rights to [[Michael Punke]]'s then-unpublished manuscript.<ref name=\"Goldsman\" /> David Rabe had written the film's script.<ref name=\"DiCaprioCast\" /> The production was picked up by [[Park Chan-wook]], with [[Samuel L.

In an interview with ''Creative Screenwriting'', Smith admitted during this process he was unsure if I\u00f1\u00e1rritu would even be able to film some of the sequences they wrote.

In February 2015, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, who shot the film using [[sunlight|natural lighting]], stated that production would last \"until the end of April or May\", as the crew is \"shooting in such remote far-away locations that, by the time we arrive and have to return, we have already spent 40% of the day\".<ref name=\"LongerFilming\"/><ref name=\"NineMonths\" /><ref name=\"FilmingEndMarch\" /> Ultimately, principal photography wrapped in August 2015.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe film was shot in twelve locations in three countries: Canada, the United States, and Argentina.<ref name=\"FilmingSpots\" /> In Canada, filming took place in [[Calgary]] and [[Fortress Mountain Resort|Fortress Mountain]] in [[Alberta]], in Kananaskis Country west of Calgary, the Badlands near Drumheller, \nand at [[Squamish, British Columbia|Squamish]] and Mammoth Studios, [[Burnaby]], in [[British Columbia]].<ref name=\"FilmingSpots\" /> The scenes in the waterfall were filmed at the Kootenai Falls near [[Libby, Montana]].

Guided by Glass, the survivors travel on foot to [[Fort Kiowa]], as he believes traveling downriver will make them vulnerable. After docking, the crew stashes the pelts near the shore.\n\nWhile scouting game, Glass is attacked by a [[grizzly bear]] and left near death. Trapper John Fitzgerald, fearful of another Arikara attack, argues that the group must [[Euthanasia|mercy-kill]] Glass and keep moving. Henry agrees, but is unable to pull the trigger; instead, he offers money for someone to stay with Glass and bury him after his death. When the only volunteers are Hawk and the young [[Jim Bridger]], Fitzgerald agrees to stay for money, to recoup his losses from the abandoned pelts.\n\nAfter the others leave, Fitzgerald attempts to smother Glass but is discovered by Hawk. Fitzgerald, concerned that Hawk's loud reaction to him attempting to kill Glass could alert the Arikara, stabs Hawk to death as Glass watches helplessly. The next morning, Fitzgerald convinces Bridger, who is unaware of Hawk's murder, that the Arikara are approaching and they must abandon Glass. Bridger protests at first, but ultimately follows Fitzgerald after the latter leaves Glass half-buried alive in a makeshift grave. He also leaves his canteen, in which he engraved a spiral symbol, with Glass. After they depart, Fitzgerald admits he lied about the Arikara approaching. When Fitzgerald and Bridger later meet Henry at the fort, Fitzgerald tells him that Glass died and Hawk vanished. Bridger is complicit in the lie about Glass's death, even though he knew nothing of Hawk's.\n\nGlass begins an arduous journey through the wilderness. He performs crude [[cauterization|self-surgery]] and eludes the pursuing Arikara by jumping into white water [[rapids]]. Bridger and Fitzgerald scout a pillaged Indian village. Bridger leaves some food behind for a lone survivor.\n\nGlass encounters Pawnee refugee Hikuc, who says that \"revenge is in the Creator's hands.\" The men share bison meat and travel together. As a storm approaches, Hikuc constructs a makeshift sweat lodge for a feverish Glass to shelter in. After a hallucinogenic experience in the lodge, Glass emerges to discover his wounds healing and Hikuc hanged by French hunters. He infiltrates their camp and sees the leader raping Powaqa. He frees her, kills several hunters, and recovers Hikuc's horse as Powaqa removes her rapist's genitals, leaving Bridger's canteen behind. The next morning, Glass is ambushed by the Arikara and driven over a cliff on his horse. He survives the stormy night by [[Disembowelment|eviscerating]] the horse and sheltering inside its carcass.\n\nA frightened French survivor staggers into Fort Kiowa and Bridger recognizes his canteen as Glass's due to the spiral symbol. Believing it stolen, Henry organizes a search party. Fitzgerald, realizing Glass is alive, empties the outpost's safe and flees. The search party finds the exhausted Glass. Furious, Henry orders Bridger arrested, but Glass vouches that Bridger wasn't present when Fitzgerald murdered Hawk, and was later deceived by the higher-ranking Fitzgerald. Glass and Henry set out in pursuit of Fitzgerald.\n\nAfter the two split up, Fitzgerald ambushes, kills and scalps Henry. Glass uses Henry's corpse on his horse as a decoy and shoots Fitzgerald in the arm. He pursues Fitzgerald to a riverbank where they engage in a brutal fight. Glass is about to kill Fitzgerald, but spots a band of Arikara downstream. He remembers Hikuc's words and pushes Fitzgerald downstream into the hands of the Arikara. Elk Dog kills and scalps Fitzgerald and the Arikara (having found Powaqa) spare Glass. Near death, Glass retreats into the mountains where he is visited by the spirit of his wife.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as [[Hugh Glass]]\n* [[Tom Hardy]] as John Fitzgerald\n* [[Domhnall Gleeson]] as [[Andrew Henry (fur trader)|Andrew Henry]]\n* [[Will Poulter]] as [[Jim Bridger]]\n* [[Forrest Goodluck]] as Hawk\n* [[Paul Anderson (actor)|Paul Anderson]] as Anderson\n* [[Kristoffer Joner]] as Murphy\n* [[Duane Howard]] as Elk Dog\n* [[Melaw Nakehk'o]] as Powaqa\n* [[Arthur Redcloud]] as Hikuc\n* [[Lukas Haas]] as Jones\n* [[Brendan Fletcher]] as Fryman\n* [[Grace Dove]] as Hugh Glass's wife\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development and financing===\nDevelopment of ''The Revenant'' began in August 2001, with producer [[Akiva Goldsman]] acquiring the rights to [[Michael Punke]]'s then-unpublished manuscript.<ref name=\"Goldsman\" /> David Rabe had written the film's script.<ref name=\"DiCaprioCast\" /> The production was picked up by [[Park Chan-wook]], with [[Samuel L.

It is produced by [[Shine Australia]] and screens on [[Network 10]]. Restaurateur and chef [[Gary Mehigan]], chef [[George Calombaris]] and food critic [[Matt Preston]] served as the show's main judges until 2019, when they were replaced by [[MasterChef Australia (series 4)|Series 4]] winner and chef [[Andy Allen (chef)|Andy Allen]], food critic Melissa Leong, and restaurateur and chef [[Jock Zonfrillo]].\n\nThe series has also spawned four spin-off series: ''[[Celebrity MasterChef Australia]]'', which featured celebrity contestants,<ref name=\"celeb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25791148-661,00.html|title=Herald Sun|work=news.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> ''[[Junior MasterChef Australia]]'', which featured younger contestants,<ref name=\"jmc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,26269545-5003422,00.html|title=The Courier Mail|work=news.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> ''[[MasterChef Australia All-Stars]]'', which featured returning contestants from the first three series,<ref name=\"allstars\" /> and ''[[MasterChef Australia: The Professionals]]'', which featured professional chefs as contestants.<ref name=\"prof\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2012/10/masterchef-the-professionals-vs-my-kitchen-rules.html|title=MasterChef: The Professionals vs My Kitchen Rules?|date=29 October 2012|work=tvtonight.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> These spin-off shows did not air in 2014 after the producers of the show announced that they wanted to solely focus on the original version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/09/masterchef-sticks-to-one-series-for-2014.html|title=MasterChef sticks to one series for 2014|date=31 August 2013|work=tvtonight.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\n''MasterChef Australia'' has a different format from that of the original British ''[[MasterChef (UK TV series)|MasterChef]]'' and ''MasterChef Goes Large'' formats. Initial rounds consist of a large number of hopeful contestants from across Australia individually \"auditioning\" by presenting a food dish before the three judges in order to gain one of 50 semi-final places. Entrants must be over 18 years old and their main source of income cannot come from preparing and cooking fresh food in a professional environment.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Auditions: Masterchef|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2008/12/auditions-masterchef.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=12 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe semi-finalists then compete in several challenges that test their food knowledge and preparation skills. In Season 1, the top 50 competed until 20 were left, with the final 20 progressing to the main stage of the show. From Season 2, 24 contestants progress. The contestants will then be whittled down through a number of individual and team-based cooking challenges and weekly elimination rounds until a winning MasterChef is crowned. The winner plays for a prize that includes chef training from leading professional chefs, the chance to have their own [[cookbook]] published, and [[A$]]250,000 in cash.\n\n===Episodes===\n''MasterChef Australia'' airs five nights a week from Sunday to Thursday. Each night features a different episode format, however some episodes modify the format slightly. The typical episode formats are as follows:\n\n'''Sunday''' is the ''Challenge'' night. From series 3, it can range from a variety of challenges, including a Mystery Box, where each contestant is given the same box of ingredients and are to create a dish using only those ingredients. The Judges then pick 3 dishes Based on Technique and Visual Appearance Alone and a winner chosen. There can also be an Invention Test, where contestants have to invent a dish relevant to a theme using a core ingredient. There can also be Off-Site Challenges and Team Challenges, which often involve cooking for large numbers of people. The top three contestants who made the best dishes are selected by the judges, from which a winner is chosen to compete in the Immunity Challenge. After this the bottom three are revealed, who will face off in an elimination challenge the next night. In the first two series, it would always consist of a Mystery Box, where the winner was able to choose the core ingredient for the Invention Test.\n\n'''Monday''' episodes feature the ''Pressure Test''. The bottom three from the previous night's challenge are given a recipe for a particular dish they are to emulate in an allocated time. Once completed they are taken in to the judges to be tasted, before all three contestants are seated in front of the judges for critiquing. The judges then eliminate the contestant out of the three that performed least adequately in the test.\n\n'''Tuesday''' episodes feature the ''Immunity Challenge'', where the winner of the Sunday challenge competes against a guest, which can vary from a chef, apprentice, or to a home cook in a cook off. The contestant is given the choice of two pantries of ingredients they can use, usually contrasting such as \"Black\" and \"White\". The contestant gets a head start to complete the dish before their opponent starts cooking and after the allotted time for both is finished, the dishes are presented to the judges for tasting and scoring out of ten. The judges are not aware which dish was made by which person, however. If the contestant's dish's score is equal to or higher than that of the guest, they are crowned the winner of the challenge. In the first series they are given a free pass to the finals week of the competition and can go home. From series 2 onwards, they receive a pin that allows them to save themselves from one future elimination.\n\n'''Wednesday''' features a ''Team Challenge''. The contestants are split into teams, and are given a task, and a set amount of time to complete the challenge. Tasks have included presenting a three course meal to a celebrity guest, running a restaurant for an evening or catering an event such as a birthday party or wedding. Once completed and judged the teams are given the results, which can be determined by which team the judges think did the best, or receiving the most votes or making the most money by the people the teams had to cook for, with members of the losing team facing an elimination the next night. The winning team safe from elimination receives a reward (for example lunch at a top restaurant).\n\n'''Thursday''' is another ''Elimination''. The two worst performing contestants from the losing team in the team challenge compete against each other in a head to head challenge to determine who will be eliminated. The loser of the challenge is then eliminated. On some occasions, all members of the losing team will be selected to compete as individuals in the elimination challenge. In the first series, a different elimination process was used. The contestants from the losing team were to vote for a contestant that they each feel did not perform to their best and may have cost them the challenge. After voting the team is called in together to announce the results of the vote, with the contestant with the most votes being eliminated from the competition. If the previous challenge was an individual challenge, the bottom two contestants competed in a head to head taste test where one contestant at a time named one ingredient of a particular dish or sauce, and the first person to name an incorrect ingredient is eliminated. ''MasterClass'' airs on Thursday following the elimination show and is generally limited to themed weeks. Here, judges George, Gary and Matt run a masterclass for the remaining contestants, which usually call back to some of the challenges from the previous week. For example, they may revisit the Mystery Box challenge and demonstrate some other dishes that could have been made or redo one of the contestants' dishes to give tips on how it could have been improved.\n\n==Hosts and judges==\n===Main series===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+ Timeline of hosts, judges and other personnel\n!

It is produced by [[Shine Australia]] and screens on [[Network 10]]. Restaurateur and chef [[Gary Mehigan]], chef [[George Calombaris]] and food critic [[Matt Preston]] served as the show's main judges until 2019, when they were replaced by [[MasterChef Australia (series 4)|Series 4]] winner and chef [[Andy Allen (chef)|Andy Allen]], food critic Melissa Leong, and restaurateur and chef [[Jock Zonfrillo]].\n\nThe series has also spawned four spin-off series: ''[[Celebrity MasterChef Australia]]'', which featured celebrity contestants,<ref name=\"celeb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25791148-661,00.html|title=Herald Sun|work=news.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> ''[[Junior MasterChef Australia]]'', which featured younger contestants,<ref name=\"jmc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,26269545-5003422,00.html|title=The Courier Mail|work=news.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> ''[[MasterChef Australia All-Stars]]'', which featured returning contestants from the first three series,<ref name=\"allstars\" /> and ''[[MasterChef Australia: The Professionals]]'', which featured professional chefs as contestants.<ref name=\"prof\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2012/10/masterchef-the-professionals-vs-my-kitchen-rules.html|title=MasterChef: The Professionals vs My Kitchen Rules?|date=29 October 2012|work=tvtonight.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref> These spin-off shows did not air in 2014 after the producers of the show announced that they wanted to solely focus on the original version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/09/masterchef-sticks-to-one-series-for-2014.html|title=MasterChef sticks to one series for 2014|date=31 August 2013|work=tvtonight.com.au|accessdate=25 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\n''MasterChef Australia'' has a different format from that of the original British ''[[MasterChef (UK TV series)|MasterChef]]'' and ''MasterChef Goes Large'' formats. Initial rounds consist of a large number of hopeful contestants from across Australia individually \"auditioning\" by presenting a food dish before the three judges in order to gain one of 50 semi-final places. Entrants must be over 18 years old and their main source of income cannot come from preparing and cooking fresh food in a professional environment.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Knox|title=Auditions: Masterchef|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2008/12/auditions-masterchef.html|publisher=tvtonight.com.au|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=12 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe semi-finalists then compete in several challenges that test their food knowledge and preparation skills. In Season 1, the top 50 competed until 20 were left, with the final 20 progressing to the main stage of the show. From Season 2, 24 contestants progress. The contestants will then be whittled down through a number of individual and team-based cooking challenges and weekly elimination rounds until a winning MasterChef is crowned. The winner plays for a prize that includes chef training from leading professional chefs, the chance to have their own [[cookbook]] published, and [[A$]]250,000 in cash.\n\n===Episodes===\n''MasterChef Australia'' airs five nights a week from Sunday to Thursday. Each night features a different episode format, however some episodes modify the format slightly. The typical episode formats are as follows:\n\n'''Sunday''' is the ''Challenge'' night. From series 3, it can range from a variety of challenges, including a Mystery Box, where each contestant is given the same box of ingredients and are to create a dish using only those ingredients. The Judges then pick 3 dishes Based on Technique and Visual Appearance Alone and a winner chosen. There can also be an Invention Test, where contestants have to invent a dish relevant to a theme using a core ingredient. There can also be Off-Site Challenges and Team Challenges, which often involve cooking for large numbers of people. The top three contestants who made the best dishes are selected by the judges, from which a winner is chosen to compete in the Immunity Challenge. After this the bottom three are revealed, who will face off in an elimination challenge the next night. In the first two series, it would always consist of a Mystery Box, where the winner was able to choose the core ingredient for the Invention Test.\n\n'''Monday''' episodes feature the ''Pressure Test''. The bottom three from the previous night's challenge are given a recipe for a particular dish they are to emulate in an allocated time. Once completed they are taken in to the judges to be tasted, before all three contestants are seated in front of the judges for critiquing. The judges then eliminate the contestant out of the three that performed least adequately in the test.\n\n'''Tuesday''' episodes feature the ''Immunity Challenge'', where the winner of the Sunday challenge competes against a guest, which can vary from a chef, apprentice, or to a home cook in a cook off. The contestant is given the choice of two pantries of ingredients they can use, usually contrasting such as \"Black\" and \"White\". The contestant gets a head start to complete the dish before their opponent starts cooking and after the allotted time for both is finished, the dishes are presented to the judges for tasting and scoring out of ten. The judges are not aware which dish was made by which person, however. If the contestant's dish's score is equal to or higher than that of the guest, they are crowned the winner of the challenge. In the first series they are given a free pass to the finals week of the competition and can go home. From series 2 onwards, they receive a pin that allows them to save themselves from one future elimination.\n\n'''Wednesday''' features a ''Team Challenge''. The contestants are split into teams, and are given a task, and a set amount of time to complete the challenge. Tasks have included presenting a three course meal to a celebrity guest, running a restaurant for an evening or catering an event such as a birthday party or wedding. Once completed and judged the teams are given the results, which can be determined by which team the judges think did the best, or receiving the most votes or making the most money by the people the teams had to cook for, with members of the losing team facing an elimination the next night. The winning team safe from elimination receives a reward (for example lunch at a top restaurant).\n\n'''Thursday''' is another ''Elimination''. The two worst performing contestants from the losing team in the team challenge compete against each other in a head to head challenge to determine who will be eliminated. The loser of the challenge is then eliminated. On some occasions, all members of the losing team will be selected to compete as individuals in the elimination challenge. In the first series, a different elimination process was used. The contestants from the losing team were to vote for a contestant that they each feel did not perform to their best and may have cost them the challenge. After voting the team is called in together to announce the results of the vote, with the contestant with the most votes being eliminated from the competition. If the previous challenge was an individual challenge, the bottom two contestants competed in a head to head taste test where one contestant at a time named one ingredient of a particular dish or sauce, and the first person to name an incorrect ingredient is eliminated. ''MasterClass'' airs on Thursday following the elimination show and is generally limited to themed weeks. Here, judges George, Gary and Matt run a masterclass for the remaining contestants, which usually call back to some of the challenges from the previous week. For example, they may revisit the Mystery Box challenge and demonstrate some other dishes that could have been made or redo one of the contestants' dishes to give tips on how it could have been improved.\n\n==Hosts and judges==\n===Main series===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+ Timeline of hosts, judges and other personnel\n!

After emigrating to France in the early 1920s, he worked on some notable French films of the late silent cinema and the early 1930s, particularly those of [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]] and [[Jacques Feyder]]. He worked in England during the last two years of his life. He had great influence on film set design in France in the years before World War II.\n\n==Career==\n===Early life===\nLazare Meerson was born in Warsaw, which in 1900 was part of the [[Russian Empire]].<ref>Most sources (e.g. [http://cinema.encyclopedie.personnalites.bifi.fr/index.php?pk=29286&_ga=1.101153857.1578655882.1484655467 Cin\u00e9-Ressources]) give Warsaw as Meerson's place of birth. [[Richard Roud]] however recorded that he was born in [[Karelia]] which in 1900 was a part of Czarist Russia bordering on Finland (in ''A Passion for Films: Henri Langlois et la Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que fran\u00e7aise''. London: Secker & Warburg, 1983. p. 42).</ref> He may have begun studying painting and architecture in Russia, but after the revolution of 1917 he moved to Germany and by 1919 he had registered as an art student in Berlin. While in Berlin he gained some experience of designing for the theatre, before leaving for Paris in 1923 or 1924.<ref name=\"bergfelder62\">Tim Bergfelder, Sue Harris, Sarah Street.

By 1926 Meerson was appointed head of design at Albatros, and during the next three years he was responsible for the art direction on ten films. He formed particularly fruitful partnerships with  [[Jacques Feyder]] (on ''Gribiche'', ''[[Carmen (1926 film)|Carmen]]'', and ''[[The New Gentlemen|Les Nouveaux Messieurs]]'') and with [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]] (on ''[[The Prey of the Wind|La Proie du vent]]'', ''[[The Italian Straw Hat (film)|Un chapeau de paille d'Italie]]'', and ''[[Two Timid Souls|Les Deux Timides]]'').<ref name=\"bergfelder62\" />\n\nIn several of his set designs of the 1920s, Meerson employed a 'restrained modernism', as in the spacious art-deco home of the wealthy Mme Maranet in ''Gribiche'', or the architectural interior of a dancer's apartment, with its big white surfaces and sparse ornaments in ''Les Nouveaux Messieurs'', or the sumptuous premises of the banker Saccard in ''[[L'Argent (1928 film)|L'Argent]]'', in which the large open spaces facilitated long camera movements and the complex interplay of light and shadow.<ref>\"Lazare Meerson\" in [http://1895.revues.org/97#tocto1n5 ''Dictionnaire du cin\u00e9ma des ann\u00e9es vingt''], in ''1895'', vol. 33 (2001).</ref> Meerson, in 1927, said of his work: \"It is an art of self-denial. The designer should constantly conceal himself before the other elements of the production. The frame should never encroach upon the work itself. The setting harmonises with the film. Released from it is that atmosphere which is so important both to the director and to the performers.\"<ref>Quoted in ''Dictionnaire du cin\u00e9ma fran\u00e7ais''; sous la direction de Jean-Loup Passek. Paris: Larousse, 1987. p. 293: \"C'est un art d'abn\u00e9gation. Le d\u00e9corateur doit s'\u00e9ffacer constamment devant les autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la r\u00e9alisation. Jamais le cadre ne doit empi\u00e9ter sur l'\u0153uvre elle-m\u00eame. Le d\u00e9cor s'harmonise avec le film. C'est de lui que se d\u00e9gage l'atmosph\u00e8re si pr\u00e9cieuse au metteur en sc\u00e8ne comme aux interpr\u00e8tes.\"</ref>\n\nWith the end of the period of silent films, Lazare Meerson moved with Ren\u00e9 Clair to Films Sonores Tobis at \u00c9pinay-sur-Seine, where he was appointed ''chef-d\u00e9corateur'' (head of design). Together Clair and Meerson worked on four of the most influential early sound films of French cinema, starting with ''[[Under the Roofs of Paris|Sous les toits de Paris]]'' (1930). These films created an image of Paris which came to be seen by the world as quintessential, filled with picturesque urban neighbourhoods and easily recognisable 'types' of character, stylised in presentation and already anachronistic.<ref>''Dictionnaire du cin\u00e9ma populaire fran\u00e7ais''; sous la direction de Christian-Marc Buss\u00e9no & Yannick Deh\u00e9e. Paris: Nouveau Monde, 2004. p. 720.</ref> Meerson's designs moved away from the monumental architectural sets which had characterised some 1920s productions, to favour a more intimate and painterly style which employed realistic detail and the play of lighting to create atmosphere.<ref>Dudley Andrews. ''Mists of Regret: Culture and Sensibility in Classic French Film''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1995. pp. 179-182.</ref><ref name=\"bergfelder62\" /> [[Marcel Carn\u00e9]] praised the impact of these artificial film sets, when created by filmmakers of talent: \"If it is true that we would swear we had met in the street, in the course of our daily life, the varied characters of ''Sous les toits de Paris'' or of ''14 Juillet'', it is no less true that we would also swear we had suddenly found ourselves, while happily wandering around the city suburbs one day, face to face with one of the popular streets invented by Meerson. The blind-alley of the street singers, the dark lane which runs beside the Petite Ceinture railway, the little square for the dance in ''14 Juillet'', even though we know they are entirely constructed, they move us with their unrestrained authenticity, even more perhaps than if Clair and his team had actually taken us to the real locations of the story.\"<ref>Marcel Carn\u00e9, \"Quand le cin\u00e9ma descendra-t-il dans la rue?\", in ''Cin\u00e9magazine'', vol. 13 (11), novembre 1933, pp. 12-14: \"S'il est vrai que nous jurerions avoir rencontr\u00e9 dans la rue, au cours de notre existence quotidienne, les divers personnages de ''Sous les toits de Paris'' ou de ''14 Juillet'', il est non moins exact que nous jurerions pareillement nous \u00eatre trouv\u00e9 soudain, un jour de fl\u00e2nerie heureuse dans les faubourgs, face \u00e0 face avec une des rues populaires imagin\u00e9es par Meerson. L'impasse aux chanteurs, la ruelle obscure que borde le chemin de fer de Petite Ceinture dans ''Sous les toits de Paris''; la rue en escaliers, la petite place du bal dans ''14 Juillet'', quoique nous les sachions fabriqu\u00e9es de toutes pi\u00e8ces, nous \u00e9meuvent par leur errante authenticit\u00e9, peut-\u00eatre davantage que si Clair et sa troupe s'\u00e9taient vraiment transport\u00e9s sur les lieux m\u00eames de l'action.\"</ref>\n\nWhen Jacques Feyder returned to France in 1933 after spending several years in Hollywood, he renewed his working relationship with Meerson on three sound films in France. Their partnership reached its peak with ''[[Carnival in Flanders (film)|La Kermesse h\u00e9ro\u00efque]]'' in 1935, for which Meerson created, in a suburban Paris studio, the 16th century Flemish town of Boom, with its streets, canals, public buildings and house interiors making reference to the paintings of Brueghel, Hals, and de Hoogh.<ref>Georges Sadoul. ''Dictionnaire des films''. Paris: Seuil, 1983. p. 165.</ref> Even in this historical context, he sought to combine realism with stylization: \"Here Meerson put to the test all his experiments using iron, glass, and oil paint on a large scale, and he found ingenious ways to adapt parts of the studio factory to give his fantasies ballast. Here he achieved that balance between authenticity and the imaginary that was his goal and trademark and that would set the tone for the work of his many disciples\".<ref>Dudley Andrews. ''Mists of Regret: Culture and Sensibility in Classic French Film''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1995. p. 184.</ref>\nIn addition to his film work at this period, Meerson also undertook other design projects such as the refurbishment of the Paris home of Jacques Feyder and Fran\u00e7oise Rosay,<ref name=\"bergfelder62\" /> and the creation of murals for the [[Monte Carlo Casino|Casino]] in Monte Carlo.<ref name=\"cineressources\" />\n\n===In England===\nIn 1936 Lazare Meerson moved to England, first at the invitation of [[Paul Czinner]] to work on a film of ''[[As You Like It (1936 film)|As You Like It]]'', and then joining [[Alexander Korda]] at London Films for a further six films, commencing with ''[[Fire Over England]]''. Most of these were made at Korda's newly-built [[Denham Film Studios]], whose huge resources initially impressed Meerson; subsequently however he began to have reservations about working for such a big studio with its Hollywood-style methods, and he missed the more intimate scale and personal relationships of his French productions.<ref>Sarah Street, \"Sets of the imagination: Lazare Meerson, set design and performance in ''Knight Without Armour'' (1937)\", in ''Journal of British Cinema and Television'', vol. 2, no. 1 (2005), p. 23.</ref> \nWhile he was working on the sets for ''[[The Citadel (1938 film)|The Citadel]]'' in 1938, Meerson contracted meningitis and died suddenly, shortly before his 38th birthday. Among those who attended his funeral were Ren\u00e9 Clair and Jacques Feyder. \n\n==Reputation and influence==\nShortly after his death the director [[Alberto Cavalcanti]] wrote a tribute to Meerson in which he highlighted  his personal qualities as a loyal and adaptable collaborator. He was described as \"quiet, even taciturn; dependable, brilliant when brilliance was required, but having none of the instability which so often goes with brilliance.\"<ref>Alberto Cavalcanti, \"Lazare Meerson\", in ''Sight & Sound'', vol. 7, no. 26 (Summer 1938) pp. 64-65.</ref>\n\nAmong the assistants or trainees who worked with Meerson on his French films during the 1930s were [[Alexandre Trauner]], [[Jean d'Eaubonne]] and [[Georges Wakh\u00e9vitch]]; they absorbed many of his ideas and their subsequent work in films saw the flowering of a style which has been given the label of [[poetic realism]].<ref name=\"cineressources\">[http://cinema.encyclopedie.personnalites.bifi.fr/index.php?pk=29286&_ga=1.203822032.1578655882.1484655467 \"Lazare Meerson\"] at ''Cin\u00e9-Ressources''. [In French] Retrieved 20 January 2017.</ref>\nMeerson's influence upon the development of film set design was considerable. His personal style, marked by his Russian background and his experiences in Berlin, encouraged several trends in the cinema including that of poetic realism. His use of natural materials in the construction of sets, his carefully researched scenic recreations and his inventive use of false perspectives, always personally supervised at every stage of the work, established new standards in the art of film design.<ref>R.F.

After emigrating to France in the early 1920s, he worked on some notable French films of the late silent cinema and the early 1930s, particularly those of [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]] and [[Jacques Feyder]]. He worked in England during the last two years of his life. He had great influence on film set design in France in the years before World War II.\n\n==Career==\n===Early life===\nLazare Meerson was born in Warsaw, which in 1900 was part of the [[Russian Empire]].<ref>Most sources (e.g. [http://cinema.encyclopedie.personnalites.bifi.fr/index.php?pk=29286&_ga=1.101153857.1578655882.1484655467 Cin\u00e9-Ressources]) give Warsaw as Meerson's place of birth. [[Richard Roud]] however recorded that he was born in [[Karelia]] which in 1900 was a part of Czarist Russia bordering on Finland (in ''A Passion for Films: Henri Langlois et la Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que fran\u00e7aise''. London: Secker & Warburg, 1983. p. 42).</ref> He may have begun studying painting and architecture in Russia, but after the revolution of 1917 he moved to Germany and by 1919 he had registered as an art student in Berlin. While in Berlin he gained some experience of designing for the theatre, before leaving for Paris in 1923 or 1924.<ref name=\"bergfelder62\">Tim Bergfelder, Sue Harris, Sarah Street.

By 1926 Meerson was appointed head of design at Albatros, and during the next three years he was responsible for the art direction on ten films. He formed particularly fruitful partnerships with  [[Jacques Feyder]] (on ''Gribiche'', ''[[Carmen (1926 film)|Carmen]]'', and ''[[The New Gentlemen|Les Nouveaux Messieurs]]'') and with [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]] (on ''[[The Prey of the Wind|La Proie du vent]]'', ''[[The Italian Straw Hat (film)|Un chapeau de paille d'Italie]]'', and ''[[Two Timid Souls|Les Deux Timides]]'').<ref name=\"bergfelder62\" />\n\nIn several of his set designs of the 1920s, Meerson employed a 'restrained modernism', as in the spacious art-deco home of the wealthy Mme Maranet in ''Gribiche'', or the architectural interior of a dancer's apartment, with its big white surfaces and sparse ornaments in ''Les Nouveaux Messieurs'', or the sumptuous premises of the banker Saccard in ''[[L'Argent (1928 film)|L'Argent]]'', in which the large open spaces facilitated long camera movements and the complex interplay of light and shadow.<ref>\"Lazare Meerson\" in [http://1895.revues.org/97#tocto1n5 ''Dictionnaire du cin\u00e9ma des ann\u00e9es vingt''], in ''1895'', vol. 33 (2001).</ref> Meerson, in 1927, said of his work: \"It is an art of self-denial. The designer should constantly conceal himself before the other elements of the production. The frame should never encroach upon the work itself. The setting harmonises with the film. Released from it is that atmosphere which is so important both to the director and to the performers.\"<ref>Quoted in ''Dictionnaire du cin\u00e9ma fran\u00e7ais''; sous la direction de Jean-Loup Passek. Paris: Larousse, 1987. p. 293: \"C'est un art d'abn\u00e9gation. Le d\u00e9corateur doit s'\u00e9ffacer constamment devant les autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la r\u00e9alisation. Jamais le cadre ne doit empi\u00e9ter sur l'\u0153uvre elle-m\u00eame. Le d\u00e9cor s'harmonise avec le film. C'est de lui que se d\u00e9gage l'atmosph\u00e8re si pr\u00e9cieuse au metteur en sc\u00e8ne comme aux interpr\u00e8tes.\"</ref>\n\nWith the end of the period of silent films, Lazare Meerson moved with Ren\u00e9 Clair to Films Sonores Tobis at \u00c9pinay-sur-Seine, where he was appointed ''chef-d\u00e9corateur'' (head of design). Together Clair and Meerson worked on four of the most influential early sound films of French cinema, starting with ''[[Under the Roofs of Paris|Sous les toits de Paris]]'' (1930). These films created an image of Paris which came to be seen by the world as quintessential, filled with picturesque urban neighbourhoods and easily recognisable 'types' of character, stylised in presentation and already anachronistic.<ref>''Dictionnaire du cin\u00e9ma populaire fran\u00e7ais''; sous la direction de Christian-Marc Buss\u00e9no & Yannick Deh\u00e9e. Paris: Nouveau Monde, 2004. p. 720.</ref> Meerson's designs moved away from the monumental architectural sets which had characterised some 1920s productions, to favour a more intimate and painterly style which employed realistic detail and the play of lighting to create atmosphere.<ref>Dudley Andrews. ''Mists of Regret: Culture and Sensibility in Classic French Film''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1995. pp. 179-182.</ref><ref name=\"bergfelder62\" /> [[Marcel Carn\u00e9]] praised the impact of these artificial film sets, when created by filmmakers of talent: \"If it is true that we would swear we had met in the street, in the course of our daily life, the varied characters of ''Sous les toits de Paris'' or of ''14 Juillet'', it is no less true that we would also swear we had suddenly found ourselves, while happily wandering around the city suburbs one day, face to face with one of the popular streets invented by Meerson. The blind-alley of the street singers, the dark lane which runs beside the Petite Ceinture railway, the little square for the dance in ''14 Juillet'', even though we know they are entirely constructed, they move us with their unrestrained authenticity, even more perhaps than if Clair and his team had actually taken us to the real locations of the story.\"<ref>Marcel Carn\u00e9, \"Quand le cin\u00e9ma descendra-t-il dans la rue?\", in ''Cin\u00e9magazine'', vol. 13 (11), novembre 1933, pp. 12-14: \"S'il est vrai que nous jurerions avoir rencontr\u00e9 dans la rue, au cours de notre existence quotidienne, les divers personnages de ''Sous les toits de Paris'' ou de ''14 Juillet'', il est non moins exact que nous jurerions pareillement nous \u00eatre trouv\u00e9 soudain, un jour de fl\u00e2nerie heureuse dans les faubourgs, face \u00e0 face avec une des rues populaires imagin\u00e9es par Meerson. L'impasse aux chanteurs, la ruelle obscure que borde le chemin de fer de Petite Ceinture dans ''Sous les toits de Paris''; la rue en escaliers, la petite place du bal dans ''14 Juillet'', quoique nous les sachions fabriqu\u00e9es de toutes pi\u00e8ces, nous \u00e9meuvent par leur errante authenticit\u00e9, peut-\u00eatre davantage que si Clair et sa troupe s'\u00e9taient vraiment transport\u00e9s sur les lieux m\u00eames de l'action.\"</ref>\n\nWhen Jacques Feyder returned to France in 1933 after spending several years in Hollywood, he renewed his working relationship with Meerson on three sound films in France. Their partnership reached its peak with ''[[Carnival in Flanders (film)|La Kermesse h\u00e9ro\u00efque]]'' in 1935, for which Meerson created, in a suburban Paris studio, the 16th century Flemish town of Boom, with its streets, canals, public buildings and house interiors making reference to the paintings of Brueghel, Hals, and de Hoogh.<ref>Georges Sadoul. ''Dictionnaire des films''. Paris: Seuil, 1983. p. 165.</ref> Even in this historical context, he sought to combine realism with stylization: \"Here Meerson put to the test all his experiments using iron, glass, and oil paint on a large scale, and he found ingenious ways to adapt parts of the studio factory to give his fantasies ballast. Here he achieved that balance between authenticity and the imaginary that was his goal and trademark and that would set the tone for the work of his many disciples\".<ref>Dudley Andrews. ''Mists of Regret: Culture and Sensibility in Classic French Film''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1995. p. 184.</ref>\nIn addition to his film work at this period, Meerson also undertook other design projects such as the refurbishment of the Paris home of Jacques Feyder and Fran\u00e7oise Rosay,<ref name=\"bergfelder62\" /> and the creation of murals for the [[Monte Carlo Casino|Casino]] in Monte Carlo.<ref name=\"cineressources\" />\n\n===In England===\nIn 1936 Lazare Meerson moved to England, first at the invitation of [[Paul Czinner]] to work on a film of ''[[As You Like It (1936 film)|As You Like It]]'', and then joining [[Alexander Korda]] at London Films for a further six films, commencing with ''[[Fire Over England]]''. Most of these were made at Korda's newly-built [[Denham Film Studios]], whose huge resources initially impressed Meerson; subsequently however he began to have reservations about working for such a big studio with its Hollywood-style methods, and he missed the more intimate scale and personal relationships of his French productions.<ref>Sarah Street, \"Sets of the imagination: Lazare Meerson, set design and performance in ''Knight Without Armour'' (1937)\", in ''Journal of British Cinema and Television'', vol. 2, no. 1 (2005), p. 23.</ref> \nWhile he was working on the sets for ''[[The Citadel (1938 film)|The Citadel]]'' in 1938, Meerson contracted meningitis and died suddenly, shortly before his 38th birthday. Among those who attended his funeral were Ren\u00e9 Clair and Jacques Feyder. \n\n==Reputation and influence==\nShortly after his death the director [[Alberto Cavalcanti]] wrote a tribute to Meerson in which he highlighted  his personal qualities as a loyal and adaptable collaborator. He was described as \"quiet, even taciturn; dependable, brilliant when brilliance was required, but having none of the instability which so often goes with brilliance.\"<ref>Alberto Cavalcanti, \"Lazare Meerson\", in ''Sight & Sound'', vol. 7, no. 26 (Summer 1938) pp. 64-65.</ref>\n\nAmong the assistants or trainees who worked with Meerson on his French films during the 1930s were [[Alexandre Trauner]], [[Jean d'Eaubonne]] and [[Georges Wakh\u00e9vitch]]; they absorbed many of his ideas and their subsequent work in films saw the flowering of a style which has been given the label of [[poetic realism]].<ref name=\"cineressources\">[http://cinema.encyclopedie.personnalites.bifi.fr/index.php?pk=29286&_ga=1.203822032.1578655882.1484655467 \"Lazare Meerson\"] at ''Cin\u00e9-Ressources''. [In French] Retrieved 20 January 2017.</ref>\nMeerson's influence upon the development of film set design was considerable. His personal style, marked by his Russian background and his experiences in Berlin, encouraged several trends in the cinema including that of poetic realism. His use of natural materials in the construction of sets, his carefully researched scenic recreations and his inventive use of false perspectives, always personally supervised at every stage of the work, established new standards in the art of film design.<ref>R.F.
