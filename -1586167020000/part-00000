However, the academic year will be resumed in August 2020, which means their graduation will be delayed.\n\nFurthermore, getting a sponsored scholarships to study in universities, will also be delayed due to the same reasons.\n\n'''Economics''':\n\nThe strategic planning and surplus for food and supplies is for six months. All supermarkets and grocery stores have all usual products as before the border closure or the imposed partial curfew.\n\nHowever, the small businesses are the most effected since they are losing a lot of money, and yet, have to pay rent / salaries to their workers. The government have promised packages and solutions to ensure these businesses are compensated for these unfortunate circumstances with the partial lockdown / forced closures.\n\n'''People''':\n\nThe measures made by the Kuwaiti government are world class. All the Kuwaities and non-Kuwaities are appreciative of the efforts that was put in place to ensure the control of the coronavirus. However, there is a sense of rush in buying supplies in non curfew hours ('''4 Am to 5 PM'''), even though the Kuwaiti government have reiterated that goods and supplies are for six months.\n\nThe partial lockdown, staying at home and social distancing has caused boredom for the majority, as cinemas, malls, department stores entertainment venues/ places ....etc., are shut and closed. Normal things like exercising in the gym, or eating outside people homes, suddenly unacceptable, shut and closed due to the coronavirus.\n\n''The full physiological effects for the partial lockdown and curfew are yet to be determined.''\n\n==Timeline==\n===February===\nOn 24 February, Kuwaiti Ministry of Health announced that there were 3 cases detected coming from [[Iran]] that carry [[coronavirus disease 2019]].

Simultaneously, between 1972\u201374, he was a consultant to the Indian Planning Commission and it was around this time that he began writing articles as a journalist, criticising economic policy.{{sfn|International Press Institute|ps=}}\n\n=== Journalism ===\nIn 1975, during [[The Emergency (India)|The Emergency]] imposed by then prime minister, [[Indira Gandhi]], Shourie began writing for the ''[[Indian Express]]'' in opposition to what he saw as an attack on civil liberties. The newspaper, owned by [[Ramnath Goenka]], was a focal point for the government's efforts at censorship.{{sfn|International Press Institute|ps=}} He became a fellow of the [[Indian Council of Social Science Research]] in 1976.{{sfnp|Magsaysay Foundation|2012|ps=}} In January 1979, Goenka appointed Shourie as executive editor of the newspaper, giving him a ''carte blanche'' to do with it as he saw fit.{{sfn|International Press Institute|ps=}} He developed a reputation as an intelligent, fearless writer and editor who campaigned for freedom of the press, exposed corruption and defended civil liberties such that, in the words of [[Martha Nussbaum]], \"his dedication to the truth has won admiration throughout the political spectrum\".{{sfnp|Nussbaum|2009|p=61|ps=}}\n\nShourie has been called a \"veteran journalist\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Remaking India: One Country, One Destiny|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRVtyruwoIgC&pg=PA25&dq=arun+shourie+|page=25|publisher=SAGE Publications|author=Arun Maira}}</ref><ref>http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/arun-shouries-speech-on-media-freedom-at-press-club-of-india-full-transcript-1710491</ref> Shourie was a winner of the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1982, in the Journalism, Literature and Creative Communication Arts category as \"a concerned citizen employing his pen as an effective adversary of corruption, inequality and injustice.\"{{sfnp|Magsaysay Foundation|2012|ps=}} In 2000, he was named as one of the [[International Press Institute]]'s ''[[World Press Freedom Heroes]]''.

Claimed by the government to be a reinforcement of India's constitutional secularism, it was widely criticised by both Muslims and Hindus. The liberals among them, says [[Ainslie Embree]], saw it as \"a capitulation to the forces of Islamic obscurantism, a return&nbsp;... to the thirteenth century\"; the Hindu revivalist critics thought it was \"weakening Indian unity\". Shourie wrote articles that tried to show that the treatment of women as required by the Quran would in fact offer them protection, although the application of Islamic law in practice was oppressing them. He was in turn criticised for what was perceived as a thinly-veiled attack on Islam itself, with [[Rafiq Zakaria]], the Muslim scholar, saying that Shourie's concern for reform of Islam was in fact demonstrative of Hindu contempt that used the plight of Muslim women as an example of the backwardness of the community. [[Vir Sanghvi]] termed it \"Hindu chauvinism with a liberal face\".{{sfnp|Embree|1990|pp=107-111|ps=}}\n\nAfter the defeat of the BJP in 2009 general elections, Shourie asked for introspection and accountability within the party. He deplored factionalism within the party and those who brief journalists to aid their own agenda.{{sfnp|Indian Express|2009|ps=}}\n\nShourie has been described by [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], a political scientist, as \"a writer sympathetic to militant Hindu themes\"{{sfnp|Jaffrelot|1996|p=353|ps=}} and has publicly voiced support for the aims of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), a nationalist [[Hindutva]] organisation. This has caused unease among some of those who admire his journalism.{{sfnp|Nussbaum|2009|p=62|ps=}} He has said that, although he sees a danger from perceived Muslim violence such as the [[Godhra train burning]] incident of 2002, people have tended to redefine the \"Hindutva\" term. He says that prominent members of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), of which he is a member and which has ties to the RSS&nbsp;\u2014 specifically, [[L. K. Advani]] and [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]]&nbsp;\u2014  have shown their opposition to sectarian hatred and in their attempts to make the BJP inclusive have tried to marginalise those on both the Muslim and Hindu extremes who promote such hatred.{{sfnp|Nussbaum|2009|pp=66-68|ps=}}As a political scientist he views that current leaders lack competency and integrity. He emphasised his views in a cultural conference called [[Tomorrow\u2019s India Global Summit]] and added that the pressure to bring about change in the present electoral system should come from the society.<ref>https://www.firstpost.com/politics/arun-shourie-says-pressure-to-change-electoral-system-should-come-from-society-4122739.html</ref>\n\n=== Writer ===\nArun Shourie has written numerous books. According to [[Martha Nussbaum]], the traits of his writings are: {{quote|recognisably the creation of a smart, determined, muckraking journalist, They are polemical, ad hominem, often extremely shrill in tone.&nbsp;... But despite their style, the books are obviously the work of a brilliant man, with a wide if idiosyncratic learning, a passion for the freedoms of speech and press, and a desire to get beneath current events to address underlying issues.{{sfnp|Nussbaum|2009|p=62|ps=}}}}\n\nHis writings have gained him a considerable following. They were initially on a diverse range of subjects related to his journalistic interests, including corruption{{clarify | date = July 2015 | reason = The sentence does not make sense. What do corruption against B.R. Ambedkar and left-wing historians mean?}} and polemics against left-wing historians.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} He subsequently concentrated his polemicism mostly on issues relating to the detrimental effects of religion on society, producing critiques of Christianity, Hinduism{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} and Islam. With the exception of [[Gandhi]], he has little time for any religious thinker and, says Nussbaum, his books \"nowhere&nbsp;... seek to provide balance; nowhere is there a sense of complexity. All have the same mocking, superior tone.\"{{sfnp|Nussbaum|2009|p=63|ps=}}\n\nHistorian [[Dwijendra Narayan Jha|D.N.

The newspaper, owned by [[Ramnath Goenka]], was a focal point for the government's efforts at censorship.{{sfn|International Press Institute|ps=}} He became a fellow of the [[Indian Council of Social Science Research]] in 1976.{{sfnp|Magsaysay Foundation|2012|ps=}} In January 1979, Goenka appointed Shourie as executive editor of the newspaper, giving him a ''carte blanche'' to do with it as he saw fit.{{sfn|International Press Institute|ps=}} He developed a reputation as an intelligent, fearless writer and editor who campaigned for freedom of the press, exposed corruption and defended civil liberties such that, in the words of [[Martha Nussbaum]], \"his dedication to the truth has won admiration throughout the political spectrum\".{{sfnp|Nussbaum|2009|p=61|ps=}}\n\nShourie has been called a \"veteran journalist\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Remaking India: One Country, One Destiny|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRVtyruwoIgC&pg=PA25&dq=arun+shourie+|page=25|publisher=SAGE Publications|author=Arun Maira}}</ref><ref>http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/arun-shouries-speech-on-media-freedom-at-press-club-of-india-full-transcript-1710491</ref> Shourie was a winner of the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1982, in the Journalism, Literature and Creative Communication Arts category as \"a concerned citizen employing his pen as an effective adversary of corruption, inequality and injustice.\"{{sfnp|Magsaysay Foundation|2012|ps=}} In 2000, he was named as one of the [[International Press Institute]]'s ''[[World Press Freedom Heroes]]''.

Claimed by the government to be a reinforcement of India's constitutional secularism, it was widely criticised by both Muslims and Hindus. The liberals among them, says [[Ainslie Embree]], saw it as \"a capitulation to the forces of Islamic obscurantism, a return&nbsp;... to the thirteenth century\"; the Hindu revivalist critics thought it was \"weakening Indian unity\". Shourie wrote articles that tried to show that the treatment of women as required by the Quran would in fact offer them protection, although the application of Islamic law in practice was oppressing them. He was in turn criticised for what was perceived as a thinly-veiled attack on Islam itself, with [[Rafiq Zakaria]], the Muslim scholar, saying that Shourie's concern for reform of Islam was in fact demonstrative of Hindu contempt that used the plight of Muslim women as an example of the backwardness of the community. [[Vir Sanghvi]] termed it \"Hindu chauvinism with a liberal face\".{{sfnp|Embree|1990|pp=107-111|ps=}}\n\nAfter the defeat of the BJP in 2009 general elections, Shourie asked for introspection and accountability within the party. He deplored factionalism within the party and those who brief journalists to aid their own agenda.{{sfnp|Indian Express|2009|ps=}}\n\nShourie has been described by [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], a political scientist, as \"a writer sympathetic to militant Hindu themes\"{{sfnp|Jaffrelot|1996|p=353|ps=}} and has publicly voiced support for the aims of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), a nationalist [[Hindutva]] organisation. This has caused unease among some of those who admire his journalism.{{sfnp|Nussbaum|2009|p=62|ps=}} He has said that, although he sees a danger from perceived Muslim violence such as the [[Godhra train burning]] incident of 2002, people have tended to redefine the \"Hindutva\" term. He says that prominent members of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), of which he is a member and which has ties to the RSS&nbsp;\u2014 specifically, [[L. K. Advani]] and [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]]&nbsp;\u2014  have shown their opposition to sectarian hatred and in their attempts to make the BJP inclusive have tried to marginalise those on both the Muslim and Hindu extremes who promote such hatred.{{sfnp|Nussbaum|2009|pp=66-68|ps=}}As a political scientist he views that current leaders lack competency and integrity. He emphasised his views in a cultural conference called [[Tomorrow\u2019s India Global Summit]] and added that the pressure to bring about change in the present electoral system should come from the society.<ref>https://www.firstpost.com/politics/arun-shourie-says-pressure-to-change-electoral-system-should-come-from-society-4122739.html</ref>\n\n=== Writer ===\nArun Shourie has written numerous books. According to [[Martha Nussbaum]], the traits of his writings are: {{quote|recognisably the creation of a smart, determined, muckraking journalist, They are polemical, ad hominem, often extremely shrill in tone.&nbsp;... But despite their style, the books are obviously the work of a brilliant man, with a wide if idiosyncratic learning, a passion for the freedoms of speech and press, and a desire to get beneath current events to address underlying issues.{{sfnp|Nussbaum|2009|p=62|ps=}}}}\n\nHis writings have gained him a considerable following. They were initially on a diverse range of subjects related to his journalistic interests, including corruption{{clarify | date = July 2015 | reason = The sentence does not make sense. What do corruption against B.R. Ambedkar and left-wing historians mean?}} and polemics against left-wing historians.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} He subsequently concentrated his polemicism mostly on issues relating to the detrimental effects of religion on society, producing critiques of Christianity, Hinduism{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} and Islam. With the exception of [[Gandhi]], he has little time for any religious thinker and, says Nussbaum, his books \"nowhere&nbsp;... seek to provide balance; nowhere is there a sense of complexity. All have the same mocking, superior tone.\"{{sfnp|Nussbaum|2009|p=63|ps=}}\n\nHistorian [[Dwijendra Narayan Jha|D.N.

The first and second [[tergum|tergae]] on the abdomen have bands of long silver [[setae]], that on the second tergum may either be interrupted or wavy. The sides of the second tergum are clothed in long silver setae. The tip of the abdomen and the rest of the body are covered with long black, straight setae, setae. The legs are largely covered in black setae, with a scattering of silver setae. There is some variation and in some specimens silver dominate setae dominates the hind legs, some males are completely black.

It is a parasitoid on various species of bunmble bees and is found in Europe, Asia and North Africa.\n\n==Description==\nThe males of ''Mutilla europaea'' are dark red on the apex of mandible and the thorax. The first and second [[tergum|tergae]] on the abdomen have bands of long silver [[setae]], that on the second tergum may either be interrupted or wavy. The sides of the second tergum are clothed in long silver setae. The tip of the abdomen and the rest of the body are covered with long black, straight setae, setae. The legs are largely covered in black setae, with a scattering of silver setae. There is some variation and in some specimens silver dominate setae dominates the hind legs, some males are completely black. In females the [[mesonotum]] is red, this sometimes extends to parts of the [[pronotum]]. The first tergum has a band of long silver setae, the remaining tergae are spotted with silver setae along their flanks, there can be close together.
