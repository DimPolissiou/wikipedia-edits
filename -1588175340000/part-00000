{"title_page": "Virus hoax", "text_new": "{{short description|Message warning the recipients of a non-existent computer virus threat}}\nA '''computer virus hoax''' is a message warning the recipients of a non-existent [[computer virus]] [[Threat (computer)|threat]]. The message is usually a [[chain e-mail]] that tells the recipients to forward it to everyone they know.\n\n==Identification==\nMost hoaxes are sensational in nature and easily identified by the fact that they indicate that the virus will do nearly impossible things, like blow up the recipient's computer and set it on fire, or less sensationally, delete everything on the user's computer. They often include fake announcements claimed to originate from reputable computer organizations together with mainstream news media. These bogus sources are quoted in order to give the hoax more credibility. Typically, the warnings use emotive language, stress the urgent nature of the threat and encourage readers to forward the message to other people as soon as possible.\n\nVirus hoaxes are usually harmless and accomplish nothing more than annoying people who identify it as a hoax and waste the time of people who forward the message. Nevertheless, a number of hoaxes have warned users that vital system files are viruses and encourage the user to delete the file, possibly damaging the system. Examples of this type include the [[jdbgmgr.exe virus hoax]] and the [[SULFNBK.EXE]] hoax.<ref name=\"jdbgmgr\">{{cite web|url = http://www.snopes.com/computer/virus/jdbgmgr.asp|title = JDBGMGR.EXE Virus|last = Mikkelson|first = Barbara and David P. |authorlink = |date=January 2008|accessdate = 2011-08-08}}</ref><ref name=\"sulfnbk\">{{cite web|url = http://www.snopes.com/computer/virus/sulfnbk.asp|title = SULFNBK.EXE Virus|last = Mikkelson|first = Barbara and David P. |authorlink = |date=January 2008|accessdate = 2011-08-08}}</ref>\n\nSome consider virus hoaxes and other chain e-mails to be a [[computer worm]] in and of themselves. They replicate by [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]]\u2014exploiting users' concern, ignorance, and disinclination to investigate before acting.\n\nHoaxes are distinct from computer pranks, which are harmless programs that perform unwanted and annoying actions on a computer, such as randomly moving the mouse, turning the screen display upside down, etc.\n\n==Action==\nAnti-virus specialists agree that recipients should delete virus hoaxes when they receive them, instead of forwarding them.<ref name=\"McAfee01Dec03\">{{cite web|url = https://home.mcafee.com/virusinfo/virusprofile.aspx?key=99121|title = Virus Profile: A Virtual Card For You Hoax|last = [[McAfee|McAfee, Inc]]|authorlink = |date=December 2003|accessdate = 2018-11-30}}</ref><ref name=\"F-Secure\">{{cite web|url = http://www.f-secure.com/virus-info/hoax/|title = Hoax Warnings|accessdate = 2012-06-14|last = [[F-Secure|F-Secure Corporation]]|year = 2009|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120622225329/http://www.f-secure.com/virus-info/hoax/|archive-date = 22 June 2012|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nMcAfee says:\n\n{{quotation|We are advising users who receive the email to delete it and DO NOT pass it on as this is how an email HOAX propagates.<ref name=\"McAfee01Dec03\" /> }}\n\n[[F-Secure]] recommends:\n\n{{quotation|Do not forward hoax messages.\n\nHoax warnings are typically scare alerts started by malicious people \u2013 and passed on by innocent individuals that think they are helping the community by spreading the warning.\n\nCorporate users can get rid of the hoax problem by simply setting a strict company guideline: End users must not forward virus alarms.

The message is usually a [[chain e-mail]] that tells the recipients to forward it to everyone they know.\n\n==Identification==\nMost hoaxes are sensational in nature and easily identified by the fact that they indicate that the virus will do nearly impossible things, like blow up the recipient's computer and set it on fire, or less sensationally, delete everything on the user's computer. They often include fake announcements claimed to originate from reputable computer organizations together with mainstream news media. These bogus sources are quoted in order to give the hoax more credibility. Typically, the warnings use emotive language, stress the urgent nature of the threat and encourage readers to forward the message to other people as soon as possible.\n\nVirus hoaxes are usually harmless and accomplish nothing more than annoying people who identify it as a hoax and waste the time of people who forward the message. Nevertheless, a number of hoaxes have warned users that vital system files are viruses and encourage the user to delete the file, possibly damaging the system. Examples of this type include the [[jdbgmgr.exe virus hoax]] and the [[SULFNBK.EXE]] hoax.<ref name=\"jdbgmgr\">{{cite web|url = http://www.snopes.com/computer/virus/jdbgmgr.asp|title = JDBGMGR.EXE Virus|last = Mikkelson|first = Barbara and David P. |authorlink = |date=January 2008|accessdate = 2011-08-08}}</ref><ref name=\"sulfnbk\">{{cite web|url = http://www.snopes.com/computer/virus/sulfnbk.asp|title = SULFNBK.EXE Virus|last = Mikkelson|first = Barbara and David P. |authorlink = |date=January 2008|accessdate = 2011-08-08}}</ref>\n\nSome consider virus hoaxes and other chain e-mails to be a [[computer worm]] in and of themselves.

Inside, Douglas finds a [[mummy]] in a [[sarcophagus]]. Unbeknownst to Douglas, the \"mummy\" is not the body of a dead Egyptian, but an extraterrestrial alien in suspended animation, being wrapped up and buried alive thousands of years before and covered with a dormant, green fungus.\n\nThe body is brought back to California and Douglas has it examined by Dr. Ken Melrose and X-rayed by student Peter Sharpe before a big press conference about the discovery. While reviewing the X-rays, Peter notices there are five crystals around the \"mummy's\" head. Peter steals the crystals and makes new X-rays to cover up his theft. He sells four of the crystals to students who are unaware of their origin. The second set of X-rays overdose the body with radiation. This causes the fungus to re-activate and the alien to awaken from suspended animation.\n\nAt the press conference the next day, one of the students touches the fungus on the sarcophagus, which eats away one of his fingers. The sarcophagus is then opened in front of the press to reveal that the mummy is gone. Ken and his colleague Dr. Hayworth attempt to identify the fungus and destroy it.\n\nAt first, everyone assumes that the mummy's disappearance is because of a fraternity prank. However, University President Wendell Rossmore wants to pin the \"theft\" on Douglas, so that he can give the Egyptian department's directorship to his flunkie, Dr. Bruce Serrano.\n\nMeanwhile, the \"mummy\" tracks down the students who have the stolen crystals. The crystals are crucial components of an intergalactic transportation device that will allow the alien to return to its home planet. The alien violently reclaims its crystals, and, when he brutally attacks a female student, Lt. Plummer is called in to investigate the crime. As more students turn up dead or injured, Plummer believes that he is on the trail of a [[serial killer]].\n\nWhile Plummer conducts his investigation, Douglas translates the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphic text]] from the sarcophagus. He hopes it will reveal the identity of the mummy. The text reveals that Tutankhamun found the alien in a coma-like state. Thinking that the unconscious alien was a god, Tutankhamun and his attendants touched it and were killed by its infectious fungus. The king and the alien were then buried together in the king's tomb. Douglas, having figured out that the \"mummy\" is an alien, makes the connection between the alien and the crystals. He then traces the stolen crystals back to Peter, who admits to the theft and gives Douglas the one crystal he kept for himself.\n\nIn the end Douglas, Wendall, Bruce, two students, a security guard and the alien all end up in a boiler room where the alien has set up its transportation device. The alien activates the device by placing the last recovered crystal on it; his mummy wrappings disintegrate, revealing his true form. The security guard urged by Bruce shoots at the alien, but Douglas leaps in front of the alien to protect it. As Douglas lies injured the alien takes his hand, and the two disappear. A single crystal is left where the alien stood. Bruce grabs the crystal, and the fungus begins to destroy his hand.\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Ben Murphy]] as Prof. Douglas McCadden \n* [[Nina Axelrod]] as Susie Fuller\n* [[Kevin Brophy]] as Peter Sharpe\n* [[James Karen]] as Dr. Wendell J.
