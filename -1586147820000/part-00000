Emerald is a [[cyclosilicate]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"emerald\" is derived (via {{lang-fro|esmeraude}} and {{lang-enm|emeraude}}), from [[Vulgar Latin]]: ''esmaralda''/''esmaraldus'', a variant of [[Latin]] ''smaragdus'', which was borrowed via {{lang-grc|\u03c3\u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2}} (smaragdos; \"green gem\") from a Semitic language.<ref>{{OEtymD|emerald}}</ref>\n\n==Properties determining value==\n[[File:5 Emeralds from Colombia.JPG|thumb|left|Cut emeralds]]\n\nEmeralds, like all colored [[gemstone]]s, are graded using four basic parameters\u2013the four ''C''s of connoisseurship: ''color'', ''clarity,'' ''cut'' and ''carat weight''.  Normally, in the grading of colored gemstones, color is by far the most important criterion. However, in the grading of emeralds, clarity is considered a close second. A fine emerald must possess not only a pure verdant green [[hue]] as described below, but also a high degree of [[transparency and translucency|transparency]] to be considered a top gemstone.<ref name=Wise>Wise, R. W. (2001) ''Secrets of the Gem Trade: the connoisseur's guide to precious gemstones''. Brunswick House Press, p. 108, {{ISBN|0-9728223-8-0}}.</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, the American jewelry industry changed the definition of ''emerald'' to include the green vanadium-bearing beryl. As a result, ''vanadium emeralds'' purchased as emeralds in the United States are not recognized as such in the UK and Europe. In America, the distinction between traditional emeralds and the new vanadium kind is often reflected in the use of terms such as \"[[Colombian Emeralds|Colombian emerald]]\".<ref name=Read>Read, Peter (2008) ''Gemmology'', 3rd rev. ed., NAG Press, p. 218, {{ISBN|0719803616}}.</ref>\n\n===Color===\nIn gemology,<ref>[http://gia4cs.gia.edu/EN-US/gr-colored-diamonds-gemstones.htm Grading Fancy-Color Diamonds] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102115539/http://gia4cs.gia.edu/en-us/gr-colored-diamonds-gemstones.htm |date=November 2, 2014 }}. Gemological Institute of America</ref> color is divided into three components: ''[[hue]]'', ''[[Saturation (color theory)|saturation]]'', and ''[[Lightness (color)|tone]]''. Emeralds occur in hues ranging from yellow-green to blue-green, with the primary hue necessarily being green. Yellow and blue are the normal secondary hues found in emeralds. Only gems that are medium to dark in tone are considered emeralds; light-toned gems are known instead by the species name ''green beryl''. The finest emeralds are approximately 75% tone on a scale where 0% tone is colorless and 100% is opaque black. In addition, a fine emerald will be saturated and have a hue that is bright (vivid). Gray is the normal saturation modifier or mask found in emeralds;  a grayish-green hue is a dull-green hue.<ref name=Wise/>\n\n===Clarity===\n[[File:Emerald in a quartz and pegmatite matrix.JPG|thumb|Brazilian emerald (grass-green variety of the mineral beryl) in a quartz-pegmatite matrix with typical hexagonal, prismatic crystals.<, where the [[loupe]] standard, i.e. 10\u00d7 magnification, is used to grade clarity, emeralds are graded by eye. Thus, if an emerald has no visible [[inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]] to the eye (assuming normal visual acuity) it is considered flawless. Stones that lack surface breaking fissures are extremely rare and therefore almost all emeralds are treated (\"oiled\", see below) to enhance the apparent clarity. The inclusions and fissures within an emerald are sometime described as ''jardin'' (French for ''garden''), because of their mossy appearance.<ref>[http://www.gia.edu/emerald-quality-factor Emerald Quality Factors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223032811/http://www.gia.edu/emerald-quality-factor |date=February 23, 2014 }}. Gemological Institute of America.</ref> Imperfections are unique for each emerald and can be used to identify a particular stone. Eye-clean stones of a vivid primary green hue (as described above), with no more than 15% of any secondary hue or combination (either blue or yellow) of a medium-dark tone, command the highest prices.<ref name=Wise/> The relative non-uniformity motivates the cutting of emeralds in [[cabochon]] form, rather than faceted shapes. Faceted emeralds are most commonly given an oval cut, or the signature emerald cut, a rectangular cut with facets around the top edge.\n\n===Treatments===\nMost emeralds are oiled as part of the post-[[lapidary]] process, in order to fill in surface-reaching cracks so that clarity and stability are improved. [[Cedar oil]], having a similar [[refractive index]], is often used in this widely adopted practice. Other liquids, including synthetic oils and polymers with refractive indexes close to that of emeralds, such as ''Opticon'', are also used. These treatments are typically applied in a vacuum chamber under mild heat, to open the pores of the stone and allow the fracture-filling agent to be absorbed more effectively.<ref>Liccini, Mark.

International Gem Society</ref> The U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]] requires the disclosure of this treatment when an oil treated emerald is sold.<ref name=ftc/> The use of oil is traditional and largely accepted by the gem trade, although oil treated emeralds are worth much less than un-treated emeralds of similar quality. Other treatments, for example the use of green-tinted oil, are not acceptable in the trade.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Read|first1=P.

These categories reflect levels of enhancement, not ''clarity''. A gem graded ''none'' on the enhancement scale may still exhibit visible inclusions. Laboratories apply these criteria differently. Some gemologists consider the mere presence of oil or polymers to constitute enhancement. Others may ignore traces of oil if the presence of the material does not improve the look of the gemstone.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Matlins|first1=Antoinette Leonard|last2=Bonanno|first2=Antonio C.|title=Jewelry & Gems, the Buying Guide: How to Buy Diamonds, Pearls, Colored Gemstones, Gold & Jewelry with Confidence and Knowledge|publisher=Gemstone Press|isbn=9780943763712|page=126|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WUBWz22wRtEC&pg=PA126&dq=gemstone+enhancement+traces+of+oil#v=onepage&q=gemstone%20enhancement%20traces%20of%20oil&f=false|accessdate=30 March 2017|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330180745/https://books.google.com.au/books?id=WUBWz22wRtEC&pg=PA126&dq=gemstone+enhancement+traces+of+oil&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8ruzuuv3SAhUT3mMKHXM_CdwQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&q=gemstone%20enhancement%20traces%20of%20oil&f=false|archivedate=March 30, 2017|df=mdy-all|year=2009}}</ref>\n\n==Emerald mines==\n[[File:Trapiche emerald (cropped).jpg|thumb|A Colombian [[trapiche emerald]]]]\nEmeralds in antiquity were mined in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] at locations on Mount Smaragdus since 1500 BCE, and India, and Austria since at least the 14th century CE.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.287.5453.631|url=http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_7/b_fdi_53-54/010020866.pdf|title=Oxygen Isotopes and Emerald Trade Routes Since Antiquity|journal=Science|year=2000|vauthors=Giuliani G, Chaussidon M, Schubnel HJ, Piat DH, Rollion-Bard C, France-Lanord C, Giard D, de Narvaez D, Rondeau B|pages=631\u20133|bibcode=2000Sci...287..631G|pmid=10649992|volume=287|issue=5453|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807120139/http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_7/b_fdi_53-54/010020866.pdf|archivedate=August 7, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Egyptian mines were exploited on an industrial scale by the Roman and Byzantine Empires, and later by Islamic conquerors.

Traditional research used qualitative guidelines such as an emerald's color, style and quality of cutting, type of fracture filling, and the anthropological origins of the artifacts bearing the mineral to determine the emerald's mine location.  More recent studies using [[energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] methods have uncovered trace chemical element differences between emeralds, including ones mined in close proximity to one another.  American gemologist David Cronin and his colleagues have extensively examined the chemical signatures of emeralds resulting from fluid dynamics and subtle precipitation mechanisms, and their research demonstrated the chemical homogeneity of emeralds from the same mining location and the statistical differences that exist between emeralds from different mining locations, including those between the three locations: Muzo, Coscuez, and Chivor, in Colombia, South America.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.gem-a.com/publications/journal-of-gemmology/issues-2008-to-date/cronin-2012.aspx |title=Determining the geographical origins of natural emeralds through nondestructive chemical fingerprinting |last=Cronin |first=David |date=2012 |journal=Journal of Gemmology |last2=Rendle |first2=Andy |pages=1\u201313 |volume=33 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015242/http://www.gem-a.com/publications/journal-of-gemmology/issues-2008-to-date/cronin-2012.aspx |archivedate=November 17, 2015 |df=mdy |doi=10.15506/JoG.2012.33.1.1 }}</ref>\n\n==Synthetic emerald==\n[[File:Emerald.png|thumb|100px|left|Emerald showing its hexagonal structure]]\n\nBoth hydrothermal and [[flux method|''flux-growth'']] synthetics have been produced, and a method has been developed for producing an emerald overgrowth on colorless [[beryl]].

These stones were initially sold under the names \"Emerita\" and \"Symeralds\", and they were grown as a thin layer of emerald on top of natural colorless beryl stones.  Later, from 1965 to 1970, the [[The Linde Group|Linde]] Division of [[Union Carbide]] produced completely synthetic emeralds by hydrothermal synthesis. According to their patents (attributable to [[Edith Flanigen|E.M. Flanigen]]),<ref>Geological Magazine \"Hydrothermal process for growing crystals having the structure of beryl in an alkaline halide medium\" {{US patent|3567642}} Issue date: March 2, 1971</ref> acidic conditions are essential to prevent the chromium (which is used as the colorant) from precipitating. Also, it is important that the silicon-containing nutrient be kept away from the other ingredients to prevent nucleation and confine growth to the seed crystals. Growth occurs by a diffusion-reaction process, assisted by convection. The largest producer of hydrothermal emeralds today is Tairus, which has succeeded in synthesizing emeralds with chemical composition similar to emeralds in alkaline deposits in Colombia, and whose products are thus known as \u201cColombian created emeralds\u201d or \u201cTairus created emeralds\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Schmetzer, Karl |author2=Schwartz, Dietmar |author3=Bernhardt, Heinz-Jurgen |author4=Tobias Hager |url=http://www.gem-a.com/media/27904/2006%2030%201%20to%202.pdf |title=A new type of Tairus hydrothermally-grown synthetic emerald, colored by vanadium and copper |journal=Journal of Gemmology of Gemmological Association of Great Britain |volume=30 |issue=1\u20132 |year=2006\u20132007 |pages=59\u201374 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711082633/http://www.gem-a.com/media/27904/2006%2030%201%20to%202.pdf |archivedate=July 11, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> Luminescence in [[ultraviolet light]] is considered a supplementary test when making a natural versus synthetic determination, as many, but not all, natural emeralds are inert to ultraviolet light.

Emerald is a [[cyclosilicate]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"emerald\" is derived (via {{lang-fro|esmeraude}} and {{lang-enm|emeraude}}), from [[Vulgar Latin]]: ''esmaralda''/''esmaraldus'', a variant of [[Latin]] ''smaragdus'', which was borrowed via {{lang-grc|\u03c3\u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2}} (smaragdos; \"green gem\") from a Semitic language.<ref>{{OEtymD|emerald}}</ref>\n\n==Properties determining value==\n[[File:5 Emeralds from Colombia.JPG|thumb|left|Cut emeralds]]\n\nEmeralds, like all colored [[gemstone]]s, are graded using four basic parameters\u2013the four ''C''s of connoisseurship: ''color'', ''clarity,'' ''cut'' and ''carat weight''.  Normally, in the grading of colored gemstones, color is by far the most important criterion. However, in the grading of emeralds, clarity is considered a close second. A fine emerald must possess not only a pure verdant green [[hue]] as described below, but also a high degree of [[transparency and translucency|transparency]] to be considered a top gemstone.<ref name=Wise>Wise, R. W. (2001) ''Secrets of the Gem Trade: the connoisseur's guide to precious gemstones''. Brunswick House Press, p. 108, {{ISBN|0-9728223-8-0}}.</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, the American jewelry industry changed the definition of ''emerald'' to include the green vanadium-bearing beryl. As a result, ''vanadium emeralds'' purchased as emeralds in the United States are not recognized as such in the UK and Europe. In America, the distinction between traditional emeralds and the new vanadium kind is often reflected in the use of terms such as \"[[Colombian Emeralds|Colombian emerald]]\".<ref name=Read>Read, Peter (2008) ''Gemmology'', 3rd rev. ed., NAG Press, p. 218, {{ISBN|0719803616}}.</ref>\n\n===Color===\nIn gemology,<ref>[http://gia4cs.gia.edu/EN-US/gr-colored-diamonds-gemstones.htm Grading Fancy-Color Diamonds] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102115539/http://gia4cs.gia.edu/en-us/gr-colored-diamonds-gemstones.htm |date=November 2, 2014 }}. Gemological Institute of America</ref> color is divided into three components: ''[[hue]]'', ''[[Saturation (color theory)|saturation]]'', and ''[[Lightness (color)|tone]]''. Emeralds occur in hues ranging from yellow-green to blue-green, with the primary hue necessarily being green. Yellow and blue are the normal secondary hues found in emeralds. Only gems that are medium to dark in tone are considered emeralds; light-toned gems are known instead by the species name ''green beryl''. The finest emeralds are approximately 75% tone on a scale where 0% tone is colorless and 100% is opaque black. In addition, a fine emerald will be saturated and have a hue that is bright (vivid). Gray is the normal saturation modifier or mask found in emeralds;  a grayish-green hue is a dull-green hue.<ref name=Wise/>\n\n===Clarity===\n[[File:Emerald in a quartz and pegmatite matrix.JPG|thumb|Brazilian emerald (grass-green variety of the mineral beryl) in a quartz-pegmatite matrix with typical hexagonal, prismatic crystals.<ref>\nBonewitz, R. (2005). ''Rock and gem''. New York: DK Pub. pp. 292\u2013293. {{ISBN|0756633427}}.\n</ref>]]\nEmeralds tend to have numerous inclusions and surface-breaking [[fissures]]. Unlike diamonds, where the [[loupe]] standard, i.e. 10\u00d7 magnification, is used to grade clarity, emeralds are graded by eye. Thus, if an emerald has no visible [[inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]] to the eye (assuming normal visual acuity) it is considered flawless. Stones that lack surface breaking fissures are extremely rare and therefore almost all emeralds are treated (\"oiled\", see below) to enhance the apparent clarity. The inclusions and fissures within an emerald are sometime described as ''jardin'' (French for ''garden''), because of their mossy appearance.<ref>[http://www.gia.edu/emerald-quality-factor Emerald Quality Factors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223032811/http://www.gia.edu/emerald-quality-factor |date=February 23, 2014 }}. Gemological Institute of America.</ref> Imperfections are unique for each emerald and can be used to identify a particular stone. Eye-clean stones of a vivid primary green hue (as described above), with no more than 15% of any secondary hue or combination (either blue or yellow) of a medium-dark tone, command the highest prices.<ref name=Wise/> The relative non-uniformity motivates the cutting of emeralds in [[cabochon]] form, rather than faceted shapes. Faceted emeralds are most commonly given an oval cut, or the signature emerald cut, a rectangular cut with facets around the top edge.\n\n===Treatments===\nMost emeralds are oiled as part of the post-[[lapidary]] process, in order to fill in surface-reaching cracks so that clarity and stability are improved. [[Cedar oil]], having a similar [[refractive index]], is often used in this widely adopted practice. Other liquids, including synthetic oils and polymers with refractive indexes close to that of emeralds, such as ''Opticon'', are also used. These treatments are typically applied in a vacuum chamber under mild heat, to open the pores of the stone and allow the fracture-filling agent to be absorbed more effectively.<ref>Liccini, Mark.

These categories reflect levels of enhancement, not ''clarity''. A gem graded ''none'' on the enhancement scale may still exhibit visible inclusions. Laboratories apply these criteria differently. Some gemologists consider the mere presence of oil or polymers to constitute enhancement. Others may ignore traces of oil if the presence of the material does not improve the look of the gemstone.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Matlins|first1=Antoinette Leonard|last2=Bonanno|first2=Antonio C.|title=Jewelry & Gems, the Buying Guide: How to Buy Diamonds, Pearls, Colored Gemstones, Gold & Jewelry with Confidence and Knowledge|publisher=Gemstone Press|isbn=9780943763712|page=126|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WUBWz22wRtEC&pg=PA126&dq=gemstone+enhancement+traces+of+oil#v=onepage&q=gemstone%20enhancement%20traces%20of%20oil&f=false|accessdate=30 March 2017|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330180745/https://books.google.com.au/books?id=WUBWz22wRtEC&pg=PA126&dq=gemstone+enhancement+traces+of+oil&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8ruzuuv3SAhUT3mMKHXM_CdwQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&q=gemstone%20enhancement%20traces%20of%20oil&f=false|archivedate=March 30, 2017|df=mdy-all|year=2009}}</ref>\n\n==Emerald mines==\n[[File:Trapiche emerald (cropped).jpg|thumb|A Colombian [[trapiche emerald]]]]\nEmeralds in antiquity were mined in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] at locations on Mount Smaragdus since 1500 BCE, and India, and Austria since at least the 14th century CE.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.287.5453.631|url=http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_7/b_fdi_53-54/010020866.pdf|title=Oxygen Isotopes and Emerald Trade Routes Since Antiquity|journal=Science|year=2000|vauthors=Giuliani G, Chaussidon M, Schubnel HJ, Piat DH, Rollion-Bard C, France-Lanord C, Giard D, de Narvaez D, Rondeau B|pages=631\u20133|bibcode=2000Sci...287..631G|pmid=10649992|volume=287|issue=5453|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807120139/http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_7/b_fdi_53-54/010020866.pdf|archivedate=August 7, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Egyptian mines were exploited on an industrial scale by the Roman and Byzantine Empires, and later by Islamic conquerors.

Traditional research used qualitative guidelines such as an emerald's color, style and quality of cutting, type of fracture filling, and the anthropological origins of the artifacts bearing the mineral to determine the emerald's mine location.  More recent studies using [[energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]] methods have uncovered trace chemical element differences between emeralds, including ones mined in close proximity to one another.  American gemologist David Cronin and his colleagues have extensively examined the chemical signatures of emeralds resulting from fluid dynamics and subtle precipitation mechanisms, and their research demonstrated the chemical homogeneity of emeralds from the same mining location and the statistical differences that exist between emeralds from different mining locations, including those between the three locations: Muzo, Coscuez, and Chivor, in Colombia, South America.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.gem-a.com/publications/journal-of-gemmology/issues-2008-to-date/cronin-2012.aspx |title=Determining the geographical origins of natural emeralds through nondestructive chemical fingerprinting |last=Cronin |first=David |date=2012 |journal=Journal of Gemmology |last2=Rendle |first2=Andy |pages=1\u201313 |volume=33 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015242/http://www.gem-a.com/publications/journal-of-gemmology/issues-2008-to-date/cronin-2012.aspx |archivedate=November 17, 2015 |df=mdy |doi=10.15506/JoG.2012.33.1.1 }}</ref>\n\n==Synthetic emerald==\n[[File:Emerald.png|thumb|100px|left|Emerald showing its hexagonal structure]]\n\nBoth hydrothermal and [[flux method|''flux-growth'']] synthetics have been produced, and a method has been developed for producing an emerald overgrowth on colorless [[beryl]].

McConnell is the second Kentuckian to lead his party in the Senate, the longest-serving U.S. senator for Kentucky in history, and the longest-serving leader of U.S. Senate Republicans in history.\n\nMcConnell was first elected to the Senate [[United States Senate election in Kentucky, 1984|in 1984]] and has been re-elected five times since. During the 1998 and 2000 election cycles, he was chairman of the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]]. McConnell was elected as [[Majority Whip]] in the [[108th Congress]] and was re-elected to the post in 2004. In November 2006, he was elected Senate [[Minority Leader]]; he held that post until 2015, when Republicans took control of the Senate and he became Senate Majority Leader.\n\nMcConnell was known as a [[Realpolitik|pragmatist]] and a [[moderate]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] early in his political career but shifted to the right over time. He led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws, culminating in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling that partially overturned the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] (McCain-Feingold) in 2009. During the [[Obama administration]], McConnell worked to withhold Republican support for major presidential initiatives, made frequent use of the [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]], and blocked many of [[Obama]]'s judicial nominees, including [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland]]. Under McConnell's leadership of the Senate, Obama saw the fewest judicial nominees confirmed in the final two years of a presidency since 1951\u201352. During the [[Trump administration]], Senate Republicans, under McConnell's leadership, broke records on the number of judicial nominees confirmed; among those nominees were [[Neil Gorsuch]] and [[Brett Kavanaugh]] who were confirmed to the Supreme Court. McConnell was included in the [[Time 100|''Time'' 100]] list of the most influential people in the world in 2015.\n\n==Early life and education (1942\u20131967)==\nMcConnell was born February 20, 1942, to Addison Mitchell McConnell, Sr. (1917-1990) and Julia Odene \"Dean\" ([[n\u00e9e]] Shockley) McConnell (1919-1993).<ref name=\"memoir\">{{Cite book |title=The Long Game: a Memoir |last=McConnell |first=Mitch|publisher=Sentinel|year=2016|isbn=9780399564123|location=New York, NY|chapter=Chapter One: A fighting spirit |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cO3CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA9 |page=9 |quote=She'd been known her whole life not by her first name, Julia, which she loved, but by her middle name, Odene, which she detested.

McConnell Jr.''' (born February 20, 1942) is an American politician serving as Kentucky's [[Seniority in the United States Senate|senior]] [[United States senator]] and as [[Senate Majority Leader]]. McConnell is the second Kentuckian to lead his party in the Senate, the longest-serving U.S. senator for Kentucky in history, and the longest-serving leader of U.S. Senate Republicans in history.\n\nMcConnell was first elected to the Senate [[United States Senate election in Kentucky, 1984|in 1984]] and has been re-elected five times since. During the 1998 and 2000 election cycles, he was chairman of the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]]. McConnell was elected as [[Majority Whip]] in the [[108th Congress]] and was re-elected to the post in 2004. In November 2006, he was elected Senate [[Minority Leader]]; he held that post until 2015, when Republicans took control of the Senate and he became Senate Majority Leader.\n\nMcConnell was known as a [[Realpolitik|pragmatist]] and a [[moderate]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] early in his political career but shifted to the right over time. He led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws, culminating in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling that partially overturned the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] (McCain-Feingold) in 2009. During the [[Obama administration]], McConnell worked to withhold Republican support for major presidential initiatives, made frequent use of the [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]], and blocked many of [[Obama]]'s judicial nominees, including [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland]]. Under McConnell's leadership of the Senate, Obama saw the fewest judicial nominees confirmed in the final two years of a presidency since 1951\u201352. During the [[Trump administration]], Senate Republicans, under McConnell's leadership, broke records on the number of judicial nominees confirmed; among those nominees were [[Neil Gorsuch]] and [[Brett Kavanaugh]] who were confirmed to the Supreme Court. McConnell was included in the [[Time 100|''Time'' 100]] list of the most influential people in the world in 2015.\n\n==Early life and education (1942\u20131967)==\nMcConnell was born February 20, 1942, to Addison Mitchell McConnell, Sr. (1917-1990) and Julia Odene \"Dean\" ([[n\u00e9e]] Shockley) McConnell (1919-1993).<ref name=\"memoir\">{{Cite book |title=The Long Game: a Memoir |last=McConnell |first=Mitch|publisher=Sentinel|year=2016|isbn=9780399564123|location=New York, NY|chapter=Chapter One: A fighting spirit |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cO3CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA9 |page=9 |quote=She'd been known her whole life not by her first name, Julia, which she loved, but by her middle name, Odene, which she detested.
