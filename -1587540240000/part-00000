He initially started as a [[peddler]], and later became a commission agent selling cloth. After a few years, he established a free dispensary with help from his community.\n\n===Early Days of the Edhi Trust===\n\nThe spirit of the [[Edhi Foundation]] was born when Abdul Sattar Edhi was a child. At the tender age of eleven, Edhi experienced his mother becoming paralyzed and mentally ill after suffering from a major stroke. A young Edhi devoted himself to her care and took on the role of feeding, bathing, and clothing her daily while responding to any and every call and necessity she required. Her deteriorating mental and physical condition left a strong and lasting impact on Edhi's mind. As a result, he dropped out of school and strictly focused on his mother's health. Edhi's mother died when he was nineteen in 1947. Her death made him reflect on others around him who were suffering from similar illnesses. After his family moved to Pakistan later that year, Edhi established a free [[dispensary]] with the help of other community members. His vision for establishing and improving the healthcare sector in [[Pakistan]] enabled him to establish a personal welfare trust for the people called \"Edhi Trust\". With the help of public funding, Edhi Trust was able to collect [[Pakistani rupee|Rs.]]200,000.<ref name=\"edhi.org\">{{cite web |url=https://edhi.org/founder-profile/|title=Founder Profile \u2013 Edhi Welfare Organization}}</ref> He expanded the trust to other medical fields and through hard work and diligence, he went on to establish a [[maternity home]] and an emergency ambulance service with the primary goal of helping those who could not help themselves. Edhi made it a habit to involve himself in every aspect of his foundation whenever possible.<ref name=\"edhi.org\"/> His foundation raised money for most noble causes and eventually, the Edhi Foundation had allotted a quota for each humanitarian cause, whether it was burying abandoned corpses or aiding in disaster relief.<ref name=\"edhi.org\"/>\n\nHe told [[NPR]] in 2009: \"I saw people lying on the pavement... The flu had spread in Karachi, and there was no one to treat them. So I set up benches and got medical students to volunteer. I was penniless and begged for donations on the street. And people gave. I bought this 8-by-8 room to start my work.\"<ref>Julie McCarthy, [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111102319 Pakistan Philanthropist Cares For Karachi's Forgotten], NPR, 28 July 2009. Retrieved 18 July 2016.</ref>\n\nIn 1948, at the age of 20, Edhi joined a [[Memon people|Memon]] charity as a volunteer. However, once he found out that the charity only attended to the needs of Memon people, he confronted his superiors to no avail, which caused him to leave to form an independent medical centre. He feared the Memon community would retaliate and possibly have him killed because of the stand he made, so he left the country in search of both safety and knowledge. Edhi travelled to [[Europe]] and made his way to [[London]] via [[Rome]] by asking for donations. His time in London allowed him to thoroughly examine the [[Welfare|social welfare]] programs active throughout the [[United Kingdom]], off of which he organized and laid the foundation for the rest of his charitable works.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/8440920/The-day-I-met-Abdul-Sattar-Edhi-a-living-saint.html|title=The day I met Abdul Sattar Edhi, a living saint|journal=Daily Telegraph|date=2008-04-10|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=\"People have become educated, but have yet to become human.\"|author=|title=|source=Abdul Sattar Edhi<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/09/world/middleeast/abdul-sattar-edhi-pakistans-father-teresa-dies-at-88.html?nytmobile=0|title=Abdus Sattar Edhi, Pakistan's 'Father Teresa,' Dies at 88 - NYTimes.com|first=Salman|last=Masood|work=nytimes.com|accessdate=9 July 2016|date=8 July 2016}}</ref>}}\n\n===Date of Birth Controversy===\nIn his autobiography, Edhi revealed that he didn't know his actual date of birth,{{sfn|Tehmina Durrani|1996}} but according to media reports published following his death, he was born on 1 January 1928.<ref name=\"thenews.com.pk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/135894-Name-the-new-airport-after-Edhi|title=Name the new airport after Edhi|work=thenews.com.pk|accessdate=22 July 2016|date=18 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Abdul Sattar Edhi laid to rest in Karachi|url=http://www.radio.gov.pk/08-Jul-2016/edhi-in-critical-condition-shifted-to-ventilator|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=Radio Pakistan|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021135535/http://www.radio.gov.pk/08-Jul-2016/edhi-in-critical-condition-shifted-to-ventilator|archivedate=21 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Nation mourns Abdul Sattar Edhi's demise \u2013 Pakistan \u2013 Dunya News|url=http://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/344363-Nation-mourns-Abdul-Sattar-Edhis-demise|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=dunyanews.tv}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=US condoles death of Abdul Sattar Edhi|url=http://nation.com.pk/international/12-Jul-2016/us-condoles-death-of-abdul-sattar-edhi|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=The Nation}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Significant people born on 1st January|url=http://aaj.tv/2016/01/significant-people-born-on-1st-january/|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=Aaj News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Dailytimes {{!}} Late Abdul Sattar Edhi's Qul held amid tight security|url=http://dailytimes.com.pk/sindh/11-Jul-16/late-abdul-sattar-edhis-qul-held-amid-tight-security|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=dailytimes.com.pk|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The gems world lost in 2016 \u2013 Pakistan \u2013 Dunya News|url=http://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/368092-The-gems-world-lost-in-2016|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=dunyanews.tv}}</ref> In 2017, [[Google Doodle]] marked his date of birth as 28 February 1928 following which several reports emerged in favour of 28 February 1928 being his birthdate.<ref>{{cite news|title=Abdul Sattar Edhi: Why Google honours him today|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/02/abdul-sattar-edhi-google-honours-angel-mercy-170227140720826.html|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=www.aljazeera.com|date=28 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Who was Abdul Sattar Edhi, Pakistan's humble 'Angel of Mercy' who founded a charity empire from a Karachi slum?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/02/27/who-was-abdul-sattar-edhi-pakistans-angel-of-mercy/|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=The Telegraph}}</ref> ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' noted \"There has been uncertainty about when his birthday is.

He initially started as a [[peddler]], and later became a commission agent selling cloth. After a few years, he established a free dispensary with help from his community.\n\n===Early Days of the Edhi Trust===\n\nThe spirit of the [[Edhi Foundation]] was born when Abdul Sattar Edhi was a child. At the tender age of eleven, Edhi experienced his mother becoming paralyzed and mentally ill after suffering from a major stroke. A young Edhi devoted himself to her care and took on the role of feeding, bathing, and clothing her daily while responding to any and every call and necessity she required. Her deteriorating mental and physical condition left a strong and lasting impact on Edhi's mind. As a result, he dropped out of school and strictly focused on his mother's health. Edhi's mother died when he was nineteen in 1947. Her death made him reflect on others around him who were suffering from similar illnesses. After his family moved to Pakistan later that year, Edhi established a free [[dispensary]] with the help of other community members. His vision for establishing and improving the healthcare sector in [[Pakistan]] enabled him to establish a personal welfare trust for the people called \"Edhi Trust\". With the help of public funding, Edhi Trust was able to collect [[Pakistani rupee|Rs.]]200,000.<ref name=\"edhi.org\">{{cite web |url=https://edhi.org/founder-profile/|title=Founder Profile \u2013 Edhi Welfare Organization}}</ref> He expanded the trust to other medical fields and through hard work and diligence, he went on to establish a [[maternity home]] and an emergency ambulance service with the primary goal of helping those who could not help themselves. Edhi made it a habit to involve himself in every aspect of his foundation whenever possible.<ref name=\"edhi.org\"/> His foundation raised money for most noble causes and eventually, the Edhi Foundation had allotted a quota for each humanitarian cause, whether it was burying abandoned corpses or aiding in disaster relief.<ref name=\"edhi.org\"/>\n\nHe told [[NPR]] in 2009: \"I saw people lying on the pavement... The flu had spread in Karachi, and there was no one to treat them. So I set up benches and got medical students to volunteer. I was penniless and begged for donations on the street. And people gave. I bought this 8-by-8 room to start my work.\"<ref>Julie McCarthy, [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111102319 Pakistan Philanthropist Cares For Karachi's Forgotten], NPR, 28 July 2009. Retrieved 18 July 2016.</ref>\n\nIn 1948, at the age of 20, Edhi joined a [[Memon people|Memon]] charity as a volunteer. However, once he found out that the charity only attended to the needs of Memon people, he confronted his superiors to no avail, which caused him to leave to form an independent medical centre. He feared the Memon community would retaliate and possibly have him killed because of the stand he made, so he left the country in search of both safety and knowledge. Edhi travelled to [[Europe]] and made his way to [[London]] via [[Rome]] by asking for donations. His time in London allowed him to thoroughly examine the [[Welfare|social welfare]] programs active throughout the [[United Kingdom]], off of which he organized and laid the foundation for the rest of his charitable works.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/8440920/The-day-I-met-Abdul-Sattar-Edhi-a-living-saint.html|title=The day I met Abdul Sattar Edhi, a living saint|journal=Daily Telegraph|date=2008-04-10|access-date=2018-06-10|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=\"People have become educated, but have yet to become human.\"|author=|title=|source=Abdul Sattar Edhi<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/09/world/middleeast/abdul-sattar-edhi-pakistans-father-teresa-dies-at-88.html?nytmobile=0|title=Abdus Sattar Edhi, Pakistan's 'Father Teresa,' Dies at 88 - NYTimes.com|first=Salman|last=Masood|work=nytimes.com|accessdate=9 July 2016|date=8 July 2016}}</ref>}}\n\n===Date of Birth Controversy===\nIn his autobiography, Edhi revealed that he didn't know his actual date of birth,{{sfn|Tehmina Durrani|1996}} but according to media reports published following his death, he was born on 1 January 1928.<ref name=\"thenews.com.pk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/135894-Name-the-new-airport-after-Edhi|title=Name the new airport after Edhi|work=thenews.com.pk|accessdate=22 July 2016|date=18 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Abdul Sattar Edhi laid to rest in Karachi|url=http://www.radio.gov.pk/08-Jul-2016/edhi-in-critical-condition-shifted-to-ventilator|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=Radio Pakistan|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021135535/http://www.radio.gov.pk/08-Jul-2016/edhi-in-critical-condition-shifted-to-ventilator|archivedate=21 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Nation mourns Abdul Sattar Edhi's demise \u2013 Pakistan \u2013 Dunya News|url=http://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/344363-Nation-mourns-Abdul-Sattar-Edhis-demise|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=dunyanews.tv}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=US condoles death of Abdul Sattar Edhi|url=http://nation.com.pk/international/12-Jul-2016/us-condoles-death-of-abdul-sattar-edhi|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=The Nation}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Significant people born on 1st January|url=http://aaj.tv/2016/01/significant-people-born-on-1st-january/|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=Aaj News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Dailytimes {{!}} Late Abdul Sattar Edhi's Qul held amid tight security|url=http://dailytimes.com.pk/sindh/11-Jul-16/late-abdul-sattar-edhis-qul-held-amid-tight-security|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=dailytimes.com.pk|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The gems world lost in 2016 \u2013 Pakistan \u2013 Dunya News|url=http://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/368092-The-gems-world-lost-in-2016|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=dunyanews.tv}}</ref> In 2017, [[Google Doodle]] marked his date of birth as 28 February 1928 following which several reports emerged in favour of 28 February 1928 being his birthdate.<ref>{{cite news|title=Abdul Sattar Edhi: Why Google honours him today|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/02/abdul-sattar-edhi-google-honours-angel-mercy-170227140720826.html|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=www.aljazeera.com|date=28 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Who was Abdul Sattar Edhi, Pakistan's humble 'Angel of Mercy' who founded a charity empire from a Karachi slum?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/02/27/who-was-abdul-sattar-edhi-pakistans-angel-of-mercy/|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=The Telegraph}}</ref> ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' noted \"There has been uncertainty about when his birthday is.

He instituted a policy of bathing of sick soldiers, as a result of which he noticed the signs of an outbreak of [[bubonic plague]], and directed the construction of segregated accommodation for those affected by it.<ref>Miles, p. 41</ref>  [[Trachoma]]<ref>Miles, p. 41</ref> was also a problem, as was [[guinea worm]].  The force left Bombay in January 1803, and landed in Egypt, after which McGrigor returned to the UK.<ref>Miles, p. 44</ref>\n\n===Spain and Portugal===\n\nIn 1811, he was appointed [[Surgeon-General (United Kingdom)|Surgeon-General]] for the Duke of Wellington's army in Spain and Portugal during the [[Peninsular Wars]] (1808\u201314).\n\n===Director-General===\n\nMcGrigor returned to Britain before the [[Battle of Waterloo]], and was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] (1814). He went on to serve as Director-General of the [[Army Medical Services|Army Medical Service]] (1815\u201351) and did much to reform that department.  (He was succeeded in that post by [[Andrew Smith (zoologist)|Andrew Smith]], who had at one time been McGrigor's Special Assistant since 1830.)<ref>Miles, p. 37</ref>\n\nIn 1821 McGrigor was elected the first President of the Medico-Botanical Society of London, established by [[John Frost (physician)|Dr John Frost]] to catalogue medicinal plants. He served this role until 1828 when he was succeeded by [[Earl Stanhope]].<ref>The Gentleman's Magazine, vol 169, p.664</ref>\n\nMcGrigor introduced the [[stethoscope]] in 1821, set up [[field hospitals]] for those injured in action, and generally improved the standards of cleanliness and hygiene. Sir James was created a Baronet on 30 September 1831,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=18851 |date=16 September 1831 |pages=1897\u20131898 }}</ref> and was appointed a [[Knight Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (KCB) in 1850.\n\nHis autobiography was published in 1861. An obelisk to his memory has been placed in Aberdeen and is now in [[Duthie Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst1871.html|title=Entry|work=Gazetteer for Scotland|accessdate=6 December 2010}}</ref>  A statue was erected in Westminster, and later moved to the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Blanco, Richard L.

It differentiates itself because of a distinct [[user interface]] and other features.\n\nOpera was conceived at [[Telenor]] as a research project in 1994 and was bought by Opera Software in 1995. It was [[commercial software]] for the first ten years and had its own proprietary [[Presto (layout engine)|Presto]] layout engine. The Presto versions of Opera received [[#Awards|many awards]], but Presto development ended after a milestone transition to Chromium in 2013.\n\nThere are also three mobile versions called [[Opera Mobile]], Opera Touch,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.opera.com/mobile/touch |title=Opera Touch \u2013 The new browser from Opera |website=www.opera.com}}</ref> and [[Opera Mini]].

Opera developer is not intended for everyday browsing as it is unstable and is prone to failure or crashing, but it enables advanced users to try out new features that are still under development, without affecting their normal installation of the browser.

They also added that the Spanish-language version has lyrics co-penned by Cuban-American singer and songwriter [[Gloria Estafan]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/90s/1992/Billboard-1992-08-08.pdf|title=Single Reviews|work=Billboard magazine|date=8 August 1992|accessdate=12 February 2020|page=72|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n===Track listing===\n#\"Amigos Para Siempre\"\n#Live Opening Ceremony Barcelona Olympic 1992 Games\n#\"Amigos Para Siempre\" (Spanish version)\n#\"Amigos Para Siempre\" (Seat Anuncio 60 aniversario) \u2013 Marujita\n\n===Charts===\n====Weekly charts====\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1992)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Australia|1|artist=Jos\u00e9 Carreras & Sarah Brightman|song=Amigos para siempre (Friends for Life)|rowheader=true|accessdate=6 March 2019}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Flanders|44|artist=Jos\u00e9 Carreras & Sarah Brightman|song=Amigos para siempre (Friends for Life)|rowheader=true|accessdate=6 March 2019}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Ireland2|16|song=Amigos para siempre (Friends for Life)|rowheader=true|accessdate=6 March 2019}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Dutch40|10|year=1992|week=36|rowheader=true|accessdate=6 March 2019}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Dutch100|7|artist=Jos\u00e9 Carreras & Sarah Brightman|song=Amigos para siempre (Friends for Life)|rowheader=true|accessdate=6 March 2019}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Norway|10|artist=Jos\u00e9 Carreras & Sarah Brightman|song=Amigos para siempre (Friends for Life)|rowheader=true|accessdate=6 March 2019}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Portugal ([[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Fonogr\u00e1fica Portuguesa|AFP]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/90s/1992/MM-1992-10-10.pdf|title=Top 10 Sales in Europe|magazine=[[Music & Media]]|volume=9|issue=41|page=40|date=10 October 1992|access-date=22 February 2020}}</ref>\n|5\n|-\n{{singlechart|Sweden|36|artist=Jos\u00e9 Carreras & Sarah Brightman|song=Amigos para siempre (Friends for Life)|rowheader=true|accessdate=6 March 2019}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|UK|11|date=Amigos para siempre (Friends for Life)|rowheader=true|accessdate=6 March 2019}}\n|}\n\n====Year-end charts====\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1992)\n!Position\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA)<ref name=\"ausye\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ariacharts.com.au/annual-charts/1992/singles-chart|title=1992 ARIA Singles Chart|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]]|accessdate=14 August 2019}}</ref>\n|5\n|}\n\n===Certifications===\n{{Certification Table Top}}\n{{Certification Table Entry|region=Australia|type=single|award=Platinum|relyear=1992|certyear=1992|certref=<ref name=\"ausye\"/>|accessdate=14 August 2019}}\n{{Certification Table Bottom|nosales=true}}\n\n==Cover versions==\nIn Spain, the most famous rendition of this song was made by Spanish group Los Manolos with [[Flamenco Rumba|rumba]] arrangements and Spanish lyrics, except for the chorus.

The usually steely defense showed some chinks as Eagles running back [[Herschel Walker]] rushed for more than 100 yards. Turnovers caused by the two great defenses kept the game close, but the Eagles won 15\u201313. Offensive struggles continued the next week vs. [[1992 Chicago Bears season|Chicago]], as the Bears led 6\u20130 at halftime. Big plays on both sides of the ball broke it open for the Saints, as quarterback [[Bobby Hebert]] connected with [[wide receiver]]s [[Eric Martin (wide receiver)|Eric Martin]] and [[Wesley Carroll (wide receiver)|Wesley Carroll]] on touchdown passes of 52 and 72 yards, respectively. Two second half scores by the Saints' defense capped the 28\u20136 win \u2013 a fumble return by [[Robert Goff (American football)|Robert \"Pig\" Goff]] and an interception return by [[Reggie Jones (cornerback, born 1969)|Reggie Jones]]. Those plays set the tone for the defensive unit throughout 1992.\n\nA 10\u20137 win over [[1992 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta]] followed and set up the annual battle with [[1992 San Francisco 49ers season|the San Francisco 49ers]]. The 49ers had worn the title of \"Team of the Decade\" for the 1980s and were the primary stumbling block for an otherwise resurgent Saints franchise during Jim Mora's tenure as head coach. The Sunday night, prime-time audience saw a tight contest throughout. With the Niners leading 16\u201310, the Saints faced first-and-goal at the San Francisco 2-yard line. Saints [[Offensive guard|guard]] [[Derek Kennard]] was flagged for holding and, on the next play, a pass into tight coverage was picked off by 49ers [[cornerback]] [[Eric Davis (American football)|Eric Davis]]. It was the Saints' sixth consecutive home game against the Niners decided by seven points or less.\n\nThe team rebounded with five straight wins and stood at 7\u20132 in the road game vs. the Niners.  For three quarters, the Saints dominated the clock and scoreboard, leading 20\u20137 on two touchdown passes by Hebert. But the defense couldn't hold the lead as [[Steve Young]] led San Francisco on two touchdown drives in the 4th quarter to win 21\u201320.\n\nMost impressive of the Saints' 12 wins in 1992 came over the next three weeks, when the team won three home games in a 10-day span. The first was a [[Monday Night Football|Monday Night]] win over the [[1992 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]], 20\u20133, keyed by a Hebert-to-[[Quinn Early|Early]] touchdown pass and stifling defense.\n\nAnother eventual playoff team came to the Superdome the following Sunday, as [[1992 Miami Dolphins season|the Miami Dolphins]] took a 13\u201310 lead into the second half. A blindsiding takeaway from Dolphins [[quarterback]] [[Dan Marino]] by speed-rushing [[linebacker]] [[Pat Swilling]] led to Robert Goff's second fumble return touchdown of the season. Later, cornerback [[Vince Buck]] returned an interception for a score as the Dolphins were defeated, 24\u201313.\n\nThe third game in this trifecta was a Thursday night tilt against Atlanta. Despite several marches up and down the field \u2013 and a memorable rumble by [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] [[Craig \"Ironhead\" Heyward]] that left Falcons [[Safety (football position)|safety]] [[Scott Case (American football)|Scott Case]] staring up at the ring of lights high above the field \u2013  the Saints offense managed just five field goals by late in the 4th quarter to lead 15\u201314. It was another defensive touchdown that saved the game for the Saints, this time an interception by [[Toi Cook]]. The Saints won two of their last three to finish 12\u20134, which was the second-best finish in team history.\n\n===Schedule===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n! Week\n! Date\n!

In the Wild Card Game, the Saints faced the Philadelphia Eagles in a rematch of their tough opening  game loss and an equally bruising game in 1991 won by the Saints. The Saints dictated the pace during the first half, leading 20\u20137 on a Heyward touchdown run and a Hebert-to-Early touchdown pass. Big plays on both sides of the ball turned game in the Eagles favor, the first being a Randall Cunningham-to-Fred Barnett touchdown pass and the last an interception return for a score by Eric Allen. The Eagles scored 26 points in the 4th quarter to win, 36\u201320. Until the 2018 NFC Championship Game, this was the last time the Saints lost a playoff game at home.\n\n==Awards and records==\nStatistically, the team finished with the top defense in the league in points allowed (202) and second-best in total yards allowed (254.6 per game) They were 5th in the NFL in the giveaway-takeaway ratio(+9)as the defense feasted on 20 fumbles and 18 interceptions. Of those 38 takeaways, six were returned for touchdowns. Sam Mills led the team in tackles with 130. Wayne Martin led the team in sacks, with 15.5. On offense, the team's passing game enjoyed its best season of the Jim Mora era to date. Hebert completed 59 percent of his passes for 3,287 yards and 19 touchdowns. Wide receiver Eric Martin had the third and final 1,000-yard season of his career.\n\n===Milestones===\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nor/1992.htm Saints on Pro Football Reference]\n*[http://www.jt-sw.com/football/pro/results.nsf/Teams/1992-no Saints on jt-sw.com]\n\n{{New Orleans Saints}}\n{{New Orleans Saints seasons}}\n{{1992 NFL season by team}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:1992 New Orleans Saints Season}}\n[[Category:1992 National Football League season by team|New Orleans]]\n[[Category:New Orleans Saints seasons]]\n[[Category:1992 in sports in Louisiana|New]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox NFL season\n| team = New Orleans Saints\n| year = 1992\n| record = 12\u20134\n| division_place = 2nd [[NFC West]]\n| coach = [[Jim E.

The usually steely defense showed some chinks as Eagles running back [[Herschel Walker]] rushed for more than 100 yards. Turnovers caused by the two great defenses kept the game close, but the Eagles won 15\u201313. Offensive struggles continued the next week vs. [[1992 Chicago Bears season|Chicago]], as the Bears led 6\u20130 at halftime. Big plays on both sides of the ball broke it open for the Saints, as quarterback [[Bobby Hebert]] connected with [[wide receiver]]s [[Eric Martin (wide receiver)|Eric Martin]] and [[Wesley Carroll (wide receiver)|Wesley Carroll]] on touchdown passes of 52 and 72 yards, respectively. Two second half scores by the Saints' defense capped the 28\u20136 win \u2013 a fumble return by [[Robert Goff (American football)|Robert \"Pig\" Goff]] and an interception return by [[Reggie Jones (cornerback, born 1969)|Reggie Jones]]. Those plays set the tone for the defensive unit throughout 1992.\n\nA 10\u20137 win over [[1992 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta]] followed and set up the annual battle with [[1992 San Francisco 49ers season|the San Francisco 49ers]]. The 49ers had worn the title of \"Team of the Decade\" for the 1980s and were the primary stumbling block for an otherwise resurgent Saints franchise during Jim Mora's tenure as head coach. The Sunday night, prime-time audience saw a tight contest throughout. With the Niners leading 16\u201310, the Saints faced first-and-goal at the San Francisco 2-yard line. Saints [[Offensive guard|guard]] [[Derek Kennard]] was flagged for holding and, on the next play, a pass into tight coverage was picked off by 49ers [[cornerback]] [[Eric Davis (American football)|Eric Davis]]. It was the Saints' sixth consecutive home game against the Niners decided by seven points or less.\n\nThe team rebounded with five straight wins and stood at 7\u20132 in the road game vs. the Niners.  For three quarters, the Saints dominated the clock and scoreboard, leading 20\u20137 on two touchdown passes by Hebert. But the defense couldn't hold the lead as [[Steve Young]] led San Francisco on two touchdown drives in the 4th quarter to win 21\u201320.\n\nMost impressive of the Saints' 12 wins in 1992 came over the next three weeks, when the team won three home games in a 10-day span. The first was a [[Monday Night Football|Monday Night]] win over the [[1992 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]], 20\u20133, keyed by a Hebert-to-[[Quinn Early|Early]] touchdown pass and stifling defense.\n\nAnother eventual playoff team came to the Superdome the following Sunday, as [[1992 Miami Dolphins season|the Miami Dolphins]] took a 13\u201310 lead into the second half. A blindsiding takeaway from Dolphins [[quarterback]] [[Dan Marino]] by speed-rushing [[linebacker]] [[Pat Swilling]] led to Robert Goff's second fumble return touchdown of the season. Later, cornerback [[Vince Buck]] returned an interception for a score as the Dolphins were defeated, 24\u201313.\n\nThe third game in this trifecta was a Thursday night tilt against Atlanta. Despite several marches up and down the field \u2013 and a memorable rumble by [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] [[Craig \"Ironhead\" Heyward]] that left Falcons [[Safety (football position)|safety]] [[Scott Case (American football)|Scott Case]] staring up at the ring of lights high above the field \u2013  the Saints offense managed just five field goals by late in the 4th quarter to lead 15\u201314. It was another defensive touchdown that saved the game for the Saints, this time an interception by [[Toi Cook]]. The Saints won two of their last three to finish 12\u20134, which was the second-best finish in team history.\n\n===Schedule===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n! Week\n! Date\n!

In the Wild Card Game, the Saints faced the Philadelphia Eagles in a rematch of their tough opening  game loss and an equally bruising game in 1991 won by the Saints. The Saints dictated the pace during the first half, leading 20\u20137 on a Heyward touchdown run and a Hebert-to-Early touchdown pass. Big plays on both sides of the ball turned game in the Eagles favor, the first being a Randall Cunningham-to-Fred Barnett touchdown pass and the last an interception return for a score by Eric Allen. The Eagles scored 26 points in the 4th quarter to win, 36\u201320. Until the 2018 NFC Championship Game, this was the last time the Saints lost a playoff game at home.\n\n==Awards and records==\nStatistically, the team finished with the top defense in the league in points allowed (202) and second-best in total yards allowed (254.6 per game) They were 5th in the NFL in the giveaway-takeaway ratio(+9)as the defense feasted on 20 fumbles and 18 interceptions. Of those 38 takeaways, six were returned for touchdowns. Sam Mills led the team in tackles with 130. Wayne Martin led the team in sacks, with 15.5. On offense, the team's passing game enjoyed its best season of the Jim Mora era to date. Hebert completed 59 percent of his passes for 3,287 yards and 19 touchdowns. Wide receiver Eric Martin had the third and final 1,000-yard season of his career.\n\n===Milestones===\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/nor/1992.htm Saints on Pro Football Reference]\n*[http://www.jt-sw.com/football/pro/results.nsf/Teams/1992-no Saints on jt-sw.com]\n\n{{New Orleans Saints}}\n{{New Orleans Saints seasons}}\n{{1992 NFL season by team}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:1992 New Orleans Saints Season}}\n[[Category:1992 National Football League season by team|New Orleans]]\n[[Category:New Orleans Saints seasons]]\n[[Category:1992 in sports in Louisiana|New]]\n", "name_user": "Joeykai", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_New_Orleans_Saints_season"}

(in Russian).</ref>\n\n== Physics of the phenomenon ==\nThe troppy effect is a result of the loss of stability of the roller movement along the shaft due to the accumulation of residual wear-fatigue damage at loads exceeding the rolling fatigue limit. The loss of motion stability is characterized by self-excitation of [[Vibration|vibrations]] in the roller / shaft system and is accompanied by elastoplastic deformation of bodies in the contact area. Under certain conditions, it leads to the appearance of an unsteady vibro-shock process with a variable frequency and repeatedly variable contact load. This leads to the formation of residual wave-like damages on the contact surfaces with half-barrel-shaped dimples, the sizes of which in the circumferential, axial and radial directions turn out to be unequal (Figure 1). Sources (cause) of oscillations in three directions are, firstly, distortions of the contact geometry and, secondly, local non-isotropy of the mechanical properties of the material in different contact zones. A significant role is also played by [[fretting]] fatigue in the main directions (circumferential and axial) of the contact plane.\n\n[[File:Troppy-1.jpg|thumb|<div style=\"text-align:center;\"> Figure 1 \u2013 Typical radial residual deformations (''a'') and their scan along the circumference ''L''=2\u03c0''R'' (''b''); ''c'' \u2013 axial residual deformations</div>|alt=]]\n\nAmong the numerous and diverse phenomena of loss of stability of motion, we can distinguish those in which disturbing motion factors are due to the complex interaction of elements (in the general case of a different nature) of the mechanical system. Such, for example, are flutter and shimmy, the description of which was given in the works of [[Mstislav Keldysh|M. V. Keldysh]]<ref>Keldysh, M. V. \"Shimmy during the movement of the wheel of a three-wheeled chassis\" / M. V. Keldysh // Selected Works. Mechanics. \u2013 M .: Nauka, 1985. \u2013 P. 491\u2013530. (in Russian).</ref>. In addition to the design features of the wing ([[Aeroelasticity#Flutter|flutter]]) and aircraft landing gear (shimmy), their loss of stability during movement occurs as a result of a special kind of interaction either with the air flow (with flutter) or with the ground (with shimmy).\nAlthough the phenomenon of troppy is on a par with the phenomena of flutter and shimmy in the complexity of the nature of the interaction, nevertheless, troppy has significant features. Firstly, in the [[Tribo-Fatigue|tribo-fatigue]] system, two solid deformable bodies interact. Secondly, for troppy, the history of movement and loading (damage to the elements of the [[Tribo-Fatigue|tribo-fatigue]] system) is important, which determines the change in the conditions of interaction over time. If during flutter and shimmy the disturbing factors are external to the mechanical system and do not depend on it, then during troppy the disturbing factors are determined by the mechanical parameters of the system, which change during movement and damage. In other words, the inverse effect of motion on disturbing factors is realized.\n\n== Troppy effect in real systems ==\nThe troppy effect can be regarded as fundamental; in practice, its particular species are found. So, for example, under certain operating conditions of [[Track (rail transport)|rails]] and [[Train wheel|railway wheels]], similar irregular damages of both elements are formed, which initiate strong vibrations of the rolling stock, and sometimes the train goes off the rails<ref>Alias, J. \"Characteristics of wave formation in rails\" / J.

In the working zone, both cyclic stresses occur during volumetric deformation (bending by load ''Q'') and the contact stress field under contact load ''F''<sub>''N''</sub>.\n\n[[File:Troppy-4.jpg|thumb|<div style=\"text-align:center;\"> Figure 4 \u2013 Influence of the error in the manufacture of the shaft on the excitation of the troppy during mechano-rolling fatigue</div>|alt=]]\n\nThe mechano-rolling fatigue tests were subjected to the [[Tribo-Fatigue|tribo-fatigue]] system steel 25HGT (roller) / steel 45 (shaft). A characteristic feature of this system was that the strength of the shaft metal is significantly less than that of the roller, therefore, during the tests, residual deformations and damage are found only in the vicinity of the roller track on the shaft, while the dimensions of the roller remain almost undistorted.\nThe influence of the manufacturing error of the shaft on the excitation of the troppy is shown in the graphs of Figure 4. For deviations of \u0394=10 \u03bcm, the movement of the roller along the shaft was stable during the entire test period. But if the manufacturing error was \u0394=40 \u03bcm, there was a loss of motion stability (see mark 1 in Figure 4). The development of wave-like residual damage leads to a shock-fatigue process (see mark 2 in Figure 4). This process is unsteady in amplitude and frequency. Consequently, the geometry of the elements and the accuracy in contact are factors that largely form the conditions for the occurrence of residual wave-like damage during mechano-rolling fatigue tests.\n\nIn the case of an initial local violation of the shaft geometry (flat on its surface \u2013 see Figure 5), the movement of the roller along the shaft is practically unsteady initially. And this unsteadiness is enhanced due to the residual change in the size of the contact area and the local properties of the material along the rolling track. This is due to the fact that after the jump on the flat, the roller impacts the metal in the vicinity of the next point 2. Next, a similar process of the formation of wave-like damages occurs already in the vicinity of point 3. It turns out that the residual wave-like damage rolls from point to point. When the shock-fatigue process begins, they are formed along the entire length of the rolling track during a very short test time and become deep and wide.\n\n[[File:Troppy-5.jpg|thumb|<div style=\"text-align:center;\"> Figure 5 \u2013 Change in the convergence of the \u03b4<sub>c</sub> axes in time with rolling fatigue of a friction shaft (steel 45) / roller (steel 25HGT): values at 8 points (1, 2, ..., 8) along the circumference of the shaft ''L''=2\u03c0''R''</div>|alt=]]\n\nThe role of the [[anisotropy]] of the mechanical properties of the material at different points along the shaft circumference on the excitation of vibrations in the system is shown in Figure 6.

(in Russian).</ref>\n\n== Physics of the phenomenon ==\nThe troppy effect is a result of the loss of stability of the roller movement along the shaft due to the accumulation of residual wear-fatigue damage at loads exceeding the rolling fatigue limit. The loss of motion stability is characterized by self-excitation of [[Vibration|vibrations]] in the roller / shaft system and is accompanied by elastoplastic deformation of bodies in the contact area. Under certain conditions, it leads to the appearance of an unsteady vibro-shock process with a variable frequency and repeatedly variable contact load. This leads to the formation of residual wave-like damages on the contact surfaces with half-barrel-shaped dimples, the sizes of which in the circumferential, axial and radial directions turn out to be unequal (Figure 1). Sources (cause) of oscillations in three directions are, firstly, distortions of the contact geometry and, secondly, local non-isotropy of the mechanical properties of the material in different contact zones. A significant role is also played by [[fretting]] fatigue in the main directions (circumferential and axial) of the contact plane.\n\n[[File:Troppy-1.jpg|thumb|<div style=\"text-align:center;\"> Figure 1 \u2013 Typical radial residual deformations (''a'') and their scan along the circumference ''L''=2\u03c0''R'' (''b''); ''c'' \u2013 axial residual deformations</div>|alt=]]\n\nAmong the numerous and diverse phenomena of loss of stability of motion, we can distinguish those in which disturbing motion factors are due to the complex interaction of elements (in the general case of a different nature) of the mechanical system. Such, for example, are flutter and shimmy, the description of which was given in the works of [[Mstislav Keldysh|M. V. Keldysh]]<ref>Keldysh, M. V. \"Shimmy during the movement of the wheel of a three-wheeled chassis\" / M. V. Keldysh // Selected Works. Mechanics. \u2013 M .: Nauka, 1985. \u2013 P. 491\u2013530. (in Russian).</ref>. In addition to the design features of the wing ([[Aeroelasticity#Flutter|flutter]]) and aircraft landing gear (shimmy), their loss of stability during movement occurs as a result of a special kind of interaction either with the air flow (with flutter) or with the ground (with shimmy).\nAlthough the phenomenon of troppy is on a par with the phenomena of flutter and shimmy in the complexity of the nature of the interaction, nevertheless, troppy has significant features. Firstly, in the [[Tribo-Fatigue|tribo-fatigue]] system, two solid deformable bodies interact. Secondly, for troppy, the history of movement and loading (damage to the elements of the [[Tribo-Fatigue|tribo-fatigue]] system) is important, which determines the change in the conditions of interaction over time. If during flutter and shimmy the disturbing factors are external to the mechanical system and do not depend on it, then during troppy the disturbing factors are determined by the mechanical parameters of the system, which change during movement and damage. In other words, the inverse effect of motion on disturbing factors is realized.\n\n== Troppy effect in real systems ==\nThe troppy effect can be regarded as fundamental; in practice, its particular species are found. So, for example, under certain operating conditions of [[Track (rail transport)|rails]] and [[Train wheel|railway wheels]], similar irregular damages of both elements are formed, which initiate strong vibrations of the rolling stock, and sometimes the train goes off the rails<ref>Alias, J. \"Characteristics of wave formation in rails\" / J.

In its transformation into a [[junior college]], it began offering college-level academic courses in 1922 and was accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] in 1926.\n\nDuring the [[World War II]] years, a vocational education curriculum was added to the college's offerings, and in the late 1960s, technical degree programs were added.\n\nBranch locations in Jackson and [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]] were opened in the 1970s. These branches primarily offered high school vocational education, though some college-level night courses were taught. Utica Junior College, a [[historically black college]] whose history dates to 1903, merged with Hinds Junior College in 1982 under Federal court order as part of a [[class action]] [[racial discrimination]] lawsuit.\n\nThe Pearl-Rankin Vocational/Career Center was opened in the town of [[Pearl, Mississippi|Pearl]] in 1983, offering high school vocational education and some college-level night courses. This branch later became the Rankin Campus; it now offers academic, technical, and career programs.\n\nThe Jackson Campus-Nursing/Allied Health Center was opened in Jackson in 1984, offering nursing and other medical and dental programs. This center, together with the existing branch in Jackson, became known as the Jackson Campus. A Resource and Coordinating Unit for Economic Development (RCU) was added in 1988 in Raymond, and the Eagle Ridge Conference Center was opened in 1996 under the administration of the RCU. The Vicksburg branch became the Vicksburg Campus in 2002 and now offers college-level programs.\n\nHinds Junior College changed its name to Hinds Community College in 1987; that year 13 of the 14 other Mississippi public two-year colleges also adopted the \"community\" label. Hinds linked up with other two-year colleges by means of the [[Community College Network]] (CCN) in 1994. This system allows a course to be offered at one college location while students may participate in the course at several other college locations by means of [[video conferencing]].
