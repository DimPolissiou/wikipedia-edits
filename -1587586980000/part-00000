The three had played together with ex-Spudgun guitarist Dave Layde in Mediumwave between 1996 and 1999. The band released two studio LPs ''Future Kings of Spain (2003)'' and ''Nervousystem (2007)'' and one EP ''Les Debemos (2004)''. In September 2009 after some considerable silence, many music media outlets reported on the statement on the band's website announcing how the band had \"brought things to a close\", though not giving a reason for this apparent break-up.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe idea to call the band Future Kings Of Spain came about when Wilson, \"was reading two unrelated articles at once and lined up the words Future Kings on one side and of Spain on the other.\"<ref name=\"Contact Music\">[http://www.contactmusic.com/pages/futurekingsofspaininterviewx01x12x03 Contact Music Interview]</ref> McMahon confirmed this in a radio interview with the Irish state broadcaster RT\u00c9 in August 2003.<ref name=\"RT\u00c9 Radio Interview: 28 August 2003\">[http://www.rte.ie/radio/rattlebag/2003/0828/rattlebag.html RT\u00c9 Radio Interview]</ref>\n\nIn 2009 the band broke up with no reason given.

The three had played together with ex-Spudgun guitarist Dave Layde in Mediumwave between 1996 and 1999. The band released two studio LPs ''Future Kings of Spain (2003)'' and ''Nervousystem (2007)'' and one EP ''Les Debemos (2004)''. In September 2009 after some considerable silence, many music media outlets reported on the statement on the band's website announcing how the band had \"brought things to a close\", though not giving a reason for this apparent break-up.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe idea to call the band Future Kings Of Spain came about when Wilson, \"was reading two unrelated articles at once and lined up the words Future Kings on one side and of Spain on the other.\"<ref name=\"Contact Music\">[http://www.contactmusic.com/pages/futurekingsofspaininterviewx01x12x03 Contact Music Interview]</ref> McMahon confirmed this in a radio interview with the Irish state broadcaster RT\u00c9 in August 2003.<ref name=\"RT\u00c9 Radio Interview: 28 August 2003\">[http://www.rte.ie/radio/rattlebag/2003/0828/rattlebag.html RT\u00c9 Radio Interview]</ref>\n\nIn 2009 the band broke up with no reason given.

They were joined by Karl Hussey in late 2003 and remained a 4-piece until they brought things to a close in June 2009. The band recorded 2 LPs and 1 EP.

It is probably Berg's best-known and most frequently performed instrumental piece, in which the composer sought to reconcile [[diatonicism]] and [[dodecaphony]]. Berg composed it on a commission from [[Louis Krasner]], and it became the last work that he completed. Krasner performed the solo part in the premiere at the [[Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana]], [[Barcelona]] on 19 April 1936, after the composer's death.\n\n== Conception and composition ==\nThe piece stemmed from a commission from the [[violin]]ist [[Louis Krasner]]. When he first received the commission, Berg was working on his opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', and he did not begin work on the [[concerto]] for some months. The event that spurred him into writing was the death by polio of 18-year-old [[Manon Gropius]], the daughter of [[Alma Mahler]] (once [[Gustav Mahler]]'s wife) and [[Walter Gropius]]. Berg set ''Lulu'' aside to write the concerto, which he dedicated \"To the memory of an angel\".<ref name=\"Glass\" />\n\nBerg worked on the piece very quickly, completing it within a few months; it is thought that his working on the concerto was largely responsible for his failing to complete ''Lulu'' before his death on 24 December 1935. The violin concerto was the last work that Berg completed. In a letter to Krasner dated 16 July 1935, Berg confessed: {{quote|Yesterday I finished the composition [without the orchestration] of our Violin Concerto. I am probably more surprised by it than you will be (...) the work gave me more and more joy.

(eds.), ''The Berg-Schoenberg Correspondence'', p.466. quoted in Pople (1991) ,p.47.</ref> It is in two movements, each divided into two sections:\n\n{{ordered-list|type=upper-roman\n| {{ordered-list|type=lower-alpha\n  | Andante (Prelude)\n  | Allegretto (Scherzo)\n  }}\n| {{ordered-list|type=lower-alpha\n  | Allegro (Cadenza)\n  | Adagio (Chorale Variations)\n  }}\n}}\n\nThe work begins with an [[tempo|Andante]] in classical [[sonata form]], followed by the [[tempo|Allegretto]], a dance-like section. The second movement starts with an [[tempo|Allegro]] largely based on a single recurring [[rhythm]]ic [[cell (music)|cell]]; this section has been described as [[cadenza]]-like, with very difficult passages in the solo part. The orchestration becomes rather violent at its climax (which is literally marked in the score as \"High point of the Allegro\"); the fourth and final section, marked [[tempo|Adagio]], is in a much calmer mood. The first two sections are meant to represent life, the last two death and [[Transfiguration (religion)|transfiguration]].\n\n[[Image:Berg - Violin Concerto lament melody.png|thumb|right|400px|\"lament\" melody and its construction from the pitches of RI-5 and P-8<ref>Whittall, Arnold. 2008.

New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-68200-8}} (pbk).</ref> {{audio|Berg - Violin Concerto lament melody.mid|Play}}]]\n\nLike a number of other works by Berg, the piece combines the [[twelve tone technique]], typical of [[Serialism|serialistic music]] learned from his teacher [[Arnold Schoenberg]] with passages written in a freer, more tonal style. The score integrates serialism and tonality in a remarkable fashion. Here is Berg's tone row:\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\new Staff \\with { \\remove \"Time_signature_engraver\" \\remove \"Bar_engraver\" } \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\override Stem #'transparent = ##t g4 bes d fis a c e gis b cis ees f } </score>\nAlthough this contains all twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]], there is a strong tonal undercurrent: the first three notes of the row make up a [[G minor]] [[Triad (music)|triad]]; notes three to five are a [[D major]] triad; notes five to seven are an [[A minor]] triad; notes seven to nine are an [[E major]] triad;\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> { \\new PianoStaff << \\new Staff \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\time 2/4 r8 <d bes>4( <d bes>8~ | <d bes> <d a>4 <d a>8~ | <d a>) <c a>4( <c a>8~ | <c a> <b e,>4 <b e,>8) } \\new Staff \\relative c { \\clef bass \\time 2/4 g,2( | fis' | e' | gis, } >> } </score>\nand the last four notes (B, C{{music|#}}, E{{music|b}}, F) and the first (G) together make up part of a [[whole tone scale]].

It is probably Berg's best-known and most frequently performed instrumental piece, in which the composer sought to reconcile [[diatonicism]] and [[dodecaphony]]. Berg composed it on a commission from [[Louis Krasner]], and it became the last work that he completed. Krasner performed the solo part in the premiere at the [[Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana]], [[Barcelona]] on 19 April 1936, after the composer's death.\n\n== Conception and composition ==\nThe piece stemmed from a commission from the [[violin]]ist [[Louis Krasner]]. When he first received the commission, Berg was working on his opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', and he did not begin work on the [[concerto]] for some months. The event that spurred him into writing was the death by polio of 18-year-old [[Manon Gropius]], the daughter of [[Alma Mahler]] (once [[Gustav Mahler]]'s wife) and [[Walter Gropius]]. Berg set ''Lulu'' aside to write the concerto, which he dedicated \"To the memory of an angel\".<ref name=\"Glass\" />\n\nBerg worked on the piece very quickly, completing it within a few months; it is thought that his working on the concerto was largely responsible for his failing to complete ''Lulu'' before his death on 24 December 1935. The violin concerto was the last work that Berg completed. In a letter to Krasner dated 16 July 1935, Berg confessed: {{quote|Yesterday I finished the composition [without the orchestration] of our Violin Concerto. I am probably more surprised by it than you will be (...) the work gave me more and more joy. I hope - no, I have the confident belief - that I have succeeded.{{cn|date=April 2020}}}}<!-- looked in ''Berg: Violin Concerto'' (1991) by Anthony Pople and Julian Rushton, but can't find it there -->\n\n== Scoring ==\n[[File:Louis Krasner (1903\u20131995) und Helene Berg (1885\u20131976) mit der Partitur des Violinkonzerts (1961) OeNB 657332.png|thumb|[[Louis Krasner|Krasner]] and Berg's widow [[:de:Helene Berg|Helene]] with the score (1961)]]\nThe concerto is scored for 2 [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (both doubling as [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s (one doubling as a [[cor anglais]]), [[alto saxophone]] (doubling as 3rd clarinet), 2 [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], 4 [[French horn|horns]], 2 [[trumpet]]s, 2 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[percussion]], [[harp]] and [[string section|strings]].<ref name=\"Glass\">{{cite news\n |last         = Glass\n |first        = Herbert\n |url          = https://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/violin-concerto-alban-berg\n |title        = Violin Concerto \u2013 About the piece\n |publisher    = [[LA Phil]]\n |accessdate   = 2 November 2017\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20171107012243/https://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/violin-concerto-alban-berg\n |archive-date = 7 November 2017\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\nBerg described the structure of the concerto in a letter to [[Arnold Schoenberg]].<ref>Brand et al.

The second movement starts with an [[tempo|Allegro]] largely based on a single recurring [[rhythm]]ic [[cell (music)|cell]]; this section has been described as [[cadenza]]-like, with very difficult passages in the solo part. The orchestration becomes rather violent at its climax (which is literally marked in the score as \"High point of the Allegro\"); the fourth and final section, marked [[tempo|Adagio]], is in a much calmer mood. The first two sections are meant to represent life, the last two death and [[Transfiguration (religion)|transfiguration]].\n\n[[Image:Berg - Violin Concerto lament melody.png|thumb|right|400px|\"lament\" melody and its construction from the pitches of RI-5 and P-8<ref>Whittall, Arnold. 2008.

The score integrates serialism and tonality in a remarkable fashion. Here is Berg's tone row:\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\new Staff \\with { \\remove \"Time_signature_engraver\" \\remove \"Bar_engraver\" } \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\override Stem #'transparent = ##t g4 bes d fis a c e gis b cis ees f } </score>\nAlthough this contains all twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]], there is a strong tonal undercurrent: the first three notes of the row make up a [[G minor]] [[Triad (music)|triad]]; notes three to five are a [[D major]] triad; notes five to seven are an [[A minor]] triad; notes seven to nine are an [[E major]] triad;\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> { \\new PianoStaff << \\new Staff \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\time 2/4 r8 <d bes>4( <d bes>8~ | <d bes> <d a>4 <d a>8~ | <d a>) <c a>4( <c a>8~ | <c a> <b e,>4 <b e,>8) } \\new Staff \\relative c { \\clef bass \\time 2/4 g,2( | fis' | e' | gis, } >> } </score>\nand the last four notes (B, C{{music|#}}, E{{music|b}}, F) and the first (G) together make up part of a [[whole tone scale]].  The roots of the four triads correspond to the [[Open string (music)|open strings]] of the violin, which is highlighted in the opening passage of the piece.\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\numericTimeSignature \\time 4/4 g8(\\pp d' a' e') e( a, d, g,~ | g1) } </score>\nThe resulting triads are thus fifth-related and form a [[cadence (music)|cadence]], which we hear directly before the row is played by the violin for the first time.
