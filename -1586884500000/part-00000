It is set in a [[dystopia]]n future in which the populace is controlled through [[Android (robot)|android]] police and mandatory use of drugs that suppress emotions. Produced by [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and written by Lucas and [[Walter Murch]], it stars [[Robert Duvall]] and [[Donald Pleasence]].\n\n''THX 1138'' was developed from Lucas's student film ''[[Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB]]'', which he made in 1967 while attending the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]]. The feature film was produced in a joint venture between [[Warner Bros.]] and [[American Zoetrope]]. A novelization by [[Ben Bova]] was published in 1971. The film received mixed reviews from critics and [[Box office bomb|failed to find box-office success]] on initial release; however, the film has subsequently received critical acclaim and gained a [[cult following]], particularly in the aftermath of Lucas' success with ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' in 1977.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. The plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn the future, [[sexual intercourse]] and [[reproduction]] are prohibited, whereas use of [[Psychoactive drug|mind-altering drugs]] is mandatory to enforce compliance among the citizens and to ensure their ability to conduct dangerous and demanding tasks. Emotions and the concept of family are [[taboo]]. Everyone is clad in identical white uniforms and has shaven heads to emphasize uniformity, except the police [[android (robot)|android]]s (who wear black) and robed monks. Instead of names, people have designations with three arbitrary letters (referred to as the \"prefix\") and four digits, shown on an identity badge worn at all times.\n\nAt their jobs in central video <!-- CCTV --> control centers, SEN 5241 and LUH 3417 keep surveillance on the city. LUH has a male roommate, THX 1138, who works in a factory producing android police officers. At the beginning of the story, THX finishes his shift while the loudspeakers urge the workers to \"increase safety\"\u2014and congratulate them for only losing 195 workers in the last period\u2014to the competing factory's 242. On the way home, he stops at a confession booth in a row of many, and relates his concerns and mumbles prayers about \"party\" and \"masses\", under the [[Jesus Christ]]-esque portrait of \"OMM 0000\". A soothing voice greets THX, and OMM ends every [[Confession (religion)|confession]] with a parting salutation: \"You are a true believer, blessings of the State, blessings of the masses. Work hard, increase production, prevent accidents and be happy.\"\n\nAt home, THX takes his drugs and watches [[Holography|holobroadcasts]] while engaging with a masturbatory device. LUH secretly substitutes pills in her possession for THX's medications, causing him to develop nausea, anxiety, and sexual desires. LUH and THX become involved romantically and have sex. THX later is confronted by SEN, who arranges THX as his new roommate, but THX files a complaint against SEN for the illegal housing mate change. Without drugs in his system, THX falters during a critical and hazardous phase of his job, and a control center engages a \"mind lock\" on THX which raises the level of danger. After the release of the mind lock, THX makes the necessary correction to that work phase. THX and LUH are arrested and THX undergoes drug therapy. He enjoys a brief reunion with LUH, disrupted shortly after she reveals her pregnancy.\n\nAt THX's trial, THX is sentenced to prison, alongside SEN. Most of the prisoners seem uninterested in escape, but eventually THX and SEN find an exit, and they are later joined by [[Holography|hologram]] actor SRT 5752, who starred in the holobroadcasts. During the escape, THX and SRT are separated from SEN. Chased by the police robots, THX and SRT are trapped in a control center, from which THX learns that LUH has been \"consumed\", and her name has been reassigned to [[fetus]] 66691 in a growth chamber. SEN eventually escapes to an area reserved for the monks of OMM, where a lone monk notices that SEN has no identification badge. SEN attacks him and later wanders into a child-rearing area, strikes up a conversation with children and sits aimlessly until police androids apprehend him. THX and SRT steal two cars, but SRT crashes his into a concrete pillar.\n\nPursued by two police androids on motorcycles, THX flees to the limits of the city and escapes into a ventilation shaft. The police androids pursue him on motorcycles along the shaft to an escape ladder, but are ordered by Central Command to cease pursuit, on the grounds that the expense of his capture exceeds their allocated budget. The guards inform THX that the surface is uninhabitable but he is undeterred and continues up the ventilation shaft. The city is then revealed to be entirely underground, and THX has escaped onto the surface, where he then witnesses the sun setting. A bird can be seen flying in the distance, indicating that at least some life is still inhabiting the planet's surface.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Christ Giving His Blessing.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Hans Memling]]'s ''Christ Giving His Blessing'' (1478) is used as the visual representation of the [[State religion|state-sanctioned]] [[deity]] OMM 0000.<ref>Compare with [https://www.imdb.com/media/rm2820911104/tt0066434?ref_=ttmi_mi_all_sf_10 this image] from [[IMDb]].</ref>]]\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as THX 1138 \n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as SEN 5241\n* [[Maggie McOmie]] as LUH 3417\n* [[Don Pedro Colley]] as the hologram SRT\n* [[Ian Wolfe]] as the old prisoner PTO\n* [[Marshall Efron]] as prisoner TWA\n* [[Sid Haig]] as prisoner NCH\n* [[John Pearce (actor)|John Pearce]] as prisoner DWY\n* [[James Wheaton]] as the voice of OMM 0000\n* [[David Ogden Stiers]] (as David Ogden Steers) Narrator <ref>{{cite news |last1=Fox News |title=David Ogden Stiers, fussy 'M*A*S*H' doc and beloved clock from Disney's 'Beast,' dies at 75 |url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/david-ogden-stiers-fussy-mash-doc-and-beloved-clock-from-disneys-beast-dies-at-75 |accessdate=14 April 2020 |work=Fox News |agency=Fox News Channel |publisher=Fox News}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''THX 1138'' was the first film made in a planned seven-picture slate commissioned by Warner Bros. from the 1969 incarnation of [[American Zoetrope]].<ref>Pollock 1983, p. 88.</ref><ref>Louise Sweeney, \"The Movie Business is alive and well and living in San Francisco\", ''Show'', April 1970.</ref> Lucas wrote the initial script draft based on his earlier short film but Coppola and Lucas agreed it was unsatisfactory.

The film received mixed reviews from critics and [[Box office bomb|failed to find box-office success]] on initial release; however, the film has subsequently received critical acclaim and gained a [[cult following]], particularly in the aftermath of Lucas' success with ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' in 1977.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. The plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn the future, [[sexual intercourse]] and [[reproduction]] are prohibited, whereas use of [[Psychoactive drug|mind-altering drugs]] is mandatory to enforce compliance among the citizens and to ensure their ability to conduct dangerous and demanding tasks. Emotions and the concept of family are [[taboo]]. Everyone is clad in identical white uniforms and has shaven heads to emphasize uniformity, except the police [[android (robot)|android]]s (who wear black) and robed monks. Instead of names, people have designations with three arbitrary letters (referred to as the \"prefix\") and four digits, shown on an identity badge worn at all times.\n\nAt their jobs in central video <!-- CCTV --> control centers, SEN 5241 and LUH 3417 keep surveillance on the city. LUH has a male roommate, THX 1138, who works in a factory producing android police officers. At the beginning of the story, THX finishes his shift while the loudspeakers urge the workers to \"increase safety\"\u2014and congratulate them for only losing 195 workers in the last period\u2014to the competing factory's 242. On the way home, he stops at a confession booth in a row of many, and relates his concerns and mumbles prayers about \"party\" and \"masses\", under the [[Jesus Christ]]-esque portrait of \"OMM 0000\". A soothing voice greets THX, and OMM ends every [[Confession (religion)|confession]] with a parting salutation: \"You are a true believer, blessings of the State, blessings of the masses. Work hard, increase production, prevent accidents and be happy.\"\n\nAt home, THX takes his drugs and watches [[Holography|holobroadcasts]] while engaging with a masturbatory device. LUH secretly substitutes pills in her possession for THX's medications, causing him to develop nausea, anxiety, and sexual desires. LUH and THX become involved romantically and have sex. THX later is confronted by SEN, who arranges THX as his new roommate, but THX files a complaint against SEN for the illegal housing mate change. Without drugs in his system, THX falters during a critical and hazardous phase of his job, and a control center engages a \"mind lock\" on THX which raises the level of danger. After the release of the mind lock, THX makes the necessary correction to that work phase. THX and LUH are arrested and THX undergoes drug therapy. He enjoys a brief reunion with LUH, disrupted shortly after she reveals her pregnancy.\n\nAt THX's trial, THX is sentenced to prison, alongside SEN. Most of the prisoners seem uninterested in escape, but eventually THX and SEN find an exit, and they are later joined by [[Holography|hologram]] actor SRT 5752, who starred in the holobroadcasts. During the escape, THX and SRT are separated from SEN. Chased by the police robots, THX and SRT are trapped in a control center, from which THX learns that LUH has been \"consumed\", and her name has been reassigned to [[fetus]] 66691 in a growth chamber. SEN eventually escapes to an area reserved for the monks of OMM, where a lone monk notices that SEN has no identification badge. SEN attacks him and later wanders into a child-rearing area, strikes up a conversation with children and sits aimlessly until police androids apprehend him. THX and SRT steal two cars, but SRT crashes his into a concrete pillar.\n\nPursued by two police androids on motorcycles, THX flees to the limits of the city and escapes into a ventilation shaft. The police androids pursue him on motorcycles along the shaft to an escape ladder, but are ordered by Central Command to cease pursuit, on the grounds that the expense of his capture exceeds their allocated budget. The guards inform THX that the surface is uninhabitable but he is undeterred and continues up the ventilation shaft. The city is then revealed to be entirely underground, and THX has escaped onto the surface, where he then witnesses the sun setting. A bird can be seen flying in the distance, indicating that at least some life is still inhabiting the planet's surface.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Christ Giving His Blessing.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Hans Memling]]'s ''Christ Giving His Blessing'' (1478) is used as the visual representation of the [[State religion|state-sanctioned]] [[deity]] OMM 0000.<ref>Compare with [https://www.imdb.com/media/rm2820911104/tt0066434?ref_=ttmi_mi_all_sf_10 this image] from [[IMDb]].</ref>]]\n* [[Robert Duvall]] as THX 1138 \n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as SEN 5241\n* [[Maggie McOmie]] as LUH 3417\n* [[Don Pedro Colley]] as the hologram SRT\n* [[Ian Wolfe]] as the old prisoner PTO\n* [[Marshall Efron]] as prisoner TWA\n* [[Sid Haig]] as prisoner NCH\n* [[John Pearce (actor)|John Pearce]] as prisoner DWY\n* [[James Wheaton]] as the voice of OMM 0000\n\n==Production==\n''THX 1138'' was the first film made in a planned seven-picture slate commissioned by Warner Bros. from the 1969 incarnation of [[American Zoetrope]].<ref>Pollock 1983, p. 88.</ref><ref>Louise Sweeney, \"The Movie Business is alive and well and living in San Francisco\", ''Show'', April 1970.</ref> Lucas wrote the initial script draft based on his earlier short film but Coppola and Lucas agreed it was unsatisfactory.
