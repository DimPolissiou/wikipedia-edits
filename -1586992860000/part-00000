{"title_page": "Dom-R\u00f6mer Project", "text_new": "The '''Dom-R\u00f6mer Project''' ({{lang-de|Dom-R\u00f6mer-Projekt}}) is an effort to remake the old city center, the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]] (old town) of [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]], which was severely damaged during World War II, in the style of the pre-war architecture.\n\nIt aims to give  the old town quarter between the [[R\u00f6merberg (Frankfurt)|R\u00f6merberg]] square and the [[Frankfurt Cathedral|Cathedral]] (Dom) new life. The old city had already been thoroughly changed in 1904 by hewing several aisles for wide streets into the medieval cluster of insalubrious houselets and small alley ways, clearing the way for a tramway line through the historic center.\n\nDue to the heavy [[bombing of Frankfurt am Main in World War II]] with many [[Timber framing|timber-framed]] buildings, most of the city's old town was destroyed. The efforts to rebuild parts of it began in the 1950s with the [[R\u00f6mer]] city hall, which was built as a modern office building behind the old fa\u00e7ade still standing after the war, and parts of the surrounding [[R\u00f6merberg (Frankfurt)|R\u00f6merberg]] square, building an underground [[multi-storey car park]], and on top of that the modern ''Technisches Rathaus''<ref>[[c:Category:Technisches_Rathaus|Photos of the former Technisches Rathaus Frankfurt]]</ref> (''Technical City Hall'', built 1972\u201374), whose fa\u00e7ade paid homage to the historic context of the city with the [[timber frame|timber frame design (''Fachwerk'')]] of the pre-war architecture, but within the context of \"[[Brutalist architecture]]\". The ''Historisches Museum'' (Museum of city history) was also built, including a cinema  In its entranceway, the museum displayed a model of the old center as it looked at the end of World War II; in ruins.\n\nA change of direction came in the 1980s when the {{lang|de|Ostzeile}} (Eastern row) or {{lang|de|Samstagsberg}} (Saturday hill), i.e. the line of houses opposite the {{lang|de|R\u00f6mer}} city hall, was built mimicking the old style,  with a problematic inclusion of concrete in the part wood construction.\n\nThe anti-brutalist movement continued in a public campaign to demolish the {{lang|de|Technische Rathaus}} and to make the old city look like before the war. This did finally succeed, the {{lang|de|Technisches Rathaus}} and the Museum of City History were demolished in 2010/2011, and the reconstruction of the old town core began.\n\nThe project is being built on top of a 1970s underground multi-storey car park and the [[U-Bahn Line B (Frankfurt U-Bahn)|U-Bahn Line B]] station underneath. Because of the demolition of the ''Technisches Rathaus'', the underground moved and the tunnel had to be monitored closely and corrected several times.\n\nIn total, 35 buildings were projected by 2018, with fifteen reconstructions of former old town buildings among them.<ref>[http://www.faz.net/artikel/C30214/stadtplanung-bedeutsame-altstadt-haeuser-werden-qualitaetvoll-rekonstruiert-30156409.html FAZ] - ''Bedeutsame Altstadt-H\u00e4user werden \u201equalit\u00e4tvoll\u201c rekonstruiert'' (German)</ref> From 28-30 September 2018, the old town quarter was officially inaugurated for the public.\n\nThe '''New Frankfurt Old Town''' (also known as the '''Dom-R\u00f6mer Quarter or Quarter''' ) is the center of the old town of Frankfurt am Main , which was reconstructed from 2012 to 2018 as part of a major urban development project. A 7,000 square meter property between R\u00f6merberg in the west and Domplatz in the east, delimited by Braubachstrasse in the north and the Schirn Kunsthalle in the south, was redesigned and developed under the name '''Dom-R\u00f6mer-Projekt''' . The Old Market combines a so-called ''coronation'' both forCoronation of the Roman-German kings and emperors important places. The area forms the core of the old town, which was considered one of the largest and most important half-timbered towns until the air raids in 1944 destroyed it, with its around 1250 half-timbered houses, most of which date from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.<ref>[[Manfred Gerner]], ''Fachwerk in Frankfurt am Main''. Frankfurter Sparkasse von 1822 (Polytechnische Gesellschaft) (Hrsg.), Verlag Waldemar Kramer, Frankfurt am Main 1979, {{ISBN|3-7829-0217-3}}.</ref> From the early 1970s until 2010 the property was complete with the municipal engineering department and the underground station Dom / R\u00f6mer built.\n\nIn the course of the Dom-R\u00f6mer project, the squares and streets of ''Alter Markt'' , H\u00fchnermarkt , Hinter dem L\u00e4mmchen and ''Neugasse'' with their historic plots and courtyards, including the Hof Rebstock am Markt and the Goldene L\u00e4mmchen , were largely restored.

Only a few buildings with historical buildings remained, and in the post-war period, other damaged buildings were also demolished, mostly in favor of \" car-friendly \" traffic planning. There were very few external reconstructions of buildings, the majority of the former old town was rebuilt in the style of the 1950s, largely leaving the historic street network behind.\n\nOnly the area between R\u00f6merberg and Dom remained after the rubble clearance wasteland , over whose development has long been debated. In the meantime, from 1953, archaeologists were able to uncover the remains of a Roman settlement , but also recent traces, especially from the Carolingian period, on the area under the high medieval layers . A centuries-long search for the origin of the city was therefore over, although the Royal Palatinate Frankfurt , which had previously only been handed down through documents, was not built by the legendary founder of Frankfurt, Charlemagne , but, according to findings, only by his son, Ludwig the Pious .\n\nIn 1966 construction began on the B section of the Frankfurt subway between the main train station and the Konstablerwache . The line of the new underground also led through the old town, with a station under the previously undeveloped area used as a parking lot between the cathedral and the Roman. When the Dom / R\u00f6mer underground station was built in 1970/71, due to the open construction method, it was accepted to destroy a large part of the oldest settlement floor in Frankfurt, which had not yet been archaeologically examined.\n\nSubsequently, after years of discussion on the site, the Technical City Hall was created in 1972\u20131974 as the seat of the technical offices of the city administration. Five old town houses on Braubachstrasse that had survived the war were demolished to excavate the construction pit. The building, built in the brutalist architectural style, represented with its enormous dimensions an urban dominant in the old town, which took no account of the other, let alone former, small-scale buildings in the area. The construction costs totalled DM 93 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wortprotokoll \u00fcber die 19. Plenarsitzung der Stadtverordnetenversammlung am Donnerstag, dem 15.

After the construction work was completed, the ceiling of the underground car park formed the new level, which was now about two meters above the historical floor level. The archaeological finds of the old town excavation from 1953, dating from the early days of Frankfurt, also initially removed, were preserved and made accessible to the public as an archaeological garden .\n\nIn 1994 the city of Frankfurt sold the Technical City Hall for DM 148 million to Deutsche Immobilien Leasing (DIL), a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank . At the same time, the building was leased back to the city with the option that the city could buy back the town hall for DM 135 million after the lease expired in 2006, a so-called sale-lease-back agreement.<ref name=\"faz.net-20041108\">{{cite web|title=Stadtplanung \u2013 Umbau statt Abri\u00df \u2013 neue Pl\u00e4ne f\u00fcr Technisches Rathaus in Frankfurt|periodical=faz.net|publisher=|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/rhein-main/frankfurt/stadtplanung-umbau-statt-abriss-neue-plaene-fuer-technisches-rathaus-in-frankfurt-1194573.html|url-status=|format=|access-date=2018-05-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|last=|date=2004-11-08|year=|language=|pages=|quote=}}</ref>\n\n== Planning History ==\n\n=== 2004\u20132006 ===\nIn 2004, the project developers ''Max Baum Immobilien'' and ''Gro\u00df & Partner,'' on behalf of the owner DIL, presented plans for a renovation of the 30-year-old technical town hall .

The following requirements were then set for the urban planning competition: small-scale buildings, the facades and roofs of which fit harmoniously into the old town, housing 20,000 m\u00b2 of gross floor space within the property boundaries of the Technical City Hall, overbuilding of the archaeological garden with 7,000 m\u00b2, continued use of the archaeological site Garden with the remains of the Royal Palatinate and the restoration of the old \"coronation path\" between the cathedral and the Roman. The name \"Coronation Trail\", an alternative name for the alley ''market''(also known as the ''Old Market'' ), which existed until 1945, arose from the fact that a total of 16 coronation ceremonies for Roman-German kings were held in Frankfurt from the 14th to the 18th century . 20 offices took part in the urban planning competition.<ref name=\"faz.net\">[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/rhein-main/architektur-abriss-des-technischen-rathauses-gesichert-1256606.html ''Abri\u00df des Technischen Rathauses gesichert.''] In: ''faz.net'', 25.

However, the winning design chosen by the Frankfurt office KSP Engel and Zimmermann in September 2005 met only a few of these requirements. The \"Coronation Trail\" was not laid out along the course of the market, which was even largely respected by the construction of the Technical Town Hall in 1972, but in a straight diagonal fromStone house to the cathedral tower. The overplanned areas of the technical town hall and the archaeological garden were once again occupied by large buildings; a residential complex with three courtyards was to be built on Braubachstrasse. In addition to a narrow building, a trapezoidal square was planned at the level of the archaeological garden, which, like the diagonal to the cathedral tower, had never existed in a similar form in Frankfurt's urban history.<ref>{{cite web|title=Neue Altstadt \u2013 KSP gewinnen Wettbewerb f\u00fcr Zentrum von Frankfurt (19.

The three-storey new building has a simple sandstone facade with six windows per floor, as with the predecessor.

The New Red House, first mentioned in 1322, probably dates back to the 14th century, the neighbor from the 16th century. The two houses were previously connected to each other inside, the New Red House had no separate entrance. With its ground floor structure consisting essentially of only three oak columns, which bore the entire weight of the three-story building above it, the New Red House was unique in the entire German half-timbered landscape and a well-known attraction far beyond the city. It was considered an outstanding example of medieval town planning and community spirit in the lively center of the old town. The Red House formed the passage to ''Tuchgaden'' and stood at the entrance to the butcher's quarter on the ''Lange Schirn'', at which the Frankfurter sausages have been sold since ancient times . The new building is also used by a butcher, which also has a sales stand in the Kleinmarkthalle .\n\nSouth of the new row of houses on the market, the ''town house'' consisting of five building parts was built ''on the market'' from 2013 to 2016 . The design comes from ''Meurer Architects'' , Frankfurt, with ''cba architectes'' , Luxembourg. The town house serves on the one hand to permanently preserve and make accessible the archaeological excavations of the Roman settlement on the cathedral hill and the imperial palace Franconofurd ; on the other hand as a meeting and event building. The end of the building complex to the west to the Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt is ''House 5'' , a residential building. It is based on the course of the historic alley of ''Tuchgaden'' .\n\nThere is a height difference of more than two meters between the street level of the reconstructed Old Market and today's Bendergasse along the Schirn. It is made clear in the section between the New Red House and the western entrance to the Dom / R\u00f6mer underground station by a wall and pergola made of sandstone. Due to the protruding rotunda of the Schirn, there was not enough space in this section for a southern row of houses opposite the Markt 26 to Markt 40 houses. Before the destruction narrow alleys chain in this section three ''Goldhutgasse'' , ''Drachengasse'' and ''sword-alley'' to the south, the south of it at the Five Finger Square met again.\n\n=== Rebstock-Hof ===\nThe east side of the Rebstock-Hof is the Haus am Dom , which was built from 2001 to 2004 through the renovation and expansion of the ''main customs office'' built by Werner Hebebrand in 1927 . Even though it was built as part of the New Frankfurt project , the main customs office already received a steep, curved gable roof as a tribute to the surrounding old town development, which was retained during the renovation. The house at the cathedral was extended at the southern end during the renovation, so that it protrudes a few meters from the historic building of the ''old market'' and comes closer to the reconstructed ''golden scales'' . The neighboring house ''Gro\u00dfer Rebstock''(Market 8), however, keeps the original parcel. The northern entrance to the Rebstock-Hof lies between the two buildings. The north side of it is the new building ''Rebstock-Hof 2'' (Markt 2, formerly Im Rebstock 2),<ref>{{cite web|title=Markt 2 (Rebstock-Hof 2)|periodical=Dom-R\u00f6mer GmbH|publisher=|url=https://www.domroemer.de/markt-2|url-status=|format=|access-date=2018-11-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|last=|date=|year=|language=|pages=|quote=}}</ref> a residential and commercial building by ''Meurer'' , Frankfurt. With a sand-colored plastered facade and slate roof, it looks like an extension to the house on the cathedral. At the western edge of the ''courtyard'' , the reconstruction ''Hof zum Rebstock'' (Braubachstrasse 15, formerly Im Rebstock 1) was built by Jourdan & M\u00fcller.)<ref>{{cite web|title=Hof zum Rebstock|periodical=Dom-R\u00f6mer GmbH|publisher=|url=https://www.domroemer.de/braubachstra\u00dfe-15|url-status=|format=|access-date=2018-11-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|last=|date=|year=|language=|pages=|quote=}}</ref> The building was built in the middle of the 18th century, using older components from the Gothic predecessor, first mentioned in 1392. Instead of the usual overhangs, the two half-timbered upper floors were given wooden arcades in front, also on the back to the inner courtyard on Neugasse. The gable roof is divided by a dwarf house with a Rhenish wave gable and two rows of dormer windows. The non-profit Frankfurt association runs a senior caf\u00e9 on the ground floor of the courtyard facing the vine .

The lines of argumentation often followed the same pattern as since the beginning of the reconstruction debate immediately after the destruction. Dieter Bartetzko compares the old town with an unfathomably deep fountain that draws on the myths of the past and gives life in the present. He recalls that the fountain on the chicken market was drilled as early as Roman times and that the Carolingian people were probably already aware that they lived on historical ground. This explains why Frankfurt was referred to in its first documentary mention in 794 as a ''locus celeber'' , a ''celebrated site'' . He describes the old town withNietzsche as an architectural palimpsest that always keeps the memory of the past in the minds of city dwellers, no matter how often it is overwritten. He explains this thesis using the example of the new building at ''Gro\u00dfer Rebstock'' (Markt 8) and the reconstruction at ''Braubachstra\u00dfe 21'' .

This is no coincidence, \"the reconstruction architecture in Germany is currently developing into a key medium of authoritarian, ethnic, historical revisionist rights\". It was \"scandalous that the initiative of a right-wing radical without any significant civil society resistance led to a slick neighborhood with seemingly seamless repeat architectures\". The new old town is \"a sub-complex heal-world building that reduces history to a one-dimensional concert of your dreams ... A history in which National Socialism, the German wars of aggression and the Holocaust still survive as anecdotes of an otherwise unbroken national history\".<ref>Stephan Tr\u00fcby: [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/neue-frankfurter-altstadt-durch-rechtsradikalen-initiiert-15531133.html Wir haben das Haus am rechten Fleck] In: [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung]], 8.

The debate about the old town has historical roots, since 1880 the design has always been struggling anew, with opponents and advocates of reconstructions not fitting in a right-left scheme. The reconstruction of the R\u00f6merberg-Ostzeile was based on an idea by the SPD Mayor Rudi Arndt . At the same time, Linke and Spontis had instigated the Frankfurt house fight , \u201csociologists see today as the beginning of a second homeland security movement\u201d.<ref name=\"db1\" /> Te \"storm of indignation\", which was triggered by the \"remarkably mediocre facade views\" of the winning design from the 2005 competition, was decisive for the reconstruction project of the new old town. \"Unlike the second-place design ... which u. a.

The debate alone leads to more people thinking about the destruction and its background. On the other hand, \u201cno one in Frankfurt felt reminded of the bomb war and Shoah when they saw the now demolished Technical Town Hall.\u201d Most critics mocked questions of taste. \"It is often said that this type of architecture is just a backdrop, untrue, inauthentic ...

One of the main benefits of the project is the recovery of Braubachstrasse. In the past 70 years, practically no urban space has emerged that has the quality of the new old town. The ensemble effect is even better than originally thought. Suddenly the architects are on the defensive and have a professional discussion about their health. One could learn from the project for future new building projects \u201cthat one needs more depth in dealing with architecture. It can no longer be about creating volume. You have to provide identification with special design elements. You have to put more effort into the details \u201d. He opposes criticism that you could have built many social housing for the same money; this thinking is \"totally limited\". \u201cIt was a sensible investment, it brings the city forward. The foreigners in particular, who we led over the construction site, were of the opinion that the people of Frankfurt should have remembered their history as a European metropolis much earlier. \u201dHe personally likes the two new buildingsBest with ''the Three Romans'' (Markt 40) and ''Gro\u00dfer Rebstock'' (Markt 8); the least successful are the ''Goldene Schachtel'' (Markt 32) and her neighbor ''Alter Burggraf'' .<ref>''Im Gespr\u00e4ch: Michael Guntersdorf, Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer der Dom-R\u00f6mer GmbH'', Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 27.

Frankfurt as a possibility of total idyll.\" He then sits down First of all, basically with architectural reconstructions, using the example of the Dresden Zwinger , the Knochenhaueramtshaus and the Warsaw Old Townwho kept the memory of their destruction in different ways. He recalls an earlier article that he wrote about the planned demolition of the Technical Town Hall and reconstructions in the old town for Die Zeit , and in which he made fun of the \u201chalf-timbered longing\u201d, the \u201clonging for a city like this looks like the cities that Frankfurt might like to visit as tourists \u201d. <ref>{{citation|surname1=Andreas Maier|periodical=[[Die Zeit]]|title=Fachwerk f\u00fcr Alle!|date=2006-05-18|language=German|url=https://www.zeit.de/2006/21/Archi_Frankfurt_xml/komplettansicht|access-date= 2018-11-23\n}}</ref> After a tour of the construction site, however, he was impressed by the quality of the construction and also the architecture, and the enthusiasm of the craftsmen. He states: \u201cValuable materials, traditional craftsmanship, everything at its finest. With its new old town, which is also in the ManufactumCatalog, Frankfurt makes itself a gift. And there is the Belvederchen as praline on top. \u201dIn addition to the Belvederchen, he is particularly impressed by the ''Sch\u00f6nau'' house (Market 10) -\u201c a very narrow thing with a slate facade pulled down deep\u2026 and a slightly convex curvature of the elegantly stepped front.

Only a few buildings with historical buildings remained, and in the post-war period, other damaged buildings were also demolished, mostly in favor of \" car-friendly \" traffic planning. There were very few external reconstructions of buildings, the majority of the former old town was rebuilt in the style of the 1950s, largely leaving the historic street network behind.\n\nOnly the area between R\u00f6merberg and Dom remained after the rubble clearance wasteland , over whose development has long been debated. In the meantime, from 1953, archaeologists were able to uncover the remains of a Roman settlement , but also recent traces, especially from the Carolingian period, on the area under the high medieval layers . A centuries-long search for the origin of the city was therefore over, although the Royal Palatinate Frankfurt , which had previously only been handed down through documents, was not built by the legendary founder of Frankfurt, Charlemagne , but, according to findings, only by his son, Ludwig the Pious .\n\nIn 1966 construction began on the B section of the Frankfurt subway between the main train station and the Konstablerwache . The line of the new underground also led through the old town, with a station under the previously undeveloped area used as a parking lot between the cathedral and the Roman. When the Dom / R\u00f6mer underground station was built in 1970/71, due to the open construction method, it was accepted to destroy a large part of the oldest settlement floor in Frankfurt, which had not yet been archaeologically examined.\n\nSubsequently, after years of discussion on the site, the Technical City Hall was created in 1972\u20131974 as the seat of the technical offices of the city administration. Five old town houses on Braubachstrasse that had survived the war were demolished to excavate the construction pit. The building, built in the brutalist architectural style, represented with its enormous dimensions an urban dominant in the old town, which took no account of the other, let alone former, small-scale buildings in the area. The construction costs totalled DM 93 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wortprotokoll \u00fcber die 19. Plenarsitzung der Stadtverordnetenversammlung am Donnerstag, dem 15.

After the construction work was completed, the ceiling of the underground car park formed the new level, which was now about two meters above the historical floor level. The archaeological finds of the old town excavation from 1953, dating from the early days of Frankfurt, also initially removed, were preserved and made accessible to the public as an archaeological garden .\n\nIn 1994 the city of Frankfurt sold the Technical City Hall for DM 148 million to Deutsche Immobilien Leasing (DIL), a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank . At the same time, the building was leased back to the city with the option that the city could buy back the town hall for DM 135 million after the lease expired in 2006, a so-called sale-lease-back agreement.<ref name=\"faz.net-20041108\">{{cite web|title=Stadtplanung \u2013 Umbau statt Abri\u00df \u2013 neue Pl\u00e4ne f\u00fcr Technisches Rathaus in Frankfurt|periodical=faz.net|publisher=|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/rhein-main/frankfurt/stadtplanung-umbau-statt-abriss-neue-plaene-fuer-technisches-rathaus-in-frankfurt-1194573.html|url-status=|format=|access-date=2018-05-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|last=|date=2004-11-08|year=|language=|pages=|quote=}}</ref>\n\n== Planning History ==\n\n=== 2004\u20132006 ===\nIn 2004, the project developers ''Max Baum Immobilien'' and ''Gro\u00df & Partner,'' on behalf of the owner DIL, presented plans for a renovation of the 30-year-old technical town hall .

The following requirements were then set for the urban planning competition: small-scale buildings, the facades and roofs of which fit harmoniously into the old town, housing 20,000 m\u00b2 of gross floor space within the property boundaries of the Technical City Hall, overbuilding of the archaeological garden with 7,000 m\u00b2, continued use of the archaeological site Garden with the remains of the Royal Palatinate and the restoration of the old \"coronation path\" between the cathedral and the Roman. The name \"Coronation Trail\", an alternative name for the alley ''market''(also known as the ''Old Market'' ), which existed until 1945, arose from the fact that a total of 16 coronation ceremonies for Roman-German kings were held in Frankfurt from the 14th to the 18th century . 20 offices took part in the urban planning competition.<ref name=\"faz.net\">[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/rhein-main/architektur-abriss-des-technischen-rathauses-gesichert-1256606.html ''Abri\u00df des Technischen Rathauses gesichert.''] In: ''faz.net'', 25.

However, the winning design chosen by the Frankfurt office KSP Engel and Zimmermann in September 2005 met only a few of these requirements. The \"Coronation Trail\" was not laid out along the course of the market, which was even largely respected by the construction of the Technical Town Hall in 1972, but in a straight diagonal fromStone house to the cathedral tower. The overplanned areas of the technical town hall and the archaeological garden were once again occupied by large buildings; a residential complex with three courtyards was to be built on Braubachstrasse. In addition to a narrow building, a trapezoidal square was planned at the level of the archaeological garden, which, like the diagonal to the cathedral tower, had never existed in a similar form in Frankfurt's urban history.<ref>{{cite web|title=Neue Altstadt \u2013 KSP gewinnen Wettbewerb f\u00fcr Zentrum von Frankfurt (19.

The New Red House, first mentioned in 1322, probably dates back to the 14th century, the neighbor from the 16th century. The two houses were previously connected to each other inside, the New Red House had no separate entrance. With its ground floor structure consisting essentially of only three oak columns, which bore the entire weight of the three-story building above it, the New Red House was unique in the entire German half-timbered landscape and a well-known attraction far beyond the city. It was considered an outstanding example of medieval town planning and community spirit in the lively center of the old town. The Red House formed the passage to ''Tuchgaden'' and stood at the entrance to the butcher's quarter on the ''Lange Schirn'', at which the Frankfurter sausages have been sold since ancient times . The new building is also used by a butcher, which also has a sales stand in the Kleinmarkthalle .\n\nSouth of the new row of houses on the market, the ''town house'' consisting of five building parts was built ''on the market'' from 2013 to 2016 . The design comes from ''Meurer Architects'' , Frankfurt, with ''cba architectes'' , Luxembourg. The town house serves on the one hand to permanently preserve and make accessible the archaeological excavations of the Roman settlement on the cathedral hill and the imperial palace Franconofurd ; on the other hand as a meeting and event building. The end of the building complex to the west to the Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt is ''House 5'' , a residential building. It is based on the course of the historic alley of ''Tuchgaden'' .\n\nThere is a height difference of more than two meters between the street level of the reconstructed Old Market and today's Bendergasse along the Schirn. It is made clear in the section between the New Red House and the western entrance to the Dom / R\u00f6mer underground station by a wall and pergola made of sandstone. Due to the protruding rotunda of the Schirn, there was not enough space in this section for a southern row of houses opposite the Markt 26 to Markt 40 houses. Before the destruction narrow alleys chain in this section three ''Goldhutgasse'' , ''Drachengasse'' and ''sword-alley'' to the south, the south of it at the Five Finger Square met again.\n\n=== Rebstock-Hof ===\nThe east side of the Rebstock-Hof is the Haus am Dom , which was built from 2001 to 2004 through the renovation and expansion of the ''main customs office'' built by Werner Hebebrand in 1927 . Even though it was built as part of the New Frankfurt project , the main customs office already received a steep, curved gable roof as a tribute to the surrounding old town development, which was retained during the renovation. The house at the cathedral was extended at the southern end during the renovation, so that it protrudes a few meters from the historic building of the ''old market'' and comes closer to the reconstructed ''golden scales'' . The neighboring house ''Gro\u00dfer Rebstock''(Market 8), however, keeps the original parcel. The northern entrance to the Rebstock-Hof lies between the two buildings. The north side of it is the new building ''Rebstock-Hof 2'' (Markt 2, formerly Im Rebstock 2),<ref>{{cite web|title=Markt 2 (Rebstock-Hof 2)|periodical=Dom-R\u00f6mer GmbH|publisher=|url=https://www.domroemer.de/markt-2|url-status=|format=|access-date=2018-11-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|last=|date=|year=|language=|pages=|quote=}}</ref> a residential and commercial building by ''Meurer'' , Frankfurt. With a sand-colored plastered facade and slate roof, it looks like an extension to the house on the cathedral. At the western edge of the ''courtyard'' , the reconstruction ''Hof zum Rebstock'' (Braubachstrasse 15, formerly Im Rebstock 1) was built by Jourdan & M\u00fcller.)<ref>{{cite web|title=Hof zum Rebstock|periodical=Dom-R\u00f6mer GmbH|publisher=|url=https://www.domroemer.de/braubachstra\u00dfe-15|url-status=|format=|access-date=2018-11-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|last=|date=|year=|language=|pages=|quote=}}</ref> The building was built in the middle of the 18th century, using older components from the Gothic predecessor, first mentioned in 1392. Instead of the usual overhangs, the two half-timbered upper floors were given wooden arcades in front, also on the back to the inner courtyard on Neugasse. The gable roof is divided by a dwarf house with a Rhenish wave gable and two rows of dormer windows. The non-profit Frankfurt association runs a senior caf\u00e9 on the ground floor of the courtyard facing the vine .

[[Dieter Bartetzko]] vergleicht die Altstadt mit einem unergr\u00fcndlich tiefen Brunnen, der aus den Mythen der Vergangenheit sch\u00f6pfe und in der Gegenwart Leben spende. Er erinnert daran, dass der Brunnen auf dem H\u00fchnermarkt bereits in der R\u00f6merzeit gebohrt wurde und wahrscheinlich schon den Menschen der Karolingerzeit bewusst war, dass sie auf historischem Boden lebten. Das erkl\u00e4re, warum Frankfurt schon in seiner ersten urkundlichen Erw\u00e4hnung 794 als ''locus celeber'', als ''gefeierte St\u00e4tte'', bezeichnet werde. Die Altstadt bezeichnet er mit [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] als architektonischen [[Palimpsest]], der die Erinnerung an das Vergangene immer im Bewusstsein der St\u00e4dter bewahre, egal wie oft er \u00fcberschrieben werde. Diese These erl\u00e4utert er am Beispiel des Neubaus ''Gro\u00dfer Rebstock'' (Markt 8) und der Rekonstruktion ''Braubachstra\u00dfe 21''. Dagegen sei das Technische Rathaus, \u201eals Betonmoloch mitten in die zuvor geschlossene H\u00e4userzeile der Braubachstra\u00dfe gerammt\u201c, jahrzehntelang ein provokanter und ignoranter Fremdk\u00f6rper im Stadtgef\u00fcge geblieben.

Bei dem Projekt sei es im Kern um Stadtreparatur gegangen. Ein Hauptgewinn des Projekts sei die Wiedergewinnung der Braubachstra\u00dfe. In den vergangenen 70 Jahren sei praktisch kein Stadtraum entstanden, der die Qualit\u00e4t der neuen Altstadt h\u00e4tte. Die Ensemblewirkung sei noch besser als urspr\u00fcnglich gedacht. Pl\u00f6tzlich seien die Architekten in der Defensive und f\u00fchrten eine berufsst\u00e4ndische Befindlichkeitsdiskussion. Man k\u00f6nne aus dem Projekt f\u00fcr k\u00fcnftige Neubauprojekte lernen, \u201edass man mehr Tiefgang in der Besch\u00e4ftigung mit der Architektur braucht. Es darf nicht mehr darum gehen, nur Volumen zu schaffen. Man muss mit besonderen Gestaltungselementen f\u00fcr Identifikation sorgen. Man muss sich mehr M\u00fche mit den Details geben\u201c. Er wendet sich gegen Kritik, dass man f\u00fcr das gleiche Geld viele Sozialwohnungen h\u00e4tte bauen k\u00f6nnen; dieses Denken sei \u201etotal beschr\u00e4nkt\u201c. \u201eDas war eine sinnvolle Investition, sie bringt die Stadt nach vorne. Gerade die Ausl\u00e4nder, die wir \u00fcber die Baustelle gef\u00fchrt haben, waren der Meinung, dass sich die Frankfurter schon viel fr\u00fcher auf ihre Geschichte als europ\u00e4ische Metropole h\u00e4tten besinnen sollen.\u201c Pers\u00f6nlich gefallen ihm die beiden Neubauten ''Zu den Drei R\u00f6mern'' (Markt 40) und ''Gro\u00dfer Rebstock'' (Markt 8) am besten; am wenigsten gelungen seien die ''Goldene Schachtel'' (Markt 32) und ihr Nachbar ''Alter Burggraf''.<ref>''Im Gespr\u00e4ch: Michael Guntersdorf, Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer der Dom-R\u00f6mer GmbH'', Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 27.

The old city had already been thoroughly changed in 1904 by hewing several aisles for wide streets into the medieval cluster of insalubrious houselets and small alley ways, clearing the way for a tramway line through the historic center.\n\nDue to the heavy [[bombing of Frankfurt am Main in World War II]] with many [[Timber framing|timber-framed]] buildings, most of the city's old town was destroyed. The efforts to rebuild parts of it began in the 1950s with the [[R\u00f6mer]] city hall, which was built as a modern office building behind the old fa\u00e7ade still standing after the war, and parts of the surrounding [[R\u00f6merberg (Frankfurt)|R\u00f6merberg]] square, building an underground [[multi-storey car park]], and on top of that the modern ''Technisches Rathaus''<ref>[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Technisches_Rathaus Photos of the former Technisches Rathaus Frankfurt]</ref> (''Technical City Hall'', built 1972\u201374), whose fa\u00e7ade paid homage to the historic context of the city with the [[timber frame|timber frame design (''Fachwerk'')]] of the pre-war architecture, but within the context of \"[[Brutalist architecture]]\". The ''Historisches Museum'' (Museum of city history) was also built, including a cinema  In its entranceway, the museum displayed a model of the old center as it looked at the end of World War II; in ruins.\n\nA change of direction came in the 1980s when the {{lang|de|Ostzeile}} (Eastern row) or {{lang|de|Samstagsberg}} (Saturday hill), i.e. the line of houses opposite the {{lang|de|R\u00f6mer}} city hall, was built mimicking the old style,  with a problematic inclusion of concrete in the part wood construction.\n\nThe anti-brutalist movement continued in a public campaign to demolish the {{lang|de|Technische Rathaus}} and to make the old city look like before the war. This did finally succeed, the {{lang|de|Technisches Rathaus}} and the Museum of City History were demolished in 2010/2011, and the reconstruction of the old town core began.\n\nThe project is being built on top of a 1970s underground multi-storey car park and the [[U-Bahn Line B (Frankfurt U-Bahn)|U-Bahn Line B]] station underneath. Because of the demolition of the ''Technisches Rathaus'', the underground moved and the tunnel had to be monitored closely and corrected several times.\n\nIn total, 35 buildings were projected by 2018, with fifteen reconstructions of former old town buildings among them.<ref>[http://www.faz.net/artikel/C30214/stadtplanung-bedeutsame-altstadt-haeuser-werden-qualitaetvoll-rekonstruiert-30156409.html FAZ] - ''Bedeutsame Altstadt-H\u00e4user werden \u201equalit\u00e4tvoll\u201c rekonstruiert'' (German)</ref> From 28-30 September 2018, the old town quarter was officially inaugurated for the public.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Dietrich-Wilhelm Dreysse, Volkmar Hepp, Bj\u00f6rn Wissenbach, Peter Bierling: ''Planung Bereich Dom - R\u00f6mer.

It is [[Walpurgis Night]], and in spite of the hotelier's warning to not return late, the young man later leaves his carriage and wanders toward the direction of an abandoned \"unholy\" village. As the carriage departs with the frightened and superstitious driver, a tall and thin stranger scares the horses at the crest of a hill.\n\nAfter a few hours, as he reaches a desolate valley, it begins to snow; as a dark storm gathers intensity, the Englishman takes shelter in a grove of [[cypress]] and [[Taxus baccata|yew]] trees. The Englishman's location is soon illuminated by moonlight to be a cemetery, and he finds himself before a marble tomb with a large iron stake driven through the roof, the inscription reads: \"Countess Dolingen of [[Graz|Gratz]] / in [[Styria]] / sought and found death / 1801\". This inscription is now recognised as being a tribute to [[Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu]], one of Stoker's fellow predecessor in terms of vampire writing. Le Fanu's  [[Carmilla]] (1872) deals with a protagonist showing resemblances with Countess Dolingen. [[Carmilla]]'s main protagonist is ultimately revealed to Countess Millarca Karnestein, a vampire.<ref>Robert Tracy, \"Introduction\" ''In a Glass Darkly''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993: p.xxi</ref> Inscribed on the back of the tomb, graven in great Russian letters, is: \"The dead travel fast\", which was an ode to the fable \"[[Lenore (ballad)|Lenore]]\".\n\nThe Englishman is disturbed to be in such a place on such a night and as the storm breaks anew, he is forced by pelting hail to shelter in the doorway of the tomb. As he does so, the bronze door of the tomb opens under his weight and a flash of forked lightning shows the interior - and a \"beautiful woman with rounded cheeks and red lips, seemingly sleeping on a bier\". The force of the following thunder peal throws the Englishman from the doorway (experienced as \"being grasped as by the hand of a giant\") as another lightning bolt strikes the iron spike, destroying the tomb and the now screaming woman inside.\n\nThe Englishman's troubles are not quite over, as he painfully regains his senses from the ordeal, he is repulsed by a feeling of loathing which he connects to a warm feeling in his chest and a licking at this throat. The Englishman summons courage to peek through his eyelashes and discovers a gigantic [[wolf]] with flaming eyes is attending him.\n\nMilitary horsemen are the next to wake the semi-conscious man, chasing the wolf away with torches and guns. Some horsemen return to the main party and the Englishman after the chase, reporting that they had not found 'him' and that the Englishman's animal is \"[[werewolf|a wolf - and yet not a wolf]]\".\nThey also note that blood is on the ruined tomb, yet the Englishman's neck is unbloodied. \"See comrades, the wolf has been lying on him and keeping his blood warm\". Later, the Englishman finds his neck pained when a horseman comments on it.\n\nWhen the Englishman is taken back to his hotel by the men, he is informed that it is none other than his expectant host Dracula that has alerted his employees, the horsemen, of \"dangers from snow and wolves and night\" in a telegram received by the hotel during the time the Englishman was away.\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2010}}\n*[[David O.

However, there are numerous references in the [''Dracula''] Manuscript to some version of the tale eventually published as \"Dracula's Guest.\" Most likely, a different draft \u2014 one that identified the narrator as Harker \u2014 was included in ... an early version of [the ''Dracula'' manuscript]. It may be that Stoker's publisher requested that the book be shortened, or the publisher (or Stoker) may have felt that the \"stylistic\" aspects of the narrative were more important than its veracity. For whatever reason, the material was excised, and only later did Stoker return to the material and work it into its published form.<ref>Klinger, page 515, note 27.</ref>}}Many experts believe, the deleted opening was based on the Austrian princess [[Eleonore von Schwarzenberg]]<ref>{{Citation |title=Smithsonian Channel Documentaries 2010x01 \"The Vampire Princess\" |url=https://trakt.tv/shows/smithsonian-channel-documentaries/seasons/2010/episodes/1 |access-date=2019-01-08}}</ref>, discovered in the tv-documentary \"Vampire Princess\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://contentsales.orf.at/show_content.php?hid=14&sid=75&filter=364&sub_filter=0&mpi_id=21794 |title=ORF-Enterprise - Catalogue |website=contentsales.orf.at |access-date=2019-01-08}}</ref>.

It is [[Walpurgis Night]], and in spite of the hotelier's warning to not return late, the young man later leaves his carriage and wanders toward the direction of an abandoned \"unholy\" village. As the carriage departs with the frightened and superstitious driver, a tall and thin stranger scares the horses at the crest of a hill.\n\nAfter a few hours, as he reaches a desolate valley, it begins to snow; as a dark storm gathers intensity, the Englishman takes shelter in a grove of [[cypress]] and [[Taxus baccata|yew]] trees. The Englishman's location is soon illuminated by moonlight to be a cemetery, and he finds himself before a marble tomb with a large iron stake driven through the roof, the inscription reads: \"Countess Dolingen of [[Graz|Gratz]] / in [[Styria]] / sought and found death / 1801\". This inscription is now recognised as being a tribute to [[Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu]], one of Stoker's fellow predecessor in terms of vampire writing. Le Fanu's  [[Carmilla]] (1872) deals with a protagonist showing resemblances with Countess Dolingen. [[Carmilla]]'s main protagonist is ultimately revealed to Countess Millarca Karnestein, a vampire.<ref>Robert Tracy, \"Introduction\" ''In a Glass Darkly''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993: p.xxi</ref> Inscribed on the back of the tomb, graven in great Russian letters, is: \"The dead travel fast\", which was an ode to the fable \"[[Lenore (ballad)|Lenore]]\".\n\nThe Englishman is disturbed to be in such a place on such a night and as the storm breaks anew, he is forced by pelting hail to shelter in the doorway of the tomb. As he does so, the bronze door of the tomb opens under his weight and a flash of forked lightning shows the interior - and a \"beautiful woman with rounded cheeks and red lips, seemingly sleeping on a bier\". The force of the following thunder peal throws the Englishman from the doorway (experienced as \"being grasped as by the hand of a giant\") as another lightning bolt strikes the iron spike, destroying the tomb and the now screaming woman inside.\n\nThe Englishman's troubles are not quite over, as he painfully regains his senses from the ordeal, he is repulsed by a feeling of loathing which he connects to a warm feeling in his chest and a licking at this throat. The Englishman summons courage to peek through his eyelashes and discovers a gigantic [[wolf]] with flaming eyes is attending him.\n\nMilitary horsemen are the next to wake the semi-conscious man, chasing the wolf away with torches and guns. Some horsemen return to the main party and the Englishman after the chase, reporting that they had not found 'him' and that the Englishman's animal is \"[[werewolf|a wolf - and yet not a wolf]]\".\nThey also note that blood is on the ruined tomb, yet the Englishman's neck is unbloodied. \"See comrades, the wolf has been lying on him and keeping his blood warm\". Later, the Englishman finds his neck pained when a horseman comments on it.\n\nWhen the Englishman is taken back to his hotel by the men, he is informed that it is none other than his expectant host Dracula that has alerted his employees, the horsemen, of \"dangers from snow and wolves and night\" in a telegram received by the hotel during the time the Englishman was away.\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2010}}\n*[[David O.

The vehicle is divided into two main compartments: power pack compartment and crew compartment.\n\nThe power pack compartment occupies the front and central parts of the hull and is separated from the crew compartment by an air-tight vibration/noise-insulating bulkhead. The compartment accommodates the engine with its operation support systems, transmission, main elements of the steering system, air system, braking system, and components of the air conditioning system and heating system.\n\nThe crew compartment occupies the central and rear parts of the hull and is used for accommodating the crew, installing the assemblies required for operation of the crew, and placing various equipment, ammunition, and SPTA. The crew compartment is divided into the driving compartment, fighting compartment, and troop compartment.\n\nThe driving compartment is located in the front part of the crew compartment and comprises the driver\u2019s station fitted with armoured personnel carrier controls, and the commander\u2019s station fitted with communications devices and navigation equipment.\n\nThe fighting compartment is located in the central part of the crew compartment and comprises the gunner\u2019s station fitted with machine gun laying and control devices.\n\nThe troop compartment is located in the rear part of the crew compartment and comprises seats for troops, periscopic vision blocks, and firing ports to enable the troops to carry out observation and to fire small arms.\n\nThe crew compartment accommodates the filtering and ventilating unit and the main components of the ventilation, heating, and air conditioning systems.\n\n===Protection===\nThe armoured hull of the personnel carrier provides protection of the crew, troops, and internal equipment against small arms fire, anti-tank mines, and effects of the mass destruction weapons.\n\nThe hull is made of armour and provides protection against 7.62&nbsp;mm armour-piercing bullets. The bottom of the armoured personnel carrier is made of armour steel in a cylindrical shape and provides protection against mines. The armoured glass installed on the armoured personnel carrier provides protection that is identical to the protection provided by the main armour of the vehicle.\n\nThe design of the hull makes it possible to install additional protection array in the form of removable components that will provide protection against larger calibre bullets and more powerful mines.\n\nThe vehicle is fitted with a filtering and ventilating unit, which is intended to purify the ambient air in order to remove toxic agents, radioactive dust, and biological warfare aerosols; to feed the purified air into the crew compartment; to create [[Overpressure (CBRN protection)|overpressure]] in the crew compartment; and to remove firing powder gases from the crew compartment.\n\n===Armament===\nThe main armament is a [[12.7\u00d7108mm|12.7]] remote-controlled anti-aircraft [[NSV machine gun|NSVT]] machine gun that can be elevated within a range of - 3\u00b0 to +68\u00b0 and traversed through a full 360\u00b0. The machine gun is fitted with a PZU-7 optical monocular periscopic sight, which provides a magnification of 1.2 and a field of view of 50\u00b0.\n\n===Observations Devices===\nThe surrounding terrain can be observed through the armoured glass windows and the day-time observation devices. The driver can also use the TVN-5 biocular, periscopic, active/passive night vision device in order to drive the armoured personnel carrier under poor visibility conditions or at night.\n\n===Power Pack===\nThe vehicle can be fitted with either [[Iveco]] 8142.38.11 engine or [[Deutz AG|Deutz]] BF 4M 1013 FC engine. Each of the two is a four-stroke four-cylinder turbocharged diesel engine with intermediate cooling of turbocharged air.<ref>\u043c\u0430\u0439\u043e\u0440 \u0410. \u0411\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432. \u041d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u0435\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0431\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\u044b // \"\u0417\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\", \u2116 11 (812), \u043d\u043e\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c 2014. \u0441\u0442\u0440.56</ref>\n\n====Power Transmission====\nThe power transmission is mechanical. It provides a constant transmission of torque from the engine to all the wheels. The power transmission comprises the following: gearbox, transfer box, wheel reducers, front and rear main transmissions, and cardan shaft.\n\n===Communications and Navigation Devices===\nFor external communications, the vehicle is fitted with the R-173M ultra-short wave, receiving/transmitting radio set and R-173PM radio receiver operating in a frequency range of 30,000-75,999&nbsp;kHz; for internal communications, with the AVSK-1 crew intercom system.\n\nThe vehicle's radio navigation equipment continuously determines the coordinates of location, the time and the vector of absolute travelling speed of the vehicle by using radio signals of the [[GLONASS]] and GPS NAVSTAR systems.\n\n===Crew Comfort Support Systems===\nThe vehicle is fitted with a ventilation system, heating system, and air conditioning system.\n\nThe ventilation system with forced air circulation is intended to supply fresh air into the crew compartment and to remove powder gases when the troops fire their small arms when the filtering and ventilating unit is switched off.\n\nThe heating system of the liquid type provides crew comfort in cold weather due to the heating of the air in the crew compartment and blowing the heated air to the window glasses.\n\nThe air conditioning system provides crew comfort in hot weather due to the cooling or ventilation in the armoured personnel carrier. The system ensures the following:\n* cooling of air at ambient air temperatures of 20 to 55 degrees Celsius\n* ventilation of air without cooling or heating it in the entire [[operating temperature]] range of the armoured personnel carrier\n\n===Special Equipment===\nThe vehicle's special equipment includes a central tyre inflation system and a winch.\nThe central tyre inflation system provides automatic regulation of preselected tyre pressure and makes it possible to check and change tyre pressure from the driver\u2019s station to allow for road conditions.\n\nThe WARN XD 9000i winch is intended for self-recovery of the armoured personnel carrier, as well as for recovery of other stuck-in vehicles of the same weight class.\n\n==Variants==\n* '''Dozor-A''' - unarmored off-road general purpose vehicle<ref>\u0410. \u0413\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0445\u0430.

The vehicle is divided into two main compartments: power pack compartment and crew compartment.\n\nThe power pack compartment occupies the front and central parts of the hull and is separated from the crew compartment by an air-tight vibration/noise-insulating bulkhead. The compartment accommodates the engine with its operation support systems, transmission, main elements of the steering system, air system, braking system, and components of the air conditioning system and heating system.\n\nThe crew compartment occupies the central and rear parts of the hull and is used for accommodating the crew, installing the assemblies required for operation of the crew, and placing various equipment, ammunition, and SPTA. The crew compartment is divided into the driving compartment, fighting compartment, and troop compartment.\n\nThe driving compartment is located in the front part of the crew compartment and comprises the driver\u2019s station fitted with armoured personnel carrier controls, and the commander\u2019s station fitted with communications devices and navigation equipment.\n\nThe fighting compartment is located in the central part of the crew compartment and comprises the gunner\u2019s station fitted with machine gun laying and control devices.\n\nThe troop compartment is located in the rear part of the crew compartment and comprises seats for troops, periscopic vision blocks, and firing ports to enable the troops to carry out observation and to fire small arms.\n\nThe crew compartment accommodates the filtering and ventilating unit and the main components of the ventilation, heating, and air conditioning systems.\n\n===Protection===\nThe armoured hull of the personnel carrier provides protection of the crew, troops, and internal equipment against small arms fire, anti-tank mines, and effects of the mass destruction weapons.\n\nThe hull is made of armour and provides protection against 7.62&nbsp;mm armour-piercing bullets. The bottom of the armoured personnel carrier is made of armour steel in a cylindrical shape and provides protection against mines. The armoured glass installed on the armoured personnel carrier provides protection that is identical to the protection provided by the main armour of the vehicle.\n\nThe design of the hull makes it possible to install additional protection array in the form of removable components that will provide protection against larger calibre bullets and more powerful mines.\n\nThe vehicle is fitted with a filtering and ventilating unit, which is intended to purify the ambient air in order to remove toxic agents, radioactive dust, and biological warfare aerosols; to feed the purified air into the crew compartment; to create [[Overpressure (CBRN protection)|overpressure]] in the crew compartment; and to remove firing powder gases from the crew compartment.\n\n===Armament===\nThe main armament is a [[12.7\u00d7108mm|12.7]] remote-controlled anti-aircraft [[NSV machine gun|NSVT]] machine gun that can be elevated within a range of - 3\u00b0 to +68\u00b0 and traversed through a full 360\u00b0. The machine gun is fitted with a PZU-7 optical monocular periscopic sight, which provides a magnification of 1.2 and a field of view of 50\u00b0.\n\n===Observations Devices===\nThe surrounding terrain can be observed through the armoured glass windows and the day-time observation devices. The driver can also use the TVN-5 biocular, periscopic, active/passive night vision device in order to drive the armoured personnel carrier under poor visibility conditions or at night.\n\n===Power Pack===\nThe vehicle can be fitted with either [[Iveco]] 8142.38.11 engine or [[Deutz AG|Deutz]] BF 4M 1013 FC engine.

It monitors the amplification of a targeted [[DNA]] molecule during the PCR (i.e., in real time), not at its end, as in conventional PCR. Real-time PCR can be used quantitatively (quantitative real-time PCR) and semi-quantitatively (i.e., above/below a certain amount of DNA molecules) (semi-quantitative real-time PCR).\n\nTwo common methods for the detection of PCR products in real-time PCR are (1) non-specific [[fluorescent dye]]s that [[Intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalate]] with any double-stranded DNA and (2) sequence-specific [[DNA probe]]s consisting of [[oligonucleotide]]s that are labelled with a [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] reporter, which permits detection only after [[nucleic acid hybridisation|hybridization]] of the probe with its complementary sequence.\n\nThe [[Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments]] (MIQE) guidelines propose that the abbreviation ''qPCR'' be used for quantitative real-time PCR and that ''RT-qPCR'' be used for reverse transcription\u2013qPCR.<ref name=\"Bustin2009\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Bustin SA, Benes V, Garson JA, Hellemans J, Huggett J, Kubista M, Mueller R, Nolan T, Pfaffl MW, Shipley GL, Vandesompele J, Wittwer CT|title=The MIQE guidelines: minimum information for publication of quantitative real-time PCR experiments|journal=Clinical Chemistry|volume=55|issue=4|pages=611\u2013622|year=2009|pmid=19246619|doi=10.1373/clinchem.2008.112797}}</ref> The acronym \"RT-PCR\" commonly denotes [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] and not real-time PCR, but not all authors adhere to this convention.<ref name=\"Logan et al.\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Logan|editor1-first=Julie|editor2-last=Edwards|editor2-first=Kirstin|editor3-last=Saunders|editor3-first=Nick|year=2009|title=Real-Time PCR: Current Technology and Applications|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn=978-1-904455-39-4|last-author-amp=yes}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Molecular Beacons.jpg|thumb|Real time PCR uses [[fluorophore]]s in order to detect levels of [[gene expression]].]]\nCells in all organisms regulate [[gene expression]] by turnover of gene transcripts (single stranded [[RNA]]): The amount of an expressed gene in a cell can be measured by the number of copies of an RNA transcript of that gene present in a sample. In order to robustly detect and quantify gene expression from small amounts of RNA, amplification of the gene transcript is necessary. The [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) is a common method for amplifying DNA; for RNA-based PCR the RNA sample is first reverse-transcribed to [[complementary DNA]] (cDNA) with [[reverse transcriptase]].\n\nIn order to amplify small amounts of DNA, the same methodology is used as in conventional PCR using a DNA template, at least one pair of specific [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]], [[deoxyribonucleotide]]s, a suitable [[buffer solution]] and a thermo-stable [[DNA polymerase]]. A substance marked with a [[fluorophore]] is added to this mixture in a [[thermal cycler]] that contains [[sensor]]s for measuring the [[fluorescence]] of the fluorophore after it has been excited at the required [[wavelength]] allowing the generation rate to be measured for one or more specific products. \nThis allows the rate of generation of the amplified product to be measured at  each PCR cycle. The data thus generated can be analysed by computer software to calculate ''relative gene expression'' (or ''mRNA copy number'') in several samples. Quantitative PCR can also be applied to the detection and quantification of DNA in samples to determine the presence and abundance of a particular DNA sequence in these samples.<ref name=\"watson\">{{cite book|last1=Watson|first1=J D|last2=Baker|first2=T A|last3=Bell|first3=S P|last4=Gann|first4=A|last5=Levine|first5=M|last6=Losick|first6=R|title=Molecular Biology of the Gene|date=2004|publisher=Benjamin Cummings|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-321-22368-5|edition=Fifth}}</ref> This measurement is made after each amplification cycle, and this is the reason why this method is called real time PCR (that is, immediate or simultaneous PCR). In the case of RNA quantitation, the template is [[complementary DNA]] (cDNA), which is obtained by [[Reverse transcriptase#Process of reverse transcription|reverse transcription]] of [[ribonucleic acid]] (RNA). In this instance the technique used is quantitative RT-PCR or Q-RT-PCR.\n\nQuantitative PCR and [[DNA microarray]] are modern methodologies for studying [[gene expression]]. Older methods were used to measure mRNA abundance: [[Differential display]], [[RNase protection assay]] and [[northern blot]]. [[Northern blot|Northern blotting]] is often used to estimate the expression level of a gene by visualizing the abundance of its mRNA transcript in a sample. In this method, purified RNA is separated by [[agarose gel electrophoresis]], transferred to a solid matrix (such as a nylon membrane), and probed with a specific [[Hybridization probe|DNA or RNA probe]] that is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the gene of interest. Although this technique is still used to assess gene expression, it requires relatively large amounts of RNA and provides only qualitative or semi quantitative information of mRNA levels.<ref name=\"Pfaffl\">Michael W.

An increase in DNA product during PCR therefore leads to an increase in fluorescence intensity measured at each cycle. However, dsDNA dyes such as [[SYBR Green]] will bind to all dsDNA PCR products, including nonspecific PCR products (such as [[Primer dimer]]). This can potentially interfere with, or prevent, accurate monitoring of the intended target sequence.\n\nIn real-time PCR with dsDNA dyes the reaction is prepared as usual, with the addition of fluorescent dsDNA dye. Then the reaction is run in a [[Quantitative PCR instrument|real-time PCR instrument]], and after each cycle, the intensity of fluorescence is measured with a detector; the dye only fluoresces when bound to the dsDNA (i.e., the PCR product). \nThis method has the advantage of only needing a pair of primers to carry out the amplification, which keeps costs down; multiple target sequences can be monitored in a tube by using different types of dyes.\n\n=== Specific detection: fluorescent reporter probe method ===\n[[File:TaqMan Probes.jpg|thumb|750px|(1) In intact probes, reporter fluorescence is quenched. (2) Probes and the complementary DNA strand are hybridized and reporter fluorescence is still quenched. (3) During PCR, the probe is degraded by the Taq polymerase and the fluorescent reporter released.]]\n\n[[fluorescence|Fluorescent]] reporter probes detect only the DNA containing the sequence complementary to the probe; therefore, use of the reporter probe significantly increases specificity, and enables performing the technique even in the presence of other dsDNA. Using different-coloured labels, fluorescent probes can be used in multiplex assays for monitoring several target sequences in the same tube. The specificity of fluorescent reporter probes also prevents interference of measurements caused by [[Primer Dimer|primer dimers]], which are undesirable potential by-products in PCR. However, fluorescent reporter probes do not prevent the inhibitory effect of the primer dimers, which may depress accumulation of the desired products in the reaction.\n\nThe method relies on a DNA-based probe with a fluorescent reporter at one end and a [[Quenching (fluorescence)|quencher]] of fluorescence at the opposite end of the probe. The close proximity of the reporter to the quencher prevents detection of its fluorescence; breakdown of the probe by the 5' to 3' [[exonuclease]] activity of the [[Taq polymerase]] breaks the reporter-quencher proximity and thus allows unquenched emission of fluorescence, which can be detected after [[Excited state|excitation]] with a laser. An increase in the product targeted by the reporter probe at each PCR cycle therefore causes a proportional increase in fluorescence due to the breakdown of the probe and release of the reporter.\n\n#The PCR is prepared as usual (see [[PCR]]), and the reporter probe is added.\n#As the reaction commences, during the [[Annealing (biology)|annealing]] stage of the PCR both probe and primers anneal to the DNA target.\n#Polymerisation of a new DNA strand is initiated from the primers, and once the polymerase reaches the probe, its 5'-3'-exonuclease degrades the probe, physically separating the fluorescent reporter from the quencher, resulting in an increase in fluorescence.\n#Fluorescence is detected and measured in a real-time PCR machine, and its geometric increase corresponding to exponential increase of the product is used to determine the quantification cycle [[Cycle of quantification/qualification|(C<sub>q</sub>)]] in each reaction.\n\n== Fusion temperature analysis ==\n[[File:Melting Ponchel2003.jpg|thumb|Distinct fusion curves for a number of PCR products (showing distinct colours).

The results of this technique are obtained by comparing the dissociation curves of the analysed DNA samples.<ref name=\"Ririe1997\">{{Cite journal|year=1997|title=Product Differentiation by Analysis of DNA Melting Curves during the Polymerase Chain Reaction|journal=Analytical Biochemistry|volume=245|pages=154\u2013160|doi=10.1006/abio.1996.9916|url=http://www.sh.lsuhsc.edu/oor/crf/PCR_prep2.pdf|pmid=9056205|author1=Ririe K.M|author2=Rasmussen R.P|author3=Wittwer C.T.|issue=2}}</ref>\n\nUnlike conventional PCR, this method avoids the previous use of [[electrophoresis]] techniques to demonstrate the results of all the samples. This is because, despite being a kinetic technique, quantitative PCR is usually evaluated at a distinct end point. The technique therefore usually provides more rapid results and/or uses fewer reactants than electrophoresis. If subsequent electrophoresis is required it is only necessary to test those samples that real time PCR has shown to be doubtful and/or to ratify the results for samples that have tested positive for a specific determinant.\n\n=== Modeling ===\nUnlike end point PCR (conventional PCR), real time PCR allows monitoring of the desired product at any point in the amplification process by measuring fluorescence (in real time frame, measurement is made of its level over a given threshold). A commonly employed method of DNA quantification by real-time PCR relies on plotting fluorescence against the number of cycles on a [[logarithmic scale]]. A threshold for detection of DNA-based fluorescence is set 3\u20135 times of the [[standard deviation]] of the signal noise above background. The number of cycles at which the fluorescence exceeds the threshold is called the threshold cycle (C<sub>t</sub>) or, according to the MIQE guidelines, quantification cycle [[Cycle of quantification/qualification|(C<sub>q</sub>)]].<ref name=\"S.

For example, a DNA sample whose C<sub>q</sub> precedes that of another sample by 3 cycles contained 2<sup>3</sup> = 8 times more template. However, the efficiency of amplification is often variable among primers and templates. Therefore, the efficiency of a primer-template combination is assessed in a [[titration]] experiment with serial dilutions of DNA template to create a [[standard curve]] of the change in [[Cycle of quantification/qualification|(C<sub>q</sub>)]] with each dilution. The [[slope]] of the [[linear regression]] is then used to determine the efficiency of amplification, which is 100% if a dilution of 1:2 results in a [[Cycle of quantification/qualification|(C<sub>q</sub>)]] difference of 1.

Relative quantification is easier to carry out as it does not require a calibration curve as the amount of the studied gene is compared to the amount of a control reference gene.\n\nAs the units used to express the results of relative quantification are unimportant the results can be compared across a number of different RTqPCR. The reason for using one or more housekeeping genes is to correct non-specific variation, such as the differences in the quantity and quality of RNA used, which can affect the efficiency of reverse transcription and therefore that of the whole PCR process.

It monitors the amplification of a targeted [[DNA]] molecule during the PCR (i.e., in real time), not at its end, as in conventional PCR. Real-time PCR can be used quantitatively (quantitative real-time PCR) and semi-quantitatively (i.e., above/below a certain amount of DNA molecules) (semi-quantitative real-time PCR).\n\nTwo common methods for the detection of PCR products in real-time PCR are (1) non-specific [[fluorescent dye]]s that [[Intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalate]] with any double-stranded DNA and (2) sequence-specific [[DNA probe]]s consisting of [[oligonucleotide]]s that are labelled with a [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] reporter, which permits detection only after [[nucleic acid hybridisation|hybridization]] of the probe with its complementary sequence.\n\nThe [[Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments]] (MIQE) guidelines propose that the abbreviation ''qPCR'' be used for quantitative real-time PCR and that ''RT-qPCR'' be used for reverse transcription\u2013qPCR.<ref name=\"Bustin2009\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Bustin SA, Benes V, Garson JA, Hellemans J, Huggett J, Kubista M, Mueller R, Nolan T, Pfaffl MW, Shipley GL, Vandesompele J, Wittwer CT|title=The MIQE guidelines: minimum information for publication of quantitative real-time PCR experiments|journal=Clinical Chemistry|volume=55|issue=4|pages=611\u2013622|year=2009|pmid=19246619|doi=10.1373/clinchem.2008.112797}}</ref> The acronym \"RT-PCR\" commonly denotes [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] and not real-time PCR, but not all authors adhere to this convention.<ref name=\"Logan et al.\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Logan|editor1-first=Julie|editor2-last=Edwards|editor2-first=Kirstin|editor3-last=Saunders|editor3-first=Nick|year=2009|title=Real-Time PCR: Current Technology and Applications|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn=978-1-904455-39-4|last-author-amp=yes}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Molecular Beacons.jpg|thumb|Real time PCR uses [[fluorophore]]s in order to detect levels of [[gene expression]].]]\nCells in all organisms regulate [[gene expression]] by turnover of gene transcripts (single stranded [[RNA]]): The amount of an expressed gene in a cell can be measured by the number of copies of an RNA transcript of that gene present in a sample. In order to robustly detect and quantify gene expression from small amounts of RNA, amplification of the gene transcript is necessary. The [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) is a common method for amplifying DNA; for RNA-based PCR the RNA sample is first reverse-transcribed to [[complementary DNA]] (cDNA) with [[reverse transcriptase]].\n\nIn order to amplify small amounts of DNA, the same methodology is used as in conventional PCR using a DNA template, at least one pair of specific [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]], [[deoxyribonucleotide]]s, a suitable [[buffer solution]] and a thermo-stable [[DNA polymerase]]. A substance marked with a [[fluorophore]] is added to this mixture in a [[thermal cycler]] that contains [[sensor]]s for measuring the [[fluorescence]] of the fluorophore after it has been excited at the required [[wavelength]] allowing the generation rate to be measured for one or more specific products. \nThis allows the rate of generation of the amplified product to be measured at  each PCR cycle. The data thus generated can be analysed by computer software to calculate ''relative gene expression'' (or ''mRNA copy number'') in several samples. Quantitative PCR can also be applied to the detection and quantification of DNA in samples to determine the presence and abundance of a particular DNA sequence in these samples.<ref name=\"watson\">{{cite book|last1=Watson|first1=J D|last2=Baker|first2=T A|last3=Bell|first3=S P|last4=Gann|first4=A|last5=Levine|first5=M|last6=Losick|first6=R|title=Molecular Biology of the Gene|date=2004|publisher=Benjamin Cummings|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-321-22368-5|edition=Fifth}}</ref> This measurement is made after each amplification cycle, and this is the reason why this method is called real time PCR (that is, immediate or simultaneous PCR).

In this instance the technique used is quantitative RT-PCR or Q-RT-PCR.\n\nQuantitative PCR and [[DNA microarray]] are modern methodologies for studying [[gene expression]]. Older methods were used to measure mRNA abundance: [[Differential display]], [[RNase protection assay]] and [[northern blot]]. [[Northern blot|Northern blotting]] is often used to estimate the expression level of a gene by visualizing the abundance of its mRNA transcript in a sample. In this method, purified RNA is separated by [[agarose gel electrophoresis]], transferred to a solid matrix (such as a nylon membrane), and probed with a specific [[Hybridization probe|DNA or RNA probe]] that is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the gene of interest. Although this technique is still used to assess gene expression, it requires relatively large amounts of RNA and provides only qualitative or semi quantitative information of mRNA levels.<ref name=\"Pfaffl\">Michael W.

An increase in DNA product during PCR therefore leads to an increase in fluorescence intensity measured at each cycle. However, dsDNA dyes such as [[SYBR Green]] will bind to all dsDNA PCR products, including nonspecific PCR products (such as [[Primer dimer]]). This can potentially interfere with, or prevent, accurate monitoring of the intended target sequence.\n\nIn real-time PCR with dsDNA dyes the reaction is prepared as usual, with the addition of fluorescent dsDNA dye. Then the reaction is run in a [[Quantitative PCR instrument|real-time PCR instrument]], and after each cycle, the intensity of fluorescence is measured with a detector; the dye only fluoresces when bound to the dsDNA (i.e., the PCR product). \nThis method has the advantage of only needing a pair of primers to carry out the amplification, which keeps costs down; multiple target sequences can be monitored in a tube by using different types of dyes.\n\n=== Specific detection: fluorescent reporter probe method ===\n[[File:TaqMan Probes.jpg|thumb|750px|(1) In intact probes, reporter fluorescence is quenched. (2) Probes and the complementary DNA strand are hybridized and reporter fluorescence is still quenched. (3) During PCR, the probe is degraded by the Taq polymerase and the fluorescent reporter released.]]\n\n[[fluorescence|Fluorescent]] reporter probes detect only the DNA containing the sequence complementary to the probe; therefore, use of the reporter probe significantly increases specificity, and enables performing the technique even in the presence of other dsDNA. Using different-coloured labels, fluorescent probes can be used in multiplex assays for monitoring several target sequences in the same tube. The specificity of fluorescent reporter probes also prevents interference of measurements caused by [[Primer Dimer|primer dimers]], which are undesirable potential by-products in PCR. However, fluorescent reporter probes do not prevent the inhibitory effect of the primer dimers, which may depress accumulation of the desired products in the reaction.\n\nThe method relies on a DNA-based probe with a fluorescent reporter at one end and a [[Quenching (fluorescence)|quencher]] of fluorescence at the opposite end of the probe. The close proximity of the reporter to the quencher prevents detection of its fluorescence; breakdown of the probe by the 5' to 3' [[exonuclease]] activity of the [[Taq polymerase]] breaks the reporter-quencher proximity and thus allows unquenched emission of fluorescence, which can be detected after [[Excited state|excitation]] with a laser. An increase in the product targeted by the reporter probe at each PCR cycle therefore causes a proportional increase in fluorescence due to the breakdown of the probe and release of the reporter.\n\n#The PCR is prepared as usual (see [[PCR]]), and the reporter probe is added.\n#As the reaction commences, during the [[Annealing (biology)|annealing]] stage of the PCR both probe and primers anneal to the DNA target.\n#Polymerisation of a new DNA strand is initiated from the primers, and once the polymerase reaches the probe, its 5'-3'-exonuclease degrades the probe, physically separating the fluorescent reporter from the quencher, resulting in an increase in fluorescence.\n#Fluorescence is detected and measured in a real-time PCR machine, and its geometric increase corresponding to exponential increase of the product is used to determine the quantification cycle [[Cycle of quantification/qualification|(C<sub>q</sub>)]] in each reaction.\n\n== Fusion temperature analysis ==\n[[File:Melting Ponchel2003.jpg|thumb|Distinct fusion curves for a number of PCR products (showing distinct colours).

This is because, despite being a kinetic technique, quantitative PCR is usually evaluated at a distinct end point. The technique therefore usually provides more rapid results and/or uses fewer reactants than electrophoresis. If subsequent electrophoresis is required it is only necessary to test those samples that real time PCR has shown to be doubtful and/or to ratify the results for samples that have tested positive for a specific determinant.\n\n=== Modeling ===\nUnlike end point PCR (conventional PCR), real time PCR allows monitoring of the desired product at any point in the amplification process by measuring fluorescence (in real time frame, measurement is made of its level over a given threshold). A commonly employed method of DNA quantification by real-time PCR relies on plotting fluorescence against the number of cycles on a [[logarithmic scale]]. A threshold for detection of DNA-based fluorescence is set 3\u20135 times of the [[standard deviation]] of the signal noise above background. The number of cycles at which the fluorescence exceeds the threshold is called the threshold cycle (C<sub>t</sub>) or, according to the MIQE guidelines, quantification cycle [[Cycle of quantification/qualification|(C<sub>q</sub>)]].<ref name=\"S.

Detection of [[mRNA]] on a [[northern blot]] or PCR products on a [[Agarose gel electrophoresis|gel]] or [[Southern blot]] does not allow precise quantification.<ref>{{cite web|title=PEMF For Treatment Of Corneal Disorders|url=http://lemuriatechnologies.com/index.php/component/joomgalaxy/Entry-Detail/PEMF%20for%20treatment%20of%20corneal%20disorders%20and%20injuries?lang=en|author=Bruce Gelerter|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609040341/http://lemuriatechnologies.com/index.php/component/joomgalaxy/Entry-Detail/PEMF%20for%20treatment%20of%20corneal%20disorders%20and%20injuries?lang=en|website=lemuriatechnologies.com|archive-date=2014-06-09}}</ref> For example, over the 20\u201340 cycles of a typical PCR, the amount of DNA product reaches a [[plateau (mathematics)|plateau]] that is not directly correlated with the amount of target DNA in the initial PCR.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=12901609|pmc=2279895|year=2003|last1=Overbergh|first1=L.|title=The use of real-time reverse transcriptase PCR for the quantification of cytokine gene expression|journal=Journal of Biomolecular Techniques : JBT|volume=14|issue=1|pages=33\u201343|last2=Giulietti|first2=A.|last3=Valckx|first3=D.|last4=Decallonne|first4=R.|last5=Bouillon|first5=R.|last6=Mathieu|first6=C.}}</ref>\n\nReal-time PCR can be used to quantify [[nucleic acid]]s by two common methods: relative quantification and absolute quantification.<ref name=\"S.

The quantification is expressed as the change in expression levels of mRNA interpreted as [[complementary DNA]] (cDNA, generated by [[Reverse transcriptase#Process of reverse transcription|reverse transcription]] of mRNA). Relative quantification is easier to carry out as it does not require a calibration curve as the amount of the studied gene is compared to the amount of a control reference gene.\n\nAs the units used to express the results of relative quantification are unimportant the results can be compared across a number of different RTqPCR. The reason for using one or more housekeeping genes is to correct non-specific variation, such as the differences in the quantity and quality of RNA used, which can affect the efficiency of reverse transcription and therefore that of the whole PCR process. However, the most crucial aspect of the process is that the reference gene must be stable.<ref>{{cite journal|last2=Yakovlev|first2=IA|last3=Strauss|first3=SH|year=2004|title=Validating internal controls for quantitative plant gene expression studies|url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/external_ref?access_num=15317655&link_type=MED|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130802040615/http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/external_ref?access_num=15317655&link_type=MED|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-08-02|journal=BMC Plant Biol|volume=4|page=14|last1=Brunner|first1=AM|doi=10.1186/1471-2229-4-14|pmid=15317655|pmc=515301}}</ref>\n\nThe selection of these reference genes was traditionally carried out in [[molecular biology]] using qualitative or semi-quantitative studies such as the visual examination of RNA gels, northern blot [[densitometry]] or semi-quantitative PCR (PCR mimics).
