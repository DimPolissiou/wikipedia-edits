The Tamil New Year follows the ''nirayanam'' [[vernal equinox]]<ref>Dershowitz, Nachum and Reingold, Edward M.: Calendrical Calculations. Third edition, Cambridge University Press (2008).</ref>{{Page needed|date=February 2020}} and generally falls on 14 April of the Gregorian year. 14 April marks the first day of the traditional Tamil calendar and is a public holiday in the state of Tamil Nadu, Sri Lanka and Mauritius. Tropical vernal equinox fall around 22 March, and by adding 23 degrees of trepidation (oscillation) to it, we get the Hindu sidereal or ''Nirayana Mesha Sankranti'' (Sun's transition into ''nirayana'' Aries). Hence, the Tamil calendar begins on the same date in April which is observed by most traditional calendars of the rest of India \u2013 [[Assam]], [[Bengal]], [[Kerala]], [[Odisha]], [[Manipur]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] etc.<ref>Underhill, Muriel M.: The Hindu Religious Year. Association Press, Kolkata, India (1921).</ref> This also coincides with the traditional new year in [[Burma]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]] and [[Thailand]]. \n\nThe calendar follows a 60-year cycle which is also very ancient and is observed by most traditional calendars of India and China. According to popular belief it is related to 5 revolutions of Jupiter around the Sun, and also to 60-year orbit of ''Nakshatras'' (stars) as mentioned in [[Surya Siddhanta]].\n\nIn the Gregorian Year {{CURRENTYEAR}} the '''Tamil year''' starts on 14 April {{CURRENTYEAR}}, [[Kaliyuga]] {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+3102}}.

Nakkirar, [[Sangam period]] author of the ''[[Ne\u1e6dunalv\u0101\u1e6dai]]'', wrote in the third century CE that the Sun travels each year from Mesha/Chitterai in mid-April through 11 successive signs of the zodiac.<ref>JV Chelliah: Pattupattu: Ten Tamil Idylls.

Its earliest reference is to be found in [[Surya Siddhanta]], which [[Varahamihira]]r (550 CE) believed to be the most accurate of the then current theories of astronomy. However, in the Surya Siddhantic list, the first year was ''Vijaya'' and not ''Prabhava'' as currently used. There are some parallels in this [[sexagenary cycle]] with the [[Chinese calendar]].<ref>Samuel Wells Williams, The Middle Kingdom, V 2, Columbia University Press, New York, 2005 pp. 69\u201370</ref><ref>Paul Kekai Manansala, Quests of the Dragon and Bird Clan, 2006, p. 236</ref><ref>Terrien de Lacouperie, Western Origin of the Early Chinese Civilization: From 2,300 BC to 20 AD, Asher and Co, London 1894 p. 78</ref> The Surya Siddhanta and other Indian classical texts on astronomy had some influence on the Chinese calendar<ref>George Gheverghese Joseph, Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics, Princeton University Press, 2011, p. 304-305</ref> although it merits attention that the sexagenary cycle in China is itself very old.\n\nAfter the completion of sixty years, the calendar starts a new with the first year. This corresponds to the Hindu \"century.\" The ''Vakya'' or ''Tirukannitha Panchangam'' (the traditional Tamil almanac) outlines this sequence. It is related to the position of the planets in the sky with respect to earth. It means that the two major planets Sani/Saturn (which takes 30 years to complete one cycle round the sun) and the Viyazhan/Jupiter (which takes 12 years to complete one cycle round the Sun) comes to the same position after 60 years.\n\nThe following list presents the current 60-year cycle of the Tamil calendar:<ref>Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, Vedic calendar: Kadavul Hindu Panchangam,

people|Tamil]] [[Hindu]]s. Some months are considered very auspicious while a few are considered inauspicious as well. Tamil months start and end based on the Sun's shift from one Rasi to the other but the names of the months are based on the star on the start of Pournami in that month. The name of the month is some times the name of the star itself. (e.g. Chithrai is always the star on the Pournami of the Chithirai month).\n\nSome of the celebrations for each month are listed below. Dates in parentheses are not exact and usually vary by a day or two. Underneath (or beside) the months of the Hindu calendar are their Gregorian counterparts.<ref>Kielhorn, Franz: Festal Days of the Hindu Lunar Calendar.

Acta Orientalia (1922\u20131927).</ref> For computing the age of the earth and various geological and other epochs, as well as the age of mankind, they still employ a Tamil calendar derived from ancient astronomical data, known as the ''Tirukkanida Panchanga''<ref>H.P. Blavatsky, 'The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion and Philosophy' Book 2: pp. 49\u201351, Theosophical University Press, 1888</ref>\n*The 10th Tamil month, called ''Thai'', falls in mid-January each year. It is celebrated with much enthusiasm within the Tamil Community all over the world. Thai is marked by gifts of new clothing for family members and prayers to God for prosperity in the coming year. ''Thai'' and the fifth month ''Aavani'' are considered very auspicious for marriage and most marriages occur during these months.\n*The fourth month ''Aadi'' is a busy month for most people including priests as there will be major temple festivities throughout the month, so most weddings do not often fall in this month. ''Aadi'' is the month of preparation for the next crop cycle by farmers. Therefore, farming communities avoid major events like weddings in this month. Those members of the Tamil community who don't actively contribute/participate in farming take advantage by having important functions like wedding in this month. For example, the business community prefers this month for weddings. ''Aadi'' is usually the worst month for business, although when businesses recently initiated Aadi discounts, this situation has changed significantly. Each Friday of this month is set aside for prayer and worship.\n*''Aadi'' is portrayed as an inauspicious month for union of newlyweds because conceiving in this month might often result in child delivery around April\u2013May, the hottest months in Tamil Nadu (''Agni natchathiram'' \u2013 ['pinezhu'] the last 7 days of ''Chithirai'' and ['munezhu'] the first 7 days of ''Vaigasi''). 'Aadi' is also the windiest month in Tamil Nadu, and hence the phrase 'Aadi kaatru ammiyai nagatrum' (literally, 'the strong winds in the month of Aadi can even move a stone grinder')\n*''Purattaasi'' is when most of the non-vegetarian Tamil people forgo meat for a month. Each Saturday of this month is set apart to venerate the planet Saturn.\n*''Deepavali'', is celebrated on the new moon day, in the seventh month ''Aipasi''. The month of ''Aipasi'' is usually characterised by the North-East Monsoon in Tamil Nadu, which has given birth to a phrase, ''Aipasi adai mazhai'' meaning the \"Non-stop downpour\".\n*''Maargazhi'' falls in winter in Tamil Nadu, and is an auspicious month. The month is considered sacred. During the holy month of Maargazhi, houses are decorated with colorful and elaborate kolams. These are drawn on the threshold to welcome guests and divine beings to bless their houses with prosperity and happiness. The [[Shaivite]] fast of ''Thiru-vembaavai'' and the Vaishnava fast of ''Thiru-paavai'' are also observed in this month.\n*The total number of days in a Tamil Calendar is an average 365 days. The ''Vakiya Panchangam'' is employed for both sacred and civil calculations. The ''Trikanitha Panchangam'' is employed for [[Hindu astrology|astrological]] calculations.\n\n==Festivals==\nThe Tamil Calendar is important in the life of Tamil-speaking people and most Festivals of [[Tamil Nadu]] are based on it. Some Festivals include \n* [[Tamil New Year]] (also called ''[[Puthandu]]'') in mid-April, \n* [[Thai Pongal]], \n* [[Deepavali]], \n* Panguni Uthiram, \n* Thirukaarthigai, \n* Aadiperukku, \n* [[Navaratri]]\nOne day was even dedicated to a celebration of the Tamil alphabet and was called \"ezhuthu naal'.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chandravakyas]]\n* [[Malayalam calendar]]\n* [[Pambu Panchangam]]\n* [[Puthandu]]\n* [[Samvatsara]]\n* [[Sexagenary cycle]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://tamilcalendarz.com/ Full Tamil Calendar with Panchangam Information]\n* [http://tamil.indiancalendars.org/ Tamil Calendar with Panchangam Information]\n* [http://www.probharat.com/indian-calendars/tamil-calendar.php] @ Tamil Calendar for all past and future years (\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd \u0ba8\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbe\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bbf)\n* [http://tamil.panchangam.org/ Tamil Calendar with Daily Panchangam]\n* [https://dheivegam.com/tamil-calendar/ Tamil Calendar for each year]\n\n{{Calendars}}\n\n[[Category:Hindu calendar]]\n[[Category:Tamil culture]]\n[[Category:Time in India]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Use British English|date=August 2010}}\nThe '''Sankrist calendar''' is a [[Sidereal time|sidereal]] [[Hindu calendar]] used by the [[Tamil people]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]].<ref>S.K.

Third edition, Cambridge University Press (2008).</ref>{{Page needed|date=February 2020}} and generally falls on 14 April of the Gregorian year. 14 April marks the first day of the traditional Tamil calendar and is a public holiday in the state of Tamil Nadu, Sri Lanka and Mauritius. Tropical vernal equinox fall around 22 March, and by adding 23 degrees of trepidation (oscillation) to it, we get the Hindu sidereal or ''Nirayana Mesha Sankranti'' (Sun's transition into ''nirayana'' Aries). Hence, the Tamil calendar begins on the same date in April which is observed by most traditional calendars of the rest of India \u2013 [[Assam]], [[Bengal]], [[Kerala]], [[Odisha]], [[Manipur]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] etc.<ref>Underhill, Muriel M.: The Hindu Religious Year. Association Press, Kolkata, India (1921).</ref> This also coincides with the traditional new year in [[Burma]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]] and [[Thailand]]. \n\nThe calendar follows a 60-year cycle which is also very ancient and is observed by most traditional calendars of India and China. According to popular belief it is related to 5 revolutions of Jupiter around the Sun, and also to 60-year orbit of ''Nakshatras'' (stars) as mentioned in [[Surya Siddhanta]].\n\nIn the Gregorian Year {{CURRENTYEAR}} the '''Tamil year''' starts on 14 April {{CURRENTYEAR}}, [[Kaliyuga]] {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}+3102}}.

Its earliest reference is to be found in [[Surya Siddhanta]], which [[Varahamihira]]r (550 CE) believed to be the most accurate of the then current theories of astronomy. However, in the Surya Siddhantic list, the first year was ''Vijaya'' and not ''Prabhava'' as currently used. There are some parallels in this [[sexagenary cycle]] with the [[Chinese calendar]].<ref>Samuel Wells Williams, The Middle Kingdom, V 2, Columbia University Press, New York, 2005 pp. 69\u201370</ref><ref>Paul Kekai Manansala, Quests of the Dragon and Bird Clan, 2006, p. 236</ref><ref>Terrien de Lacouperie, Western Origin of the Early Chinese Civilization: From 2,300 BC to 20 AD, Asher and Co, London 1894 p. 78</ref> The Surya Siddhanta and other Indian classical texts on astronomy had some influence on the Chinese calendar<ref>George Gheverghese Joseph, Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics, Princeton University Press, 2011, p. 304-305</ref> although it merits attention that the sexagenary cycle in China is itself very old.\n\nAfter the completion of sixty years, the calendar starts a new with the first year. This corresponds to the Hindu \"century.\" The ''Vakya'' or ''Tirukannitha Panchangam'' (the traditional Tamil almanac) outlines this sequence. It is related to the position of the planets in the sky with respect to earth. It means that the two major planets Sani/Saturn (which takes 30 years to complete one cycle round the sun) and the Viyazhan/Jupiter (which takes 12 years to complete one cycle round the Sun) comes to the same position after 60 years.\n\nThe following list presents the current 60-year cycle of the Tamil calendar:<ref>Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, Vedic calendar: Kadavul Hindu Panchangam,

people|Tamil]] [[Hindu]]s. Some months are considered very auspicious while a few are considered inauspicious as well. Tamil months start and end based on the Sun's shift from one Rasi to the other but the names of the months are based on the star on the start of Pournami in that month. The name of the month is some times the name of the star itself. (e.g. Chithrai is always the star on the Pournami of the Chithirai month).\n\nSome of the celebrations for each month are listed below. Dates in parentheses are not exact and usually vary by a day or two. Underneath (or beside) the months of the Hindu calendar are their Gregorian counterparts.<ref>Kielhorn, Franz: Festal Days of the Hindu Lunar Calendar.

Acta Orientalia (1922\u20131927).</ref> For computing the age of the earth and various geological and other epochs, as well as the age of mankind, they still employ a Tamil calendar derived from ancient astronomical data, known as the ''Tirukkanida Panchanga''<ref>H.P. Blavatsky, 'The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion and Philosophy' Book 2: pp. 49\u201351, Theosophical University Press, 1888</ref>\n*The 10th Tamil month, called ''Thai'', falls in mid-January each year. It is celebrated with much enthusiasm within the Tamil Community all over the world. Thai is marked by gifts of new clothing for family members and prayers to God for prosperity in the coming year. ''Thai'' and the fifth month ''Aavani'' are considered very auspicious for marriage and most marriages occur during these months.\n*The fourth month ''Aadi'' is a busy month for most people including priests as there will be major temple festivities throughout the month, so most weddings do not often fall in this month. ''Aadi'' is the month of preparation for the next crop cycle by farmers. Therefore, farming communities avoid major events like weddings in this month. Those members of the Tamil community who don't actively contribute/participate in farming take advantage by having important functions like wedding in this month. For example, the business community prefers this month for weddings. ''Aadi'' is usually the worst month for business, although when businesses recently initiated Aadi discounts, this situation has changed significantly. Each Friday of this month is set aside for prayer and worship.\n*''Aadi'' is portrayed as an inauspicious month for union of newlyweds because conceiving in this month might often result in child delivery around April\u2013May, the hottest months in Tamil Nadu (''Agni natchathiram'' \u2013 ['pinezhu'] the last 7 days of ''Chithirai'' and ['munezhu'] the first 7 days of ''Vaigasi''). 'Aadi' is also the windiest month in Tamil Nadu, and hence the phrase 'Aadi kaatru ammiyai nagatrum' (literally, 'the strong winds in the month of Aadi can even move a stone grinder')\n*''Purattaasi'' is when most of the non-vegetarian Tamil people forgo meat for a month. Each Saturday of this month is set apart to venerate the planet Saturn.\n*''Deepavali'', is celebrated on the new moon day, in the seventh month ''Aipasi''. The month of ''Aipasi'' is usually characterised by the North-East Monsoon in Tamil Nadu, which has given birth to a phrase, ''Aipasi adai mazhai'' meaning the \"Non-stop downpour\".\n*''Maargazhi'' falls in winter in Tamil Nadu, and is an auspicious month. The month is considered sacred. During the holy month of Maargazhi, houses are decorated with colorful and elaborate kolams. These are drawn on the threshold to welcome guests and divine beings to bless their houses with prosperity and happiness. The [[Shaivite]] fast of ''Thiru-vembaavai'' and the Vaishnava fast of ''Thiru-paavai'' are also observed in this month.\n*The total number of days in a Tamil Calendar is an average 365 days. The ''Vakiya Panchangam'' is employed for both sacred and civil calculations. The ''Trikanitha Panchangam'' is employed for [[Hindu astrology|astrological]] calculations.\n\n==Festivals==\nThe Tamil Calendar is important in the life of Tamil-speaking people and most Festivals of [[Tamil Nadu]] are based on it. Some Festivals include \n* [[Tamil New Year]] (also called ''[[Puthandu]]'') in mid-April, \n* [[Thai Pongal]], \n* [[Deepavali]], \n* Panguni Uthiram, \n* Thirukaarthigai, \n* Aadiperukku, \n* [[Navaratri]]\nOne day was even dedicated to a celebration of the Tamil alphabet and was called \"ezhuthu naal'.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chandravakyas]]\n* [[Malayalam calendar]]\n* [[Pambu Panchangam]]\n* [[Puthandu]]\n* [[Samvatsara]]\n* [[Sexagenary cycle]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://tamilcalendarz.com/ Full Tamil Calendar with Panchangam Information]\n* [http://tamil.indiancalendars.org/ Tamil Calendar with Panchangam Information]\n* [http://www.probharat.com/indian-calendars/tamil-calendar.php] @ Tamil Calendar for all past and future years (\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd \u0ba8\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbe\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bbf)\n* [http://tamil.panchangam.org/ Tamil Calendar with Daily Panchangam]\n* [https://dheivegam.com/tamil-calendar/ Tamil Calendar for each year]\n\n{{Calendars}}\n\n[[Category:Hindu calendar]]\n[[Category:Tamil culture]]\n[[Category:Time in India]]\n", "name_user": "Niaroq78", "label": "safe", "comment": "It is not a sanskrit calendar nor an Hindu calendar, It is a non religious calendar used long before Hindu religion came to India.

He was a leading figure of the British [[satire boom]] of the 1960s, and associated with the [[anti-establishment]] comedic movement that emerged in the United Kingdom in the late 1950s.\n\nBorn in [[Torquay]], he was educated at the [[University of Cambridge]]. There he became involved with the [[Footlights|Footlights Club]], of which he later became president. After graduating he created the comedy stage revue ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'' beginning a long running partnership with [[Dudley Moore]]. In 1961, Cook opened the comedy club [[The Establishment (club)|The Establishment]] in [[Soho]], Central London. In 1965 Cook and Moore began a television career, beginning with ''[[Not Only... But Also]]''. Following the success of the show the duo appeared together in films ''[[The Wrong Box]]'' (1966) and ''[[Bedazzled (1967 film)|Bedazzled]]'' (1967). Cook and Moore returned to television projects continuing to the late 1970s, including co-presenting ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the United States. From 1978 until his death in 1995 Cook's collaboration with Moore was mostly over, but he continued to be a regular performer in British television and film.\n\nReferred to as \"the father of modern satire\" by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2005, Cook was ranked number one in the ''Comedians' Comedian'', a poll of more than 300 comics, comedy writers, producers, and directors throughout the English-speaking world.<ref>{{cite news |title=Peter Cook the funniest |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/People/Peter-Cook-the-funniest/2005/01/03/1104601276619.html |work=The Age |location=Australia |date=3 January 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Cook tops poll of comedy greats|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jan/02/arts.artsnews |work=The Guardian |date=2 January 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nCook was born at his parents' house, \"Shearbridge\", in Middle Warberry Road, [[Torquay]], [[Devon]]. He was the only son, and eldest of the three children, of Alexander Edward \"Alec\" Cook (1906\u20131984), a colonial [[Civil service|civil servant]] and his wife Ethel Catherine Margaret (1908\u20131994), daughter of solicitor Charles Mayo.<ref>Peter Cook: A Biography, Harry Thompson, Sceptre, 1998, p. 3</ref> His father served as [[political officer (British Empire)|political officer]] and later [[district officer]] in Nigeria, then as [[financial secretary]] to the colony of Gibraltar, followed by a return to Nigeria as [[Permanent Secretary]] of the Eastern Region based at [[Enugu]].<ref>Peter Cook: A Biography, Harry Thompson, Sceptre, 1998, p. 5, 21</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/remembering-peter-cook-family-and-friends-including-keith-richards-ronnie-wood-and-bruce-forsyth-9952941.html|title=Remembering Peter Cook: Family and friends - including Keith Richards,|date=3 January 2015|website=The Independent}}</ref> Cook's grandfather, Edward Arthur Cook (1869\u20131914), had also been a colonial civil servant, traffic manager for the [[Federated Malay States Railway]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]]; stress that he suffered, in the lead-up to an interview regarding promotion, led him to commit suicide. His wife, Minnie Jane (1869-1957; daughter of Thomas Wreford, of [[Thelbridge]] and [[Witheridge]], Devon, and of [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], of a prominent Devonshire family traced back to 1440),<ref>Records and Pedigree of the Wreford Family, George Wreford, second edition, 1909</ref><ref>A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Commoners of Great Britain and Ireland, ed.

As a student, Cook initially intended to become a career [[diplomat]] like his father, but Britain \"had run out of colonies\", as he put it.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Paxman |first1=Jeremy |authorlink=Jeremy Paxman |title=Empire |date=2012 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780670919598 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tQpOOnImnd4C&pg=PT340}}</ref> Although largely apathetic politically, particularly in later life when he displayed a deep distrust of politicians of all hues, he joined the [[Cambridge University Liberal Club]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://keynessociety.wordpress.com/about-the-keynes-society/ |title=About us \" Keynes Society |publisher=Keynessociety.wordpress.com |accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref> At Pembroke, Cook performed and wrote comedy sketches as a member of the Cambridge [[Footlights|Footlights Club]], of which he became president in 1960. His hero was fellow Footlights writer and Cambridge magazine writer [[David Nobbs]].<ref>I Didn't Get Where I am Today by David Nobbs 9780099421641</ref>\n\nWhile still at university Cook wrote for [[Kenneth Williams]], providing several sketches for Williams's hit [[West End theatre|West End]] comedy revue ''[[Pieces of Eight (1959 revue)|Pieces of Eight]]'' and much of the follow-up, ''[[One Over the Eight]]'', before finding prominence in his own right in a four-man group satirical stage show, ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'', alongside [[Jonathan Miller]], [[Alan Bennett]] and [[Dudley Moore]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Peter-Cook |title=Peter Edward Cook {{!}} British entertainer |work=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=2017-10-17 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n''Beyond the Fringe'' became a great success in London after being first performed at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] and included Cook impersonating the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], [[Harold Macmillan]]. This was one of the first occasions satirical political mimicry had been attempted in live theatre, and it shocked audiences. During one performance, Macmillan was in the theatre and Cook departed from his script and attacked him verbally.<ref>Cook as Macmillan: \"there's nothing I like better than to wander over to a theatre and sit there listening to a group of sappy, urgent, vibrant young satirists with a stupid great grin spread all over my silly face\", ''Tragically I Was an Only Twin'', p. 51.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===1960s===\n[[File:Peter Cook Beyond the Fringe 1962.JPG|thumb|upright|Cook in the revue ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'']]\n\nIn 1961, Cook opened [[The Establishment (club)|The Establishment]], a club at 18 Greek Street in [[Soho]] in [[central London]], presenting fellow comedians in a nightclub setting, including American [[Lenny Bruce]]. Cook said it was a satirical venue modelled on \"those wonderful Berlin cabarets ... which did so much to stop the rise of Hitler and prevent the outbreak of the Second World War\";<ref>{{cite web.|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/02/28/1046407753895.html |title=Tom Lehrer interview |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=1 March 2003 |accessdate=16 September 2013}}</ref> as a members-only venue it was outside the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office|censorship restrictions]]. The Establishment's regular cabaret performers were [[Eleanor Bron]], [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]] and [[John Fortune]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1995/01/23/bedazzled |title=BEDAZZLED |work=The New Yorker |access-date=2018-08-12 |language=en-US}}</ref> \n  \nCook befriended and supported Australian comedian and actor [[Barry Humphries]], who began his British solo career at the club. Humphries said in his autobiography, ''My Life As Me'', that he found Cook's lack of interest in art and literature off-putting. Dudley Moore's jazz trio played in the basement of the club during the early 1960s. \n\nCook also opened an Establishment club in New York in 1963 and [[Lenny Bruce]] performed there, as well.<ref>[youtube.com/watch?v=PKu3Y5B|-c&t+328s20 January 1963 episode of ''What's My Line''].</ref>\n\nIn 1962, the [[BBC]] commissioned a pilot for a television series of satirical sketches based on the Establishment Club, but it was not immediately picked up and Cook went to [[New York City]] for a year to perform ''Beyond The Fringe'' on Broadway. When he returned, the pilot had been refashioned as ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]'' and had made a star of [[David Frost]], something Cook resented.\n\nThe 1960s [[satire boom]] was coming to an end and Cook said: \"England was about to sink giggling into the sea.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=4yE3UtuvCIKthQfny4CgAw&id=cBs-AQAAIAAJ&dq=sea+under+the+own+giggling+%22peter+cook%22+-wikipedia&q=sink+giggling#search_anchor |title=The Spectator, Volume 211 |year=1963|accessdate=16 September 2013}}</ref> He complained that Frost's success was based on copying Cook's own stage persona and Cook dubbed him \"the bubonic plagiarist\",<ref name=\"Hattenstone\">Simon Hattenstone [https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jul/02/david-frost-interview-frost-nixon \"The Saturday interview: David Frost\"], ''The Guardian'', 2 July 2011</ref> and said that his only regret in life, according to [[Alan Bennett]], had been saving Frost from drowning. This incident occurred in the summer of 1963, when the rivalry between the two men was at its height. Cook had realised that Frost's potential drowning would have looked deliberate if he had not been rescued.<ref>Humphrey Carpenter, ''That Was Satire That Was: The Satire Boom of the 1960s'', London: Victor Gollancz, 2000, pp. 270\u201371.</ref>\n\nAround this time, Cook provided financial backing for the satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'', supporting it through difficult periods, particularly in [[libel]] trials. Cook invested his own money and solicited investment from his friends. For a time, the magazine was produced from the premises of the Establishment Club. In 1963, Cook married Wendy Snowden; the couple had two daughters, Lucy and Daisy, but the marriage ended in 1970.\n\nCook's first regular television spot was on [[Granada Television]]'s ''Braden Beat'' with [[Bernard Braden]], where he featured his most enduring character: the static, dour and monotonal [[E. L. Wisty]], whom Cook had conceived for Radley College's Marionette Society.\n\n[[File:Dudley Moore Peter Cook Kraft Music Hall.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Cook and [[Dudley Moore]] in London for the US television programme ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'']]\n\nCook's [[Double act|comedy partnership]] with Dudley Moore led to ''[[Not Only... But Also]]''. This was originally intended by the BBC as a vehicle for Moore's music, but Moore invited Cook to write sketches and appear with him. Using few props, they created dry, absurd television that proved hugely popular and lasted for three series between 1965 and 1970. Cook played characters such as [[Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling]] and the two men created their [[Pete and Dud]] alter egos. Other sketches included \"Superthunderstingcar\", a parody of the [[Gerry Anderson]] marionette TV shows, and Cook's pastiche of 1960s trendy arts documentaries \u2013 satirised in a parodic segment on [[Greta Garbo]].\n\nWhen Cook learned a few years later that the videotapes of the series were to be [[Wiping|wiped]], a common practice at the time, he offered to buy the recordings from the BBC but was refused because of copyright issues. He suggested he could purchase new tapes so that the BBC would have no need to erase the originals, but this was also turned down. Of the original 22 programmes, only eight still survive complete. A compilation of six half-hour programmes, ''The Best of What's Left of Not Only...But Also'' was shown on television and has been released on both VHS and DVD.\n\nWith ''[[The Wrong Box]]'' (1966) and ''[[Bedazzled (1967 film)|Bedazzled]]'' (1967) Cook and Moore began to act in films together. Directed by [[Stanley Donen]], the underlying story of ''Bedazzled'' is credited to Cook and Moore and its screenplay to Cook. A comic parody of [[Faust]], it stars Cook as George Spigott (the [[Devil]]) who tempts Stanley Moon (Moore), a frustrated, short-order chef, with the promise of gaining his heart's desire \u2013 the unattainable beauty and waitress at his cafe, Margaret Spencer ([[Eleanor Bron]]) \u2013 in exchange for his soul, but repeatedly tricks him. The film features cameo appearances by [[Barry Humphries]] as Envy and [[Raquel Welch]] as Lust. Moore composed the soundtrack music and co-wrote (with Cook) the songs performed in the film. His jazz trio backed Cook on the theme, a parodic anti-love song, which Cook delivered in a deadpan monotone and included his familiar put-down, \"you fill me with inertia\".\n\nIn 1968, Cook and Moore briefly switched to [[Associated Television|ATV]] for four one-hour programmes titled ''[[Goodbye Again (TV)|Goodbye Again]]'', based on the Pete and Dud characters. Cook's increasing alcoholism led him to become reliant on cue cards; the show was not a popular success, owing in part to a strike causing the suspension of the publication of the ITV [[listings magazine]] ''[[TV Times]]''. [[John Cleese]] was a cast member.\n\n===1970s===\n[[File:Good Evening Dudley Moore Peter Cook 1975.JPG|thumb|Cook (right) and Moore performing in the revue ''Good Evening'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]]]\nIn 1970, Cook took over a project initiated by David Frost for a satirical film about an opinion pollster who rises to become President of Great Britain. Under Cook's guidance, the character became modelled on Frost. The film, ''[[The Rise and Rise of Michael Rimmer]]'', was not a success, although the cast contained notable names (including [[Monty Python]]'s John Cleese and [[Graham Chapman]], who co-wrote the film).\n\nCook became a favourite of the chat show circuit, but his own effort at hosting such a show for the BBC in 1971, ''Where Do I Sit?'', was said by the critics to have been a disappointment. He was replaced after only two episodes by [[Michael Parkinson]], the start of Parkinson's career as a chat show host. Parkinson later asked Cook what his ambitions were, Cook replied jocularly \"[...] in fact, my ambition is to shut you up altogether you see!\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0_xbprZFD0 |title=Peter Cook on \"Parkinson\" \u2013 Part 2 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=16 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nCook and Moore fashioned sketches from ''Not Only....But Also'' and ''Goodbye Again'' with new material into the stage revue called ''Behind the Fridge''. This show toured Australia in 1972 before transferring to New York City in 1973, re-titled as ''Good Evening''. Cook frequently appeared on and off stage the worse for drink. Nonetheless, the show proved very popular and it won [[Tony Award|Tony]] and [[Grammy Award]]s. When it finished, Moore stayed in the United States to pursue his film acting ambitions in Hollywood. Cook returned to Britain and in 1973 married the actress and model [[Judy Huxtable]].\n\nLater, the more risqu\u00e9 humour of Pete and Dud went farther on [[gramophone record|long-playing records]] as \"[[Derek and Clive]]\". The first recording was initiated by Cook to alleviate boredom during the Broadway run of ''Good Evening'', and used material conceived years before for the two characters but considered too outrageous. One of these audio recordings was also filmed, and therein tensions between the duo are seen to rise. [[Chris Blackwell]] circulated [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] copies to friends in the music business. The popularity of the recording convinced Cook to release it commercially, although Moore was initially reluctant, fearing that his rising fame as a Hollywood star would be undermined. Two further ''Derek and Clive'' albums were released, the last accompanied by a film.\n\nCook and Moore hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on 24 January 1976 during the show's first season. They did a number of their classic stage routines, including \"[[One Leg Too Few]]\" and \"Frog and Peach\" among others, in addition to participating in some skits with the show's ensemble cast.\n\nIn 1978, Cook appeared on the British music series ''[[Revolver (TV series)|Revolver]]'' as the manager of a ballroom where emerging punk and new wave acts played. For some groups, these were their first appearances on television. Cook's acerbic commentary was a distinctive aspect of the programme.\n\nIn 1979, Cook recorded comedy-segments as B-sides to the [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]] 12-inch singles \"Number One Song in Heaven\" and \"Tryouts for the Human Race\". The main songwriter [[Ron Mael]] often began with a banal situation in his lyrics, and then went at surreal tangents in the style of Cook and [[S. J. Perelman]].\n\n===''Consequences'' album===\nCook played multiple roles on the 1977 [[concept album]] ''[[Consequences (Godley & Creme album)|Consequences]]'', written and produced by former [[10cc]] members [[Kevin Godley]] and [[Lol Creme]]. A mixture of spoken comedy and [[progressive rock]] with an environmental subtext, ''Consequences'' started as a single that Godley and Creme planned to make to demonstrate their invention, an electric guitar effect called [[the Gizmo]], which they developed in 10cc. The project grew into a three-LP box set. The comedy sections were originally intended to be performed by a cast including [[Spike Milligan]] and [[Peter Ustinov]], but Godley and Creme eventually settled on Cook once they realised he could perform most parts himself.\n\nThe storyline centres on the impending divorce of ineffectual Englishman Walter Stapleton (Cook) and his French wife Lulu ([[Judy Huxtable]]). While meeting their lawyers \u2013 the bibulous Mr. Haig and overbearing Mr. Pepperman (both played by Cook) \u2013 the encroaching global catastrophe interrupts proceedings with bizarre and mysterious happenings, which seem to centre on Mr. Blint (Cook), a musician and composer living in the flat below Haig's office, to which it is connected by a large hole in the floor.\n\nAlthough it has since developed a cult following due to Cook's presence, ''Consequences'' was released as [[Punk rock|punk]] was sweeping the UK and proved a resounding commercial failure, savaged by critics who found the music self-indulgent. The script and story have evident connections to Cook's own life \u2013 his then wife Judy Huxtable plays Walter's wife. Cook's struggles with alcohol are mirrored in Haig's drinking, and there is a parallel between the fictional divorce of Walter and Lulu and Cook's own divorce from his first wife. The voice and accent Cook used for the character of Stapleton are similar to those of Cook's ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'' colleague, Alan Bennett, and a book on Cook's comedy, ''How Very Interesting'', speculates that the characters Cook plays in ''Consequences'' are caricatures of the four ''Beyond The Fringe'' cast members \u2013 the alcoholic Haig represents Cook, the tremulous Stapleton is Bennett, the parodically Jewish Pepperman is Miller, and the pianist Blint represents Moore.<ref>Peter Gordon, Dan Kieran Paul Hamilton (eds) \u2013 ''How Very Interesting: Peter Cook's Universe and All That Surrounds It'' (Matrix Media Services, 2006)</ref>\n\n===Amnesty International performances===\nCook appeared at the first three fund-raising galas staged by humorists [[John Cleese]] and [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]] on behalf of [[Amnesty International]]. The benefits were dubbed ''[[The Secret Policeman's Balls]]'', though it wasn't until the third show in 1979 that the title was used. He performed on all three nights of the first show in April 1976, ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'', as an individual performer and as a member of the cast of ''Beyond the Fringe'', which reunited for the first time since the 1960s. He also appeared in a [[Monty Python]] sketch, taking the place of [[Eric Idle]]. Cook was on the cast album of the show and in the film, ''[[Pleasure at Her Majesty's]]''. He was in the second Amnesty gala in May 1977, ''An Evening Without Sir Bernard Miles''. It was retitled ''The Mermaid Frolics'' for the cast album and TV special. Cook performed monologues and skits with [[Terry Jones]].\n\nIn June 1979, Cook performed all four nights of ''[[The Secret Policeman's Ball (1979)|The Secret Policeman's Ball]]'', teaming with [[John Cleese]]. Cook performed a couple of solo pieces and a sketch with [[Eleanor Bron]]. He also led the ensemble in the finale \u2013 the \"End of the World\" sketch from ''Beyond The Fringe''.\n\nIn response to a barb in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' that the show was recycled material, Cook wrote a satire of the summing-up by [[Mr Justice Cantley]] in the trial of former Liberal Party leader [[Jeremy Thorpe]], a summary now widely thought to show bias in favour of Thorpe. Cook performed it that same night (Friday 29 June \u2013 the third of the four nights) and the following night. The nine-minute opus, \"Entirely a Matter for You\", is considered by many fans and critics to be one of the finest works of Cook's career. Along with Cook, producer of the show Martin Lewis brought out an album on [[Virgin Records]] entitled ''Here Comes the Judge: Live'', containing the live performance together with three studio tracks that further lampooned the Thorpe trial.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phespirit.info/pictures/heroes/p008_info.htm |title=Peter Cook |publisher=Phespirit.info |accessdate=25 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113163211/http://www.phespirit.info/pictures/heroes/p008_info.htm |archivedate=13 January 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAlthough unable to take part in the 1981 gala, Cook supplied the narration over the animated opening title sequence of the 1982 film of the show. With Lewis, he wrote and voiced radio commercials to advertise the film in the UK. He also hosted a spoof film awards ceremony that was part of the world premi\u00e8re of the film in London in March 1982.\n\nFollowing Cook's 1987 stage reunion with Moore for the annual American benefit for the homeless, ''[[Comic Relief USA|Comic Relief]]'' (not related to the UK ''[[Comic Relief]]'' benefits), Cook repeated the reunion for a British audience by performing with Moore at the 1989 Amnesty benefit ''The Secret Policeman's Biggest Ball''.\n\n===1980s===\nCook starred in the [[LWT]] special ''Peter Cook & Co.'' in 1980. The show included comedy sketches, including a ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'' parody \"Tales of the Much As We Expected\". This involved Cook as [[Roald Dahl]], explaining his name had been Ronald before he dropped the \"n\". The cast included John Cleese, [[Rowan Atkinson]], [[Beryl Reid]], [[Paula Wilcox]] and [[Terry Jones]]. Partly spurred by Moore's growing film star status, Cook moved to Hollywood in that year, and appeared as an uptight English butler to a wealthy American woman in a short-lived United States television sitcom, ''[[The Two of Us (1981 TV series)|The Two of Us]]'', also making cameo appearances in a couple of undistinguished films.\n\nIn 1983, Cook played the role of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] in the first episode of ''[[The Black Adder|Blackadder]]'', \"[[The Foretelling]]\", which parodies [[Laurence Olivier]]'s portrayal. In 1984, he played the role of Nigel, the mathematics teacher, in [[Jeannot Szwarc]]'s film ''[[Supergirl (1984 film)|Supergirl]]'', working alongside the evil Selena played by [[Faye Dunaway]]. He then narrated the short film ''Diplomatix'' by Norwegian comedy trio [[Trond Kirkvaag|Kirkvaag]], [[Knut Lystad|Lystad]] and [[Lars Mj\u00f8en|Mj\u00f8en]], which won the \"Special Prize of the City of Montreux\" at the Montreux Comedy Festival in 1985. In 1986 he partnered [[Joan Rivers]] on her UK talk show. He appeared as Mr Jolly in 1987 in ''[[The Comic Strip Presents]]''' episode \"[[Mr. Jolly Lives Next Door]]\", playing an assassin who covers the sound of his murders by playing [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] records. That same year, Cook appeared in ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'' as the \"Impressive Clergyman\" who officiates at the wedding ceremony between Buttercup and Prince Humperdinck, uttering the now-famous line \"Mawage!\" Also that year, he spent time working with humourist Martin Lewis on a political satire about the [[U.S. presidential election, 1988|1988 US presidential elections]] for [[HBO]], but the script went unproduced. Lewis suggested that Cook team with Moore for the US ''[[Comic Relief]]'' telethon for the homeless. The duo reunited and performed their \"One Leg Too Few\" sketch.\n\nA 1984 commercial for [[John Harvey & Sons]] showed Cook at poolside party drinking Harvey's Bristol Cream [[sherry]]. He then says to \"throw away those silly little glasses\" whereupon the other party guests toss their [[sunglasses]] in the swimming pool.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrBaExAtwgw</ref>\n\nIn 1988, Cook appeared as a contestant on the improvisation comedy show ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]''. He was declared the winner, his prize being to read the credits in the style of a New York cab driver \u2013 a character he had portrayed in ''Peter Cook & Co.''\n\nCook occasionally called in to [[Clive Bull]]'s night-time phone-in radio show on [[LBC]] in London. Using the name \"Sven from Swiss Cottage\", he mused on love, loneliness and herrings in a mock Norwegian accent. Jokes included Sven's attempts to find his estranged wife, in which he often claimed to be telephoning the show from all over the world, and his hatred of the Norwegian obsession with fish. While Bull was clearly aware that Sven was fictional, he did not learn of the caller's real identity until later.\n\n===Revival===\nIn late 1989, Cook married for the third time, to [[Malaysia]]n-born property developer Chiew Lin Chong (1945\u20132016), in [[Torbay]], [[Devon]]. She provided him with some stability in his personal life, and he reduced his drinking to the extent that for a time he was [[Teetotalism|teetotal]]. He lived alone in a small 18th-century house in Perrins Walk,<!-- 51.554931, -0.178945 --> [[Hampstead]], while she kept her own property just {{convert|100|yd|-1}} away.\n\nCook returned to the BBC as Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling for an appearance with [[Ludovic Kennedy]] in ''A Life in Pieces''. The 12 interviews saw Sir Arthur recount his life, based  on the song \"[[Twelve Days of Christmas]]\". Unscripted interviews with Cook as Streeb-Greebling and satirist [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]] were recorded in late 1993 and broadcast as ''[[Why Bother? (radio show)|Why Bother?]]'' on [[BBC Radio 3]]. Morris described them:{{quote|It was a very different style of improvisation from what I'd been used to, working with people like [[Steve Coogan]], [[Doon Mackichan]] and [[Rebecca Front]], because ''[[On the Hour]]'' and ''[[The Day Today]]'' were about trying to establish a character within a situation, and Cook was really doing 'knight's move' and 'double knight's move' thinking to construct jokes or ridiculous scenes flipping back on themselves, and it was amazing. I mean, I held out no great hopes that he wouldn't be a boozy old sack of lard with his hair falling out and scarcely able to get a sentence out, because he hadn't given much evidence that that wouldn't be the case. But, in fact, he stumbled in with a Safeways bag full of Kestrel lager and loads of fags and then proceeded to skip about mentally with the agility of a grasshopper. Really quite extraordinary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stabbers.truth.posiweb.net/stabbers/html/spiggott/morris.htm |title=The Establishment \u2013 The Spiggott \u2013 Chris Morris Interview |publisher=Stabbers.truth.posiweb.net |accessdate=25 July 2009}}</ref>}}\n\nOn 17 December 1993, Cook appeared on ''[[Clive Anderson|Clive Anderson Talks Back]]'' as four characters \u2013 biscuit tester and alien abductee Norman House, football manager and motivational speaker Alan Latchley, judge Sir James Beauchamp, and rock legend Eric Daley. The following day, he appeared on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] performing links for ''[[Arena (UK TV series)|Arena]]'''s \"Radio Night\". He also appeared in the 1993 Christmas special of ''[[One Foot in the Grave]]'' (\"One Foot in the Algarve\"), playing a muckraking [[paparazzi|tabloid photographer]]. Before the end of the next year, his mother died, and a grief-stricken Cook returned to heavy drinking. He made his last television appearance on the show ''[[Pebble Mill at One]]'' in November 1994.\n\n==Personal life and death==\nCook was married three times. He was first married to Wendy Snowden, whom he met at university, in 1963; they had two daughters, Lucy and Daisy, but divorced in 1971.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/dec/08/arts.books|title=Wife's grief for wasted genius of Peter Cook|date=8 December 2002|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> Cook then married his second wife, model and actress [[Judy Huxtable]], in 1973, the marriage formally ending in 1989 after they had been separated for some years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/dec/08/arts.books|title=Wife's grief for wasted genius of Peter Cook|first1=Vanessa|last1=Thorpe|first2=|last2=arts|first3=media|last3=correspondent|date=8 December 2002|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2017|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> He married his third and final wife, Lin Chong, in 1989, to whom he remained married until his death.

On his death, some critics choose to see Cook's life as tragic, insofar as the brilliance of his youth had not been sustained in his later years. However, Cook himself always maintained he had no ambitions at all for sustained success. He assessed happiness by his friendships and his enjoyment of life. [[Eric Idle]] said Cook had not wasted his talent, but rather that the newspapers had tried to waste him.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSeveral friends honoured him with a dedication in the closing credits of ''[[Fierce Creatures]]'' (1997), a comedy film written by [[John Cleese]] about a zoo in peril of being closed. It starred Cleese alongside [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Kevin Kline]] and [[Michael Palin]]. The dedication displays photos and the lifespan dates of Cook and of British naturalist and humourist [[Gerald Durrell]].\n\nIn 1999, the [[minor planet]] [[20468 Petercook]], in the main asteroid belt, was named after Cook.<ref>{{cite web|author=Alan Chamberlin |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=20468 |title=Minor planet \"20468 Petercook\" at NASA website |publisher=Ssd.jpl.nasa.gov |accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nChannel 4 broadcast ''[[Not Only But Always]]'', a television film dramatising the relationship between Cook and Moore, with [[Rhys Ifans]] portraying Cook. At the [[2005 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]], a play, ''[[Pete and Dud: Come Again]]'' written by [[Chris Bartlett (writer)|Chris Bartlett]] and [[Nick Awde]], examined the relationship from Moore's view. The play was transferred to London's West End at The Venue in 2006 and toured the UK the following year. During the West End run, [[Tom Goodman-Hill]] starred as Cook, with [[Kevin Bishop]] as Moore.\n\nA green plaque to honour Cook was unveiled by the [[Westminster City Council]] and the Heritage Foundation at the site of the Establishment Club, at 18 Greek Street, on 15 February 2009 after an online campaign by satirist and event organiser Mark Biddiss, who also organised \u2018The World's 1st Peter Cook is Dead Birthday Party / Long overdue Public Wake\u2019 to promote the plaque, which featured a live reworking of Derek and Clive material, titled ''Derek & Clive are Alive Again''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theheritagefoundation.info/petercook.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225144043/http://www.theheritagefoundation.info/petercook.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 February 2010|title=Peter Cook Blue Plaque Unveiling|work=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=27 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nA [[blue plaque]] was unveiled by the Torbay Civic Society on 17 November 2014 at Cook's place of birth, \"Shearbridge\", Middle Warberry Road, Torquay, with his widow Lin and other members of the family in attendance.

He was a leading figure of the British [[satire boom]] of the 1960s, and associated with the [[anti-establishment]] comedic movement that emerged in the United Kingdom in the late 1950s.\n\nBorn in [[Torquay]], he was educated at the [[University of Cambridge]]. There he became involved with the [[Footlights|Footlights Club]], of which he later became president. After graduating he created the comedy stage revue ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'' beginning a long running partnership with [[Dudley Moore]]. In 1961, Cook opened the comedy club [[The Establishment (club)|The Establishment]] in [[Soho]], Central London. In 1965 Cook and Moore began a television career, beginning with ''[[Not Only... But Also]]''. Following the success of the show the duo appeared together in films ''[[The Wrong Box]]'' (1966) and ''[[Bedazzled (1967 film)|Bedazzled]]'' (1967). Cook and Moore returned to television projects continuing to the late 1970s, including co-presenting ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the United States. From 1978 until his death in 1995 Cook's collaboration with Moore was mostly over, but he continued to be a regular performer in British television and film.\n\nReferred to as \"the father of modern satire\" by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2005, Cook was ranked number one in the ''Comedians' Comedian'', a poll of more than 300 comics, comedy writers, producers, and directors throughout the English-speaking world.<ref>{{cite news |title=Peter Cook the funniest |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/People/Peter-Cook-the-funniest/2005/01/03/1104601276619.html |work=The Age |location=Australia |date=3 January 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Cook tops poll of comedy greats|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jan/02/arts.artsnews |work=The Guardian |date=2 January 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nCook was born at his parents' house, \"Shearbridge\", in Middle Warberry Road, [[Torquay]], [[Devon]]. He was the only son, and eldest of the three children, of Alexander Edward \"Alec\" Cook (1906\u20131984), a colonial [[Civil service|civil servant]] and his wife Ethel Catherine Margaret (1908\u20131994), daughter of solicitor Charles Mayo.<ref>Peter Cook: A Biography, Harry Thompson, Sceptre, 1998, p. 3</ref> His father served as [[political officer (British Empire)|political officer]] and later [[district officer]] in Nigeria, then as [[financial secretary]] to the colony of Gibraltar, followed by a return to Nigeria as [[Permanent Secretary]] of the Eastern Region based at [[Enugu]].<ref>Peter Cook: A Biography, Harry Thompson, Sceptre, 1998, p. 5, 21</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/remembering-peter-cook-family-and-friends-including-keith-richards-ronnie-wood-and-bruce-forsyth-9952941.html|title=Remembering Peter Cook: Family and friends - including Keith Richards,|date=3 January 2015|website=The Independent}}</ref> Cook's grandfather, Edward Arthur Cook (1869\u20131914), had also been a colonial civil servant, traffic manager for the [[Federated Malay States Railway]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]]; stress that he suffered, in the lead-up to an interview regarding promotion, led him to commit suicide. His wife, Minnie Jane (1869-1957; daughter of Thomas Wreford, of [[Thelbridge]] and [[Witheridge]], Devon, and of [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], of a prominent Devonshire family traced back to 1440),<ref>Records and Pedigree of the Wreford Family, George Wreford, second edition, 1909</ref><ref>A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Commoners of Great Britain and Ireland, ed.

IV, p. 454</ref> kept this fact secret; Peter Cook only discovered the truth when later researching his family.<ref>Peter Cook: A Biography, Harry Thompson, Sceptre, 1998, pp. 1-2</ref>\n\nCook was educated at [[Radley College]] and then went up to [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]], where he read French and German. As a student, Cook initially intended to become a career [[diplomat]] like his father, but Britain \"had run out of colonies\", as he put it.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Paxman |first1=Jeremy |authorlink=Jeremy Paxman |title=Empire |date=2012 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=9780670919598 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tQpOOnImnd4C&pg=PT340}}</ref> Although largely apathetic politically, particularly in later life when he displayed a deep distrust of politicians of all hues, he joined the [[Cambridge University Liberal Club]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://keynessociety.wordpress.com/about-the-keynes-society/ |title=About us \" Keynes Society |publisher=Keynessociety.wordpress.com |accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref> At Pembroke, Cook performed and wrote comedy sketches as a member of the Cambridge [[Footlights|Footlights Club]], of which he became president in 1960. His hero was fellow Footlights writer and Cambridge magazine writer [[David Nobbs]].<ref>I Didn't Get Where I am Today by David Nobbs 9780099421641</ref>\n\nWhile still at university Cook wrote for [[Kenneth Williams]], providing several sketches for Williams's hit [[West End theatre|West End]] comedy revue ''[[Pieces of Eight (1959 revue)|Pieces of Eight]]'' and much of the follow-up, ''[[One Over the Eight]]'', before finding prominence in his own right in a four-man group satirical stage show, ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'', alongside [[Jonathan Miller]], [[Alan Bennett]] and [[Dudley Moore]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Peter-Cook |title=Peter Edward Cook {{!}} British entertainer |work=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=2017-10-17 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n''Beyond the Fringe'' became a great success in London after being first performed at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] and included Cook impersonating the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], [[Harold Macmillan]]. This was one of the first occasions satirical political mimicry had been attempted in live theatre, and it shocked audiences. During one performance, Macmillan was in the theatre and Cook departed from his script and attacked him verbally.<ref>Cook as Macmillan: \"there's nothing I like better than to wander over to a theatre and sit there listening to a group of sappy, urgent, vibrant young satirists with a stupid great grin spread all over my silly face\", ''Tragically I Was an Only Twin'', p. 51.</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===1960s===\n[[File:Peter Cook Beyond the Fringe 1962.JPG|thumb|upright|Cook in the revue ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'']]\n\nIn 1961, Cook opened [[The Establishment (club)|The Establishment]], a club at 18 Greek Street in [[Soho]] in [[central London]], presenting fellow comedians in a nightclub setting, including American [[Lenny Bruce]]. Cook said it was a satirical venue modelled on \"those wonderful Berlin cabarets ... which did so much to stop the rise of Hitler and prevent the outbreak of the Second World War\";<ref>{{cite web.|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/02/28/1046407753895.html |title=Tom Lehrer interview |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=1 March 2003 |accessdate=16 September 2013}}</ref> as a members-only venue it was outside the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office|censorship restrictions]]. The Establishment's regular cabaret performers were [[Eleanor Bron]], [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]] and [[John Fortune]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1995/01/23/bedazzled |title=BEDAZZLED |work=The New Yorker |access-date=2018-08-12 |language=en-US}}</ref> \n  \nCook befriended and supported Australian comedian and actor [[Barry Humphries]], who began his British solo career at the club. Humphries said in his autobiography, ''My Life As Me'', that he found Cook's lack of interest in art and literature off-putting. Dudley Moore's jazz trio played in the basement of the club during the early 1960s. \n\nCook also opened an Establishment club in New York in 1963 and [[Lenny Bruce]] performed there, as well.<ref>[youtube.com/watch?v=PKu3Y5B|-c&t+328s20 January 1963 episode of ''What's My Line''].</ref>\n\nIn 1962, the [[BBC]] commissioned a pilot for a television series of satirical sketches based on the Establishment Club, but it was not immediately picked up and Cook went to [[New York City]] for a year to perform ''Beyond The Fringe'' on Broadway. When he returned, the pilot had been refashioned as ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]'' and had made a star of [[David Frost]], something Cook resented.\n\nThe 1960s [[satire boom]] was coming to an end and Cook said: \"England was about to sink giggling into the sea.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=4yE3UtuvCIKthQfny4CgAw&id=cBs-AQAAIAAJ&dq=sea+under+the+own+giggling+%22peter+cook%22+-wikipedia&q=sink+giggling#search_anchor |title=The Spectator, Volume 211 |year=1963|accessdate=16 September 2013}}</ref> He complained that Frost's success was based on copying Cook's own stage persona and Cook dubbed him \"the bubonic plagiarist\",<ref name=\"Hattenstone\">Simon Hattenstone [https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jul/02/david-frost-interview-frost-nixon \"The Saturday interview: David Frost\"], ''The Guardian'', 2 July 2011</ref> and said that his only regret in life, according to [[Alan Bennett]], had been saving Frost from drowning. This incident occurred in the summer of 1963, when the rivalry between the two men was at its height. Cook had realised that Frost's potential drowning would have looked deliberate if he had not been rescued.<ref>Humphrey Carpenter, ''That Was Satire That Was: The Satire Boom of the 1960s'', London: Victor Gollancz, 2000, pp. 270\u201371.</ref>\n\nAround this time, Cook provided financial backing for the satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'', supporting it through difficult periods, particularly in [[libel]] trials. Cook invested his own money and solicited investment from his friends. For a time, the magazine was produced from the premises of the Establishment Club. In 1963, Cook married Wendy Snowden; the couple had two daughters, Lucy and Daisy, but the marriage ended in 1970.\n\nCook's first regular television spot was on [[Granada Television]]'s ''Braden Beat'' with [[Bernard Braden]], where he featured his most enduring character: the static, dour and monotonal [[E. L. Wisty]], whom Cook had conceived for Radley College's Marionette Society.\n\n[[File:Dudley Moore Peter Cook Kraft Music Hall.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Cook and [[Dudley Moore]] in London for the US television programme ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'']]\n\nCook's [[Double act|comedy partnership]] with Dudley Moore led to ''[[Not Only... But Also]]''. This was originally intended by the BBC as a vehicle for Moore's music, but Moore invited Cook to write sketches and appear with him. Using few props, they created dry, absurd television that proved hugely popular and lasted for three series between 1965 and 1970. Cook played characters such as [[Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling]] and the two men created their [[Pete and Dud]] alter egos. Other sketches included \"Superthunderstingcar\", a parody of the [[Gerry Anderson]] marionette TV shows, and Cook's pastiche of 1960s trendy arts documentaries \u2013 satirised in a parodic segment on [[Greta Garbo]].\n\nWhen Cook learned a few years later that the videotapes of the series were to be [[Wiping|wiped]], a common practice at the time, he offered to buy the recordings from the BBC but was refused because of copyright issues. He suggested he could purchase new tapes so that the BBC would have no need to erase the originals, but this was also turned down. Of the original 22 programmes, only eight still survive complete. A compilation of six half-hour programmes, ''The Best of What's Left of Not Only...But Also'' was shown on television and has been released on both VHS and DVD.\n\nWith ''[[The Wrong Box]]'' (1966) and ''[[Bedazzled (1967 film)|Bedazzled]]'' (1967) Cook and Moore began to act in films together. Directed by [[Stanley Donen]], the underlying story of ''Bedazzled'' is credited to Cook and Moore and its screenplay to Cook. A comic parody of [[Faust]], it stars Cook as George Spigott (the [[Devil]]) who tempts Stanley Moon (Moore), a frustrated, short-order chef, with the promise of gaining his heart's desire \u2013 the unattainable beauty and waitress at his cafe, Margaret Spencer ([[Eleanor Bron]]) \u2013 in exchange for his soul, but repeatedly tricks him. The film features cameo appearances by [[Barry Humphries]] as Envy and [[Raquel Welch]] as Lust. Moore composed the soundtrack music and co-wrote (with Cook) the songs performed in the film. His jazz trio backed Cook on the theme, a parodic anti-love song, which Cook delivered in a deadpan monotone and included his familiar put-down, \"you fill me with inertia\".\n\nIn 1968, Cook and Moore briefly switched to [[Associated Television|ATV]] for four one-hour programmes titled ''[[Goodbye Again (TV)|Goodbye Again]]'', based on the Pete and Dud characters. Cook's increasing alcoholism led him to become reliant on cue cards; the show was not a popular success, owing in part to a strike causing the suspension of the publication of the ITV [[listings magazine]] ''[[TV Times]]''. [[John Cleese]] was a cast member.\n\n===1970s===\n[[File:Good Evening Dudley Moore Peter Cook 1975.JPG|thumb|Cook (right) and Moore performing in the revue ''Good Evening'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]]]\nIn 1970, Cook took over a project initiated by David Frost for a satirical film about an opinion pollster who rises to become President of Great Britain. Under Cook's guidance, the character became modelled on Frost. The film, ''[[The Rise and Rise of Michael Rimmer]]'', was not a success, although the cast contained notable names (including [[Monty Python]]'s John Cleese and [[Graham Chapman]], who co-wrote the film).\n\nCook became a favourite of the chat show circuit, but his own effort at hosting such a show for the BBC in 1971, ''Where Do I Sit?'', was said by the critics to have been a disappointment. He was replaced after only two episodes by [[Michael Parkinson]], the start of Parkinson's career as a chat show host. Parkinson later asked Cook what his ambitions were, Cook replied jocularly \"[...] in fact, my ambition is to shut you up altogether you see!\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0_xbprZFD0 |title=Peter Cook on \"Parkinson\" \u2013 Part 2 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=16 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nCook and Moore fashioned sketches from ''Not Only....But Also'' and ''Goodbye Again'' with new material into the stage revue called ''Behind the Fridge''. This show toured Australia in 1972 before transferring to New York City in 1973, re-titled as ''Good Evening''. Cook frequently appeared on and off stage the worse for drink. Nonetheless, the show proved very popular and it won [[Tony Award|Tony]] and [[Grammy Award]]s. When it finished, Moore stayed in the United States to pursue his film acting ambitions in Hollywood. Cook returned to Britain and in 1973 married the actress and model [[Judy Huxtable]].\n\nLater, the more risqu\u00e9 humour of Pete and Dud went farther on [[gramophone record|long-playing records]] as \"[[Derek and Clive]]\". The first recording was initiated by Cook to alleviate boredom during the Broadway run of ''Good Evening'', and used material conceived years before for the two characters but considered too outrageous. One of these audio recordings was also filmed, and therein tensions between the duo are seen to rise. [[Chris Blackwell]] circulated [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] copies to friends in the music business. The popularity of the recording convinced Cook to release it commercially, although Moore was initially reluctant, fearing that his rising fame as a Hollywood star would be undermined. Two further ''Derek and Clive'' albums were released, the last accompanied by a film.\n\nCook and Moore hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on 24 January 1976 during the show's first season. They did a number of their classic stage routines, including \"[[One Leg Too Few]]\" and \"Frog and Peach\" among others, in addition to participating in some skits with the show's ensemble cast.\n\nIn 1978, Cook appeared on the British music series ''[[Revolver (TV series)|Revolver]]'' as the manager of a ballroom where emerging punk and new wave acts played. For some groups, these were their first appearances on television. Cook's acerbic commentary was a distinctive aspect of the programme.\n\nIn 1979, Cook recorded comedy-segments as B-sides to the [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]] 12-inch singles \"Number One Song in Heaven\" and \"Tryouts for the Human Race\". The main songwriter [[Ron Mael]] often began with a banal situation in his lyrics, and then went at surreal tangents in the style of Cook and [[S. J. Perelman]].\n\n===''Consequences'' album===\nCook played multiple roles on the 1977 [[concept album]] ''[[Consequences (Godley & Creme album)|Consequences]]'', written and produced by former [[10cc]] members [[Kevin Godley]] and [[Lol Creme]]. A mixture of spoken comedy and [[progressive rock]] with an environmental subtext, ''Consequences'' started as a single that Godley and Creme planned to make to demonstrate their invention, an electric guitar effect called [[the Gizmo]], which they developed in 10cc. The project grew into a three-LP box set. The comedy sections were originally intended to be performed by a cast including [[Spike Milligan]] and [[Peter Ustinov]], but Godley and Creme eventually settled on Cook once they realised he could perform most parts himself.\n\nThe storyline centres on the impending divorce of ineffectual Englishman Walter Stapleton (Cook) and his French wife Lulu ([[Judy Huxtable]]). While meeting their lawyers \u2013 the bibulous Mr. Haig and overbearing Mr. Pepperman (both played by Cook) \u2013 the encroaching global catastrophe interrupts proceedings with bizarre and mysterious happenings, which seem to centre on Mr. Blint (Cook), a musician and composer living in the flat below Haig's office, to which it is connected by a large hole in the floor.\n\nAlthough it has since developed a cult following due to Cook's presence, ''Consequences'' was released as [[Punk rock|punk]] was sweeping the UK and proved a resounding commercial failure, savaged by critics who found the music self-indulgent. The script and story have evident connections to Cook's own life \u2013 his then wife Judy Huxtable plays Walter's wife. Cook's struggles with alcohol are mirrored in Haig's drinking, and there is a parallel between the fictional divorce of Walter and Lulu and Cook's own divorce from his first wife. The voice and accent Cook used for the character of Stapleton are similar to those of Cook's ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'' colleague, Alan Bennett, and a book on Cook's comedy, ''How Very Interesting'', speculates that the characters Cook plays in ''Consequences'' are caricatures of the four ''Beyond The Fringe'' cast members \u2013 the alcoholic Haig represents Cook, the tremulous Stapleton is Bennett, the parodically Jewish Pepperman is Miller, and the pianist Blint represents Moore.<ref>Peter Gordon, Dan Kieran Paul Hamilton (eds) \u2013 ''How Very Interesting: Peter Cook's Universe and All That Surrounds It'' (Matrix Media Services, 2006)</ref>\n\n===Amnesty International performances===\nCook appeared at the first three fund-raising galas staged by humorists [[John Cleese]] and [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]] on behalf of [[Amnesty International]]. The benefits were dubbed ''[[The Secret Policeman's Balls]]'', though it wasn't until the third show in 1979 that the title was used. He performed on all three nights of the first show in April 1976, ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'', as an individual performer and as a member of the cast of ''Beyond the Fringe'', which reunited for the first time since the 1960s. He also appeared in a [[Monty Python]] sketch, taking the place of [[Eric Idle]]. Cook was on the cast album of the show and in the film, ''[[Pleasure at Her Majesty's]]''. He was in the second Amnesty gala in May 1977, ''An Evening Without Sir Bernard Miles''. It was retitled ''The Mermaid Frolics'' for the cast album and TV special. Cook performed monologues and skits with [[Terry Jones]].\n\nIn June 1979, Cook performed all four nights of ''[[The Secret Policeman's Ball (1979)|The Secret Policeman's Ball]]'', teaming with [[John Cleese]]. Cook performed a couple of solo pieces and a sketch with [[Eleanor Bron]]. He also led the ensemble in the finale \u2013 the \"End of the World\" sketch from ''Beyond The Fringe''.\n\nIn response to a barb in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' that the show was recycled material, Cook wrote a satire of the summing-up by [[Mr Justice Cantley]] in the trial of former Liberal Party leader [[Jeremy Thorpe]], a summary now widely thought to show bias in favour of Thorpe. Cook performed it that same night (Friday 29 June \u2013 the third of the four nights) and the following night. The nine-minute opus, \"Entirely a Matter for You\", is considered by many fans and critics to be one of the finest works of Cook's career. Along with Cook, producer of the show Martin Lewis brought out an album on [[Virgin Records]] entitled ''Here Comes the Judge: Live'', containing the live performance together with three studio tracks that further lampooned the Thorpe trial.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phespirit.info/pictures/heroes/p008_info.htm |title=Peter Cook |publisher=Phespirit.info |accessdate=25 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113163211/http://www.phespirit.info/pictures/heroes/p008_info.htm |archivedate=13 January 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAlthough unable to take part in the 1981 gala, Cook supplied the narration over the animated opening title sequence of the 1982 film of the show. With Lewis, he wrote and voiced radio commercials to advertise the film in the UK. He also hosted a spoof film awards ceremony that was part of the world premi\u00e8re of the film in London in March 1982.\n\nFollowing Cook's 1987 stage reunion with Moore for the annual American benefit for the homeless, ''[[Comic Relief USA|Comic Relief]]'' (not related to the UK ''[[Comic Relief]]'' benefits), Cook repeated the reunion for a British audience by performing with Moore at the 1989 Amnesty benefit ''The Secret Policeman's Biggest Ball''.\n\n===1980s===\nCook starred in the [[LWT]] special ''Peter Cook & Co.'' in 1980. The show included comedy sketches, including a ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'' parody \"Tales of the Much As We Expected\". This involved Cook as [[Roald Dahl]], explaining his name had been Ronald before he dropped the \"n\". The cast included John Cleese, [[Rowan Atkinson]], [[Beryl Reid]], [[Paula Wilcox]] and [[Terry Jones]]. Partly spurred by Moore's growing film star status, Cook moved to Hollywood in that year, and appeared as an uptight English butler to a wealthy American woman in a short-lived United States television sitcom, ''[[The Two of Us (1981 TV series)|The Two of Us]]'', also making cameo appearances in a couple of undistinguished films.\n\nIn 1983, Cook played the role of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] in the first episode of ''[[The Black Adder|Blackadder]]'', \"[[The Foretelling]]\", which parodies [[Laurence Olivier]]'s portrayal. In 1984, he played the role of Nigel, the mathematics teacher, in [[Jeannot Szwarc]]'s film ''[[Supergirl (1984 film)|Supergirl]]'', working alongside the evil Selena played by [[Faye Dunaway]]. He then narrated the short film ''Diplomatix'' by Norwegian comedy trio [[Trond Kirkvaag|Kirkvaag]], [[Knut Lystad|Lystad]] and [[Lars Mj\u00f8en|Mj\u00f8en]], which won the \"Special Prize of the City of Montreux\" at the Montreux Comedy Festival in 1985. In 1986 he partnered [[Joan Rivers]] on her UK talk show. He appeared as Mr Jolly in 1987 in ''[[The Comic Strip Presents]]''' episode \"[[Mr. Jolly Lives Next Door]]\", playing an assassin who covers the sound of his murders by playing [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] records. That same year, Cook appeared in ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'' as the \"Impressive Clergyman\" who officiates at the wedding ceremony between Buttercup and Prince Humperdinck, uttering the now-famous line \"Mawage!\" Also that year, he spent time working with humourist Martin Lewis on a political satire about the [[U.S. presidential election, 1988|1988 US presidential elections]] for [[HBO]], but the script went unproduced. Lewis suggested that Cook team with Moore for the US ''[[Comic Relief]]'' telethon for the homeless. The duo reunited and performed their \"One Leg Too Few\" sketch.\n\nA 1984 commercial for [[John Harvey & Sons]] showed Cook at poolside party drinking Harvey's Bristol Cream [[sherry]]. He then says to \"throw away those silly little glasses\" whereupon the other party guests toss their [[sunglasses]] in the the swimming pool.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrBaExAtwgw</ref>\n\nIn 1988, Cook appeared as a contestant on the improvisation comedy show ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]''. He was declared the winner, his prize being to read the credits in the style of a New York cab driver \u2013 a character he had portrayed in ''Peter Cook & Co.''\n\nCook occasionally called in to [[Clive Bull]]'s night-time phone-in radio show on [[LBC]] in London. Using the name \"Sven from Swiss Cottage\", he mused on love, loneliness and herrings in a mock Norwegian accent. Jokes included Sven's attempts to find his estranged wife, in which he often claimed to be telephoning the show from all over the world, and his hatred of the Norwegian obsession with fish. While Bull was clearly aware that Sven was fictional, he did not learn of the caller's real identity until later.\n\n===Revival===\nIn late 1989, Cook married for the third time, to [[Malaysia]]n-born property developer Chiew Lin Chong (1945\u20132016), in [[Torbay]], [[Devon]]. She provided him with some stability in his personal life, and he reduced his drinking to the extent that for a time he was [[Teetotalism|teetotal]]. He lived alone in a small 18th-century house in Perrins Walk,<!-- 51.554931, -0.178945 --> [[Hampstead]], while she kept her own property just {{convert|100|yd|-1}} away.\n\nCook returned to the BBC as Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling for an appearance with [[Ludovic Kennedy]] in ''A Life in Pieces''. The 12 interviews saw Sir Arthur recount his life, based  on the song \"[[Twelve Days of Christmas]]\". Unscripted interviews with Cook as Streeb-Greebling and satirist [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]] were recorded in late 1993 and broadcast as ''[[Why Bother? (radio show)|Why Bother?]]'' on [[BBC Radio 3]]. Morris described them:{{quote|It was a very different style of improvisation from what I'd been used to, working with people like [[Steve Coogan]], [[Doon Mackichan]] and [[Rebecca Front]], because ''[[On the Hour]]'' and ''[[The Day Today]]'' were about trying to establish a character within a situation, and Cook was really doing 'knight's move' and 'double knight's move' thinking to construct jokes or ridiculous scenes flipping back on themselves, and it was amazing. I mean, I held out no great hopes that he wouldn't be a boozy old sack of lard with his hair falling out and scarcely able to get a sentence out, because he hadn't given much evidence that that wouldn't be the case. But, in fact, he stumbled in with a Safeways bag full of Kestrel lager and loads of fags and then proceeded to skip about mentally with the agility of a grasshopper. Really quite extraordinary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stabbers.truth.posiweb.net/stabbers/html/spiggott/morris.htm |title=The Establishment \u2013 The Spiggott \u2013 Chris Morris Interview |publisher=Stabbers.truth.posiweb.net |accessdate=25 July 2009}}</ref>}}\n\nOn 17 December 1993, Cook appeared on ''[[Clive Anderson|Clive Anderson Talks Back]]'' as four characters \u2013 biscuit tester and alien abductee Norman House, football manager and motivational speaker Alan Latchley, judge Sir James Beauchamp, and rock legend Eric Daley. The following day, he appeared on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] performing links for ''[[Arena (UK TV series)|Arena]]'''s \"Radio Night\". He also appeared in the 1993 Christmas special of ''[[One Foot in the Grave]]'' (\"One Foot in the Algarve\"), playing a muckraking [[paparazzi|tabloid photographer]]. Before the end of the next year, his mother died, and a grief-stricken Cook returned to heavy drinking. He made his last television appearance on the show ''[[Pebble Mill at One]]'' in November 1994.\n\n==Personal life and death==\nCook was married three times. He was first married to Wendy Snowden, whom he met at university, in 1963; they had two daughters, Lucy and Daisy, but divorced in 1971.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/dec/08/arts.books|title=Wife's grief for wasted genius of Peter Cook|date=8 December 2002|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> Cook then married his second wife, model and actress [[Judy Huxtable]], in 1973, the marriage formally ending in 1989 after they had been separated for some years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/dec/08/arts.books|title=Wife's grief for wasted genius of Peter Cook|first1=Vanessa|last1=Thorpe|first2=|last2=arts|first3=media|last3=correspondent|date=8 December 2002|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2017|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> He married his third and final wife, Lin Chong, in 1989, to whom he remained married until his death.

On his death, some critics choose to see Cook's life as tragic, insofar as the brilliance of his youth had not been sustained in his later years. However, Cook himself always maintained he had no ambitions at all for sustained success. He assessed happiness by his friendships and his enjoyment of life. [[Eric Idle]] said Cook had not wasted his talent, but rather that the newspapers had tried to waste him.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSeveral friends honoured him with a dedication in the closing credits of ''[[Fierce Creatures]]'' (1997), a comedy film written by [[John Cleese]] about a zoo in peril of being closed. It starred Cleese alongside [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Kevin Kline]] and [[Michael Palin]]. The dedication displays photos and the lifespan dates of Cook and of British naturalist and humourist [[Gerald Durrell]].\n\nIn 1999, the [[minor planet]] [[20468 Petercook]], in the main asteroid belt, was named after Cook.<ref>{{cite web|author=Alan Chamberlin |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=20468 |title=Minor planet \"20468 Petercook\" at NASA website |publisher=Ssd.jpl.nasa.gov |accessdate=15 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nChannel 4 broadcast ''[[Not Only But Always]]'', a television film dramatising the relationship between Cook and Moore, with [[Rhys Ifans]] portraying Cook. At the [[2005 Edinburgh Festival Fringe]], a play, ''[[Pete and Dud: Come Again]]'' written by [[Chris Bartlett (writer)|Chris Bartlett]] and [[Nick Awde]], examined the relationship from Moore's view. The play was transferred to London's West End at The Venue in 2006 and toured the UK the following year. During the West End run, [[Tom Goodman-Hill]] starred as Cook, with [[Kevin Bishop]] as Moore.\n\nA green plaque to honour Cook was unveiled by the [[Westminster City Council]] and the Heritage Foundation at the site of the Establishment Club, at 18 Greek Street, on 15 February 2009 after an online campaign by satirist and event organiser Mark Biddiss, who also organised \u2018The World's 1st Peter Cook is Dead Birthday Party / Long overdue Public Wake\u2019 to promote the plaque, which featured a live reworking of Derek and Clive material, titled ''Derek & Clive are Alive Again''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theheritagefoundation.info/petercook.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225144043/http://www.theheritagefoundation.info/petercook.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 February 2010|title=Peter Cook Blue Plaque Unveiling|work=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=27 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nA [[blue plaque]] was unveiled by the Torbay Civic Society on 17 November 2014 at Cook's place of birth, \"Shearbridge\", Middle Warberry Road, Torquay, with his widow Lin and other members of the family in attendance.

Previously, Saint-Genis-Pouilly was called Pouilly-Saint-Genis. Before that, the two towns were separately identified. Historically the spelling Saint-Genix had been widely used.\n\nIn his historical Atlas, G. Debombourg placed ''Pulliacum'' in the epoque of the second reign of the Bourgogne (879-1032) and he placed the church of Pouilly-St-Genis on the religious maps.<ref>Debombourg, Georges (1859). ''Atlas historique du d\u00e9partement actuel de l'Ain''. Printer: Louis Perrin.</ref>\nIn these \"Preuves\" he cites a text of 993 which mentions ''Pulliacum''.<ref>Debombourg, Georges (1859).

Its takeover of the Postes Royales (next to the current chapel) kickstarted the growth of the town and Pouilly-Saint-Genix soon became Saint-Genis-Pouilly.\n\n[[Pregnin]] figures in the Proc\u00e8s-verbaux du Directoire.<ref>{{cite web | last = Archives nationales | title = Proc\u00e8s-verbaux du Directoire, An V - An VIII, Tome 3 (p.97) | url = http://www.archivesnationales.culture.gouv.fr/chan/chan/pdf/sm/PV3.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-04-27 }}</ref>\nThe name of Saint-Genis, as in the case of [[Saint-Genis-Laval]], probably comes from [[Saint Genest]], a Roman comedian from the second half of the 3rd century, martryed under [[Diocletian]].<ref>Other origins have also been suggested.

A windmill on the site of St Genis can also be identified.\nThe road from Lyon to Geneva and the fork towards Gex are also clearly visible.

Today, the commune uses exclusively a modern logo which figures prominently on the pages of its Web site and in its publications.\n\n==Population==\nThe population of Saint-Genis-Pouilly has grown rapidly since the middle of the 1960s, largely due to the activities of CERN:\n{{Historical populations\n|align=left\n|1936|639\n|1946|612\n|1954|647\n|1962|904\n|1968|2030\n|1975|3549\n|1982|4631\n|1990|5696\n|1999|6383\n|2008|8379\n}}\n\n[[File:Population Saint-Genis-Pouilly 03.jpg|thumb|center|400px|Population History of Saint-Genis-Pouilly since 1936]]\n\nOne of the consequences of this rapid expansion of the population (along with those of the neighbouring communes in France and Switzerland) is the rapid increase in house prices.\nFor example, the price per square metre of an apartment in the Pays de Gex increased by 59% between 2000 and 2004, according to INSEE.<ref>{{cite journal | last = INSEE Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes | title = Prix des appartements: forte hausse du c\u00f4t\u00e9 fran\u00e7ais de l'agglom\u00e9ration transfrontali\u00e8re de Gen\u00e8ve | journal = La Lettre | volume =  | issue = 68 | pages =  | publisher =  | date = February 2007 | url = http://www.insee.fr/fr/insee_regions/rhone-alpes/rfc/docs/LA68.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-04-27 }}</ref>\n\nIts inhabitants are known as ''Saint-gen\u00e9siens''.\n\n===An international population===\nIn addition to CERN, the proximity of Switzerland and the international organisations headquartered in Geneva explains why a significant proportion of the population of the commune are foreigners.\nAccording to the census taken by INSEE in 1999, the commune contained amongst its {{Formatnum:6383}} inhabitants {{Formatnum:1697}} foreigners\n<ref>{{cite web | last = INSEE | title = Recensement de la population francaise de mars 1999 - Donn\u00e9s pour Saint-Genis-Pouilly | url = http://www.recensement.insee.fr/RP99/rp99/wr_page.affiche?p_id_nivgeo=C&p_id_loca=01354&p_id_princ=NAT2&p_theme=ALL&p_typeprod=ALL&p_langue=FR | accessdate = 2007-04-30 }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> (making 26.6%).\nBy way of comparison, the d\u00e9partement of Ain contains, at the time of the recent census, amongst its {{Formatnum:515478}} inhabitants {{Formatnum:40903}} foreigners<ref>{{cite web | last = INSEE | title = Recensement de la population francaise de mars 1999 - Donn\u00e9s pour l'Ain | url = http://www.recensement.insee.fr/FR/ST_ANA/D01/ALLALLNAT2NAT2AD01FR.html | access-date = 2007-04-30 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040818040911/http://www.recensement.insee.fr/FR/st_ana/d01/ALLALLNAT2NAT2AD01FR.html | archive-date = 2004-08-18 | df =  }}</ref> (making 7.9%).\n\n==Housing==\nMost housing in Saint-Genis-Pouilly is in apartment blocks (67.8%) and individual houses (31.3%).<ref>\nCategory of dwelling  [http://www.insee.fr/fr/recensement/nouv_recens/resultats/repartition/chiffres_cles/n3/01/n3_01354.pdf 2004 census].</ref> The apartment blocks are concentrated in the town of Saint-Genis.\n\nThe commune has a significantly larger proportion of individual residences to apartment blocks than the other communes in the district:\nMore than two-thirds (67.8%) of Saint-gen\u00e9siens live in apartment blocks, less than one ''Gessien'' in two (46.5%) live in apartments.<ref>Estimated from series R_MRP data of the [http://www.recensement.insee.fr/RP99/rp99/page_accueil.paccueil 1999 census] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806035236/http://www.recensement.insee.fr/RP99/rp99/page_accueil.paccueil |date=2007-08-06 }}. Using series P_LOGB yields sometimes different figures. This is due to the latter not distinguishing principal residences from the rest (therefore, communes having a large part of summer or winter seasonal lodging, mainly collective, are given a high collective lodging ratio, which does not reflect the habitat of the dwellers; this is the case of e.g. L\u00e9lex).</ref>\n\nThe majority of the population in the Pays de Gex, Ain, the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, and mainland France are [[owner-occupier]]s of their homes. In Saint-Genis-Pouilly, by contrast, the majority of the population live in rented accommodation (only 43.6% of individual residences are owner-occupied). Within the Pays de Gex, only Ferney-Voltaire has a lower proportion of owner occupiers (33.5%).<ref>[http://www.insee.fr/fr/recensement/nouv_recens/resultats/premiers-resultats-recensement.htm 2004 census].</ref>\nIt is possible that this peculiarity is explained by the large number of employees living in the two communities who work for international organisations.\n\n==Administration==\n\n===Elections===\nThe commune is presently administered by M.

The church is Roman, except for the choir which is Gothic.\n\nSome ruins from the small fortified ch\u00e2teau (from 13th century) are still visible in Flies.\nGallo-Roman sepulchres and others from the 6th-8th centuries can still be found in the cemetery surrounding the church at  Pouilly.\n\n===Science===\n[[CERN]] brings to the community an opening on to the world of physics which is perhaps unique in the world. Conferences are very frequently organised and some of these are open to the public. It is possible to visit the exhibition centre at CERN and also, with a prior appointment, to make a half day visit to CERN itself.\n\n===Theatre===\nThe construction of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Bordeau has finished and the theatre is now open. This modern theatre offers a 250-seat auditorium for use by amateur dramatic groups, dance, music and other dramatic arts.\n\n===Sculpture and related subjects===\nPregn'Art is an annual weekend event in the course of which several local artists exhibit their work in the gardens of the inhabitants of the hamlet of [[Pregnin]]. It is one of the events dedicated to sculpture and related subjects.\n\n===Traditions and folklore===\nThe principal fete of the commune is the Bird Festival \"La f\u00eate de l'oiseau\", which took place between 4 and 7 June on 2010.\n\n===Recreation===\nThe municipal swimming pool is the Piscine municipale de Saint-Genis.<ref>\"[http://saint-genis-pouilly.fr/la-piscine-municipale-de-saint-genis La piscine municipale de Saint-Genis].\" Saint-Genis-Pouilly.
