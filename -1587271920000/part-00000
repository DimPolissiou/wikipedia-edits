The traditional territorial lands extend eastwards from Ohiwa Harbour to Opape along the coastline, and inland to Matawai. These lands have long held an abundance of food resources, particularly seafood. Most of the [[marae]] of the iwi are located near the coast, historically to defend its marine resources.<ref name=\"teara\">{{cite web | author = Walker, Ranginui | title = Te Whakat\u014dhea | url = http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/NewZealanders/MaoriNewZealanders/TeWhakatohea/en | publisher = Te Ara \u2013 the Encyclopedia of New Zealand | date = 26 September 2006 | accessdate = 2 April 2007}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n\nWhakat\u014dhea can trace their history to the arrival of ''[[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]]'' settlers on the ''[[Nukutere]]'' and ''[[Mataatua]]'' [[M\u0101ori migration canoes|canoes]]. Whakat\u014dhea are the descendants of Muriwai, the eldest daughter of Wekanui and Ir\u0101kewa. Wekanui and Ir\u0101kewa had three children; Muriwai being the eldest followed by Toroa and Puhi. They also had a half brother, ''T\u0101neatua''. It is, according to Whakat\u014dhea legend that Muriwai spoke the famous words {{lang|mi|\"kia t\u016b whakat\u0101ne au i ahau\"}}, which is translated to \"make me stand like a man\". When ''[[M\u0101taatua]]'' was being swept back out to sea with no man to pull the ''[[waka (canoe)|waka]]'' back in. It was these famous words that gave her the right to pull the waka back to safety. It was from these words that ''[[Whakatane]]'' also gets its name.\n\nT\u016bt\u0101mure was a descendant of the ''Nukutere'' settlers, and was the leader of the Panenehu tribe. Hine-i-kauia was a descendant of the ''Mataatua'' settlers, who arrived in New Zealand nine generations after the ''Nukutere'' settlers. T\u016bt\u0101mure and Hine-i-kauia were married, and their descendants would eventually form the Ng\u0101ti Ruat\u0101kena hapu.  The ancestral house at Omarumutu marae is named Tutamure and the dining room is named Hine-i-kauia.\n\nFor centuries, Whakat\u014dhea fought many battles with their neighbours, including [[Ng\u0101itai|Ng\u0101i Tai]] in the east, [[Ng\u0101ti Awa]] and [[Ng\u0101i T\u016bhoe]] in the west.<ref name=\"teara\" />\n\n===Modern history===\n\nThe iwi initially had good relations with European settlers and Christian missionaries. However, in 1865, following the murder of German missionary [[Carl V\u00f6lkner]], and with increasing demands from European settlers for more land, Crown soldiers invaded Te Whakat\u014dhea land. Almost 600&nbsp;km\u00b2 of Whakat\u014dhea land was confiscated by the Crown under the ''New Zealand Settlements Act of 1863''.\n\nDuring the twentieth century there was increasing recognition that Whakat\u014dhea had suffered grievances at the hands of the Crown. In 1996, the New Zealand government signed a Deed of Settlement, acknowledging and apologising for the invasion and confiscation of Whakat\u014dhea lands, and the subsequent economic, cultural and developmental devastation suffered by the iwi. Whakat\u014dhea are presently preparing to negotiate a full settlement with the New Zealand government.<ref name=\"teara\" />\n\n==Hap\u016b and marae==\n\n===Te \u016apokorehe===\n\nTe \u016apokorehe is an iwi in its own right.  Their ancestral boundaries commence from Maraetotara (Ohope) in the west to the middle of Waioeka River (\u014cp\u014dtiki) in the east. Upokorehe Iwi boundaries fall within the \u014cp\u014dtiki District and Whakat\u0101ne District Catchments.  Roimata Marae holds the mauri of Upokorehe Iwi.  Upokorehe does not have the same whakapapa (ancestry) as Whakat\u014dhea.  In 1952 the Whakat\u014dhea Maori Trust Board was established and Upokorehe was included as a hapu with the intention and expectation of our Upokorehe rangatira/kaumatua at the time to return lands to Upokorehe which were taken as part of the raupatu.  Today, Upokorehe Iwi have been recognised as an Iwi in their own right and as such were included by Statistics NZ in the 2018 census. Upokorehe Iwi have established their own mandated treaty claims trust (Te Upokorehe Treaty Claims Trust) to represent their raupatu claims.  Te Upokorehe Iwi are also calling for a full Waitangi Tribunal Hearing, to ensure their story can be told and their whakapapa and hitori will not be lost or usurped by Whakat\u014dhea Iwi.  \n\nThere are five marae situated in the Upokorehe Iwi boundaries.  (Marae is an Ancestral Meeting house and Wharekai (Dining Room) situated on ancestral land. A place of gathering for people of Upokorehe Iwi ) \n* Roimata Marae location overlooking Ohiwa Harbour, Hiwarau Road, Kutarere.\n* Kutarere marae location Kutarere main road.\n* Maromahue marae location Waiotahe Valley, off main road, inland.\n* Rongopopoia marae location further up Waiotahe Valley at Kahikatea, off main road, inland.\n* Turangapikitoi marae location Wainui on the main road between Kutarere and Ohope.\n\n\n==Governance==\n\n===Whakat\u014dhea M\u0101ori Trust Board===\n\nThe Whakat\u014dhea M\u0101ori Trust Board was established in 1952 to administer the assets of the iwi, and provides members with education, health services and training in various commercial fields.<ref name=\"official\" /> It is a charitable trust governed by two representatives from each of the six hap\u016b, and based in \u014cp\u014dtiki. It is also accountable to the Minister of Maori Affairs and is governed by the Maori Trust Boards Act. <ref name=\"tkmentry\" />\n\nThe trust represents the tribe's fisheries interest under the M\u0101ori Fisheries Act 2004, and its aquaculture interests under the M\u0101ori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act 2004. It represents the tribe during consultation on resource consent applications under the [[Resource Management Act 1991]].  The trust board does not have a resource management plan, but Upokorehe Iwi have an active resource management team and Upokorehe iwi resource management plan which they have used in their role as iwi to manage and protect the resources within their ancestral boundaries, including Ohiwa Harbour which is situated in the rohe (boundaries) of Upokorehe Iwi.

The traditional territorial lands extend eastwards from Ohiwa Harbour to Opape along the coastline, and inland to Matawai. These lands have long held an abundance of food resources, particularly seafood. Most of the [[marae]] of the iwi are located near the coast, historically to defend its marine resources.<ref name=\"teara\">{{cite web | author = Walker, Ranginui | title = Te Whakat\u014dhea | url = http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/NewZealanders/MaoriNewZealanders/TeWhakatohea/en | publisher = Te Ara \u2013 the Encyclopedia of New Zealand | date = 26 September 2006 | accessdate = 2 April 2007}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n\nWhakat\u014dhea can trace their history to the arrival of ''[[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]]'' settlers on the ''[[Nukutere]]'' and ''[[Mataatua]]'' [[M\u0101ori migration canoes|canoes]]. Whakat\u014dhea are the descendants of Muriwai, the eldest daughter of Wekanui and Ir\u0101kewa. Wekanui and Ir\u0101kewa had three children; Muriwai being the eldest followed by Toroa and Puhi. They also had a half brother, ''T\u0101neatua''. It is, according to Whakat\u014dhea legend that Muriwai spoke the famous words {{lang|mi|\"kia t\u016b whakat\u0101ne au i ahau\"}}, which is translated to \"make me stand like a man\". When ''[[M\u0101taatua]]'' was being swept back out to sea with no man to pull the ''[[waka (canoe)|waka]]'' back in. It was these famous words that gave her the right to pull the waka back to safety. It was from these words that ''[[Whakatane]]'' also gets its name.\n\nT\u016bt\u0101mure was a descendant of the ''Nukutere'' settlers, and was the leader of the Panenehu tribe. Hine-i-kauia was a descendant of the ''Mataatua'' settlers, who arrived in New Zealand nine generations after the ''Nukutere'' settlers. T\u016bt\u0101mure and Hine-i-kauia were married, and their descendants would eventually form the Ng\u0101ti Ruat\u0101kena hapu.  The ancestral house at Omarumutu marae is named Tutamure and the dining room is named Hine-i-kauia.\n\nFor centuries, Whakat\u014dhea fought many battles with their neighbours, including [[Ng\u0101itai|Ng\u0101i Tai]] in the east, [[Ng\u0101ti Awa]] and [[Ng\u0101i T\u016bhoe]] in the west.<ref name=\"teara\" />\n\n===Modern history===\n\nThe iwi initially had good relations with European settlers and Christian missionaries. However, in 1865, following the murder of German missionary [[Carl V\u00f6lkner]], and with increasing demands from European settlers for more land, Crown soldiers invaded Te Whakat\u014dhea land. Almost 600&nbsp;km\u00b2 of Whakat\u014dhea land was confiscated by the Crown under the ''New Zealand Settlements Act of 1863''.\n\nDuring the twentieth century there was increasing recognition that Whakat\u014dhea had suffered grievances at the hands of the Crown. In 1996, the New Zealand government signed a Deed of Settlement, acknowledging and apologising for the invasion and confiscation of Whakat\u014dhea lands, and the subsequent economic, cultural and developmental devastation suffered by the iwi. Whakat\u014dhea are presently preparing to negotiate a full settlement with the New Zealand government.<ref name=\"teara\" />\n\n==Hap\u016b and marae==\n\n===Te \u016apokorehe===\n\nTe \u016apokorehe is an iwi in its own right.  Their ancestral boundaries commence from Maraetotara (Ohope) in the west to the middle of Waioeka River (\u014cp\u014dtiki) in the east. Upokorehe Iwi boundaries fall within the \u014cp\u014dtiki District and Whakat\u0101ne District Catchments.  Roimata Marae holds the mauri of Upokorehe Iwi.  Upokorehe does not have the same whakapapa (ancestry) as Whakatohea.  In 1952 the Whakatohea Maori Trust Board was established and Upokorehe was included as a hapu with the intention and expectation of our Upokorehe rangatira/kaumatua at the time to return lands to Upokorehe which were taken as part of the raupatu.  Today, Upokorehe Iwi have been recognised as an Iwi in their own right and as such were included by Statistics NZ in the 2018 census. Upokorehe Iwi have established their own mandated treaty claims trust (Te Upokorehe Treaty Claims Trust) to represent their raupatu claims.  Te Upokorehe Iwi are also calling for a full Waitangi Tribunal Hearing, to ensure their story can be told and their whakapapa and hitori will not be lost or usurped by Whakatohea Iwi.  \n\nThere are five marae situated in the Upokorehe Iwi boundaries.  (Marae is an Ancestral Meeting house and Wharekai (Dining Room) situated on ancestral land. A place of gathering for people of Upokorehe Iwi ) \n* Roimata Marae location overlooking Ohiwa Harbour, Hiwarau Road, Kutarere.\n* Kutarere marae location Kutarere main road.\n* Maromahue marae location Waiotahe Valley, off main road, inland.\n* Rongopopoia marae location further up Waiotahe Valley at Kahikatea, off main road, inland.\n* Turangapikitoi marae location Wainui on the main road between Kutarere and Ohope.\n\n\n==Governance==\n\n===Whakat\u014dhea M\u0101ori Trust Board===\n\nThe Whakat\u014dhea M\u0101ori Trust Board was established in 1952 to administer the assets of the iwi, and provides members with education, health services and training in various commercial fields.<ref name=\"official\" /> It is a charitable trust governed by two representatives from each of the six hap\u016b, and based in \u014cp\u014dtiki. It is also accountable to the Minister of Maori Affairs and is governed by the Maori Trust Boards Act. <ref name=\"tkmentry\" />\n\nThe trust represents the tribe's fisheries interest under the M\u0101ori Fisheries Act 2004, and its aquaculture interests under the M\u0101ori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act 2004. It represents the tribe during consultation on resource consent applications under the [[Resource Management Act 1991]].  The trust board does not have a resource management plan, but Upokorehe Iwi have an active resource management team and Upokorehe iwi resource management plan which they have used in their role as iwi to manage and protect the resources within their ancestral boundaries, including Ohiwa Harbour which is situated in the rohe (boundaries) of Upokorehe Iwi.  Upokorehe Iwi continue to actively practice their ancestral customs and traditions to gather kai (food) within their rohe.  <ref name=\"tkmentry\" />\n\nUpokorehe Iwi does not believe the Whakatohea Maori Trust Board is the appropriate entity to represent their interests into the future.

The first stable line-up consisted of bandleader [[Brian Jones]] (guitar, harmonica, keyboards), [[Mick Jagger]] (lead vocals, harmonica), [[Keith Richards]] (guitar, vocals), [[Bill Wyman]] (bass guitar), [[Charlie Watts]] (drums), and [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] (piano). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued to work with the band as a contracted musician until his death in 1985. The band's primary songwriters, [[Jagger\u2013Richards]], assumed leadership after [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] became the group's manager. Jones left the band less than a month before his death in 1969, having already been replaced by [[Mick Taylor]]. Taylor left in 1974 and was replaced in 1975 by [[Ronnie Wood]] who has since remained. Since Wyman's departure in 1993, [[Darryl Jones]] has served as touring bassist. The Stones have not had an official keyboardist since 1963, but have employed several musicians in that role, including [[Jack Nitzsche]] (1965\u20131971), [[Nicky Hopkins]] (1967\u20131982), [[Billy Preston]] (1971\u20131981), [[Ian McLagan]] (1978\u20131981), and [[Chuck Leavell]] (1982\u2013present).\n\nThe Rolling Stones were at the forefront of the [[British Invasion]] of bands that became popular in the United States in 1964 and were identified with the youthful and rebellious [[counterculture of the 1960s]]. Rooted in [[blues]] and early [[rock and roll]], the band started out playing covers but found more success with their own material; songs such as \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\" and \"[[Paint It Black]]\" became international hits, and ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966) \u2013 their first entirely original album \u2013 has been considered the most important of the band's formative records.<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news|date=17 May 2018|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/rolling-stones-defining-moments/aftermath-released-1966although-their-first-two-albums--the-roll/|title=Aftermath released, 1966|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=27 November 2018}}</ref> After a short period of experimentation with [[psychedelic rock]] in the mid-1960s, the group returned to its \"bluesy\" roots with ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' (1968), ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' (1969), ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971), and ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' (1972).

During the 1980s, the band infighting curtailed their output and they only released two more underperforming albums and did not tour for the rest of the decade. Their fortunes changed at the end of the decade, when they released ''[[Steel Wheels]]'' (1989), promoted by a large stadium and arena tour, the [[Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour]]. Since the 1990s, new material has been less frequent. Despite this, the Rolling Stones continue to be a huge attraction on the live circuit. By 2007, the band had four of the top five [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing concert tours]] of all time: [[Voodoo Lounge Tour]] (1994\u20131995), [[Bridges to Babylon Tour]] (1997\u20131998), [[Licks Tour]] (2002\u20132003) and [[A Bigger Bang (concert tour)|A Bigger Bang]] (2005\u20132007).{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=141}} Musicologist [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] attributes the endurance of the Rolling Stones to their being \"rooted in traditional verities, in rhythm-and-blues and soul music\", while \"more ephemeral pop fashions have come and gone\".<ref>{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Palmer|authorlink=Robert Palmer (writer)|date=27 December 1981|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/27/arts/the-year-of-the-rolling-stones.html|title=The Year of the Rolling Stones|newspaper=New York Times|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701174542/http://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/27/arts/the-year-of-the-rolling-stones.html|archivedate=1 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Rolling Stones were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1989 and the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2004. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked them fourth on the \"[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]]\" list and their [[List of best-selling music artists|estimated record sales]] is 200&nbsp;million. They have [[The Rolling Stones discography|released]] 30 studio albums, 23 live albums and numerous compilations. ''Let It Bleed'' (1969) marked the first of five consecutive No.&nbsp;1 studio and live albums in the UK. ''Sticky Fingers'' (1971) was the first of eight consecutive No.&nbsp;1 studio albums in the US. In 2008, the band ranked 10th on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists chart. In 2012, the band celebrated its 50th anniversary. They still continue to release albums to brisk sales and critical acclaim; their most recent album ''[[Blue & Lonesome (Rolling Stones album)|Blue & Lonesome]]'' was released in December 2016 and reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 4 in the US and won a [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album]].

Brian Jones experimented with the use of non-traditional instruments such as the [[sitar]] and [[slide guitar]] in their early days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/brian-jones-rolling-stones-songs/|title=Top 10 Brian Jones Rolling Stones Songs|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en-US|access-date=18 August 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725181034/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/brian-jones-rolling-stones-songs/|archivedate=25 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/brian-jones-multi-instrumentalist-songs/|title=Top 10 Brian Jones Rolling Stones Multi-Instrumentalist Songs|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en-US|access-date=18 August 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710161316/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/brian-jones-multi-instrumentalist-songs/|archivedate=10 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gn24CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=Brian+Jones+non-traditional+instruments+such+as+the+sitar+and+slide+guitar+in+their+early+days#v=onepage&q=Brian%20Jones%20non-traditional%20instruments%20such%20as%20the%20sitar%20and%20slide%20guitar%20in%20their%20early%20days&f=false|title=Massive Pissed Love: Nonfiction 2001\u20132014|last=Hell|first=Richard|date=1 October 2015|publisher=Soft Skull Press|isbn=9781619026742|pages=23|language=en}}</ref> The group started out covering early rock 'n' roll and blues songs, and have never stopped playing live or recording [[cover song]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/time-is-on-my-side-mt0004159585|title=Time Is on My Side \u2013 The Rolling Stones : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards|website=AllMusic|accessdate=22 November 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904024728/http://www.allmusic.com/song/time-is-on-my-side-mt0004159585|archivedate=4 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nJagger and Richards had a shared admiration of [[Jimmy Reed]], Muddy Waters,<ref name=\":18\">{{Cite journal|last=Hellmann|first=John M.|date=1973|title='I'm a Monkey': The Influence of the Black American Blues Argot on the Rolling Stones|journal=The Journal of American Folklore|volume=86|issue=342|pages=367\u2013373|doi=10.2307/539360|jstor=539360}}</ref> and [[Howlin' Wolf]].<ref name=\":18\" /> [[Little Walter]] influenced Brian Jones.

The first stable line-up consisted of bandleader [[Brian Jones]] (guitar, harmonica, keyboards), [[Mick Jagger]] (lead vocals, harmonica), [[Keith Richards]] (guitar, vocals), [[Bill Wyman]] (bass guitar), [[Charlie Watts]] (drums), and [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] (piano). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued to work with the band as a contracted musician until his death in 1985. The band's primary songwriters, [[Jagger\u2013Richards]], assumed leadership after [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] became the group's manager. Jones left the band less than a month before his death in 1969, having already been replaced by [[Mick Taylor]]. Taylor left in 1974 and was replaced in 1975 by [[Ronnie Wood]] who has since remained. Since Wyman's departure in 1993, [[Darryl Jones]] has served as touring bassist. The Stones have not had an official keyboardist since 1963, but have employed several musicians in that role, including [[Jack Nitzsche]] (1965\u20131971), [[Nicky Hopkins]] (1967\u20131982), [[Billy Preston]] (1971\u20131981), [[Ian McLagan]] (1978\u20131981), and [[Chuck Leavell]] (1982\u2013present).\n\nThe Rolling Stones were at the forefront of the [[British Invasion]] of bands that became popular in the United States in 1964 and were identified with the youthful and rebellious [[counterculture of the 1960s]]. Rooted in [[blues]] and early [[rock and roll]], the band started out playing covers but found more success with their own material; songs such as \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\" and \"[[Paint It Black]]\" became international hits, and ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966) \u2013 their first entirely original album \u2013 has been considered the most important of the band's formative records.<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news|date=17 May 2018|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/rolling-stones-defining-moments/aftermath-released-1966although-their-first-two-albums--the-roll/|title=Aftermath released, 1966|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=27 November 2018}}</ref> After a short period of experimentation with [[psychedelic rock]] in the mid-1960s, the group returned to its \"bluesy\" roots with ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' (1968), ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' (1969), ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971), and ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' (1972).

During the 1980s, the band infighting curtailed their output and they only released two more underperforming albums and did not tour for the rest of the decade. Their fortunes changed at the end of the decade, when they released ''[[Steel Wheels]]'' (1989), promoted by a large stadium and arena tour, the [[Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour]]. Since the 1990s, new material has been less frequent. Despite this, the Rolling Stones continue to be a huge attraction on the live circuit. By 2007, the band had four of the top five [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing concert tours]] of all time: [[Voodoo Lounge Tour]] (1994\u20131995), [[Bridges to Babylon Tour]] (1997\u20131998), [[Licks Tour]] (2002\u20132003) and [[A Bigger Bang (concert tour)|A Bigger Bang]] (2005\u20132007).{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=141}} Musicologist [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] attributes the endurance of the Rolling Stones to their being \"rooted in traditional verities, in rhythm-and-blues and soul music\", while \"more ephemeral pop fashions have come and gone\".<ref>{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Palmer|authorlink=Robert Palmer (writer)|date=27 December 1981|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/27/arts/the-year-of-the-rolling-stones.html|title=The Year of the Rolling Stones|newspaper=New York Times|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701174542/http://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/27/arts/the-year-of-the-rolling-stones.html|archivedate=1 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Rolling Stones were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1989 and the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2004. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked them fourth on the \"[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]]\" list and their [[List of best-selling music artists|estimated record sales]] is 200&nbsp;million. They have [[The Rolling Stones discography|released]] 30 studio albums, 23 live albums and numerous compilations. ''Let It Bleed'' (1969) marked the first of five consecutive No.&nbsp;1 studio and live albums in the UK. ''Sticky Fingers'' (1971) was the first of eight consecutive No.&nbsp;1 studio albums in the US. In 2008, the band ranked 10th on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists chart. In 2012, the band celebrated its 50th anniversary.
