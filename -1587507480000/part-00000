Walpole is also the longest-serving British prime minister by this definition.{{sfn|BBC News|1998}} However, [[Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] was the first and [[Margaret Thatcher]] the longest-serving prime minister officially referred to as such in the order of precedence.{{sfnm|1a1=Mackay|1y=1987|2a1=Marriott|2y=1923|2p=83}} The first to use the title in an official act was [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who signed the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] as \"Prime Minister of her Britannic Majesty\" in 1878.{{sfn|Bogdanor|1997}}\n\nStrictly, the first prime minister of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom (of Great Britain and Ireland)]] was [[William Pitt the Younger]].{{sfnm|1a1=Burt|1y=1874|1p=106|2a1=Castlereagh|2y=1805}} The first prime minister of the current United Kingdom, i.e. the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, was [[Bonar Law]],{{sfn|Law|1922}} although the country was not renamed officially until 1927, when [[Stanley Baldwin]] was the serving prime minister.{{sfn|Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act|1927}}\n\nDue to the gradual evolution of the post of prime minister, the title is applied to early prime ministers only retrospectively;{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=1}} this has sometimes given rise to academic dispute. [[William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath|Lord Bath]] and [[James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave|Lord Waldegrave]] are sometimes listed as prime ministers.{{sfn|Carpenter|1992|page=37}} Bath was invited to [[Short-lived ministry|form a ministry]] by [[George II of Great Britain|{{nowrap|George II}}]] when [[Henry Pelham]] resigned in 1746,{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=47}} as was Waldegrave in 1757 after the dismissal of [[William Pitt the Elder]],{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=65}} who dominated the affairs of government [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|during the Seven Years' War]]. Neither was able to command sufficient parliamentary support to form a government; Bath stepped down after two days,{{sfn|Carpenter|1992|page=37}} and Waldegrave after three.{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=65}} Modern academic consensus does not consider either man to have held office as prime minister,{{sfn|''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''|2011}} and they are therefore listed separately.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Before 1721== \nPrior to the [[Georgian era]], the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]] was led by the [[Lord High Treasurer]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911f}} By the late [[Tudor period]], the Lord High Treasurer was regarded as one of the [[Great Officers of State]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911f}} and was often (though not always) the dominant figure in government: [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] (Lord High Treasurer, 1547\u20131549),{{sfn|Pollard|1904}} served as [[Lord Protector]] to his prepubescent nephew [[Edward VI of England|{{nowrap|Edward VI}}]];{{sfn|Pollard|1904}} [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]] (Lord High Treasurer, 1572\u20131598),{{sfn|Chisholm|1911a}} was the dominant [[List of ministers to Queen Elizabeth I|minister to {{nowrap|Elizabeth I}}]];{{sfn|Chisholm|1911a}} Burghley's son [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]], succeeded his father as chief minister to {{nowrap|Elizabeth I}} (1598\u20131603) and was eventually appointed by [[James VI and I|{{nowrap|James I}}]] as Lord High Treasurer (1608\u20131612).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911c}}\n\nBy the late [[Stuart period]], the Treasury was often run not by a single individual, i.e. Lord High Treasurer, but by a [[wikt:commission#Noun|commission]] of [[Lords of the Treasury]],{{sfn|Chapman|2002}} led by the [[First Lord of the Treasury]]. The last Lords High Treasurer, [[Lord Godolphin]] (1702\u20131710) and [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Lord Oxford]] (1711\u20131714),{{sfnm|1a1=Fisher Russell Barker|1y=1890|2a1=Stephen|2y=1890}} ran the government of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].{{sfn|Morrill|2018}}\n\nAfter the succession of [[George I of Great Britain|{{nowrap|George I}}]] in 1714, the arrangement of a commission of Lords of the Treasury (as opposed to a single Lord High Treasurer) became permanent.{{sfn|Chapman|2002|page=15}} For the next three years, the government was headed by [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Lord Townshend]], who was appointed [[Secretary of State for the Northern Department]].{{sfn|McMullen Rigg|1899}} Subsequently, [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]] and [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|Lord Sunderland]] ran the government jointly,{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911d|2a1=Chisholm|2y=1911e}} with Stanhope managing foreign affairs and Sunderland domestic.{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911d|2a1=Chisholm|2y=1911e}} Stanhope died in February 1721 and Sunderland resigned two months later;{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911d|2a1=Chisholm|2y=1911e}} Townshend and [[Robert Walpole]] were then invited to form the next government.{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911b|2a1=McMullen Rigg|2y=1899}} From that point, the holder of the {{em|office}} of First Lord also usually (albeit unofficially) held the status of prime minister.

Christopher Willoughby's mother, Cecily Welles, was thus a step sister of [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Margaret Beaufort]].{{sfn|Richardson IV|2011|pp=221-3}}\n\n==Career==\nChristopher Willoughby had livery of his lands on 15 July 1474. His second cousin, [[Joan Welles, 9th Baroness Willoughby de Eresby]], died about that time. The exact date of her death is not known; however she likely died shortly before her father, [[Richard Welles, 7th Baron Welles]], and brother, [[Robert Welles, 8th Baron Willoughby de Eresby]], were [[Attainder|attainted]], five years after their executions, by the Parliament of January\u2013March 1475. As a result of the attainders, all their honours were forfeited, including the baronies of Welles and Willoughby, which should have been inherited, respectively, after Joan Welles' death, by her uncle of the half blood, [[John Welles, 1st Viscount Welles]], and her second cousin, Christopher Willoughby.{{sfn|Richardson IV|2011|p=339}}{{sfn|Cokayne|1959|p=668}}{{sfn|Burke|1831|p=562}} According to some historians, the attainders were passed by Parliament in order to enable [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] to grant Joan Welles' lands after her death to her husband, 'the trusted [[House of York|Yorkist]] [[Richard Hastings, Baron Welles|Sir Richard Hastings]]',{{sfn|Jones|Underwood|1992|p=126}} and accordingly, on 23 January 1475, the King granted Hastings a life interest in the greater part of the Welles and Willoughby estates. Moreover, Hastings was summoned to Parliament from 14 November 1482 to 9 December 1483 by writs directed ''Ricardo Hastyng de Wellys'', whereby he is held to have become either Lord Hastings of Welles, or Lord Welles.{{sfn|Hicks|2004}}{{sfn|Cokayne|1959|p=447}}{{sfn|Richardson IV|2011|p=339}}{{sfn|Cokayne|1959|p=668}}{{sfn|Burke|1831|p=562}}\n\nWilloughby was made a [[Order of the Bath|Knight of the Bath]] at the coronation of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] on 7 July 1483, and served frequently on commissions in Suffolk from 1483 to 1497.\n\nUnder [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], the attainders of Joan Welles' father and brother, as well as the attainder of her uncle, [[John Welles, 1st Viscount Welles|John Welles]], were all reversed by the Parliament of 1485/6. John Welles was still living, and with the reversal of his attainder became Lord Welles. Joan Welles' former husband, Sir Richard Hastings, was thus no longer recognized as Lord Welles. In compensation, however, it was enacted in the same year that Hastings should be entitled, for life, to all the lands which had belonged to Joan Welles' father.

Ideologically an [[African nationalism|African nationalist]] and [[African socialism|African socialist]], he was at the forefront of a grassroots anti-apartheid campaign known as the [[Black Consciousness Movement]] during the late 1960s and 1970s. His ideas were articulated in a series of articles published under the pseudonym '''Frank Talk'''.\n\n<!--Early life-->  \nRaised in a poor [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] family, Biko grew up in [[Ginsberg, Eastern Cape|Ginsberg township]] in the [[Eastern Cape]]. In 1966, he began studying medicine at the [[University of Natal]], where he joined the [[National Union of South African Students]] (NUSAS). Strongly opposed to the [[apartheid]] system of [[racial segregation]] and [[White South African|white-minority]] rule in South Africa, Biko was frustrated that NUSAS and other anti-apartheid groups were dominated by white [[liberalism|liberals]], rather than by the blacks who were most affected by apartheid. He believed that well-intentioned white liberals failed to comprehend the black experience and often acted in a [[paternalism|paternalistic]] manner. He developed the view that to avoid white domination, black people had to organise independently, and to this end he became a leading figure in the creation of the [[South African Students' Organisation]] (SASO) in 1968. Membership was open only to \"[[Black people|blacks]]\", a term that Biko used in reference not just to [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|Bantu-speaking Africans]] but also to [[Coloureds]] and [[Indian South Africans|Indians]]. He was careful to keep his movement independent of white liberals, but opposed anti-white racism and had white friends and lovers. The white-minority [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government were initially supportive, seeing SASO's creation as a victory for apartheid's ethos of racial separatism.\n\n<!--Later life-->  \nInfluenced by the [[Martinique|Martinican]] philosopher [[Frantz Fanon]] and the African-American [[Black Power movement]], Biko and his compatriots developed Black Consciousness as SASO's official ideology. The movement campaigned for an end to apartheid and the transition of South Africa toward [[universal suffrage]] and a [[Socialism|socialist economy]]. It organised Black Community Programmes (BCPs) and focused on the psychological empowerment of black people. Biko believed that black people needed to rid themselves of any sense of racial inferiority, an idea he expressed by popularizing the slogan \"[[black is beautiful]]\". In 1972, he was involved in founding the [[Black People's Convention]] (BPC) to promote Black Consciousness ideas among the wider population. The government came to see Biko as a subversive threat and placed him under a [[banning order]] in 1973, severely restricting his activities. He remained politically active, helping organise BCPs such as a healthcare centre and a cr\u00e8che in the Ginsberg area. During his ban he received repeated anonymous threats, and was detained by state security services on several occasions. Following his arrest in August 1977, Biko was beaten to death by state security officers. Over 20,000 people attended his funeral.\n\n<!--Reception and influence--> \nBiko's fame spread posthumously. He became the subject of numerous songs and works of art, while a 1978 biography by his friend [[Donald Woods]] formed the basis for the 1987 film ''[[Cry Freedom]]''. During Biko's life, the government alleged that he hated whites, various anti-apartheid activists accused him of [[sexism]], and African racial nationalists criticised his united front with Coloureds and Indians. Nonetheless, Biko became one of the earliest icons of the movement against apartheid, and is regarded as a political [[martyr (politics)|martyr]] and the \"Father of Black Consciousness\". His political legacy remains a matter of contention.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life: 1946\u20131966 ===\n\nBantu Stephen Biko was born on 18 December 1946,{{sfnm|1a1=Woods|1y=1978|1p=49|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2p=18|3a1=Hill|3y=2015|3p=xxi}} at his grandmother's house in [[Tarkastad]], [[Eastern Cape]].{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2012|1p=18|2a1=Hill|2y=2015|2p=xxi}} The third child of Mzingaye Mathew Biko and Alice 'Mamcete' Biko,{{sfnm|1a1=Smit|1y=1995|1p=18|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2p=18|3a1=Hill|3y=2015|3p=xxi}} he had an older sister, Bukelwa, an older brother, Khaya, and a younger sister, Nobandile.{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2012|1p=19|2a1=Mangcu|2y=2014|2p=89}} His parents had married in [[Whittlesea, Eastern Cape|Whittlesea]], where his father worked as a police officer. Mzingaye was transferred to [[Queenstown, Eastern Cape|Queenstown]], [[Port Elizabeth]], [[Fort Cox, Eastern Cape|Fort Cox]], and finally [[King William's Town]], where he and Alice settled in [[Ginsberg, Eastern Cape|Ginsberg township]].{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=19}} This was a settlement of around 800 families, with every four families sharing a water supply and toilet.{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=20}} Both [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|Bantu African]] and [[Coloureds|Coloured]] people lived in the [[township (South Africa)|township]],{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|p=235}} where [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], [[Afrikaans]], and English were all spoken.{{sfn|Wilson|2012|pp=20, 22}} After resigning from the police force, Mzingaye worked as a clerk in the King William's Town Native Affairs Office,{{sfnm|1a1=Smit|1y=1995|1p=18|2a1=Mangcu|2y=2014|2p=88}} while studying for a law degree by correspondence from the [[University of South Africa]].{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2012|1p=19|2a1=Mangcu|2y=2014|2p=88}} Alice was employed first in domestic work for local white households, then as a cook at [[Grey Hospital]] in King William's Town.{{sfnm|1a1=Smit|1y=1995|1p=18|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2p=20}} According to his sister, it was this observation of his mother's difficult working conditions that resulted in Biko's earliest politicisation.{{sfn|Cock|1989|p=3}}\n\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-214-41-Derivative-01.jpg|thumb|left|Biko was briefly educated at the Lovedale boarding school in Alice.|alt=A black and white photograph of a large mansion house, surrounded by various trees]]\n\nBiko's given name \"Bantu\" means \"people\"; Biko interpreted this in terms of the saying ''\"Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu\"'' (\"a person is a person by means of other people\").{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=18}} As a child he was nicknamed \"Goofy\" and \"Xwaku-Xwaku\", the latter a reference to his unkempt appearance.{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|p=32}} He was raised in his family's [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa|Anglican]] Christian faith.{{sfnm|1a1=Woods|1y=1978|1p=96|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2p=19}} In 1950, when Biko was four, his father fell ill, was hospitalised in [[St. Matthew's Hospital]], [[Keiskammahoek]], and died,{{sfnm|1a1=Smit|1y=1995|1p=18|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2p=19|3a1=Mangcu|3y=2014|3p=88}} making the family dependent on his mother's income.{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=20}}\n\nBiko spent two years at St. Andrews Primary School and four at Charles Morgan Higher Primary School, both in Ginsberg.{{sfnm|1a1=Woods|1y=1978|1p=49|2a1=Smit|2y=1995|2p=18|3a1=Mangcu|3y=2014|3pp=97\u201398}} Regarded as a particularly intelligent pupil, he was allowed to [[grade skipping|skip a year]].{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|p=98}} In 1963 he transferred to the Forbes Grant Secondary School in the township.{{sfnm|1a1=Smit|1y=1995|1p=18|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2p=22|3a1=Mangcu|3y=2014|3pp=100\u2013101}} Biko excelled at maths and English and topped the class in his exams.{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|p=102}} In 1964 the Ginsberg community offered him a bursary to join his brother Khaya as a student at [[Lovedale (South Africa)|Lovedale]], a prestigious [[boarding school]] in [[Alice, Eastern Cape]].{{sfnm|1a1=Wilson|1y=2012|1p=23|2a1=Mangcu|2y=2014|2pp=104\u2013105}} Within three months of Steve's arrival, Khaya was accused of having connections to [[Poqo]], the armed wing of the [[Pan Africanist Congress of Azania|Pan Africanist Congress]] (PAC), an [[African nationalism|African nationalist]] group which the government had banned. Both Khaya and Steve were arrested and interrogated by the police; the former was convicted, then acquitted on appeal.{{sfnm|1a1=Smit|1y=1995|1p=18|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2pp=23, 27|3a1=Mangcu|3y=2014|3p=106|4a1=Hill|4y=2015|4p=xxi}} No clear evidence of Steve's connection to Poqo was presented, but he was expelled from Lovedale.{{sfnm|1a1=Smit|1y=1995|1p=18|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2p=23|3a1=Mangcu|3y=2014|3p=107}} Commenting later on this situation, he stated: \"I began to develop an attitude which was much more directed at authority than at anything else. I hated authority like hell.\"{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=23}}\n\nFrom 1964 to 1965, Biko studied at St. Francis College, a [[Catholic Church in South Africa|Catholic]] boarding school in [[Mariannhill]], [[Natal Province|Natal]].{{sfnm|1a1=Woods|1y=1978|1p=49|2a1=Smit|2y=1995|2p=18|3a1=Wilson|3y=2012|3pp=24, 27|4a1=Mangcu|4y=2014|4p=108}} The college had a [[liberalism|liberal]] political culture, and Biko developed his political consciousness there.{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|pp=109\u2013110}} He became particularly interested in the replacement of South Africa's [[dominant minority|white minority]] [[South Africa#Republic|colonial government]] with an administration that represented the country's black majority.{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=25}} Among the [[anti-colonialism|anti-colonialist]] leaders who became Biko's heroes at this time were Algeria's [[Ahmed Ben Bella]] and Kenya's [[Jaramogi Oginga Odinga]].{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=25}} He later said that most of the \"politicos\" in his family were sympathetic to the PAC, which had [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] and African racialist ideas. Biko admired what he described as the PAC's \"terribly good organisation\" and the courage of many of its members, but he remained unconvinced by its racially exclusionary approach, believing that members of all racial groups should unite against the government.{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=27}} In December 1964, he travelled to [[Zwelitsha]] for the [[ulwaluko]] [[circumcision]] ceremony, symbolically marking his transition from boyhood to manhood.{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\n===Early student activism: 1966\u20131968===\n\n[[File:ApartheidSignEnglishAfrikaans.jpg|thumb|right|The apartheid system of racial segregation pervaded all areas of life; Biko was committed to its overthrow.|alt=A rectangular yellow wall plaque. It contains a message written in black in both English and Afrikaans. In English, the message reads: \"For Use by White Persons. These public premises and the amenities thereof have been reserved for the exclusive use of white persons.

Instead they convinced him to choose medicine, a subject thought to have better career prospects.{{sfnm|1a1=Smit|1y=1995|1p=18|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2p=28}} He secured a scholarship,{{sfnm|1a1=Smit|1y=1995|1p=18|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2p=28}} and in 1966 entered the \"non-European\" section of the [[University of Natal]] Medical School in [[Wentworth, KwaZulu-Natal|Wentworth]], a township of [[Durban]].{{sfnm|1a1=Smit|1y=1995|1p=18|2a1=Woods|2y=1978|2p=49|3a1=Wilson|3y=2012|3pp=28\u201329|4a1=Mangcu|4y=2014|4p=113}} There, he joined what his biographer Xolela Mangcu called \"a peculiarly sophisticated and cosmopolitan group of students\" from across South Africa;{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|p=115}} many of them later held prominent roles in the post-apartheid era.{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|p=116}} The late 1960s was the heyday of radical student politics across the world, as reflected in the [[protests of 1968]],{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|p=150}} and Biko was eager to involve himself in this environment.{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=30}} Soon after he arrived at the university, he was elected to the Students' Representative Council (SRC).{{sfnm|1a1=Smit|1y=1995|1p=18|2a1=Mangcu|2y=2014|2p=117}}\n\nThe university's SRC was affiliated with the [[National Union of South African Students]] (NUSAS).{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|p=117}} NUSAS had taken pains to cultivate a multi-racial membership but remained white-dominated because the majority of South Africa's students were from the country's white minority.{{sfn|Woods|1978|p=31}} As Clive Nettleton, a white NUSAS leader, put it: \"the essence of the matter is that NUSAS was founded on white initiative, is financed by white money and reflects the opinions of the majority of its members who are white\".{{sfn|Woods|1978|p=32}} NUSAS officially opposed apartheid, but it moderated its opposition in order to maintain the support of conservative white students.{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|p=126}} Biko and several other black African NUSAS members were frustrated when it organised parties in white dormitories, which black Africans were forbidden to enter.{{sfn|Woods|1978|p=117}} In July 1967, a NUSAS conference was held at [[Rhodes University]] in [[Grahamstown]]; after the students arrived, they found that dormitory accommodation had been arranged for the white and [[Indian South Africans|Indian]] delegates but not the black Africans, who were told that they could sleep in a local church. Biko and other black African delegates walked out of the conference in anger.{{sfnm|1a1=Woods|1y=1978|1p=117|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2pp=30\u201331|3a1=Mangcu|3y=2014|3pp=123\u2013125}} Biko later related that this event forced him to rethink his belief in the multi-racial approach to political activism:{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=31}}\n\n<blockquote>I realized that for a long time I had been holding onto this whole dogma of nonracism almost like a religion&nbsp;... But in the course of that debate I began to feel there was a lot lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea&nbsp;... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.{{sfn|Woods|1978|pp=153\u2013154}}</blockquote>\n\n===Founding the South African Students' Organisation: 1968\u20131972===\n\n====Developing SASO====\n\nFollowing the 1968 NUSAS conference in [[Johannesburg]], many of its members attended a July 1968 conference of the [[World Student Christian Federation|University Christian Movement]] at [[Stutterheim]]. There, the black African members decided to hold a December conference to discuss the formation of an independent black student group.{{sfnm|1a1=Woods|1y=1978|1pp=118\u2013119|2a1=Mangcu|2y=2014|2pp=157\u2013159}} The [[South African Students' Organisation]] (SASO) was officially launched at a July 1969 conference at the [[University of Limpopo|University of the North]]; there, the group's constitution and basic policy platform were adopted.{{sfnm|1a1=Woods|1y=1978|1p=119|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2p=36|3a1=Macqueen|3y=2013|3p=367|4a1=Mangcu|4y=2014|4p=169}} The group's focus was on the need for contact between centres of black student activity, including through sport, cultural activities, and debating competitions.{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|pp=169, 170}} Though Biko played a substantial role in SASO's creation, he sought a low public profile during its early stages, believing that this would strengthen its second level of leadership, such as his ally [[Barney Pityana]].{{sfn|Woods|1978|p=33}} Nonetheless, he was elected as SASO's first president; [[Pat Matshaka]] was elected vice president and [[Wuila Mashalaba]] elected secretary.{{sfnm|1a1=Woods|1y=1978|1pp=36, 120|2a1=Mangcu|2y=2014|2p=169}} Durban became its ''de facto'' headquarters.{{sfn|Macqueen|2014|p=512}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Like Black Power in the United States, South Africa's \"Black Consciousness movement\" was grounded in the belief that African-descendant peoples had to overcome the enormous psychological and cultural damage imposed on them by a succession of white racist domains, such as enslavement and colonialism. Drawing upon the writings and speeches of Frantz Fanon, Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, and Malcolm X, advocates of Black Consciousness supported cultural and social activities that promoted a knowledge of black protest history.

The basic tenet of Black Consciousness is that the Blackman must reject all value systems that seek to make him a foreigner in the country of his birth and reduce his basic human dignity.\"{{sfn|Denis|2010|p=166}} Black Consciousness centred on psychological empowerment,{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|p=272}} through combating the feelings of inferiority that most black South Africans exhibited.{{sfn|Ahluwalia|Zegeye|2001|p=460}} Biko believed that, as part of the struggle against apartheid and white-minority rule, blacks should affirm their own humanity by regarding themselves as worthy of freedom and its attendant responsibilities.{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|p=278}} It applied the term \"[[black people|black]]\" not only to Bantu-speaking Africans, but also to Indians and Coloureds.{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|pp=43\u201344}} SASO adopted this term over \"non-white\" because its leadership felt that defining themselves in opposition to white people was not a positive self-description.{{sfn|Woods|1978|p=121}} Biko promoted the slogan \"[[black is beautiful]]\", explaining that this meant \"Man, you are okay as you are.

name, dates, reasons for notability-->  \n'''Bantu Stephen Biko''' (18 December 1946&nbsp;\u2013 12 September 1977) was a South African [[internal resistance to apartheid|anti-apartheid]] activist. Ideologically an [[African nationalism|African nationalist]] and [[African socialism|African socialist]], he was at the forefront of a grassroots anti-apartheid campaign known as the [[Black Consciousness Movement]] during the late 1960s and 1970s. His ideas were articulated in a series of articles published under the pseudonym '''Frank Talk'''.\n\n<!--Early life-->  \nRaised in a poor [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] family, Biko grew up in [[Ginsberg, Eastern Cape|Ginsberg township]] in the [[Eastern Cape]]. In 1966, he began studying medicine at the [[University of Natal]], where he joined the [[National Union of South African Students]] (NUSAS). Strongly opposed to the [[apartheid]] system of [[racial segregation]] and [[White South African|white-minority]] rule in South Africa, Biko was frustrated that NUSAS and other anti-apartheid groups were dominated by white [[liberalism|liberals]], rather than by the blacks who were most affected by apartheid. He believed that well-intentioned white liberals failed to comprehend the black experience and often acted in a [[paternalism|paternalistic]] manner. He developed the view that to avoid white domination, black people had to organise independently, and to this end he became a leading figure in the creation of the [[South African Students' Organisation]] (SASO) in 1968. Membership was open only to \"[[Black people|blacks]]\", a term that Biko used in reference not just to [[Bantu peoples in South Africa|Bantu-speaking Africans]] but also to [[Coloureds]] and [[Indian South Africans|Indians]]. He was careful to keep his movement independent of white liberals, but opposed anti-white racism and had white friends and lovers. The white-minority [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government were initially supportive, seeing SASO's creation as a victory for apartheid's ethos of racial separatism.\n\n<!--Later life-->  \nInfluenced by the [[Martinique|Martinican]] philosopher [[Frantz Fanon]] and the African-American [[Black Power movement]], Biko and his compatriots developed Black Consciousness as SASO's official ideology. The movement campaigned for an end to apartheid and the transition of South Africa toward [[universal suffrage]] and a [[Socialism|socialist economy]]. It organised Black Community Programmes (BCPs) and focused on the psychological empowerment of black people. Biko believed that black people needed to rid themselves of any sense of racial inferiority, an idea he expressed by popularizing the slogan \"[[black is beautiful]]\". In 1972, he was involved in founding the [[Black People's Convention]] (BPC) to promote Black Consciousness ideas among the wider population. The government came to see Biko as a subversive threat and placed him under a [[banning order]] in 1973, severely restricting his activities. He remained politically active, helping organise BCPs such as a healthcare centre and a cr\u00e8che in the Ginsberg area. During his ban he received repeated anonymous threats, and was detained by state security services on several occasions. Following his arrest in August 1977, Biko was beaten to death by state security officers. Over 20,000 people attended his funeral.\n\n<!--Reception and influence--> \nBiko's fame spread posthumously. He became the subject of numerous songs and works of art, while a 1978 biography by his friend [[Donald Woods]] formed the basis for the 1987 film ''[[Cry Freedom]]''. During Biko's life, the government alleged that he hated whites, various anti-apartheid activists accused him of [[sexism]], and African racial nationalists criticised his united front with Coloureds and Indians. Nonetheless, Biko became one of the earliest icons of the movement against apartheid, and is regarded as a political [[martyr (politics)|martyr]] and the \"Father of Black Consciousness\".

Biko admired what he described as the PAC's \"terribly good organisation\" and the courage of many of its members, but he remained unconvinced by its racially exclusionary approach, believing that members of all racial groups should unite against the government.{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=27}} In December 1964, he travelled to [[Zwelitsha]] for the [[ulwaluko]] [[circumcision]] ceremony, symbolically marking his transition from boyhood to manhood.{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\n===Early student activism: 1966\u20131968===\n\n[[File:ApartheidSignEnglishAfrikaans.jpg|thumb|right|The apartheid system of racial segregation pervaded all areas of life; Biko was committed to its overthrow.|alt=A rectangular yellow wall plaque.

Biko and other black African delegates walked out of the conference in anger.{{sfnm|1a1=Woods|1y=1978|1p=117|2a1=Wilson|2y=2012|2pp=30\u201331|3a1=Mangcu|3y=2014|3pp=123\u2013125}} Biko later related that this event forced him to rethink his belief in the multi-racial approach to political activism:{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=31}}\n\n<blockquote>I realized that for a long time I had been holding onto this whole dogma of nonracism almost like a religion&nbsp;... But in the course of that debate I began to feel there was a lot lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea&nbsp;... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.{{sfn|Woods|1978|pp=153\u2013154}}</blockquote>\n\n===Founding the South African Students' Organisation: 1968\u20131972===\n\n====Developing SASO====\n\nFollowing the 1968 NUSAS conference in [[Johannesburg]], many of its members attended a July 1968 conference of the [[World Student Christian Federation|University Christian Movement]] at [[Stutterheim]].

He nevertheless thought that white South Africans were poorly suited to this role because they had not personally experienced the oppression that their black counterparts faced.{{sfn|Kamola|2015|p=64}}\n\nBiko and his comrades regarded multi-racial anti-apartheid groups as unwittingly replicating the structure of apartheid because they contained whites in dominant positions of control.{{sfn|Kamola|2015|p=66}} For this reason, Biko and the others did not participate in these multi-racial organisations.{{sfn|Ahluwalia|Zegeye|2001|p=460}} Instead, they called for an anti-apartheid programme that was controlled by black people.{{sfn|Ahluwalia|Zegeye|2001|p=460}} Although he called on sympathetic whites to reject any concept that they themselves could be spokespeople for the black majority, Biko nevertheless believed that they had a place in the anti-apartheid struggle, asking them to focus their efforts on convincing the wider white community on the inevitability of apartheid's fall.{{sfn|Kamola|2015|p=65}} Biko clarified his position to Woods: \"I don't reject liberalism as such or white liberals as such. I reject only the concept that black liberation can be achieved through the leadership of white liberals.\"{{sfn|Woods|1978|p=54}} He added that \"the [white] liberal is no enemy, he's a friend&nbsp;\u2013 but for the moment he holds us back, offering a formula too gentle, too inadequate for our struggle\".{{sfn|Woods|1978|p=55}}\n\nBiko's approach to activism focused on psychological empowerment,{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|p=272}} and both he and the BCM saw their main purpose as combating the feeling of inferiority that most black South Africans experienced.{{sfn|Ahluwalia|Zegeye|2001|p=460}} Biko expressed dismay at how \"the black man has become a shell, a shadow of man&nbsp;... bearing the yoke of oppression with sheepish timidity\",{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=14}} and stated that \"the most potent weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed\".{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=14}} He believed that blacks needed to affirm their own humanity by overcoming their fears and believing themselves worthy of freedom and its attendant responsibilities.{{sfn|Mangcu|2014|p=278}} He defined Black Consciousness as \"an inward-looking process\" that would \"infuse people with pride and dignity\".{{sfn|Wilson|2012|p=14}} To promote this, the BCM adopted the slogan \"Black is Beautiful\".{{sfn|Hill|2015|p=xviii}}\n\nOne of the ways that Biko and the BCM sought to achieve psychological empowerment was through community development.{{sfn|Hadfield|2010|p=80}} Community projects were seen not only as a way to alleviate poverty in black communities but also as a means of transforming society psychologically, culturally, and economically.{{sfn|Hadfield|2010|p=81}} They would also help students to learn about the \"daily struggles\" of ordinary black people and to spread Black Consciousness ideas among the population.{{sfn|Hadfield|2010|p=81}} Among the projects that SASO set its members to conduct in the holidays were repairs to schools, house-building, and instructions on financial management and agricultural techniques.{{sfn|Hadfield|2010|p=82}} Healthcare was also a priority, with SASO members focusing on primary and preventative care.{{sfn|Hadfield|2010|p=83}}\n\n===Foreign and domestic relations===\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = It becomes more necessary to see the truth as it is if you realise that the only vehicle for change are these people who have lost their personality.

In 2002, AZAPO issued a statement declaring that \"Biko was not a neutral, apolitical and mythical icon\" and that the ANC was \"scandalously\" using Biko's image to legitimise their \"weak\" government.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2253092.stm|title=Row clouds Biko anniversary|date=12 September 2002|work=BBC News|accessdate=18 December 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019160545/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2253092.stm|archivedate=19 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Members of the ANC have also criticised AZAPO's attitude to Biko; in 1997, Mandela said that \"Biko belongs to us all, not just AZAPO.\"{{sfn|Hill|2015|p=244}} On the anniversary of Biko's death in 2015, delegations from both the ANC and the [[Economic Freedom Fighters]] independently visited his grave.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://city-press.news24.com/News/Bikos-grave-a-political-battleground-for-parties-20150912|title=Biko's grave a political battleground for parties|last=Ngcukana|first=Lubabalo|date=13 September 2016|website=City Press|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108110928/http://city-press.news24.com/News/Bikos-grave-a-political-battleground-for-parties-20150912|archivedate=8 January 2016|access-date=4 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In March 2017, the South African President [[Jacob Zuma]] laid a wreath at Biko's grave to mark [[Human Rights Day]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ewn.co.za/2017/03/21/zuma-lays-wreath-at-steve-biko-memorial-grave-site|title=Zuma Commemorates Biko on Human Rights Day|last=Ngcobo|first=Ziyanda|date=21 March 2017|website=Eyewitness News|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321121416/http://ewn.co.za/2017/03/21/zuma-lays-wreath-at-steve-biko-memorial-grave-site|archivedate=21 March 2017|access-date=4 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Commemoration===\n[[File:StevenBantuBiko'sGrave.jpg|thumb|upright|Biko's grave in [[Ginsberg, Eastern Cape|Ginsberg]] cemetery, King William's Town|alt=A grave and headstone.

In the course of its evolution RHDV split into six distinct genotypes,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kerr |first1=P. J. |last2=Kitchen |first2=A. |last3=Holmes |first3=E. C. |title=Origin and Phylodynamics of Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus |journal=Journal of Virology |date=16 September 2009 |volume=83 |issue=23 |pages=12129\u201312138 |doi=10.1128/JVI.01523-09|doi-access=free }}</ref> all of which are highly pathogenic. In addition, non-pathogenic rabbit caliciviruses related to but distinct from RHDV have been identified in Europe and Australia.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Capucci |first1=L. |last2=Fusi |first2=P. |last3=Lavazza |first3=A. |last4=Pacciarini |first4=M.L. |last5=Rossi |first5=C. |title=Detection and preliminary characterization of a new rabbit calicivirus related to rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus but nonpathogenic |journal=Journal of Virology |date=December 1996 |volume=70 |issue=12 |pages=8614-8623}}</ref> Rabbit lagoviruses also include related caliciviruses such as European brown hare syndrome virus.<ref name=Gleeson2020>{{cite journal |last1=Gleeson |first1=Molly |last2=Petritz |first2=Olivia A. |title=Emerging Infectious Diseases of Rabbits |journal=Veterinary Clinics of North America: Exotic Animal Practice |date=May 2020 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=249\u2013261 |doi=10.1016/j.cvex.2020.01.008}}</ref>\n\nThe two strains of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus currently of medical significance are RHDVa and RHDV-2. RHDVa (also referred to as RHDV, RHDV1, or as classical RHD) only affects adult European rabbits (''Oryctolagus cuniculus''). This virus was first reported in China in 1984,<ref name=Liu1984>{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=S.J. |last2=Xue |first2=H.P. |last3=Pu |first3=B.Q. |last4=Qian |first4=N.H. |title=A new viral disease in rabbits |journal=Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine (Xumu yu Shouyi) |date=1984 |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=253-255}}</ref> from which it spread to much of Asia, Europe, Australia, and elsewhere. There have been a few isolated outbreaks of RHDVa in the United States and Mexico, but they remained localized and were eradicated.\n\nIn 2010, a new lagovirus with a distinct antigenic profile was identified in France. This virus also caused rabbit hemorrhagic disease but behaved differently from RHDVa in that it affected vaccinated and young European rabbits as well as hares ''(Lepus spp.)''.<ref name=Capucci2017 /> All these features strongly suggested that the virus was not derived from RHDVa but from some other unknown source.<ref name=Capucci2017 />  The new virus was named rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (abbreviated as RHDV-2 or RHDVb). RHDV-2 is distinct enough from RHDVa that the two require different vaccines, which are only partially cross protective. RHDV-2 has since spread to the majority of Europe as well as to Australia, Canada, and the United States.\n\n==Epidemiology & Transmission==\n\nBoth viruses causing RHD are extremely contagious. Transmission occurs by direct contact with infected animals, carcasses, bodily fluids (urine, feces, respiratory secretions), and hair.  Surviving rabbits may be contagious for up to 2 months.<ref name=Gleeson2020 />  Contaminated fomites such as clothing, food, cages, bedding, feeders and water also spread the virus. Flies, fleas, and mosquitoes can carry the virus between rabbits.<ref name=IAS/> Caliciviruses are highly resistant in the environment, and can survive freezing for prolonged periods. Virus can persist in infected meat for months, and for prolonged periods in decomposing carcasses. Importation of rabbit meat may be a major contributor in the spread of the virus to new geographic regions.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> \n\nClimate appears to play a role in the transmission of RHD. Most outbreaks of RHD occur in winter or spring, and higher temperatures in late spring and summer considerably reduce the spread of the virus. RHD is also more prevalent in dry and semi-dry areas than in areas that are relatively cool and humid.<ref name=strive/>\n\nThere is generally high host specificity among lagoviruses.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> Classic RHDVa only affects European rabbits, a species native to Europe and from which the domestic rabbit is descended. The new variant RHDV-2 affects European rabbits as well but also causes fatal RHD in various ''Lepus'' species, including Sardinian Cape hares ''(Lepus capensis mediterraneus)'', Italian hares ''(Lepus corsicanus)'' and mountain hares ''(Lepus timidus)''.\n<ref name=Rocchi2018 /> Reports of RHD in ''Sylvilagus'' species have been coming from the current outbreak in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |title=Southwest US faces lethal rabbit disease outbreak |url=https://news.vin.com/default.aspx?pid=210&Id=9597414 |website=Veterinary Information Network |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nRHD caused by classic RHDVa demonstrates high morbidity (up to 100%) and mortality (70-90%) in adult European rabbits. Young rabbits that are 6-8 weeks old are less likely to be infected, and kits younger than 4 weeks old do not become ill.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> The more recently emerged RHDV-2 causes death and disease in rabbits as young as 15 to 20 days old. Mortality rates from RHDV-2 were initially only 20-30%, but over time the virulence of the strain has been increasing and is now similar to that found with RHDVa. Deaths from RHDV-2 have been confirmed in rabbits previously vaccinated against RHDVa.<ref name=Gleeson2020 />\n\n== Clinical Signs ==\nRHD primarily infects only adult rabbits. In fact, research has shown that rabbits younger than 8 weeks of age are resistant to the virus. The incubation period for the RHD virus is between 1 and 3 days, with death following 1 to 2 days after the infection. There is a wide range of RHD symptoms. Most rabbits will show no signs of external symptoms of RHD.\n\nSymptomatic cases of RHD will display fever, squeals, and often coma leading to death within 12 to 36 hours. In less severe cases, rabbits may display uneasiness, excitement, [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], swollen eyelids, [[paralysis]], ocular [[haemorrhage]]s, and \"paddling\" or loss of skin. Convulsions may be seen as well. A fatal bloody discharge from the nose has been exhibited along with blood-stained cage floors, though these symptoms may have occurred after death. Rabbits who have recovered from the less severe symptoms usually develop severe [[jaundice]] with weight loss and [[lethargy]]. Diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal cramping are then exhibited right before death a few weeks later.<ref>?</ref>\n\nRHD causes rapid development of [[blood clot]] formation in major organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. The clots block blood vessels causing heart and respiratory failure. An infected rabbit that has died from RHD will often have its legs straight out and head over its neck.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nRHD may be indicated when several animals in the herd die after experiencing a fever and lethargy. [[Differential diagnosis]] includes [[pasteurellosis]], [[myxomatosis]], poisoning, heat exhaustion, and ''[[E. coli]]'' or ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' type E [[enterotoxemia]].\n\nRabbits that die from RHD are usually in good outward state. However, the most frequent post-mortem lesions are [[necrosis]] of the [[liver]], and [[splenomegaly]]. The liver of RHD rabbits may have a fine reticular pattern of necrosis outline each lobule and maybe yellow, gray or pale in colour. The liver is also usually [[friable]] and swollen. The spleen will be black in colour and also swollen with rounded edges, while the kidneys are dark brown in colour. [[Haemorrhages]] will also be seen many other organs and tissues. The trachea may present a foamy, bloody mucous. [[Enteritis]] of the small intestine and swollen [[meninges]] may also occur.\n\nLaboratory tests such as [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR), [[Western blotting]], negative-staining immunoelectron microscopy, and [[ELISA]]s may be performed on samples from the liver, blood, spleen or other organs.\n\n== Morbidity, mortality, and immunity ==\nRHD is extremely hard to locate in the wild since about 75% of rabbits with RHD will die in their burrows underground. Due to this difficulty, the [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] estimates for RHD have a broad range. The morbidity rate ranges from 30% to 100% and the mortality rate from 40% to 100%; however, the typical mortality rate is usually around 90%.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nMaternal antibodies such as [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG), which are readily transmitted to the young across the placenta, may explain why very young rabbits are resistant to RHD. Some scientists also believe that the immature immune system of a young rabbit cannot produce the number of chemicals needed to initiate clotting in order to kill. Rabbits may develop immunity against other strains of the RHD virus, while others may endure persistent infections. The immunity does not survive through the next generation, leaving open the possibility of further outbreaks in the population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=Raquel M|last2=Teixeira|first2=Luzia|last3=\u00c1guas|first3=Artur P|last4=Ribeiro|first4=Joana C|last5=Costa-e-Silva|first5=Ant\u00f3nio|last6=Ferreira|first6=Paula G|title=Immunosuppression abrogates resistance of young rabbits to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD)|journal=Veterinary Research|date=4 February 2014|volume=45|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-45-14|pmc=3926702|pmid=24490832|pages=14}}</ref>\n\n== Prevention & Control ==\nCountries that are uninfected by RHD may place restrictions on importation from endemic countries. According to the [[Merck & Co.|Merck]]/[[Merial]] Manual For Pet Health, Home Edition, 2007, RHD is a reportable disease in the United States. If a diagnosis is made by a veterinarian, a notification to the \"appropriate government authorities\" must be made.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nBecause of the highly infectious nature of the disease, strict quarantine is necessary when outbreaks occur. Depopulation, disinfection, surveillance and quarantines are the only way to properly and effectively eradicate the disease. Good disinfectants include 10% [[sodium hydroxide]], 1-2% [[formalin]], 2% One-Stroke Environ, and 10% household [[bleach]]. The RHD virus is resistant to [[ethers]] and [[chloroform]]. Deceased rabbits must be removed immediately and discarded in a safe manner. Surviving rabbits are quarantined or humanely euthanized.

By the late 1990s, RHDVa stretched to forty countries and had become [[endemic]] in [[Wild animal|wild]] and [[feral]] rabbit populations in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and [[Cuba]].<ref name=IAS/> In Europe, there was a rapid increase in research into RHD, due to the importance of the commercial breeding of rabbits for meat and fur production.\n\nThe first reported case of RHDVa in the United States was in Iowa on March 9, 2000. The affected breeds included [[List of rabbit breeds|Palominos]] and [[Californian rabbit|California Whites]]. By April 6, 25 of the 27 affected rabbits had died of the infection. In order to contain the disease, the remaining two rabbits were euthanized. No new introductions of rabbits were placed on the farm for two years after the discovery of RHDVa and August 1999 was the last time rabbits left and/or returned to the farm. The United States experienced other outbreaks of RHDVa in 2001 ([[Utah]], [[Illinois]], [[New York (state)|New York]]) and 2005 ([[Indiana]]).<ref name=IAS/>\n\nIn 2010, a new virus variant called rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV-2) emerged in France.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Le Gall-Recul\u00e9|first=Ghislaine|last2=Lavazza|first2=Antonio|last3=Marchandeau|first3=St\u00e9phane|last4=Bertagnoli|first4=St\u00e9phane|last5=Zwingelstein|first5=Fran\u00e7oise|last6=Cavadini|first6=Patrizia|last7=Martinelli|first7=Nicola|last8=Lombardi|first8=Guerino|last9=Gu\u00e9rin|first9=Jean-Luc|date=2013-09-08|title=Emergence of a new lagovirus related to rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus|journal=Veterinary Research|language=En|volume=44|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-44-81|pmc=3848706|pmid=24011218|pages=81}}</ref> RHDV-2 has since spread from France to the rest of Europe, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand.

However, in late August it was confirmed that RHDVa had been deliberately and illegally introduced to the [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]] area of the [[South Island]]. An unsuccessful attempt was made by New Zealand officials to control the spread of the disease. It was, however, being intentionally spread, and several farmers (notably in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] area) admitted to processing rabbits that had died from the disease in kitchen blenders for further spreading.\n\nHad the disease been introduced at a better time, there would have been a more effective control of the population. However, it was released after breeding had commenced for the season, and rabbits under 2 weeks old at the time of the introduction were resistant to the disease.

RHDVa (also referred to as RHDV, RHDV1, or as classical RHD) only affects adult European rabbits (''Oryctolagus cuniculus''). This virus was first reported in China in 1984,<ref name=Liu1984>{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=S.J. |last2=Xue |first2=H.P. |last3=Pu |first3=B.Q. |last4=Qian |first4=N.H. |title=A new viral disease in rabbits |journal=Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine (Xumu yu Shouyi) |date=1984 |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=253-255}}</ref> from which it spread to much of Asia, Europe, Australia, and elsewhere. There have been a few isolated outbreaks of RHDVa in the United States and Mexico, but they remained localized and were eradicated.\n\nIn 2010, a new lagovirus with a distinct antigenic profile was identified in France. This virus also caused rabbit hemorrhagic disease but behaved differently from RHDVa in that it affected vaccinated and young European rabbits as well as hares ''(Lepus spp.)''.<ref name=Capucci2017 /> All these features strongly suggested that the virus was not derived from RHDVa but from some other unknown source.<ref name=Capucci2017 />  The new virus was named rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (abbreviated as RHDV-2 or RHDVb). RHDV-2 is distinct enough from RHDVa that the two require different vaccines, which are only partially cross protective. RHDV-2 has since spread to the majority of Europe as well as to Australia, Canada, and the United States.\n\n==Epidemiology & Transmission==\n\nBoth viruses causing RHD are extremely contagious. Transmission occurs by direct contact with infected animals, carcasses, bodily fluids (urine, feces, respiratory secretions), and hair.  Contaminated fomites such as clothing, food, cages, bedding, feeders and water also spread the virus. Flies, fleas, and mosquitoes can carry the virus between rabbits.<ref name=IAS/> Caliciviruses are highly resistant in the environment, and can survive freezing for prolonged periods. Virus can persist in infected meat for months, and for prolonged periods in decomposing carcasses. Importation of rabbit meat may be a major contributor in the spread of the virus to new geographic regions.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> \n\nClimate appears to play a role in the transmission of RHD. Most outbreaks of RHD occur in winter or spring, and higher temperatures in late spring and summer considerably reduce the spread of the virus. RHD is also more prevalent in dry and semi-dry areas than in areas that are relatively cool and humid.<ref name=strive/>\n\nThere is generally high host specificity among lagoviruses.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> Classic RHDVa only affects European rabbits, a species native to Europe and from which the domestic rabbit is descended. The new variant RHDV-2 affects European rabbits as well but also causes fatal RHD in various ''Lepus'' species, including Sardinian Cape hares ''(Lepus capensis mediterraneus)'', Italian hares ''(Lepus corsicanus)'' and mountain hares ''(Lepus timidus)''.\n<ref name=Rocchi2018 /> Reports of RHD in ''Sylvilagus'' species have been coming from the current outbreak in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |title=Southwest US faces lethal rabbit disease outbreak |url=https://news.vin.com/default.aspx?pid=210&Id=9597414 |website=Veterinary Information Network |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nRHD caused by classic RHDVa demonstrates high morbidity (up to 100%) and mortality (70-90%) in adult European rabbits. Young rabbits that are 6-8 weeks old are less likely to be infected, and kits younger than 4 weeks old do not become ill.<ref name=Gleeson2020 /> The more recently emerged RHDV-2 causes death and disease in rabbits as young as 15 to 20 days old. Mortality rates from RHDV-2 were initially only 20-30%, but over time the virulence of the strain has been increasing and is now similar to that found with RHDVa. Deaths from RHDV-2 have been confirmed in rabbits previously vaccinated against RHDVa.<ref name=Gleeson2020 />\n\n== Clinical Signs ==\nRHD primarily infects only adult rabbits. In fact, research has shown that rabbits younger than 8 weeks of age are resistant to the virus. The incubation period for the RHD virus is between 1 and 3 days, with death following 1 to 2 days after the infection. There is a wide range of RHD symptoms. Most rabbits will show no signs of external symptoms of RHD.\n\nSymptomatic cases of RHD will display fever, squeals, and often coma leading to death within 12 to 36 hours. In less severe cases, rabbits may display uneasiness, excitement, [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], swollen eyelids, [[paralysis]], ocular [[haemorrhage]]s, and \"paddling\" or loss of skin. Convulsions may be seen as well. A fatal bloody discharge from the nose has been exhibited along with blood-stained cage floors, though these symptoms may have occurred after death. Rabbits who have recovered from the less severe symptoms usually develop severe [[jaundice]] with weight loss and [[lethargy]]. Diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal cramping are then exhibited right before death a few weeks later.<ref>?</ref>\n\nRHD causes rapid development of [[blood clot]] formation in major organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. The clots block blood vessels causing heart and respiratory failure. An infected rabbit that has died from RHD will often have its legs straight out and head over its neck.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nRHD may be indicated when several animals in the herd die after experiencing a fever and lethargy. [[Differential diagnosis]] includes [[pasteurellosis]], [[myxomatosis]], poisoning, heat exhaustion, and ''[[E. coli]]'' or ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' type E [[enterotoxemia]].\n\nRabbits that die from RHD are usually in good outward state. However, the most frequent post-mortem lesions are [[necrosis]] of the [[liver]], and [[splenomegaly]]. The liver of RHD rabbits may have a fine reticular pattern of necrosis outline each lobule and maybe yellow, gray or pale in colour. The liver is also usually [[friable]] and swollen. The spleen will be black in colour and also swollen with rounded edges, while the kidneys are dark brown in colour. [[Haemorrhages]] will also be seen many other organs and tissues. The trachea may present a foamy, bloody mucous. [[Enteritis]] of the small intestine and swollen [[meninges]] may also occur.\n\nLaboratory tests such as [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR), [[Western blotting]], negative-staining immunoelectron microscopy, and [[ELISA]]s may be performed on samples from the liver, blood, spleen or other organs.\n\n== Morbidity, mortality, and immunity ==\nRHD is extremely hard to locate in the wild since about 75% of rabbits with RHD will die in their burrows underground. Due to this difficulty, the [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] estimates for RHD have a broad range. The morbidity rate ranges from 30% to 100% and the mortality rate from 40% to 100%; however, the typical mortality rate is usually around 90%.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nMaternal antibodies such as [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG), which are readily transmitted to the young across the placenta, may explain why very young rabbits are resistant to RHD. Some scientists also believe that the immature immune system of a young rabbit cannot produce the number of chemicals needed to initiate clotting in order to kill. Rabbits may develop immunity against other strains of the RHD virus, while others may endure persistent infections. The immunity does not survive through the next generation, leaving open the possibility of further outbreaks in the population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=Raquel M|last2=Teixeira|first2=Luzia|last3=\u00c1guas|first3=Artur P|last4=Ribeiro|first4=Joana C|last5=Costa-e-Silva|first5=Ant\u00f3nio|last6=Ferreira|first6=Paula G|title=Immunosuppression abrogates resistance of young rabbits to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD)|journal=Veterinary Research|date=4 February 2014|volume=45|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-45-14|pmc=3926702|pmid=24490832|pages=14}}</ref>\n\n== Prevention & Control ==\nCountries that are uninfected by RHD may place restrictions on importation from endemic countries. According to the [[Merck & Co.|Merck]]/[[Merial]] Manual For Pet Health, Home Edition, 2007, RHD is a reportable disease in the United States. If a diagnosis is made by a veterinarian, a notification to the \"appropriate government authorities\" must be made.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nBecause of the highly infectious nature of the disease, strict quarantine is necessary when outbreaks occur. Depopulation, disinfection, surveillance and quarantines are the only way to properly and effectively eradicate the disease. Good disinfectants include 10% [[sodium hydroxide]], 1-2% [[formalin]], 2% One-Stroke Environ, and 10% household [[bleach]]. The RHD virus is resistant to [[ethers]] and [[chloroform]]. Deceased rabbits must be removed immediately and discarded in a safe manner. Surviving rabbits are quarantined or humanely euthanized. Test rabbits may be used to monitor the virus on vaccinated farms.<ref name=\"IAS\" />\n\nThere are several vaccines available against VHD in the UK: Cylap, made by Fort Dodge Animal Health; Lapinject, made by CEVA Animal Health; Anivac, made by Animalcare Ltd and FILAVAC, made by Filavie. All last for 12 months and contain inactivated strains of VHD. A live combination vaccine, Nobivac Myxo-RHD, made by MSD Animal Health, has recently become available. Its active ingredient is a live myxoma-vectored RHD virus strain 009 and it offers a duration of immunity of 1 year against both RHD and [[myxomatosis]].<ref name=\"NOAH Compendium\">[http://www.noahcompendium.co.uk/Therapeutic_Indication/Therapeutic_Indication/-148.html Therapeutic Indication:  For rabbits] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526030329/http://www.noahcompendium.co.uk/Therapeutic_Indication/Therapeutic_Indication/-148.html |date=2013-05-26 }}, National Office of Animal Health rabbit vaccines.{{full citation needed|date=October 2015}}.</ref> FILAVAC has been authorised by the VMD in April 2017; it is currently the only vaccine containing both classic and variant strain of VHD virus.<ref>http://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/ProductInformationDatabase/SPC_Documents/SPC_1170567.DOC</ref>\n\n== History ==\nRabbit hemorrhagic disease caused by RHDVa first appeared in the Winter of 1983 in Jiangsu Province of the [[People's Republic of China]].

The virus has since appeared in Mexico, [[Cuba]], Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada.<ref name=Merck/> In 1992, the United Kingdom reported its first case of RHDVa in domestic show rabbits. By the late 1990s, RHDVa stretched to forty countries and had become [[endemic]] in [[Wild animal|wild]] and [[feral]] rabbit populations in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and [[Cuba]].<ref name=IAS/> In Europe, there was a rapid increase in research into RHD, due to the importance of the commercial breeding of rabbits for meat and fur production.\n\nThe first reported case of RHDVa in the United States was in Iowa on March 9, 2000. The affected breeds included [[List of rabbit breeds|Palominos]] and [[Californian rabbit|California Whites]]. By April 6, 25 of the 27 affected rabbits had died of the infection. In order to contain the disease, the remaining two rabbits were euthanized. No new introductions of rabbits were placed on the farm for two years after the discovery of RHDVa and August 1999 was the last time rabbits left and/or returned to the farm. The United States experienced other outbreaks of RHDVa in 2001 ([[Utah]], [[Illinois]], [[New York (state)|New York]]) and 2005 ([[Indiana]]).<ref name=IAS/>\n\nIn 2010, a new virus variant called rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV-2) emerged in France.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Le Gall-Recul\u00e9|first=Ghislaine|last2=Lavazza|first2=Antonio|last3=Marchandeau|first3=St\u00e9phane|last4=Bertagnoli|first4=St\u00e9phane|last5=Zwingelstein|first5=Fran\u00e7oise|last6=Cavadini|first6=Patrizia|last7=Martinelli|first7=Nicola|last8=Lombardi|first8=Guerino|last9=Gu\u00e9rin|first9=Jean-Luc|date=2013-09-08|title=Emergence of a new lagovirus related to rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus|journal=Veterinary Research|language=En|volume=44|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-44-81|pmc=3848706|pmid=24011218|pages=81}}</ref> RHDV-2 has since spread from France to the rest of Europe, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand.

However, in late August it was confirmed that RHDVa had been deliberately and illegally introduced to the [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]] area of the [[South Island]]. An unsuccessful attempt was made by New Zealand officials to control the spread of the disease. It was, however, being intentionally spread, and several farmers (notably in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] area) admitted to processing rabbits that had died from the disease in kitchen blenders for further spreading.\n\nHad the disease been introduced at a better time, there would have been a more effective control of the population. However, it was released after breeding had commenced for the season, and rabbits under 2 weeks old at the time of the introduction were resistant to the disease.
