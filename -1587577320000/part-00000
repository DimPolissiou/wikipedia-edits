Wembley was the first pitch to be referred to as \"Hallowed Turf\", with many stadia around the world borrowing this phrase. In 1934, the [[Wembley Arena|Empire Pool]] was built nearby. The \"Wembley Stadium Collection\" is held by the [[National Football Museum]]. The stadium closed in October 2000 and demolition commenced in December 2002, completing in 2003 for [[Wembley Stadium|redevelopment]]. The top of one of the twin towers was erected as a memorial in the park on the north side of Overton Close in the Saint Raphael's Estate.\n\n==Football==\nWembley is best known for hosting football matches, having hosted the [[FA Cup Final]] annually as well as numerous England International fixtures.\n\n===White Horse Final===\n{{main|1923 FA Cup Final}}\n[[File:Whitehorsefinal.jpg|thumb|left|''Billy'' the White Horse, saviour of the [[1923 FA Cup Final]]]]\nThe Empire Stadium was built in exactly 300 days at the cost of \u00a3750,000. Described as the world's greatest sporting arena, it was ready only four days before the \"White Horse\" Final in 1923. The FA had not considered admission by ticket, grossly underestimating the number of fans who arrived at the 104 gates on match day. However, after the match, every event, apart from the [[1982 FA Cup Final|1982]] replay,<ref>{{cite book |last= Collett |first= Mike |title= The Complete Record of The FA Cup |year= 2003 |isbn= 1-899807-19-5 |page=35}}</ref> was ticketed.\n\n[[File:White Horse Final1923.jpg|right|thumb|Crowds at the edges of the pitch]]\nThe first event held at the stadium was the [[FA Cup]] Final on 28 April 1923 between [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. This is known as the [[1923 FA Cup Final|White Horse Final]]. Such was the eagerness of fans and casual observers to attend the final at the new [[national stadium]] that vast numbers of people crammed through the 104 [[turnstile]]s into the stadium, far exceeding its official 127,000 capacity. The crowds overflowed onto the pitch as there was no room on the terraces. Estimates of the number of fans in attendance range from 240,000<ref>{{cite book | last=Bateson|first=Bill|author2=Albert Sewell  | title=News of the World Football Annual 1992/93| publisher=Harper Collins | year=1992| isbn=0-85543-188-1}}</ref> to well over 300,000.<ref>{{cite book |last= Matthews|first= Tony|title= Football Firsts|year= 2006|publisher= Capella|location= |isbn= 1-84193-451-8}}</ref> It is estimated that another 60,000 were locked outside the gates.

That was until mounted police, including Police Constable [[George Scorey]] and his white horse, ''Billy'', slowly pushed the crowds back to the sides of the field of play for the FA Cup Final to start, just 45 minutes late. In honour of Billy, the footbridge outside the new Wembley Stadium has been named the [[White Horse Bridge]]. The official attendance is often quoted as 126,047. The match was a 2\u20130 victory for Bolton Wanderers, with [[David Jack]] scoring the first ever goal at Wembley.\n\n===Matthews Final===\n{{main|1953 FA Cup Final}}\nThe [[1953 FA Cup Final]] between [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] and [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] was dubbed the \"Matthews Final\" after Blackpool's winger [[Stanley Matthews]].

It remained the only hat-trick ever scored in an FA Cup Final at the original Wembley.\n\nThe FA Cup final was played there in April or May until 2000 (excluding the 1970 replay when [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] beat [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] at [[Old Trafford]]). It was also the venue for finals of the [[FA Amateur Cup]], [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] (except for the early years when this was settled on a home and away basis) and in later years the [[Associate Members' Cup]] and the [[The Football League|Football League]] promotion [[Football League play-offs|play-off finals]] (in the early years of play-offs they were home and away fixtures).

Most early internationals (including [[England v Scotland (1870)|the first ever international football match]] (1870)) were played at [[The Oval]], which opened in 1845 as the home ground of [[Surrey County Cricket Club]] and would in 1880 host the first [[Test cricket|Test match]] played in England. For the first 27 years, the only International England games played at Wembley were fixtures against Scotland, with other games played elsewhere until 1951. The first team other than Scotland to face England at the venue was Argentina.<ref>[http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamWembley/History.html].</ref>\n\nIn 1956 and 1971, it was the venue of the home matches of the Great Britain national football team for the qualification matches to the [[Summer Olympic Games]] against [[Bulgaria at the Olympics|Bulgaria]].<ref>{{cite web | last =Barker | first =Philip | title =Wembley Stadium \u2013 An Olympic Chronology 1923\u20132003 | work =Journal of Olympic History | publisher = [[LA84 Foundation]] | date =June 2003 | url =http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv11n2/johv11n2i.pdf | format = [[Portable Document Format|PDF format]] | accessdate = 14 January 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, it was the leading venue of the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]]. It hosted nine matches, including the [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], where tournament hosts England won 4\u20132 after extra time against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]].\n\nSeven years later, Wembley was the venue for a specially arranged friendly between teams called \"The Three\" and \"The Six\" to celebrate the [[United Kingdom]] joining the [[European Union]]. The match finished 2\u20130 to \"The Three\".\n\nIn 1996, it was the principal venue of [[UEFA Euro 1996]], hosting all of England's matches, as well as the tournament's final, where Germany won the [[UEFA European Championship]] for a third time after defeating the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] 2\u20131 with the first international [[golden goal]] in football history. Germany had earlier defeated England on penalties in the semi-final after a 1\u20131 draw, with [[Gareth Southgate]] missing a penalty for England in the shoot-out.\n\nEngland's final two competitive matches played at the stadium resulted in 0\u20131 defeats for England to Scotland and Germany respectively. The first defeat was in the play off for the [[UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying|Euro 2000 qualifiers]] in November 1999, but England still went through as they won the other leg 2\u20130 at [[Hampden Park]]. However, the final match at Wembley was the opening [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifier]] for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], and defeat prompted the resignation of England manager [[Kevin Keegan]] at the end of the match after just 18 months in charge.\n\n===Club football===\n[[File:Bristol Rovers v Tranmere Rovers, Wembley 1990 (344523653).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] v [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] [[Football League Trophy|Leyland DAF Cup]] Final in [[1989\u201390 Football League Trophy|1990]]]]\nIn all, the stadium hosted five [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] finals.

The [[Wembley Lions (speedway)|Wembley Lions]] returned in 1946 and operated in the top flight until the end of the 1956 season winning a number of League titles. A short lived revival saw the Lions in the [[Speedway British League|British League]] in the [[1970 British League season|1970]] and [[1971 British League season|1971 season]]s. [[Lionel Van Praag]] ([[1936 Individual Speedway World Championship|1936]]), [[Tommy Price]] ([[1949 Individual Speedway World Championship|1949]]), and [[Freddie Williams (speedway rider)|Freddie Williams]]  ([[1950 Individual Speedway World Championship|1950]] and [[1953 Individual Speedway World Championship|1953]]), all won World Championships whilst riding for Wembley. The ashes for the speedway track were supplied by Richard Biffa Ltd who's operating base at the time was in Wembley Hill Road. Richard Biffa later became Biffa Waste Services. The Lions were formed by the Wembley Stadium chairman [[Arthur Elvin|Sir Arthur Elvin]].<ref name=\"wpwy\"/>\n\nBetween 1936 and 1960 Wembley hosted all of the first 15 finals of the [[Speedway World Championship]]. It hosted another nine World Finals before the last one at Wembley took place in [[1981 Individual Speedway World Championship|1981]] in front of 92,500 fans, just shy of the venue's record speedway attendance of 95,000 set at the [[1938 Individual Speedway World Championship|1938 World Final]].<ref>Bamford, R.; Jarvis J.(2001).

With four wins, Sweden's Ove Fundin won the most World Championships at Wembley, winning in [[1956 Individual Speedway World Championship|1956]], [[1960 Individual Speedway World Championship|1960]], [[1963 Individual Speedway World Championship|1963]] and [[1967 Individual Speedway World Championship|1967]].\n\nWembley also hosted the Final of the [[Speedway World Team Cup]] in [[1968 Speedway World Team Cup|1968]], [[1970 Speedway World Team Cup|1970]] and [[1973 Speedway World Team Cup|1973]] won by [[Great Britain national speedway team|Great Britain]] (1968 and 1973) and [[Sweden national speedway team|Sweden]] (1970).\n\nThe speedway track at Wembley Stadium was {{convert|345|m|yd|abbr=off}} in length and was notoriously difficult to ride for those not used to it. Despite regularly being used for World Championship and other British championship meetings, [[Wembley]] long had a reputation as a track that was difficult to pass on which often led to processional racing. Among those who never performed well there despite their credentials include [[1973 Individual Speedway World Championship|1973]] World Champion [[Jerzy Szczakiel]] (who won his title at home in Poland and two weeks later under difficult circumstances failed to score in the World Team Cup Final at Wembley), while others such as Ivan Mauger and Ole Olsen often seemed to find their best form at the stadium. The track itself was located inside of the greyhound racing track, but intersected the stadium's playing field at the corners. The pits were located in the tunnel at the eastern end of the stadium.\n\nThe track record at Wembley will forever be held by Denmark's World Champion of [[1984 Individual Speedway World Championship|1984]], [[1985 Individual Speedway World Championship|1985]] & [[1988 Individual Speedway World Championship|1988]] [[Erik Gundersen]]. In Heat 6 of the 1981 World Final, Gundersen set the 4-lap record (clutch start) of 66.8 seconds. As this was the last time the stadium was used for speedway racing, it remains the track record.\n\n===Stock car racing===\nTwo meetings were held at [[Wembley]] in 1974 promoted by [[Trevor Redmond]]. The first meeting held featured [[BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars]] and [[Hot Rods (oval racing)|National Hot Rods]]. The second meeting featured the [[BriSCA Formula 2 Stock Cars]] World Final with F1's in support. Before the first meeting the Wembley groundsman threatened to resign over possible damage to the hallowed turf. The pitch was surrounded by wooden beams and little damage was caused.<ref>BriSCA Formula One \u2013 The first 50 years 1954\u20132004 Keith Barber p&nbsp;178\u2013179</ref>\n\n===Rugby union===\nThough the venue was not traditionally a regular host of [[rugby union]] matches, England played a friendly against Canada on 17 October 1992, as their regular home stadium at [[Twickenham]] was undergoing redevelopment. [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] played their [[Rugby Union Six Nations Championship|Five Nations]] and autumn international home matches at [[Wembley]] (as [[Twickenham Stadium]] would not accommodate them) while [[Cardiff Arms Park]] was being rebuilt as the [[Millennium Stadium]] in the late 1990s (a deal reciprocated for FA Cups during the construction of the new Wembley Stadium).

In 1931 the famous greyhound [[Mick the Miller]] won the St Leger.\n\nWembley's owners' refusal to cancel the regular greyhound racing meant that the match between [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] and [[France national football team|France]] in the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] was played at [[White City Stadium|White City]].\n\n===American football===\nThe [[National Football League]] held nine preseason [[American football]] games at Wembley between 1983 and 1993. The [[Minnesota Vikings]] and the [[St. Louis Cardinals (NFL, 1960\u20131987)|St. Louis Cardinals]] played the first game on 6 August 1983. The [[Detroit Lions]] and the [[Dallas Cowboys]] played the last game on 8 August 1993. The [[United States Football League]] also played an exhibition game there on 21 July 1984 between the [[Baltimore Stars|Philadelphia Stars]] and [[Tampa Bay Bandits]]. The [[London Monarchs]] of the [[NFL Europa|World League of American Football]] played at the venue in 1991 and 1992. Wembley hosted [[World Bowl '91]] the inaugural [[World Bowl]] where the Monarchs defeated the [[Barcelona Dragons]] 21\u20130.\n\n===Gaelic football===\nFrom 1958 until the mid-1970s, [[hurling]] and [[gaelic football]] tournaments known as the \"Wembley Tournaments\" were held at Wembley Stadium to bring the Irish sports to expatriates in Britain at the time. Several Gaelic football games were played in Wembley Stadium, most of them exhibition matches, most notably [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] and [[Down GAA|Down]] in 1961.\n\n===Other events===\nThe stadium also staged women's field hockey matches in which England appeared in their annual match between 1951 and 1969 and then from 1971 to 1991.\n\nOn 18 June 1963, Wembley hosted a [[Muhammad Ali vs. Henry Cooper|heavyweight boxing match]] between London native boxer [[Henry Cooper]] and American rising star [[Muhammad Ali]] in front of 35,000 spectators.\n\nOn 26 May 1975, in front of 90,000 people, [[Evel Knievel]] crashed while trying to land a jump over 13 single decker city buses, an accident which resulted in his initial retirement from his daredevil&nbsp;life.<ref name=bevknvbs>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EtZVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_dcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6888%2C7018770 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon, U.S.) |agency=UPI |title=Battered Evel Knievel quitting stunt business |date=27 May 1975 |page=5A}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (now known as WWE) drew a sellout of 80,355 when [[SummerSlam (1992)|SummerSlam]] was hosted at Wembley Stadium.

Each concert had an attendance of 72,000 people. According to the [[Guinness Book of World Records]], Jackson set a new world record with 504,000 people attending the seven sold-out concerts. He was given a special award by Wembley Stadium Officials for achieving this milestone. The concert on 16 July 1988 was attended by [[Princess Diana]] and [[Prince Charles]]. The [[DVD]] of this concert ([[Michael Jackson: Live at Wembley July 16, 1988]]) was released on 18 September 2012 as part of the [[Bad 25|25th Anniversary reissue]] of his 1987 hit album [[Bad (album)|Bad]] and also as a stand-alone DVD.

However, after the match, every event, apart from the [[1982 FA Cup Final|1982]] replay,<ref>{{cite book |last= Collett |first= Mike |title= The Complete Record of The FA Cup |year= 2003 |isbn= 1-899807-19-5 |page=35}}</ref> was ticketed.\n\n[[File:White Horse Final1923.jpg|right|thumb|Crowds at the edges of the pitch]]\nThe first event held at the stadium was the [[FA Cup]] Final on 28 April 1923 between [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. This is known as the [[1923 FA Cup Final|White Horse Final]]. Such was the eagerness of fans and casual observers to attend the final at the new [[national stadium]] that vast numbers of people crammed through the 104 [[turnstile]]s into the stadium, far exceeding its official 127,000 capacity. The crowds overflowed onto the pitch as there was no room on the terraces. Estimates of the number of fans in attendance range from 240,000<ref>{{cite book | last=Bateson|first=Bill|author2=Albert Sewell  | title=News of the World Football Annual 1992/93| publisher=Harper Collins | year=1992| isbn=0-85543-188-1}}</ref> to well over 300,000.<ref>{{cite book |last= Matthews|first= Tony|title= Football Firsts|year= 2006|publisher= Capella|location= |isbn= 1-84193-451-8}}</ref> It is estimated that another 60,000 were locked outside the gates. The FA were forced to refund 10% of the total gate money to fans unable to reach the terraces.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe White Horse Final has the highest ever unofficial \"non-racing\" sports attendance in the world.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} It was thought that the match would not be played because of the volume of spectators inside the stadium that had spilled onto the pitch. That was until mounted police, including Police Constable [[George Scorey]] and his white horse, ''Billy'', slowly pushed the crowds back to the sides of the field of play for the FA Cup Final to start, just 45 minutes late. In honour of Billy, the footbridge outside the new Wembley Stadium has been named the [[White Horse Bridge]]. The official attendance is often quoted as 126,047. The match was a 2\u20130 victory for Bolton Wanderers, with [[David Jack]] scoring the first ever goal at Wembley.\n\n===Matthews Final===\n{{main|1953 FA Cup Final}}\nThe [[1953 FA Cup Final]] between [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] and [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] was dubbed the \"Matthews Final\" after Blackpool's winger [[Stanley Matthews]].

It remained the only hat-trick ever scored in an FA Cup Final at the original Wembley.\n\nThe FA Cup final was played there in April or May until 2000 (excluding the 1970 replay when [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] beat [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] at [[Old Trafford]]). It was also the venue for finals of the [[FA Amateur Cup]], [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] (except for the early years when this was settled on a home and away basis) and in later years the [[Associate Members' Cup]] and the [[The Football League|Football League]] promotion [[Football League play-offs|play-off finals]] (in the early years of play-offs they were home and away fixtures). The 1988 final of the [[Middlesex Senior Charity Cup|Middlesex Charity Cup]] was also played there.<ref>{{cite news | last =Francis | first =Tony | title =Future returns to the past | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]]| date =22 August 2005 | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2364126/Future-returns-to-the-past.html | accessdate = 14 January 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===International fixtures===\n[[File:Scoreboard end in the old Wembley Stadium.jpg|left|thumb|[[England national football team|England]] v [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in 1981]]\n[[File:The Queen presents the 1966 World Cup to England Captain, Bobby Moore.

Most early internationals (including [[England v Scotland (1870)|the first ever international football match]] (1870)) were played at [[The Oval]], which opened in 1845 as the home ground of [[Surrey County Cricket Club]] and would in 1880 host the first [[Test cricket|Test match]] played in England. For the first 27 years, the only International England games played at Wembley were fixtures against Scotland, with other games played elsewhere until 1951. The first team other than Scotland to face England at the venue was Argentina.<ref>[http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamWembley/History.html].</ref>\n\nIn 1956 and 1971, it was the venue of the home matches of the Great Britain national football team for the qualification matches to the [[Summer Olympic Games]] against [[Bulgaria at the Olympics|Bulgaria]].<ref>{{cite web | last =Barker | first =Philip | title =Wembley Stadium \u2013 An Olympic Chronology 1923\u20132003 | work =Journal of Olympic History | publisher = [[LA84 Foundation]] | date =June 2003 | url =http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv11n2/johv11n2i.pdf | format = [[Portable Document Format|PDF format]] | accessdate = 14 January 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, it was the leading venue of the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]]. It hosted nine matches, including the [[1966 FIFA World Cup Final|final]], where tournament hosts England won 4\u20132 after extra time against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]].\n\nSeven years later, Wembley was the venue for a specially arranged friendly between teams called \"The Three\" and \"The Six\" to celebrate the [[United Kingdom]] joining the [[European Union]]. The match finished 2-0 to \"The Three\".\n\nIn 1996, it was the principal venue of [[UEFA Euro 1996]], hosting all of England's matches, as well as the tournament's final, where Germany won the [[UEFA European Championship]] for a third time after defeating the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] 2\u20131 with the first international [[golden goal]] in football history. Germany had earlier defeated England on penalties in the semi-final after a 1\u20131 draw, with [[Gareth Southgate]] missing a penalty for England in the shoot-out.\n\nEngland's final two competitive matches played at the stadium resulted in 0\u20131 defeats for England to Scotland and Germany respectively. The first defeat was in the play off for the [[UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying|Euro 2000 qualifiers]] in November 1999, but England still went through as they won the other leg 2\u20130 at [[Hampden Park]]. However, the final match at Wembley was the opening [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifier]] for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], and defeat prompted the resignation of England manager [[Kevin Keegan]] at the end of the match after just 18 months in charge.\n\n===Club football===\n[[File:Bristol Rovers v Tranmere Rovers, Wembley 1990 (344523653).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] v [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] [[Football League Trophy|Leyland DAF Cup]] Final in [[1989\u201390 Football League Trophy|1990]]]]\nIn all, the stadium hosted five [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] finals. The first two were [[1963 European Cup Final|1963]] final between [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] and [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], and the [[1968 European Cup Final|1968]] final between Manchester United and Benfica. In [[1971 European Cup Final|1971]], it again hosted the final, between [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]], and once more in [[1978 European Cup Final|1978]], this time between [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]], another in [[1992 European Cup Final|1992]], when [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] played [[U.C.

The [[Wembley Lions (speedway)|Wembley Lions]] returned in 1946 and operated in the top flight until the end of the 1956 season winning a number of League titles. A short lived revival saw the Lions in the [[Speedway British League|British League]] in the [[1970 British League season|1970]] and [[1971 British League season|1971 season]]s. [[Lionel Van Praag]] ([[1936 Individual Speedway World Championship|1936]]), [[Tommy Price]] ([[1949 Individual Speedway World Championship|1949]]), and [[Freddie Williams (speedway rider)|Freddie Williams]]  ([[1950 Individual Speedway World Championship|1950]] and [[1953 Individual Speedway World Championship|1953]]), all won World Championships whilst riding for Wembley. The ashes for the speedway track were supplied by Richard Biffa Ltd who's operating base at the time was in Wembley Hill Road. Richard Biffa later became Biffa Waste Services. The Lions were formed by the Wembley Stadium chairman [[Arthur Elvin|Sir Arthur Elvin]].<ref name=\"wpwy\"/>\n\nBetween 1936 and 1960 Wembley hosted all of the first 15 finals of the [[Speedway World Championship]].

Despite regularly being used for World Championship and other British championship meetings, [[Wembley]] long had a reputation as a track that was difficult to pass on which often led to processional racing. Among those who never performed well there despite their credentials include [[1973 Individual Speedway World Championship|1973]] World Champion [[Jerzy Szczakiel]] (who won his title at home in Poland and two weeks later under difficult circumstances failed to score in the World Team Cup Final at Wembley), while others such as Ivan Mauger and Ole Olsen often seemed to find their best form at the stadium. The track itself was located inside of the greyhound racing track, but intersected the stadium's playing field at the corners. The pits were located in the tunnel at the eastern end of the stadium.\n\nThe track record at Wembley will forever be held by Denmark's World Champion of [[1984 Individual Speedway World Championship|1984]], [[1985 Individual Speedway World Championship|1985]] & [[1988 Individual Speedway World Championship|1988]] [[Erik Gundersen]]. In Heat 6 of the 1981 World Final, Gundersen set the 4-lap record (clutch start) of 66.8 seconds. As this was the last time the stadium was used for speedway racing, it remains the track record.\n\n===Stock car racing===\nTwo meetings were held at [[Wembley]] in 1974 promoted by [[Trevor Redmond]]. The first meeting held featured [[BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars]] and [[Hot Rods (oval racing)|National Hot Rods]]. The second meeting featured the [[BriSCA Formula 2 Stock Cars]] World Final with F1's in support. Before the first meeting the Wembley groundsman threatened to resign over possible damage to the hallowed turf. The pitch was surrounded by wooden beams and little damage was caused.<ref>BriSCA Formula One \u2013 The first 50 years 1954\u20132004 Keith Barber p&nbsp;178\u2013179</ref>\n\n===Rugby union===\nThough the venue was not traditionally a regular host of [[rugby union]] matches, England played a friendly against Canada on 17 October 1992, as their regular home stadium at [[Twickenham]] was undergoing redevelopment. [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] played their [[Rugby Union Six Nations Championship|Five Nations]] and autumn international home matches at [[Wembley]] (as [[Twickenham Stadium]] would not accommodate them) while [[Cardiff Arms Park]] was being rebuilt as the [[Millennium Stadium]] in the late 1990s (a deal reciprocated for FA Cups during the construction of the new Wembley Stadium). In total there were seven internationals.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Date\n! Competition\n!colspan=2| Home team\n!colspan=2| Away team\n!

It was the first sport Sir [[Arthur Elvin]] introduced to the stadium. The opening meeting was in 1927.<ref name=ind>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/magnificent-monument-to-vision-of-one-man-637502.html|title=Magnificent monument to vision of one man|last=Harris|first=Neil|date= 6 October 2000| work =[[The Independent]]|accessdate= 29 September 2008 }}</ref> The greyhound racing provided the stadium with its main source of regular income, especially in the early decades, and continued to attract crowds of several thousand up until the early 1960s.<ref>[https://www.panoramio.com/photo/27354693 Photo of Wembley Stadium, prepared for the next greyhound race]</ref> The stadium staged its last greyhound race meeting in December 1998 with the owners, the [[Greyhound Racing Association]], citing economic reasons and the lack of plans for a greyhound track in the stadium's redevelopment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Richard|title=Greyhound racing: Hounded out after a 71-year run|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/greyhound-racing-hounded-out-after-a-71year-run-1191954.html|website=independent.co.uk|accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nTwo of the biggest events in the greyhound racing calendar are the [[The St Leger - Greyhounds|St Leger]] and [[Trafalgar Cup]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Baiden|first=Gary|title=The History of Oxford Stadium|year=2009|publisher=authorhouse|isbn=978-1-4490-2054-5}}{{self-published source|date=January 2019}}</ref>{{self-published inline|certain=y|date=January 2019}}\nBoth were originally held at Wembley, the St Leger from 1928 until 1998 after which it moved to [[Wimbledon Stadium]] and the Trafalgar Cup from 1929 until 1998 after which it moved to [[Oxford Stadium]]. In 1931 the famous greyhound [[Mick the Miller]] won the St Leger.\n\nWembley's owners' refusal to cancel the regular greyhound racing meant that the match between [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] and [[France national football team|France]] in the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] was played at [[White City Stadium|White City]].\n\n===American football===\nThe [[National Football League]] held nine preseason [[American football]] games at Wembley between 1983 and 1993. The [[Minnesota Vikings]] and the [[St. Louis Cardinals (NFL, 1960\u20131987)|St. Louis Cardinals]] played the first game on 6 August 1983. The [[Detroit Lions]] and the [[Dallas Cowboys]] played the last game on 8 August 1993. The [[United States Football League]] also played an exhibition game there on 21 July 1984 between the [[Baltimore Stars|Philadelphia Stars]] and [[Tampa Bay Bandits]]. The [[London Monarchs]] of the [[NFL Europa|World League of American Football]] played at the venue in 1991 and 1992. Wembley hosted [[World Bowl '91]] the inaugural [[World Bowl]] where the Monarchs defeated the [[Barcelona Dragons]] 21\u20130.\n\n===Gaelic football===\nFrom 1958 until the mid-1970s, [[hurling]] and [[gaelic football]] tournaments known as the \"Wembley Tournaments\" were held at Wembley Stadium to bring the Irish sports to expatriates in Britain at the time. Several Gaelic football games were played in Wembley Stadium, most of them exhibition matches, most notably [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] and [[Down GAA|Down]] in 1961.\n\n===Other events===\nThe stadium also staged women's field hockey matches in which England appeared in their annual match between 1951 and 1969 and then from 1971 to 1991.\n\nOn 18 June 1963, Wembley hosted a [[Muhammad Ali vs. Henry Cooper|heavyweight boxing match]] between London native boxer [[Henry Cooper]] and American rising star [[Muhammad Ali]] in front of 35,000 spectators.\n\nOn 26 May 1975, in front of 90,000 people, [[Evel Knievel]] crashed while trying to land a jump over 13 single decker city buses, an accident which resulted in his initial retirement from his daredevil&nbsp;life.<ref name=bevknvbs>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=EtZVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_dcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6888%2C7018770 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon, U.S.) |agency=UPI |title=Battered Evel Knievel quitting stunt business |date=27 May 1975 |page=5A}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (now known as WWE) drew a sellout of 80,355 when [[SummerSlam (1992)|SummerSlam]] was hosted at Wembley Stadium. The main event featured English wrestler [[Davey Boy Smith]] winning the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] from [[Bret Hart]]. As of April 2016, the WWE considers this to be their fourth largest live gate in history behind only [[WrestleMania 32]] (2016) which drew a reported 101,763, [[WrestleMania III]] (1987) which drew a reported 93,173 and [[WrestleMania 29]] (2013) which drew 80,676 fans.\n\n==Music==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2017}}\nThe stadium became a musical venue in August 1972 with [[The London Rock and Roll Show]], an all star concert. It later played host to a number of concerts and events, most notably the British leg of [[Live Aid]], which featured such acts as [[David Bowie]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[Elton John]], [[The Who]], [[Dire Straits]] and [[U2]], held at the stadium on 13 July 1985. [[Phil Collins]] performed at [[Wembley]], then boarded a helicopter to [[London Heathrow Airport]] and took a [[British Airways]] [[Concorde]] to [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], to perform at the American segment of Live Aid at [[JFK Stadium]] on the same day.\n\nOther charity concerts which took place in the stadium were the [[Human Rights Now!]] concert, [[Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute|The Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute Concert]], [[Nelson Mandela: An International Tribute for a Free South Africa|Nelson Mandela: An International Tribute for a Free South Africa Concert]], [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert for AIDS Awareness]] and the [[NetAid]] charity concert.\n\nActs who played at Wembley Stadium include:\n* [[Michael Jackson]] (15 times, most by any artist in the history of Wembley Stadium, selling over 1.1 million tickets in the process)\nDuring Michael Jackson's [[Bad World Tour]] in 1988, seven sold-out concerts were staged at Wembley which included five in a row, and two at a later date. Each concert had an attendance of 72,000 people. According to the [[Guinness Book of World Records]], Jackson set a new world record with 504,000 people attending the seven sold-out concerts. He was given a special award by Wembley Stadium Officials for achieving this milestone. The concert on 16 July 1988 was attended by [[Princess Diana]] and [[Prince Charles]]. The [[DVD]] of this concert ([[Michael Jackson: Live at Wembley July 16, 1988]]) was released on 18 September 2012 as part of the [[Bad 25|25th Anniversary reissue]] of his 1987 hit album [[Bad (album)|Bad]] and also as a stand-alone DVD. A further five sold-out concerts followed in 1992 during his [[Dangerous World Tour]] and his last three shows in 1997 during [[HIStory World Tour]] brought total ticket sales to over 1.1 million. To date, this record has not been broken.\n* [[Celine Dion]] (two times, including 11 & 12 July 1999 as part of her [[Let's Talk About Love World Tour]], performing to 80,000 people each night.)\n* [[Tina Turner]] (4 sold-out concerts at Wembley Stadium, two in July 1996 and two in July 2000.

It was built along the left and right banks of the [[Euphrates]] river with steep embankments to contain the river's seasonal floods. Babylon was originally a small Akkadian town dating from the period of the [[Akkadian Empire]] {{circa|2300 BC}}.\n\nThe town became part of a small independent [[city-state]] with the rise of the [[First Babylonian dynasty]] in the 19th century BC. The [[Amorites|Amorite]] king [[Hammurabi]] created a short-lived empire in the 18th century BC. He built Babylon into a major city and declared himself its king. Southern Mesopotamia became known as Babylonia and Babylon eclipsed [[Nippur]] as its holy city. The empire waned under Hammurabi's son [[Samsu-iluna]] and Babylon spent long periods under [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]], [[Kassites|Kassite]] and [[Elam]]ite domination. After being destroyed and then rebuilt by the Assyrians, Babylon became the capital of the short-lived [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] from 609 to 539&nbsp;BC. The [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] were one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. After the fall of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, the city came under the rule of the [[Achaemenid]], [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]], and [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid]] empires.\n\nIt has been estimated that Babylon was the largest city in the world {{circa|1770|1670&nbsp;BC}}, and again {{circa|612|320&nbsp;BC|lk=no}}. It was perhaps the first city to reach a population above 200,000.<ref name=Chandler>Tertius Chandler.

Originally, the river roughly bisected the city, but the course of the river has since shifted so that most of the remains of the former western part of the city are now inundated. Some portions of the city wall to the west of the river also remain.\n\nOnly a small portion of the ancient city (3% of the area within the inner walls; 1.5% of the area within the outer walls; 0.1% at the depth of Middle and Old Babylon) has been excavated.<ref name=OP2011 /> Known remains include:\n* Kasr&nbsp;\u2013 also called Palace or Castle, it is the location of the [[Neo-Babylonian]] ziggurat [[Etemenanki]] and lies in the center of the site.\n* Amran Ibn Ali&nbsp;\u2013 the highest of the mounds at {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=out|sigfig=|sp=us}} to the south.

The water table in the region has risen greatly over the centuries, and artifacts from the time before the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] are unavailable to current standard archaeological methods. Additionally, the Neo-Babylonians conducted significant rebuilding projects in the city, which destroyed or obscured much of the earlier record. Babylon was pillaged numerous times after revolting against foreign rule, most notably by the [[Hittites]] and [[Elamites]] in the 2nd millennium, then by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in the 1st millennium. Much of the western half of the city is now beneath the river, and other parts of the site have been mined for commercial building materials.\n\nOnly the Koldewey expedition recovered artifacts from the Old Babylonian period.

The Amorites at first did not practice agriculture like more advanced Mesopotamians, preferring a semi-nomadic lifestyle, herding sheep. Over time, Amorite grain merchants rose to prominence and established their own independent dynasties in several south Mesopotamian city-states, most notably [[Isin]], [[Larsa]], [[Eshnunna]], [[Lagash]], and later, founding Babylon as a state.\n\n===Old Babylonian period===\n[[File:Hammurabi's Babylonia 1.svg|thumb|right|Map showing the Babylonian territory upon Hammurabi's ascension in 1792&nbsp;BC and upon his death in 1750&nbsp;BC]]\n\n[[File:Cylinder Seal, Old Babylonian, formerly in the Charterhouse Collection 03.jpg|thumb|left|Old Babylonian [[cylinder seal]], [[hematite]].

However, when the Assyrians turned their attention to expanding their colonies in [[Asia Minor]], the Amorites eventually began to supplant native rulers across the region.}} rule in Babylon began ({{circa|19th or 18th century BC}}) with a chieftain named [[Sumu-abum]], who declared independence from the neighboring city-state of [[Kazallu]]. [[Sumu-la-El]], whose dates may be concurrent with those of Sumu-abum, is usually given as the progenitor of the [[First Babylonian dynasty]]. Both are credited with building the walls of Babylon. In any case, the records describe Sumu-la-El's military successes establishing a regional sphere of influence for Babylon.<ref>Vedeler (2006), pp. 8\u201315. \"However, this later tradition is almost certainly a simplification or even a reworking of the actual events surrounding Sumu-abum, who was never regarded as an actual ancestor to the other kings of the Babylon I dynasty (Edzard 1957:122); in reality the relationship of Sumu-abum to Babylon was much more complex. It was long been noted that many of Sumu-abum's year names are identical or virtually identical to the year names of Sumu-la-el, whom we know for certain was king of Babylon. Goddeeris (2002:319\u2013320) sums these parallels up as follows: Sa 1 and 2 / Sl 5 and 6: building the wall of Babylon. Sa 9 / Sl 'b': building the wall of Dilbat. Sa 13/14 / Sl 20/21: the destruction and seizure of Kazallu.\"</ref>\n\nBabylon was initially a minor city-state, and controlled little surrounding territory; its first four Amorite rulers did not assume the title of king. The older and more powerful states of [[Assyria]], [[Elam]], [[Isin]], and [[Larsa]] overshadowed Babylon until it became the capital of [[Hammurabi]]'s short lived empire about a century later. Hammurabi (r. 1792\u20131750&nbsp;BC) is famous for codifying the laws of Babylonia into the ''[[Code of Hammurabi]]''. He conquered all of the cities and city states of southern Mesopotamia, including [[Isin]], [[Larsa]], [[Ur]], [[Uruk]], [[Nippur]], [[Lagash]], [[Eridu]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], [[Adab (city)|Adab]], [[Eshnunna]], [[Akshak]], [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]], [[Shuruppak]], [[Bad-tibira]], [[Sippar]], and [[Girsu]], coalescing them into one kingdom, ruled from Babylon. Hammurabi also invaded and conquered [[Elam]] to the east, and the kingdoms of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] and [[Ebla]] to the northwest. After a protracted struggle with the powerful Assyrian king [[Ishme-Dagan]] of the [[Old Assyrian Empire]], he forced his successor to pay tribute late in his reign, spreading Babylonian power to Assyria's [[Hattians|Hattian]] and [[Hurrian]] colonies in [[Asia Minor]].\n\nAfter the reign of Hammurabi, the whole of southern Mesopotamia came to be known as [[Babylonia]], whereas the north had already coalesced centuries before into [[Assyria]]. From this time, Babylon supplanted [[Nippur]] and [[Eridu]] as the major religious centers of southern Mesopotamia. Hammurabi's empire destabilized after his death. Assyrians defeated and drove out the Babylonians and Amorites. The far south of Mesopotamia broke away, forming the native [[Sealand Dynasty]], and the Elamites appropriated territory in eastern Mesopotamia. The Amorite dynasty remained in power in Babylon, which again became a small city state.\n\nTexts from Old Babylon often include references to [[Shamash]], the sun-god of Sippar, treated as a supreme deity, and [[Marduk]], considered as his son. Marduk was later elevated to a higher status and Shamash lowered, perhaps reflecting Babylon's rising political power<ref name=Lambert2011 />\n\n=== Middle Babylon ===\n\nIn 1595&nbsp;BC{{efn|Please see [[Chronology of the ancient Near East]] for more discussion on dating events in the [[2nd millennium BC]], including the Sack of Babylon.}} the city was overthrown by the [[Hittite Empire]] from [[Asia Minor]]. Thereafter, [[Kassites]] from the [[Zagros Mountains]] of north western [[Ancient Iran]] captured Babylon, ushering in a dynasty that lasted for 435&nbsp;years, until 1160&nbsp;BC. The city was renamed Karanduniash during this period. Kassite Babylon eventually became subject to the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365\u20131053 BC) to the north, and [[Elam]] to the east, with both powers vying for control of the city. The Assyrian king [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] took the throne of Babylon in 1235&nbsp;BC.\n\nBy 1155&nbsp;BC, after continued attacks and annexing of territory by the Assyrians and Elamites, the Kassites were deposed in Babylon. An Akkadian south Mesopotamian dynasty then ruled for the first time. However, Babylon remained weak and subject to domination by Assyria. Its ineffectual native kings were unable to prevent new waves of foreign West Semitic settlers from the deserts of the Levant, including the [[Arameans]] and [[Suteans]] in the 11th century BC, and finally the [[Chaldea]]ns in the 9th century BC, entering and appropriating areas of Babylonia for themselves. The Arameans briefly ruled in Babylon during the late 11th century BC.\n\n===Assyrian period===\n[[File:Sennacherib.jpg|thumb|Sennacherib of Assyria during his [[Battle of Halule|Babylonian war]], relief from his palace in Nineveh]]\nDuring the rule of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911\u2013609&nbsp;BC), Babylonia was under constant [[Assyria]]n domination or direct control. During the reign of [[Sennacherib]] of Assyria, Babylonia was in a constant state of revolt, led by a chieftain named [[Marduk-apla-iddina II|Merodach-Baladan]], in alliance with the [[Elamites]], and suppressed only by the complete destruction of the city of Babylon. In 689&nbsp;BC, its walls, temples and palaces were razed, and the rubble was thrown into the Arakhtu, the sea bordering the earlier Babylon on the south. Destruction of the religious center shocked many, and the subsequent murder of Sennacherib by two of his own sons while praying to the god [[Nisroch]] was considered an act of atonement. Consequently, his successor [[Esarhaddon]] hastened to rebuild the old city and make it his residence during part of the year. After his death, Babylonia was governed by his elder son, the [[Assyria]]n prince [[Shamash-shum-ukin]], who eventually started a civil war in 652&nbsp;BC against his own brother, [[Ashurbanipal]], who ruled in [[Nineveh]]. Shamash-shum-ukin enlisted the help of other peoples subject to Assyria, including [[Elam]], [[Persia]], [[Chaldea]]ns, and [[Suteans]] of southern Mesopotamia, and the [[Canaanites]] and [[Arabs]] dwelling in the deserts south of [[Mesopotamia]].\n\nOnce again, Babylon was besieged by the Assyrians, starved into surrender and its allies were defeated. Ashurbanipal celebrated a \"service of reconciliation\", but did not venture to \"take the hands\" of [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]]. An Assyrian governor named [[Kandalanu]] was appointed as ruler of the city. Ashurbanipal did collect texts from Babylon for inclusion in his extensive [[Library of Ashurbanipal|library]] at Ninevah.<ref name=OP2011 />\n\nAfter the death of Ashurbanipal, the Assyrian empire destabilized due to a series of internal civil wars throughout the reigns of Assyrian kings [[Ashur-etil-ilani]], [[Sin-shumu-lishir]] and [[Sinsharishkun]]. Eventually Babylon, like many other parts of the near east, took advantage of the chaos within Assyria to free itself from Assyrian rule. In the subsequent overthrow of the Assyrian Empire by an alliance of peoples, the Babylonians saw another example of divine vengeance.<ref>[[Albert Houtum-Schindler]], \"Babylon,\" ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 11th ed.</ref>\n\n===Neo-Babylonian Empire===\n[[File:Cuneiform cylinder- inscription of Nebuchadnezzar II commemorating the reconstruction of Etemenanki, the ziggurat at Babylon MET ME86 11 284.jpg|thumb|Cuneiform cylinder from reign of Nebuchadnezzar II honoring the exorcism and reconstruction of the ziggurat [[Etemenanki]] by Nabopolassar.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Spar|first1=Ira|last2=Jursa|first2=Michael|title=The Ebabbar Temple Archive and Other Texts from the Fourth to the First Millennium B.C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JbREBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA288|series=Cuneiform Texts in The Metropolitan Museum of Art|volume=IV|year=2014|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-1-57506-327-0|pages=288\u2013290}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Babylon relief.jpg|right|thumb|Detail of a relief from the reconstruction of the Ishtar Gate]]\n[[File:Ishtar Gate at Berlin Museum.jpg|left|thumb|A reconstruction of the blue-tiled Ishtar Gate which was the northern entrance to Babylon.

When new territory was conquered or a rebellious vassal crushed, an increased imperial presence in the trouble spot was often complemented by the removal of large numbers of the indigenous population to the imperial core, effectively breaking up the rebellious population and reducing the potential for future resistance. This practice was effective, and continued throughout the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian empires until 539 BC and Cyrus's conquest of Babylon. The majority of the immigrant population were not slaves (Yamauchi 2002: 365), and some did rise to high status positions at the core of the empire (a possibility reflected in the career of the biblical Daniel, who rises to the status of trusted royal confidant).\"}} According to the Hebrew Bible, he [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BCE)|destroyed]] [[Solomon's Temple]] and [[Babylonian captivity|exiled]] the Jews to Babylon.

Metal grates were installed underwater, allowing the river to flow through the city walls while preventing intrusion. The Persians devised a plan to enter the city via the river. During a Babylonian national feast, Cyrus' troops upstream diverted the Euphrates River, allowing Cyrus' soldiers to enter the city through the lowered water. The Persian army conquered the outlying areas of the city while the majority of Babylonians at the city center were unaware of the breach.

The hundred gates can be considered a reference to [[Homer]], and following the pronouncement of [[Archibald Henry Sayce]] in 1883, Herodotus' account of Babylon has largely been considered to represent Greek folklore rather than an authentic voyage to Babylon.

These features included the Southern Palace of Nebuchandnezzar, with 250 rooms, five courtyards, and a 30-meter entrance arch. The project also reinforced the Processional Way, the [[Lion of Babylon (statue)|Lion of Babylon]], and an amphitheater constructed in the city's Hellenistic era. In 1982 the government minted a set of seven coins displaying iconic features of Babylon.  A [[Babylon International Festival]] was held in September 1987, and annually thereafter until 2002 (excepting 1990 and 1991), to showcase this work.

It was built along the left and right banks of the [[Euphrates]] river with steep embankments to contain the river's seasonal floods. Babylon was originally a small Akkadian town dating from the period of the [[Akkadian Empire]] {{circa|2300 BC}}.\n\nThe town became part of a small independent [[city-state]] with the rise of the [[First Babylonian dynasty]] in the 19th century BC. The [[Amorites|Amorite]] king [[Hammurabi]] created a short-lived empire in the 18th century BC. He built Babylon into a major city and declared himself its king. Southern Mesopotamia became known as Babylonia and Babylon eclipsed [[Nippur]] as its holy city. The empire waned under Hammurabi's son [[Samsu-iluna]] and Babylon spent long periods under [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]], [[Kassites|Kassite]] and [[Elam]]ite domination. After being destroyed and then rebuilt by the Assyrians, Babylon became the capital of the short-lived [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] from 609 to 539&nbsp;BC. The [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] were one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. After the fall of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, the city came under the rule of the [[Achaemenid]], [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]], and [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid]] empires.\n\nIt has been estimated that Babylon was the largest city in the world {{circa|1770|1670&nbsp;BC}}, and again {{circa|612|320&nbsp;BC|lk=no}}. It was perhaps the first city to reach a population above 200,000.<ref name=Chandler>Tertius Chandler.

Some portions of the city wall to the west of the river also remain.\n\nOnly a small portion of the ancient city (3% of the area within the inner walls; 1.5% of the area within the outer walls; 0.1% at the depth of Middle and Old Babylon) has been excavated.<ref name=OP2011 /> Known remains include:\n* Kasr&nbsp;\u2013 also called Palace or Castle, it is the location of the [[Neo-Babylonian]] ziggurat [[Etemenanki]] and lies in the center of the site.\n* Amran Ibn Ali&nbsp;\u2013 the highest of the mounds at {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=out|sigfig=|sp=us}} to the south.

The water table in the region has risen greatly over the centuries, and artifacts from the time before the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] are unavailable to current standard archaeological methods. Additionally, the Neo-Babylonians conducted significant rebuilding projects in the city, which destroyed or obscured much of the earlier record. Babylon was pillaged numerous times after revolting against foreign rule, most notably by the [[Hittites]] and [[Elamites]] in the 2nd millennium, then by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in the 1st millennium. Much of the western half of the city is now beneath the river, and other parts of the site have been mined for commercial building materials.\n\nOnly the Koldewey expedition recovered artifacts from the Old Babylonian period.

The Amorites at first did not practice agriculture like more advanced Mesopotamians, preferring a semi-nomadic lifestyle, herding sheep. Over time, Amorite grain merchants rose to prominence and established their own independent dynasties in several south Mesopotamian city-states, most notably [[Isin]], [[Larsa]], [[Eshnunna]], [[Lagash]], and later, founding Babylon as a state.\n\n===Old Babylonian period===\n[[File:Hammurabi's Babylonia 1.svg|thumb|right|Map showing the Babylonian territory upon Hammurabi's ascension in 1792&nbsp;BC and upon his death in 1750&nbsp;BC]]\n\n[[File:Cylinder Seal, Old Babylonian, formerly in the Charterhouse Collection 03.jpg|thumb|left|Old Babylonian [[cylinder seal]], [[hematite]].

However, when the Assyrians turned their attention to expanding their colonies in [[Asia Minor]], the Amorites eventually began to supplant native rulers across the region.}} rule in Babylon began ({{circa|19th or 18th century BC}}) with a chieftain named [[Sumu-abum]], who declared independence from the neighboring city-state of [[Kazallu]]. [[Sumu-la-El]], whose dates may be concurrent with those of Sumu-abum, is usually given as the progenitor of the [[First Babylonian dynasty]]. Both are credited with building the walls of Babylon. In any case, the records describe Sumu-la-El's military successes establishing a regional sphere of influence for Babylon.<ref>Vedeler (2006), pp. 8\u201315. \"However, this later tradition is almost certainly a simplification or even a reworking of the actual events surrounding Sumu-abum, who was never regarded as an actual ancestor to the other kings of the Babylon I dynasty (Edzard 1957:122); in reality the relationship of Sumu-abum to Babylon was much more complex. It was long been noted that many of Sumu-abum's year names are identical or virtually identical to the year names of Sumu-la-el, whom we know for certain was king of Babylon. Goddeeris (2002:319\u2013320) sums these parallels up as follows: Sa 1 and 2 / Sl 5 and 6: building the wall of Babylon. Sa 9 / Sl 'b': building the wall of Dilbat. Sa 13/14 / Sl 20/21: the destruction and seizure of Kazallu.\"</ref>\n\nBabylon was initially a minor city-state, and controlled little surrounding territory; its first four Amorite rulers did not assume the title of king. The older and more powerful states of [[Assyria]], [[Elam]], [[Isin]], and [[Larsa]] overshadowed Babylon until it became the capital of [[Hammurabi]]'s short lived empire about a century later. Hammurabi (r. 1792\u20131750&nbsp;BC) is famous for codifying the laws of Babylonia into the ''[[Code of Hammurabi]]''. He conquered all of the cities and city states of southern Mesopotamia, including [[Isin]], [[Larsa]], [[Ur]], [[Uruk]], [[Nippur]], [[Lagash]], [[Eridu]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], [[Adab (city)|Adab]], [[Eshnunna]], [[Akshak]], [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]], [[Shuruppak]], [[Bad-tibira]], [[Sippar]], and [[Girsu]], coalescing them into one kingdom, ruled from Babylon. Hammurabi also invaded and conquered [[Elam]] to the east, and the kingdoms of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] and [[Ebla]] to the northwest. After a protracted struggle with the powerful Assyrian king [[Ishme-Dagan]] of the [[Old Assyrian Empire]], he forced his successor to pay tribute late in his reign, spreading Babylonian power to Assyria's [[Hattians|Hattian]] and [[Hurrian]] colonies in [[Asia Minor]].\n\nAfter the reign of Hammurabi, the whole of southern Mesopotamia came to be known as [[Babylonia]], whereas the north had already coalesced centuries before into [[Assyria]]. From this time, Babylon supplanted [[Nippur]] and [[Eridu]] as the major religious centers of southern Mesopotamia. Hammurabi's empire destabilized after his death. Assyrians defeated and drove out the Babylonians and Amorites. The far south of Mesopotamia broke away, forming the native [[Sealand Dynasty]], and the Elamites appropriated territory in eastern Mesopotamia. The Amorite dynasty remained in power in Babylon, which again became a small city state.\n\nTexts from Old Babylon often include references to [[Shamash]], the sun-god of Sippar, treated as a supreme deity, and [[Marduk]], considered as his son. Marduk was later elevated to a higher status and Shamash lowered, perhaps reflecting Babylon's rising political power<ref name=Lambert2011 />\n\n=== Middle Babylon ===\n\nIn 1595&nbsp;BC{{efn|Please see [[Chronology of the ancient Near East]] for more discussion on dating events in the [[2nd millennium BC]], including the Sack of Babylon.}} the city was overthrown by the [[Hittite Empire]] from [[Asia Minor]]. Thereafter, [[Kassites]] from the [[Zagros Mountains]] of north western [[Ancient Iran]] captured Babylon, ushering in a dynasty that lasted for 435&nbsp;years, until 1160&nbsp;BC. The city was renamed Karanduniash during this period. Kassite Babylon eventually became subject to the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365\u20131053 BC) to the north, and [[Elam]] to the east, with both powers vying for control of the city. The Assyrian king [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] took the throne of Babylon in 1235&nbsp;BC.\n\nBy 1155&nbsp;BC, after continued attacks and annexing of territory by the Assyrians and Elamites, the Kassites were deposed in Babylon. An Akkadian south Mesopotamian dynasty then ruled for the first time. However, Babylon remained weak and subject to domination by Assyria. Its ineffectual native kings were unable to prevent new waves of foreign West Semitic settlers from the deserts of the Levant, including the [[Arameans]] and [[Suteans]] in the 11th century BC, and finally the [[Chaldea]]ns in the 9th century BC, entering and appropriating areas of Babylonia for themselves. The Arameans briefly ruled in Babylon during the late 11th century BC.\n\n===Assyrian period===\n[[File:Sennacherib.jpg|thumb|Sennacherib of Assyria during his [[Battle of Halule|Babylonian war]], relief from his palace in Nineveh]]\nDuring the rule of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911\u2013609&nbsp;BC), Babylonia was under constant [[Assyria]]n domination or direct control. During the reign of [[Sennacherib]] of Assyria, Babylonia was in a constant state of revolt, led by a chieftain named [[Marduk-apla-iddina II|Merodach-Baladan]], in alliance with the [[Elamites]], and suppressed only by the complete destruction of the city of Babylon. In 689&nbsp;BC, its walls, temples and palaces were razed, and the rubble was thrown into the Arakhtu, the sea bordering the earlier Babylon on the south. Destruction of the religious center shocked many, and the subsequent murder of Sennacherib by two of his own sons while praying to the god [[Nisroch]] was considered an act of atonement. Consequently, his successor [[Esarhaddon]] hastened to rebuild the old city and make it his residence during part of the year. After his death, Babylonia was governed by his elder son, the [[Assyria]]n prince [[Shamash-shum-ukin]], who eventually started a civil war in 652&nbsp;BC against his own brother, [[Ashurbanipal]], who ruled in [[Nineveh]]. Shamash-shum-ukin enlisted the help of other peoples subject to Assyria, including [[Elam]], [[Persia]], [[Chaldea]]ns, and [[Suteans]] of southern Mesopotamia, and the [[Canaanites]] and [[Arabs]] dwelling in the deserts south of [[Mesopotamia]].\n\nOnce again, Babylon was besieged by the Assyrians, starved into surrender and its allies were defeated. Ashurbanipal celebrated a \"service of reconciliation\", but did not venture to \"take the hands\" of [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]]. An Assyrian governor named [[Kandalanu]] was appointed as ruler of the city. Ashurbanipal did collect texts from Babylon for inclusion in his extensive [[Library of Ashurbanipal|library]] at Ninevah.<ref name=OP2011 />\n\nAfter the death of Ashurbanipal, the Assyrian empire destabilized due to a series of internal civil wars throughout the reigns of Assyrian kings [[Ashur-etil-ilani]], [[Sin-shumu-lishir]] and [[Sinsharishkun]]. Eventually Babylon, like many other parts of the near east, took advantage of the chaos within Assyria to free itself from Assyrian rule. In the subsequent overthrow of the Assyrian Empire by an alliance of peoples, the Babylonians saw another example of divine vengeance.<ref>[[Albert Houtum-Schindler]], \"Babylon,\" ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 11th ed.</ref>\n\n===Neo-Babylonian Empire===\n[[File:Cuneiform cylinder- inscription of Nebuchadnezzar II commemorating the reconstruction of Etemenanki, the ziggurat at Babylon MET ME86 11 284.jpg|thumb|Cuneiform cylinder from reign of Nebuchadnezzar II honoring the exorcism and reconstruction of the ziggurat [[Etemenanki]] by Nabopolassar.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Spar|first1=Ira|last2=Jursa|first2=Michael|title=The Ebabbar Temple Archive and Other Texts from the Fourth to the First Millennium B.C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JbREBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA288|series=Cuneiform Texts in The Metropolitan Museum of Art|volume=IV|year=2014|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-1-57506-327-0|pages=288\u2013290}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Babylon relief.jpg|right|thumb|Detail of a relief from the reconstruction of the Ishtar Gate]]\n[[File:Ishtar Gate at Berlin Museum.jpg|left|thumb|A reconstruction of the blue-tiled Ishtar Gate which was the northern entrance to Babylon.

When new territory was conquered or a rebellious vassal crushed, an increased imperial presence in the trouble spot was often complemented by the removal of large numbers of the indigenous population to the imperial core, effectively breaking up the rebellious population and reducing the potential for future resistance. This practice was effective, and continued throughout the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian empires until 539 BC and Cyrus's conquest of Babylon. The majority of the immigrant population were not slaves (Yamauchi 2002: 365), and some did rise to high status positions at the core of the empire (a possibility reflected in the career of the biblical Daniel, who rises to the status of trusted royal confidant).\"}} According to the Hebrew Bible, he [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BCE)|destroyed]] [[Solomon's Temple]] and [[Babylonian captivity|exiled]] the Jews to Babylon.

Babylon's walls were considered impenetrable. The only way into the city was through one of its many gates or through the Euphrates River. Metal grates were installed underwater, allowing the river to flow through the city walls while preventing intrusion. The Persians devised a plan to enter the city via the river. During a Babylonian national feast, Cyrus' troops upstream diverted the Euphrates River, allowing Cyrus' soldiers to enter the city through the lowered water. The Persian army conquered the outlying areas of the city while the majority of Babylonians at the city center were unaware of the breach.

The hundred gates can be considered a reference to [[Homer]], and following the pronouncement of [[Archibald Henry Sayce]] in 1883, Herodotus' account of Babylon has largely been considered to represent Greek folklore rather than an authentic voyage to Babylon.

The constant turmoil virtually emptied the city of Babylon. A tablet dated 275&nbsp;BC states that the inhabitants of Babylon were transported to [[Seleucia on the Tigris|Seleucia]], where a palace and a temple ([[Esagila]]) were built.

It maintained its own culture and people, who spoke varieties of [[Aramaic]], and who continued to refer to their homeland as Babylon. Examples of their culture are found in the [[Babylonian Talmud]], the [[Gnostic]] [[Mandaeism|Mandaean]] religion, [[East Syrian Rite|Eastern Rite]] [[Christianity]] and [[Manichaeism|the religion]] of the prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]].

Babylonian images periodically appear on Iraqi postcards and stamps. In the 1960s, a replica of the [[Ishtar Gate]] and a reconstruction of Ninmakh Temple were built on site.<ref name=Curtis2011 />\n\nOn 14 February 1978, the [[Ba'athist]] government of Iraq under [[Saddam Hussein]] began the \"Archaeological Restoration of Babylon Project\": reconstructing features of the ancient city atop its ruins. These features included the Southern Palace of Nebuchandnezzar, with 250 rooms, five courtyards, and a 30-meter entrance arch. The project also reinforced the Processional Way, the [[Lion of Babylon (statue)|Lion of Babylon]], and an amphitheater constructed in the city's Hellenistic era. In 1982 the government minted a set of seven coins displaying iconic features of Babylon.  A [[Babylon International Festival]] was held in September 1987, and annually thereafter until 2002 (excepting 1990 and 1991), to showcase this work. Proposed reconstruction of the Hanging Gardens and the great ziggurat never took place.<ref name=Curtis2009>John Curtis, \"The Site of Babylon Today\"; in Finkel & Seymour, eds., ''Babylon'' (2009); pp. 213\u2013220.</ref><ref name=Curtis2011>John Curtis, \"The Present Condition of Babylon\"; in Cancik-Kirschbaum et al.

Silvestri stated, \"This is actually a very unique experience [for me]. I\u2019ve worked on films where there have been a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it\u2019s a very different situation. It\u2019s very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need, but at the same time the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers, which really has to be representative of all of them together.\"<ref name=\"Silvestri\" /> Silvestri recorded the score with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London, England.<ref name=\"SXSW1\"/> ''Avengers'' director [[Joss Whedon]] described the score as \"old school\", saying \"the score is very

Silvestri stated, \"This is actually a very unique experience [for me]. I\u2019ve worked on films where there have been a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it\u2019s a very different situation. It\u2019s very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need, but at the same time the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers, which really has to be representative of all of them together.\"<ref name=\"Silvestri\" /> Silvestri recorded the score with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London, England.<ref name=\"SXSW1\"/> ''Avengers'' director [[Joss Whedon]] described the score as \"old school\", saying \"the score is very old-fashioned, which is why [Silvestri] was letter perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion, the <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Hans Zimmer]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> school of 'I\u2019m just feeling a lot right now!' but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love.\"<ref name=\"SXSW1\"/> Silvestri reprises his themes from ''Captain America: The First Avenger'', and introduced new ones - including the theme for Black Widow, which is \"a lonely, plucked theme with an Eastern European flavor to define this character\".<ref>{{cite

This would have been very easy. But ... it would have cost more at retail level, and we probably would not have sold as many.

The problem seemingly comes from poorly placed vents leading to overheating in some environments. This causes the plastic mouldings inside the console to warp slightly and create knock-on effects with the laser assembly. The solution is to sit the console on a surface which dissipates heat efficiently in a well vented area or raise the unit up slightly from its resting surface.<ref name=\"problems\">{{cite web|title=Sony PlayStation 1st-gen specs difficulties|url=https://www.engadget.com/products/sony/playstation/1st-gen/specs/|website=engadget|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=18 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084637/http://www.engadget.com/products/sony/playstation/1st-gen/specs/|archive-date=19 August 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Sony representatives also recommended unplugging the PlayStation when it is not in use, as the system draws in a small amount of power (and therefore heat) even when turned off.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Buyers Beware |magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=102 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |date=March 1997 |page=20}}</ref>\n\n[[File:PlayStation Pickup.jpg|thumbnail|Comparison of old and new pick-ups]]\nThe first batch of PlayStations use a KSM-440AAM [[laser]] unit, whose case and movable parts are all built out of plastic. Over time, the plastic lens sled rail wears out\u2014usually unevenly\u2014due to friction. The placement of the laser unit close to the power supply accelerates wear, due to the additional heat, which makes the plastic more vulnerable to friction. Eventually, one side of the lens sled will become so worn that the laser can tilt, no longer pointing directly at the CD; after this, games will no longer load, due to data read errors. One common fix is turning the PlayStation upside down, which makes the lens sled rest on the unworn top rails. Sony eventually fixed the problem by making the sled out of [[Die casting|die-cast]] metal and placing the laser unit further away from the power supply on later PlayStation models.<ref name=\"problems\" /><ref name=\"specs\">{{cite web |url=http://uk.playstation.com/psvitasystem/#select-tab-specifications |title=Official PlayStation website: PlayStation Vita, PS Vita; Specifications for PlayStationVita |accessdate=7 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107200613/http://uk.playstation.com/psvitasystem/#select-tab-specifications |archive-date=7 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe PlayStation does not produce a proper signal on several older models of televisions (due to an engineering oversight) causing the display to flicker or bounce around the screen.

This served as copy protection as well as region-locking.\n\nThe installation of an unofficial modchip allowed the PlayStation to play [[CD-R]] copies of games. It also allowed the console to play games from any region, as the modchip could inject the data for any region into the system. Since there was a multitude of electronic parts on the market, by the end of the system's life cycle, anyone with minimal soldering experience could perform these modifications. This created a wave of games developed without official approval using [[Free software|free]], official tools, such as the [[Net Yaroze]], as well as unofficial tools, and the reproduction of original

This would have been very easy. But ... it would have cost more at retail level, and we probably would not have sold as many.

The problem seemingly comes from poorly placed vents leading to overheating in some environments. This causes the plastic mouldings inside the console to warp slightly and create knock-on effects with the laser assembly. The solution is to sit the console on a surface which dissipates heat efficiently in a well vented area or raise the unit up slightly from its resting surface.<ref name=\"problems\">{{cite web|title=Sony PlayStation 1st-gen specs difficulties|url=https://www.engadget.com/products/sony/playstation/1st-gen/specs/|website=engadget|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=18 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819084637/http://www.engadget.com/products/sony/playstation/1st-gen/specs/|archive-date=19 August 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Sony representatives also recommended unplugging the PlayStation when it is not in use, as the system draws in a small amount of power (and therefore heat) even when turned off.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Buyers Beware |magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=102 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |date=March 1997 |page=20}}</ref>\n\n[[File:PlayStation Pickup.jpg|thumbnail|Comparison of old and new pick-ups]]\nThe first batch of PlayStations use a KSM-440AAM [[laser]] unit, whose case and movable parts are all built out of plastic. Over time, the plastic lens sled rail wears out\u2014usually unevenly\u2014due to friction. The placement of the laser unit close to the power supply accelerates wear, due to the additional heat, which makes the plastic more vulnerable to friction. Eventually, one side of the lens sled will become so worn that the laser can tilt, no longer pointing directly at the CD; after this, games will no longer load, due to data read errors. One common fix is turning the PlayStation upside down, which makes the lens sled rest on the unworn top rails. Sony eventually fixed the problem by making the sled out of [[Die casting|die-cast]] metal and placing the laser unit further away from the power supply on later PlayStation models.<ref name=\"problems\" /><ref name=\"specs\">{{cite web |url=http://uk.playstation.com/psvitasystem/#select-tab-specifications |title=Official PlayStation website: PlayStation Vita, PS Vita; Specifications for PlayStationVita |accessdate=7 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107200613/http://uk.playstation.com/psvitasystem/#select-tab-specifications |archive-date=7 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe PlayStation does not produce a proper signal on several older models of televisions (due to an engineering oversight) causing the display to flicker or bounce around the screen.

This served as copy protection as well as region-locking.\n\nThe installation of an unofficial modchip allowed the PlayStation to play [[CD-R]] copies of games. It also allowed the console to play games from any region, as the modchip could inject the data for any region into the system. Since there was a multitude of electronic parts on the market, by the end of the system's life cycle, anyone with minimal soldering experience could perform these modifications. This created a wave of games developed without official approval using [[Free software|free]], official tools, such as the [[Net Yaroze]], as well as unofficial tools, and the reproduction of original

If <math>M</math> is in <math>\\mathfrak{F}</math>, then each of direct summand of <math>M</math> is also in <math>\\mathfrak{F}</math>.}}\n\n''Proof'': Let ''N'' be a direct summand; i.e., <math>M = N \\oplus L</math>. Using the assumption, we write <math>M = \\bigoplus_{I \\in I} M_i</math> where each <math>M_i</math> is a countably generated submodule. For each subset <math>A \\subset I</math>, we write <math>M_A = \\bigoplus_{i \\in A} M_i, N_A =</math> the image of <math>M_A</math> under the projection <math>M \\to N \\hookrightarrow M</math> and <math>L_A</math> the same way. Now, consider the set of all triples (<math>J</math>, <math>B</math>, <math>C</math>) consisting of a subset <math>J \\subset I</math> and subsets <math>B, C \\subset \\mathfrak{F}</math> such that <math>M_J = N_J \\oplus L_J</math> and <math>N_J, L_J</math> are the direct sums of the modules in <math>B, C</math>. We give this set a partial ordering such that <math>(J, B, C) \\le (J', B', C')</math> if and only if <math>J \\subset J'</math>, <math>B \\subset B', C \\subset C'</math>. By [[Zorn's lemma]], the set contains a maximal element <math>(J, B, C)</math>. We shall show that <math>J = I</math>; i.e., <math>N = N_J = \\bigoplus_{N' \\in B} N' \\in \\mathfrak{F}</math>. Suppose otherwise. Then we can inductively construct a sequence of at most countable subsets <math>I_1 \\subset I_2 \\subset \\cdots \\subset I</math> such that <math>I_1 \\not\\subset J</math> and for each integer <math>n \\ge 1</math>,\n:<math>M_{I_n} \\subset N_{I_n} + L_{I_n} \\subset M_{I_{n+1}}</math>.\nLet <math>I' = \\bigcup_0^\\infty I_n</math> and <math>J' = J \\cup I'</math>. We claim:\n:<math>M_{J'} = N_{J'} \\oplus L_{J'}.</math>\nThe inclusion <math>\\subset</math> is trivial. Conversely, <math>N_{J'}</math> is the image of <math>N_J + L_J + M_{I'} \\subset N_J + M_{I'}</math> and so <math>N_{J'} \\subset M_{J'}</math>. The same is also true for <math>L_{J'}</math>. Hence,  the claim is valid.\n\nNow, <math>N_J</math> is a direct summand of <math>M</math> (since it is a summand of <math>M_J</math>, which is a summand of <math>M</math>); i.e., <math>N_J \\oplus M' = M</math> for some <math>M'</math>. Then, by modular law, <math>N_{J'} = N_J \\oplus (M' \\cap N_{J'})</math>. Set <math>\\widetilde{N_J} = M' \\cap N_{J'}</math>. Define <math>\\widetilde{L_J}</math> in the same way. Then, using the early claim, we have:\n:<math>M_{J'} = M_J \\oplus \\widetilde{N_J} \\oplus \\widetilde{L_J},</math>\nwhich implies that\n:<math>\\widetilde{N_J} \\oplus \\widetilde{L_J} \\simeq M_{J'} / M_J \\simeq M_{J' - J}</math>\nis countably generated as <math>J' - J \\subset I'</math>.

The assertion is then implied by the following claim:\n*Given an element <math>x \\in N</math>, there exists an <math>H \\in \\mathcal{G}</math> that contains ''x'' and is a direct summand of&nbsp;''N''.\nIndeed, assume the claim is valid. Then choose a sequence <math>x_1, x_2, \\dots</math> in ''N'' that is a generating set. Then using the claim, write <math>N = H_1 \\oplus N_1</math> where <math>x_1 \\in H_1 \\in \\mathcal{G}</math>. Then we write <math>x_2 = y + z</math> where <math>y \\in H_1, z \\in N_1</math>. We then decompose <math>N_1 = H_2 \\oplus N_2</math> with <math>z \\in H_2 \\in \\mathcal{G}</math>.

Hence, the proof reduces to proving the claim and the claim is a straightforward consequence of [[Azumaya's theorem]] (see the linked article for the argument). <math>\\square</math>\n\n''Proof of the theorem'': Let <math>N</math> be a projective module over a local ring. Then, by definition, it is a direct summand of some free module <math>F</math>. This <math>F</math> is in the family <math>\\mathfrak{F}</math> in Lemma 1; thus, <math>N</math> is a direct sum of countably generated submodules, each a direct summand of ''F'' and thus projective. Hence, without loss of generality, we can assume <math>N</math> is countably generated. Then Lemma 2 gives the theorem. <math>\\square</math>\n\n== Characterization of a local ring ==\nKaplansky's theorem can be stated in such a way to give a characterization of a local ring. A direct summand is said to be ''maximal'' if it has an indecomposable complement.\n\n{{math_theorem|math_statement=<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|Fuller|1992|loc=Exercise 26.3.}}</ref> Let ''R'' be a ring. Then the following are equivalent.\n# ''R'' is a local ring.\n# Every projective module over ''R'' is free and has an indecomposable decomposition <math>M = \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} M_i</math> such that for each maximal direct summand ''L'' of ''M'', there is a decomposition <math>M = \\Big(\\bigoplus_{j \\in J} M_j\\Big) \\bigoplus L</math> for some subset <math>J \\subset I</math>.}}\n\nThe implication <math>1. \\Rightarrow 2.</math> is exactly (usual) Kaplansky's theorem and Azumaya's theorem. The converse <math>2. \\Rightarrow 1.</math> follows from the following general fact, which is interested itself:\n\n*A ring ''R'' is local <math>\\Leftrightarrow</math> for each nonzero proper direct summand ''M'' of <math>R^2 = R \\times R</math>, either <math>R^2 = (0 \\times R) \\oplus M</math> or <math>R^2 = (R \\times 0) \\oplus M</math>.\n\n<math>(\\Rightarrow)</math> is by Azumaya's theorem as in the proof of <math>1. \\Rightarrow 2.</math>. Conversely, suppose <math>R^2</math> has the above property and that an element ''x'' in ''R'' is given. Consider the linear map <math>\\sigma:R^2 \\to R, \\, \\sigma(a, b) = a - b</math>. Set <math>y = x - 1</math>. Then <math>\\sigma(x, y) = 1</math>, which is to say <math>\\eta: R \\to R^2, a \\mapsto (ax, ay)</math> splits and the image <math>M</math> is a direct summand of <math>R^2</math>. It follows easily from that the assumption that either ''x'' or -''y'' is a unit element. <math>\\square</math>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Krull\u2013Schmidt category]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{citation  |author1=Anderson|first1=Frank W.   |author2=Fuller|first2=Kent R.  |title=Rings and categories of modules   |series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics]]   |volume=13   |edition=2   |publisher=Springer-Verlag  |place=New York   |year=1992   |pages=x+376   |isbn=0-387-97845-3  |mr=1245487 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-4418-9}}\n*H.

Now, consider the set of all triples (<math>J</math>, <math>B</math>, <math>C</math>) consisting of a subset <math>J \\subset I</math> and subsets <math>B, C \\subset \\mathfrak{F}</math> such that <math>M_J = N_J \\oplus L_J</math> and <math>N_J, L_J</math> are the direct sums of the modules in <math>B, C</math>. We give this set a partial ordering such that <math>(J, B, C) \\le (J', B', C')</math> if and only if <math>J \\subset J'</math>, <math>B \\subset B', C \\subset C'</math>. By [[Zorn's lemma]], the set contains a maximal element <math>(J, B, C)</math>. We shall show that <math>J = I</math>; i.e., <math>N = N_J = \\bigoplus_{N' \\in B} N' \\in \\mathfrak{F}</math>. Suppose otherwise. Then we can inductively construct a sequence of at most countable subsets <math>I_1 \\subset I_2 \\subset \\cdots \\subset I</math> such that <math>I_1 \\not\\subset J</math> and for each integer <math>n \\ge 1</math>,\n:<math>M_{I_n} \\subset N_{I_n} + L_{I_n} \\subset M_{I_{n+1}}</math>.\nLet <math>I' = \\bigcup_0^\\infty I_n</math> and <math>J' = J \\cup I'</math>. We claim:\n:<math>M_{J'} = N_{J'} \\oplus L_{J'}.</math>\nThe inclusion <math>\\subset</math> is trivial. Conversely, <math>N_{J'}</math> is the image of <math>N_J + L_J + M_{I'} \\subset N_J + M_{I'}</math> and so <math>N_{J'} \\subset M_{J'}</math>. The same is also true for <math>L_{J'}</math>. Hence,  the claim is valid.\n\nNow, <math>N_J</math> is a direct summand of <math>M</math> (since it is a summand of <math>M_J</math>, which is a summand of <math>M</math>); i.e., <math>N_J \\oplus M' = M</math> for some <math>M'</math>. Then, by modular law, <math>N_{J'} = N_J \\oplus (M' \\cap N_{J'})</math>. Set <math>\\widetilde{N_J} = M' \\cap N_{J'}</math>. Define <math>\\widetilde{L_J}</math> in the same way. Then, using the early claim, we have:\n:<math>M_{J'} = M_J \\oplus \\widetilde{N_J} \\oplus \\widetilde{L_J},</math>\nwhich implies that\n:<math>\\widetilde{N_J} \\oplus \\widetilde{L_J} \\simeq M_{J'} / M_J \\simeq M_{J' - J}</math>\nis countably generated as <math>J' - J \\subset I'</math>. This contradicts the maximality of <math>(J, B, C)</math>. <math>\\square</math>\n\n{{math_theorem|name=Lemma 2|math_statement=If <math>M_i, i \\in I</math> are countably generated modules with local endomorphism rings and if <math>N</math> is a countably generated module that is a direct summand of <math>\\bigoplus_{i \\in I} M_i</math>, then <math>N</math> is isomorphic to <math>\\bigoplus_{i \\in I'} M_i</math> for some at most countable subset <math>I' \\subset I</math>.}}\n\n''Proof'':<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|Fuller|1992|loc=Proof of Theorem 26.5.}}</ref> Let <math>\\mathcal{G}</math> denote the family of modules that are isomorphic to modules of the form <math>\\bigoplus_{i \\in F} M_i</math> for some finite subset <math>F \\subset I</math>. The assertion is then implied by the following claim:\n*Given an element <math>x \\in N</math>, there exists an <math>H \\in \\mathcal{G}</math> that contains ''x'' and is a direct summand of&nbsp;''N''.\nIndeed, assume the claim is valid. Then choose a sequence <math>x_1, x_2, \\dots</math> in ''N'' that is a generating set. Then using the claim, write <math>N = H_1 \\oplus N_1</math> where <math>x_1 \\in H_1 \\in \\mathcal{G}</math>. Then we write <math>x_2 = y + z</math> where <math>y \\in H_1, z \\in N_1</math>. We then decompose <math>N_1 = H_2 \\oplus N_2</math> with <math>z \\in H_2 \\in \\mathcal{G}</math>. Note <math>\\{ x_1, x_2 \\} \\subset H_1 \\oplus H_2</math>. Repeating this argument, in the end, we have: <math display=\"inline\"> \\{ x_1, x_2, \\dots \\} \\subset \\bigoplus_0^\\infty H_n</math>; i.e., <math display=\"inline\">N = \\bigoplus_0^\\infty H_n</math>. Hence, the proof reduces to proving the claim and the claim is a straightforward consequence of [[Azumaya's theorem]] (see the linked article for the argument). <math>\\square</math>\n\n''Proof of the theorem'': Let <math>N</math> be a projective module over a local ring. Then, by definition, it is a direct summand of some free module <math>F</math>. This <math>F</math> is in the family <math>\\mathfrak{F}</math> in Lemma 1; thus, <math>N</math> is a direct sum of countably generated submodules, each a direct summand of ''F'' and thus projective. Hence, without loss of generality, we can assume <math>N</math> is countably generated. Then Lemma 2 gives the theorem. <math>\\square</math>\n\n== Characterization of a local ring ==\nKaplansky's theorem can be stated in such a way to give a characterization of a local ring. A direct summand is said to be ''maximal'' if it has an indecomposable complement.\n\n{{math_theorem|math_statement=<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|Fuller|1992|loc=Exercise 26.3.}}</ref> Let ''R'' be a ring. Then the following are equivalent.\n# ''R'' is a local ring.\n# Every projective module over ''R'' is free and has an indecomposable decomposition <math>M = \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} M_i</math> such that for each maximal direct summand ''L'' of ''M'', there is a decomposition <math>M = \\Big(\\bigoplus_{j \\in J} M_j\\Big) \\bigoplus L</math> for some subset <math>J \\subset I</math>.}}\n\nThe implication <math>1. \\Rightarrow 2.</math> is exactly (usual) Kaplansky's theorem and Azumaya's theorem. The converse <math>2. \\Rightarrow 1.</math> follows from the following general fact, which is interested itself:\n\n*A ring ''R'' is local <math>\\Leftrightarrow</math> for each nonzero proper direct summand ''M'' of <math>R^2 = R \\times R</math>, either <math>R^2 = (0 \\times R) \\oplus M</math> or <math>R^2 = (R \\times 0) \\oplus M</math>.\n\n<math>(\\Rightarrow)</math> is by Azumaya's theorem as in the proof of <math>1. \\Rightarrow 2.</math>. Conversely, suppose <math>R^2</math> has the above property and that an element ''x'' in ''R'' is given. Consider the linear map <math>\\sigma:R^2 \\to R, \\, \\sigma(a, b) = a - b</math>. Set <math>y = x - 1</math>. Then <math>\\sigma(x, y) = 1</math>, which is to say <math>\\eta: R \\to R^2, a \\mapsto (ax, ay)</math> splits and the image <math>M</math> is a direct summand of <math>R^2</math>. It follows easily from that the assumption that either ''x'' or -''y'' is a unit element. <math>\\square</math>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Krull\u2013Schmidt category]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading==\n*{{citation  |author1=Anderson|first1=Frank W.   |author2=Fuller|first2=Kent R.  |title=Rings and categories of modules   |series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics]]   |volume=13   |edition=2   |publisher=Springer-Verlag  |place=New York   |year=1992   |pages=x+376   |isbn=0-387-97845-3  |mr=1245487 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-4418-9}}\n*H.

The soundtrack was produced in collaboration with [[Hans Zimmer]] and [[Remote Control Productions (American company)|Remote Control Productions]], and was released on April 29, 2008, by [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lions Gate Records]].\n\nDjawadi joined the film after [[John Debney]], who previously collaborated with director [[Jon Favreau]], was unavailable. The score focuses heavily on electric guitar, as requested by Favreau, and was recorded with a rock band as well a traditional orchestra. The soundtrack also includes the classic 1966 [[Iron Man]] theme song, and a [[big band]]-style [[arrangement]] of it by John O'Brien and [[Rick Boston]], who also frequently collaborate with Favreau.\n\nThe soundtrack was negatively received by critics, especially the score's use of electric guitar and Remote Control influences. However, the inclusion of the classic theme, in its original and modern cover forms, was received positively, and the soundtrack was ultimately nominated at the [[51st Annual Grammy Awards|51st Grammy Awards]]. The initial response might have been because Djawadi was relatively unknown at the time of its release. Over the years, the score found acclaim with music fans. \n\n==Background==\n{{further|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\nAfter ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' director [[Jon Favreau]]'s previous collaborator [[John Debney]] was unavailable to score the film,<ref name=\"DebneyIM1\" /> [[Iron Man]] fan [[Ramin Djawadi]] sought out the role.<ref name=\"DjawadiComicus\" /> Filming on ''Iron Man'' had already been completed by the time Djawadi joined the production,<ref name=\"DjawadiDoG\" /> and rather than wait until he could see the completed film, as he usually would, Djawadi began \"playing with ideas\" as soon as he saw the first trailer.<ref name=\"DjawadiComicus\" /> Due to time constraints and the final cut of the film changing until \"the last possible minute\", Djawadi had help with arrangements and additional cues from [[Hans Zimmer]] and [[Remote Control Productions (American company)|Remote Control Productions]].<ref name=\"DjawadiComicus\" />\n\nFavreau requested Djawadi's score be more guitar and rock focused, with Djawadi's history playing guitar helping with this. Guitarist Aaron Kaplan performed most of the guitar for the score,<ref name=\"Recording\" /> with [[Rage Against the Machine]] guitarist [[Tom Morello]], who makes a [[cameo appearance]] in the film, also contributing guitar performances.<ref name=\"Morello\" /> The rock band Djawadi used was recorded at Remote Control, while recording of a full orchestra took place at [[AIR Studios]]. The final score was mixed at Remote Control.<ref name=\"Recording\" />\n\nMusicians John O'Brien and [[Rick Boston]], frequent collaborators with Favreau, provided a [[big band]]-style [[arrangement]] of the Iron Man theme song from the 1966 cartoon ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]''.<ref name=\"O'BrienBostonIM\" /> \"[[Institutionalized (song)|Institutionalized]]\", a song from band [[Suicidal Tendencies]] whose lead vocalist [[Mike Muir]] went to school with ''Iron Man'' star [[Robert Downey, Jr.]], is also included on the soundtrack.

Though he stated that there is \"nothing inherently wrong\" with an electric guitar-focused score, but Djawadi \"is not yet ready to provide [the] level of intrigue\" that other composers such as Debney and [[Danny Elfman]] were able to with the instrument. Clemmenson also questioned Djawadi's use of an orchestra, feeling that it gets \"washed away in the mix so thoroughly that the rock band and a set of keyboards is all that was truly required for this music\"<ref name=\"Filmtracks\" /> Jonathon Broxton at Movie Music UK said that Djawadi's approach \"seems to have been to appeal to the lowest of common denominators with driving rock rhythms, pseudo-heroic crescendos, and increasingly accelerating tempos. It\u2019s the ultimate musical overkill \u2013 loud, fast, brash, devoid of any kind of depth, and failing entirely to comment on any nuances which may exist in the film\". Broxton said, \"it\u2019s not even good rock music ... the guitars do little more than repeat themselves over and over again, and the synth overdubs simply add another layer of aural sludge.\"<ref name=\"MovieMusicUK\" />\n\nMovie Wave's James Southall gave the soundtrack no stars, calling it \"yet another phoned-in score\" from Remote Control, \"completely puerile garbage, as bad as film music gets\".<ref name=\"MovieWave\" /> Conversely, Christopher Coleman, writing for Tracksounds, gave the score a six out of ten, saying, \"as much as I had prepared myself to dislike this score...as much as I thought I'd be among the throngs of haters...and as much as I long for classically-styled scores for superhero films, ''Iron Man'' has won me over.\" He felt that fans of the Remote Control style would find the score an \"industrially-clever diversion\", but for others it would only give \"more fuel for your personal, [Remote Control]-bond-fires\". He felt that the release \"captures the most of the significant cues\", but suffers from the inclusion of Suicidal Tendencies' \"Institutionalized\". Coleman concluded by saying that \"a traditional, all-symphonic score would not have worked better for this film\".<ref name=\"Tracksounds\" /> [[Allmusic]] gave the release three stars out of five, with reviewer James Christopher Monger saying that Djawadi \"treats the superhero with a predictably heavy hand\", and imbues the film with \"enough bombast to fuel two sequels\".<ref name=\"Allmusic\" />\n\nMany critics praised the inclusion of both the Urbont's classic 1966 Iron Man theme song and the modern cover of it, with Coleman calling it \"one of the best surprises of the movie and score\",<ref name=\"Tracksounds\" /> and Broxton highlighting the cover as \"a wonderful piece of feelgood jazz\".<ref name=\"MovieMusicUK\" /> Clemmenson lamented the theme not being integrated into Djawadi's music, feeling that it is \"so diametrically opposed to the Remote Control handbook for simplistic progressions that it's disappointing that Djawadi didn't take a stab at coherently interpolating it into the new work.\"<ref name=\"Filmtracks\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" |

2008 film ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', featuring music composed by [[Ramin Djawadi]]. The soundtrack was produced in collaboration with [[Hans Zimmer]] and [[Remote Control Productions (American company)|Remote Control Productions]], and was released on April 29, 2008, by [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lions Gate Records]].\n\nDjawadi joined the film after [[John Debney]], who previously collaborated with director [[Jon Favreau]], was unavailable. The score focuses heavily on electric guitar, as requested by Favreau, and was recorded with a rock band as well a traditional orchestra. The soundtrack also includes the classic 1966 [[Iron Man]] theme song, and a [[big band]]-style [[arrangement]] of it by John O'Brien and [[Rick Boston]], who also frequently collaborate with Favreau.\n\nThe soundtrack was negatively received by critics, especially the score's use of electric guitar and Remote Control influences. However, the inclusion of the classic theme, in its original and modern cover forms, was received positively, and the soundtrack was ultimately nominated at the [[51st Annual Grammy Awards|51st Grammy Awards]]. The initial response might have been because Djawadi was relatively unknown at the time of its release. Over the years, the score found acclaim with music fans. \n\n==Background==\n{{further|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\nAfter ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' director [[Jon Favreau]]'s previous collaborator [[John Debney]] was unavailable to score the film,<ref name=\"DebneyIM1\" /> [[Iron Man]] fan [[Ramin Djawadi]] sought out the role.<ref name=\"DjawadiComicus\" /> Filming on ''Iron Man'' had already been completed by the time Djawadi joined the production,<ref name=\"DjawadiDoG\" /> and rather than wait until he could see the completed film, as he usually would, Djawadi began \"playing with ideas\" as soon as he saw the first trailer.<ref name=\"DjawadiComicus\" /> Due to time constraints and the final cut of the film changing until \"the last possible minute\", Djawadi had help with arrangements and additional cues from [[Hans Zimmer]] and [[Remote Control Productions (American company)|Remote Control Productions]].<ref name=\"DjawadiComicus\" />\n\nFavreau requested Djawadi's score be more guitar and rock focused, with Djawadi's history playing guitar helping with this. Guitarist Aaron Kaplan performed most of the guitar for the score,<ref name=\"Recording\" /> with [[Rage Against the Machine]] guitarist [[Tom Morello]], who makes a [[cameo appearance]] in the film, also contributing guitar performances.<ref name=\"Morello\" /> The rock band Djawadi used was recorded at Remote Control, while recording of a full orchestra took place at [[AIR Studios]]. The final score was mixed at Remote Control.<ref name=\"Recording\" />\n\nMusicians John O'Brien and [[Rick Boston]], frequent collaborators with Favreau, provided a [[big band]]-style [[arrangement]] of the Iron Man theme song from the 1966 cartoon ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]''.<ref name=\"O'BrienBostonIM\" /> \"[[Institutionalized (song)|Institutionalized]]\", a song from band [[Suicidal Tendencies]] whose lead vocalist [[Mike Muir]] went to school with ''Iron Man'' star [[Robert Downey, Jr.]], is also included on the soundtrack. Djawaldi performed a piano rendition of [[Antonio Salieri]]'s \"Concerto in Do Maggiroe Per Pianoforte eo Orchestra: Larghetto\" which was used exclusively for the film, and as such was not included in the soundtrack.<ref name=\"Institutionalized\" />\n\n==Track listing==\nAll music by Ramin Djawadi, except where noted.<ref name=\"DjawadiComicus\" />\n\n{{tracklist\n|collapsed       = \n|headline        = \n|title1          = Driving with the Top Down\n|length1         = 3:10\n|title2          = Iron Man \n|note2           = 2008 version\n|music2           = John O'Brien and [[Rick Boston]]\n|length2         = 1:05\n|title3          = Merchant of Death\n|length3         = 2:14\n|title4          = Trinkets to Kill a Prince\n|length4         = 3:07\n|title5          = Mark I\n|length5         = 3:53\n|title6          = Fireman\n|length6         = 2:09\n|title7          = Vacation's Over\n|length7         = 3:34\n|title8          = Golden Egg\n|length8         = 4:12\n|title9          = Damn Kid\n|music9           = DJ Boborobo\n|length9         = 1:12\n|title10         = Mark II\n|length10        = 2:47\n|title11         = Extra Dry, Extra Olives\n|length11        = 1:43\n|title12         = Iron Man\n|length12        = 3:30\n|title13         = Gulmira\n|length13        = 4:05\n|title14         = Are Those Bullet Holes?\n|length14        = 2:00\n|title15         = Section 16\n|length15        = 2:33\n|title16         = Iron Monger\n|length16        = 4:45\n|title17         = Arc Reaktor\n|length17        = 3:55\n|title18         = [[Institutionalized (song)|Institutionalized]]\n|length18        = 3:49\n|music18          = [[Suicidal Tendencies]]\n|title19         = Iron Man \n|note19         = 1966 version\n|length19        = 0:20\n|music19          = [[Jacques Urbont|Jack Urbont]] \n}}\n\n==Release==\nThe soundtrack was released by [[Lions Gate Entertainment|Lions Gate Records]], who had a licensing deal with [[Marvel Entertainment]],<ref name=\"LionsgateMarvel\" /> on April 29, 2008.<ref name=\"release\" />\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nChristian Clemmenson of [[Filmtracks.com]] was extremely critical of the Remote Control influences on the soundtrack, negatively comparing it to [[Steve Jablonsky]]'s ''[[Transformers: The Score|Transformers]]'' and scoring it one star out of five. Though he stated that there is \"nothing inherently wrong\" with an electric guitar-focused score, but Djawadi \"is not yet ready to provide [the] level of intrigue\" that other composers such as Debney and [[Danny Elfman]] were able to with the instrument. Clemmenson also questioned Djawadi's use of an orchestra, feeling that it gets \"washed away in the mix so thoroughly that the rock band and a set of keyboards is all that was truly required for this music\"<ref name=\"Filmtracks\" /> Jonathon Broxton at Movie Music UK said that Djawadi's approach \"seems to have been to appeal to the lowest of common denominators with driving rock rhythms, pseudo-heroic crescendos, and increasingly accelerating tempos. It\u2019s the ultimate musical overkill \u2013 loud, fast, brash, devoid of any kind of depth, and failing entirely to comment on any nuances which may exist in the film\". Broxton said, \"it\u2019s not even good rock music ... the guitars do little more than repeat themselves over and over again, and the synth overdubs simply add another layer of aural sludge.\"<ref name=\"MovieMusicUK\" />\n\nMovie Wave's James Southall gave the soundtrack no stars, calling it \"yet another phoned-in score\" from Remote Control, \"completely puerile garbage, as bad as film music gets\".<ref name=\"MovieWave\" /> Conversely, Christopher Coleman, writing for Tracksounds, gave the score a six out of ten, saying, \"as much as I had prepared myself to dislike this score...as much as I thought I'd be among the throngs of haters...and as much as I long for classically-styled scores for superhero films, ''Iron Man'' has won me over.\" He felt that fans of the Remote Control style would find the score an \"industrially-clever diversion\", but for others it would only give \"more fuel for your personal, [Remote Control]-bond-fires\". He felt that the release \"captures the most of the significant cues\", but suffers from the inclusion of Suicidal Tendencies' \"Institutionalized\". Coleman concluded by saying that \"a traditional, all-symphonic score would not have worked better for this film\".<ref name=\"Tracksounds\" /> [[Allmusic]] gave the release three stars out of five, with reviewer James Christopher Monger saying that Djawadi \"treats the superhero with a predictably heavy hand\", and imbues the film with \"enough bombast to fuel two sequels\".<ref name=\"Allmusic\" />\n\nMany critics praised the inclusion of both the Urbont's classic 1966 Iron Man theme song and the modern cover of it, with Coleman calling it \"one of the best surprises of the movie and score\",<ref name=\"Tracksounds\" /> and Broxton highlighting the cover as \"a wonderful piece of feelgood jazz\".<ref name=\"MovieMusicUK\" /> Clemmenson lamented the theme not being integrated into Djawadi's music, feeling that it is \"so diametrically opposed to the Remote Control handbook for simplistic progressions that it's disappointing that Djawadi didn't take a stab at coherently interpolating it into the new work.\"<ref name=\"Filmtracks\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" |

After state militia were used to suppress a massive [[Knights of Labor]] strike involving 10,000 workers in four parishes, many African Americans retreated to Thibodaux. Local paramilitary forces attacked the men and their families, killing an estimated 50 persons, and hundreds more were missing, wounded, and presumed dead in one of the deadliest incidents of labor suppression and racial terrorism.\n\nLafourche Parish is part of the [[Houma, Louisiana|Houma]]-Thibodaux, LA [[Houma \u2013 Bayou Cane \u2013 Thibodaux metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. People of the state-recognized Native American [[Houma Tribe]] live in both Lafourche and Terrebonne parishes.\n\n==History==\nSouth Louisiana became known as Sugarland, and Lafourche one of the sugar parishes, where sugar cane plantations were established before and after the Civil War. They required the labor of large numbers of enslaved African Americans. In the postbellum era, they comprised from 50 to 80 percent of the population in most of the sugar parishes.<ref name=\"pfiefer\">[ Michael James Pfeifer, ''Rough Justice: Lynching and American Society, 1874-1947''], University of Illinois Press, 2004, pp. 75-77</ref>\n\nParticularly after Reconstruction, whites in the parish used violence and intimidation against the large population of [[freedmen]] to suppress Republican voting and re-establish [[white supremacy]], but were less successful than in North Louisiana until after disenfranchisement of blacks at the turn of the century.<ref name=\"pfiefer\"/> From 1877 through the early 20th century, there were 52 [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings of African Americans]] in Lafourche Parish. Most of the deaths were due to white suppression of labor unrest in 1887; blacks were skilled sugar workers and had begun to organize for better wages and conditions.<ref name=\"pfiefer\"/> Some 10,000 workers had struck in Lafourche and three other parishes during the critical harvest period. At the request of the planters, the state sent in militia against the workers to break the strike.\n\nIn what was called the [[Thibodaux Massacre]] of November 22, 1887, local whites organized by leaders of the town killed up to 50 blacks who had taken refuge in the African-American quarters after a major [[Knights of Labor]] strike was called on sugar plantations.

After state militia were used to suppress a massive [[Knights of Labor]] strike involving 10,000 workers in four parishes, many African Americans retreated to Thibodaux. Local paramilitary forces attacked the men and their families, killing an estimated 50 persons, and hundreds more were missing, wounded, and presumed dead in one of the deadliest incidents of labor suppression and racial terrorism.\n\nLafourche Parish is part of the [[Houma, Louisiana|Houma]]-Thibodaux, LA [[Houma \u2013 Bayou Cane \u2013 Thibodaux metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. People of the state-recognized Native American [[Houma Tribe]] live in both Lafourche and Terrebonne parishes.\n\n==History==\nSouth Louisiana became known as Sugarland, and Lafourche one of the sugar parishes, where sugar cane plantations were established before and after the Civil War. They required the labor of large numbers of enslaved African Americans. In the postbellum era, they comprised from 50 to 80 percent of the population in most of the sugar parishes.<ref name=\"pfiefer\">[ Michael James Pfeifer, ''Rough Justice: Lynching and American Society, 1874-1947''], University of Illinois Press, 2004, pp. 75-77</ref>\n\nParticularly after Reconstruction, whites in the parish used violence and intimidation against the large population of [[freedmen]] to suppress Republican voting and re-establish [[white supremacy]], but were less successful than in North Louisiana until after disenfranchisement of blacks at the turn of the century.<ref name=\"pfiefer\"/> From 1877 through the early 20th century, there were 52 [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings of African Americans]] in Lafourche Parish. Most of the deaths were due to white suppression of labor unrest in 1887; blacks were skilled sugar workers and had begun to organize for better wages and conditions.<ref name=\"pfiefer\"/> Some 10,000 workers had struck in Lafourche and three other parishes during the critical harvest period. At the request of the planters, the state sent in militia against the workers to break the strike.\n\nIn what was called the [[Thibodaux Massacre]] of November 22, 1887, local whites organized by leaders of the town killed up to 50 blacks who had taken refuge in the African-American quarters after a major [[Knights of Labor]] strike was called on sugar plantations.

But I feel like the soundtrack in the second one is better.\"<ref name=\"SoundtrackFeelings\" /> In June 2015, Gunn stated that all of the songs for ''Awesome Mix Vol. 2'' had been chosen and built into the script.<ref name=\"ScreenRantJune2015\" /> One of the most exciting things for Gunn in selecting the songs for the album \"was knowing I would be making bands that may have been forgotten suddenly be a topic of conversation.\"<ref name=\"AwesomeMixVol2ReleaseDate\" /> Gunn had hoped to include \"[[She's Gone (Hall & Oates song)|She's Gone]]\" by [[Hall & Oates]] in the film, calling it \"one of the greatest pop songs ever written\", but could not find a place for it,<ref name=\"ShesGone\" /> as with \"[[Teenage Lament '74]]\" by [[Alice Cooper]] <ref name=\"TeenageLament\" /> In January 2016, Gunn stated that he had chosen an additional Bowie song to appear in the film (after \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" was featured in the first film) but had cut the original scene it was featured in. The inclusion would have made Bowie the only artist to be featured on both mixtapes. With Bowie's death however, Gunn hoped to find a way to include the chosen song somewhere else in the film as a \"fair and appropriate\" way to honor him, as Bowie was one of Gunn's idols.<ref name=\"Bowie\" /> Gunn called the ''Awesome Mix Vol. 2'' \"more diverse\" than the first one, with \"some really incredibly famous songs and then some songs that people have never heard.\"<ref name=\"GunnSoundtrackDec2016\" />\n\nThe film's trailers featured [[The Sweet|Sweet]]'s \"[[Fox on the Run (Sweet song)|Fox on the Run]]\",<ref name=\"THRFirstTrailer\" /> [[George Harrison]]'s \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\", [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s \"[[The Chain]]\", [[Jay and the Americans]]' \"[[Come a Little Bit Closer]]\",<ref name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017Pg2\" /> Bowie's \"[[Suffragette City]]\",<ref name=\"TVSpot1\" /> and [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]]'s \"[[Flash Light (song)|Flash Light]]\",<ref name=\"FlashLight\" /> which Gunn noted were all being considered for inclusion on the ''Awesome Mix Vol. 2''.<ref name=\"GunnTrailerSongs\" /> \"Fox on the Run\" and [[Cheap Trick]]'s \"[[Surrender (Cheap Trick song)|Surrender]]\" had been considered for inclusion in the first film on ''Awesome Mix Vol. 1''.<ref name=\"FoxOnTheRunSurrenderAwesomeMixVol1\" />\n\n\"[[Mr. Blue Sky]]\" by [[Electric Light Orchestra]] (ELO) is included in the beginning of the film, which Gunn felt was \"the perfect song to start the movie because it's really joyous, but there's a really dark underpinning to it,\" and felt it would go well with \"the most hugely insane shot I've ever done\".<ref name=\"AwesomeMixVol2ReleaseDate\" /> The sequence originally included the ELO song \"[[Livin' Thing]]\".<ref name=\"OriginalOpeningSong\" /> Acquiring the rights to \"Mr. Blue Sky\" proved difficult for Gunn, noting Marvel \"had to really fight to get the song, and I personally appealed to [[Jeff Lynne]],\" which was made harder due to Lynne previously approving a song for the first film which ended up being cut. Gunn added that \"The Chain\" and \"[[Brandy (You're a Fine Girl)]]\" were the two songs that were \"the most deeply embedded into the fibers of the film.\"<ref name=\"AwesomeMixVol2ReleaseDate\" /> [[Looking Glass (band)|Looking Glass]] lead guitarist and vocalist [[Elliot Lurie]] felt the inclusion of \"Brandy (You're a Fine Girl)\" in the film allowed for a deeper meaning to be explored from the song, noting \"maybe, in retrospect, subconsciously [the song] was a metaphor. [The film] is certainly the use that has shined the brightest light on the song since it was originally a hit.\"<ref name=\"BrandyTHR\" />\n\nSkip Haynes, the last surviving member of [[Aliotta Haynes Jeremiah]], \"was so thrilled\" that \"[[Lake Shore Drive (song)|Lake Shore Drive]]\", a regional hit in the Midwest where Gunn grew up, was included and \"rescued from historical oblivion\", that he \"recorded a new version incorporating the director's name into the chorus.\"<ref name=\"LATimes\" /> \"Guardians Inferno\" is an original song for the film, co-written by Gunn and score composer [[Tyler Bates]], \"meant as a sort of ''Guardians'' take on [[Meco]]'s disco ''[[Star Wars]]'' theme [\"[[Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band]]\"].\"<ref name=\"AwesomeMixVol2ReleaseDate\" /> [[David Hasselhoff]] was chosen as the vocalist because he is one of [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Quill]]'s childhood heroes, and Gunn was a fan of Hasselhoff when he starred on ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]''.<ref name=\"AwesomeMixVol2ReleaseDate\" /><ref name=\"HasselhoffET\" /> [[Edgar Wright]], director of ''[[Baby Driver]]'', consulted with Gunn before ''Vol. 2'' released, to ensure the two films would not feature the same songs on their soundtracks.<ref name=\"WrightBabyDriver\" />\n\n''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2: Awesome Mix Volume 2 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)'' was released by Hollywood Records on April 21, 2017.<ref name=\"AwesomeMixVol2ReleaseDate\" /> It was released on cassette on June 23, 2017 and on vinyl LP on August 11, 2017. The vinyl version is a deluxe edition featuring Bates' original score from the film.<ref name=\"CassetteRelease\" /> Marvel and [[Doritos]] partnered for their Rock Out Loud campaign to create \"a custom-designed, limited-edition series of Doritos bags featuring a built-in cassette tape deck-inspired player that plays\" ''Awesome Mix Vol. 2'' and can be recharged. The custom bags were available to purchase on April 28, 2017 on [[Amazon.com]]. In addition, on May 5, 2017, Doritos hosted Rock Out Loud pop-up recording booths in New York and Los Angeles, where fans got the chance to sing one of the songs from ''Awesome Mix Vol. 2'' and \"have the opportunity to win various prizes, including the custom cassette player replica Doritos bags, concert and other event tickets, and free bags of Doritos.\"<ref name=\"DoritosBag\" />\n\nOn August 6, 2017, Marvel released the music video of \"Guardians Inferno\" to promote the home media release of the film. The 1970s-style video was directed by David Yarovesky, and features Hasselhoff alongside James Gunn, [[Chris Pratt]], [[Zoe Saldana]], [[Dave Bautista]], [[Pom Klementieff]], [[Karen Gillan]], [[Michael Rooker]] and [[Sean Gunn]]. [[Stan Lee]] and [[Guillermo Rodriguez (Jimmy Kimmel Live!)|Guillermo Rodriguez]] also make cameo appearances on the video.<ref name=\"InfernoVideo\" /><ref name=\"InfernoVideo2\" />\n\n===Track listing===\nAll songs\u2014with the exception of \"Fox on the Run\", which is played in the trailer\u2014are featured in the film.<ref name=\"AwesomeMixVol2ReleaseDate\" /> Also featured in the film was the song \"Un Deye Gon Hayd (The Unloved Song)\" by [[Jimmy Urine]].

A separate [[film score]] album, '''''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (Original Score)''''', composed by [[Tyler Bates]], was also released by Hollywood Records on the same date.

But I feel like the soundtrack in the second one is better.\"<ref name=\"SoundtrackFeelings\" /> In June 2015, Gunn stated that all of the songs for ''Awesome Mix Vol. 2'' had been chosen and built into the script.<ref name=\"ScreenRantJune2015\" /> One of the most exciting things for Gunn in selecting the songs for the album \"was knowing I would be making bands that may have been forgotten suddenly be a topic of conversation.\"<ref name=\"AwesomeMixVol2ReleaseDate\" /> Gunn had hoped to include \"[[She's Gone (Hall & Oates song)|She's Gone]]\" by [[Hall & Oates]] in the film, calling it \"one of the greatest pop songs ever written\", but could not find a place for it,<ref name=\"ShesGone\" /> as with \"[[Teenage Lament '74]]\" by [[Alice Cooper]] <ref name=\"TeenageLament\" /> In January 2016, Gunn stated that he had chosen an additional Bowie song to appear in the film (after \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" was featured in the first film) but had cut the original scene it was featured in. The inclusion would have made Bowie the only artist to be featured on both mixtapes. With Bowie's death however, Gunn hoped to find a way to include the chosen song somewhere else in the film as a \"fair and appropriate\" way to honor him, as Bowie was one of Gunn's idols.<ref name=\"Bowie\" /> Gunn called the ''Awesome Mix Vol. 2'' \"more diverse\" than the first one, with \"some really incredibly famous songs and then some songs that people have never heard.\"<ref name=\"GunnSoundtrackDec2016\" />\n\nThe film's trailers featured [[The Sweet|Sweet]]'s \"[[Fox on the Run (Sweet song)|Fox on the Run]]\",<ref name=\"THRFirstTrailer\" /> [[George Harrison]]'s \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\", [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s \"[[The Chain]]\", [[Jay and the Americans]]' \"[[Come a Little Bit Closer]]\",<ref name=\"SlashFilmFeb2017Pg2\" /> Bowie's \"[[Suffragette City]]\",<ref name=\"TVSpot1\" /> and [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]]'s \"[[Flash Light (song)|Flash Light]]\",<ref name=\"FlashLight\" /> which Gunn noted were all being considered for inclusion on the ''Awesome Mix Vol. 2''.<ref name=\"GunnTrailerSongs\" /> \"Fox on the Run\" and [[Cheap Trick]]'s \"[[Surrender (Cheap Trick song)|Surrender]]\" had been considered for inclusion in the first film on ''Awesome Mix Vol. 1''.<ref name=\"FoxOnTheRunSurrenderAwesomeMixVol1\" />\n\n\"[[Mr. Blue Sky]]\" by [[Electric Light Orchestra]] (ELO) is included in the beginning of the film, which Gunn felt was \"the perfect song to start the movie because it's really joyous, but there's a really dark underpinning to it,\" and felt it would go well with \"the most hugely insane shot I've ever done\".<ref name=\"AwesomeMixVol2ReleaseDate\" /> The sequence originally included the ELO song \"[[Livin' Thing]]\".<ref name=\"OriginalOpeningSong\" /> Acquiring the rights to \"Mr. Blue Sky\" proved difficult for Gunn, noting Marvel \"had to really fight to get the song, and I personally appealed to [[Jeff Lynne]],\" which was made harder due to Lynne previously approving a song for the first film which ended up being cut. Gunn added that \"The Chain\" and \"[[Brandy (You're a Fine Girl)]]\" were the two songs that were \"the most deeply embedded into the fibers of the film.\"<ref name=\"AwesomeMixVol2ReleaseDate\" /> [[Looking Glass (band)|Looking Glass]] lead guitarist and vocalist [[Elliot Lurie]] felt the inclusion of \"Brandy (You're a Fine Girl)\" in the film allowed for a deeper meaning to be explored from the song, noting \"maybe, in retrospect, subconsciously [the song] was a metaphor. [The film] is certainly the use that has shined the brightest light on the song since it was originally a hit.\"<ref name=\"BrandyTHR\" />\n\nSkip Haynes, the last surviving member of [[Aliotta Haynes Jeremiah]], \"was so thrilled\" that \"[[Lake Shore Drive (song)|Lake Shore Drive]]\", a regional hit in the Midwest where Gunn grew up, was included and \"rescued from historical oblivion\", that he \"recorded a new version incorporating the director's name into the chorus.\"<ref name=\"LATimes\" /> \"Guardians Inferno\" is an original song for the film, co-written by Gunn and score composer [[Tyler Bates]], \"meant as a sort of ''Guardians'' take on [[Meco]]'s disco ''[[Star Wars]]'' theme [\"[[Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band]]\"].\"<ref name=\"AwesomeMixVol2ReleaseDate\" /> [[David Hasselhoff]] was chosen as the vocalist because he is one of [[Peter Quill (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Quill]]'s childhood heroes, and Gunn was a fan of Hasselhoff when he starred on ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]''.<ref name=\"AwesomeMixVol2ReleaseDate\" /><ref name=\"HasselhoffET\" /> [[Edgar Wright]], director of ''[[Baby Driver]]'', consulted with Gunn before ''Vol. 2'' released, to ensure the two films would not feature the same songs on their soundtracks.<ref name=\"WrightBabyDriver\" />\n\n''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2: Awesome Mix Volume 2 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)'' was released by Hollywood Records on April 21, 2017.<ref name=\"AwesomeMixVol2ReleaseDate\" /> It was released on cassette on June 23, 2017 and on vinyl LP on August 11, 2017. The vinyl version is a deluxe edition featuring Bates' original score from the film.<ref name=\"CassetteRelease\" /> Marvel and [[Doritos]] partnered for their Rock Out Loud campaign to create \"a custom-designed, limited-edition series of Doritos bags featuring a built-in cassette tape deck-inspired player that plays\" ''Awesome Mix Vol. 2'' and can be recharged. The custom bags were available to purchase on April 28, 2017 on [[Amazon.com]]. In addition, on May 5, 2017, Doritos hosted Rock Out Loud pop-up recording booths in New York and Los Angeles, where fans got the chance to sing one of the songs from ''Awesome Mix Vol. 2'' and \"have the opportunity to win various prizes, including the custom cassette player replica Doritos bags, concert and other event tickets, and free bags of Doritos.\"<ref name=\"DoritosBag\" />\n\nOn August 6, 2017, Marvel released the music video of \"Guardians Inferno\" to promote the home media release of the film. The 1970s-style video was directed by David Yarovesky, and features Hasselhoff alongside James Gunn, [[Chris Pratt]], [[Zoe Saldana]], [[Dave Bautista]], [[Pom Klementieff]], [[Karen Gillan]], [[Michael Rooker]] and [[Sean Gunn]]. [[Stan Lee]] and [[Guillermo Rodriguez (Jimmy Kimmel Live!)|Guillermo Rodriguez]] also make cameo appearances on the video.<ref name=\"InfernoVideo\" /><ref name=\"InfernoVideo2\" />\n\n===Track listing===\nAll songs\u2014with the exception of \"Fox on the Run\", which is played in the trailer\u2014are featured in the film.<ref name=\"AwesomeMixVol2ReleaseDate\" /> Also featured in the film was the song \"Un Deye Gon Hayd (The Unloved Song)\" by [[Jimmy Urine]].
