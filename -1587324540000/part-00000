Harmful compounds such as [[methane]], a greenhouse gas, and [[hydrogen sulfide]], a pungent, toxic compound, can be found in wastewater lagoons. PSB can help lower the concentration of both, and others.<ref>McGarvey, JA, et al. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2009.02683.x/epdf \"Induction of Purple Sulfur Bacterial Growth in Dairy Wastewater Lagoons by Circulation.\"'' Letters in Applied Microbiology'', vol. 49, no. 4, 2009, pp. 427-433.</ref>\n\nHarmful organic compounds can be removed through photoassimilation, the uptake of carbon by organisms through photosynthesis.<ref>\"Photoassimilation | Definition of photoassimilation in English by Oxford Dictionaries.\" https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/photoassimilation ''Oxford Dictionaries | English'', Oxford Dictionaries, en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/photoassimilation.</ref> When PSB in the lagoons perform photosynthesis they can utilize the carbon from harmful compounds, such as [[methane]],<ref>Leytem, AB, et al. https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0022030217305799/1-s2.0-S0022030217305799-main.pdf?_tid=a8cdccc8-cd79-11e7-8cad-00000aab0f6c&acdnat=1511130986_0d85d5d96ffb65e1ca976c83f8706f90 \"Methane Emissions from Dairy Lagoons in the Western United States.\"''Journal of Dairy Science'', vol. 100, no. 8, 2017, pp. 6785-6803.</ref> as their carbon source.

{"title_page": "Stimulus (physiology)", "text_new": "[[File:Phototrophic Response to Stimulus.svg|thumb|The light from the lamp (1.) functions as a detectable change in the plant's environment. As a result, the plant exhibits a reaction of phototropism--directional growth (2.) toward the light stimulus]]\nIn [[physiology]], a '''stimulus''' (plural '''stimuli''' or '''stimuluses''')<ref>[http://www.wordorigins.org/index.php/more/849/ Prescriptivist\u2019s Corner: Foreign Plurals]: \"Biologists use ''stimuli'', but ''stimuluses'' is in general use.\"</ref> is a detectable change in the physical or chemical structure of an organism's internal or external [[Environment (systems)|environment]]. The ability of an [[organism]] or [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] to respond to external stimuli is called sensitivity. When a stimulus is applied to a [[sensory receptor]], it normally elicits or influences a [[Reflex action|reflex]] via [[Transduction (physiology)|stimulus transduction]]. These sensory receptors can receive information from outside the body, as in touch receptors found in the skin or light receptors in the eye, as well as from inside the body, as in [[chemoreceptors]] and [[mechanoreceptors]]. An internal stimulus is often the first component of a [[Homeostasis|homeostatic control system]]. External stimuli are capable of producing systemic responses throughout the body, as in the [[fight-or-flight response]]. In order for a stimulus to be detected with high probability, its level must exceed the [[absolute threshold]]; if a signal does reach threshold, the information is transmitted to the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), where it is integrated and a decision on how to react is made. Although stimuli commonly cause the body to respond, it is the CNS that finally determines whether a signal causes a reaction or not.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Internal===\n\nCOTY LA PUTA QUE TE PARIO\n\n===External===\n\n====Touch and pain====\nSensory feelings, especially pain, are stimuli that can elicit a large response and cause neurological changes in the body. Pain also causes a behavioral change in the body, which is proportional to the intensity of the pain. The feeling is recorded by sensory receptors on the skin and travels to the [[central nervous system]], where it is integrated and a decision on how to respond is made; if it is decided that a response must be made, a signal is sent back down to a muscle, which acts appropriately according to the stimulus.<ref name = Craig /> The postcentral gyrus is the location of the [[primary somatosensory area]], the main sensory receptive area for the [[sense of touch]].<ref name = Purves>{{cite book |last=Purves |first=Dale |title=Neuroscience |publisher=Sinauer |edition=5th |year=2012 |location=Sunderland, MA |isbn=978-0-87893-695-3}}{{page needed|date=September 2013}}</ref>\n\nPain receptors are known as [[nociceptors]]. Two main types of [[nociceptors]] exist, A-fiber nociceptors and [[Group C nerve fiber|C-fiber]] nociceptors. [[Type Ia sensory fiber|A-fiber]] receptors are myelinated and conduct currents rapidly. They are mainly used to conduct fast and sharp types of pain. Conversely, C-fiber receptors are unmyelinated and slowly transmit. These receptors conduct slow, burning, diffuse pain.<ref name = Stucky>{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.211373398 |title=From the Academy: Mechanisms of pain |year=2001 |last1=Stucky |first1=C.

This amount of sensation has a definable value and is often considered to be the force exerted by dropping the wing of a bee onto your cheek from a distance of one centimeter. This value will change based on the body part being touched.<ref name = \"Gale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3406000012.html |title=Absolute Threshold |encyclopedia=Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology |year=2001 |accessdate=July 14, 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Vision====\nVision provides opportunity for the [[brain]] to perceive and respond to changes occurring around the body. Information, or stimuli, in the form of [[light]] enters the [[retina]], where it excites a special type of [[neuron]] called a [[photoreceptor cell]]. A local [[Receptor potential|graded potential]] begins in the photoreceptor, where it excites the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] enough for the impulse to be passed along through a track of neurons to the [[central nervous system]]. As the signal travels from photoreceptors to larger neurons, [[Action Potential|action potentials]] must be created for the signal to have enough strength to reach the CNS.<ref name = Nicholls /> If the stimulus does not warrant a strong enough response, it is said to not reach [[absolute threshold]], and the body does not react. However, if the stimulus is strong enough to create an action potential in neurons away from the photoreceptor, the body will integrate the information and react appropriately. Visual information is processed in the [[occipital lobe]] of the CNS, specifically in the [[Visual cortex|primary visual cortex]].<ref name = Nicholls />\n\nThe [[absolute threshold]] for vision is the minimum amount of sensation needed to elicit a response from [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] in the eye. This amount of sensation has a definable value and is often considered to be the amount of light present from someone holding up a single candle 30 miles away, if one's eyes were [[Adaptation (eye)|adjusted to the dark]].<ref name = Gale />\n\n====Smell====\n[[Olfaction|Smell]] allows the body to recognize chemical molecules in the air through inhalation. [[Olfaction|Olfactory]] [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] located on either side of the [[nasal septum]] consist of [[olfactory epithelium]] and [[lamina propria]]. The olfactory epithelium, which contains olfactory receptor cells, covers the inferior surface of the [[Cribriform plate|cribiform plate]], the superior portion of the perpendicular plate, the superior nasal concha. Only roughly two percent of airborne compounds inhaled are carried to olfactory organs as a small sample of the air being inhaled. Olfactory receptors extend past the epithelial surface providing a base for many cilia that lie in the surrounding mucus. Odorant-binding proteins interact with these [[Cilium|cilia]] stimulating the receptors. Odorants are generally small organic molecules. Greater water and lipid solubility is related directly to stronger smelling odorants. Odorant binding to G protein coupled receptors activates [[adenylate cyclase]], which converts [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to camp. [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]], in turn, promotes the opening of sodium channels resulting in a localized potential.<ref name = Martini>{{cite book |last1=Martini |first1=Frederic |first2=Judi |last2=Nath |title=Anatomy & Physiology |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |edition=2nd |year=2010 |location=San Frascisco, CA |isbn=978-0-321-59713-7}}{{page needed|date=September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[absolute threshold]] for smell is the minimum amount of sensation needed to elicit a response from receptors in the nose. This amount of sensation has a definable value and is often considered to be a single drop of perfume in a six-room house. This value will change depending on what substance is being smelled.<ref name = Gale />\n\n====Taste====\n[[Taste]] records flavoring of food and other materials that pass across the [[tongue]] and through the mouth. Gustatory cells are located on the surface of the [[tongue]] and adjacent portions of the [[pharynx]] and [[larynx]]. Gustatory cells form on [[taste bud]]s, specialized [[Epithelium|epithelial cells]], and are generally turned over every ten days. From each cell, protrudes microvilli, sometimes called taste hairs, through also the taste pore and into the oral cavity. Dissolved chemicals interact with these receptor cells; different tastes bind to specific receptors. Salt and sour receptors are chemically gated ion channels, which depolarize the cell. Sweet, bitter, and umami receptors are called [[gustducin]]s, specialized [[G protein-coupled receptor|G protein coupled receptors]]. Both divisions of receptor cells release neurotransmitters to afferent fibers causing [[action potential]] firing.<ref name = Martini />\n\nThe [[absolute threshold]] for taste is the minimum amount of sensation needed to elicit a response from receptors in the mouth.

Hair cells in the cochlear duct, specifically the [[organ of Corti]], are deflected as waves of fluid and membrane motion travel through the chambers of the cochlea. Bipolar sensory neurons located in the center of the cochlea monitor the information from these receptor cells and pass it on to the brainstem via the cochlear branch of [[Vestibulocochlear nerve|cranial nerve VIII]].

This amount of sensation has a definable value and is often considered to be a watch ticking in an otherwise soundless environment 20 feet away.<ref name = Gale />\n\n====Equilibrium====\nSemi circular ducts, which are connected directly to the [[cochlea]], can interpret and convey to the brain information about equilibrium by a similar method as the one used for hearing. [[Hair cell]]s in these parts of the ear protrude kinocilia and stereocilia into a gelatinous material that lines the ducts of this canal. In parts of these semi circular canals, specifically the maculae, calcium carbonate crystals known as statoconia rest on the surface of this gelatinous material. When tilting the head or when the body undergoes linear acceleration, these crystals move disturbing the cilia of the hair cells and, consequently, affecting the release of neurotransmitter to be taken up by surrounding sensory nerves. In other areas of the semi circular canal, specifically the ampulla, a structure known as the cupula\u2014analogous to the gelatinous material in the maculae\u2014distorts hair cells in a similar fashion when the fluid medium that surrounds it causes the cupula itself to move. The ampulla communicates to the brain information about the head's horizontal rotation. Neurons of the adjacent vestibular ganglia monitor the hair cells in these ducts. These sensory fibers form the vestibular branch of the [[Vestibulocochlear nerve|cranial nerve VIII]].<ref name = Martini />\n\n==Cellular response==\n{{main|Cell signaling}}\nIn general, cellular response to stimuli is defined as a change in state or activity of a cell in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, or gene expression.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/75556 |year=2000 |last1=Botstein |first1=David |last2=Ball |first2=J.

Stimuli are always converted into electrical signals via [[Transduction (physiology)|transduction]]. This electrical signal, or [[receptor potential]], takes a specific pathway through the nervous system to initiate a systematic response. Each type of receptor is specialized to respond preferentially to only one kind of stimulus energy, called the [[adequate stimulus]]. Sensory receptors have a well-defined range of stimuli to which they respond, and each is tuned to the particular needs of the organism. Stimuli are relayed throughout the body by mechanotransduction or chemotransduction, depending on the nature of the stimulus.<ref name = Nicholls />\n\n===Mechanical===\nIn response to a mechanical stimulus, cellular sensors of force are proposed to be extracellular matrix molecules, cytoskeleton, transmembrane proteins, proteins at the membrane-phospholipid interface, elements of the nuclear matrix, chromatin, and the lipid bilayer. Response can be twofold: the extracellular matrix, for example, is a conductor of mechanical forces but its structure and composition is also influenced by the cellular responses to those same applied or endogenously generated forces.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.bioeng.9.060906.151927 |title=Cell Mechanics: Integrating Cell Responses to Mechanical Stimuli |year=2007 |last1=Janmey |first1=Paul A. |last2=McCulloch |first2=Christopher A. |journal=Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering |volume=9 |pages=1\u201334 |pmid=17461730}}</ref> Mechanosensitive ion channels are found in many cell types and it has been shown that the permeability of these channels to cations is affected by stretch receptors and mechanical stimuli.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.physiol.59.1.575 |title=Tensegrity: The Architectural Basis of Cellular Mechanotransduction |year=1997 |last1=Ingber |first1=D.

[[G protein-coupled receptor]]s in the plasma membrane of these cells can initiate second messenger pathways that cause cation channels to open.\n\nIn response to stimuli, the [[sensory receptor]] initiates sensory transduction by creating graded potentials or action potentials in the same cell or in an adjacent one. Sensitivity to stimuli is obtained by chemical amplification through [[Second messenger system|second messenger pathways]] in which enzymatic cascades produce large numbers of intermediate products, increasing the effect of one receptor molecule.<ref name = Nicholls />\n\n==Systematic response==\n\n===Nervous-system response===\nThough receptors and stimuli are varied, most extrinsic stimuli first generate localized graded potentials in the neurons associated with the specific sensory organ or tissue.<ref name = Martini /> In the [[nervous system]], internal and external stimuli can elicit two different categories of responses: an excitatory response, normally in the form of an [[action potential]], and an inhibitory response.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1966.tb50176.x |title=The Ionic Mechanisms of Excitatory and Inhibitory Synaptic Action |year=1966 |last1=Eccles |first1=J. C. |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=137 |issue=2 |pmid=5338549 |pages=473\u201394}}</ref> When a [[neuron]] is stimulated by an excitatory impulse, neuronal [[dendrite]]s are bound by [[neurotransmitter]]s which cause the cell to become permeable to a specific type of ion; the type of neurotransmitter determines to which ion the neurotransmitter will become permeable. In [[excitatory postsynaptic potential]]s, an excitatory response is generated. This is caused by an excitatory neurotransmitter, normally [[glutamate]] binding to a neuron's dendrites, causing an influx of sodium ions through channels located near the binding site.\n\nThis change in membrane permeability in the dendrites is known as a local graded potential and causes the membrane voltage to change from a negative resting potential to a more positive voltage, a process known as [[depolarization]]. The opening of sodium channels allows nearby sodium channels to open, allowing the change in permeability to spread from the dendrites to the [[Perikaryon|cell body]]. If a graded potential is strong enough, or if several graded potentials occur in a fast enough frequency, the depolarization is able to spread across the cell body to the [[axon hillock]]. From the axon hillock, an action potential can be generated and propagated down the neuron's [[axon]], causing sodium ion channels in the axon to open as the impulse travels. Once the signal begins to travel down the axon, the membrane potential has already passed [[Threshold potential|threshold]], which means that it cannot be stopped. This phenomenon is known as an all-or-nothing response. Groups of sodium channels opened by the change in membrane potential strengthen the signal as it travels away from the axon hillock, allowing it to move the length of the axon. As the depolarization reaches the end of the axon, or the [[axon terminal]], the end of the neuron becomes permeable to calcium ions, which enters the cell via calcium ion channels. Calcium causes the release of neurotransmitters stored in [[synaptic vesicle]]s, which enter the synapse between two neurons known as the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons; if the signal from the presynaptic neuron is excitatory, it will cause the release of an excitatory neurotransmitter, causing a similar response in the postsynaptic neuron.<ref name = Nicholls /> These neurons may communicate with thousands of other receptors and target cells through extensive, complex dendritic networks. Communication between receptors in this fashion enables discrimination and the more explicit interpretation of external stimuli. Effectively, these localized graded potentials trigger action potentials that communicate, in their frequency, along nerve axons eventually arriving in specific cortexes of the brain. In these also highly specialized parts of the brain, these signals are coordinated with others to possibly trigger a new response.<ref name = Martini />\n\nIf a signal from the presynaptic neuron is inhibitory, inhibitory neurotransmitters, normally [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] will be released into the synapse.<ref name = Nicholls /> This neurotransmitter causes an [[inhibitory postsynaptic potential]] in the postsynaptic neuron. This response will cause the postsynaptic neuron to become permeable to chloride ions, making the membrane potential of the cell negative; a negative membrane potential makes it more difficult for the cell to fire an action potential and prevents any signal from being passed on through the neuron. Depending on the type of stimulus, a neuron can be either excitatory or inhibitory.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite journal |pmid=6150966 |year=1984 |last1=Pitman |first1=Robert M |title=The versatile synapse |volume=112 |pages=199\u2013224 |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6150966}}</ref>\n\n===Muscular-system response===\nNerves in the [[peripheral nervous system]] spread out to various parts of the body, including [[muscle fiber]]s.

When muscles receive information from internal or external stimuli, muscle fibers are stimulated by their respective motor neuron. Impulses are passed from the [[central nervous system]] down neurons until they reach the motor neuron, which releases the neurotransmitter [[acetylcholine]] (ACh) into the neuromuscular junction. ACh binds to [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptors]] on the surface of the muscle cell and opens ion channels, allowing sodium ions to flow into the cell and potassium ions to flow out; this ion movement causes a depolarization, which allows for the release of calcium ions within the cell. Calcium ions bind to proteins within the muscle cell to allow for muscle contraction; the ultimate consequence of a stimulus.<ref name = Nicholls />\n\n===Endocrine-system response===\n\n====Vasopressin====\nThe [[endocrine system]] is affected largely by many internal and external stimuli. One internal stimulus that causes [[hormone]] release is [[blood pressure]]. [[Hypotension]], or low blood pressure, is a large driving force for the release of [[vasopressin]], a hormone which causes the retention of water in the kidneys. This process also increases an individuals thirst. By fluid retention or by consuming fluids, if an individual's blood pressure returns to normal, vasopressin release slows and less fluid is retained by the kidneys. [[Hypovolemia]], or low fluid levels in the body, can also act as a stimulus to cause this response.<ref name = Baylis>{{cite journal |pmid=3318505 |year=1987 |last1=Baylis |first1=PH |title=Osmoregulation and control of vasopressin secretion in healthy humans |volume=253 |issue=5 Pt 2 |pages=R671\u20138 |journal=The American Journal of Physiology |doi=10.1152/ajpregu.1987.253.5.R671 }}</ref>\n\n====Epinephrine====\n[[Epinephrine]], also known as adrenaline, is also used commonly to respond to both internal and external changes. One common cause of the release of this hormone is the [[Fight-or-flight response]]. When the body encounters an external stimulus that is potentially dangerous, epinephrine is released from the [[adrenal glands]]. Epinephrine causes physiological changes in the body, such as constriction of blood vessels, dilation of pupils, increased heart and respiratory rate, and the metabolism of glucose.

The ability of an [[organism]] or [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] to respond to external stimuli is called sensitivity. When a stimulus is applied to a [[sensory receptor]], it normally elicits or influences a [[Reflex action|reflex]] via [[Transduction (physiology)|stimulus transduction]]. These sensory receptors can receive information from outside the body, as in touch receptors found in the skin or light receptors in the eye, as well as from inside the body, as in [[chemoreceptors]] and [[mechanoreceptors]]. An internal stimulus is often the first component of a [[Homeostasis|homeostatic control system]]. External stimuli are capable of producing systemic responses throughout the body, as in the [[fight-or-flight response]]. In order for a stimulus to be detected with high probability, its level must exceed the [[absolute threshold]]; if a signal does reach threshold, the information is transmitted to the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), where it is integrated and a decision on how to react is made. Although stimuli commonly cause the body to respond, it is the CNS that finally determines whether a signal causes a reaction or not.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Internal===\n\n====Homeostatic imbalances====\n[[Homeostasis|Homeostatic]] outbalances are the main driving force for changes of the body. These stimuli are monitored closely by receptors and sensors in different parts of the body. These sensors are [[mechanoreceptors]], [[chemoreceptors]] and [[thermoreceptors]] that, respectively, respond to pressure or stretching, chemical changes, or temperature changes. Examples of mechanoreceptors include [[baroreceptors]] which detect changes in blood pressure, [[Merkel's discs]] which can detect sustained touch and pressure, and [[hair cell]]s which detect sound stimuli. Homeostatic imbalances that can serve as internal stimuli include nutrient and ion levels in the blood, oxygen levels, and water levels. Deviations from the homeostatic ideal may generate a [[homeostatic emotion]], such as pain, thirst or fatigue, that motivates behavior that will restore the body to stasis (such as withdrawal, drinking or resting).<ref name = Craig>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(03)00123-1 |title=A new view of pain as a homeostatic emotion |year=2003 |last1=Craig |first1=A D |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=303\u20137 |pmid=12798599}}</ref>\n\n====Blood pressure====\nBlood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output are measured by stretch receptors found in the [[Carotid artery|carotid arteries]].

These impulses inhibit the constriction of blood vessels and lower the heart rate.

Information, or stimuli, in the form of [[light]] enters the [[retina]], where it excites a special type of [[neuron]] called a [[photoreceptor cell]]. A local [[Receptor potential|graded potential]] begins in the photoreceptor, where it excites the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] enough for the impulse to be passed along through a track of neurons to the [[central nervous system]]. As the signal travels from photoreceptors to larger neurons, [[Action Potential|action potentials]] must be created for the signal to have enough strength to reach the CNS.<ref name = Nicholls /> If the stimulus does not warrant a strong enough response, it is said to not reach [[absolute threshold]], and the body does not react. However, if the stimulus is strong enough to create an action potential in neurons away from the photoreceptor, the body will integrate the information and react appropriately.

[[Olfaction|Olfactory]] [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] located on either side of the [[nasal septum]] consist of [[olfactory epithelium]] and [[lamina propria]]. The olfactory epithelium, which contains olfactory receptor cells, covers the inferior surface of the [[Cribriform plate|cribiform plate]], the superior portion of the perpendicular plate, the superior nasal concha. Only roughly two percent of airborne compounds inhaled are carried to olfactory organs as a small sample of the air being inhaled. Olfactory receptors extend past the epithelial surface providing a base for many cilia that lie in the surrounding mucus. Odorant-binding proteins interact with these [[Cilium|cilia]] stimulating the receptors. Odorants are generally small organic molecules. Greater water and lipid solubility is related directly to stronger smelling odorants.

This amount of sensation has a definable value and is often considered to be a watch ticking in an otherwise soundless environment 20 feet away.<ref name = Gale />\n\n====Equilibrium====\nSemi circular ducts, which are connected directly to the [[cochlea]], can interpret and convey to the brain information about equilibrium by a similar method as the one used for hearing. [[Hair cell]]s in these parts of the ear protrude kinocilia and stereocilia into a gelatinous material that lines the ducts of this canal. In parts of these semi circular canals, specifically the maculae, calcium carbonate crystals known as statoconia rest on the surface of this gelatinous material. When tilting the head or when the body undergoes linear acceleration, these crystals move disturbing the cilia of the hair cells and, consequently, affecting the release of neurotransmitter to be taken up by surrounding sensory nerves. In other areas of the semi circular canal, specifically the ampulla, a structure known as the cupula\u2014analogous to the gelatinous material in the maculae\u2014distorts hair cells in a similar fashion when the fluid medium that surrounds it causes the cupula itself to move. The ampulla communicates to the brain information about the head's horizontal rotation. Neurons of the adjacent vestibular ganglia monitor the hair cells in these ducts. These sensory fibers form the vestibular branch of the [[Vestibulocochlear nerve|cranial nerve VIII]].<ref name = Martini />\n\n==Cellular response==\n{{main|Cell signaling}}\nIn general, cellular response to stimuli is defined as a change in state or activity of a cell in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, or gene expression.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/75556 |year=2000 |last1=Botstein |first1=David |last2=Ball |first2=J.

Stimuli are always converted into electrical signals via [[Transduction (physiology)|transduction]]. This electrical signal, or [[receptor potential]], takes a specific pathway through the nervous system to initiate a systematic response. Each type of receptor is specialized to respond preferentially to only one kind of stimulus energy, called the [[adequate stimulus]]. Sensory receptors have a well-defined range of stimuli to which they respond, and each is tuned to the particular needs of the organism. Stimuli are relayed throughout the body by mechanotransduction or chemotransduction, depending on the nature of the stimulus.<ref name = Nicholls />\n\n===Mechanical===\nIn response to a mechanical stimulus, cellular sensors of force are proposed to be extracellular matrix molecules, cytoskeleton, transmembrane proteins, proteins at the membrane-phospholipid interface, elements of the nuclear matrix, chromatin, and the lipid bilayer. Response can be twofold: the extracellular matrix, for example, is a conductor of mechanical forces but its structure and composition is also influenced by the cellular responses to those same applied or endogenously generated forces.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.bioeng.9.060906.151927 |title=Cell Mechanics: Integrating Cell Responses to Mechanical Stimuli |year=2007 |last1=Janmey |first1=Paul A. |last2=McCulloch |first2=Christopher A. |journal=Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering |volume=9 |pages=1\u201334 |pmid=17461730}}</ref> Mechanosensitive ion channels are found in many cell types and it has been shown that the permeability of these channels to cations is affected by stretch receptors and mechanical stimuli.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.physiol.59.1.575 |title=Tensegrity: The Architectural Basis of Cellular Mechanotransduction |year=1997 |last1=Ingber |first1=D.

Such is the case in [[Olfactory receptor neuron|olfactory cells]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/325442a0 |title=A cyclic nucleotide-gated conductance in olfactory receptor cilia |year=1987 |last1=Nakamura |first1=Tadashi |last2=Gold |first2=Geoffrey H. |journal=Nature |volume=325 |issue=6103 |pages=442\u20134 |pmid=3027574}}</ref> Depolarization in these cells result from opening of non-selective cation channels upon binding of the odorant to the specific receptor. [[G protein-coupled receptor]]s in the plasma membrane of these cells can initiate second messenger pathways that cause cation channels to open.\n\nIn response to stimuli, the [[sensory receptor]] initiates sensory transduction by creating graded potentials or action potentials in the same cell or in an adjacent one. Sensitivity to stimuli is obtained by chemical amplification through [[Second messenger system|second messenger pathways]] in which enzymatic cascades produce large numbers of intermediate products, increasing the effect of one receptor molecule.<ref name = Nicholls />\n\n==Systematic response==\n\n===Nervous-system response===\nThough receptors and stimuli are varied, most extrinsic stimuli first generate localized graded potentials in the neurons associated with the specific sensory organ or tissue.<ref name = Martini /> In the [[nervous system]], internal and external stimuli can elicit two different categories of responses: an excitatory response, normally in the form of an [[action potential]], and an inhibitory response.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1966.tb50176.x |title=The Ionic Mechanisms of Excitatory and Inhibitory Synaptic Action |year=1966 |last1=Eccles |first1=J. C. |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=137 |issue=2 |pmid=5338549 |pages=473\u201394}}</ref> When a [[neuron]] is stimulated by an excitatory impulse, neuronal [[dendrite]]s are bound by [[neurotransmitter]]s which cause the cell to become permeable to a specific type of ion; the type of neurotransmitter determines to which ion the neurotransmitter will become permeable. In [[excitatory postsynaptic potential]]s, an excitatory response is generated. This is caused by an excitatory neurotransmitter, normally [[glutamate]] binding to a neuron's dendrites, causing an influx of sodium ions through channels located near the binding site.\n\nThis change in membrane permeability in the dendrites is known as a local graded potential and causes the membrane voltage to change from a negative resting potential to a more positive voltage, a process known as [[depolarization]]. The opening of sodium channels allows nearby sodium channels to open, allowing the change in permeability to spread from the dendrites to the [[Perikaryon|cell body]]. If a graded potential is strong enough, or if several graded potentials occur in a fast enough frequency, the depolarization is able to spread across the cell body to the [[axon hillock]]. From the axon hillock, an action potential can be generated and propagated down the neuron's [[axon]], causing sodium ion channels in the axon to open as the impulse travels. Once the signal begins to travel down the axon, the membrane potential has already passed [[Threshold potential|threshold]], which means that it cannot be stopped. This phenomenon is known as an all-or-nothing response. Groups of sodium channels opened by the change in membrane potential strengthen the signal as it travels away from the axon hillock, allowing it to move the length of the axon. As the depolarization reaches the end of the axon, or the [[axon terminal]], the end of the neuron becomes permeable to calcium ions, which enters the cell via calcium ion channels. Calcium causes the release of neurotransmitters stored in [[synaptic vesicle]]s, which enter the synapse between two neurons known as the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons; if the signal from the presynaptic neuron is excitatory, it will cause the release of an excitatory neurotransmitter, causing a similar response in the postsynaptic neuron.<ref name = Nicholls /> These neurons may communicate with thousands of other receptors and target cells through extensive, complex dendritic networks. Communication between receptors in this fashion enables discrimination and the more explicit interpretation of external stimuli. Effectively, these localized graded potentials trigger action potentials that communicate, in their frequency, along nerve axons eventually arriving in specific cortexes of the brain. In these also highly specialized parts of the brain, these signals are coordinated with others to possibly trigger a new response.<ref name = Martini />\n\nIf a signal from the presynaptic neuron is inhibitory, inhibitory neurotransmitters, normally [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] will be released into the synapse.<ref name = Nicholls /> This neurotransmitter causes an [[inhibitory postsynaptic potential]] in the postsynaptic neuron. This response will cause the postsynaptic neuron to become permeable to chloride ions, making the membrane potential of the cell negative; a negative membrane potential makes it more difficult for the cell to fire an action potential and prevents any signal from being passed on through the neuron. Depending on the type of stimulus, a neuron can be either excitatory or inhibitory.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite journal |pmid=6150966 |year=1984 |last1=Pitman |first1=Robert M |title=The versatile synapse |volume=112 |pages=199\u2013224 |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6150966}}</ref>\n\n===Muscular-system response===\nNerves in the [[peripheral nervous system]] spread out to various parts of the body, including [[muscle fiber]]s.

When muscles receive information from internal or external stimuli, muscle fibers are stimulated by their respective motor neuron. Impulses are passed from the [[central nervous system]] down neurons until they reach the motor neuron, which releases the neurotransmitter [[acetylcholine]] (ACh) into the neuromuscular junction. ACh binds to [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptors]] on the surface of the muscle cell and opens ion channels, allowing sodium ions to flow into the cell and potassium ions to flow out; this ion movement causes a depolarization, which allows for the release of calcium ions within the cell. Calcium ions bind to proteins within the muscle cell to allow for muscle contraction; the ultimate consequence of a stimulus.<ref name = Nicholls />\n\n===Endocrine-system response===\n\n====Vasopressin====\nThe [[endocrine system]] is affected largely by many internal and external stimuli. One internal stimulus that causes [[hormone]] release is [[blood pressure]]. [[Hypotension]], or low blood pressure, is a large driving force for the release of [[vasopressin]], a hormone which causes the retention of water in the kidneys. This process also increases an individuals thirst. By fluid retention or by consuming fluids, if an individual's blood pressure returns to normal, vasopressin release slows and less fluid is retained by the kidneys. [[Hypovolemia]], or low fluid levels in the body, can also act as a stimulus to cause this response.<ref name = Baylis>{{cite journal |pmid=3318505 |year=1987 |last1=Baylis |first1=PH |title=Osmoregulation and control of vasopressin secretion in healthy humans |volume=253 |issue=5 Pt 2 |pages=R671\u20138 |journal=The American Journal of Physiology |doi=10.1152/ajpregu.1987.253.5.R671 }}</ref>\n\n====Epinephrine====\n[[Epinephrine]], also known as adrenaline, is also used commonly to respond to both internal and external changes. One common cause of the release of this hormone is the [[Fight-or-flight response]]. When the body encounters an external stimulus that is potentially dangerous, epinephrine is released from the [[adrenal glands]]. Epinephrine causes physiological changes in the body, such as constriction of blood vessels, dilation of pupils, increased heart and respiratory rate, and the metabolism of glucose. All of these responses to a single stimuli aid in protecting the individual, whether the decision is made to stay and fight, or run away and avoid danger.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11249846 |year=2001 |last1=Goligorsky |first1=Michael S. |title=The concept of cellular 'fight-or-flight' reaction to stress |volume=280 |issue=4 |pages=F551\u201361 |journal=American Journal of Physiology.

This reflex is known as the [[cephalic phase]] of [[digestion]]. The sight and smell of food are strong enough stimuli to cause salivation, gastric and pancreatic enzyme secretion, and endocrine secretion in preparation for the incoming nutrients; by starting the digestive process before food reaches the stomach, the body is able to more effectively and efficiently metabolize food into necessary nutrients.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.appet.2007.10.006 |title=Anticipatory physiological regulation in feeding biology: Cephalic phase responses |year=2008 |last1=Power |first1=Michael L. |last2=Schulkin |first2=Jay |journal=Appetite |volume=50 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=194\u2013206 |pmid=18045735 |pmc=2297467}}</ref> Once food hits the mouth, taste and information from receptors in the mouth add to the digestive response.
