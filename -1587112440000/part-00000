This suppression of evidence had contributed to Taylor's conviction for murder. The audit was released in 2010; it found that it had been common practice for two decades for a select group of agents within the State Bureau of Investigation to withhold information. In addition, they did not keep up with scientific standards and the latest tests. The two investigators, [[Chris Swecker]] and Micheal Fox, cited almost 230 cases that were tainted by these actions. Three persons convicted in such cases had been executed; 80 defendants convicted were still serving time in prison.

This suppression of evidence had contributed to Taylor's conviction for murder. The audit was released in 2010; it found that it had been common practice for two decades for a select group of agents within the State Bureau of Investigation to withhold information. In addition, they did not keep up with scientific standards and the latest tests. The two investigators, [[Chris Swecker]] and Micheal Fox, cited almost 230 cases that were tainted by these actions. Three persons convicted in such cases had been executed; 80 defendants convicted were still serving time in prison. A massive state effort was undertaken to follow up on their cases.\n\nCooper argued his first case before the [[United States Supreme Court]], ''[[J. D. B. v. North Carolina]]'', in 2011, a case related to Miranda rights in juvenile cases.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/09-11121.htm|title=Supreme Court site|work=supremecourt.gov|accessdate=November 10, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/03/24/1077030/highest-court-hears-cooper.html|title=News & Observer: Court questions N.C.'s position on Miranda warning|work=newsobserver.com|accessdate=November 10, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225103142/http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/03/24/1077030/highest-court-hears-cooper.html|archivedate=December 25, 2014}}</ref> The Court ruled 5\u20134 against North Carolina.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/06/16/1278313/high-court-rules-against-nc-in.html|title=News & Observer: High court rules against NC in juvenile Miranda rights|work=newsobserver.com|accessdate=November 10, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225103148/http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/06/16/1278313/high-court-rules-against-nc-in.html|archivedate=December 25, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/06/17/137236801/high-court-age-must-be-considered-in-interrogation |title=High Court: Age Must Be Considered In Legislation |publisher=Npr.org |date=June 16, 2011 |accessdate=December 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Governor of North Carolina==\n===Elections===\n====2016====\n{{main|2016 North Carolina gubernatorial election}}\n[[File:US Election 2016 (32951033395).jpg|thumb|Cooper campaigning in October 2016]]\nCooper ran for [[Governor of North Carolina]] in the [[2016 North Carolina gubernatorial election|2016 election]] against incumbent Republican [[Pat McCrory]].<ref name=forgov/> In March 2016, the [[North Carolina General Assembly]] passed the [[Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act]]\u2014commonly known as \"House Bill 2\"\u2014which McCrory signed into law.{{sfn|Link|2018|p=477}}{{sfn|Weichelt|2018|p=241}} Numerous corporations began boycotting the state in protest of the law, cancelling job investment and expansion plans.{{sfn|Weichelt|2018|p=241}} Cooper denounced the law as unconstitutional and refused to defend it in court in his capacity as attorney general.{{sfn|Link|2018|p=478}}\n\nAs a result of the economic damage caused by the law, McCrory's approval rating dramatically fell in the months preceding the election.{{sfn|Weichelt|2018|p=241}} The election was narrow, and when initial results showed Cooper had an advantage, McCrory claimed without evidence that the election had been manipulated by voter fraud.

In his use of dynamic composition, illusionistic perspective and dramatic foreshortening, Correggio prefigured the [[Baroque]] art of the 17th century and the [[Rococo]] art of the 18th century. He is considered a master of [[chiaroscuro]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Correggio - The Holy Night - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|230px|[[Nativity (Correggio)|''Nativity'']] (c.1529\u201330)]]\nAntonio Allegri was born in [[Correggio, Italy|Correggio]], a small town near [[Reggio Emilia]]. His date of birth is uncertain (around 1489). His father was a merchant.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Otherwise little is known about Correggio's early life or training. It is, however, often assumed that he had his first artistic education from his father's brother, the painter [[Lorenzo Allegri (painter)|Lorenzo Allegri]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ricci|first=Conrado|title=Antonio Allegri da Correggio: His Life, his Friends, and his Time|year=1896|page=[https://archive.org/details/antonioallegrida00riccuoft/page/43 43]|publisher=William Heinemann|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/antonioallegrida00riccuoft}}</ref>\n\nIn 1503\u20131505 he was apprenticed to [[Francesco Bianchi Ferrara]] in [[Modena]], where he probably became familiar with the classicism of artists like [[Lorenzo Costa]] and [[Francesco Francia]], evidence of which can be found in his first works. After a trip to [[Mantua]] in 1506, he returned to Correggio, where he stayed until 1510. To this period is assigned the ''Adoration of the Child with St. Elizabeth and John'', which shows clear influences from Costa and [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]. In 1514 he probably finished three [[Tondo (art)|tondos]] for the entrance of the [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|church of Sant'Andrea in Mantua]], and then returned to Correggio, where, as an independent and increasingly renowned artist, he signed a contract for the Madonna altarpiece in the local monastery of St. Francis (now in the [[Dresden Gem\u00e4ldegalerie]]).\n\nOne of his sons, [[Pomponio Allegri]], became an undistinguished painter. Both father and son occasionally referred to themselves using the Latinized form of the family name, Laeti.<ref> [[Henry Fuseli]], Aphorisms. A history of art in the schools of Italy, in ''The Life and Writings of Henry Fuseli, Esq. M.A.R.A.'', Vol. III, p. 91</ref>\n\n==Works in Parma==\n\nBy 1516, Correggio was in Parma, where he spent most of the remainder of his career. Here, he befriended [[Michelangelo Anselmi]], a prominent [[Mannerist]] painter. In 1519 he married Girolama Francesca di Braghetis, also of Correggio, who died in 1529.<ref name=\"eb\" />\nFrom this period are the ''Madonna and Child with the Young Saint John'', ''Christ Leaving His Mother'' and the lost ''Madonna of Albinea''.\n\nCorreggio's first major commission (February\u2013September 1519) was the ceiling decoration of a private chamber<!--NOT CLEAR IF A DINING ROOM OR ELSE!--> of the mother-superior (abbess Giovanna Piacenza) of the convent of St. Paul in Parma, now known as [[Camera di San Paolo]]. Here he painted an arbor pierced by oculi opening to glimpses of playful cherubs. Below the oculi are [[lunette]]s with images of statues in feigned monochromic marble. The fireplace is frescoed with an image of Diana. The iconography of the scheme is complex, combining images of classical marbles with whimsical colorful ''bambini''.  \n\nHe then painted the illusionistic ''[[Vision of St. John on Patmos]]'' (1520\u201321) for the dome of the church of [[San Giovanni Evangelista, Parma|San Giovanni Evangelista]]. \nThree years later he decorated the dome of the [[Cathedral of Parma]] with a startling ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Correggio)|Assumption of the Virgin]]'', crowded with layers of receding figures in [[Melozzo]]'s perspective (''[[sotto in su]]'', from down to up).<ref name=\"eb\">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Correggio|first= William Michael|last= Rossetti|authorlink=William Michael Rossetti}}</ref>\nThese two works represented a highly novel illusionistic ''sotto in su'' treatment of dome decoration that would exert a profound influence upon future fresco artists, from [[Carlo Cignani]] in his fresco ''Assumption of the Virgin'', in the cathedral church of [[Forl\u00ec]], to [[Gaudenzio Ferrari]] in his frescoes for the cupola of ''Santa Maria dei Miracoli'' in [[Saronno]], to [[Il Pordenone|Pordenone]] in his now-lost fresco from [[Treviso]], and to the baroque elaborations of [[Giovanni Lanfranco|Lanfranco]] and [[Baciccio]] in Roman churches. The massing of spectators in a vortex, creating both narrative and decoration, the illusionistic obliteration of the architectural roof-plane, and the thrusting perspective towards divine infinity, were devices without precedent, and which depended on the extrapolation of the mechanics of perspective. The recession and movement implied by the figures presage the dynamism that would characterize [[Baroque]] painting.\n\nOther masterpieces include ''[[The Lamentation]]'' and ''[[The Martyrdom of Four Saints]]'', both at the Galleria Nazionale of Parma. The ''Lamentation'' is haunted by a lambency rarely seen in Italian painting prior to this time.{{fact|date=April 2019}} The ''Martyrdom'' is also remarkable for resembling later Baroque compositions such as [[Bernini]]'s ''[[Truth (Bernini)|Truth]]'' and [[Ercole Ferrata]]'s ''Death of Saint Agnes'', showing a gleeful saint entering martyrdom.{{fact|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Mythological series based on Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''==\n[[File:Antonio Allegri, called Correggio - Jupiter and Io - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|230px|''[[Jupiter and Io]]'' (c. 1531) typifies the unabashed eroticism, radiance, and cool, pearly colors associated with Correggio's best work.]]\n\nAside from his religious output, Correggio conceived a now-famous set of paintings depicting the ''Loves of Jupiter'' as described in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]''. The voluptuous series was commissioned by [[Federico II Gonzaga]] of Mantua, probably to decorate his private Ovid Room in the [[Palazzo Te]]. However, they were given to the visiting Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and thus left Italy within years of their completion.\n\n''[[Leda and the Swan (Correggio)|Leda and the Swan]]'' \u2013 acquired by [[Frederick the Great]] in 1753; now in Staatliche Museen of [[Berlin]] \u2013 is a tumult of incidents: in the centre Leda straddles a swan, and on the right, a shy but satisfied maiden. ''[[Dana\u00eb (Correggio)|Dana\u00eb]]'', now in Rome's [[Borghese Gallery]], depicts the maiden as she is impregnated by a curtain of gilded divine rain. Her lower torso semi-obscured by sheets, Danae appears more demure and gleeful than [[Titian]]'s 1545 version of the same topic, where the rain is more accurately numismatic. The picture once called ''Antiope and the Satyr'' is now correctly identified as ''[[Venus and Cupid with a Satyr]]''.\n\n''[[Ganymede Abducted by the Eagle]]'' depicts the young man aloft in literal amorous flight. Some have interpreted the conjunction of man and eagle as a metaphor for the evangelist John; however, given the erotic context of this and other paintings, this seems unlikely. This painting and its partner, the masterpiece of ''[[Jupiter and Io]]'', are in [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] of [[Vienna]]. ''[[Ganymede Abducted by the Eagle]]'', one of the four mythological paintings commissioned by Federico II Gonzaga, is a proto-[[Baroque]] work due to its depiction of movement, drama, and diagonal compositional arrangement.\n\n==Death==\nReturning to his home town in later years, Correggio died there suddenly on 5 March, 1534. The following day he was buried in San Francesco in Correggio near his youthful masterpiece, the 'Madonna di San Francesco', housed today in Dresden. The precise location of his tomb is now unknown.\n\n==Evaluation==\n[[File:Correggio - Leda and the Swan - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Leda and the Swan'' (c. 1532)]]\n\nCorreggio was remembered by his contemporaries as a shadowy, melancholic and introverted character. An enigmatic and eclectic artist, he appears to have emerged from no major apprenticeship. In addition to the influence of Costa, there are echoes of [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s style in his work, and a response to [[Leonardo da Vinci]], as well. Correggio had little immediate influence in terms of apprenticed successors, but his works are now considered to have been revolutionary and influential on subsequent artists. A half-century after his death Correggio's work was well known to [[Vasari]], who felt that he had not had enough \"Roman\" exposure to make him a better painter. In the 18th and 19th centuries, his works were often noted in the diaries of foreign visitors to Italy, which led to a reevaluation of his art during the period of [[Romanticism]]. The flight of the Madonna in the vault of the cupola of the Cathedral of Parma inspired many scenographical decorations in lay and religious palaces during those centuries.\n\nCorreggio's illusionistic experiments, in which imaginary spaces replace the natural reality, seem to prefigure many elements of [[Mannerist]], [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] stylistic approaches. He appears to have fostered artistic grandchildren, for example, Giovannino di Pomponio Allegri (1521\u20131593).<ref>[http://www.museoilcorreggio.org/allegati/guida%20breve%20italiano%20museo%20fogli%20singoli_101104010007.pdf Guida al Museo il Correggio].</ref> Correggio had no direct disciples outside of Parma, where he was influential on the work of [[Giovanni Maria Francesco Rondani]], [[Parmigianino]], [[Bernardo Gatti]], [[Francesco Madonnina]], and [[Giorgio Gandini del Grano]].\n\n==Selected works==\n[[File:Correggio -

In his use of dynamic composition, illusionistic perspective and dramatic foreshortening, Correggio prefigured the [[Baroque]] art of the 17th century and the [[Rococo]] art of the 18th century. He is considered a master of [[chiaroscuro]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Correggio - The Holy Night - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|230px|[[Nativity (Correggio)|''Nativity'']] (c.1529\u201330)]]\nAntonio Allegri was born in [[Correggio, Italy|Correggio]], a small town near [[Reggio Emilia]]. His date of birth is uncertain (around 1489). His father was a merchant.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Otherwise little is known about Correggio's early life or training. It is, however, often assumed that he had his first artistic education from his father's brother, the painter [[Lorenzo Allegri (painter)|Lorenzo Allegri]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ricci|first=Conrado|title=Antonio Allegri da Correggio: His Life, his Friends, and his Time|year=1896|page=[https://archive.org/details/antonioallegrida00riccuoft/page/43 43]|publisher=William Heinemann|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/antonioallegrida00riccuoft}}</ref>\n\nIn 1503\u20131505 he was apprenticed to [[Francesco Bianchi Ferrara]] in [[Modena]], where he probably became familiar with the classicism of artists like [[Lorenzo Costa]] and [[Francesco Francia]], evidence of which can be found in his first works. After a trip to [[Mantua]] in 1506, he returned to Correggio, where he stayed until 1510. To this period is assigned the ''Adoration of the Child with St. Elizabeth and John'', which shows clear influences from Costa and [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]. In 1514 he probably finished three [[Tondo (art)|tondos]] for the entrance of the [[Basilica di Sant'Andrea di Mantova|church of Sant'Andrea in Mantua]], and then returned to Correggio, where, as an independent and increasingly renowned artist, he signed a contract for the Madonna altarpiece in the local monastery of St. Francis (now in the [[Dresden Gem\u00e4ldegalerie]]).\n\nOne of his sons, [[Pomponio Allegri]], became an undistinguished painter. Both father and son occasionally referred to themselves using the Latinized form of the family name, Laeti.<ref> [[Henry Fuseli]], Aphorisms. A history of art in the schools of Italy, in ''The Life and Writings of Henry Fuseli, Esq. M.A.R.A.'', Vol. III, p. 91</ref>\n\n==Works in Parma==\n\nBy 1516, Correggio was in Parma, where he spent most of the remainder of his career. Here, he befriended [[Michelangelo Anselmi]], a prominent [[Mannerist]] painter. In 1519 he married Girolama Francesca di Braghetis, also of Correggio, who died in 1529.<ref name=\"eb\" />\nFrom this period are the ''Madonna and Child with the Young Saint John'', ''Christ Leaving His Mother'' and the lost ''Madonna of Albinea''.\n\nCorreggio's first major commission (February\u2013September 1519) was the ceiling decoration of a private chamber<!--NOT CLEAR IF A DINING ROOM OR ELSE!--> of the mother-superior (abbess Giovanna Piacenza) of the convent of St. Paul in Parma, now known as [[Camera di San Paolo]]. Here he painted an arbor pierced by oculi opening to glimpses of playful cherubs. Below the oculi are [[lunette]]s with images of statues in feigned monochromic marble. The fireplace is frescoed with an image of Diana. The iconography of the scheme is complex, combining images of classical marbles with whimsical colorful ''bambini''.  \n\nHe then painted the illusionistic ''[[Vision of St. John on Patmos]]'' (1520\u201321) for the dome of the church of [[San Giovanni Evangelista, Parma|San Giovanni Evangelista]]. \nThree years later he decorated the dome of the [[Cathedral of Parma]] with a startling ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Correggio)|Assumption of the Virgin]]'', crowded with layers of receding figures in [[Melozzo]]'s perspective (''[[sotto in su]]'', from down to up).<ref name=\"eb\">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Correggio|first= William Michael|last= Rossetti|authorlink=William Michael Rossetti}}</ref>\nThese two works represented a highly novel illusionistic ''sotto in su'' treatment of dome decoration that would exert a profound influence upon future fresco artists, from [[Carlo Cignani]] in his fresco ''Assumption of the Virgin'', in the cathedral church of [[Forl\u00ec]], to [[Gaudenzio Ferrari]] in his frescoes for the cupola of ''Santa Maria dei Miracoli'' in [[Saronno]], to [[Il Pordenone|Pordenone]] in his now-lost fresco from [[Treviso]], and to the baroque elaborations of [[Giovanni Lanfranco|Lanfranco]] and [[Baciccio]] in Roman churches. The massing of spectators in a vortex, creating both narrative and decoration, the illusionistic obliteration of the architectural roof-plane, and the thrusting perspective towards divine infinity, were devices without precedent, and which depended on the extrapolation of the mechanics of perspective. The recession and movement implied by the figures presage the dynamism that would characterize [[Baroque]] painting.\n\nOther masterpieces include ''[[The Lamentation]]'' and ''[[The Martyrdom of Four Saints]]'', both at the Galleria Nazionale of Parma. The ''Lamentation'' is haunted by a lambency rarely seen in Italian painting prior to this time.{{fact|date=April 2019}} The ''Martyrdom'' is also remarkable for resembling later Baroque compositions such as [[Bernini]]'s ''[[Truth (Bernini)|Truth]]'' and [[Ercole Ferrata]]'s ''Death of Saint Agnes'', showing a gleeful saint entering martyrdom.{{fact|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Mythological series based on Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''==\n[[File:Antonio Allegri, called Correggio - Jupiter and Io - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|230px|''[[Jupiter and Io]]'' (c. 1531) typifies the unabashed eroticism, radiance, and cool, pearly colors associated with Correggio's best work.]]\n\nAside from his religious output, Correggio conceived a now-famous set of paintings depicting the ''Loves of Jupiter'' as described in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]''. The voluptuous series was commissioned by [[Federico II Gonzaga]] of Mantua, probably to decorate his private Ovid Room in the [[Palazzo Te]]. However, they were given to the visiting Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and thus left Italy within years of their completion.\n\n''[[Leda and the Swan (Correggio)|Leda and the Swan]]'' \u2013 acquired by [[Frederick the Great]] in 1753; now in Staatliche Museen of [[Berlin]] \u2013 is a tumult of incidents: in the centre Leda straddles a swan, and on the right, a shy but satisfied maiden. ''[[Dana\u00eb (Correggio)|Dana\u00eb]]'', now in Rome's [[Borghese Gallery]], depicts the maiden as she is impregnated by a curtain of gilded divine rain. Her lower torso semi-obscured by sheets, Danae appears more demure and gleeful than [[Titian]]'s 1545 version of the same topic, where the rain is more accurately numismatic. The picture once called ''Antiope and the Satyr'' is now correctly identified as ''[[Venus and Cupid with a Satyr]]''.\n\n''[[Ganymede Abducted by the Eagle]]'' depicts the young man aloft in literal amorous flight. Some have interpreted the conjunction of man and eagle as a metaphor for the evangelist John; however, given the erotic context of this and other paintings, this seems unlikely. This painting and its partner, the masterpiece of ''[[Jupiter and Io]]'', are in [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] of [[Vienna]]. ''[[Ganymede Abducted by the Eagle]]'', one of the four mythological paintings commissioned by Federico II Gonzaga, is a proto-[[Baroque]] work due to its depiction of movement, drama, and diagonal compositional arrangement.\n\n==Death==\nReturning to his home town in later years, Correggio died there suddenly on 5 March, 1534. The following day he was buried in San Francesco in Correggio near his youthful masterpiece, the 'Madonna di San Francesco', housed today in Dresden. The precise location of his tomb is now unknown.\n\n==Evaluation==\n[[File:Correggio - Leda and the Swan - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Leda and the Swan'' (c. 1532)]]\n\nCorreggio was remembered by his contemporaries as a shadowy, melancholic and introverted character. An enigmatic and eclectic artist, he appears to have emerged from no major apprenticeship. In addition to the influence of Costa, there are echoes of [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s style in his work, and a response to [[Leonardo da Vinci]], as well. Correggio had little immediate influence in terms of apprenticed successors, but his works are now considered to have been revolutionary and influential on subsequent artists. A half-century after his death Correggio's work was well known to [[Vasari]], who felt that he had not had enough \"Roman\" exposure to make him a better painter. In the 18th and 19th centuries, his works were often noted in the diaries of foreign visitors to Italy, which led to a reevaluation of his art during the period of [[Romanticism]]. The flight of the Madonna in the vault of the cupola of the Cathedral of Parma inspired many scenographical decorations in lay and religious palaces during those centuries.\n\nCorreggio's illusionistic experiments, in which imaginary spaces replace the natural reality, seem to prefigure many elements of [[Mannerist]], [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] stylistic approaches. He appears to have fostered artistic grandchildren, for example, Giovannino di Pomponio Allegri (1521\u20131593).<ref>[http://www.museoilcorreggio.org/allegati/guida%20breve%20italiano%20museo%20fogli%20singoli_101104010007.pdf Guida al Museo il Correggio].</ref> Correggio had no direct disciples outside of Parma, where he was influential on the work of [[Giovanni Maria Francesco Rondani]], [[Parmigianino]], [[Bernardo Gatti]], [[Francesco Madonnina]], and [[Giorgio Gandini del Grano]].\n\n==Selected works==\n[[File:Correggio -

The plot of the episode sees [[List of The Drew Carey Show characters#Drew Carey|Drew]] ([[Drew Carey]]) left in a [[coma]] after he is hit by a car. Drew entertains himself through a fantasy world he creates, while his friends try various things to get him to wake up. At the end of the episode, Drew chooses whether to go to heaven or not and his sister-in-law, [[Mimi Bobeck|Mimi]] ([[Kathy Kinney]]), goes into labor. The episode was written by Les Firestein and directed by [[Gerry Cohen (director)|Gerry Cohen]]. It first aired on February 7, 2001 on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network in the United States.\n\nThe episode was the first of \"a two-part event\" that aired during the February [[sweeps]]. Drew's fantasy world featured special effects and appearances from historical figures, [[Ben Stein]] and [[Joe Walsh]]. The show's theme tune was temporarily replaced with \"[[Girlfriend in a Coma (song)|Girlfriend in a Coma]]\" by [[The Smiths]]. \"Drew's in a Coma\" finishing in 26th place in the ratings for the week it aired. Critical response was mostly positive, with reporters calling the plot funny, strange and surreal. Editor John Fuller was recognised for his work on the episode with a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\n==Plot==\nAs Drew runs for his bus, he suddenly finds himself flying above [[Cleveland]]. He encounters [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] (John Valdetero), who invites him to a party, and a little boy (Charlie Stewart) who asks him to do somersaults. The scene then cuts to Drew's friends [[Kate O'Brien (The Drew Carey Show)|Kate]] ([[Christa Miller]]), [[Lewis Kiniski|Lewis]] ([[Ryan Stiles]]) and [[Oswald Lee Harvey|Oswald]] ([[Diedrich Bader]]) standing by a comatose Drew's bedside. Oswald shakes Drew to wake him up, while Kate tries shouting and then talking to Drew. Drew's brother, [[Steve Carey|Steve]] ([[John Carroll Lynch]]) and his wife, [[Mimi Bobeck|Mimi]] ([[Kathy Kinney]]), arrive and Mimi kisses Drew, but he still does not wake. While he is in his coma, Drew creates a fantasy world with beautiful women, a pizza tree and a beer fountain.\n\nMimi becomes Drew's slave and she turns on a television screen which shows Drew what is happening at the hospital. The doctor (David Purdham) gives Drew an injection to wake him up, but it does not work, as Drew refuses to leave the coma because he is having fun. The doctor then suggests removing Drew from the respirator, so he will have to fight to come out of the coma or die. Drew's friends surround him with his favourite things, try talking to him again and Ed ([[Joe Walsh]]) plays Drew's favourite song. Steve allows the doctor to remove Drew from the respirator and Drew's fantasy world disappears. A heavenly guide ([[Ben Stein]]) appears and tells Drew he has passed the test to get into heaven, but he must decide if he wants to go to now or go back to living. As Drew heads towards the light, Mimi goes into labor.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:JoeWalshSept06.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The episode featured an appearance by [[Joe Walsh]].]]\nIn January 2001, [[Drew Carey]] told ''[[The Charleston Gazette]]'s'' Ellen Gray that during the February [[sweeps]], his character would be going into a coma, while [[Mimi Bobeck]] ([[Kathy Kinney]]) would give birth to Drew's nephew.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18524276.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307163018/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18524276.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 7, 2016|title=TV funnyman doesn't need glasses anymore|last=Gray|first=Ellen|date=January 25, 2001|work=[[The Charleston Gazette]]|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Carey said Drew's coma would feature special effects and Dan Doran, a publicist for the show, added \"When he slips into the coma, he kind of goes into this fantasy world where nothing goes wrong.\"<ref name=\"Morrow\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1696&dat=20010202&id=pPgcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KZgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3528,143295|title=Actor Drew Carey likes playing dead|last=Morrow|first=Terry|date=February 2, 2001|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}</ref> Terry Morrow from the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' thought \"Drew's in a Coma\" had a simple concept compared to previous stunt episodes, which the show employed to keep things fresh.

The plot of the episode sees [[List of The Drew Carey Show characters#Drew Carey|Drew]] ([[Drew Carey]]) left in a [[coma]] after he is hit by a car. Drew entertains himself through a fantasy world he creates, while his friends try various things to get him to wake up. At the end of the episode, Drew chooses whether to go to heaven or not and his sister-in-law, [[Mimi Bobeck|Mimi]] ([[Kathy Kinney]]), goes into labor. The episode was written by Les Firestein and directed by [[Gerry Cohen (director)|Gerry Cohen]]. It first aired on February 7, 2001 on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network in the United States.\n\nThe episode was the first of \"a two-part event\" that aired during the February [[sweeps]]. Drew's fantasy world featured special effects and appearances from historical figures, [[Ben Stein]] and [[Joe Walsh]]. The show's theme tune was temporarily replaced with \"[[Girlfriend in a Coma (song)|Girlfriend in a Coma]]\" by [[The Smiths]]. \"Drew's in a Coma\" finishing in 26th place in the ratings for the week it aired. Critical response was mostly positive, with reporters calling the plot funny, strange and surreal. Editor John Fuller was recognised for his work on the episode with a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\n==Plot==\nAs Drew runs for his bus, he suddenly finds himself flying above [[Cleveland]]. He encounters [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] (John Valdetero), who invites him to a party, and a little boy (Charlie Stewart) who asks him to do somersaults. The scene then cuts to Drew's friends [[Kate O'Brien (The Drew Carey Show)|Kate]] ([[Christa Miller]]), [[Lewis Kiniski|Lewis]] ([[Ryan Stiles]]) and [[Oswald Lee Harvey|Oswald]] ([[Diedrich Bader]]) standing by a comatose Drew's bedside. Oswald shakes Drew to wake him up, while Kate tries shouting and then talking to Drew. Drew's brother, [[Steve Carey|Steve]] ([[John Carroll Lynch]]) and his wife, [[Mimi Bobeck|Mimi]] ([[Kathy Kinney]]), arrive and Mimi kisses Drew, but he still does not wake. While he is in his coma, Drew creates a fantasy world with beautiful women, a pizza tree and a beer fountain.\n\nMimi becomes Drew's slave and she turns on a television screen which shows Drew what is happening at the hospital. The doctor ([[David Purdham]]) gives Drew an injection to wake him up, but it does not work, as Drew refuses to leave the coma because he is having fun. The doctor then suggests removing Drew from the respirator, so he will have to fight to come out of the coma or die. Drew's friends surround him with his favourite things, try talking to him again and Ed ([[Joe Walsh]]) plays Drew's favourite song. Steve allows the doctor to remove Drew from the respirator and Drew's fantasy world disappears. A heavenly guide ([[Ben Stein]]) appears and tells Drew he has passed the test to get into heaven, but he must decide if he wants to go to now or go back to living. As Drew heads towards the light, Mimi goes into labor.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:JoeWalshSept06.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The episode featured an appearance by [[Joe Walsh]].]]\nIn January 2001, [[Drew Carey]] told ''[[The Charleston Gazette]]'s'' Ellen Gray that during the February [[sweeps]], his character would be going into a coma, while [[Mimi Bobeck]] ([[Kathy Kinney]]) would give birth to Drew's nephew.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18524276.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307163018/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18524276.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 7, 2016|title=TV funnyman doesn't need glasses anymore|last=Gray|first=Ellen|date=January 25, 2001|work=[[The Charleston Gazette]]|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Carey said Drew's coma would feature special effects and Dan Doran, a publicist for the show, added \"When he slips into the coma, he kind of goes into this fantasy world where nothing goes wrong.\"<ref name=\"Morrow\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1696&dat=20010202&id=pPgcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KZgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3528,143295|title=Actor Drew Carey likes playing dead|last=Morrow|first=Terry|date=February 2, 2001|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}</ref> Terry Morrow from the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' thought \"Drew's in a Coma\" had a simple concept compared to previous stunt episodes, which the show employed to keep things fresh.
