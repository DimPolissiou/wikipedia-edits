Mormon missionaries may serve on a full- or part-time basis, depending on the assignment, and are organized geographically into [[Mission (LDS Church)|missions]]. The mission assignment could be to any one of the [[List of missions of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|399]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/topic/missionary-program|title=Missionary Program|website=www.newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org|access-date=April 13, 2020}}</ref> missions organized worldwide.\n\nThe LDS Church is one of the most active modern practitioners of [[missionary]] work, reporting that it had more than 67,000 full-time missionaries and 31,000 service missionaries worldwide at the end of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.deseret.com/platform/amp/faith/2020/4/4/21208195/mormon-church-membership-numbers-statistical-report-lds-general-conference|title=Latter-day Saint membership increased this much in 2019, according to new church statistical report|website=www.deseret.com|access-date=April 13, 2020}}</ref>. Most full-time LDS missionaries are single young men and women in their late teens and early twenties and older couples no longer with children in their home. Missionaries are often assigned to serve far from their homes, including in other countries. Many missionaries learn a new language at a [[missionary training center]] as part of their assignment. Missions typically last two years for males, 18 months for females, and 1 to 3 years for older couples. The LDS Church strongly encourages, but does not require, missionary service for young men. All Mormon missionaries serve voluntarily and do not receive a salary for their work; they typically finance missions themselves or with assistance from family or other church members. Many Latter-day Saints save money during their teenage years to cover their mission expenses.\n\nThroughout the [[History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|church's history]], over one million missionaries have been sent on missions.<ref name = onemillion1>{{citation |url= https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/one-million-missionaries-thirteen-million-members |title= News Story {{ndash}} One Million Missionaries, Thirteen Million Members |work= Newsroom |publisher= LDS Church |date= June 25, 2007 |accessdate= 2012-11-27 }}</ref><ref name = onemillion2>{{citation |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/680194052/1-million-missionaries-for-LDS-Church--so-far.html |title= 1 million missionaries for LDS Church \u2013 so far |last= Walch |first= Tad |newspaper= Deseret Morning News |date= June 26, 2007 |accessdate= 2012-11-27 }}</ref>\n\n==Preparation to serve==\n===Significance and basic qualifications===\nLDS Church [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]] [[Spencer W.

This expectation is based in part on the [[New Testament]] passage \"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations\" ([[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 28|Matt. 28: 19\u201320]]).

Women generally serve as missionaries for 18 months.

In the last two decades, the LDS Church has stepped up its call for senior couple missionaries.\n\n===Standards of worthiness===\nAll missionaries must meet certain minimum standards of worthiness. Among the standards that a prospective missionary must demonstrate adherence to are: regular attendance at [[Worship services of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|church meetings]], regular personal [[prayer]], regular study of the [[Standard Works|scriptures]], adherence to the [[law of chastity]] (sexual purity), adherence to the [[Word of Wisdom]] (code of health and nutrition), payment of [[tithe|tithing]], spiritual diligence and testimony of God.\n\n===Other exclusionary factors===\nIn addition to spiritual preparedness, church [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishops]] are instructed to ensure that prospective missionaries are physically, mentally, and emotionally capable of full-time missionary work. In the same speech where he called for \"every young man\" to fill a mission, Kimball added, \"we realize that while all men definitely should, all men are not prepared to teach the gospel abroad.\"<ref name=kimball /> Apart from general issues of worthiness and ability, there are a number of specific situations that will disqualify a person from becoming a full-time missionary for the LDS Church. Those excluded include those who would have to leave dependent children in the care of someone else; young couples who are still of childbearing age; those who are in debt and have not made arrangements to meet these obligations; those who are on legal probation or parole; couples with serious unresolved marital problems; those who are HIV-positive; and those who have been convicted of sexual abuse. Additionally, members who have submitted to, performed, encouraged, paid for, or arranged for an abortion (except in the case of rape, incest, or the mother's life is in danger) are usually excluded from missionary service, as are members who have fathered or borne a child out of wedlock; men under 26 and women under 40 who have been divorced; and anyone who has participated in homosexual activity after age 16.<ref>{{cite book |title= [[Church Handbook of Instructions]], Book 1: Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics |location= Salt Lake City |publisher= LDS Church |year= 2006 |pages= 92\u201394 }}</ref>\n\nFrom the beginnings of the LDS Church, people of black African descent could be members of the church, but up until 1978 the LDS Church did not call men of black African descent to serve on missions, due to the [[Black people and Mormonism|ban on blacks holding the priesthood]]. The priesthood ban [[Official Declaration\u20142|was lifted]] during [[Spencer W.

The mission call also informs the prospective missionary what language he or she will be expected to use during their mission. Members of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] are responsible for assigning missionaries to a particular mission. A prospective missionary receiving the call to serve is generally considered to be a major event in LDS culture; family members, friends, and members of the prospective missionary's congregation often gather together when a call arrives, which the prospective missionary opens and reads aloud to the group. Until 2018, mission calls were mailed to prospective missionaries.  In the summer of 2018, the church announced they would begin emailing mission calls to prospective missionaries. The church began emailing calls to prospective missionaries residing in Utah and Idaho in the summer of 2018, with the goal of expanding to the rest of the United States and all countries with reliable internet by the beginning of 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/news/from-snail-mail-to-email-mission-calls-are-going-digital?lang=eng|title=From \"Snail Mail\" to Email: Mission Calls Are Going Digital - Church News and Events|website=ChurchofJesusChrist.org|access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref>\n\n===Temple attendance===\nBefore beginning their mission, prospective male missionaries are usually [[ordination|ordained]] to the office of an [[Elder (Mormonism)|elder]] in the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek Priesthood]] (if they do not hold this office already). All missionaries are [[setting apart|set apart]] by the [[laying on of hands]] to preach the gospel; this is usually performed by the missionary's [[stake president]].

Missionaries who will not be learning a language in order to serve their missions spend three weeks at an MTC where they practice using proselytizing materials, learn expected conduct, and study the [[Standard Works|scriptures]]. Missionaries bound for foreign-language missions spend six to nine weeks at an MTC, depending on the language to be learned. During this period, they are encouraged not to speak in their native tongue but rather to immerse themselves in the new language.\n\n==Missionary conduct==\n===The Missionary Handbook===\nThe basic standards of missionary service and conduct are contained in the ''Missionary Handbook''.<ref name=\"MissionaryHandbook\">{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/news/changes-to-missionaries-daily-schedule-allows-more-time-to-teach-gospel?lang=eng|title=Missionary Handbook|date=July 7, 2014|website=churchofjesuschrist.org|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc.|accessdate=August 4, 2018}}</ref> Missionaries are instructed that following these standards will protect them both physically and spiritually.

For women, modest and professional dresses or blouses and mid-calf length skirts were worn.\n\nIn 2013,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865583066/LDS-Church-tweaks-dress-and-grooming-requirements-for-missionaries.html|title=LDS Church tweaks dress and grooming requirements for missionaries|last=Walker|first=Joseph|date=2013-07-12|website=DeseretNews.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-05}}</ref> the LDS Church updated their grooming standards. Young men were no longer required to wear dark suits or a full suit during regular everyday proselytizing activities. They must, however, remain in professional, conservative attire. For instance, a light colored suit is acceptable. They are also allowed to wear a sweater or suit vest over their dress shirt and are encouraged to wear colored ties.<ref>{{cite web|title=Missionary: Dress and Grooming|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/callings/missionary/dress-grooming?lang=eng|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc.|website=churchofjesuschrist.org|accessdate=March 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSister (female) missionaries may wear skirts and dresses that cover their knees.

They are both carrying backpacks and wearing white dress shirts, ties and slacks. The one on the right is wearing a short-sleeved shirt and tan slacks]]\nIn some areas these standards are altered slightly according to the discretion of the [[mission president]]. For example, in hot, humid climates, suit coats are not required, and dress shirts may be short-sleeved. Casual clothes may be worn only in limited circumstances, such as when missionaries provide manual labor or exercise.<ref>{{cite web|title=Missionary Dress and Grooming: Elders: General Guidelines|url=https://missionary.lds.org/clothing/elder/guidelines?lang=eng|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc.|website=LDS.org|accessdate=August 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, the dress guidelines were updated to allow for \"simple and conservative\" sunglasses and \"wide-brimmed hats\" as part of a missionary's attire to provide missionaries protection from excessive heat.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Morgan|title=Updated LDS Missionary dress and grooming guidelines allow for sunglasses|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865654548/Updated-LDS-missionary-dress-and-grooming-guidelines-allow-for-sunglasses.html|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|date=May 18, 2016|accessdate=August 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAll full-time missionaries wear a name tag that gives their surname with the appropriate title (\"Elder\" or \"Sister\" in English-speaking areas, or their equivalent titles in other languages). The name tag also bears the church's name, unless the mission president considers this inadvisable due to circumstances in the area (e.g., adverse political conditions). Missionaries are required to wear the tag at all times in public.\n\n===Companionships===\nA ''missionary companionship'', consisting of two (or occasionally, three) missionaries, is the smallest organizational unit of a mission. Every missionary is assigned by the [[mission president]] to be another missionary's ''companion''. Missionary companionships are generally maintained for months at a time and most missionaries will have served with multiple companions by the end of their mission. These companions very rarely have prior acquaintance outside of the mission. Companionships are always of the same gender.\n\nMissionary companions are instructed to stay together at all times and not to go out of the hearing of their companion's voice or out of sight.<ref name=\"MissionaryHandbook\"/>{{rp|30\u201331}} Privacy is allowed only for personal care such as showering. One of the intentions of this strict policy of staying together is to discourage missionaries from breaking any mission rules.<ref name=\"MissionaryHandbook\"/>{{rp|31}} Companions share the same living quarters and the same bedroom, but not the same bed.<ref name=\"MissionaryHandbook\"/>{{rp|31}}\n\nWhen companions have conflicting personalities or interests, they are encouraged to try to resolve them themselves. If a missionary's companion is having difficulty with the work or with personal problems, missionaries are instructed to give criticism constructively, in private and with respect.<ref name=\"MissionaryHandbook\"/>{{rp|30}} In dealing with a problem, missionaries are first to raise the issue with their companion and if it is not resolved, to raise it with the mission president. \"A missionary's first priority is to the Lord, then to the mission president and finally to their companion\", as the missionary handbook states.<ref name=\"MissionaryHandbook\"/>{{rp|32}} High value is placed on the spiritual commitment to the virtues of humility and love. Missionaries are urged to treat the companionship as a relationship that must succeed in being cooperative and selfless, thus improving the spirituality, character and social skills of each individual missionary.\n\n===Senior couples===\nSenior couples serve as a companionship for the entirety of their mission and have more relaxed rules. Unlike single missionaries, they share the same bed and are able to travel outside of the mission boundaries.\n\nCouples are not expected to follow the same proselyting schedule of younger missionaries. Some mission rules established for younger missionaries may not apply to them. However, they should still set standards and goals and follow the same dress and grooming standards listed for younger missionaries. The  mission president may assign them responsibilities other than those they received with their call. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/missionary-handbook/appendix-a?lang=eng|title=Appendix A: Guidelines for Couples and Senior Sisters|website=www.churchofjesuschrist.org|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref>\n\n===Personal relationships===\nMissionaries are encouraged to write a letter to their parents weekly. Since almost all of their time is otherwise occupied, other communication is limited. However, a missionary may use preparation day to correspond with any person that is resident outside of the boundaries of the mission. Missionaries do not go on vacation and, prior to February 2019, were permitted to telephone their parents only on Christmas Day, and one other day of the year, usually [[Mother's Day]].<ref name=\"MissionaryHandbook\"/>{{rp|37}} Missionaries are provided with a free, filtered church e-mail account to correspond with their parents on preparation day only by using a computer in a public location, such as a [[public library]] or [[internet caf\u00e9]].<ref name=\"MissionaryHandbook\"/>{{rp|20}} In the event of an emergency, family members of a missionary may contact him or her via the mission president's office. In February 2019, the church announced that missionaries could communicate with their families weekly via phone call, text, or video chat, in addition to letters and email; though the missionaries themselves must initiate the conversation.<ref>[https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/missionaries-family-communication Missionaries Now Have More Options to Communicate With Families], ''Mormon Newsroom'', 15 February 2019. Retrieved 20 February 2019.</ref>\n\nSingle missionaries are prohibited from dating or courting while serving missions. The policy of companionships staying together at all times serves to discourage these activities. While missionaries may interact with members of the opposite sex, they may never be alone with them or engage in any kind of intimate physical or emotional activity (e.g., kissing, hugging, holding hands, flirting). They may not telephone, write, e-mail, or accept letters from members of the opposite sex that live in the area where they are assigned to proselytize.<ref name=\"MissionaryHandbook\"/>{{rp|33}} Missionary companionships are also asked not to visit with members of the opposite sex unless at least one person of the missionaries' same sex is present to chaperone.<ref name=\"MissionaryHandbook\"/>{{rp|34}} Alternatively, those contacts may be referred to a companionship of the same gender as the contact or to married couple missionaries, when available.\n\nIn the early days of the Church, men were called to serve missions regardless of marital status. Today, however, married young men are not expected to serve missions, unless called to oversee a mission as a [[mission president]]. A call to be a mission president is typically extended to the married couple, and in turn, the entire family of the chosen mission president. Older retired couples also may serve as missionaries, but do not take their families with them.\n\n===Schedule===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:80%;\" align=\"right\"\n|+ style=\"font-size:150%;\" | Sample schedule of missionaries serving in their native language\n|-\n! !! colspan=\"34\" align=\"center\" | Time\n|-\n!

For many years,missionaries used structured lessons called \"missionary discussions\" (formally called \"The Uniform System for Teaching the Gospel\") to teach interested non-members and recent converts about the doctrines of the LDS Church and to commit them on the steps to take to become a member of the church. Missionaries were often instructed to adhere very closely to the six lessons, and they frequently quoted segments word-for-word (an especially helpful practice when learning a foreign language). The training materials also instructed missionaries to freely change the order of the lessons segments according to the needs and questions of the learners.\n\nThe missionary discussions were replaced beginning in October 2004 by a guide called ''Preach My Gospel'' which places emphasis on \"teaching by the Spirit\".<ref>{{lds|Doctrine & Covenants|dc|50|14}}</ref> According to members of the church, \"teaching by the Spirit\" means seeking guidance from the Holy Ghost to teach; the idea is that the teachings will be catered to each person who is seeking the truth through divine guidance. According to ''Preach My Gospel'', God knows each of His children and can guide His servants to say and teach what is best for each individual.<ref name=\"Preach My Gospel\">{{citation |title= Preach My Gospel |year= 2004 |publisher= LDS Church |url= http://www.lds.org/languages/additionalmanuals/preachgospel/PreachMyGospel___00_00_Complete__36617_eng_.pdf|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090503060500/http://www.lds.org/languages/additionalmanuals/preachgospel/PreachMyGospel___00_00_Complete__36617_eng_.pdf|url-status= dead|archive-date= 2009-05-03}}</ref>{{rp|89\u201390}}\n\nDespite the latitude given to missionaries, the guide still contains material which should be actively taught. Chapter 3 of ''Preach My Gospel'' concisely describes all of the doctrine that the missionaries are to teach to those learning about the church. The missionaries are responsible for knowing the doctrine and continually preparing to teach it. They can choose the order that this material is taught to serve the needs of each individual. This is a change from the missionary discussions which were usually taught in order to each investigator.\n\nThe book, now published in many languages,<ref>{{citation |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2007/11/preach-my-gospel-the-unifying-tool-between-members-and-missionaries?lang=eng |title= Preach My Gospel\u2014the Unifying Tool between Members and Missionaries |authorlink= Erich W.

Many fully able missionaries are called to do genealogical research or act as tour guides or hosts at [[Temple Square]] or [[Family History Library|Family History libraries]] and other church sites. In many areas, even proselytizing missionaries spend most of their day responding to incoming phone calls and queries, delivering requested media from the church's television and radio commercials. Missionaries may use [[public transit|public transportation]], [[walk]], bicycle, or in some areas drive automobiles owned by the church, or occasionally ride within a private automobile with a church member who is accompanying them to a teaching appointment, proselytizing, or [[wikt:fellowshipping|fellowshipping]] activity.

These [[Humanitarian Services|humanitarian missionaries]] typically serve in impoverished areas of the world and do not actively proselytize. Humanitarian missionaries comply with any local laws regarding teaching or displaying religious symbols, including the identifying name tags. This allows them to provide services and aid in countries where activities by religious organizations are typically restricted or forbidden, such as in predominantly Muslim countries or in Southeast Asia. Regular proselytizing missionaries are asked to engage in welfare activities and [[community service]], limited to four hours a week on days other than weekends or preparation day.<ref>{{citation |last= Florence|first= Giles H., Jr. |title= Called to Serve |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |page= 13 |date=September 1991 |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1991/09/called-to-serve?lang=eng |accessdate= 2012-11-27}}</ref>\n\nBuilding missionaries were called by the president of the Tongan Mission in the early 1950s.<ref>{{citation |authorlink= R.

From 1955 on, [[Wendell B. Mendenhall]] institutionalized building missionaries on a larger scale with skilled tradesmen called as supervisors of the missionaries. Most of the supervisors were Americans, while most of the workers were young men indigenous to the areas of the South Pacific and Latin America where the work was carried out. However, at times the situation was more complex. One example is Jose Alvarez, who was a native of Argentina, but had lived in the United States for three years when he was called to go with his family to Chile, where he served as a building missionary supervisor.<ref>{{citation |newspaper=[[Church News]] |date= May 12, 2007 |first= John L. |last= Hart |title= 'Always together' \u2014 Church, couple matured together: Elder Claudio Zivic always willing to 'go and do' duty |url= https://www.thechurchnews.com/archive/2007-05-12/always-together-151-church-couple-matured-together-30388 |accessdate= 2012-11-27}}.</ref> Often, trainee or assistant building supervisors would work under the leadership of an experienced supervisor in preparation for an assignment as a fully-fledged supervisor of some project or group of missionaries.\n\n==Administration==\n===Organization===\n{{Main|Mission (LDS Church)}}\nEvery part of the world is assigned to be within a ''mission'' of the church, whether or not LDS missionaries are active in the area. An adult male [[mission president]] presides over the missionaries in the mission.\n\nMost missions are divided into several ''zones'', a zone being a geographic area specified by the mission president (though these are often the same area as the LDS ecclesiastical unit known as a \"stake\"). A zone encompasses several more organizational units called ''districts''. Each zone and district is presided over by leaders drawn from male missionaries serving in that area. Zone and district leaders are responsible for gathering weekly statistics, assisting missionaries in their areas of responsibility, and general accountability to the mission president for the well-being and progress of the missionaries under their stewardship. A district typically encompasses four to eight missionaries, and may or may not comprise more than one proselytizing area. An ''area'' is typically a portion of the LDS ecclesiastical unit known as a ward (or congregation), one ward, or multiple wards.\n\nIn addition to the leaders mentioned above, the mission president has two or more assistants. Assistants to the President (APs) are typically missionaries who have previously served as district and/or zone leaders. They serve as the president's executive assistants, administering policies and helping missionaries throughout the mission.\n\nThe number of missions in the church typically varies from one year to the next.  The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles determine when new missions are created, consolidated, or discontinued. In October 2017, the church announced that, in an effort to increase missionary safety, the number of missions would be consolidated.<ref name=\"Missionary Change Primer 2017\" /> The extent of those consolidation plans is yet to be announced.\n\n===Expenses===\n{{see also|Davis v. United States (1990)}}\nMissionaries are expected to pay their own expenses while on the mission, often with assistance from family. In the past, each missionary paid his or her actual living expenses, but this approach created a disproportionate burden on missionaries who were assigned to more expensive areas of the world. In 1990, a new program was introduced to equalize the financial responsibility for each missionary and his or her family. Now, all young missionaries pay a flat monthly rate which is then redistributed according to regional costs of living. The cost of a mission varies based on the country of origin of the missionary; for missionaries from the United States, the cost is US$400 per month.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bolingbroke|first1=Bruce|title=Benefits of equal costs for LDS missions|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865625380/Benefits-of-equal-costs-for-LDS-missions.html?pg=all|accessdate=30 March 2016|newspaper=Deseret News|date=2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Fletcher Stack|first=Peggy|author-link=Peggy Fletcher Stack|title=Rising Mormon missionary numbers spur call for more donations|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/blogsfaithblog/56404563-180/church-lds-missionaries-missionary.html.csp|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=June 3, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118123443/http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/blogsfaithblog/56404563-180/church-lds-missionaries-missionary.html.csp|archivedate=November 18, 2015|accessdate=August 4, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The cost can vary dramatically based on the country of origin. For instance, in Oceania, missionaries from Australia pay AU$395 and missionaries from New Zealand pay NZ$400, while missionaries from American Samoa pay US$85 and missionaries from Kiribati pay AU$20. Missionaries from Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu are exempt from making any payment.<ref>Pacific Area Presidency, \"Financing Full-time Missionary Service\" (letter to Area Seventies, Stake, Mission, and District Presidents; Bishops and Branch Presidents), 28 August 2014.</ref> The monthly rate helps to cover food, lodging, transportation, and other mission related expenses. Missionaries are asked to bring extra personal money for any personal items they would like to purchase. Once the money is received by the church it is then redistributed to the missionaries in amounts proportionate to the cost of living within the assigned mission area. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} As families now contribute to a general fund for missionary expenses, the sum is deductible under many nations' tax policies regarding charitable gifts.\n\nFor health care, the church provides missionaries with limited medical care. A missionary will be required to pay for any medical treatment that is considered non-essential or that is considered to be associated with a preexisting condition. The local mission office will often help missionaries find Mormon doctors or dentists who can offer their services to missionaries for a small fee or for free.\n\nYoung people in the church are encouraged to save money throughout their childhood and teenage years to pay for as much of their mission as they can, although many receive assistance from parents, family, or friends. Missionaries who cannot save the required funds may obtain assistance from their home [[Ward (LDS Church)|congregation]] or from a general missionary fund operated by the church and contributed to by Latter-day Saints around the world.

The book was presented as evidence of Joseph Smith's prophetic calling. [[Phineas Young]] received a Book of Mormon from Samuel Smith and became an early member of the church. (Phineas' younger brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham]] would later be baptized and become the 2nd president of the LDS Church.)\n\nDuring the 1850s missionaries were sent to Chile, France, Germany, Hawaii, India, Italy, Scandinavia, Switzerland and a number of other countries.<ref name=\"mormonnewsroom.org\">{{cite web|title=History of Missionary Work in the Church|url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/history-of-missionary-work-in-the-church|accessdate=23 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1898, the church began allowing single women to be called as missionaries. The first two single female missionaries were [[Jennie Brimhall]] and [[Inez Knight]], who were called to serve as companions in England.<ref name = mangum>Diane L. Mangum, [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1980/07/the-first-sister-missionaries?lang=eng \"The First Sister Missionaries\"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', July 1980.</ref>\n\nAs more members became aware of Joseph Smith's [[First Vision]] during the late 1800s and early 1900s, it began to take on a prominent role in the conversion narrative. The story of the First Vision was first published in a missionary tract in 1910.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Flake|first1=Kathleen|title=The Politics of American Religious Identity: The Seating of Senator Reed Smoot|date=2005|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press}}</ref>\n\nEach mission was responsible for individually developing lessons until 1952 when, under the direction of [[Gordon B. Hinckley]], the church published \"A Systematic Program for Teaching the Gospel\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Duffy|first1=John-Charles|title=The New Missionary Discussions and the Future of Correlation|journal=Sunstone|url=https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/138-28-46.pdf|accessdate=23 November 2015}}</ref> In 1961, towards the beginning of the church's [[Priesthood Correlation Program|correlation]] effort, \"A Uniform System for Teaching Investigators\" was made mandatory church-wide. The missionary lessons, or discussions as they were often called, continued to be updated with major revisions approximately every decade up until the publication of ''Preach My Gospel'' in 2004. Early missionaries, like Samuel Smith, relied primarily on the story of the Book of Mormon to attract converts to the church. By the late 19th century, the story of Joseph Smith's first vision had gained prominence and was given an important role in the official missionary lessons.<ref>\"Historians have pondered the various phrases of this vision's evolution and tend to see its present form as a 'late development,' only gaining an influential status in LDS self-reflection late in the nineteenth century.\" {{citation |first=Douglas J. |last=Davies |title=An Introduction to Mormonism |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |page=136}}; {{harvnb|Widmer|2000|pp=92\u2013107}}; {{harvnb|Shipps|1985|pp=30\u201332}}.</ref>\n\nIn the early 1950s, [[Henry D. Moyle]] had responsibility over the missionary department. Moyle encouraged missionaries to use a tactic that later became known as \"baseball baptism\". Missionaries\nwould encourage young men to join church-sponsored sports leagues and baptism was imposed as a prerequisite.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Quinn|first1=D. Michael|title=The Mormon 'Baseball Baptism' Era|url=http://mormonstories.org/baseballbaptisms.html|accessdate=22 November 2015}}</ref> The use of this tactic created a large number of converts, especially in England, but very few of the young men ever had any interest in the spiritual aspects of the church. Moyle introduced baptism goals, missionary incentives and other salesmanship techniques into the church missionary department. [[David O. McKay]] eventually removed Moyle from his responsibilities over the missionary program but many of the changes introduced during this time remain even today.\n\nDuring the 1960s, missionaries whose area of service required them to learn a new language were first sent to the Language Training Mission on the [[BYU]] campus. This later became the [[Missionary Training Center]] in 1978 where all new missionaries were sent for training not just the ones learning a language.\n\nStarting during [[Spencer W. Kimball]]'s administration, it was emphasized that \"every able, worthy young man\" had a duty to serve a mission.<ref name=\"mormonnewsroom.org\"/> Prior to this, missionary service for men was not viewed as obligatory. This resulted in an increase in the number of young men choosing to serve missions.\n\nBefore [[1978 Revelation on Priesthood|1978]], the church did not permit people of African descent to hold the priesthood, and they were not actively proselytized. Missionary work in places such as [[Brazil]] may have increased pressure to change the policy due to the difficulty of verifying lack of African descent in these populations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kimball|first1=Edward|title=Spencer W. Kimball and the Revelation on Priesthood}}</ref> When the policy was eliminated by Kimball, additional areas of the world were opened up to missionary work.\n\nChurch researchers discovered that in addition to the content of the lessons, the way in which the material was presented had a major impact on conversion. In 1984, the Missionary Department codified the \"commitment pattern\" as the proper way for missionaries to teach the lessons.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shepherd|first1=Gordon|last2=Shepherd|first2=Gary|title=Membership Growth, Church Activity, and Missionary Recruitment|journal=Dialogue|url=https://dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V29N01_39.pdf|accessdate=23 November 2015}}</ref> This involves the missionaries making specific invitations to act in response to the lessons. Gospel students would be encouraged to make personal commitments to attend church, to read the Book of Mormon and to be baptized.\n\nIn 2002, apostle [[M. Russell Ballard]] delivered a [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conference]] address stating that the bar to qualify for missionary service had been raised and that \"the day of the 'repent and go' missionary is over\".<ref name=\"Ballard\">{{cite web|last=Ballard|first=M.

The musical ''[[Saturday's Warrior]]'' (1973) features missionaries and was made into a film in 1989. The DVD series ''[[Liken the Scriptures]]'' occasionally shows missionaries.\n\nMissionaries were featured in the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary ''[[Get the Fire]]'' (2003), as well as in the [[Tony Award]]-winning satirical Broadway musical ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]''. Hollywood portrayed missionaries in ''[[Yes Man (film)|Yes Man]]'' (2008) starring [[Jim Carrey]], and British film ''[[Millions (2004 film)|Millions]]'' also mentioned missionaries.\n\nFilms portraying missionaries gone astray include ''[[Trapped by the Mormons]]'' (1922), ''[[Orgazmo]]'' (1997) and ''[[Latter Days]]'' (2003).

Missions typically last two years for males, 18 months for females, and 1 to 3 years for older couples. The LDS Church strongly encourages, but does not require, missionary service for young men. All Mormon missionaries serve voluntarily and do not receive a salary for their work; they typically finance missions themselves or with assistance from family or other church members.

In the last two decades, the LDS Church has stepped up its call for senior couple missionaries.\n\n===Standards of worthiness===\nAll missionaries must meet certain minimum standards of worthiness. Among the standards that a prospective missionary must demonstrate adherence to are: regular attendance at [[Worship services of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|church meetings]], regular personal [[prayer]], regular study of the [[Standard Works|scriptures]], adherence to the [[law of chastity]] (sexual purity), adherence to the [[Word of Wisdom]] (code of health and nutrition), payment of [[tithe|tithing]], spiritual diligence and testimony of God.\n\n===Other exclusionary factors===\nIn addition to spiritual preparedness, church [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishops]] are instructed to ensure that prospective missionaries are physically, mentally, and emotionally capable of full-time missionary work. In the same speech where he called for \"every young man\" to fill a mission, Kimball added, \"we realize that while all men definitely should, all men are not prepared to teach the gospel abroad.\"<ref name=kimball /> Apart from general issues of worthiness and ability, there are a number of specific situations that will disqualify a person from becoming a full-time missionary for the LDS Church. Those excluded include those who would have to leave dependent children in the care of someone else; young couples who are still of childbearing age; those who are in debt and have not made arrangements to meet these obligations; those who are on legal probation or parole; couples with serious unresolved marital problems; those who are HIV-positive; and those who have been convicted of sexual abuse. Additionally, members who have submitted to, performed, encouraged, paid for, or arranged for an abortion (except in the case of rape, incest, or the mother's life is in danger) are usually excluded from missionary service, as are members who have fathered or borne a child out of wedlock; men under 26 and women under 40 who have been divorced; and anyone who has participated in homosexual activity after age 16.<ref>{{cite book |title= [[Church Handbook of Instructions]], Book 1: Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics |location= Salt Lake City |publisher= LDS Church |year= 2006 |pages= 92\u201394 }}</ref>\n\nFrom the beginnings of the LDS Church, people of black African descent could be members of the church, but up until 1978 the LDS Church did not call men of black African descent to serve on missions, due to the [[Black people and Mormonism|ban on blacks holding the priesthood]].

The mission call also informs the prospective missionary what language he or she will be expected to use during their mission. Members of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] are responsible for assigning missionaries to a particular mission. A prospective missionary receiving the call to serve is generally considered to be a major event in LDS culture; family members, friends, and members of the prospective missionary's congregation often gather together when a call arrives, which the prospective missionary opens and reads aloud to the group. Until 2018, mission calls were mailed to prospective missionaries.  In the summer of 2018, the church announced they would begin emailing mission calls to prospective missionaries. The church began emailing calls to prospective missionaries residing in Utah and Idaho in the summer of 2018, with the goal of expanding to the rest of the United States and all countries with reliable internet by the beginning of 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/news/from-snail-mail-to-email-mission-calls-are-going-digital?lang=eng|title=From \"Snail Mail\" to Email: Mission Calls Are Going Digital - Church News and Events|website=ChurchofJesusChrist.org|access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref>\n\n===Temple attendance===\nBefore beginning their mission, prospective male missionaries are usually [[ordination|ordained]] to the office of an [[Elder (Mormonism)|elder]] in the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek Priesthood]] (if they do not hold this office already). All missionaries are [[setting apart|set apart]] by the [[laying on of hands]] to preach the gospel; this is usually performed by the missionary's [[stake president]].

Young men were no longer required to wear dark suits or a full suit during regular everyday proselytizing activities. They must, however, remain in professional, conservative attire.

The one on the right is wearing a short-sleeved shirt and tan slacks]]\nIn some areas these standards are altered slightly according to the discretion of the [[mission president]]. For example, in hot, humid climates, suit coats are not required, and dress shirts may be short-sleeved. Casual clothes may be worn only in limited circumstances, such as when missionaries provide manual labor or exercise.<ref>{{cite web|title=Missionary Dress and Grooming: Elders: General Guidelines|url=https://missionary.lds.org/clothing/elder/guidelines?lang=eng|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc.|website=LDS.org|accessdate=August 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, the dress guidelines were updated to allow for \"simple and conservative\" sunglasses and \"wide-brimmed hats\" as part of a missionary's attire to provide missionaries protection from excessive heat.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Morgan|title=Updated LDS Missionary dress and grooming guidelines allow for sunglasses|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865654548/Updated-LDS-missionary-dress-and-grooming-guidelines-allow-for-sunglasses.html|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|date=May 18, 2016|accessdate=August 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAll full-time missionaries wear a name tag that gives their surname with the appropriate title (\"Elder\" or \"Sister\" in English-speaking areas, or their equivalent titles in other languages). The name tag also bears the church's name, unless the mission president considers this inadvisable due to circumstances in the area (e.g., adverse political conditions). Missionaries are required to wear the tag at all times in public.\n\n===Companionships===\nA ''missionary companionship'', consisting of two (or occasionally, three) missionaries, is the smallest organizational unit of a mission. Every missionary is assigned by the [[mission president]] to be another missionary's ''companion''. Missionary companionships are generally maintained for months at a time and most missionaries will have served with multiple companions by the end of their mission. These companions very rarely have prior acquaintance outside of the mission. Companionships are always of the same gender.\n\nMissionary companions are instructed to stay together at all times and not to go out of the hearing of their companion's voice or out of sight.<ref name=\"MissionaryHandbook\"/>{{rp|30\u201331}} Privacy is allowed only for personal care such as showering. One of the intentions of this strict policy of staying together is to discourage missionaries from breaking any mission rules.<ref name=\"MissionaryHandbook\"/>{{rp|31}} Companions share the same living quarters and the same bedroom, but not the same bed.<ref name=\"MissionaryHandbook\"/>{{rp|31}}\n\nWhen companions have conflicting personalities or interests, they are encouraged to try to resolve them themselves. If a missionary's companion is having difficulty with the work or with personal problems, missionaries are instructed to give criticism constructively, in private and with respect.<ref name=\"MissionaryHandbook\"/>{{rp|30}} In dealing with a problem, missionaries are first to raise the issue with their companion and if it is not resolved, to raise it with the mission president. \"A missionary's first priority is to the Lord, then to the mission president and finally to their companion\", as the missionary handbook states.<ref name=\"MissionaryHandbook\"/>{{rp|32}} High value is placed on the spiritual commitment to the virtues of humility and love. Missionaries are urged to treat the companionship as a relationship that must succeed in being cooperative and selfless, thus improving the spirituality, character and social skills of each individual missionary.\n\n===Senior couples===\nSenior couples serve as a companionship for the entirety of their mission and have more relaxed rules. Unlike single missionaries, they share the same bed and are able to travel outside of the mission boundaries.\n\nCouples are not expected to follow the same proselyting schedule of younger missionaries. Some mission rules established for younger missionaries may not apply to them. However, they should still set standards and goals and follow the same dress and grooming standards listed for younger missionaries. The  mission president may assign them responsibilities other than those they received with their call. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/missionary-handbook/appendix-a?lang=eng|title=Appendix A: Guidelines for Couples and Senior Sisters|website=www.churchofjesuschrist.org|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref>\n\n===Personal relationships===\nMissionaries are encouraged to write a letter to their parents weekly. Since almost all of their time is otherwise occupied, other communication is limited. However, a missionary may use preparation day to correspond with any person that is resident outside of the boundaries of the mission. Missionaries do not go on vacation and, prior to February 2019, were permitted to telephone their parents only on Christmas Day, and one other day of the year, usually [[Mother's Day]].<ref name=\"MissionaryHandbook\"/>{{rp|37}} Missionaries are provided with a free, filtered church e-mail account to correspond with their parents on preparation day only by using a computer in a public location, such as a [[public library]] or [[internet caf\u00e9]].<ref name=\"MissionaryHandbook\"/>{{rp|20}} In the event of an emergency, family members of a missionary may contact him or her via the mission president's office. In February 2019, the church announced that missionaries could communicate with their families weekly via phone call, text, or video chat, in addition to letters and email; though the missionaries themselves must initiate the conversation.<ref>[https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/missionaries-family-communication Missionaries Now Have More Options to Communicate With Families], ''Mormon Newsroom'', 15 February 2019. Retrieved 20 February 2019.</ref>\n\nSingle missionaries are prohibited from dating or courting while serving missions. The policy of companionships staying together at all times serves to discourage these activities. While missionaries may interact with members of the opposite sex, they may never be alone with them or engage in any kind of intimate physical or emotional activity (e.g., kissing, hugging, holding hands, flirting). They may not telephone, write, e-mail, or accept letters from members of the opposite sex that live in the area where they are assigned to proselytize.<ref name=\"MissionaryHandbook\"/>{{rp|33}} Missionary companionships are also asked not to visit with members of the opposite sex unless at least one person of the missionaries' same sex is present to chaperone.<ref name=\"MissionaryHandbook\"/>{{rp|34}} Alternatively, those contacts may be referred to a companionship of the same gender as the contact or to married couple missionaries, when available.\n\nIn the early days of the Church, men were called to serve missions regardless of marital status. Today, however, married young men are not expected to serve missions, unless called to oversee a mission as a [[mission president]]. A call to be a mission president is typically extended to the married couple, and in turn, the entire family of the chosen mission president. Older retired couples also may serve as missionaries, but do not take their families with them.\n\n===Schedule===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:80%;\" align=\"right\"\n|+ style=\"font-size:150%;\" | Sample schedule of missionaries serving in their native language\n|-\n! !! colspan=\"34\" align=\"center\" | Time\n|-\n!

For many years,missionaries used structured lessons called \"missionary discussions\" (formally called \"The Uniform System for Teaching the Gospel\") to teach interested non-members and recent converts about the doctrines of the LDS Church and to commit them on the steps to take to become a member of the church. Missionaries were often instructed to adhere very closely to the six lessons, and they frequently quoted segments word-for-word (an especially helpful practice when learning a foreign language). The training materials also instructed missionaries to freely change the order of the lessons segments according to the needs and questions of the learners.\n\nThe missionary discussions were replaced beginning in October 2004 by a guide called ''Preach My Gospel'' which places emphasis on \"teaching by the Spirit\".<ref>{{lds|Doctrine & Covenants|dc|50|14}}</ref> According to members of the church, \"teaching by the Spirit\" means seeking guidance from the Holy Ghost to teach; the idea is that the teachings will be catered to each person who is seeking the truth through divine guidance. According to ''Preach My Gospel'', God knows each of His children and can guide His servants to say and teach what is best for each individual.<ref name=\"Preach My Gospel\">{{citation |title= Preach My Gospel |year= 2004 |publisher= LDS Church |url= http://www.lds.org/languages/additionalmanuals/preachgospel/PreachMyGospel___00_00_Complete__36617_eng_.pdf|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090503060500/http://www.lds.org/languages/additionalmanuals/preachgospel/PreachMyGospel___00_00_Complete__36617_eng_.pdf|url-status= dead|archive-date= 2009-05-03}}</ref>{{rp|89\u201390}}\n\nDespite the latitude given to missionaries, the guide still contains material which should be actively taught. Chapter 3 of ''Preach My Gospel'' concisely describes all of the doctrine that the missionaries are to teach to those learning about the church. The missionaries are responsible for knowing the doctrine and continually preparing to teach it. They can choose the order that this material is taught to serve the needs of each individual. This is a change from the missionary discussions which were usually taught in order to each investigator.\n\nThe book, now published in many languages,<ref>{{citation |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2007/11/preach-my-gospel-the-unifying-tool-between-members-and-missionaries?lang=eng |title= Preach My Gospel\u2014the Unifying Tool between Members and Missionaries |authorlink= Erich W.

Many fully able missionaries are called to do genealogical research or act as tour guides or hosts at [[Temple Square]] or [[Family History Library|Family History libraries]] and other church sites. In many areas, even proselytizing missionaries spend most of their day responding to incoming phone calls and queries, delivering requested media from the church's television and radio commercials. Missionaries may use [[public transit|public transportation]], [[walk]], bicycle, or in some areas drive automobiles owned by the church, or occasionally ride within a private automobile with a church member who is accompanying them to a teaching appointment, proselytizing, or [[wikt:fellowshipping|fellowshipping]] activity.

These [[Humanitarian Services|humanitarian missionaries]] typically serve in impoverished areas of the world and do not actively proselytize. Humanitarian missionaries comply with any local laws regarding teaching or displaying religious symbols, including the identifying name tags. This allows them to provide services and aid in countries where activities by religious organizations are typically restricted or forbidden, such as in predominantly Muslim countries or in Southeast Asia. Regular proselytizing missionaries are asked to engage in welfare activities and [[community service]], limited to four hours a week on days other than weekends or preparation day.<ref>{{citation |last= Florence|first= Giles H., Jr. |title= Called to Serve |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |page= 13 |date=September 1991 |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1991/09/called-to-serve?lang=eng |accessdate= 2012-11-27}}</ref>\n\nBuilding missionaries were called by the president of the Tongan Mission in the early 1950s.<ref>{{citation |authorlink= R.

From 1955 on, [[Wendell B. Mendenhall]] institutionalized building missionaries on a larger scale with skilled tradesmen called as supervisors of the missionaries. Most of the supervisors were Americans, while most of the workers were young men indigenous to the areas of the South Pacific and Latin America where the work was carried out. However, at times the situation was more complex. One example is Jose Alvarez, who was a native of Argentina, but had lived in the United States for three years when he was called to go with his family to Chile, where he served as a building missionary supervisor.<ref>{{citation |newspaper=[[Church News]] |date= May 12, 2007 |first= John L. |last= Hart |title= 'Always together' \u2014 Church, couple matured together: Elder Claudio Zivic always willing to 'go and do' duty |url= https://www.thechurchnews.com/archive/2007-05-12/always-together-151-church-couple-matured-together-30388 |accessdate= 2012-11-27}}.</ref> Often, trainee or assistant building supervisors would work under the leadership of an experienced supervisor in preparation for an assignment as a fully-fledged supervisor of some project or group of missionaries.\n\n==Administration==\n===Organization===\n{{Main|Mission (LDS Church)}}\nEvery part of the world is assigned to be within a ''mission'' of the church, whether or not LDS missionaries are active in the area. An adult male [[mission president]] presides over the missionaries in the mission.\n\nMost missions are divided into several ''zones'', a zone being a geographic area specified by the mission president (though these are often the same area as the LDS ecclesiastical unit known as a \"stake\"). A zone encompasses several more organizational units called ''districts''. Each zone and district is presided over by leaders drawn from male missionaries serving in that area. Zone and district leaders are responsible for gathering weekly statistics, assisting missionaries in their areas of responsibility, and general accountability to the mission president for the well-being and progress of the missionaries under their stewardship. A district typically encompasses four to eight missionaries, and may or may not comprise more than one proselytizing area. An ''area'' is typically a portion of the LDS ecclesiastical unit known as a ward (or congregation), one ward, or multiple wards.\n\nIn addition to the leaders mentioned above, the mission president has two or more assistants. Assistants to the President (APs) are typically missionaries who have previously served as district and/or zone leaders. They serve as the president's executive assistants, administering policies and helping missionaries throughout the mission.\n\nThe number of missions in the church typically varies from one year to the next.  The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles determine when new missions are created, consolidated, or discontinued. In October 2017, the church announced that, in an effort to increase missionary safety, the number of missions would be consolidated.<ref name=\"Missionary Change Primer 2017\" /> The extent of those consolidation plans is yet to be announced.\n\n===Expenses===\n{{see also|Davis v. United States (1990)}}\nMissionaries are expected to pay their own expenses while on the mission, often with assistance from family. In the past, each missionary paid his or her actual living expenses, but this approach created a disproportionate burden on missionaries who were assigned to more expensive areas of the world. In 1990, a new program was introduced to equalize the financial responsibility for each missionary and his or her family. Now, all young missionaries pay a flat monthly rate which is then redistributed according to regional costs of living. The cost of a mission varies based on the country of origin of the missionary; for missionaries from the United States, the cost is US$400 per month.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bolingbroke|first1=Bruce|title=Benefits of equal costs for LDS missions|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865625380/Benefits-of-equal-costs-for-LDS-missions.html?pg=all|accessdate=30 March 2016|newspaper=Deseret News|date=2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Fletcher Stack|first=Peggy|author-link=Peggy Fletcher Stack|title=Rising Mormon missionary numbers spur call for more donations|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/blogsfaithblog/56404563-180/church-lds-missionaries-missionary.html.csp|newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=June 3, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118123443/http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/blogsfaithblog/56404563-180/church-lds-missionaries-missionary.html.csp|archivedate=November 18, 2015|accessdate=August 4, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The cost can vary dramatically based on the country of origin. For instance, in Oceania, missionaries from Australia pay AU$395 and missionaries from New Zealand pay NZ$400, while missionaries from American Samoa pay US$85 and missionaries from Kiribati pay AU$20. Missionaries from Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu are exempt from making any payment.<ref>Pacific Area Presidency, \"Financing Full-time Missionary Service\" (letter to Area Seventies, Stake, Mission, and District Presidents; Bishops and Branch Presidents), 28 August 2014.</ref> The monthly rate helps to cover food, lodging, transportation, and other mission related expenses. Missionaries are asked to bring extra personal money for any personal items they would like to purchase. Once the money is received by the church it is then redistributed to the missionaries in amounts proportionate to the cost of living within the assigned mission area. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} As families now contribute to a general fund for missionary expenses, the sum is deductible under many nations' tax policies regarding charitable gifts.\n\nFor health care, the church provides missionaries with limited medical care. A missionary will be required to pay for any medical treatment that is considered non-essential or that is considered to be associated with a preexisting condition. The local mission office will often help missionaries find Mormon doctors or dentists who can offer their services to missionaries for a small fee or for free.\n\nYoung people in the church are encouraged to save money throughout their childhood and teenage years to pay for as much of their mission as they can, although many receive assistance from parents, family, or friends.

(Phineas' younger brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham]] would later be baptized and become the 2nd president of the LDS Church.)\n\nDuring the 1850s missionaries were sent to Chile, France, Germany, Hawaii, India, Italy, Scandinavia, Switzerland and a number of other countries.<ref name=\"mormonnewsroom.org\">{{cite web|title=History of Missionary Work in the Church|url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/history-of-missionary-work-in-the-church|accessdate=23 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1898, the church began allowing single women to be called as missionaries. The first two single female missionaries were [[Jennie Brimhall]] and [[Inez Knight]], who were called to serve as companions in England.<ref name = mangum>Diane L.

The story of the First Vision was first published in a missionary tract in 1910.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Flake|first1=Kathleen|title=The Politics of American Religious Identity: The Seating of Senator Reed Smoot|date=2005|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press}}</ref>\n\nEach mission was responsible for individually developing lessons until 1952 when, under the direction of [[Gordon B.

The missionary lessons, or discussions as they were often called, continued to be updated with major revisions approximately every decade up until the publication of ''Preach My Gospel'' in 2004. Early missionaries, like Samuel Smith, relied primarily on the story of the Book of Mormon to attract converts to the church. By the late 19th century, the story of Joseph Smith's first vision had gained prominence and was given an important role in the official missionary lessons.<ref>\"Historians have pondered the various phrases of this vision's evolution and tend to see its present form as a 'late development,' only gaining an influential status in LDS self-reflection late in the nineteenth century.\" {{citation |first=Douglas J. |last=Davies |title=An Introduction to Mormonism |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |page=136}}; {{harvnb|Widmer|2000|pp=92\u2013107}}; {{harvnb|Shipps|1985|pp=30\u201332}}.</ref>\n\nIn the early 1950s, [[Henry D. Moyle]] had responsibility over the missionary department. Moyle encouraged missionaries to use a tactic that later became known as \"baseball baptism\". Missionaries\nwould encourage young men to join church-sponsored sports leagues and baptism was imposed as a prerequisite.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Quinn|first1=D. Michael|title=The Mormon 'Baseball Baptism' Era|url=http://mormonstories.org/baseballbaptisms.html|accessdate=22 November 2015}}</ref> The use of this tactic created a large number of converts, especially in England, but very few of the young men ever had any interest in the spiritual aspects of the church. Moyle introduced baptism goals, missionary incentives and other salesmanship techniques into the church missionary department. [[David O. McKay]] eventually removed Moyle from his responsibilities over the missionary program but many of the changes introduced during this time remain even today.\n\nDuring the 1960s, missionaries whose area of service required them to learn a new language were first sent to the Language Training Mission on the [[BYU]] campus. This later became the [[Missionary Training Center]] in 1978 where all new missionaries were sent for training not just the ones learning a language.\n\nStarting during [[Spencer W. Kimball]]'s administration, it was emphasized that \"every able, worthy young man\" had a duty to serve a mission.<ref name=\"mormonnewsroom.org\"/> Prior to this, missionary service for men was not viewed as obligatory. This resulted in an increase in the number of young men choosing to serve missions.\n\nBefore [[1978 Revelation on Priesthood|1978]], the church did not permit people of African descent to hold the priesthood, and they were not actively proselytized. Missionary work in places such as [[Brazil]] may have increased pressure to change the policy due to the difficulty of verifying lack of African descent in these populations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kimball|first1=Edward|title=Spencer W. Kimball and the Revelation on Priesthood}}</ref> When the policy was eliminated by Kimball, additional areas of the world were opened up to missionary work.\n\nChurch researchers discovered that in addition to the content of the lessons, the way in which the material was presented had a major impact on conversion. In 1984, the Missionary Department codified the \"commitment pattern\" as the proper way for missionaries to teach the lessons.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shepherd|first1=Gordon|last2=Shepherd|first2=Gary|title=Membership Growth, Church Activity, and Missionary Recruitment|journal=Dialogue|url=https://dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V29N01_39.pdf|accessdate=23 November 2015}}</ref> This involves the missionaries making specific invitations to act in response to the lessons. Gospel students would be encouraged to make personal commitments to attend church, to read the Book of Mormon and to be baptized.\n\nIn 2002, apostle [[M. Russell Ballard]] delivered a [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conference]] address stating that the bar to qualify for missionary service had been raised and that \"the day of the 'repent and go' missionary is over\".<ref name=\"Ballard\">{{cite web|last=Ballard|first=M.

The DVD series ''[[Liken the Scriptures]]'' occasionally shows missionaries.\n\nMissionaries were featured in the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary ''[[Get the Fire]]'' (2003), as well as in the [[Tony Award]]-winning satirical Broadway musical ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]''. Hollywood portrayed missionaries in ''[[Yes Man (film)|Yes Man]]'' (2008) starring [[Jim Carrey]], and British film ''[[Millions (2004 film)|Millions]]'' also mentioned missionaries.\n\nFilms portraying missionaries gone astray include ''[[Trapped by the Mormons]]'' (1922), ''[[Orgazmo]]'' (1997) and ''[[Latter Days]]'' (2003). Mormon missionaries appeared at the end of the American [[horror film]] ''[[The Strangers (2008 film)|The Strangers]]'' (2008); the missionaries were depicted as children as opposed to young men.\n\nIn 2008, former missionary Chad Hardy was subjected to [[Disciplinary council|church discipline]] after releasing a [[pin-up]] calendar titled \"Men on a Mission\", which consisted of pictures of scantily clad returned missionaries.<ref>Lilly Fowler, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/05/AR2007100502146.html \"Calendar Shows Another Side of Mormons\"], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 2007-10-06, p.

Currently Archosauromorpha encompasses four main groups of reptiles: the stocky, herbivorous [[Allokotosauria|allokotosaurs]] and [[rhynchosaur]]s, the hugely diverse [[Archosauriformes]], and a [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]] grouping of various long-necked reptiles including ''[[Protorosaurus]]'', [[Tanystropheidae|tanystropheids]], and ''[[Prolacerta]]''. Other groups including [[pantestudines]] ([[turtle]]s and their extinct relatives) and the semiaquatic [[Choristodera|choristoderes]] have also been placed in Archosauromorpha by some authors.\n\nArchosauromorpha is one of the most diverse groups of reptiles, but its members can be united by several shared skeletal characteristics. These include laminae on the vertebrae, a posterodorsal process of the premaxilla, a lack of notochordal canals, and the loss of the entepicondylar foramen of the humerus.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== History and definition ==\nThe term Archosauromorpha was first used by [[Friedrich von Huene]] in 1946 to refer to reptiles more closely related to archosaurs than to lepidosaurs. However, there was little consensus on ancient reptile relationships prior to the late 20th century, so the term Archosauromorpha was seldom used until many years after its creation.\n\nThe advent of [[cladistics]] helped to sort out at least some of the relationships within Reptilia, and it became clear that there was a split between the archosaur lineage and the lepidosaur lineage somewhere within the Permian, with certain reptiles clearly closer to archosaurs and others allied with lepidosaurs. [[Jacques Gauthier]] reused the term Archosauromorpha for the archosaur lineage at the 1982 annual meeting of the [[Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology|American Society of Zoologists]], and later used it within his 1984 Ph.D. thesis.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|author1=Jacques Gauthier |author2=Arnold G.

Gauthier used the name \"Trilophosauria\" for this group, but a 2015 study offered an alternative name. This study found that [[Azendohsauridae]], Triassic reptiles previously mistaken for \"[[Sauropodomorpha|prosauropod]]\" dinosaurs, were in fact close relatives of ''Trilophosaurus'' and the rest of [[Trilophosauridae]].

These were the Archosauriformes, a diverse assortment of animals including the famous dinosaurs and [[pterosaur]]s. Two subclades of Archosauriformes survive to the present day: the semiaquatic crocodilians and the last of the feathered dinosaurs: birds. Gauthier used the name Archosauria to refer to what is now called the Archosauriformes; in modern studies, the name Archosauria has a more restricted definition that only includes the ancestors of crocodilians (i.e. [[Pseudosuchia]]) and birds (i.e. [[Avemetatarsalia]]).\n[[File:Protorosaurus speneri.jpg|left|thumb|The skeleton of ''[[Protorosaurus]]'', one of the oldest archosauromorphs and namesake of the problematic group \"[[Protorosauria]]\"]]\nThe final unambiguous members of Archosauromorpha represent the most controversial group. These were the first archosauromorphs to appear, and can be characterized by their long necks, sprawling posture, and carnivorous habits. One name for the group, [[Protorosauria]], is named after ''Protorosaurus'', the oldest archosauromorph known from good remains. Another name, Prolacertiformes, is in reference to a different member, ''Prolacerta''. Protorosauria/Prolacertiformes has had a complicated history, and many taxa have entered and left the group as paleontologists discover and re-evaluate reptiles of the Triassic. By far the most famous of these are tanystropheids such as ''Tanystropheus'', known for having necks longer than their entire body. Other notable genera include ''[[Boreopricea]]'', ''[[Pamelaria]]'', and ''[[Macrocnemus]],'' as well as strange gliding reptiles such as ''[[Sharovipteryx]]'' and ''[[Mecistotrachelos]]''. A landmark 1998 study by David Dilkes completely deconstructed the concept of Prolacertiformes as a traditional [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] group (i.e. one whose members have a single common ancestor). He argued that ''Prolacerta'' was much closer to Archosauriformes than to other \"prolacertiforms\", invalidating the name.<ref name=\"Dilkes98\" /> Likewise, ''Pamelaria'' is now considered an allokotosaur, ''Macrocnemus'' is a tanystropheid, and ''Protorosaurus'' may be too basal (\"primitive\") to form a clade with any of its supposed close relatives.<ref name=\":1\" /> As such, this final group of Archosauromorpha is generally considered [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] or [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]], and few modern studies use it.\n\n=== Disputed members ===\n[[File:Champsosaurus natator.jpg|thumb|250x250px|''[[Champsosaurus]]'', a [[gharial]]-like [[Choristodera|choristodere]] which survived the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event|Cretaceous-Paleocene extinction event]].

One of the most common additions is [[Choristodera]], a group of semiaquatic reptiles with mysterious origins. Although choristodere fossils are only known from the [[Jurassic]] through the [[Miocene]], it is theorized that they first appeared during the Permian alongside the earliest archosauromorphs.

When archosauromorphs first appeared in the fossil record in the Permian, they were represented by long-necked, lightly-built sprawling reptiles with moderately long, tapering snouts. This body plan, similar to that of modern [[monitor lizard]]s, is also shared by Triassic archosauromorphs such as [[Tanystropheidae|tanystropheids]] and ''[[Prolacerta]].'' Other early groups such as trilohpsaurids, azendohsaurids, and rhynchosaurs deviate from this body plan by evolving into stockier forms with semi-erect postures and higher metabolisms. The archosauriforms went to further extremes of diversity, encompassing giant [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs, flying [[pterosaur]]s and birds, semiaquatic [[crocodilia]]ns, [[phytosaur]]s, and [[proterochampsia]]ns, and apex predators such as [[Erythrosuchidae|erythrosuchids]], [[pseudosuchia]]ns, and [[Theropoda|theropod]] dinosaurs. Despite the staggering diversity of archosauromorphs, they can still be united as a clade thanks to several subtle skeletal features.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Skull ===\n[[File:Proterosuchus fergusi skull.png|thumb|291x291px|The skull of ''[[Proterosuchus]]'', an early [[Archosauriformes|archosauriform]]. Note the long rear branch of the downturned [[premaxilla]] and the L-shaped quadratojugal near the jaw joint.|alt=|left]]\nMost archosauromorphs more \"advanced\" than ''Protorosaurus'' possessed an adaptation of the [[premaxilla]] (tooth-bearing bone at the tip of the snout) known as a posterodorsal or postnarial process. This was a rear-facing branch of bone that stretched up below and behind the external [[Nostril|nares]] (nostril holes) to contact the [[nasal bone]]s on the upper edge of the snout. A few advanced archosauriforms reacquired the [[Plesiomorphy and symplesiomorphy|plesiomorphic]] (\"primitive\") state present in other reptiles, that being a short or absent posterodorsal process of the premaxilla, with the rear edge of the nares formed primarily by the [[maxilla]] bones instead. As for the nares themselves, they were generally large and oval-shaped, positioned high and close to the midline of the skull.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMany early archosauromorphs, including ''Protorosaurus'', tanystropheids, ''Trilophosaurus'', and derived rhynchosaurs, have a blade-like [[sagittal crest]] on the [[parietal bone]]s at the rear part of the [[skull roof]], between a pair of holes known as the supratemporal (or upper temporal) fenestrae. However, in other allokotosaurs, the basal rhynchosaur ''[[Mesosuchus]]'', and more crownward archosauromorphs, the sagittal crest is weakly differentiated, although the inner edge of each supratemporal fenestra still possessed a depressed basin of bone known as a supratemporal fossa. Ezcurra (2016) argued that presence of supratemporal fossae and an absence or poor development of the sagittal crest could be used to characterize Crocopoda. He also noted that in almost all early archosauromorphs (and some [[Choristodera|choristoderes]]), the parietal bones have an additional lowered area which extends transversely (from left to right) behind the supratemporal fenestrae and sagittal crest (when applicable).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe [[Infratemporal fenestra|lower temporal fenestra]] is not fully enclosed in early archosauromorphs (and choristoderes) due to alterations to the structure of the [[quadratojugal bone]] at the rear lower corner of the skull. This bone is roughly L-shaped in these taxa, with a tall dorsal process (vertical branch), a short anterior process (forward branch), and a tiny or absent posterior process (rear branch). The bones surrounding the quadratojugal also reconfigure to offset the changes to the quadratojugal. For example, the lower branch of the [[squamosal bone]] is shortened to offset the tall dorsal process of quadratojugal which connects to it. On the other hand, the rear branch [[jugal bone]] lengthens to fill some of the space left by the shortening of the anterior process of the quadratojugal.<ref name=\":3\" /> In archosauriforms, the jugal even re-encloses the lower temporal fenestra. The [[stapes]] are long, thin, and solid, without a perforating hole (stapedial foramen) present in the more robust stapes of other reptiles.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Vertebrae ===\n[[File:Diplodocus carnegii cervical vertebrae.png|thumb|243x243px|Cervical vertebrae from ''[[Diplodocus]]'', a [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] [[dinosaur]] (Archosauriformes).

The centrum (main body) of each vertebra is [[parallelogram]]-shaped, with a front surface typically positioned higher than the rear surface.<ref name=\":1\" /> The transverse processes (rib facets) of these vertebrae extend outwards to a greater extent than in other early reptiles. In many long-necked archosauromorphs, the rib facets are slanted, connecting to [[cervical rib]]s that are often long, thin, and dichocephalous (two-headed).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pritchard|first=Adam C.|last2=Turner|first2=Alan H.|last3=Nesbitt|first3=Sterling J.|last4=Irmis|first4=Randall B.|last5=Smith|first5=Nathan D.|date=2015-03-04|title=Late Triassic tanystropheids (Reptilia, Archosauromorpha) from northern New Mexico (Petrified Forest Member, Chinle Formation) and the biogeography, functional morphology, and evolution of Tanystropheidae|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|language=en|volume=35|issue=2|pages=e911186|doi=10.1080/02724634.2014.911186|issn=0272-4634}}</ref>\n\nThin, plate-like ridges known as laminae develop to connect the vertebral components, sloping down from the elongated transverse processes to the centra.

This hole, present in most other tetrapods, is also absent in choristoderes yet not fully enclosed in some proterosuchids. In many advanced archosauromorphs, the [[Capitulum of the humerus|capitullum]] and [[Trochlea of humerus|trochlea]] (elbow joints) of the humerus are poorly developed. Early archosauromorphs retain well-developed elbow joints, but all archosauromorphs apart from ''Aenigmastropheus'' have a trochlea ([[ulna]] joint) which is shifted towards the outer surface of the humerus, rather than the midpoint of the elbow as in other reptiles. In conjunction with this shift, the [[Olecranon|olecranon process]] of the ulna is poorly developed in archosauromorphs apart from ''Aenigmastropheus'' and ''Protorosaurus''.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Hindlimbs ===\nThe ankle bones of archosauromorphs tend to acquire complex structures and interactions with each other, and this is particularly the case with the large proximal tarsal bones: the [[Talus bone|astragalus]] and [[Calcaneus|calcaneum]]. The calcaneum, for example, has a tube-like outer extension known as a calcaneal tuber in certain archosauromorphs. This tuber is particularly prominent in the ancient relatives of crocodylians, but it first appeared earlier at the last common ancestor of allokotosaurs, rhynchosaurs, and archosauriforms. The presence of a calcaneal tuber (sometimes known as a lateral tuber of the calcaneum) is a synapomorphy of the group Crocopoda, and is also responsible for its name.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Relationships==\nThe cladogram shown below follows the most likely result found by an analysis of turtle relationships using both fossil and genetic evidence by M.S.

Other groups including [[pantestudines]] ([[turtle]]s and their extinct relatives) and the semiaquatic [[Choristodera|choristoderes]] have also been placed in Archosauromorpha by some authors.\n\nArchosauromorpha is one of the most diverse groups of reptiles, but its members can be united by several shared skeletal characteristics.

However, there was little consensus on ancient reptile relationships prior to the late 20th century, so the term Archosauromorpha was seldom used until many years after its creation.\n\nThe advent of [[cladistics]] helped to sort out at least some of the relationships within Reptilia, and it became clear that there was a split between the archosaur lineage and the lepidosaur lineage somewhere within the Permian, with certain reptiles clearly closer to archosaurs and others allied with lepidosaurs. [[Jacques Gauthier]] reused the term Archosauromorpha for the archosaur lineage at the 1982 annual meeting of the [[Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology|American Society of Zoologists]], and later used it within his 1984 Ph.D. thesis.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|author1=Jacques Gauthier |author2=Arnold G.

These were the Archosauriformes, a diverse assortment of animals including the famous dinosaurs and [[pterosaur]]s. Two subclades of Archosauriformes survive to the present day: the semiaquatic crocodilians and the last of the feathered dinosaurs: birds. Gauthier used the name Archosauria to refer to what is now called the Archosauriformes; in modern studies, the name Archosauria has a more restricted definition that only includes the ancestors of crocodilians (i.e. [[Pseudosuchia]]) and birds (i.e. [[Avemetatarsalia]]).\n[[File:Protorosaurus speneri.jpg|left|thumb|The skeleton of ''[[Protorosaurus]]'', one of the oldest archosauromorphs and namesake of the problematic group \"[[Protorosauria]]\"]]\nThe final unambiguous members of Archosauromorpha represent the most controversial group. These were the first archosauromorphs to appear, and can be characterized by their long necks, sprawling posture, and carnivorous habits. One name for the group, [[Protorosauria]], is named after ''Protorosaurus'', the oldest archosauromorph known from good remains. Another name, Prolacertiformes, is in reference to a different member, ''Prolacerta''. Protorosauria/Prolacertiformes has had a complicated history, and many taxa have entered and left the group as paleontologists discover and re-evaluate reptiles of the Triassic. By far the most famous of these are tanystropheids such as ''Tanystropheus'', known for having necks longer than their entire body. Other notable genera include ''[[Boreopricea]]'', ''[[Pamelaria]]'', and ''[[Macrocnemus]],'' as well as strange gliding reptiles such as ''[[Sharovipteryx]]'' and ''[[Mecistotrachelos]]''. A landmark 1998 study by David Dilkes completely deconstructed the concept of Prolacertiformes as a traditional [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] group (i.e. one whose members have a single common ancestor). He argued that ''Prolacerta'' was much closer to Archosauriformes than to other \"prolacertiforms\", invalidating the name.<ref name=\"Dilkes98\" /> Likewise, ''Pamelaria'' is now considered an allokotosaur, ''Macrocnemus'' is a tanystropheid, and ''Protorosaurus'' may be too basal (\"primitive\") to form a clade with any of its supposed close relatives.<ref name=\":1\" /> As such, this final group of Archosauromorpha is generally considered [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] or [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]], and few modern studies use it.\n\n=== Disputed members ===\n[[File:Champsosaurus natator.jpg|thumb|250x250px|''[[Champsosaurus]]'', a [[gharial]]-like [[Choristodera|choristodere]] which survived the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event|Cretaceous-Paleocene extinction event]]. Choristoderes may represent the fifth group of archosauromorphs, but their origin is obscured.]]\nApart from these four groups, Archosauromorpha is sometimes considered to encompass several additional groups of reptiles. One of the most common additions is [[Choristodera]], a group of semiaquatic reptiles with mysterious origins. Although choristodere fossils are only known from the [[Jurassic]] through the [[Miocene]], it is theorized that they first appeared during the Permian alongside the earliest archosauromorphs. Choristoderes share numerous otherwise unique traits with archosauromorphs, but they share an equal or greater number of unique traits with lepidosauromorphs as well, so there is still some debate over their inclusion within either group.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> The [[chameleon]]- or [[tamandua]]-like [[drepanosaur]]s are also semi-regularly placed within Archosauromorpha,<ref name=\"Dilkes98\" /> although some studies have considered them to be part of a much more basal lineage of reptiles.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Pritchard|first=Adam C.|last2=Nesbitt|first2=Sterling J.|date=2017-10-01|title=A bird-like skull in a Triassic diapsid reptile increases heterogeneity of the morphological and phylogenetic radiation of Diapsida|journal=Open Science|language=en|volume=4|issue=10|pages=170499|doi=10.1098/rsos.170499|pmid=29134065|pmc=5666248|issn=2054-5703}}</ref> The aquatic [[thalattosaur]]s<ref name=\":3\" /> and gliding [[Kuehneosauridae|kuehneosaurids]]<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":02\" /> are also irregularly considered archosauromorphs.\n\nGenetic studies have found evidence that modern testudines ([[turtle]]s and [[tortoise]]s) are more closely related to crocodilians than to lizards.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bhart-Anjan S.

When archosauromorphs first appeared in the fossil record in the Permian, they were represented by long-necked, lightly-built sprawling reptiles with moderately long, tapering snouts. This body plan, similar to that of modern [[monitor lizard]]s, is also shared by Triassic archosauromorphs such as [[Tanystropheidae|tanystropheids]] and ''[[Prolacerta]].'' Other early groups such as trilohpsaurids, azendohsaurids, and rhynchosaurs deviate from this body plan by evolving into stockier forms with semi-erect postures and higher metabolisms. The archosauriforms went to further extremes of diversity, encompassing giant [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs, flying [[pterosaur]]s and birds, semiaquatic [[crocodilia]]ns, [[phytosaur]]s, and [[proterochampsia]]ns, and apex predators such as [[Erythrosuchidae|erythrosuchids]], [[pseudosuchia]]ns, and [[Theropoda|theropod]] dinosaurs. Despite the staggering diversity of archosauromorphs, they can still be united as a clade thanks to several subtle skeletal features.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Skull ===\n[[File:Proterosuchus fergusi skull.png|thumb|291x291px|The skull of ''[[Proterosuchus]]'', an early [[Archosauriformes|archosauriform]]. Note the long rear branch of the downturned [[premaxilla]] and the L-shaped quadratojugal near the jaw joint.|alt=|left]]\nMost archosauromorphs more \"advanced\" than ''Protorosaurus'' possessed an adaptation of the [[premaxilla]] (tooth-bearing bone at the tip of the snout) known as a posterodorsal or postnarial process. This was a rear-facing branch of bone that stretched up below and behind the external [[Nostril|nares]] (nostril holes) to contact the [[nasal bone]]s on the upper edge of the snout. A few advanced archosauriforms reacquired the [[Plesiomorphy and symplesiomorphy|plesiomorphic]] (\"primitive\") state present in other reptiles, that being a short or absent posterodorsal process of the premaxilla, with the rear edge of the nares formed primarily by the [[maxilla]] bones instead. As for the nares themselves, they were generally large and oval-shaped, positioned high and close to the midline of the skull.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMany early archosauromorphs, including ''Protorosaurus'', tanystropheids, ''Trilophosaurus'', and derived rhynchosaurs, have a blade-like [[sagittal crest]] on the [[parietal bone]]s at the rear part of the [[skull roof]], between a pair of holes known as the supratemporal (or upper temporal) fenestrae. However, in other allokotosaurs, the basal rhynchosaur ''[[Mesosuchus]]'', and more crownward archosauromorphs, the sagittal crest is weakly differentiated, although the inner edge of each supratemporal fenestra still possessed a depressed basin of bone known as a supratemporal fossa. Ezcurra (2016) argued that presence of supratemporal fossae and an absence or poor development of the sagittal crest could be used to characterize Crocopoda. He also noted that in almost all early archosauromorphs (and some [[Choristodera|choristoderes]]), the parietal bones have an additional lowered area which extends transversely (from left to right) behind the supratemporal fenestrae and sagittal crest (when applicable).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe [[Infratemporal fenestra|lower temporal fenestra]] is not fully enclosed in early archosauromorphs (and choristoderes) due to alterations to the structure of the [[quadratojugal bone]] at the rear lower corner of the skull. This bone is roughly L-shaped in these taxa, with a tall dorsal process (vertical branch), a short anterior process (forward branch), and a tiny or absent posterior process (rear branch). The bones surrounding the quadratojugal also reconfigure to offset the changes to the quadratojugal. For example, the lower branch of the [[squamosal bone]] is shortened to offset the tall dorsal process of quadratojugal which connects to it. On the other hand, the rear branch [[jugal bone]] lengthens to fill some of the space left by the shortening of the anterior process of the quadratojugal.<ref name=\":3\" /> In archosauriforms, the jugal even re-encloses the lower temporal fenestra. The [[stapes]] are long, thin, and solid, without a perforating hole (stapedial foramen) present in the more robust stapes of other reptiles.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Vertebrae ===\n[[File:Diplodocus carnegii cervical vertebrae.png|thumb|243x243px|Cervical vertebrae from ''[[Diplodocus]]'', a [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] [[dinosaur]] (Archosauriformes). As with other long-necked archosauromorphs, sauropods had a complex system of laminae on their vertebrae.|alt=]]\nIn conjunction with their long, S-shaped necks, early archosauromorphs had several adaptations of the [[Cervical vertebrae|cervical]] (neck) [[vertebra]]e, and usually the first few [[Thoracic vertebrae|dorsal]] (back) vertebrae as well. The centrum (main body) of each vertebra is [[parallelogram]]-shaped, with a front surface typically positioned higher than the rear surface.<ref name=\":1\" /> The transverse processes (rib facets) of these vertebrae extend outwards to a greater extent than in other early reptiles. In many long-necked archosauromorphs, the rib facets are slanted, connecting to [[cervical rib]]s that are often long, thin, and dichocephalous (two-headed).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pritchard|first=Adam C.|last2=Turner|first2=Alan H.|last3=Nesbitt|first3=Sterling J.|last4=Irmis|first4=Randall B.|last5=Smith|first5=Nathan D.|date=2015-03-04|title=Late Triassic tanystropheids (Reptilia, Archosauromorpha) from northern New Mexico (Petrified Forest Member, Chinle Formation) and the biogeography, functional morphology, and evolution of Tanystropheidae|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|language=en|volume=35|issue=2|pages=e911186|doi=10.1080/02724634.2014.911186|issn=0272-4634}}</ref>\n\nThin, plate-like ridges known as laminae develop to connect the vertebral components, sloping down from the elongated transverse processes to the centra. Laminae are practically unique to archosauromorphs, being present even in the earliest Permian genera such as ''[[Aenigmastropheus]]'' and ''[[Eorasaurus]].'' However, they are also known to occur in the bizarre semiaquatic reptile ''[[Helveticosaurus]]'',<ref name=\":0\" /> as well as the [[biarmosuchia]]n [[synapsid]] ''[[Hipposaurus]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peecook|first=|display-authors=etal|date=2018|title=VERTEBRAL OSTEOLOGY OF ''HIPPOSAURUS BOONSTRAI'' (THERAPSIDA, BIARMOSUCHIA) FROM THE MIDDLE PERMIAN OF SOUTH AFRICA, WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EVOLUTION OF ARCHOSAUROMORPHA|url=http://vertpaleo.org/Annual-Meeting/Annual-Meeting-Home/SVP-2018-program-book-V4-FINAL-with-covers-9-24-18.aspx|journal=Svp 2018|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> In all adult archosauromorphs with the exception of ''Aenigmastropheus'', the vertebrae lack [[notochord]]al canals, holes which perforate the centra. This also sets the archosauromorphs apart from most other Permian and Triassic reptiles.<ref name=\"Apsisaurus\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Forelimbs ===\nThe [[humerus]] (forearm bone) is solid in archosauromorphs, completely lacking a hole near the elbow known as the [[entepicondylar foramen]]. This hole, present in most other tetrapods, is also absent in choristoderes yet not fully enclosed in some proterosuchids. In many advanced archosauromorphs, the [[Capitulum of the humerus|capitullum]] and [[Trochlea of humerus|trochlea]] (elbow joints) of the humerus are poorly developed. Early archosauromorphs retain well-developed elbow joints, but all archosauromorphs apart from ''Aenigmastropheus'' have a trochlea ([[ulna]] joint) which is shifted towards the outer surface of the humerus, rather than the midpoint of the elbow as in other reptiles. In conjunction with this shift, the [[Olecranon|olecranon process]] of the ulna is poorly developed in archosauromorphs apart from ''Aenigmastropheus'' and ''Protorosaurus''.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Hindlimbs ===\nThe ankle bones of archosauromorphs tend to acquire complex structures and interactions with each other, and this is particularly the case with the large proximal tarsal bones: the [[Talus bone|astragalus]] and [[Calcaneus|calcaneum]]. The calcaneum, for example, has a tube-like outer extension known as a calcaneal tuber in certain archosauromorphs. This tuber is particularly prominent in the ancient relatives of crocodylians, but it first appeared earlier at the last common ancestor of allokotosaurs, rhynchosaurs, and archosauriforms. The presence of a calcaneal tuber (sometimes known as a lateral tuber of the calcaneum) is a synapomorphy of the group Crocopoda, and is also responsible for its name.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Relationships==\nThe cladogram shown below follows the most likely result found by an analysis of turtle relationships using both fossil and genetic evidence by M.S.

The idea was to transform the classroom, where the teacher acted as the game show host and the students were contenders using their own mobile devices. The initial prototype was named Lecture Quiz.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~alfw/lecturequiz|title=Lecture Quiz|access-date=2019-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228014947/http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~alfw/lecturequiz/|archive-date=2013-12-28|url-status=live}}</ref> Lecture Quiz 1.0 was developed in 2006 before real smartphones were available (first iPhone was released June 29, 2007).

The latter was a disadvantage, as the students had to pay out of their own pocket to play Lecture Quiz as the telecom providers at that time charged per megabyte transferred. The first experiment with Lecture Quiz was carried out in a classroom with twenty students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology where the focus was on usability and usefulness.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|last2=\u00d8fsdahl|first2=Terje|last3=M\u00f8rch-Storstein|first3=Ole Kristian|year=2008|title=An evaluation of a mobile game concept for lectures|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=1%2C5&q=%22An+evaluation+of+a+mobile+game+concept+for+lectures%22&btnG=|journal=Conference on Software Engineering Education and Training|publisher=IEEE|volume=21|pages=197\u2013204|via=Google Scholar}}</ref> The results from the experiment showed that Lecture Quiz was relatively easy to use, contributed to increased learning, that it was entertaining, and increased the motivation for attending more lectures. From 2006 to 2011, four versions of Lecture Quiz were developed, where the main changes were related to improved usability, making it easier to create quizzes, and using newer technology for implementation.\n\nLecture Quiz 2.0 was the first prototype where both teacher and student clients had web-interfaces.

A quasi-experiment conducted at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology with 252 students participating investigated the wear-out effect of Kahoot! by comparing students' perception of the system after playing once vs. playing frequently over five months.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|year=2015|title=The wear out effect of a game-based student response system|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=1%2C5&q=%22The+wear+out+effect+of+a+game-based+student+response+system%22&btnG=|journal=Computers & Education|publisher=Elsevier|volume=82|pages=217\u2013227|via=Google Scholar|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2014.11.004|hdl=11250/2496267|hdl-access=free}}</ref> The results did not show any statistically significant reductions in students' engagement, motivation, concentration or perceived learning over time, but there was a significant change in classroom dynamics (less communication among players after five months). The conclusion was that Kahoot! manage to boost students' engagement, motivation, concentration and learning after using it repeatedly for five months. The core factor to keep students' attention after heavy repeated usage was found to be the competitive nature of Kahoot!.\n\nThere is also research that investigates how Kahoot! performs compared to other tools and platforms. In a quasi-experiment with 384 students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Kahoot! was compared to using a paper quiz and a simple polling system called Clicker.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|last2=Zhu|first2=Meng|last3=S\u00e6tre|first3=Rune|year=2016|title=The effect of digitizing and gratifying quizzing in classrooms|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=1,5&q=%22The+Effect+of+Digitizing+and+Gamifying+Quizzing+in+Classrooms%22|journal=European Conference on Games Based Learning|publisher=Academic Conferences and Publishing International|volume=10|pages=729\u2013736|via=Google Scholar}}</ref> The results show statistically significant improvement in motivation, engagement, enjoyment, and concentration for the gamified approach (Kahoot!) compared to the two other. However, the results did not show any significant differences in learning outcomes.\n\nAnother quasi-experiment at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, in which 593 students participated, investigated how the use of points and audio in Kahoot! affects concentration, engagement, enjoyment, learning, motivation and classroom dynamics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|last2=Lieberoth|first2=Andreas|year=2016|title=The effect of points and audio on concentration, engagement, enjoyment, learning, motivation, and classroom dynamics using Kahoot!|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=1%2C5&q=%22The+effect+of+points+and+audio+on+concentration%2C+engagement%2C+enjoyment%2C+learning%2C+motivation%2C+and+classroom+dynamics+using+Kahoot%21%22&btnG=|journal=European Conference on Games Based Learning|publisher=Academic Conferences International Limited|volume=10|pages=737\u2013746|via=Google Scholar}}</ref> The results reveal that there are some significant differences whether audio and points are used in the areas of concentration, engagement, enjoyment and motivation. The worst result was for the case where both audio and points were turned off. The most surprising finding was how classroom dynamics was positively affected by the use of audio.\n\nAccording to research by two students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, the [[network latency]] in accessing the website greatly influences the [[quality of experience]] of the platform, in both longitudinal and cross-section studies, with a sample size N=21.<ref>{{cite thesis|last1=Underdal|first1=Anlaug G\u00e5rdsrud|last2=Sunde|first2=Marthe Thorine|title=Investigating QoE in a Cloud-Based Classroom Response System|date=5 September 2014|hdl=11250/262998}}</ref> It was found that about 70% of the sample size regard Kahoot! as having positive results on all delay levels, while a varying number of students (between 10-20%) report that the platform is too time-consuming, forming a direct relationship with the duration of the delay.\n\nA [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131520300208 literature review containing 93 studies on the effect of using Kahoot! for learning] was published in the journal [https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-and-education Computers & Education] in 2020.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|last2=Tahir|first2=Rabail|year=2020|title=The effect of using Kahoot! for learning \u2013 A literature review|journal=Computers & Education|publisher=Elsevier|volume=149|pages=103818|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103818|doi-access=free}}</ref> This is the first literature review that investigates most published studies (experiments, case studies, surveys, etc.) on how to use Kahoot! affects learning in the classroom.

The main conclusion is that Kahoot! has a positive effect on learning performance, classroom dynamics, attuites, and anxiety, and the main challenges include technical problems, see questions and answers, time stress, afraid of losing, and hard to catch up. Studies included in this review use a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods that reveal among other things that Kahoot! has statistical significant improvement in learning performance compared to traditional teaching and other tools, a statistically significant improvement on students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 perception of lectures, statistically significant improvement in classroom dynamics, and that Kahoot! can reduce students\u2019 anxiety compared to traditional teaching and other tools.\n\n== In popular culture ==\nKahoot!'s growing popularity in schools led to it becoming an [[Internet meme]].

A quasi-experiment conducted at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology with 252 students participating investigated the wear-out effect of Kahoot! by comparing students' perception of the system after playing once vs. playing frequently over five months.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|year=2015|title=The wear out effect of a game-based student response system|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=1%2C5&q=%22The+wear+out+effect+of+a+game-based+student+response+system%22&btnG=|journal=Computers & Education|publisher=Elsevier|volume=82|pages=217\u2013227|via=Google Scholar|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2014.11.004|hdl=11250/2496267|hdl-access=free}}</ref> The results did not show any statistically significant reductions in students' engagement, motivation, concentration or perceived learning over time, but there was a significant change in classroom dynamics (less communication among players after five months). The conclusion was that Kahoot! manage to boost students' engagement, motivation, concentration and learning after using it repeatedly for five months. The core factor to keep students' attention after heavy repeated usage was found to be the competitive nature of Kahoot!.\n\nThere is also research that investigates how Kahoot! perform compared to other tools and platforms. In a quasi-experiment with 384 students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Kahoot! was compared to using a paper quiz and a simple polling system called Clicker.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|last2=Zhu|first2=Meng|last3=S\u00e6tre|first3=Rune|year=2016|title=The effect of digitizing and gratifying quizzing in classrooms|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=1,5&q=%22The+Effect+of+Digitizing+and+Gamifying+Quizzing+in+Classrooms%22|journal=European Conference on Games Based Learning|publisher=Academic Conferences and Publishing International|volume=10|pages=729\u2013736|via=Google Scholar}}</ref> The results show statistically significant improvement in motivation, engagement, enjoyment, and concentration for the gamified approach (Kahoot!) compared to the two other. However, the results did not show any significant differences in learning outcomes.\n\nAnother quasi-experiment at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, in which 593 students participated, investigated how the use of points and audio in Kahoot! affects concentration, engagement, enjoyment, learning, motivation and classroom dynamics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|last2=Lieberoth|first2=Andreas|year=2016|title=The effect of points and audio on concentration, engagement, enjoyment, learning, motivation, and classroom dynamics using Kahoot!|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=1%2C5&q=%22The+effect+of+points+and+audio+on+concentration%2C+engagement%2C+enjoyment%2C+learning%2C+motivation%2C+and+classroom+dynamics+using+Kahoot%21%22&btnG=|journal=European Conference on Games Based Learning|publisher=Academic Conferences International Limited|volume=10|pages=737\u2013746|via=Google Scholar}}</ref> The results reveal that there are some significant differences whether audio and points are used in the areas of concentration, engagement, enjoyment and motivation. The worst result was for the case where both audio and points were turned off. The most surprising finding was how classroom dynamics was positively affected by the use of audio.\n\nAccording to research by two students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, the [[network latency]] in accessing the website greatly influences the [[quality of experience]] of the platform, in both longitudinal and cross-section studies, with a sample size N=21.<ref>{{cite thesis|last1=Underdal|first1=Anlaug G\u00e5rdsrud|last2=Sunde|first2=Marthe Thorine|title=Investigating QoE in a Cloud-Based Classroom Response System|date=5 September 2014|hdl=11250/262998}}</ref> It was found that about 70% of the sample size regard Kahoot! as having positive results on all delay levels, while a varying number of students (between 10-20%) report that the platform is too time-consuming, forming a direct relationship with the duration of the delay.\n\nA [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131520300208 literature review containing 93 studies on the effect of using Kahoot! for learning] was published in the journal [https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-and-education Computers & Education] in 2020.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Alf Inge|last2=Tahir|first2=Rabail|year=2020|title=The effect of using Kahoot! for learning \u2013 A literature review|journal=Computers & Education|publisher=Elsevier|volume=149|pages=103818|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2020.103818|doi-access=free}}</ref> This is the first literature review that investigates most published studies (experiments, case studies, surveys, etc.) on how to use Kahoot! affects learning in the classroom.

One study finds that, \"major government commissions on immigration and crime in the early twentieth century relied on evidence that suffered from aggregation bias and the absence of accurate population data, which led them to present partial and sometimes misleading views of the immigrant-native criminality comparison. With improved data and methods, we find that in 1904, prison commitment rates for more serious crimes were quite similar by nativity for all ages except ages 18 and 19, for which the commitment rate for immigrants was higher than for the native-born. By 1930, immigrants were less likely than natives to be committed to prisons at all ages 20 and older, but this advantage disappears when one looks at commitments for violent offenses.\"<ref name=\":28\">{{Cite journal|title = Immigration, crime, and incarceration in early twentieth-century america |journal = Demography|date = 2009-11-01|issn = 0070-3370|pages = 739\u2013763|volume = 46|issue = 4|doi = 10.1353/dem.0.0076|pmid = 20084827|first = Carolyn|last = Moehling|first2 = Anne Morrison|last2 = Piehl|pmc = 2831353}}</ref>\n\nFor the early twentieth century, one study found that immigrants had \"quite similar\" imprisonment rates for major crimes as natives in 1904 but lower for major crimes (except violent offenses; the rate was similar) in 1930.<ref name=\":28\" /> Contemporary commissions used dubious data and interpreted it in questionable ways.<ref name=\":28\" /> A study by Harvard economist [[Nathan Nunn]], Yale economist [[Nancy Qian]] and LSE economist Sandra Sequeira found that the Age of Mass Migration (1850\u20131920) had no long-run effects on crime rates in the United States.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sequeira|first=Sandra|last2=Nunn|first2=Nathan|last3=Qian|first3=Nancy|date=March 2017 |title=Migrants and the Making of America: The Short- and Long-Run Effects of Immigration during the Age of Mass Migration |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 23289 |doi=10.3386/w23289 |doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==== Terrorism ====\nAccording to a review by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' fact-checker of the available research and evidence, there is nothing to support President Trump's claim that \"the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country.\"<ref name=\":48\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/08/15/president-trumps-claim-that-foreigners-comprise-the-vast-majority-of-terrorism-convictions-since-911/|title=Analysis {{!}} President Trump's claim that foreigners are responsible for 'the vast majority' of terrorism convictions since 9/11|last=|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-08-15}}</ref> The fact-checker noted that the Government Accountability Office had found that \"of the 85 violent extremist incidents that resulted in death since Sept. 12, 2001, 73 percent (62) were committed by far-right-wing violent extremist groups, and 27 percent (23) by radical Islamist violent extremists\".<ref name=\":48\" /> A bulletin by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security also warned in May 2017 that white supremacist groups were \u201cresponsible for a lion\u2019s share of violent attacks among domestic extremist groups\".<ref name=\":48\" /> According to a report by the [[New America (organization)|New America]] foundation, of the individuals credibly involved in radical Islamist-inspired activity in the United States since 9/11, the large majority were US-born citizens, not immigrants.<ref name=\":48\" />\n\nA 2018 paper found no statistically significant evidence that refugee settlements in the United States are linked to terrorism events.<ref name=\":54\" />\n\n==Oceania==\n===Australia===\n{{Further|Immigration to Australia|Crime in Australia}}\n\nA 2019 study found no impact of immigration on crime rates in Australia.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sydes|first=Michelle|date=2019-09-18|title=Immigration, Ethnicity, and Neighborhood Violence: Considering Both Concentration and Diversity Effects|journal=Race and Justice|language=en-US|pages=215336871987518|doi=10.1177/2153368719875183|issn=2153-3687}}</ref> Foreigners are under-represented in the Australian prison population, according to 2010 figures.<ref name=\":34\" /> A 1987 report by the Australian Institute of Criminology noted that studies had consistently found that migrant populations in Australia had lower crime rates than the Australian-born population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aic.gov.au/publications/archive/migration-ethnicity-and-crime-in-australian-society|title=Migration, ethnicity and crime in Australian society|last=Hazlehurst|first=Kayleen|date=2017-11-03|website=Australian Institute of Criminology|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}</ref>\n\nThe alleged link between immigration and criminality has been a longstanding meme in Australian history with many of the original immigrants being convicts. During the 1950s and 1960s, the majority of emigrants to the country arrived from Italy and Greece, and were shortly afterwards associated with local crime.  This culminated in the \"Greek conspiracy case\" of the 1970s, when Greek physicians were accused of defrauding the [[Medibank Private|Medibank]] system. The police were later found to have conducted investigations improperly, and the doctors were eventually cleared of all charges. After the demise of the [[White Australia policy]] restricting non-European immigration, the first large settler communities from Asia emerged. This development was accompanied by a moral panic regarding a potential spike in criminal activity by the [[Triad (underground society)|Triads]] and similar organizations. In 1978, the erstwhile weekly ''The National Times'' also reported on involvement in the local drug trade by Calabrian Italian, Turkish, Lebanese and Chinese dealers.<ref name=\"Emacia\">{{cite web|last=Collins|first=Jock|title=Ethnic Minorities and Crime in Australia: Moral Panic or Meaningful Policy Responses|url=http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/resources/clearinghouse/Ethnic_Minorities_and_Crime.pdf|accessdate=2 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191913/http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/resources/clearinghouse/Ethnic_Minorities_and_Crime.pdf|archivedate=29 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nDiscourse surrounding immigrant crime reached a head in the late 1990s. The fatal stabbing of a Korean teenager in [[Punchbowl, New South Wales|Punchbowl]] in October 1998 followed by a drive-by shooting of the [[Lakemba, New South Wales|Lakemba]] police station prompted then [[New South Wales]] Premier [[Bob Carr]] and NSW Police Commissioner [[Peter Ryan (police officer)|Peter Ryan]] to blame the incidents on Lebanese gangs. Spurred on by the [[War on Terror]], immigrant identities became increasingly criminalized in the popular [[Sydney]] media. By the mid-2000s and the outbreak of the [[2005 Cronulla riots|Cronulla riots]], sensationalist broadcast and tabloid media representations had reinforced existing stereotypes of immigrant communities as criminal entities and ethnic enclaves as violent and dangerous areas.<ref name=\"Emacia\"/>\n\nThe only reliable statistics on immigrant crime in Australia are based on imprisonment rates by place of birth. As of 1999, this data indicated that immigrants from Vietnam (2.7 per 1,000 of population), Lebanon (1.6) and New Zealand (1.6) were over-represented within the national criminal justice system. Compared to the Australian-born (1), immigrants from Italy (0.6), the United Kingdom (0.6), Ireland (0.6) and Greece (0.5) were under-represented.<ref name=\"Emacia\"/>\n\n[[Victoria Police]] said in 2012 that Sudanese and Somali immigrants were around five times more likely to commit crimes than other state residents. The rate of offending in the Sudanese community was 7109.1 per 100,000 individuals, whereas it was 6141.8 per 100,000 for Somalis, and 1301.0 per 100,000 for the wider Victoria community. Robbery and assault said to have been the most common types of crime committed by the Sudanese and Somali residents, with assault purported to represent 29.5% and 24.3% of all offences, respectively. The overall proportion of crime in the state said to have been committed by members of the Sudanese community was 0.92 percent, while it was 0.35 percent for Somali residents.  People born in Sudan and Somalia are around 0.1 and 0.05 per cent, respectively, of Victoria's population. Journalist Dan Oakes, writing in ''[[The Age]]'', noted that individuals arrested and charged might have been falsely claiming to belong to each community.<ref name=\"Taycc\">{{cite news|last=Oakes|first=Dan|title=African youth crime concern|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/african-youth-crime-concern-20120819-24glt.html|accessdate=2 August 2013|work=The Age|date=20 August 2012}}</ref> In 2015, Sudanese-born youths were \"vastly over-represented\" in Victoria Police LEAP data, responsible for 7.44 per cent of alleged home invasions, 5.65 per cent of car thefts and 13.9 per cent of aggravated robberies.<ref>{{cite news|title=Statistics raise questions about calls to deport youth offenders|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-04/statistics-raise-questions-about-calls-to-deport-youth-offenders/8087410|work=ABC News|date=4 December 2016|language=en-AU}}</ref> A similar overrepresentation occurs in [[Kenyan]]-born youths.

The ensuing ''Haile-Michael v Konstantinidis'' case alleged various forms of mistreatment by the public officials in violation of the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]]. In March 2012, an order of discovery was made, whereby established statistician Ian Gordon of the [[University of Melbourne]] independently analysed Victorian Police LEAP data from Flemington and North Melbourne (2005\u20132008). The report concluded that residents from Africa were two and a half times more likely to be subjected to an arbitrary \"stop and search\" than their representation in the population. Although the justification provided for such disproportionate policing measures was over-representation in local crime statistics, the study found that the same police LEAP data in reality showed that male immigrants from Africa on average committed substantially less crime than male immigrants from other backgrounds. Despite this, the latter alleged male offenders were observed to be 8.5 times more likely not to be the subject of a police \"field contact\". The case was eventually settled on 18 February 2013, with a landmark agreement that the Victoria Police would publicly review its \"field contact\" and training processes. The inquiry is expected to help police identify areas where discrimination in the criminal justice system has the potential to or does occur; implement institutional reforms as pre-emptive measures in terms of training, policy and practice; predicate changes on international law enforcement best practices; ammeliorate the local police's interactions with new immigrants and ethnic minorities, as well as with the Aboriginal community; and serve as a benchmark for proper conduct vis-a-vis other police departments throughout the country.<ref name=\"Hmvk\">{{cite web|title=Flemington & Kensington Community Legal Centre \u2013 Race Discrimination Case Documents \u2013 Haile-Michael v Konstantinidis|url=http://www.communitylaw.org.au/flemingtonkensington/cb_pages/race_discrimination_case_documents.php|publisher=Federation of Community Legal Centres|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Soerdhmvnk\">{{cite web|title=Summary of Experts' report - Daniel Haile-Michael & Ors v Nick Konstantinidis & Ors|url=http://www.communitylaw.org.au/flemingtonkensington/cb_pages/files/Summary%20of%20Experts%27%20report.pdf|publisher=Federation of Community Legal Centres|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics regularly publishes characteristics of those incarcerated including country of birth.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the majority of emigrants to the country arrived from Italy and Greece, and were shortly afterwards associated with local crime.  This culminated in the \"Greek conspiracy case\" of the 1970s, when Greek physicians were accused of defrauding the [[Medibank Private|Medibank]] system. The police were later found to have conducted investigations improperly, and the doctors were eventually cleared of all charges. After the demise of the [[White Australia policy]] restricting non-European immigration, the first large settler communities from Asia emerged. This development was accompanied by a moral panic regarding a potential spike in criminal activity by the [[Triad (underground society)|Triads]] and similar organizations. In 1978, the erstwhile weekly ''The National Times'' also reported on involvement in the local drug trade by Calabrian Italian, Turkish, Lebanese and Chinese dealers.<ref name=\"Emacia\">{{cite web|last=Collins|first=Jock|title=Ethnic Minorities and Crime in Australia: Moral Panic or Meaningful Policy Responses|url=http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/resources/clearinghouse/Ethnic_Minorities_and_Crime.pdf|accessdate=2 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191913/http://www.omi.wa.gov.au/resources/clearinghouse/Ethnic_Minorities_and_Crime.pdf|archivedate=29 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nDiscourse surrounding immigrant crime reached a head in the late 1990s. The fatal stabbing of a Korean teenager in [[Punchbowl, New South Wales|Punchbowl]] in October 1998 followed by a drive-by shooting of the [[Lakemba, New South Wales|Lakemba]] police station prompted then [[New South Wales]] Premier [[Bob Carr]] and NSW Police Commissioner [[Peter Ryan (police officer)|Peter Ryan]] to blame the incidents on Lebanese gangs. Spurred on by the [[War on Terror]], immigrant identities became increasingly criminalized in the popular [[Sydney]] media. By the mid-2000s and the outbreak of the [[2005 Cronulla riots|Cronulla riots]], sensationalist broadcast and tabloid media representations had reinforced existing stereotypes of immigrant communities as criminal entities and ethnic enclaves as violent and dangerous areas.<ref name=\"Emacia\"/>\n\nThe only reliable statistics on immigrant crime in Australia are based on imprisonment rates by place of birth. As of 1999, this data indicated that immigrants from Vietnam (2.7 per 1,000 of population), Lebanon (1.6) and New Zealand (1.6) were over-represented within the national criminal justice system. Compared to the Australian-born (1), immigrants from Italy (0.6), the United Kingdom (0.6), Ireland (0.6) and Greece (0.5) were under-represented.<ref name=\"Emacia\"/>\n\n[[Victoria Police]] said in 2012 that Sudanese and Somali immigrants were around five times more likely to commit crimes than other state residents. The rate of offending in the Sudanese community was 7109.1 per 100,000 individuals, whereas it was 6141.8 per 100,000 for Somalis, and 1301.0 per 100,000 for the wider Victoria community. Robbery and assault said to have been the most common types of crime committed by the Sudanese and Somali residents, with assault purported to represent 29.5% and 24.3% of all offences, respectively. The overall proportion of crime in the state said to have been committed by members of the Sudanese community was 0.92 percent, while it was 0.35 percent for Somali residents.  People born in Sudan and Somalia are around 0.1 and 0.05 per cent, respectively, of Victoria's population. Journalist Dan Oakes, writing in ''[[The Age]]'', noted that individuals arrested and charged might have been falsely claiming to belong to each community.<ref name=\"Taycc\">{{cite news|last=Oakes|first=Dan|title=African youth crime concern|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/african-youth-crime-concern-20120819-24glt.html|accessdate=2 August 2013|work=The Age|date=20 August 2012}}</ref> In 2015, Sudanese-born youths were \"vastly over-represented\" in Victoria Police LEAP data, responsible for 7.44 per cent of alleged home invasions, 5.65 per cent of car thefts and 13.9 per cent of aggravated robberies.<ref>{{cite news|title=Statistics raise questions about calls to deport youth offenders|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-04/statistics-raise-questions-about-calls-to-deport-youth-offenders/8087410|work=ABC News|date=4 December 2016|language=en-AU}}</ref> A similar overrepresentation occurs in [[Kenyan]]-born youths.

The ensuing ''Haile-Michael v Konstantinidis'' case alleged various forms of mistreatment by the public officials in violation of the [[Racial Discrimination Act 1975]]. In March 2012, an order of discovery was made, whereby established statistician Ian Gordon of the [[University of Melbourne]] independently analysed Victorian Police LEAP data from Flemington and North Melbourne (2005\u20132008). The report concluded that residents from Africa were two and a half times more likely to be subjected to an arbitrary \"stop and search\" than their representation in the population. Although the justification provided for such disproportionate policing measures was over-representation in local crime statistics, the study found that the same police LEAP data in reality showed that male immigrants from Africa on average committed substantially less crime than male immigrants from other backgrounds. Despite this, the latter alleged male offenders were observed to be 8.5 times more likely not to be the subject of a police \"field contact\". The case was eventually settled on 18 February 2013, with a landmark agreement that the Victoria Police would publicly review its \"field contact\" and training processes. The inquiry is expected to help police identify areas where discrimination in the criminal justice system has the potential to or does occur; implement institutional reforms as pre-emptive measures in terms of training, policy and practice; predicate changes on international law enforcement best practices; ammeliorate the local police's interactions with new immigrants and ethnic minorities, as well as with the Aboriginal community; and serve as a benchmark for proper conduct vis-a-vis other police departments throughout the country.<ref name=\"Hmvk\">{{cite web|title=Flemington & Kensington Community Legal Centre \u2013 Race Discrimination Case Documents \u2013 Haile-Michael v Konstantinidis|url=http://www.communitylaw.org.au/flemingtonkensington/cb_pages/race_discrimination_case_documents.php|publisher=Federation of Community Legal Centres|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Soerdhmvnk\">{{cite web|title=Summary of Experts' report - Daniel Haile-Michael & Ors v Nick Konstantinidis & Ors|url=http://www.communitylaw.org.au/flemingtonkensington/cb_pages/files/Summary%20of%20Experts%27%20report.pdf|publisher=Federation of Community Legal Centres|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics regularly publishes characteristics of those incarcerated including country of birth.

The cinematography was handled by [[Velraj]].\n\nThe film released worldwide on 30 March 2012, to positive reviews. The soundtrack album composed by Anirudh Ravichander, and the song \"Why This Kolaveri Di\" became one of the \"Recently Most Popular (Gold) Videos\".\n\n==Plot==\nAt Ram\u2019s funeral, his wife Janani hallucinates about him running away, and the film flashes back to when Ram and Janani were 12th-grade students, when Ram helps Janani fix her bicycle and tells his friends Kumaran and Senthil that he has a crush on her. When Ram visits Janani, she reciprocates his love. Janani's sister Sumi makes sure that her parents are not aware of their secret relationship.\n\nBack in the present, Janani has a teary conversation with her mother about Ram. Asleep, she experiences another flashback about when her family had a visa to go to the US, but she burned her passport in order to stay with Ram and marry him. They later were given a house by Ram's dad.\n\nAfter Janani is awoken by her maid, she finds a suicide letter from Ram in his coat. She visits Senthil and asks him to reveal what they were hiding from her. A distraught Senthil tells her that when she was leaving for the US, Kumaran got a job in Singapore at the same time. Upon finding out that two of the people closest to him were leaving, Ram becomes more unstable. On a day when Ram took a 3.2 crore loss, he kicks and kills Tom, their dog. This leads Senthil to consult a doctor, who tells him that Ram's actions are symptomatic of bipolar disorder, and if not treated, could lead to suicide. When Senthil tries to warn him, Ram attacks Senthil with a bottle and chair, and later falls unconscious on the road.\n\nThe doctor confirms Ram has severe bipolar disorder, but Ram refuses Senthil's pleas to get admitted because of his love for Janani. To save himself, Ram then goes on a pilgrimage, causing further anguish. Janani notices and asks Ram why he is acting weird. Later, at a club, Ram punches a drunk rowdy trying to misbehave with Janani, and later he and Senthil are beat up by his gang, but when the rowdy tries to kill him Ram beats up the gang. Ram spends time in the hospital as his condition worsens, but Janani becomes frustrated with Ram not telling her where he went. Ram, in a manic state, tries to kill Janani but is stopped by Senthil.\n\nRam gets his company shares to be transferred to Janani, and wants Senthil to leave him to see her. Senthil refuses, and Ram suddenly bashes his head against a steering wheel, rendering him unconscious. Ram tearfully says goodbye to Senthil and leaves the car. In the present, Senthil and Janani are both crying profusely. As he goes to Janani's bedroom and watches her sleep, he suddenly hallucinates seeing a young girl saying \"Either kill her or you die.\" Terrified, he immediately gets away from her bed. He goes to his office and writes a suicide note while the hallucinations continue. Ram picks up a knife and slits his throat, saying his final words, \"I love you, Janani\". The film ends with Janani wailing in grief as she learns her husband's fate.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dhanush]] as Ram\n* [[Shruti Haasan]] as Janani, Ram's wife\n* [[Prabhu (actor)|Prabhu]] as Ram's father, a businessman\n* [[Sivakarthikeyan]] as Kumaran, Ram's friend since school days\n* [[Bhanupriya]] as Ram's mother\n* [[Sunder Ramu]] as Senthil, Ram's work friend, the only one who knew of his condition \n* [[Jeeva Ravi|Ravi]] as Janani's father\n* [[Rohini (actress)|Rohini]] as Janani's mother\n* [[Gabriella Charlton]] as Sumi, Janani's mute sister\n* [[Badava Gopi]] as Teacher\n* Anuradha Krishnamurthy as Senthil's mother\n* Sunitha Gogoi as Janani's friend\n\n==Production==\nAishwarya stated that the script was written with [[Shruti Haasan]] in mind, but the actress was initially unavailable to do the film.

The cinematography was handled by [[Velraj]].\n\nThe film released worldwide on 30 March 2012, to positive reviews. The soundtrack album composed by Anirudh Ravichander, and the song \"Why This Kolaveri Di\" became one of the \"Recently Most Popular (Gold) Videos\".\n\n==Plot==\nAt Ram\u2019s funeral, his wife Janani hallucinates about him running away, and the film flashes back to when Ram and Janani were 12th-grade students, when Ram helps Janani fix her bicycle and tells his friends Kumaran and Senthil that he has a crush on her. When Ram visits Janani, she reciprocates his love. Janani's sister Sumi makes sure that her parents are not aware of their secret relationship.\n\nBack in the present, Janani has a teary conversation with her mother about Ram. Asleep, she experiences another flashback about when her family had a visa to go to the US, but she burned her passport in order to stay with Ram and marry him. They later were given a house by Ram's dad.\n\nAfter Janani is awoken by her maid, she finds a suicide letter from Ram in his coat. She visits Senthil and asks him to reveal what they were hiding from her. A distraught Senthil tells her that when she was leaving for the US, Kumaran got a job in Singapore at the same time. Upon finding out that two of the people closest to him were leaving, Ram becomes more unstable. On a day when Ram took a 3.2 crore loss, he kicks and kills Tom, their dog. This leads Senthil to consult a doctor, who tells him that Ram's actions are symptomatic of bipolar disorder, and if not treated, could lead to suicide. When Senthil tries to warn him, Ram attacks Senthil with a bottle and chair, and later falls unconscious on the road.\n\nThe doctor confirms Ram has severe bipolar disorder, but Ram refuses Senthil's pleas to get admitted because of his love for Janani. To save himself, Ram then goes on a pilgrimage, causing further anguish. Janani notices and asks Ram why he is acting weird. Later, at a club, Ram punches a drunk rowdy trying to misbehave with Janani, and later he and Senthil are beat up by his gang, but when the rowdy tries to kill him Ram beats up the gang. Ram spends time in the hospital as his condition worsens, but Janani becomes frustrated with Ram not telling her where he went. Ram, in a manic state, tries to kill Janani but is stopped by Senthil.\n\nRam gets his company shares to be transferred to Janani, and wants Senthil to leave him to see her. Senthil refuses, and Ram suddenly bashes his head against a steering wheel, rendering him unconscious. Ram tearfully says goodbye to Senthil and leaves the car. In the present, Senthil and Janani are both crying profusely. As he goes to Janani's bedroom and watches her sleep, he suddenly hallucinates seeing a young girl saying \"Either kill her or you die.\" Terrified, he immediately gets away from her bed. He goes to his office and writes a suicide note while the hallucinations continue. Ram picks up a knife and slits his throat, saying his final words, \"I love you, Janani\". The film ends with Janani wailing in grief as she learns her husband's fate.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dhanush]] as Ram\n* [[Shruti Haasan]] as Janani, Ram's wife\n* [[Prabhu (actor)|Prabhu]] as Ram's father, a businessman\n* [[Sivakarthikeyan]] as Kumaran, Ram's friend since school days\n* [[Bhanupriya]] as Ram's mother\n* [[Sunder Ramu]] as Senthil, Ram's work friend, the only one who knew of his condition \n* [[Jeeva Ravi|Ravi]] as Janani's father\n* [[Rohini (actress)|Rohini]] as Janani's mother\n* [[Gabriella Charlton]] as Sumi, Janani's mute sister\n* [[Badava Gopi]] as Teacher\n* Anuradha Krishnamurthy as Senthil's mother\n* Sunitha Gogoi as Janani's friend\n\n==Production==\nAishwarya stated that the script was written with [[Shruti Haasan]] in mind, but the actress was initially unavailable to do the film.

This track has since topped the chart in Finland and Norway. The song, which features vocals from Vassy, features her with an [[Auto-Tune]]d voice; reviews were critical of the effects applied to the vocals.\n\n==Music video==\nThe video which is a lyrics video is on both David Guetta's YouTube and [[VEVO]] account. It is a total of 2 minutes and 50 seconds long. It was released on April 10, 2014.\n\nIt starts out with a girl fighting zombies while the zombies dance as a reference to [[Thriller (song)|Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\"]]. Suddenly, she falls in love with one of the zombies who goes up to her, and the two run away from the military, who are chasing them.\n\n==Critical reception==\nMike Wass of [[Idolator (website)|Idolator]] wrote: \"The grittier electro-house sound of 'Bad' is perhaps an indication that the hitmaker is moving away from the commercial dance sound of his last LP.
