fourth studio album by Canadian singer [[The Weeknd]]. The album was released by [[XO (record label)|XO]] and [[Republic Records]] on March 20, 2020. It is The Weeknd's first studio album since 2016's ''[[Starboy (album)|Starboy]]'', following the release of the 2018 [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[My Dear Melancholy]]''. The album is dedicated to a fan, who passed away shortly before the album's release. The standard edition has no featured artists, and the deluxe edition features remixed tracks, with [[guest appearance]]s from [[Chromatics (band)|Chromatics]] and [[Lil Uzi Vert]], along with additional production from [[The Blaze (band)|The Blaze]], [[Johnny Jewel]], and [[Oneohtrix Point Never|OPN]]. ''After Hours''{{'}} deluxe edition was later updated to include three new bonus tracks.\n\nThe artwork and aesthetic for the album's promotional material has been described as psychedelic and being inspired by various films, such as: ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'', ''[[Joker (2019 film)|Joker]]'', ''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]'', and ''[[Uncut Gems]]'', with the last film having a cameo appearance by The Weeknd himself. The project has been supported by three singles: \"[[Heartless (The Weeknd song)|Heartless]]\", \"[[Blinding Lights]]\", and \"[[In Your Eyes (The Weeknd song)|In Your Eyes]]\". One promotional single has been released as well, the album's [[After Hours (The Weeknd song)|title track]]. \n\nOn March 19, 2020, a record 1.02 million users pre-added ''After Hours'' to their [[Apple Music]] library. The album debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], with 444,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s, 275,000 of which were in pure sales. It is the Weeknd's fourth number-one album, and marks the biggest first week sales of 2020 for an album. The album received widespread acclaim, with some critics praising the album as The Weeknd's best.\n\n==Background and release==\nThe Weeknd first teased that he was working on a new album in November 2018, via a performance in which he told the crowd that \"''Chapter VI'' was coming soon.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-weeknd-teases-chapter-vi-album-shares-new-artwork-2413493|title=The Weeknd teases 'Chapter VI' album, shares new artwork|website=NME|last=Krol|first=Charlotte|date=November 27, 2018|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref> On January 12, 2019, Tesfaye then proceeded to further tease the project and its sound by tweeting \"no more daytime music\" to fans, making media outlets believe that he was set to continue the darker music found in ''[[My Dear Melancholy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/the-weekend-says-new-album-will-be-less-pop-friendly-no-more-daytime-music-news.69193.html|title=The Weeknd Says New Album Will Be Less Pop-Friendly: \"No More Daytime Music\"|website=HotNewHipHop|last=Ch|first=Devin|date=January 13, 2019|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref> Following a trio of collaborative singles throughout 2019, on August 6, he further reassured fans that he was working on his fourth studio album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-weekend-teases-new-album-chapter-6-2536077|title=Is The Weeknd's new album finally on its way?|website=NME|last=Skinner|first=Tom|date=August 7, 2019|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref> Then after a five-month period of silence,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/the-weeknd-returns-to-instagram-and-fans-are-convinced-chapter-vi-is-coming-news.96171.html|title=The Weeknd Returns To Instagram & Fans Are Convinced \"Chapter VI\" Is Coming|website=HotNewHipHop|last=A.|first=Aron|date=November 20, 2019|accessdate=February 14, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1095452/the-weeknd-returns-to-instagram-with-a-loading-message|title=The Weeknd Returns to Instagram With a \"Loading\" Message|publisher=[[E!
