It is to be distinguished from [[prevenient grace]], particularly associated with [[Arminianism]], which teaches that the offer of salvation through grace does not act irresistibly in a purely cause-effect, deterministic method, but rather in an influence-and-response fashion that can be both freely accepted and freely denied.<ref>{{cite book |language=en |last1=Forlines|first1=Leroy F. |last2=Pinson |first2=Matthew J. |last3=Ashby |first3=Stephen M. |title=The Quest for Truth: Answering Life's Inescapable Questions |place=Nashville |publisher=Randall House Publications |date=2001 |pages=313\u2013321}}</ref>\n\n==The doctrine==\nFourth-century [[Church Father]] [[Augustine of Hippo]] taught that God grants those whom he chooses for salvation the gift of persevering grace, and that they could not conceivably fall away.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} This doctrine gave rise to the doctrine of irresistible grace (''gratia irresistibilis''), though the term was not used during Augustine's lifetime.<ref>{{cite book|last=H\u00e4gglund|first=Bengt|title=Teologins historia|language=German|trans-title=History of Theology|others=Translated by Gene J.

That is, men yield to grace, not finally because their [[conscience]]s were more tender or their faith more tenacious than that of other men. Rather, the willingness and ability to do God's will are evidence of God's own faithfulness to save men from the power and the penalty of [[sin]], and since man is dead in sin and a slave to it he can not decide or be wooed to follow after God, God must powerfully intervene by giving him life and drawing the sinner to himself. In short, Calvinism argues that [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] must precede faith. In contrast, Arminianism argues that God\u2019s [[prevenient grace|grace]] through Jesus Christ stirs up a willingness to know God and respond to the gospel before regeneration;<ref>{{cite web |title=Our Wesleyan Heritage |url=http://www.umc.org/what-we-believe/our-wesleyan-heritage |website=United Methodist Church |accessdate=25 September 2018}}</ref> it is how God intervenes that separates Calvinism from Arminianism.\n\n[[John Calvin|Calvin]] says of this intervention that \"it is not violent, so as to compel men by external force; but still it is a powerful impulse of the Holy Spirit, which makes men willing who formerly were unwilling and reluctant,\".<ref>{{cite book |author=John Calvin |chapterurl=http://ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom34.xii.vii.html |chapter=John 6:41-45 |title=Commentary on John |volume=1 |author-link=John Calvin }}</ref> Despite the denial within Calvin and within the Calvinist confessions<ref>[http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_X.html Westminster Confession of Faith, X].1</ref><ref>[http://www.crcna.org/welcome/beliefs/confessions/canons-dort#3551 Canons of Dort, Third and Fourth Main Points of Doctrine], Article 16</ref> of violence or coercion being done to the will, [[Puritan]] scholar [[Perry Miller]] characterized Calvin's view of regeneration as being \"a forcible seizure, a holy rape of the surprised will.\"<ref>{{citation |last=Miller |first=Perry |author-link=Perry Miller |title=\"Preparation for Salvation\" in Seventeenth-Century New England |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=261 |date=June 1943 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |jstor=2707254}}</ref> [[John Gill (theologian)|John Gill]] says that \"this act of drawing is an act of power, yet not of force; God in drawing of unwilling, makes willing in the day of His power: He enlightens the understanding, bends the will, gives an heart of flesh, sweetly allures by the power of His grace, and engages the soul to come to Christ, and give up itself to Him; he draws with the bands of love.

They believe that as Adam and Eve were free to choose between right and wrong, humanity is able, as a result of the [[prevenient grace|prevenient or preceding grace]] of God through Jesus Christ, to choose to turn from sin to righteousness and believe on Jesus Christ who draws all of humanity to Himself. ''And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.'' <sup>{{bibleref|John|12:32|9}}</sup>. In this view, (1) after God's universal dispensation of grace to mankind, the will of man, which was formerly adverse to God and unable to obey, can now choose to obey through the work of Christ; and (2) although God's grace is a strong initial catalyst to effect salvation, it is not ''irresistible'' but may be ultimately resisted and rejected by a human being.\n\nBoth Calvinism and Arminianism agree that the question of the resistibility of grace is inexorably bound up with the theological system's view of the [[Sovereignty of God in Christianity|sovereignty]] of God. The fundamental question is whether God can allow individuals to accept or reject His grace and yet remain sovereign. If so, then grace can be resistible.  If not, then grace must be irresistible. This different understanding of sovereignty is often attributed to an improper understanding of [[total depravity]]. However, both Calvin and Arminius taught [[total depravity]]. Total depravity is expressly affirmed in Article III of the [[Five articles of Remonstrance]]. Nevertheless, Calvinist [[Charles Hodge]] says, \"The ([[Arminian]]) and ([[Roman Catholic]]) doctrine is true, if the other parts of their doctrinal system are true; and it is false if that system be erroneous. If the (Calvinistic) doctrine concerning the natural state of man since the fall, and the sovereignty of God in election, be Scriptural, then it is certain that sufficient grace does not become efficacious from the cooperation of the human will.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Charles Hodge |chapterurl=http://ccel.org/ccel/hodge/theology2.iv.xiv.iii.html |chapter=Efficacious Grace |title=Systematic Theology |volume=2 |author-link=Charles Hodge }}</ref> Hodge's argument follows Calvinist teaching which denies that the work of Jesus Christ empowers humanity to respond to the gospel before regeneration.\n\nCalvinism's rejection of [[prevenient grace]] leaves humanity in a state of [[total depravity|Total Depravity]] which requires [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] of an individual before that individual is capable to believe or repent.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Calvin|first1=John|title=Institutes of Christian Religion|location=Book 3, Chapter 3, Section 1|page=509}}</ref> John the Baptist called all to his baptism for the remission of sins <sup>{{bibleref|Mark|1:4|9}}</sup> and multitudes responded without regeneration <sup>{{bibleref|Mark|1:5|9}}</sup>. The [[New Testament]] regularly calls individuals to '''repent and believe''' with no indication that they had been previously regenerated. The Apostle Peter called the Jews to repent and be converted <sup>{{bibleref|Acts|3:19|9}}</sup>. Jesus promised that the Holy Spirit would convict the world of sin <sup>{{bibleref|John|16:8|9}}</sup>. Calvinism's response is found in [[Limited Atonement]]. So as a result of the Calvinist understanding of God's [[Sovereignty of God in Christianity#Calvinist_View|sovereignty]], one must conclude that God's election does not depend upon any human response, necessitating a belief in (1) both [[total depravity|Total Depravity]] and [[Unconditional election|Unconditional Election]], (2) [[Irresistible Grace]] rather than [[Prevenient Grace]], and (3) [[Limited Atonement]]; if any of these beliefs are rejected, this logic fails.\n\n====Lutheran====\n[[File:Luther-Predigt-LC-WB.jpg|thumb|335px|\"The certain mark by which a Christian community can be recognized is the preaching of the gospel in its purity.\"\u2014[[Martin Luther|Luther]]<ref>Tappert, T.G., [https://books.google.com/books?id=cHvf_xp6V8IC&pg=RA3-PA325&lpg=RA3-PA325&dq=%22The+certain+mark+by+which+a+Christian+community+can+be+recognized+is+the+preaching+of+the+gospel+in+its+purity.%22&source=bl&ots=4jdynQwLJB&sig=n5MpkCtJlJVcN2GES416nCcdAQk&hl=en&ei=TIK0SfWdLuSOmQfXzcjwBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result Selected Writings of Martin Luther], Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2007, p.325</ref>]]\nLike Calvinists, [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] view the work of [[salvation]] as [[monergism|monergistic]] in which an unconverted or unrepentant person always resists and rejects God and his ways.<ref>[[Formula of Concord]]: [http://www.bookofconcord.org/fc-sd/freewill.html Solid Declaration, art. ii, par. 71]; [http://www.bookofconcord.org/fc-sd/freewill.html par. 18]</ref> Even during conversion, the [[Formula of Concord]] says, humans resist \"the Word and will of God, until God awakens him from the death of sin, enlightens and renews him.\"<ref>[http://www.bookofconcord.org/fc-sd/freewill.html Solid Declaration, art. ii, par. 59]</ref> Furthermore, they both see the preaching of the gospel as a [[means of grace]] by which God offers salvation.\n\nCalvinists distinguish between a resistible, outward call to salvation given to all who hear the [[free offer of the gospel]], and an efficacious, inward work by the Holy Spirit.

Of course, this confirmation depends upon the belief that when God elected certain individuals for salvation, He either did not know or did not consider who would respond and obey, though the Apostle Peter refers to the \"Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ\". <sup>{{bibleref|1 Peter|1:2|9}}</sup>\n\nCalvinists also rely upon several verses from the [[John 6|sixth chapter]] of the [[Gospel of John]], which contains a record of Jesus' teaching on humanity's abilities and God's activities in salvation, as the central [[proof text]] for the Calvinist doctrine:\n\n* John 6:37,39: \"All that the Father gives me will come to me.... And this is the will of Him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that He has given me, but raise it up on the last day.\"[ESV]\n* John 6:44\u201345: \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.... Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me.\"[ESV]\n* John 6:65: \"(N)o one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.\"[ESV]\n\nProponents of Arminianism argue that the word \"draw\" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|\u1f15\u03bb\u03ba\u03c9}}, ''helk\u00f4'')<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2333771&layout.reflookup=e%29lkusw&layout.reflang=greek |author=[[Henry George Liddell]], Robert Scott |title=helk\u00f4 |encyclopedia=[[A Greek-English Lexicon]] |accessdate=2009-03-26}}</ref> as used in John 6:44 does not require the sense of \"drag\", though Calvinists teach this is the word's usual meaning (as in [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+18:10,21:6,21:11;Acts+16:19,21:30;James+2:6 Jn. 18:10; 21:6; 21:11; Acts 16:19; 21:30; Jas. 2:6]). They point to John 12:32 as an example: \"And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.\" Many Arminians interpret this to mean that Jesus draws all people to Himself, but the draw only enables people to come to Him, since, if the call was truly irresistible, then all must come to Christ and be saved. They may also note that in the [[Septuagint]] version of Jeremiah 38:13, when Jeremiah is lifted out of the pit where he was left to die, this Greek verb is used for the action which his rescuers performed after he voluntarily secured the ropes under his armpits, and that this rescue was certainly performed in cooperation with Jeremiah's wishes and would have failed if he did not cooperate. Therefore, they may argue, even if the semantics of \"draw\" are understood in the usual sense, this should only be taken to indicate the source of the power, not the question of whether the person being drawn responds to the drawing, or to indicate that the drawing is done irrespective of their will.\n\nCalvinists argue that (1) the word \"draw\" should be understood according to its usual [[semantics]] in both John 6:44 and 12:32; (2) the word \"all\" (translated \"all people\" in v. 12:32) should be taken in the sense of \"all kinds of people\" rather than \"every individual\"; and thus (3) the former verse refers to an irresistible internal call to salvation and the latter to the opening of the [[Kingdom of God]] to the [[Gentile]]s, not a universal, resistible internal call. Of course, that argument requires acceptance of either the doctrine of [[Limited Atonement]] or [[universalism]], since John 12:32 clearly states that \"Jesus will draw '''all'''\". Some have asserted on this basis that the text of John 6:44 can [[Entailment|entail]] either [[universalism]] or Calvinism (inclusive of [[Limited Atonement]]), but not Arminianism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/elenctictheology/John-644.pdf |title=A Logical Analysis - John 6:44 |author=Brian Bosse |date=2005-10-11 |accessdate=2009-03-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202231421/http://www.geocities.com/elenctictheology/John-644.pdf|archivedate=2007-12-02}}</ref>\n\nArminian [[William Barclay (theologian)|William Barclay]] argues that \"man's resistance can defeat the pull of God\" mentioned in John 6:44, but [[Biblical exegesis|commentator]] [[Leon Morris]] contends that \"(n)ot one of (Barclay's) examples of the verb ('draw') shows the resistance as successful. Indeed we can go further. There is not one example in the New Testament of the use of this verb where the resistance is successful. Always the drawing power is triumphant, as here.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Leon Morris |title=The Gospel According to John |edition=revised |date=1995 |page=328, n. 116|author-link=Leon Morris }}</ref> Such arguments invite the criticism that Calvinists teach salvation by decree of God rather than justification by [[sola fide|faith alone]], that they \"so zealously sought to guard the free grace of God in salvation that they denied faith any involvement at all in the actual justification of sinners.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=McKelvey|first1=Robert J.|title=That Error and Pillar of Antinomianism': Eternal Justification|date=2011|publisher=G\u00f6ttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht|page=239\u201340}}</ref> But even if the drawing power is always triumphant, the ability to resist does not depend upon the meaning of the word \"draw\" in John 12:32, but on the question what the \"draw\" is intended to accomplish. Calvinism assumes that persons who Jesus \"draws\" will be regenerated. Arminianism states that all are drawn to Jesus to be given an enabling grace. \"Jesus does not define what 'His drawing' will accomplish in John 12, only that He will do it.\"<ref name=\"Being Drawn to God - Calvinism and Arminianism\">{{cite web|last1=Yuriy|first1=Stasyuk|url=http://yuriystasyuk.com/being-drawn-to-god-calvinism-and-arminianism-in-john-644-and-john-1232/|website=The Reluctant Skeptic|accessdate=29 May 2017}}</ref> Even if the semantics of \"draw\" are understood in the manner Calvinist's urge, this should only be taken to indicate the sufficiency of the power to draw (they were \"not able to draw\" as in John 21:6, or they were able to do so as in John 21:11), rather than to define what God does to those He draws. Arminians reject the Calvinist teaching that God draws for the purpose of forced [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] irrespective of their wishes. Rather Arminians believe God draws all persons to provide all with an ability or enabling to believe, as [[prevenient grace]] teaches.\n\n==History of the doctrine==\n{{Main article|History of Calvinist\u2013Arminian debate}}\n\nIn the Catholic Church, debates concerning the respective role of efficacious grace and [[free will]] led to the establishment of the [[Congregatio de Auxiliis]] at the end of the 16th century by the Pope [[Clement VIII]]. The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] insisted on the role of the efficacious grace, but the [[Jesuit]]s embraced [[Molinism]], which postulated greater liberty in the will.

That is, men yield to grace, not finally because their [[conscience]]s were more tender or their faith more tenacious than that of other men. Rather, the willingness and ability to do God's will are evidence of God's own faithfulness to save men from the power and the penalty of [[sin]], and since man is dead in sin and a slave to it he can not decide or be wooed to follow after God, God must powerfully intervene by giving him life and drawing the sinner to himself. In short, Calvinism argues that [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] must precede faith.

They believe that as Adam and Eve were free to choose between right and wrong, humanity is able, as a result of the [[prevenient grace|prevenient or preceding grace]] of God through Jesus Christ, to choose to turn from sin to righteousness and believe on Jesus Christ who draws all of humanity to Himself. ''And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.'' <sup>{{bibleref|John|12:32|9}}</sup>. In this view, (1) after God's universal dispensation of grace to mankind, the will of man, which was formerly adverse to God and unable to obey, can now choose to obey through the work of Christ; and (2) although God's grace is a strong initial catalyst to effect salvation, it is not ''irresistible'' but may be ultimately resisted and rejected by a human being.\n\nBoth Calvinism and Arminianism agree that the question of the resistibility of grace is inexorably bound up with the theological system's view of the [[Sovereignty of God in Christianity|sovereignty]] of God. The fundamental question is whether God can allow individuals to accept or reject His grace and yet remain sovereign. If so, then grace can be resistible.  If not, then grace must be irresistible. This different understanding of sovereignty is often attributed to an improper understanding of [[total depravity]]. However, both Calvin and Arminius taught [[total depravity]]. Total depravity is expressly affirmed in Article III of the [[Five articles of Remonstrance]]. Nevertheless, Calvinist [[Charles Hodge]] says, \"The ([[Arminian]]) and ([[Roman Catholic]]) doctrine is true, if the other parts of their doctrinal system are true; and it is false if that system be erroneous. If the (Calvinistic) doctrine concerning the natural state of man since the fall, and the sovereignty of God in election, be Scriptural, then it is certain that sufficient grace does not become efficacious from the cooperation of the human will.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Charles Hodge |chapterurl=http://ccel.org/ccel/hodge/theology2.iv.xiv.iii.html |chapter=Efficacious Grace |title=Systematic Theology |volume=2 |author-link=Charles Hodge }}</ref> Hodge's argument follows Calvinist teaching which denies that the work of Jesus Christ empowers humanity to respond to the gospel before regeneration.\n\nCalvinism's rejection of [[prevenient grace]] leaves humanity in a state of [[total depravity|Total Depravity]] which requires [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] of an individual before that individual is capable to believe or repent.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Calvin|first1=John|title=Institutes of Christian Religion|location=Book 3, Chapter 3, Section 1|page=509}}</ref> John the Baptist called all to his baptism for the remission of sins <sup>{{bibleref|Mark|1:4|9}}</sup> and multitudes responded without regeneration <sup>{{bibleref|Mark|1:5|9}}</sup>. The [[New Testament]] regularly calls individuals to '''repent and believe''' with no indication that they had been previously regenerated. The Apostle Peter called the Jews to repent and be converted <sup>{{bibleref|Acts|3:19|9}}</sup>. Jesus promised that the Holy Spirit would convict the world of sin <sup>{{bibleref|John|16:8|9}}</sup>. Calvinism's response is found in [[Limited Atonement]]. So as a result of the Calvinist understanding of God's [[Sovereignty of God in Christianity#Calvinist_View|sovereignty]], one must conclude that God's election does not depend upon any human response, necessitating a belief in (1) both [[total depravity|Total Depravity]] and [[Unconditional election|Unconditional Election]], (2) [[Irresistible Grace]] rather than [[Prevenient Grace]], and (3) [[Limited Atonement]]; if any of these beliefs are rejected, this logic fails.\n\n====Lutheran====\n[[File:Luther-Predigt-LC-WB.jpg|thumb|335px|\"The certain mark by which a Christian community can be recognized is the preaching of the gospel in its purity.\"\u2014[[Martin Luther|Luther]]<ref>Tappert, T.G., [https://books.google.com/books?id=cHvf_xp6V8IC&pg=RA3-PA325&lpg=RA3-PA325&dq=%22The+certain+mark+by+which+a+Christian+community+can+be+recognized+is+the+preaching+of+the+gospel+in+its+purity.%22&source=bl&ots=4jdynQwLJB&sig=n5MpkCtJlJVcN2GES416nCcdAQk&hl=en&ei=TIK0SfWdLuSOmQfXzcjwBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result Selected Writings of Martin Luther], Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2007, p.325</ref>]]\nLike Calvinists, [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] view the work of [[salvation]] as [[monergism|monergistic]] in which an unconverted or unrepentant person always resists and rejects God and his ways.<ref>[[Formula of Concord]]: [http://www.bookofconcord.org/fc-sd/freewill.html Solid Declaration, art. ii, par. 71]; [http://www.bookofconcord.org/fc-sd/freewill.html par. 18]</ref> Even during conversion, the [[Formula of Concord]] says, humans resist \"the Word and will of God, until God awakens him from the death of sin, enlightens and renews him.\"<ref>[http://www.bookofconcord.org/fc-sd/freewill.html Solid Declaration, art. ii, par. 59]</ref> Furthermore, they both see the preaching of the gospel as a [[means of grace]] by which God offers salvation.\n\nCalvinists distinguish between a resistible, outward call to salvation given to all who hear the [[free offer of the gospel]], and an efficacious, inward work by the Holy Spirit.

Of course, this confirmation depends upon the belief that when God elected certain individuals for salvation, He either did not know or did not consider who would respond and obey, though the Apostle Peter refers to the \"Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ\". <sup>{{bibleref|1 Peter|1:2|9}}</sup>\n\nCalvinists also rely upon several verses from the [[John 6|sixth chapter]] of the [[Gospel of John]], which contains a record of Jesus' teaching on humanity's abilities and God's activities in salvation, as the central [[proof text]] for the Calvinist doctrine:\n\n* John 6:37,39: \"All that the Father gives me will come to me.... And this is the will of Him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that He has given me, but raise it up on the last day.\"[ESV]\n* John 6:44\u201345: \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him....

They point to John 12:32 as an example: \"And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.\" Many Arminians interpret this to mean that Jesus draws all people to Himself, but the draw only enables people to come to Him, since, if the call was truly irresistible, then all must come to Christ and be saved. They may also note that in the [[Septuagint]] version of Jeremiah 38:13, when Jeremiah is lifted out of the pit where he was left to die, this Greek verb is used for the action which his rescuers performed after he voluntarily secured the ropes under his armpits, and that this rescue was certainly performed in cooperation with Jeremiah's wishes and would have failed if he did not cooperate. Therefore, they may argue, even if the semantics of \"draw\" are understood in the usual sense, this should only be taken to indicate the source of the power, not the question of whether the person being drawn responds to the drawing, or to indicate that the drawing is done irrespective of their will.\n\nCalvinists argue that (1) the word \"draw\" should be understood according to its usual [[semantics]] in both John 6:44 and 12:32; (2) the word \"all\" (translated \"all people\" in v. 12:32) should be taken in the sense of \"all kinds of people\" rather than \"every individual\"; and thus (3) the former verse refers to an irresistible internal call to salvation and the latter to the opening of the [[Kingdom of God]] to the [[Gentile]]s, not a universal, resistible internal call. Of course, that argument requires acceptance of either the doctrine of [[Limited Atonement]] or [[universalism]], since John 12:32 clearly states that \"Jesus will draw '''all'''\". Some have asserted on this basis that the text of John 6:44 can [[Entailment|entail]] either [[universalism]] or Calvinism (inclusive of [[Limited Atonement]]), but not Arminianism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/elenctictheology/John-644.pdf |title=A Logical Analysis - John 6:44 |author=Brian Bosse |date=2005-10-11 |accessdate=2009-03-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202231421/http://www.geocities.com/elenctictheology/John-644.pdf|archivedate=2007-12-02}}</ref>\n\nArminian [[William Barclay (theologian)|William Barclay]] argues that \"man's resistance can defeat the pull of God\" mentioned in John 6:44, but [[Biblical exegesis|commentator]] [[Leon Morris]] contends that \"(n)ot one of (Barclay's) examples of the verb ('draw') shows the resistance as successful.

Arminians reject the Calvinist teaching that God draws for the purpose of forced [[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]] irrespective of their wishes.
