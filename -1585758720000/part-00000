It was the first ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' game to be released on a [[Nintendo]] platform and was produced in commemoration of the series' tenth anniversary. The story follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Tails (character)|Tails]], [[Knuckles the Echidna|Knuckles]], and [[Amy Rose|Amy]] as they journey to stop [[Doctor Eggman]] from taking over the world. Controlling a character, players are tasked with completing each [[Level (video gaming)|level]], defeating Eggman and his [[robot]] army, and collecting the seven [[Chaos Emeralds]].\n\nDevelopment began after [[Sega]] shifted its focus to third-party software development, due to the poor performance of the [[Dreamcast]] console. Sega recruited [[Dimps]] to lead development, making the game the first in the franchise developed by the studio. While ''Sonic Advance'' follows a similar style of gameplay to the [[Sega Genesis]] ''Sonic'' games, certain concepts and designs were reused from newer titles such as ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' (1998). The game has been [[Porting|ported]] to [[Nokia]]'s [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, and is available on the [[Wii U]] via the [[Virtual Console]] in Japan.\n\n''Sonic Advance'' received positive reviews for its graphics, character animations, and its similarities to the original Genesis games, but was criticized for its short length and special stages. It was a major commercial success, selling 1.21 million copies in the United States and is among the [[List of best-selling Game Boy Advance video games|GBA's bestselling titles]]. Dimps has since created many entries in the series, including two sequels to the game, ''[[Sonic Advance 2]]'' (2002) and ''[[Sonic Advance 3]]'' (2004).\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:SonicAdvanceLoop.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Screenshot showing Sonic running around a loop in Angel Island zone, the game's fifth level. The HUD on the upper left-hand corner shows the timer, score, and amount of rings the player has.|Gameplay screenshot showing [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] in one of the game's levels]]\n''Sonic Advance'' is a [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platformer]] [[action game]] reminiscent of the original ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' games released for the [[Sega Genesis]].<ref name=\"gsrev\" /> Players journey through an island to defeat [[Doctor Eggman]], who is attempting to capture its animal population to turn them into evil [[robot]]s. Players select one of four characters, each with their own unique set of moves. [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] is fastest and can perform an \"insta-shield\" that protects him for a moment; [[Tails (character)|Tails]] can fly or swim for a short time; [[Knuckles the Echidna]] can glide through the air, swim above water for a few seconds and climb walls; and [[Amy Rose]] can destroy enemies using a hammer.<ref name=\"ignrev\" /> Except for Amy, each character can defeat enemy robots by jumping and curling into a ball, or by performing a spin dash on the ground to gain speed. By entering a [[cheat code]], players can control Sonic while Tails runs alongside him, similar to ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'' (1992).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Sonic Advance + Sonic Adventure 2 Battle Official Perfect Guide|last=|first=|publisher=Versus Books|year=2002|isbn=9780970646866|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe game takes place over six [[level (video gaming)|level]]s called zones. Each zone is split into two acts, where the player must guide their selected character past enemies and obstacles such as spikes and bottomless pits to reach the end in under ten minutes. Scattered around acts are springboards, boost pads, and golden [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]], which serve as a form of [[Health (gaming)|health]]; players survive hits as long as they have at least one ring, but their rings will scatter and disappear after a short period.<ref name=\"gsrev\" /> Players collect canisters that contain [[power-up]]s such as speed shoes, elemental shields, and [[invincibility]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The first act ends when players pass a signpost, and the second culminates in a [[boss fight]] with Eggman; after hitting him eight times, Eggman will flee and drop a capsule of captured animals. Each character starts the game with a number of lives, which are lost when they are hit with no rings in their possession, crushed, drown, or fall in a bottomless pit. If all lives are lost, they will receive a [[game over]].<ref name=\"gsrev\" />\n\nSpecial springs can be found near the top of certain acts.<ref name=\"ignrev\" /> By jumping on them, the player can reach a special stage, where they are sent down a tube to collect rings. If they collect enough rings, the player receives a [[Chaos Emerald]].<ref name=\"gsrev\" /> Collecting all seven Emeralds unlocks an extra boss fight. The game also features a [[minigame]], Tiny Chao Garden, where players can raise [[Chao (Sonic)|Chao]].<ref name=\"nwrreview\" /> Players can transfer their Chao between the Tiny Chao Garden and the Chao Garden from the [[GameCube]] versions of ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' and ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]''.<ref name=\"ignrev\" /> The game also features a competitive [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode, where up to four owners of the game can race to the end of a level or search for Chao.<ref name=\"nwrreview\" />\n\n==Development and release==\n[[File:Nintendo-Game-Boy-Advance-Purple-FL.jpg|thumb|right|alt=An indigo-colored Game Boy Advance (GBA), the handheld device Sonic Advance was developed for.|''Sonic Advance'' was developed for [[Nintendo]]'s [[Game Boy Advance]] handheld console]]\nIn January 2001, [[Sega]], facing financial troubles with the underperformance of its [[Dreamcast]] console, shifted from first to third-party software publishing,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-announces-drastic-restructuring/1100-2680518/|title=Sega announces drastic restructuring|last1=Ahmed|first1=Shahed|date=January 31, 2001|website=GameSpot|publisher=CBS Interactive|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704153502/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-announces-drastic-restructuring/1100-2680518/|archive-date=July 4, 2017|url-status=live|accessdate=November 2, 2017|df=}}</ref> with [[Sony Computer Entertainment]]'s [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Nintendo]]'s [[Game Boy Advance]] (GBA) being primary focuses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/01/24/sega-confirms-ps2-and-game-boy-advance-negotiations|title=Sega Confirms PS2 and Game Boy Advance Negotiations|author1=IGN Staff|first=January 23, 2001|date=|website=IGN|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323144955/http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/01/24/sega-confirms-ps2-and-game-boy-advance-negotiations|archive-date=March 23, 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=November 2, 2017|df=}}</ref> A team of developers was formed to begin development on ''Sonic the Hedgehog Advance'' (later renamed ''Sonic Advance''), a ''Sonic'' title for the GBA that would commemorate the series' 10th anniversary.<ref name=\"says\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/5068/sega-says|title=Sega Says...|last1=Cole|first1=Michael|date=January 31, 2001|website=Nintendo World Report|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816040211/http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/5068/sega-says|archive-date=August 16, 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=November 2, 2017|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/5572/sonic-team-shows-its-goods|title=Sonic Team shows its goods!|last1=Cole|first1=Michael|date=February 8, 2001|website=Nintendo World Report|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816035052/http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/5572/sonic-team-shows-its-goods|archive-date=August 16, 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=November 2, 2017|df=}}</ref> [[Dimps]], a studio formed by several former [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]] developers and funded by Sega, Sony, and [[Bandai]], developed the game with assistance from [[Sonic Team]].<ref name=\"igndimps\"/> Sonic Team conceived the game, but was understaffed on employees familiar with the GBA hardware and so recruited Dimps.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Harris |first1=Craig |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/05/14/e3-2004-yuji-naka-talks-sonic |title=E3 2004: Yuji Naka Talks Sonic |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=November 2, 2018 |date=May 13, 2004}}</ref> Several Dimps members worked on the critically acclaimed ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog Pocket Adventure]]'' (1999) for the Neo Geo Pocket Color.<ref name=\"igndimps\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/04/18/gba-sonic-developed-by-dimps|title=GBA Sonic Developed By Dimps|last1=Harris|first1=Craig|date=April 18, 2001|website=IGN|publisher=Ziff Davis|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818082311/http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/04/18/gba-sonic-developed-by-dimps|archive-date=August 18, 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=November 2, 2017|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe developers decided to return to a gameplay style similar to the original Genesis ''Sonic'' games, which Naka felt was refreshing.

It was the first ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' game to be released on a [[Nintendo]] platform and was produced in commemoration of the series' tenth anniversary. The story follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], [[Tails (character)|Tails]], [[Knuckles the Echidna|Knuckles]], and [[Amy Rose|Amy]] as they journey to stop [[Doctor Eggman]] from taking over the world. Controlling a character, players are tasked with completing each [[Level (video gaming)|level]], defeating Eggman and his [[robot]] army, and collecting the seven [[Chaos Emeralds]].\n\nDevelopment began after [[Sega]] shifted its focus to third-party software development, due to the poor performance of the [[Dreamcast]] console. Sega recruited [[Dimps]] to lead development, making the game the first in the franchise developed by the studio. While ''Sonic Advance'' follows a similar style of gameplay to the [[Sega Genesis]] ''Sonic'' games, certain concepts and designs were reused from newer titles such as ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' (1998). The game has been [[Porting|ported]] to [[Nokia]]'s [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, and is available on the [[Wii U]] via the [[Virtual Console]] in Japan.\n\n''Sonic Advance'' received positive reviews for its graphics, character animations, and its similarities to the original Genesis games, but was criticized for its short length and special stages. It was a major commercial success, selling 1.21 million copies in the United States and is among the [[List of best-selling Game Boy Advance video games|GBA's bestselling titles]]. Dimps has since created many entries in the series, including two sequels to the game, ''[[Sonic Advance 2]]'' (2002) and ''[[Sonic Advance 3]]'' (2004).\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:SonicAdvanceLoop.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Screenshot showing Sonic running around a loop in Angel Island zone, the game's fifth level. The HUD on the upper left-hand corner shows the timer, score, and amount of rings the player has.|Gameplay screenshot showing [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] in one of the game's levels]]\n''Sonic Advance'' is a [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platformer]] [[action game]] reminiscent of the original ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' games released for the [[Sega Genesis]].<ref name=\"gsrev\" /> Players journey through an island to defeat [[Doctor Eggman]], who is attempting to capture its animal population to turn them into evil [[robot]]s. Players select one of four characters, each with their own unique set of moves. [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] is fastest and can perform an \"insta-shield\" that protects him for a moment; [[Tails (character)|Tails]] can fly or swim for a short time; [[Knuckles the Echidna]] can glide through the air, swim above water for a few seconds and climb walls; and [[Amy Rose]] can destroy enemies using a hammer.<ref name=\"ignrev\" /> Except for Amy, each character can defeat enemy robots by jumping and curling into a ball, or by performing a spin dash on the ground to gain speed. By entering a [[cheat code]], players can control Sonic while Tails runs alongside him, similar to ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'' (1992).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Sonic Advance + Sonic Adventure 2 Battle Official Perfect Guide|last=|first=|publisher=Versus Books|year=2002|isbn=9780970646866|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe game takes place over six [[level (video gaming)|level]]s called zones. Each zone is split into two acts, where the player must guide their selected character past enemies and obstacles such as spikes and bottomless pits to reach the end in under ten minutes. Scattered around acts are springboards, boost pads, and golden [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]], which serve as a form of [[Health (gaming)|health]]; players survive hits as long as they have at least one ring, but their rings will scatter and disappear after a short period.<ref name=\"gsrev\" /> Players collect canisters that contain [[power-up]]s such as speed shoes, elemental shields, and [[invincibility]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The first act ends when players pass a signpost, and the second culminates in a [[boss fight]] with Eggman; after hitting him eight times, Eggman will flee and drop a capsule of captured animals. Each character starts the game with a number of lives, which are lost when they are hit with no rings in their possession, crushed, drown, or fall in a bottomless pit.

Bryant served on the auxiliary crew, which traveled north from [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's, Newfoundland]], to bring the main party home, which they successfully accomplished.{{sfn|Bryant|1895|p=9}} His account of the trip was published in 1895.{{sfn|Bryant|1895}}\n\nBryant continued to explore the far north in 1897, when he organized and led and expedition to the area around [[Mount Saint Elias]] on the [[Alaska]]-[[Yukon Territory|Yukon]] border.{{sfn|Oberholtzer|1912|p=82}} Two years later, he helped to finance [[George W. Melville]]'s study of oceanic currents in the polar regions.{{sfn|Williams|1933|p=249}} Bryant ventured south in 1904, visiting [[Popocat\u00e9petl]], a Mexican volcano, but returned to the north in 1907, when he crossed the [[Malaspina Glacier]], but was unsuccessful in summiting Mount Saint Elias.{{sfn|Williams|1933|p=249}} His mountaineering later took him to other peaks across the globe, including [[Mount Nantai]] in Japan, [[Pidurutalagala]] in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), and [[Mauna Loa]] in Hawaii.{{sfn|Williams|1933|p=249}} He returned to Labrador in 1912 to explore the area around the [[Saint-Augustin River]].{{sfn|Bryant|1913|pp=1\u20132}} The following year, he was elected president of the [[Association of American Geographers]].{{sfn|Williams|1933|p=247}}\n\n==Death==\nBryant died in his home on December 7, 1932, after a brief illness.{{sfn|New York Times 1932}} He was buried in [[The Woodlands (Philadelphia)|Woodlands Cemetery]] in Philadelphia.

Frederick Rothermel]], who was later district attorney of Philadelphia.{{sfn|New York Times 1929}}\n\n==Exploration==\n\n===Grand Falls===\n[[File:Grand Falls Labrador.jpg|thumb|Bryant explored Grand Falls, Labrador (now [[Churchill Falls]]) in 1891.]]\nIn 1891, Bryant became a member of the [[Geographical Society of Philadelphia]].{{sfn|Williams|1933|p=249}} That same year, he organized an expedition to Grand Falls in Labrador, then a part of the [[Newfoundland Colony]] (now known as [[Churchill Falls]] in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], Canada.){{sfn|Williams|1933|p=247}} Although fur-trader [[John McLean (trader)|John McLean]] had been the first westerner to see the Falls in 1841, none were known to have returned since then.{{sfn|Marsh|2006}} The local [[Innu]] people had a taboo against visiting it.{{sfn|Marsh|2006}} Bryant had been fascinated with the Grand Falls for several years: \"There was something in the idea of this distant cataract\u2014thundering on for ages in that far-off land\u2014which appealed forcibly to one's imagination\".{{sfn|Bryant|1892|p=9}} Travelling up the [[Churchill River (Atlantic)|Grand River]] (now the Churchill River), Bryant's group encountered [[First Nations]] tribes that had very little contact with white society.{{sfn|Bryant|1892|pp=14\u201317}} After an arduous journey, they reached the Falls on September 2, 1891.{{sfn|Bryant|1892|p=30}} To that point, most knowledge of the Falls consisted of vague accounts by natives and McLean's journey of decades earlier; Bryant's detailed account of his trek was published in ''[[The Century Magazine]]'' in 1892, and attracted widespread attention.{{sfn|Oberholtzer|1912|p=81}} The Geographical Society of Philadelphia reprinted it in a book later that year.{{sfn|Bryant|1892}}\n\n===Mountaineering===\nAs Bryant was exploring the Grand Falls, another explorer, [[Robert Peary]], was [[Peary expedition to Greenland of 1891\u201392|travelling in Greenland]]. After Peary and his crew had not returned as expected, the [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University|Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences]] organized a relief expedition led by [[Angelo Heilprin]], with Bryant as second-in-command.{{sfn|Oberholtzer|1912|p=81}} In 1894, Peary led a second attempt to explore the northern reaches of Greenland. Bryant served on the auxiliary crew, which traveled north from [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's, Newfoundland]], to bring the main party home, which they successfully accomplished.{{sfn|Bryant|1895|p=9}} His account of the trip was published in 1895.{{sfn|Bryant|1895}}\n\nBryant continued to explore the far north in 1897, when he organized and led and expedition to the area around [[Mount Saint Elias]] on the [[Alaska]]-[[Yukon Territory|Yukon]] border.{{sfn|Oberholtzer|1912|p=82}} Two years later, he helped to finance [[George W. Melville]]'s study of oceanic currents in the polar regions.{{sfn|Williams|1933|p=249}} Bryant ventured south in 1904, visiting [[Popocat\u00e9petl]], a Mexican volcano, but returned to the north in 1907, when he crossed the [[Malaspina Glacier]], but was unsuccessful in summiting Mount Saint Elias.{{sfn|Williams|1933|p=249}} His mountaineering later took him to other peaks across the globe, including [[Mount Nantai]] in Japan, [[Pidurutalagala]] in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), and [[Mauna Loa]] in Hawaii.{{sfn|Williams|1933|p=249}} He returned to Labrador in 1912 to explore the area around the [[Saint-Augustin River]].{{sfn|Bryant|1913|pp=1\u20132}} The following year, he was elected president of the [[Association of American Geographers]].{{sfn|Williams|1933|p=247}}\n\n==Death==\nBryant died in his home on December 7, 1932, after a brief illness.{{sfn|New York Times 1932}} He was buried in [[The Woodlands (Philadelphia)|Woodlands Cemetery]] in Philadelphia.
