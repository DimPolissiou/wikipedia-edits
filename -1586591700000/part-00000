It is a variable that summarizes positive [[correlation]]s among different cognitive tasks, reflecting the fact that an individual's performance on one type of cognitive task tends to be comparable to that person's performance on other kinds of cognitive tasks. The ''g'' factor typically accounts for 40 to 50 percent of the between-individual performance differences on a given [[cognitive test]], and composite scores (\"IQ scores\") based on many tests are frequently regarded as estimates of individuals' standing on the ''g'' factor.<ref name=\"kamphaus2005\">Kamphaus et al. 2005</ref> The terms ''IQ, general intelligence, general cognitive ability, general mental ability'', and simply ''intelligence'' are often used interchangeably to refer to this common core shared by cognitive tests.<ref name=\"deary2010\">Deary et al. 2010</ref> The ''g'' factor targets a particular measure of  ''general intelligence''.\n\nFor broader coverage of IQ metrics, see [[Intelligence quotient]].\n\nThe existence of the ''g'' factor was originally proposed by the English psychologist [[Charles Spearman]] in the early years of the 20th century. He observed that children's performance ratings, across seemingly unrelated school subjects, were positively [[correlated]], and reasoned that these correlations reflected the influence of an underlying general mental ability that entered into performance on all kinds of mental tests. Spearman suggested that all mental performance could be conceptualized in terms of a single general ability factor, which he labeled ''g'', and many narrow task-specific ability factors. Soon after Spearman proposed the existence of ''g'', it was challenged by [[Godfrey Thomson]], who presented evidence that such intercorrelations among test results could arise even if no ''g''-factor existed.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=THOMSON |first=GODFREY H. |date=September 1916|journal=British Journal of Psychology |language=en |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=271\u2013281 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1916.tb00133.x |issn=0950-5652|title=A Hierarchy Without a General Factor1 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1447717 }}</ref> Today's factor models of intelligence typically represent cognitive abilities as a three-level hierarchy, where there are many narrow [[Factor analysis|factors]] at the bottom of the hierarchy, a handful of broad, more general factors at the intermediate level, and at the apex a single factor, referred to as the ''g'' factor, which represents the variance common to all cognitive tasks.\n\nTraditionally, research on ''g'' has concentrated on psychometric investigations of test data, with a special emphasis on [[factor analysis|factor analytic]] approaches. However, empirical research on the nature of ''g'' has also drawn upon experimental [[cognitive psychology]] and [[mental chronometry]], brain anatomy and physiology, [[quantitative genetics|quantitative]] and [[molecular genetics]], and [[Evolution of human intelligence|primate evolution]].<ref>Jensen 1998, 545</ref> Some scientists consider ''g'' as a statistical regularity and uncontroversial, and a general cognitive factor appears in data collected from people in nearly every human culture.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Warne|first=Russell T.|last2=Burningham|first2=Cassidy|date=2019|title=Spearman's g found in 31 non-Western nations: Strong evidence that g is a universal phenomenon|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=145|issue=3|pages=237\u2013272|doi=10.1037/bul0000184|pmid=30640496|url=http://psyarxiv.com/uv673/}}</ref> Yet, there is no consensus as to what causes the positive correlations between tests.\n\nResearch in the field of [[behavioral genetics]] has established that the construct of ''g'' is highly [[Heritability of IQ|heritable]]. It has a number of other biological correlates, including [[brain size]]. It is also a significant predictor of individual differences in many social outcomes, particularly in education and employment. The most widely accepted contemporary theories of intelligence incorporate the ''g'' factor.<ref>Neisser et al. 1996</ref> However, critics of ''g'' have contended that an emphasis on ''g'' is misplaced and entails a devaluation of other important abilities. [[Stephen Jay Gould|Stephen J.

Specific domains assessed by tests include mathematical skill, verbal fluency, spatial visualization, and memory, among others. However, individuals who excel at one type of test tend to excel at other kinds of tests, too, while those who do poorly on one test tend to do so on all tests, regardless of the tests' contents.<ref>Gottfredson 1998</ref> The English psychologist Charles Spearman was the first to describe this phenomenon.<ref>Deary 2001, 12</ref> In a famous research paper published in 1904,<ref>Spearman 1904</ref> he observed that children's performance measures across seemingly unrelated school subjects were positively correlated. This finding has since been replicated numerous times. The consistent finding of universally positive [[correlation matrix|correlation matrices]] of mental test results (or the \"positive manifold\"), despite large differences in tests' contents, has been described as \"arguably the most replicated result in all psychology\".<ref>Deary 2000, 6</ref> Zero or negative correlations between tests suggest the presence of [[sampling error]] or restriction of the range of ability in the sample studied.<ref name=\"jensen1992\">Jensen 1992</ref>\n\nUsing [[factor analysis]] or related statistical methods, it is possible to compute a single common factor that can be regarded as a summary variable characterizing the correlations between all the different tests in a test battery. Spearman referred to this common factor as the ''general factor'', or simply ''g''. (By convention, ''g'' is always printed as a lower case italic.) Mathematically, the ''g'' factor is ''a source of variance among individuals'', which entails that one cannot meaningfully speak of any one individual's mental abilities consisting of ''g'' or other factors to any specified degrees. One can only speak of an individual's standing on ''g'' (or other factors) compared to other individuals in a relevant population.<ref name=\"jensen1992\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 28</ref><ref name=\"maas\">van deer Maas et al. 2006</ref>\n\nDifferent tests in a test battery may correlate with (or \"load onto\") the ''g'' factor of the battery to different degrees. These correlations are known as ''g'' loadings. An individual test taker's ''g'' factor score, representing his or her relative standing on the ''g'' factor in the total group of individuals, can be estimated using the ''g'' loadings. Full-scale IQ scores from a test battery will usually be highly correlated with ''g'' factor scores, and they are often regarded as estimates of ''g''. For example, the correlations between ''g'' factor scores and full-scale IQ scores from [[David Wechsler]]'s tests have been found to be greater than .95.<ref name=\"kamphaus2005\"/><ref name=\"jensen1992\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 26, 36\u201339</ref> The terms IQ, general intelligence, general cognitive ability, general mental ability, or simply intelligence are frequently used interchangeably to refer to the common core shared by cognitive tests.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/>\n\nThe ''g'' loadings of mental tests are always positive and usually range between .10 and .90, with a mean of about .60 and a standard deviation of about .15. [[Raven's Progressive Matrices]] is among the tests with the highest ''g'' loadings, around .80. Tests of vocabulary and general information are also typically found to have high ''g'' loadings.<ref>Jensen 1998, 26, 36\u201339, 89\u201390</ref><ref name=\"Jensen 2002\">Jensen 2002</ref> However, the ''g'' loading of the same test may vary somewhat depending on the composition of the test battery.<ref name=\"floyd2009\">Floyd et al. 2009</ref>\n\nThe complexity of tests and the demands they place on mental manipulation are related to the tests' ''g'' loadings. For example, in the forward digit span test the subject is asked to repeat a sequence of digits in the order of their presentation after hearing them once at a rate of one digit per second. The backward digit span test is otherwise the same except that the subject is asked to repeat the digits in the reverse order to that in which they were presented. The backward digit span test is more complex than the forward digit span test, and it has a significantly higher ''g'' loading. Similarly, the ''g'' loadings of arithmetic computation, spelling, and word reading tests are lower than those of arithmetic problem solving, text composition, and reading comprehension tests, respectively.<ref name=\"jensen1992\"/><ref name=\"Jensen 1980, 213\">Jensen 1980, 213</ref>\n\nTest difficulty and ''g'' loadings are distinct concepts that may or may not be empirically related in any specific situation. Tests that have the same difficulty level, as indexed by the proportion of test items that are failed by test takers, may exhibit a wide range of ''g'' loadings. For example, tests of [[rote memory]] have been shown to have the same level of difficulty but considerably lower ''g'' loadings than many tests that involve reasoning.<ref name=\"Jensen 1980, 213\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 94</ref>\n\n==Theories==\n\nWhile the existence of ''g'' as a statistical regularity is well-established and uncontroversial among experts, there is no consensus as to what causes the positive intercorrelations. Several explanations have been proposed.<ref name=\"Hunt 2011, 94\">Hunt 2011, 94</ref>\n\n===Mental energy or efficiency===\n\nCharles Spearman reasoned that correlations between tests reflected the influence of a common causal factor, a general mental ability that enters into performance on all kinds of mental tasks. However, he thought that the best indicators of ''g'' were those tests that reflected what he called ''the eduction of relations and correlates'', which included abilities such as [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], problem solving, grasping relationships, inferring rules, and spotting differences and similarities. Spearman hypothesized that ''g'' was equivalent with \"mental energy\". However, this was more of a metaphorical explanation, and he remained agnostic about the physical basis of this energy, expecting that future research would uncover the exact physiological nature of ''g''.<ref>Jensen 1998, 18\u201319, 35\u201336, 38. The idea of a general, unitary mental ability was introduced to psychology by [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Francis Galton]] in the latter half of the 19th century, but their work was largely speculative, with little empirical basis.</ref>\n\nFollowing Spearman, [[Arthur Jensen]] maintained that all mental tasks tap into ''g'' to some degree. According to Jensen, the ''g'' factor represents a \"distillate\" of scores on different tests rather than a summation or an average of such scores, with factor analysis acting as the [[distillation]] procedure.<ref name=\"Jensen 2002\"/> He argued that ''g'' cannot be described in terms of the item characteristics or information content of tests, pointing out that very dissimilar mental tasks may have nearly equal ''g'' loadings.  Wechsler similarly contended that ''g'' is not an ability at all but rather some general property of the brain. Jensen hypothesized that ''g'' corresponds to individual differences in the speed or efficiency of the neural processes associated with mental abilities.<ref>Jensen 1998, 91\u201392, 95</ref> He also suggested that given the associations between ''g'' and [[#Elementary cognitive tasks|elementary cognitive tasks]], it should be possible to construct a [[ratio scale]] test of ''g'' that uses [[time]] as the unit of measurement.<ref>Jensen 2000</ref>\n\n===Sampling theory===\n\nThe so-called sampling theory of ''g'', originally developed by [[E.L. Thorndike]] and [[Godfrey Thomson]], proposes that the existence of the positive manifold can be explained without reference to a unitary underlying capacity. According to this theory, there are a number of uncorrelated mental processes, and all tests draw upon different samples of these processes. The intercorrelations between tests are caused by an overlap between processes tapped by the tests.<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 157</ref><ref>Jensen 1998, 117</ref> Thus, the positive manifold arises due to a measurement problem, an inability to measure more fine-grained, presumably uncorrelated mental processes.<ref name=\"maas\"/>\n\nIt has been shown that it is not possible to distinguish statistically between Spearman's model of ''g'' and the sampling model; both are equally able to account for intercorrelations among tests.<ref>Bartholomew et al. 2009</ref> The sampling theory is also consistent with the observation that more complex mental tasks have higher ''g'' loadings, because more complex tasks are expected to involve a larger sampling of neural elements and therefore have more of them in common with other tasks.<ref>Jensen 1998, 120</ref>\n\nSome researchers have argued that the sampling model invalidates ''g'' as a psychological concept, because the model suggests that ''g'' factors derived from different test batteries simply reflect the shared elements of the particular tests contained in each battery rather than a ''g'' that is common to all tests. Similarly, high correlations between different batteries could be due to them measuring the same set of abilities rather than ''the'' same ability.<ref name=\"horn&mcardle\"/>\n\nCritics have argued that the sampling theory is incongruent with certain empirical findings. Based on the sampling theory, one might expect that related cognitive tests share many elements and thus be highly correlated. However, some closely related tests, such as forward and backward digit span, are only modestly correlated, while some seemingly completely dissimilar tests, such as vocabulary tests and Raven's matrices, are consistently highly correlated. Another problematic finding is that brain damage frequently leads to specific cognitive impairments rather than a general impairment one might expect based on the sampling theory.<ref name=\"maas\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 120\u2013121</ref>\n\n===Mutualism===\n\nThe \"mutualism\" model of ''g'' proposes that cognitive processes are initially uncorrelated, but that the positive manifold arises during individual development due to mutual beneficial relations between cognitive processes. Thus there is no single process or capacity underlying the positive correlations between tests. During the course of development, the theory holds, any one particularly efficient process will benefit other processes, with the result that the processes will end up being correlated with one another. Thus similarly high IQs in different persons may stem from quite different initial advantages that they had.<ref name=\"maas\"/><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 157\u2013158</ref> Critics have argued that the observed correlations between the ''g'' loadings and the heritability coefficients of subtests are problematic for the mutualism theory.<ref name=RJ2010/>\n\n===Social exchange and sexual selection===\n{{multiple image\n |align    = right\n |width    = 175\n |direction= vertical\n |image1   = Wason selection task cards.svg\n |caption1 = Each card has a number on one side, and a patch of color on the other.

Initially, he developed a model of intelligence in which variations in all intelligence test scores are explained by only two kinds of variables: first, factors that are specific to each test (denoted ''s''); and second, a ''g'' factor that accounts for the positive correlations across tests. This is known as Spearman's two-factor theory. Later research based on more diverse test batteries than those used by Spearman demonstrated that ''g'' alone could not account for all correlations between tests. Specifically, it was found that even after controlling for ''g'', some tests were still correlated with each other. This led to the postulation of ''group factors'' that represent variance that groups of tests with similar task demands (e.g., verbal, spatial, or numerical) have in common in addition to the shared ''g'' variance.<ref>Jensen 1998, 18, 31\u201332</ref>\n\n[[Image:Carroll three stratum model of human Intelligence.png|right|thumb|500px|An illustration of [[John B. Carroll]]'s [[three stratum theory]], an influential contemporary model of cognitive abilities. The broad abilities recognized by the model are fluid intelligence (Gf), crystallized intelligence (Gc), general memory and learning (Gy), broad visual perception (Gv), broad auditory perception (Gu), broad retrieval ability (Gr), broad cognitive speediness (Gs), and processing speed (Gt). Carroll regarded the broad abilities as different \"flavors\" of ''g''.]]\n\nThrough [[Factor analysis#Rotation methods|factor rotation]], it is, in principle, possible to produce an infinite number of different factor solutions that are mathematically equivalent in their ability to account for the intercorrelations among cognitive tests. These include solutions that do not contain a ''g'' factor. Thus factor analysis alone cannot establish what the underlying structure of intelligence is. In choosing between different factor solutions, researchers have to examine the results of factor analysis together with other information about the structure of cognitive abilities.<ref name=\"carroll1995\">Carroll 1995</ref>\n\nThere are many psychologically relevant reasons for preferring factor solutions that contain a ''g'' factor. These include the existence of the positive manifold, the fact that certain kinds of tests (generally the more complex ones) have consistently larger ''g'' loadings, the substantial invariance of ''g'' factors across different test batteries, the impossibility of constructing test batteries that do not yield a ''g'' factor, and the widespread practical validity of ''g'' as a predictor of individual outcomes. The ''g'' factor, together with group factors, best represents the empirically established fact that, on average, overall ability differences ''between'' individuals are greater than differences among abilities ''within'' individuals, while a factor solution with orthogonal factors without ''g'' obscures this fact. Moreover, ''g'' appears to be the most heritable component of intelligence.<ref name=\"jensen1982\">Jensen 1982</ref> Research utilizing the techniques of [[confirmatory factor analysis]] has also provided support for the existence of ''g''.<ref name=\"carroll1995\"/>\n\nA ''g'' factor can be computed from a correlation matrix of test results using several different methods. These include exploratory factor analysis, [[principal components analysis]] (PCA), and confirmatory factor analysis. Different factor-extraction methods produce highly consistent results, although PCA has sometimes been found to produce inflated estimates of the influence of ''g'' on test scores.<ref name=\"floyd2009\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 73</ref>\n\nThere is a broad contemporary consensus that cognitive variance between people can be conceptualized at three hierarchical levels, distinguished by their degree of generality. At the lowest, least general level there are many narrow first-order factors; at a higher level, there are a relatively small number \u2013 somewhere between five and ten \u2013 of broad (i.e., more general) second-order factors (or group factors); and at the apex, there is a single third-order factor, ''g'', the general factor common to all tests.<ref name=\"deary2012\">Deary 2012</ref><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 57</ref><ref>Jensen 1998, 46</ref> The ''g'' factor usually accounts for the majority of the total common factor variance of IQ test batteries.<ref>Carroll 1997. The total common factor variance consists of the variance due to the ''g'' factor and the group factors considered together. The variance not accounted for by the common factors, referred to as ''uniqueness'', comprises subtest-specific variance and measurement error.</ref> Contemporary hierarchical models of intelligence include the [[three stratum theory]] and the [[Cattell\u2013Horn\u2013Carroll theory]].<ref name=\"d&k\">Davidson & Kemp 2011</ref>\n\n==\"Indifference of the indicator\"==\n\nSpearman proposed the principle of the ''indifference of the indicator'', according to which the precise content of intelligence tests is unimportant for the purposes of identifying ''g'', because ''g'' enters into performance on all kinds of tests. Any test can therefore be used as an indicator of ''g''.<ref name=\":2\" /> Following Spearman, Arthur Jensen more recently argued that a ''g'' factor extracted from one test battery will always be the same, within the limits of measurement error, as that extracted from another battery, provided that the batteries are large and diverse.<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 151</ref> According to this view, every mental test, no matter how distinctive, calls on ''g'' to some extent. Thus a composite score of a number of different tests will load onto ''g'' more strongly than any of the individual test scores, because the ''g'' components cumulate into the composite score, while the uncorrelated non-''g'' components will cancel each other out. Theoretically, the composite score of an infinitely large, diverse test battery would, then, be a perfect measure of ''g''.<ref>Jensen 1998, 31</ref>\n\nIn contrast, [[L.L. Thurstone]] argued that a ''g'' factor extracted from a test battery reflects the average of all the abilities called for by the particular battery, and that ''g'' therefore varies from one battery to another and \"has no fundamental psychological significance.\"<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 151\u2013153</ref> Along similar lines, [[John L. Horn|John Horn]] argued that ''g'' factors are meaningless because they are not invariant across test batteries, maintaining that correlations between different ability measures arise because it is difficult to define a human action that depends on just one ability.<ref name=\"McGrew 2005\">McGrew 2005</ref><ref>Kvist & Gustafsson 2008</ref>\n\nTo show that different batteries reflect the same ''g'', one must administer several test batteries to the same individuals, extract ''g'' factors from each battery, and show that the factors are highly correlated. This can be done within a confirmatory factor analysis framework.<ref name=\"Hunt 2011, 94\"/> Wendy Johnson and colleagues have published two such studies.<ref>Johnson et al. 2004</ref><ref>Johnson et al. 2008</ref> The first found that the correlations between ''g'' factors extracted from three different batteries were .99, .99, and 1.00, supporting the hypothesis that ''g'' factors from different batteries are the same and that the identification of ''g'' is not dependent on the specific abilities assessed. The second study found that ''g'' factors derived from four of five test batteries correlated at between .95\u20131.00, while the correlations ranged from .79 to .96 for the fifth battery, the [[Culture Fair Intelligence Test|Cattell Culture Fair Intelligence Test]] (the CFIT). They attributed the somewhat lower correlations with the CFIT battery to its lack of content diversity for it contains only matrix-type items, and interpreted the findings as supporting the contention that ''g'' factors derived from different test batteries are the same provided that the batteries are diverse enough. The results suggest that the same ''g'' can be consistently identified from different test batteries.<ref name=\"deary2012\"/><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 150\u2013153. See also Keith et al. 2001 where the ''g'' factors from the [[Cognitive Assessment System|CAS]] and [[Woodcock\u2013Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities|WJ III]] test batteries were found to be statistically indistinguishable, and Stauffer et al. 1996 where similar results were found for the [[Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery|ASVAB]] battery and a battery of cognitive-components-based tests.</ref>\n\n==Population distribution==\n\nThe form of the population distribution of ''g'' is unknown, because ''g'' cannot be measured on a [[ratio scale]]{{clarify|date=March 2018}}. (The distributions of scores on typical IQ tests are roughly normal, but this is achieved by construction, i.e., by [[Normalization (statistics)|normalizing]] the raw scores.) It has been argued{{who|date=May 2017}} that there are nevertheless good reasons for supposing that ''g'' is [[Normal distribution|normally distributed]] in the general population, at least within a range of \u00b12 standard deviations from the mean. In particular, ''g'' can be thought of as a composite variable that reflects the additive effects of many independent genetic and environmental influences, and such a variable should, according to the [[central limit theorem]], follow a normal distribution.<ref>Jensen 1998, 88, 101\u2013103</ref>\n\n==Spearman's law of diminishing returns==\nA number of researchers have suggested that the proportion of variation accounted for by ''g'' may not be uniform across all subgroups within a population. ''Spearman's law of diminishing returns'' (SLODR), also termed the ''cognitive ability differentiation hypothesis'', predicts that the positive correlations among different cognitive abilities are weaker among more intelligent subgroups of individuals.  More specifically, (SLODR) predicts that the ''g'' factor will account for a smaller proportion of individual differences in cognitive tests scores at higher scores on the ''g'' factor.\n\n(SLODR) was originally proposed by [[Charles Spearman]],<ref>Spearman, C. (1927). ''The abilities of man''. New York: MacMillan.</ref> who reported that the average correlation between 12 cognitive ability tests was .466 in 78 normal children, and .782 in 22 \"defective\" children.  Detterman and Daniel rediscovered this phenomenon in 1989.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Detterman | first1 = D.K. | last2 = Daniel | first2 = M.H. | year = 1989 | title = Correlations of mental tests with each other and with cognitive variables are highest for low IQ groups | url = | journal = Intelligence | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 349\u2013359 | doi = 10.1016/s0160-2896(89)80007-8 }}</ref> They reported that for subtests of both the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|WAIS]] and the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC]], subtest intercorrelations decreased monotonically with ability group, ranging from approximately an average intercorrelation of .7 among individuals with IQs less than 78 to .4 among individuals with IQs greater than 122.<ref>Deary & Pagliari 1991</ref>\n\n(SLODR) has been replicated in a variety of child and adult samples who have been measured using broad arrays of cognitive tests.  The most common approach has been to divide individuals into multiple ability groups using an observable proxy for their general intellectual ability, and then to either compare the average interrelation among the subtests across the different groups, or to compare the proportion of variation accounted for by a single common factor, in the different groups.<ref name=\"deary et al\">Deary et al. 1996</ref> However, as both Deary et al. (1996).<ref name=\"deary et al\"/> and Tucker-Drob (2009)<ref name=\"Tucker-Drob, E. M. 2009\">Tucker-Drob 2009</ref> have pointed out, dividing the continuous distribution of intelligence into an arbitrary number of discrete ability groups is less than ideal for examining (SLODR).  Tucker-Drob (2009)<ref name=\"Tucker-Drob, E. M. 2009\"/> extensively reviewed the literature on (SLODR) and the various methods by which it had been previously tested, and proposed that (SLODR) could be most appropriately captured by fitting a common factor model that allows the relations between the factor and its indicators to be nonlinear in nature.  He applied such a factor model to a nationally representative data of children and adults in the United States and found consistent evidence for (SLODR). For example, Tucker-Drob (2009) found that a general factor accounted for approximately 75% of the variation in seven different cognitive abilities among very low IQ adults, but only accounted for approximately 30% of the variation in the abilities among very high IQ adults.\n\nA recent meta-analytic study by Blum and Holling<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Blum | first1 = D. | last2 = Holling | first2 = H. | year = 2017 | title = Spearman's Law of Diminishing Returns. A meta-analysis | url = | journal = Intelligence | volume = 65 | issue = | pages = 60\u201366 | doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2017.07.004 }}</ref> also provided support for the differentiation hypothesis. As opposed to most research on the topic, this work made it possible to study ability and age variables as continuous predictors of the ''g'' saturation, and not just to compare lower- vs. higher-skilled or younger vs. older groups of testees. Results demonstrate that the mean correlation and ''g'' loadings of cognitive ability tests decrease with increasing ability, yet increase with respondent age. (SLODR), as described by [[Charles Spearman]], could be confirmed by a ''g''-saturation decrease as a function of IQ as well as a ''g''-saturation increase from middle age to senescence. Specifically speaking, for samples with a mean intelligence that is two standard deviations (i.e., 30 IQ-points) higher, the mean correlation to be expected is decreased by approximately .15 points. The question remains whether a difference of this magnitude could result in a greater apparent factorial complexity when cognitive data are factored for the higher-ability sample, as opposed to the lower-ability sample. It seems likely that greater factor dimensionality should tend to be observed for the case of higher ability, but the magnitude of this effect (i.e., how much more likely and how many more factors) remains uncertain.\n\n==Practical validity==\n\nThe practical validity of ''g'' as a predictor of educational, economic, and social outcomes is more far-ranging and universal than that of any other known psychological variable. The validity of ''g'' increases as the complexity of the measured task increases.<ref name=\"Jensen 1998, 270\">Jensen 1998, 270</ref><ref>Gottfredson 2002</ref>\n\nA test's practical validity is measured by its correlation with performance on some criterion external to the test, such as college grade-point average, or a rating of job performance. The correlation between test scores and a measure of some criterion is called the ''validity coefficient''. One way to interpret a validity coefficient is to square it to obtain the [[Coefficient of determination|variance accounted]] by the test. For example, a validity coefficient of .30 corresponds to 9 percent of variance explained. This approach has, however, been criticized as misleading and uninformative, and several alternatives have been proposed. One arguably more interpretable approach is to look at the percentage of test takers in each test score [[wikt:quintile|quintile]] who meet some agreed-upon standard of success. For example, if the correlation between test scores and performance is .30, the expectation is that 67 percent of those in the top quintile will be above-average performers, compared to 33 percent of those in the bottom quintile.<ref name=\"sackett2008\">Sackett et al. 2008</ref><ref>Jensen 1998, 272, 301</ref>\n\n===Academic achievement===\n\nThe predictive validity of ''g'' is most conspicuous in the domain of scholastic performance. This is apparently because ''g'' is closely linked to the ability to learn novel material and understand concepts and meanings.<ref name=\"Jensen 1998, 270\"/>\n\nIn elementary school, the correlation between IQ and grades and achievement scores is between .60 and .70. At more advanced educational levels, more students from the lower end of the IQ distribution drop out, which restricts the range of IQs and results in lower validity coefficients. In high school, college, and graduate school the validity coefficients are .50\u2013.60, .40\u2013.50, and .30\u2013.40, respectively. The ''g'' loadings of IQ scores are high, but it is possible that some of the validity of IQ in predicting scholastic achievement is attributable to factors measured by IQ independent of ''g''. According to research by [[Robert L. Thorndike]], 80 to 90 percent of the ''predictable'' variance in scholastic performance is due to ''g'', with the rest attributed to non-''g'' factors measured by IQ and other tests.<ref>Jensen 1998, 279\u2013280</ref>\n\nAchievement test scores are more highly correlated with IQ than school grades. This may be because grades are more influenced by the teacher's idiosyncratic perceptions of the student.<ref>Jensen 1998, 279</ref> In a longitudinal English study, ''g'' scores measured at age 11 correlated with all the 25 subject tests of the national [[GCSE]] examination taken at age 16. The correlations ranged from .77 for the mathematics test to .42 for the art test. The correlation between ''g'' and a general educational factor computed from the GCSE tests was .81.<ref name=\"brody2006\">Brody 2006</ref>\n\nResearch suggests that the [[SAT]], widely used in college admissions, is primarily a measure of ''g''. A correlation of .82 has been found between ''g'' scores computed from an IQ test battery and SAT scores. In a study of 165,000 students at 41 U.S. colleges, SAT scores were found to be correlated at .47 with first-year college grade-point average after correcting for range restriction in SAT scores (the correlation rises to .55 when course difficulty is held constant, i.e., if all students attended the same set of classes).<ref name=\"sackett2008\"/><ref>Frey & Detterman 2004</ref>\n\n===Job attainment===\n\nThere is a high correlation of .90 to .95 between the prestige rankings of occupations, as rated by the general population, and the ''average'' general intelligence scores of people employed in each occupation. At the level of individual employees, the association between job prestige and ''g'' is lower \u2013 one large U.S. study reported a correlation of .65 (.72 [[Correction for attenuation|corrected for attenuation]]). Mean level of ''g'' thus increases with perceived job prestige. It has also been found that the [[Statistical dispersion|dispersion]] of general intelligence scores is smaller in more prestigious occupations than in lower level occupations, suggesting that higher level occupations have minimum ''g'' requirements.<ref name=\"s&h\">Schmidt & Hunter 2004</ref><ref>Jensen 1998, 292\u2013293</ref>\n\n=== Job performance ===\nResearch indicates that tests of ''g'' are the best single predictors of job performance, with an average validity coefficient of .55 across several meta-analyses of studies based on supervisor ratings and job samples. The average meta-analytic validity coefficient for performance in job ''training'' is .63.<ref>Schmidt & Hunter 2004. These validity coefficients have been corrected for measurement error in the dependent variable (i.e., job or training performance) and for range restriction but not for measurement error in the independent variable (i.e., measures of ''g'').</ref> The validity of ''g'' in the highest complexity jobs (professional, scientific, and upper management jobs) has been found to be greater than in the lowest complexity jobs, but ''g'' has predictive validity even for the simplest jobs. Research also shows that specific aptitude tests tailored for each job provide little or no increase in predictive validity over tests of general intelligence. It is believed that ''g'' affects job performance mainly by facilitating the acquisition of job-related knowledge. The predictive validity of ''g'' is greater than that of work experience, and increased experience on the job does not decrease the validity of ''g''.<ref name=\"Jensen 1998, 270\"/><ref name=\"s&h\"/>\n\nIn a 2011 meta-analysis, researchers found that general cognitive ability (GCA) predicted job performance better than personality ([[Five factor model]]) and three streams of [[emotional intelligence]]. They examined the relative importance of these constructs on predicting job performance and found that cognitive ability explained most of the variance in job performance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=O'Boyle Jr.|first=E.

For instance, an employee with low GCA will compensate his/her task performance and OCB, if [[emotional intelligence]] is high.\n\nAlthough these compensatory effects favour [[emotional intelligence]], GCA still remains as the best predictor of job performance. Several researchers have studied the correlation between GCA and job performance among different job positions. For instance, Ghiselli (1973)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ghiselli|first=E.

Although the former is better than subjective ratings, most of studies in job performance and GCA have been based on supervisor performance ratings. This rating criteria is considered problematic and unreliable, mainly because of its difficulty to define what is a good and bad performance. Rating of supervisors tends to be subjective and inconsistent among employees.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gottfredson|first=L.

These findings were surprising, considering that the main criteria for assessing these employees would be the objective sales.\n\nIn understanding how GCA is associated job performance, several researchers concluded that GCA affects acquisition of job knowledge, which in turn improves [[job performance]]. In other words, people high in GCA are capable to learn faster and acquire more job knowledge easily, which allow them to perform better. Conversely, lack of ability to acquire job knowledge will directly affect job performance. This is due to low levels of GCA. Also, GCA has a direct effect on job performance. In a daily basis, employees are exposed constantly to challenges and problem solving tasks, which success depends solely on their GCA.

Moreover, studies on GCA and job performance are always susceptible to range restriction, because data is gathered mostly from current employees, neglecting those that were not hired. Hence, sample comes from employees who successfully passed hiring process, including measures of GCA.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=J. E.|last2=Schmidt|first2=F.

The correlation is higher at higher levels of education and it increases with age, stabilizing when people reach their highest career potential in middle age. Even when education, occupation and socioeconomic background are held constant, the correlation does not vanish.<ref>Jensen 1998, 568</ref>\n\n===Other correlates===\n\nThe ''g'' factor is reflected in many social outcomes. Many social behavior problems, such as dropping out of school, chronic welfare dependency, accident proneness, and crime, are negatively correlated with ''g'' independent of social class of origin.<ref>Jensen 1998, 271</ref> Health and mortality outcomes are also linked to ''g'', with higher childhood test scores predicting better health and mortality outcomes in adulthood (see [[Cognitive epidemiology]]).<ref>Gottfredson 2007</ref>\n\n==Genetic and environmental determinants==\n{{Main|Heritability of IQ}}\n\nHeritability is the proportion of phenotypic variance in a trait in a population that can be attributed to genetic factors. The heritability of ''g'' has been estimated to fall between 40 and 80 percent using twin, adoption, and other family study designs as well as molecular genetic methods. Estimates based on the totality of evidence place the heritability of ''g'' at about 50%.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Plomin |first=Robert |last2=Spinath |first2=Frank M. |date=April 2002 |title=Genetics and general cognitive ability (g) |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=169\u2013176 |doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(00)01853-2 |pmid=11912040 |issn=1364-6613}}</ref> It has been found to increase linearly with age. For example, a large study involving more than 11,000 pairs of twins from four countries reported the heritability of ''g'' to be 41 percent at age nine, 55 percent at age twelve, and 66 percent at age seventeen. Other studies have estimated that the heritability is as high as 80 percent in adulthood, although it may decline in old age. Most of the research on the heritability of ''g'' has been conducted in the United States and [[Western Europe]], but studies in Russia ([[Moscow]]), the former [[East Germany]], Japan, and rural India have yielded similar estimates of heritability as Western studies.<ref name=\"deary2012\"/><ref>Deary et al. 2006</ref><ref name=\"plomin&spinath\">Plomin & Spinath 2004</ref><ref>Haworth et al. 2010</ref>\n\nBehavioral genetic research has also established that the shared (or between-family) environmental effects on ''g'' are strong in childhood, but decline thereafter and are negligible in adulthood. This indicates that the environmental effects that are important to the development of ''g'' are unique and not shared between members of the same family.<ref name=\"plomin&spinath\"/>\n\nThe [[genetic correlation]] is a statistic that indicates the extent to which the same genetic effects influence two different traits. If the genetic correlation between two traits is zero, the genetic effects on them are independent, whereas a correlation of 1.0 means that the same set of genes explains the heritability of both traits (regardless of how high or low the heritability of each is). Genetic correlations between specific mental abilities (such as verbal ability and spatial ability) have been consistently found to be very high, close to 1.0. This indicates that genetic variation in cognitive abilities is almost entirely due to genetic variation in whatever ''g'' is. It also suggests that what is common among cognitive abilities is largely caused by genes, and that independence among abilities is largely due to environmental effects. Thus it has been argued that when genes for intelligence are identified, they will be \"generalist genes\", each affecting many different cognitive abilities.<ref name=\"plomin&spinath\"/><ref>Kovas & Plomin 2006</ref><ref name=\"penke2007\">Penke et al. 2007</ref>\n\nThe ''g'' loadings of mental tests have been found to correlate with their heritabilities, with correlations ranging from moderate to perfect in various studies. Thus the heritability of a mental test is usually higher the larger its ''g'' loading is.<ref name=RJ2010>Rushton & Jensen 2010</ref>\n\nMuch research points to ''g'' being a highly [[Polygenic inheritance#Quantitative traits|polygenic trait]] influenced by many common genetic variants, each having only small effects. Another possibility is that heritable differences in ''g'' are due to individuals having different [[Genetic load|\"loads\"]] of rare, deleterious mutations, with genetic variation among individuals persisting due to [[mutation\u2013selection balance]].<ref name=\"penke2007\"/><ref name=\"Chabris\">Chabris et al. 2012</ref>\n\nA number of [[candidate gene]]s have been reported to be associated with intelligence differences, but the effect sizes have been small and almost none of the findings have been replicated. No individual genetic variants have been conclusively linked to intelligence in the normal range so far. Many researchers believe that very large samples will be needed to reliably detect individual genetic polymorphisms associated with ''g''.<ref name=\"deary2012\"/><ref name=\"Chabris\"/> However, while genes influencing variation in ''g'' in the normal range have proven difficult to find, many [[Single gene disorder|single-gene disorders]] with [[mental retardation]] among their symptoms have been discovered.<ref>Plomin 2003</ref>\n\nSeveral studies suggest that tests with larger ''g'' loadings are more affected by [[inbreeding depression]] lowering test scores. There is also evidence that tests with larger ''g'' loadings are associated with larger positive [[Heterosis|heterotic]] effects on test scores. Inbreeding depression and heterosis suggest the presence of [[Dominance (genetics)|genetic dominance effects]] for ''g''.<ref>Jensen 1998, 189\u2013197</ref>\n\n==Neuroscientific findings==\n{{Main|Neuroscience and intelligence}}\n\n''g'' has a number of correlates in the brain. Studies using [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) have established that ''g'' and total brain volume are moderately correlated (r~.3\u2013.4). External head size has a correlation of ~.2 with ''g''. MRI research on brain regions indicates that the volumes of [[Frontal cortex|frontal]], [[Parietal cortex|parietal]] and [[Temporal cortex|temporal cortices]], and the [[hippocampus]] are also correlated with ''g'', generally at .25 or more, while the correlations, averaged over many studies, with overall [[grey matter]] and overall [[white matter]] have been found to be .31 and .27, respectively. Some but not all studies have also found positive correlations between ''g'' and cortical thickness. However, the underlying reasons for these associations between the quantity of brain tissue and differences in cognitive abilities remain largely unknown.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/>\n\nMost researchers believe that intelligence cannot be localized to a single brain region, such as the frontal lobe. Brain [[lesion]] studies have found small but consistent associations indicating that people with more white matter lesions tend to have lower cognitive ability. Research utilizing [[NMR spectroscopy]] has discovered somewhat inconsistent but generally positive correlations between intelligence and white matter integrity, supporting the notion that white matter is important for intelligence.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/>\n\nSome research suggests that aside from the integrity of white matter, also its organizational efficiency is related to intelligence. The hypothesis that brain efficiency has a role in intelligence is supported by functional MRI research showing that more intelligent people generally process information more efficiently, i.e., they use fewer brain resources for the same task than less intelligent people.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/>\n\nSmall but relatively consistent associations with intelligence test scores include also brain activity, as measured by [[EEG|EEG records]] or [[event-related potential]]s, and [[nerve conduction velocity]].<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 134\u2013138</ref><ref name=\"chabris2007\">Chabris 2007</ref>\n\n==''g'' in non-humans==\n\n{{Main|g factor in non-humans}}\n\nEvidence of a general factor of intelligence has also been observed in non-human animals.

[[Myopia]] is known to be associated with intelligence, with a correlation of around .2 to .25, and this association has been found within families, too.<ref>Jensen 1998, 146, 149\u2013150</ref>\n\n==Group similarities and differences==\n\n{{See also|Sex and psychology|Race and intelligence|Nations and intelligence}}\n\nCross-cultural studies indicate that the ''g'' factor can be observed whenever a battery of diverse, complex cognitive tests is administered to a human sample. The factor structure of IQ tests has also been found to be consistent across sexes and ethnic groups in the U.S. and elsewhere.<ref name=\"chabris2007\"/> The ''g'' factor has been found to be the most invariant of all factors in cross-cultural comparisons. For example, when the ''g'' factors computed from an American standardization sample of Wechsler's IQ battery and from large samples who completed the Japanese translation of the same battery were compared, the [[congruence coefficient]] was .99, indicating virtual identity. Similarly, the congruence coefficient between the ''g'' factors obtained from white and black standardization samples of the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC]] battery in the U.S. was .995, and the variance in test scores accounted for by ''g'' was highly similar for both groups.<ref>Jensen 1998, 87\u201388</ref>\n\nMost studies suggest that there are negligible differences in the mean level of ''g'' between the sexes, and that sex differences in cognitive abilities are to be found in more narrow domains. For example, males generally outperform females in spatial tasks, while females generally outperform males in verbal tasks. Another difference that has been found in many studies is that males show more variability in both general and specific abilities than females, with proportionately more males at both the low end and the high end of the test score distribution.<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 360\u2013373</ref>\n\nConsistent differences between racial and ethnic groups in ''g'' have been found, particularly in the U.S. A 2001 meta-analysis of millions of subjects indicated that there is a 1.1 standard deviation gap in the mean level of ''g'' between white and black Americans, favoring the former. The mean score of Hispanic Americans was found to be .72 standard deviations below that of non-Hispanic whites.<ref>Roth et al. 2001</ref> In contrast, Americans of East Asian descent generally slightly outscore white Americans.<ref>Hunt 2011, 421</ref> Several researchers have suggested that the magnitude of the black-white gap in cognitive ability tests is dependent on the magnitude of the test's ''g'' loading, with tests showing higher ''g'' loadings producing larger gaps (see [[Spearman's hypothesis]]).<ref>Jensen 1998, 369\u2013399</ref> It has also been claimed that racial and ethnic differences similar to those found in the U.S. can be observed globally.<ref>Lynn 2003</ref>\n\n==Relation to other psychological constructs==\n\n===Elementary cognitive tasks===\n{{Main|Elementary cognitive task|Mental chronometry}}\n[[Image:Jensen box.gif|right|thumb|300px|An illustration of the [[Jensen box]], an apparatus for measuring choice reaction time.]]\nElementary cognitive tasks (ECTs) also correlate strongly with ''g''.<!--{{Citation needed|reason=Really? According to whom? What?|date=September 2010}} See reference below.--> ECTs are, as the name suggests, simple tasks that apparently require very little intelligence, but still correlate strongly with more exhaustive intelligence tests. Determining whether a light is red or blue and determining whether there are four or five squares drawn on a computer screen are two examples of ECTs. The answers to such questions are usually provided by quickly pressing buttons. Often, in addition to buttons for the two options provided, a third button is held down from the start of the test. When the stimulus is given to the subject, they remove their hand from the starting button to the button of the correct answer. This allows the examiner to determine how much time was spent thinking about the answer to the question (reaction time, usually measured in small fractions of second), and how much time was spent on physical hand movement to the correct button (movement time).  Reaction time correlates strongly with ''g'', while movement time correlates less strongly.<ref>Jensen 1998, 213</ref>\nECT testing has allowed quantitative examination of hypotheses concerning test bias, subject motivation, and group differences.  By virtue of their simplicity, ECTs provide a link between classical IQ testing and biological inquiries such as [[fMRI]] studies.\n\n===Working memory===\n\nOne theory holds that ''g'' is identical or nearly identical to [[Working memory|working memory capacity]]. Among other evidence for this view, some studies have found factors representing ''g'' and working memory to be perfectly correlated. However, in a meta-analysis the correlation was found to be considerably lower.<ref>Ackerman et al. 2005</ref> One criticism that has been made of studies that identify ''g'' with working memory is that \"we do not advance understanding by showing that one mysterious concept is linked to another.\"<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 158</ref>\n\n===Piagetian tasks===\n\nPsychometric theories of intelligence aim at quantifying intellectual growth and identifying ability differences between individuals and groups. In contrast, [[Jean Piaget]]'s [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|theory of cognitive development]] seeks to understand qualitative changes in children's intellectual development. Piaget designed a number of tasks to verify hypotheses arising from his theory. The tasks were not intended to measure individual differences, and they have no equivalent in psychometric intelligence tests.<ref name=\"Weinberg 1989\">Weinberg 1989</ref><ref>Lautrey 2002</ref> For example, in one of the best-known Piagetian [[Conservation (psychology)|conservation tasks]] a child is asked if the amount of water in two identical glasses is the same. After the child agrees that the amount is the same, the investigator pours the water from one of the glasses into a glass of different shape so that the amount appears different although it remains the same. The child is then asked if the amount of water in the two glasses is the same or different.\n\nNotwithstanding the different research traditions in which psychometric tests and Piagetian tasks were developed, the correlations between the two types of measures have been found to be consistently positive and generally moderate in magnitude. A common general factor underlies them. It has been shown that it is possible to construct a battery consisting of Piagetian tasks that is as good a measure of ''g'' as standard IQ tests.<ref name=\"Weinberg 1989\"/><ref>Humphreys et al. 1985</ref>\n\n===Personality===\n{{Main|Intelligence and personality}}\nThe traditional view in psychology is that there is no meaningful relationship between [[personality]] and intelligence, and that the two should be studied separately. Intelligence can be understood in terms of what an individual ''can'' do, or what his or her ''maximal'' performance is, while personality can be thought of in terms of what an individual ''will typically'' do, or what his or her general tendencies of behavior are. Research has indicated that correlations between measures of intelligence and personality are small, and it has thus been argued that ''g'' is a purely cognitive variable that is independent of personality traits. In a 2007 meta-analysis the correlations between ''g'' and the [[Big Five personality traits|\"Big Five\"]] personality traits were found to be as follows:\n* conscientiousness \u2212.04\n* agreeableness .00\n* extraversion .02\n* openness .22\n* emotional stability .09\nThe same meta-analysis found a correlation of .20 between [[self-efficacy]] and ''g''.<ref name=\"Stumm2011\">von Stumm et al. 2011</ref><ref>Jensen 1998, 573</ref><ref>Judge et al. 2007</ref>\n\nSome researchers have argued that the associations between intelligence and personality, albeit modest, are consistent. They have interpreted correlations between intelligence and personality measures in two main ways. The first perspective is that personality traits influence performance on intelligence ''tests''. For example, a person may fail to perform at a maximal level on an IQ test due to his or her anxiety and stress-proneness. The second perspective considers intelligence and personality to be ''conceptually'' related, with personality traits determining how people apply and invest their cognitive abilities, leading to knowledge expansion and greater cognitive differentiation.<ref name=\"Stumm2011\"/><ref name=\"Stumm2009\">von Stumm et al. 2009</ref>\n\n===Creativity===\n\nSome researchers believe that there is a threshold level of ''g'' below which socially significant [[creativity]] is rare, but that otherwise there is no relationship between the two. It has been suggested that this threshold is at least one standard deviation above the population mean. Above the threshold, personality differences are believed to be important determinants of individual variation in creativity.<ref>Jensen 1998, 577</ref><ref>Eysenck 1995</ref>\n\nOthers have challenged the threshold theory. While not disputing that opportunity and personal attributes other than intelligence, such as energy and commitment, are important for creativity, they argue that ''g'' is positively associated with creativity even at the high end of the ability distribution. The longitudinal [[Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth]] has provided evidence for this contention. It has showed that individuals identified by standardized tests as intellectually gifted in early adolescence accomplish creative achievements (for example, securing patents or publishing literary or scientific works) at several times the rate of the general population, and that even within the top 1 percent of cognitive ability, those with higher ability are more likely to make outstanding achievements. The study has also suggested that the level of ''g'' acts as a predictor of the ''level'' of achievement, while specific cognitive ability patterns predict the ''realm'' of achievement.<ref>Lubinski 2009</ref><ref>Robertson et al. 2010</ref>\n\n==Challenges==\n\n===G''f''-G''c'' theory===\n\n{{Main|Fluid and crystallized intelligence}}\n\n[[Raymond Cattell]], a student of Charles Spearman's, rejected the unitary ''g'' factor model and divided ''g'' into two broad, relatively independent domains: fluid intelligence (G''f'') and crystallized intelligence (G''c''). G''f'' is conceptualized as a capacity to figure out novel problems, and it is best assessed with tests with little cultural or scholastic content, such as Raven's matrices. G''c'' can be thought of as consolidated knowledge, reflecting the skills and information that an individual acquires and retains throughout his or her life. G''c'' is dependent on education and other forms of acculturation, and it is best assessed with tests that emphasize scholastic and cultural knowledge.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/><ref name=\"d&k\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 122\u2013123</ref> G''f'' can be thought to primarily consist of ''current'' reasoning and problem solving capabilities, while G''c'' reflects the outcome of ''previously'' executed cognitive processes.<ref>Sternberg et al. 1981</ref>\n\nThe rationale for the separation of G''f'' and G''c'' was to explain individuals' cognitive development over time. While G''f'' and G''c'' have been found to be highly correlated, they differ in the way they change over a lifetime. G''f'' tends to peak at around age 20, slowly declining thereafter. In contrast, G''c'' is stable or increases across adulthood. A single general factor has been criticized as obscuring this bifurcated pattern of development. Cattell argued that G''f'' reflected individual differences in the efficiency of the [[central nervous system]]. G''c'' was, in Cattell's thinking, the result of a person \"investing\" his or her G''f'' in learning experiences throughout life.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/><ref name=\"horn&mcardle\">Horn & McArdle 2007</ref><ref name=\"d&k\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 123</ref>\n\nCattell, together with John Horn, later expanded the G''f''-G''c'' model to include a number of other broad abilities, such as G''q'' (quantitative reasoning) and G''v'' (visual-spatial reasoning). While all the broad ability factors in the extended G''f''-G''c'' model are positively correlated and thus would enable the extraction of a higher order ''g'' factor, Cattell and Horn maintained that it would be erroneous to posit that a general factor underlies these broad abilities. They argued that ''g'' factors computed from different test batteries are not invariant and would give different values of ''g'', and that the correlations among tests arise because it is difficult to test just one ability at a time.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/><ref name=\"McGrew 2005\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 124</ref>\n\nHowever, several researchers have suggested that the G''f''-G''c'' model is compatible with a ''g''-centered understanding of cognitive abilities. For example, [[John B. Carroll]]'s [[Three stratum theory|three-stratum model of intelligence]] includes both G''f'' and G''c'' together with a higher-order ''g'' factor. Based on factor analyses of many data sets, some researchers have also argued that G''f'' and ''g'' are one and the same factor and that ''g'' factors from different test batteries are substantially invariant provided that the batteries are large and diverse.<ref name=\"d&k\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 125</ref><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 152\u2013153</ref>\n\n===Theories of uncorrelated abilities===\n\nSeveral theorists have proposed that there are intellectual abilities that are uncorrelated with each other. Among the earliest was [[L.L. Thurstone]] who created a model of ''primary mental abilities'' representing supposedly independent domains of intelligence. However, Thurstone's tests of these abilities were found to produce a strong general factor. He argued that the lack of independence among his tests reflected the difficulty of constructing \"factorially pure\" tests that measured just one ability. Similarly, [[J.P. Guilford]] proposed a model of intelligence that comprised up to 180 distinct, uncorrelated abilities, and claimed to be able to test all of them. Later analyses have shown that the factorial procedures Guilford presented as evidence for his theory did not provide support for it, and that the test data that he claimed provided evidence against ''g'' did in fact exhibit the usual pattern of intercorrelations after correction for statistical artifacts.<ref>Jensen 1998, 77\u201378, 115\u2013117</ref><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 52, 239</ref>\n\nMore recently, [[Howard Gardner]] has developed the [[theory of multiple intelligences]]. He posits the existence of nine different and independent domains of intelligence, such as mathematical, linguistic, spatial, musical, bodily-kinesthetic, meta-cognitive, and existential intelligences, and contends that individuals who fail in some of them may excel in others. According to Gardner, tests and schools traditionally emphasize only linguistic and logical abilities while neglecting other forms of intelligence. While popular among educationalists, Gardner's theory has been much criticized by psychologists and psychometricians. One criticism is that the theory does violence to both scientific and everyday usages of the word \"intelligence.\" Several researchers have argued that not all of Gardner's intelligences fall within the cognitive sphere. For example, Gardner contends that a successful career in professional sports or popular music reflects bodily-kinesthetic ''intelligence'' and musical ''intelligence'', respectively, even though one might usually talk of athletic and musical ''skills'', ''talents'', or ''abilities'' instead. Another criticism of Gardner's theory is that many of his purportedly independent domains of intelligence are in fact correlated with each other. Responding to empirical analyses showing correlations between the domains, Gardner has argued that the correlations exist because of the [[Common-method variance|common format]] of tests and because all tests require linguistic and logical skills. His critics have in turn pointed out that not all IQ tests are administered in the paper-and-pencil format, that aside from linguistic and logical abilities, IQ test batteries contain also measures of, for example, spatial abilities, and that elementary cognitive tasks (for example, inspection time and reaction time) that do not involve linguistic or logical reasoning correlate with conventional IQ batteries, too.<ref name=\"brody2006\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 128\u2013132</ref><ref>Deary 2001, 15\u201316</ref><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 236\u2013237</ref>\n\n[[Robert Sternberg]], working with various colleagues, has also suggested that intelligence has dimensions independent of ''g''. He argues that there are three classes of intelligence: analytic, practical, and creative. According to Sternberg, traditional psychometric tests measure only analytic intelligence, and should be augmented to test creative and practical intelligence as well. He has devised several tests to this effect. Sternberg equates analytic intelligence with academic intelligence, and contrasts it with practical intelligence, defined as an ability to deal with ill-defined real-life problems. Tacit intelligence is an important component of practical intelligence, consisting of knowledge that is not explicitly taught but is required in many real-life situations. Assessing creativity independent of intelligence tests has traditionally proved difficult, but Sternberg and colleagues have claimed to have created valid tests of creativity, too. The validation of Sternberg's theory requires that the three abilities tested are substantially uncorrelated and have independent predictive validity. Sternberg has conducted many experiments which he claims confirm the validity of his theory, but several researchers have disputed this conclusion. For example, in his reanalysis of a validation study of Sternberg's STAT test, [[Nathan Brody]] showed that the predictive validity of the STAT, a test of three allegedly independent abilities, was almost solely due to a single general factor underlying the tests, which Brody equated with the ''g'' factor.<ref>Hunt 2011, 120\u2013130</ref><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 223\u2013235</ref>\n\n===Flynn's model===\n\n[[Jim Flynn (academic)|James Flynn]] has argued that intelligence should be conceptualized at three different levels: brain physiology, cognitive differences between individuals, and social trends in intelligence over time. According to this model, the ''g'' factor is a useful concept with respect to individual differences but its explanatory power is limited when the focus of investigation is either brain physiology, or, especially, the effect of social trends on intelligence. Flynn has criticized the notion that cognitive gains over time, or the Flynn effect, are \"hollow\" if they cannot be shown to be increases in ''g''. He argues that the Flynn effect reflects shifting social priorities and individuals' adaptation to them. To apply the individual differences concept of ''g'' to the Flynn effect is to confuse different levels of analysis. On the other hand, according to Flynn, it is also fallacious to deny, by referring to trends in intelligence over time, that some individuals have \"better brains and minds\" to cope with the cognitive demands of their particular time. At the level of brain physiology, Flynn has emphasized both that localized neural clusters can be affected differently by cognitive exercise, and that there are important factors that affect all neural clusters.<ref>Flynn 2011</ref>\n\n===Other criticisms===\n\nPerhaps the most famous critique of the construct of ''g'' is that of the paleontologist and biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]], presented in his 1981 book ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]''. He argued that psychometricians have fallaciously [[Reification (fallacy)|reified]] the ''g'' factor as a physical thing in the brain, even though it is simply the product of statistical calculations (i.e., factor analysis). He further noted that it is possible to produce factor solutions of cognitive test data that do not contain a ''g'' factor yet explain the same amount of information as solutions that yield a ''g''. According to Gould, there is no rationale for preferring one factor solution to another, and factor analysis therefore does not lend support to the existence of an entity like ''g''. More generally, Gould criticized the ''g'' theory for abstracting intelligence as a single entity and for ranking people \"in a single series of worthiness\", arguing that such rankings are used to justify the oppression of disadvantaged groups.<ref name=\"carroll1995\"/><ref>Gould 1996, 56\u201357</ref>\n\nMany researchers have criticized Gould's arguments. For example, they have rejected the accusation of reification, maintaining that the use of extracted factors such as ''g'' as potential causal variables whose reality can be supported or rejected by further investigations constitutes a normal scientific practice that in no way distinguishes psychometrics from other sciences. Critics have also suggested that Gould did not understand the purpose of factor analysis, and that he was ignorant of relevant methodological advances in the field. While different factor solutions may be mathematically equivalent in their ability to account for intercorrelations among tests, solutions that yield a ''g'' factor are psychologically preferable for several reasons extrinsic to factor analysis, including the phenomenon of the positive manifold, the fact that the same ''g'' can emerge from quite different test batteries, the widespread practical validity of ''g'', and the linkage of ''g'' to many biological variables.<ref name=\"carroll1995\"/><ref name=\"jensen1982\"/><ref>Korb 1994</ref>\n\nJohn Horn and John McArdle have argued that the modern ''g'' theory, as espoused by, for example, Arthur Jensen, is [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]], because the existence of a common factor like ''g'' follows [[Tautology (logic)|tautologically]] from positive correlations among tests. They contrasted the modern hierarchical theory of ''g'' with Spearman's original two-factor theory which was readily falsifiable (and indeed was falsified).<ref name=\"horn&mcardle\"/>\n\nOne critic has argued that ''g'' \"...is to the psychometricians what [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]]' [[aether theories|ether]] was to early physicists: a nonentity taken as an article of faith instead of one in need of verification by real data.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Graves |first=Joseph L. |authorlink=Joseph L.

It is a variable that summarizes positive [[correlation]]s among different cognitive tasks, reflecting the fact that an individual's performance on one type of cognitive task tends to be comparable to that person's performance on other kinds of cognitive tasks. The ''g'' factor typically accounts for 40 to 50 percent of the between-individual performance differences on a given [[cognitive test]], and composite scores (\"IQ scores\") based on many tests are frequently regarded as estimates of individuals' standing on the ''g'' factor.<ref name=\"kamphaus2005\">Kamphaus et al. 2005</ref> The terms ''IQ, general intelligence, general cognitive ability, general mental ability'', and simply ''intelligence'' are often used interchangeably to refer to this common core shared by cognitive tests.<ref name=\"deary2010\">Deary et al. 2010</ref> The ''g'' factor targets a particular measure of  ''general intelligence''.\n\nFor broader coverage of IQ metrics, see [[Intelligence quotient]].\n\nThe existence of the ''g'' factor was originally proposed by the English psychologist [[Charles Spearman]] in the early years of the 20th century. He observed that children's performance ratings, across seemingly unrelated school subjects, were positively [[correlated]], and reasoned that these correlations reflected the influence of an underlying general mental ability that entered into performance on all kinds of mental tests. Spearman suggested that all mental performance could be conceptualized in terms of a single general ability factor, which he labeled ''g'', and many narrow task-specific ability factors. Soon after Spearman proposed the existence of ''g'', it was challenged by [[Godfrey Thomson]], who presented evidence that such intercorrelations among test results could arise even if no ''g''-factor existed.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=THOMSON |first=GODFREY H. |date=September 1916|journal=British Journal of Psychology |language=en |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=271\u2013281 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1916.tb00133.x |issn=0950-5652|title=A Hierarchy Without a General Factor1 |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1447717 }}</ref> Today's factor models of intelligence typically represent cognitive abilities as a three-level hierarchy, where there are many narrow [[Factor analysis|factors]] at the bottom of the hierarchy, a handful of broad, more general factors at the intermediate level, and at the apex a single factor, referred to as the ''g'' factor, which represents the variance common to all cognitive tasks.\n\nTraditionally, research on ''g'' has concentrated on psychometric investigations of test data, with a special emphasis on [[factor analysis|factor analytic]] approaches. However, empirical research on the nature of ''g'' has also drawn upon experimental [[cognitive psychology]] and [[mental chronometry]], brain anatomy and physiology, [[quantitative genetics|quantitative]] and [[molecular genetics]], and [[Evolution of human intelligence|primate evolution]].<ref>Jensen 1998, 545</ref> Some scientists consider ''g'' as a statistical regularity and uncontroversial, and a general cognitive factor appears in data collected from people in nearly every human culture.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Warne|first=Russell T.|last2=Burningham|first2=Cassidy|date=2019|title=Spearman's g found in 31 non-Western nations: Strong evidence that g is a universal phenomenon|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=145|issue=3|pages=237\u2013272|doi=10.1037/bul0000184|pmid=30640496|url=http://psyarxiv.com/uv673/}}</ref> Yet, there is no consensus as to what causes the positive correlations between tests.\n\nResearch in the field of [[behavioral genetics]] has established that the construct of ''g'' is highly [[Heritability of IQ|heritable]]. It has a number of other biological correlates, including [[brain size]]. It is also a significant predictor of individual differences in many social outcomes, particularly in education and employment. The most widely accepted contemporary theories of intelligence incorporate the ''g'' factor.<ref>Neisser et al. 1996</ref> However, critics of ''g'' have contended that an emphasis on ''g'' is misplaced and entails a devaluation of other important abilities. [[Stephen Jay Gould|Stephen J.

Specific domains assessed by tests include mathematical skill, verbal fluency, spatial visualization, and memory, among others. However, individuals who excel at one type of test tend to excel at other kinds of tests, too, while those who do poorly on one test tend to do so on all tests, regardless of the tests' contents.<ref>Gottfredson 1998</ref> The English psychologist Charles Spearman was the first to describe this phenomenon.<ref>Deary 2001, 12</ref> In a famous research paper published in 1904,<ref>Spearman 1904</ref> he observed that children's performance measures across seemingly unrelated school subjects were positively correlated. This finding has since been replicated numerous times. The consistent finding of universally positive [[correlation matrix|correlation matrices]] of mental test results (or the \"positive manifold\"), despite large differences in tests' contents, has been described as \"arguably the most replicated result in all psychology\".<ref>Deary 2000, 6</ref> Zero or negative correlations between tests suggest the presence of [[sampling error]] or restriction of the range of ability in the sample studied.<ref name=\"jensen1992\">Jensen 1992</ref>\n\nUsing [[factor analysis]] or related statistical methods, it is possible to compute a single common factor that can be regarded as a summary variable characterizing the correlations between all the different tests in a test battery. Spearman referred to this common factor as the ''general factor'', or simply ''g''. (By convention, ''g'' is always printed as a lower case italic.) Mathematically, the ''g'' factor is ''a source of variance among individuals'', which entails that one cannot meaningfully speak of any one individual's mental abilities consisting of ''g'' or other factors to any specified degrees. One can only speak of an individual's standing on ''g'' (or other factors) compared to other individuals in a relevant population.<ref name=\"jensen1992\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 28</ref><ref name=\"maas\">van deer Maas et al. 2006</ref>\n\nDifferent tests in a test battery may correlate with (or \"load onto\") the ''g'' factor of the battery to different degrees. These correlations are known as ''g'' loadings. An individual test taker's ''g'' factor score, representing his or her relative standing on the ''g'' factor in the total group of individuals, can be estimated using the ''g'' loadings. Full-scale IQ scores from a test battery will usually be highly correlated with ''g'' factor scores, and they are often regarded as estimates of ''g''. For example, the correlations between ''g'' factor scores and full-scale IQ scores from [[David Wechsler]]'s tests have been found to be greater than .95.<ref name=\"kamphaus2005\"/><ref name=\"jensen1992\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 26, 36\u201339</ref> The terms IQ, general intelligence, general cognitive ability, general mental ability, or simply intelligence are frequently used interchangeably to refer to the common core shared by cognitive tests.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/>\n\nThe ''g'' loadings of mental tests are always positive and usually range between .10 and .90, with a mean of about .60 and a standard deviation of about .15. [[Raven's Progressive Matrices]] is among the tests with the highest ''g'' loadings, around .80. Tests of vocabulary and general information are also typically found to have high ''g'' loadings.<ref>Jensen 1998, 26, 36\u201339, 89\u201390</ref><ref name=\"Jensen 2002\">Jensen 2002</ref> However, the ''g'' loading of the same test may vary somewhat depending on the composition of the test battery.<ref name=\"floyd2009\">Floyd et al. 2009</ref>\n\nThe complexity of tests and the demands they place on mental manipulation are related to the tests' ''g'' loadings. For example, in the forward digit span test the subject is asked to repeat a sequence of digits in the order of their presentation after hearing them once at a rate of one digit per second. The backward digit span test is otherwise the same except that the subject is asked to repeat the digits in the reverse order to that in which they were presented. The backward digit span test is more complex than the forward digit span test, and it has a significantly higher ''g'' loading. Similarly, the ''g'' loadings of arithmetic computation, spelling, and word reading tests are lower than those of arithmetic problem solving, text composition, and reading comprehension tests, respectively.<ref name=\"jensen1992\"/><ref name=\"Jensen 1980, 213\">Jensen 1980, 213</ref>\n\nTest difficulty and ''g'' loadings are distinct concepts that may or may not be empirically related in any specific situation. Tests that have the same difficulty level, as indexed by the proportion of test items that are failed by test takers, may exhibit a wide range of ''g'' loadings. For example, tests of [[rote memory]] have been shown to have the same level of difficulty but considerably lower ''g'' loadings than many tests that involve reasoning.<ref name=\"Jensen 1980, 213\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 94</ref>\n\n==Theories==\n\nWhile the existence of ''g'' as a statistical regularity is well-established and uncontroversial among experts, there is no consensus as to what causes the positive intercorrelations. Several explanations have been proposed.<ref name=\"Hunt 2011, 94\">Hunt 2011, 94</ref>\n\n===Mental energy or efficiency===\n\nCharles Spearman reasoned that correlations between tests reflected the influence of a common causal factor, a general mental ability that enters into performance on all kinds of mental tasks. However, he thought that the best indicators of ''g'' were those tests that reflected what he called ''the eduction of relations and correlates'', which included abilities such as [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], problem solving, grasping relationships, inferring rules, and spotting differences and similarities. Spearman hypothesized that ''g'' was equivalent with \"mental energy\". However, this was more of a metaphorical explanation, and he remained agnostic about the physical basis of this energy, expecting that future research would uncover the exact physiological nature of ''g''.<ref>Jensen 1998, 18\u201319, 35\u201336, 38. The idea of a general, unitary mental ability was introduced to psychology by [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Francis Galton]] in the latter half of the 19th century, but their work was largely speculative, with little empirical basis.</ref>\n\nFollowing Spearman, [[Arthur Jensen]] maintained that all mental tasks tap into ''g'' to some degree. According to Jensen, the ''g'' factor represents a \"distillate\" of scores on different tests rather than a summation or an average of such scores, with factor analysis acting as the [[distillation]] procedure.<ref name=\"Jensen 2002\"/> He argued that ''g'' cannot be described in terms of the item characteristics or information content of tests, pointing out that very dissimilar mental tasks may have nearly equal ''g'' loadings.  Wechsler similarly contended that ''g'' is not an ability at all but rather some general property of the brain. Jensen hypothesized that ''g'' corresponds to individual differences in the speed or efficiency of the neural processes associated with mental abilities.<ref>Jensen 1998, 91\u201392, 95</ref> He also suggested that given the associations between ''g'' and [[#Elementary cognitive tasks|elementary cognitive tasks]], it should be possible to construct a [[ratio scale]] test of ''g'' that uses [[time]] as the unit of measurement.<ref>Jensen 2000</ref>\n\n===Sampling theory===\n\nThe so-called sampling theory of ''g'', originally developed by [[E.L. Thorndike]] and [[Godfrey Thomson]], proposes that the existence of the positive manifold can be explained without reference to a unitary underlying capacity. According to this theory, there are a number of uncorrelated mental processes, and all tests draw upon different samples of these processes. The intercorrelations between tests are caused by an overlap between processes tapped by the tests.<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 157</ref><ref>Jensen 1998, 117</ref> Thus, the positive manifold arises due to a measurement problem, an inability to measure more fine-grained, presumably uncorrelated mental processes.<ref name=\"maas\"/>\n\nIt has been shown that it is not possible to distinguish statistically between Spearman's model of ''g'' and the sampling model; both are equally able to account for intercorrelations among tests.<ref>Bartholomew et al. 2009</ref> The sampling theory is also consistent with the observation that more complex mental tasks have higher ''g'' loadings, because more complex tasks are expected to involve a larger sampling of neural elements and therefore have more of them in common with other tasks.<ref>Jensen 1998, 120</ref>\n\nSome researchers have argued that the sampling model invalidates ''g'' as a psychological concept, because the model suggests that ''g'' factors derived from different test batteries simply reflect the shared elements of the particular tests contained in each battery rather than a ''g'' that is common to all tests. Similarly, high correlations between different batteries could be due to them measuring the same set of abilities rather than ''the'' same ability.<ref name=\"horn&mcardle\"/>\n\nCritics have argued that the sampling theory is incongruent with certain empirical findings. Based on the sampling theory, one might expect that related cognitive tests share many elements and thus be highly correlated. However, some closely related tests, such as forward and backward digit span, are only modestly correlated, while some seemingly completely dissimilar tests, such as vocabulary tests and Raven's matrices, are consistently highly correlated. Another problematic finding is that brain damage frequently leads to specific cognitive impairments rather than a general impairment one might expect based on the sampling theory.<ref name=\"maas\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 120\u2013121</ref>\n\n===Mutualism===\n\nThe \"mutualism\" model of ''g'' proposes that cognitive processes are initially uncorrelated, but that the positive manifold arises during individual development due to mutual beneficial relations between cognitive processes. Thus there is no single process or capacity underlying the positive correlations between tests. During the course of development, the theory holds, any one particularly efficient process will benefit other processes, with the result that the processes will end up being correlated with one another. Thus similarly high IQs in different persons may stem from quite different initial advantages that they had.<ref name=\"maas\"/><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 157\u2013158</ref> Critics have argued that the observed correlations between the ''g'' loadings and the heritability coefficients of subtests are problematic for the mutualism theory.<ref name=RJ2010/>\n\n===Social exchange and sexual selection===\n{{multiple image\n |align    = right\n |width    = 175\n |direction= vertical\n |image1   = Wason selection task cards.svg\n |caption1 = Each card has a number on one side, and a patch of color on the other.

The blue areas correspond to test-specific variance (''s''), while the purple areas represent the variance attributed to ''g''.]]\n\n[[Factor analysis]] is a family of mathematical techniques that can be used to represent correlations between intelligence tests in terms of a smaller number of variables known as factors. The purpose is to simplify the correlation matrix by using hypothetical underlying factors to explain the patterns in it. When all correlations in a matrix are positive, as they are in the case of IQ, factor analysis will yield a general factor common to all tests. The general factor of IQ tests is referred to as the ''g'' factor, and it typically accounts for 40 to 50 percent of the variance in IQ test batteries.<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 44\u201345</ref> The presence of correlations between many widely varying cognitive tests has often been taken as evidence for the existence of ''g'', but McFarland (2012) showed that such correlations do not provide any more or less support for the existence of ''g'' than for the existence of multiple factors of intelligence.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=McFarland |first=Dennis J. |date=2012 |title=A single g factor is not necessary to simulate positive correlations between cognitive tests |journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=378\u2013384 |doi=10.1080/13803395.2011.645018 |issn=1744-411X |pmid=22260190|quote=The fact that diverse cognitive tests tend to be positively correlated has been taken as evidence for a single general ability or \"g\" factor...the presence of a positive manifold in the correlations between diverse cognitive tests does not provide differential support for either single factor or multiple factor models of general abilities.|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b85fe663593c1272f614005da0868967077a754f }}</ref>\n\nCharles Spearman developed factor analysis in order to study correlations between tests. Initially, he developed a model of intelligence in which variations in all intelligence test scores are explained by only two kinds of variables: first, factors that are specific to each test (denoted ''s''); and second, a ''g'' factor that accounts for the positive correlations across tests. This is known as Spearman's two-factor theory. Later research based on more diverse test batteries than those used by Spearman demonstrated that ''g'' alone could not account for all correlations between tests. Specifically, it was found that even after controlling for ''g'', some tests were still correlated with each other. This led to the postulation of ''group factors'' that represent variance that groups of tests with similar task demands (e.g., verbal, spatial, or numerical) have in common in addition to the shared ''g'' variance.<ref>Jensen 1998, 18, 31\u201332</ref>\n\n[[Image:Carroll three stratum model of human Intelligence.png|right|thumb|500px|An illustration of [[John B. Carroll]]'s [[three stratum theory]], an influential contemporary model of cognitive abilities. The broad abilities recognized by the model are fluid intelligence (Gf), crystallized intelligence (Gc), general memory and learning (Gy), broad visual perception (Gv), broad auditory perception (Gu), broad retrieval ability (Gr), broad cognitive speediness (Gs), and processing speed (Gt). Carroll regarded the broad abilities as different \"flavors\" of ''g''.]]\n\nThrough [[Factor analysis#Rotation methods|factor rotation]], it is, in principle, possible to produce an infinite number of different factor solutions that are mathematically equivalent in their ability to account for the intercorrelations among cognitive tests. These include solutions that do not contain a ''g'' factor. Thus factor analysis alone cannot establish what the underlying structure of intelligence is. In choosing between different factor solutions, researchers have to examine the results of factor analysis together with other information about the structure of cognitive abilities.<ref name=\"carroll1995\">Carroll 1995</ref>\n\nThere are many psychologically relevant reasons for preferring factor solutions that contain a ''g'' factor. These include the existence of the positive manifold, the fact that certain kinds of tests (generally the more complex ones) have consistently larger ''g'' loadings, the substantial invariance of ''g'' factors across different test batteries, the impossibility of constructing test batteries that do not yield a ''g'' factor, and the widespread practical validity of ''g'' as a predictor of individual outcomes. The ''g'' factor, together with group factors, best represents the empirically established fact that, on average, overall ability differences ''between'' individuals are greater than differences among abilities ''within'' individuals, while a factor solution with orthogonal factors without ''g'' obscures this fact. Moreover, ''g'' appears to be the most heritable component of intelligence.<ref name=\"jensen1982\">Jensen 1982</ref> Research utilizing the techniques of [[confirmatory factor analysis]] has also provided support for the existence of ''g''.<ref name=\"carroll1995\"/>\n\nA ''g'' factor can be computed from a correlation matrix of test results using several different methods. These include exploratory factor analysis, [[principal components analysis]] (PCA), and confirmatory factor analysis. Different factor-extraction methods produce highly consistent results, although PCA has sometimes been found to produce inflated estimates of the influence of ''g'' on test scores.<ref name=\"floyd2009\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 73</ref>\n\nThere is a broad contemporary consensus that cognitive variance between people can be conceptualized at three hierarchical levels, distinguished by their degree of generality. At the lowest, least general level there are many narrow first-order factors; at a higher level, there are a relatively small number \u2013 somewhere between five and ten \u2013 of broad (i.e., more general) second-order factors (or group factors); and at the apex, there is a single third-order factor, ''g'', the general factor common to all tests.<ref name=\"deary2012\">Deary 2012</ref><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 57</ref><ref>Jensen 1998, 46</ref> The ''g'' factor usually accounts for the majority of the total common factor variance of IQ test batteries.<ref>Carroll 1997. The total common factor variance consists of the variance due to the ''g'' factor and the group factors considered together. The variance not accounted for by the common factors, referred to as ''uniqueness'', comprises subtest-specific variance and measurement error.</ref> Contemporary hierarchical models of intelligence include the [[three stratum theory]] and the [[Cattell\u2013Horn\u2013Carroll theory]].<ref name=\"d&k\">Davidson & Kemp 2011</ref>\n\n==\"Indifference of the indicator\"==\n\nSpearman proposed the principle of the ''indifference of the indicator'', according to which the precise content of intelligence tests is unimportant for the purposes of identifying ''g'', because ''g'' enters into performance on all kinds of tests. Any test can therefore be used as an indicator of ''g''.<ref name=\":2\" /> Following Spearman, Arthur Jensen more recently argued that a ''g'' factor extracted from one test battery will always be the same, within the limits of measurement error, as that extracted from another battery, provided that the batteries are large and diverse.<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 151</ref> According to this view, every mental test, no matter how distinctive, calls on ''g'' to some extent. Thus a composite score of a number of different tests will load onto ''g'' more strongly than any of the individual test scores, because the ''g'' components cumulate into the composite score, while the uncorrelated non-''g'' components will cancel each other out. Theoretically, the composite score of an infinitely large, diverse test battery would, then, be a perfect measure of ''g''.<ref>Jensen 1998, 31</ref>\n\nIn contrast, [[L.L. Thurstone]] argued that a ''g'' factor extracted from a test battery reflects the average of all the abilities called for by the particular battery, and that ''g'' therefore varies from one battery to another and \"has no fundamental psychological significance.\"<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 151\u2013153</ref> Along similar lines, [[John L. Horn|John Horn]] argued that ''g'' factors are meaningless because they are not invariant across test batteries, maintaining that correlations between different ability measures arise because it is difficult to define a human action that depends on just one ability.<ref name=\"McGrew 2005\">McGrew 2005</ref><ref>Kvist & Gustafsson 2008</ref>\n\nTo show that different batteries reflect the same ''g'', one must administer several test batteries to the same individuals, extract ''g'' factors from each battery, and show that the factors are highly correlated. This can be done within a confirmatory factor analysis framework.<ref name=\"Hunt 2011, 94\"/> Wendy Johnson and colleagues have published two such studies.<ref>Johnson et al. 2004</ref><ref>Johnson et al. 2008</ref> The first found that the correlations between ''g'' factors extracted from three different batteries were .99, .99, and 1.00, supporting the hypothesis that ''g'' factors from different batteries are the same and that the identification of ''g'' is not dependent on the specific abilities assessed. The second study found that ''g'' factors derived from four of five test batteries correlated at between .95\u20131.00, while the correlations ranged from .79 to .96 for the fifth battery, the [[Culture Fair Intelligence Test|Cattell Culture Fair Intelligence Test]] (the CFIT). They attributed the somewhat lower correlations with the CFIT battery to its lack of content diversity for it contains only matrix-type items, and interpreted the findings as supporting the contention that ''g'' factors derived from different test batteries are the same provided that the batteries are diverse enough. The results suggest that the same ''g'' can be consistently identified from different test batteries.<ref name=\"deary2012\"/><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 150\u2013153. See also Keith et al. 2001 where the ''g'' factors from the [[Cognitive Assessment System|CAS]] and [[Woodcock\u2013Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities|WJ III]] test batteries were found to be statistically indistinguishable, and Stauffer et al. 1996 where similar results were found for the [[Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery|ASVAB]] battery and a battery of cognitive-components-based tests.</ref>\n\n==Population distribution==\n\nThe form of the population distribution of ''g'' is unknown, because ''g'' cannot be measured on a [[ratio scale]]{{clarify|date=March 2018}}. (The distributions of scores on typical IQ tests are roughly normal, but this is achieved by construction, i.e., by [[Normalization (statistics)|normalizing]] the raw scores.) It has been argued{{who|date=May 2017}} that there are nevertheless good reasons for supposing that ''g'' is [[Normal distribution|normally distributed]] in the general population, at least within a range of \u00b12 standard deviations from the mean. In particular, ''g'' can be thought of as a composite variable that reflects the additive effects of many independent genetic and environmental influences, and such a variable should, according to the [[central limit theorem]], follow a normal distribution.<ref>Jensen 1998, 88, 101\u2013103</ref>\n\n==Spearman's law of diminishing returns==\nA number of researchers have suggested that the proportion of variation accounted for by ''g'' may not be uniform across all subgroups within a population. ''Spearman's law of diminishing returns'' (SLODR), also termed the ''cognitive ability differentiation hypothesis'', predicts that the positive correlations among different cognitive abilities are weaker among more intelligent subgroups of individuals.  More specifically, (SLODR) predicts that the ''g'' factor will account for a smaller proportion of individual differences in cognitive tests scores at higher scores on the ''g'' factor.\n\n(SLODR) was originally proposed by [[Charles Spearman]],<ref>Spearman, C. (1927). ''The abilities of man''. New York: MacMillan.</ref> who reported that the average correlation between 12 cognitive ability tests was .466 in 78 normal children, and .782 in 22 \"defective\" children.  Detterman and Daniel rediscovered this phenomenon in 1989.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Detterman | first1 = D.K. | last2 = Daniel | first2 = M.H. | year = 1989 | title = Correlations of mental tests with each other and with cognitive variables are highest for low IQ groups | url = | journal = Intelligence | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 349\u2013359 | doi = 10.1016/s0160-2896(89)80007-8 }}</ref> They reported that for subtests of both the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|WAIS]] and the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC]], subtest intercorrelations decreased monotonically with ability group, ranging from approximately an average intercorrelation of .7 among individuals with IQs less than 78 to .4 among individuals with IQs greater than 122.<ref>Deary & Pagliari 1991</ref>\n\n(SLODR) has been replicated in a variety of child and adult samples who have been measured using broad arrays of cognitive tests.  The most common approach has been to divide individuals into multiple ability groups using an observable proxy for their general intellectual ability, and then to either compare the average interrelation among the subtests across the different groups, or to compare the proportion of variation accounted for by a single common factor, in the different groups.<ref name=\"deary et al\">Deary et al. 1996</ref> However, as both Deary et al. (1996).<ref name=\"deary et al\"/> and Tucker-Drob (2009)<ref name=\"Tucker-Drob, E. M. 2009\">Tucker-Drob 2009</ref> have pointed out, dividing the continuous distribution of intelligence into an arbitrary number of discrete ability groups is less than ideal for examining (SLODR).  Tucker-Drob (2009)<ref name=\"Tucker-Drob, E. M. 2009\"/> extensively reviewed the literature on (SLODR) and the various methods by which it had been previously tested, and proposed that (SLODR) could be most appropriately captured by fitting a common factor model that allows the relations between the factor and its indicators to be nonlinear in nature.  He applied such a factor model to a nationally representative data of children and adults in the United States and found consistent evidence for (SLODR). For example, Tucker-Drob (2009) found that a general factor accounted for approximately 75% of the variation in seven different cognitive abilities among very low IQ adults, but only accounted for approximately 30% of the variation in the abilities among very high IQ adults.\n\nA recent meta-analytic study by Blum and Holling<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Blum | first1 = D. | last2 = Holling | first2 = H. | year = 2017 | title = Spearman's Law of Diminishing Returns. A meta-analysis | url = | journal = Intelligence | volume = 65 | issue = | pages = 60\u201366 | doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2017.07.004 }}</ref> also provided support for the differentiation hypothesis. As opposed to most research on the topic, this work made it possible to study ability and age variables as continuous predictors of the ''g'' saturation, and not just to compare lower- vs. higher-skilled or younger vs. older groups of testees. Results demonstrate that the mean correlation and ''g'' loadings of cognitive ability tests decrease with increasing ability, yet increase with respondent age. (SLODR), as described by [[Charles Spearman]], could be confirmed by a ''g''-saturation decrease as a function of IQ as well as a ''g''-saturation increase from middle age to senescence. Specifically speaking, for samples with a mean intelligence that is two standard deviations (i.e., 30 IQ-points) higher, the mean correlation to be expected is decreased by approximately .15 points. The question remains whether a difference of this magnitude could result in a greater apparent factorial complexity when cognitive data are factored for the higher-ability sample, as opposed to the lower-ability sample. It seems likely that greater factor dimensionality should tend to be observed for the case of higher ability, but the magnitude of this effect (i.e., how much more likely and how many more factors) remains uncertain.\n\n==Practical validity==\n\nThe practical validity of ''g'' as a predictor of educational, economic, and social outcomes is more far-ranging and universal than that of any other known psychological variable. The validity of ''g'' increases as the complexity of the measured task increases.<ref name=\"Jensen 1998, 270\">Jensen 1998, 270</ref><ref>Gottfredson 2002</ref>\n\nA test's practical validity is measured by its correlation with performance on some criterion external to the test, such as college grade-point average, or a rating of job performance. The correlation between test scores and a measure of some criterion is called the ''validity coefficient''. One way to interpret a validity coefficient is to square it to obtain the [[Coefficient of determination|variance accounted]] by the test. For example, a validity coefficient of .30 corresponds to 9 percent of variance explained. This approach has, however, been criticized as misleading and uninformative, and several alternatives have been proposed. One arguably more interpretable approach is to look at the percentage of test takers in each test score [[wikt:quintile|quintile]] who meet some agreed-upon standard of success. For example, if the correlation between test scores and performance is .30, the expectation is that 67 percent of those in the top quintile will be above-average performers, compared to 33 percent of those in the bottom quintile.<ref name=\"sackett2008\">Sackett et al. 2008</ref><ref>Jensen 1998, 272, 301</ref>\n\n===Academic achievement===\n\nThe predictive validity of ''g'' is most conspicuous in the domain of scholastic performance. This is apparently because ''g'' is closely linked to the ability to learn novel material and understand concepts and meanings.<ref name=\"Jensen 1998, 270\"/>\n\nIn elementary school, the correlation between IQ and grades and achievement scores is between .60 and .70. At more advanced educational levels, more students from the lower end of the IQ distribution drop out, which restricts the range of IQs and results in lower validity coefficients. In high school, college, and graduate school the validity coefficients are .50\u2013.60, .40\u2013.50, and .30\u2013.40, respectively. The ''g'' loadings of IQ scores are high, but it is possible that some of the validity of IQ in predicting scholastic achievement is attributable to factors measured by IQ independent of ''g''. According to research by [[Robert L. Thorndike]], 80 to 90 percent of the ''predictable'' variance in scholastic performance is due to ''g'', with the rest attributed to non-''g'' factors measured by IQ and other tests.<ref>Jensen 1998, 279\u2013280</ref>\n\nAchievement test scores are more highly correlated with IQ than school grades. This may be because grades are more influenced by the teacher's idiosyncratic perceptions of the student.<ref>Jensen 1998, 279</ref> In a longitudinal English study, ''g'' scores measured at age 11 correlated with all the 25 subject tests of the national [[GCSE]] examination taken at age 16. The correlations ranged from .77 for the mathematics test to .42 for the art test. The correlation between ''g'' and a general educational factor computed from the GCSE tests was .81.<ref name=\"brody2006\">Brody 2006</ref>\n\nResearch suggests that the [[SAT]], widely used in college admissions, is primarily a measure of ''g''. A correlation of .82 has been found between ''g'' scores computed from an IQ test battery and SAT scores. In a study of 165,000 students at 41 U.S. colleges, SAT scores were found to be correlated at .47 with first-year college grade-point average after correcting for range restriction in SAT scores (the correlation rises to .55 when course difficulty is held constant, i.e., if all students attended the same set of classes).<ref name=\"sackett2008\"/><ref>Frey & Detterman 2004</ref>\n\n===Job attainment===\n\nThere is a high correlation of .90 to .95 between the prestige rankings of occupations, as rated by the general population, and the ''average'' general intelligence scores of people employed in each occupation. At the level of individual employees, the association between job prestige and ''g'' is lower \u2013 one large U.S. study reported a correlation of .65 (.72 [[Correction for attenuation|corrected for attenuation]]). Mean level of ''g'' thus increases with perceived job prestige. It has also been found that the [[Statistical dispersion|dispersion]] of general intelligence scores is smaller in more prestigious occupations than in lower level occupations, suggesting that higher level occupations have minimum ''g'' requirements.<ref name=\"s&h\">Schmidt & Hunter 2004</ref><ref>Jensen 1998, 292\u2013293</ref>\n\n=== Job performance ===\nResearch indicates that tests of ''g'' are the best single predictors of job performance, with an average validity coefficient of .55 across several meta-analyses of studies based on supervisor ratings and job samples. The average meta-analytic validity coefficient for performance in job ''training'' is .63.<ref>Schmidt & Hunter 2004. These validity coefficients have been corrected for measurement error in the dependent variable (i.e., job or training performance) and for range restriction but not for measurement error in the independent variable (i.e., measures of ''g'').</ref> The validity of ''g'' in the highest complexity jobs (professional, scientific, and upper management jobs) has been found to be greater than in the lowest complexity jobs, but ''g'' has predictive validity even for the simplest jobs. Research also shows that specific aptitude tests tailored for each job provide little or no increase in predictive validity over tests of general intelligence. It is believed that ''g'' affects job performance mainly by facilitating the acquisition of job-related knowledge. The predictive validity of ''g'' is greater than that of work experience, and increased experience on the job does not decrease the validity of ''g''.<ref name=\"Jensen 1998, 270\"/><ref name=\"s&h\"/>\n\nIn a 2011 meta-analysis, researchers found that general cognitive ability (GCA) predicted job performance better than personality ([[Five factor model]]) and three streams of [[emotional intelligence]]. They examined the relative importance of these constructs on predicting job performance and found that cognitive ability explained most of the variance in job performance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=O'Boyle Jr.|first=E.

For instance, an employee with low GCA will compensate his/her task performance and OCB, if [[emotional intelligence]] is high.\n\nAlthough these compensatory effects favour [[emotional intelligence]], GCA still remains as the best predictor of job performance. Several researchers have studied the correlation between GCA and job performance among different job positions. For instance, Ghiselli (1973)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ghiselli|first=E.

Although the former is better than subjective ratings, most of studies in job performance and GCA have been based on supervisor performance ratings. This rating criteria is considered problematic and unreliable, mainly because of its difficulty to define what is a good and bad performance. Rating of supervisors tends to be subjective and inconsistent among employees.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gottfredson|first=L.

These findings were surprising, considering that the main criteria for assessing these employees would be the objective sales.\n\nIn understanding how GCA is associated job performance, several researchers concluded that GCA affects acquisition of job knowledge, which in turn improves [[job performance]]. In other words, people high in GCA are capable to learn faster and acquire more job knowledge easily, which allow them to perform better. Conversely, lack of ability to acquire job knowledge will directly affect job performance. This is due to low levels of GCA. Also, GCA has a direct effect on job performance. In a daily basis, employees are exposed constantly to challenges and problem solving tasks, which success depends solely on their GCA. These findings are discouraging for governmental entities in charge of protecting rights of workers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Frank L.|date=1 April 2002|title=The Role of General Cognitive Ability and Job Performance: Why There Cannot Be a Debate|journal=Human Performance|volume=15|issue=1\u20132|pages=187\u2013210|doi=10.1080/08959285.2002.9668091|issn=0895-9285}}</ref> Because of the high correlation of GCA on job performance, companies are hiring employees based on GCA tests scores.

Some researchers have warned the existence of [[Artifact (error)|statistical artifacts]] related to measures of job performance and GCA test scores.

Moreover, studies on GCA and job performance are always susceptible to range restriction, because data is gathered mostly from current employees, neglecting those that were not hired.

The correlation is higher at higher levels of education and it increases with age, stabilizing when people reach their highest career potential in middle age. Even when education, occupation and socioeconomic background are held constant, the correlation does not vanish.<ref>Jensen 1998, 568</ref>\n\n===Other correlates===\n\nThe ''g'' factor is reflected in many social outcomes. Many social behavior problems, such as dropping out of school, chronic welfare dependency, accident proneness, and crime, are negatively correlated with ''g'' independent of social class of origin.<ref>Jensen 1998, 271</ref> Health and mortality outcomes are also linked to ''g'', with higher childhood test scores predicting better health and mortality outcomes in adulthood (see [[Cognitive epidemiology]]).<ref>Gottfredson 2007</ref>\n\n==Genetic and environmental determinants==\n{{Main|Heritability of IQ}}\n\nHeritability is the proportion of phenotypic variance in a trait in a population that can be attributed to genetic factors. The heritability of ''g'' has been estimated to fall between 40 and 80 percent using twin, adoption, and other family study designs as well as molecular genetic methods. Estimates based on the totality of evidence place the heritability of ''g'' at about 50%.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Plomin |first=Robert |last2=Spinath |first2=Frank M. |date=April 2002 |title=Genetics and general cognitive ability (g) |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=169\u2013176 |doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(00)01853-2 |pmid=11912040 |issn=1364-6613}}</ref> It has been found to increase linearly with age. For example, a large study involving more than 11,000 pairs of twins from four countries reported the heritability of ''g'' to be 41 percent at age nine, 55 percent at age twelve, and 66 percent at age seventeen. Other studies have estimated that the heritability is as high as 80 percent in adulthood, although it may decline in old age. Most of the research on the heritability of ''g'' has been conducted in the United States and [[Western Europe]], but studies in Russia ([[Moscow]]), the former [[East Germany]], Japan, and rural India have yielded similar estimates of heritability as Western studies.<ref name=\"deary2012\"/><ref>Deary et al. 2006</ref><ref name=\"plomin&spinath\">Plomin & Spinath 2004</ref><ref>Haworth et al. 2010</ref>\n\nBehavioral genetic research has also established that the shared (or between-family) environmental effects on ''g'' are strong in childhood, but decline thereafter and are negligible in adulthood. This indicates that the environmental effects that are important to the development of ''g'' are unique and not shared between members of the same family.<ref name=\"plomin&spinath\"/>\n\nThe [[genetic correlation]] is a statistic that indicates the extent to which the same genetic effects influence two different traits. If the genetic correlation between two traits is zero, the genetic effects on them are independent, whereas a correlation of 1.0 means that the same set of genes explains the heritability of both traits (regardless of how high or low the heritability of each is). Genetic correlations between specific mental abilities (such as verbal ability and spatial ability) have been consistently found to be very high, close to 1.0. This indicates that genetic variation in cognitive abilities is almost entirely due to genetic variation in whatever ''g'' is. It also suggests that what is common among cognitive abilities is largely caused by genes, and that independence among abilities is largely due to environmental effects. Thus it has been argued that when genes for intelligence are identified, they will be \"generalist genes\", each affecting many different cognitive abilities.<ref name=\"plomin&spinath\"/><ref>Kovas & Plomin 2006</ref><ref name=\"penke2007\">Penke et al. 2007</ref>\n\nThe ''g'' loadings of mental tests have been found to correlate with their heritabilities, with correlations ranging from moderate to perfect in various studies. Thus the heritability of a mental test is usually higher the larger its ''g'' loading is.<ref name=RJ2010>Rushton & Jensen 2010</ref>\n\nMuch research points to ''g'' being a highly [[Polygenic inheritance#Quantitative traits|polygenic trait]] influenced by many common genetic variants, each having only small effects. Another possibility is that heritable differences in ''g'' are due to individuals having different [[Genetic load|\"loads\"]] of rare, deleterious mutations, with genetic variation among individuals persisting due to [[mutation\u2013selection balance]].<ref name=\"penke2007\"/><ref name=\"Chabris\">Chabris et al. 2012</ref>\n\nA number of [[candidate gene]]s have been reported to be associated with intelligence differences, but the effect sizes have been small and almost none of the findings have been replicated. No individual genetic variants have been conclusively linked to intelligence in the normal range so far. Many researchers believe that very large samples will be needed to reliably detect individual genetic polymorphisms associated with ''g''.<ref name=\"deary2012\"/><ref name=\"Chabris\"/> However, while genes influencing variation in ''g'' in the normal range have proven difficult to find, many [[Single gene disorder|single-gene disorders]] with [[mental retardation]] among their symptoms have been discovered.<ref>Plomin 2003</ref>\n\nSeveral studies suggest that tests with larger ''g'' loadings are more affected by [[inbreeding depression]] lowering test scores. There is also evidence that tests with larger ''g'' loadings are associated with larger positive [[Heterosis|heterotic]] effects on test scores. Inbreeding depression and heterosis suggest the presence of [[Dominance (genetics)|genetic dominance effects]] for ''g''.<ref>Jensen 1998, 189\u2013197</ref>\n\n==Neuroscientific findings==\n{{Main|Neuroscience and intelligence}}\n\n''g'' has a number of correlates in the brain. Studies using [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) have established that ''g'' and total brain volume are moderately correlated (r~.3\u2013.4). External head size has a correlation of ~.2 with ''g''. MRI research on brain regions indicates that the volumes of [[Frontal cortex|frontal]], [[Parietal cortex|parietal]] and [[Temporal cortex|temporal cortices]], and the [[hippocampus]] are also correlated with ''g'', generally at .25 or more, while the correlations, averaged over many studies, with overall [[grey matter]] and overall [[white matter]] have been found to be .31 and .27, respectively. Some but not all studies have also found positive correlations between ''g'' and cortical thickness. However, the underlying reasons for these associations between the quantity of brain tissue and differences in cognitive abilities remain largely unknown.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/>\n\nMost researchers believe that intelligence cannot be localized to a single brain region, such as the frontal lobe. Brain [[lesion]] studies have found small but consistent associations indicating that people with more white matter lesions tend to have lower cognitive ability. Research utilizing [[NMR spectroscopy]] has discovered somewhat inconsistent but generally positive correlations between intelligence and white matter integrity, supporting the notion that white matter is important for intelligence.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/>\n\nSome research suggests that aside from the integrity of white matter, also its organizational efficiency is related to intelligence. The hypothesis that brain efficiency has a role in intelligence is supported by functional MRI research showing that more intelligent people generally process information more efficiently, i.e., they use fewer brain resources for the same task than less intelligent people.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/>\n\nSmall but relatively consistent associations with intelligence test scores include also brain activity, as measured by [[EEG|EEG records]] or [[event-related potential]]s, and [[nerve conduction velocity]].<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 134\u2013138</ref><ref name=\"chabris2007\">Chabris 2007</ref>\n\n==''g'' in non-humans==\n\n{{Main|g factor in non-humans}}\n\nEvidence of a general factor of intelligence has also been observed in non-human animals.

[[Myopia]] is known to be associated with intelligence, with a correlation of around .2 to .25, and this association has been found within families, too.<ref>Jensen 1998, 146, 149\u2013150</ref>\n\n==Group similarities and differences==\n\n{{See also|Sex and psychology|Race and intelligence|Nations and intelligence}}\n\nCross-cultural studies indicate that the ''g'' factor can be observed whenever a battery of diverse, complex cognitive tests is administered to a human sample. The factor structure of IQ tests has also been found to be consistent across sexes and ethnic groups in the U.S. and elsewhere.<ref name=\"chabris2007\"/> The ''g'' factor has been found to be the most invariant of all factors in cross-cultural comparisons. For example, when the ''g'' factors computed from an American standardization sample of Wechsler's IQ battery and from large samples who completed the Japanese translation of the same battery were compared, the [[congruence coefficient]] was .99, indicating virtual identity. Similarly, the congruence coefficient between the ''g'' factors obtained from white and black standardization samples of the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC]] battery in the U.S. was .995, and the variance in test scores accounted for by ''g'' was highly similar for both groups.<ref>Jensen 1998, 87\u201388</ref>\n\nMost studies suggest that there are negligible differences in the mean level of ''g'' between the sexes, and that sex differences in cognitive abilities are to be found in more narrow domains. For example, males generally outperform females in spatial tasks, while females generally outperform males in verbal tasks. Another difference that has been found in many studies is that males show more variability in both general and specific abilities than females, with proportionately more males at both the low end and the high end of the test score distribution.<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 360\u2013373</ref>\n\nConsistent differences between racial and ethnic groups in ''g'' have been found, particularly in the U.S. A 2001 meta-analysis of millions of subjects indicated that there is a 1.1 standard deviation gap in the mean level of ''g'' between white and black Americans, favoring the former. The mean score of Hispanic Americans was found to be .72 standard deviations below that of non-Hispanic whites.<ref>Roth et al. 2001</ref> In contrast, Americans of East Asian descent generally slightly outscore white Americans.<ref>Hunt 2011, 421</ref> Several researchers have suggested that the magnitude of the black-white gap in cognitive ability tests is dependent on the magnitude of the test's ''g'' loading, with tests showing higher ''g'' loadings producing larger gaps (see [[Spearman's hypothesis]]).<ref>Jensen 1998, 369\u2013399</ref> It has also been claimed that racial and ethnic differences similar to those found in the U.S. can be observed globally.<ref>Lynn 2003</ref>\n\n==Relation to other psychological constructs==\n\n===Elementary cognitive tasks===\n{{Main|Elementary cognitive task|Mental chronometry}}\n[[Image:Jensen box.gif|right|thumb|300px|An illustration of the [[Jensen box]], an apparatus for measuring choice reaction time.]]\nElementary cognitive tasks (ECTs) also correlate strongly with ''g''.<!--{{Citation needed|reason=Really? According to whom? What?|date=September 2010}} See reference below.--> ECTs are, as the name suggests, simple tasks that apparently require very little intelligence, but still correlate strongly with more exhaustive intelligence tests. Determining whether a light is red or blue and determining whether there are four or five squares drawn on a computer screen are two examples of ECTs. The answers to such questions are usually provided by quickly pressing buttons. Often, in addition to buttons for the two options provided, a third button is held down from the start of the test. When the stimulus is given to the subject, they remove their hand from the starting button to the button of the correct answer. This allows the examiner to determine how much time was spent thinking about the answer to the question (reaction time, usually measured in small fractions of second), and how much time was spent on physical hand movement to the correct button (movement time).  Reaction time correlates strongly with ''g'', while movement time correlates less strongly.<ref>Jensen 1998, 213</ref>\nECT testing has allowed quantitative examination of hypotheses concerning test bias, subject motivation, and group differences.  By virtue of their simplicity, ECTs provide a link between classical IQ testing and biological inquiries such as [[fMRI]] studies.\n\n===Working memory===\n\nOne theory holds that ''g'' is identical or nearly identical to [[Working memory|working memory capacity]]. Among other evidence for this view, some studies have found factors representing ''g'' and working memory to be perfectly correlated. However, in a meta-analysis the correlation was found to be considerably lower.<ref>Ackerman et al. 2005</ref> One criticism that has been made of studies that identify ''g'' with working memory is that \"we do not advance understanding by showing that one mysterious concept is linked to another.\"<ref>Mackintosh 2011, 158</ref>\n\n===Piagetian tasks===\n\nPsychometric theories of intelligence aim at quantifying intellectual growth and identifying ability differences between individuals and groups. In contrast, [[Jean Piaget]]'s [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|theory of cognitive development]] seeks to understand qualitative changes in children's intellectual development. Piaget designed a number of tasks to verify hypotheses arising from his theory. The tasks were not intended to measure individual differences, and they have no equivalent in psychometric intelligence tests.<ref name=\"Weinberg 1989\">Weinberg 1989</ref><ref>Lautrey 2002</ref> For example, in one of the best-known Piagetian [[Conservation (psychology)|conservation tasks]] a child is asked if the amount of water in two identical glasses is the same. After the child agrees that the amount is the same, the investigator pours the water from one of the glasses into a glass of different shape so that the amount appears different although it remains the same. The child is then asked if the amount of water in the two glasses is the same or different.\n\nNotwithstanding the different research traditions in which psychometric tests and Piagetian tasks were developed, the correlations between the two types of measures have been found to be consistently positive and generally moderate in magnitude. A common general factor underlies them. It has been shown that it is possible to construct a battery consisting of Piagetian tasks that is as good a measure of ''g'' as standard IQ tests.<ref name=\"Weinberg 1989\"/><ref>Humphreys et al. 1985</ref>\n\n===Personality===\n{{Main|Intelligence and personality}}\nThe traditional view in psychology is that there is no meaningful relationship between [[personality]] and intelligence, and that the two should be studied separately. Intelligence can be understood in terms of what an individual ''can'' do, or what his or her ''maximal'' performance is, while personality can be thought of in terms of what an individual ''will typically'' do, or what his or her general tendencies of behavior are. Research has indicated that correlations between measures of intelligence and personality are small, and it has thus been argued that ''g'' is a purely cognitive variable that is independent of personality traits. In a 2007 meta-analysis the correlations between ''g'' and the [[Big Five personality traits|\"Big Five\"]] personality traits were found to be as follows:\n* conscientiousness \u2212.04\n* agreeableness .00\n* extraversion .02\n* openness .22\n* emotional stability .09\nThe same meta-analysis found a correlation of .20 between [[self-efficacy]] and ''g''.<ref name=\"Stumm2011\">von Stumm et al. 2011</ref><ref>Jensen 1998, 573</ref><ref>Judge et al. 2007</ref>\n\nSome researchers have argued that the associations between intelligence and personality, albeit modest, are consistent. They have interpreted correlations between intelligence and personality measures in two main ways. The first perspective is that personality traits influence performance on intelligence ''tests''. For example, a person may fail to perform at a maximal level on an IQ test due to his or her anxiety and stress-proneness. The second perspective considers intelligence and personality to be ''conceptually'' related, with personality traits determining how people apply and invest their cognitive abilities, leading to knowledge expansion and greater cognitive differentiation.<ref name=\"Stumm2011\"/><ref name=\"Stumm2009\">von Stumm et al. 2009</ref>\n\n===Creativity===\n\nSome researchers believe that there is a threshold level of ''g'' below which socially significant [[creativity]] is rare, but that otherwise there is no relationship between the two. It has been suggested that this threshold is at least one standard deviation above the population mean. Above the threshold, personality differences are believed to be important determinants of individual variation in creativity.<ref>Jensen 1998, 577</ref><ref>Eysenck 1995</ref>\n\nOthers have challenged the threshold theory. While not disputing that opportunity and personal attributes other than intelligence, such as energy and commitment, are important for creativity, they argue that ''g'' is positively associated with creativity even at the high end of the ability distribution. The longitudinal [[Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth]] has provided evidence for this contention. It has showed that individuals identified by standardized tests as intellectually gifted in early adolescence accomplish creative achievements (for example, securing patents or publishing literary or scientific works) at several times the rate of the general population, and that even within the top 1 percent of cognitive ability, those with higher ability are more likely to make outstanding achievements. The study has also suggested that the level of ''g'' acts as a predictor of the ''level'' of achievement, while specific cognitive ability patterns predict the ''realm'' of achievement.<ref>Lubinski 2009</ref><ref>Robertson et al. 2010</ref>\n\n==Challenges==\n\n===G''f''-G''c'' theory===\n\n{{Main|Fluid and crystallized intelligence}}\n\n[[Raymond Cattell]], a student of Charles Spearman's, rejected the unitary ''g'' factor model and divided ''g'' into two broad, relatively independent domains: fluid intelligence (G''f'') and crystallized intelligence (G''c''). G''f'' is conceptualized as a capacity to figure out novel problems, and it is best assessed with tests with little cultural or scholastic content, such as Raven's matrices. G''c'' can be thought of as consolidated knowledge, reflecting the skills and information that an individual acquires and retains throughout his or her life. G''c'' is dependent on education and other forms of acculturation, and it is best assessed with tests that emphasize scholastic and cultural knowledge.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/><ref name=\"d&k\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 122\u2013123</ref> G''f'' can be thought to primarily consist of ''current'' reasoning and problem solving capabilities, while G''c'' reflects the outcome of ''previously'' executed cognitive processes.<ref>Sternberg et al. 1981</ref>\n\nThe rationale for the separation of G''f'' and G''c'' was to explain individuals' cognitive development over time. While G''f'' and G''c'' have been found to be highly correlated, they differ in the way they change over a lifetime. G''f'' tends to peak at around age 20, slowly declining thereafter. In contrast, G''c'' is stable or increases across adulthood. A single general factor has been criticized as obscuring this bifurcated pattern of development. Cattell argued that G''f'' reflected individual differences in the efficiency of the [[central nervous system]]. G''c'' was, in Cattell's thinking, the result of a person \"investing\" his or her G''f'' in learning experiences throughout life.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/><ref name=\"horn&mcardle\">Horn & McArdle 2007</ref><ref name=\"d&k\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 123</ref>\n\nCattell, together with John Horn, later expanded the G''f''-G''c'' model to include a number of other broad abilities, such as G''q'' (quantitative reasoning) and G''v'' (visual-spatial reasoning). While all the broad ability factors in the extended G''f''-G''c'' model are positively correlated and thus would enable the extraction of a higher order ''g'' factor, Cattell and Horn maintained that it would be erroneous to posit that a general factor underlies these broad abilities. They argued that ''g'' factors computed from different test batteries are not invariant and would give different values of ''g'', and that the correlations among tests arise because it is difficult to test just one ability at a time.<ref name=\"deary2010\"/><ref name=\"McGrew 2005\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 124</ref>\n\nHowever, several researchers have suggested that the G''f''-G''c'' model is compatible with a ''g''-centered understanding of cognitive abilities. For example, [[John B. Carroll]]'s [[Three stratum theory|three-stratum model of intelligence]] includes both G''f'' and G''c'' together with a higher-order ''g'' factor. Based on factor analyses of many data sets, some researchers have also argued that G''f'' and ''g'' are one and the same factor and that ''g'' factors from different test batteries are substantially invariant provided that the batteries are large and diverse.<ref name=\"d&k\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 125</ref><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 152\u2013153</ref>\n\n===Theories of uncorrelated abilities===\n\nSeveral theorists have proposed that there are intellectual abilities that are uncorrelated with each other. Among the earliest was [[L.L. Thurstone]] who created a model of ''primary mental abilities'' representing supposedly independent domains of intelligence. However, Thurstone's tests of these abilities were found to produce a strong general factor. He argued that the lack of independence among his tests reflected the difficulty of constructing \"factorially pure\" tests that measured just one ability. Similarly, [[J.P. Guilford]] proposed a model of intelligence that comprised up to 180 distinct, uncorrelated abilities, and claimed to be able to test all of them. Later analyses have shown that the factorial procedures Guilford presented as evidence for his theory did not provide support for it, and that the test data that he claimed provided evidence against ''g'' did in fact exhibit the usual pattern of intercorrelations after correction for statistical artifacts.<ref>Jensen 1998, 77\u201378, 115\u2013117</ref><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 52, 239</ref>\n\nMore recently, [[Howard Gardner]] has developed the [[theory of multiple intelligences]]. He posits the existence of nine different and independent domains of intelligence, such as mathematical, linguistic, spatial, musical, bodily-kinesthetic, meta-cognitive, and existential intelligences, and contends that individuals who fail in some of them may excel in others. According to Gardner, tests and schools traditionally emphasize only linguistic and logical abilities while neglecting other forms of intelligence. While popular among educationalists, Gardner's theory has been much criticized by psychologists and psychometricians. One criticism is that the theory does violence to both scientific and everyday usages of the word \"intelligence.\" Several researchers have argued that not all of Gardner's intelligences fall within the cognitive sphere. For example, Gardner contends that a successful career in professional sports or popular music reflects bodily-kinesthetic ''intelligence'' and musical ''intelligence'', respectively, even though one might usually talk of athletic and musical ''skills'', ''talents'', or ''abilities'' instead. Another criticism of Gardner's theory is that many of his purportedly independent domains of intelligence are in fact correlated with each other. Responding to empirical analyses showing correlations between the domains, Gardner has argued that the correlations exist because of the [[Common-method variance|common format]] of tests and because all tests require linguistic and logical skills. His critics have in turn pointed out that not all IQ tests are administered in the paper-and-pencil format, that aside from linguistic and logical abilities, IQ test batteries contain also measures of, for example, spatial abilities, and that elementary cognitive tasks (for example, inspection time and reaction time) that do not involve linguistic or logical reasoning correlate with conventional IQ batteries, too.<ref name=\"brody2006\"/><ref>Jensen 1998, 128\u2013132</ref><ref>Deary 2001, 15\u201316</ref><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 236\u2013237</ref>\n\n[[Robert Sternberg]], working with various colleagues, has also suggested that intelligence has dimensions independent of ''g''. He argues that there are three classes of intelligence: analytic, practical, and creative. According to Sternberg, traditional psychometric tests measure only analytic intelligence, and should be augmented to test creative and practical intelligence as well. He has devised several tests to this effect. Sternberg equates analytic intelligence with academic intelligence, and contrasts it with practical intelligence, defined as an ability to deal with ill-defined real-life problems. Tacit intelligence is an important component of practical intelligence, consisting of knowledge that is not explicitly taught but is required in many real-life situations. Assessing creativity independent of intelligence tests has traditionally proved difficult, but Sternberg and colleagues have claimed to have created valid tests of creativity, too. The validation of Sternberg's theory requires that the three abilities tested are substantially uncorrelated and have independent predictive validity. Sternberg has conducted many experiments which he claims confirm the validity of his theory, but several researchers have disputed this conclusion. For example, in his reanalysis of a validation study of Sternberg's STAT test, [[Nathan Brody]] showed that the predictive validity of the STAT, a test of three allegedly independent abilities, was almost solely due to a single general factor underlying the tests, which Brody equated with the ''g'' factor.<ref>Hunt 2011, 120\u2013130</ref><ref>Mackintosh 2011, 223\u2013235</ref>\n\n===Flynn's model===\n\n[[Jim Flynn (academic)|James Flynn]] has argued that intelligence should be conceptualized at three different levels: brain physiology, cognitive differences between individuals, and social trends in intelligence over time. According to this model, the ''g'' factor is a useful concept with respect to individual differences but its explanatory power is limited when the focus of investigation is either brain physiology, or, especially, the effect of social trends on intelligence. Flynn has criticized the notion that cognitive gains over time, or the Flynn effect, are \"hollow\" if they cannot be shown to be increases in ''g''. He argues that the Flynn effect reflects shifting social priorities and individuals' adaptation to them. To apply the individual differences concept of ''g'' to the Flynn effect is to confuse different levels of analysis. On the other hand, according to Flynn, it is also fallacious to deny, by referring to trends in intelligence over time, that some individuals have \"better brains and minds\" to cope with the cognitive demands of their particular time. At the level of brain physiology, Flynn has emphasized both that localized neural clusters can be affected differently by cognitive exercise, and that there are important factors that affect all neural clusters.<ref>Flynn 2011</ref>\n\n===Other criticisms===\n\nPerhaps the most famous critique of the construct of ''g'' is that of the paleontologist and biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]], presented in his 1981 book ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]''. He argued that psychometricians have fallaciously [[Reification (fallacy)|reified]] the ''g'' factor as a physical thing in the brain, even though it is simply the product of statistical calculations (i.e., factor analysis). He further noted that it is possible to produce factor solutions of cognitive test data that do not contain a ''g'' factor yet explain the same amount of information as solutions that yield a ''g''. According to Gould, there is no rationale for preferring one factor solution to another, and factor analysis therefore does not lend support to the existence of an entity like ''g''. More generally, Gould criticized the ''g'' theory for abstracting intelligence as a single entity and for ranking people \"in a single series of worthiness\", arguing that such rankings are used to justify the oppression of disadvantaged groups.<ref name=\"carroll1995\"/><ref>Gould 1996, 56\u201357</ref>\n\nMany researchers have criticized Gould's arguments. For example, they have rejected the accusation of reification, maintaining that the use of extracted factors such as ''g'' as potential causal variables whose reality can be supported or rejected by further investigations constitutes a normal scientific practice that in no way distinguishes psychometrics from other sciences. Critics have also suggested that Gould did not understand the purpose of factor analysis, and that he was ignorant of relevant methodological advances in the field. While different factor solutions may be mathematically equivalent in their ability to account for intercorrelations among tests, solutions that yield a ''g'' factor are psychologically preferable for several reasons extrinsic to factor analysis, including the phenomenon of the positive manifold, the fact that the same ''g'' can emerge from quite different test batteries, the widespread practical validity of ''g'', and the linkage of ''g'' to many biological variables.<ref name=\"carroll1995\"/><ref name=\"jensen1982\"/><ref>Korb 1994</ref>\n\nJohn Horn and John McArdle have argued that the modern ''g'' theory, as espoused by, for example, Arthur Jensen, is [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]], because the existence of a common factor like ''g'' follows [[Tautology (logic)|tautologically]] from positive correlations among tests. They contrasted the modern hierarchical theory of ''g'' with Spearman's original two-factor theory which was readily falsifiable (and indeed was falsified).<ref name=\"horn&mcardle\"/>\n\nOne critic has argued that ''g'' \"...is to the psychometricians what [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]]' [[aether theories|ether]] was to early physicists: a nonentity taken as an article of faith instead of one in need of verification by real data.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Graves |first=Joseph L. |authorlink=Joseph L.

These component ions can be [[inorganic compound|inorganic]], such as chloride (Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>), or [[organic chemistry|organic]], such as [[acetate]] ({{chem|CH|3|CO|2|\u2212}}); and can be [[monatomic ion|monatomic]], such as fluoride (F<sup>\u2212</sup>) or [[polyatomic ion|polyatomic]], such as [[sulfate]] ({{chem|SO|4|2\u2212}}).\n\n==Types of salt==\nSalts can be classified in a variety of ways. Salts that produce [[hydroxide]] [[ions]] when dissolved in [[water]] are called ''[[alkali salt]]s''.  Salts that produce [[acidic]] solutions are ''[[acid salt]]s''. ''Neutral salts'' are those salts that are neither acidic nor basic. [[Zwitterion]]s contain an anionic and a cationic centre in the same [[molecule]], but are not considered to be salts. Examples of zwitterions include [[amino acid]]s, many [[metabolite]]s, [[peptide]]s, and [[protein]]s.<ref>{{cite book |ref = Voet |author1 = Voet, D. |author2 = Voet, J, G. |lastauthoramp = yes |year = 2005 |title = Biochemistry |edition = 3rd |publisher = John Wiley & Sons Inc. |location = Hoboken, NJ |url = http://www.chem.upenn.edu/chem/research/faculty.php?browse=V |isbn = 9780471193500 |doi =  |pages = 68 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070911065858/http://www.chem.upenn.edu/chem/research/faculty.php?browse=V |archive-date = 2007-09-11 |df =  }}</ref>\n\n== Properties ==\n[[File:ILfromOS.svg|thumb|[[BMIM-PF6|BMIM<sup>+</sup>PF<sub>6</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>]], an [[ionic liquid]]]]\n\n=== Color ===\nSolid salts tend to be [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] as illustrated by [[sodium chloride]]. In many cases, the apparent [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] or [[Transparency (optics)|transparency]] are only related to the difference in size of the individual [[monocrystal]]s. Since light reflects from the [[Crystallite|grain boundaries]] (boundaries between crystallites), larger [[crystal]]s tend to be transparent, while the [[polycrystalline]] aggregates look like white powders.\n\nSalts exist in many different [[color]]s, which arise either from the anions or cations.  For example:\n\n* [[sodium chromate]] is yellow by virtue of the [[chromate ion]] \n* [[potassium dichromate]] is orange by virtue of the [[dichromate ion]]\n* [[cobalt nitrate]] is red owing to the chromophore of hydrated cobalt(II) ([Co(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>).\n* [[copper(II) sulfate|copper sulfate]] is blue because of the copper(II) chromophore\n* [[potassium permanganate]] has the violet color of [[permanganate]] anion.\n* [[nickel(II) chloride|nickel chloride]] is typically green of [NiCl<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>]\n* [[sodium chloride]], [[Magnesium sulfate|magnesium sulfate heptahydrate]] are colorless or white because the constituent cations and anions do not absorb in the visible part of the spectrum\n\nFew [[minerals]] are salts because they would be solubilized by water. Similarly inorganic [[pigment]]s tend not to be salts, because insolubility is required for fastness.  Some organic [[dye]]s are salts, but they are virtually insoluble in water.\n\n=== Taste ===\nDifferent salts can elicit all five [[basic taste]]s, e.g., salty ([[sodium chloride]]), sweet ([[lead diacetate]], which will cause [[lead poisoning]] if ingested), sour ([[potassium bitartrate]]), [[Bitter (taste)|bitter]] ([[magnesium sulfate]]), and [[umami]] or savory ([[monosodium glutamate]]).\n\n=== Odor ===\nSalts of strong acids and strong bases (\"[[#Strong salt|strong salts]]\") are non-[[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] and often odorless, whereas salts of either weak acids or weak bases (\"[[#Weak salt|weak salts]]\") may smell like the [[conjugate acid]] (e.g., acetates like acetic acid ([[vinegar]]) and cyanides like [[hydrogen cyanide]] ([[almond]]s)) or the conjugate base (e.g., ammonium salts like [[ammonia]]) of the component ions. That slow, partial decomposition is usually accelerated by the presence of water, since [[hydrolysis]] is the other half of the [[reversible reaction]] equation of formation of weak salts.\n\n=== Solubility ===\n{{see also|Solubility#Solubility of ionic compounds in water}}\nMany ionic compounds exhibit significant [[Dissolution (chemistry)|solubility]] in water or other polar solvents. Unlike molecular compounds, salts dissociate in solution into anionic and cationic components.  \nThe [[lattice energy]], the cohesive forces between these ions within a solid, determines the solubility. The solubility is dependent on how well each ion interacts with the solvent, so certain patterns become apparent. For example, salts of [[sodium]], [[potassium]] and ammonium are usually soluble in water.  Notable exceptions include [[ammonium hexachloroplatinate]] and [[potassium cobaltinitrite]].  Most [[nitrates]] and many [[sulfate]]s are water-soluble. Exceptions include [[barium sulfate]], [[calcium sulfate]] (sparingly soluble), and [[lead(II) sulfate]], where the 2+/2\u2212 pairing leads to high lattice energies.  For similar reasons, most alkali metal [[carbonate]]s are not soluble in water. Some soluble carbonate salts are: [[sodium carbonate]], [[potassium carbonate]] and [[ammonium carbonate]].\n\n=== Conductivity ===\n[[File:SegStackEdgeOnHMTFCQ.jpg|thumb|Edge-on view of portion of crystal structure of  hexamethylene[[Tetrathiafulvene|TTF]]/[[TCNQ]] charge transfer salt.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=D.

Molten salts or solutions of salts conduct electricity.  For this reason, liquified (molten) salts and solutions containing dissolved salts (e.g., sodium chloride in water) are called [[electrolyte]]s.\n\n===Melting point===\nSalts characteristically have high melting points.  For example, [[sodium chloride]] melts at 801&nbsp;\u00b0C.  Some salts with low lattice energies are liquid at or near room temperature.  These include [[molten salt]]s, which are usually mixtures of salts, and [[ionic liquid]]s, which usually contain organic cations.

These component ions can be [[inorganic compound|inorganic]], such as chloride (Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>), or [[organic chemistry|organic]], such as [[acetate]] ({{chem|CH|3|CO|2|\u2212}}); and can be [[monatomic ion|monatomic]], such as fluoride (F<sup>\u2212</sup>) or [[polyatomic ion|polyatomic]], such as [[sulfate]] ({{chem|SO|4|2\u2212}}).\n\n==Types of salt==\nSalts can be classified in a variety of ways. Salts that produce [[hydroxide]] [[ions]] when dissolved in [[water]] are called ''[[alkali salt]]s''.  Salts that produce [[acidic]] solutions are ''[[acid salt]]s''. ''Neutral salts'' are those salts that are neither acidic nor basic. [[Zwitterion]]s contain an anionic and a cationic centre in the same [[molecule]], but are not considered to be salts. Examples of zwitterions include [[amino acid]]s, many [[metabolite]]s, [[peptide]]s, and [[protein]]s.<ref>{{cite book |ref = Voet |author1 = Voet, D. |author2 = Voet, J, G. |lastauthoramp = yes |year = 2005 |title = Biochemistry |edition = 3rd |publisher = John Wiley & Sons Inc. |location = Hoboken, NJ |url = http://www.chem.upenn.edu/chem/research/faculty.php?browse=V |isbn = 9780471193500 |doi =  |pages = 68 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070911065858/http://www.chem.upenn.edu/chem/research/faculty.php?browse=V |archive-date = 2007-09-11 |df =  }}</ref>\n\n== Properties ==\n[[File:ILfromOS.svg|thumb|[[BMIM-PF6|BMIM<sup>+</sup>PF<sub>6</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>]], an [[ionic liquid]]]]\n\n=== Color ===\nSolid salts tend to be [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] as illustrated by [[sodium chloride]]. In many cases, the apparent [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] or [[Transparency (optics)|transparency]] are only related to the difference in size of the individual [[monocrystal]]s. Since light reflects from the [[Crystallite|grain boundaries]] (boundaries between crystallites), larger [[crystal]]s tend to be transparent, while the [[polycrystalline]] aggregates look like white powders.\n\nSalts exist in many different [[color]]s, which arise either from the anions or cations.  For example:\n\n* [[sodium chromate]] is yellow by virtue of the [[chromate ion]] \n* [[potassium dichromate]] is orange by virtue of the [[dichromate ion]]\n* [[cobalt nitrate]] is red owing to the chromophore of hydrated cobalt(II) ([Co(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>).\n* [[copper(II) sulfate|copper sulfate]] is blue because of the copper(II) chromophore\n* [[potassium permanganate]] has the violet color of [[permanganate]] anion.\n* [[nickel(II) chloride|nickel chloride]] is typically green of [NiCl<sub>2</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>]\n* [[sodium chloride]], [[Magnesium sulfate|magnesium sulfate heptahydrate]] are colorless or white because the constituent cations and anions do not absorb in the visible part of the spectrum\n\nFew [[minerals]] are salts because they would be solubilized by water. Similarly inorganic [[pigment]]s tend not to be salts, because insolubility is required for fastness.  Some organic [[dye]]s are salts, but they are virtually insoluble in water.\n\n=== Taste ===\nDifferent salts can elicit all five [[basic taste]]s, e.g., salty ([[sodium chloride]]), sweet ([[lead diacetate]], which will cause [[lead poisoning]] if ingested), sour ([[potassium bitartrate]]), [[Bitter (taste)|bitter]] ([[magnesium sulfate]]), and [[umami]] or savory ([[monosodium glutamate]]).\n\n=== Odor ===\nSalts of strong acids and strong bases (\"[[#Strong salt|strong salts]]\") are non-[[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] and often odorless, whereas salts of either weak acids or weak bases (\"[[#Weak salt|weak salts]]\") may smell like the [[conjugate acid]] (e.g., acetates like acetic acid ([[vinegar]]) and cyanides like [[hydrogen cyanide]] ([[almond]]s)) or the conjugate base (e.g., ammonium salts like [[ammonia]]) of the component ions. That slow, partial decomposition is usually accelerated by the presence of water, since [[hydrolysis]] is the other half of the [[reversible reaction]] equation of formation of weak salts.\n\n=== Solubility ===\n{{see also|Solubility#Solubility of ionic compounds in water}}\nMany ionic compounds exhibit significant [[Dissolution (chemistry)|solubility]] in water or other polar solvents. Unlike molecular compounds, salts dissociate in solution into anionic and cationic components.  \nThe [[lattice energy]], the cohesive forces between these ions within a solid, determines the solubility. The solubility is dependent on how well each ion interacts with the solvent, so certain patterns become apparent. For example, salts of [[sodium]], [[potassium]] and ammonium are usually soluble in water.  Notable exceptions include [[ammonium hexachloroplatinate]] and [[potassium cobaltinitrite]].  Most [[nitrates]] and many [[sulfate]]s are water-soluble. Exceptions include [[barium sulfate]], [[calcium sulfate]] (sparingly soluble), and [[lead(II) sulfate]], where the 2+/2\u2212 pairing leads to high lattice energies.  For similar reasons, most alkali metal [[carbonate]]s are not soluble in water. Some soluble carbonate salts are: [[sodium carbonate]], [[potassium carbonate]] and [[ammonium carbonate]].\n\n=== Conductivity ===\n[[File:SegStackEdgeOnHMTFCQ.jpg|thumb|Edge-on view of portion of crystal structure of  hexamethylene[[Tetrathiafulvene|TTF]]/[[TCNQ]] charge transfer salt.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=D.

Molten salts or solutions of salts conduct electricity.  For this reason, liquified (molten) salts and solutions containing dissolved salts (e.g., sodium chloride in water) are called [[electrolyte]]s.\n\n===Melting point===\nSalts characteristically have high melting points.  For example, [[sodium chloride]] melts at 801&nbsp;\u00b0C.  Some salts with low lattice energies are liquid at or near room temperature.  These include [[molten salt]]s, which are usually mixtures of salts, and [[ionic liquid]]s, which usually contain organic cations.  These liquids exhibit unusual properties as solvents.\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\nThe name of a salt starts with the name of the cation (e.g., ''sodium'' or ''ammonium'') followed by the name of the anion (e.g., ''chloride'' or ''acetate'').

It was conceived of in 1990\u20131991 by [[George Weidenfeld|Lord Weidenfeld]] and Sir [[Ronnie Grierson]] and they persuaded [[Roy Jenkins]], who had just become Chancellor of the [[University of Oxford]], to push this initiative in conjunction with the universities of [[Leiden University|Leiden]], and [[University of Bologna|Bologna]].<ref name=\"KUL\"/> It has subsequently been supporting the \"advancement of education through the encouragement of European studies in the University of Oxford and other European institutions of higher education having links with Oxford.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.helsinki.fi/en/networks/centre-for-european-studies/europaeum|title=Eurooppa-tutkimus / Europaeum|date=2018-04-23|website=University of Helsinki|language=en|access-date=2019-06-08}}</ref>\n\n==Outline==\nThe Europaeum aims to promote movement of academic staff and students between these institutions,<ref name=\":0\" /> with \u2018the study of the languages, history, cultures and professions of the people of Europe\u2019. It brings together talented students and faculty working in the Humanities and the Social Sciences, to promote a better \u2018sense of Europe\u2019 through collaboration and academic mobility. \n\n==The Europaeum's mission==\n\n* to promote excellence in academic research and teaching collaboration between Europaeum partners\n* to develop a 'pool of talent' to carry out research and inquiry into problems confronting Europe\n* to act as an open academic network linking Europaeum partners and other bodies in the joint pursuit of study\n* to provide opportunities for the joint undertaking of new pan-European initiatives\n* to explore new ways for universities to fulfil their many roles in the new Learning Age\n* to train and educate future leaders for a new Europe\n\nFor 25 years, the Europaeum has successfully encouraged collaboration between European research universities, facilitated tripartite dialogue between academics, students, and those working in the public and private sectors, and has contributed to European-wide debates about culture, politics, and society, as well as established excellent faculty collaboration and student exchange; earned a reputation for organising strikingly successful student Spring and Summer Schools, public debates, seminars, joint teaching programmes, lectures and workshops; and run high quality linked scholarship schemes.\n\nThe Europaeum Scholars Programme (launched in 2018) is the latest venture to bring together the values and vision of the Europaeum, with a focus on themes such as inclusion, sustainability, and growth and development.\n\nThe Europaeum's belief is that today, we need more not less international collaboration, more not less emphasis on universities engaging with the wider society, and more not less connection between the disciplines. Fresh cohorts of talented young people, committed to making a difference for the better, are essential to shaping the future of Europe for the better.\n\n==History==\n\n===1992\u20132000===\n\nThe Europaeum's international network was launched in 1992 by Oxford, Leiden and Bologna. Oxford played the lead role, both spearheading a significant fund-raising drive across Europe, and giving the consortium the status of an official university department. The Europaeum helped to spawn two independent centres: the Institute for the Advanced Study of European and Comparative Law (IECL) and the Centre for European Politics, Economics and Society (CEPES), which closed in 2003.\n\nA range of scholarships for European graduates to come to Oxford were set up as well as collaborative activities such as international conferences, summer schools, and academic mobility.\n\nThe network expanded to include [[Bonn University]] (Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t Bonn)  in 1996; then [[Paris I]] (Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne) in 1997; the then Geneva HEI, now the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]] in 1998.\n\n===2000\u20132010===\n\n[[Charles University]], Prague, joined in 2001, and the Europaeum Review was launched in the same year.\n\nA regular newsletter was set up from Oxford, alongside its own website, and a database to try to link academics working in European Law, Politics and Economics. In 2003, a part-time Secretary-General ([[Paul Flather|Dr Paul Flather]]) was appointed to oversee the overall growth and development of the Europaeum. The Europaeum Office moved from the Central University Offices to rented offices on the Banbury Road, leased from the Oxford [[Voltaire Foundation]], and the organisation became a Charity (Registration Number 1105477) in 2004. Academic mobility was boosted under the Europaeum Visiting Academics scheme enabling leading academics to teach and research at partner institutions within the association, helping nourish future academic and teaching links. Two innovative programmes, an MA in European Politics, Culture, History and Institutions, linking Bologna, Leiden and Oxford, and a plan for modular programmes in European Business, Culture, and Institutions, initially to link Leiden and Oxford, were run as pilot projects.\n\nIn 2003, [[Complutense University of Madrid]] joined the Europaeum. [[Helsinki University]] followed in 2004, and the [[Jagiellonian University]], Krak\u00f3w, in 2005, bringing the association to its target of 10 members.\n\nIn 2004\u20132005, Oxford, Paris and Leiden launched a new jointly-offered Europaeum MA in European History and Civilisation. Three new major themed programmes were launched, each running with linked workshops, seminars, conferences and lectures: the Humanities and New Technology programme in 2003, the Islam-in-Europe programme in 2004, and the US-Europe TransAtlantic Dialogue programme in 2005.\n\nFollowing the death of [[Roy Jenkins]] in 2003, one of the founders of the Europaeum and former Chancellor of the University of Oxford, a memorial fund was set up to raise funds for European scholarships, and these have been directly linked to the Europaeum by the trustees. The first two awards were made in 2004 and the scheme ended in 2017 due to lack of further funds.\n\n===2010 to 2016===\n\nA new Board of Trustees was established in 2009\u201310, to take over fund-raising, networking and overall supervisory duties from the more cumbersome Council, which was converted into the Academic Council focussing on academic matters. The trustees included the two founding fathers, George Weidenfeld and  Ronald Grierson, as well as the third co-opted member of the former Europaeum Council, with M Keller elected to the chair, while Dr [[Andrew Graham (academic)|Andrew Graham]] from Oxford was appointed a permanent chair of the Academic Council to ensure continuity.\n\nPompeu-Fabra University (Barcelona) joined in 2012, and Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in 2015.\n\nA new joint academic programme was launched in 2012 by the Universities of Prague, Leiden and Paris, around the theme of European Politics and Society, aiming for about 20 graduates spending their second year of study on a two-year graduate programme, at a partner institution. The programme was named in tribute to the late President of the Czech Republic and important human rights activist [[V\u00e1clav Havel|Vaclav Havel]].\n\n===2016 to the present===\n\nFrom 2016 to 2020, [[Andrew Graham (academic)|Andrew Graham]] has led a substantial restructuring of the Europaeum. In particular he created and launched a new Europaeum Scholarship Programme and, as a result, the full university membership has subsequently grown from eleven in 2016 to seventeen now.\n\nNew members included the [[University of St Andrews]], the [[University of Luxembourg]],  [[KU Leuven]], Freie Universitat,Berlin, the Catholic University of Lisbon,the [[University of Copenhagen]], and Bologna (who re-joined).<ref>{{cite web|title=St Andrews announces membership of influential European university network|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/news/archive/2017/title,1302613,en.php}}</ref> The [[Central European University]] (Budapest/Vienna) was added as a special member for a limited period in recognition and support of their circumstances.\n\nIn addition, Dr Graham became Executive Chair, Dr Hartmut Mayer was appointed as Acting Director (Dr Flather having stood down from being Secretary General), the Governance was modernised (with a new smaller Executive Committee, chaired by Dr Graham, replacing the Steering Committee).(- see [https://europaeum.org/news-press-releases/ Press Release]), Dr Tracey Sowerby was appointed Programme Director to lead the Scholars Programme and an Alumni Programme was initiated.\n\n==Joint MA programmes==\nThe Europaeum organises two Joint MA Programmes, the MA European History and Civilization and the Europaeum V\u00e1clav Havel Masters Programme (EMAP). Partner universities of the one-year degree '''MA European History and Civilisation''' are the [[Leiden University]], [[University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne]] and the [[University of Oxford]]. Participating students will visit each of these universities for one trimester.\n\nThe Europaeum '''V\u00e1clav Havel Masters Programme''', named after [[V\u00e1clav Havel]], the late Czech dissident and President, is a two-years Masters Programme in European Society and Politics. This programme is organized by the [[Leiden University]], [[University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne]] and the [[Charles University in Prague]].\n\n==Scholarship schemes==\n\n===Europaeum Scholars Programme===\n\nLaunched in January 2018 with thirty selected doctoral students from the member Universities, the Europaeum Scholars Programme is a two-year long innovative initiative that draws together talented scholars from across Europe who are committed to making a difference. Its cross-disciplinary, cross-university and cross-cultural nature combined with a strong practical ethos and collaborative project work provides scholars with a firm grounding with which to tackle the challenges facing Europe today.\n\n===Jenkins Memorial Scholarship===\n\nThe Jenkins Scholarship Scheme honoured the lifelong achievements of [[Roy Jenkins]], the former President of the European Commission (1976\u20131981) and Chancellor of the University of Oxford (1987\u20132003). This scholarship finished in 2017 due to lack of further funds.\n\n===Study bursaries===\n\nThe Europaeum organises study bursaries in cooperation with Charles University (Prague), the Graduate Institute in Geneva and Helsinki University. These support an Oxford graduate to pursue a short period of research at these member institutions, and one from each of these member institutions to come to Oxford on a self-directed research trip.\n\n==Members==\n{{Location map+|Europe|caption=Locations of Europaeum member universities|float=right|width=450|places=\n{{Location map~|Europe|lat=50.09|long=14.40|position=top|label=[[Charles University|Charles]]}}\n{{Location map~|Europe|lat=55.68|long=12.57|position=top|label=[[University of Copenhagen|Copenhagen]]}}\n{{Location map~|Europe|lat=60.17|long=24.95|position=right|label=[[University of Helsinki|Helsinki]]}}\n{{Location map~|Europe|lat=48.85|long=02.34|position=left|label=[[University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne|Paris 1]]}}\n{{Location map~|Europe|lat=48.15|long=11.58|position=bottom|label=[[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|LMU]]}}\n{{Location map~|Europe|lat=52.45|long=13.29|position=top|label=[[Free University of Berlin|FU Berlin]]}}\n{{Location map~|Europe|lat=44.49|long=11.34|position=right|label=[[University of Bologna|Bologna]]}}\n{{Location map~|Europe|lat=52.16|long=04.49|position=right|label=[[Leiden University|Leiden]]}}\n{{Location map~|Europe|lat=49.05|long=05.95|position=right|label=[[University of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]]}}\n{{Location map~|Europe|lat=50.06|long=19.93|position=right|label=[[Jagiellonian University|Jagiellonian]]}}\n{{Location map~|Europe|lat=41.38|long=02.18|position=right|label=[[Pompeu Fabra University|Pompeu Fabra]]}}\n{{Location map~|Europe|lat=40.45|long=-3.73|position=bottom|label=[[Complutense University of Madrid|Complutense]]}}\n{{Location map~|Europe|lat=46.22|long=06.15|position=left|label=[[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies|IHEID]]}}\n{{Location map~|Europe|lat=51.76|long=-1.26|position=top|label=[[University of Oxford|Oxford]]}}\n{{Location map~|Europe|lat=56.34|long=-2.79|position=top|label=[[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]]}}\n{{Location map~|Europe|lat=41.15|long=-8.67|position=top|label=[[Catholic University of Portugal|Cat\u00f3lica]]}}\n{{Location map~|Europe|lat=50.88|long=04.70|position=left|label=[[KU Leuven]]}}\n}}\n\nThe Europaeum currently has seventeen members universities located in fourteen countries.

It was conceived of in 1990\u20131991 by [[George Weidenfeld|Lord Weidenfeld]] and Sir [[Ronnie Grierson]] and they persuaded [[Roy Jenkins]], who had just become Chancellor of the [[University of Oxford]], to push this initiative in conjunction with the universities of [[Leiden University|Leiden]], and [[University of Bologna|Bologna]].<ref name=\"KUL\"/> It has subsequently been supporting the \"advancement of education through the encouragement of European studies in the University of Oxford and other European institutions of higher education having links with Oxford.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.helsinki.fi/en/networks/centre-for-european-studies/europaeum|title=Eurooppa-tutkimus / Europaeum|date=2018-04-23|website=University of Helsinki|language=en|access-date=2019-06-08}}</ref>\n\n==Outline==\nThe Europaeum aims to promote movement of academic staff and students between these institutions,<ref name=\":0\" /> with \u2018the study of the languages, history, cultures and professions of the people of Europe\u2019. It brings together talented students and faculty working in the Humanities and the Social Sciences, to promote a better \u2018sense of Europe\u2019 through collaboration and academic mobility. \n\n==The Europaeum's mission==\n\n* to promote excellence in academic research and teaching collaboration between Europaeum partners\n* to develop a 'pool of talent' to carry out research and inquiry into problems confronting Europe\n* to act as an open academic network linking Europaeum partners and other bodies in the joint pursuit of study\n* to provide opportunities for the joint undertaking of new pan-European initiatives\n* to explore new ways for universities to fulfil their many roles in the new Learning Age\n* to train and educate future leaders for a new Europe\n\nFor 25 years, the Europaeum has successfully encouraged collaboration between European research universities, facilitated tripartite dialogue between academics, students, and those working in the public and private sectors, and has contributed to European-wide debates about culture, politics, and society, as well as established excellent faculty collaboration and student exchange; earned a reputation for organising strikingly successful student Spring and Summer Schools, public debates, seminars, joint teaching programmes, lectures and workshops; and run high quality linked scholarship schemes.\n\nThe Europaeum Scholars Programme (launched in 2018) is the latest venture to bring together the values and vision of the Europaeum, with a focus on themes such as inclusion, sustainability, and growth and development.\n\nThe Europaeum's belief is that today, we need more not less international collaboration, more not less emphasis on universities engaging with the wider society, and more not less connection between the disciplines. Fresh cohorts of talented young people, committed to making a difference for the better, are essential to shaping the future of Europe for the better.\n\n==History==\n\n===1992\u20132000===\n\nThe Europaeum's international network was launched in 1992 by Oxford, Leiden and Bologna. Oxford played the lead role, both spearheading a significant fund-raising drive across Europe, and giving the consortium the status of an official university department. The Europaeum helped to spawn two independent centres: the Institute for the Advanced Study of European and Comparative Law (IECL) and the Centre for European Politics, Economics and Society (CEPES), which closed in 2003.\n\nA range of scholarships for European graduates to come to Oxford were set up as well as collaborative activities such as international conferences, summer schools, and academic mobility.\n\nThe network expanded to include [[Bonn University]] (Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t Bonn)  in 1996; then [[Paris I]] (Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne) in 1997; the then Geneva HEI, now the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]] in 1998.\n\n===2000\u20132010===\n\n[[Charles University]], Prague, joined in 2001, and the Europaeum Review was launched in the same year.\n\nA regular newsletter was set up from Oxford, alongside its own website, and a database to try to link academics working in European Law, Politics and Economics. In 2003, a part-time Secretary-General ([[Paul Flather|Dr Paul Flather]]) was appointed to oversee the overall growth and development of the Europaeum. The Europaeum Office moved from the Central University Offices to rented offices on the Banbury Road, leased from the Oxford [[Voltaire Foundation]], and the organisation became a Charity (Registration Number 1105477) in 2004. Academic mobility was boosted under the Europaeum Visiting Academics scheme enabling leading academics to teach and research at partner institutions within the association, helping nourish future academic and teaching links. Two innovative programmes, an MA in European Politics, Culture, History and Institutions, linking Bologna, Leiden and Oxford, and a plan for modular programmes in European Business, Culture, and Institutions, initially to link Leiden and Oxford, were run as pilot projects.\n\nIn 2003, [[Complutense University of Madrid]] joined the Europaeum. [[Helsinki University]] followed in 2004, and the [[Jagiellonian University]], Krak\u00f3w, in 2005, bringing the association to its target of 10 members.\n\nIn 2004\u20132005, Oxford, Paris and Leiden launched a new jointly-offered Europaeum MA in European History and Civilisation. Three new major themed programmes were launched, each running with linked workshops, seminars, conferences and lectures: the Humanities and New Technology programme in 2003, the Islam-in-Europe programme in 2004, and the US-Europe TransAtlantic Dialogue programme in 2005.\n\nFollowing the death of [[Roy Jenkins]] in 2003, one of the founders of the Europaeum and former Chancellor of the University of Oxford, a memorial fund was set up to raise funds for European scholarships, and these have been directly linked to the Europaeum by the trustees.

{"title_page": "Pulse-width modulation", "text_new": "\n\n{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n\n[[Image:PWM, 3-level.svg|thumb|right|350px|An example of PWM in an idealized inductor driven by a {{colorbull|blue}} voltage source modulated as a series of pulses, resulting in a {{colorbull|red}} sine-like current in the inductor. The rectangular voltage pulses nonetheless result in a more and more smooth current waveform, as the ''switching frequency'' increases.  Note that the current waveform is the integral of the voltage waveform.]]\n\n{{Modulation techniques}}\n\n'''Pulse width modulation''' ('''PWM'''), or '''pulse-duration modulation''' ('''PDM'''), is a method of reducing the average power delivered by an electrical signal, by effectively chopping it up into discrete parts. The average value of [[volt]]age (and [[electric current|current]]) fed to the [[electrical load|load]] is controlled by turning the switch between supply and load on and off at a fast rate. The longer the switch is on compared to the off periods, the higher the total power supplied to the load. Along with MPPT [[maximum power point tracking]], it is one of the primary methods of reducing the output of solar panels to that which can be utilized by a battery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.homepower.com/articles/solar-electricity/design-installation/sizing-grid-tied-pv-system-battery-backup|title=Sizing a Grid-Tied PV System ...with Battery Backup - Home Power Magazine|website=www.homepower.com}}</ref> PWM is particularly suited for running inertial loads such as motors, which are not as easily affected by this discrete switching, because they have inertia to react slow. The PWM switching frequency has to be high enough not to affect the load, which is to say that the resultant waveform perceived by the load must be as smooth as possible. \n\nThe rate (or frequency) at which the power supply must switch can vary greatly depending on load and application. For example, switching has to be done several times a minute in an electric stove; 120&nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] in a lamp dimmer; between a few kilohertz (kHz) and tens of kHz for a motor drive; and well into the tens \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \n# \n* \n* \n# \n*  hundreds of kHz in audio amplifiers and computer power supplies. The main advantage of PWM is that power loss in the switching devices is very low. When a switch is off there is practically no current, and when it is on and power is being transferred to the load, there is almost no voltage drop across the switch. Power loss, being the product of voltage and current, is thus in both cases close to zero. PWM also works well with digital controls, which, because of their on/off nature, can easily set the needed duty cycle. PWM has also been used in certain [[signalling (telecommunication)|communication systems]] where its duty cycle has been used to convey information over a communications channel.\n\n==Duty cycle==\nThe term ''[[duty cycle]]'' describes the proportion of 'on' time to the regular interval or 'period' of time; a low duty cycle corresponds to low power, because the power is off for most of the time. Duty cycle is expressed in percent, 100% being fully on. When a digital signal is on half of the time and off the other half of the time, the digital signal has a duty cycle of 50% and resembles a \"square\" wave. When a digital signal spends more time in the on state than the off state, it has a duty cycle of >50%. When a digital signal spends more time in the off state than the on state, it has a duty cycle of <50%. Here is a pictorial that illustrates these three scenarios:\n[[File:Duty Cycle Examples.png|none|frame]]\n\n==History==\nSome machines (such as a [[sewing machine]] motor) require partial or variable power.  In the past, control (such as in a sewing machine's foot pedal) was implemented by use of a [[rheostat]] connected in series with the motor to adjust the amount of current flowing through the motor.  It was an inefficient scheme, as this also wasted power as heat in the resistor element of the rheostat, but tolerable because the total power was low. While the rheostat was one of several methods of controlling power (see [[autotransformer]]s and [[Variac]] for more info), a low cost and efficient power switching/adjustment method was yet to be found. This mechanism also needed to be able to drive motors for fans, pumps and [[robotics|robotic]] [[Servomechanism|servos]], and needed to be compact enough to interface with lamp dimmers.  PWM emerged as a solution for this complex problem.\n\nOne early application of PWM was in the [[Sinclair Radionics|Sinclair]] X10, a 10&nbsp;W audio amplifier available in kit form in the 1960s. At around the same time PWM started to be used in AC motor control.<ref>{{cite journal  | last =Sch\u00f6nung   | first =A. |author2=Stemmler, H.  | title =Geregelter Drehstrom-Umkehrantrieb mit gesteuertem Umrichter nach dem Unterschwingungsverfahren | journal =BBC Mitteilungen | volume = 51 | issue = 8/9 | pages =555\u2013577 | date =August 1964 }}</ref>\n\nOf note, for about a century, some variable-speed electric motors have had decent efficiency, but they were somewhat more complex than constant-speed motors, and sometimes required bulky external electrical apparatus, such as a bank of variable power resistors or rotating converters such as the [[Ward Leonard control|Ward Leonard drive]].\n\n==Principle==\n[[Image:Duty cycle general.svg|thumb|350px|Fig. 1: a [[pulse wave]], showing the definitions of <math>y_\\text{min}</math>, <math>y_\\text{max}</math> and D.]]\n\nPulse-width modulation uses a [[rectangular wave|rectangular pulse wave]] whose pulse width is modulated resulting in the variation of the [[average]] value of the waveform. If we consider a pulse waveform <math>f(t)</math>, with period <math>T</math>,   low value <math>y_\\text{min}</math>, a high value <math>y_\\text{max}</math> and a [[duty cycle]] D (see figure 1), the average value of the waveform is given by:\n\n:<math>\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{T}\\int^T_0f(t)\\,dt</math>\n\nAs <math>f(t)</math> is a pulse wave, its value is <math>y_\\text{max}</math> for <math>0 < t < D \\cdot T</math> and <math>y_\\text{min}</math> for <math>D \\cdot T < t < T</math>. The above expression then becomes:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\bar{y} &= \\frac{1}{T} \\left(\\int_0^{DT} y_\\text{max}\\,dt + \\int_{DT}^T y_\\text{min}\\,dt\\right)\\\\\n          &= \\frac{1}{T} \\left(D \\cdot T \\cdot y_\\text{max} + T\\left(1 - D\\right) y_\\text{min}\\right)\\\\\n          &= D\\cdot y_\\text{max} + \\left(1 - D\\right) y_\\text{min}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis latter expression can be fairly simplified in many cases where <math>y_\\text{min} = 0</math> as <math>\\bar{y} = D \\cdot y_\\text{max}</math>. From this, the average value of the signal (<math>\\bar{y}</math>) is directly dependent on the duty cycle D.\n\n[[Image:Pwm.svg|thumb|350px|Fig. 2: A simple method to generate the PWM pulse train corresponding to a given signal is the intersective PWM: the signal (here the red sine wave) is compared with a sawtooth waveform (blue). When the latter is less than the former, the PWM signal (magenta) is in high state (1). Otherwise it is in the low state (0).]]\n\nThe simplest way to generate a PWM signal is the intersective method, which requires only a [[Sawtooth wave|sawtooth]] or a [[Triangle wave|triangle]] waveform (easily generated using a simple [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]]) and a [[comparator]]. When the value of the reference signal (the red sine wave in figure 2) is more than the modulation waveform (blue), the PWM signal (magenta) is in the high state, otherwise it is in the low state.\n\n===Delta===\n\n{{Main|Delta modulation}}\n\nIn the use of delta modulation for PWM control, the output signal is integrated, and the result is compared with limits, which correspond to a Reference signal offset by a constant. Every time the integral of the output signal reaches one of the limits, the PWM signal changes state.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Du|first=Ruoyang|last2=Robertson|first2=Paul|date=2017|title=Cost Effective Grid-Connected Inverter for a Micro Combined Heat and Power System|journal=IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics|volume=64|issue=7|pages=5360\u20135367|doi=10.1109/TIE.2017.2677340|issn=0278-0046|url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/263361/1/Cost%20effective%20grid%20connected%20inverter%20for%20microCHP%20system.pdf}}</ref> Figure 3\n[[Image:Delta PWM.svg|thumb|350px|Fig. 3 : Principle of the delta PWM. The output signal (blue) is compared with the limits (green). These limits correspond to the reference signal (red), offset by a given value. Every time the output signal (blue) reaches one of the limits, the PWM signal changes state.]]\n\n===Delta-sigma===\n\n{{Main|Delta-sigma modulation}}\n\nIn delta-sigma modulation as a PWM control method, the output signal is subtracted from a reference signal to form an error signal. This error is integrated, and when the integral of the error exceeds the limits, the output changes state. Figure 4\n[[Image:Sigma-delta PWM.svg|thumb|350px|Fig. 4 : Principle of the sigma-delta PWM. The top green waveform is the reference signal, on which the output signal (PWM, in the bottom plot) is subtracted to form the error signal (blue, in top plot). This error is integrated (middle plot), and when the integral of the error exceeds the limits (red lines), the output changes state.]]\n\n===Space vector modulation===\n\n{{Main|Space vector modulation}}\n\nSpace vector modulation is a PWM control algorithm for multi-phase AC generation, in which the reference signal is sampled regularly; after each sample, non-zero active switching vectors adjacent to the reference vector and one or more of the zero switching vectors are selected for the appropriate fraction of the sampling period in order to synthesize the reference signal as the average of the used vectors.\n\n===Direct torque control (DTC)===\n\n{{Main|Direct torque control}}\n\nDirect torque control is a method used to control AC motors. It is closely related with the delta modulation (see above). Motor torque and magnetic flux are estimated and these are controlled to stay within their hysteresis bands by turning on a new combination of the device's semiconductor switches each time either signal tries to deviate out of its band.\n\n===Time proportioning===\n\nMany digital circuits can generate PWM signals (e.g., many [[microcontrollers]] have PWM outputs). They normally use a [[counter (digital)|counter]] that increments periodically (it is connected directly or indirectly to the [[clock signal|clock]] of the circuit) and is reset at the end of every period of the PWM. When the counter value is more than the reference value, the PWM output changes state from high to low (or low to high).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://barrgroup.com/Embedded-Systems/How-To/PWM-Pulse-Width-Modulation|title=Introduction to Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)|first=Michael|last=Barr|date=1 September 2001|website=Barr Group}}</ref> This technique is referred to as '''time proportioning,''' particularly as '''time-proportioning control'''<ref>''Fundamentals of HVAC Control Systems,'' by Robert McDowall, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UMk1EUp-W-UC&pg=PA21&dq=%22time+proportioning%22 p. 21]</ref> \u2013 which ''proportion'' of a fixed cycle time is spent in the high state.\n\nThe incremented and periodically reset counter is the discrete version of the intersecting method's sawtooth. The analog comparator of the intersecting method becomes a simple integer comparison between the current counter value and the digital (possibly digitized) reference value. The duty cycle can only be varied in discrete steps, as a function of the counter resolution. However, a high-resolution counter can provide quite satisfactory performance.\n\n===Types===\n[[Image:Three PWM types.svg|thumb|350px|Fig. 5 : Three types of PWM signals (blue): leading edge modulation (top), trailing edge modulation (middle) and centered pulses (both edges are modulated, bottom). The green lines are the sawtooth waveform (first and second cases) and a triangle waveform (third case) used to generate the PWM waveforms using the intersective method.]]\n\nThree types of pulse-width modulation (PWM) are possible:\n#The pulse center may be fixed in the center of the time window and both [[signal edge|edges]] of the pulse moved to compress or expand the width.\n#The lead edge can be held at the lead edge of the window and the tail edge modulated.\n#The tail edge can be fixed and the lead edge modulated.\n\n===Spectrum===\nThe resulting [[spectrum|spectra]] (of the three cases) are similar, and each contains a [[Direct current|dc]] component\u2014a base sideband containing the modulating signal and phase modulated [[Carrier signal|carriers]] at each [[harmonic]] of the  frequency of the pulse. The amplitudes of the harmonic groups are restricted by a <math>\\sin x / x</math> envelope ([[sinc function]]) and extend to infinity.\nThe infinite bandwidth is caused by the nonlinear operation of the pulse-width modulator. In consequence, a digital PWM suffers from [[aliasing]] distortion that significantly reduce its applicability for modern [[communications systems|communications system]]. By limiting the bandwidth of the PWM kernel, aliasing effects can be avoided.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hausmair|first=Katharina|author2=Shuli Chi |author3=Peter Singerl |author4=Christian Vogel |title=Aliasing-Free Digital Pulse-Width Modulation for Burst-Mode RF Transmitters|journal=IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers|date=February 2013|volume=60|issue=2|pages=415\u2013427|doi=10.1109/TCSI.2012.2215776|citeseerx=10.1.1.454.9157}}</ref>\n\nOn the contrary, the delta modulation is a random process that produces continuous spectrum without distinct harmonics.\n\n===PWM sampling theorem===\nThe process of PWM conversion is non-linear and it is generally supposed that low pass filter signal recovery is imperfect for PWM. The PWM sampling theorem<ref>J. Huang, K. Padmanabhan, and O. M. Collins, \u201cThe sampling theorem with constant amplitude variable width pulses\u201d, IEEE transactions on Circuits and Systems, vol. 58, pp. 1178 - 1190, June 2011.</ref> shows that PWM conversion can be perfect. The theorem states that \"Any bandlimited baseband signal within \u00b10.637 can be represented by a pulsewidth modulation (PWM) waveform with unit amplitude. The number of pulses in the waveform is equal to the number of Nyquist samples and the peak constraint is independent of whether the waveform is two-level or three-level.\"\n\n\u2022 Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem:<ref>Sampling: What Nyquist Didn\u2019t Say, and What to\nDo About It - Tim Wescott, Wescott Design Services. The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem is useful, but often misused when engineers establish sampling rates or design anti-aliasing filters. This article explains how sampling affects a signal, and how to use this information to design a sampling system with known\nperformance. June 20, 2016 http://www.wescottdesign.com/articles/Sampling/sampling.pdf</ref>\n\u201cIf you have a signal that is perfectly band limited to a bandwidth of f<sub>0</sub> then you can collect all the\ninformation there is in that signal by sampling it at discrete times, as long as your sample\nrate is greater than 2f<sub>0</sub>.\u201d\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Servos===\nPWM is used to control [[servomechanism]]s; see [[servo control]].\n\n===Telecommunications===\nIn [[telecommunications]], PWM  is a form of signal [[modulation#Pulse modulation methods|modulation]] where the widths of the pulses correspond to specific data values encoded at one end and decoded at the other.\n\nPulses of various lengths (the information itself) will be sent at regular intervals (the carrier frequency of the modulation).\n           _      _      _      _      _      _      _      _     \n          | |    | |    | |    | |    | |    | |    | |    | |    \n Clock    | |    | |    | |    | |    | |    | |    | |    | |    \n        __| |____| |____| |____| |____| |____| |____| |____| |____\n \n                  _      __     ____          ____   _\n PWM signal      | |    |  |   |    |        |    | | |\n                 | |    |  |   |    |        |    | | |\n        _________| |____|  |___|    |________|    |_| |___________\n \n Data       0     1       2      4      0      4     1      0\n\nThe inclusion of a [[clock signal]] is not necessary, as the leading edge of the data signal can be used as the clock if a small offset is added to the data value in order to avoid a data value with a zero length pulse.\n                 _      __     ___    _____   _      _____   __     _   \n                | |    |  |   |   |  |     | | |    |     | |  |   | | \n PWM signal     | |    |  |   |   |  |     | | |    |     | |  |   | |  \n              __| |____|  |___|   |__|     |_| |____|     |_|  |___| |_____\n \n Data            0       1      2       4     0        4      1     0\n\n===Power delivery===\nPWM can be used to control the amount of power delivered to a load without incurring the losses that would result from linear power delivery by resistive means. Drawbacks to this technique are that the power drawn by the load is not constant but rather discontinuous (see [[Buck converter]]), and energy delivered to the load is not continuous either.  However, the load may be inductive, and with a sufficiently high frequency and when necessary using additional passive [[electronic filter]]s, the pulse train can be smoothed and average analog waveform recovered.  Power flow into the load can be continuous. Power flow from the supply is not constant and will require energy storage on the supply side in most cases. (In the case of an electrical circuit, a capacitor to absorb energy stored in (often parasitic) supply side inductance.)\n\nHigh [[frequency]] PWM power control systems are easily realisable with semiconductor switches. As explained above, almost no power is dissipated by the switch in either on or off state. However, during the transitions between on and off states, both voltage and current are nonzero and thus power is dissipated in the switches. By quickly changing the state between fully on and fully off (typically less than 100 nanoseconds), the power dissipation in the switches can be quite low compared to the power being delivered to the load.\n\nModern semiconductor switches such as [[MOSFET]]s or [[insulated-gate bipolar transistor]]s (IGBTs) are well suited components for high-efficiency controllers. Frequency converters used to control AC motors may have efficiencies exceeding 98%. Switching power supplies have lower efficiency due to low output voltage levels (often even less than 2 V for microprocessors are needed) but still more than 70\u201380% efficiency can be achieved.\n\nVariable-speed [[computer fan control]]lers usually use PWM, as it is far more efficient when compared to a [[potentiometer]] or [[rheostat]]. (Neither of the latter is practical to operate electronically; they would require a small drive motor.)\n\nLight dimmers for home use employ a specific type of PWM control. Home-use light dimmers typically include electronic circuitry which suppresses current flow during defined portions of each cycle of the AC line voltage. Adjusting the brightness of light emitted by a light source is then merely a matter of setting at what voltage (or phase) in the AC half-cycle the dimmer begins to provide electric current to the light source (e.g. by using an electronic switch such as a [[TRIAC|triac]]). In this case the PWM duty cycle is the ratio of the conduction time to the duration of the half AC cycle defined by the frequency of the AC line voltage (50&nbsp;Hz or 60&nbsp;Hz depending on the country).\n\nThese rather simple types of dimmers can be effectively used with inert (or relatively slow reacting) light sources such as incandescent lamps, for example, for which the additional modulation in supplied electrical energy which is caused by the dimmer causes only negligible additional fluctuations in the emitted light. Some other types of light sources such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), however, turn on and off extremely rapidly and would perceivably flicker if supplied with low frequency drive voltages. Perceivable flicker effects from such rapid response light sources can be reduced by increasing the PWM frequency. If the light fluctuations are sufficiently rapid (faster than the [[flicker fusion threshold]]), the human visual system can no longer resolve them and the eye perceives the time average intensity without flicker.\n\nIn electric cookers, continuously variable power is applied to the heating elements such as the hob or the grill using a device known as a [[energy regulator|simmerstat]]. This consists of a thermal oscillator running at approximately two cycles per minute and the mechanism varies the duty cycle according to the knob setting. The thermal time constant of the heating elements is several minutes, so that the temperature fluctuations are too small to matter in practice.\n\n===Voltage regulation===\n{{Main|Switched-mode power supply}}\n\nPWM is also used in efficient [[voltage regulator]]s. By switching voltage to the load with the appropriate duty cycle, the output will approximate a voltage at the desired level. The switching noise is usually filtered with an [[inductor]] and a [[capacitor]].\n\nOne method measures the output voltage. When it is lower than the desired voltage, it turns on the switch. When the output voltage is above the desired voltage, it turns off the switch.\n\n===Audio effects and amplification===\nPWM is sometimes used in sound (music) synthesis, in particular [[subtractive synthesis]], as it gives a sound effect similar to chorus or slightly detuned oscillators played together. (In fact, PWM is equivalent to the difference of two [[sawtooth wave]]s with one of them inverted.)<ref>[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Mar03/articles/synthsecrets47.asp Synthesizing Strings: PWM & String Sounds]</ref> The ratio between the high and low level is typically modulated with a [[low frequency oscillation|low frequency oscillator]]. In addition, varying the duty cycle of a pulse waveform in a subtractive-synthesis instrument creates useful timbral variations. Some synthesizers have a duty-cycle trimmer for their square-wave outputs, and that trimmer can be set by ear; the 50% point (true square wave) was distinctive, because even-numbered harmonics essentially disappear at 50%. Pulse waves, usually 50%, 25%, and 12.5%, make up the [[Video game music|soundtracks of classic video games]].\n\nA new class of audio amplifiers based on the PWM principle is becoming popular. Called [[class-D amplifier]]s, they produce a PWM equivalent of the analog input signal which is fed to the [[loudspeaker]] via a suitable filter network to block the carrier and recover the original audio. These amplifiers are characterized by very good efficiency figures (\u2265 90%) and compact size/light weight for large power outputs. For a few decades, industrial and military PWM amplifiers have been in common use, often for driving [[Servomotor|servo motors]]. Field-gradient coils in [[MRI]] machines are driven by relatively high-power PWM amplifiers.\n\nHistorically, a crude form of PWM has been used to play back [[PCM]] digital sound on the [[PC speaker]], which is driven by only two voltage levels, typically 0 V and 5 V. By carefully timing the duration of the pulses, and by relying on the speaker's physical filtering properties (limited frequency response, self-inductance, etc.) it was possible to obtain an approximate playback of mono PCM samples, although at a very low quality, and with greatly varying results between implementations.\n\nIn more recent times, the [[Direct Stream Digital]] sound encoding method was introduced, which uses a generalized form of pulse-width modulation called [[pulse density modulation]], at a high enough sampling rate (typically in the order of MHz) to cover the whole [[Acoustics|acoustic]] frequencies range with sufficient fidelity. This method is used in the [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] format, and reproduction of the encoded audio signal is essentially similar to the method used in class-D amplifiers.\n\n===Electrical===\nSPWM (Sine\u2013triangle pulse width modulation) signals are used in micro-inverter design (used in solar and wind power applications). These switching signals are fed to the [[FET]]s that are used in the device. The device's efficiency depends on the harmonic content of the PWM signal. There is much research on eliminating unwanted harmonics and improving the fundamental strength, some of which involves using a modified carrier signal instead of a classic sawtooth signal<ref>Hirak Patangia, Sri Nikhil Gupta Gourisetti, \"A Harmonically Superior Modulator with Wide Baseband and Real-Time Tunability\", IEEE International Symposium on Electronic Design (ISED), India, Dec.11.</ref><ref>Hirak Patangia, Sri Nikhil Gupta Gourisetti, \u201cReal Time Harmonic Elimination Using a Modified Carrier\u201d, CONIELECOMP, Mexico, Feb 2012.</ref><ref>Hirak Patangia, Sri Nikhil Gupta Gourisetti, \u201cA Novel Strategy for Selective Harmonic Elimination Based on a Sine-Sine PWM Model\u201d, MWSCAS, U.S.A, Aug 2012.</ref> in order to decrease power losses and improve efficiency. Another common application is in robotics where PWM signals are used to control the speed of the robot by controlling the motors.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Analog signal to discrete time interval converter]]\n*[[Class-D amplifier]]\n* [[Computer fan control]]\n* [[Delta-sigma modulation]]\n* [[Pulse-amplitude modulation]]\n* [[Pulse-code modulation]]\n* [[Pulse-density modulation]]\n* [[Pulse-position modulation]]\n* [[Radio control]]\n* [[Servomechanism#RC servos|RC servo]]\n* [[Sliding mode control]] - produces smooth behavior by way of discontinuous switching in systems\n* [[Space vector modulation]]\n*[[Sound chip]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n{{Commons category|Pulse width modulation}}\n*[http://www.beis.de/Elektronik/DeltaSigma/DeltaSigma.html An Introduction to Delta Sigma Converters]\n*[http://www.pidlab.com/en/pwm-demo Pulse Width Modulation in PID control loop - free simulator]\n*[http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/articles/pulse_width_modulation.htm Pulse Width Modulation in Desktop monitors - monitor flicker]\n\n[[Category:Signal processing]]\n", "text_old": "\n\n{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n\n[[Image:PWM, 3-level.svg|thumb|right|350px|An example of PWM in an idealized inductor driven by a {{colorbull|blue}} voltage source modulated as a series of pulses, resulting in a {{colorbull|red}} sine-like current in the inductor. The rectangular voltage pulses nonetheless result in a more and more smooth current waveform, as the ''switching frequency'' increases.  Note that the current waveform is the integral of the voltage waveform.]]\n\n{{Modulation techniques}}\n\n'''Pulse width modulation''' ('''PWM'''), or '''pulse-duration modulation''' ('''PDM'''), is a method of reducing the average power delivered by an electrical signal, by effectively chopping it up into discrete parts. The average value of [[volt]]age (and [[electric current|current]]) fed to the [[electrical load|load]] is controlled by turning the switch between supply and load on and off at a fast rate. The longer the switch is on compared to the off periods, the higher the total power supplied to the load. Along with MPPT [[maximum power point tracking]], it is one of the primary methods of reducing the output of solar panels to that which can be utilized by a battery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.homepower.com/articles/solar-electricity/design-installation/sizing-grid-tied-pv-system-battery-backup|title=Sizing a Grid-Tied PV System ...with Battery Backup - Home Power Magazine|website=www.homepower.com}}</ref> PWM is particularly suited for running inertial loads such as motors, which are not as easily affected by this discrete switching, because they have inertia to react slow. The PWM switching frequency has to be high enough not to affect the load, which is to say that the resultant waveform perceived by the load must be as smooth as possible. \n\nThe rate (or frequency) at which the power supply must switch can vary greatly depending on load and application. For example, switching has to be done several times a minute in an electric stove; 120&nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] in a lamp dimmer; between a few kilohertz (kHz) and tens of kHz for a motor drive; and well into the tens or hundreds of kHz in audio amplifiers and computer power supplies. The main advantage of PWM is that power loss in the switching devices is very low. When a switch is off there is practically no current, and when it is on and power is being transferred to the load, there is almost no voltage drop across the switch. Power loss, being the product of voltage and current, is thus in both cases close to zero. PWM also works well with digital controls, which, because of their on/off nature, can easily set the needed duty cycle. PWM has also been used in certain [[signalling (telecommunication)|communication systems]] where its duty cycle has been used to convey information over a communications channel.\n\n==Duty cycle==\nThe term ''[[duty cycle]]'' describes the proportion of 'on' time to the regular interval or 'period' of time; a low duty cycle corresponds to low power, because the power is off for most of the time. Duty cycle is expressed in percent, 100% being fully on. When a digital signal is on half of the time and off the other half of the time, the digital signal has a duty cycle of 50% and resembles a \"square\" wave. When a digital signal spends more time in the on state than the off state, it has a duty cycle of >50%. When a digital signal spends more time in the off state than the on state, it has a duty cycle of <50%. Here is a pictorial that illustrates these three scenarios:\n[[File:Duty Cycle Examples.png|none|frame]]\n\n==History==\nSome machines (such as a [[sewing machine]] motor) require partial or variable power.  In the past, control (such as in a sewing machine's foot pedal) was implemented by use of a [[rheostat]] connected in series with the motor to adjust the amount of current flowing through the motor.  It was an inefficient scheme, as this also wasted power as heat in the resistor element of the rheostat, but tolerable because the total power was low. While the rheostat was one of several methods of controlling power (see [[autotransformer]]s and [[Variac]] for more info), a low cost and efficient power switching/adjustment method was yet to be found. This mechanism also needed to be able to drive motors for fans, pumps and [[robotics|robotic]] [[Servomechanism|servos]], and needed to be compact enough to interface with lamp dimmers.  PWM emerged as a solution for this complex problem.\n\nOne early application of PWM was in the [[Sinclair Radionics|Sinclair]] X10, a 10&nbsp;W audio amplifier available in kit form in the 1960s. At around the same time PWM started to be used in AC motor control.<ref>{{cite journal  | last =Sch\u00f6nung   | first =A. |author2=Stemmler, H.  | title =Geregelter Drehstrom-Umkehrantrieb mit gesteuertem Umrichter nach dem Unterschwingungsverfahren | journal =BBC Mitteilungen | volume = 51 | issue = 8/9 | pages =555\u2013577 | date =August 1964 }}</ref>\n\nOf note, for about a century, some variable-speed electric motors have had decent efficiency, but they were somewhat more complex than constant-speed motors, and sometimes required bulky external electrical apparatus, such as a bank of variable power resistors or rotating converters such as the [[Ward Leonard control|Ward Leonard drive]].\n\n==Principle==\n[[Image:Duty cycle general.svg|thumb|350px|Fig. 1: a [[pulse wave]], showing the definitions of <math>y_\\text{min}</math>, <math>y_\\text{max}</math> and D.]]\n\nPulse-width modulation uses a [[rectangular wave|rectangular pulse wave]] whose pulse width is modulated resulting in the variation of the [[average]] value of the waveform. If we consider a pulse waveform <math>f(t)</math>, with period <math>T</math>,   low value <math>y_\\text{min}</math>, a high value <math>y_\\text{max}</math> and a [[duty cycle]] D (see figure 1), the average value of the waveform is given by:\n\n:<math>\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{T}\\int^T_0f(t)\\,dt</math>\n\nAs <math>f(t)</math> is a pulse wave, its value is <math>y_\\text{max}</math> for <math>0 < t < D \\cdot T</math> and <math>y_\\text{min}</math> for <math>D \\cdot T < t < T</math>. The above expression then becomes:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\bar{y} &= \\frac{1}{T} \\left(\\int_0^{DT} y_\\text{max}\\,dt + \\int_{DT}^T y_\\text{min}\\,dt\\right)\\\\\n          &= \\frac{1}{T} \\left(D \\cdot T \\cdot y_\\text{max} + T\\left(1 - D\\right) y_\\text{min}\\right)\\\\\n          &= D\\cdot y_\\text{max} + \\left(1 - D\\right) y_\\text{min}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis latter expression can be fairly simplified in many cases where <math>y_\\text{min} = 0</math> as <math>\\bar{y} = D \\cdot y_\\text{max}</math>. From this, the average value of the signal (<math>\\bar{y}</math>) is directly dependent on the duty cycle D.\n\n[[Image:Pwm.svg|thumb|350px|Fig. 2: A simple method to generate the PWM pulse train corresponding to a given signal is the intersective PWM: the signal (here the red sine wave) is compared with a sawtooth waveform (blue). When the latter is less than the former, the PWM signal (magenta) is in high state (1). Otherwise it is in the low state (0).]]\n\nThe simplest way to generate a PWM signal is the intersective method, which requires only a [[Sawtooth wave|sawtooth]] or a [[Triangle wave|triangle]] waveform (easily generated using a simple [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]]) and a [[comparator]]. When the value of the reference signal (the red sine wave in figure 2) is more than the modulation waveform (blue), the PWM signal (magenta) is in the high state, otherwise it is in the low state.\n\n===Delta===\n\n{{Main|Delta modulation}}\n\nIn the use of delta modulation for PWM control, the output signal is integrated, and the result is compared with limits, which correspond to a Reference signal offset by a constant.

This error is integrated (middle plot), and when the integral of the error exceeds the limits (red lines), the output changes state.]]\n\n===Space vector modulation===\n\n{{Main|Space vector modulation}}\n\nSpace vector modulation is a PWM control algorithm for multi-phase AC generation, in which the reference signal is sampled regularly; after each sample, non-zero active switching vectors adjacent to the reference vector and one or more of the zero switching vectors are selected for the appropriate fraction of the sampling period in order to synthesize the reference signal as the average of the used vectors.\n\n===Direct torque control (DTC)===\n\n{{Main|Direct torque control}}\n\nDirect torque control is a method used to control AC motors. It is closely related with the delta modulation (see above). Motor torque and magnetic flux are estimated and these are controlled to stay within their hysteresis bands by turning on a new combination of the device's semiconductor switches each time either signal tries to deviate out of its band.\n\n===Time proportioning===\n\nMany digital circuits can generate PWM signals (e.g., many [[microcontrollers]] have PWM outputs). They normally use a [[counter (digital)|counter]] that increments periodically (it is connected directly or indirectly to the [[clock signal|clock]] of the circuit) and is reset at the end of every period of the PWM. When the counter value is more than the reference value, the PWM output changes state from high to low (or low to high).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://barrgroup.com/Embedded-Systems/How-To/PWM-Pulse-Width-Modulation|title=Introduction to Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)|first=Michael|last=Barr|date=1 September 2001|website=Barr Group}}</ref> This technique is referred to as '''time proportioning,''' particularly as '''time-proportioning control'''<ref>''Fundamentals of HVAC Control Systems,'' by Robert McDowall, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UMk1EUp-W-UC&pg=PA21&dq=%22time+proportioning%22 p. 21]</ref> \u2013 which ''proportion'' of a fixed cycle time is spent in the high state.\n\nThe incremented and periodically reset counter is the discrete version of the intersecting method's sawtooth. The analog comparator of the intersecting method becomes a simple integer comparison between the current counter value and the digital (possibly digitized) reference value. The duty cycle can only be varied in discrete steps, as a function of the counter resolution. However, a high-resolution counter can provide quite satisfactory performance.\n\n===Types===\n[[Image:Three PWM types.svg|thumb|350px|Fig. 5 : Three types of PWM signals (blue): leading edge modulation (top), trailing edge modulation (middle) and centered pulses (both edges are modulated, bottom). The green lines are the sawtooth waveform (first and second cases) and a triangle waveform (third case) used to generate the PWM waveforms using the intersective method.]]\n\nThree types of pulse-width modulation (PWM) are possible:\n#The pulse center may be fixed in the center of the time window and both [[signal edge|edges]] of the pulse moved to compress or expand the width.\n#The lead edge can be held at the lead edge of the window and the tail edge modulated.\n#The tail edge can be fixed and the lead edge modulated.\n\n===Spectrum===\nThe resulting [[spectrum|spectra]] (of the three cases) are similar, and each contains a [[Direct current|dc]] component\u2014a base sideband containing the modulating signal and phase modulated [[Carrier signal|carriers]] at each [[harmonic]] of the  frequency of the pulse. The amplitudes of the harmonic groups are restricted by a <math>\\sin x / x</math> envelope ([[sinc function]]) and extend to infinity.\nThe infinite bandwidth is caused by the nonlinear operation of the pulse-width modulator. In consequence, a digital PWM suffers from [[aliasing]] distortion that significantly reduce its applicability for modern [[communications systems|communications system]]. By limiting the bandwidth of the PWM kernel, aliasing effects can be avoided.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hausmair|first=Katharina|author2=Shuli Chi |author3=Peter Singerl |author4=Christian Vogel |title=Aliasing-Free Digital Pulse-Width Modulation for Burst-Mode RF Transmitters|journal=IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers|date=February 2013|volume=60|issue=2|pages=415\u2013427|doi=10.1109/TCSI.2012.2215776|citeseerx=10.1.1.454.9157}}</ref>\n\nOn the contrary, the delta modulation is a random process that produces continuous spectrum without distinct harmonics.\n\n===PWM sampling theorem===\nThe process of PWM conversion is non-linear and it is generally supposed that low pass filter signal recovery is imperfect for PWM.

Drawbacks to this technique are that the power drawn by the load is not constant but rather discontinuous (see [[Buck converter]]), and energy delivered to the load is not continuous either.  However, the load may be inductive, and with a sufficiently high frequency and when necessary using additional passive [[electronic filter]]s, the pulse train can be smoothed and average analog waveform recovered.  Power flow into the load can be continuous. Power flow from the supply is not constant and will require energy storage on the supply side in most cases. (In the case of an electrical circuit, a capacitor to absorb energy stored in (often parasitic) supply side inductance.)\n\nHigh [[frequency]] PWM power control systems are easily realisable with semiconductor switches. As explained above, almost no power is dissipated by the switch in either on or off state. However, during the transitions between on and off states, both voltage and current are nonzero and thus power is dissipated in the switches. By quickly changing the state between fully on and fully off (typically less than 100 nanoseconds), the power dissipation in the switches can be quite low compared to the power being delivered to the load.\n\nModern semiconductor switches such as [[MOSFET]]s or [[insulated-gate bipolar transistor]]s (IGBTs) are well suited components for high-efficiency controllers. Frequency converters used to control AC motors may have efficiencies exceeding 98%. Switching power supplies have lower efficiency due to low output voltage levels (often even less than 2 V for microprocessors are needed) but still more than 70\u201380% efficiency can be achieved.\n\nVariable-speed [[computer fan control]]lers usually use PWM, as it is far more efficient when compared to a [[potentiometer]] or [[rheostat]]. (Neither of the latter is practical to operate electronically; they would require a small drive motor.)\n\nLight dimmers for home use employ a specific type of PWM control. Home-use light dimmers typically include electronic circuitry which suppresses current flow during defined portions of each cycle of the AC line voltage. Adjusting the brightness of light emitted by a light source is then merely a matter of setting at what voltage (or phase) in the AC half-cycle the dimmer begins to provide electric current to the light source (e.g. by using an electronic switch such as a [[TRIAC|triac]]). In this case the PWM duty cycle is the ratio of the conduction time to the duration of the half AC cycle defined by the frequency of the AC line voltage (50&nbsp;Hz or 60&nbsp;Hz depending on the country).\n\nThese rather simple types of dimmers can be effectively used with inert (or relatively slow reacting) light sources such as incandescent lamps, for example, for which the additional modulation in supplied electrical energy which is caused by the dimmer causes only negligible additional fluctuations in the emitted light. Some other types of light sources such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), however, turn on and off extremely rapidly and would perceivably flicker if supplied with low frequency drive voltages. Perceivable flicker effects from such rapid response light sources can be reduced by increasing the PWM frequency. If the light fluctuations are sufficiently rapid (faster than the [[flicker fusion threshold]]), the human visual system can no longer resolve them and the eye perceives the time average intensity without flicker.\n\nIn electric cookers, continuously variable power is applied to the heating elements such as the hob or the grill using a device known as a [[energy regulator|simmerstat]]. This consists of a thermal oscillator running at approximately two cycles per minute and the mechanism varies the duty cycle according to the knob setting. The thermal time constant of the heating elements is several minutes, so that the temperature fluctuations are too small to matter in practice.\n\n===Voltage regulation===\n{{Main|Switched-mode power supply}}\n\nPWM is also used in efficient [[voltage regulator]]s. By switching voltage to the load with the appropriate duty cycle, the output will approximate a voltage at the desired level. The switching noise is usually filtered with an [[inductor]] and a [[capacitor]].\n\nOne method measures the output voltage. When it is lower than the desired voltage, it turns on the switch. When the output voltage is above the desired voltage, it turns off the switch.\n\n===Audio effects and amplification===\nPWM is sometimes used in sound (music) synthesis, in particular [[subtractive synthesis]], as it gives a sound effect similar to chorus or slightly detuned oscillators played together. (In fact, PWM is equivalent to the difference of two [[sawtooth wave]]s with one of them inverted.)<ref>[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/Mar03/articles/synthsecrets47.asp Synthesizing Strings: PWM & String Sounds]</ref> The ratio between the high and low level is typically modulated with a [[low frequency oscillation|low frequency oscillator]]. In addition, varying the duty cycle of a pulse waveform in a subtractive-synthesis instrument creates useful timbral variations. Some synthesizers have a duty-cycle trimmer for their square-wave outputs, and that trimmer can be set by ear; the 50% point (true square wave) was distinctive, because even-numbered harmonics essentially disappear at 50%. Pulse waves, usually 50%, 25%, and 12.5%, make up the [[Video game music|soundtracks of classic video games]].\n\nA new class of audio amplifiers based on the PWM principle is becoming popular. Called [[class-D amplifier]]s, they produce a PWM equivalent of the analog input signal which is fed to the [[loudspeaker]] via a suitable filter network to block the carrier and recover the original audio. These amplifiers are characterized by very good efficiency figures (\u2265 90%) and compact size/light weight for large power outputs. For a few decades, industrial and military PWM amplifiers have been in common use, often for driving [[Servomotor|servo motors]]. Field-gradient coils in [[MRI]] machines are driven by relatively high-power PWM amplifiers.\n\nHistorically, a crude form of PWM has been used to play back [[PCM]] digital sound on the [[PC speaker]], which is driven by only two voltage levels, typically 0 V and 5 V. By carefully timing the duration of the pulses, and by relying on the speaker's physical filtering properties (limited frequency response, self-inductance, etc.) it was possible to obtain an approximate playback of mono PCM samples, although at a very low quality, and with greatly varying results between implementations.\n\nIn more recent times, the [[Direct Stream Digital]] sound encoding method was introduced, which uses a generalized form of pulse-width modulation called [[pulse density modulation]], at a high enough sampling rate (typically in the order of MHz) to cover the whole [[Acoustics|acoustic]] frequencies range with sufficient fidelity. This method is used in the [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] format, and reproduction of the encoded audio signal is essentially similar to the method used in class-D amplifiers.\n\n===Electrical===\nSPWM (Sine\u2013triangle pulse width modulation) signals are used in micro-inverter design (used in solar and wind power applications). These switching signals are fed to the [[FET]]s that are used in the device. The device's efficiency depends on the harmonic content of the PWM signal. There is much research on eliminating unwanted harmonics and improving the fundamental strength, some of which involves using a modified carrier signal instead of a classic sawtooth signal<ref>Hirak Patangia, Sri Nikhil Gupta Gourisetti, \"A Harmonically Superior Modulator with Wide Baseband and Real-Time Tunability\", IEEE International Symposium on Electronic Design (ISED), India, Dec.11.</ref><ref>Hirak Patangia, Sri Nikhil Gupta Gourisetti, \u201cReal Time Harmonic Elimination Using a Modified Carrier\u201d, CONIELECOMP, Mexico, Feb 2012.</ref><ref>Hirak Patangia, Sri Nikhil Gupta Gourisetti, \u201cA Novel Strategy for Selective Harmonic Elimination Based on a Sine-Sine PWM Model\u201d, MWSCAS, U.S.A, Aug 2012.</ref> in order to decrease power losses and improve efficiency. Another common application is in robotics where PWM signals are used to control the speed of the robot by controlling the motors.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Analog signal to discrete time interval converter]]\n*[[Class-D amplifier]]\n* [[Computer fan control]]\n* [[Delta-sigma modulation]]\n* [[Pulse-amplitude modulation]]\n* [[Pulse-code modulation]]\n* [[Pulse-density modulation]]\n* [[Pulse-position modulation]]\n* [[Radio control]]\n* [[Servomechanism#RC servos|RC servo]]\n* [[Sliding mode control]] - produces smooth behavior by way of discontinuous switching in systems\n* [[Space vector modulation]]\n*[[Sound chip]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n{{Commons category|Pulse width modulation}}\n*[http://www.beis.de/Elektronik/DeltaSigma/DeltaSigma.html An Introduction to Delta Sigma Converters]\n*[http://www.pidlab.com/en/pwm-demo Pulse Width Modulation in PID control loop - free simulator]\n*[http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/articles/pulse_width_modulation.htm Pulse Width Modulation in Desktop monitors - monitor flicker]\n\n[[Category:Signal processing]]\n", "name_user": "Fatih110", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation"}

After a family friend gave the Jacksons a [[Super 8&nbsp;mm film|Super 8]] cine-camera with Peter in mind, he began making short films with his friends. Jackson has long cited ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' as his favourite film, and around the age of nine he attempted to remake it using his own stop-motion models.<ref>{{cite web|author=Paul Fischer |url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/interviews/623/peter-jackson-for-king-kong- |title=Interview: Peter Jackson on ''King Kong'' |work=Gorilla Nation |date=5 December 2005 |accessdate=27 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714055902/http://www.darkhorizons.com/interviews/623/peter-jackson-for-king-kong-|url-status=dead |archive-date=14 July 2009}}</ref> Also, as a child Jackson made a WWII epic called \"The Dwarf Patrol\" seen on the Bad Taste bonus disc which featured his first special effect of poking pinholes in the film for gun shots, and a [[James Bond]] spoof named ''Coldfinger''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2009/12/salute-your-shorts-peter-jacksons-forgotten-silver.html|title=Salute Your Shorts: Peter Jackson's \"Forgotten Silver\"|publisher=Paste Magazine|date=11 December 2009|first=Sean|last=Gandert|accessdate=26 May 2010}}</ref> Most notable though was a 20-minute [[short film|short]] called ''[[The Valley (1976 film)|The Valley]]'', which won him a special prize because of the shots he used.\n\nIn school, Jackson expressed no interest in sports. His classmates also remember him wearing a [[duffle coat]] with \"an obsession verging on religious\". He had no formal training in film-making, but learned about editing, special effects and make-up largely through his own trial and error. As a young adult, Jackson discovered the work of author [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] after watching ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1978), an animated film by [[Ralph Bakshi]] that was a part-adaptation of Tolkien's fantasy trilogy.<ref name=\"NZ_Herald_10408133\">{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/movies/news/article.cfm?c_id=200&objectid=10408133&pnum=0|title=Peter Jackson's trip from splatstick to RAF|author=Baillie, Russell|date=29 October 2006|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=2 November 2011}}</ref> When he was 16 years old, Jackson left school and began working full-time as a [[photoengraving|photo-engraver]] for a Wellington newspaper, ''The Evening Post''. For the seven years he worked there, Jackson lived at home with his parents so he could save as much money as possible to spend on film equipment. After two years of work Jackson bought a [[16 mm film|16 mm]] [[camera]], and began shooting a film that later became ''[[Bad Taste]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Peter Jackson Biography and Interview |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|date= 3 June 2006|url=https://www.achievement.org/achiever/sir-peter-jackson/#interview\n}}</ref>\n\n== Influences and inspirations ==\nJackson has long cited several films as influences. It is well known that Jackson has a passion for ''King Kong'', often citing it as his favourite film and as the film that inspired him early in his life. Jackson recalls attempting to remake ''King Kong'' when he was nine. At the 2009 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], while being interviewed alongside ''Avatar'' and ''Titanic'' director [[James Cameron]], Jackson said certain films gave him a \"kick\". He mentioned [[Martin Scorsese]]'s crime films ''[[Goodfellas]]'' and ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]'', remarking on \"something about those particular movies and the way Martin Scorsese just fearlessly rockets his camera around and has shot those films that I can watch those movies and feel inspired.\"<ref name=\"PJI\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ospb1YaFMg|title=Peter Jackson Inspiration|via=Youtube|accessdate=2 February 2013}}</ref> Jackson  said the 1970 film [[Waterloo (1970 film)|''Waterloo'']] inspired him in his youth.<ref name=\"PJI2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsDHxbLR6fE|title=Peter Jackson Inspiration 2|via=Youtube |accessdate=2 February 2013}}</ref> Other influences include [[George Romero]], [[Sam Raimi]] and the special effects by [[Ray Harryhausen]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/txt/s1529210.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911063435/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/txt/s1529210.htm |archivedate=11 September 2014  }}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Splatter phase ===\nJackson's first feature was ''[[Bad Taste]]'', a haphazard fashion  [[splatter film|splatter]] comedy which took years to make, it included many of Jackson's friends acting and working on it for free. Shooting was normally done in the weekends since Jackson was then working full-time. ''Bad Taste'' is about aliens that come to earth with the intention of turning humans into food. Jackson had two acting roles including a famous scene in which he fights himself on top of a cliff. The film was finally completed thanks to a late injection of finance from the [[New Zealand Film Commission]], after [[Jim Booth]], the body's executive director, became convinced of Jackson's talent (Booth later left the Commission to become Jackson's producer). In May 1987, ''Bad Taste'' was unveiled at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], where rights to the film quickly sold to twelve countries.<ref>[http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/jac0int-6 \"Lord of the cinema\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016065003/http://achievement.org/autodoc/page/jac0int-6 |date=16 October 2011 }}, achievement.org</ref>\n\nAround this time, Jackson began working on writing a number of film scripts, in varied collaborative groupings with playwright Stephen Sinclair, writer [[Fran Walsh]] and writer/actor [[Danny Mulheron]]. Walsh would later become his life partner.<ref name=\"barnes\" /> Some of the scripts from this period, including a sequel to ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', have never been made into movies; the proposed [[zombie]] film ''[[Braindead (film)|Braindead]]'' underwent extensive rewrites.<ref name=\"barnes\" />\n\nJackson's next film to see release was ''[[Meet the Feebles]]'' (1989), co-written with Sinclair, Walsh and Mulheron. An ensemble musical comedy starring [[The Muppets|Muppet]]-style puppets, ''Meet the Feebles'' originally began as a short film intended for television, but was rapidly expanded into a full-length film after unanticipated enthusiasm from Japanese investors, and the collapse of ''Braindead'', six weeks before filming. Begun on a very low budget, ''Meet the Feebles'' went weeks over schedule. Jackson stated of his second feature-length film, \"It's got a quality of humour that alienates a lot of people.. It's very black, very satirical, very savage.\"<ref>Ian Pryor, \"Meet the Feebles\", ''Evening Post'', 24 August 1989, p. 25.</ref> ''Feebles'' marked Jackson's first collaboration with special effects team [[Richard Taylor (filmmaker)|Richard Taylor]] and Tania Rodger, who would later work on all Jackson's movies. Jackson's next release was the horror comedy ''[[Braindead (film)|Braindead]]'' (1992) (released in North America as ''Dead Alive'').<ref>{{cite web|last=Rosenbaum |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/dead-alive/Film?oid=1052307 |title=Dead Alive |work=Chicago Reader |date= |accessdate=3 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Heavenly Creatures'' and ''Forgotten Silver'' ===\nReleased in 1994 after Jackson won a race to bring the story to the screen, ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'' marked a major change for Jackson in terms of both style and tone. The film is based on the real [[Parker\u2013Hulme murder case]] in which two teenage girls in 1950s [[Christchurch]] became close friends and later murdered the mother of one of the girls. It was [[Fran Walsh]] that persuaded him that these events had the makings of a movie;<ref>{{cite book|last=Pryor|first=Ian|title=Peter Jackson: From Prince of Splatter to Lord of the Rings|url={{Google books|Sb5ZAwAAQBAJ|page=466|plainurl=yes}}|page=466}}</ref> Jackson has been quoted saying that the film \"only got made\" because of her enthusiasm for the subject matter.<ref name=Webster96>Webster, Andy (1996). \"The Frightener\" [Cover: \"The Twisted Genius Behind 'The Frighteners{{'\"}}], ''Premiere'' (magazine, U.S.; discontinued), August, pp. 33\u201337, esp. p. 26.

Jackson hired actresses [[Melanie Lynskey]] and [[Kate Winslet]] in the roles of Parker and Hulme. ''Heavenly Creatures'' received considerable critical acclaim, including an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Best Original Screenplay]] and making top ten of the year lists in ''Time'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', and ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]''. The success of ''Heavenly Creatures'' won Jackson attention from US company [[Miramax]], who promoted the film vigorously in America and signed the director to a [[first-look deal]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Kristin|title=The Frodo Franchise: The Lord of the Rings and Modern Hollywood|url={{Google books|1odPDYvGBygC|page=22|plainurl=yes}}|page=22}}</ref>\n\nThe following year, in collaboration with Wellington film-maker Costa Botes, Jackson co-directed the [[mockumentary]] ''[[Forgotten Silver]]'' (1995). This ambitious made-for-television piece told the story of New Zealand film pioneer [[Forgotten Silver|Colin McKenzie]], who had supposedly invented colour film and 'talkies', and attempted an epic film of ''[[Salome]]'' before being forgotten by the world. Though the programme played in a slot normally reserved for drama, no other warning was given that it was fictionalised and many viewers were outraged at discovering Colin McKenzie had never existed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/?p=596|title=Observations on film art and ''Film Art''|publisher=David Bordwell|accessdate=27 March 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Craig|last=Hight|url=http://www.waikato.ac.nz/film/mock-doc/fs.shtml|title=Forgotten Silver|work=Mock-documentary: the subversion of factuality|publisher=Screen and Media Studies Department, University of Waikato, New Zealand|accessdate=27 March 2007}} Derived from {{cite book|last=Roscoe|first=Jane|author2=Craig Hight|title=Faking It: Mock-documentary and the subversion of factuality|url=http://www.waikato.ac.nz/film/mock-doc/book.shtml|year=2001|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester, UK|isbn=0-7190-5641-1}}</ref> The number of people who believed the increasingly improbable story provides testimony to Jackson and Botes' skill at playing on New Zealand's [[national myth]] of a nation of innovators and forgotten trail-blazers.<ref>Geoff Chapple, 'Gone, not forgotten', ''New Zealand Listener'', 25 November 1995, p.26.</ref>\n\n=== Hollywood, Weta, and the Film Commission ===\nThe success of ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'' helped pave the way for Jackson's first big budget Hollywood film, ''[[The Frighteners]]'' starring [[Michael J. Fox]], in 1996. Jackson was given permission to make this comedy/horror film entirely in New Zealand despite being set in a North American town. This period was a key one of change for both Jackson and [[Weta Workshop]], the special effects company\u2014born from the one-man contributions of George Port to ''Heavenly Creatures''\u2014with which Jackson is often associated. Weta, initiated by Jackson and key collaborators, grew rapidly during this period to incorporate both digital and physical effects, make-up and costumes, the first two areas normally commanded by Jackson collaborator Richard Taylor.<ref>{{cite book|last=Leotta|first=Alfio|title=Peter Jackson|url={{Google books|Gua2CgAAQBAJ|page=229|plainurl=yes}}|page=229}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wetaworkshop.com/about-us/history/ |title=The History of Weta Workshop |website=wetaworkshop.com |accessdate=24 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n''The Frighteners'' was regarded as a box office failure.<ref>{{cite book|authorlink1=Yvonne Tasker|last=Tasker|first=Yvonne|title=Fifty Contemporary Film Directors|url={{Google books|9IxaBwAAQBAJ|page=202|plainurl=yes}}|page=202}}</ref> Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] expressed disappointment stating that \"incredible effort has resulted in a film that looks more like a demo reel than a movie\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Roger Ebert |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-frighteners-1996 |title=The Frighteners|website=rogerebert.com |date=19 July 1996 |accessdate=24 March 2016}}</ref> In February 1997, Jackson launched legal proceedings against the ''[[New Zealand Listener]]'' magazine for [[defamation]], over a review of ''The Frighteners'' which claimed that the film was \"built from the rubble of other people's movies\".<ref>Philip Matthews, \"Spectral Steel\", ''New Zealand Listener'', 14 December 1996</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Heal |first=Andrew |date=December 1997 |title=Horror Story |location=New Zealand |magazine=Metro| page=198 }}</ref> In the end, the case was not pursued further. Around this time Jackson's remake of ''King Kong'' was shelved by [[Universal Studios]], partly because of ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1998 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]'' and ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'', both giant monster movies, that had already gone into production. Universal feared it would be thrown aside by the two higher budget movies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Morton|first=Ray|title=King Kong: The History of a Movie Icon from Fay Wray to Peter Jackson|url={{Google books|UPXbsJLVgCcC|page=168|plainurl=yes}}|page=168}}</ref>\n\nThis period of transition seems not to have been entirely a happy one; it also marked one of the high points of tension between Jackson and the [[New Zealand Film Commission]] since ''Meet the Feebles'' had gone over-budget earlier in his career. Jackson has claimed the Commission considered firing him from ''Feebles'', though the NZFC went on to help fund his next three films. In 1997, the director submitted a lengthy criticism of the Commission for a magazine supplement meant to celebrate the body's 20th anniversary, criticising what he called inconsistent decision-making by inexperienced board members. The magazine felt that the material was too long and potentially defamatory to publish in that form; a shortened version of the material went on to appear in ''[[Metro (magazine)|Metro]]'' magazine.<ref>Andrew Heal, \"Horror Story\", ''Metro'', December 1997.{{full citation needed|date=October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/nznews/peter-jackson-to-head-film-commission-review-2009061910#axzz43puojiSk |title=Peter Jackson to head Film Commission review |website=newshub.co.nz |date=19 June 2009 |accessdate=24 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=John Drinnan |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=10687006 |title=Media: ASB Bank begins life after Goldstein |website=nzherald.co.nz |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=24 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Pryor|first=Ian|title=Peter Jackson: From Prince of Splatter to Lord of the Rings|url={{Google books|Sb5ZAwAAQBAJ|page=231|plainurl=yes}}|page=321}}</ref> In the ''Metro'' article Jackson criticized the Commission over funding decisions concerning a film he was hoping to executive produce, but refused to drop a client-confidentiality clause that allowed them to publicly reply to his criticisms.\n\n=== ''The Lord of the Rings'' ===\n{{Main|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\n[[File:Peter Jackson01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jackson in 2003, at the premiere of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' in [[Wellington]]]]\nJackson won the rights to film Tolkien's epic in 1997 after meeting with producer [[Saul Zaentz]].

director ===\nSince 1994's ''Heavenly Creatures'' Peter Jackson's films have enjoyed success in the annual awards season, earning many nominations and winning several awards; ''The Frighteners'' being his only fictional directed effort since 1994 not to be nominated for an [[Academy Award]]. The ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy is one of the most successful trilogies of all time in terms of awards, winning more [[Academy Awards]] than the [[Francis Ford Coppola]] directed ''[[Godfather Trilogy]]'', with 2003's ''The Return of the King'' winning in all 11 categories for which it was nominated including Best Picture, Director and Adapted Screenplay. Jackson's films have fared extremely well in the technical categories as well as the major categories; all three ''Lord of the Rings'' pictures as well as ''King Kong'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] in their respective years. In total Jackson's directed efforts have been the most awarded films at three separate Academy Award ceremonies, the 74th, 76th and 78th.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Film\n!

After a family friend gave the Jacksons a [[Super 8&nbsp;mm film|Super 8]] cine-camera with Peter in mind, he began making short films with his friends. Jackson has long cited ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' as his favourite film, and around the age of nine he attempted to remake it using his own stop-motion models.<ref>{{cite web|author=Paul Fischer |url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/interviews/623/peter-jackson-for-king-kong- |title=Interview: Peter Jackson on ''King Kong'' |work=Gorilla Nation |date=5 December 2005 |accessdate=27 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714055902/http://www.darkhorizons.com/interviews/623/peter-jackson-for-king-kong-|url-status=dead |archive-date=14 July 2009}}</ref> Also, as a child Jackson made a WWII epic called \"The Dwarf Patrol\" seen on the Bad Taste bonus disc which featured his first special effect of poking pinholes in the film for gun shots, and a [[James Bond]] spoof named ''Coldfinger''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2009/12/salute-your-shorts-peter-jacksons-forgotten-silver.html|title=Salute Your Shorts: Peter Jackson's \"Forgotten Silver\"|publisher=Paste Magazine|date=11 December 2009|first=Sean|last=Gandert|accessdate=26 May 2010}}</ref> Most notable though was a 20-minute [[short film|short]] called ''[[The Valley (1976 film)|The Valley]]'', which won him a special prize because of the shots he used.\n\nIn school, Jackson expressed no interest in sports. His classmates also remember him wearing a [[duffle coat]] with \"an obsession verging on religious\". He had no formal training in film-making, but learned about editing, special effects and make-up largely through his own trial and error. As a young adult, Jackson discovered the work of author [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] after watching ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1978), an animated film by [[Ralph Bakshi]] that was a part-adaptation of Tolkien's fantasy trilogy.<ref name=\"NZ_Herald_10408133\">{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/movies/news/article.cfm?c_id=200&objectid=10408133&pnum=0|title=Peter Jackson's trip from splatstick to RAF|author=Baillie, Russell|date=29 October 2006|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=2 November 2011}}</ref> When he was 16 years old, Jackson left school and began working full-time as a [[photoengraving|photo-engraver]] for a Wellington newspaper, ''The Evening Post''. For the seven years he worked there, Jackson lived at home with his parents so he could save as much money as possible to spend on film equipment. After two years of work Jackson bought a [[16 mm film|16 mm]] [[camera]], and began shooting a film that later became ''[[Bad Taste]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Peter Jackson Biography and Interview |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|date= 3 June 2006|url=https://www.achievement.org/achiever/sir-peter-jackson/#interview\n}}</ref>\n\n== Influences and inspirations ==\nJackson has long cited several films as influences. It is well known that Jackson has a passion for ''King Kong'', often citing it as his favourite film and as the film that inspired him early in his life. Jackson recalls attempting to remake ''King Kong'' when he was nine. At the 2009 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], while being interviewed alongside ''Avatar'' and ''Titanic'' director [[James Cameron]], Jackson said certain films gave him a \"kick\". He mentioned [[Martin Scorsese]]'s crime films ''[[Goodfellas]]'' and ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]'', remarking on \"something about those particular movies and the way Martin Scorsese just fearlessly rockets his camera around and has shot those films that I can watch those movies and feel inspired.\"<ref name=\"PJI\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ospb1YaFMg|title=Peter Jackson Inspiration|via=Youtube|accessdate=2 February 2013}}</ref> Jackson  said the 1970 film [[Waterloo (1970 film)|''Waterloo'']] inspired him in his youth.<ref name=\"PJI2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsDHxbLR6fE|title=Peter Jackson Inspiration 2|via=Youtube |accessdate=2 February 2013}}</ref> Other influences include [[George Romero]], [[Sam Raimi]] and the special effects by [[Ray Harryhausen]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/txt/s1529210.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911063435/http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/txt/s1529210.htm |archivedate=11 September 2014  }}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Splatter phase ===\nJackson's first feature was ''[[Bad Taste]]'', a haphazard fashion  [[splatter film|splatter]] comedy which took years to make, it included many of Jackson's friends acting and working on it for free. Shooting was normally done in the weekends since Jackson was then working full-time. ''Bad Taste'' is about aliens that come to earth with the intention of turning humans into food. Jackson had two acting roles including a famous scene in which he fights himself on top of a cliff. The film was finally completed thanks to a late injection of finance from the [[New Zealand Film Commission]], after [[Jim Booth]], the body's executive director, became convinced of Jackson's talent (Booth later left the Commission to become Jackson's producer). In May 1987, ''Bad Taste'' was unveiled at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], where rights to the film quickly sold to twelve countries.<ref>[http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/jac0int-6 \"Lord of the cinema\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016065003/http://achievement.org/autodoc/page/jac0int-6 |date=16 October 2011 }}, achievement.org</ref>\n\nAround this time, Jackson began working on writing a number of film scripts, in varied collaborative groupings with playwright Stephen Sinclair, writer [[Fran Walsh]] and writer/actor [[Danny Mulheron]]. Walsh would later become his life partner.<ref name=\"barnes\" /> Some of the scripts from this period, including a sequel to ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', have never been made into movies; the proposed [[zombie]] film ''[[Braindead (film)|Braindead]]'' underwent extensive rewrites.<ref name=\"barnes\" />\n\nJackson's next film to see release was ''[[Meet the Feebles]]'' (1989), co-written with Sinclair, Walsh and Mulheron. An ensemble musical comedy starring [[The Muppets|Muppet]]-style puppets, ''Meet the Feebles'' originally began as a short film intended for television, but was rapidly expanded into a full-length film after unanticipated enthusiasm from Japanese investors, and the collapse of ''Braindead'', six weeks before filming. Begun on a very low budget, ''Meet the Feebles'' went weeks over schedule. Jackson stated of his second feature-length film, \"It's got a quality of humour that alienates a lot of people.. It's very black, very satirical, very savage.\"<ref>Ian Pryor, \"Meet the Feebles\", ''Evening Post'', 24 August 1989, p. 25.</ref> ''Feebles'' marked Jackson's first collaboration with special effects team [[Richard Taylor (filmmaker)|Richard Taylor]] and Tania Rodger, who would later work on all Jackson's movies. Jackson's next release was the horror comedy ''[[Braindead (film)|Braindead]]'' (1992) (released in North America as ''Dead Alive'').<ref>{{cite web|last=Rosenbaum |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/dead-alive/Film?oid=1052307 |title=Dead Alive |work=Chicago Reader |date= |accessdate=3 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Heavenly Creatures'' and ''Forgotten Silver'' ===\nReleased in 1994 after Jackson won a race to bring the story to the screen, ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'' marked a major change for Jackson in terms of both style and tone. The film is based on the real [[Parker\u2013Hulme murder case]] in which two teenage girls in 1950s [[Christchurch]] became close friends and later murdered the mother of one of the girls. It was [[Fran Walsh]] that persuaded him that these events had the makings of a movie;<ref>{{cite book|last=Pryor|first=Ian|title=Peter Jackson: From Prince of Splatter to Lord of the Rings|url={{Google books|Sb5ZAwAAQBAJ|page=466|plainurl=yes}}|page=466}}</ref> Jackson has been quoted saying that the film \"only got made\" because of her enthusiasm for the subject matter.<ref name=Webster96>Webster, Andy (1996). \"The Frightener\" [Cover: \"The Twisted Genius Behind 'The Frighteners{{'\"}}], ''Premiere'' (magazine, U.S.; discontinued), August, pp. 33\u201337, esp. p. 26. No online archive of magazine or article available (October 2015).</ref> The film's fame coincided with the New Zealand media tracking down the real-life Juliet Hulme, who now writes books under the name [[Anne Perry]]. Jackson hired actresses [[Melanie Lynskey]] and [[Kate Winslet]] in the roles of Parker and Hulme. ''Heavenly Creatures'' received considerable critical acclaim, including an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Best Original Screenplay]] and making top ten of the year lists in ''Time'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', and ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]''. The success of ''Heavenly Creatures'' won Jackson attention from US company [[Miramax]], who promoted the film vigorously in America and signed the director to a [[first-look deal]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Kristin|title=The Frodo Franchise: The Lord of the Rings and Modern Hollywood|url={{Google books|1odPDYvGBygC|page=22|plainurl=yes}}|page=22}}</ref>\n\nThe following year, in collaboration with Wellington film-maker Costa Botes, Jackson co-directed the [[mockumentary]] ''[[Forgotten Silver]]'' (1995). This ambitious made-for-television piece told the story of New Zealand film pioneer [[Forgotten Silver|Colin McKenzie]], who had supposedly invented colour film and 'talkies', and attempted an epic film of ''[[Salome]]'' before being forgotten by the world. Though the programme played in a slot normally reserved for drama, no other warning was given that it was fictionalised and many viewers were outraged at discovering Colin McKenzie had never existed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/?p=596|title=Observations on film art and ''Film Art''|publisher=David Bordwell|accessdate=27 March 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Craig|last=Hight|url=http://www.waikato.ac.nz/film/mock-doc/fs.shtml|title=Forgotten Silver|work=Mock-documentary: the subversion of factuality|publisher=Screen and Media Studies Department, University of Waikato, New Zealand|accessdate=27 March 2007}} Derived from {{cite book|last=Roscoe|first=Jane|author2=Craig Hight|title=Faking It: Mock-documentary and the subversion of factuality|url=http://www.waikato.ac.nz/film/mock-doc/book.shtml|year=2001|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester, UK|isbn=0-7190-5641-1}}</ref> The number of people who believed the increasingly improbable story provides testimony to Jackson and Botes' skill at playing on New Zealand's [[national myth]] of a nation of innovators and forgotten trail-blazers.<ref>Geoff Chapple, 'Gone, not forgotten', ''New Zealand Listener'', 25 November 1995, p.26.</ref>\n\n=== Hollywood, Weta, and the Film Commission ===\nThe success of ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'' helped pave the way for Jackson's first big budget Hollywood film, ''[[The Frighteners]]'' starring [[Michael J. Fox]], in 1996. Jackson was given permission to make this comedy/horror film entirely in New Zealand despite being set in a North American town. This period was a key one of change for both Jackson and [[Weta Workshop]], the special effects company\u2014born from the one-man contributions of George Port to ''Heavenly Creatures''\u2014with which Jackson is often associated. Weta, initiated by Jackson and key collaborators, grew rapidly during this period to incorporate both digital and physical effects, make-up and costumes, the first two areas normally commanded by Jackson collaborator Richard Taylor.<ref>{{cite book|last=Leotta|first=Alfio|title=Peter Jackson|url={{Google books|Gua2CgAAQBAJ|page=229|plainurl=yes}}|page=229}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wetaworkshop.com/about-us/history/ |title=The History of Weta Workshop |website=wetaworkshop.com |accessdate=24 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n''The Frighteners'' was regarded as a box office failure.<ref>{{cite book|authorlink1=Yvonne Tasker|last=Tasker|first=Yvonne|title=Fifty Contemporary Film Directors|url={{Google books|9IxaBwAAQBAJ|page=202|plainurl=yes}}|page=202}}</ref> Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] expressed disappointment stating that \"incredible effort has resulted in a film that looks more like a demo reel than a movie\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Roger Ebert |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-frighteners-1996 |title=The Frighteners|website=rogerebert.com |date=19 July 1996 |accessdate=24 March 2016}}</ref> In February 1997, Jackson launched legal proceedings against the ''[[New Zealand Listener]]'' magazine for [[defamation]], over a review of ''The Frighteners'' which claimed that the film was \"built from the rubble of other people's movies\".<ref>Philip Matthews, \"Spectral Steel\", ''New Zealand Listener'', 14 December 1996</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Heal |first=Andrew |date=December 1997 |title=Horror Story |location=New Zealand |magazine=Metro| page=198 }}</ref> In the end, the case was not pursued further. Around this time Jackson's remake of ''King Kong'' was shelved by [[Universal Studios]], partly because of ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1998 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]'' and ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'', both giant monster movies, that had already gone into production. Universal feared it would be thrown aside by the two higher budget movies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Morton|first=Ray|title=King Kong: The History of a Movie Icon from Fay Wray to Peter Jackson|url={{Google books|UPXbsJLVgCcC|page=168|plainurl=yes}}|page=168}}</ref>\n\nThis period of transition seems not to have been entirely a happy one; it also marked one of the high points of tension between Jackson and the [[New Zealand Film Commission]] since ''Meet the Feebles'' had gone over-budget earlier in his career. Jackson has claimed the Commission considered firing him from ''Feebles'', though the NZFC went on to help fund his next three films. In 1997, the director submitted a lengthy criticism of the Commission for a magazine supplement meant to celebrate the body's 20th anniversary, criticising what he called inconsistent decision-making by inexperienced board members. The magazine felt that the material was too long and potentially defamatory to publish in that form; a shortened version of the material went on to appear in ''[[Metro (magazine)|Metro]]'' magazine.<ref>Andrew Heal, \"Horror Story\", ''Metro'', December 1997.{{full citation needed|date=October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/nznews/peter-jackson-to-head-film-commission-review-2009061910#axzz43puojiSk |title=Peter Jackson to head Film Commission review |website=newshub.co.nz |date=19 June 2009 |accessdate=24 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=John Drinnan |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=10687006 |title=Media: ASB Bank begins life after Goldstein |website=nzherald.co.nz |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=24 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Pryor|first=Ian|title=Peter Jackson: From Prince of Splatter to Lord of the Rings|url={{Google books|Sb5ZAwAAQBAJ|page=231|plainurl=yes}}|page=321}}</ref> In the ''Metro'' article Jackson criticized the Commission over funding decisions concerning a film he was hoping to executive produce, but refused to drop a client-confidentiality clause that allowed them to publicly reply to his criticisms.\n\n=== ''The Lord of the Rings'' ===\n{{Main|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\n[[File:Peter Jackson01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jackson in 2003, at the premiere of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' in [[Wellington]]]]\nJackson won the rights to film Tolkien's epic in 1997 after meeting with producer [[Saul Zaentz]].

''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' itself met with huge critical acclaim, winning eleven Oscars, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. The film was the first of the fantasy film genre to win the award for Best Picture and was the second sequel to win Best Picture (the first being ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'').

director ===\nSince 1994's ''Heavenly Creatures'' Peter Jackson's films have enjoyed success in the annual awards season, earning many nominations and winning several awards; ''The Frighteners'' being his only fictional directed effort since 1994 not to be nominated for an [[Academy Award]]. The ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy is one of the most successful trilogies of all time in terms of awards, winning more [[Academy Awards]] than the [[Francis Ford Coppola]] directed ''[[Godfather Trilogy]]'', with 2003's ''The Return of the King'' winning in all 11 categories for which it was nominated including Best Picture, Director and Adapted Screenplay. Jackson's films have fared extremely well in the technical categories as well as the major categories; all three ''Lord of the Rings'' pictures as well as ''King Kong'' won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] in their respective years. In total Jackson's directed efforts have been the most awarded films at three separate Academy Award ceremonies, the 74th, 76th and 78th.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year\n! Film\n!

This was also the first Super Bowl in [[Super Bowl XLVII|7 years]] to not feature quarterbacks [[Tom Brady]] or [[Peyton Manning]].\n\nThe first half of the game was back and forth between both teams, with the game tied at 10 heading into halftime. In the third quarter, the 49ers began to pull away, with a [[Robbie Gould]] [[Field goal|field goal]] and a rushing touchdown by [[Raheem Mostert]] giving them a 20\u201310 lead heading into the fourth quarter. However, over the last 6:13 of the game, the Chiefs offense completed two touchdown drives with Mahomes throwing touchdown passes to [[Travis Kelce]] and [[Damien Williams]], to take the lead just before the [[two-minute warning]]. The Chiefs then stopped the 49ers on defense, and a late rushing touchdown by Damien Williams, as well as a [[Kendall Fuller]] interception, sealed the victory and ended the Chiefs' 50-year championship drought.<ref>{{cite news|author=Around the NFL staff|title=Twitter reacts to Chiefs' first SB win in 50 years|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001100800/article/twitter-reacts-to-chiefs-first-sb-win-in-50-years|publisher=NFL Enterprises|website=NFL.com|date=February 2, 2020|access-date=February 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe game's broadcast in the United States by [[Fox NFL|Fox]], along with the [[Super Bowl LIV halftime show|halftime show]] headlined by [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Shakira]], was seen by an estimated 102 million viewers\u2014a slight increase over [[Super Bowl LIII]] in 2019 (which had seen the smallest audience for the game in 10 years).\n\n==Background==\n===Host selection process===\n\n[[File:200127-H-PX819-0092.jpg|thumb|Hard Rock Stadium decorated for the Super Bowl|left]]\n\nOn May 19, 2015, the league announced the four finalists that would compete to host either [[Super Bowl LIII]] in 2019 or Super Bowl LIV.

This meant the new stadium was scheduled to be open in time for the game (and the league selected the relocating team just in time to be considered for Super Bowl LIV), but, under the current construction timetable, would require a waiver of league policy to host Super Bowl LIV, as the league does not allow stadiums in their first year of existence to host the Super Bowl to ensure stadium construction delays and unforeseen problems do not jeopardize the game.

This was also the first Super Bowl in [[Super Bowl XLVII|7 years]] to not feature quarterbacks [[Tom Brady]] or [[Peyton Manning]].\n\nThe first half of the game was back and forth between both teams, with the game tied at 10 heading into halftime. In the third quarter, the 49ers began to pull away, with a [[Robbie Gould]] [[Field goal|field goal]] and a rushing touchdown by [[Raheem Mostert]] giving them a 20\u201310 lead heading into the fourth quarter. However, over the last 6:13 of the game, the Chiefs offense completed two touchdown drives with Mahomes throwing touchdown passes to [[Travis Kelce]] and [[Damien Williams]], to take the lead just before the [[two-minute warning]]. The Chiefs then stopped the 49ers on defense, and a late rushing touchdown by Damien Williams, as well as a [[Kendall Fuller]] interception, sealed the victory and ended the Chiefs' 50-year championship drought.<ref>{{cite news|author=Around the NFL staff|title=Twitter reacts to Chiefs' first SB win in 50 years|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001100800/article/twitter-reacts-to-chiefs-first-sb-win-in-50-years|publisher=NFL Enterprises|website=NFL.com|date=February 2, 2020|access-date=February 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe game's broadcast in the United States by [[Fox NFL|Fox]], along with the [[Super Bowl LIV halftime show|halftime show]] headlined by [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Shakira]], was seen by an estimated 102 million viewers\u2014a slight increase over [[Super Bowl LIII]] in 2019 (which had seen the smallest audience for the game in 10 years).\n\n==Background==\n===Host selection process===\n\n[[File:200127-H-PX819-0092.jpg|thumb|Hard Rock Stadium decorated for the Super Bowl|left]]\n\nOn May 19, 2015, the league announced the four finalists that would compete to host either [[Super Bowl LIII]] in 2019 or Super Bowl LIV.

This meant the new stadium was scheduled to be open in time for the game (and the league selected the relocating team just in time to be considered for Super Bowl LIV), but, under the current construction timetable, would require a waiver of league policy to host Super Bowl LIV, as the league does not allow stadiums in their first year of existence to host the Super Bowl to ensure stadium construction delays and unforeseen problems do not jeopardize the game.
