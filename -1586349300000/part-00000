On April 29, 1856, thirty-three camels and five drivers arrived at [[Indianola, Texas]]. While camels were suited to the job of transport in the American Southwest, the experiment failed. Their stubbornness and aggressiveness made them unpopular among soldiers, and they frightened horses. Many of the camels were sold to private owners, others escaped into the desert. These feral camels continued to be sighted through the early 20th century, with the last reported sighting in 1941 near [[Douglas, Texas]].<ref>[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/whatever-happened-wild-camels-american-west-180956176/?no-ist Smithsonian: \"Whatever Happened to the Wild Camels of the West?\"]</ref>\n\n;British Columbia, Canada\n{{Main|Cariboo camels}}\nCamels were used from 1862 to 1863 in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] during the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]].<ref>[http://www.cariboogoldrush.com/wagonroa/camel1.htm Cabiroo.com: Camels]</ref>\n\n==Camel caravan organization==\nWhile organization of camel caravans varied over time and the territory traversed, [[Owen Lattimore]]'s account of caravan life in northern China in the 1920s gives a good idea of what camel transport is like. In his ''Desert Road to Turkestan'' he describes mostly camel caravans run by [[Han Chinese]] and [[Hui people|Hui]] firms from eastern China ([[Hohhot]], [[Baotou]]) or [[Xinjiang]] ([[Qitai County|Qitai]] (then called Gucheng), [[Barkol Kazakh Autonomous County|Barkol]]), plying the routes connecting those two regions through the [[Gobi Desert]] by  way of [[Inner Mongolia|Inner]] (or, before Mongolia's independence, [[Mongolia|Outer]]) Mongolia. Before Outer Mongolia's effective independence of China (circa 1920) the same firms also ran caravans into [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga]], [[Uliassutai]], and other centers of Outer Mongolia, and to the Russian border at [[Kyakhta]], but with the creation of an international border, those routes came into decline. Less important caravan routes served various other areas of northern China, such as most centers in today's [[Gansu]], [[Ningxia]], and northern [[Qinghai]]. Some of the oldest [[Hohhot]]-based caravan firms had a history dating to the early [[Qing Dynasty]].<ref name=drt/>\n\n===Camels===\n[[File:Lugou-Bridge-east-end-relief-3577.jpg|300px|thumb|A modern sculptor's depiction of (the head of) a caravan approaching [[Beijing]], complete with a camel-puller and a mounted caravan master, head cook, or  ''xiansheng'' riding next to him. In the deserts of Mongolia, one would not see a dignitary in a [[sedan chair]] travelling along, nor would a baby camel accompany its mother.<ref>According to Lattimore (1928/9, p. 207), while pregnant female camels could travel as part of the caravan with a full load, any baby camel born in the desert would have to be abandoned, since, if the camel cow were to [[lactation|nurse]] the young one, she would become too thin for work.</ref>]] Caravans originating from both ends of the Hohhot-Gucheng route were composed of two-humped [[Bactrian camels]], suitable for the climate on the area, although very occasionally one could see single-humped [[Dromedary|Dromedaries]] brought to this route by [[Uyghur people|Uighur]] (\"Turki\", in Lattimore's parlance) caravan people from [[Hami Prefecture|Hami]]<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), p. 151.</ref> A caravan would be normally composed of a number of files ({{zh|c=\u8fde}}, ''lian''), of up to 18 camels each. Each of the rank-and-file caravan men, known as the ''camel-pullers'' ({{zh|c=\u62c9\u9a86\u9a7c\u7684}}, ''la luotuo-de''), was in charge of one such file. On the march, the camel-puller's job was to lead the first camel of his file by a rope tied to a peg attached to its nose, each of the other camels of the file being led by means of similar rope by the camel in front of it. Two files (''lian'') formed a ''ba'', and the camel-pullers of the two files would help each other when loading cargo on the camels at the beginning of each day's march or unloading it when halted. To do their job properly camel-pullers had to be experts on camels: as Lattimore comments, \"because there is no good doctoring known for him [a camel] when he is sick, they must learn how to keep him well.\" Taking care of camels' health included the ability to find the best available grazing for them and keeping them away from poisonous plants; knowledge of when one should not allow a camel to drink too much water; how to park camels for the night, allowing them to obtain the best possible shelter from wind-blown snow in winter; how to properly distribute the load to prevent it from hurting the animal; and how to treat minor injuries of the camels, such as blisters or pack-sores.<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), pp. 108-115</ref>\n\nThe loading of camels was described by [[Mildred Cable]] and [[Francesca French]] in their book ''Through Jade Gate and Central Asia'' (1927): \u00abIn the loading of a camel its grumblings commence as the first bale is placed on its back, and continue uninterruptedly until the load is equal to its strength, but as soon as it shows signs of being in excess, the grumbling ceases suddenly, and then the driver says: \"Enough! put no more on this beast!\"\u00bb<ref>Cable, M. & French, F. (1937) ''Through Jade Gate and Central Asia''; 6th ed. London: Hodder & Stoughton; p. 21</ref>\n\n[[File:Bilma-Salzkarawane1.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Azalai]] salt caravan practiced by [[Tuareg]] traders in the [[Sahara]] desert. The French reported that the 1906 caravan numbered 20,000 camels.]]\n===Caravan people ===\n\nA caravan could consist of 150 or so camels (8 or more files), with a camel-puller for each file. Besides the camel-pullers the caravan would also include a ''xiansheng'' (\u5148\u751f, literally, \"Sir\", \"Mister\") (typically, an older man with a long experience as a camel-puller, now playing the role of a general manager), one or two cooks, and the caravan master, whose authority over the caravan and its people was as absolute as that of a captain on a ship. If the owner of the caravan did not travel with the caravan himself, he would send along a [[supercargo]]--the person who will take care of the disposal of the freight upon arrival, but had no authority during the journey. The caravan could carry a number of paying passengers as well, who would alternate between riding on top of a camel load and walking.<ref name=drt/>\n\nCamel-pullers' salary was quite low (around 2 silver [[tael]]s a  month in 1926, which would not be enough even for shoes and clothing he wore out while walking with his camels), although they were also fed and provided with tent space at the caravan owner's expense. Those people worked not so much for the wages as for the benefit of carrying some cargo\u2014half of a camel load, or a full load\u2014of their own on the caravan's camels; when successfully sold at the destination, it would bring a handy profit. Even more importantly, if a camel-puller could afford to buy a camel or a few of his own, he was allowed to include them into his file, and to collect the carriage-money for the cargo (assigned by the caravan owner) that they would carry. Once the camel-puller got rich enough to own close to a full file of 18 camels, he could join the caravan not as an employee but as a kind of a partner\u2014now instead of earning wages he would be paying money (around 20 [[tael]]s per round-trip in 1926) to the owner of (the rest of) the caravan for the benefit of joining the caravan, sharing in the food, etc.<ref name=drt/>\n\n===Diet===\nThe caravan people's food was mostly based around [[oat]] and [[millet]] flour, with some animal fat. A sheep would be bought from the Mongols and slaughtered every now and then, and tea was the usual daily drink; as fresh vegetables were scarce, [[scurvy]] was a danger.<ref name=drt/> Besides the paid cargo and the food and gear for the men, the camels would also carry a fair amount of [[fodder]] for themselves (typically, dried [[peas]] when going west, and [[barley]] when going east, those being the cheapest types of camel feed in Hohhot and Gucheng, respectively). It was estimated that, when leaving its point of origin, for every 100 loads of merchandise the caravan would carry around 30 loads of fodder. When that was not enough (especially in winter) more fodder could be bought (very expensively) from dealers who would come to the caravan route's popular stopping places from the populated areas of Gansu or Ningxia to the south.<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), p. 74</ref>\n\n===Cargo===\nTypical cargo carried by the caravans were commodities such as wool, cotton fabrics, or tea, as well as miscellaneous manufactured goods for sale in Xinjiang and Mongolia. Opium was carried as well, typically by smaller, surreptitious, caravans, usually in winter (since in the hot weather opium would be too easily detected by the smell). More exotic loads could include [[jade]] from [[Khotan]],<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), pp. 156-157.</ref> elk [[antlers]] prized in [[Chinese medicine]], or even dead bodies of the [[Shanxi]] caravan men and traders, who happened to die while in Xinjiang. In the latter case, the bodies had been first \"temporarily\" buried in Gucheng in light-weight coffins, and when, after three or so years in the grave the flesh had been mostly \"[[mummy|consumed away]]\", the merchant guild sent the bodies to the east by a special caravan. Due to the special nature of the load, higher freight rate was charged for such \"dead passengers\".<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), pp. 230-231</ref>\n\n===Speed===\nAccording to Lattimore's diary, caravan travel in Inner Mongolia did not always follow a regular schedule. Caravans traveled or camped at any time of day or night, depending on weather, local conditions, and the  need for rest. Since the caravan traveled at the walking speed of the men, the distance made in a day (a \"stage\") was usually between {{convert|10|and|25|mi|km|0|abbr=on}}, depending on road and weather conditions, and distances between water sources. On occasions several days were spent in a camp without going forward, due to bad weather. A one-way trip from [[Hohhot]] to [[Qitai County|Gucheng]] ({{convert|1550|to|1650|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=or}} by Lattimore's reckoning<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), p. 100</ref>) could take anything from three to eight months.<ref name=drt50>Lattimore (1928-29), pp. 50-51.</ref>\n\nSmaller caravans owned by Mongols of the [[Alxa League|Alashan]] (the westernmost Inner Mongolia) and manned by Han Chinese from [[Minqin County|Zhenfan]], were able to make longer marches (and, thus, cover longer distances faster) than the typical Han Chinese or Hui caravans, because the Mongols were able to always use \"fresh\" camels (picked from their large herd for just a single journey), every man was provided with a camel to ride, and loads were much lighter than in the \"standard\" caravans (rarely exceeding {{convert|270|lb|kg|1}}. These caravans would typically travel by day, from sunrise to sunset.<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), p. 168.</ref> Such a camel train is described in the accounts of the journey made by [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter Fleming]] and [[Ella Maillart]] in the Gobi Desert in the mid-1930s.\n\n===Logistics===\nInns called [[caravanserai]] were spread along the route of a long caravan journey. These roadside inns specialized in catering to travelers along established trade routes, such as the [[Silk Road]] and the [[Royal Road]].\n\nIt was necessary for camels to spend at least two months between long journeys to recuperate, and the best time for that recuperation was in June\u2013July, when camels shed their [[camel hair|hair]] and the grazing is best. Therefore, the best practice was for a caravan to leave [[Hohhot]] in August, just after the grazing season; upon reaching Gucheng, weaker camels could stay there until the next summer by grazing whatever vegetation is available in winter, while the stronger ones, after a few weeks of recovery on a grain diet (grain being cheaper in Xinjiang than in eastern China), would be sent back in late winter/early spring, taking along plenty of grain for fodder, and returning to Hohhot before the next grazing season. Vice versa, one could leave Hohhot in the spring, spend the summer grazing season in Xinjiang, and come back in the late fall of the same year. Either way, it would be possible for the caravan people and their best camels to make a full round trip within a year. However, such perfect scheduling was not always possible, and it was often the case that a caravan sent out from Hohhot in August would end up staying on the other end of the route until and through the next grazing season, coming back to Hohhot about a year and a half after its departure.\n<ref name=drt50/>\n\n===Loss of camels; camel hair trade===\nOn almost every journey quite a few camels in each caravan would be lost. On a particularly exhausting section of the trip, an animal already worn out by many weeks of walking, or accidentally poisoned by eating a poisonous plant, would kneel down and not rise anymore. Since killing a camel was considered bad [[karma]] by the caravan people, the hopeless animal\u2014whose death, if it was owned by an individual camel-puller, would be a huge material loss for its owner\u2014was simply left behind to die, \"thrown on the Gobi\" as the camel men would say.<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), p. 104.</ref>\n\nSince camels moult in the summer, camel owners received additional income from collecting several pounds of [[camel hair|hair]] their animals dropped during the summer grazing (and shedding season); in northern China, the camel hair trade started around the 1880s. Later, caravan men learned the art of [[knitting]] and [[crocheting]] from the defeated [[White movement|White Russians]] (in exile in Xinjiang after the [[Russian Civil War]]) and the items they had made were transported to eastern China by camel caravan. Although the hair shed by the camels or picked from them was of course considered the property of the camel owners, caravan workers were entitled to make use of some hair for making knitwear for themselves (mostly socks) or for sale. [[Owen Lattimore|Lattimore]] in 1926 observed camel-pullers \"knitting on the march; if they ran out of [[yarn]], they would reach back to the first camel of the file they were leading, pluck a handful of hair from the neck, and roll it in their palms into the beginning of a length of yarn; a weight was attached to this, and given a twist to start it spinning, and the man went on feeding wool into the thread until he had spun enough yarn to continue his knitting\".<ref name=drt52>Lattimore (1928/9), p. 52.</ref>\n\n== Cultural associations==\n\"In The Desert\" (\"\u0412\u0435\u0440\u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434\u044b\", lit. = \"camels\") is a \"traditional Russian\" song, performed by [[Donald Swann]]. He provides an English-language translation after every line. The song is extremely repetitive (\"Another camel is approaching\"), rendering the translation largely redundant, \"a whole caravan of camels is approaching\".<ref>Flanders and Swann, \"[http://www.allmusic.com/album/flanders-amp-swann-at-the-drop-of-another-hat-mw0001321681 At the Drop of Another Hat]\" (1964)</ref>\n\n[[Fritz M\u00fchlenweg]] wrote a book called ''In geheimer Mission durch die W\u00fcste Gobi'' (part one in English ''Big Tiger and Compass Mountain''), published in 1950. It was later shortened and translated into English under the title ''Big Tiger and Christian''; it concerns the adventures of two boys who cross the [[Gobi Desert]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Caravan (travellers)]]\n*[[Caravanserai]]\n* [[Cariboo camels]]\n*[[Twenty mule team]]\n\n==References==\n[[File:THE PEKINGESE CAMEL.jpg|thumb|\"The Pekingese Camel\"; photograph by John Thomson<ref>John Thomson: \"At certain seasons of the year, camels may be encountered in tens of thousands crossing the desert of Gobi, laden with brick tea, on their way to the Russian frontier. This brick tea, in the absence of metallic currency, forms the circulating medium in Mongolia, Siberia, and Thibet. When in the province of Peichihli I witnessed the departure of a train of 2,000 of these camels laden with brick tea to be sold in the Russian markets. These beasts are also employed in transporting coal, and other commodities, from one part of the province to another, and they are highly esteemed by the Mongols, as they can be easily managed, and can accomplish long journeys in arid regions with scant supplies of food and water. As many of my readers are aware, the camel is physically adapted for traversing the sandy plains of Asia, where they are found in the greatest numbers. The stomach is supplied with bladders which enable the animal to carry a store of fresh water, and in like manner the humps are furnished with a store of food in the shape of fatty matter which may be absorbed in case of need.\"</ref>]]\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[Peter Fleming (writer)|Fleming, Peter]] (1936) ''[[News from Tartary: a journey from Peking to Kashmir]]''.

Before Outer Mongolia's effective independence of China (circa 1920) the same firms also ran caravans into [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga]], [[Uliassutai]], and other centers of Outer Mongolia, and to the Russian border at [[Kyakhta]], but with the creation of an international border, those routes came into decline. Less important caravan routes served various other areas of northern China, such as most centers in today's [[Gansu]], [[Ningxia]], and northern [[Qinghai]]. Some of the oldest [[Hohhot]]-based caravan firms had a history dating to the early [[Qing Dynasty]].<ref name=drt/>\n\n===Camels===\n[[File:Lugou-Bridge-east-end-relief-3577.jpg|300px|thumb|A modern sculptor's depiction of (the head of) a caravan approaching [[Beijing]], complete with a camel-puller and a mounted caravan master, head cook, or  ''xiansheng'' riding next to him. In the deserts of Mongolia, one would not see a dignitary in a [[sedan chair]] travelling along, nor would a baby camel accompany its mother.<ref>According to Lattimore (1928/9, p. 207), while pregnant female camels could travel as part of the caravan with a full load, any baby camel born in the desert would have to be abandoned, since, if the camel cow were to [[lactation|nurse]] the young one, she would become too thin for work.</ref>]] Caravans originating from both ends of the Hohhot-Gucheng route were composed of two-humped [[Bactrian camels]], suitable for the climate on the area, although very occasionally one could see single-humped [[Dromedary|Dromedaries]] brought to this route by [[Uyghur people|Uighur]] (\"Turki\", in Lattimore's parlance) caravan people from [[Hami Prefecture|Hami]]<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), p. 151.</ref> A caravan would be normally composed of a number of files ({{zh|c=\u8fde}}, ''lian''), of up to 18 camels each. Each of the rank-and-file caravan men, known as the ''camel-pullers'' ({{zh|c=\u62c9\u9a86\u9a7c\u7684}}, ''la luotuo-de''), was in charge of one such file. On the march, the camel-puller's job was to lead the first camel of his file by a rope tied to a peg attached to its nose, each of the other camels of the file being led by means of similar rope by the camel in front of it. Two files (''lian'') formed a ''ba'', and the camel-pullers of the two files would help each other when loading cargo on the camels at the beginning of each day's march or unloading it when halted. To do their job properly camel-pullers had to be experts on camels: as Lattimore comments, \"because there is no good doctoring known for him [a camel] when he is sick, they must learn how to keep him well.\" Taking care of camels' health included the ability to find the best available grazing for them and keeping them away from poisonous plants; knowledge of when one should not allow a camel to drink too much water; how to park camels for the night, allowing them to obtain the best possible shelter from wind-blown snow in winter; how to properly distribute the load to prevent it from hurting the animal; and how to treat minor injuries of the camels, such as blisters or pack-sores.<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), pp. 108-115</ref>\n\nThe loading of camels was described by [[Mildred Cable]] and [[Francesca French]] in their book ''Through Jade Gate and Central Asia'' (1927): \u00abIn the loading of a camel its grumblings commence as the first bale is placed on its back, and continue uninterruptedly until the load is equal to its strength, but as soon as it shows signs of being in excess, the grumbling ceases suddenly, and then the driver says: \"Enough! put no more on this beast!\"\u00bb<ref>Cable, M. & French, F. (1937) ''Through Jade Gate and Central Asia''; 6th ed. London: Hodder & Stoughton; p. 21</ref>\n\n[[File:Bilma-Salzkarawane1.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Azalai]] salt caravan practiced by [[Tuareg]] traders in the [[Sahara]] desert. The French reported that the 1906 caravan numbered 20,000 camels.]]\n===Caravan people ===\n\nA caravan could consist of 150 or so camels (8 or more files), with a camel-puller for each file. Besides the camel-pullers the caravan would also include a ''xiansheng'' (\u5148\u751f, literally, \"Sir\", \"Mister\") (typically, an older man with a long experience as a camel-puller, now playing the role of a general manager), one or two cooks, and the caravan master, whose authority over the caravan and its people was as absolute as that of a captain on a ship. If the owner of the caravan did not travel with the caravan himself, he would send along a [[supercargo]]--the person who will take care of the disposal of the freight upon arrival, but had no authority during the journey. The caravan could carry a number of paying passengers as well, who would alternate between riding on top of a camel load and walking.<ref name=drt/>\n\nCamel-pullers' salary was quite low (around 2 silver [[tael]]s a  month in 1926, which would not be enough even for shoes and clothing he wore out while walking with his camels), although they were also fed and provided with tent space at the caravan owner's expense. Those people worked not so much for the wages as for the benefit of carrying some cargo\u2014half of a camel load, or a full load\u2014of their own on the caravan's camels; when successfully sold at the destination, it would bring a handy profit. Even more importantly, if a camel-puller could afford to buy a camel or a few of his own, he was allowed to include them into his file, and to collect the carriage-money for the cargo (assigned by the caravan owner) that they would carry. Once the camel-puller got rich enough to own close to a full file of 18 camels, he could join the caravan not as an employee but as a kind of a partner\u2014now instead of earning wages he would be paying money (around 20 [[tael]]s per round-trip in 1926) to the owner of (the rest of) the caravan for the benefit of joining the caravan, sharing in the food, etc.<ref name=drt/>\n\n===Diet===\nThe caravan people's food was mostly based around [[oat]] and [[millet]] flour, with some animal fat. A sheep would be bought from the Mongols and slaughtered every now and then, and tea was the usual daily drink; as fresh vegetables were scarce, [[scurvy]] was a danger.<ref name=drt/> Besides the paid cargo and the food and gear for the men, the camels would also carry a fair amount of [[fodder]] for themselves (typically, dried [[peas]] when going west, and [[barley]] when going east, those being the cheapest types of camel feed in Hohhot and Gucheng, respectively). It was estimated that, when leaving its point of origin, for every 100 loads of merchandise the caravan would carry around 30 loads of fodder. When that was not enough (especially in winter) more fodder could be bought (very expensively) from dealers who would come to the caravan route's popular stopping places from the populated areas of Gansu or Ningxia to the south.<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), p. 74</ref>\n\n===Cargo===\nTypical cargo carried by the caravans were commodities such as wool, cotton fabrics, or tea, as well as miscellaneous manufactured goods for sale in Xinjiang and Mongolia. Opium was carried as well, typically by smaller, surreptitious, caravans, usually in winter (since in the hot weather opium would be too easily detected by the smell). More exotic loads could include [[jade]] from [[Khotan]],<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), pp. 156-157.</ref> elk [[antlers]] prized in [[Chinese medicine]], or even dead bodies of the [[Shanxi]] caravan men and traders, who happened to die while in Xinjiang. In the latter case, the bodies had been first \"temporarily\" buried in Gucheng in light-weight coffins, and when, after three or so years in the grave the flesh had been mostly \"[[mummy|consumed away]]\", the merchant guild sent the bodies to the east by a special caravan. Due to the special nature of the load, higher freight rate was charged for such \"dead passengers\".<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), pp. 230-231</ref>\n\n===Speed===\nAccording to Lattimore's diary, caravan travel in Inner Mongolia did not always follow a regular schedule. Caravans traveled or camped at any time of day or night, depending on weather, local conditions, and the  need for rest. Since the caravan traveled at the walking speed of the men, the distance made in a day (a \"stage\") was usually between {{convert|10|and|25|mi|km|0|abbr=on}}, depending on road and weather conditions, and distances between water sources. On occasions several days were spent in a camp without going forward, due to bad weather. A one-way trip from [[Hohhot]] to [[Qitai County|Gucheng]] ({{convert|1550|to|1650|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=or}} by Lattimore's reckoning<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), p. 100</ref>) could take anything from three to eight months.<ref name=drt50>Lattimore (1928-29), pp. 50-51.</ref>\n\nSmaller caravans owned by Mongols of the [[Alxa League|Alashan]] (the westernmost Inner Mongolia) and manned by Han Chinese from [[Minqin County|Zhenfan]], were able to make longer marches (and, thus, cover longer distances faster) than the typical Han Chinese or Hui caravans, because the Mongols were able to always use \"fresh\" camels (picked from their large herd for just a single journey), every man was provided with a camel to ride, and loads were much lighter than in the \"standard\" caravans (rarely exceeding {{convert|270|lb|kg|1}}. These caravans would typically travel by day, from sunrise to sunset.<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), p. 168.</ref> Such a camel train is described in the accounts of the journey made by [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter Fleming]] and [[Ella Maillart]] in the Gobi Desert in the mid-1930s.\n\n===Logistics===\nInns called [[caravanserai]] were spread along the route of a long caravan journey. These roadside inns specialized in catering to travelers along established trade routes, such as the [[Silk Road]] and the [[Royal Road]].\n\nIt was necessary for camels to spend at least two months between long journeys to recuperate, and the best time for that recuperation was in June\u2013July, when camels shed their [[camel hair|hair]] and the grazing is best. Therefore, the best practice was for a caravan to leave [[Hohhot]] in August, just after the grazing season; upon reaching Gucheng, weaker camels could stay there until the next summer by grazing whatever vegetation is available in winter, while the stronger ones, after a few weeks of recovery on a grain diet (grain being cheaper in Xinjiang than in eastern China), would be sent back in late winter/early spring, taking along plenty of grain for fodder, and returning to Hohhot before the next grazing season. Vice versa, one could leave Hohhot in the spring, spend the summer grazing season in Xinjiang, and come back in the late fall of the same year. Either way, it would be possible for the caravan people and their best camels to make a full round trip within a year. However, such perfect scheduling was not always possible, and it was often the case that a caravan sent out from Hohhot in August would end up staying on the other end of the route until and through the next grazing season, coming back to Hohhot about a year and a half after its departure.\n<ref name=drt50/>\n\n===Loss of camels; camel hair trade===\nOn almost every journey quite a few camels in each caravan would be lost. On a particularly exhausting section of the trip, an animal already worn out by many weeks of walking, or accidentally poisoned by eating a poisonous plant, would kneel down and not rise anymore. Since killing a camel was considered bad [[karma]] by the caravan people, the hopeless animal\u2014whose death, if it was owned by an individual camel-puller, would be a huge material loss for its owner\u2014was simply left behind to die, \"thrown on the Gobi\" as the camel men would say.<ref>Lattimore (1928/9), p. 104.</ref>\n\nSince camels moult in the summer, camel owners received additional income from collecting several pounds of [[camel hair|hair]] their animals dropped during the summer grazing (and shedding season); in northern China, the camel hair trade started around the 1880s. Later, caravan men learned the art of [[knitting]] and [[crocheting]] from the defeated [[White movement|White Russians]] (in exile in Xinjiang after the [[Russian Civil War]]) and the items they had made were transported to eastern China by camel caravan. Although the hair shed by the camels or picked from them was of course considered the property of the camel owners, caravan workers were entitled to make use of some hair for making knitwear for themselves (mostly socks) or for sale. [[Owen Lattimore|Lattimore]] in 1926 observed camel-pullers \"knitting on the march; if they ran out of [[yarn]], they would reach back to the first camel of the file they were leading, pluck a handful of hair from the neck, and roll it in their palms into the beginning of a length of yarn; a weight was attached to this, and given a twist to start it spinning, and the man went on feeding wool into the thread until he had spun enough yarn to continue his knitting\".<ref name=drt52>Lattimore (1928/9), p. 52.</ref>\n\n== Cultural associations==\n\"In The Desert\" (\"\u0412\u0435\u0440\u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434\u044b\", lit. = \"camels\") is a \"traditional Russian\" song, performed by [[Donald Swann]]. He provides an English-language translation after every line. The song is extremely repetitive (\"Another camel is approaching\"), rendering the translation largely redundant, \"a whole caravan of camels is approaching\".<ref>Flanders and Swann, \"[http://www.allmusic.com/album/flanders-amp-swann-at-the-drop-of-another-hat-mw0001321681 At the Drop of Another Hat]\" (1964)</ref>\n\n[[Fritz M\u00fchlenweg]] wrote a book called ''In geheimer Mission durch die W\u00fcste Gobi'' (part one in English ''Big Tiger and Compass Mountain''), published in 1950. It was later shortened and translated into English under the title ''Big Tiger and Christian''; it concerns the adventures of two boys who cross the [[Gobi Desert]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Caravan (travellers)]]\n*[[caravanserai]]\n* [[Cariboo camels]]\n*[[Twenty mule team]]\n\n==References==\n[[File:THE PEKINGESE CAMEL.jpg|thumb|\"The Pekingese Camel\"; photograph by John Thomson<ref>John Thomson: \"At certain seasons of the year, camels may be encountered in tens of thousands crossing the desert of Gobi, laden with brick tea, on their way to the Russian frontier. This brick tea, in the absence of metallic currency, forms the circulating medium in Mongolia, Siberia, and Thibet. When in the province of Peichihli I witnessed the departure of a train of 2,000 of these camels laden with brick tea to be sold in the Russian markets. These beasts are also employed in transporting coal, and other commodities, from one part of the province to another, and they are highly esteemed by the Mongols, as they can be easily managed, and can accomplish long journeys in arid regions with scant supplies of food and water. As many of my readers are aware, the camel is physically adapted for traversing the sandy plains of Asia, where they are found in the greatest numbers. The stomach is supplied with bladders which enable the animal to carry a store of fresh water, and in like manner the humps are furnished with a store of food in the shape of fatty matter which may be absorbed in case of need.\"</ref>]]\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[Peter Fleming (writer)|Fleming, Peter]] (1936) ''[[News from Tartary: a journey from Peking to Kashmir]]''.

He enrolled at [[Rice University]] in [[Houston, Texas]] in 1940 and played three seasons on the school's football team. Humble then spent three years in the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] during [[World War II]], serving in the [[Pacific War]] and earning a [[Bronze Star Medal]] before returning to complete his college studies in 1946.

Humble then spent three years in the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] during [[World War II]], serving in the [[Pacific War]] and earning a [[Bronze Star Medal]] before returning to complete his college studies in 1946. Sportswriters named him a first-team [[All-America]]n after the [[Rice Owls football|Rice Owls]] finished with an 8\u20132 [[Winning percentage|win\u2013loss record]] and beat [[University of Tennessee|Tennessee]] 8-0 in the 1947 [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]].\n\nThe AAFC's [[Baltimore Colts (1947-1950)|Baltimore Colts]] signed Humble in 1947, but the Browns acquired him in a trade before the season.

This resulted in the [[Battle of Fort Dearborn]] on August 15, 1812, the only known armed conflict in the Chicago area. This battle convinced the American government that the Native Americans had to be removed from their land. After being attacked in the [[Black Hawk War]] in 1832, the Native Americans in Milwaukee signed the [[Treaty of Chicago#1833 Treaty of Chicago|Treaty of Chicago]] with the United States in 1833.

French missionaries and traders first passed through the area in the late 17th and 18th centuries. Alexis Laframboise, in 1785, coming from Michilimackinac (now in Michigan) settled a trading post; and is considered the first resident of European descent in the Milwaukee region.<ref name=\"St-Pierre, T 1895\">St-Pierre, T.

Walker]]. Solomon Juneau was the first of the three to come to the area, in 1818. He founded a town called Juneau's Side, or Juneautown, that began attracting more settlers. In competition with Juneau, Byron Kilbourn established Kilbourntown west of the [[Milwaukee River]]. He ensured the roads running toward the river did not join with those on the east side. This accounts for the large number of angled bridges that still exist in Milwaukee today.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/bridges/|title=Bridges {{!}} Encyclopedia of Milwaukee|website=emke.uwm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref> Further, Kilbourn distributed maps of the area which only showed Kilbourntown, implying Juneautown did not exist or the river's east side was uninhabited and thus undesirable. The third prominent developer was George H. Walker. He claimed land to the south of the Milwaukee River, along with Juneautown, where he built a log house in 1834. This area grew and became known as Walker's Point.\n\nThe first large wave of settlement to the areas that would later become Milwaukee County and the City of Milwaukee began in 1835, following removal of the tribes in the Council of Three Fires. Early that year it became known that Juneau and Kilbourn intended to lay out competing town-sites. By the year's end both had purchased their lands from the government and made their first sales. There were perhaps 100 new settlers in this year, mostly from New England and other Eastern states. On September 17, 1835, the first election was held in Milwaukee; the number of votes cast was 39.<ref>{{Citation-attribution|{{Cite book|title = Memoirs of Milwaukee County from the Earliest Historical Times ..., Vol. I|last = Watrous|first = Jerome A.|publisher = Western Historical Association|year = 1909|url = https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:Jqsw4p18KfAC&id=XD4VAAAAYAAJ#v=onepage&q&f=false|location = Madison, Wisconsin|pages = 265\u2013267}}}}</ref>\n\nBy 1840, the three towns had grown, along with their rivalries. There were intense battles between the towns, mainly Juneautown and Kilbourntown, which culminated with the [[Milwaukee Bridge War]] of 1845. Following the Bridge War, town leaders decided the best course of action was to officially unite the towns. So, on January 31, 1846, they combined to incorporate as the City of Milwaukee and elected Solomon Juneau as Milwaukee's first mayor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://192.159.83.40/SOS/pdf/THEOSOS_025/images/00014104.pdf |title=City of Milwaukee Incorporated, page 164, 1846; page 314, 1851 |accessdate=April 8, 2007 |author=City of Milwaukee |publisher=Office of the Secretary of State of Wisconsin|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070605144656/http://192.159.83.40/SOS/pdf/THEOSOS_025/images/00014104.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = June 5, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Milwaukee birdseye map by Bailey (1872). loc call no g4124m-pm010450.jpg|thumb|Illustrated map of Milwaukee in 1872]]\n\nMilwaukee began to grow as a city as high numbers of immigrants, mainly [[Germans|German]], made their way to Wisconsin during the 1840s and 1850s. Scholars classify [[German immigration to the United States]] in three major waves, and Wisconsin received a significant number of immigrants from all three. The first wave from 1845 to 1855 consisted mainly of people from [[Southwestern Germany]], the second wave from 1865 to 1873 concerned primarily [[Northwestern Germany]], while the third wave from 1880 to 1893 came from [[Northeastern Germany]].<ref name=\"Bungert, Heike 2006\">Bungert, Heike, Cora Lee Kluge and Robert C.

In 1890, the 2.78 million first-generation German Americans represented the second-largest foreign-born group in the United States.

He later explained in 1854 why he came to Milwaukee, \n<blockquote>\"It is true, similar things [cultural events and societies] were done in other cities where the Forty-eighters {{sic}} had congregated.

The pattern of German immigrants to settle near each other encouraged the continuation of German lifestyle and customs. This resulted in [[German language]] organizations that encompassed all aspects of life; for example, singing societies and gymnastics clubs. Germans also had a lasting influence on the American school system. [[Kindergarten]] was created as a pre-school for children, and sports programs of all levels, as well as music and art were incorporated as elements of the regular school curriculum. These ideas were first introduced by radical-democratic German groups, such as the Socialist Turner Societies, known today as the [[American Turners]]. Specifically in Milwaukee, the American [[Turners]] established its own [[Normal College]] for teachers of physical education and a German-English Academy.<ref>Rippley, LaVern J. and Eberhard Reichmann, trans. \"The German Americans, An Ethnic Experience.\" [http://maxkade.iupui.edu/ Max Kade German-American Center] and [[Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis]].

Foremost among these were [[Polish people|Polish]] immigrants. The Poles had many reasons for leaving their homeland, mainly poverty and political oppression. Because Milwaukee offered the Polish immigrants an abundance of low-paying entry level jobs, it became one of the largest [[Polish settlements in the USA]].\n\n[[File:Flickr - \u2026trialsanderrors - Wisconsin Street, Milwaukee, 1900.jpg|thumb|Wisconsin Street with [[Pabst Building]], Milwaukee, 1900]]\n\nFor many residents, [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee#Milwaukee's South Side|Milwaukee's South Side]] is synonymous with the [[Milwaukee#Polish immigrants|Polish community]] that developed here. The group maintained a high profile here for decades, and it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that families began to disperse to the southern suburbs.\n\nBy 1850, there were seventy-five Poles in [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]] and the [[US Census]] shows they had a variety of occupations: grocers, blacksmiths, tavernkeepers, coopers, butchers, broommakers, shoemakers, draymen, laborers, and farmers. Three distinct Polish communities evolved in Milwaukee, with the majority settling in the area south of Greenfield Avenue. Milwaukee County's Polish population of 30,000 in 1890 rose to 100,000 by 1915. Poles historically have had a strong national cultural and social identity, maintained through the Catholic Church. A view of Milwaukee's South Side skyline is replete with the steeples of the many churches these immigrants built that are still vital centers of the community.\n\n[[St. Stanislaus Catholic Church (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|St. Stanislaus Catholic Church]] and the surrounding [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee|neighborhood]] was the center of [[Polish people|Polish]] life in Milwaukee. As the Polish community surrounding St. Stanislaus continued to grow, Mitchell Street became known as the \"Polish Grand Avenue\". As Mitchell Street grew more dense, the Polish population started moving south to the [[Lincoln Village, City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Lincoln Village neighborhood]], home to the [[Basilica of St. Josaphat]] and [[Lincoln Village, City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin#Kosciuszko Park|Kosciuszko Park]].

Milwaukee elected three [[mayor]]s who ran on the ticket of the Socialist Party: [[Emil Seidel]] (1910\u20131912), [[Daniel Hoan]] (1916\u20131940), and [[Frank Zeidler]] (1948\u20131960). Often referred to as \"[[Sewer Socialism|Sewer Socialists]]\", the Milwaukee Socialists were characterized by their practical approach to government and labor.\n\n===Historic neighborhoods===\n{{Main|Neighborhoods of Milwaukee}}\n[[File:Third Ward MKEa.jpg|thumb|The historic Third Ward]]\n\nIn 1892, [[Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin|Whitefish Bay]], [[South Milwaukee, Wisconsin|South Milwaukee]], and [[Wauwatosa, Wisconsin|Wauwatosa]] were incorporated. They were followed by [[Cudahy, Wisconsin|Cudahy]] (1895), North Milwaukee (1897) and East Milwaukee, later known as [[Shorewood, Wisconsin|Shorewood]], in 1900. In the early 20th century [[West Allis, Wisconsin|West Allis]] (1902), and [[West Milwaukee, Wisconsin|West Milwaukee]] (1906) were added, which completed the first generation of \"inner-ring\" suburbs.\n\nIn the 1920s [[Chicago]] gangster activity came north to Milwaukee during the [[Prohibition era]]. [[Al Capone]], noted Chicago mobster, owned a home in the Milwaukee suburb [[Brookfield, Wisconsin|Brookfield]], where [[moonshine]] was made. The house still stands on a street named after Capone.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.brookfieldnow.com/news/102435199.html |date=November 11, 2010 |title=It's everyday life that keeps local historian fascinated: But the Hollywood- worthy moments aren't bad, either? |author=Nan Bialek}}</ref>\n\nBy 1960, Milwaukee had grown to become one of the largest cities in the United States. Its population peaked at 741,324. In 1960, the Census Bureau reported city's population as 91.1% white and 8.4% black.<ref>{{cite web|title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archivedate=August 12, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nBy the late 1960s, Milwaukee's population had started to decline as people moved to suburbs, aided by federal subsidies of highways. They moved to take advantage of new housing.<ref>Glabere, Michael. \"Milwaukee:A Tale of Three Cities\" in, ''From Redlining to Reinvestment: Community Responses to Urban Disinvestment'' edited by Gregory D. Squires. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2011; p. 151 and ''passim''</ref> Milwaukee had a population of 594,833 by 2010, while the population of the overall metropolitan area increased. Given its large immigrant population and historic neighborhoods, Milwaukee avoided the severe declines of some of its fellow \"[[rust belt]]\" cities.\n\n[[File:Brady Street, Milwuakee, Wisconsin in 2007.jpg|thumb|Brady Street, Milwaukee]]\n\nSince the 1980s, the city has begun to make strides in improving its economy, neighborhoods, and image, resulting in the revitalization of neighborhoods such as the [[Historic Third Ward, Milwaukee|Historic Third Ward]], [[Lincoln Village, City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Lincoln Village]], the [[East Side, Milwaukee|East Side]], and more recently Walker's Point and [[Bay View, Milwaukee|Bay View]], along with attracting new businesses to its downtown area. These efforts have substantially slowed the population decline and have stabilized many parts of Milwaukee.\n\nMilwaukee's European history is evident today. Largely through its efforts to preserve its history, in 2006 Milwaukee was named one of the \"Dozen Distinctive Destinations\" by the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]].<ref name=\"distinctive\">{{cite web| url=http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/midwest-region/milwaukee-wi-2006.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222174953/http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/midwest-region/milwaukee-wi-2006.html| archivedate=February 22, 2010| title=Dozen Distinctive Destinations \u2013 Milwaukee| publisher=[[National Trust for Historic Preservation]]| year=2006}}</ref>\n\nHistoric Milwaukee walking tours provide a guided tour of Milwaukee's historic districts, including topics on Milwaukee's architectural heritage, its glass skywalk system, and the [[Milwaukee Riverwalk]].\n[[File:Milwaukee 05741u.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3.55|Panorama map of Milwaukee, with a view of the [[Milwaukee City Hall|City Hall]] tower, c. 1898]]\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Milwaukee aerial.jpg|thumb|Aerial view from the north \u2013 the [[Menomonee River]], [[Kinnickinnic River (Milwaukee River tributary)|Kinnickinnic River]], and [[Milwaukee River]] are visible in the foreground; [[Wind Point]] in the background.]]\n\nMilwaukee lies along the shores and bluffs of [[Lake Michigan]] at the confluence of three rivers: the [[Menomonee River|Menomonee]], the [[Kinnickinnic River (Milwaukee River)|Kinnickinnic]], and the [[Milwaukee River|Milwaukee]].

However, north\u2013south streets east of 1st Street are named, like east\u2013west streets. The north\u2013south numbering line is along the Menomonee River (east of Hawley Road) and Fairview Avenue/Golfview Parkway (west of Hawley Road), with the east\u2013west numbering line defined along 1st Street (north of Oklahoma Avenue) and Chase/Howell Avenue (south of Oklahoma Avenue). This numbering system is also used to the north by [[Mequon, Wisconsin|Mequon]] in [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|Ozaukee County]], and by some [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Waukesha County]] communities.\n\nMilwaukee is crossed by [[Interstate 43]] and [[Interstate 94]], which come together downtown at the [[Marquette Interchange]]. The [[Interstate 894]] bypass (which as of May 2015 also contains [[Interstate 41]]) runs through portions of the city's southwest side, and [[Interstate 794]] comes out of the Marquette interchange eastbound, bends south along the lakefront and crosses the harbor over the [[Hoan Bridge]], then ends near the [[Bay View, Milwaukee|Bay View]] [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee|neighborhood]] and becomes the \"Lake Parkway\" ([[Wisconsin Highway 794|WIS-794]]).\n\nOne of the distinctive traits of Milwaukee's residential areas are the neighborhoods full of so-called [[Polish flat]]s. These are two-[[family]] [[home]]s with separate entrances, but with the units stacked one on top of another instead of side-by-side. This arrangement enables a family of limited means to purchase both a home and a modestly priced [[rental]] [[apartment]] unit. Since [[Polish-American]] immigrants to the area prized land ownership, this solution, which was prominent in their areas of settlement within the city, came to be associated with them.\n\nThe tallest building in the city is the [[U.S. Bank Center (Milwaukee)|U.S. Bank Center]].\n\n===Climate===\nMilwaukee's location in the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes Region]] often has rapidly changing weather, producing a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfa''), with cold, windy, snowy winters, and warm, humid summers. The warmest month of the year is July, when the 24-hour average is {{convert|71.8|F|1}}, while January is the coldest month, with a 24-hour average of {{convert|22.3|F|1}}.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=004627| title=Historical Weather for Milwaukee, Wisconsin| publisher=Weatherbase| accessdate=October 2, 2006}}</ref>\n\nBecause of Milwaukee's proximity to Lake Michigan, a convection current forms around mid-afternoon in light wind, resulting in the so-called \"lake breeze\" \u2013 a smaller scale version of the more common [[sea breeze]]. The lake breeze is most common between the months of March and July. This onshore flow causes cooler temperatures to move inland usually {{convert|5|to|15|mi|0}}, with much warmer conditions persisting further inland. Because Milwaukee's official climate site, [[Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport]], is only {{convert|3|mi}} from the lake, seasonal temperature variations are less extreme than in many other locations of the [[Milwaukee metropolitan area]].\n\nAs the sun sets, the convection current reverses and an offshore flow ensues causing a land breeze. After a land breeze develops, warmer temperatures flow east toward the lakeshore, sometimes causing high temperatures during the late evening. The lake breeze is not a daily occurrence and will not usually form if a southwest, west, or northwest wind generally exceeds {{convert|15|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The lake moderates cold air outbreaks along the lakeshore during winter months.\n\nAside from the lake's influence, overnight lows in downtown Milwaukee year-round are often much warmer than suburban locations because of the [[urban heat island effect]]. Onshore winds elevate daytime [[relative humidity]] levels in Milwaukee as compared to inland locations nearby.\n\nThunderstorms in the region can be dangerous and damaging, bringing [[hail]] and high winds. In rare instances, they can bring a [[tornado]]. However, almost all summer rainfall in the city is brought by these storms. In spring and fall, longer events of prolonged, lighter rain bring most of the [[precipitation]]. A moderate snow cover can be seen on or linger for many winter days, but even during meteorological winter, on average, over 40% of days see less than {{convert|1|in|cm|1}} on the ground.<ref name=\"NOAA txt\" />\n\nMilwaukee tends to experience highs that are {{convert|90|\u00b0F|0}} on or above seven days per year, and lows at or below {{convert|0|\u00b0F|0}} on six to seven nights.<ref name=\"NOAA txt\" /> Extremes range from {{convert|105|F|C|abbr=on}} set on July 24, 1934 down to {{convert|\u221226|F|0}} on both January 17, 1982 and February 4, 1996.<ref name = NOAA /> The 1982 event, also known as [[Cold Sunday]], featured temperatures as low as {{convert|\u221240|\u00b0F|0}} in some of the [[suburb]]s as little as {{convert|10|mi}} to the north of Milwaukee.\n\n{{Milwaukee weatherbox}}\n\n===Water===\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, Lake Michigan experienced large [[algal bloom|algae blooms]], which can threaten aquatic life. Responding to this problem, in 2009 the city became an \"Innovating City\" in the [[United Nations Global Compact|Global Compact]] Cities Program.

Many of the new [[immigrants]] who were pouring into the new state of Wisconsin during the middle of the 19th century were wheat farmers. By 1860, Wisconsin was the second ranked [[wheat]]-growing state in the country and Milwaukee shipped more wheat than any place in the world. [[Rail transport|Railroads]] were needed to transport all this grain from the wheat fields of Wisconsin to Milwaukee's [[harbor]]. Improvements in railways at the time made this possible.\n\nThere was intense competition for markets with Chicago, and to a lesser degree, with [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]] and [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]]. Eventually Chicago won out due to its superior financial and transposition status, as well as being a hub on major railroad lines throughout the United States. Milwaukee did solidify its place as the commercial capital of Wisconsin and an important market in the Midwest.<ref name=\"milwaukeehistory.net\" />\n\n[[File:Menomonee Valley.jpg|thumb|[[Rail tracks]] along the industrial [[Menomonee Valley]], ancestral home of the [[Menominee]] Indians]]\nBecause of its easy access to Lake Michigan and other waterways, Milwaukee's [[Menomonee Valley]] has historically been home to [[manufacturing]], [[Meat packing industry|stockyards]], [[Rendering (food processing)|rendering plants]], [[shipping]], and other [[heavy industry]].\n\nReshaping of the valley began with the [[rail transport|railroads]] built by city co-founder [[Byron Kilbourn]] to bring product from Wisconsin's farm interior to the port. By 1862 Milwaukee was the largest shipper of [[wheat]] on the planet, and related industry developed. [[Grain elevator]]s were built and, due to Milwaukee's dominant [[German American|German immigrant population]], [[Brewery|breweries]] sprang up around the processing of [[barley]] and [[hops]]. A number of [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]] were constructed, of which the [[Pfister & Vogel]] tannery grew to become the largest in America.\n\nIn 1843 George Burnham and his brother Jonathan opened a [[brickyard]] near 16th Street. When a durable and distinct cream-colored brick came out of the clay beds, other brickyards sprang up to take advantage of this resource. Because many of the city's buildings were built using this material it earned the nickname \"Cream City\", and consequently the brick was called [[Cream City brick]]. By 1881 the Burnham brickyard, which employed 200 men and peaked at 15 million bricks a year, was the largest in the world.\n\n[[Gristmill|Flour mills]], packing plants, breweries, railways and tanneries further industrialized the valley. With the [[marsh]]lands drained and the [[Kinnickinnic River (Milwaukee River)|Kinnickinnic]] and [[Milwaukee River]]s dredged, attention turned to the valley.\n\nAlong with the processing industries, bulk commodity storage and machining and manufacturing entered the scene. The valley was home to the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]], [[Falk Corporation]], [[Cutler-Hammer]], [[Harnischfeger Corporation]], [[Chain Belt Company]], [[Nordberg Manufacturing Company]] and other industry giants.\n\nEarly in the 20th century, Milwaukee was home to several pioneer [[brass era]] [[automobile]] makers, including Ogren (1919\u20131922).<ref>{{cite book |last=Clymer |first=Floyd |title=Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877\u20131925 |location=New York |publisher=Bonanza Books |year=1950 |page=153 |isbn= }}</ref>\n\n===Brewing===\n{{further|Beer in Milwaukee}}\n\nMilwaukee became synonymous with [[Germans]] and [[beer]] beginning in the 1840s. The Germans had long enjoyed beer and set up breweries when they arrived in Milwaukee. By 1856, there were more than two dozen breweries in Milwaukee, most of them owned and operated by Germans. Besides making beer for the rest of the nation, Milwaukeeans enjoyed consuming the various beers produced in the city's breweries. As early as 1843, pioneer historian [[James Buck]] recorded 138 taverns in Milwaukee, an average of one per forty residents.

During the [[French and Indian War]], a group of \"Ojibwas and Pottawattamies from the far [Lake] Michigan\" (i.e., the area from Milwaukee to Green Bay) joined the French-Canadian [[Daniel Li\u00e9nard de Beaujeu]] at the [[Battle of the Monongahela]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=William|title=Empires at War|year=2005|publisher=Walker & Company |location=New York|page=68|isbn=9780802719355|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XqukoiTFL_oC&pg=PA68}}</ref> In the [[American Revolutionary War]], the Native Americans around Milwaukee were some of the few groups to ally with the rebel Continentals.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Richard|title=The Middle Ground|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|page=400|isbn=9781139495684|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fHLfiOZVzmMC&pg=PA400&lpg=PA400#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Revolutionary War, the Native Americans fought the United States in the [[Northwest Indian War]] as part of the [[Council of Three Fires]].

This resulted in the [[Battle of Fort Dearborn]] on August 15, 1812, the only known armed conflict in the Chicago area. This battle convinced the American government that the Native Americans had to be removed from their land. After being attacked in the [[Black Hawk War]] in 1832, the Native Americans in Milwaukee signed the [[Treaty of Chicago#1833 Treaty of Chicago|Treaty of Chicago]] with the United States in 1833.

French missionaries and traders first passed through the area in the late 17th and 18th centuries. Alexis Laframboise, in 1785, coming from Michilimackinac (now in Michigan) settled a trading post; and is considered the first resident of European descent in the Milwaukee region.<ref name=\"St-Pierre, T 1895\">St-Pierre, T.

Walker]]. Solomon Juneau was the first of the three to come to the area, in 1818. He founded a town called Juneau's Side, or Juneautown, that began attracting more settlers. In competition with Juneau, Byron Kilbourn established Kilbourntown west of the [[Milwaukee River]]. He ensured the roads running toward the river did not join with those on the east side. This accounts for the large number of angled bridges that still exist in Milwaukee today.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/bridges/|title=Bridges {{!}} Encyclopedia of Milwaukee|website=emke.uwm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-03}}</ref> Further, Kilbourn distributed maps of the area which only showed Kilbourntown, implying Juneautown did not exist or the river's east side was uninhabited and thus undesirable. The third prominent developer was George H. Walker. He claimed land to the south of the Milwaukee River, along with Juneautown, where he built a log house in 1834. This area grew and became known as Walker's Point.\n\nThe first large wave of settlement to the areas that would later become Milwaukee County and the City of Milwaukee began in 1835, following removal of the tribes in the Council of Three Fires. Early that year it became known that Juneau and Kilbourn intended to lay out competing town-sites. By the year's end both had purchased their lands from the government and made their first sales. There were perhaps 100 new settlers in this year, mostly from New England and other Eastern states. On September 17, 1835, the first election was held in Milwaukee; the number of votes cast was 39.<ref>{{Citation-attribution|{{Cite book|title = Memoirs of Milwaukee County from the Earliest Historical Times ..., Vol. I|last = Watrous|first = Jerome A.|publisher = Western Historical Association|year = 1909|url = https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:Jqsw4p18KfAC&id=XD4VAAAAYAAJ#v=onepage&q&f=false|location = Madison, Wisconsin|pages = 265\u2013267}}}}</ref>\n\nBy 1840, the three towns had grown, along with their rivalries. There were intense battles between the towns, mainly Juneautown and Kilbourntown, which culminated with the [[Milwaukee Bridge War]] of 1845. Following the Bridge War, town leaders decided the best course of action was to officially unite the towns. So, on January 31, 1846, they combined to incorporate as the City of Milwaukee and elected Solomon Juneau as Milwaukee's first mayor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://192.159.83.40/SOS/pdf/THEOSOS_025/images/00014104.pdf |title=City of Milwaukee Incorporated, page 164, 1846; page 314, 1851 |accessdate=April 8, 2007 |author=City of Milwaukee |publisher=Office of the Secretary of State of Wisconsin|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070605144656/http://192.159.83.40/SOS/pdf/THEOSOS_025/images/00014104.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = June 5, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Milwaukee birdseye map by Bailey (1872). loc call no g4124m-pm010450.jpg|thumb|Illustrated map of Milwaukee in 1872]]\n\nMilwaukee began to grow as a city as high numbers of immigrants, mainly [[Germans|German]], made their way to Wisconsin during the 1840s and 1850s. Scholars classify [[German immigration to the United States]] in three major waves, and Wisconsin received a significant number of immigrants from all three. The first wave from 1845 to 1855 consisted mainly of people from [[Southwestern Germany]], the second wave from 1865 to 1873 concerned primarily [[Northwestern Germany]], while the third wave from 1880 to 1893 came from [[Northeastern Germany]].<ref name=\"Bungert, Heike 2006\">Bungert, Heike, Cora Lee Kluge and Robert C.

In 1890, the 2.78 million first-generation German Americans represented the second-largest foreign-born group in the United States.

He later explained in 1854 why he came to Milwaukee, \n<blockquote>\"It is true, similar things [cultural events and societies] were done in other cities where the Forty-eighters {{sic}} had congregated.

The pattern of German immigrants to settle near each other encouraged the continuation of German lifestyle and customs. This resulted in [[German language]] organizations that encompassed all aspects of life; for example, singing societies and gymnastics clubs. Germans also had a lasting influence on the American school system. [[Kindergarten]] was created as a pre-school for children, and sports programs of all levels, as well as music and art were incorporated as elements of the regular school curriculum. These ideas were first introduced by radical-democratic German groups, such as the Socialist Turner Societies, known today as the [[American Turners]]. Specifically in Milwaukee, the American [[Turners]] established its own [[Normal College]] for teachers of physical education and a German-English Academy.<ref>Rippley, LaVern J. and Eberhard Reichmann, trans. \"The German Americans, An Ethnic Experience.\" [http://maxkade.iupui.edu/ Max Kade German-American Center] and [[Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis]].

The city celebrates its German culture by annually hosting a German Fest in July and an [[Oktoberfest]] in October.

Foremost among these were [[Polish people|Polish]] immigrants. The Poles had many reasons for leaving their homeland, mainly poverty and political oppression. Because Milwaukee offered the Polish immigrants an abundance of low-paying entry level jobs, it became one of the largest [[Polish settlements in the USA]].\n\n[[File:Flickr - \u2026trialsanderrors - Wisconsin Street, Milwaukee, 1900.jpg|thumb|Wisconsin Street with [[Pabst Building]], Milwaukee, 1900]]\n\nFor many residents, [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee#Milwaukee's South Side|Milwaukee's South Side]] is synonymous with the [[Milwaukee#Polish immigrants|Polish community]] that developed here. The group maintained a high profile here for decades, and it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that families began to disperse to the southern suburbs.\n\nBy 1850, there were seventy-five Poles in [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]] and the [[US Census]] shows they had a variety of occupations: grocers, blacksmiths, tavernkeepers, coopers, butchers, broommakers, shoemakers, draymen, laborers, and farmers. Three distinct Polish communities evolved in Milwaukee, with the majority settling in the area south of Greenfield Avenue. Milwaukee County's Polish population of 30,000 in 1890 rose to 100,000 by 1915. Poles historically have had a strong national cultural and social identity, maintained through the Catholic Church. A view of Milwaukee's South Side skyline is replete with the steeples of the many churches these immigrants built that are still vital centers of the community.\n\n[[St. Stanislaus Catholic Church (Milwaukee, Wisconsin)|St. Stanislaus Catholic Church]] and the surrounding [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee|neighborhood]] was the center of [[Polish people|Polish]] life in Milwaukee. As the Polish community surrounding St. Stanislaus continued to grow, Mitchell Street became known as the \"Polish Grand Avenue\". As Mitchell Street grew more dense, the Polish population started moving south to the [[Lincoln Village, City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Lincoln Village neighborhood]], home to the [[Basilica of St. Josaphat]] and [[Lincoln Village, City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin#Kosciuszko Park|Kosciuszko Park]].

Often referred to as \"[[Sewer Socialism|Sewer Socialists]]\", the Milwaukee Socialists were characterized by their practical approach to government and labor.\n\n===Historic neighborhoods===\n{{Main|Neighborhoods of Milwaukee}}\n[[File:Third Ward MKEa.jpg|thumb|The historic Third Ward]]\n\nIn 1892, [[Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin|Whitefish Bay]], [[South Milwaukee, Wisconsin|South Milwaukee]], and [[Wauwatosa, Wisconsin|Wauwatosa]] were incorporated. They were followed by [[Cudahy, Wisconsin|Cudahy]] (1895), North Milwaukee (1897) and East Milwaukee, later known as [[Shorewood, Wisconsin|Shorewood]], in 1900. In the early 20th century [[West Allis, Wisconsin|West Allis]] (1902), and [[West Milwaukee, Wisconsin|West Milwaukee]] (1906) were added, which completed the first generation of \"inner-ring\" suburbs.\n\nIn the 1920s [[Chicago]] gangster activity came north to Milwaukee during the [[Prohibition era]]. [[Al Capone]], noted Chicago mobster, owned a home in the Milwaukee suburb [[Brookfield, Wisconsin|Brookfield]], where [[moonshine]] was made. The house still stands on a street named after Capone.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.brookfieldnow.com/news/102435199.html |date=November 11, 2010 |title=It's everyday life that keeps local historian fascinated: But the Hollywood- worthy moments aren't bad, either? |author=Nan Bialek}}</ref>\n\nBy 1960, Milwaukee had grown to become one of the largest cities in the United States. Its population peaked at 741,324. In 1960, the Census Bureau reported city's population as 91.1% white and 8.4% black.<ref>{{cite web|title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archivedate=August 12, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nBy the late 1960s, Milwaukee's population had started to decline as people moved to suburbs, aided by federal subsidies of highways. They moved to take advantage of new housing.<ref>Glabere, Michael. \"Milwaukee:A Tale of Three Cities\" in, ''From Redlining to Reinvestment: Community Responses to Urban Disinvestment'' edited by Gregory D. Squires. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2011; p. 151 and ''passim''</ref> Milwaukee had a population of 594,833 by 2010, while the population of the overall metropolitan area increased. Given its large immigrant population and historic neighborhoods, Milwaukee avoided the severe declines of some of its fellow \"[[rust belt]]\" cities.\n\n[[File:Brady Street, Milwuakee, Wisconsin in 2007.jpg|thumb|Brady Street, Milwaukee]]\n\nSince the 1980s, the city has begun to make strides in improving its economy, neighborhoods, and image, resulting in the revitalization of neighborhoods such as the [[Historic Third Ward, Milwaukee|Historic Third Ward]], [[Lincoln Village, City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Lincoln Village]], the [[East Side, Milwaukee|East Side]], and more recently Walker's Point and [[Bay View, Milwaukee|Bay View]], along with attracting new businesses to its downtown area. These efforts have substantially slowed the population decline and have stabilized many parts of Milwaukee.\n\nMilwaukee's European history is evident today. Largely through its efforts to preserve its history, in 2006 Milwaukee was named one of the \"Dozen Distinctive Destinations\" by the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]].<ref name=\"distinctive\">{{cite web| url=http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/midwest-region/milwaukee-wi-2006.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222174953/http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/midwest-region/milwaukee-wi-2006.html| archivedate=February 22, 2010| title=Dozen Distinctive Destinations \u2013 Milwaukee| publisher=[[National Trust for Historic Preservation]]| year=2006}}</ref>\n\nHistoric Milwaukee walking tours provide a guided tour of Milwaukee's historic districts, including topics on Milwaukee's architectural heritage, its glass skywalk system, and the [[Milwaukee Riverwalk]].\n[[File:Milwaukee 05741u.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3.55|Panorama map of Milwaukee, with a view of the [[Milwaukee City Hall|City Hall]] tower, c. 1898]]\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Milwaukee aerial.jpg|thumb|Aerial view from the north \u2013 the [[Menomonee River]], [[Kinnickinnic River (Milwaukee River tributary)|Kinnickinnic River]], and [[Milwaukee River]] are visible in the foreground; [[Wind Point]] in the background.]]\n\nMilwaukee lies along the shores and bluffs of [[Lake Michigan]] at the confluence of three rivers: the [[Menomonee River|Menomonee]], the [[Kinnickinnic River (Milwaukee River)|Kinnickinnic]], and the [[Milwaukee River|Milwaukee]].

However, north\u2013south streets east of 1st Street are named, like east\u2013west streets. The north\u2013south numbering line is along the Menomonee River (east of Hawley Road) and Fairview Avenue/Golfview Parkway (west of Hawley Road), with the east\u2013west numbering line defined along 1st Street (north of Oklahoma Avenue) and Chase/Howell Avenue (south of Oklahoma Avenue). This numbering system is also used to the north by [[Mequon, Wisconsin|Mequon]] in [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|Ozaukee County]], and by some [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Waukesha County]] communities.\n\nMilwaukee is crossed by [[Interstate 43]] and [[Interstate 94]], which come together downtown at the [[Marquette Interchange]]. The [[Interstate 894]] bypass (which as of May 2015 also contains [[Interstate 41]]) runs through portions of the city's southwest side, and [[Interstate 794]] comes out of the Marquette interchange eastbound, bends south along the lakefront and crosses the harbor over the [[Hoan Bridge]], then ends near the [[Bay View, Milwaukee|Bay View]] [[Neighborhoods of Milwaukee|neighborhood]] and becomes the \"Lake Parkway\" ([[Wisconsin Highway 794|WIS-794]]).\n\nOne of the distinctive traits of Milwaukee's residential areas are the neighborhoods full of so-called [[Polish flat]]s. These are two-[[family]] [[home]]s with separate entrances, but with the units stacked one on top of another instead of side-by-side. This arrangement enables a family of limited means to purchase both a home and a modestly priced [[rental]] [[apartment]] unit. Since [[Polish-American]] immigrants to the area prized land ownership, this solution, which was prominent in their areas of settlement within the city, came to be associated with them.\n\nThe tallest building in the city is the [[U.S. Bank Center (Milwaukee)|U.S. Bank Center]].\n\n===Climate===\nMilwaukee's location in the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes Region]] often has rapidly changing weather, producing a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfa''), with cold, windy, snowy winters, and warm, humid summers. The warmest month of the year is July, when the 24-hour average is {{convert|71.8|F|1}}, while January is the coldest month, with a 24-hour average of {{convert|22.3|F|1}}.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=004627| title=Historical Weather for Milwaukee, Wisconsin| publisher=Weatherbase| accessdate=October 2, 2006}}</ref>\n\nBecause of Milwaukee's proximity to Lake Michigan, a convection current forms around mid-afternoon in light wind, resulting in the so-called \"lake breeze\" \u2013 a smaller scale version of the more common [[sea breeze]]. The lake breeze is most common between the months of March and July. This onshore flow causes cooler temperatures to move inland usually {{convert|5|to|15|mi|0}}, with much warmer conditions persisting further inland. Because Milwaukee's official climate site, [[Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport]], is only {{convert|3|mi}} from the lake, seasonal temperature variations are less extreme than in many other locations of the [[Milwaukee metropolitan area]].\n\nAs the sun sets, the convection current reverses and an offshore flow ensues causing a land breeze. After a land breeze develops, warmer temperatures flow east toward the lakeshore, sometimes causing high temperatures during the late evening. The lake breeze is not a daily occurrence and will not usually form if a southwest, west, or northwest wind generally exceeds {{convert|15|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The lake moderates cold air outbreaks along the lakeshore during winter months.\n\nAside from the lake's influence, overnight lows in downtown Milwaukee year-round are often much warmer than suburban locations because of the [[urban heat island effect]]. Onshore winds elevate daytime [[relative humidity]] levels in Milwaukee as compared to inland locations nearby.\n\nThunderstorms in the region can be dangerous and damaging, bringing [[hail]] and high winds. In rare instances, they can bring a [[tornado]]. However, almost all summer rainfall in the city is brought by these storms. In spring and fall, longer events of prolonged, lighter rain bring most of the [[precipitation]]. A moderate snow cover can be seen on or linger for many winter days, but even during meteorological winter, on average, over 40% of days see less than {{convert|1|in|cm|1}} on the ground.<ref name=\"NOAA txt\" />\n\nMilwaukee tends to experience highs that are {{convert|90|\u00b0F|0}} on or above seven days per year, and lows at or below {{convert|0|\u00b0F|0}} on six to seven nights.<ref name=\"NOAA txt\" /> Extremes range from {{convert|105|F|C|abbr=on}} set on July 24, 1934 down to {{convert|\u221226|F|0}} on both January 17, 1982 and February 4, 1996.<ref name = NOAA /> The 1982 event, also known as [[Cold Sunday]], featured temperatures as low as {{convert|\u221240|\u00b0F|0}} in some of the [[suburb]]s as little as {{convert|10|mi}} to the north of Milwaukee.\n\n{{Milwaukee weatherbox}}\n\n===Water===\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, Lake Michigan experienced large [[algal bloom|algae blooms]], which can threaten aquatic life. Responding to this problem, in 2009 the city became an \"Innovating City\" in the [[United Nations Global Compact|Global Compact]] Cities Program.

Many of the new [[immigrants]] who were pouring into the new state of Wisconsin during the middle of the 19th century were wheat farmers. By 1860, Wisconsin was the second ranked [[wheat]]-growing state in the country and Milwaukee shipped more wheat than any place in the world. [[Rail transport|Railroads]] were needed to transport all this grain from the wheat fields of Wisconsin to Milwaukee's [[harbor]]. Improvements in railways at the time made this possible.\n\nThere was intense competition for markets with Chicago, and to a lesser degree, with [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]] and [[Kenosha, Wisconsin|Kenosha]]. Eventually Chicago won out due to its superior financial and transposition status, as well as being a hub on major railroad lines throughout the United States. Milwaukee did solidify its place as the commercial capital of Wisconsin and an important market in the Midwest.<ref name=\"milwaukeehistory.net\" />\n\n[[File:Menomonee Valley.jpg|thumb|[[Rail tracks]] along the industrial [[Menomonee Valley]], ancestral home of the [[Menominee]] Indians]]\nBecause of its easy access to Lake Michigan and other waterways, Milwaukee's [[Menomonee Valley]] has historically been home to [[manufacturing]], [[Meat packing industry|stockyards]], [[Rendering (food processing)|rendering plants]], [[shipping]], and other [[heavy industry]].\n\nReshaping of the valley began with the [[rail transport|railroads]] built by city co-founder [[Byron Kilbourn]] to bring product from Wisconsin's farm interior to the port. By 1862 Milwaukee was the largest shipper of [[wheat]] on the planet, and related industry developed. [[Grain elevator]]s were built and, due to Milwaukee's dominant [[German American|German immigrant population]], [[Brewery|breweries]] sprang up around the processing of [[barley]] and [[hops]]. A number of [[Tanning (leather)|tanneries]] were constructed, of which the [[Pfister & Vogel]] tannery grew to become the largest in America.\n\nIn 1843 George Burnham and his brother Jonathan opened a [[brickyard]] near 16th Street. When a durable and distinct cream-colored brick came out of the clay beds, other brickyards sprang up to take advantage of this resource. Because many of the city's buildings were built using this material it earned the nickname \"Cream City\", and consequently the brick was called [[Cream City brick]]. By 1881 the Burnham brickyard, which employed 200 men and peaked at 15 million bricks a year, was the largest in the world.\n\n[[Gristmill|Flour mills]], packing plants, breweries, railways and tanneries further industrialized the valley. With the [[marsh]]lands drained and the [[Kinnickinnic River (Milwaukee River)|Kinnickinnic]] and [[Milwaukee River]]s dredged, attention turned to the valley.\n\nAlong with the processing industries, bulk commodity storage and machining and manufacturing entered the scene. The valley was home to the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]], [[Falk Corporation]], [[Cutler-Hammer]], [[Harnischfeger Corporation]], [[Chain Belt Company]], [[Nordberg Manufacturing Company]] and other industry giants.\n\nEarly in the 20th century, Milwaukee was home to several pioneer [[brass era]] [[automobile]] makers, including Ogren (1919\u20131922).<ref>{{cite book |last=Clymer |first=Floyd |title=Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877\u20131925 |location=New York |publisher=Bonanza Books |year=1950 |page=153 |isbn= }}</ref>\n\n===Brewing===\n{{further|Beer in Milwaukee}}\n\nMilwaukee became synonymous with [[Germans]] and [[beer]] beginning in the 1840s. The Germans had long enjoyed beer and set up breweries when they arrived in Milwaukee. By 1856, there were more than two dozen breweries in Milwaukee, most of them owned and operated by Germans. Besides making beer for the rest of the nation, Milwaukeeans enjoyed consuming the various beers produced in the city's breweries. As early as 1843, pioneer historian [[James Buck]] recorded 138 taverns in Milwaukee, an average of one per forty residents.
