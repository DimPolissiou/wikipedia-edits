The caption read \"An Israeli Policeman and a Palestinian on Temple Mount\". The picture was interpreted as depicting the Israelis as aggressors against Palestinian children and was used in an official Egyptian government website, in the Palestinian information center website www.islam.net and on online calls to boycott [[Coca-Cola]] for doing business with Israel.<ref name=start>[https://honestreporting.com/the-photo-that-started-it-all/ The Photo that Started it All] HonestReporting website about page, updated February 2012.</ref> In fact, the picture was of an American Jewish boy, Tuvia Grossman, being saved by the Israeli soldiers from a lynch by a mob in the Arab Neighborhood of [[Wadi Joz]] in East Jerusalem, during [[Yom Kippur]], at the onset of the [[Second Intifada]].<ref name=started /> The boy's father sent a letter to the New York Times, but the caption was at first only partly corrected. The email list called for the readers to personally participate in getting the editors to show the facts, urging the readers to first carefully read the article and decide for themselves, and then to respond factually and correctly in their own words. The readers were also urged to send in similar news coverage that was infactual or written in a biased way. The list reported about success cases, the first being the full correction of the first article by the New York Times and the publication of the ordeal the boy actually went through.<ref name=start /><ref>[https://www.aish.com/jw/id/48890577.html Victim of the Media War] Tuvia Grossman's account of his ordeal (Aish website)</ref>\n\nBy 2003 the list had 150,000 subscribers and began raising funds for it to become an independent organization.

The London-based paper then stated that according to its style guide, Tel Aviv is the country's capital. Indeed, the style guide at the time stated that designating Jerusalem as the capital is \"a mistake we have made more than once.\"\n\nAfter the Guardian's April correction\u2014published after the paper ran a caption on a photo showing passengers on a train observing a two-minute silence for Holocaust Remembrance Day\u2014Honest Reporting filed a complaint with the Press Complaints Commission.\n\nThe PCC, a non-governmental regulatory body which has the power to force publications to run corrections, initially defended the Guardian's position to call Tel Aviv Israel's capital, writing in its May ruling that \"many countries\" don't recognize Israel's classification of Jerusalem as its capital and that \"those nations enjoying diplomatic relations with Israel have their embassies in Tel Aviv.\" Therefore, the PCC wrote, the ''Guardian'' \"was entitled to refer to Tel Aviv as the capital of Israel. There was no breach of the code in this instance.\"\n\nAccording to Honest Reporting, whose stated mission is \"defending Israel from media bias,\" the London-based PCC ruling was flawed and had the \"potential to further delegitimize Jerusalem's status as Israel's capital, giving the British media a carte blanche to follow ''The Guardian''{{'}}s lead.\" Therefore, Honest Reporting initiated steps to file for a judicial review of the decision, leading the PCC in July to retract its original ruling and to ask the Guardian to defend their position\u2014which culminated in Wednesday's correction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/guardian-admits-we-were-wrong-in-calling-tel-aviv-israels-capital/|title=Guardian: We were wrong to call Tel Aviv Israel's capital |website=The Times of Israel|access-date=2016-05-24}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe PCC later overturned its original decision, concluding that \"the unequivocal statement that Tel Aviv is the capital of Israel had the potential to mislead readers and raised a breach of \u2026 the Editors' Code of Practice.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/uk-media-watchdog-rules-its-wrong-to-call-tel-aviv-israels-capital/|title=UK media watchdog rules: Tel Aviv is not the capital|website=The Times of Israel|access-date=2016-05-24}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n\nThe [[American Journalism Review]] described the organisation as a \"pro-Israeli pressure group\".<ref name=\"Hons\">{{cite web | url=http://www.ajr.org/article.asp?id=3683 | title=Caught in the Crossfire | publisher=American Journalism Review | date=June\u2013July 2004 | accessdate=March 14, 2012 | author=Matusow, Barbara | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613032218/http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=3683 | archive-date=June 13, 2010 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter being criticized by HonestReporting for articles published by ''[[The Independent]]'', author [[Robert Fisk]] wrote in the ''Independent'' that some of their readers sent him hate-mail.<ref>{{Citation\n | last = Fisk\n | first = Robert\n | date = 28 May 2001\n | title = The internet threat to truly honest reporting\n | periodical = [[The Independent]]\n | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/robert--fisk-the-internet-threat-to-truly-honest-reporting-686255.html\n | accessdate = 2011-03-03\n}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a 2004 article published in the [[British Medical Journal]] which criticised Israel for a high level of Palestinian civilian casualties and claimed that the pattern of injuries suggested routine targeting of children in situations of minimal or no threat, the journal received over 500 responses to its website and nearly 1,000 sent directly to its editor.

The caption read \"An Israeli Policeman and a Palestinian on Temple Mount\". The picture was interpreted as depicting the Israelis as aggressors against Palestinian children and was used in an official Egyptian government website, in the Palestinian information center website www.islam.net and on online calls to boycott [[Coca-Cola]] for doing business with Israel.<ref name=start>[https://honestreporting.com/the-photo-that-started-it-all/ The Photo that Started it All] HonestReporting website about page, updated February 2012.</ref> In fact, the picture was of an American Jewish boy, Tuvia Grossman, being saved by the Israeli soldiers from a lynch by a mob in the Arab Neighborhood of [[Wadi Joz]] in East Jerusalem, during [[Yom Kippur]], at the onset of the [[Second Intifada]].<ref name=started /> The boy's father sent a letter to the New York Times, but the caption was at first only partly corrected. The email list called for the readers to personally participate in getting the editors to show the facts, urging the readers to first carefully read the article and decide for themselves, and then to respond factually and correctly in their own words. The readers were also urged to send in similar news coverage that was infactual or written in a biased way. The list reported about success cases, the first being the full correction of the first article by the New York Times and the publication of the ordeal the boy actually went through.<ref name=start /><ref>[https://www.aish.com/jw/id/48890577.html Victim of the Media War] Tuvia Grossman's account of his ordeal (Aish website)</ref>\n\nBy 2003 the list had 150,000 subscribers and began raising funds for it to become an independent organization.

The London-based paper then stated that according to its style guide, Tel Aviv is the country's capital. Indeed, the style guide at the time stated that designating Jerusalem as the capital is \"a mistake we have made more than once.\"\n\nAfter the Guardian's April correction\u2014published after the paper ran a caption on a photo showing passengers on a train observing a two-minute silence for Holocaust Remembrance Day\u2014Honest Reporting filed a complaint with the Press Complaints Commission.\n\nThe PCC, a non-governmental regulatory body which has the power to force publications to run corrections, initially defended the Guardian's position to call Tel Aviv Israel's capital, writing in its May ruling that \"many countries\" don't recognize Israel's classification of Jerusalem as its capital and that \"those nations enjoying diplomatic relations with Israel have their embassies in Tel Aviv.\" Therefore, the PCC wrote, the ''Guardian'' \"was entitled to refer to Tel Aviv as the capital of Israel. There was no breach of the code in this instance.\"\n\nAccording to Honest Reporting, whose stated mission is \"defending Israel from media bias,\" the London-based PCC ruling was flawed and had the \"potential to further delegitimize Jerusalem's status as Israel's capital, giving the British media a carte blanche to follow ''The Guardian''{{'}}s lead.\" Therefore, Honest Reporting initiated steps to file for a judicial review of the decision, leading the PCC in July to retract its original ruling and to ask the Guardian to defend their position\u2014which culminated in Wednesday's correction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/guardian-admits-we-were-wrong-in-calling-tel-aviv-israels-capital/|title=Guardian: We were wrong to call Tel Aviv Israel's capital |website=The Times of Israel|access-date=2016-05-24}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe PCC later overturned its original decision, concluding that \"the unequivocal statement that Tel Aviv is the capital of Israel had the potential to mislead readers and raised a breach of \u2026 the Editors' Code of Practice.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/uk-media-watchdog-rules-its-wrong-to-call-tel-aviv-israels-capital/|title=UK media watchdog rules: Tel Aviv is not the capital|website=The Times of Israel|access-date=2016-05-24}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n\nThe [[American Journalism Review]] described the organisation as a \"pro-Israeli pressure group\".<ref name=\"Hons\">{{cite web | url=http://www.ajr.org/article.asp?id=3683 | title=Caught in the Crossfire | publisher=American Journalism Review | date=June\u2013July 2004 | accessdate=March 14, 2012 | author=Matusow, Barbara | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613032218/http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=3683 | archive-date=June 13, 2010 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter being criticized by HonestReporting for articles published by ''[[The Independent]]'', author [[Robert Fisk]] wrote in the ''Independent'' that some of their readers sent him hate-mail.<ref>{{Citation\n | last = Fisk\n | first = Robert\n | date = 28 May 2001\n | title = The internet threat to truly honest reporting\n | periodical = [[The Independent]]\n | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/robert--fisk-the-internet-threat-to-truly-honest-reporting-686255.html\n | accessdate = 2011-03-03\n}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a 2004 article published in the [[British Medical Journal]] which criticised Israel for a high level of Palestinian civilian casualties and claimed that the pattern of injuries suggested routine targeting of children in situations of minimal or no threat, the journal received over 500 responses to its website and nearly 1,000 sent directly to its editor.

{"title_page": "Thin film", "text_new": "{{about|a thin layer of material|magnetic thin film memory|Thin-film memory}}\n{{Use American English|date=August 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2017}}\nA '''thin film''' is a  layer of material ranging from fractions of a [[nanometer]] ([[monolayer]]) to several [[micrometre|micrometer]]s in thickness. The controlled synthesis of materials as  thin films (a process referred to as deposition) is a fundamental step in many applications. A familiar example is the household [[mirror]], which typically has a thin metal coating on the back of a sheet of glass to form a reflective interface. The process of [[silvering]] was once commonly used to produce mirrors, while more recently the metal layer is deposited using techniques such as [[sputtering]]. Advances in thin film deposition techniques during the 20th century have enabled a wide range of technological breakthroughs in areas such as [[Magnetic media|magnetic recording media]], [[Semiconductor device|electronic semiconductor devices]], [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]], [[optical coating]]s (such as [[antireflective]] coatings), hard coatings on cutting tools, and for both energy generation (e.g.  [[thin-film solar cell]]s) and storage ([[Thin-film battery|thin-film batteries]]). It is also being applied to pharmaceuticals, via [[thin-film drug delivery]]. A stack of thin films is called a [[multilayer]].\n\nIn addition to their applied interest, thin films play an important role in the development and study of materials with new and unique properties. Examples include [[multiferroics|multiferroic materials]], and [[superlattice]]s that allow the study of quantum phenomena.\n\n==Deposition==\nThe act of applying a thin film to a surface is ''thin-film deposition'' \u2013 any technique for depositing a thin film of material onto a [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] or onto previously deposited layers. \"Thin\" is a relative term, but most deposition techniques control layer thickness within a few tens of [[nanometre]]s.

Similar processes are sometimes used where thickness is not important: for instance, the purification of copper by [[electroplating]], and the deposition of [[silicon]] and enriched [[uranium]] by a [[Chemical vapor deposition|CVD]]-like process after gas-phase processing.\n\nDeposition techniques fall into two broad categories, depending on whether the process is primarily [[chemistry|chemical]] or [[physics|physical]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Knoll |editor1-first=Wolfgang Knoll |editor2-last=Advincula |editor2-first=Rigoberto C. |date=2011-06-07 |title=Functional Polymer Films, 2 Volume Set 1st Edition |url= |location= |publisher=Wiley-VCH |page= |isbn=978-3527321902 |author-link=}}</ref>\n\n===Chemical deposition===\nHere, a fluid [[wikt:Precursor|precursor]] undergoes a chemical change at a solid surface, leaving a solid layer. An everyday example is the formation of soot on a cool object when it is placed inside a flame. Since the fluid surrounds the solid object, deposition happens on every surface, with little regard to direction; thin films from chemical deposition techniques tend to be ''[[conformal film|conformal]]'', rather than ''directional''.\n\nChemical deposition is further categorized by the phase of the precursor:\n\n[[Plating]] relies on liquid precursors, often a solution of water with a salt of the metal to be deposited. Some plating processes are driven entirely by [[reagent]]s in the solution (usually for [[noble metal]]s), but by far the most commercially important process is [[electroplating]]. It was not commonly used in semiconductor processing for many years, but has seen a resurgence with more widespread use of [[chemical-mechanical polishing]] techniques.\n\n[[Sol-gel|Chemical solution deposition]] (CSD) or [[chemical bath deposition]] (CBD) uses a liquid precursor, usually a solution of [[organometallic]] powders dissolved in an organic solvent. This is a relatively inexpensive, simple thin-film process that produces stoichiometrically accurate crystalline phases. This technique is also known as the '''[[sol-gel]]''' method because the 'sol' (or solution) gradually evolves towards the formation of a gel-like diphasic system.\n\n[[Langmuir\u2013Blodgett film|Langmuir-Blodgett]] method uses molecules floating on top of an aqueous subphase. The packing density of molecules is controlled, and the packed monolayer is transferred on a solid substrate by controlled withdrawal of the solid substrate from the subphase. This allows creating thin films of various molecules such as nanoparticles, polymers and lipids with controlled particle packing density and layer thickness.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Ariga |first1 = Katsuhiko |last2 = Yamauchi |first2 = Yusuke |last3 = Mori |first3 = Taizo |last4 = Hill |first4 = Jonathan P. |year = 2013 |title = 25th Anniversary Article: What Can Be Done with the Langmuir-Blodgett Method?

The speed at which the solution is spun and the [[viscosity]] of the sol determine the ultimate thickness of the deposited film. Repeated depositions can be carried out to increase the thickness of films as desired. Thermal treatment is often carried out in order to crystallize the amorphous spin coated film. Such crystalline films can exhibit certain preferred orientations after crystallization on single [[crystal]] substrates.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hanaor |first1=D.A.H. |last2=Triani |first2=G. |last3=Sorrell |first3=C.C. |date=2011-03-15 |title=Morphology and photocatalytic activity of highly oriented mixed phase titanium dioxide thin films |journal=Surface and Coatings Technology |volume=205 |issue=12 |pages=3658\u20133664 |doi=10.1016/j.surfcoat.2011.01.007 |arxiv=1303.2741 }}</ref>\n\n[[Dip-coating|Dip coating]] is similar to spin coating in that a liquid precursor or sol-gel precursor is deposited on a substrate, but in this case the substrate is completely submerged in the solution and then withdrawn under controlled conditions. By controlling the withdrawal speed, the evaporation conditions (principally the humidity, temperature) and the volatility/viscosity of the solvent, the film thickness, homogeneity and nanoscopic morphology are controlled. There are two evaporation regimes: the capillary zone at very low withdrawal speeds, and the draining zone at faster evaporation speeds.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Faustini |first1=Marco |last2=Drisko |first2=Glenna L |last3=Boissiere |first3=Cedric |last4=Grosso |first4=David |date=2014-03-01 |title=Liquid deposition approaches to self-assembled periodic nanomasks |url= |journal=Scripta Materialia |volume=74 |issue= |pages=13\u201318 |doi=10.1016/j.scriptamat.2013.07.029 |access-date= }}</ref>\n  \n[[Chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD) generally uses a gas-phase precursor, often a [[halide]] or [[hydride]] of the element to be deposited. In the case of [[Metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy|MOCVD]], an [[organometallic]] gas is used. Commercial techniques often use very low pressures of precursor gas.\n\n[[Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition|Plasma enhanced CVD]] (PECVD) uses an ionized vapor, or [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], as a precursor. Unlike the soot example above, commercial PECVD relies on electromagnetic means (electric current, [[microwave]] excitation), rather than a chemical-reaction, to produce a plasma.\n\n[[Atomic layer deposition]] (ALD), and its sister technique [[Molecular layer deposition|molecular layer deposition]] (MLD), uses gaseous precursor to deposit [[conformal film|conformal]] thin films one layer at a time.  The process is split up into two half reactions, run in sequence and repeated for each layer, in order to ensure total layer saturation before beginning the next layer.  Therefore, one reactant is deposited first, and then the second reactant is deposited, during which a chemical reaction occurs on the substrate, forming the desired composition.  As a result of the stepwise, the process is slower than CVD, however it can be run at low temperatures, unlike CVD.\n\n===Physical deposition===\nPhysical deposition uses mechanical, electromechanical or thermodynamic means to produce a thin film of solid. An everyday example is the formation of [[frost]]. Since most engineering materials are held together by relatively high energies, and chemical reactions are not used to store these energies, commercial physical deposition systems tend to require a low-pressure vapor environment to function properly; most can be classified as [[physical vapor deposition]] (PVD).\n\nThe material to be deposited is placed in an [[energy|energetic]], [[entropy|entropic]] environment, so that particles of material escape its surface. Facing this source is a cooler surface which draws energy from these particles as they arrive, allowing them to form a solid layer. The whole system is kept in a vacuum deposition chamber, to allow the particles to travel as freely as possible. Since particles tend to follow a straight path, films deposited by physical means are commonly ''directional'', rather than ''conformal''.\n\nExamples of physical deposition include:\nA thermal [[evaporation (deposition)|evaporator]] that uses an electric resistance heater to melt the material and raise its vapor pressure to a useful range. This is done in a high vacuum, both to allow the vapor to reach the substrate without reacting with or [[scattering]] against other gas-phase atoms in the chamber, and reduce the incorporation of impurities from the residual gas in the vacuum chamber. Obviously, only materials with a much higher [[vapor pressure]] than the [[heating element]] can be deposited without contamination of the film. [[Molecular beam epitaxy]] is a particularly sophisticated form of thermal evaporation.\n\nAn [[electron beam physical vapor deposition|electron beam evaporator]] fires a high-energy beam from an [[electron gun]] to boil a small spot of material; since the heating is not uniform, lower [[vapor pressure]] materials can be deposited. The beam is usually bent through an angle of 270\u00b0 in order to ensure that the gun filament is not directly exposed to the evaporant flux. Typical deposition rates for electron beam evaporation range from 1 to 10 nanometres per second.\n\nIn [[molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE), slow streams of an element can be directed at the substrate, so that material deposits one atomic layer at a time. Compounds such as [[gallium arsenide]] are usually deposited by repeatedly applying a layer of one element (i.e., [[gallium]]), then a layer of the other (i.e., [[arsenic]]), so that the process is chemical, as well as physical; this is known also as [[atomic layer deposition]]. If the precursors in use are organic, then the technique is called [[Molecular layer deposition|molecular layer deposition]]. The beam of material can be generated by either physical means (that is, by a [[furnace]]) or by a chemical reaction ([[chemical beam epitaxy]]).\n\n[[Sputtering]] relies on a plasma (usually a [[noble gas]], such as [[argon]]) to knock material from a \"target\" a few atoms at a time. The target can be kept at a relatively low temperature, since the process is not one of evaporation, making this one of the most flexible deposition techniques. It is especially useful for compounds or mixtures, where different components would otherwise tend to evaporate at different rates. Note, sputtering's step coverage is more or less conformal. It is also widely used in optical media. The manufacturing of all formats of CD, DVD, and BD are done with the help of this technique. It is a fast technique and also it provides a good thickness control.  Presently, nitrogen and oxygen gases are also being used in sputtering.\n\n[[Pulsed laser deposition]] systems work by an [[ablation]] process. Pulses of focused [[laser]] light vaporize the surface of the target material and convert it to plasma; this plasma usually reverts to a gas before it reaches the substrate.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rashidian Vaziri |first1=M.

The arc has an extremely high [[power density]] resulting in a high level of [[ionization]] (30\u2013100%), multiply charged ions, neutral particles, clusters and macro-particles (droplets). If a reactive gas is introduced during the evaporation process, [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]], [[ionization]] and [[Excited state|excitation]] can occur during interaction with the [[ion flux]] and a compound film will be deposited.\n\n[[Electrohydrodynamic]] deposition (electrospray deposition) is a relatively new process of thin-film deposition. The liquid to be deposited, either in the form of nanoparticle solution or simply a solution, is fed to a small capillary nozzle (usually metallic) which is connected to a high voltage. The substrate on which the film has to be deposited is connected to ground. Through the influence of electric field, the liquid coming out of the [[nozzle]] takes a conical shape ([[Taylor cone]]) and at the apex of the cone a thin jet emanates which disintegrates into very fine and small positively charged droplets under the influence of Rayleigh charge limit. The droplets keep getting smaller and smaller and ultimately get deposited on the substrate as a uniform thin layer.\n\n===Growth modes===\n[[Image:Frank-van-der-Merwe-Modus.svg|thumb|Frank-van-der-Merwe mode]]\n[[Image:Stranski-Krastanow-Modus.svg|thumb|Stranski-Krastanow mode]]\n[[Image:Volmer-Weber-Modus.svg|thumb|Volmer-Weber mode]]\n\n[[Frank-van der Merwe growth]]<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Frank | first1 = Frederick Charles | last2 = van der Merwe | first2 = J.

The term epitaxy comes from the Greek roots epi (\u1f10\u03c0\u03af), meaning \"above\", and taxis (\u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b9\u03c2), meaning \"an ordered manner\". It can be translated as \"arranging upon\".\n\nThe term '''homoepitaxy''' refers to the specific case in which a film of the same material is grown on a crystalline\nsubstrate. This technology is used, for instance, to grow a film which is more pure than the substrate, has a lower density\nof defects, and to fabricate layers having different doping levels. '''Heteroepitaxy''' refers to the case in which the film being deposited is different than the substrate.\n\nTechniques used for epitaxial growth of thin films include [[molecular beam epitaxy]], [[chemical vapor deposition]],\nand [[pulsed laser deposition]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rashidian Vaziri |first1=M.

This encompasses ca. 100&nbsp;nm thin [[gold leaf]]s that were already used in ancient India more than 5000 years ago. It may also be understood as any form of painting, although this kind of work is generally considered as an arts craft rather than an engineering or scientific discipline. Today, thin-film materials of variable thickness and high [[refractive index]] like [[titanium dioxide]] are often applied for decorative coatings on glass for instance, causing a rainbow-color appearance like oil on water. In addition, intransparent gold-colored surfaces may either be prepared by sputtering of gold or [[titanium nitride]].\n\n=== Optical coatings ===\n{{Further|Optical coating}}\n\nThese layers serve in both reflective and [[refraction|refractive]] systems. Large-area (reflective) [[mirror]]s became available during the 19th century and were produced by sputtering of metallic silver or aluminum on glass. Refractive lenses for optical instruments like cameras and microscopes typically exhibit [[optical aberration|aberrations]], i.e. non-ideal refractive behavior. While large sets of lenses had to be lined up along the optical path previously, nowadays, the coating of optical lenses with transparent [[optical coating|multilayers]] of titanium dioxide, [[silicon nitride]] or silicon oxide etc. may correct these aberrations. A well-known example for the progress in optical systems by thin-film technology is represented by the only a few mm wide lens in [[camera phone|smart phone cameras]]. Other examples are given by anti-reflection coatings on eyeglasses or [[solar panels]].\n\n===Protective coatings===\nThin films are often deposited to protect an underlying work piece from external influences. The protection may operate by minimizing the contact with the exterior medium in order to reduce the diffusion from the medium to the work piece or vice versa. For instance, plastic lemonade bottles are frequently coated by anti-diffusion layers to avoid the out-diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub>, into which carbonic acid decomposes that was introduced into the beverage under high pressure. Another example is represented by thin [[titanium nitride|TiN]] films in [[integrated circuit|microelectronic chips]] separating electrically conducting aluminum lines from the embedding insulator SiO<sub>2</sub> in order to suppress the formation of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Often, thin films serve as protection against [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] between mechanically moving parts. Examples for the latter application are [[diamond-like carbon]] (DLC) layers used in car engines or thin films made of [[nanocomposites]].\n\n===Electrically operating coatings===\n[[File:MxSnake.png|upright|thumb|right|Laterally structured metal layer of an integrated circuit<ref name= SCT2010 />]]\nThin layers from elemental metals like copper, aluminum, gold or silver etc. and alloys have found numerous applications in electrical devices. Due to their high [[electrical conductivity]] they are able to transport electrical currents or supply voltages. Thin metal layers serve in conventional electrical system, for instance, as Cu layers on [[printed circuit boards]], as the outer ground conductor in [[coaxial cable]]s and various other forms like sensors etc.<ref>{{cite book |last=Korotcenkov |first=Ghenadii |date=2013-09-18 |chapter=Thin metal films |title=Handbook of Gas Sensor Materials: Properties, Advantages and Shortcomings for Applications |series=Integrated Analytical Systems |chapter-url= |location= |publisher=Springer |pages=153\u2013166 |isbn=978-1461471646 |author-link=}}</ref> A major field of application became their use in [[integrated circuits]], where the electrical network among active and passive devices like [[transistors]] and capacitors etc. is built up from thin Al or Cu layers.

The rationale for this is [[thin-film solar cell]]s are cheaper to manufacture owing to their reduced material costs, energy costs, handling costs and capital costs. This is especially represented in the use of [[printed electronics]] ([[roll-to-roll]]) processes. Other thin-film technologies, that are still in an early stage of ongoing research or with limited commercial availability, are often classified as emerging or [[third generation photovoltaic cell]]s and include, [[Organic solar cell|organic]], [[Dye-sensitized solar cell|dye-sensitized]], and [[polymer solar cell]]s, as well as [[Quantum dot solar cell|quantum dot]], [[Copper zinc tin sulfide solar cell|copper zinc tin sulfide]], [[Nanocrystal solar cell|nanocrystal]] and [[perovskite solar cell]]s.\n\n===Thin-film batteries===\n[[Coating|Thin-film printing technology]] is being used to apply solid-state [[lithium polymer]]s to a variety of [[Substrate (printing)|substrates]] to create unique batteries for specialized applications.

The controlled synthesis of materials as  thin films (a process referred to as deposition) is a fundamental step in many applications. A familiar example is the household [[mirror]], which typically has a thin metal coating on the back of a sheet of glass to form a reflective interface. The process of [[silvering]] was once commonly used to produce mirrors, while more recently the metal layer is deposited using techniques such as [[sputtering]]. Advances in thin film deposition techniques during the 20th century have enabled a wide range of technological breakthroughs in areas such as [[Magnetic media|magnetic recording media]], [[Semiconductor device|electronic semiconductor devices]], [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]], [[optical coating]]s (such as [[antireflective]] coatings), hard coatings on cutting tools, and for both energy generation (e.g.  [[thin-film solar cell]]s) and storage ([[Thin-film battery|thin-film batteries]]). It is also being applied to pharmaceuticals, via [[thin-film drug delivery]]. A stack of thin films is called a [[multilayer]].\n\nIn addition to their applied interest, thin films play an important role in the development and study of materials with new and unique properties. Examples include [[multiferroics|multiferroic materials]], and [[superlattice]]s that allow the study of quantum phenomena.\n\n==Deposition==\nThe act of applying a thin film to a surface is ''thin-film deposition'' \u2013 any technique for depositing a thin film of material onto a [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] or onto previously deposited layers. \"Thin\" is a relative term, but most deposition techniques control layer thickness within a few tens of [[nanometre]]s. [[Molecular beam epitaxy]], [[Langmuir\u2013Blodgett film|Langmuir-Blodgett method]], [[atomic layer deposition]] and [[Molecular layer deposition|molecular layer deposition]] allow a single layer of [[atom]]s or molecules to be deposited at a time.\n\nIt is useful in the manufacture of [[optics]] (for [[Reflection (physics)|reflective]], [[anti-reflective coating]]s or [[self-cleaning glass]], for instance), [[electronics]] (layers of [[Electrical insulation|insulator]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, and [[conductor (material)|conductor]]s form [[integrated circuits]]), [[packaging]] (i.e., [[metallized polyethylene terephthalate|aluminium-coated PET film]]), and in [[contemporary art]] (see the work of [[Larry bell (artist)|Larry Bell]]). Similar processes are sometimes used where thickness is not important: for instance, the purification of copper by [[electroplating]], and the deposition of [[silicon]] and enriched [[uranium]] by a [[Chemical vapor deposition|CVD]]-like process after gas-phase processing.\n\nDeposition techniques fall into two broad categories, depending on whether the process is primarily [[chemistry|chemical]] or [[physics|physical]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Knoll |editor1-first=Wolfgang Knoll |editor2-last=Advincula |editor2-first=Rigoberto C. |date=2011-06-07 |title=Functional Polymer Films, 2 Volume Set 1st Edition |url= |location= |publisher=Wiley-VCH |page= |isbn=978-3527321902 |author-link=}}</ref>\n\n===Chemical deposition===\nHere, a fluid [[wikt:Precursor|precursor]] undergoes a chemical change at a solid surface, leaving a solid layer.

It was not commonly used in semiconductor processing for many years, but has seen a resurgence with more widespread use of [[chemical-mechanical polishing]] techniques.\n\n[[Sol-gel|Chemical solution deposition]] (CSD) or [[chemical bath deposition]] (CBD) uses a liquid precursor, usually a solution of [[organometallic]] powders dissolved in an organic solvent. This is a relatively inexpensive, simple thin-film process that produces stoichiometrically accurate crystalline phases. This technique is also known as the '''[[sol-gel]]''' method because the 'sol' (or solution) gradually evolves towards the formation of a gel-like diphasic system.\n\n[[Langmuir\u2013Blodgett film|Langmuir-Blodgett]] method uses molecules floating on top of an aqueous subphase. The packing density of molecules is controlled, and the packed monolayer is transferred on a solid substrate by controlled withdrawal of the solid substrate from the subphase. This allows creating thin films of various molecules such as nanoparticles, polymers and lipids with controlled particle packing density and layer thickness.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Ariga |first1 = Katsuhiko |last2 = Yamauchi |first2 = Yusuke |last3 = Mori |first3 = Taizo |last4 = Hill |first4 = Jonathan P. |year = 2013 |title = 25th Anniversary Article: What Can Be Done with the Langmuir-Blodgett Method?

The speed at which the solution is spun and the [[viscosity]] of the sol determine the ultimate thickness of the deposited film. Repeated depositions can be carried out to increase the thickness of films as desired. Thermal treatment is often carried out in order to crystallize the amorphous spin coated film. Such crystalline films can exhibit certain preferred orientations after crystallization on single [[crystal]] substrates.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hanaor |first1=D.A.H. |last2=Triani |first2=G. |last3=Sorrell |first3=C.C. |date=2011-03-15 |title=Morphology and photocatalytic activity of highly oriented mixed phase titanium dioxide thin films |journal=Surface and Coatings Technology |volume=205 |issue=12 |pages=3658\u20133664 |doi=10.1016/j.surfcoat.2011.01.007 |arxiv=1303.2741 }}</ref>\n\n[[Dip-coating|Dip coating]] is similar to spin coating in that a liquid precursor or sol-gel precursor is deposited on a substrate, but in this case the substrate is completely submerged in the solution and then withdrawn under controlled conditions. By controlling the withdrawal speed, the evaporation conditions (principally the humidity, temperature) and the volatility/viscosity of the solvent, the film thickness, homogeneity and nanoscopic morphology are controlled. There are two evaporation regimes: the capillary zone at very low withdrawal speeds, and the draining zone at faster evaporation speeds.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Faustini |first1=Marco |last2=Drisko |first2=Glenna L |last3=Boissiere |first3=Cedric |last4=Grosso |first4=David |date=2014-03-01 |title=Liquid deposition approaches to self-assembled periodic nanomasks |url= |journal=Scripta Materialia |volume=74 |issue= |pages=13\u201318 |doi=10.1016/j.scriptamat.2013.07.029 |access-date= }}</ref>\n  \n[[Chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD) generally uses a gas-phase precursor, often a [[halide]] or [[hydride]] of the element to be deposited. In the case of [[Metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy|MOCVD]], an [[organometallic]] gas is used. Commercial techniques often use very low pressures of precursor gas.\n\n[[Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition|Plasma enhanced CVD]] (PECVD) uses an ionized vapor, or [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], as a precursor. Unlike the soot example above, commercial PECVD relies on electromagnetic means (electric current, [[microwave]] excitation), rather than a chemical-reaction, to produce a plasma.\n\n[[Atomic layer deposition]] (ALD), and its sister technique [[Molecular layer deposition|molecular layer deposition]] (MLD), uses gaseous precursor to deposit [[conformal film|conformal]] thin films one layer at a time.  The process is split up into two half reactions, run in sequence and repeated for each layer, in order to ensure total layer saturation before beginning the next layer.  Therefore, one reactant is deposited first, and then the second reactant is deposited, during which a chemical reaction occurs on the substrate, forming the desired composition.  As a result of the stepwise, the process is slower than CVD, however it can be run at low temperatures, unlike CVD.\n\n===Physical deposition===\nPhysical deposition uses mechanical, electromechanical or thermodynamic means to produce a thin film of solid. An everyday example is the formation of [[frost]]. Since most engineering materials are held together by relatively high energies, and chemical reactions are not used to store these energies, commercial physical deposition systems tend to require a low-pressure vapor environment to function properly; most can be classified as [[physical vapor deposition]] (PVD).\n\nThe material to be deposited is placed in an [[energy|energetic]], [[entropy|entropic]] environment, so that particles of material escape its surface. Facing this source is a cooler surface which draws energy from these particles as they arrive, allowing them to form a solid layer. The whole system is kept in a vacuum deposition chamber, to allow the particles to travel as freely as possible. Since particles tend to follow a straight path, films deposited by physical means are commonly ''directional'', rather than ''conformal''.\n\nExamples of physical deposition include:\nA thermal [[evaporation (deposition)|evaporator]] that uses an electric resistance heater to melt the material and raise its vapor pressure to a useful range. This is done in a high vacuum, both to allow the vapor to reach the substrate without reacting with or [[scattering]] against other gas-phase atoms in the chamber, and reduce the incorporation of impurities from the residual gas in the vacuum chamber. Obviously, only materials with a much higher [[vapor pressure]] than the [[heating element]] can be deposited without contamination of the film. [[Molecular beam epitaxy]] is a particularly sophisticated form of thermal evaporation.\n\nAn [[electron beam physical vapor deposition|electron beam evaporator]] fires a high-energy beam from an [[electron gun]] to boil a small spot of material; since the heating is not uniform, lower [[vapor pressure]] materials can be deposited. The beam is usually bent through an angle of 270\u00b0 in order to ensure that the gun filament is not directly exposed to the evaporant flux. Typical deposition rates for electron beam evaporation range from 1 to 10 nanometres per second.\n\nIn [[molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE), slow streams of an element can be directed at the substrate, so that material deposits one atomic layer at a time. Compounds such as [[gallium arsenide]] are usually deposited by repeatedly applying a layer of one element (i.e., [[gallium]]), then a layer of the other (i.e., [[arsenic]]), so that the process is chemical, as well as physical; this is known also as [[atomic layer deposition]]. If the precursors in use are organic, then the technique is called [[Molecular layer deposition|molecular layer deposition]]. The beam of material can be generated by either physical means (that is, by a [[furnace]]) or by a chemical reaction ([[chemical beam epitaxy]]).\n\n[[Sputtering]] relies on a plasma (usually a [[noble gas]], such as [[argon]]) to knock material from a \"target\" a few atoms at a time. The target can be kept at a relatively low temperature, since the process is not one of evaporation, making this one of the most flexible deposition techniques. It is especially useful for compounds or mixtures, where different components would otherwise tend to evaporate at different rates. Note, sputtering's step coverage is more or less conformal. It is also widely used in optical media. The manufacturing of all formats of CD, DVD, and BD are done with the help of this technique. It is a fast technique and also it provides a good thickness control.  Presently, nitrogen and oxygen gases are also being used in sputtering.\n\n[[Pulsed laser deposition]] systems work by an [[ablation]] process. Pulses of focused [[laser]] light vaporize the surface of the target material and convert it to plasma; this plasma usually reverts to a gas before it reaches the substrate.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rashidian Vaziri |first1=M.

The arc has an extremely high [[power density]] resulting in a high level of [[ionization]] (30\u2013100%), multiply charged ions, neutral particles, clusters and macro-particles (droplets). If a reactive gas is introduced during the evaporation process, [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]], [[ionization]] and [[Excited state|excitation]] can occur during interaction with the [[ion flux]] and a compound film will be deposited.\n\n[[Electrohydrodynamic]] deposition (electrospray deposition) is a relatively new process of thin-film deposition. The liquid to be deposited, either in the form of nanoparticle solution or simply a solution, is fed to a small capillary nozzle (usually metallic) which is connected to a high voltage. The substrate on which the film has to be deposited is connected to ground. Through the influence of electric field, the liquid coming out of the [[nozzle]] takes a conical shape ([[Taylor cone]]) and at the apex of the cone a thin jet emanates which disintegrates into very fine and small positively charged droplets under the influence of Rayleigh charge limit. The droplets keep getting smaller and smaller and ultimately get deposited on the substrate as a uniform thin layer.\n\n===Growth modes===\n[[Image:Frank-van-der-Merwe-Modus.svg|thumb|Frank-van-der-Merwe mode]]\n[[Image:Stranski-Krastanow-Modus.svg|thumb|Stranski-Krastanow mode]]\n[[Image:Volmer-Weber-Modus.svg|thumb|Volmer-Weber mode]]\n\n[[Frank-van der Merwe growth]]<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Frank | first1 = Frederick Charles | last2 = van der Merwe | first2 = J.

The term epitaxy comes from the Greek roots epi (\u1f10\u03c0\u03af), meaning \"above\", and taxis (\u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b9\u03c2), meaning \"an ordered manner\". It can be translated as \"arranging upon\".\n\nThe term '''homoepitaxy''' refers to the specific case in which a film of the same material is grown on a crystalline\nsubstrate. This technology is used, for instance, to grow a film which is more pure than the substrate, has a lower density\nof defects, and to fabricate layers having different doping levels. '''Heteroepitaxy''' refers to the case in which the film being deposited is different than the substrate.\n\nTechniques used for epitaxial growth of thin films include [[molecular beam epitaxy]], [[chemical vapor deposition]],\nand [[pulsed laser deposition]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rashidian Vaziri |first1=M.

This encompasses ca. 100&nbsp;nm thin [[gold leaf]]s that were already used in ancient India more than 5000 years ago. It may also be understood as any form of painting, although this kind of work is generally considered as an arts craft rather than an engineering or scientific discipline. Today, thin-film materials of variable thickness and high [[refractive index]] like [[titanium dioxide]] are often applied for decorative coatings on glass for instance, causing a rainbow-color appearance like oil on water. In addition, intransparent gold-colored surfaces may either be prepared by sputtering of gold or [[titanium nitride]].\n\n=== Optical coatings ===\n{{Further|Optical coating}}\n\nThese layers serve in both reflective and [[refraction|refractive]] systems. Large-area (reflective) [[mirror]]s became available during the 19th century and were produced by sputtering of metallic silver or aluminum on glass. Refractive lenses for optical instruments like cameras and microscopes typically exhibit [[optical aberration|aberrations]], i.e. non-ideal refractive behavior. While large sets of lenses had to be lined up along the optical path previously, nowadays, the coating of optical lenses with transparent [[optical coating|multilayers]] of titanium dioxide, [[silicon nitride]] or silicon oxide etc. may correct these aberrations. A well-known example for the progress in optical systems by thin-film technology is represented by the only a few mm wide lens in [[camera phone|smart phone cameras]]. Other examples are given by anti-reflection coatings on eyeglasses or [[solar panels]].\n\n===Protective coatings===\nThin films are often deposited to protect an underlying work piece from external influences. The protection may operate by minimizing the contact with the exterior medium in order to reduce the diffusion from the medium to the work piece or vice versa. For instance, plastic lemonade bottles are frequently coated by anti-diffusion layers to avoid the out-diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub>, into which carbonic acid decomposes that was introduced into the beverage under high pressure. Another example is represented by thin [[titanium nitride|TiN]] films in [[integrated circuit|microelectronic chips]] separating electrically conducting aluminum lines from the embedding insulator SiO<sub>2</sub> in order to suppress the formation of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Often, thin films serve as protection against [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] between mechanically moving parts. Examples for the latter application are [[diamond-like carbon]] (DLC) layers used in car engines or thin films made of [[nanocomposites]].\n\n===Electrically operating coatings===\n[[File:MxSnake.png|upright|thumb|right|Laterally structured metal layer of an integrated circuit<ref name= SCT2010 />]]\nThin layers from elemental metals like copper, aluminum, gold or silver etc. and alloys have found numerous applications in electrical devices. Due to their high [[electrical conductivity]] they are able to transport electrical currents or supply voltages. Thin metal layers serve in conventional electrical system, for instance, as Cu layers on [[printed circuit boards]], as the outer ground conductor in [[coaxial cable]]s and various other forms like sensors etc.<ref>{{cite book |last=Korotcenkov |first=Ghenadii |date=2013-09-18 |chapter=Thin metal films |title=Handbook of Gas Sensor Materials: Properties, Advantages and Shortcomings for Applications |series=Integrated Analytical Systems |chapter-url= |location= |publisher=Springer |pages=153\u2013166 |isbn=978-1461471646 |author-link=}}</ref> A major field of application became their use in [[integrated circuits]], where the electrical network among active and passive devices like [[transistors]] and capacitors etc. is built up from thin Al or Cu layers.

The rationale for this is [[thin-film solar cell]]s are cheaper to manufacture owing to their reduced material costs, energy costs, handling costs and capital costs. This is especially represented in the use of [[printed electronics]] ([[roll-to-roll]]) processes. Other thin-film technologies, that are still in an early stage of ongoing research or with limited commercial availability, are often classified as emerging or [[third generation photovoltaic cell]]s and include, [[Organic solar cell|organic]], [[Dye-sensitized solar cell|dye-sensitized]], and [[polymer solar cell]]s, as well as [[Quantum dot solar cell|quantum dot]], [[Copper zinc tin sulfide solar cell|copper zinc tin sulfide]], [[Nanocrystal solar cell|nanocrystal]] and [[perovskite solar cell]]s.\n\n===Thin-film batteries===\n[[Coating|Thin-film printing technology]] is being used to apply solid-state [[lithium polymer]]s to a variety of [[Substrate (printing)|substrates]] to create unique batteries for specialized applications.

Contemporaries of John Carter Allen had said at his death in 1800 that the late Lord Hillsborough (who died in 1793 and for whom John Carter Allen\u2019s younger brother William Allen (1729-1811) had worked as an office clerk) had said that \u2018he had a claim to the title of Erroll ... as being descended from the old Earl Hay in the male line\u2019,<ref>Letter of William Scott in ''Gentleman\u2019s Magazine'', 1800, vol. i, page 1021.</ref> a worthless statement as the peerage had become extinct in the male line in 1717,<ref>''The Complete Peerage'', vol. v (1926) pages 99-100</ref> but believed by Thomas who added Hay to his name.\n\nHowever, the uncertainty of their descent and the romantic nature of the various claims surrounding them greatly influenced the two brothers. They also added Hay to their names and in 1822 the eldest son, as John Hay Allan, published a ''Genealogical table of the Hays, from William de Haya, cupbearer to Malcolm IV, 1170, down to 1840, with all the branches'' (Edinburgh, 1840), though his descent is not shown in the book and the parentage of Emma Hay or Hays has not been found.\n==='''Thomas Allen'''===\nAlthough frequently referred to as Captain Allen, Thomas Allen never attained that rank. He retired from the Navy as a Lieutenant in 1798 and his subsequent history and movements and the extent to which he approved of his sons\u2019 later claims, are all far from clear. He had married Catherine Matilda Manning, a daughter of the Rev. [[Owen Manning]] the historian of [[Surrey]], at Godalming in 1792.  They had three children: (1) John Carter Allen, born at Oystermouth, [[Glamorgan]],  4 August 1795 and baptised there, 5 October 1795; (2) Matilda Allen, born at Oystermouth, Glamorgan, 18 October 1799 and baptised there, 12 January 1800; and (3) Charles Manning Allen, born at Rotherfield Grays, [[Oxfordshire]], 4 July 1802 and baptised there, 3 August 1802. Under their marriage settlement the couple and their future children had a life interest and income from properties in Mare Street and Well Street, [[Hackney, London|Hackney]]. \n\nHowever, sometime about 1807 Thomas Allen formed a connection with a much younger woman, Ann, who was born in Hackney about 1790, and by whom he had five illegitimate children between 1808 and 1829. Her surname is usually given as Salmon (as she had a niece of that name living with her in 1851) but the death certificates of several of her children show it as Burton. The first child, William (died 1878), who used the surname MacGarrow, claimed to have been born in Glamorganshire or Wales but his baptism and the exact whereabouts of Thomas and Ann at this time have not been determined. It is said that from 1816 to 1829 Thomas was based at Boulogne, \u2018a safe refuge for English debtors\u2019.<ref>''Notes and Queries'', vol. 197 (1952) 456</ref> He certainly had increasing financial problems and in February 1817 he unsuccessfully appealed to the former [[Lord Chancellor]], Lord Erskine, for help with the possible sale of some of the property held in trust under his marriage settlement. A last minute attempt to come to an arrangement about it failed and on 17 January 1818, as the result of an action in the Court of Kings Bench against Thomas and his son John (in a plea of debt for \u00a3300 and damages by James Barstow), Thomas was imprisoned for debt in the [[Fleet Prison]]. He was released by order of the Court for Relief of Insolvent Debtors on 20 December 1819 but continued to live in fear of his creditors. \n\nHis reticence and desired anonymity was probably due to his illegitimacy and his relationship with Anne, but it was complicated by the later statements of his two legitimate sons on whom he looked with some displeasure. He had little in common with them and they in turn looked down on Anne as \u2018of much lower rank in life\u2019 than their mother.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 20-21, 102-3.</ref> Thomas and Anne apparently had their last child, Gilbert Hay Allen (1829-1902), in south London in 1829 and in 1839 Thomas was in hiding at 10 Portland Place North, Clapham Road, [[Lambeth]], as \u2018Mr Salmond\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 102.</ref> In the 1841 census he was entered at that address as \u2018Thomas MacGaradh\u2019, aged 70, and born in Scotland. He ostensibly registered the death of his wife Catherine Matilda at Portland Place North, on 14 February 1841, again calling himself Thomas MacGaradh, but describing her as \u2018Matilda Manning, widow\u2019. When the census was taken a few months later Anne was living with him at this address as Anne MacGaradh. MacGaradh was, his sons said, a war-cry of the Hay family but it was entirely their creation and it seems likely that they or Anne were responsible for their father\u2019s statements. The death of Catherine Matilda in 1841 did, however, eventually allow the purchase by Charles of the family\u2019s life interest in the trust properties from his father\u2019s bankruptcy assignees.\n\nIt is said that Thomas \u2018spent the last seven years of his life in bed\u2019,<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 89, 102.</ref> confined to his room at 22 Henry Street, Pentonville. He was there as \u2018John Salmon\u2019 when the Census was taken in 1851 and he died at that address as Thomas Hay Allen on 14 February 1852. He was buried in that name at St Giles in the Fields, Middlesex, on 23 February 1852, aged 84. His son, Charles, in order to distance himself from him, wrote in 1877 that his father was called James and had died in 1839. Some believed that he was buried at Old St Pancras, Middlesex (as stated in the introduction to the 1892 edition of his sons\u2019 ''The costume of the clans'', xvii, and repeated in the ''Dictionary of National Biography'') and Beveridge added \u2018but the stone said to have been placed over his grave cannot now be found\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 89-90.</ref>\n\n==='''Sobieski Stuarts'''===\nNo detail of the educations of Thomas\u2019s two sons has been found though they claimed that the secret of their royal descent had been revealed to them about 1811, that they had fought for [[Napoleon]] at [[Dresden]] (in August 1813), [[Leipzig]] (October 1813) and [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] (June 1815) and had learned [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] in London. The youngest, Charles Manning Allen, who we now know was not born until 1802, married at St George, Hanover Square, on 9 October 1822, Anna Gardiner, who had an income from property in [[Ireland]] and was the widow of Major Charles Gardiner (1780-1818), the childless only son of [[William Gardiner (British Army officer)|General William Gardiner]] (1748-1806; DNB) former British Minister in [[Brussels]] and [[Warsaw]] and younger brother of [[Luke Gardiner, 1st Viscount Mountjoy]]  (1745-1798). The marriage was publicised as that of \u2018Charles Stuart Hay Allen\u2019. However, the couple moved to Scotland after marriage and their first child, Anna Marie Stuart, born 27 July 1823, was baptised at [[Edinburgh]] and there recorded in the surname Hay on 20 October 1823. \n\nThomas\u2019s eldest son, John Carter Allen, calling himself John Hay Allan, had apparently already been in Scotland for some time and in 1822 he published a volume of poems, ''Bridal of Caolchairn, and other poems'' (London, 1822) dedicated to the [[Duke of Argyll]], and revealing a fair knowledge of that county but including several allusions to his claimed descent from the Hays of Errol. From 1826 to 1829, John joined his brother Charles at Windy Hill (now Milton Brodie), Alves, [[Morayshire]], under the patronage of the Earl of Moray.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 25.</ref> The brothers were at Logie House, Edinkillie, Morayshire, from 1829 to 1838,<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 25.</ref> when John used the name Stuart Allan. As John Sobieski Stuart he and his brother, calling themselves \u2018grandsons to the Pretender\u2019, had visited Ireland in May 1836.<ref>''The Times'', 9 May 1836, quoting the ''Glasgow Chronicle'' (John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 37-38).</ref> Lord Lovat then built \u2018an antique shooting lodge\u2019 for them on Eilean Aigas, an islet in the river Beauly, near Eskadale, Inverness, and there, always wearing the Stuart tartan, they held court from 1838 to 1845, attending the catholic church at Eskadale and being known as \u2018the Princes\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 93.</ref> The house is described as \u2018a very elegant mansion of the Elizabethan style\u2019 in the ''New Statistical Account of Scotland'' (1842).<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 93.</ref> On 18 October 1845, John married at St Martin-in-the-Fields, [[Westminster]], Georgina, eldest surviving daughter of Edward Kendall, J.P., of Austrey, Warwickshire.<ref>''Burke\u2019s Landed Gentry'' (1858) page 643.</ref> She had, he told [[Robert Chambers (publisher, born 1802)|Robert Chambers]], \u2018only ten thousand pounds, unless she survives her two sisters, who equally share with her\u2019,<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 100.</ref> but the couple then moved to live in London.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 27.</ref> In his letter to Chambers just prior to the marriage John asked for a loan of \u00a3100 until his wife\u2019s dividends were paid but when his father-in-law eventually died in March 1872 the total estate was sworn  at \u2018Under \u00a31,500\u2019 and later as \u2018Under \u00a32,000\u2019.<ref>Principal Probate Registry, 10 June 1872.</ref>\n\nThomas Allen\u2019s daughter Matilda had married Henry Timothy Boisquet de la Fleuriere, at St Alphege, [[Greenwich]], in 1818, and their son, Napoleon de la Fleuriere (1823-1881), was baptised at St Margaret, Westminster, in 1823. According to Matilda, her husband had been in the French service from 1804 to 1814 and from 1832 to 1853, but had been taken prisoner at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] and did not return to France until 1830. In 1835 using the name Matilda McFleur she then married at St Mary Abbots, [[Kensington]], one Alexander McCaskery (died 1870), a police serjeant in [[Fulham]], by whom she had at least three children. This seems not to have stopped her from soliciting the Cross of an Officer of the [[Legion d\u2019Honneur]] for Henry Timothy in 1854. Her date of death has not been found.\n\nIn Scotland the brothers \u2018conducted themselves as members of a reigning dynasty who wished to preserve their incognito\u2019<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''The Jacobite Movement: the last phase: 1716-1807'' (London, 1950) 191.</ref> and  their claims \u2018were accorded a level of credence\u2019 (as the ''Dictionary of National Biography'' said at the end of the century) by \u2018men of rank and intelligence, such as the tenth [[Earl of Moray]] (1771-1848), the fourteenth [[Lord Lovat]] (1802-1875), the late [[Marquis of Bute]] (1793-1848), [[Sir Thomas Dick-Lauder, 9th Baronet|Thomas Dick-Lauder]] (1784-1848), and [[Robert Chambers (publisher, born 1802)|Robert Chambers]] (1802-1871)\u2019. However, the delusional John Sobieski Stuart, in spite of his expressed desire to withdraw from the public eye, went so far as to claim, in a letter to Chambers, that he and his brother had \u2018a body of supporters ready to push their claims to the uttermost\u2019.<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''The Jacobite Movement: the last phase: 1716-1807'' (London, 1950) 191-2].</ref>\n\n==='''The Claims'''===\nIn June 1829 the elder brother had shown a manuscript, containing tartan patterns and dated in 1721, to Sir Thomas Dick-Lauder who was much impressed by it, but [[Sir Walter Scott]] warned Dick-Lauder that the brothers \u2018are men of warm imaginations ... of much accomplishment but little probity \u2013 that is, in antiquarian matters\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 59.</ref> Sir Walter Scott, who died in 1832, had rejected the entire notion of clan tartans, saying that the \u2018idea of distinguishing the clans by their tartans is but a fashion of modern date\u2019. On behalf of the Society of Scottish Antiquaries he was shown a transcript of part of the brothers\u2019 manuscript but from its language alone \u2018indignantly declared his conviction that the MS itself must be an absolute fabrication\u2019.<ref>''Quarterly Review'', vol. 81, June-September 1847, page 64.</ref> Scott remembered seeing one of the brothers wearing the badge of [[High Constable of Scotland]] (as the Earls of Errol were), \u2018which he could have no more right to wear than the Crown\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 24.</ref> Dick-Lauder was himself an author of historical romances and had put up a monument to the Lauder family in Edinburgh showing a quite spurious descent, but one \u2018as he wished it to be\u2019.<ref>''Complete Baronetage'' (vol. 4, 1904) page 362, note a.</ref>\n\nHowever, calling himself John Sobieski Stuart, the elder brother then produced the lavish ''[[Vestiarium Scoticum]]'' (Edinburgh, 1842), costing ten guineas, which purported to be a reproduction, with colour illustrations, of a better version of the 1721 manuscript, this one being dated to 1571. This John claimed had passed through the hands of Prince Charles Edward Stuart to his father Thomas, though his father\u2019s letter on the subject, addressed to him as Ian and signed \u2018J. T. Stuart Hay\u2019 in 1829,<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 60.</ref> seems likely to be bogus. \n\nConsiderable interest in clans and tartans continued, and the following year, under the name John Sobieski Stolberg Stuart, John and his brother Charles published ''The costume of the clans: with observations upon the literature, arts, manufactures and commerce of the Highland and Western Isles during the middle ages; and the influence of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries upon their present condition'' (Edinburgh, 1843) which, as noted above, received intense criticism.\n\nUsing the names John Sobieski Stuart and Charles Edward Stuart the brothers followed this with their ''Tales of the Century, or sketches of the romances of history between 1745 and 1845'' (Edinburgh, 1847) in which they provided three scenes of the birth, youth and marriage of a man known by the Gaelic name of ''Iolair dhearg'' or the ''Red Eagle'', said to have been recounted by an aged Jacobite in exile, Dr Beaton. After being called to attend the birth of a son to a young woman in [[Tuscany]] in 1773, where portraits of the Old and Young Pretenders were prominent, Beaton claimed to have  been sworn to secrecy, but later to have seen a baby taken on board a British warship, ''HMS Albina'', under Commodore O\u2019Haloran. In the second tale, some years later, the grown child arrived in the Western Highlands of Scotland where, allthough called O\u2019Haloran and thought to be the son of the former captain, he is known as ''The Red Eagle'' and addressed as a prince. In the third tale, which takes place in the [[Peak District]] of [[Derbyshire]], a traveller meets ''The Red Eagle'' who, after various adventures, marries at [[Berwick-upon Tweed|Berwick]], Catharine Bruce, the daughter of a Derbyshire local landowner.\n \nThe stories, taken together, were designed in a roundabout way to suggest that the brothers\u2019 supposed grandfather was in reality Commodore O\u2019Haloran, and that the child, their father (known as Thomas Allen), was in reality the child of Prince Charles Edward Stuart and Louise of Stolberg, and thus de jure monarch of England. Athough the tales were \u2018copiously augmented with historical notes\u2019,<ref>Hugh Douglas, ''Bonnie Prince Charlie in love'' (1995) 218.</ref> in truth Admiral John Carter Allen did not command any ship in 1773, being on half-pay from 1771 to 1775.\n\nA strong attack on both the ''Vestiarium Scoticum'' and their ''Tales of the Century'' then followed and the brothers ancestral claims, which had received little acceptance in England, and the ''Vestiarium'' were completely discredited in a devastating anonymous article \u2018The heirs of the Stuarts\u2019, believed to be by [[George Skene]] (1807-1875), Professor of Law at [[Glasgow University]], which appeared in the ''Quarterly Review'', vol. 81 (June-September 1847) 57-85. He concluded about the ''Vestiarium'' that \u2018this pretended MS of the sixteenth century is an absolute fabrication, and of no authority whatever\u2019 and about the ''Tales'' that Prince Charles Edward Stuart \u2018could have had no possible reason for concealing the birth of an heir\u2019; any idea that he had \u2018left a legitimate male progeny\u2019 was \u2018the silliest of dreams\u2019.\n \nIn 1848 John attempted ''A reply to the Quarterly Review upon the Vestiarium Scoticum'' (Edinburgh, 1848) and the two brothers then produced ''Lays of the deer forest: with sketches of olden and modern deer-hunting'' (2 vols. Edinburgh, 1848), but three of their benefactors, the Earl of Moray, the Marquis of Bute and Thomas Dick-Lauder, died that year and the brothers were now so discredited that Charles took his wife to Prague where their son was in the Austrian army<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 101; ''Dictionary of National Biography''.</ref> and John followed soon after.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 27.</ref> John\u2019s wife died at [[Presburg]] in 1862 and the brothers did not return to England until 1868. In London they then occupied themselves with research, being well-known figures in the [[British Museum]], wearing Highland dress or military tunics and using pens embellished with gold coronets.\n\nJohn, who called himself \u2018The Chevalier John Sobieski Stewart\u2019, in 1871 described himself as Count d\u2019Albanie, Colonel of Hussars, and said that he was born at Versailles, France. He died without issue at 52 Stanley Street, St George Hanover Square, 13 February 1872, aged 74, and was buried at Eskadale. His widow died at Bath in 1888.\n\nJohn's brother Charles then assumed the title of Count of Albany and was active in Catholic circles in London but died from the same address (by then called 52 Alderney Street) on a trip to [[France]] on the Steamer ''Rainbow'' near [[Bordeaux]], 24 December 1880, and was buried at Eskadale. His son Charles Edward Stuart Allen, the last self-styled Count of Albany, died in [[Jersey]] in 1882. He had married Lady Alice Hay (1835-1881), a daughter of the 18th Earl of Erroll, but they had no issue.\n==='''Sources'''===\nHugh Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts: their claim to be descended from Prince Charlie'' (Inverness, 1909).

Contemporaries of John Carter Allen had said at his death in 1800 that the late Lord Hillsborough (who died in 1793 and for whom John Carter Allen\u2019s younger brother William Allen (1729-1811) had worked as an office clerk) had said that \u2018he had a claim to the title of Erroll ... as being descended from the old Earl Hay in the male line\u2019,<ref>Letter of William Scott in ''Gentleman\u2019s Magazine'', 1800, vol. i, page 1021.</ref> a worthless statement as the peerage had become extinct in the male line in 1717,<ref>''The Complete Peerage'', vol. v (1926) pages 99-100</ref> but believed by Thomas who added Hay to his name.\n\nHowever, the uncertainty of their descent and the romantic nature of the various claims surrounding them greatly influenced the two brothers. They also added Hay to their names and in 1822 the eldest son, as John Hay Allan, published a ''Genealogical table of the Hays, from William de Haya, cupbearer to Malcolm IV, 1170, down to 1840, with all the branches'' (Edinburgh, 1840), though his descent is not shown in the book and the parentage of Emma Hay or Hays has not been found.\n==='''Thomas Allen'''===\nAlthough frequently referred to as Captain Allen, Thomas Allen never attained that rank. He retired from the Navy as a Lieutenant in 1798 and his subsequent history and movements and the extent to which he approved of his sons\u2019 later claims, are all far from clear. He had married Catherine Matilda Manning, a daughter of the Rev. [[Owen Manning]] the historian of [[Surrey]], at Godalming in 1792.  They had three children: (1) John Carter Allen, born at Oystermouth, [[Glamorgan]],  4 August 1795 and baptised there, 5 October 1795; (2) Matilda Allen, born at Oystermouth, Glamorgan, 18 October 1799 and baptised there, 12 January 1800; and (3) Charles Manning Allen, born at Rotherfield Grays, [[Oxfordshire]], 4 July 1802 and baptised there, 3 August 1802. Under their marriage settlement the couple and their future children had a life interest and income from properties in Mare Street and Well Street, [[Hackney, London|Hackney]]. \n\nHowever, sometime about 1807 Thomas Allen formed a connection with a much younger woman, Ann, who was born in Hackney about 1790, and by whom he had five illegitimate children between 1808 and 1829. Her surname is usually given as Salmon (as she had a niece of that name living with her in 1851) but the death certificates of several of her children show it as Burton. The first child, William (died 1878), who used the surname MacGarrow, claimed to have been born in Glamorganshire or Wales but his baptism and the exact whereabouts of Thomas and Ann at this time have not been determined. It is said that from 1816 to 1829 Thomas was based at Boulogne, \u2018a safe refuge for English debtors\u2019.<ref>''Notes and Queries'', vol. 197 (1952) 456</ref> He certainly had increasing financial problems and in February 1817 he unsuccessfully appealed to the former [[Lord Chancellor]], Lord Erskine, for help with the possible sale of some of the property held in trust under his marriage settlement. A last minute attempt to come to an arrangement about it failed and on 17 January 1818, as the result of an action in the Court of Kings Bench against Thomas and his son John (in a plea of debt for \u00a3300 and damages by James Barstow), Thomas was imprisoned for debt in the [[Fleet Prison]]. He was released by order of the Court for Relief of Insolvent Debtors on 20 December 1819 but continued to live in fear of his creditors. \n\nHis reticence and desired anonymity was probably due to his illegitimacy and his relationship with Anne, but it was complicated by the later statements of his two legitimate sons on whom he looked with some displeasure. He had little in common with them and they in turn looked down on Anne as \u2018of much lower rank in life\u2019 than their mother.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 20-21, 102-3.</ref> Thomas and Anne apparently had their last child, Gilbert Hay Allen (1829-1902), in south London in 1829 and in 1839 Thomas was in hiding at 10 Portland Place North, Clapham Road, [[Lambeth]], as \u2018Mr Salmond\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 102.</ref> In the 1841 census he was entered at that address as \u2018Thomas MacGaradh\u2019, aged 70, and born in Scotland. He ostensibly registered the death of his wife Catherine Matilda at Portland Place North, on 14 February 1841, again calling himself Thomas MacGaradh, but describing her as \u2018Matilda Manning, widow\u2019. When the census was taken a few months later Anne was living with him at this address as Anne MacGaradh. MacGaradh was, his sons said, a war-cry of the Hay family but it was entirely their creation and it seems likely that they or Anne were responsible for their father\u2019s statements. The death of Catherine Matilda in 1841 did, however, eventually allow the purchase by Charles of the family\u2019s life interest in the trust properties from his father\u2019s bankruptcy assignees.\n\nIt is said that Thomas \u2018spent the last seven years of his life in bed\u2019,<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 89, 102.</ref> confined to his room at 22 Henry Street, Pentonville. He was there as \u2018John Salmon\u2019 when the Census was taken in 1851 and he died at that address as Thomas Hay Allen on 14 February 1852. He was buried in that name at St Giles in the Fields, Middlesex, on 23 February 1852, aged 84. His son, Charles, in order to distance himself from him, wrote in 1877 that his father was called James and had died in 1839. Some believed that he was buried at Old St Pancras, Middlesex (as stated in the introduction to the 1892 edition of his sons\u2019 ''The costume of the clans'', xvii, and repeated in the ''Dictionary of National Biography'') and Beveridge added \u2018but the stone said to have been placed over his grave cannot now be found\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 89-90.</ref>\n\n==='''Sobieski Stuarts'''===\nNo detail of the educations of Thomas\u2019s two sons has been found though they claimed that the secret of their royal descent had been revealed to them about 1811, that they had fought for [[Napoleon]] at [[Dresden]] (in August 1813), [[Leipzig]] (October 1813) and [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] (June 1815) and had learned [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] in London. The youngest, Charles Manning Allen, who we now know was not born until 1802, married at St George, Hanover Square, on 9 October 1822, Anna Gardiner, who had an income from property in [[Ireland]] and was the widow of Major Charles Gardiner (1780-1818), the childless only son of [[General William Gardiner]] (1748-1806; DNB) former British Minister in [[Brussels]] and [[Warsaw]] and younger brother of [[Luke Gardiner, 1st Viscount Mountjoy]]  (1745-1798). The marriage was publicised as that of \u2018Charles Stuart Hay Allen\u2019. However, the couple moved to Scotland after marriage and their first child, Anna Marie Stuart, born 27 July 1823, was baptised at [[Edinburgh]] and there recorded in the surname Hay on 20 October 1823. \n\nThomas\u2019s eldest son, John Carter Allen, calling himself John Hay Allan, had apparently already been in Scotland for some time and in 1822 he published a volume of poems, ''Bridal of Caolchairn, and other poems'' (London, 1822) dedicated to the [[Duke of Argyll]], and revealing a fair knowledge of that county but including several allusions to his claimed descent from the Hays of Errol. From 1826 to 1829, John joined his brother Charles at Windy Hill (now Milton Brodie), Alves, [[Morayshire]], under the patronage of the Earl of Moray.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 25.</ref> The brothers were at Logie House, Edinkillie, Morayshire, from 1829 to 1838,<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 25.</ref> when John used the name Stuart Allan. As John Sobieski Stuart he and his brother, calling themselves \u2018grandsons to the Pretender\u2019, had visited Ireland in May 1836.<ref>''The Times'', 9 May 1836, quoting the ''Glasgow Chronicle'' (John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 37-38).</ref> Lord Lovat then built \u2018an antique shooting lodge\u2019 for them on Eilean Aigas, an islet in the river Beauly, near Eskadale, Inverness, and there, always wearing the Stuart tartan, they held court from 1838 to 1845, attending the catholic church at Eskadale and being known as \u2018the Princes\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 93.</ref> The house is described as \u2018a very elegant mansion of the Elizabethan style\u2019 in the ''New Statistical Account of Scotland'' (1842).<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 93.</ref> On 18 October 1845, John married at St Martin-in-the-Fields, [[Westminster]], Georgina, eldest surviving daughter of Edward Kendall, J.P., of Austrey, Warwickshire.<ref>''Burke\u2019s Landed Gentry'' (1858) page 643.</ref> She had, he told [[Robert Chambers (publisher, born 1802)|Robert Chambers]], \u2018only ten thousand pounds, unless she survives her two sisters, who equally share with her\u2019,<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 100.</ref> but the couple then moved to live in London.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 27.</ref> In his letter to Chambers just prior to the marriage John asked for a loan of \u00a3100 until his wife\u2019s dividends were paid but when his father-in-law eventually died in March 1872 the total estate was sworn  at \u2018Under \u00a31,500\u2019 and later as \u2018Under \u00a32,000\u2019.<ref>Principal Probate Registry, 10 June 1872.</ref>\n\nThomas Allen\u2019s daughter Matilda had married Henry Timothy Boisquet de la Fleuriere, at St Alphege, [[Greenwich]], in 1818, and their son, Napoleon de la Fleuriere (1823-1881), was baptised at St Margaret, Westminster, in 1823. According to Matilda, her husband had been in the French service from 1804 to 1814 and from 1832 to 1853, but had been taken prisoner at [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] and did not return to France until 1830. In 1835 using the name Matilda McFleur she then married at St Mary Abbots, [[Kensington]], one Alexander McCaskery (died 1870), a police serjeant in [[Fulham]], by whom she had at least three children. This seems not to have stopped her from soliciting the Cross of an Officer of the [[Legion d\u2019Honneur]] for Henry Timothy in 1854. Her date of death has not been found.\n\nIn Scotland the brothers \u2018conducted themselves as members of a reigning dynasty who wished to preserve their incognito\u2019<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''The Jacobite Movement: the last phase: 1716-1807'' (London, 1950) 191.</ref> and  their claims \u2018were accorded a level of credence\u2019 (as the ''Dictionary of National Biography'' said at the end of the century) by \u2018men of rank and intelligence, such as the tenth [[Earl of Moray]] (1771-1848), the fourteenth [[Lord Lovat]] (1802-1875), the late [[Marquis of Bute]] (1793-1848), [[Sir Thomas Dick-Lauder, 9th Baronet|Thomas Dick-Lauder]] (1784-1848), and [[Robert Chambers (publisher, born 1802)|Robert Chambers]] (1802-1871)\u2019. However, the delusional John Sobieski Stuart, in spite of his expressed desire to withdraw from the public eye, went so far as to claim, in a letter to Chambers, that he and his brother had \u2018a body of supporters ready to push their claims to the uttermost\u2019.<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''The Jacobite Movement: the last phase: 1716-1807'' (London, 1950) 191-2].</ref>\n\n==='''The Claims'''===\nIn June 1829 the elder brother had shown a manuscript, containing tartan patterns and dated in 1721, to Sir Thomas Dick-Lauder who was much impressed by it, but [[Sir Walter Scott]] warned Dick-Lauder that the brothers \u2018are men of warm imaginations ... of much accomplishment but little probity \u2013 that is, in antiquarian matters\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 59.</ref> Sir Walter Scott, who died in 1832, had rejected the entire notion of clan tartans, saying that the \u2018idea of distinguishing the clans by their tartans is but a fashion of modern date\u2019. On behalf of the Society of Scottish Antiquaries he was shown a transcript of part of the brothers\u2019 manuscript but from its language alone \u2018indignantly declared his conviction that the MS itself must be an absolute fabrication\u2019.<ref>''Quarterly Review'', vol. 81, June-September 1847, page 64.</ref> Scott remembered seeing one of the brothers wearing the badge of [[High Constable of Scotland]] (as the Earls of Errol were), \u2018which he could have no more right to wear than the Crown\u2019.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 24.</ref> Dick-Lauder was himself an author of historical romances and had put up a monument to the Lauder family in Edinburgh showing a quite spurious descent, but one \u2018as he wished it to be\u2019.<ref>''Complete Baronetage'' (vol. 4, 1904) page 362, note a.</ref>\n\nHowever, calling himself John Sobieski Stuart, the elder brother then produced the lavish ''[[Vestiarium Scoticum]]'' (Edinburgh, 1842), costing ten guineas, which purported to be a reproduction, with colour illustrations, of a better version of the 1721 manuscript, this one being dated to 1571. This John claimed had passed through the hands of Prince Charles Edward Stuart to his father Thomas, though his father\u2019s letter on the subject, addressed to him as Ian and signed \u2018J. T. Stuart Hay\u2019 in 1829,<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 60.</ref> seems likely to be bogus. \n\nConsiderable interest in clans and tartans continued, and the following year, under the name John Sobieski Stolberg Stuart, John and his brother Charles published ''The costume of the clans: with observations upon the literature, arts, manufactures and commerce of the Highland and Western Isles during the middle ages; and the influence of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries upon their present condition'' (Edinburgh, 1843) which, as noted above, received intense criticism.\n\nUsing the names John Sobieski Stuart and Charles Edward Stuart the brothers followed this with their ''Tales of the Century, or sketches of the romances of history between 1745 and 1845'' (Edinburgh, 1847) in which they provided three scenes of the birth, youth and marriage of a man known by the Gaelic name of ''Iolair dhearg'' or the ''Red Eagle'', said to have been recounted by an aged Jacobite in exile, Dr Beaton. After being called to attend the birth of a son to a young woman in [[Tuscany]] in 1773, where portraits of the Old and Young Pretenders were prominent, Beaton claimed to have  been sworn to secrecy, but later to have seen a baby taken on board a British warship, ''HMS Albina'', under Commodore O\u2019Haloran. In the second tale, some years later, the grown child arrived in the Western Highlands of Scotland where, allthough called O\u2019Haloran and thought to be the son of the former captain, he is known as ''The Red Eagle'' and addressed as a prince. In the third tale, which takes place in the [[Peak District]] of [[Derbyshire]], a traveller meets ''The Red Eagle'' who, after various adventures, marries at [[Berwick-upon Tweed|Berwick]], Catharine Bruce, the daughter of a Derbyshire local landowner.\n \nThe stories, taken together, were designed in a roundabout way to suggest that the brothers\u2019 supposed grandfather was in reality Commodore O\u2019Haloran, and that the child, their father (known as Thomas Allen), was in reality the child of Prince Charles Edward Stuart and Louise of Stolberg, and thus de jure monarch of England. Athough the tales were \u2018copiously augmented with historical notes\u2019,<ref>Hugh Douglas, ''Bonnie Prince Charlie in love'' (1995) 218.</ref> in truth Admiral John Carter Allen did not command any ship in 1773, being on half-pay from 1771 to 1775.\n\nA strong attack on both the ''Vestiarium Scoticum'' and their ''Tales of the Century'' then followed and the brothers ancestral claims, which had received little acceptance in England, and the ''Vestiarium'' were completely discredited in a devastating anonymous article \u2018The heirs of the Stuarts\u2019, believed to be by [[George Skene]] (1807-1875), Professor of Law at [[Glasgow University]], which appeared in the ''Quarterly Review'', vol. 81 (June-September 1847) 57-85. He concluded about the ''Vestiarium'' that \u2018this pretended MS of the sixteenth century is an absolute fabrication, and of no authority whatever\u2019 and about the ''Tales'' that Prince Charles Edward Stuart \u2018could have had no possible reason for concealing the birth of an heir\u2019; any idea that he had \u2018left a legitimate male progeny\u2019 was \u2018the silliest of dreams\u2019.\n \nIn 1848 John attempted ''A reply to the Quarterly Review upon the Vestiarium Scoticum'' (Edinburgh, 1848) and the two brothers then produced ''Lays of the deer forest: with sketches of olden and modern deer-hunting'' (2 vols. Edinburgh, 1848), but three of their benefactors, the Earl of Moray, the Marquis of Bute and Thomas Dick-Lauder, died that year and the brothers were now so discredited that Charles took his wife to Prague where their son was in the Austrian army<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 101; ''Dictionary of National Biography''.</ref> and John followed soon after.<ref>John Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts'' (1909) 27.</ref> John\u2019s wife died at [[Presburg]] in 1862 and the brothers did not return to England until 1868. In London they then occupied themselves with research, being well-known figures in the [[British Museum]], wearing Highland dress or military tunics and using pens embellished with gold coronets.\n\nJohn, who called himself \u2018The Chevalier John Sobieski Stewart\u2019, in 1871 described himself as Count d\u2019Albanie, Colonel of Hussars, and said that he was born at Versailles, France. He died without issue at 52 Stanley Street, St George Hanover Square, 13 February 1872, aged 74, and was buried at Eskadale. His widow died at Bath in 1888.\n\nJohn's brother Charles then assumed the title of Count of Albany and was active in Catholic circles in London but died from the same address (by then called 52 Alderney Street) on a trip to [[France]] on the Steamer ''Rainbow'' near [[Bordeaux]], 24 December 1880, and was buried at Eskadale. His son Charles Edward Stuart Allen, the last self-styled Count of Albany, died in [[Jersey]] in 1882. He had married Lady Alice Hay (1835-1881), a daughter of the 18th Earl of Erroll, but they had no issue.\n==='''Sources'''===\nHugh Beveridge, ''The Sobieski Stuarts: their claim to be descended from Prince Charlie'' (Inverness, 1909).

He received his drama education at CEA ([[Centro de Educaci\u00f3n Art\u00edstica]] de Televisa) and he is one of the most famous telenovela actors of all time.\n\n== Career ==\nColunga, the only son of the engineer Fernando Colunga and Margarita Olivares, began studying civil engineering, had a hardware store, and also worked as an auto dealer, clerk, and bartender.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} He began film acting until in 1988 he worked twice as Eduardo Ya\u00f1ez's [[stuntman]] in the [[soap opera]] ''Dulce Desaf\u00edo'' (Sweet Challenge). From there he decided to go into acting and enrolled in the Centro de Educaci\u00f3n en las Artes (CEA) in Televisa in 1990. At the outset, his face became popular in many homes thanks to having a role in the Mexican version of the famous children's program Sesame Street''. He appeared in other shows like ''The web'', ''Marked time'' and ''All of it''.\n\nHe had appearances in telenovelas like ''[[Cenizas y diamantes|Cenizas y Diamantes]]'', ''[[Madres ego\u00edstas|Madres Ego\u00edstas]]'' and ''[[Mar\u00eda Mercedes (Mexican TV series)|Maria Mercedes]]''. [[Carla Estrada]] offered him a role in the soap opera ''[[M\u00e1s all\u00e1 del puente|M\u00e1s All\u00e1 del Puente]]'' with Maria Sort\u00e9 in 1993-1994. \"Fernando is a very studious person and given as a professional, demanding of himself\", said Carla Estrada in ''People'' magazine.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAfter this telenovela, Colunga had a role in ''[[Marimar (Mexican TV series)|Marimar]]'' in 1994 giving birth to Adrian Rosales.{{clarification needed|date=March 2020}} By that year, Colunga was released in the cinema with the film ''Kiss me on the mouth'' with [[Paulina Rubio]] and in 1995 played the character of Lieutenant Raul Gutierrez ''[[Alondra (TV series)|Alondra]]'', a period novel produced by Carla Estrada, and teaming with actress [[Veronica Merchant]] and sharing credits with actors like [[Gonzalo Vega]], [[Ernesto Laguardia]], [[Marga Lopez]], [[Ana Colchero]], [[Juan Manuel Bernal]], [[Beatriz Sheridan]], and [[Eric del Castillo]]. In 1995-1996 Colunga got his first starring role opposite [[Thal\u00eda]] in the telenovela ''[[Maria la del Barrio]]'' giving life to Luis Fernando de la Vega. With this telenovela, Colunga began to be known in many countries.\n\nHe later starred in ''[[Esmeralda (Mexican TV series)|Esmeralda]]'' with [[Leticia Calderon]], seen in countries as disparate as Indonesia and the Czech Republic.
