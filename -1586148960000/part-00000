Creel set up divisions in his new agency to produce and distribute innumerable copies of pamphlets, newspaper releases, magazine advertisements, films, school campaigns, and the speeches of the [[Four Minute Men]]. The CPI created colourful posters that appeared in every store window, catching the attention of the passersby for a few seconds.<ref>Katherine H.

They also spoke at churches, lodges, fraternal organizations, labour unions, and even logging camps. Creel boasted that in 18 months his 75,000 volunteers delivered over 7.5 million four-minute orations to over 300 million listeners, in a nation of 103 million people.

In 1914, prominent forensic scientist, [[Archibald Reiss|R.A. Reiss]] was commissioned by the Serbian Prime Minister to conduct an investigation regarding war crimes.<ref name=\"Atrocity Propaganda\" /> This was done as a way to depict the multiple acts of violence committed against civilians by the occupying Austro-Hungarian forces in [[Serbia]] in 1914. These reports were written in vivid detail and described individual acts of violence against civilians, soldiers and prisoners of war.<ref name=\"Atrocity Propaganda\" /> Some of these actions included the use of forbidden weapons, the demolition of ancient libraries and cathedrals, as well as the rape and torture of civilians.<ref name=\"Atrocity Propaganda\" /> Graphic illustrations, accompanied by first-hand testimonies that described these crimes as savagely unjust served as a compelling reminder for the justification of war.<ref name=\"Atrocity Propaganda\" /> Other forms of atrocity propaganda depicted an alternative to war which involved German occupation and domination.<ref name=pierre /> This was regarded as unacceptable across the political spectrum.

Propaganda ensured that the people only got to know what their [[governments]] wanted them to know. In World War One, the lengths to which governments would go to in an effort to blacken the enemy\u2019s name reached a new level. To ensure that everybody [[thought]] in the way the government wanted, all forms of information were controlled. Newspapers were expected to print what the government wanted the reader to read. In fact, though this would appear to be a form of [[censorship]], the newspapers of Britain, effectively controlled by the [[Broadcast media|media]] barons of the time, were happy to play ball. They printed headlines that were designed to stir up emotions regardless of whether they were accurate or not. The most infamous headlines included \u201cBelgium child\u2019s hands cut off by Germans\u201d and \u201cGermans crucify Canadian officer\u201d.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite web|last1=Trueman|first1=Chris|title=Propaganda and World War One|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/propaganda_and_world_war_one.htm|website=History Learning Site}}</ref>\n\n==Propaganda playing on patriotism and nationalism==\n[[File: Uncle sam propaganda in ww1.jpg|thumb|[[Uncle Sam]]'s call to arms]]\n\nAccording to scholar [[David Welch (historian)|David Welch]], [[patriotism]] and [[nationalism]] were two of the most important themes played on by the [[propaganda]] of the time.<ref name=\"Propaganda for patriotism and nationalism\" /> In 1914, the British army was made up of professionals as well as volunteers, causing the government to rely heavily on propaganda as a tool to justify war to the public eye.<ref name=\"Propaganda for patriotism and nationalism\" /> This propaganda was used to promote recruitment into the armed forces as well as to convince civilians that if they joined, their sacrifices would be rewarded.<ref name=\"Propaganda for patriotism and nationalism\" /> One of the most impressionable images of this First World War is the \u201cYour Country Needs You\u201d poster, a distinctive recruitment poster of [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] (similar to the later [[Uncle Sam]] poster) pointing at his British audience, convincing them to join the war effort.<ref name=\"Propaganda for patriotism and nationalism\" /> Another message deeply embedded in national sentiment was one where the religious symbolism of [[St George]] was shown slaying a [[dragon]] which represented the German forces.<ref name=\"Propaganda for patriotism and nationalism\" /> Images of enthusiastic patriotism seemed to encapsulate the tragedy of European and imperial populations.<ref name=pierre /> Such images were able to conjure up feelings of required patriotism and activism among those influenced.<ref name=pierre>{{cite web|last1=Purseigle|first1=Pierre|title=Inside the First World War|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/inside-first-world-war/part-three/10417056/world-war-one-propaganda.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=7 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Propaganda as a weapon==\nThe non-military diplomatic and propaganda interactions during the war were designed to build support for the cause or to undermine support for the enemy.<ref>David Stevenson, ''The First World War and International Politics'' (1988).</ref><ref>Z.A.B.

In addition, there were multiple peace proposals coming from neutrals, or from one side or the other;  none of them progressed very far. Some were neutral efforts to end the horrors.

Journalists were allowed to report from the front but only if they were experienced officers with \"recognized patriotic views\". Briefings to the press created a high degree of uniformity in the war time reporting. Contact between journalists and fighting troops was prohibited, and journalists spoke only to high ranking officers and commanders.<ref name=war>{{cite book|title=Selling War: The Role of Mass Media in Hostile Conflicts From World War I to the 'War on Terror'|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=29}}</ref>\n\nDespite the availability of [[Kodak Brownie]] cameras, both the [[Central Powers]] and the [[Entente Powers]] initially prohibited any photography or filming. The primary visual representation relied on [[war painting]], though Germans used some filmed newsreels these were heavily censored.

Perhaps the most influential man behind the propaganda in the United States during World War I was President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. In one of Wilson's most famous declarations, he outlined the \"[[Fourteen Points]]\" which he said the United States would fight to defend.<ref name=\"14 points\" /> Aside from the restoration of freedom in [[Europe]] a country suppressed by the power of [[German Empire|Germany]], Wilson's Fourteen Points called for transparency regarding discussion of [[Diplomacy|diplomatic matters]], free navigation of the seas both in peace and war time, and equal trade conditions among all nations.<ref name=\"14 points\">{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Woodrow|title=President Wilson's Message to Congress|publisher=Records of the United States Senate|date=January 8, 1918}}</ref> The Fourteen Points would serve as a blueprint for world peace to be used for peace negotiations after [[World War I]].<ref name=\" US propaganda\" /> Wilson's points inspired audiences around the world and greatly strengthened the belief that Britain, France and America were fighting for noble goals.<ref name=\"US propaganda\" />\n\n=== Committee on Public Information===\nIn 1917 Wilson created the [[Committee on Public Information]] which was made up by the [[Secretaries of State]], the [[United States Army|Army]], and the [[United States Navy|Navy]].<ref name=\"US propaganda\" /> The committee would report directly to President Wilson and was essentially a massive generator of propaganda.<ref name=\"US propaganda\" /> The Committee on Public Information was responsible for producing films, commissioning posters, publishing numerous books and pamphlets, purchasing advertisements in major newspapers, and recruiting businessmen, preachers and professors to serve as public speakers in charge of altering public opinion at the communal level.<ref name=\" US propaganda\" /> The committee, headed by former investigative journalist [[George Creel]], emphasized the message that America's involvement in the war was entirely necessary for achieving the salvation of Europe from the German and enemy forces.<ref name=\"US propaganda\" /> In his book titled ''How we Advertised America'', Creel states that the committee was called into existence to make World War I a fight that would be a \"verdict for mankind.\"<ref name=Creel>{{cite book|last1=Creel|first1=George|title=How We Advertised America: The First Telling of the Amazing Story of the Committee on Public Information that Carried the Gospel of Americanism to Every Corner of the Globe|url=https://archive.org/details/howweadvertiseda00cree|date=1920|publisher=Harper and Brothers}}</ref> He called the committee a voice that was created to plead the justice of America's cause before the jury of public opinion.<ref name=Creel /> Creel also refers to the committee as a \"vast enterprise in salesmanship\" and \"the world's greatest adventure in advertising.\"<ref name=Creel /> The committee's message resonated deep within every American community and also served as an organization responsible for carrying the full message of American ideals to every corner of the civilized globe.<ref name=Creel /> Creel and his committee utilized every possible mode to get their message across, including; printed word, spoken word, the motion picture, the telegraph, the poster and the signboard.<ref name=Creel /> All forms of communication were put to use in order to justify the causes that compelled America to take arms.\n\nCreel set out to systematically reach every person in the United States multiple times with patriotic information about how the individual could contribute to the war effort.<ref>Stephen Vaughn, ''Holding Fast the Inner Lines: Democracy, Nationalism, and the Committee on Public Information'' (1980).

Creel set up divisions in his new agency to produce and distribute innumerable copies of pamphlets, newspaper releases, magazine advertisements, films, school campaigns, and the speeches of the [[Four Minute Men]]. The CPI created colourful posters that appeared in every store window, catching the attention of the passersby for a few seconds.<ref>Katherine H. Adams, ''Progressive Politics and the Training of America\u2019s Persuaders'' (1999)</ref> Movie theatres were widely attended, and the CPI trained thousands of volunteer speakers to make patriotic appeals during the four-minute breaks needed to change reels.  They also spoke at churches, lodges, fraternal organizations, labour unions, and even logging camps. Creel boasted that in 18 months his 75,000 volunteers delivered over 7.5 million four-minute orations to over 300 million listeners, in a nation of 103 million people.

In 1914, prominent forensic scientist, [[Archibald Reiss|R.A. Reiss]] was commissioned by the Serbian Prime Minister to conduct an investigation regarding war crimes.<ref name=\"Atrocity Propaganda\" /> This was done as a way to depict the multiple acts of violence committed against civilians by the occupying Austro-Hungarian forces in [[Serbia]] in 1914. These reports were written in vivid detail and described individual acts of violence against civilians, soldiers and prisoners of war.<ref name=\"Atrocity Propaganda\" /> Some of these actions included the use of forbidden weapons, the demolition of ancient libraries and cathedrals, as well as the rape and torture of civilians.<ref name=\"Atrocity Propaganda\" /> Graphic illustrations, accompanied by first-hand testimonies that described these crimes as savagely unjust served as a compelling reminder for the justification of war.<ref name=\"Atrocity Propaganda\" /> Other forms of atrocity propaganda depicted an alternative to war which involved German occupation and domination.<ref name=pierre /> This was regarded as unacceptable across the political spectrum.

Propaganda ensured that the people only got to know what their [[governments]] wanted them to know. In World War One, the lengths to which governments would go to in an effort to blacken the enemy\u2019s name reached a new level. To ensure that everybody [[thought]] in the way the government wanted, all forms of information were controlled. Newspapers were expected to print what the government wanted the reader to read. In fact, though this would appear to be a form of [[censorship]], the newspapers of Britain, effectively controlled by the [[Broadcast media|media]] barons of the time, were happy to play ball. They printed headlines that were designed to stir up emotions regardless of whether they were accurate or not.
