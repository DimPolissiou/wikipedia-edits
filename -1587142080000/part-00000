Various parishes and suburbs developed out of Birkirkara over the years, including [[Sliema]], [[St. Julian's]], [[Msida]], [[\u0126amrun]] in the 19th century and [[Santa Venera]] in the early 20th century. In more recent years, [[San \u0120wann]] (1965) and the hamlet of [[Ta' l-Ibra\u0121]] hived off Birkirkara to form part of the new parish and locality of [[Swieqi]] in 1993.\n\nThere are many places of interest in Birkirkara, which may not be either preserved nor protected,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/safeguarding-the-oldest-house-in-triq-il-kbira-birkirkara.687099|title=The oldest house in Birkirkara's Main Street faces demolition|website=Times of Malta}}</ref> amongst them the Old Railway Station which is today located within a public garden.

The main event of the celebration is a procession with a large wooden statue carved by the Maltese master-sculptor [[Salvu Psaila]].  Notably, this is the only procession (with a titular statue) on the island carried out in the morning. The procession leaves the basilica at exactly 8:00&nbsp;a.m. and returns to it at 10:45&nbsp;am.

It is the second most populous on the [[Malta (island)|island]], with 23,034 inhabitants as of March 2018. The city consists of four autonomous parishes: Saint Helen, Saint Joseph the Worker, Our Lady of Mount Carmel and Saint Mary. The city's motto is ''[[In hoc signo vinces]]'', and its coat of arms is a plain red cross, surmounted by a crown.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Birkirkara, Valley road circa 1900.jpg|thumb|Valley road circa 1900]]\n''Birkirkara'' means \"cold water\" or \"running water\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abela|first1=Giovanni Francesco|authorlink1=Giovanni Francesco Abela|title=Della Descrizione di Malta Isola nel Mare Siciliano con le sue Antichit\u00e0, ed Altre Notizie|date=1647|publisher=Paolo Bonacota|page=90|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=krRTAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA90#v=onepage&q&f=false|language=Italian}}</ref> This is attributed to the valley in the town.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/53136/1/ISIMHA%20...%20NIESHA%20...%20GRAJJIETHA.pdf|title=Pullicino, F.

Various parishes and suburbs developed out of Birkirkara over the years, including [[Sliema]], [[St. Julian's]], [[Msida]], [[\u0126amrun]] in the 19th century and [[Santa Venera]] in the early 20th century. In more recent years, [[San \u0120wann]] (1965) and the hamlet of [[Ta' l-Ibra\u0121]] hived off Birkirkara to form part of the new parish and locality of [[Swieqi]] in 1993.\n\nThere are many places of interest in Birkirkara, which may not be either preserved nor protected,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/safeguarding-the-oldest-house-in-triq-il-kbira-birkirkara.687099|title=The oldest house in Birkirkara's Main Street faces demolition|website=Times of Malta}}</ref> amongst them the Old Railway Station which is today located within a public garden. Trains were used as means of transportation across the island until the Railway's closure happened in 1931.

The main event of the celebration is a procession with a large wooden statue carved by the Maltese master-sculptor [[Salvu Psaila]].  Notably, this is the only procession (with a titular statue) on the island carried out in the morning. The procession leaves the basilica at exactly 8:00&nbsp;a.m. and returns to it at 10:45&nbsp;am. The statue is lifted to shoulder-height by a group of townsmen and is carried through the main streets of the town.\n\nBirkirkara has grown into an important commercial centre as well as a densely populated residential area.\n\nSome prominent buildings in the area are [[Dar Pirotta]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/Dar-Pirotta-grateful-for-government-help.390306|title=Dar Pirotta grateful for government help|website=Times of Malta}}</ref> [[Dar Papa Fran\u0121isku]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/homeless-emergency-shelter-to-open-in-summer.614871|title=Homeless emergency shelter to open in summer|website=Times of Malta}}</ref> [[Roxy Cinema]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lovinmalta.com/lifestyle/property/only-hours-left-before-classic-cinema-in-birkirkara-gets-go-ahead-for-demolition|title=Only Hours Left Before Classic Cinema In Birkirkara Gets Go-Ahead For Demolition|first=Johnathan|last=Cilia|website=lovinmalta.com}}</ref> [[Birkirkara Tower]], [[Tal-Wejter Tower]], the [[Wignacourt Aqueduct]], [[Villa Lauri]], [[Villa Chelsea]], Saint Helen Palace, Band Clubs, Political Clubs, the [[Birkirkara Civic Centre]], [[Ta' Ganu Windmill]], amongst others.\n\nThe Birkirkara Law Courts were built in the 19th century and the building has been converted into a house.<ref>{{cite web|last=Young|first=Raymond|title=4 Bedroom Palazzo For Sale in Birkirkara|url=https://www.propertymarket.com.mt/view/4-bedroom-palazzo-for-sale-birkirkara-133869/|work=Property Market|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905155012/https://www.propertymarket.com.mt/view/4-bedroom-palazzo-for-sale-birkirkara-133869/|archive-date=5 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114124242/https://franksalt.com.mt/properties/313748|title=Birkirkara, Converted Palazzo|date=14 January 2018|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>\n\nAs a busy town, Birkirkara has a high incidence of car accidents, topping the list for the third quarter of 2016.<ref>{{cite web|author=Allied Newspapers Ltd |url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20161020/local/and-the-accident-capital-of-malta-is-birkirkara.628571 |title=And the accident capital of Malta is...
