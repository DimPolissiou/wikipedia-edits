The film was screened in the U.S. Dramatic Competition section at the [[2019 Sundance Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-doc-dianne-feinstein-drama-sundance-2019-lineup-1164468|title=Sundance Unveils Politics-Heavy Lineup Featuring Ocasio-Cortez Doc, Feinstein Drama|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Tatiana|last=Siegel|date=November 28, 2018|accessdate=November 28, 2018}}</ref> and was theatrically released in the United States on July 12, 2019, by [[A24 (company)|A24]].

After receiving a rejection letter for a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], Billi discovers from her parents, Haiyan and Jian, that Nai Nai has been diagnosed with [[terminal illness|terminal]] [[lung cancer]], and is predicted to have only a few months left to live.\n\nThrough deception and manipulation of medical test results, the diagnosis is kept a secret from Nai Nai herself. Nai Nai is, instead, falsely told that her recent doctor visits have only revealed [[benign tumor|benign findings]]. A wedding for Billi's cousin, Hao Hao, from Japan has been planned in China, as an excuse to unite the family to spend what is expected to be one last time with Nai Nai. Fearing Billi will end up exposing the lie to her grandmother, Haiyan and Jian tell her to remain in New York City.\n\nBilli disobeys her parents' orders and flies to Changchun, shortly after the rest of the family arrive there. Billi assures her parents that she will not reveal the cancer diagnosis to Nai Nai. Throughout the trip, however, she clashes with the rest of the family, including the doctor treating her grandmother, over their deliberate dishonesty towards her grandmother.\n\nGuilt-ridden, Billi expresses conflicted thoughts with her parents over the Chinese cultural beliefs that result in a family refusing to disclose such a life-threatening disease with the matriarch. One night, her uncle, Haibin, contends that the lie allows the family to bear the emotional burden of the diagnosis, rather than Nai Nai herself\u2014a practice of [[collectivism]] that Haibin acknowledges to Billi differs from the individualistic values common in Western culture. Billi later learns that Nai Nai also told a similar lie to her husband up until his death when he was terminally ill.\n\nOn the day of the wedding, both Haibin and Hao Hao break down in tears on separate occasions but manage to proceed through the rest of the banquet as planned without raising Nai Nai's suspicions. To maintain the family lie, Billi intercepts Nai Nai's medical test results from the hospital and has it altered to reflect a clean bill of health. That night, Nai Nai gives Billi a [[red envelope|h\u00f3ngb\u0101o]], encouraging her to spend the money as she chooses. Billi admits that she wants to stay in Changchun to spend more time with Nai Nai, but Nai Nai declines, telling her that she needs to live her own life. When Billi reveals to her grandmother about the Guggenheim Fellowship rejection, Nai Nai responds by encouraging Billi to keep an open mind and not get hung up on this failure, rather than be \"the bull endlessly ramming its horns into the corner of the room.\" She also says that life is not about what the things she does, but more so about how she goes about doing them.\n\nBilli keeps her promise to maintain the lie and shares a tearful goodbye with Nai Nai, as the rest of the visiting family members return to their homes in Japan and America. The credits reveal that six years after her diagnosis, the woman Nai Nai's character was based on is still alive.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Awkwafina]] as Billi Wang ({{lang-zh|\u738b\u6bd4\u8389}})\n* [[Tzi Ma]] as Haiyan Wang ({{lang|zh|\u738b\u6d77\u71d5}}), Billi's father\n* Diana Lin as Lu Jian ({{lang|zh|\u9646\u5efa}}), Billi's mother\n*[[Zhao Shu-zhen]] as Nai Nai ({{lang|zh|\u5976\u5976}}), Billi's paternal grandmother\n* Lu Hong (playing herself) as Little Nai Nai, Billi's grandmother's younger sister\n* Jiang Yongbo as Haibin ({{lang|zh|\u6d77\u6ee8}}), Haiyan's older brother\n* Chen Han as Hao Hao ({{lang|zh|\u6d69\u6d69}}), Haibin's son\n* Aoi Mizuhara as Aiko ({{lang-ja|\u7231\u5b50}}), Hao Hao's Japanese fianc\u00e9e\n* Zhang Jing as Yuping, Haiyan's cousin\n* Li Xiang as Aunty Ling, Haibin's wife\n* Yang Xuejian as Mr. Li\n* Jim Liu as Dr. Song\n\n==Production==\nThe film was based on a story called ''What You Don't Know'' that was initially shared by Wang on ''[[This American Life]]'' in April 2016.<ref name=\"thisamericanlife\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thisamericanlife.org/585/in-defense-of-ignorance|title=What You Don't Know|website=[[This American Life]]|date=April 22, 2016|access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/07/the-farewell-lulu-wang-interview-a24-1202158932/|title='The Farewell': Lulu Wang Made the Year's Most Exciting Hit By Refusing to Whitewash It|website=[[IndieWire]]|first=Eric|last=Kohn|date=July 18, 2019|access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref> Wang said that the film was based on her grandmother's illness, stating that \"I always felt the divide in my relationship to my family versus my relationship to my classmates and to my colleagues and to the world that I inhabit.

The film was screened in the U.S. Dramatic Competition section at the [[2019 Sundance Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-doc-dianne-feinstein-drama-sundance-2019-lineup-1164468|title=Sundance Unveils Politics-Heavy Lineup Featuring Ocasio-Cortez Doc, Feinstein Drama|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Tatiana|last=Siegel|date=November 28, 2018|accessdate=November 28, 2018}}</ref> and was theatrically released in the United States on July 12, 2019, by [[A24 (company)|A24]].

After receiving a rejection letter for a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], Billi discovers from her parents, Haiyan and Jian, that Nai Nai has been diagnosed with [[terminal illness|terminal]] [[lung cancer]], and is predicted to have only a few months left to live.\n\nThrough deception and manipulation of medical test results, the diagnosis is kept a secret from Nai Nai herself. Nai Nai is, instead, falsely told that her recent doctor visits have only revealed [[benign tumor|benign findings]]. A wedding for Billi's cousin, Hao Hao, from Japan has been planned in China, as an excuse to unite the family to spend what is expected to be one last time with Nai Nai. Fearing Billi will end up exposing the lie to her grandmother, Haiyan and Jian tell her to remain in New York City.\n\nBilli disobeys her parents' orders and flies to Changchun, shortly after the rest of the family arrive there. Billi assures her parents that she will not reveal the cancer diagnosis to Nai Nai. Throughout the trip, however, she clashes with the rest of the family, including the doctor treating her grandmother, over their deliberate dishonesty towards her grandmother.\n\nGuilt-ridden, Billi expresses conflicted thoughts with her parents over the Chinese cultural beliefs that result in a family refusing to disclose such a life-threatening disease with the matriarch. One night, her uncle, Haibin, contends that the lie allows the family to bear the emotional burden of the diagnosis, rather than Nai Nai herself\u2014a practice of [[collectivism]] that Haibin acknowledges to Billi differs from the individualistic values common in Western culture. Billi later learns that Nai Nai also told a similar lie to her husband up until his death when he was terminally ill.\n\nOn the day of the wedding, both Haibin and Hao Hao break down in tears on separate occasions but manage to proceed through the rest of the banquet as planned without raising Nai Nai's suspicions. To maintain the family lie, Billi intercepts Nai Nai's medical test results from the hospital and has it altered to reflect a clean bill of health. That night, Nai Nai gives Billi a [[red envelope|h\u00f3ngb\u0101o]], encouraging her to spend the money as she chooses. Billi admits that she wants to stay in Changchun to spend more time with Nai Nai, but Nai Nai declines, telling her that she needs to live her own life. When Billi reveals to her grandmother about the Guggenheim Fellowship rejection, Nai Nai responds by encouraging Billi to keep an open mind and not get hung up on this failure, rather than be \"the bull endlessly ramming its horns into the corner of the room.\" She also says that life is not about what the things she does, but more so about how she goes about doing them.\n\nBilli keeps her promise to maintain the lie and shares a tearful goodbye with Nai Nai, as the rest of the visiting family members return to their homes in Japan and America. The credits reveal that six years after her diagnosis, the woman Nai Nai's character was based on is still alive.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Awkwafina]] as Billi Wang ({{lang-zh|\u738b\u6bd4\u8389}})\n* [[Tzi Ma]] as Haiyan Wang ({{lang|zh|\u738b\u6d77\u71d5}}), Billi's father\n* Diana Lin as Lu Jian ({{lang|zh|\u9646\u5efa}}), Billi's mother\n*[[Zhao Shu-zhen]] as Nai Nai ({{lang|zh|\u5976\u5976}}), Billi's paternal grandmother\n* Lu Hong (playing herself) as Little Nai Nai, Billi's grandmother's younger sister\n* Jiang Yongbo as Haibin ({{lang|zh|\u6d77\u6ee8}}), Haiyan's older brother\n* Chen Han as Hao Hao ({{lang|zh|\u6d69\u6d69}}), Haibin's son\n* Aoi Mizuhara as Aiko ({{lang-ja|\u7231\u5b50}}), Hao Hao's Japanese fianc\u00e9e\n* Zhang Jing as Yuping, Haiyan's cousin\n* Li Xiang as Aunty Ling, Haibin's wife\n* Yang Xuejian as Mr. Li\n* Jim Liu as Dr. Song\n\n==Production==\nThe film was based on a story called ''What You Don't Know'' that was initially shared by Wang on ''[[This American Life]]'' in April 2016.<ref name=\"thisamericanlife\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thisamericanlife.org/585/in-defense-of-ignorance|title=What You Don't Know|website=[[This American Life]]|date=April 22, 2016|access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/07/the-farewell-lulu-wang-interview-a24-1202158932/|title='The Farewell': Lulu Wang Made the Year's Most Exciting Hit By Refusing to Whitewash It|website=[[IndieWire]]|first=Eric|last=Kohn|date=July 18, 2019|access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref> Wang said that the film was based on her grandmother's illness, stating that \"I always felt the divide in my relationship to my family versus my relationship to my classmates and to my colleagues and to the world that I inhabit.

This gives them the power to pick the teams for the week's maxi challenge which is to star in two parody films 'Why It Gotta Be Black, Panther?' (parody of '[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]') and 'Good God Girl Get Out' (parody of '[[Get Out]]'). The teams then assign roles and perform in front of the camera while Ross and Michelle direct.\n\nOn the main stage, the category is 'What's Your Sign?' where the queens dress according to their zodiac signs. A'Keria C. Davenport, Honey Davenport, Nina West, Ra'Jah O'Hara, Silky Nutmeg Ganache, and Vanessa Vanjie Mateo are declared safe. Ariel Versace, Brooke Lynn Hytes, Kahanna Montrese, and Mercedes Iman Diamond receive negative critiques of their performances in the challenge but Brooke Lynn and Ariel receive praise for their runway looks. Meanwhile, Plastique Tiara, Scarlet Envy, Shuga Cain, and Yvie Oddly receive positive critiques with Plastique, Scarlet, and Yvie receiving positive feedback on their runways and Shuga receiving mixed reviews. After the judges deliberate Scarlet Envy and Yvie Oddly are both declared the winners of the challenge while Kahanna Montrese and Mercedes Iman Diamond are placed in the bottom two.

They select their teams for the maxi challenge which is to make a parody Christian talk show to worship a diva. Nina's team pick [[Britney Spears]] and Ra'Jah's team select [[Mariah Carey]]. The queens are then directed by Ross and perform their show in one take.\n\nOn the main stage, the category is 'Fringe' and the queens each present a fringe inspired look. Team Nina West are declared the winners of the challenge and Ru compliments both Vanessa Vanjie Mateo and Ariel Versace for their excellent performances but Nina is declared the overall challenge winner. Team Ra'Jah O'Hara is declared the losing team and all six of the team's members (A'Keria C. Davenport, Honey Davenport, Plastique Tiara, Ra'Jah, Scarlet Envy, and Shuga Cain) are critiqued for severely lackluster performances and a general lack of knowledge about Mariah Carey, though most of their runways are well-received. When every member of Team Ra'Jah claims that they were all to blame for the failing challenge, Ru puts every team member up for elimination, having the six of them lipsync to \"[[Waiting for Tonight|Waiting for Tonight (Hex Hector Mix)]]\" by [[Jennifer Lopez]]. Ru announces first that Plastique is safe, followed by Ra'Jah, Scarlet, and A'Keria.

Immediately after the mini challenge, RuPaul brings back to the workroom six queens that were eliminated earlier in the competition -- Shuga Cain, Plastique Tiara, Scarlet Envy, Ariel Versace, Honey Davenport, and Soju. RuPaul then describes the main challenge, where each of the remaining queens has to use her own drag aesthetic to makeover one of the eliminated queens as a member of her drag house. The eliminated queens have to wear large pink gloves during the makeover so they are prevented from doing their own makeup. RuPaul also explains that the eliminated queens would not be returning to the competition and that they are only present for this challenge. Since Brooke Lynn won the mini challenge, she wins the right to pair the remaining and eliminated queens. She chooses Plastique for herself, then pairs Shuga with Nina West, Honey with A'Keria C.

Seven of the queens say Silky should go home, while the other five say Yvie should. Despite everyone expecting Vanessa Vanjie Mateo to win the challenge, Brooke Lynn Hytes is declared the winner of the challenge instead. Nina West and Silky Nutmeg Ganache are declared the bottom two, and the pair lip syncs to \"[[No Scrubs]]\" by [[TLC (group)|TLC]].

While most the queens receive mainly positive critiques for both their runways and performances, particularly Yvie Oddly, both Vanessa Vanjie Mateo and Brooke Lynn Hytes receive negative critiques from the judges. Vanessa is criticized for a disconnect in her performance, which was considered the weakest in the group, and a relatively basic runway look, while Brooke Lynn is panned for lacking 'edge' and passion in the video recording, as well as having the weakest runway look out of everyone, which the judges question as being her 'Best Drag'.

The next day on the main stage, the two groups perform their shows in front of the judges and a live audience,\n\nThe next day on the main stage, the runway category is 'Caftan Realness' and the queens each present their outfits. Ru and the judges then critique the girls and both Brooke Lynn Hytes and Nina West are highly praised for both their outfits and performances. Shuga Cain receives praise for being part of the best team but is critiqued for being overshadowed and Michelle criticizes her [[caftan]] runway (which consisted of three looks and two reveals), stating the original look was strong enough that the other two weren't needed. The other team receive varying levels of negative critiques for their performances, with A'Keria C. Davenport receiving the best critique performance-wise, but Vanessa Vanjie Mateo and Yvie Oddly are particularly praised for their runways.

Brooke Lynn Hytes is deemed to have the best reactions to being slapped and is declared the winner. Immediately after the mini challenge, RuPaul brings back to the workroom six queens that were eliminated earlier in the competition -- Shuga Cain, Plastique Tiara, Scarlet Envy, Ariel Versace, Honey Davenport, and Soju. RuPaul then describes the main challenge, where each of the remaining queens has to use her own drag aesthetic to makeover one of the eliminated queens as a member of her drag house. The eliminated queens have to wear large pink gloves during the makeover so they are prevented from doing their own makeup. RuPaul also explains that the eliminated queens would not be returning to the competition and that they are only present for this challenge. Since Brooke Lynn won the mini challenge, she wins the right to pair the remaining and eliminated queens. She chooses Plastique for herself, then pairs Shuga with Nina West, Honey with A'Keria C. Davenport, Scarlet with Yvie Oddly, Soju with Silky Nutmeg Ganache (much to the latter's dismay), and Ariel with Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.\n\nOn the main stage, A'Keria C. Davenport, Brooke Lynn Hytes, and Vanessa Vanjie Mateo receive positive comments for their respective makeovers, while Nina West, Silky Nutmeg Ganache, and Yvie Oddly receive negative critiques. After the judges' critiques, RuPaul asks all of the queens (both the remaining and eliminated queens) which of the remaining queens deserves to go home and why. Seven of the queens say Silky should go home, while the other five say Yvie should. Despite everyone expecting Vanessa Vanjie Mateo to win the challenge, Brooke Lynn Hytes is declared the winner of the challenge instead. Nina West and Silky Nutmeg Ganache are declared the bottom two, and the pair lip syncs to \"[[No Scrubs]]\" by [[TLC (group)|TLC]].

The queens each record their verses with [[Todrick Hall]] and are later choreographed by him. After each appearing on the podcast the queens take part in the one-take recording of the video, set in a club.\n\nOn the main stage, the queens present their 'Best Drag'. Ru then gets the queens to give advice to (pictures of) their younger selves. The judges then proceed to critique them on their performances. While most the queens receive mainly positive critiques for both their runways and performances, particularly Yvie Oddly, both Vanessa Vanjie Mateo and Brooke Lynn Hytes receive negative critiques from the judges. Vanessa is criticized for a disconnect in her performance, which was considered the weakest in the group, and a relatively basic runway look, while Brooke Lynn is panned for lacking 'edge' and passion in the video recording, as well as having the weakest runway look out of everyone, which the judges question as being her 'Best Drag'. Ru announces that A'Keria C. Davenport, Silky Nutmeg Ganache, and Yvie Oddly all progress on to the finale and places Brooke Lynn Hytes and Vanessa Vanjie Mateo in the bottom two.

It is a relatively strong base. \n\nCalcium hypochlorite solution is [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] as the hypochlorite [[anion]] can accept a [[Hydron (chemistry)|proton]] from a water molecule leaving a [[hydroxyl]] [[anion]] in solution. This basicity is due to the propensity for the [[hypochlorite]] anion to accept a proton to become [[hypochlorous acid]], a [[Acid strength|weak]] acid:\n\n:{{chem|ClO|-}} + H<sub>2</sub>O \u2194 HClO + {{chem|OH|-}}\n\nThe hypochlorite anion is also a strong [[oxidizing agent]] containing a [[chlorine]] atom at the valence I (redox state: Cl+1) which reacts under acidic conditions with the [[Reducing agent|reduced]] [[chloride]] species (Cl<sup>\u2013</sup>, here the [[reducing agent]]) present in [[hydrochloric acid]] to form [[calcium chloride]], [[water]] and gaseous [[chlorine]]. The overall reaction is:\n\n:Ca(ClO)<sub>2</sub> + 4 HCl \u2192 CaCl<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O + 2 Cl<sub>2</sub>\n\n==Safety==\nCalcium hypochlorite is stored dry and cold, away from any acid, organic materials, and metals. The hydrated form is safer to handle. If accidentally mixed with a strong acid as e.g., hydrochloric acid, a sudden outgassing of toxic and corrosive elemental chlorine can occur. Chlorine emanations are harmful and can create severe pulmonary problems.\n\nWhy is anhydrous less safe? Being in solution allows for reaction to occur. Say a container busts, if liquid it corrodes the metal cabinet, maybe in contact with tissue or acids. Solid, well, just stays in broken bottle...I'm no chemist.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://chemicalland21.com/industrialchem/inorganic/CALCIUM%20HYPOCHLORITE.htm Chemical Land]\n\n{{Calcium compounds}}\n\n[[Category:Antiseptics]]\n[[Category:Bleaches]]\n[[Category:Hypochlorites]]\n[[Category:Calcium compounds]]\n[[Category:Oxidizing agents]]\n", "text_old": "{{chembox\n| Watchedfields = changed\n| verifiedrevid = 450959568\n| Name = Calcium hypochlorite\n| ImageFile = Calcium hypochlorite.png\n| ImageSize = \n| ImageName = Calcium hypochlorite\n| OtherNames = Hypochlorous acid calcium salt<br />Bleaching powder, Calcium oxychloride or chloride of lime\n| IUPACName = \n| SystematicName = \n| Section1 = {{Chembox Identifiers\n| ChemSpiderID_Ref = {{chemspidercite|correct|chemspider}}\n| ChemSpiderID = 22912\n| InChI = 1S/Cacl.ClO/c;1-2/q+2;2*-1\n| SMILES = Cl[O-].[Ca+2].Cl[O-]\n| InChIKey = ZKQDCIXGCQPQNV-UHFFFAOYAV\n| StdInChI_Ref = {{stdinchicite|correct|chemspider}}\n| StdInChI = 1S/Ca.2ClO/c;2*1-2/q+2;2*-1\n| StdInChIKey_Ref = {{stdinchicite|correct|chemspider}}\n| StdInChIKey = ZKQDCIXGCQPQNV-UHFFFAOYSA-N\n| CASNo = 7778-54-3\n| CASNo_Ref = {{cascite|correct|CAS}}\n| EINECS = 231-908-7\n| PubChem = 24504\n| RTECS = NH3485000\n| UNNumber = 1748 2208\n| ChEBI = 31342\n| ChEMBL = 2251447\n| KEGG = D01727\n| UNII = 11DXB629VZ\n  }}\n| Section2 = {{Chembox Properties\n| Formula = Ca(ClO)<sub>2</sub>\n| MolarMass = 142.98 g/mol\n| Appearance = white/gray powder\n| Density = 2.35 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (20 \u00b0C)\n| Solubility = 21 g/100 mL at 25 \u00b0C\n| SolubleOther = reacts in [[alcohol]]\n| MeltingPtC = 100\n| MeltingPt_notes = \n| BoilingPtC = 175\n| BoilingPt_notes = decomposes\n  }}\n| Section3 = {{Chembox Hazards\n| ExternalSDS = [http://www.inchem.org/documents/icsc/icsc/eics0638.htm ICSC 0638]\n| GHSPictograms = {{GHS03}}{{GHS05}}{{GHS07}}{{GHS09}}\n| GHSSignalWord = Danger\n| HPhrases = {{H-phrases|272|302|314|400}}\n| PPhrases = {{P-phrases|210|220|221|260|264|270|273|280|301+312|301+330+331|303+361+353|304+340|305+351+338|310|321|330|363|370+378|391|405|501}}\n| NFPA-H = 3\n| NFPA-F = 0\n| NFPA-R = 1\n| NFPA-S = OX\n| FlashPt = Non-flammable\n| LD50 = 850 mg/kg (oral, rat)\n  }}\n| Section4 = \n| Section5 = \n| Section6 = \n| Section8 = {{Chembox Related\n| OtherAnions = [[Calcium chloride]]\n| OtherCations = [[Sodium hypochlorite]]\n  }}\n}}\n\n'''Calcium hypochlorite''' is an [[inorganic compound]] with [[chemical formula|formula]] {{calcium}}({{hypochlorite}})<sub>2</sub>.
