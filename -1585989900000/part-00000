{"title_page": "List of South African slang words", "text_new": "{{short description|wikimedia list article}}\n{{use South African English|date=September 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\nSBWL SBWL\n\n== Afrikanerisms ==\n\nThis list of \"Afrikanerisms\" comprises slang words and phrases influenced by [[Afrikaans]]. Typical users include people with Afrikaans as their first language but who speak English as a second language and people living in areas where the population speaks both English and Afrikaans. Many of these terms also occur widely amongst ethnic/native South Africans, and others living in neighbouring countries such as Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia etc. These terms do not occur in formal [[South African English]]. Note when the letter \"g\" is either the first or last letter of the word or syllable, it is pronounced as an unvoiced velar fricative in the back of the throat. Note, words ending in \"-ng\" are pronounced identical to those in English. Note, in most cases of plurals ending in -nde, the \"d\" falls away in the informal pronunciation and spelling and the \"n\" is duplicated in sound and re-positioned within the degrees of comparison. For example: Tande (plural of tand; \"tooth\"), formal = \"tande\", informal = \"tanne\". In singular words' syllables ending in \"-d\", \"-nd\" and \"-heid\", the \"d\" is always pronounced as a \"t\". For example: \"ge-son(t)-hei(t)\" (gesondheid, \"health\"). Note, the English term ''slang'' is used strictly in its English pronunciation in context, as the Afrikaans word of the same spelling (though pronounced as \"slung\") translates as \"snake\".\n\nFanakalo ([[fanagalo]]) also refers to when people of non-Zulu origin attempt to speak Zulu without the proper pronunciation and throat sounds.\n''Fanakalo'' in Zulu literally means \"same as this\" \u2013 (fana \u2013 same, ka \u2013 as, lo \u2013 this).\n\n=== A\u2013M ===\n* ''aap'' \u2013 lit. ape/monkey.

You could say, \"Hey ''bro'', ''howzit''\" or \"Thanks a million ''bro'' for lending me your car\". When you refer to another male as ''bro'' is it because you consider that person to be such a good friend he is like a brother, a family member.

Typical users include people with Afrikaans as their first language but who speak English as a second language and people living in areas where the population speaks both English and Afrikaans. Many of these terms also occur widely amongst ethnic/native South Africans, and others living in neighbouring countries such as Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia etc. These terms do not occur in formal [[South African English]]. Note when the letter \"g\" is either the first or last letter of the word or syllable, it is pronounced as an unvoiced velar fricative in the back of the throat. Note, words ending in \"-ng\" are pronounced identical to those in English. Note, in most cases of plurals ending in -nde, the \"d\" falls away in the informal pronunciation and spelling and the \"n\" is duplicated in sound and re-positioned within the degrees of comparison. For example: Tande (plural of tand; \"tooth\"), formal = \"tande\", informal = \"tanne\".

A [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of UPN's ''[[Moesha]]'', ''The Parkers'' features the mother-daughter team of Nikki (played by [[Mo'Nique]]) and Kim Parker (played by [[Countess Vaughn]]).\n\nAnd nikki and the perfect fhjrhrijjrkt\n\n==Premise==\nThe series centers around a mother and daughter who both attend [[Santa Monica College]]. Nikki Parker was forced to drop out of high school when she discovered she was pregnant with daughter Kim. After Kim reaches adulthood, Nikki decides to go back to school. Kim is initially mortified with this decision, but eventually accepts the situation. Nikki and Kim's mother-daughter relationship evolves as roommates and as students. Nikki adjusts to the fact that her daughter is old enough to live on her own, while Kim realizes that Nikki has more going on than just being her mom.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{inuniverse|section|date=March 2020}}\n===Main===\n[[File:The parkers cast early season 1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''The Parkers'' main characters of Season 1: (l-r) Nikki Parker, Desiree Littlejohn, Kim Parker and Professor Oglevee (center)]]\n* '''Kimberly Ann \"Kim\" Parker''' (played by [[Countess Vaughn]]) is the first of the two [[protagonist]]s of the series. Kim is funny and lovable, but very dimwitted. Though she is usually behind most people when it comes to academics, her big heart and dreams makes up for it. Kim is also a lead singer in the group named Free Style Unity, which also include her friends Stevie and \"T\". At the end of series, she does not graduate from Santa Monica Community College due to failing grades. However, Kim goes on to become a successful fashion designer (Kim originated as a regular character on ''Moesha'').\n* '''Nicole Ann \"Nikki\" Parker''' (n\u00e9e '''West''') (played by [[Mo'Nique]]) is the second of the two protagonists of the series. Nikki cares a lot for her family, and lets nothing stand in the way of love.   Throughout the series, she has several relationships with other people but her love always remains steadfast for the Professor Oglevee, despite his apparent hatred of her (a running gag that occurs throughout the series) In the series finale, she finally wins him over after five years of chasing him. He proposes to her, she accepts and they marry on that same day.\n* '''Desiree Littlejohn''' (played by [[Mari Morrow]]) \u2013 Originally, the Parkers' neighbor and Nikki's friend. She only appears in the first season and is not credited as a regular after just five episodes during the season. She is not seen after episode 13 and is replaced by the Andell Wilkerson character. \n* '''Stevie Alison Van Lowe''' (played by [[Jenna von O\u00ff]]) is Kim's constant companion. Stevie is from a wealthy family and has a tempestuous relationship with her mother. She is also a member of the group Free Style Unity, along with Kim and \"T\" (whom she briefly dates). Upon graduating from Santa Monica Community College, Stevie attends [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and goes into business with Kim. \n* '''Thaddeus \"T\" Tyrell Radcliffe''' (played by [[Ken Lawson]]) is best friends with Kim and Stevie. Although his duty as a loyal friend, \"T\" can sometimes be side-tracked when he and the professor let their wannabe mack daddy status get in the way of true values. He is also the rapper in his, Kim, and Stevie's, group, Free Style Unity. At the end of the series, \"T\" goes on to attend [[Berklee College of Music]].\n* '''Professor Stanley De'Vant\u00e9 Oglevee''' (played by [[Dorien Wilson]]) is a Professor at Santa Monica Community College who Nikki is constantly pursuing. He loses several companions (particularly Veronica), because Nikki either scares them off or completely sabotages the relationship. He is a type of role model to \"T\" and often counsels him about love\u2014sometimes with disastrous results. Twice during the series he is convinced he loves Nikki, but changed his mind the first time. The second time, which occurs in the series finale, he realizes that deep down he has feelings for her. Depressed and confused, he sees a vision of himself in the mirror that ultimately convinces him to crash Nikki's wedding to a man she met several weeks prior, and propose marriage. Nikki accepts and they marry on that same day.\n* '''Andell Wilkerson''' (played by [[Yvette Wilson]]), is Nikki Parker's ever loving and loyal best friend replacing Desiree Littlejohn. Andell originated as a regular character on ''Moesha'' and appears on ''The Parkers'' in a recurring role during the first season but becoming a main character starting from mid-Season 1. From Season 3 onwards, she is the owner of her self-named place of business \"Andell's\", a restaurant that is the setting for several episodes.

A [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of UPN's ''[[Moesha]]'', ''The Parkers'' features the mother-daughter team of Nikki (played by [[Mo'Nique]]) and Kim Parker (played by [[Countess Vaughn]]).\n\n==Premise==\nThe series centers around a mother and daughter who both attend [[Santa Monica College]]. Nikki Parker was forced to drop out of high school when she discovered she was pregnant with daughter Kim. After Kim reaches adulthood, Nikki decides to go back to school. Kim is initially mortified with this decision, but eventually accepts the situation. Nikki and Kim's mother-daughter relationship evolves as roommates and as students. Nikki adjusts to the fact that her daughter is old enough to live on her own, while Kim realizes that Nikki has more going on than just being her mom.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{inuniverse|section|date=March 2020}}\n===Main===\n[[File:The parkers cast early season 1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''The Parkers'' main characters of Season 1: (l-r) Nikki Parker, Desiree Littlejohn, Kim Parker and Professor Oglevee (center)]]\n* '''Kimberly Ann \"Kim\" Parker''' (played by [[Countess Vaughn]]) is the first of the two [[protagonist]]s of the series. Kim is funny and lovable, but very dimwitted. Though she is usually behind most people when it comes to academics, her big heart and dreams makes up for it. Kim is also a lead singer in the group named Free Style Unity, which also include her friends Stevie and \"T\". At the end of series, she does not graduate from Santa Monica Community College due to failing grades. However, Kim goes on to become a successful fashion designer (Kim originated as a regular character on ''Moesha'').\n* '''Nicole Ann \"Nikki\" Parker''' (n\u00e9e '''West''') (played by [[Mo'Nique]]) is the second of the two protagonists of the series. Nikki cares a lot for her family, and lets nothing stand in the way of love.   Throughout the series, she has several relationships with other people but her love always remains steadfast for the Professor Oglevee, despite his apparent hatred of her (a running gag that occurs throughout the series) In the series finale, she finally wins him over after five years of chasing him. He proposes to her, she accepts and they marry on that same day.\n* '''Desiree Littlejohn''' (played by [[Mari Morrow]]) \u2013 Originally, the Parkers' neighbor and Nikki's friend. She only appears in the first season and is not credited as a regular after just five episodes during the season. She is not seen after episode 13 and is replaced by the Andell Wilkerson character. \n* '''Stevie Alison Van Lowe''' (played by [[Jenna von O\u00ff]]) is Kim's constant companion. Stevie is from a wealthy family and has a tempestuous relationship with her mother. She is also a member of the group Free Style Unity, along with Kim and \"T\" (whom she briefly dates). Upon graduating from Santa Monica Community College, Stevie attends [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and goes into business with Kim. \n* '''Thaddeus \"T\" Tyrell Radcliffe''' (played by [[Ken Lawson]]) is best friends with Kim and Stevie. Although his duty as a loyal friend, \"T\" can sometimes be side-tracked when he and the professor let their wannabe mack daddy status get in the way of true values. He is also the rapper in his, Kim, and Stevie's, group, Free Style Unity. At the end of the series, \"T\" goes on to attend [[Berklee College of Music]].\n* '''Professor Stanley De'Vant\u00e9 Oglevee''' (played by [[Dorien Wilson]]) is a Professor at Santa Monica Community College who Nikki is constantly pursuing. He loses several companions (particularly Veronica), because Nikki either scares them off or completely sabotages the relationship. He is a type of role model to \"T\" and often counsels him about love\u2014sometimes with disastrous results. Twice during the series he is convinced he loves Nikki, but changed his mind the first time. The second time, which occurs in the series finale, he realizes that deep down he has feelings for her. Depressed and confused, he sees a vision of himself in the mirror that ultimately convinces him to crash Nikki's wedding to a man she met several weeks prior, and propose marriage. Nikki accepts and they marry on that same day.\n* '''Andell Wilkerson''' (played by [[Yvette Wilson]]), is Nikki Parker's ever loving and loyal best friend replacing Desiree Littlejohn. Andell originated as a regular character on ''Moesha'' and appears on ''The Parkers'' in a recurring role during the first season but becoming a main character starting from mid-Season 1. From Season 3 onwards, she is the owner of her self-named place of business \"Andell's\", a restaurant that is the setting for several episodes.  Throughout the show, she is usually the one keeping a level head but sometimes can be pessimistic. At the end of the series, she marries her boyfriend Lester. Originally, Andell was in a relationship with Moesha's uncle Bernie ([[Bernie Mac]]). He was mentioned once in the first series but was never seen on ''The Parkers''.\n[[File:The parkers cast seasons 1-5.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The Parkers'' main characters of Seasons 1\u20135 with Jenna von O\u00ff and Ken Lawson becoming regulars and the addition of Yvette Wilson (replacing Mari Morrow) joining the cast: (l-r) Professor Oglevee, Thaddeus \"T\" Radcliffe (back row), Andell Wilkerson, Nikki Parker, Kim Parker and Stevie Van Lowe (front row)]]\n\n===Recurring===\n* '''Mel Parker''' ([[Thomas Mikal Ford]]) \u2013 Nikki's rich ex-husband and Kim's father.\n* '''Erica Willis''' (Porscha Coleman) \u2013 Guest starring television role.\n* '''Regina Foster''' ([[Kara Brock]]) \u2013 Snobbish and stuck-up colleague of Nikki, Kim and Stevie's at Santa Monica Community College and also a member of the Triple A Sorority. \n* '''Joe Woody''' (Dwight Woody) \u2013 Works in the \"Grub Hub\" cafeteria at Santa Monica Community College.
