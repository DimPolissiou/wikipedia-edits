Central Presbyterian Church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\n\nThe building was designed by architects [[Carr\u00e8re and Hastings|Carrere & Hastings]] and Shreve, Lamb & Harmon. Carr\u00e8re and Hastings also designed the [[New York Public Library Main Branch|New York Public Library]]. \u00a0\n\nThe church's architecture reflects the simplicity of New England Colonial style with the Georgian style of many English churches. The church\u2019s spire was designed as a tribute to the hope and faith of the congregation, not to mention the many hands that helped build it. \n\nThere is seating capacity for 600 people on the main floor and 340 in the balcony. Next door is the adjoining church house, which was built for the many social and religious activities the church fostered. A large gym on the second floor hosted many basketball games and a proscenium stage was designed to host church plays and benefits. Downstairs, the Guild Room was, according to Reverend Wylie,\u00a0 devoted to the Women\u2019s Guild as a \u201crallying center, a place of beauty of\u00a0 inspiration and devotion.\u201d\n\n== Early History ==\nThe history of Central Presbyterian Church is entwined with the history of [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair, NJ]] and the history of the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|Presbyterian Church in the United States]]. \u00a0Although Central\u2019s official beginning is 1837, when the first cornerstone was laid, Central\u2019s origins reach back to 1667 when four men, Jasper Crane, Robert Treat, John Treat and John Curtis successfully requested and were granted land to freely practice their religious beliefs. King Charles II of England granted \u201cletters patent\u201d for a New Jersey colony. The four men, part of a group of 23 colonists, moved from Branford, Connecticut to the new colony \u201cat Newark on the Passaic\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|last=McSpadden|first=J Walker|title=The Central Presbyterian Church: The Story of a Hundred Years|publisher=|year=1937|isbn=|location=Montclair, NJ|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== 1667 - The Church in Newark ===\nJasper Crane, a member of the prestigious Crane family of Montclair, was one of the original founders of the church in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark, NJ]]. Dedicated on January 20, 1667, the church was 36 feet by 36 feet and was located on Broad Street south of Market Street. By 1706, the church was predominantly known as a Presbyterian church. In 1708, a much larger church of stone with a steeple and a bell was built. Throughout the 1700\u2019s, the colonists traveled 8 or more miles by foot or by horse to attend the Newark church. They came from the Oranges, the \u2018Mountain\u2019 as Montclair was called, and Bloomfield to hear their Sunday sermon. \u00a0\n\nWhile the Newark church was growing, the framework of the Presbyterian church was also taking shape. The first written record of the General Presbytery dates to 1705. By 1717, the First Synod, organized in Philadelphia, PA included four Presbyteries: Philadelphia, New Castle, Snow Hill and Long Island.\n\nIn 1776, war broke out between the colonists and England. The colonists longed for independence from the Mother Country. Presbyterians have long been considered primarily responsible for the American Revolution in 1776:\n\nPresbyterians were very involved in he American Revolution. In numbers, they were one of the most dominant national groups. They had migrated from Scotland and from the north of Ireland because of wars with the English kings; and persecutions developed by the English rulers. \n\nThe war continued for seven years until 1783, when colonists won the American Revolution. Religious freedom was integral to the newly independent, self-governing United States of America. In 1794, the first Presbyterian General Assembly began its Sessions.\n\nIn 1794, desiring their own local church, Bloomfield and [[Cranetown, New Jersey|Cranetown]] residents (as Montclair was called at that time) petitioned the Presbytery for a separate society located in Bloomfield. On October 20, 1796, \u201cThe Presbyterian Society of Bloomfield\u201d was born. On May 8, 1797, the cornerstone was laid in Bloomfield. The church bell was presented by Major Nathaniel Crane. Major Bloomfield gave $140.00, and Mrs. Bloomfield donated a Bible and Psalm book for the pulpit.\n\nIsaac Dodd was elected President of the Society. Samuel Ward, Ephraim Morris, Oliver Crane and Joseph Davis were trustees. The original subscribers who agreed to hire a minister for six months included the following Cranetown residents:\n\nOliver Crane, Stephen Fordham, William Crane, Simeon Crane, Widow Susanna Crane, Job Crane, Isaac Tomkins, Phineas Crane, Widow Dorcas Williams, David Riker, Samuel McChesney, Samuel Ward, John Vincent, Noah Crane, Jr., Noah Crane, Phebe Dod, James Gubs, Jr., Joseph Crane, John Baldwin, Nathaniel Dod, Israel Crane, Caleb Martin, Aaron Crane, Reuben Dod, Lewis Baldwin, Nathaniel Crane, Isaac Mitchell, Benjamin Crane, Eliakim Crane, Elizabeth Rouge, Thomas Force, William Holmes, Daniel Ougheltree, Levi Vincent, Cornelius Vincent, John Smith, Henry Shoemaker, John Fry, Widow Jane Crane, Zadok Crane, Samuel Tichenor, Peter Davis and Matthew Dod. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n=== 1837 \u2013 The Presbyterian Society of West Bloomfield ===\n\u201cResolved that it is expedient to build a church in this place.\u201d \u00a0 According to the Session Record dated August 31, 1837, this resolution officially marked the beginning of the Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair. A board of trustees and officers, elected at a meeting at the local schoolhouse, started planning for a Presbyterian society for West Bloomfield, the township informally known as Cranetown that later, in 1870, was officially recognized as Montclair.\n[[File:Central Presbyterian Church session.png|alt=1837 session notes|thumb|1837 session notes]]\n\n\nDespite the severe national economic downturn in 1837, when banks failed and bankruptcies were rife across America, \u201cThe Presbyterian Society of West Bloomfield\u201d was born and a new church was built. The schoolhouse already on the property was renovated. Its second story was removed and the school rooms were refinished for social meetings and Sunday school. The church was made of wood and built over these rooms. The church was located in the center of town, on a triangular-shaped block bordered by Bloomfield Avenue, Park Street and Church Street. Almost one year later to the day, on August 9, 1838, the church was formally dedicated.\n\nA $10,000 bequest by Major Nathaniel Crane provided the bedrock for the initial funding for the church. The committee and trustees included: Amos Crane, Eliam B. Crane, James Crane, Zenas S. Crane, Dr. Isaac D. Dodd, Jared E. Harrison, John Munn, Captain Joseph Munn, Cyrus Pierson, and William Smith. Decatur Harrison, an architect and Cranetown resident, designed the renovations and extensions.\n\nThe church cost $3,196.95 in addition to the $400 spent for the lot. Burial plots to the cemetery adjoining the church were sold to offset the deficit. The new church boasted 71 members and pews were sold for $25-$90 per year to offset the annual budget.\n\nThe Reverend Samuel Ware Fischer, son of one of New Jersey\u2019s noted preachers, was unanimously elected by Session to serve as the church\u2019s first pastor. He served from 1839 to 1849 and later served as President of Hamilton College. His initial salary, $7.00 per week, was eventually increased to $700 per year.\u00a0 In 1843, the chorister, Calvin S. Baldwin was paid $40 per year.\n\nThe first Session members were Mathias Smith, Elias Crane, Isaac B. Wheeler, and Moses Stiles. The first clerk of Session, John Munn, remained at this post for 25 years. The early records of the church were pristinely maintained by John Munn\u2019s fastidious attention to detail.\n\n=== 1856 \u2013 The First Presbyterian Church of Montclair \u2013 \u201cOld First\u201d ===\nBy 1856, the church membership\u2019s growth dictated the necessity for a larger building. The new building was built in back of the old one with $16,000 in subscriptions, stone from local freestone quarries, and the prayers, visions and hard work of many. Miss Mary Crane, Israel Crane\u2019s daughter, donated the 1,084 pound bell tuned in the Key of G and made at the foundry of Messrs. Jones & Hitchcock in Troy, New York.\n\nBy 1860, there were 85 families and 196 communicants. Pews cost $65-$340 per year and were sold to the highest bidder. Although Reverend Job Foster Halsey organized the building of the new larger church, a supply pastor, the Reverend Silas Billings officiated at the building\u2019s dedication. The church\u2019s new name: The First Presbyterian Church of Montclair.\n\n<br />\n\n=== The Civil War Years and Beyond ===\nFrom 1858-1861, Reverend Josiah Addison Priest served but resigned at the outbreak of the Civil War. During the Civil War years, from 1862-1867, the Reverend Nelson Millard served. Reverend Millard denounced slavery and supported the Union. His sermons were infused with political ideology.\n\nAt one point during his service, he took a leave of absence to serve as a senior member of the Christian Commission in Richmond, Virginia. He was charged with reestablishing local government and providing food and medical services to the war-ravaged area.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the church\u2019s growth reflected the town\u2019s rapidly expanding population. By 1870, Montclair\u2019s population reached 2,583, and the State Legislature authorized the town\u2019s name change to Montclair.\n\nBy the end of 1867, the congregation had grown to 300 members with a subscription of $4,101. The church bought the school next door and expanded the church to accommodate 700 people. In 1868, the new Township of Montclair\u2019s first board meeting was held in the church\u2019s lecture room.\n\nThe church\u2019s membership continued to grow. From 1870 -1887, despite a split of members to organize the Congregational Church, 532 persons joined. The Reverend Doctor J. Romeyn Barry led the congregation at First. The growth in spirituality corresponded with an enormous increase in giving. $50,000 of debt was liquidated, a stone chapel was built on Church Street, and $10,000 was set aside to build a parsonage. The congregation was so delighted with the Reverend Dr. J.R. Barry that, after his first year of service in 1870, they presented him with a purse of gold worth $300. Upon his leaving in 1887, the church gave him a gift of $5,000.\n\nThe church included a roster of townspeople who were integral to the founding and growth of Montclair. From the 17<sup>th</sup> century through World War II, the Crane family figured prominently in both Montclair\u2019s development and the church\u2019s growth. \n\nPhilip Doremus, whose family ran the largest general store in Montclair during the 19<sup>th</sup> century and in 1908, helped incorporate Montclair. \u00a0Doremus, who wrote a book on Montclair\u2019s history, was Superintendent of the church's Sunday school for almost 20 years. In 1856, Doremus hand wrote \u201cA Constitution of the West Bloomfield Presbyterian Sabbath School\u201d. He formed young people\u2019s societies for leadership opportunities and a social group for high school age children. He also led a discussion group for college-age adults.\n\nDuring this time, William B. Bradbury, the famous hymn writer and piano manufacturer used to visit the Sunday school and help teach the children the songs from his own books. When Bradbury was ill and near his death, Mr. Doremus surprised him with a large group of the Sunday school\u2019s children who filed in and marched around his room singing the hymns that Bradbury had written.\n\nIn 1886, a split in the congregation concerning church policy led to the formation of the Trinity Presbyterian Church. \u2018Old First\u2019, however, continued to grow during the years 1888-1900, when Reverend William F. Junkin served. Reverend Junkin, a former Confederate officer, had served as a lieutenant colonel and chaplain on General Stonewall Jackson\u2019s staff and served at the General\u2019s funeral service. Reverend Junkin passed away in 1900.\n\nFrom 1901-1913, Reverend Llewellyn Stover Fulmer served. He was the last minister to serve \u2018Old First\u2019. During this time, Trinity and Old First were engaged in conversations concerning a possible reunification. Reverend Fulmer resigned in 1913 to help bridge the new union when Old First and Trinity reunited.\n\n=== 1913 \u2013 The Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair ===\nOn December 2, 1913, Trinity and Old First merged and officially became The Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair. Together, there were 927 members. The Reverend Edmund Melville Wylie served as the first pastor of Central. During his years of service, from 1914-1931, Central grew and flourished. The new congregation held services at Trinity's church, located on the northwest corner of Midland and Claremont Avenues.\n\nCentral supported missionary work both domestically and around the globe. So prominent was the mission work of Central that the missionaries\u2019 names were featured on the cover of the weekly Sunday service program.\n\n''Following is a list of the missionaries supported by Central:''\n\nMr. and Mrs. C.W. McCleary ........................\u00a0 Elat Station, West Africa\n\nMiss F. Elizabeth Harris ...............................\u00a0 Dry Creek, West Virginia\n\nRev. and Mrs. Alfred William Moore ........... \u00a0Mainpuri, India\n\nRev. Giacinto J. Reale, Italian Mission ......... Montclair, New Jersey\n\n\n''Members engaged in mission work:''\n\nRev. Thomas F. Carter ...........................Nanhsuchou, China\n\nDr. Edward Mills Dodd .......................... Tabriz, Persia\n\nPeter Carter Speers ................................ Lahore, India\n\nJohn L. Mott ........................................... Nagpur, India\n\nJames L. Speers, Jr. ................................ Nanking, China\n\nDr. and Mrs. William S. Dodd .................

Czecho-Slavakia\n\nDr. Wilson Farnsworth Dodd .........Constantinople, Turkey\n\nMarian Crawford ..................................... Smith, Kentucky\n\nFlorence Goodall ..................................... Smith, Kentucky\n\n\nMr. and Mrs. C.W. McCleary were the first missionaries supported by Central. In 1903, they went to [[Cameroon]], Elat, West Africa. Although Mr. McCleary died six months after they arrived in West Africa, Mrs. McCleary stayed and taught more than 6,000 boys.\n\nCentral supported domestic missions as well. Miss F. Elizabeth Harris rode on horseback over 1,000 miles per year to help the community in Dry Creek, Virginia. Other missions included the Mountaineers School at Rock Creek, Tennessee; the Spring Street Neighborhood House in New York City. The Presbyterian Italian Mission in Montclair provided Italian immigrants with sermons in their native language.\n\nCentral\u2019s Women\u2019s Guild was renowned for its philosophy of service and good works.\u00a0 During World War I, Central\u2019s Women\u2019s Guild aided the relief agencies. \u00a0The Guild paid Mrs. McCleary\u2019s salary in West Africa. They formed a sewing department to make clothes for local charities and missionary requests. \u2018The Cut and Contrive Club\u2019 made dresses and coats for children, new suits and clothing for the missionaries. During World War I, the Guild partnered with the Red Cross to sew pajamas, shirts for the wounded, pneumonia jackets, gauze masks and bandages. While Pastor Wylie was away, after having been called to serve at a YMCA training camp in the South, the Guild formed a branch called \u2018Group Work\u2019. The groups were divided into districts of 50 families each and the women acted as Big Sisters reporting illness or trouble.<ref>\u201cA Celebration of Women in Central Presbyterian Church: Past and Present\u201d, a paper presented to the Women\u2019s Guild in 1977, Tate Elder.</ref>\n\n== 1922 - The Central Presbyterian Church at 46 Park Street ==\nBy 1916, Central had outgrown its building. The \u2018Committee of Twelve\u2019 was appointed and chose the site for the church currently at the corner of Park Street and Claremont Avenue. The architectural design company Carrere and Hastings, Shreve, Lamb and Blake Associates was hired. This company also designed the New York Public Library. \u00a0\n\nThe new church, the same church worshipped in today, is an architectural treasure embodying the simplicity of New England Colonial style with the Georgian style of many English churches. There is seating capacity for 600 people on the main floor and 340 in the balcony. The church\u2019s spire was designed as a tribute to the hope and faith of the congregation, not to mention the many hands that helped build it.\n\nNext door is the adjoining church house, built for the many social and religious activities the church hoped to foster. A large gym on the second floor hosted many basketball games and a proscenium stage was designed to host church plays and benefits. Downstairs, the Guild Room was, according to Reverend Wylie,\u00a0 devoted to the Women\u2019s Guild as a \u201crallying center, a place of beauty of\u00a0 inspiration and devotion.\u201d The new building had space for 750 Sunday School students! Reverend Wylie decried the enrollment in 1922 at 400 \u201cis but half the number that a School commensurate with the membership of our Church should comprise.\u201d\n\nOn October 15, 1922, the new Central Presbyterian Church held its dedication ceremony. At 10:30 a.m., the Gloria Trumpeters, using long trumpets and dressed in ankle-length white robes, stood outside the church portals and played \u201cA Mighty Fortress is Our God\u201d. The doors opened and the congregation filed in.\n\nReverend Wylie, the new associate pastor Reverend Rock and the officers met at the old church, held a brief service, and then marched to the new building. Before entering the building, they stood outside and sang two verses of the 100<sup>th</sup> Psalm, \u201cAll people that on earth do dwell.\u201d When they marched down the aisles, the entire congregation rose and sang the last two verses with them.\n\nDr. Cleland B. McAfee from the McCormick Theological Seminary preached the sermon aptly named \u201cThe Glory of the House.\u201d The church celebrated with a week\u2019s worth of activities including an organ recital, a Young People\u2019s Musical Service, and several special services.\n\nReverend Wylie called the church and adjoining church house \u201ca factory\u201d. There was always something going on. The church was a place where the congregation enjoyed spiritual education, work and play. The church was both a religious retreat and community center \u2013 a very different model than the than the church the forefathers probably had in mind! There was a gym for basketball, badminton, evening parties and dancing; an auditorium-sized stage for plays and programs, and a kitchen for church suppers. The four manual Skinner organ was a gift from the Women\u2019s Guild in memory of Mrs. Wylie, the minister\u2019s wife, who died unexpectedly in 1919.\n\nFrom 1927-1937, Carl F. Mueller was appointed organist and then Minister of Music. Mueller was already recognized as a masterful organist in his native hometown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Mueller developed a volunteer choir and steadily over the course of several years built the choir from forty voices to several different choirs totaling 100 voices. Through Mueller\u2019s inspired direction, Central\u2019s choir became very well-known throughout New Jersey and even sang on radio broadcasts.\n\nIn 1931, Mueller united the Central Choir with the State Teachers College in Montclair to form the Montclair Acapella Choir. Mr. Mueller wrote and published much of the music sung by the choir. Mueller's choral work, \"Create in Me a Clean Heart, O God\", sold nearly 2 million copies.\n\nIn 1931, citing ill health, Pastor Wylie resigned. The Great Depression was in full force. Central was not immune to the financial upheaval. The budget dropped by 25% causing much consternation and anxiety.\n\nIn April, 1932, the Reverend Morgan Phelps Noyes came to Central. A much loved pastor, he served until 1957. By 1937, the church was back on sound financial footing, the manse at 66 Park Street was razed and a house on North Mountain Avenue was leased for the pastor and his family. The membership had grown to 1,018 and the local and international mission work continued.\n\nReverend Noyes\u2019 service at Central encompassed World War II. During this time, many women from our church volunteered with the Red Cross working in local canteens, aiding nurses, visiting V.A. hospitals and working overseas. After the war, two Central Presbyterian church women were awarded Gold Stars for their work.\n\nWhen soldiers on leave visited Central, they were often invited for a home-cooked meal. Church members quite regularly corresponded with the soldiers. A scrapbook with thank you letters from the soldiers was kept by the church.\n\nDuring these years, the Women\u2019s Guild continued to meet one Tuesday each month for Guild Day. The women sewed in the morning, ate a luncheon for 25 cents, met for an afternoon business meeting and then enjoyed a program. Speakers on missions and social issues both local and national dominated the programs. \u00a0\n\n= Post World War II =\nIn 1950, Central ordained its first women elders. \u00a0Central member Edna Thistle, the first woman to serve communion at Central, wisely commented: \u201cThe significance of this victory for women was not the gaining of power per se but, rather, an affirmation of the responsibility they had assumed through their faithful work, their study, their training, their giving and their worship.\u201d \u00a0The first women elders were Lois Dean, Nellie Dodd Speers, and Rose Marzano. Two years later, Lila Speers, Lillian Applegate and Maude Dean were ordained. \u00a0\n\nIn the early 1950\u2019s, due to restrictive budgets and domestic needs, financial support for missionary work abroad had to be curtailed. Central\u2019s strong commitment to mission found a new outlet in giving: the nationally based Presbyterian Major Mission Fund. One third of the money went to special domestic and international programs, one third was targeted by donors for \u2018use wherever the need was greatest\u2019, and the balance was given without restrictions. Central was known to have exceeded its goal by $20,000 and to have given seven times the national per capita average.\n\n= The \u201860\u2019s =\nFrom 1958-1965, Reverend Paul Conine served at Central. At the time, budgetary problems caused a series of cutbacks for the church.\n\nIn 1966, Reverend Doctor Roger Hubert was called to serve Central. Considered a breath of fresh air by many, he brought many major contemporary issues to the attention of the church membership. Questions about the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, civil rights, women\u2019s rights and civil liberties, however, caused much dissension among church members, resulting in a large number of members leaving the church. Reverend Hubert remained until 1975. Following a period of poor health, he resigned, went to law school and joined the staff at Seton Hall Law School. \n\n= The Last Years of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century \u00a0 \u00a0 =\nFrom 1977 through 1987, Reverend Ernie Fogg served as Senior Pastor at Central. Before coming to Central, Reverend Fogg had balanced a career between leading mission efforts in Indonesia and running programs at Presbyterian headquarters at 475 Riverside Avenue in New York city. While at Central, Reverend Fogg mentored a dozen [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] students. He was involved with the Montclair Clergy Association, the Montclair Rotary, and Senior Care and Activity Center. Reverend Fogg was National President of the American Leprosy Association. At Central, Ernie excelled at both pastoral calling and organizing memorable worship services. During his time here, a successful Capital Campaign was held to update the kitchen and restore the steeple.\n\nEarly in his ministry, Central was one of the leading churches in New Jersey. Central supported the UPC\u2019s Major Mission Fund to create educational and medical mission programs here and overseas. His wife, C\u2019lee Fogg, was very active in the church, and the couple were very popular with the congregation. \n\nBy the 1980\u2019s, Central women were leading Newark presbytery committees. Alice Price, Bessie Marsh, Carole Brand and Mary Lee Fitzgerald led these various committees. Alice Price served as Central\u2019s first woman Clerk of Session. From 1985-86, she also served as moderator of the Newark Presbytery. The Sunday school, led by Connie Thurber, Marlene French, Terye McAnally and Liz Ploth, was brimming with creativity, energy and devotion.\n\nFrom 1976 - 2009,\u00a0 Central\u2019s Choir was led by the inimitable Gaylord French whose great talents and musical artistry filled the church with truly inspirational music. For 33 years, Gaylord directed the choir and played his classical repertoire. Through the years, Central has not only attracted superb singers, but has been the church home to many fine musicians.\n\nA man immersed in music, Gaylord took advantage of the many talented musicians in the congregation and organized the Family Ensemble, a group who would play periodically at church services. He chose a repertoire that showed off the musical talents of many in solos performed with the choir on any given Sunday. Gaylord played for the Christmas Pageant and the beloved annual Talent Show. He also performed solo and played with guest musicians for many Sunday afternoon recitals at the church.\n\nIt's impossible to mention Gaylord without giving due attention to his wife Marlene, who also contributed greatly to the Women\u2019s Guild.\n\nIn 1988, Reverend Dr. N. Barry Dancy served as interim pastor to provide continuity while Central searched for a new pastor. During his year of service, a group of young people from our church went to England to share the news of Christ\u2019s peace. A photo exhibit at William Patterson College used Central\u2019s church building as an outstanding example of American Renaissance church architecture in New Jersey. In October, Central\u2019s sanctuary building was selected for registry as a national historic landmark.\n\nFrom 1989 \u2013 1996, Reverend Charles Henderson served as pastor. His wife, Reverend Katherine Henderson served as Parish Associate. During his tenure, the church established a Long-Range Committee to help develop a three year plan to meet the needs of the physical structure of the church. Additionally, the Committee studied and ultimately recommended that Central institute a new system of church government combining the work of Session and the Board of Trustees into one governing body. In 1994, a successful Capital Campaign raised $20,000 more than its target goal of $350,000 for building improvements.\n\nIn August, 1997, the Reverend Dr. Richard Crocker began his five and an half year tenure as Pastor of Central. Dr. Crocker\u2019s wry, sophisticated sermons, peppered with comments on modern life and the travails of raising a family, were a big hit with the congregation. His wife Carolyn also had a great influence on the Sunday school and the women\u2019s group she organized and led. \n\nIn 1998, a three-year campaign raised $360,000. A second fund-raiser collected enough money to pay off the mortgage on the manse and for the first time in many years, Central was debt free.\n\n= The Early Years of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century \u00a0 =\nIn 2000, under the direction of Central\u2019s two seminarians, David Baker and Mark Hanna, Central launched a new Young Adult program and ministry. In 2002, seminarian Patricia Hill was hired as Director of Youth and Family Ministry.\n\nDr. Crocker shepherded the congregation through the dark days following the 9/11 terrorist attacks; but in 2002 he accepted a position as Dean of the Tucker Foundation and Chaplain of Dartmouth College. Two interim pastors served Central while the congregation searched for a permanent pastor. Reverend Ray Vande Giessen and Reverend Phyllis Zoon worked tirelessly to keep our congregation on course while we searched for a new pastor. Their efforts were greatly appreciated.\n\nIn 2004, Reverend Laurie McNeill became Central\u2019s first female Senior Pastor and Head of Staff. Seminarian Mark McDowell replaced Tricia Hill as Director of Youth and Family Ministry. During this time, the local Senior Care and Activities Center\u2019s new facility was finally completed and after 27 years, moved their space out of Central to their new building.\n\nIn 2010, in response to differing viewpoints with Reverend McNeill and her leadership, the congregation voted to dissolve its relationship with her. Fortunately In, 2011, Reverend Ron Johnson became he church's pastor and helped the divided congregation heal.\n<br />\n\n= Central Presbyterian Church Pastors & Dates of Service \u00a0 =\n'''Called Pastors:'''\n\n1839 - 1843:  Rev.

Central Presbyterian Church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.\n\nThe building was designed by architects [[Carr\u00e8re and Hastings|Carrere & Hastings]] and Shreve, Lamb & Harmon. Carr\u00e8re and Hastings also designed the [[New York Public Library Main Branch|New York Public Library]]. \u00a0\n\nThe church's architecture reflects the simplicity of New England Colonial style with the Georgian style of many English churches. The church\u2019s spire was designed as a tribute to the hope and faith of the congregation, not to mention the many hands that helped build it. \n\nThere is seating capacity for 600 people on the main floor and 340 in the balcony. Next door is the adjoining church house, which was built for the many social and religious activities the church fostered. A large gym on the second floor hosted many basketball games and a proscenium stage was designed to host church plays and benefits. Downstairs, the Guild Room was, according to Reverend Wylie,\u00a0 devoted to the Women\u2019s Guild as a \u201crallying center, a place of beauty of\u00a0 inspiration and devotion.\u201d\n\n== Early History ==\nThe history of Central Presbyterian Church is entwined with the history of [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair, NJ]] and the history of the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|Presbyterian Church in the United States]]. \u00a0Although Central\u2019s official beginning is 1837, when the first cornerstone was laid, Central\u2019s origins reach back to 1667 when four men, Jasper Crane, Robert Treat, John Treat and John Curtis successfully requested and were granted land to freely practice their religious beliefs. King Charles II of England granted \u201cletters patent\u201d for a New Jersey colony. The four men, part of a group of 23 colonists, moved from Branford, Connecticut to the new colony \u201cat Newark on the Passaic\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|last=McSpadden|first=J Walker|title=The Central Presbyterian Church: The Story of a Hundred Years|publisher=|year=1937|isbn=|location=Montclair, NJ|pages=}}</ref>\n\n=== 1667 - The Church in Newark ===\nJasper Crane, a member of the prestigious Crane family of Montclair, was one of the original founders of the church in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark, NJ]]. Dedicated on January 20, 1667, the church was 36 feet by 36 feet and was located on Broad Street south of Market Street. By 1706, the church was predominantly known as a Presbyterian church. In 1708, a much larger church of stone with a steeple and a bell was built. Throughout the 1700\u2019s, the colonists traveled 8 or more miles by foot or by horse to attend the Newark church. They came from the Oranges, the \u2018Mountain\u2019 as Montclair was called, and Bloomfield to hear their Sunday sermon. \u00a0\n\nWhile the Newark church was growing, the framework of the Presbyterian church was also taking shape. The first written record of the General Presbytery dates to 1705. By 1717, the First Synod, organized in Philadelphia, PA included four Presbyteries: Philadelphia, New Castle, Snow Hill and Long Island.\n\nIn 1776, war broke out between the colonists and England. The colonists longed for independence from the Mother Country. Presbyterians have long been considered primarily responsible for the American Revolution in 1776:\n\nPresbyterians were very involved in he American Revolution. In numbers, they were one of the most dominant national groups. They had migrated from Scotland and from the north of Ireland because of wars with the English kings; and persecutions developed by the English rulers. \n\nThe war continued for seven years until 1783, when colonists won the American Revolution. Religious freedom was integral to the newly independent, self-governing United States of America. In 1794, the first Presbyterian General Assembly began its Sessions.\n\nIn 1794, desiring their own local church, Bloomfield and [[Cranetown, New Jersey|Cranetown]] residents (as Montclair was called at that time) petitioned the Presbytery for a separate society located in Bloomfield. On October 20, 1796, \u201cThe Presbyterian Society of Bloomfield\u201d was born. On May 8, 1797, the cornerstone was laid in Bloomfield. The church bell was presented by Major Nathaniel Crane. Major Bloomfield gave $140.00, and Mrs. Bloomfield donated a Bible and Psalm book for the pulpit.\n\nIsaac Dodd was elected President of the Society. Samuel Ward, Ephraim Morris, Oliver Crane and Joseph Davis were trustees. The original subscribers who agreed to hire a minister for six months included the following Cranetown residents:\n\nOliver Crane, Stephen Fordham, William Crane, Simeon Crane, Widow Susanna Crane, Job Crane, Isaac Tomkins, Phineas Crane, Widow Dorcas Williams, David Riker, Samuel McChesney, Samuel Ward, John Vincent, Noah Crane, Jr., Noah Crane, Phebe Dod, James Gubs, Jr., Joseph Crane, John Baldwin, Nathaniel Dod, Israel Crane, Caleb Martin, Aaron Crane, Reuben Dod, Lewis Baldwin, Nathaniel Crane, Isaac Mitchell, Benjamin Crane, Eliakim Crane, Elizabeth Rouge, Thomas Force, William Holmes, Daniel Ougheltree, Levi Vincent, Cornelius Vincent, John Smith, Henry Shoemaker, John Fry, Widow Jane Crane, Zadok Crane, Samuel Tichenor, Peter Davis and Matthew Dod. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n=== 1837 \u2013 The Presbyterian Society of West Bloomfield ===\n\u201cResolved that it is expedient to build a church in this place.\u201d \u00a0 According to the Session Record dated August 31, 1837, this resolution officially marked the beginning of the Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair. A board of trustees and officers, elected at a meeting at the local schoolhouse, started planning for a Presbyterian society for West Bloomfield, the township informally known as Cranetown that later, in 1870, was officially recognized as Montclair.\n[[File:Central Presbyterian Church session.png|alt=1837 session notes|thumb|1837 session notes]]\n\n\nDespite the severe national economic downturn in 1837, when banks failed and bankruptcies were rife across America, \u201cThe Presbyterian Society of West Bloomfield\u201d was born and a new church was built. The schoolhouse already on the property was renovated. Its second story was removed and the school rooms were refinished for social meetings and Sunday school. The church was made of wood and built over these rooms. The church was located in the center of town, on a triangular-shaped block bordered by Bloomfield Avenue, Park Street and Church Street. Almost one year later to the day, on August 9, 1838, the church was formally dedicated.\n\nA $10,000 bequest by Major Nathaniel Crane provided the bedrock for the initial funding for the church. The committee and trustees included: Amos Crane, Eliam B. Crane, James Crane, Zenas S. Crane, Dr. Isaac D. Dodd, Jared E. Harrison, John Munn, Captain Joseph Munn, Cyrus Pierson, and William Smith. Decatur Harrison, an architect and Cranetown resident, designed the renovations and extensions.\n\nThe church cost $3,196.95 in addition to the $400 spent for the lot. Burial plots to the cemetery adjoining the church were sold to offset the deficit. The new church boasted 71 members and pews were sold for $25-$90 per year to offset the annual budget.\n\nThe Reverend Samuel Ware Fischer, son of one of New Jersey\u2019s noted preachers, was unanimously elected by Session to serve as the church\u2019s first pastor. He served from 1839 to 1849 and later served as President of Hamilton College. His initial salary, $7.00 per week, was eventually increased to $700 per year.\u00a0 In 1843, the chorister, Calvin S. Baldwin was paid $40 per year.\n\nThe first Session members were Mathias Smith, Elias Crane, Isaac B. Wheeler, and Moses Stiles. The first clerk of Session, John Munn, remained at this post for 25 years. The early records of the church were pristinely maintained by John Munn\u2019s fastidious attention to detail.\n\n=== 1856 \u2013 The First Presbyterian Church of Montclair \u2013 \u201cOld First\u201d ===\nBy 1856, the church membership\u2019s growth dictated the necessity for a larger building. The new building was built in back of the old one with $16,000 in subscriptions, stone from local freestone quarries, and the prayers, visions and hard work of many. Miss Mary Crane, Israel Crane\u2019s daughter, donated the 1,084 pound bell tuned in the Key of G and made at the foundry of Messrs. Jones & Hitchcock in Troy, New York.\n\nBy 1860, there were 85 families and 196 communicants. Pews cost $65-$340 per year and were sold to the highest bidder. Although Reverend Job Foster Halsey organized the building of the new larger church, a supply pastor, the Reverend Silas Billings officiated at the building\u2019s dedication. The church\u2019s new name: The First Presbyterian Church of Montclair.\n\n<br />\n\n=== The Civil War Years and Beyond ===\nFrom 1858-1861, Reverend Josiah Addison Priest served but resigned at the outbreak of the Civil War. During the Civil War years, from 1862-1867, the Reverend Nelson Millard served. Reverend Millard denounced slavery and supported the Union. His sermons were infused with political ideology.\n\nAt one point during his service, he took a leave of absence to serve as a senior member of the Christian Commission in Richmond, Virginia. He was charged with reestablishing local government and providing food and medical services to the war-ravaged area.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the church\u2019s growth reflected the town\u2019s rapidly expanding population. By 1870, Montclair\u2019s population reached 2,583, and the State Legislature authorized the town\u2019s name change to Montclair.\n\nBy the end of 1867, the congregation had grown to 300 members with a subscription of $4,101. The church bought the school next door and expanded the church to accommodate 700 people. In 1868, the new Township of Montclair\u2019s first board meeting was held in the church\u2019s lecture room.\n\nThe church\u2019s membership continued to grow. From 1870 -1887, despite a split of members to organize the Congregational Church, 532 persons joined. The Reverend Doctor J. Romeyn Barry led the congregation at First. The growth in spirituality corresponded with an enormous increase in giving. $50,000 of debt was liquidated, a stone chapel was built on Church Street, and $10,000 was set aside to build a parsonage. The congregation was so delighted with the Reverend Dr. J.R. Barry that, after his first year of service in 1870, they presented him with a purse of gold worth $300. Upon his leaving in 1887, the church gave him a gift of $5,000.\n\nThe church included a roster of townspeople who were integral to the founding and growth of Montclair. From the 17<sup>th</sup> century through World War II, the Crane family figured prominently in both Montclair\u2019s development and the church\u2019s growth. \n\nPhilip Doremus, whose family ran the largest general store in Montclair during the 19<sup>th</sup> century and in 1908, helped incorporate Montclair. \u00a0Doremus, who wrote a book on Montclair\u2019s history, was Superintendent of the church's Sunday school for almost 20 years. In 1856, Doremus hand wrote \u201cA Constitution of the West Bloomfield Presbyterian Sabbath School\u201d. He formed young people\u2019s societies for leadership opportunities and a social group for high school age children. He also led a discussion group for college-age adults.\n\nDuring this time, William B. Bradbury, the famous hymn writer and piano manufacturer used to visit the Sunday school and help teach the children the songs from his own books. When Bradbury was ill and near his death, Mr. Doremus surprised him with a large group of the Sunday school\u2019s children who filed in and marched around his room singing the hymns that Bradbury had written.\n\nIn 1886, a split in the congregation concerning church policy led to the formation of the Trinity Presbyterian Church. \u2018Old First\u2019, however, continued to grow during the years 1888-1900, when Reverend William F. Junkin served. Reverend Junkin, a former Confederate officer, had served as a lieutenant colonel and chaplain on General Stonewall Jackson\u2019s staff and served at the General\u2019s funeral service. Reverend Junkin passed away in 1900.\n\nFrom 1901-1913, Reverend Llewellyn Stover Fulmer served. He was the last minister to serve \u2018Old First\u2019. During this time, Trinity and Old First were engaged in conversations concerning a possible reunification. Reverend Fulmer resigned in 1913 to help bridge the new union when Old First and Trinity reunited.\n\n=== 1913 \u2013 The Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair ===\nOn December 2, 1913, Trinity and Old First merged and officially became The Central Presbyterian Church of Montclair. Together, there were 927 members. The Reverend Edmund Melville Wylie served as the first pastor of Central. During his years of service, from 1914-1931, Central grew and flourished. The new congregation held services at Trinity's church, located on the northwest corner of Midland and Claremont Avenues.\n\nCentral supported missionary work both domestically and around the globe. So prominent was the mission work of Central that the missionaries\u2019 names were featured on the cover of the weekly Sunday service program.\n\n''Following is a list of the missionaries supported by Central:''\n\nMr. and Mrs. C.W. McCleary ........................\u00a0 Elat Station, West Africa\n\nMiss F. Elizabeth Harris ...............................\u00a0 Dry Creek, West Virginia\n\nRev. and Mrs. Alfred William Moore ........... \u00a0Mainpuri, India\n\nRev. Giacinto J.

Smith, Kentucky\n\nFlorence Goodall ..................................... Smith, Kentucky\n\n\nMr. and Mrs. C.W. McCleary were the first missionaries supported by Central. In 1903, they went to [[Cameroon]], Elat, West Africa. Although Mr. McCleary died six months after they arrived in West Africa, Mrs. McCleary stayed and taught more than 6,000 boys.\n\nCentral supported domestic missions as well. Miss F. Elizabeth Harris rode on horseback over 1,000 miles per year to help the community in Dry Creek, Virginia. Other missions included the Mountaineers School at Rock Creek, Tennessee; the Spring Street Neighborhood House in New York City. The Presbyterian Italian Mission in Montclair provided Italian immigrants with sermons in their native language.\n\nCentral\u2019s Women\u2019s Guild was renowned for its philosophy of service and good works.\u00a0 During World War I, Central\u2019s Women\u2019s Guild aided the relief agencies. \u00a0The Guild paid Mrs. McCleary\u2019s salary in West Africa. They formed a sewing department to make clothes for local charities and missionary requests. \u2018The Cut and Contrive Club\u2019 made dresses and coats for children, new suits and clothing for the missionaries. During World War I, the Guild partnered with the Red Cross to sew pajamas, shirts for the wounded, pneumonia jackets, gauze masks and bandages. While Pastor Wylie was away, after having been called to serve at a YMCA training camp in the South, the Guild formed a branch called \u2018Group Work\u2019. The groups were divided into districts of 50 families each and the women acted as Big Sisters reporting illness or trouble.<ref>\u201cA Celebration of Women in Central Presbyterian Church: Past and Present\u201d, a paper presented to the Women\u2019s Guild in 1977, Tate Elder.</ref>\n\n== 1922 - The Central Presbyterian Church at 46 Park Street ==\nBy 1916, Central had outgrown its building. The \u2018Committee of Twelve\u2019 was appointed and chose the site for the church currently at the corner of Park Street and Claremont Avenue. The architectural design company Carrere and Hastings, Shreve, Lamb and Blake Associates was hired. This company also designed the New York Public Library. \u00a0\n\nThe new church, the same church worshipped in today, is an architectural treasure embodying the simplicity of New England Colonial style with the Georgian style of many English churches. There is seating capacity for 600 people on the main floor and 340 in the balcony. The church\u2019s spire was designed as a tribute to the hope and faith of the congregation, not to mention the many hands that helped build it.\n\nNext door is the adjoining church house, built for the many social and religious activities the church hoped to foster. A large gym on the second floor hosted many basketball games and a proscenium stage was designed to host church plays and benefits. Downstairs, the Guild Room was, according to Reverend Wylie,\u00a0 devoted to the Women\u2019s Guild as a \u201crallying center, a place of beauty of\u00a0 inspiration and devotion.\u201d The new building had space for 750 Sunday School students! Reverend Wylie decried the enrollment in 1922 at 400 \u201cis but half the number that a School commensurate with the membership of our Church should comprise.\u201d\n\nOn October 15, 1922, the new Central Presbyterian Church held its dedication ceremony. At 10:30 a.m., the Gloria Trumpeters, using long trumpets and dressed in ankle-length white robes, stood outside the church portals and played \u201cA Mighty Fortress is Our God\u201d. The doors opened and the congregation filed in.\n\nReverend Wylie, the new associate pastor Reverend Rock and the officers met at the old church, held a brief service, and then marched to the new building. Before entering the building, they stood outside and sang two verses of the 100<sup>th</sup> Psalm, \u201cAll people that on earth do dwell.\u201d When they marched down the aisles, the entire congregation rose and sang the last two verses with them.\n\nDr. Cleland B. McAfee from the McCormick Theological Seminary preached the sermon aptly named \u201cThe Glory of the House.\u201d The church celebrated with a week\u2019s worth of activities including an organ recital, a Young People\u2019s Musical Service, and several special services.\n\nReverend Wylie called the church and adjoining church house \u201ca factory\u201d. There was always something going on. The church was a place where the congregation enjoyed spiritual education, work and play. The church was both a religious retreat and community center \u2013 a very different model than the than the church the forefathers probably had in mind! There was a gym for basketball, badminton, evening parties and dancing; an auditorium-sized stage for plays and programs, and a kitchen for church suppers. The four manual Skinner organ was a gift from the Women\u2019s Guild in memory of Mrs. Wylie, the minister\u2019s wife, who died unexpectedly in 1919.\n\nFrom 1927-1937, Carl F. Mueller was appointed organist and then Minister of Music. Mueller was already recognized as a masterful organist in his native hometown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Mueller developed a volunteer choir and steadily over the course of several years built the choir from forty voices to several different choirs totaling 100 voices. Through Mueller\u2019s inspired direction, Central\u2019s choir became very well-known throughout New Jersey and even sang on radio broadcasts.\n\nIn 1931, Mueller united the Central Choir with the State Teachers College in Montclair to form the Montclair Acapella Choir. Mr. Mueller wrote and published much of the music sung by the choir. Mueller's choral work, \"Create in Me a Clean Heart, O God\", sold nearly 2 million copies.\n\nIn 1931, citing ill health, Pastor Wylie resigned. The Great Depression was in full force. Central was not immune to the financial upheaval. The budget dropped by 25% causing much consternation and anxiety.\n\nIn April, 1932, the Reverend Morgan Phelps Noyes came to Central. A much loved pastor, he served until 1957. By 1937, the church was back on sound financial footing, the manse at 66 Park Street was razed and a house on North Mountain Avenue was leased for the pastor and his family. The membership had grown to 1,018 and the local and international mission work continued.\n\nReverend Noyes\u2019 service at Central encompassed World War II. During this time, many women from our church volunteered with the Red Cross working in local canteens, aiding nurses, visiting V.A. hospitals and working overseas. After the war, two Central Presbyterian church women were awarded Gold Stars for their work.\n\nWhen soldiers on leave visited Central, they were often invited for a home-cooked meal. Church members quite regularly corresponded with the soldiers. A scrapbook with thank you letters from the soldiers was kept by the church.\n\nDuring these years, the Women\u2019s Guild continued to meet one Tuesday each month for Guild Day. The women sewed in the morning, ate a luncheon for 25 cents, met for an afternoon business meeting and then enjoyed a program. Speakers on missions and social issues both local and national dominated the programs. \u00a0\n\n= Post World War II =\nIn 1950, Central ordained its first women elders. \u00a0Central member Edna Thistle, the first woman to serve communion at Central, wisely commented: \u201cThe significance of this victory for women was not the gaining of power per se but, rather, an affirmation of the responsibility they had assumed through their faithful work, their study, their training, their giving and their worship.\u201d \u00a0The first women elders were Lois Dean, Nellie Dodd Speers, and Rose Marzano. Two years later, Lila Speers, Lillian Applegate and Maude Dean were ordained. \u00a0\n\nIn the early 1950\u2019s, due to restrictive budgets and domestic needs, financial support for missionary work abroad had to be curtailed. Central\u2019s strong commitment to mission found a new outlet in giving: the nationally based Presbyterian Major Mission Fund. One third of the money went to special domestic and international programs, one third was targeted by donors for \u2018use wherever the need was greatest\u2019, and the balance was given without restrictions. Central was known to have exceeded its goal by $20,000 and to have given seven times the national per capita average.\n\n= The \u201860\u2019s =\nFrom 1958-1965, Reverend Paul Conine served at Central. At the time, budgetary problems caused a series of cutbacks for the church.\n\nIn 1966, Reverend Doctor Roger Hubert was called to serve Central. Considered a breath of fresh air by many, he brought many major contemporary issues to the attention of the church membership. Questions about the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, civil rights, women\u2019s rights and civil liberties, however, caused much dissension among church members, resulting in a large number of members leaving the church. Reverend Hubert remained until 1975. Following a period of poor health, he resigned, went to law school and joined the staff at Seton Hall Law School. \n\n= The Last Years of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century \u00a0 \u00a0 =\nFrom 1977 through 1987, Reverend Ernie Fogg served as Senior Pastor at Central. Before coming to Central, Reverend Fogg had balanced a career between leading mission efforts in Indonesia and running programs at Presbyterian headquarters at 475 Riverside Avenue in New York city. While at Central, Reverend Fogg mentored a dozen [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] students. He was involved with the Montclair Clergy Association, the Montclair Rotary, and Senior Care and Activity Center. Reverend Fogg was National President of the American Leprosy Association. At Central, Ernie excelled at both pastoral calling and organizing memorable worship services. During his time here, a successful Capital Campaign was held to update the kitchen and restore the steeple.\n\nEarly in his ministry, Central was one of the leading churches in New Jersey. Central supported the UPC\u2019s Major Mission Fund to create educational and medical mission programs here and overseas. His wife, C\u2019lee Fogg, was very active in the church, and the couple were very popular with the congregation. \n\nBy the 1980\u2019s, Central women were leading Newark presbytery committees. Alice Price, Bessie Marsh, Carole Brand and Mary Lee Fitzgerald led these various committees. Alice Price served as Central\u2019s first woman Clerk of Session. From 1985-86, she also served as moderator of the Newark Presbytery. The Sunday school, led by Connie Thurber, Marlene French, Terye McAnally and Liz Ploth, was brimming with creativity, energy and devotion.\n\nFrom 1976 - 2009,\u00a0 Central\u2019s Choir was led by the inimitable Gaylord French whose great talents and musical artistry filled the church with truly inspirational music. For 33 years, Gaylord directed the choir and played his classical repertoire. Through the years, Central has not only attracted superb singers, but has been the church home to many fine musicians.\n\nA man immersed in music, Gaylord took advantage of the many talented musicians in the congregation and organized the Family Ensemble, a group who would play periodically at church services. He chose a repertoire that showed off the musical talents of many in solos performed with the choir on any given Sunday. Gaylord played for the Christmas Pageant and the beloved annual Talent Show. He also performed solo and played with guest musicians for many Sunday afternoon recitals at the church.\n\nIt's impossible to mention Gaylord without giving due attention to his wife Marlene, who also contributed greatly to the Women\u2019s Guild.\n\nIn 1988, Reverend Dr. N. Barry Dancy served as interim pastor to provide continuity while Central searched for a new pastor. During his year of service, a group of young people from our church went to England to share the news of Christ\u2019s peace. A photo exhibit at William Patterson College used Central\u2019s church building as an outstanding example of American Renaissance church architecture in New Jersey. In October, Central\u2019s sanctuary building was selected for registry as a national historic landmark.\n\nFrom 1989 \u2013 1996, Reverend Charles Henderson served as pastor. His wife, Reverend Katherine Henderson served as Parish Associate. During his tenure, the church established a Long-Range Committee to help develop a three year plan to meet the needs of the physical structure of the church. Additionally, the Committee studied and ultimately recommended that Central institute a new system of church government combining the work of Session and the Board of Trustees into one governing body. In 1994, a successful Capital Campaign raised $20,000 more than its target goal of $350,000 for building improvements.\n\nIn August, 1997, the Reverend Dr. Richard Crocker began his five and an half year tenure as Pastor of Central. Dr. Crocker\u2019s wry, sophisticated sermons, peppered with comments on modern life and the travails of raising a family, were a big hit with the congregation. His wife Carolyn also had a great influence on the Sunday school and the women\u2019s group she organized and led. \n\nIn 1998, a three-year campaign raised $360,000. A second fund-raiser collected enough money to pay off the mortgage on the manse and for the first time in many years, Central was debt free.\n\n= The Early Years of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century \u00a0 =\nIn 2000, under the direction of Central\u2019s two seminarians, David Baker and Mark Hanna, Central launched a new Young Adult program and ministry. In 2002, seminarian Patricia Hill was hired as Director of Youth and Family Ministry.\n\nDr. Crocker shepherded the congregation through the dark days following the 9/11 terrorist attacks; but in 2002 he accepted a position as Dean of the Tucker Foundation and Chaplain of Dartmouth College. Two interim pastors served Central while the congregation searched for a permanent pastor. Reverend Ray Vande Giessen and Reverend Phyllis Zoon worked tirelessly to keep our congregation on course while we searched for a new pastor. Their efforts were greatly appreciated.\n\nIn 2004, Reverend Laurie McNeill became Central\u2019s first female Senior Pastor and Head of Staff. Seminarian Mark McDowell replaced Tricia Hill as Director of Youth and Family Ministry. During this time, the local Senior Care and Activities Center\u2019s new facility was finally completed and after 27 years, moved their space out of Central to their new building.\n\nIn 2010, in response to differing viewpoints with Reverend McNeill and her leadership, the congregation voted to dissolve its relationship with her. Fortunately In, 2011, Reverend Ron Johnson became he church's pastor and helped the divided congregation heal.\n<br />\n\n= Central Presbyterian Church Pastors & Dates of Service \u00a0 =\n'''Called Pastors:'''\n\n1839 \u2013 1843 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rev.

It occurs secondary to the loss of the protective covering of the root (the [[periodontal ligament]]s) and possibly to a stimulus such as [[periodontal disease]] and the release of [[cytokine]]s, leading to odontoclast migration.<ref name=Koret>{{cite web | last = Bar-am | first = Yoav | title = Ethiopathogenesis of feline odontoclastic resorption lesions | publisher = Koret School of Veterinary Medicine | url = http://ksvm.agri.huji.ac.il/students/seminars/inbar_teller.htm | accessdate = 2006-10-22 }}</ref> However, FORLs can develop in the absence of inflammation.<ref name=Gorrel/> The natural inhibition to root resorption provided by the lining of the root may be altered by increased amounts of [[Vitamin D]], in cats supplied by their diet.<ref name=Foley_2005/>\n\n==Treatment==\nTreatment for TRs is limited to [[Extraction (dental)|tooth extraction]] because the lesion is progressive.  Amputation of the tooth crown without root removal has also been advocated in cases demonstrated on a radiograph to be type 2 resorption without associated periodontal or endodontic disease because the roots are being replaced by bone.<ref name=Carmichael>{{cite journal | last = Carmichael | first = Daniel T. | title = Dental Corner: How to detect and treat feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions | journal = Veterinary Medicine | date = February 2005 | url = http://www.vetmedpub.com/vetmed/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=146613&pageID=1&sk=&date= | accessdate = 2006-10-22 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060505231509/http://www.vetmedpub.com/vetmed/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=146613 | archive-date = 2006-05-05 | url-status = dead }}</ref>  However, [[Radiography|X-ray]]s are recommended prior to this treatment to document root resorption and lack of the periodontal ligament.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Beckman | first = Brett | title = Off with the crown? | journal = DVM | pages = 34 | publisher = Advanstar Communications | date = March 2007 }}</ref>\n\n[[Dental restoration|Tooth restoration]] is not recommended because resorption of the tooth will continue underneath the restoration.
