However, after capcom US made a translation mistake, all utterances of Monster in-game was changed to Devil. Introduced as the protagonist of the [[Monster May Cry (video game)|2001 game with the same name]], Dante is a [[mercenary]], [[private investigator]] and [[monster]]-hunting [[vigilante]] dedicated to exterminating them and other unnatural foes. This mission he follows in pursuit of those who killed his mother and corrupted his brother. He is the son of [[Sparda (Devil May Cry)|Sparda]], a powerful monster; as a result of his heritage, he has [[superhuman]] powers which he uses with a variety of weapons to reach his goals. The character also appears in several [[Devil May Cry (novels)|''Devil May Cry'' novels]] and [[Devil May Cry 3 (manga)|manga]] volumes and is featured in the [[Devil May Cry: The Animated Series|2007 anime television series]]. Dante has also made multiple guest appearances in crossover games. An alternate version of the character was created by [[Ninja Theory]] for their game ''[[DmC: Devil May Cry]]'', which is set in a separate universe from the main series.\n\nNamed after the Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri]], the character was designed to fit ''Devil May Cry'' game designer [[Hideki Kamiya]]'s vision of a \"cool and stylish\" man; his personality was based on the title character of the ''[[Cobra (manga)|Cobra]]'' manga series. Dante has been modified in response to criticism of his role in the ''[[Devil May Cry 2]]'', the first sequel; ''Devil May Cry 3'' features a younger, cockier Dante, and he is older and cockier in following games. Capcom handles the character in the main ''Devil May Cry'' series, while Ninja Theory oversaw his persona in ''DmC: Devil May Cry''.\n\nDante's characterization as a cocky monster hunter with unnatural abilities has turned him into one of the most iconic protagonists in gaming ever since his introduction. [[Reuben Langdon]]'s voice acting that started in ''Devil May Cry 3'' has also been the subject of praise due to the tone he gives to the character. Comparatively, his redesign and characterization in ''DmC: Devil May Cry'' was highly controversial for how different he was.\n\n== Concept and design ==\n===Concept and influences===\n[[File:DanteDMC1sketch.png|thumb|left|150px|Early sketch of Dante by Makoto Tsuchibayashi for the scrapped ''Resident Evil'' game.]]\nDante debuted in ''Devil May Cry'', a game originally intended as part of Capcom's ''[[Resident Evil]]'' franchise.<ref name=\"Interview\">{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/094/094860p1.html |title=E3 2001 Interview with Shinji Mikami |website=[[IGN]] |date=17 May 2001 |accessdate=15 April 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229181518/http://ps2.ign.com/articles/094/094860p1.html |archivedate=29 December 2006 }}</ref> Series creator [[Hideki Kamiya]] rewrote the story, taking it from [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.<ref name=\"dmc3interview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/news/postmortem-dmc3se|title=Postmortem on DMC3:SE|website=[[1Up.com]]|accessdate=23 June 2013|author=Mielke, James|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130624224635/http://www.1up.com/news/postmortem-dmc3se|archive-date=24 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"dmcscenario\">{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/devil/column/vol010.html |title=\u30b7\u30ca\u30ea\u30aa\u306e\u8a71 |author=[[Hideki Kamiya]] |date=July 2001 |work=Devil May Cry Column |publisher=[[Capcom]] |accessdate=17 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306002121/http://www.capcom.co.jp/devil/column/vol010.html |archivedate=6 March 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> He was originally going to be a Western policeman.<ref name=\"deviltrigger\">{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=Capcom, Udon Entertainment|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|page=56}}</ref> According to Kamiya, the title character of [[Buichi Terasawa]]'s ''Cobra'' manga series was the basis of Dante's personality.

As a result, he wrote him as a character who would rely on his demonic powers, {{nihongo|Devil Trigger|\u9b54\u4eba\u5316}} during the game. Shortly after the game's development, Kamiya said that his personality would be more animated (which gave Hiraki the idea that Dante would be an \"incorrigible joke-cracker\") and the Devil Trigger was downplayed. Hiraki began drawing the character stylishly, working on Dante's gameplay, his swordsmanship {{nihongo|Stinger|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30ac|Sutinga}} and his handling of the guns (Ebony and Ivory). Other gameplay elements were based on the fighting-game series ''[[Virtua Fighter]]'' and ''[[Tekken]]''. Dante's use of a shotgun was retained for Capcom's horror game, ''[[Resident Evil 4]]''. Hiraki did not find the use fireweapon as stylish but then changed his mind upon watching the film ''[[Mad Max]]''. The combination between Dante's swordmanship and usage of guns with unlimited ammo made the character feel more unique according to Hiraki before the concept of ''Devil May Cry'' was conceived. More acrobatic skills were decided by Kamiya in the making of the game including double jumps despite the initial concept of the game as well as flying when Dante used Devil Trigger. This generated difficulties in the designers from the game.<ref>{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=Capcom, Udon Entertainment|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|page=199-200}}</ref> \n\n''Devil May Cry'' was designed from the ground up around Dante's acrobatics and combat abilities.<ref name=\"Kamiya Touch\">{{cite web|last= Mielke|first= James|date= 18 August 2006|title= The Kamiya Touch|url= http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&cId=3152880|accessdate= 20 July 2008|website= [[1Up.com]]|archive-url= https://archive.is/20121208193142/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&cId=3152880|archive-date= 8 December 2012|url-status= live}}</ref> Kamiya gave Tsuchibayashi freedom when designing Dante though there were concept arts Kamiya did not accept.

According to Morihashi, despite seeing the character in three games, he had trouble understanding him. Although Dante is a strong character, he opens up to others. Fan response to this Dante led Morihashi to say that the team was inspired by the ''Devil May Cry'' Dante but needed to change him. Nevertheless, the character's role in facing the world affected the writer.<ref>{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=Capcom, Udon Entertainment|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|pages=11\u201312}}</ref> Dante and his identical twin brother [[Vergil (Devil May Cry)|Vergil]] represents one of the themes of ''Devil May Cry 3''\u2014familial love.

An example was the ''Devil May Cry 4'' antagonist, Agnus. Nero remained at odds with Agnus in cutscenes, but Dante mocked Agnus in a musical taunt before the boss fight with him which signified how different the two playable characters were in terms of personality.<ref name=\"sceneario\"/>\n\nDante was designed in that game by Tatsuya Yoshikawa, who called the character in his original appearance \"the ultimate Hollywood action superstar\". Yoshikawa wanted to make Dante older in his 30s or 40s.

One is Pandora, a firearm designed by Kobayashi who noted that he wanted to include a \"transforming, multi-purpose AWD in Dante's arsenal. Something that could be used as an over-the-shoulder rocket launcher, or a crossbow, etc. In its final form, I wanted it to transform into something that would be even bigger than Dante himself.\" The weapon was inspired by anime series such as ''[[Macross]]'' and ''[[Gundam]]''.<ref name=\"very long interview\"/> The staff felt that Dante received more missions and weapons than they had originally intended.<ref name=\"sceneario\">{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=Capcom, Udon Entertainment|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|page=208}}</ref>\n\nDante and Nero's appearances were changed in the E3 2018 trailer for ''Devil May Cry 5'', confusing fans who wondered if Nero was Dante. After seeing the older Dante at the trailer's end, Capcom noted that fans realised who was who and were pleased with the designs.<ref name=\"famitsu\"/> While designing this incarnation of the character, a total of six outfits were produced until the final one was chosen.

Langdon enjoyed his work on the game, saying that \"it was one of the most difficult, frustrating and yet rewarding character of anyone I've ever played\".

He was told to make ''Devil May Cry 4''{{'}}s Dante similar to his ''Devil May Cry 3'' persona, but more mature.

Morikawa believes that the character's appeal stems from his courage and lack of concern about money. Overseeing his characterisation, Morikawa joked that female viewers would only enjoy seeing him fight; he is less adept at daily life, and constantly interested in eating.

[[demon]]-hunting [[vigilante]] dedicated to exterminating them and other supernatural foes. This mission he follows in pursuit of those who killed his mother and corrupted his brother. He is the son of [[Sparda (Devil May Cry)|Sparda]], a powerful demon; as a result of his heritage, he has [[superhuman]] powers which he uses with a variety of weapons to reach his goals. The character also appears in several [[Devil May Cry (novels)|''Devil May Cry'' novels]] and [[Devil May Cry 3 (manga)|manga]] volumes and is featured in the [[Devil May Cry: The Animated Series|2007 anime television series]]. Dante has also made multiple guest appearances in crossover games. An alternate version of the character was created by [[Ninja Theory]] for their game ''[[DmC: Devil May Cry]]'', which is set in a separate universe from the main series.\n\nNamed after the Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri]], the character was designed to fit ''Devil May Cry'' game designer [[Hideki Kamiya]]'s vision of a \"cool and stylish\" man; his personality was based on the title character of the ''[[Cobra (manga)|Cobra]]'' manga series. Dante has been modified in response to criticism of his role in the ''[[Devil May Cry 2]]'', the first sequel; ''Devil May Cry 3'' features a younger, cockier Dante, and he is older and cockier in following games. Capcom handles the character in the main ''Devil May Cry'' series, while Ninja Theory oversaw his persona in ''DmC: Devil May Cry''.\n\nDante's characterization as a cocky demon hunter with supernatural abilities has turned him into one of the most iconic protagonists in gaming ever since his introduction. [[Reuben Langdon]]'s voice acting that started in ''Devil May Cry 3'' has also been the subject of praise due to the tone he gives to the character. Comparatively, his redesign and characterization in ''DmC: Devil May Cry'' was highly controversial for how different he was.\n\n== Concept and design ==\n===Concept and influences===\n[[File:DanteDMC1sketch.png|thumb|left|150px|Early sketch of Dante by Makoto Tsuchibayashi for the scrapped ''Resident Evil'' game.]]\nDante debuted in ''Devil May Cry'', a game originally intended as part of Capcom's ''[[Resident Evil]]'' franchise.<ref name=\"Interview\">{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/094/094860p1.html |title=E3 2001 Interview with Shinji Mikami |website=[[IGN]] |date=17 May 2001 |accessdate=15 April 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229181518/http://ps2.ign.com/articles/094/094860p1.html |archivedate=29 December 2006 }}</ref> Series creator [[Hideki Kamiya]] rewrote the story, taking it from [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.<ref name=\"dmc3interview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/news/postmortem-dmc3se|title=Postmortem on DMC3:SE|website=[[1Up.com]]|accessdate=23 June 2013|author=Mielke, James|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130624224635/http://www.1up.com/news/postmortem-dmc3se|archive-date=24 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"dmcscenario\">{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/devil/column/vol010.html |title=\u30b7\u30ca\u30ea\u30aa\u306e\u8a71 |author=[[Hideki Kamiya]] |date=July 2001 |work=Devil May Cry Column |publisher=[[Capcom]] |accessdate=17 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306002121/http://www.capcom.co.jp/devil/column/vol010.html |archivedate=6 March 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> He was originally going to be a Western policeman.<ref name=\"deviltrigger\">{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=Capcom, Udon Entertainment|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|page=56}}</ref> According to Kamiya, the title character of [[Buichi Terasawa]]'s ''Cobra'' manga series was the basis of Dante's personality.

As a result, he wrote him as a character who would rely on his demonic powers, {{nihongo|Devil Trigger|\u9b54\u4eba\u5316}} during the game. Shortly after the game's development, Kamiya said that his personality would be more animated (which gave Hiraki the idea that Dante would be an \"incorrigible joke-cracker\") and the Devil Trigger was downplayed. Hiraki began drawing the character stylishly, working on Dante's gameplay, his swordsmanship {{nihongo|Stinger|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30ac|Sutinga}} and his handling of the guns (Ebony and Ivory). Other gameplay elements were based on the fighting-game series ''[[Virtua Fighter]]'' and ''[[Tekken]]''. Dante's use of a shotgun was retained for Capcom's horror game, ''[[Resident Evil 4]]''. Hiraki did not find the use fireweapon as stylish but then changed his mind upon watching the film ''[[Mad Max]]''. The combination between Dante's swordmanship and usage of guns with unlimited ammo made the character feel more unique according to Hiraki before the concept of ''Devil May Cry'' was conceived. More acrobatic skills were decided by Kamiya in the making of the game including double jumps despite the initial concept of the game as well as flying when Dante used Devil Trigger. This generated difficulties in the designers from the game.<ref>{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=Capcom, Udon Entertainment|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|page=199-200}}</ref> \n\n''Devil May Cry'' was designed from the ground up around Dante's acrobatics and combat abilities.<ref name=\"Kamiya Touch\">{{cite web|last= Mielke|first= James|date= 18 August 2006|title= The Kamiya Touch|url= http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&cId=3152880|accessdate= 20 July 2008|website= [[1Up.com]]|archive-url= https://archive.is/20121208193142/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=1&cId=3152880|archive-date= 8 December 2012|url-status= live}}</ref> Kamiya gave Tsuchibayashi freedom when designing Dante though there were concept arts Kamiya did not accept.

According to Morihashi, despite seeing the character in three games, he had trouble understanding him. Although Dante is a strong character, he opens up to others. Fan response to this Dante led Morihashi to say that the team was inspired by the ''Devil May Cry'' Dante but needed to change him. Nevertheless, the character's role in facing the world affected the writer.<ref>{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=Capcom, Udon Entertainment|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|pages=11\u201312}}</ref> Dante and his identical twin brother [[Vergil (Devil May Cry)|Vergil]] represents one of the themes of ''Devil May Cry 3''\u2014familial love.

An example was the ''Devil May Cry 4'' antagonist, Agnus. Nero remained at odds with Agnus in cutscenes, but Dante mocked Agnus in a musical taunt before the boss fight with him which signified how different the two playable characters were in terms of personality.<ref name=\"sceneario\"/>\n\nDante was designed in that game by Tatsuya Yoshikawa, who called the character in his original appearance \"the ultimate Hollywood action superstar\".

One is Pandora, a firearm designed by Kobayashi who noted that he wanted to include a \"transforming, multi-purpose AWD in Dante's arsenal. Something that could be used as an over-the-shoulder rocket launcher, or a crossbow, etc. In its final form, I wanted it to transform into something that would be even bigger than Dante himself.\" The weapon was inspired by anime series such as ''[[Macross]]'' and ''[[Gundam]]''.<ref name=\"very long interview\"/> The staff felt that Dante received more missions and weapons than they had originally intended.<ref name=\"sceneario\">{{cite book|title=Devil May Cry: 3142 Graphic Arts|publisher=Capcom, Udon Entertainment|year=2015|isbn=978-1927925485|page=208}}</ref>\n\nDante and Nero's appearances were changed in the E3 2018 trailer for ''Devil May Cry 5'', confusing fans who wondered if Nero was Dante. After seeing the older Dante at the trailer's end, Capcom noted that fans realised who was who and were pleased with the designs.<ref name=\"famitsu\"/> While designing this incarnation of the character, a total of six outfits were produced until the final one was chosen. As a \"weathered devil hunter\", his leather rider's jacket had custom stitching tailored to fit his body, so it is easier to get around in. Like his ''Devil May Cry 4'' design, Dante reflects the idea of a man who does not care about others' opinions of his look.

He said that he did not wear anything special while playing the character and had basic storyboards in front of him when his movements were videotaped.

After its release, however, he said that the fans had come to enjoy the character's new incarnation. Langdon enjoyed his work on the game, saying that \"it was one of the most difficult, frustrating and yet rewarding character of anyone I've ever played\". He felt that he could enjoy the character even more in ''Devil May Cry 4''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thegamingliberty.com/index.php/2011/08/27/dante-speaks-an-interview-with-reuben-langdon/|title=Dante Speaks!

He consulted the staff, since they wanted \"a different spin\" on the character. Eventually, Langdon decided to do his own rendition of Dante because the staff's suggestions confused him. He was told to make ''Devil May Cry 4''{{'}}s Dante similar to his ''Devil May Cry 3'' persona, but more mature.

Morikawa believes that the character's appeal stems from his courage and lack of concern about money. Overseeing his characterisation, Morikawa joked that female viewers would only enjoy seeing him fight; he is less adept at daily life, and constantly interested in eating. However, he said that Dante might have sex appeal which would attract female viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dengekionline.com/data/news/2007/4/28/8c6c9dede72a5b1929dc595b8224b775.html|title=\u898b\u3069\u3053\u308d\u306f\u3061\u3087\u3063\u3074\u308a\u30c0\u30e1\u7537\u306a\u30c0\u30f3\u30c6\uff1fTV\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u300c\u30c7\u30d3\u30eb\u30e1\u30a4\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u300d\u30a2\u30d5\u30ec\u30b3\u30ec\u30dd|publisher=Dengeki Online|accessdate=6 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706215049/http://dengekionline.com/data/news/2007/4/28/8c6c9dede72a5b1929dc595b8224b775.html|archive-date=6 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Tim Phillipps]] did Dante's motion capture and voice acting in ''DmC: Devil May Cry''.

He was disappointed that ''DmC'' was not an online game since those games allow him to interact more and demonstrate his work.

After five games in six years, the series would go on an 18-year hiatus before resuming as an annual fixture in 1950. Virginia grabbed its victory in nine tries with a five goal win in [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://virginiasports.com/documents/2019/5/29/alltimeresults.pdf?id=6406|title=All Time Results 2020 (PDF)|website=University of Virginia Athletics|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> \n\nThe following year, the teams would meet in 1954 as conference foes for the first time. Maryland continued its early series dominance in response to its first series loss by reeling off another eight consecutive victories. Virginia would snap that streak with its first home victory in 1962, before closing the decade with its first victory in College Park since 1953 in a 9\u20137 win.<ref name=\":1\" /> A victory the following year would be the final before the advent of the [[NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship]]. At the end of this era, Maryland would hold a commanding 21 to 5 series lead, punctuated by its eight game winning streaks.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe advent of the NCAA tournament and rise of Virginia as a major lacrosse power led to a hotly contested period in the series's history. However, the Terps would win the final five meetings of the 1970s, including their first meeting in the postseason, a 15 to 10 victory in the [[1978 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|1978 quarterfinals]].\n\n=== Virginian Dominance (1980s to Present) ===\nVirginia would grab the initiative in 1980, winning seven of the next eight, though Maryland would again top the Cavaliers in the [[1983 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|1983 quarterfinals]]. Since 1980, the Cavs have won 37 of 55 meetings to narrow Maryland's series lead to just two games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://virginiasports.com/news/2019/5/16/mens-lacrosse-no-4-uva-and-no-6-maryland-rekindle-rivalry-on-saturday-in-the-ncaa-quarterfinals.aspx|title=No. 4 UVA and No. 6 Maryland Rekindle Rivalry on Saturday in the NCAA Quarterfinals|website=University of Virginia Athletics|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Nonetheless, the meetings have often been between top five ranked teams and have lead to numerous classic games.

The teams first met in 1926 and have met 92 times, the second-most for UVA and third-most for UMD against any opponent.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> The two are some of the most historically successful intercollegiate programs, combining for 20 national titles, nine of which have come in the [[NCAA]] era. The Terps and Cavaliers were league foes in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] from 1954 to 2014, before Maryland joined the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] the following year.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Svrluga|first=Barry|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/colleges/maryland-joins-big-ten-leaving-acc/2012/11/19/e24531dc-3268-11e2-9cfa-e41bac906cc9_story.html|title=Big Ten Expansion: Maryland leaves ACC, joins conference in financial move|date=2012-11-19|work=Washington Post|access-date=2020-04-08|last2=Prewitt|first2=and Alex|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/ncaa/marylands-move-big-ten-was-no-brainer|title=Maryland's move to the Big Ten was a no brainer|date=2012-11-19|website=NBC Sports Washington|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> The teams ceased their annual matchup until a meeting five years later in the [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship]].

After five games in six years, the series would go on an 18-year hiatus before resuming as an annual fixture in 1950. Virginia grabbed its victory in nine tries with a five goal win in [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://virginiasports.com/documents/2019/5/29/alltimeresults.pdf?id=6406|title=All Time Results 2020 (PDF)|website=University of Virginia Athletics|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> \n\nThe following year, the teams would meet in 1954 as conference foes for the first time. Maryland continued its early series dominance in response to its first series loss by reeling off another eight consecutive victories. Virginia would snap that streak with its first home victory in 1962, before closing the decade with its first victory in College Park since 1953 in a 9\u20137 win.<ref name=\":1\" /> A victory the following year would be the final before the advent of the [[NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship]]. At the end of this era, Maryland would hold a commanding 21 to 5 series lead, punctuated by its eight game winning streaks.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe advent of the NCAA tournament and rise of Virginia as a major lacrosse power led to a hotly contested period in the series's history. However, the Terps would win the final five meetings of the 1970s, including their first meeting in the postseason, a 15 to 10 victory in the [[1978 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|1978 quarterfinals]].\n\n=== Virginian Dominance (1980s to Present) ===\nVirginia would grab the initiative in 1980, winning seven of the next eight, though Maryland would again top the Cavaliers in the [[1983 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship|1983 quarterfinals]]. Since 1980, the Cavs have won 37 of 55 meetings to narrow Maryland's series lead to just two games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://virginiasports.com/news/2019/5/16/mens-lacrosse-no-4-uva-and-no-6-maryland-rekindle-rivalry-on-saturday-in-the-ncaa-quarterfinals.aspx|title=No. 4 UVA and No. 6 Maryland Rekindle Rivalry on Saturday in the NCAA Quarterfinals|website=University of Virginia Athletics|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Nonetheless, the meetings have often been between top five ranked teams and have lead to numerous classic games.
