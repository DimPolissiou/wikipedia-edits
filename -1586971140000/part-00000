Since obliquity is the angle between the axis of rotation and the direction perpendicular to the orbital plane, it changes as the orbital plane changes due to the influence of other planets. But the axis of rotation can also move ([[axial precession]]), due to torque exerted by the sun on a planet's equatorial bulge. Like Earth, all of the rocky planets show axial precession. If the precession rate were very fast the obliquity would actually remain fairly constant even as the orbital plane changes.<ref name=Ward>{{cite journal|last1=William Ward|title=Large-Scale Variations in the Obliquity of Mars|journal=Science|volume=181|issue=4096|pages=260\u2013262|date=20 July 1973|doi=10.1126/science.181.4096.260|pmid=17730940|bibcode=1973Sci...181..260W}}</ref> The rate varies due to [[Tidal acceleration|tidal dissipation]] and [[Planetary core|core]]-[[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] interaction, among other things. When a planet's precession rate approaches certain values, [[orbital resonance]]s may cause large changes in obliquity. The amplitude of the contribution having one of the resonant rates is divided by the difference between the resonant rate and the precession rate, so it becomes large when the two are similar.<ref name=Ward/> [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]] have most likely been stabilized by the tidal dissipation of the Sun.

To this day dela Cruz's starring role in ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981) is the most successful film export of the [[Philippines]], making him their first international celebrity. Only 83&nbsp;cm (2 feet, 9&nbsp;inches) tall, dela Cruz is the first short person to be listed in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the shortest adult in a leading role, who got international recognition with a streak of films. Born in abject poverty suffering from [[Primordial dwarfism]], dela Cruz started exercising and studied [[karate]] at a nearby dojo. In the mid 1970s, dela Cruz was noticed by producers and couple Peter and Cora Caballes of Liliw Productions. With them dela Cruz started an acting career, and received his pseudonym Weng Weng. Dela Cruz's early film appearances includes his top billing shared with [[Ramon Zamora]] in ''Chopsuey Meets Big Time Papa'' (1978), and played in the supporting cast of three of [[Dolphy]]'s [[Comedy film|comedies]]. Dela Cruz's first lead in ''Agent OO'' (1981) launched two sequels and became his most well known role. \n\nThe sequel of ''Agent OO,'' ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981), gave him brief international stardom. A film festival was organised by first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] in the hope to present Filipino films for the rest of the world. Major entertainment figures were present including [[Priscilla Presley]], [[Franco Nero]], [[Brooke Shields]], [[Jeremy Irons]], among many other. It is written that dela Cruz stole the spotlight from all the regular action stars, and Art House film directors, who are usually front and center in these kind of events. Dela Cruz hyped as a new superstar, was the talk of the town and ''For Your Height Only'' outsold every other films on foreign sales. The film was a success worldwide, establishing dela Cruz under the pseudonym Weng Weng as the first small person with leading roles in films to reach a peak of success. Finally, dela Cruz is still the only small person who made a name for himself in the action genre performing all of his stunts.\n\nFollowing his success dela Cruz appeared in three more films ''D'Wild Wild Weng'' (1982), ''[[The Impossible Kid (film)|The Impossible Kid]]''  (1982), his final performance as Agent OO, and ''The Cute... The Sexy n' The Tiny'' alongside [[Berting Labra]] and [[Pia Moran]]. The first two were distributed internationally without the same success. Shortly after the Caballes had a professional change of heart. Dela Cruz never worked again in the media industry and spent the rest of his living in poverty in with his family in [[Baclaran, Para\u00f1aque|Baclaran]] and passed away at the age of 34 in 1992.\n\nWith the passing of time, dela Cruz became a cult film icon and an online sensation. A lot of information published about dela Cruz was unclear or hyperbolic mythos, some with accounts that support them. Research about his life led to the making of two successful widely release documentaries [[Mark Hartley]]'s ''[[Machete Maidens Unleashed!]]'' (2010), and Andrew Leavold's ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]]'' (2013).\n\n== Early life ==\nDela Cruz was born to Felicito Jose dela Cruz an electrician (1914-1968) and Rita DeGuzman dela Cruz a laundry women (1919-1989), the youngest of five brothers, on the seventh of September 1957. As described by dela Cruz's brother Celing, dela Cruz's early life went as followed. When his mother was pregnant she didn't know until the doctor told her so, and when gave birth, his size was \u201cno bigger than a small coke bottle\u201d. This forced dela Cruz\u2019s parents to place him in a shoe box under a light feeding him with drops. With a medical condition known as [[primordial dwarfism]], it caused dela Cruz to grow to a height of 2 feet and 9 inches (0.83 meter) tall. Being devoted Catholics, dela Cruz's mother showed their devotion to their faith by dressing and parading a young dela Cruz as [[Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa|Santo Ni\u00f1o]] each year for the annual Baclaran parade. Dela Cruz became popular in the neighborhood and his mother Rita felt he should become an actor. By 1968, dela Cruz's father passed away due to falling down a ladder at work<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/145619/weng-weng-lives/|title=Weng Weng Lives!|date=2014-01-04|website=Inquirer Lifestyle|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/arts-and-entertainment/weng-weng-a1707-20170425-lfrm|title=The Larger-Than-Life Story of Weng Weng|work=Esquiremag.ph|access-date=2018-08-25}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite AV media |last= Leavold|first= Andrew|date= |title= ''The Search for Weng Weng''| |language= English|type=DVD |location= USA|publisher= Wild Eye Releasing|id= 760137943594}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Celing, as a child dela Cruz was fascinated with action films and started to study them. Neighbours of the dela Cruz started to notice him climbing on clothing lines doing acrobacies and pull ups. Dela Cruz joined [[Karate]] classes, where he learnt quickly, and impressed his instructor. So much so that the instructor would have demonstrations with dela Cruz to promote the school. During one of these demonstration dela Cruz was noticed by producer and actor Peter Caballes of Liliw Productions. Dela Cruz's mother who had a hard time raising five boys, accepted that Peter his wife Cora Ridon Caballes would take dela Cruz under their helm for a film career.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== 1975 to 1981: Early roles and breakthrough ===\nDela Cruz started to work almost exclusively with Liliw Productions, starting with an uncredited role, ''Silakbo'', released October 17, 1975.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=229}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, dela Cruz billed as Weng Weng, which would be his pseudonym for the rest of his career, acted in ''Silang Matatapang'' and ''Sila...Sa Bawat Bangketa.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=229}}</ref>''\n\nIn 1978, dela Cruz shared the top billing with actor [[Ramon Zamora]] in ''Chopsuey Meets Big Time Papa''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=230-231}}</ref>\n\nAccording to local comic star Rodolfo Vera Quizon Sr. better known as [[Dolphy]], he was introduced to Dela Cruz through his friend Peter Caballes, who found him hilarious.

As well as taking care of dela Cruz's training for the rest of his career, Nicart also expanded his training in karate and acting. Nicart doubted dela Cruz's suitability for the role due to his intellectual and physical limitations, but changed his mind when he realized how collaborative he could be, and how his bravery allowed him never to refuse a stunt.<ref name=\":0\" /> On June 12, ''Da Best In Da West'' was released with Dolphy starring and dela Cruz in a minor role.

The discoveries on Weng Weng led to two theatrically released documentaries. First it inspired [[Mark Hartley]]'s ''[[Machete Maidens Unleashed!]]'' (2010) which focuses on the history of films made in the Philippines during Weng Weng's active years where he had a segment dedicated to him among his contemporaries. The second one about his life, ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]]'' (2013), was directed by Leavold, who also followed it up with a book by the same name, on details that didn't make the final cut or discovered later.

They said that they adopted dela Cruz ten years prior to the release of ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981) to help him. Contemporary action film star [[Rez Cortez]], Franco Guerrero, and Nelson Anderson, who are critical of the couple, have asserted that with the Caballes dela Cruz was provided shelter, received a per diem that was higher than most salaries considering where dela Cruz from and travelled the world. Countries visited by dela Cruz includes [[France]], and [[United States]].

Celing added that dela Cruz was abandoned by the Caballes when they had a career change, became completely absent when dela Cruz became paralyzed after his first stroke and the only thing that was provided beyond this point was dela Cruz's casket paid by Peter, while Cora paid for the service once visited by another of their brother, and that [[Lotis Key]] was the only celebrity to attend.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=201-202|chapter=The death of the Pinoy action king}}</ref>\n\nOn dela Cruz's work conditions, Celing said he was never fully paid what he was owed as according to him the Caballes promised their mother that they buy them a house. Nicart went on to say that the Caballes treated dela Cruz like a dog, would ask him to leave the room in any business meeting, and that gave him the equivalent of $ 500 per film, while they were wealthy owning several mansions. On that matter Anderson felt that dela Cruz was treated like puppet by everyone and the Caballes too possessive. Cortez said, while working on the first film where dela Cruz received the top billing and considering the fact that the dela Cruz's producers took care of his basic needs, Cortez suspected that at the time he wasn't well compensated. Cortez said he saw dela Cruz arrive on set not in his private car but utility vehicle, he went on to say that it is unacceptable to do so with a leading man. While feeling dela Cruz deserved a better compensation, Cortez concluded that he was probably happy, considering where he came from and to get a great deal of life experiences.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn dela Cruz's work ethic, director Nicart, who was a former actor and stuntman for a company named SOS Daredevils, had doubt due to dela Cruz's limitations and went on to say that dela Cruz didn't know how to read a script. Prior the shoot of their first film ''Agent OO'' (1981) for the rest of his career dela Cruz received his training by Nicart who trained his the same way he was. Nicart also worked to polish dela Cruz's acting, advanced Karate lessons for fight choreography, as well as stunts. Nicart said and praised his footwork, and his fearlessness when it came to stunts. Nicart, also said that he originally had doubt on dela Cruz leading a film, but found him to be so collaborative and fearless, having never refused any stunt, that soon enough he sensed that dela Cruz would become famous. On dela Cruz's talent, [[Dolphy]] praised his comic timing and martial arts skills, while Guerrero thinks highly of his acting abilities.\n\nCeling and Nicart said while dela Cruz had a good grasp of what was going around him, but was mentally slow. Guerrero described that dela Cruz had the mind of a ten-year-old and said that dela Cruz believed anything he said, whether it was real or imaginary. Rez Cortez who acted in two film with dela Cruz said that he had trouble getting in touch with his emotions in order to express them. Cortez recalls once asking dela Cruz if he was lonely for which he replied yes I cried. Cortez and Roland Dantes also asserted that dela Cruz had his own sense of reality. Catral said she never noticed dela Cruz's childlike personality. She felt he had a good grip of what was going on and she had adult conversations with dela Cruz. She said he had an odd sense of humor, and maybe that was what others felt.<ref name=\":5\" />  Anderson described him as complex adult, with an unexplored side.\n\nDela Cruz's has several friendships throughout his career. Guerrero describes that the first time he met dela Cruz children were around and did not know what to make him, and when he spoke the little girls got scared. From that point on they became friends. When they shared company, dela Cruz would always make him laugh. A fond memory he holds, is that dela Cruz often taunted him to go sparring, where he would pretend to be way too scared to go along.<ref name=\":0\" /> Anderson's account of the of his friendship with dela Cruz was at time when both were under contract with Liliw Production. Which he describes as being polluted by the possessive attitude of producers Peter and Cora Caballes. When he started socializing with dela Cruz, he noticed the his potential and felt he was put down by others. Anderson found dela Cruz brave, while wanting to be prudent with him de la Cruz was upset at the idea of wearing a belt and helmet while riding with him on his motorcycle. According to him, a man once provoked dela Cruz by tapping his hand on his head and dela Cruz was ready to fight and wasn't afraid of his size, and Anderson had to separate them. He also recalls bringing dela Cruz at an [[Art film|Art house]] cinema named Mabini to introduce him to [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist]] films. Dela Cruz was enthralled by them. Together they watched [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s ''[[Los Olvidados]]'' (1950), [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[La Strada]]'' (1954), and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' (1959). Dela Cruz was particularly fond of [[Vittorio De Sica]]'s ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'' (1948), according to Anderson, on his first viewing dela Cruz cried. They agreed to make an action comedy remake with a human touch. As soon as Anderson started voicing his concerns regarding both dangerous working conditions and mispayments to the Caballes, the Caballes separated them. They would tell him that dela Cruz was absent when he wasn't. Anderson parted ways with the company, never to see him again.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=180-181}}</ref> Catral stated she had some affection for dela Cruz, would prefer to hang with him instead of other crew member, and when she stopped acting to go to law school she made sure to say goodbye to only two actors, dela Cruz and [[Dolphy]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nDela Cruz became friends with president [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand Marco]] and his [[Marcos family|family]], and on several occasions he joined their company. President Marcos gave dela Cruz several honors during his career. According to director Dante Pangilinan it was due to Cora Caballes being the niece of General Prospero Olivas. They brought him to the Marcos palace where according to Marcos' daughter [[Imee Marcos|Imee]] the whole family fell in love with him because of dela Cruz's personal sense of humor was infectious. She went on to say that it was with her brother [[Bongbong Marcos|Bongbong]] with whom dela Cruz was the closest. Former first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] said the following about dela Cruz: The appearance of Weng Weng showed the great Filipino spirit. They can make a hero of a disabled, distorted guy. So everybody had a chance. They have such a democratic attitude. The Filipino have no prejudice. He entertained us. He was distorted but he could make us laugh and make us happy.

To this day dela Cruz's starring role in ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981) is the most successful film export of the [[Philippines]], making him their first international celebrity. Only 83&nbsp;cm (2 feet, 9&nbsp;inches) tall, dela Cruz is the first short person to be listed in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the shortest adult in a leading role, who got international recognition with a streak of films. Born in abject poverty suffering from [[Primordial dwarfism]], dela Cruz started exercising and studied [[karate]] at a nearby dojo. In the mid 1970s, dela Cruz was noticed by producers and couple Peter and Cora Caballes of Liliw Productions. With them dela Cruz started an acting career, and received his pseudonym Weng Weng. Dela Cruz's early film appearances includes his top billing shared with [[Ramon Zamora]] in ''Chopsuey Meets Big Time Papa'' (1978), and played in the supporting cast of three of [[Dolphy]]'s [[Comedy film|comedies]]. Dela Cruz's first lead in ''Agent OO'' (1981) launched two sequels and became his most well known role. \n\nThe sequel of ''Agent OO,'' ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981), gave him brief international stardom. A film festival was organised by first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] in the hope to present Filipino films for the rest of the world. Major entertainment figures were present including [[Priscilla Presley]], [[Franco Nero]], [[Brooke Shields]], [[Jeremy Irons]], among many other. It is written that dela Cruz stole the spotlight from all the regular action stars, and Art House film directors, who are usually front and center in these kind of events. Dela Cruz hyped as a new superstar, was the talk of the town and ''For Your Height Only'' outsold every other films on foreign sales. The film was a success worldwide, establishing dela Cruz under the pseudonym Weng Weng as the first small person with leading roles in films to reach a peak of success. Finally, dela Cruz is still the only small person who made a name for himself in the action genre performing all of his stunts.\n\nFollowing his success dela Cruz appeared in three more films ''D'Wild Wild Weng'' (1982), ''[[The Impossible Kid (film)|The Impossible Kid]]''  (1982), his final performance as Agent OO, and ''The Cute... The Sexy n' The Tiny'' alongside [[Berting Labra]] and [[Pia Moran]]. The first two were distributed internationally without the same success. Shortly after the Caballes had a professional change of heart. Dela Cruz never worked again in the media industry and spent the rest of his living in poverty in with his family in [[Baclaran, Para\u00f1aque|Baclaran]] and passed away at the age of 34 in 1992.\n\nWith the passing of time, dela Cruz became a cult film icon and an online sensation. A lot of information published about dela Cruz was unclear or hyperbolic mythos, some with accounts that support them. Research about his life led to the making of two successful widely release documentaries [[Mark Hartley]]'s ''[[Machete Maidens Unleashed!]]'' (2010), and Andrew Leavold's ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]]'' (2013).\n\n== Early life ==\nDela Cruz was born to Felicito Jose dela Cruz an electrician (1914-1968) and Rita DeGuzman dela Cruz a laundry women (1919-1989), the youngest of five brothers, on the seventh of September 1957. As described by dela Cruz's brother Celing, dela Cruz's early life went as followed. When his mother was pregnant she didn't know until the doctor told her so, and when gave birth, his size was \u201cno bigger than a small coke bottle\u201d. This forced dela Cruz\u2019s parents to place him in a shoe box under a light feeding him with drops. With a medical condition known as [[primordial dwarfism]], it caused dela Cruz to grow to a height of 2 feet and 9 inches (0.83 meter) tall. Being devoted Catholics, dela Cruz's mother showed their devotion to their faith by dressing and parading a young dela Cruz as [[Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa|Santo Ni\u00f1o]] each year for the annual Baclaran parade.

Boyden came to Newark in 1815, and immediately began a torrent of improvements to leather manufacture, culminating in the process for making [[patent leather]]. Boyden's genius led to Newark's manufacturing nearly 90% of the nation's leather by 1870, bringing in $8.6 million in revenue to the city in that year alone. In 1824, Boyden, bored with leather, found a way to produce malleable [[iron]]. Newark also prospered by the construction of the [[Morris Canal]] in 1831. The canal connected Newark with the New Jersey hinterland, at that time a major iron and farm area.<ref>https://archive.org/stream/historyofcityofn02urqu/historyofcityofn02urqu_djvu.txt</ref>\n\nRailroads arrived in 1834 and 1835. A flourishing shipping business resulted, and Newark became the area's industrial center. By 1826, Newark's population stood at 8,017, ten times the 1776 number.<ref>{{cite book| author=Cunningham, John T. | title=Newark |publisher= New Jersey Historical Society | year=1989 | isbn=0-911020-18-7 }}, Chapters 11 and 18.</ref>\n\nThe middle 19th century saw continued growth and diversification of Newark's industrial base. The first commercially successful [[plastic]] \u2014 [[Celluloid]] \u2014 was produced in a factory on Mechanic Street by [[John Wesley Hyatt]]. Hyatt's Celluloid found its way into Newark-made carriages, [[billiard balls]], and [[dentures]]. [[Edward Weston (chemist)|Dr. Edward Weston]] perfected a process for [[zinc]] [[electroplating]], as well as a superior [[arc lamp]] in Newark. Newark's Military Park had the first public electric lamps anywhere in the United States. Before moving to [[Menlo Park, New Jersey|Menlo Park]], [[Thomas Edison]] himself made Newark home in the early 1870s. He invented the [[ticker tape|stock ticker]] in the Brick City.<ref>{{cite book| author=Cunningham, John T. | title=Newark |publisher= New Jersey Historical Society | year=1989 | isbn=0-911020-18-7 }}, p.181.</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th century, Newark's industry was further developed, especially through the efforts of such men as J. W. Hyatt. From the mid-century on, numerous [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Germans|German]] immigrants moved to the city. The Germans were primarily refugees from the [[revolutions of 1848]],<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Newark (New Jersey)}}</ref> and, as other groups later did, established their own ethnic enterprises, such as newspapers and breweries. However, tensions existed between the \"native stock\" and the newer groups.\n\n[[Image:ewrsmelt.jpg|thumb|left|[[Balbach Smelting and Refining Company]] ca. 1870. Now the location of baseball fields at [[Riverbank Park]].]]\nIn the middle 19th century, Newark added [[insurance]] to its repertoire of businesses; [[Mutual Benefit Life Insurance|Mutual Benefit]] was founded in the city in 1845 and [[Prudential Insurance|Prudential]] in 1873. Prudential, or \"the Pru\" as generations knew it, was founded by another transplanted New Englander, John Fairfield Dryden.  He found a niche catering to the middle and lower classes. In the late 1880s, companies based in Newark sold more insurance than those in any city except [[Hartford, Connecticut]].<ref>{{cite book| author=Cunningham, John T. | title=Newark |publisher= New Jersey Historical Society | year=1989 | isbn=0-911020-18-7 }}, p.186.</ref>\n\nIn 1880, Newark's population stood at 136,500 in 1890 at 181,830; in 1900 at 246,070; and in 1910 at 347,000, a jump of 200,000 in three decades.<ref>{{cite book| author=Cunningham, John T. | title=Newark |publisher= New Jersey Historical Society | year=1989 | isbn=0-911020-18-7 }}, p.201.</ref> As Newark's population approached a half million in the 1920s, the city's potential seemed limitless. It was said in 1927: \"Great is Newark's vitality. It is the red blood in its veins \u2013 this basic strength that is going to carry it over whatever hurdles it may encounter, enable it to recover from whatever losses it may suffer and battle its way to still higher achievement industrially and financially, making it eventually perhaps the greatest industrial center in the world\".<ref>{{cite crabgrass}}, p.275</ref>\n\nSanitary conditions were bad throughout urban America in the 19th century, but Newark had an especially bad reputation because of the accumulation of human and horse waste built up on the city streets, its inadequate sewage systems, and the dubious quality of its water supply.<ref>Stuart Galishoff, ''Newark: the nation's unhealthiest city, 1832-1895'' (1988).</ref>\n\n==1900-1945==\n[[File:Newark Penn station ca. 1911 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Newark's old Penn station, ca. 1911]]\nNewark was bustling in the early-to-mid-20th century. Market and Broad Streets served as a center of retail commerce for the region, anchored by four flourishing department stores: [[Hahne & Company]], [[Bambergers]] and Company, [[S. Klein]] and [[Kresge-Newark]]. \"Broad Street today is the Mecca of visitors as it has been through all its long history,\" Newark merchants boasted, \"they come in hundreds of thousands now when once they came in hundreds.\"<ref>{{cite book| author=Cunningham, John T. | title=Newark |publisher= New Jersey Historical Society | year=1989 | isbn=0-911020-18-7 }}, p.195</ref>\n\n[[File:1920 map Newark, New Jersey Automobile Blue Book.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Newark in 1920]]\n\nIn 1922, Newark had 63 live theaters, 46 movie theaters, and an active nightlife. [[Dutch Schultz]] was killed in 1935 at the local Palace Bar. [[Billie Holiday]] frequently stayed at the Coleman Hotel. By some measures, the intersection of Broad and Market Streets \u2014 known as the \"[[Four Corners (Newark)|Four Corners]]\" \u2014 was the busiest intersection in the United States.  In 1915, Public Service counted over 280,000 pedestrian crossings in one 13-hour period. Eleven years later, on October 26, 1926, a State Motor Vehicle Department check at the Four Corners counted 2,644 trolleys, 4,098 buses, 2657 taxis, 3474 commercial vehicles, and 23,571 automobiles. Traffic in Newark was so heavy that the city converted the old bed of the [[Morris Canal]] into the [[Newark City Subway]], making Newark one of the few cities in the country to have an underground system. Essex County was the first county park system in the country.\nNew skyscrapers were being built every year, the two [[List of tallest buildings in Newark|tallest in the city]] being the [[Art Deco]] [[National Newark Building]] and the [[Eleven 80|Lefcourt-Newark Building]]. In 1948, just after [[World War II]], Newark hit its peak population of just under 450,000. The population also grew as immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe settled there. Newark was the center of distinctive neighborhoods, including a large  Eastern European Jewish community concentrated along Prince Street<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Levinson |first1=Jay |title=Demise of Newark Jewry: Social Evolution |journal=(UK) Jewish Tribune |date=17 April 2019 |page=58}}</ref>. In 1959 German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe designed an apartment complex across from Branchbrook Park.\n\n==Post-World War II era==\n[[File:FWPNW026NewarkNegroSurveyNJSA0421.jpg|thumb|Children's Playground at Prudential Apartments, c.1940]]\nProblems existed underneath the industrial hum. In 1930, a city commissioner told the Optimists, a local booster club:\n\n{{cquote|Newark is not like the city of old. The old, quiet residential community is a thing of the past, and in its place has come a city teeming with activity. With the change has come something unfortunate\u2014the large number of outstanding citizens who used to live within the community's boundaries has dwindled. Many of them have moved to the suburbs and their home interests are there.<ref name=\"author= jackson, kenneth t.277\">{{cite crabgrass}}, p.277</ref>}}\n\nWhile many observers attributed Newark's decline to post-[[World War II]] phenomena, others point to an earlier decline in the city budget as an indicator of problems.  It fell from $58 million in 1938 to only $45 million in 1944.  This was a slow recovery from the Great Depression.  The buildup to World War II was causing an increase in the nation's economy.  The city increased its tax rate from $4.61 to $5.30.\n\nSome attribute Newark's downfall to its propensity for building large housing projects.  Newark's housing had long been a matter of concern, as much of it was older. A 1944 city-commissioned study showed that 31 percent of all Newark dwelling units were below standards of health, and only 17 percent of Newark's units were owner-occupied. Vast sections of Newark consisted of wooden tenements, and at least 5,000 units failed to meet thresholds of being a decent place to live. Bad housing was the cause of demands that government intervene in the housing market to improve conditions.<ref>{{cite book| author=Cunningham, John T. | title=Newark |publisher= New Jersey Historical Society | year=1989 | isbn=0-911020-18-7 }}, Chapter 27.</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Kenneth T. Jackson]] and others theorized that Newark, with a poor center surrounded by middle-class outlying areas, only did well when it was able to annex middle-class suburbs. When municipal annexation broke down, urban problems were exacerbated as the middle-class ring became divorced from the poor center. In 1900, Newark's mayor had confidently speculated, \"[[East Orange, New Jersey|East Orange]], [[Vailsburg, Newark, New Jersey|Vailsburg]], [[Harrison, New Jersey|Harrison]], [[Kearny, New Jersey|Kearny]], and [[Belleville, New Jersey|Belleville]] would be desirable acquisitions. By an exercise of discretion we can enlarge the city from decade to decade without unnecessarily taxing the property within our limits, which has already paid the cost of public improvements.\" Only Vailsburg would ever be added.<ref name=\"author= jackson, kenneth t.277\"/>\n\nAlthough numerous problems predated [[World War II]], Newark was more hamstrung by a number of trends in the post-WWII era. The [[Federal Housing Administration]] [[redlining|redlined]] virtually all of Newark, preferring to back up mortgages in the white suburbs. This made it impossible for people to get mortgages for purchase or loans for improvements.  Manufacturers set up in lower wage environments outside the city and received larger tax deductions for building new factories in outlying areas than for rehabilitating old factories in the city. The federal tax structure essentially subsidized such inequities.\n\nBilled as transportation improvements, construction of new highways: [[Interstate 280 (New Jersey)|Interstate 280]], the [[New Jersey Turnpike]], and [[Interstate 78]] harmed Newark. They directly hurt the city by dividing the fabric of neighborhoods and displacing many residents. The highways indirectly hurt the city because the new infrastructure made it easier for middle-class workers to live in the suburbs and commute into the city.\n\nDespite its problems, Newark tried to remain vital in the postwar era. The city successfully persuaded [[Prudential Financial|Prudential]] and Mutual Benefit to stay and build new offices. [[Rutgers University|Rutgers University-Newark]], [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]], and [[Seton Hall University]] expanded their Newark presences, with the former building a brand-new campus on a 23-acre (9 hectare) urban renewal site. The [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] made [[Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal|Port Newark]] the first container port in the nation.  South of the city, during the postwar era, it took over operations at [[Newark Liberty International Airport]], now the thirteenth busiest airport in the United States.\n\n[[Image:Newarknight.jpg|thumb|left|[[List of tallest buildings in Newark|The tallest buildings in downtown Newark]]: 1180 Raymond, 740 Broad St., and Prudential Insurance Headquarters.]]\n\nThe city made serious mistakes with [[public housing]] and [[urban renewal]], although these were not the sole causes of Newark's tragedy. Across several administrations, the city leaders of Newark considered the federal government's offer to pay for 100% of the costs of housing projects as a blessing. The decline in industrial jobs meant that more poor people needed housing, whereas in prewar years, public housing was for working-class families.  While other cities were skeptical about putting so many poor families together and were cautious in building housing projects, Newark pursued federal funds.  Eventually, Newark had a higher percentage of its residents in public housing than any other American city.\n\nThe largely [[Italian-American]] [[Seventh Avenue, Newark, New Jersey|First Ward]] was one of the hardest hit by urban renewal. A 46-acre (19 hectare) housing tract, labeled a slum because it had dense older housing, was torn down for multi-story, multi-racial [[Le Corbusier]]-style high rises, named the Christopher Columbus Homes. The tract had contained 8th Avenue, the commercial heart of the neighborhood. Fifteen small-scale blocks were combined into three \"superblocks\". The Columbus Homes, never in harmony with the rest of the neighborhood, were vacated in the 1980s.  They were finally torn down in 1994.<ref>{{cite book | author=Immerso, Michael | title=Newark's Little Italy: The Vanished First Ward | publisher= Rutgers University Press | year=1999 | isbn=0-8135-2757-0 }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1950 to 1960, while Newark's overall population dropped from 438,000 to 408,000, it gained 65,000 non-whites. By 1966, Newark had a black majority, a faster turnover than most other northern cities had experienced. Evaluating the [[1967 Newark riots|riots of 1967]], Newark educator Nathan Wright, Jr. said, \"No typical American city has as yet experienced such a precipitous change from a white to a black majority.\" The misfortune of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] and [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] migration was that Southern blacks and Puerto Ricans were moving to Newark to be industrial workers just as the industrial jobs were decreasing sharply. Many suffered the culture shock of leaving a rural area for an urban industrial job base and environment. The latest migrants to Newark left poverty in the South to find poverty in the North.\n\nDuring the 1950s alone, Newark's white population decreased by more than 25 percent from 363,000 to 266,000. From 1960 to 1967, its white population fell further to 46,000. Although in-migration of new ethnic groups combined with white flight markedly affected the demographics of Newark, the racial composition of city workers did not change as rapidly.  In addition, the political and economic power in the city remained based in the white population.\n\nIn 1967, out of a [[Newark Police Department|police force]] of 1,400, only 150 members were black, mostly in subordinate positions.  Racial tensions arose because of the disproportion between residents and police demographics.  Since Newark's blacks lived in neighborhoods that had been white only two decades earlier, nearly all of their apartments and stores were white-owned as well. The loss of jobs affected overall income in the city, and many owners cut back on maintenance of buildings, contributing to a cycle of deterioration in housing stock.\n\nWithout consulting any residents of the neighborhood to be affected, [[Hugh Joseph Addonizio|Mayor Addonizio]] offered to condemn and raze 150 acres (61 hectares) of a densely populated black neighborhood in the central ward for the [[University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey]] (UMDNJ). UMDNJ had wanted to settle in suburban [[Madison, New Jersey|Madison]], NJ.\n\n==1967 Newark riots==\n{{Main article|1967 Newark riots}}\nOn July 12, 1967, a taxi driver named John Smith was violently injured while respectfully accepting arrest. A crowd gathered outside the police station where Smith was detained. Due to miscommunication, the crowd believed Smith had died in custody, although he had been transported to a hospital via a back entrance to the station. This sparked scuffles between African Americans and police in the Fourth Ward, although the damage toll was only $2,500.\n\nSubsequent to television news broadcasts on July 13 however, new and larger [[race riot|riots]] took place. Twenty-six people were killed; 1,500 wounded; 1,600 arrested; and $10 million in property was destroyed. More than a thousand businesses were [[arson|torched]] or looted, including 167 groceries (most of which would never reopen). Newark's reputation suffered dramatically. It was said, \"wherever American cities are going, Newark will get there first.\"<ref>{{cite book| author=Cunningham, John T. | title=Newark |publisher= New Jersey Historical Society | year=1989 | isbn=0-911020-18-7 }}, p.330.</ref>\n\nThe long and short term causes of the riots are explored in depth in the documentary film ''[[Revolution '67]]''.\n\n==After the riots==\n[[Image:NewarkRiot-Area.jpg|thumb|Semi-abandoned buildings in the riot area, mid-1990s]]\nThe 1970s and 1980s brought continued decline. Middle class residents of all races continued to flee the city.  Certain pockets of the city developed as domains of poverty and social isolation. Some say that whenever the media of New York needed to find some example of urban despair, they traveled to Newark.\n\nIn ''[[American Pastoral]]'', the 1997 novel by Newark-born author [[Philip Roth]], the protagonist Swede Levov says:\n{{cquote|Newark used to be the city where they manufactured everything, now it's the car theft capital of the world ... there was a factory where somebody was making something on every side street. Now there's a liquor store on every street \u2014 a liquor store, a pizza stand, and a seedy storefront church. Everything else is in ruins or boarded up.}}\n\nIn January 1975, an article in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' ranked the 50 largest American cities in 24 categories, ranging from park space to crime. Newark was one of the five worst in 19 out of 24 categories, and the very worst in nine. According to the article, only 70 percent of residents owned a telephone.  [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], the city ranked second worst, was much farther from Newark than the cities in the top five were from each other. The article concluded:\n\n{{cquote|The city of Newark stands without serious challenge as the worst city of all. It ranked among the worst cities in no fewer than nineteen of twenty-four categories, and it was dead last in nine of them... Newark is a city that desperately needs help.<ref>''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'', January 1975</ref>}}\n\nNewark has had several achievements in the two and a half decades since the riots. In 1968, the [[New Community Corporation]] was founded.  It has become one of the most successful [[community development corporation]]s in the nation. By 1987, the NCC owned and managed 2,265 low-income housing units.\n\n[[Image:Newark-broad-street.jpg|thumb|Broad Street from the Prudential Financial Building.]]Newark's downtown began to redevelop in the post-riot decades. Less than two weeks after the riots, Prudential announced plans to underwrite a $24 million office complex near [[Pennsylvania Station (Newark)|Penn Station]], dubbed \"Gateway.\" Today, Gateway houses thousands of white-collar workers, though few live in Newark.<ref>[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=103094 Grant USA Tower], accessed, October 30, 2006</ref>\n\nBefore the riots, the [[University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey]] was considering building in the suburbs. The riots and Newark's undeniable desperation kept the medical school in the city.   However, instead of being built on 167 acres (676,000&nbsp;m\u00b2), the medical school was built on just {{convert|60|acre|m2}}, part of which was already city owned.  Students at the medical school soon started the \"Student Family Health Clinic\" to provide free health care for the underserved population, along with other community service projects.  It continues to operate today as one of the nation's oldest student-run free health clinics.\n\nIn 1970, [[Kenneth A. Gibson]] was the first African-American to be elected mayor of Newark, as well as to be elected mayor of a major northeastern city. The 1970s were a time of battles between Gibson and the shrinking white population.  Gibson admitted that \"Newark may be the most decayed and financially crippled city in the nation.\"  He and the city council raised taxes to try to improve services such as schools and sanitation, but they did nothing for Newark's economic base.  The CEO of Ballantine's Brewery asserted that Newark's $1 million annual tax bill was the cause of the company's bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite book| author=Cunningham, John T. | title=Newark |publisher= New Jersey Historical Society | year=1989 | isbn=0-911020-18-7 }}, p.339.</ref>\n\nPrior to the election of former mayor [[Cory Booker]] in 2006, Newark did not have a formal city planning department. As a result, a fellow at the [[Manhattan Institute for Policy Research]] concluded:\n\n{{cquote|\u201cNewark is a living laboratory for nearly every bad planning idea of the 20th century.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/confidence-man-cory-booker-profile|title=From the Archives: \u2018Confidence Man,\u2019 Next City\u2019s 2009 Profile of Cory Booker|website=nextcity.org|date=August 14, 2013|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref>}}\n\n==Newark's Renaissance==\n\n===Downtown===\n[[File:Newark NJPAC adj.jpg|thumb|The New Jersey Performing Arts Center]]\n\nThe [[New Jersey Performing Arts Center]], which opened in the downtown area in 1997 at a cost of $180 million, was seen by many as the first step in the city's road to revival, and brought in people to Newark who otherwise might never have visited. NJPAC is known for its acoustics, and features the [[New Jersey Symphony Orchestra]] as its resident orchestra. NJPAC also presents a diverse group of visiting artists such as [[Itzhak Perlman]], [[Sarah Brightman]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [['N Sync]], [[Lauryn Hill]], the [[Vienna Boys' Choir]], [[Yo Yo Ma]], the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]] of [[Amsterdam]], and the [[Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]].<ref>[http://www.njpac.org/load_screen.asp?screen=history History of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324055716/http://www.njpac.org/load_screen.asp?screen=history# |date=2009-03-24 }}, accessed, March 23, 2007</ref>\n\nSince then, the city has built a [[baseball]] stadium ([[Bears & Eagles Riverfront Stadium|Riverfront Stadium]]) for the [[Newark Bears]], the city's [[minor league]] team. In 2007, the [[Prudential Center]] (nicknamed, \"The Rock\") opened for the [[New Jersey Devils]].  The Passaic River waterfront is being refurbished through downtown to provide citizens with access to the river. The [[Newark Public Library]] is planning a major renovation and expansion.  The Port Authority constructed a rail connection to the airport ([[AirTrain Newark]]).  Numerous commercial developments have arisen in the downtown area.\n\nWhile much of the city's revitalization efforts have been focused in the downtown area, adjoining neighborhoods have in recent years begun to see some signs of development, particularly in the Central Ward. Since 2000, Newark has gained population, its first increase since the 1940s.  Nevertheless, the \"Renaissance\" has been unevenly felt across the city and some districts continue to have below-average household incomes and higher-than-average rates of poverty.\n\nBy the mid-first decade of the 21st century, the rate of crime had fallen by 58% from historic highs associated with severe drug problems in the mid-1990s, though murders remained high for a city of its size. {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}  In the first two months of 2008, the murder rate dropped dramatically, with no murders recorded for 43 days.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nNewark's nicknames reflect the efforts to revitalize downtown.  In the 1950s the term '''New Newark''' was given to the city by then-Mayor Leo Carlin to help convince major corporations to remain in Newark.  In the 1960s Newark was nicknamed the '''Gateway City''' after the redeveloped Gateway Center area downtown, which shares its name with the [[tourism region]] of which Newark is a part, the [[Gateway Region]]. It has more recently been called the '''Renaissance City''' by the media and the public to gain recognition for its revitalization efforts.<ref>[http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/index.ssf?/news/ledger/stories/120805_cummings.html Revitalization Efforts], accessed, March 23, 2007</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of Newark, New Jersey]]\n* [[Sports in Newark, New Jersey]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Further reading'''\n{{see also|Timeline of Newark, New Jersey#Bibliography}}\n* {{Citation |publisher = The Office of the Newark Daily Advertiser |location = Newark, N.J |title = Directory of Newark, for 1835-6 |date = 1835 |ol = 23673568M }}\n* {{Citation |publisher = Pierson |location = Newark, N.J |title = Directory of the city of Newark, for 1838-9 |date = 1838 |ol = 23295513M }}\n* {{Citation |publisher = Holbrook's Steam Press |location = Newark, N.J |author = B.

Boyden came to Newark in 1815, and immediately began a torrent of improvements to leather manufacture, culminating in the process for making [[patent leather]]. Boyden's genius led to Newark's manufacturing nearly 90% of the nation's leather by 1870, bringing in $8.6 million in revenue to the city in that year alone. In 1824, Boyden, bored with leather, found a way to produce malleable [[iron]]. Newark also prospered by the construction of the [[Morris Canal]] in 1831. The canal connected Newark with the New Jersey hinterland, at that time a major iron and farm area.<ref>https://archive.org/stream/historyofcityofn02urqu/historyofcityofn02urqu_djvu.txt</ref>\n\nRailroads arrived in 1834 and 1835. A flourishing shipping business resulted, and Newark became the area's industrial center. By 1826, Newark's population stood at 8,017, ten times the 1776 number.<ref>{{cite book| author=Cunningham, John T. | title=Newark |publisher= New Jersey Historical Society | year=1989 | isbn=0-911020-18-7 }}, Chapters 11 and 18.</ref>\n\nThe middle 19th century saw continued growth and diversification of Newark's industrial base. The first commercially successful [[plastic]] \u2014 [[Celluloid]] \u2014 was produced in a factory on Mechanic Street by [[John Wesley Hyatt]]. Hyatt's Celluloid found its way into Newark-made carriages, [[billiard balls]], and [[dentures]]. [[Edward Weston (chemist)|Dr. Edward Weston]] perfected a process for [[zinc]] [[electroplating]], as well as a superior [[arc lamp]] in Newark. Newark's Military Park had the first public electric lamps anywhere in the United States. Before moving to [[Menlo Park, New Jersey|Menlo Park]], [[Thomas Edison]] himself made Newark home in the early 1870s. He invented the [[ticker tape|stock ticker]] in the Brick City.<ref>{{cite book| author=Cunningham, John T. | title=Newark |publisher= New Jersey Historical Society | year=1989 | isbn=0-911020-18-7 }}, p.181.</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th century, Newark's industry was further developed, especially through the efforts of such men as J. W. Hyatt. From the mid-century on, numerous [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Germans|German]] immigrants moved to the city. The Germans were primarily refugees from the [[revolutions of 1848]],<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Newark (New Jersey)}}</ref> and, as other groups later did, established their own ethnic enterprises, such as newspapers and breweries. However, tensions existed between the \"native stock\" and the newer groups.\n\n[[Image:ewrsmelt.jpg|thumb|left|[[Balbach Smelting and Refining Company]] ca. 1870. Now the location of baseball fields at [[Riverbank Park]].]]\nIn the middle 19th century, Newark added [[insurance]] to its repertoire of businesses; [[Mutual Benefit Life Insurance|Mutual Benefit]] was founded in the city in 1845 and [[Prudential Insurance|Prudential]] in 1873. Prudential, or \"the Pru\" as generations knew it, was founded by another transplanted New Englander, John Fairfield Dryden.  He found a niche catering to the middle and lower classes. In the late 1880s, companies based in Newark sold more insurance than those in any city except [[Hartford, Connecticut]].<ref>{{cite book| author=Cunningham, John T. | title=Newark |publisher= New Jersey Historical Society | year=1989 | isbn=0-911020-18-7 }}, p.186.</ref>\n\nIn 1880, Newark's population stood at 136,500 in 1890 at 181,830; in 1900 at 246,070; and in 1910 at 347,000, a jump of 200,000 in three decades.<ref>{{cite book| author=Cunningham, John T. | title=Newark |publisher= New Jersey Historical Society | year=1989 | isbn=0-911020-18-7 }}, p.201.</ref> As Newark's population approached a half million in the 1920s, the city's potential seemed limitless. It was said in 1927: \"Great is Newark's vitality. It is the red blood in its veins \u2013 this basic strength that is going to carry it over whatever hurdles it may encounter, enable it to recover from whatever losses it may suffer and battle its way to still higher achievement industrially and financially, making it eventually perhaps the greatest industrial center in the world\".<ref>{{cite crabgrass}}, p.275</ref>\n\nSanitary conditions were bad throughout urban America in the 19th century, but Newark had an especially bad reputation because of the accumulation of human and horse waste built up on the city streets, its inadequate sewage systems, and the dubious quality of its water supply.<ref>Stuart Galishoff, ''Newark: the nation's unhealthiest city, 1832-1895'' (1988).</ref>\n\n==1900-1945==\n[[File:Newark Penn station ca. 1911 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Newark's old Penn station, ca. 1911]]\nNewark was bustling in the early-to-mid-20th century. Market and Broad Streets served as a center of retail commerce for the region, anchored by four flourishing department stores: [[Hahne & Company]], [[Bambergers]] and Company, [[S. Klein]] and [[Kresge-Newark]]. \"Broad Street today is the Mecca of visitors as it has been through all its long history,\" Newark merchants boasted, \"they come in hundreds of thousands now when once they came in hundreds.\"<ref>{{cite book| author=Cunningham, John T. | title=Newark |publisher= New Jersey Historical Society | year=1989 | isbn=0-911020-18-7 }}, p.195</ref>\n\n[[File:1920 map Newark, New Jersey Automobile Blue Book.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Newark in 1920]]\n\nIn 1922, Newark had 63 live theaters, 46 movie theaters, and an active nightlife. [[Dutch Schultz]] was killed in 1935 at the local Palace Bar. [[Billie Holiday]] frequently stayed at the Coleman Hotel. By some measures, the intersection of Broad and Market Streets \u2014 known as the \"[[Four Corners (Newark)|Four Corners]]\" \u2014 was the busiest intersection in the United States.  In 1915, Public Service counted over 280,000 pedestrian crossings in one 13-hour period. Eleven years later, on October 26, 1926, a State Motor Vehicle Department check at the Four Corners counted 2,644 trolleys, 4,098 buses, 2657 taxis, 3474 commercial vehicles, and 23,571 automobiles. Traffic in Newark was so heavy that the city converted the old bed of the [[Morris Canal]] into the [[Newark City Subway]], making Newark one of the few cities in the country to have an underground system. Essex County was the first county park system in the country.\nNew skyscrapers were being built every year, the two [[List of tallest buildings in Newark|tallest in the city]] being the [[Art Deco]] [[National Newark Building]] and the [[Eleven 80|Lefcourt-Newark Building]]. In 1948, just after [[World War II]], Newark hit its peak population of just under 450,000. The population also grew as immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe settled there. Newark was the center of distinctive neighborhoods, including a large  Eastern European Jewish community concentrated along Prince Street<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Levinson |first1=Jay |title=Demise of Newark Jewry: Social Evolution |journal=(UK) Jewish Tribune |date=17 April 2019 |page=58}}</ref>. In 1959 German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe designed an apartment complex across from Branchbrook Park.\n\n==Post-World War II era==\n[[File:FWPNW026NewarkNegroSurveyNJSA0421.jpg|thumb|Children's Playground at Prudential Apartments, c.1940]]\nProblems existed underneath the industrial hum. In 1930, a city commissioner told the Optimists, a local booster club:\n\n{{cquote|Newark is not like the city of old. The old, quiet residential community is a thing of the past, and in its place has come a city teeming with activity. With the change has come something unfortunate\u2014the large number of outstanding citizens who used to live within the community's boundaries has dwindled. Many of them have moved to the suburbs and their home interests are there.<ref name=\"author= jackson, kenneth t.277\">{{cite crabgrass}}, p.277</ref>}}\n\nWhile many observers attributed Newark's decline to post-[[World War II]] phenomena, others point to an earlier decline in the city budget as an indicator of problems.  It fell from $58 million in 1938 to only $45 million in 1944.  This was a slow recovery from the Great Depression.  The buildup to World War II was causing an increase in the nation's economy.  The city increased its tax rate from $4.61 to $5.30.\n\nSome attribute Newark's downfall to its propensity for building large housing projects.  Newark's housing had long been a matter of concern, as much of it was older. A 1944 city-commissioned study showed that 31 percent of all Newark dwelling units were below standards of health, and only 17 percent of Newark's units were owner-occupied. Vast sections of Newark consisted of wooden tenements, and at least 5,000 units failed to meet thresholds of being a decent place to live. Bad housing was the cause of demands that government intervene in the housing market to improve conditions.<ref>{{cite book| author=Cunningham, John T. | title=Newark |publisher= New Jersey Historical Society | year=1989 | isbn=0-911020-18-7 }}, Chapter 27.</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Kenneth T. Jackson]] and others theorized that Newark, with a poor center surrounded by middle-class outlying areas, only did well when it was able to annex middle-class suburbs. When municipal annexation broke down, urban problems were exacerbated as the middle-class ring became divorced from the poor center. In 1900, Newark's mayor had confidently speculated, \"[[East Orange, New Jersey|East Orange]], [[Vailsburg, Newark, New Jersey|Vailsburg]], [[Harrison, New Jersey|Harrison]], [[Kearny, New Jersey|Kearny]], and [[Belleville, New Jersey|Belleville]] would be desirable acquisitions. By an exercise of discretion we can enlarge the city from decade to decade without unnecessarily taxing the property within our limits, which has already paid the cost of public improvements.\" Only Vailsburg would ever be added.<ref name=\"author= jackson, kenneth t.277\"/>\n\nAlthough numerous problems predated [[World War II]], Newark was more hamstrung by a number of trends in the post-WWII era. The [[Federal Housing Administration]] [[redlining|redlined]] virtually all of Newark, preferring to back up mortgages in the white suburbs. This made it impossible for people to get mortgages for purchase or loans for improvements.  Manufacturers set up in lower wage environments outside the city and received larger tax deductions for building new factories in outlying areas than for rehabilitating old factories in the city. The federal tax structure essentially subsidized such inequities.\n\nBilled as transportation improvements, construction of new highways: [[Interstate 280 (New Jersey)|Interstate 280]], the [[New Jersey Turnpike]], and [[Interstate 78]] harmed Newark. They directly hurt the city by dividing the fabric of neighborhoods and displacing many residents. The highways indirectly hurt the city because the new infrastructure made it easier for middle-class workers to live in the suburbs and commute into the city.\n\nDespite its problems, Newark tried to remain vital in the postwar era. The city successfully persuaded [[Prudential Financial|Prudential]] and Mutual Benefit to stay and build new offices. [[Rutgers University|Rutgers University-Newark]], [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]], and [[Seton Hall University]] expanded their Newark presences, with the former building a brand-new campus on a 23-acre (9 hectare) urban renewal site. The [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] made [[Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal|Port Newark]] the first container port in the nation.  South of the city, during the postwar era, it took over operations at [[Newark Liberty International Airport]], now the thirteenth busiest airport in the United States.\n\n[[Image:Newarknight.jpg|thumb|left|[[List of tallest buildings in Newark|The tallest buildings in downtown Newark]]: 1180 Raymond, 740 Broad St., and Prudential Insurance Headquarters.]]\n\nThe city made serious mistakes with [[public housing]] and [[urban renewal]], although these were not the sole causes of Newark's tragedy. Across several administrations, the city leaders of Newark considered the federal government's offer to pay for 100% of the costs of housing projects as a blessing. The decline in industrial jobs meant that more poor people needed housing, whereas in prewar years, public housing was for working-class families.  While other cities were skeptical about putting so many poor families together and were cautious in building housing projects, Newark pursued federal funds.  Eventually, Newark had a higher percentage of its residents in public housing than any other American city.\n\nThe largely [[Italian-American]] [[Seventh Avenue, Newark, New Jersey|First Ward]] was one of the hardest hit by urban renewal. A 46-acre (19 hectare) housing tract, labeled a slum because it had dense older housing, was torn down for multi-story, multi-racial [[Le Corbusier]]-style high rises, named the Christopher Columbus Homes. The tract had contained 8th Avenue, the commercial heart of the neighborhood. Fifteen small-scale blocks were combined into three \"superblocks\". The Columbus Homes, never in harmony with the rest of the neighborhood, were vacated in the 1980s.  They were finally torn down in 1994.<ref>{{cite book | author=Immerso, Michael | title=Newark's Little Italy: The Vanished First Ward | publisher= Rutgers University Press | year=1999 | isbn=0-8135-2757-0 }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1950 to 1960, while Newark's overall population dropped from 438,000 to 408,000, it gained 65,000 non-whites. By 1966, Newark had a black majority, a faster turnover than most other northern cities had experienced. Evaluating the [[1967 Newark riots|riots of 1967]], Newark educator Nathan Wright, Jr. said, \"No typical American city has as yet experienced such a precipitous change from a white to a black majority.\" The misfortune of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] and [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] migration was that Southern blacks and Puerto Ricans were moving to Newark to be industrial workers just as the industrial jobs were decreasing sharply. Many suffered the culture shock of leaving a rural area for an urban industrial job base and environment. The latest migrants to Newark left poverty in the South to find poverty in the North.\n\nDuring the 1950s alone, Newark's white population decreased by more than 25 percent from 363,000 to 266,000. From 1960 to 1967, its white population fell further to 46,000. Although in-migration of new ethnic groups combined with white flight markedly affected the demographics of Newark, the racial composition of city workers did not change as rapidly.  In addition, the political and economic power in the city remained based in the white population.\n\nIn 1967, out of a [[Newark Police Department|police force]] of 1,400, only 150 members were black, mostly in subordinate positions.  Racial tensions arose because of the disproportion between residents and police demographics.  Since Newark's blacks lived in neighborhoods that had been white only two decades earlier, nearly all of their apartments and stores were white-owned as well. The loss of jobs affected overall income in the city, and many owners cut back on maintenance of buildings, contributing to a cycle of deterioration in housing stock.\n\nWithout consulting any residents of the neighborhood to be affected, [[Hugh Joseph Addonizio|Mayor Addonizio]] offered to condemn and raze 150 acres (61 hectares) of a densely populated black neighborhood in the central ward for the [[University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey]] (UMDNJ). UMDNJ had wanted to settle in suburban [[Madison, New Jersey|Madison]], NJ.\n\n==1967 Newark riots==\n{{Main article|1967 Newark riots}}\nOn July 12, 1967, a taxi driver named John Smith was violently injured while respectfully accepting arrest. A crowd gathered outside the police station where Smith was detained. Due to miscommunication, the crowd believed Smith had died in custody, although he had been transported to a hospital via a back entrance to the station. This sparked scuffles between African Americans and police in the Fourth Ward, although the damage toll was only $2,500.\n\nSubsequent to television news broadcasts on July 13 however, new and larger [[race riot|riots]] took place. Twenty-six people were killed; 1,500 wounded; 1,600 arrested; and $10 million in property was destroyed. More than a thousand businesses were [[arson|torched]] or looted, including 167 groceries (most of which would never reopen). Newark's reputation suffered dramatically. It was said, \"wherever American cities are going, Newark will get there first.\"<ref>{{cite book| author=Cunningham, John T. | title=Newark |publisher= New Jersey Historical Society | year=1989 | isbn=0-911020-18-7 }}, p.330.</ref>\n\nThe long and short term causes of the riots are explored in depth in the documentary film ''[[Revolution '67]]''.\n\n==After the riots==\n[[Image:NewarkRiot-Area.jpg|thumb|Semi-abandoned buildings in the riot area, mid-1990s]]\nThe 1970s and 1980s brought continued decline. Middle class residents of all races continued to flee the city.  Certain pockets of the city developed as domains of poverty and social isolation. Some say that whenever the media of New York needed to find some example of urban despair, they traveled to Newark.\n\nIn ''[[American Pastoral]]'', the 1997 novel by Newark-born author [[Philip Roth]], the protagonist Swede Levov says:\n{{cquote|Newark used to be the city where they manufactured everything, now it's the car theft capital of the world ... there was a factory where somebody was making something on every side street. Now there's a liquor store on every street \u2014 a liquor store, a pizza stand, and a seedy storefront church. Everything else is in ruins or boarded up.}}\n\nIn January 1975, an article in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' ranked the 50 largest American cities in 24 categories, ranging from park space to crime. Newark was one of the five worst in 19 out of 24 categories, and the very worst in nine. According to the article, only 70 percent of residents owned a telephone.  [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], the city ranked second worst, was much farther from Newark than the cities in the top five were from each other. The article concluded:\n\n{{cquote|The city of Newark stands without serious challenge as the worst city of all. It ranked among the worst cities in no fewer than nineteen of twenty-four categories, and it was dead last in nine of them... Newark is a city that desperately needs help.<ref>''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'', January 1975</ref>}}\n\nNewark has had several achievements in the two and a half decades since the riots. In 1968, the [[New Community Corporation]] was founded.  It has become one of the most successful [[community development corporation]]s in the nation. By 1987, the NCC owned and managed 2,265 low-income housing units.\n\n[[Image:Newark-broad-street.jpg|thumb|Broad Street from the Prudential Financial Building.]]Newark's downtown began to redevelop in the post-riot decades. Less than two weeks after the riots, Prudential announced plans to underwrite a $24 million office complex near [[Pennsylvania Station (Newark)|Penn Station]], dubbed \"Gateway.\" Today, Gateway houses thousands of white-collar workers, though few live in Newark.<ref>[http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=103094 Grant USA Tower], accessed, October 30, 2006</ref>\n\nBefore the riots, the [[University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey]] was considering building in the suburbs. The riots and Newark's undeniable desperation kept the medical school in the city.   However, instead of being built on 167 acres (676,000&nbsp;m\u00b2), the medical school was built on just {{convert|60|acre|m2}}, part of which was already city owned.  Students at the medical school soon started the \"Student Family Health Clinic\" to provide free health care for the underserved population, along with other community service projects.  It continues to operate today as one of the nation's oldest student-run free health clinics.\n\nIn 1970, [[Kenneth A. Gibson]] was the first African-American to be elected mayor of Newark, as well as to be elected mayor of a major northeastern city. The 1970s were a time of battles between Gibson and the shrinking white population.  Gibson admitted that \"Newark may be the most decayed and financially crippled city in the nation.\"  He and the city council raised taxes to try to improve services such as schools and sanitation, but they did nothing for Newark's economic base.  The CEO of Ballantine's Brewery asserted that Newark's $1 million annual tax bill was the cause of the company's bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite book| author=Cunningham, John T. | title=Newark |publisher= New Jersey Historical Society | year=1989 | isbn=0-911020-18-7 }}, p.339.</ref>\n\nPrior to the election of former Mayor [[Cory Booker]] in 2006, Newark did not have a formal city planning department. As a result, a fellow at the [[Manhattan Institute for Policy Research]] concluded:\n\n{{cquote|\u201cNewark is a living laboratory for nearly every bad planning idea of the 20th century.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/confidence-man-cory-booker-profile|title=From the Archives: \u2018Confidence Man,\u2019 Next City\u2019s 2009 Profile of Cory Booker|website=nextcity.org|date=August 14, 2013|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref>}}\n\n==Newark's Renaissance==\n\n===Downtown===\n[[File:Newark NJPAC adj.jpg|thumb|The New Jersey Performing Arts Center]]\n\nThe [[New Jersey Performing Arts Center]], which opened in the downtown area in 1997 at a cost of $180 million, was seen by many as the first step in the city's road to revival, and brought in people to Newark who otherwise might never have visited. NJPAC is known for its acoustics, and features the [[New Jersey Symphony Orchestra]] as its resident orchestra. NJPAC also presents a diverse group of visiting artists such as [[Itzhak Perlman]], [[Sarah Brightman]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [['N Sync]], [[Lauryn Hill]], the [[Vienna Boys' Choir]], [[Yo Yo Ma]], the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]] of [[Amsterdam]], and the [[Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]].<ref>[http://www.njpac.org/load_screen.asp?screen=history History of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324055716/http://www.njpac.org/load_screen.asp?screen=history# |date=2009-03-24 }}, accessed, March 23, 2007</ref>\n\nSince then, the city has built a [[baseball]] stadium ([[Bears & Eagles Riverfront Stadium|Riverfront Stadium]]) for the [[Newark Bears]], the city's [[minor league]] team. In 2007, the [[Prudential Center]] (nicknamed, \"The Rock\") opened for the [[New Jersey Devils]].  The Passaic River waterfront is being refurbished through downtown to provide citizens with access to the river. The [[Newark Public Library]] is planning a major renovation and expansion.  The Port Authority constructed a rail connection to the airport ([[AirTrain Newark]]).  Numerous commercial developments have arisen in the downtown area.\n\nWhile much of the city's revitalization efforts have been focused in the downtown area, adjoining neighborhoods have in recent years begun to see some signs of development, particularly in the Central Ward. Since 2000, Newark has gained population, its first increase since the 1940s.  Nevertheless, the \"Renaissance\" has been unevenly felt across the city and some districts continue to have below-average household incomes and higher-than-average rates of poverty.\n\nBy the mid-first decade of the 21st century, the rate of crime had fallen by 58% from historic highs associated with severe drug problems in the mid-1990s, though murders remained high for a city of its size. {{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}  In the first two months of 2008, the murder rate dropped dramatically, with no murders recorded for 43 days.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\nNewark's nicknames reflect the efforts to revitalize downtown.  In the 1950s the term '''New Newark''' was given to the city by then-Mayor Leo Carlin to help convince major corporations to remain in Newark.  In the 1960s Newark was nicknamed the '''Gateway City''' after the redeveloped Gateway Center area downtown, which shares its name with the [[tourism region]] of which Newark is a part, the [[Gateway Region]]. It has more recently been called the '''Renaissance City''' by the media and the public to gain recognition for its revitalization efforts.<ref>[http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/index.ssf?/news/ledger/stories/120805_cummings.html Revitalization Efforts], accessed, March 23, 2007</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of Newark, New Jersey]]\n* [[Sports in Newark, New Jersey]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Further reading'''\n{{see also|Timeline of Newark, New Jersey#Bibliography}}\n* {{Citation |publisher = The Office of the Newark Daily Advertiser |location = Newark, N.J |title = Directory of Newark, for 1835-6 |date = 1835 |ol = 23673568M }}\n* {{Citation |publisher = Pierson |location = Newark, N.J |title = Directory of the city of Newark, for 1838-9 |date = 1838 |ol = 23295513M }}\n* {{Citation |publisher = Holbrook's Steam Press |location = Newark, N.J |author = B.

In 1984, the [[Israeli Central Elections Committee]] banned him from being a candidate on the grounds that Kach was a racist party, but the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] overturned the ban on the grounds that the committee was not authorized to ban Kahane's candidacy.<ref>Israel Court Drops Ban on 2 Political Parties, New York Times, June 29, 1984, p. 3</ref> The Supreme Court suggested that the Knesset pass a law excluding racist parties from future elections. The Knesset responded in 1985 by amending the \"Basic Law:Knesset\" to include a prohibition (paragraph 7a) against registration of parties that explicitly or implicitly incite racism.\n\n=== Election to Knesset ===\nIn the [[1984 Israeli legislative election|1984 legislative elections]], Kahane's Kach party received 25,907 votes, gaining one seat in the Knesset, which was taken by Kahane. He refused to take the standard [[oath of office]] and insisted on adding a Biblical verse from [[Psalms]] to indicate that national laws were overruled by the [[Torah]] if they conflict. Kahane's legislative proposals focused on Jewish education, an open economy, transferring the Arab population out of the [[Land of Israel]], revoking Israeli citizenship from non-Jews, and banning Jewish-Gentile marriages and sexual relations. \n\nWhile his popularity in Israel grew, Kahane was boycotted in the Knesset, where his speeches were often made to an assembly that was empty except for the duty chairman and the transcriptionist. Kahane's legislative proposals and motions of no-confidence against the government were ignored or rejected. Kahane often pejoratively called other Knesset members \"[[Hellenistic|Hellenists]], a reference to Jews who assimilated into [[Greek culture]] after [[Judea]]'s occupation by [[Alexander the Great]]. In 1987, Kahane opened a [[yeshiva]] (\"HaRaayon HaYehudi\") with funding from US supporters to teach \"the Authentic Jewish Idea\". Despite the boycott, his popularity grew among the Israeli public, especially for working-class [[Sephardi Jews]].<ref name=\"cut down\">[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20113657,00.html After a Career of Preaching Hatred for Arabs, Rabbi Meir Kahane Is Cut Down by An Assassin's Bullet] People Magazine</ref> Polls showed that Kach would have likely received anywhere from four to twelve seats in the coming November 1988 elections.<ref>[http://www.washington-report.org/backissues/0799/9907081.html Jewish Defense League Unleashes Campaign of Violence in America] New York Times, October 17, 1988</ref><ref>{{Google books |id=6iHOrDQghpcC |page=196 |title=Jew vs. Jew: the struggle for the soul of American Jewry }}, Samuel G.

The Central Elections Committee banned Kahane a second time, and he appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court. However, the Supreme Court this time ruled in favor of the committee, disqualifying Kach from running in the [[1988 Israeli legislative election|1988 legislative elections]]. Kahane was thus the first candidate in Israel to be barred from election for racism. The move was criticized as being anti-democratic by [[Alan M.

As a result of this legislation, Kahane renounced his United States citizenship. Following his banning from the Knesset, he tried to get his U.S. citizenship reinstated on the basis of the fact that he was compelled to relinquish it by the Knesset. It was not reinstated, but he was permitted to continue traveling to the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/immigrationlaw/chapter12.html |title=Concepts of Citizenship  |author=Weissbrodt, David and Danielson, Laura |date=2004 |website=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library  |publisher= |access-date=July 28, 2019|quote=Kahane was a U.S. citizen at birth.

Kahane, aware of the fact that accepting an office under a foreign government was an expatriating act listed in INA 349 (a)(4), communicated on several occasions with the State Department that he did not intend to give up his U.S. citizenship. The State Department nonetheless claimed that Kahane committed the expatriating act by shifting his allegiance to Israel. The court rejected this argument because an actor who contemporaneously with the expatriating act declares his intent to stay a U.S. citizen automatically preserves his citizenship. Kahane v. Shultz (E.D.N.Y.1987). One year later, the Israeli Parliament passed a law providing that its members could only be Israeli citizens. Kahane executed a formal oath of renunciation of his U.S. citizenship to remain eligible for a seat in the Parliament. After Kahane's party was barred, on different grounds, from running in the elections, Kahane tried to revoke his renunciation of U.S. citizenship claiming that the Israeli law compelled his act.

The objective of Judaism is to serve God and to make people better. These are two totally opposite conceptions of life.\"{{cite web|url=http://kahane.org/meir/interview.htm |title=God's Law: an Interview with Rabbi Meir Kahane |accessdate=December 18, 2012 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219141224/http://kahane.org/meir/interview.htm |archivedate=February 19, 2009}}</ref> Kahane also stressed the view that a Jewish state and a Western democracy were incompatible, since Western democracy is religion-blind, and a Jewish state is religion-oriented by its very name. He also warned of the danger of non-Jewish citizens becoming a majority and voting against the Jewish character of the state: \"The question is as follows: if the Arabs settle among us and make enough children to become a majority, will Israel continue to be a Jewish state? Do we have to accept that the Arab majority will decide?\"<ref name=\"kahane.org\">Kahane.org</ref> \"Western democracy has to be ruled out. For me, that's cut and dried: There's no question of setting up democracy in Israel, because democracy means equal rights for all, irrespective of racial or religious origins.\"\n\nKahane proposed an \"[[population transfer|exchange of populations]]\" that would continue the [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]]: \"A total of some 750,000 Jews fled Arab lands since 1948. Surely it is time for Jews, worried over the huge growth of Arabs in Israel, to consider finishing the exchange of populations that began 35 years ago.\" Kahane proposed a $40,000 compensation plan for Arabs who would leave voluntarily, and forcible expulsion for those who \"don't want to leave\".<ref name=\"kahane.org\"/> He encouraged retaliatory violence against Arabs who attacked Jews: \"I approve of anybody who commits such acts of violence. Really, I don't think that we can sit back and watch Arabs throwing rocks at buses whenever they feel like it. They must understand that a bomb thrown at a Jewish bus is going to mean a bomb thrown at an Arab bus.\"<ref name=\"kahane.org\"/>\n\nIn some of his writings, Kahane argued that Israel should never start a war for territory but that if a war were launched against Israel, Biblical territory should be annexed.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kahane|first1=Meir|title=Palestine?|url=http://mkwords.com/text/?i=86&a=Palestine|website=mkwords.com|date=1974|quote=If there are those who wish to create something known as 'Palestine' they are welcome to do so in 'Jordan' which in itself is a fictitious state created by the imperialist British by cutting away, in 1921, the eastern part of the Land of Israel. The Arabs who call themselves 'Palestinians' had the opportunity to create a 'Palestine' in a far larger part of the Land of Israel, but refused to do so. They lost that chance forever and if they refuse to create a state in 'Jordan' now, but insist upon war, they will lose again and lose 'Jordan' in the process because - while we will never begin a war for those parts of the [[Land of Israel]] now under foreign rule, should the Arabs begin that war, and we liberate still other areas of the Land of Israel, then those will never be given up either.}}</ref> However, in an interview, he defined Israel's \"minimal borders\" as follows: \"The southern boundary goes up to El Arish, which takes in all of northern [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], including [[Yamit]]. To the east, the frontier runs along the western part of the East Bank of the [[River Jordan|Jordan River]], hence part of what is now Jordan. [[Land of Israel|Eretz Yisrael]] also includes part of Lebanon and certain parts of Syria, and part of Iraq, all the way to the [[Euphrates River]].\"<ref name=\"kahane.org\"/> When critics suggested that following Kahane's plans would mean a perpetual war between Jews and Arabs, Kahane responded, \"There will be a perpetual war.

Eliyahu wrote an approbation to Kahane's [[Tanakh]] commentary, \"Perush Hamacabee\", where he refers to Kahane as \"HaRav HaGaon\" (\"the rabbinic genius\"), a praiseworthy title attributed to the very saintly. Eliyahu wrote, \"Only the Torah way interested Kahane, which he constantly toiled over and which served as his strength... When one considers the depth and clarity of [Kahane's] works, one is astonished at how he had the time to compile such.

Kahane's legislative proposals and motions of no-confidence against the government were ignored or rejected. Kahane often pejoratively called other Knesset members \"[[Hellenistic|Hellenists]], a reference to Jews who assimilated into [[Greek culture]] after [[Judea]]'s occupation by [[Alexander the Great]]. In 1987, Kahane opened a [[yeshiva]] (\"HaRaayon HaYehudi\") with funding from US supporters to teach \"the Authentic Jewish Idea\". Despite the boycott, his popularity grew among the Israeli public, especially for working-class [[Sephardi Jews]].<ref name=\"cut down\">[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20113657,00.html After a Career of Preaching Hatred for Arabs, Rabbi Meir Kahane Is Cut Down by An Assassin's Bullet] People Magazine</ref> Polls showed that Kach would have likely received anywhere from four to twelve seats in the coming November 1988 elections.<ref>[http://www.washington-report.org/backissues/0799/9907081.html Jewish Defense League Unleashes Campaign of Violence in America] New York Times, October 17, 1988</ref><ref>{{Google books |id=6iHOrDQghpcC |page=196 |title=Jew vs. Jew: the struggle for the soul of American Jewry }}, Samuel G.

The Central Elections Committee banned Kahane a second time, and he appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court. However, the Supreme Court this time ruled in favor of the committee, disqualifying Kach from running in the [[1988 Israeli legislative election|1988 legislative elections]]. Kahane was thus the first candidate in Israel to be barred from election for racism. The move was criticized as being anti-democratic by [[Alan M.

As a result of this legislation, Kahane renounced his United States citizenship. Following his banning from the Knesset, he tried to get his U.S. citizenship reinstated on the basis of the fact that he was compelled to relinquish it by the Knesset. It was not reinstated, but he was permitted to continue traveling to the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/immigrationlaw/chapter12.html |title=Concepts of Citizenship  |author=Weissbrodt, David and Danielson, Laura |date=2004 |website=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library  |publisher= |access-date=July 28, 2019|quote=Kahane was a U.S. citizen at birth. He moved to Israel where he became active in politics and was elected to the Israeli Parliament. Kahane, aware of the fact that accepting an office under a foreign government was an expatriating act listed in INA 349 (a)(4), communicated on several occasions with the State Department that he did not intend to give up his U.S. citizenship. The State Department nonetheless claimed that Kahane committed the expatriating act by shifting his allegiance to Israel. The court rejected this argument because an actor who contemporaneously with the expatriating act declares his intent to stay a U.S. citizen automatically preserves his citizenship. Kahane v. Shultz (E.D.N.Y.1987). One year later, the Israeli Parliament passed a law providing that its members could only be Israeli citizens. Kahane executed a formal oath of renunciation of his U.S. citizenship to remain eligible for a seat in the Parliament. After Kahane's party was barred, on different grounds, from running in the elections, Kahane tried to revoke his renunciation of U.S. citizenship claiming that the Israeli law compelled his act. The court ruled against Kahane, who remained expatriated, although he was permitted to visit the United States and was eventually assassinated in New York City. Kahane v.

He also noted, \"[[Democracy]] and [[Judaism]] are not the same thing.\"<ref>\"One absolutely cannot confuse them. The objective of a democratic state is to allow a person to do exactly as he wishes.

He also warned of the danger of non-Jewish citizens becoming a majority and voting against the Jewish character of the state: \"The question is as follows: if the Arabs settle among us and make enough children to become a majority, will Israel continue to be a Jewish state? Do we have to accept that the Arab majority will decide?\"<ref name=\"kahane.org\">Kahane.org</ref> \"Western democracy has to be ruled out. For me, that's cut and dried: There's no question of setting up democracy in Israel, because democracy means equal rights for all, irrespective of racial or religious origins.\"\n\nKahane proposed an \"[[population transfer|exchange of populations]]\" that would continue the [[Jewish exodus from Arab lands]]: \"A total of some 750,000 Jews fled Arab lands since 1948. Surely it is time for Jews, worried over the huge growth of Arabs in Israel, to consider finishing the exchange of populations that began 35 years ago.\" Kahane proposed a $40,000 compensation plan for Arabs who would leave voluntarily, and forcible expulsion for those who \"don't want to leave\".<ref name=\"kahane.org\"/> He encouraged retaliatory violence against Arabs who attacked Jews: \"I approve of anybody who commits such acts of violence. Really, I don't think that we can sit back and watch Arabs throwing rocks at buses whenever they feel like it. They must understand that a bomb thrown at a Jewish bus is going to mean a bomb thrown at an Arab bus.\"<ref name=\"kahane.org\"/>\n\nIn some of his writings, Kahane argued that Israel should never start a war for territory but that if a war were launched against Israel, Biblical territory should be annexed.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kahane|first1=Meir|title=Palestine?|url=http://mkwords.com/text/?i=86&a=Palestine|website=mkwords.com|date=1974|quote=If there are those who wish to create something known as 'Palestine' they are welcome to do so in 'Jordan' which in itself is a fictitious state created by the imperialist British by cutting away, in 1921, the eastern part of the Land of Israel.

They lost that chance forever and if they refuse to create a state in 'Jordan' now, but insist upon war, they will lose again and lose 'Jordan' in the process because - while we will never begin a war for those parts of the [[Land of Israel]] now under foreign rule, should the Arabs begin that war, and we liberate still other areas of the Land of Israel, then those will never be given up either.}}</ref> However, in an interview, he defined Israel's \"minimal borders\" as follows: \"The southern boundary goes up to El Arish, which takes in all of northern [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]], including [[Yamit]].

McLaren is best known as a [[Formula One]] [[List of Formula One constructors|constructor]] and also has a history of competing in [[American open wheel racing]] as both an entrant and a chassis constructor, and has won the [[Can-Am|Canadian-American Challenge Cup]] (Can-Am) [[sports car racing]] championship. The team is the second oldest active, and second most successful Formula One team after [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], having won 182 races, 12 Drivers' Championships and eight Constructors' Championships. The team is a wholly owned subsidiary of the [[McLaren Group]].\n\nFounded in 1963 by New Zealander [[Bruce McLaren]], the team won its first Grand Prix at the [[1968 Belgian Grand Prix]], but their greatest initial success was in Can-Am, which they dominated from 1967 to 1971. Further American triumph followed, with Indianapolis 500 wins in McLaren cars for [[Mark Donohue]] in [[1972 Indianapolis 500|1972]] and [[Johnny Rutherford]] in [[1974 Indianapolis 500|1974]] and [[1976 Indianapolis 500|1976]]. After Bruce McLaren died in a testing accident in 1970, [[Teddy Mayer]] took over and led the team to their first Formula One Constructors' Championship in {{F1|1974}}, with [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] and [[James Hunt]] winning the Drivers' Championship in 1974 and {{F1|1976}} respectively. The year 1974 also marked the start of a long-standing sponsorship by [[Altria Group|Phillip Morris]]' [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] cigarette brand.\n\nIn 1981, McLaren merged with [[Ron Dennis]]' [[Project Four Racing]]; Dennis took over as team principal and shortly after organised a buyout of the original McLaren shareholders to take full control of the team. This began the team's most successful era: with [[Porsche in motorsport|Porsche]] and [[Honda in Formula One|Honda]] engines, [[Niki Lauda]], [[Alain Prost]], and [[Ayrton Senna]] took between them seven Drivers' Championships and the team took six Constructors' Championships. The combination of Prost and Senna was particularly dominant\u2014together they won all but one race in {{F1|1988}}\u2014but later their rivalry soured and Prost left for [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]. Fellow English team [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] offered the most consistent challenge during this period, the two winning every constructors' title between {{F1|1984}} and {{F1|1994}}. However, by the mid-1990s, Honda had withdrawn from Formula One, Senna had moved to Williams, and the team went three seasons without a win. With [[Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains|Mercedes-Benz]] engines, [[West (cigarette)|West]] sponsorship, and former Williams designer [[Adrian Newey]], further championships came in {{F1|1998}} and {{F1|1999}} with driver [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]], and during the 2000s the team were consistent front-runners, driver [[Lewis Hamilton]] taking their latest title in {{F1|2008}}.\n\nRon Dennis retired as McLaren team principal in 2009, handing over to long time McLaren employee [[Martin Whitmarsh]]. However, at the end of 2013, after the team's worst season since 2004, Whitmarsh was ousted. McLaren announced in 2013 that they would be using [[Honda in Formula One|Honda]] engines from 2015 onwards, replacing [[Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains|Mercedes-Benz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/21655985|title=McLaren poised to switch to Honda engines for 2015 season|date=4 March 2013|last=Benson|first=Andrew|publisher=BBC|access-date=7 January 2020}}</ref> The team raced as McLaren Honda for the first time since 1992 at the [[2015 Australian Grand Prix]]. In September 2017, McLaren announced they had agreed on an engine supply with [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] from 2018 to 2020.

The car was raced in North America and Europe in 1963 and 1964 in various G7 and United States Road Racing Championship events. For the Can-Am Series, which started in 1966, McLaren created the M3 which Bruce and [[Chris Amon]] drove&nbsp;\u2013 customer cars also appeared in a number of races in the [[1966 Can-Am season|1966 season]]. With the M3, they led two races, but scored no wins, and the inaugural title was taken by John Surtees in a Lola T70. The following year, Robin Herd purpose-designed the [[Chevrolet]] V8-powered [[McLaren M6A|M6A]], delays with the Formula One programme allowing the team to spend extra resources on developing the Can-Am car which was the first to be painted in McLaren orange. With Denny Hulme now partnering Bruce, they won five of six races and Bruce won the championship, setting the pattern for the next four years. In [[1968 Can-Am season|1968]], they used a new car, the M8, to win four races; non-works McLarens took the other two, but this time Hulme was victorious overall. In [[1969 Can-Am season|1969]], McLaren domination became total as they won all 11 races with the M8B; Hulme won five, and Bruce won six and the Drivers' Championship.<ref name=\"clockworkorange\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bruce-mclaren.com/the-racing-team/articles/clockwork-orange-mclaren-domination.html |title=\nClockwork Orange&nbsp;\u2013 McLaren Domination |first=Mark |last=Hughes |authorlink=Mark Hughes (journalist)| work=Bruce McLaren Trust |accessdate=8 April 2010}}</ref> From 1969 onwards, McLaren M12&nbsp;\u2013 the customer \"variant\" of the M8&nbsp;\u2013 was driven by a number of entrants, including a version modified by Jim Hall of Chaparral fame.

McLaren is best known as a [[Formula One]] [[List of Formula One constructors|constructor]] and also has a history of competing in [[American open wheel racing]] as both an entrant and a chassis constructor, and has won the [[Can-Am|Canadian-American Challenge Cup]] (Can-Am) [[sports car racing]] championship. The team is the second oldest active, and second most successful Formula One team after [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], having won 182 races, 12 Drivers' Championships and eight Constructors' Championships. The team is a wholly owned subsidiary of the [[McLaren Group]].\n\nFounded in 1963 by New Zealander [[Bruce McLaren]], the team won its first Grand Prix at the [[1968 Belgian Grand Prix]], but their greatest initial success was in Can-Am, which they dominated from 1967 to 1971. Further American triumph followed, with Indianapolis 500 wins in McLaren cars for [[Mark Donohue]] in [[1972 Indianapolis 500|1972]] and [[Johnny Rutherford]] in [[1974 Indianapolis 500|1974]] and [[1976 Indianapolis 500|1976]]. After Bruce McLaren died in a testing accident in 1970, [[Teddy Mayer]] took over and led the team to their first Formula One Constructors' Championship in {{F1|1974}}, with [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] and [[James Hunt]] winning the Drivers' Championship in 1974 and {{F1|1976}} respectively. The year 1974 also marked the start of a long-standing sponsorship by [[Altria Group|Phillip Morris]]' [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] cigarette brand.\n\nIn 1981, McLaren merged with [[Ron Dennis]]' [[Project Four Racing]]; Dennis took over as team principal and shortly after organised a buyout of the original McLaren shareholders to take full control of the team. This began the team's most successful era: with [[Porsche in motorsport|Porsche]] and [[Honda in Formula One|Honda]] engines, [[Niki Lauda]], [[Alain Prost]], and [[Ayrton Senna]] took between them seven Drivers' Championships and the team took six Constructors' Championships. The combination of Prost and Senna was particularly dominant\u2014together they won all but one race in {{F1|1988}}\u2014but later their rivalry soured and Prost left for [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]]. Fellow English team [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] offered the most consistent challenge during this period, the two winning every constructors' title between {{F1|1984}} and {{F1|1994}}. However, by the mid-1990s, Honda had withdrawn from Formula One, Senna had moved to Williams, and the team went three seasons without a win. With [[Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains|Mercedes-Benz]] engines, [[West (cigarette)|West]] sponsorship, and former Williams designer [[Adrian Newey]], further championships came in {{F1|1998}} and {{F1|1999}} with driver [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]], and during the 2000s the team were consistent front-runners, driver [[Lewis Hamilton]] taking their latest title in {{F1|2008}}.\n\nRon Dennis retired as McLaren team principal in 2009, handing over to long time McLaren employee [[Martin Whitmarsh]]. However, at the end of 2013, after the team's worst season since 2004, Whitmarsh was ousted.

The second year of the renewed Honda partnership was much more promising than the first with the team being able to challenge for top 10 positions on a more regular basis. However, the season started with a massive crash at the [[2016 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]] in which [[Fernando Alonso]] sustained rib fractures and a [[collapsed lung]] after colliding with [[Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez]] and somersaulting into the crash barriers. Alonso, as a result of his injuries, was forced to miss the second round of the Championship, the [[2016 Bahrain Grand Prix|Bahrain Grand Prix]], and was replaced by reserve driver [[Stoffel Vandoorne]]. Vandoorne produced an impressive performance in his first race to score the team's first point of the season with 10th place. The next points for McLaren came at the [[2016 Russian Grand Prix|Russian Grand Prix]] with Alonso and Button finishing sixth and 10th respectively. The rain affected [[2016 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]] was one of best races of the season for the team. Alonso finished fifth, having kept [[Nico Rosberg]]'s Mercedes behind him for 46 laps, while Button scored two points with ninth. At the [[2016 Austrian Grand Prix|Austrian Grand Prix]], Button recorded his best result of the season with sixth place after qualifying third in a wet/dry session. After a disappointing display at their home race, the [[2016 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]] at Silverstone, the team scored points at the next three rounds with six points in Hungary, four in Germany and six points again thanks to an impressive seventh-place finish from Alonso at the [[2016 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]]. At the [[2016 United States Grand Prix|United States Grand Prix]], McLaren matched their Monaco result with 12 points after an attacking race from Alonso saw him claim fifth position while Button once again finished ninth. After a season of significant progress compared to 2015, Alonso and Button finished the championship in 10th and 15th places respectively with the team ending the season in sixth place in the Constructors' Championship with 76 points. On 3 September 2016, [[Jenson Button]] announced he would take a sabbatical from Formula One for the 2017 season.

The car was raced in North America and Europe in 1963 and 1964 in various G7 and United States Road Racing Championship events.

With the M3, they led two races, but scored no wins, and the inaugural title was taken by John Surtees in a Lola T70. The following year, Robin Herd purpose-designed the [[Chevrolet]] V8-powered [[McLaren M6A|M6A]], delays with the Formula One programme allowing the team to spend extra resources on developing the Can-Am car which was the first to be painted in McLaren orange. With Denny Hulme now partnering Bruce, they won five of six races and Bruce won the championship, setting the pattern for the next four years. In [[1968 Can-Am season|1968]], they used a new car, the M8, to win four races; non-works McLarens took the other two, but this time Hulme was victorious overall. In [[1969 Can-Am season|1969]], McLaren domination became total as they won all 11 races with the M8B; Hulme won five, and Bruce won six and the Drivers' Championship.<ref name=\"clockworkorange\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bruce-mclaren.com/the-racing-team/articles/clockwork-orange-mclaren-domination.html |title=\nClockwork Orange&nbsp;\u2013 McLaren Domination |first=Mark |last=Hughes |authorlink=Mark Hughes (journalist)| work=Bruce McLaren Trust |accessdate=8 April 2010}}</ref> From 1969 onwards, McLaren M12&nbsp;\u2013 the customer \"variant\" of the M8&nbsp;\u2013 was driven by a number of entrants, including a version modified by Jim Hall of Chaparral fame.

Dress codes are created out of social perceptions and norms, and vary based on purpose, circumstances, and occasions. Different societies and cultures are likely to have different dress codes, [[Western dress codes]] being a prominent example.\n\nDress codes are symbolic indications of different social ideas, including [[social class]], [[cultural identity]], [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]] towards comfort, tradition, and political or religious affiliations.\n\n==History==\n\n===Europe===\n\n{{See also|Western dress codes|Sumptuary laws|English medieval clothing}}In seventh through the ninth centuries, the [[:Category:European nobility|European royalty and nobility]] used a dress code to differentiate themselves from other classes of people. All classes generally wore the same clothing, although distinctions among the social hierarchy began to become more noticeable through ornamented garments. Common pieces of clothing worn by peasants and the working class included plain tunics, cloaks, [[Jacket|jackets]], pants, and shoes. According to rank, embellishments adorned the collar of the tunic, waist or border. Examples of these decorations included, as [[James Planch\u00e9]] states, \u201cgold and silver chains and crosses, bracelets of gold, silver or ivory, golden and jeweled belts, strings of amber and other beads, rings, brooches, [and] buckles\u201d.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=|title=History of British Medieval Costume: From the Earliest Period to the Close of the Eighteenth Century.
