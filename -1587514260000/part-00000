Roosevelt controlled American politics for most of the next three decades, excepting the two-term presidency of Republican [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. Blacks moved into the Democratic Party during the [[New Deal]] era. After Roosevelt took office in 1933, New Deal legislation sailed through Congress and the economy moved sharply upward from its nadir in early 1933. However, long-term unemployment remained a drag until 1940. In the 1934 midterm elections, 10 Republican senators went down to defeat, leaving the GOP with only 25 senators against 71 Democrats. The House of Representatives likewise had overwhelming Democratic majorities.<ref>Lewis Gould, ''Grand Old Party: A History of the Republicans '' (2003) pp 271-308.</ref>\n\nThe Republican Party factionalized into a majority \"Old Right\" (based in the Midwest) and a liberal wing based in the Northeast that supported much of the New Deal. The Old Right sharply attacked the \"Second New Deal\" and said it represented class warfare and socialism. Roosevelt was re-elected in a landslide in 1936; however, as his second term began, the economy declined, strikes soared, and he failed to take control of the Supreme Court or to purge the Southern conservatives from the Democratic Party. Republicans made a major comeback in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1938|1938 elections]] and had new rising stars such as [[Robert A. Taft]] of Ohio on the right and [[Thomas E. Dewey]] of New York on the left.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uncpress.org/book/9781469618968/the-roots-of-modern-conservatism|title=The Roots of Modern Conservatism {{!}} Michael Bowen|website=University of North Carolina Press|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522220118/https://www.uncpress.org/book/9781469618968/the-roots-of-modern-conservatism/|archive-date=May 22, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Southern conservatives joined with most Republicans to form the [[conservative coalition]], which dominated domestic issues in Congress until 1964.

Roosevelt won a third and fourth term in 1940 and 1944, respectively.

Nash]] argues: <blockquote>Unlike the \"moderate\", internationalist, largely eastern bloc of Republicans who accepted (or at least acquiesced in) some of the \"Roosevelt Revolution\" and the essential premises of President Truman's foreign policy, the Republican Right at heart was counterrevolutionary. Anti-collectivist, anti-Communist, anti-New Deal, passionately committed to limited government, free market economics, and congressional (as opposed to executive) prerogatives, the G.O.P. conservatives were obliged from the start to wage a constant two-front war: against liberal Democrats from without and \"me-too\" Republicans from within.<ref>Quote on p. 261 {{cite journal |jstor = 2702450|title = The Republican Right from Taft to Reagan|last1 = Nash|first1 = George H.|last2 = Reinhard|first2 = David W.|journal = Reviews in American History|volume = 12|issue = 2|pages = 261\u2013265|year = 1984|doi = 10.2307/2702450}} Nash references David W.

However, research has indicated that voter fraud is very uncommon, as civil and voting rights organizations often accuse Republicans of enacting restrictions to influence elections in the party's favor. Many laws or regulations restricting voting enacted by Republicans have been successfully challenged in court, with court rulings striking down such regulations and accusing Republicans of

They argue that Gingrich instilled a \"combative\" approach in the Republican Party, where hateful language and hyper-partisanship became commonplace, and where democratic norms were abandoned.

Republicans, mainly at the state level, argue that the restrictions (such as purging voter rolls, limiting voting locations and prosecuting double voting) are vital to prevent [[voter fraud]], claiming that voter fraud is an underestimated issue in elections. However, research has indicated that voter fraud is very uncommon, as civil and voting rights organizations often accuse Republicans of enacting restrictions to influence elections in the party's favor. Many laws or regulations restricting voting enacted by Republicans have been successfully challenged in court, with court rulings striking down such regulations and accusing Republicans of

They argue that Gingrich instilled a \"combative\" approach in the Republican Party, where hateful language and hyper-partisanship became commonplace, and where democratic norms were abandoned. Gingrich frequently questioned the [[patriotism]] of Democrats, called them corrupt, compared them to fascists, and accused them of wanting to destroy the United States. Gingrich was also involved in several major government shutdowns.<ref name=\"How Democracies Die\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/145916/democracy-dies-donald-trump-contempt-for-american-political-institutions|title=How a Democracy Dies|work=The New Republic|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181211105538/https://newrepublic.com/article/145916/democracy-dies-donald-trump-contempt-for-american-political-institutions|archive-date=December 11, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/01/22/579670528/how-democracies-die-authors-say-trump-is-a-symptom-of-deeper-problems|title='How Democracies Die' Authors Say Trump Is A Symptom Of 'Deeper Problems'|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181208011203/https://www.npr.org/2018/01/22/579670528/how-democracies-die-authors-say-trump-is-a-symptom-of-deeper-problems|archive-date=December 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/01/the-rising-pressures-on-american-democracy/|title=The rising pressures on American democracy|date=2018-01-29|work=Harvard Gazette|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130201624/https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/01/the-rising-pressures-on-american-democracy/|archive-date=November 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nScholars have also characterized Mitch McConnell's tenure as Senate Minority Leader and Senate Majority Leader during the Obama presidency as one where obstructionism reached all-time highs.<ref name=\"The Senate Syndrome: The Evolution of Procedural Warfare in the Modern U.S. Senate\">{{Cite book|title=The Senate Syndrome: The Evolution of Procedural Warfare in the Modern U.S. Senate|last=Smith|first=Steven|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|page=287}}</ref> Political scientists have referred to McConnell's use of the filibuster as \"constitutional hardball\", referring to the misuse of procedural tools in a way that undermines democracy.<ref name=\"Glassman 2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/12/11/wisconsins-and-michigans-legislatures-are-trying-to-weaken-incoming-governors-should-you-be-worried/|title=Republicans in Wisconsin and Michigan want to weaken incoming Democratic governors.
