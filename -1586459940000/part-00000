Their mission lasted from 15 July 2003 to 1 December 2006.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Esercito Italiano: Operazione Antica Babilonia| access-date = 2017-10-16| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070204043340/http://www.esercito.difesa.it/root/attivita/mix_babilonia.asp|archive-date=4 February 2007|url=http://www.esercito.difesa.it/root/attivita/mix_babilonia.asp}}</ref> The troops were located in and around [[Nasiriyah]].\n\nItaly lost 36 soldiers during the mission, most of them in the [[2003 Nasiriyah bombing]] against the [[Carabinieri]] [[Multinational Specialized Unit]] base.\n\n== Italian intervention ==\nIn March 2003, Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), or second Gulf War, began by a coalition composed mainly of British and US armies and other States. On 1 May 2003, the war is officially over, even though in fact foreign armies have never had full control of the territory, suffering serious losses inflicted by the Iraqi resistance and by terrorist attacks.\n\nUN Resolution 1483 of 22 May 2003 approved by the United Nations Security Council calls on all states to contribute to the rebirth of Iraq, fostering the security of the Iraqi people and the development of the nation.\n\nItaly participates through the \"Ancient Babylon\" mission by providing armed forces in the south of the country, with a main base in Nassiriya.\n\nOn 15 April 2003 the Chambers, through the approval of resolutions, authorized the Government to carry out a military mission in Iraq (called Ancient Babylon) for humanitarian purposes. The parliamentary authorization intervened even before the adoption of Resolution 1483 and in a phase in which the difficulty of control of the territory by the occupying authorities and the Iraqi authorities had not yet clearly emerged.\n\nThe Italian mission began on 15 July 2003 and is a military operation for the purposes of peacekeeping (maintenance and safeguarding of peace), which has the following objectives:\n\n* reconstruction of the Iraqi \"security sector\" through assistance for training and equipment of forces, at central and local level, both in the context of NATO and bilaterally;\n* creation and maintenance of the necessary security framework;\ncompetition for the restoration of public infrastructures and the reactivation of essential services;\n* radiological, biological and chemical measurements;\ncompetition for public order;\n* military police;\n* airport management contest;\n* competition for reclamation activities, with the use of the dog component;\n* support for ORHA activities;\n* control of the territory and the fight against crime.\n\n== Logistic operations before the battle for the bridges ==\nFollowing the 12 November 2003 attack on the \"Maestrale\" base, the situation in Nassiriya of the Italian peace contingent changed, began to make itself felt more present in the province of Dhi Qar, an act not acceptable to the various hostile factions operating in the area, in the case of the faction of Muqtada al-Sadr and his army of the Mahdi, a group believed to be mainly involved in the attack on the carabinieri at the \"Maestrale\" base.\nAt 4:00 am on 06/04/2004 the Italian land contingent, or three companies of the [[11th Bersaglieri Regiment]], a [[Regiment \"Savoia Cavalleria\" (3rd)]] company and various logistic components of the [[Ariete Armored Brigade]], left the \"White Horse\" complex to go to guard the access bridges to Nassyriya: \"Alpha\", \"Bravo\", \"Charlie\".\nThe units that were involved in this clash fought for 18 hours, the longest firefight that involved Italians since the Second World War, which is why the 11th Bersaglieri Regiment received the war cross for military valor, for the maneuvers carried out on the three bridges in those days of the Ancient Babylon III mission.\n\n== The battle for the bridges ==\nIn Nassiriya, a few months after the attack on 12 November 2003, from 6 April to the end of May 2004, several battles took place between the Italian troops and the Mahdi Army; the Italian military were engaged in the city in several clashes, in which over 30,000 bullets were fired, to control three bridges that allow the passage of the river, in which eleven gunmen were slightly injured; Iraqi casualties were heavy (out of 200), including a woman and two children, and as many injured. In Italy they are known generically as the Battle of the bridges of Nassiriya, even if we refer to three different episodes with clashes between hundreds of Italian soldiers on one side and similar or higher numbers of militiamen on the other; in particular, in the second battle that took place on the night of 6 April, about 500 Italian soldiers and a thousand militiamen were employed <ref name = rivistamilitare>{{cite web | title = Corriere della Sera | date= 8 April 2004 | url = http://www.rivistamilitare.it/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=710&Itemid=3}}</ref>;the objective was originally made up of all three bridges, but given the gathering of women and children among the militiamen on the third bridge, the Italians did not take any action to cross it, remaining to guard only one bank <ref name = rivistamilitare/>. For the occasion, called the Porta Pia operation, various companies from different departments were engaged, including the 11th bersaglieri regiment, a company from the San Marco battalion, a heavy armored squadron Centauro del Savoia cavalry, the GIS carabinieri and the paratroopers (carabinieri, but framed until 2002 in the Folgore Brigade) of the Tuscania regiment <ref name = rivistamilitare/>. During the fight, the Italian military were also targeted with portable anti-tank rockets of which about 400 were counted, to which they responded with about 30,000 shots of small arms and some missiles, as well as some shots of the Centauro armored vehicles <ref name = rivistamilitare/>; observers noted how the militiamen had taken several ambulances from hospitals and used them to transport ammunition to their outposts<ref name = rivistamilitare/> .\n\nThe third battle took place from 5 to 6 August 2004, on the three bridges over the Euphrates, named Alfa, Bravo and Charlie (the first three letters of the NATO phonetic alphabet), to restore access to the city by supplies for the citizenship, forbidden by militiamen; the action was entrusted to a reinforced tactical group of the task force called Serenissima <ref name = icsm-Nassirya>{{cite book|title = Nassirya, la vera storia | author1= Lao Petrilli |author2= Vincenzo Sinapi | publisher = Lindau| url = http://www.icsm.it/libri/rece/nassiryacap5.html}} capitolo 5, Le battaglie dei ponti.</ref>. At the time the Libeccio base, which until the attack hosted the Italian operational presence in the city together with the Mistral base, had already been evacuated, but was re-occupied for the occasion by the 3rd company of the Lagunari who presided over it together with the Alfa bridge despite being targeted by mortar bombs and small arms during the approach <ref name = icsm-Nassirya/>.<ref name = icsm-Nassirya/>. On the Italian side, thermal visors and illuminating grenades were used to precisely identify the starting points of the shots, in full residential area and therefore with risk for the population, together with two Mangusta helicopters that from above provided information and protection.

On May 1, 2003, the war is officially over, even though in fact foreign armies have never had full control of the territory, suffering serious losses inflicted by the Iraqi resistance and by terrorist attacks.\n\nUN Resolution 1483 of 22 May 2003 approved by the United Nations Security Council calls on all states to contribute to the rebirth of Iraq, fostering the security of the Iraqi people and the development of the nation.\n\nItaly participates through the \"Ancient Babylon\" mission by providing armed forces in the south of the country, with a main base in Nassiriya.\n\nOn April 15, 2003 the Chambers, through the approval of resolutions, authorized the Government to carry out a military mission in Iraq (called Ancient Babylon) for humanitarian purposes. The parliamentary authorization intervened even before the adoption of Resolution 1483 and in a phase in which the difficulty of control of the territory by the occupying authorities and the Iraqi authorities had not yet clearly emerged.\n\nThe Italian mission began on July 15, 2003 and is a military operation for the purposes of peacekeeping (maintenance and safeguarding of peace), which has the following objectives:\n\n* reconstruction of the Iraqi \"security sector\" through assistance for training and equipment of forces, at central and local level, both in the context of NATO and bilaterally;\n* creation and maintenance of the necessary security framework;\ncompetition for the restoration of public infrastructures and the reactivation of essential services;\n* radiological, biological and chemical measurements;\ncompetition for public order;\n* military police;\n* airport management contest;\n* competition for reclamation activities, with the use of the dog component;\n* support for ORHA activities;\n* control of the territory and the fight against crime.\n\n== Logistic operations before the battle for the bridges ==\nFollowing the 12 November 2003 attack on the \"Maestrale\" base, the situation in Nassiriya of the Italian peace contingent changed, began to make itself felt more present in the province of Dhi Qar, an act not acceptable to the various hostile factions operating in the area, in the case of the faction of Muqtada al-Sadr and his army of the Mahdi, a group believed to be mainly involved in the attack on the carabinieri at the \"Maestrale\" base.\nAt 4:00 am on 06/04/2004 the Italian land contingent, or three companies of the [[11th Bersaglieri Regiment]], a [[Regiment \"Savoia Cavalleria\" (3rd)]] company and various logistic components of the [[Ariete Armored Brigade]], left the \"White Horse\" complex to go to guard the access bridges to Nassyriya: \"Alpha\", \"Bravo\", \"Charlie\".\nThe units that were involved in this clash fought for 18 hours, the longest firefight that involved Italians since the Second World War, which is why the 11th Bersaglieri Regiment received the war cross for military valor, for the maneuvers carried out on the three bridges in those days of the Ancient Babylon III mission.\n\n== The battle for the bridges ==\nIn Nassiriya, a few months after the attack on November 12, 2003, from April 6 to the end of May 2004, several battles took place between the Italian troops and the Mahdi Army; the Italian military were engaged in the city in several clashes, in which over 30,000 bullets were fired, to control three bridges that allow the passage of the river, in which eleven gunmen were slightly injured; Iraqi casualties were heavy (out of 200), including a woman and two children, and as many injured. In Italy they are known generically as the Battle of the bridges of Nassiriya, even if we refer to three different episodes with clashes between hundreds of Italian soldiers on one side and similar or higher numbers of militiamen on the other; in particular, in the second battle that took place on the night of April 6, about 500 Italian soldiers and a thousand militiamen were employed <ref name = rivistamilitare>{{cite web | title = Corriere della Sera | date= 8 April 2004 | url = http://www.rivistamilitare.it/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=710&Itemid=3}}</ref>;the objective was originally made up of all three bridges, but given the gathering of women and children among the militiamen on the third bridge, the Italians did not take any action to cross it, remaining to guard only one bank <ref name = rivistamilitare/>. For the occasion, called the Porta Pia operation, various companies from different departments were engaged, including the 11th bersaglieri regiment, a company from the San Marco battalion, a heavy armored squadron Centauro del Savoia cavalry, the GIS carabinieri and the paratroopers (carabinieri, but framed until 2002 in the Folgore Brigade) of the Tuscania regiment <ref name = rivistamilitare/>. During the fight, the Italian military were also targeted with portable anti-tank rockets of which about 400 were counted, to which they responded with about 30,000 shots of small arms and some missiles, as well as some shots of the Centauro armored vehicles <ref name = rivistamilitare/>; observers noted how the militiamen had taken several ambulances from hospitals and used them to transport ammunition to their outposts<ref name = rivistamilitare/> .\n\nThe third battle took place from 5 to 6 August 2004, on the three bridges over the Euphrates, named Alfa, Bravo and Charlie (the first three letters of the NATO phonetic alphabet), to restore access to the city by supplies for the citizenship, forbidden by militiamen; the action was entrusted to a reinforced tactical group of the task force called Serenissima <ref name = icsm-Nassirya>{{cite book|title = Nassirya, la vera storia | author1= Lao Petrilli |author2= Vincenzo Sinapi | publisher = Lindau| url = http://www.icsm.it/libri/rece/nassiryacap5.html}} capitolo 5, Le battaglie dei ponti.</ref>. At the time the Libeccio base, which until the attack hosted the Italian operational presence in the city together with the Mistral base, had already been evacuated, but was re-occupied for the occasion by the 3rd company of the Lagunari who presided over it together with the Alfa bridge despite being targeted by mortar bombs and small arms during the approach <ref name = icsm-Nassirya/>.<ref name = icsm-Nassirya/>. On the Italian side, thermal visors and illuminating grenades were used to precisely identify the starting points of the shots, in full residential area and therefore with risk for the population, together with two Mangusta helicopters that from above provided information and protection. This did not prevent an episode that was subsequently investigated by the military prosecutor and articles in the media: a vehicle, which tried to cross one of the bridges by forcing the Italian checkpoint on the opposite access to that of origin, was considered a car bomb and hit by the Italian military who garrisoned it and exploded catastrophically killing passengers including a pregnant woman <ref name = corriere-sarzanini>{{cite web| title = Corriere della Sera | author = Fiorenza Sarzanini | date = 14 September 2006| url = http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Cronache/2006/09_Settembre/14/sarzanini.shtml}}</ref>.
