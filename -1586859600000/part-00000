Alexander was allegedly \"turned from his anger\" at the last minute by astute diplomacy and flattery. Further, after the death of Alexander on 13 June 323 BCE, and the dismembering of his empire, the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemies]] came to rule over Judea and the Temple. Under the Ptolemies, the Jews were given many civil liberties and lived content under their rule. However, when the Ptolemaic army was [[Battle of Panium|defeated at Panium]] by [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus III]] of the Seleucids in 200 BCE, this policy changed. Antiochus wanted to [[Hellenization|Hellenise]] the Jews, attempting to introduce the [[Greek mythology|Greek pantheon]] into the temple. Moreover, a rebellion ensued and was brutally crushed, but no further action by Antiochus was taken, and when Antiochus died in 187 BCE at [[Lorestan Province|Luristan]], his son [[Seleucus IV Philopator]] succeeded him. However, his policies never took effect in Judea, since he was assassinated the year after his ascension.{{cn|date=January 2020}} [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] succeeded his older brother to the Seleucid throne and immediately adopted his father's previous policy of universal Hellenisation. The Jews rebelled again and Antiochus, in a rage, retaliated in force. Considering the previous episodes of discontent, the Jews became incensed when the religious observances of [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] and [[Religious male circumcision|circumcision]] were officially outlawed. When Antiochus erected a statue of [[Zeus]] in their temple and Hellenic priests began sacrificing [[pig]]s (the usual sacrifice offered to the [[Greek god]]s in the [[Ancient Greek religion|Hellenic religion]]), their anger began to spiral. When a Greek official ordered a Jewish priest to perform a Hellenic sacrifice, the priest ([[Mattathias]]) killed him. In 167 BCE, the Jews rose up en masse behind Mattathias and his five sons to fight and win their freedom from Seleucid authority. Mattathias' son [[Judah Maccabee]], now called \"The Hammer\", re-dedicated the temple in 165 BCE and the Jews celebrate this event to this day as the central theme of the non-biblical festival of [[Hanukkah]]. The temple was rededicated under Judah Maccabee in 164 BCE.<ref name=\"ODCC self\"/>\n\nDuring the Roman era, [[Pompey]] entered (and thereby desecrated) the [[Holy of Holies]] in 63 BCE, but left the Temple intact.<ref>Josephus, ''The New Complete Works'', translated by William Whiston, Kregel Publications, 1999, \"Antiquites\" Book 14:4, p.459-460</ref><ref>Michael Grant, ''The Jews in the Roman World'', Barnes & Noble, 1973, p.54</ref><ref>Peter Richardson, ''Herod: King of the Jews and Friend of the Romans'', Univ. of South Carolina Press, 1996, p.98-99</ref> In 54 BCE, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]] looted the Temple treasury,<ref>Josephus, ''The New Complete Works'', translated by William Whiston, [[Kregel Publications]], 1999, \"Antiquites\" Book 14:7, p.463</ref><ref>Michael Grant, ''The Jews in the Roman World'', Barnes & Noble, 1973, p.58</ref> only for him to die the year after at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] against [[Parthia]].

During the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] against the Romans in 132\u2013135 CE, [[Simon bar Kokhba]] and [[Rabbi Akiva]] wanted to rebuild the Temple, but bar Kokhba's revolt failed and the Jews were banned from Jerusalem (except for [[Tisha B'Av]]) by the Roman Empire.

The location of the Temple was even a question less than 150 years after the Second Temple's destruction, as detailed in the [[Talmud]].

In addition, the [[Amidah]] prayer traditionally replaces the Temple's daily ''tamid'' and special-occasion ''Mussaf'' (additional) offerings (there are separate versions for the different types of [[sacrifices]]). They are recited during the times their corresponding offerings were performed in the Temple.\n\nThe Temple is mentioned extensively in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Jewish services|services]]. [[Conservative Judaism]] retains mentions of the Temple and its restoration, but removes references to the [[korban|sacrifices]]. References to sacrifices on holidays are made in the past tense, and petitions for their restoration are removed. Mentions in Orthodox Jewish services include:\n\n*A daily recital of Biblical and Talmudic passages related to the [[korbanot]] (sacrifices) performed in the Temple ''(See korbanot in [[siddur]])''.\n*References to the restoration of the Temple and sacrificial worships in the daily [[Amidah]] prayer, the central prayer in Judaism.\n*A traditional personal plea for the restoration of the Temple at the end of private recitation of the Amidah.\n*A prayer for the restoration of the \"house of our lives\" and the [[shekhinah]] (divine presence) \"to dwell among us\" is recited during the Amidah prayer.\n*Recitation of the Psalm of the day; the [[psalm]] sung by the [[Levite]]s in the Temple for that day during the daily morning service.\n*Numerous psalms sung as part of the ordinary service make extensive references to the Temple and Temple worship.\n*Recitation of the special [[Jewish holidays|Jewish holiday]] prayers for the restoration of the Temple and their offering, during the [[Mussaf]] services on Jewish holidays.\n*An extensive recitation of the special Temple service for [[Yom Kippur]] during the service for that holiday.\n*Special services for [[Sukkot]] (Hakafot) contain extensive (but generally obscure) references to the special Temple service performed on that day.\n\nThe destruction of the Temple is mourned on the Jewish fast day of [[Tisha B'Av]]. Three other minor fasts (Tenth of [[Tevet]], 17th of [[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tammuz]], and Third of [[Tishrei]]), also mourn events leading to or following the destruction of the Temple. There are also mourning practices which are observed at all times, for example, the requirement to leave part of the house unplastered.\n\n==Herzl's vision==\nIn his  novel [[The Old New Land]], depicting the future Jewish State as he envisioned it, [[Theodor Herzl]] - founder of political Zionism - included a depiction of a rebuilt Jerusalem Temple. However, in Herzl's view, the Temple did not need to be built on the precise site where the old Temple stood and which is now taken up by the Muslim [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] and [[Dome of the Rock]] - very sensitive holy sites. By locating the Temple at an unspecified different Jerusalem location, the Jewish state envisioned by Herzl avoids the extreme tension over this issue experienced in the actual Israel. Also, worship at the Temple envisioned by Herzl does not involve [[animal sacrifice]], which was the main form of worship at the ancient Jerusalem Temple. Rather, the Temple depicted in Herzl's book is essentially just an especially big and ornate synagogue, holding the same kind of services as any other synagogue.\n\n==In other religions==\n\n===Christianity===\n{{See also|Jerusalem in Christianity}}\nJesus predicts the destruction of the Second Temple ({{bibleverse||Matthew|24:2}}) and allegorically compares his body to a Temple that will be torn down and raised up again in three days.

Alexander was allegedly \"turned from his anger\" at the last minute by astute diplomacy and flattery. Further, after the death of Alexander on 13 June 323 BCE, and the dismembering of his empire, the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemies]] came to rule over Judea and the Temple. Under the Ptolemies, the Jews were given many civil liberties and lived content under their rule. However, when the Ptolemaic army was [[Battle of Panium|defeated at Panium]] by [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus III]] of the Seleucids in 200 BCE, this policy changed. Antiochus wanted to [[Hellenization|Hellenise]] the Jews, attempting to introduce the [[Greek mythology|Greek pantheon]] into the temple. Moreover, a rebellion ensued and was brutally crushed, but no further action by Antiochus was taken, and when Antiochus died in 187 BCE at [[Lorestan Province|Luristan]], his son [[Seleucus IV Philopator]] succeeded him. However, his policies never took effect in Judea, since he was assassinated the year after his ascension.{{cn|date=January 2020}} [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] succeeded his older brother to the Seleucid throne and immediately adopted his father's previous policy of universal Hellenisation. The Jews rebelled again and Antiochus, in a rage, retaliated in force. Considering the previous episodes of discontent, the Jews became incensed when the religious observances of [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]] and [[Religious male circumcision|circumcision]] were officially outlawed. When Antiochus erected a statue of [[Zeus]] in their temple and Hellenic priests began sacrificing [[pig]]s (the usual sacrifice offered to the [[Greek god]]s in the [[Ancient Greek religion|Hellenic religion]]), their anger began to spiral. When a Greek official ordered a Jewish priest to perform a Hellenic sacrifice, the priest ([[Mattathias]]) killed him. In 167 BCE, the Jews rose up en masse behind Mattathias and his five sons to fight and win their freedom from Seleucid authority. Mattathias' son [[Judah Maccabee]], now called \"The Hammer\", re-dedicated the temple in 165 BCE and the Jews celebrate this event to this day as the central theme of the non-biblical festival of [[Hanukkah]]. The temple was rededicated under Judah Maccabee in 164 BCE.<ref name=\"ODCC self\"/>\n\nDuring the Roman era, [[Pompey]] entered (and thereby desecrated) the [[Holy of Holies]] in 63 BCE, but left the Temple intact.<ref>Josephus, ''The New Complete Works'', translated by William Whiston, Kregel Publications, 1999, \"Antiquites\" Book 14:4, p.459-460</ref><ref>Michael Grant, ''The Jews in the Roman World'', Barnes & Noble, 1973, p.54</ref><ref>Peter Richardson, ''Herod: King of the Jews and Friend of the Romans'', Univ. of South Carolina Press, 1996, p.98-99</ref> In 54 BCE, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]] looted the Temple treasury,<ref>Josephus, ''The New Complete Works'', translated by William Whiston, [[Kregel Publications]], 1999, \"Antiquites\" Book 14:7, p.463</ref><ref>Michael Grant, ''The Jews in the Roman World'', Barnes & Noble, 1973, p.58</ref> only for him to die the year after at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] against [[Parthia]].

During the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] against the Romans in 132\u2013135 CE, [[Simon bar Kokhba]] and [[Rabbi Akiva]] wanted to rebuild the Temple, but bar Kokhba's revolt failed and the Jews were banned from Jerusalem (except for [[Tisha B'Av]]) by the Roman Empire.

[[Levites]] recited [[Psalms]] at appropriate moments during the offerings, including the Psalm of the Day, special psalms for the [[Rosh Chodesh|new month]], and other occasions, the [[Hallel]] during major Jewish holidays, and psalms for special sacrifices such as the \"Psalm for the Thanksgiving Offering\" ([[Psalm]] 100).\n\nAs part of the daily offering, a prayer service was performed in the Temple which was used as the basis of the traditional Jewish [[Shacharit|(morning) service]] recited to this day, including well-known prayers such as the [[Shema]], and the [[Priestly Blessing]]. The [[Mishna]] describes it as follows:\n\n{{quote|The superintendent said to them, bless one benediction! and they blessed, and read the Ten Commandments, and the Shema, \"And it shall come to pass if you will hearken\", and \"And [God] spoke...\".

[[Masekhet|Tractates]] of the order deal with the sacrifices of animals, birds, and [[Gift offering|meal offerings]], the laws of bringing a sacrifice, such as the [[sin offering]] and the [[guilt offering]], and the laws of misappropriation of sacred property.

In addition, the [[Amidah]] prayer traditionally replaces the Temple's daily ''tamid'' and special-occasion ''Mussaf'' (additional) offerings (there are separate versions for the different types of [[sacrifices]]). They are recited during the times their corresponding offerings were performed in the Temple.\n\nThe Temple is mentioned extensively in [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Jewish services|services]]. [[Conservative Judaism]] retains mentions of the Temple and its restoration, but removes references to the [[korban|sacrifices]]. References to sacrifices on holidays are made in the past tense, and petitions for their restoration are removed. Mentions in Orthodox Jewish services include:\n\n*A daily recital of Biblical and Talmudic passages related to the [[korbanot]] (sacrifices) performed in the Temple ''(See korbanot in [[siddur]])''.\n*References to the restoration of the Temple and sacrificial worships in the daily [[Amidah]] prayer, the central prayer in Judaism.\n*A traditional personal plea for the restoration of the Temple at the end of private recitation of the Amidah.\n*A prayer for the restoration of the \"house of our lives\" and the [[shekhinah]] (divine presence) \"to dwell among us\" is recited during the Amidah prayer.\n*Recitation of the Psalm of the day; the [[psalm]] sung by the [[Levite]]s in the Temple for that day during the daily morning service.\n*Numerous psalms sung as part of the ordinary service make extensive references to the Temple and Temple worship.\n*Recitation of the special [[Jewish holidays|Jewish holiday]] prayers for the restoration of the Temple and their offering, during the [[Mussaf]] services on Jewish holidays.\n*An extensive recitation of the special Temple service for [[Yom Kippur]] during the service for that holiday.\n*Special services for [[Sukkot]] (Hakafot) contain extensive (but generally obscure) references to the special Temple service performed on that day.\n\nThe destruction of the Temple is mourned on the Jewish fast day of [[Tisha B'Av]]. Three other minor fasts (Tenth of [[Tevet]], 17th of [[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tammuz]], and Third of [[Tishrei]]), also mourn events leading to or following the destruction of the Temple. There are also mourning practices which are observed at all times, for example, the requirement to leave part of the house unplastered.\n\n==Herzl's vision==\nIn his  novel [[The Old New Land]], depicting the future Jewish State as he envisioned it, [[Theodor Herzl]] - founder of political Zionism - included a depiction of a rebuilt Jerusalem Temple. However, in Herzl's view, the Temple did not need to be built on the precise site where the old Temple stood and which is now taken up by the Muslim [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] and [[Dome of the Rock]] - very sensitive holy sites. By locating the Temple at an unspecified different Jerusalem location, the Jewish state envisioned by Herzl avoids the extreme tension over this issue experienced in the actual Israel. Also, worship at the Temple envisioned by Herzl does not involve [[animal sacrifice]], which was the main form of worship at the ancient Jerusalem Temple. Rather, the Temple depicted in Herzl's book is essentially just an especially big and ornate synagogue, holding the same kind of services as any other synagogue.\n\n==In other religions==\n\n===Christianity===\n{{See also|Jerusalem in Christianity}}\nJesus predicts the destruction of the Second Temple ({{bibleverse||Matthew|24:2}}) and allegorically compares his body to a Temple that will be torn down and raised up again in three days. This idea, of the Temple as the [[body of Christ]], became a rich and multi-layered theme in medieval Christian thought (where Temple/body can be the heavenly body of Christ, the [[wikt:ecclesial|ecclesial]] body of the Church, and the Eucharistic body on the altar).<ref>See Jennifer A. Harris, \"The Body as Temple in the High Middle Ages\", in Albert I.

Islamic tradition says that a temple was first built on the Temple Mount by [[Islamic view of Jacob|Jacob]] {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} and later rebuilt by [[Islamic view of Solomon|Solomon]], the son of [[Islamic view of David|David]]. Traditionally referred to as the \"Farthest Mosque\" (''al-masjid al-aq\u1e63a' '' literally \"utmost site of bowing (in worship)\" though the term now refers specifically to [[Al-Qibli Chapel|the mosque in the southern wall]] of the compound which today is known simply as ''al-haram ash-shar\u012bf'' \"the noble sanctuary\"), the site is seen as the destination of [[Muhammad]]'s nightly travel (''Isr\u0101' ''), one of the most significant events recounted in the [[Quran]] and the place of his ascent [[Seven Heavens|heavenwards]] thereafter (''Mi'raj'').\n\nAccording to [[Hossein Nasr|Seyyed Hossein Nasr]], professor of Islamic Studies at George Washington University, Jerusalem (i.e., the Temple Mount) has the significance as a holy site/sanctuary (\"[[Haram (site)|haram]]\") for Muslims primarily in three ways, the first two being connected to the Temple.<ref>\"The Spiritual Significance of Jerusalem: The Islamic Vision. The Islamic Quarterly. 4 (1998): pp.233-242</ref> First, Muhammad (and his companions) prayed facing the Temple in Jerusalem (referred to as \"''Bayt Al-Maqdis''\", in the [[Hadith|Hadiths]]) similar to the Jews before changing it to the [[Kaaba]] in Mecca sixteen months after arriving in [[Medina]] following the verses revealed (Sura 2:144, 149-150). Secondly, during the Meccan part of his life, he reported to have been to Jerusalem by night and prayed in the Temple, as the first part of his otherworldly journey ([[Isra and Mi'raj]]). \n\nImam [[Abdul Hadi Palazzi]], leader of Italian Muslim Assembly, quotes the Quran to support Judaism's special connection to the Temple Mount. According to Palazzi, \"The most authoritative Islamic sources affirm the Temples\". He adds that Jerusalem is sacred to Muslims because of its prior holiness to Jews and its standing as home to the biblical prophets and kings David and Solomon, all of whom he says are sacred figures in Islam. He claims that the Quran \"expressly recognizes that Jerusalem plays the same role for Jews that Mecca has for Muslims\".<ref name=\"margolis\">{{Cite journal|last=Margolis|first=David|title=The Muslim Zionist|journal=Los Angeles Jewish Journal|date=February 23, 2001}}</ref>\n\nIn his 2007 book, ''The Fight for Jerusalem: Radical Islam, the West, and the Future of the Holy City'', [[Dore Gold]] calls assertions that the Temple in Jerusalem never existed or was not located on the Mount \"[[Temple Denial]]\".

However, the question of whether and when to construct the Third Temple is disputed both within the Jewish community and without; groups within Judaism argue both for and against construction of a new Temple, while the expansion of [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic religion]] since the 1st century CE has made the issue [[Religious significance of Jerusalem|contentious]] within [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Islam]]ic thought as well. Furthermore, the complicated [[Positions on Jerusalem|political status of Jerusalem]] makes reconstruction difficult, while [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] and the [[Dome of the Rock]] have been constructed at the traditional physical location of the Temple. \n\nIn 363 CE, the Roman emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] had ordered [[Alypius of Antioch]] to rebuild the Temple as part of his campaign to strengthen non-Christian religions.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', 23.1.2\u20133.</ref> The attempt failed, perhaps due to sabotage, an accidental fire, or an [[Galilee earthquake of 363|earthquake in Galilee]].\n\nThe [[Book of Ezekiel]] prophesies what would be the Third Temple, noting it as an eternal house of prayer and describing it in detail.\n\n== In media ==\nA journalistic depiction of the controversies around the Jerusalem Temple was presented in the 2010 documentary ''Lost Temple'' by Serge Grankin. The film contains interviews with religious and academic authorities involved in the issue. German journalist Dirk-Martin Heinzelmann, featured in the film, presents the point of view of Prof. Joseph Patrich (the Hebrew University), stemming from the underground cistern mapping made by [[Charles William Wilson]] (1836-1905).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1633222/|title=Lost Temple|date=1 January 2000|publisher=|via=IMDb}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Israel}}\n* [[Jewish Temple at Elephantine]] (7th? 6th? - mid-4th century BCE)\n* [[Jewish Temple of Leontopolis]] (c. 170 BCE - 73 CE)\n* [[Temple of Solomon (S\u00e3o Paulo)]], a replica built by a Brazil-based church\n:'''Similar Iron Age temples from the region'''\n* [[Ain Dara (archaeological site)|'Ain Dara]] temple<ref name=\"Hess1999\"/>\n* [[Ebla]] (Temple D)<ref name=\"Hess1999\"/>\n* [[Emar]] temple<ref name=\"Hess1999\"/>\n* [[Mumbaqat]] temple<ref name=\"Hess1999\"/>\n* [[Tell Tayinat]] temple (8th century BCE)<ref name=\"Hess1999\">{{cite book|editors=Hess, Richard S. & Wenham, Gordon J. |title=Zion, city of our God|work=C.The Ain Dara Temple:A New Parallel from Syria|chapter=The Temple of Solomon: Heart of Jerusalem|first= John M.|last=Monson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lk_xLfQ_SRAC&pg=PA16|accessdate=15 February 2011|date=June 1999|publisher=Wm.

The Coast Guard's mission is protect sovereign rights and carry out Croatia's jurisdiction in the [[Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone]], the [[continental shelf]] and the [[high seas]]. The Coast Guard will also monitor vessels sailing in the Croatian [[territorial waters]]. If vessels are caught violating Croatian or international regulations and disregard warnings by the Coast Guard, Coast Guard ships and airplanes are authorized to pursue them and if necessary open fire, while taking care not to jeopardize the lives of the vessel's crew.\n\nUnder the law, the commander of the Coast Guard is a Navy officer who is appointed and relieved of duty by the [[President of Croatia|President of the Republic]] at the government's proposal.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.vlada.hr/en/naslovnica/novosti_i_najave/2007/rujan/vlada_u_sabor_uputila_prijedlog_zakona_o_obalnoj_strazi |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213222516/http://www.vlada.hr/en/naslovnica/novosti_i_najave/2007/rujan/vlada_u_sabor_uputila_prijedlog_zakona_o_obalnoj_strazi |archive-date=2012-02-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Organizational structure and vessels ==\n\nShips of [[Croatian Navy]] under the Command of Coast Guard:\n*''Coast Guard Command''\n*'''1st Division - Split'''\n**OB-01 ''Novigrad''\n**[[Croatian patrol boat \u0160olta (OB-02)|OB-02 ''\u0160olta'']]\n**OB-31 ''Omi\u0161''\n**[[Croatian training ship Andrija Mohorovi\u010di\u0107|B\u0160-72 ''Andrija Mohorovi\u010di\u0107'']]\n**SB-73 ''Faust Vran\u010di\u0107''\n**PT-71 ''Meduza''\n**Tug LR-71 \n*'''2nd Division - Pula'''\n**OB-03 ''Cavtat''\n**OB-04 ''Hrvatska Kostajnica''\n**Tug LR-73\n\nCroatian part of [[Adriatic Sea]] is also controlled by [[Law enforcement in Croatia|Croatian Police - Maritime department]] and [[Harbormasters\u2019 offices (Croatia)|Harbormasters\u2019 offices]] (''Lu\u010dka kapetanija'') whose ships are marked similar to Navy ships.\n\nBesides the warships, the Coast Guard has at its disposal two [[Pilatus PC-9]] aircraft and four [[Mil Mi-8]] helicopters of the [[Croatian Air Force and Defense]].\n\n==Current fleet status==\n\nThe cornerstone of the Coast Guard forces are four former Yugoslav [[Mirna-class patrol boat|''Mirna'' class patrol boats]] (OB-01 through 04).

The tender calls for the acquisition of a total of 5 inshore patrol ships ([[Croatian language|Croatian]] ''obalni ophodni brod'', OOB) which are to be 43.5 meters long, with a displacement of roughly 220 tons and a maximum sustained speed of at least 28 knots. They are to be armed with a 30 mm Remote weapon station as their main armament along with two 12,7 mm heavy machine guns and 4 MANPADS launchers. The tender was completed in May 2014 and the construction of the first ship was to start in the last quarter of the same year.

The basic version consists of three phases as follows:\n\n#Controlled hyperventilation: The first phase involves 30 cycles of breathing. Each cycle goes as follows: take a powerful breath in, fully filling the lungs. Breathe out by passively releasing the breath, but not forcefully. Repeat this cycle at a steady pace thirty times. Hof says that this form of [[hyperventilation]] may lead to [[Paresthesia|tingling sensations]] or [[Lightheadedness|light-headedness]].\n#Exhalation: After completion of the 30 cycles of controlled hyperventilation, take another deep breath in, and let it out completely. Hold the breath (with lungs empty) for as long as possible.\n#Breath retention: When strong urges to breathe occur, take a full deep breath in. Hold the breath for around 15 \u2013 20 seconds and let it go. The body may experience a normal head-rush sensation.\n\nThese three phases may be repeated for three consecutive rounds.<ref name=HofBreathing/>\n\n==Scientific investigations==\nPreliminary and proof-of-principle studies of Hof's method, as well as similar breathing practices, have shown that hyperventilating can temporarily suppress the [[innate immune response]] as well as temporarily increase heart rate and adrenaline levels.<ref name=BiologyNow>{{cite book |last1=Houtman |first1=Anne |last2=Scudellari |first2=Megan |last3=Malone |first3=Cindy |last4=Singh-Cundy |first4=Anu |chapter=22.

The rest was due to their vigorous breathing, which increased the metabolic activity in their respiratory muscles.<ref name=Lichtenbelt/>\n\nThe related [[Tummo|g-Tummo]] practice is called \"psychic heat\" practice because it is accompanied by intense sensations of heat in the spine. It involves special breathing accompanied by meditation involving mental images of flames at certain locations in the body. There are two types of breathing, \"forceful\" and \"gentle\". A scientific study found that only the forceful type results in an increase in body temperature, and that meditation was required to sustain the temperature increase.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kozhevnikov |first1=Maria |last2=Elliott |first2=James |last3=Shephard |first3=Jennifer |last4=Gramann |first4=Klaus |last5=Romanovsky |first5=Andrej A. |title=Neurocognitive and Somatic Components of Temperature Increases during g-Tummo Meditation: Legend and Reality |journal=PLOS One |date=29 March 2013 |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=e58244 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0058244|pmc=3612090 |pmid=23555572}}</ref>\n\n===Immune system suppression===\nPeter Pickkers and his PhD student Matthijs Kox of the [[Radboud University Medical Center]] in the Netherlands took blood samples from Hof before and after his regimen of breathing, meditation and an 80-minute full-body ice bath, and found that afterwards he had reduced levels of proteins associated with the immune response.<ref name=BiologyNow/>\n\nPickkers and Kox injected him with an [[Lipopolysaccharide|endotoxin]] that normally would stimulate a rapid immune response. Most subjects responded with [[influenza|flu]]-like symptoms ([[fever]], [[headache]]s and shivering), with affected cells releasing signalling proteins called [[cytokine]]s. Hof, on the other hand, had no flu-like symptoms and half as many cytokines as control subjects. Moreover, later,  after he had trained some volunteers for a week, they too had reduced symptoms.<ref name=BiologyNow/>\n\nPickkers and Kox attributed the effect on the immune system to a stress-like response. In the [[hypothalamus]], stress messages from the brain trigger a release of [[adrenaline]], which increases the pumping of blood and releases [[glucose]], both of which can help the body deal with an emergency. It also suppresses the immune system. In Hof and the trained subjects, the adrenaline release was higher than it would be after a person's first bungee jump.<ref name=BiologyNow/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kox M, van Eijk LT, Zwaag J, van den Wildenberg J, GJ Sweep FC, van der Hoeven JG, Pickkers P |date=May 20, 2014 |title=Voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system and attenuation of the innate immune response in humans |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/20/7379.full |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=111 |issue=20 |pages=7379\u20137384 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1322174111 |pmc=4034215 |access-date=January 28, 2017 |pmid=24799686}}</ref> It is not yet known which part of the training (cold exposure, breathing or meditation) is primarily responsible for the effect, or whether there are long-term training effects.<ref name=Lichtenbelt/>\n\n== Controversies ==\nPeople have died while attempting the Wim Hof Method.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gezondheid.eenvandaag.nl/tv-items/67565/_iceman_onder_vuur |title='Iceman' onder vuur |first1=Fannie |last1=Tijmstra |first2=Loes |last2=Bomers |date=10 June 2016 |publisher=[[EenVandaag]] |language=Dutch |trans-title='Iceman' under fire |access-date=23 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.parool.nl/binnenland/-iceman-oefening-eist-opnieuw-leven~a4332186 |title='Iceman'-oefening eist opnieuw leven |first1=Roelf Jan |last1=Duin |date=2 July 2016 |newspaper=[[Het Parool]]|language=Dutch |trans-title='Iceman' exercise claims a new life |access-date=23 February 2019}}</ref>  Four practitioners of the WHM drowned in 2015 and 2016, and relatives suspected the breathing exercises were to blame.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thatwasinsane2.blogspot.com/2020/04/i-did-wim-hof-method-for-1-week-and.html|title='Wim Hof Method'|accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://thatwasinsane2.blogspot.com/2020/04/i-did-wim-hof-method-for-1-week-and.html|title='Iceman Method' Real Experience}}</ref> The WHM website advises doing the exercises in a safe manner and location.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wimhofmethod.com/pages/practice-the-method|title=Practice the Wim Hof Method|website=Wim Hof Method|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129181133/https://www.wimhofmethod.com/pages/practice-the-method|archivedate=29 November 2016|accessdate=26 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nCritics of Hof say he overstates the benefits of his method, giving false hope to people suffering from serious diseases, and some of his claims have been uncritically reported by the media.<ref name=trickery>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pepijnvanerp.nl/2016/01/wim-hof-method/|first=Pepijn|last=van Erp|author-link=Pepijn van Erp|title=Wim Hof's Cold Trickery|website=Pepijn van Erp|date=1 January 2016|access-date=22 February 2019}}</ref> On his website he says that it has reduced symptoms of several diseases including [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[multiple sclerosis]], and [[Parkinson's disease]];<ref name=HofBreathing/> He has also said it might cure some forms of cancer.<ref name=trickery/> Wouter van Marken Lichtenbelt, one of the scientists who studied Hof, stated that \"[Hof's] scientific vocabulary is [[wiktionary:galimatias|galimatias]].

The basic version consists of three phases as follows:\n\n#Controlled hyperventilation: The first phase involves 30 cycles of breathing. Each cycle goes as follows: take a powerful breath in, fully filling the lungs. Breathe out by passively releasing the breath, but not forcefully. Repeat this cycle at a steady pace thirty times. Hof says that this form of [[hyperventilation]] may lead to [[Paresthesia|tingling sensations]] or [[Lightheadedness|light-headedness]].\n#Exhalation: After completion of the 30 cycles of controlled hyperventilation, take another deep breath in, and let it out completely. Hold the breath (with lungs empty) for as long as possible.\n#Breath retention: When strong urges to breathe occur, take a full deep breath in. Hold the breath for around 15 \u2013 20 seconds and let it go. The body may experience a normal head-rush sensation.\n\nThese three phases may be repeated for three consecutive rounds.<ref name=HofBreathing/>\n\n==Scientific investigations==\nPreliminary and proof-of-principle studies of Hof's method, as well as similar breathing practices, have shown that hyperventilating can temporarily suppress the [[innate immune response]] as well as temporarily increase heart rate and adrenaline levels.<ref name=BiologyNow>{{cite book |last1=Houtman |first1=Anne |last2=Scudellari |first2=Megan |last3=Malone |first3=Cindy |last4=Singh-Cundy |first4=Anu |chapter=22.

The rest was due to their vigorous breathing, which increased the metabolic activity in their respiratory muscles.<ref name=Lichtenbelt/>\n\nThe related [[Tummo|g-Tummo]] practice is called \"psychic heat\" practice because it is accompanied by intense sensations of heat in the spine. It involves special breathing accompanied by meditation involving mental images of flames at certain locations in the body. There are two types of breathing, \"forceful\" and \"gentle\". A scientific study found that only the forceful type results in an increase in body temperature, and that meditation was required to sustain the temperature increase.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kozhevnikov |first1=Maria |last2=Elliott |first2=James |last3=Shephard |first3=Jennifer |last4=Gramann |first4=Klaus |last5=Romanovsky |first5=Andrej A. |title=Neurocognitive and Somatic Components of Temperature Increases during g-Tummo Meditation: Legend and Reality |journal=PLOS One |date=29 March 2013 |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=e58244 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0058244|pmc=3612090 |pmid=23555572}}</ref>\n\n===Immune system suppression===\nPeter Pickkers and his PhD student Matthijs Kox of the [[Radboud University Medical Center]] in the Netherlands took blood samples from Hof before and after his regimen of breathing, meditation and an 80-minute full-body ice bath, and found that afterwards he had reduced levels of proteins associated with the immune response.<ref name=BiologyNow/>\n\nPickkers and Kox injected him with an [[Lipopolysaccharide|endotoxin]] that normally would stimulate a rapid immune response. Most subjects responded with [[influenza|flu]]-like symptoms ([[fever]], [[headache]]s and shivering), with affected cells releasing signalling proteins called [[cytokine]]s. Hof, on the other hand, had no flu-like symptoms and half as many cytokines as control subjects. Moreover, later,  after he had trained some volunteers for a week, they too had reduced symptoms.<ref name=BiologyNow/>\n\nPickkers and Kox attributed the effect on the immune system to a stress-like response.
