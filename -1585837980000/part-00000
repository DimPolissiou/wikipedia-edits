He possessed many virtuous qualities, and after performing a thousand [[Ashvamedha]] Yagnas and a hundred [[Rajasuya]] [[Yagna]]s (to qualify as emperor), he had attained heaven after his death. Once he got an opportunity to visit the court of [[Brahma]] where all the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] and [[Ganges in Hinduism|Ganga]] were also present.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Roy |first1=Pratap Chandra |last2=Ganguli |first2=Kisari Mohan |title=The Mahabharat of Krshna-Dwaipayana Vyasa - Translated from Original Sanskrit |date=1896 |publisher=Oriental Publishing Co. |location=Calcutta-12 |page=230 |url=https://holybooks-lichtenbergpress.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Mahabharata-VOL-1.pdf |accessdate=4 August 2018}}</ref> While the celestials were worshipping Brahma, a wind blew and displaced Ganga's clothes revealing her body. Everybody present there bashfully bent their heads except Mahabhisha who kept gazing lustfully at her. Upon seeing this act, Brahma lost his temper and cursed him to be born as mortal. Ganga who also enjoyed this act was cursed to be born as human and come back only after breaking Mahabhisha's heart. Mahabhisha then requested Brahma that he, Mahabhisha, be born as the son of Kuru king [[Pratipa]] and his wish was granted by Brahma.\n\nThe Kuru king Pratipa was once meditating. At that time Ganga took the form of a beautiful woman, approached the king and sat on his right thigh. When he asked her what she wanted, Ganga requested him to become her husband. Pratipa however refused since he had taken a vow not to lust for anybody, and also that she had sat on his right thigh and according to traditions a man's right thigh was for his daughter or daughter-in-law while the left thigh was for his wife. He then proposed that she marry his son, to which she agreed.\n\nA child was born to Pratipa and his wife Sunanda in their old age. He was named Shantanu because when he was born his father had controlled his passions by ascetic penances. Pratipa then installed Shantanu as king of Hastinapura and retired into the woods to perform penances. Bahlika who was elder than Shantanu also gave permission to him for becoming the king of Hastinapura.\n\n==Shantanu and Ganga==\n\n[[File:Shantanu Meets Goddess Ganga by Warivick Goble.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Shantanu Meets Goddess Ganga by [[Warwick Goble]], 1913]]\n\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Ganga and Shantanu (1890).jpg|thumb|180px|Shantanu stops Ganga from drowning their eighth child, who later was known as Bhishma.]]\n\nShantanu saw a beautiful woman on the banks of the river [Ganges] (Ganga) and asked her to marry him. She agreed but with one condition: that Shantanu would not ask any questions about her actions. They married and she later gave birth to a son. But she drowned the child. Shantanu could not ask her the reason, because of his promise, lest she would leave him. One by one, seven sons were born to them and were drowned by Ganga. When Ganga was about to drown the eighth son, Shantanu, devastated, could not restrain himself and confronted her. Finally, Ganga explained to King Shantanu about Brahma's curse given to Mahabhisha and her. Then she told him that their eight children were Eight Vasus who were cursed by Vasishtha to be born on earth as mortal humans however when they pacified him, he limited his curse and told them that they would be freed from this curse within a year of their birth as humans. So she released the seven of them from this life by drowning them all. However the Vasu [[Dyaus Pita|Dyaus]] was cursed to live a long life and to never have a wife or have children. But the sage also gave a boon to him that he would be virtuous, conversant with all the holy scriptures and will be an obedient son to his father.  that she will take him to the heavens to train him properly for the King's throne and status. With these words she disappeared along with the child while Shantanu was struck with grief thinking about spending the rest of his life without her.\n\n==Shantanu reunites with his son==\n\n[[File:The scene from the Mahabharata of the presentation by Ganga of her son Devavrata (the future Bhisma) to his father, Santanu..jpg|thumb|250px|Painting depicting presentation by [[Ganga]] of her son Devavrata (the future Bhishma) to his father, Shantanu]]\n\nShantanu, filled with grief from the loss of his wife and son, began to practise Brahmacharya and ruled his kingdom extremely well. By merely adopting virtuous behaviour, Shantanu was easily able to conquer the entire world without lifting weapons. All the kings declared Shantanu as Emperor and his reign was a peaceful one. Shantanu gave up hunting and gained popularity from his subjects.\n\nOne day, while walking along the banks of the Ganga, Shantanu saw that the river had become shallow. While searching for the cause of this phenomenon, he came across a handsome young boy who had checked the river's flow with his celestial weapon. The young boy was his son, however he didn't recognize him because he could see  him only for a few moments after he was born. The boy recognized that he was his father, however he didn't reveal it to him instead he disappeared from his sight using his power of illusion. Shantanu upon seeing this, wondered whether the boy was actually his son and called upon Ganga to show the boy to him. Ganga having thus appeared, revealed to him that the boy was actually his son Devavrata and that he was taught the knowledge of the holy scriptures by the sage [[Vasishtha]] and the art of warfare by [[Parshurama]]. After revealing the truth about Devavrata she told Shantanu to take him to Hastinapura. Upon reaching the capital Shantanu crowned Devavrata as the heir-apparent to the throne.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nAlthough Shantanu was pained from his separation from Ganga, he was overjoyed upon receiving such an accomplished son. He performed seven Ashwamedha Yagnas on the banks of Yamuna with the help of Devavrata.\n\n==Shantanu and Satyavati==\n\n[[File:Ravi Varma-Shantanu and Satyavati.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]] depicting Shantanu wooing the fisherwoman [[Satyavati]]]]\n\n[[File:Bheeshma oath by RRV.jpg|thumb|250px|Devavrata taking the Bhishma Pratigya]]\n\nFour years later, Shantanu while travelling near the banks of Yamuna smelled a sweet scent coming from an unknown direction. While searching for the cause of the scent, he came across [[Satyavati]] from whom the smell of scent was coming. Satyavati was an adopted daughter of the chief of the fishermen of her village. Upon seeing her, Shantanu fell in love with her and desired to her. Upon asking for his consent, her father agreed to the marriage on condition that Satyavati's son would inherit the throne of Hastinapura.\n\nKing Shantanu was unable to give his word on accession as his eldest son Devavrata was the heir to the throne. However, Devavrata came to know a\nbout this and for the sake of his father, gave his word to the chief that he would renounce all his claims to the throne, in favour of Satyavati's children. To reassure the skeptical chief, further he also vowed lifelong celibacy to ensure that future generations borne of Satyavati would also not be challenged by his offspring. Upon hearing this vow he immediately agreed to the marriage of Satyavati and Shantanu. Devavrata was named as [[Bhishma]] (one who has taken a terrible vow) by the celestials because of the terrible oath he took. Upon returning with Satyavati to Hastinapura he told about his vow to his father. Upon hearing about this Shantanu became highly impressed and gave him a boon that he will only die if he chooses so. Shantanu and Satyavati went on to have two sons, [[Chitr\u0101ngada]] and [[Vichitravirya]]. After Shantanu's death, Vichitravirya became the king of Hastinapura because Chitrangada was killed by a [[gandharva]] of same name when Shantanu was still alive.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata}}\n{{HinduMythology}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in the Mahabharata]]\n[[Category:Ancient Indian people]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2016}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=January 2016}}\n{{Infobox character\n| series             = [[Mahabharata]]\n| image              = File:Santanu and Ganga.JPG\n| alt                = Shantanu\n| caption            = Shantanu, a king of Hastinapura in the Mahabharata, saw a beautiful woman on the banks of the river Ganga\n| family             = [[Pratipa]] (father) Sunanda (mother) [[Devapi]] (brother) [[Bahlika (Mahabharata)|Bahlika]] (brother)\n| spouse             = [[Ganges in Hinduism|Ganga]] and [[Satyavati]]\n| children           = [[Bhishma]], [[Chitrangad|Chitrangad]] and [[Vichitravirya]]\n| name               = \n| franchise          = \n| first_major        = \n| first_minor        = \n| first_issue        = \n| first_date         = \n| last_major         = \n| last_minor         = \n| last_issue         = \n| last_date          = \n| first              = \n| firstgame          = \n| last               = \n| creator            = \n| based_on           = \n| adapted_by         = \n| portrayer          = \n| voice              = \n| full_name          = \n| origin             = \n| home               = \n| color              = Orange\n}}\nIn the epic [[Mahabharata]], '''''Shantanu''''' was a [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]] king of [[Hastinapura]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chandrakant |first1=Kamala |last2=Pai |first2=Anant |title=Bheesma- Heroes from the Mahabharat |date=1997 |publisher=Amar Chitra Katha Pvt Ltd |location=Mumbai |isbn=81-8482-035-6 |page=1 |edition=August 2010 Reprint}}</ref> He was a descendant of the [[Bh\u0101ratas|Bharata]] race, of the Lunar dynasty and great-grandfather of the [[Pandava]]s and [[Kaurava]]s.

He possessed many virtuous qualities, and after performing a thousand [[Ashvamedha]] Yagnas and a hundred [[Rajasuya]] [[Yagna]]s (to qualify as emperor), he had attained heaven after his death. Once he got an opportunity to visit the court of [[Brahma]] where all the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] and [[Ganges in Hinduism|Ganga]] were also present.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Roy |first1=Pratap Chandra |last2=Ganguli |first2=Kisari Mohan |title=The Mahabharat of Krshna-Dwaipayana Vyasa - Translated from Original Sanskrit |date=1896 |publisher=Oriental Publishing Co. |location=Calcutta-12 |page=230 |url=https://holybooks-lichtenbergpress.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Mahabharata-VOL-1.pdf |accessdate=4 August 2018}}</ref> While the celestials were worshipping Brahma, a wind blew and displaced Ganga's clothes revealing her body. Everybody present there bashfully bent their heads except Mahabhisha who kept gazing lustfully at her. Upon seeing this act, Brahma lost his temper and cursed him to be born as mortal. Ganga who also enjoyed this act was cursed to be born as human and come back only after breaking Mahabhisha's heart. Mahabhisha then requested Brahma that he, Mahabhisha, be born as the son of Kuru king [[Pratipa]] and his wish was granted by Brahma.\n\nThe Kuru king Pratipa was once meditating. At that time Ganga took the form of a beautiful woman, approached the king and sat on his right thigh. When he asked her what she wanted, Ganga requested him to become her husband. Pratipa however refused since he had taken a vow not to lust for anybody, and also that she had sat on his right thigh and according to traditions a man's right thigh was for his daughter or daughter-in-law while the left thigh was for his wife. He then proposed that she marry his son, to which she agreed.\n\nA child was born to Pratipa and his wife Sunanda in their old age. He was named Shantanu because when he was born his father had controlled his passions by ascetic penances. Pratipa then installed Shantanu as king of Hastinapura and retired into the woods to perform penances. Bahlika who was elder than Shantanu also gave permission to him for becoming the king of Hastinapura.\n\n==Shantanu and Ganga==\n\n[[File:Shantanu Meets Goddess Ganga by Warivick Goble.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Shantanu Meets Goddess Ganga by [[Warwick Goble]], 1913]]\n\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Ganga and Shantanu (1890).jpg|thumb|180px|Shantanu stops Ganga from drowning their eighth child, who later was known as Bhishma.]]\n\nShantanu saw a beautiful woman on the banks of the river [Ganges] (Ganga) and asked her to marry him. She agreed but with one condition: that Shantanu would not ask any questions about her actions. They married and she later gave birth to a son. But she drowned the child. Shantanu could not ask her the reason, because of his promise, lest she would leave him. One by one, seven sons were born to them and were drowned by Ganga. When Ganga was about to drown the eighth son, Shantanu, devastated, could not restrain himself and confronted her. Finally, Ganga explained to King Shantanu about Brahma's curse given to Mahabhisha and her. Then she told him that their eight children were Eight Vasus who were cursed by Vasishtha to be born on earth as mortal humans however when they pacified him, he limited his curse and told them that they would be freed from this curse within a year of their birth as humans. So she released the seven of them from this life by drowning them all. However the Vasu [[Dyaus Pita|Dyaus]] was cursed to live a long life and to never have a wife or have children. But the sage also gave a boon to him that he would be virtuous, conversant with all the holy scriptures and will be an obedient son to his father.  that she will take him to the heavens to train him properly for the King's throne and status. With these words she disappeared along with the child while Shantanu was struck with grief thinking about spending the rest of his life without her.\n\n==Shantanu reunites with his son==\n\n[[File:The scene from the Mahabharata of the presentation by Ganga of her son Devavrata (the future Bhisma) to his father, Santanu..jpg|thumb|250px|Painting depicting presentation by [[Ganga]] of her son Devavrata (the future Bhishma) to his father, Shantanu]]\n\nShantanu, filled with grief from the loss of his wife and son, began to practise Brahmacharya and ruled his kingdom extremely well. By merely adopting virtuous behaviour, Shantanu was easily able to conquer the entire world without lifting weapons. All the kings declared Shantanu as Emperor and his reign was a peaceful one. Shantanu gave up hunting and gained popularity from his subjects.\n\nOne day, while walking along the banks of the Ganga, Shantanu saw that the river had become shallow. While searching for the cause of this phenomenon, he came across a handsome young boy who had checked the river's flow with his celestial weapon. The young boy was his son, however he didn't recognize him because he could see  him only for a few moments after he was born. The boy recognized that he was his father, however he didn't reveal it to him instead he disappeared from his sight using his power of illusion. Shantanu upon seeing this, wondered whether the boy was actually his son and called upon Ganga to show the boy to him. Ganga having thus appeared, revealed to him that the boy was actually his son Devavrata and that he was taught the knowledge of the holy scriptures by the sage [[Vasishtha]] and the art of warfare by [[Parshurama]]. After revealing the truth about Devavrata she told Shantanu to take him to Hastinapura. Upon reaching the capital Shantanu crowned Devavrata as the heir-apparent to the throne.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nAlthough Shantanu was pained from his separation from Ganga, he was overjoyed upon receiving such an accomplished son. He performed seven Ashwamedha Yagnas on the banks of Yamuna with the help of Devavrata.\n\n==Shantanu and Satyavati==\n\n[[File:Ravi Varma-Shantanu and Satyavati.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]] depicting Shantanu wooing the fisherwoman [[Satyavati]]]]\n\n[[File:Bheeshma oath by RRV.jpg|thumb|250px|Devavrata taking the Bhishma Pratigya]]\n\nFour years later, Shantanu while travelling near the banks of Yamuna smelled a sweet scent coming from an unknown direction. While searching for the cause of the scent, he came across [[Satyavati]] from whom the smell of scent was coming. Satyavati was an adopted daughter of the chief of the fishermen of her village. Upon seeing her, Shantanu fell in love with her and desired to her. Upon asking for his consent, her father agreed to the marriage on condition that Satyavati's son would inherit the throne of Hastinapura.\n\nKing Shantanu was unable to give his word on accession as his eldest son Devavrata was the heir to the throne. However, Devavrata came to know a\nbout this and for the sake of his father, gave his word to the chief that he would renounce all his claims to the throne, in favour of Satyavati's children. To reassure the skeptical chief, further he also vowed lifelong celibacy to ensure that future generations borne of Satyavati would also not be challenged by his offspring. Upon hearing this vow he immediately agreed to the marriage of Satyavati and Shantanu. Devavrata was named as [[Bhishma]] (one who has taken a terrible vow) by the celestials because of the terrible oath he took. Upon returning with Satyavati to Hastinapura he told about his vow to his father. Upon hearing about this Shantanu became highly impressed and gave him a boon that he will only die if he chooses so. Shantanu and Satyavati went on to have two sons, [[Chitr\u0101ngada]] and [[Vichitravirya]]. After Shantanu's death, Vichitravirya became the king of Hastinapura because Chitrangada was killed by a [[gandharva]] of same name when Shantanu was still alive.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata}}\n{{HinduMythology}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in the Mahabharata]]\n[[Category:Ancient Indian people]]\n", "name_user": "Mathoholic68", "label": "safe", "comment": "the etymological meaning of shantanu corrected and citation done for changes made.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shantanu"}
