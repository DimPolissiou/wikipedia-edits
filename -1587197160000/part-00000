Trials on various prototypes based on the [[AKM]] were carried out by the [[Armament Research and Development Establishment]] (ARDE) in [[Pune]]. On the completion of the trial, The Indian Small Arms System (INSAS) was adopted in 1990. However, to phase out  the still in use bolt-action [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifles as quickly as possible, India had to acquire 100,000 7.62\u00d739mm AKM-type rifles from Russia, Hungary, Romania and Israel in 1990\u201392.<ref name=\"Walter2006\">{{cite book|author=John Walter|title=Rifles of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eq2Dnj4sDZIC&pg=PA210|accessdate=28 May 2014|date=25 March 2006|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=0-89689-241-7|pages=209\u2013210|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708204553/http://books.google.com/books?id=Eq2Dnj4sDZIC&pg=PA210|archive-date=8 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, three variants were planned in the INSAS system, a [[rifle]], a [[carbine]] and a [[squad automatic weapon]] (SAW) or [[Light machine gun]] (LMG).

It can fire a three-round [[Burst mode (weapon)|burst]] or in semi-automatic mode. The cyclic rate averages at 650 rpm. The transparent plastic magazine was adapted from the [[Steyr AUG]]. The rear [[Iron sights|sight]] lies on one end of the [[Breechblock|breech cover]] and is calibrated to 400 meters. The furniture is either made for wood or polymer.<ref name=\"Cutshaw2011\"/> The polymer [[Stock (firearms)|butt]] and forend assemblies differ from the AKM and are more similar to that of [[IMI Galil]]. Some variants have a folding butt. A [[bayonet]] can also be attached to it.<ref name=\"Walter2006\"/> The guns take 20- or 30-round polymer magazines. The 30-round magazine is made for the LMG version, but can be also used in the rifle.

On the completion of the trial, The Indian Small Arms System (INSAS) was adopted in 1990. However, to phase out  the still in use bolt-action [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifles as quickly as possible, India had to acquire 100,000 7.62\u00d739mm AKM-type rifles from Russia, Hungary, Romania and Israel in 1990\u201392.<ref name=\"Walter2006\">{{cite book|author=John Walter|title=Rifles of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eq2Dnj4sDZIC&pg=PA210|accessdate=28 May 2014|date=25 March 2006|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=0-89689-241-7|pages=209\u2013210|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708204553/http://books.google.com/books?id=Eq2Dnj4sDZIC&pg=PA210|archive-date=8 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, three variants were planned in the INSAS system, a [[rifle]], a [[carbine]] and a [[squad automatic weapon]] (SAW) or [[Light machine gun]] (LMG).

It has a chrome-plated bore. The barrel has a six-groove [[rifling]]. The basic gas operated [[Gas-operated reloading#Long-stroke piston|long stroke piston]] and the [[rotating bolt]] are similar to the [[AKM]]/[[AK-47]].<ref name=\"Cutshaw2011\"/>\n\n[[File:Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry (JAK LI) soldier.jpg|thumb|A [[Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry|JAK LI soldier]] guarding the [[India Gate]] with INSAS rifle.]]\n[[File:INSAS RIFLE.jpg|thumb|An Indian soldier uniform with the INSAS rifle.]]\n\nIt has a manual gas regulator, similar to that of [[FN FAL]], and a gas cutoff for launching grenades. The [[charging handle]] is on the left instead of on the bolt carrier, similar in operation to the [[Heckler & Koch HK33|HK33]].<ref name=\"Cutshaw2011\"/> There is a [[Selective fire|change lever]] on the left side of the [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]] above the pistol grip. It can fire a three-round [[Burst mode (weapon)|burst]] or in semi-automatic mode. The cyclic rate averages at 650 rpm. The transparent plastic magazine was adapted from the [[Steyr AUG]]. The rear [[Iron sights|sight]] lies on one end of the [[Breechblock|breech cover]] and is calibrated to 400 meters. The furniture is either made for wood or polymer.<ref name=\"Cutshaw2011\"/> The polymer [[Stock (firearms)|butt]] and forend assemblies differ from the AKM and are more similar to that of [[IMI Galil]]. Some variants have a folding butt. A [[bayonet]] can also be attached to it.<ref name=\"Walter2006\"/> The guns take 20- or 30-round polymer magazines. The 30-round magazine is made for the LMG version, but can be also used in the rifle. The flash suppressor also accepts NATO-specification [[rifle grenade]]s.<ref name=\"Cutshaw2011\"/>\n\n===Issues===\nDuring the 1999 [[Kargil War]], the rifles were used in the high altitudes of the [[Himalayas]]. There were complaints of jamming, the magazine cracking due to the cold and the rifle going into automatic mode when it was set for three-round bursts.<ref name=weary-army/> There was also a problem of oil being sprayed into the eye of the operator.
