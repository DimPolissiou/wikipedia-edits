It was later reincarnation into '''Kvarner Kostrena'''.\n\n==History==\n\n===RK Kvarner===\nThe club was founded 27 February 1963,<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.formula1-dictionary.net/rijeka_7.html |title = Rijeka history | language = Croatian | website = formula }}</ref> as '''RK Kvarner'''. The first ever players of Kvarner were: Simeon Kosanovi\u0107, Zvonko Ugrin, Slobodan Petkovi\u0107, Vladimir Babi\u0107, Josip Bo\u017ei\u0107, Jerolim Ostoji\u0107, Marijan Lu\u010di\u0107, Davor Aman\u010di\u0107, Marijan Glavan, Perica Vuki\u010devi\u0107 and Ivan Muniti\u0107 alongside coach Eduard Domazet. The initiators where: \u0110uro Blim, Nikola Mikuli\u010di\u0107, Eduard Domazet, Mladen Kopajti\u0107, Ivo Kreculj, Branko Komljenovi\u0107, Petar Grabovac, Petar Orguli\u0107 and Rajko Plive\u010di\u0107.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://croinfo.net/forum/index.php?topic=212.120 |title = Historical sports stories | language = Croatian | website = croinfo.net }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rk-kvarner1.jpg|thumb|RK Kvarner logo]]\n\nDuring the first ten year of the club moved up the ranks from Regional leagues to the [[Yugoslav Handball Championship|Yugoslav First League]]. During their time in the First league Kvarner's coach was [[Vlado Stenzel]] who was at the time also the [[Yugoslavia national handball team|Yugoslavian national team]] coach. Stenzel's presence saw players like [[Zdenko Hib\u0161er]], [[Vlado Vukoje]], Roberto So\u0161i\u0107 and [[Zdravko Ra\u0111enovi\u0107]] playing for Kvarner.\nThese years where the highlight of Kvarner's history as they played in the [[Yugoslav Handball Championship|Yugoslav first league]]. Kvarner was the first handball club in [[Rijeka]] to enter the first league. In 1969 and 1970 Kvarner was the champion of [[Croatia]].\n\nIn 1973 Kvarner was relegated to the Second league with most of its players transferring to other clubs. The club bounced back to the First league the following season with mostly young player in the squad. These players where: Ivica Rimani\u0107, Boris Komucki, Jurica Laki\u0107,...\n\nKvarner dominated Zamet until 1977 when Zamet started to rise thru the ranks of [[Yugoslav Handball Championship|Yugoslav handball]].\n\n===Kvarner Zamet rivalry===\nDuring the 1960s a city rivalry came between RK Kvarner and [[RK Zamet]] the city's best handball clubs. Due to a lot of players moving throughout both clubs the rivalry became more serious. After nearly five years of intense matches finally in 1981 Kvarner signed defeat and gave [[RK Zamet|Zamet]] the title of the best [[handball|handball club]] in [[Rijeka]]. Kvarner also gave Zamet three of their best players: Boris \u0160kara, Damir \u010cavlovi\u0107 and Drago \u017diljak.\n\nIn later years Kvarner was no match for [[RK Zamet|Zamet]] and they mostly played friendly matches since they weren't in the same league.\n\n===Hard times and  financial troubles===\nDuring the 1980s Kvarner struggled eventually  being relegated to regional leagues. In 1982 Kvarner was supposed to fuse with club [[RK Kozala|Kozala]] forming RK Rijeka, but the fusing never happened. This later proved to be a big mistake. At the end of the decade Kvarner lost their dressing room to the [[basketball]] team of [[KK Kvarner|Kvarner]]. Not being able to live up to their previous results Kvarner stayed a low level club until the end of the [[Yugoslav Handball Championship|Yugoslavian league]].\n\nWith little progress made in the [[Croatian Premier Handball League|Croatian league]] in 1996 former players of the club came out of retirement, started playing for the club and eventually made it to the second division the [[Croatian Premier Handball League|1.B HRL]].\n\n===Kvarner Kostrena===\nIn 2001 Marko Kosanovi\u0107 took over as president of the club who reinstated the club in the [[Croatian Premier Handball League|3. HRL - West]] after nearly three years of absence. After entering [[Croatian Premier Handball League|2. HRL - West]] the club move to [[Kostrena]] where they played in a newly built venue [[Kostrena|SD Kostrena]] and changed the club's name to '''Kvarner Kostrena'''. With many former players managing the club it survived for ten years playing in the third tier of [[handball|Croatian handball]]. In 2011 due to financial problems Kvarner Kostrena dismantled their senior team wanting to focus more on their youth academy.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.sportcom.hr/lokalni-sport/rukomet/treca-liga-z-mz/rukometni-klub-kvarner-kostrena-odustao-od-tre%C4%87e-lige-i-ugasio-seniorski-pogon.html |title = Kvarner Kostrena dissolved senior team| language = Croatian | website = SportCom.hr }}</ref>\n\nTwo years later in February 2013 Kvarner Kostrena announced the club would be closing\n\n===Venue===\nFrom the 1960s during the end of the 1980s Kvarner played on the court of Economics high school. For about a decade they used venues around [[Rijeka]] such as [[Dvorana Mladosti]] and [[Kozala|Dvorana Kozala]].\n\nIn 2003 they moved to [[Kostrena]] in newly built venue SD Kostrena (Sportska

It was later reincarnation into '''Kvarner Kostrena'''.\n\n==History==\n\n===RK Kvarner===\nThe club was founded 27 February 1963,<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.formula1-dictionary.net/rijeka_7.html |title = Rijeka history | language = Croatian | website = formula }}</ref> as '''RK Kvarner'''. The first ever players of Kvarner were: Simeon Kosanovi\u0107, Zvonko Ugrin, Slobodan Petkovi\u0107, Vladimir Babi\u0107, Josip Bo\u017ei\u0107, Jerolim Ostoji\u0107, Marijan Lu\u010di\u0107, Davor Aman\u010di\u0107, Marijan Glavan, Perica Vuki\u010devi\u0107 and Ivan Muniti\u0107 alongside coach Eduard Domazet. The initiators where: \u0110uro Blim, Nikola Mikuli\u010di\u0107, Eduard Domazet, Mladen Kopajti\u0107, Ivo Kreculj, Branko Komljenovi\u0107, Petar Grabovac, Petar Orguli\u0107 and Rajko Plive\u010di\u0107.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://croinfo.net/forum/index.php?topic=212.120 |title = Historican sports story's | language = Croatian | website = croinfo.net }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Rk-kvarner1.jpg|thumb|RK Kvarner logo]]\n\nDuring the first ten year of the club moved up the ranks from Regional leagues to the [[Yugoslav Handball Championship|Yugoslav First League]]. During their time in the First league Kvarner's coach was [[Vlado Stenzel]] who was at the time also the [[Yugoslavia national handball team|Yugoslavian national team]] coach. Stenzel's presence saw players like [[Zdenko Hib\u0161er]], [[Vlado Vukoje]], Roberto So\u0161i\u0107 and [[Zdravko Ra\u0111enovi\u0107]] playing for Kvarner.\nThese years where the highlight of Kvarner's history as they played in the [[Yugoslav Handball Championship|Yugoslav first league]]. Kvarner was the first handball club in [[Rijeka]] to enter the first league. In 1969 and 1970 Kvarner was the champion of [[Croatia]].\n\nIn 1973 Kvarner was relegated to the Second league with most of its players transferring to other clubs. The club bounced back to the First league the following season with mostly young player in the squad. These players where: Ivica Rimani\u0107, Boris Komucki, Jurica Laki\u0107,...\n\nKvarner dominated Zamet until 1977 when Zamet started to rise thru the ranks of [[Yugoslav Handball Championship|Yugoslav handball]].\n\n===Kvarner Zamet rivalry===\nDuring the 1960s a city rivalry came between RK Kvarner and [[RK Zamet]] the city's best handball clubs. Due to a lot of players moving throughout both clubs the rivalry became more serious. After nearly five years of intense matches finally in 1981 Kvarner signed defeat and gave [[RK Zamet|Zamet]] the title of the best [[handball|handball club]] in [[Rijeka]]. Kvarner also gave Zamet three of their best players: Boris \u0160kara, Damir \u010cavlovi\u0107 and Drago \u017diljak.\n\nIn later years Kvarner was no match for [[RK Zamet|Zamet]] and they mostly played friendly matches since they weren't in the same league.\n\n===Hard times and  financial troubles===\nDuring the 1980s Kvarner struggled eventually  being relegated to regional leagues. In 1982 Kvarner was supposed to fuse with club [[RK Kozala|Kozala]] forming RK Rijeka, but the fusing never happened. This later proved to be a big mistake. At the end of the decade Kvarner lost their dressing room to the [[basketball]] team of [[KK Kvarner|Kvarner]]. Not being able to live up to their previous results Kvarner stayed a low level club until the end of the [[Yugoslav Handball Championship|Yugoslavian league]].\n\nWith little progress made in the [[Croatian Premier Handball League|Croatian league]] in 1996 former players of the club came out of retirement, started playing for the club and eventually made it to the second division the [[Croatian Premier Handball League|1.B HRL]].\n\n===Kvarner Kostrena===\nIn 2001 Marko Kosanovi\u0107 took over as president of the club who reinstated the club in the [[Croatian Premier Handball League|3. HRL - West]] after nearly three years of absence. After entering [[Croatian Premier Handball League|2. HRL - West]] the club move to [[Kostrena]] where they played in a newly built venue [[Kostrena|SD Kostrena]] and changed the club's name to '''Kvarner Kostrena'''. With many former players managing the club it survived for ten years playing in the third tier of [[handball|Croatian handball]]. In 2011 due to financial problems Kvarner Kostrena dismantled their senior team wanting to focus more on their youth academy.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.sportcom.hr/lokalni-sport/rukomet/treca-liga-z-mz/rukometni-klub-kvarner-kostrena-odustao-od-tre%C4%87e-lige-i-ugasio-seniorski-pogon.html |title = Kvarner Kostrena dissolved senior team| language = Croatian | website = SportCom.hr }}</ref>\n\nTwo years later in February 2013 Kvarner Kostrena announced the club would be closing\n\n===Venue===\nFrom the 1960s during the end of the 1980s Kvarner played on the court of Economics high school. For about a decade they used venues around [[Rijeka]] such as [[Dvorana Mladosti]] and [[Kozala|Dvorana Kozala]].\n\nIn 2003 they moved to [[Kostrena]] in newly built venue SD Kostrena (Sportska Dvorana Kostrena).\n\n===Seasons===\n{|\n|valign=\"top\" width=0%|\n{|  class=\"wikitable\" \n!Season\n!Tier\n!Division\n!Pos.\n|-\n|style=\"background:#efefef;\"|1963\n| align=\"center\"|3\n|

The franchise also includes short films, a television series, live shows, video games and theme park attractions. It is distributed by [[Universal Pictures]].\n\nThe [[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|first film]] was released in 2001, which began the original trilogy of films focused on racing, and culminated in the standalone film ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'' (2006). The series then went under a soft reboot with ''[[Fast & Furious (2009 film)|Fast & Furious]]'' (2009), which transitioned the series toward heists and spying, and was followed by four sequels. Another sequel is set to be released in 2021, with a tenth and final film also planned. The main films are collectively known as ''The Fast Saga''.\n\nUniversal expanded the series to include the spin-off film ''[[Hobbs & Shaw]]'' (2019), while its subsidiary [[DreamWorks Animation]] followed this with the animated web television series ''[[Fast & Furious Spy Racers]]''. Soundtrack albums have been released for all the films, as well as compilation albums containing existing music heard in the films. Two [[short film]]s that tie into the series have also been released.\n\nThe series has been commercially successful and is Universal's biggest franchise, as of 2015 ranking as the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing franchises and film series|ninth-highest-grossing film series of all time]] with a combined gross of over $5 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davegonzales/2015/04/06/furious-7-marks-universals-biggest-franchise-ever/|title='Furious 7' Marks Universal's Biggest Franchise Ever|author=David Gonzales|date=6 April 2015|work=Forbes|accessdate=8 March 2017}}</ref> Critical reception was mostly mixed to negative for the first four films, while later films in the series were more positively received. Outside of the films, ''The Fast Saga'' has been the focus of other media, including attractions at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]], live shows, commercials, many video games and toys.

The studio warmed toward the idea of [[Timothy Olyphant]] in the role of [[Dominic Toretto]], due to the success of the blockbuster ''[[Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 film)|Gone in 60 Seconds]]'' (2000), but he declined. Moritz instead persisted on [[Vin Diesel]] following his performance in ''[[Pitch Black (film)|Pitch Black]]'' (2000), with Diesel accepting after proposing several script changes.

Cohen also declined the sequel, opting to develop the film ''[[XXX (2002 film)|xXx]]'' (2002), which starred Diesel in the lead role. To account for these changes, Universal commissioned the writers to create a [[standalone sequel]] with Walker in the lead, and brought in [[John Singleton]] as the new director. As a result, filming was delayed by a year, and [[Tyrese Gibson]], who worked with Singleton on the film ''[[Baby Boy (film)|Baby Boy]]'' (2001), was hired as Walker's new co-star. Furthermore, the production location shifted to [[Miami]], and was also the first entry in the series to feature long-running castmate [[Ludacris]].<ref name=\"Amy Kaufman\"/>\n\nUniversal attempted to bring back Diesel for the third installment, but he again declined due to other projects and a dislike for the script.<ref name=\"Amy Welch\">{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/fast-furious-tokyo-drift-vin-diesel/ |title=Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift Was Originally Pitched to Star Vin Diesel |author=Amy Welch |date=11 April 2017 |work=ScreenRant |accessdate=3 Aug 2018}}</ref> As a result of failing to secure the returns of any of the original cast, Universal ordered a reboot of the franchise.

While developing the film, Universal wholeheartedly departed from the street racing theme prevalent in previous films, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences that might otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. ''Fast Five'' is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls, and the heist. ''Fast Five'' was initially conceived to conclude the franchise, but following strong box office performance and high critical praise, Universal proceeded to develop a sixth installment.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=17}} Furthermore, the film is noted for the addition of [[Dwayne Johnson]] to the cast, whose performance was critically praised.<ref name=\"ProductionCollider\">{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/dwayne-johnson-interview-faster-fast-five-the-rundown-2/60304/ |title=Faster the Chronicles: Dwayne Johnson \u2013 Exclusive Interview that Covers Faster, Fast Five, The Other Guys, 3D, More |publisher=Collider |date=November 15, 2010 |accessdate=March 9, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zvaAV9f0?url=http://collider.com/dwayne-johnson-interview-faster-fast-five-the-rundown-2/60304/ |archivedate=July 4, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref><ref name=\"FilmingGeneral\">{{cite news|last=Verrier |first=Richard |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/05/puerto-rico-cruising-on-fast-five-success-.html |title=Puerto Rico hoping to ride box-office success of 'Fast Five' |publisher=Tribune Company |work=Los Angeles Times |date=May 14, 2011 |accessdate=November 13, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6C8MoGFKm?url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/05/puerto-rico-cruising-on-fast-five-success-.html |archivedate=November 13, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2011/04/fast-five-will-transition-franchise-from-street-racing-to-heist-action-125552/#more-125552|title='Fast Five' Will Transition Franchise From Street Racing To Future Full Of Heist Action|author=Nikki Finke|date=25 April 2011|work=Deadline|accessdate=3 Aug 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2011, the ''Los Angeles Times'' reported that Universal was approaching the sixth and seventh installment with a single storyline running through both films, with Morgan envisaging themes of freedom and family,{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=18}} but later shifted to account for the studio's wishes to incorporate elements of espionage.

The game ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2006 video game)|The Fast and the Furious]]'' was released in 2006 for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable]], and drew heavy inspiration from ''Tokyo Drift''. The game sold moderately and opened to mixed reviews.\n\nNotably, several games have been released for mobile gaming, with a number available for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, with the unlicensed tie-ins ''The Fast and the Furious: Pink Slip'', ''Fast & Furious'', ''Fast Five'' and ''Fast & Furious: Adrenaline''.

The franchise also includes short films, a television series, live shows, video games and theme park attractions. It is distributed by [[Universal Pictures]].\n\nThe [[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|first film]] was released in 2001, which began the original trilogy of films focused on racing, and culminated in the standalone film ''[[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift]]'' (2006). The series then went under a soft reboot with ''[[Fast & Furious (2009 film)|Fast & Furious]]'' (2009), which transitioned the series toward heists and spying, and was followed by four sequels. Another sequel is set to be released in 2021, with a tenth and final film also planned. The main films are collectively known as ''The Fast Saga''.\n\nUniversal expanded the series to include the spin-off film ''[[Hobbs & Shaw]]'' (2019), while its subsidiary [[DreamWorks Animation]] followed this with the animated web television series ''[[Fast & Furious Spy Racers]]''. Soundtrack albums have been released for all the films, as well as compilation albums containing existing music heard in the films. Two [[short film]]s that tie into the series have also been released.\n\nThe series has been commercially successful and is Universal's biggest franchise, as of 2015 ranking as the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing franchises and film series|ninth-highest-grossing film series of all time]] with a combined gross of over $5 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davegonzales/2015/04/06/furious-7-marks-universals-biggest-franchise-ever/|title='Furious 7' Marks Universal's Biggest Franchise Ever|author=David Gonzales|date=6 April 2015|work=Forbes|accessdate=8 March 2017}}</ref> Critical reception was mostly mixed to negative for the first four films, while later films in the series were more positively received. Outside of the films, ''The Fast Saga'' has been the focus of other media, including attractions at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]], live shows, commercials, many video games and toys.

The studio warmed toward the idea of [[Timothy Olyphant]] in the role of [[Dominic Toretto]], due to the success of the blockbuster ''[[Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 film)|Gone in 60 Seconds]]'' (2000), but he declined. Moritz instead persisted on [[Vin Diesel]] following his performance in ''[[Pitch Black (film)|Pitch Black]]'' (2000), with Diesel accepting after proposing several script changes. Upon release in June 2001, the film shattered box office and critical expectations, and a 2002 sequel was green-lit by September.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Zakarin|first1=Jordan|title=Meet the Writer Who Made 'The Fast and the Furious' Possible|url=https://www.yahoo.com/movies/fast-and-furious-original-article-writer-114662681722.html|accessdate=May 4, 2017|publisher=Yahoo!

Cohen also declined the sequel, opting to develop the film ''[[XXX (2002 film)|xXx]]'' (2002), which starred Diesel in the lead role. To account for these changes, Universal commissioned the writers to create a [[standalone sequel]] with Walker in the lead, and brought in [[John Singleton]] as the new director. As a result, filming was delayed by a year, and [[Tyrese Gibson]], who worked with Singleton on the film ''[[Baby Boy (film)|Baby Boy]]'' (2001), was hired as Walker's new co-star. Furthermore, the production location shifted to [[Miami]], and was also the first entry in the series to feature long-running castmate [[Ludacris]].<ref name=\"Amy Kaufman\"/>\n\nUniversal attempted to bring back Diesel for the third installment, but he again declined due to other projects and a dislike for the script.<ref name=\"Amy Welch\">{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/fast-furious-tokyo-drift-vin-diesel/ |title=Fast & Furious: Tokyo Drift Was Originally Pitched to Star Vin Diesel |author=Amy Welch |date=11 April 2017 |work=ScreenRant |accessdate=3 Aug 2018}}</ref> As a result of failing to secure the returns of any of the original cast, Universal ordered a reboot of the franchise.

While developing the film, Universal wholeheartedly departed from the street racing theme prevalent in previous films, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences that might otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. ''Fast Five'' is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls, and the heist. ''Fast Five'' was initially conceived to conclude the franchise, but following strong box office performance and high critical praise, Universal proceeded to develop a sixth installment.{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=17}} Furthermore, the film is noted for the addition of [[Dwayne Johnson]] to the cast, whose performance was critically praised.<ref name=\"ProductionCollider\">{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/dwayne-johnson-interview-faster-fast-five-the-rundown-2/60304/ |title=Faster the Chronicles: Dwayne Johnson \u2013 Exclusive Interview that Covers Faster, Fast Five, The Other Guys, 3D, More |publisher=Collider |date=November 15, 2010 |accessdate=March 9, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zvaAV9f0?url=http://collider.com/dwayne-johnson-interview-faster-fast-five-the-rundown-2/60304/ |archivedate=July 4, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref><ref name=\"FilmingGeneral\">{{cite news|last=Verrier |first=Richard |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/05/puerto-rico-cruising-on-fast-five-success-.html |title=Puerto Rico hoping to ride box-office success of 'Fast Five' |publisher=Tribune Company |work=Los Angeles Times |date=May 14, 2011 |accessdate=November 13, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6C8MoGFKm?url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/05/puerto-rico-cruising-on-fast-five-success-.html |archivedate=November 13, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2011/04/fast-five-will-transition-franchise-from-street-racing-to-heist-action-125552/#more-125552|title='Fast Five' Will Transition Franchise From Street Racing To Future Full Of Heist Action|author=Nikki Finke|date=25 April 2011|work=Deadline|accessdate=3 Aug 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2011, the ''Los Angeles Times'' reported that Universal was approaching the sixth and seventh installment with a single storyline running through both films, with Morgan envisaging themes of freedom and family,{{Sfn|Production|2011|p=18}} but later shifted to account for the studio's wishes to incorporate elements of espionage. However, Lin revealed that he had, after discussions with Diesel, storyboarded, [[Previsualization|previsualized]], and began editing a twelve-minute finale for ''[[Fast & Furious 6]]'', before filming was completed on ''Fast Five''. The suggestion was discussed to shoot the films [[Back to back film production|back-to-back]], in order to break the traditional the two-year gap between installments, but this notion was abandoned at Lin's request. Upon release, the sixth film became the highest-grossing film in the series.\n\nUniversal lacked a major event movie for 2014, and quickly rushed ''[[Furious 7]]'' into production, due to its status as a bankable asset. As a result, Lin decided not to return to direct the seventh film, as he was still performing post-production on ''Fast & Furious 6''.
