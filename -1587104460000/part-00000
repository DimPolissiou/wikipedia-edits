As he was reciting these verses of [[an-Najm|S\u016brat an-Najm]],<ref>([[wikisource:The Holy Qur'an/An-Najm|Q.53]])</ref> considered a revelation from the angel [[Gabriel]],\n\n: ''Have you thought of [[al-L\u0101t]] and [[al-\u2018Uzz\u00e1]]''\n: ''and [[Man\u0101t]], the third, the other?''\n: ([[Quran 53]], 19\u201320)\n\n[[Shaitan|Satan]] tempted him to utter the following line:\n\n: ''These are the exalted ''ghar\u0101niq'', whose intercession is hoped for.''

It moved their hearts so much, that they instantly fell down on their faces in prostration, and bore witness it was from Allah alone.

He then reported that the preeminent [[Muhaddith]] [[Ibn Khuzaymah]] said: \"it is an invention of the heretics\" when once asked about it. Al-Razi also recorded that [[al-Bayhaqi]] stated that the narration of the story was unreliable because its narrators were of questionable integrity.\n\nThose scholars who acknowledged the historicity of the incident apparently had a different method for the assessment of reports than that which has become standard Islamic methodology. For example, [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] took the position that since tafsir and sira-maghazi reports were commonly transmitted by incomplete isnads, these reports should not be assessed according to the completeness of the chains but rather on the basis of recurrent transmission of common meaning between reports.<ref name=\"EoQ\"/>\n\nAl-Qurtubi (''al-J\u0101mi' li ahk\u0101m al-Qur'\u0101n'') dismisses all these variants in favor of the explanation that once [[Sura 53|S\u016bra al-Najm]] was safely revealed the basic events of the incident (or rumors of them) \"were now permitted to occur to identify those of his followers who would accept Muhammad's explanation of the blasphemous imposture\" (''JSS'' 15, pp.&nbsp;254\u2013255).\n\nWhile Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani wrote: \"All the chains of this narration are weak, except of Said Ibn Jubayr.

Once when the Holy Prophet was reciting verses 19 and 20 of Najm one of the pagans recited: \"Tilkal gharani-ul ula wa inna shafa-atahuma laturja\"-(These are the lofty (idols), verily their intercession is sought after.) As soon as this was recited the conspirators shouted in delight to make the people believe that it was the Holy Prophet who said these words. Here, the Quran is stating the general pattern the enemies of the messengers of Allah followed when they were positively convinced that the people were paying attention to the teachings of the messengers of Allah and sincerely believing in them. They would mix their false doctrines with the original teachings so as to make the divine message a bundle of contradictions. This kind of satanic insertions are referred to in thus verse, and it is supported by Ha Mim: 26.

Brill Online, 2014''</ref>\n\n[[William Montgomery Watt]] and [[Alfred Guillaume]] claim that stories of the event were true based upon the implausibility of Muslims fabricating a story so unflattering to their prophet: \"Muhammad must have publicly recited the satanic verses as part of the Qur'\u0101n; it is unthinkable that the story could have been invented by Muslims, or foisted upon them by non-Muslims.\"<ref name=\"Watt, Muhammad at Mecca\"/> Trude Ehlert, in the [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]], finds Watt's reason to be insufficient, stating \"The story in its present form (as related by al-\u1e6cabar\u012b, al-W\u0101\u1e33id\u012b, and Ibn Sa\u02bfd) cannot be accepted as historical for a variety of reasons\".<ref>\"Mu\u1e25ammad.\" Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition.

Reference.</ref>\n\nRegarding this argument, Shahab Ahmed in the ''[[Encyclopaedia of the Qur'\u0101n]]'' counters that \"the widespread acceptance of the incident by early Muslims suggests, however, that they did not view the incident as inauspicious and that they would presumably not have, on this basis at least, been adverse <!--[sic] yes, sic, he is saying it *may* be invented--> to inventing it.\"<ref name=\"EoQ\" /> \nSimilarly, [[Alford T. Welch]], in the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', argues that the \"implausibility\" argument alone is insufficient to guarantee the tradition's authenticity.<ref name=\"W-EOI\">\"Muhammad\", ''Encyclopedia of Islam Online''.</ref> He says that the story in its present form is certainly a later, exegetical fabrication despite the fact that there could be some historical basis for the story.\n\nWelch states that the story falsely claims that the chapter 53:1\u201320 and the end of the chapter are a unity, and that the date for the verse 22:52 is later than 53:21\u20137 and almost certainly belongs to the Medinan period. Several other details in the setting of the story, such as the mosque and the sajda, do not belong to the Meccan phase of Muhammad's career.<ref>Encyclopedia of Islam, \"al-Kuran\"</ref> Welch also points out that the story was not mentioned in the [[Ibn Ishaq]]'s biography of Muhammad. He says that the above analysis does not rule out \"the possibility of some historical kernel behind the story.\" One such possibility, Welch says, is that the story is of a historical telescoping nature: \"that a situation that was known by Muhammad's contemporaries to have lasted for a long period of time later came to be encapsulated in a story that restricts his acceptance of intercession through these goddesses to a brief period of time and places the responsibility for this departure from a strict monotheism on Satan.\"<ref name=\"W-EOI\"/>\n\nJohn Burton argued for its fictitiousness based upon a demonstration of its actual utility to certain elements of the Muslim community \u2013 namely, those legal exegetes seeking an \"occasion of revelation\" for eradicative modes of abrogation.{{explain|date=May 2018}} Burton supports his theory by the fact that Tabari does not discuss the story in his exegesis of the verse 53:20, but rather in 22:52. Burton further notes that different versions of the story are all tracable to one single narrator Muhammad ibn Ka'b, two generations removed from Ibn Ishaq, but not contemporary with the event.<ref>Burton, \"Those are the high-flying cranes\", ''Journal of Semitic Studies (JSS)'' 15</ref> G.R. Hawting writes that the satanic verses incident would not serve to justify or exemplify a theory that God reveals something and later replaces it himself with another true revelation.<ref>G.R. Hawting, ''The Idea of Idolatry and the Emergence of Islam.'' Cambridge University Press, 1999, page 135.</ref> Burton, in his rejection of the authenticity of the story, sided with [[Leone Caetani]], who wrote that the story was to be rejected not only on the basis of ''isnad'', but because \"had these hadiths even a degree of historical basis, Muhammad's reported conduct on this occasion would have given the lie to the whole of his previous prophetic activity.\"<ref>Quoted by I.R Netton in \"Text and Trauma: An East-West Primer\" (1996) p. 86, Routledge</ref>\n\n[[Maxime Rodinson]] finds that it may reasonably be accepted as true \"because the makers of Muslim tradition would never have invented a story with such damaging implications for the revelation as a whole.\"<ref>Maxime Rodinson, ''Mohammed.'' Allen Lane the Penguin Press, 1961, page 106.</ref> He writes the following on the genesis of the verses: \"Obviously Muhammad's unconscious had suggested to him a formula which provided a practical road to unanimity.\" Rodinson writes that this concession, however, diminished the threat of the [[Qiyamah|Last Judgment]] by enabling the three goddesses to intercede for sinners and save them from eternal damnation. Further, it diminished Muhammad's own authority by giving the priests of Uzza, Manat, and Allat the ability to pronounce oracles contradicting his message. Disparagement from Christians and Jews, who pointed out{{where|date=May 2018}} that he was reverting to his pagan beginnings, combined with opposition and indignation from his own followers influenced him to recant his revelation. However, in doing so he denounced the gods of Mecca as lesser spirits or mere names, cast off everything related to the traditional religion as the work of pagans and unbelievers, and consigned the Meccan's pious ancestors and relatives to Hell. This was the final break with the [[Quraysh]].<ref>Maxime Rodinson, ''Mohammed.'' Allen Lane the Penguin Press, 1961, pages 107-8.</ref>\n\n[[Fred Halliday]] states that rather than having damaging implications, the story is a cautionary tale, the point of which is \"not to malign God but to point up the frailty of human beings,\" and that even a prophet may be misled by [[shaytan]] \u2014 though ultimately shaytan is unsuccessful.<ref>Halliday, Fred, ''100 Myths about the Middle East'',</ref>\n\nSince [[John Wansbrough]]'s contributions to the field in the early 1970s, though, scholars have become much more attentive to the emergent nature of early Islam, and less willing to accept back-projected claims of continuity:\n\n<blockquote>To those who see the tradition as constantly evolving and supplying answers to question that it itself has raised, the argument that there would be no reason to develop and transmit material which seems derogatory of the Prophet or of Islam is too simple.  For one thing, ideas about what is derogatory may change over time.  We know that the doctrine of the Prophet's infallibility and impeccability (the doctrine regarding his ''[[ismah|'isma]]'') emerged only slowly.  For another, material which we now find in the biography of the Prophet originated in various circumstances to meet various needs and one has to understand why material exists before one can make a judgment about its basis in fact...\n<ref>G. R. Hawting, ''The Idea of Idolatry and the Emergence of Islam: From Polemic to History'', pp. 134-135</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn Rubin's recent contribution to the debate, questions of historicity are completely eschewed in favor of an examination of internal textual dynamics and what they reveal about [[early medieval Islam]]. Rubin claims to have located the genesis of many prophetic traditions and that they show an early Muslim desire to prove to other scriptuaries \"that Muhammad did indeed belong to the same exclusive predestined chain of prophets in whom the [[Jew]]s and the [[Christians]] believed. He alleges that the Muslims had to establish the story of Muhammad's life on the same literary patterns as were used in the ''vitae'' of the other prophets\".<ref>''Eye of the Beholder'', p. 21</ref> The incident of the Satanic Verses, according to him, conforms to the common theme of persecution followed by isolation of the prophet-figure.\n\nAs the story was adapted to include Qur'\u0101nic material (Q.22:50, Q.53, Q.17:73-74), the idea of satanic temptation was claimed{{by whom|date=May 2018}} to have been added, heightening its inherent drama as well as incorporating additional Biblical motifs (cf. the [[Temptation of Christ]]). Rubin gives his attention to the [[narratology|narratological]] exigencies which may have shaped early ''s\u012bra'' material, as opposed to the more commonly considered ones of dogma, sect, and political/[[List of Muslim Dynasties|dynastic]] faction. Given the consensus that \"the most archaic layer of the biography, [is] that of the stories of the ''[[Q\u0101\u1e63\u1e63|kuss\u0101s]]'' [i.e. popular story-tellers]\" (''S\u012bra'', ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam|EI]]\u00b2''), this may prove a fruitful line of inquiry.\n\nThe Encyclopedia of Islam claims that, although there could be some historical basis for the story, in its present form it is certainly a later, exegetical fabrication. ''S\u016bra'' LIII, 1-20 and the end of the ''s\u016bra'' are not a unity, as is claimed by the story; XXII, 52, is later than LIII, 21-7, and is almost certainly [[Medina]]n (see Bell, ''Trans.'', 316, 322); and several details of the story- the mosque, the ''[[sujud|sajda]]'', and others not mentioned in the short summary above- do not belong to the Meccan phase.<ref>\"Kuran\" in the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', 2nd Edition, Vol. 5 (1986), p. 404</ref>\n\nRubin also claimed that the supposed temporary control taken by Satan over Muhammad made such traditions unacceptable to early hadith compilers, which he believed to be a unique case in which a group of traditions are rejected only after being subject to Qur'anic models, and as a direct result of this adjustment.<ref name=\"EoB\"/>\n\n==Related traditions==\nSeveral related traditions exist, some adapted to Qur'\u0101nic material, some not. One version, appearing in Tabar\u012b's ''Tafs\u012br''<ref>''Tafsir'', Vol. IX</ref> and attributed to [[Urwah ibn Zubayr]] (d. 713), preserves the basic narrative but with no mention of satanic temptation.  Muhammad is persecuted by the Meccans after attacking their idols, during which time a group of Muslims seeks refuge in Abyssinia.  After the cessation of this first round of persecution (''[[fitna (word)|fitna]]'') they return home, but soon a second round begins.  No compelling reason is provided for the caesura of persecution, though, unlike in the incident of the satanic verses, where it is the (temporary) fruit of Muhammad's accommodation to Meccan polytheism.  Another version attributed to 'Urwa has only one round of ''fitna'', which begins after Muhammad has converted the entire population of Mecca, so that the Muslims are too numerous to perform ritual prostration (''[[sujud|s\u016bjud]]'') all together. This somewhat parallels the Muslims and ''mushrik\u016bn'' prostrating themselves together after Muhammad's first, allegedly satanically infected, recitation of ''[[Sura 53|S\u016bra al-Najm]]'', in which the efficacy of the three pagan goddesses is acknowledged (Rubin, pp.&nbsp;157\u2013158).\n\nThe image of Muslims and pagans prostrating themselves together in prayer in turn links the story of the satanic verses to very abbreviated ''s\u016bjud al-Qur'\u0101n'' (i.e. prostration when reciting the Qur'\u0101n) traditions found in the authoritative ''[[mussanaf]]'' ''had\u012bth'' collections, including the Sunni canonical ones of [[Muhammad ibn Ismail al-Bukhari|Bukh\u0101ri]] and [[Tirmidhi|Tirmidh\u012b]]. Rubin claims that apparently \"the allusion to the participation of the ''mushrik\u016bn'' emphasises how overwhelming and intense the effect of this ''s\u016bra'' was on those attending\".  The traditions actually state that all cognizant creatures took part in it, humans as well as jinns.<ref>Rubin, p. 165.</ref>\n\nRubin further argues that this is inherently illogical without the Satanic Verses in the recitation, given that in the accepted version of verses Q.53:19-23, the pagans' goddesses are attacked. The majority of traditions relating to prostration at the end of ''S\u016bra al-Najm'' solve this by either removing all mention of the ''mushrik\u016bn'', or else transforming the attempt of an old Meccan to participate (who, instead of bowing to the ground, puts dirt to his forehead proclaiming \"This is sufficient for me\") into an act of mockery. Some traditions even describe his eventual comeuppance, saying he is later killed at the [[battle of Badr]].\n[http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/019.sbt.html] Thus, according to Rubin, \"the story of the single polytheist who raised a handful of dirt to his forehead\u2026 [in]\u2026 attempt of an old disabled man to participate in Muhammad's ''s\u016bjud''\u2026 in\u2026  a sarcastic act of an enemy of Muhammad wishing to dishonor the Islamic prayer\". And \"traditions which originally related the dramatic story of temptation became a sterilized anecdote providing prophetic precedent for a ritual practice\".<ref>Rubin, p. 166</ref>\n\n==Tabar\u012b's account==\n\nAn extensive account of the incident is found in [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tab\u0101ri's]] history, the ''Ta'r\u012bkh'' (Vol. I)(circa 915 CE):\n\n{{bquote|The prophet was eager for the welfare of his people, desiring to win them to him by any means he could. It has been reported that he longed for a way to win them, and part of what he did to that end is what Ibn Humayd told me, from Salama, from [[Ibn Ishaq|Muhammad ibn Ishaq]], from Yaz\u012bd ibn Ziy\u0101d al-Madan\u012b, from Muhammad ibn Ka'b al-Quraz\u012b:\n\nWhen the prophet saw his people turning away from him, and was tormented by their distancing themselves from what he had brought to them from [[Allah|God]], he longed in himself for something to come to him from God which would draw him close to them. With his love for his people and his eagerness for them, it would gladden him if some of the hard things he had found in dealing with them could be alleviated. He pondered this in himself, longed for it, and desired it.\n\nThen God sent down the revelation. 'By the star when it sets!  Your companion has not erred or gone astray, and does not speak from mere fancy\u2026' [Q.53:1]  When he reached God's words, \"Have you seen al-L\u0101t and al-'Uzz\u0101 and Man\u0101t, the third, the other?' [Q.53:19-20] Satan cast upon his tongue, because of what he had pondered in himself and longed to bring to his people, 'These are the high-flying cranes and their intercession is to be hoped for.'\n\nWhen [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] heard that, they rejoiced. What he had said about their gods pleased and delighted them, and they gave ear to him. The Believers trusted in their prophet with respect to what he brought them from their Lord: they did not suspect any slip, delusion or error. When he came to the prostration and finished the chapter, he prostrated and the Muslims followed their prophet in it, having faith in what he brought them and obeying his command. Those ''[[shirk (polytheism)|mushrik\u016bn]]'' of Quraysh and others who were in the mosque also prostrated on account of what they had heard him say about their gods. In the whole mosque there was no believer or [[kafir|k\u0101fir]] who did not prostrate. Only al-Wal\u012bd bin al-Mugh\u012bra, who was an aged [[sheikh|shaykh]] and could not make prostration, scooped up in his hand some of the soil from the valley of Mecca [and pressed it to his forehead]. Then everybody dispersed from the mosque.\n\nQuraysh went out and were delighted by what they had heard of the way in which he spoke of their gods. They were saying, 'Muhammad has referred to our gods most favourably. In what he has recited he said that they are \"high-flying [[crane (bird)|cranes]] whose intercession is to be hoped for\".'\n\nThose followers of the Prophet who had emigrated to the land of Abyssinia heard about the affair of the prostration, and it was reported to them that Quraysh had accepted Islam. Some men among them decided to return while others remained behind.\n\nGabriel came to the Prophet and said, 'O Muhammad, what have you done! You have recited to the people something which I have not brought you from God, and you have spoken what He did not say to you.'\n\nAt that the Prophet was mightily saddened and greatly feared God. But  God, of His mercy, sent him a revelation, comforting him and diminishing the magnitude of what had happened. God told him that there had never been a [[Prophet#Islam|previous prophet or apostle]] who had longed just as Muhammad had longed, and desired just as Muhammad had desired, but that Satan had cast into his longing just as he had cast onto the tongue of Muhammad. But God abrogates what Satan has cast, and puts His verses in proper order.  That is, 'you are just like other prophets and apostles.'\n\nAnd God revealed: 'We never sent any apostle or prophet before you but that, when he longed, Satan cast into his longing. But God [[naskh (exegesis)|abrogates]] what Satan casts in, and then God puts His verses in proper order, for God is all-knowing and wise.' [Q.22:52]\n\nSo God drove out the sadness from His prophet and gave him security against what he feared.  He abrogated what Satan had cast upon his tongue in referring to their gods: 'They are the high-flying cranes whose intercession is accepted {{sic}}'. [Replacing those words with] the words of God when All\u0101t, al-'Uzz\u0101 and Man\u0101t the third, the other are mentioned: 'Should you have males and He females [as offspring]! That, indeed, would be an unfair division. They are only names which you and your fathers have given them'\u2026 as far as 'As many as are the angels in heaven, their intercession shall be of no avail unless after God has permitted it to whom He pleases and accepts' [Q.53:21-26]- meaning, how can the intercession of their gods be of any avail with Him?\n\nWhen there had come from God the words which abrogated what Satan had cast on to the tongue of His prophet, Quraysh said, 'Muhammad has gone back on what he said about the status of our gods relative to God, changed it and brought something else', for the two phrases which Satan had cast on to the tongue of the Prophet had found a place in the mouth of every polytheist. They, therefore, increased in their evil and in their [[Fitna (word)|oppression]] of everyone among them who had accepted Islam and followed the Prophet.\n\nThe band of the Prophet's followers who had left the land of Abyssinia on account of the report that the people of Mecca had accepted Islam when they prostrated together with the Prophet drew near.  But when they approached Mecca they heard that the talk about the acceptance of Islam by the people of Mecca was wrong.  Therefore, they only entered Mecca in secret or after having obtained a promise of protection.\n\nAmong those of them who came to Mecca at that time and remained there until emigrating to Medina and taking part in the battle of Badr alongside Muhammad there was, from the family of 'Abd Shams b. Abd Man\u0101f b. Qussayy, [[Uthman|'Uthm\u0101n b. 'Aff\u0101n]] together with his wife [[Ruqayyah bint Muhammad|Ruqayya]] the daughter of the Prophet. Ab\u016b Hudhayfa b. 'Utba with his wife Shal bint Suhayl, and another group with them, numbering together 33 men.<ref>translated in G. R.

For example, [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] took the position that since tafsir and sira-maghazi reports were commonly transmitted by incomplete isnads, these reports should not be assessed according to the completeness of the chains but rather on the basis of recurrent transmission of common meaning between reports.<ref name=\"EoQ\"/>\n\nAl-Qurtubi (''al-J\u0101mi' li ahk\u0101m al-Qur'\u0101n'') dismisses all these variants in favor of the explanation that once [[Sura 53|S\u016bra al-Najm]] was safely revealed the basic events of the incident (or rumors of them) \"were now permitted to occur to identify those of his followers who would accept Muhammad's explanation of the blasphemous imposture\" (''JSS'' 15, pp.&nbsp;254\u2013255).\n\nWhile Ibn Hajar al-Asqallani wrote: \"All the chains of this narration are weak, except of Said Ibn Jubayr.

Once when the Holy Prophet was reciting verses 19 and 20 of Najm one of the pagans recited: \"Tilkal gharani-ul ula wa inna shafa-atahuma laturja\"-(These are the lofty (idols), verily their intercession is sought after.) As soon as this was recited the conspirators shouted in delight to make the people believe that it was the Holy Prophet who said these words. Here, the Quran is stating the general pattern the enemies of the messengers of Allah followed when they were positively convinced that the people were paying attention to the teachings of the messengers of Allah and sincerely believing in them. They would mix their false doctrines with the original teachings so as to make the divine message a bundle of contradictions. This kind of satanic insertions are referred to in thus verse, and it is supported by Ha Mim: 26. It is sheer blasphemy to say that satanic forces can influence the messengers of Allah.<ref>{{citation|title=Aqa Mahdi Puya view, Satanic Verses |url=http://www.concentrationinprayer.com/documents/Verse43.pdf |first=Aqa Mahdi. |last=Puya |year=2008 |publisher=Mahdi Puya |format= }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/quran/|title=Multilingual Quran|website=www.al-islam.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225002128/http://www.al-islam.org/Quran/|archivedate=25 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThis entire matter was a mere footnote to the back-and-forth of religious debate,{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} and was rekindled only when [[Salman Rushdie]]'s 1988 novel, ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'', made headline news.

Welch]], in the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', argues that the \"implausibility\" argument alone is insufficient to guarantee the tradition's authenticity.<ref name=\"W-EOI\">\"Muhammad\", ''Encyclopedia of Islam Online''.</ref> He says that the story in its present form is certainly a later, exegetical fabrication despite the fact that there could be some historical basis for the story.\n\nWelch states that the story falsely claims that the chapter 53:1\u201320 and the end of the chapter are a unity, and that the date for the verse 22:52 is later than 53:21\u20137 and almost certainly belongs to the Medinan period. Several other details in the setting of the story, such as the mosque and the sajda, do not belong to the Meccan phase of Muhammad's career.<ref>Encyclopedia of Islam, \"al-Kuran\"</ref> Welch also points out that the story was not mentioned in the [[Ibn Ishaq]]'s biography of Muhammad. He says that the above analysis does not rule out \"the possibility of some historical kernel behind the story.\" One such possibility, Welch says, is that the story is of a historical telescoping nature: \"that a situation that was known by Muhammad's contemporaries to have lasted for a long period of time later came to be encapsulated in a story that restricts his acceptance of intercession through these goddesses to a brief period of time and places the responsibility for this departure from a strict monotheism on Satan.\"<ref name=\"W-EOI\"/>\n\nJohn Burton argued for its fictitiousness based upon a demonstration of its actual utility to certain elements of the Muslim community \u2013 namely, those legal exegetes seeking an \"occasion of revelation\" for eradicative modes of abrogation.{{explain|date=May 2018}} Burton supports his theory by the fact that Tabari does not discuss the story in his exegesis of the verse 53:20, but rather in 22:52. Burton further notes that different versions of the story are all tracable to one single narrator Muhammad ibn Ka'b, two generations removed from Ibn Ishaq, but not contemporary with the event.<ref>Burton, \"Those are the high-flying cranes\", ''Journal of Semitic Studies (JSS)'' 15</ref> G.R. Hawting writes that the satanic verses incident would not serve to justify or exemplify a theory that God reveals something and later replaces it himself with another true revelation.<ref>G.R. Hawting, ''The Idea of Idolatry and the Emergence of Islam.'' Cambridge University Press, 1999, page 135.</ref> Burton, in his rejection of the authenticity of the story, sided with [[Leone Caetani]], who wrote that the story was to be rejected not only on the basis of ''isnad'', but because \"had these hadiths even a degree of historical basis, Muhammad's reported conduct on this occasion would have given the lie to the whole of his previous prophetic activity.\"<ref>Quoted by I.R Netton in \"Text and Trauma: An East-West Primer\" (1996) p. 86, Routledge</ref>\n\n[[Maxime Rodinson]] finds that it may reasonably be accepted as true \"because the makers of Muslim tradition would never have invented a story with such damaging implications for the revelation as a whole.\"<ref>Maxime Rodinson, ''Mohammed.'' Allen Lane the Penguin Press, 1961, page 106.</ref> He writes the following on the genesis of the verses: \"Obviously Muhammad's unconscious had suggested to him a formula which provided a practical road to unanimity.\" Rodinson writes that this concession, however, diminished the threat of the [[Qiyamah|Last Judgment]] by enabling the three goddesses to intercede for sinners and save them from eternal damnation. Further, it diminished Muhammad's own authority by giving the priests of Uzza, Manat, and Allat the ability to pronounce oracles contradicting his message. Disparagement from Christians and Jews, who pointed out{{where|date=May 2018}} that he was reverting to his pagan beginnings, combined with opposition and indignation from his own followers influenced him to recant his revelation. However, in doing so he denounced the gods of Mecca as lesser spirits or mere names, cast off everything related to the traditional religion as the work of pagans and unbelievers, and consigned the Meccan's pious ancestors and relatives to Hell. This was the final break with the [[Quraysh]].<ref>Maxime Rodinson, ''Mohammed.'' Allen Lane the Penguin Press, 1961, pages 107-8.</ref>\n\n[[Fred Halliday]] states that rather than having damaging implications, the story is a cautionary tale, the point of which is \"not to malign God but to point up the frailty of human beings,\" and that even a prophet may be misled by [[shaytan]] \u2014 though ultimately shaytan is unsuccessful.<ref>Halliday, Fred, ''100 Myths about the Middle East'',</ref>\n\nSince [[John Wansbrough]]'s contributions to the field in the early 1970s, though, scholars have become much more attentive to the emergent nature of early Islam, and less willing to accept back-projected claims of continuity:\n\n<blockquote>To those who see the tradition as constantly evolving and supplying answers to question that it itself has raised, the argument that there would be no reason to develop and transmit material which seems derogatory of the Prophet or of Islam is too simple.  For one thing, ideas about what is derogatory may change over time.  We know that the doctrine of the Prophet's infallibility and impeccability (the doctrine regarding his ''[[ismah|'isma]]'') emerged only slowly.  For another, material which we now find in the biography of the Prophet originated in various circumstances to meet various needs and one has to understand why material exists before one can make a judgment about its basis in fact...\n<ref>G. R. Hawting, ''The Idea of Idolatry and the Emergence of Islam: From Polemic to History'', pp. 134-135</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn Rubin's recent contribution to the debate, questions of historicity are completely eschewed in favor of an examination of internal textual dynamics and what they reveal about [[early medieval Islam]]. Rubin claims to have located the genesis of many prophetic traditions and that they show an early Muslim desire to prove to other scriptuaries \"that Muhammad did indeed belong to the same exclusive predestined chain of prophets in whom the [[Jew]]s and the [[Christians]] believed. He alleges that the Muslims had to establish the story of Muhammad's life on the same literary patterns as were used in the ''vitae'' of the other prophets\".<ref>''Eye of the Beholder'', p. 21</ref> The incident of the Satanic Verses, according to him, conforms to the common theme of persecution followed by isolation of the prophet-figure.\n\nAs the story was adapted to include Qur'\u0101nic material (Q.22:50, Q.53, Q.17:73-74), the idea of satanic temptation was claimed{{by whom|date=May 2018}} to have been added, heightening its inherent drama as well as incorporating additional Biblical motifs (cf. the [[Temptation of Christ]]). Rubin gives his attention to the [[narratology|narratological]] exigencies which may have shaped early ''s\u012bra'' material, as opposed to the more commonly considered ones of dogma, sect, and political/[[List of Muslim Dynasties|dynastic]] faction. Given the consensus that \"the most archaic layer of the biography, [is] that of the stories of the ''[[Q\u0101\u1e63\u1e63|kuss\u0101s]]'' [i.e. popular story-tellers]\" (''S\u012bra'', ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam|EI]]\u00b2''), this may prove a fruitful line of inquiry.\n\nThe Encyclopedia of Islam claims that, although there could be some historical basis for the story, in its present form it is certainly a later, exegetical fabrication. ''S\u016bra'' LIII, 1-20 and the end of the ''s\u016bra'' are not a unity, as is claimed by the story; XXII, 52, is later than LIII, 21-7, and is almost certainly [[Medina]]n (see Bell, ''Trans.'', 316, 322); and several details of the story- the mosque, the ''[[sujud|sajda]]'', and others not mentioned in the short summary above- do not belong to the Meccan phase.<ref>\"Kuran\" in the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', 2nd Edition, Vol. 5 (1986), p. 404</ref>\n\nRubin also claimed that the supposed temporary control taken by Satan over Muhammad made such traditions unacceptable to early hadith compilers, which he believed to be a unique case in which a group of traditions are rejected only after being subject to Qur'anic models, and as a direct result of this adjustment.<ref name=\"EoB\"/>\n\n==Related traditions==\nSeveral related traditions exist, some adapted to Qur'\u0101nic material, some not. One version, appearing in Tabar\u012b's ''Tafs\u012br''<ref>''Tafsir'', Vol. IX</ref> and attributed to [[Urwah ibn Zubayr]] (d. 713), preserves the basic narrative but with no mention of satanic temptation.  Muhammad is persecuted by the Meccans after attacking their idols, during which time a group of Muslims seeks refuge in Abyssinia.  After the cessation of this first round of persecution (''[[fitna (word)|fitna]]'') they return home, but soon a second round begins.  No compelling reason is provided for the caesura of persecution, though, unlike in the incident of the satanic verses, where it is the (temporary) fruit of Muhammad's accommodation to Meccan polytheism.  Another version attributed to 'Urwa has only one round of ''fitna'', which begins after Muhammad has converted the entire population of Mecca, so that the Muslims are too numerous to perform ritual prostration (''[[sujud|s\u016bjud]]'') all together. This somewhat parallels the Muslims and ''mushrik\u016bn'' prostrating themselves together after Muhammad's first, allegedly satanically infected, recitation of ''[[Sura 53|S\u016bra al-Najm]]'', in which the efficacy of the three pagan goddesses is acknowledged (Rubin, pp.&nbsp;157\u2013158).\n\nThe image of Muslims and pagans prostrating themselves together in prayer in turn links the story of the satanic verses to very abbreviated ''s\u016bjud al-Qur'\u0101n'' (i.e. prostration when reciting the Qur'\u0101n) traditions found in the authoritative ''[[mussanaf]]'' ''had\u012bth'' collections, including the Sunni canonical ones of [[Muhammad ibn Ismail al-Bukhari|Bukh\u0101ri]] and [[Tirmidhi|Tirmidh\u012b]]. Rubin claims that apparently \"the allusion to the participation of the ''mushrik\u016bn'' emphasises how overwhelming and intense the effect of this ''s\u016bra'' was on those attending\".  The traditions actually state that all cognizant creatures took part in it, humans as well as jinns.<ref>Rubin, p. 165.</ref>\n\nRubin further argues that this is inherently illogical without the Satanic Verses in the recitation, given that in the accepted version of verses Q.53:19-23, the pagans' goddesses are attacked. The majority of traditions relating to prostration at the end of ''S\u016bra al-Najm'' solve this by either removing all mention of the ''mushrik\u016bn'', or else transforming the attempt of an old Meccan to participate (who, instead of bowing to the ground, puts dirt to his forehead proclaiming \"This is sufficient for me\") into an act of mockery. Some traditions even describe his eventual comeuppance, saying he is later killed at the [[battle of Badr]].\n[http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/019.sbt.html] Thus, according to Rubin, \"the story of the single polytheist who raised a handful of dirt to his forehead\u2026 [in]\u2026 attempt of an old disabled man to participate in Muhammad's ''s\u016bjud''\u2026 in\u2026  a sarcastic act of an enemy of Muhammad wishing to dishonor the Islamic prayer\". And \"traditions which originally related the dramatic story of temptation became a sterilized anecdote providing prophetic precedent for a ritual practice\".<ref>Rubin, p. 166</ref>\n\n==Tabar\u012b's account==\n\nAn extensive account of the incident is found in [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tab\u0101ri's]] history, the ''Ta'r\u012bkh'' (Vol. I)(circa 915 CE):\n\n{{bquote|The prophet was eager for the welfare of his people, desiring to win them to him by any means he could. It has been reported that he longed for a way to win them, and part of what he did to that end is what Ibn Humayd told me, from Salama, from [[Ibn Ishaq|Muhammad ibn Ishaq]], from Yaz\u012bd ibn Ziy\u0101d al-Madan\u012b, from Muhammad ibn Ka'b al-Quraz\u012b:\n\nWhen the prophet saw his people turning away from him, and was tormented by their distancing themselves from what he had brought to them from [[Allah|God]], he longed in himself for something to come to him from God which would draw him close to them. With his love for his people and his eagerness for them, it would gladden him if some of the hard things he had found in dealing with them could be alleviated. He pondered this in himself, longed for it, and desired it.\n\nThen God sent down the revelation. 'By the star when it sets!  Your companion has not erred or gone astray, and does not speak from mere fancy\u2026' [Q.53:1]  When he reached God's words, \"Have you seen al-L\u0101t and al-'Uzz\u0101 and Man\u0101t, the third, the other?' [Q.53:19-20] Satan cast upon his tongue, because of what he had pondered in himself and longed to bring to his people, 'These are the high-flying cranes and their intercession is to be hoped for.'\n\nWhen [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] heard that, they rejoiced. What he had said about their gods pleased and delighted them, and they gave ear to him. The Believers trusted in their prophet with respect to what he brought them from their Lord: they did not suspect any slip, delusion or error. When he came to the prostration and finished the chapter, he prostrated and the Muslims followed their prophet in it, having faith in what he brought them and obeying his command. Those ''[[shirk (polytheism)|mushrik\u016bn]]'' of Quraysh and others who were in the mosque also prostrated on account of what they had heard him say about their gods. In the whole mosque there was no believer or [[kafir|k\u0101fir]] who did not prostrate. Only al-Wal\u012bd bin al-Mugh\u012bra, who was an aged [[sheikh|shaykh]] and could not make prostration, scooped up in his hand some of the soil from the valley of Mecca [and pressed it to his forehead]. Then everybody dispersed from the mosque.\n\nQuraysh went out and were delighted by what they had heard of the way in which he spoke of their gods. They were saying, 'Muhammad has referred to our gods most favourably. In what he has recited he said that they are \"high-flying [[crane (bird)|cranes]] whose intercession is to be hoped for\".'\n\nThose followers of the Prophet who had emigrated to the land of Abyssinia heard about the affair of the prostration, and it was reported to them that Quraysh had accepted Islam. Some men among them decided to return while others remained behind.\n\nGabriel came to the Prophet and said, 'O Muhammad, what have you done! You have recited to the people something which I have not brought you from God, and you have spoken what He did not say to you.'\n\nAt that the Prophet was mightily saddened and greatly feared God. But  God, of His mercy, sent him a revelation, comforting him and diminishing the magnitude of what had happened. God told him that there had never been a [[Prophet#Islam|previous prophet or apostle]] who had longed just as Muhammad had longed, and desired just as Muhammad had desired, but that Satan had cast into his longing just as he had cast onto the tongue of Muhammad. But God abrogates what Satan has cast, and puts His verses in proper order.  That is, 'you are just like other prophets and apostles.'\n\nAnd God revealed: 'We never sent any apostle or prophet before you but that, when he longed, Satan cast into his longing. But God [[naskh (exegesis)|abrogates]] what Satan casts in, and then God puts His verses in proper order, for God is all-knowing and wise.' [Q.22:52]\n\nSo God drove out the sadness from His prophet and gave him security against what he feared.  He abrogated what Satan had cast upon his tongue in referring to their gods: 'They are the high-flying cranes whose intercession is accepted {{sic}}'. [Replacing those words with] the words of God when All\u0101t, al-'Uzz\u0101 and Man\u0101t the third, the other are mentioned: 'Should you have males and He females [as offspring]! That, indeed, would be an unfair division. They are only names which you and your fathers have given them'\u2026 as far as 'As many as are the angels in heaven, their intercession shall be of no avail unless after God has permitted it to whom He pleases and accepts' [Q.53:21-26]- meaning, how can the intercession of their gods be of any avail with Him?\n\nWhen there had come from God the words which abrogated what Satan had cast on to the tongue of His prophet, Quraysh said, 'Muhammad has gone back on what he said about the status of our gods relative to God, changed it and brought something else', for the two phrases which Satan had cast on to the tongue of the Prophet had found a place in the mouth of every polytheist. They, therefore, increased in their evil and in their [[Fitna (word)|oppression]] of everyone among them who had accepted Islam and followed the Prophet.\n\nThe band of the Prophet's followers who had left the land of Abyssinia on account of the report that the people of Mecca had accepted Islam when they prostrated together with the Prophet drew near.  But when they approached Mecca they heard that the talk about the acceptance of Islam by the people of Mecca was wrong.  Therefore, they only entered Mecca in secret or after having obtained a promise of protection.\n\nAmong those of them who came to Mecca at that time and remained there until emigrating to Medina and taking part in the battle of Badr alongside Muhammad there was, from the family of 'Abd Shams b.
