This is the value of all final [[goods and services]] produced within a nation in a given year, converted at market [[exchange rate]]s to current [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]], divided by the average population for the same year.\n\nThe figures presented here do not take into account differences in the [[cost of living]] in different countries, and the results vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the [[exchange rate]]s of the country's [[currency]]. Such fluctuations change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference to the standard of living of its population.\n\nTherefore, these figures should be used with caution. GDP per capita is often considered an indicator of a country's [[standard of living]];<ref>{{citation |title=O'Sullivan, Arthur}}</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/sep/14/sarkozy-attacks-gdp-focus French President seeks alternatives to GDP], [[The Guardian]] 14-09-2009.<br/>{{cite web|url= http://www.beyond-gdp.eu/download/bgdp-bp-goossens.pdf |title=European Parliament, Policy Department Economic and Scientific Policy: Beyond GDP Study }}&nbsp;{{small|(1.47&nbsp;MB)}}</ref> although this is problematic because GDP per capita [[Gross domestic product#Standard of living and GDP: Wealth distribution and externalities|is not a measure of personal income]].\n\nComparisons of national income are also frequently made on the basis of [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. (''See'' [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita]].) PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem but not others; it does not reflect the value of economic output in [[international trade]], and it also requires more estimation than GDP per capita. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are more narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\n\nNon-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some [[dependent territory|dependent territories]]) and states with limited international recognition (such as [[Kosovo]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Taiwan]]) are included in the list in cases in which they appear in the sources. These economies are not ranked in the charts here, but are listed in sequence by GDP for comparison. In addition, non-sovereign entities are marked in ''italics''.\n\nNote that the Irish GDP data below is subject to material distortion by the [[Tax avoidance|tax planning]] activities of foreign multinationals in Ireland. 2015 Irish GDP is over 150% of 2015 Irish GNI. To address this, in 2017 the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] created \"[[Modified gross national income|modified GNI]]\" (or GNI*) as a more appropriate statistic, and the OECD and IMF have adopted it for Ireland. 2015 Irish GDP is 143% of 2015 Irish GNI*.\n\nAll data are in current [[United States dollar|United States dollars]].

This is the value of all final [[goods and services]] produced within a nation in a given year, converted at market [[exchange rate]]s to current [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]], divided by the average population for the same year.\n\nThe figures presented here do not take into account differences in the [[cost of living]] in different countries, and the results vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the [[exchange rate]]s of the country's [[currency]]. Such fluctuations change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference to the standard of living of its population.\n\nTherefore, these figures should be used with caution. GDP per capita is often considered an indicator of a country's [[standard of living]];<ref>{{citation |title=O'Sullivan, Arthur}}</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/sep/14/sarkozy-attacks-gdp-focus French President seeks alternatives to GDP], [[The Guardian]] 14-09-2009.<br/>{{cite web|url= http://www.beyond-gdp.eu/download/bgdp-bp-goossens.pdf |title=European Parliament, Policy Department Economic and Scientific Policy: Beyond GDP Study }}&nbsp;{{small|(1.47&nbsp;MB)}}</ref> although this is problematic because GDP per capita [[Gross domestic product#Standard of living and GDP: Wealth distribution and externalities|is not a measure of personal income]].\n\nComparisons of national income are also frequently made on the basis of [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP), to adjust for differences in the cost of living in different countries. (''See'' [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita]].) PPP largely removes the exchange rate problem but not others; it does not reflect the value of economic output in [[international trade]], and it also requires more estimation than GDP per capita. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are more narrowly spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.\n\nNon-sovereign entities (the world, continents, and some [[dependent territory|dependent territories]]) and states with limited international recognition (such as [[Kosovo]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Taiwan]]) are included in the list in cases in which they appear in the sources. These economies are not ranked in the charts here, but are listed in sequence by GDP for comparison. In addition, non-sovereign entities are marked in ''italics''.\n\nNote that the Irish GDP data below is subject to material distortion by the [[Tax avoidance|tax planning]] activities of foreign multinationals in Ireland. 2015 Irish GDP is over 150% of 2015 Irish GNI. To address this, in 2017 the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] created \"[[Modified gross national income|modified GNI]]\" (or GNI*) as a more appropriate statistic, and the OECD and IMF have adopted it for Ireland. 2015 Irish GDP is 143% of 2015 Irish GNI*.\n\nAll data are in current [[United States dollar|United States dollars]].
