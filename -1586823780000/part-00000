He starred in some of the  [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]]' most popular live-action pictures of that period, such as ''[[Song of the South]]'' (1946), ''[[So Dear to My Heart]]'' (1949), and ''[[Treasure Island (1950 film)|Treasure Island]]'' (1950). He served as animation model and provided the voice for the title role in ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (1953). In 1950, he received an [[Academy Juvenile Award]] for outstanding performance in feature films of 1949, for his roles in ''So Dear to My Heart'' and ''[[The Window (1949 film)|The Window]]'', both released in 1949.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Driscoll's acting career began to decline, and he turned primarily to guest appearances on [[Anthology series#Television|anthology TV series]]. He became addicted to [[narcotics]] and was sentenced to prison for illicit drug use. After his release, he focused his attention on the [[avant-garde]] art scene. In ill health due to his [[substance abuse]], and with his funds depleted, he died in 1968 in an abandoned building, shortly after his 31st birthday.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born Robert Cletus Driscoll in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], the only child of Cletus (1901\u20131969), an insulation salesman, and Isabelle ([[n\u00e9e]] Kratz; 1904\u20131981), a former schoolteacher.

The family moved to [[Los Angeles]] when a doctor advised the father to relocate to California because he was suffering from work-related handling of [[asbestos]].\n\nDriscoll's parents were encouraged to get Bobby into films. Their barber's son, an actor, got Bobby an audition at [[MGM]] for a big role in the 1943 family drama ''[[Lost Angel (film)|Lost Angel]]'', which starred [[Margaret O'Brien]]. While on a tour across the studio lot, five-year-old Driscoll noticed a mock-up ship and asked where the water was.
