It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to Cornwall.  Almost a decade later in 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' was incorporated after obtaining a franchise to operate a streetcar service from the Town of Cornwall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive and four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  In 1897, two additional cars were purchased.  A year later, to generate additional revenues, the company started a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\nIn 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company''.  In 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters, powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.   \n\nIn 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  This permitted [[Ontario Hydro]], with its local hydroelectric power generating station, to provide Cornwall Electric and Cornwall residents, with enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.  In 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to always maintain a minimum balance of CA$25 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|title=City put $25M Progress Fund in jeopardy: auditor \u2013 Cornwall Newswatch|website=www.cornwallnewswatch.com|date=May 7, 2019|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>  Originally, it would only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.  Over the years, interest generated by the fund has been used in part for the redevelopment of the Hotel Dieu Hospital, the establishment of a [[hospice]], the building of an aquatic centre, and to pay the mortgage on the city's new sports complex, the Benson Centre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/09/24/cornwall-hit-sweet-spot-in-98-sale-of-cornwall-electric/|title=Cornwall hit \u2018sweet spot\u2019 in \u201998 sale of Cornwall Electric|last=Editor|date=2019-09-24|website=Cornwall Newswatch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Fortis Inc. ===\nIn May 2002, [[Enbridge|Enbridge Energy Distribution Inc.]] announced that it had agreed to sell ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' to Fortic Inc. in a cash deal worth CA$67 million. Both the Canadian [[Competition Bureau (Canada)|Competition Bureau]] and the Ontario Energy Board approved the sale which Fortis Inc. concluded on 18 October 2002.\u00a0 Fortis Inc. which has its roots in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John Newfoundland]], is an international company which operates Cornwall Electric under its Ontario subsidiary, Fortis Ontario Inc.\n\n=== LED lighting ===\nIn 2016, after an initial test run in certain areas, the City of Cornwall which still owns the utility poles and lights, contracted crews to convert approximate 5,000 street lamps that were using the older [[Sodium-vapor lamp|sodium-vapour lamps]] which typically lasted six years.  The more energy efficient [[LED lamp|LED bulbs]] could last as long as twenty years.  The cost of the project was CA$3 million.  The cost of financing the project would be recouped from energy savings and  lower maintenance fees.  The city also announced that it would be switching its street traffic lights to LED at a rate of two intersections per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallseawaynews.com/2016/04/11/5000-city-street-lights-being-replaced-with-led/|title=5,000 city street lights being replaced with LED|date=2016-04-11|website=Cornwall Seaway News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> In 2017, [[Hydro One]] converted the Township of Glengarry to LED bulbs at a cost of CA$226 thousand, yielding a cost savings of sixty-nine percent, and collecting CA$259 thousand in savings in the first three years.\n\n=== Controversy ===\nIn 2019 the Township of Glengarry wanted Cornwall Electric to convert its sub-division of Glen Walter to LED lighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/03/12/glen-walter-held-hostage-to-old-streetlights/|title=Glen Walter held hostage to old streetlights|last=Editor|date=2019-03-12|website=Cornwall Newswatch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> At a special council meeting on 24 January 2020, Councillor Sam McDonell raised the idea of not paying its electricity bill, as a way to bring Cornwall Electric to the table to discuss the matter. In an email published in the [[Cornwall Seaway News]], the councillor stated: \"''The big issue is this is a real savings that once we have transferred maintenance and future replacement cost to reserves we can then pass that savings along to rate payers, who in fact have these lights worked into their property taxes. It\u2019s a true savings we miss out on every month we pay the bill and Cornwall Electric doesn\u2019t come to the table''.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallseawaynews.com/2020/01/27/sg-council-considers-not-paying-cornwall-electric-bill/|title=SG Council considers not paying Cornwall Electric bill|date=2020-01-27|website=Cornwall Seaway News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Cornwall Canal]]\n*[[Cornwall, Ontario]]\n*[[Cornwall station]]\n* [[Cornwall Street Railway]]\n* [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]]\n*[[R.

It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to Cornwall.  Almost a decade later in 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' was incorporated after obtaining a franchise to operate a streetcar service from the Town of Cornwall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive and four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  In 1897, two additional cars were purchased.  A year later, to generate additional revenues, the company started a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\nIn 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company''.  In 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters, powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.   \n\nIn 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  This permitted [[Ontario Hydro]], with its local hydroelectric power generating station, to provide Cornwall Electric and Cornwall residents, with enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.  In 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to always maintain a minimum balance of CA$25 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|title=City put $25M Progress Fund in jeopardy: auditor \u2013 Cornwall Newswatch|website=www.cornwallnewswatch.com|date=May 7, 2019|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>  Originally, it would only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.

The cost of the project was CA$3 million.  The cost of financing the project would be recouped from energy savings and  lower maintenance fees.  The city also announced that it would be switching its street traffic lights to LED at a rate of two intersections per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallseawaynews.com/2016/04/11/5000-city-street-lights-being-replaced-with-led/|title=5,000 city street lights being replaced with LED|date=2016-04-11|website=Cornwall Seaway News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> In 2017, [[Hydro One]] converted the Township of Glengarry to LED bulbs at a cost of CA$226 thousand, yielding a cost savings of sixty-nine percent, and collecting CA$259 thousand in savings in the first three years.\n\n=== Controversy ===\nIn 2019 the Township of Glengarry wanted Cornwall Electric to convert its sub-division of Glen Walter to LED lighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/03/12/glen-walter-held-hostage-to-old-streetlights/|title=Glen Walter held hostage to old streetlights|last=Editor|date=2019-03-12|website=Cornwall Newswatch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> At a special council meeting on 24 January 2020, Councillor Sam McDonell raised the idea of not paying its electricity bill, as a way to bring Cornwall Electric to the table to discuss the matter.

A lower than expected blood volume, for instance, from taking a low-salt diet in the absence of any salt-retaining tendency. Or heat causing vaso-dilation and worsening the effect of the relatively insufficient blood volume. The next stage is the adrenergic response. If there is underlying fear or anxiety (e.g., social circumstances), or acute fear (e.g., acute threat, [[Trypanophobia|needle phobia]]), the vaso-motor centre demands an increased pumping action by the heart (flight or fight response). This is set in motion via the adrenergic (sympathetic) outflow from the brain, but the heart is unable to meet requirements because of the low blood volume, or decreased return. A feedback response to the [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]] is triggered via the afferent [[vagus nerve]]. The high (ineffective) sympathetic activity is thereby modulated by vagal (parasympathetic) outflow leading to excessive slowing of heart rate. The abnormality lies in this excessive vagal response causing loss of blood flow to the brain.<ref name=\":1\" /> The tilt-table test typically evokes the attack. Avoiding what brings on the syncope and possibly greater salt intake is often all that is needed.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite journal|last1=Kaufmann|first1=H|last2=Bhattacharya|first2=K|date=May 2002|title=Diagnosis and treatment of neurally mediated syncope.|journal=The Neurologist|volume=8|issue=3|pages=175\u201385|doi=10.1097/00127893-200205000-00004|pmid=12803689}}</ref>\n\nAssociated symptoms may be felt in the minutes leading up to a vasovagal episode and are referred to as the prodrome. These consist of light-headedness, confusion, pallor, nausea, salivation, sweating, tachycardia, blurred vision, and sudden urge to defecate among other symptoms.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nVasovagal syncope can be considered in two forms:\n\n*Isolated episodes of loss of consciousness, unheralded by any warning symptoms for more than a few moments. These tend to occur in the adolescent age group and may be associated with fasting, exercise, abdominal straining, or circumstances promoting vaso-dilation (e.g., heat, alcohol). The subject is invariably upright. The [[tilt-table test]], if performed, is generally negative.\n*Recurrent syncope with complex associated symptoms. This is neurally mediated syncope (NMS). It is associated with any of the following: preceding or succeeding sleepiness, preceding visual disturbance (\"spots before the eyes\"), sweating, lightheadedness.<ref name=NIH2020 /> The subject is usually but not always upright. The tilt-table test, if performed, is generally positive. It is relatively uncommon.\n\nSyncope has been linked with psychological triggers.<ref name=NIH2020 /> This includes fainting in response to the sight or thought of blood, needles, pain, and other emotionally stressful situations. One theory in [[evolutionary psychology]] is that fainting at the sight of blood might have evolved as a form of [[Apparent death|playing dead]] which increased survival from attackers and might have slowed blood loss in a primitive environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-babble/201302/why-do-some-people-faint-the-sight-blood|title=Why do Some People Faint at the Sight of Blood?|url-status=live|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20160801224802/http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain%2Dbabble/201302/why%2Ddo%2Dsome%2Dpeople%2Dfaint%2Dthe%2Dsight%2Dblood|archive-date=2017-09-06|access-date=2015-08-15}}</ref>  \"Blood-injury phobia\", as this is called, is experienced by about 15% of people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/swoon-at-the-sight-of-blood|title=Swoon at the Sight of Blood?

A non-combatant who has fainted signals that she or he is not a threat. This would explain the  association between fainting and stimuli such as bloodletting and injuries seen in [[blood-injection-injury type phobia]]s such as [[needle phobia]] as well as the gender differences.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bracha HS |title=Human brain evolution and the 'Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle:' Implications for the Reclassification of fear-circuitry-related traits in DSM-V and for studying resilience to warzone-related posttraumatic stress disorder |journal=Prog.

[[Aortic stenosis]] and [[mitral stenosis]] are the most common examples. Major valves of the heart become stiffened and reduce the efficiency of the hearts pumping action. This may not cause symptoms at rest but with exertion, the heart is unable to keep up with increased demands leading to syncope. Aortic stenosis presents with repeated episodes of syncope.<ref name=\":1\" /> Rarely, cardiac tumors such as atrial myxomas can also lead to syncope.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Structural cardiopulmonary disease====\nDiseases involving the shape and strength of the heart can be a cause of reduced blood flow to the brain, which increases risk for syncope.<ref name=NIH2020 /> The most common cause in this category is fainting associated with an acute myocardial infarction or ischemic event. The faint in this case is primarily caused by an abnormal nervous system reaction similar to the reflex faints.

Often there is a long pause (asystole) between heartbeats.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Adams-Stokes syndrome]] is a cardiac syncope that occurs with seizures caused by complete or incomplete heart block. Symptoms include deep and fast respiration, weak and slow pulse and respiratory pauses that may last for 60 seconds.\n\n[[Subclavian steal syndrome]] arises from retrograde (reversed) flow of blood in the vertebral artery or the internal thoracic artery, due to a proximal stenosis (narrowing) and/or occlusion of the subclavian artery.<ref name=\":1\" /> Symptoms such as syncope, lightheadedness, and paresthesias occur while exercising the arm on the affected side (most commonly the left).\n\n[[Aortic dissection]] (a tear in the aorta) and [[cardiomyopathy]] can also result in syncope.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Nallamothu BK, Mehta RH, Saint S, etal |title=Syncope in acute aortic dissection: diagnostic, prognostic, and clinical implications |journal=Am.

This is sensed by [[Carotid sinus|stretch receptors]] in the walls of vessels in the carotid sinus and aortic arch.<ref name=\":1\" /> These receptors then trigger a sympathetic nervous response to compensate and redistribute blood back into the brain. The sympathetic response causes peripheral vasoconstriction and increased heart rate. These together act to raise blood pressure back to baseline.<ref name=\":1\" /> Apparently healthy individuals may experience minor symptoms (\"lightheadedness\", \"greying-out\") as they stand up if blood pressure is slow to respond to the stress of upright posture. If the blood pressure is not adequately maintained during standing, faints may develop.<ref name=NIH2020 /> However, the resulting \"transient orthostatic hypotension\" does not necessarily signal any serious underlying disease. It is as common or perhaps even more common than vasovagal syncope.\n\nThis may be due to medications, [[dehydration]], significant bleeding or [[infection]].<ref name=\"EB2014\" /> The most susceptible individuals are elderly frail individuals, or persons who are dehydrated from hot environments or inadequate fluid intake.<ref name=NIH2020 /> For example, medical students would be at risk for orthostatic hypotensive syncope while observing long surgeries in the operating room.<ref name=\"Jamjoom2009\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Jamjoom AA, Nikkar-Esfahani A, Fitzgerald JE|year=2009|title=Operating theatre related syncope in medical students: a cross sectional study|journal=BMC Med Educ|volume=9|pages=14|doi=10.1186/1472-6920-9-14|pmc=2657145|pmid=19284564}}</ref> There is also evidence that exercise training can help reduce orthostatic intolerance.<ref>{{cite book|title=Springer ''Reference''|work=SpringerReference|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2011|chapter=Athletes and Sudden Cardiac Death|doi=10.1007/springerreference_188007}}</ref> More serious orthostatic hypotension is often the result of certain commonly prescribed medications such as diuretics, \u03b2-adrenergic blockers, other anti-hypertensives (including vasodilators), and [[nitroglycerin]].<ref name=NIH2020 /> In a small percentage of cases, the cause of orthostatic hypotensive faints is structural damage to the [[autonomic nervous system]] due to systemic diseases (e.g., [[amyloidosis]] or diabetes) or in neurological diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHyperadrenergic orthostatic hypotension refers to an orthostatic drop in blood pressure despite high levels of sympathetic adrenergic response. This occurs when a people with normal physiology is unable to compensate for >20% loss in intravascular volume.<ref name=\":11\" /> This may be due to blood loss, dehydration or [[Fluid compartments|third-spacing]]. On standing the person will experience reflex tachycardia (at least 20% increased over supine) and a drop in blood pressure.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHypoadrenergic orthostatic hypotension occurs when the person is unable to sustain a normal sympathetic response to blood pressure changes during movement despite adequate intravascular volume. There is little to no compensatory increase in heart rate or blood pressure when standing for up to 10 minutes. This is often due to an underlying disorder or medication use and is accompanied by other [[Adrenal insufficiency|hypoadrenergic signs]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Central nervous system ischemia===\nThe central ischemic response is triggered by an inadequate supply of oxygenated blood in the brain.<ref name=NIH2020 /> Common examples include [[stroke]]s and [[transient ischemic attack]]s. While these conditions often impair consciousness they rarely meet the medical definition of syncope. [[Vertebrobasilar artery stroke|Vertebrobasilar]] transient ischemic attacks may produce true syncope as a symptom.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe respiratory system may compensate for dropping oxygen levels through [[hyperventilation]], though a sudden [[Ischemia|ischemic]] episode may also proceed faster than the respiratory system can respond.<ref name=\":1\" />  These processes cause the typical symptoms of fainting: pale skin,  rapid breathing, nausea and weakness of the limbs, particularly of the legs.<ref name=NIH2020 /> If the ischemia is intense or prolonged, limb weakness progresses to collapse.<ref name=NIH2020 />  The weakness of the legs causes most people to sit or lie down if there is time to do so. This may avert a complete collapse, but whether the sufferer sits down or falls down, the result of an ischaemic episode is a posture in which less blood pressure is required to achieve adequate blood flow. An individual with very little skin pigmentation may appear to have all color drained from his or her face at the onset of an episode.<ref name=NIH2020 /> This effect combined with the following collapse can make a strong and dramatic impression on bystanders.\n\n====Vertebro-basilar arterial disease====\nArterial disease in the upper spinal cord, or lower brain that causes syncope if there is a reduction in blood supply. This may occur with extending the neck or with use of medications to lower blood pressure.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Other causes===\nThere are other conditions which may cause or resemble syncope.\n\nSeizures and syncope can be difficult to differentiate. Both often present as sudden loss of consciousness and convulsive movements may be present or absent in either. Movements in syncope are typically brief and more irregular than seizures.<ref name=\":8\" /> [[Atonic seizure|Akinetic seizures]] can present with sudden loss of postural tone without associated tonic-clonic movements. Absence of a long post-ictal state is indicative of syncope rather than an akinetic seizure.\n\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage may result in syncope.

After the symptoms have passed, [[sleep]] is recommended. Lifestyle modifications are important for treating people experiencing repeated syncopal episodes. Avoiding triggers and situations where loss of consciousness would be seriously hazardous (operating heavy machinery, commercial pilot, etc.) has been shown to be effective.\n\nIf fainting spells occur often without a triggering event, syncope may be a sign of an underlying heart disease.<ref name=\":4\" /> In the case where syncope is caused by cardiac disease, the treatment is much more sophisticated than that of [[vasovagal]] syncope and may involve [[artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemakers]] and [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillators]] depending on the precise cardiac cause.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Risk tools ===\nThe [[San Francisco Syncope Rule|San Francisco syncope rule]] was developed to isolate people who have higher risk for a serious cause of syncope.

recovery.<ref name=EB2014/> It is caused by a decrease in blood flow to the [[brain]], typically from [[hypotension|low blood pressure]].<ref name=EB2014/> There are sometimes [[prodrome|symptoms before the loss of consciousness]] such as [[lightheadedness]], [[diaphoresis|sweating]], [[pale skin]], blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, or feeling warm.<ref name=NIH2020 /><ref name=EB2014/> Syncope may also be associated with a short episode of muscle twitching.<ref name=EB2014/><ref name=NIH2020 /> When consciousness and muscle strength are not completely lost, it is called [[presyncope]].<ref name=EB2014/> It is recommended that presyncope be treated the same as syncope.<ref name=EB2014/>\n\n<!-- Cause -->\nCauses range from non-serious to potentially fatal.<ref name=EB2014/> There are three broad categories of causes: [[heart]] or [[blood vessel]] related; [[reflex syncope|reflex]], also known as [[Nervous system|neurally]] mediated; and [[orthostatic hypotension]].<ref name=EB2014/><ref name=NIH2020 /> Issues with the heart and blood vessels are the cause in about 10% and typically the most serious while neurally mediated is the most common.<ref name=EB2014/> Heart related causes may include an [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythm]], problems with the [[heart valve]]s or heart muscle and blockages of blood vessels from a [[pulmonary embolism]] or [[aortic dissection]] among others.<ref name=EB2014/> Neurally mediated syncope occurs when blood vessels expand and [[bradycardia|heart rate decreases]] inappropriately.<ref name=EB2014/> This may occur from either a triggering event such as exposure to blood, pain, strong feelings or a specific activity such as [[urination]], [[vomiting]], or [[coughing]].<ref name=EB2014/> Neurally mediated syncope may also occur when an area in the neck known as the [[carotid sinus]] is pressed.<ref name=EB2014/> The third type of syncope is due to a drop in blood pressure when changing position such as when standing up.<ref name=EB2014/> This is often due to medications that a person is taking but may also be related to [[dehydration]], significant bleeding or [[infection]].<ref name=EB2014/> There also seems to be a genetic component to syncope.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hadji-Turdeghal |first1=Katra |title=Genome-wide association study identifies locus at

[[prodrome]].<ref name=EB2014/> Low blood pressure and a fast heart rate after the event may indicate blood loss or dehydration, while [[Hypoxia (medical)|low blood oxygen levels]] may be seen following the event in those with pulmonary embolism.<ref name=EB2014/> More specific tests such as [[implantable loop recorder]]s, [[tilt table testing]] or [[carotid sinus massage]] may be useful in uncertain cases.<ref name=EB2014/> [[Computer tomography|Computed tomography]] (CT) is generally not required unless specific concerns are present.<ref name=EB2014/> Other causes of similar symptoms

(situational) syncope is one of the most common types which may occur in response to any of a variety of triggers, such as scary, embarrassing or uneasy situations, during blood drawing, or moments of sudden unusually high stress.<ref name=NIH2020>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Syncope-Information-Page|title=Syncope Information Page {{!}} National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke|website=www.ninds.nih.gov|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> There are many different syncope syndromes which all fall under the umbrella of vasovagal syncope related by the same central mechanism.<ref name=NIH2020 /> First, the person is usually predisposed to decreased blood pressure by various environmental factors. A lower than expected blood volume, for instance, from taking a low-salt diet in the absence of any salt-retaining tendency. Or heat causing vaso-dilation and worsening the effect of the relatively insufficient blood volume. The next stage is the adrenergic response. If there is underlying fear or anxiety (e.g., social circumstances), or acute fear (e.g., acute threat, [[Trypanophobia|needle phobia]]), the vaso-motor centre demands an increased pumping action by the heart (flight or fight response). This is set in motion via the adrenergic (sympathetic) outflow from the brain, but the heart is unable to meet requirements because of the low blood volume, or decreased return. A feedback response to the [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]] is triggered via the afferent [[vagus nerve]]. The high (ineffective) sympathetic activity is thereby modulated by vagal (parasympathetic) outflow leading to excessive slowing of heart rate. The abnormality lies in this excessive vagal response causing loss of blood flow to the brain.<ref name=\":1\" /> The tilt-table test typically evokes the attack. Avoiding what brings on the syncope and possibly greater salt intake is often all that is needed.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite journal|last1=Kaufmann|first1=H|last2=Bhattacharya|first2=K|date=May 2002|title=Diagnosis and treatment of neurally mediated syncope.|journal=The Neurologist|volume=8|issue=3|pages=175\u201385|doi=10.1097/00127893-200205000-00004|pmid=12803689}}</ref>\n\nAssociated symptoms may be felt in the minutes leading up to a vasovagal episode and are referred to as the prodrome.

These tend to occur in the adolescent age group and may be associated with fasting, exercise, abdominal straining, or circumstances promoting vaso-dilation (e.g., heat, alcohol). The subject is invariably upright. The [[tilt-table test]], if performed, is generally negative.\n*Recurrent syncope with complex associated symptoms. This is neurally mediated syncope (NMS). It is associated with any of the following: preceding or succeeding sleepiness, preceding visual disturbance (\"spots before the eyes\"), sweating, lightheadedness.<ref name=NIH2020 /> The subject is usually but not always upright. The tilt-table test, if performed, is generally positive. It is relatively uncommon.\n\nSyncope has been linked with psychological triggers.<ref name=NIH2020 /> This includes fainting in response to the sight or thought of blood, needles, pain, and other emotionally stressful situations. One theory in [[evolutionary psychology]] is that fainting at the sight of blood might have evolved as a form of [[Apparent death|playing dead]] which increased survival from attackers and might have slowed blood loss in a primitive environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-babble/201302/why-do-some-people-faint-the-sight-blood|title=Why do Some People Faint at the Sight of Blood?|url-status=live|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20160801224802/http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain%2Dbabble/201302/why%2Ddo%2Dsome%2Dpeople%2Dfaint%2Dthe%2Dsight%2Dblood|archive-date=2017-09-06|access-date=2015-08-15}}</ref>  \"Blood-injury phobia\", as this is called, is experienced by about 15% of people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/swoon-at-the-sight-of-blood|title=Swoon at the Sight of Blood?

[[Aortic stenosis]] and [[mitral stenosis]] are the most common examples. Major valves of the heart become stiffened and reduce the efficiency of the hearts pumping action. This may not cause symptoms at rest but with exertion, the heart is unable to keep up with increased demands leading to syncope. Aortic stenosis presents with repeated episodes of syncope.<ref name=\":1\" /> Rarely, cardiac tumors such as atrial myxomas can also lead to syncope.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Structural cardiopulmonary disease====\nDiseases involving the shape and strength of the heart can be a cause of reduced blood flow to the brain, which increases risk for syncope.<ref name=NIH2020 /> The most common cause in this category is fainting associated with an acute myocardial infarction or ischemic event. The faint in this case is primarily caused by an abnormal nervous system reaction similar to the reflex faints.

This is sensed by [[Carotid sinus|stretch receptors]] in the walls of vessels in the carotid sinus and aortic arch.<ref name=\":1\" /> These receptors then trigger a sympathetic nervous response to compensate and redistribute blood back into the brain. The sympathetic response causes peripheral vasoconstriction and increased heart rate. These together act to raise blood pressure back to baseline.<ref name=\":1\" /> Apparently healthy individuals may experience minor symptoms (\"lightheadedness\", \"greying-out\") as they stand up if blood pressure is slow to respond to the stress of upright posture. If the blood pressure is not adequately maintained during standing, faints may develop.<ref name=NIH2020 /> However, the resulting \"transient orthostatic hypotension\" does not necessarily signal any serious underlying disease. It is as common or perhaps even more common than vasovagal syncope.\n\nThis may be due to medications, [[dehydration]], significant bleeding or [[infection]].<ref name=\"EB2014\" /> The most susceptible individuals are elderly frail individuals, or persons who are dehydrated from hot environments or inadequate fluid intake.<ref name=NIH2020 /> For example, medical students would be at risk for orthostatic hypotensive syncope while observing long surgeries in the operating room.<ref name=\"Jamjoom2009\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Jamjoom AA, Nikkar-Esfahani A, Fitzgerald JE|year=2009|title=Operating theatre related syncope in medical students: a cross sectional study|journal=BMC Med Educ|volume=9|pages=14|doi=10.1186/1472-6920-9-14|pmc=2657145|pmid=19284564}}</ref> There is also evidence that exercise training can help reduce orthostatic intolerance.<ref>{{cite book|title=Springer ''Reference''|work=SpringerReference|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2011|chapter=Athletes and Sudden Cardiac Death|doi=10.1007/springerreference_188007}}</ref> More serious orthostatic hypotension is often the result of certain commonly prescribed medications such as diuretics, \u03b2-adrenergic blockers, other anti-hypertensives (including vasodilators), and [[nitroglycerin]].<ref name=NIH2020 /> In a small percentage of cases, the cause of orthostatic hypotensive faints is structural damage to the [[autonomic nervous system]] due to systemic diseases (e.g., [[amyloidosis]] or diabetes) or in neurological diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHyperadrenergic orthostatic hypotension refers to an orthostatic drop in blood pressure despite high levels of sympathetic adrenergic response. This occurs when a people with normal physiology is unable to compensate for >20% loss in intravascular volume.<ref name=\":11\" /> This may be due to blood loss, dehydration or [[Fluid compartments|third-spacing]]. On standing the person will experience reflex tachycardia (at least 20% increased over supine) and a drop in blood pressure.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHypoadrenergic orthostatic hypotension occurs when the person is unable to sustain a normal sympathetic response to blood pressure changes during movement despite adequate intravascular volume. There is little to no compensatory increase in heart rate or blood pressure when standing for up to 10 minutes. This is often due to an underlying disorder or medication use and is accompanied by other [[Adrenal insufficiency|hypoadrenergic signs]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Central nervous system ischemia===\nThe central ischemic response is triggered by an inadequate supply of oxygenated blood in the brain.<ref name=NIH2020 /> Common examples include [[stroke]]s and [[transient ischemic attack]]s. While these conditions often impair consciousness they rarely meet the medical definition of syncope. [[Vertebrobasilar artery stroke|Vertebrobasilar]] transient ischemic attacks may produce true syncope as a symptom.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe respiratory system may compensate for dropping oxygen levels through [[hyperventilation]], though a sudden [[Ischemia|ischemic]] episode may also proceed faster than the respiratory system can respond.<ref name=\":1\" />  These processes cause the typical symptoms of fainting: pale skin,  rapid breathing, nausea and weakness of the limbs, particularly of the legs.<ref name=NIH2020 /> If the ischemia is intense or prolonged, limb weakness progresses to collapse.<ref name=NIH2020 />  The weakness of the legs causes most people to sit or lie down if there is time to do so. This may avert a complete collapse, but whether the sufferer sits down or falls down, the result of an ischaemic episode is a posture in which less blood pressure is required to achieve adequate blood flow. An individual with very little skin pigmentation may appear to have all color drained from his or her face at the onset of an episode.<ref name=NIH2020 /> This effect combined with the following collapse can make a strong and dramatic impression on bystanders.\n\n====Vertebro-basilar arterial disease====\nArterial disease in the upper spinal cord, or lower brain that causes syncope if there is a reduction in blood supply. This may occur with extending the neck or with use of medications to lower blood pressure.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Other causes===\nThere are other conditions which may cause or resemble syncope.\n\nSeizures and syncope can be difficult to differentiate. Both often present as sudden loss of consciousness and convulsive movements may be present or absent in either. Movements in syncope are typically brief and more irregular than seizures.<ref name=\":8\" /> [[Atonic seizure|Akinetic seizures]] can present with sudden loss of postural tone without associated tonic-clonic movements. Absence of a long post-ictal state is indicative of syncope rather than an akinetic seizure.\n\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage may result in syncope.

For individuals who have problems with chronic fainting spells, therapy should focus on recognizing the triggers and learning techniques to keep from fainting.<ref name=\":12\" /> At the appearance of warning signs such as lightheadedness, nausea, or cold and clammy skin, counter-pressure maneuvers that involve gripping fingers into a fist, tensing the arms, and crossing the legs or squeezing the thighs together can be used to ward off a fainting spell.  After the symptoms have passed, [[sleep]] is recommended. Lifestyle modifications are important for treating people experiencing repeated syncopal episodes. Avoiding triggers and situations where loss of consciousness would be seriously hazardous (operating heavy machinery, commercial pilot, etc.) has been shown to be effective.\n\nIf fainting spells occur often without a triggering event, syncope may be a sign of an underlying heart disease.<ref name=\":4\" /> In the case where syncope is caused by cardiac disease, the treatment is much more sophisticated than that of [[vasovagal]] syncope and may involve [[artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemakers]] and [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillators]] depending on the precise cardiac cause.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Risk tools ===\nThe [[San Francisco Syncope Rule|San Francisco syncope rule]] was developed to isolate people who have higher risk for a serious cause of syncope.

{"title_page": "Sexual slavery in Islam", "text_new": "{{about|Sexual slavery in Islam|  other uses| Islam and slavery (disambiguation) }}\n\n'''Sexual slavery in Islam''' results from the permission in [[Islamic law]] for men to have sexual intercourse with the female slaves they own. Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}} \n\nEarly sources indicate that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law and Sunni ulama recognise two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}}\n*War Captives: \n**These are originally free non-Muslims who are captured in battle.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Badawi|2019|p=17}} The entire population of a conquered territory can be enslaved, thus providing women who are otherwise rare on the battlefield. This paves the path for concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}} The Muslim military commander is allowed to choose between unconditionally releasing, ransoming or enslaving war captives.{{sfn|Mufti|2019|p=5}} If a person converted to Islam after being enslaved, their emancipation would be considered a pious act but not obligatory.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Islamic law does not allow enslavement of free-born Muslims.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=142}}\n**Islamic jurists permitted slave raiding and kidnapping of non-Muslims from Dar al Harb.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} South Asian scholars ruled that jihad was not needed to seize non-muslims nor was it necessary to invite them to Islam before seizing them. Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} \n*Slave-girls by descent: \n**These are born to slave mothers.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=57}} Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.{{sfn|Erdem|1996|p=52}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.{{sfn|Ali|2011|p=76}} If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p=18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}}\n\n==Umm Walad (slave mother)==\n''Umm walad'' (mother of child) is a title given to a woman who gave birth to her master's child.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} If a female slave gave birth to her master's child she still remained a slave. However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of ''umm walad'' even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the information found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} \n\nDue to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves. However, there is no indication that these attitudes were ever acted upon.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=20-21}} One of the earliest surviving Christian texts from the Islamic period in Syria, dated by scholars to around 640 CE, describes the rise of Islam in this way: \n\n{{quote|They take the wife away from her husband and slay him like a sheep. They throw the babe from her mother and drive her into slavery; the child calls out from the ground and the mother hears, yet what is she to do?...They separate the children from the mother like the soul from within the body, and she watches as they divide her loved ones from off her lap, two of them go to two masters, herself to another[...] Her children cry out in lament, their eyes hot with tears. She turns to her loved ones, milk pouring forth from her breast: \"Go in peace, my darlings, and may God accompany you.\"|[[Seeing Islam As Others Saw It: A Survey and Evaluation of Christian, Jewish and Zoroastrian Writings on Early Islam]], [[Robert G. Hoyland]]{{sfn|Hoyland|1997|p=262}}}}\n\n===Women of Hawazin===\nThe Banu [[Thaqif]] and Banu [[Hawazin]] tribes decided to go to war against Muhammad under the leadership of Malik ibn Awf.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} Malik had the unfortunate idea of bringing the women, children and livestock with his army.{{sfn|Saron|1986|p=266}} He believed that by bringing their women and children with the army, all his soldiers would fight more courageously to defend them.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} When Muhammad was informed that the Hawazin had brought their women, children and livestock with them, he smiled and said \"Inshaa Allah, all these will become the booty of war for the Muslims.\"{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=260-261}}\n\nThe Muslim army defeated the Hawazin and captured their women and children. The pagan soldiers fled.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=262}} The war booty which the Muslims obtained was 24,000 camels, more than 40,000 goats, 160,000 dirhams worth of silver and 6,000 women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=263}} Muhammad waited ten days for the Hawazin to repent and reclaim their families and properties. However, none of them came. Finally, Muhammad distributed the war booty among the Muslim soldiers.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=264}} The Muslim soldiers initially hesitated to have sex with the married female captives, until a verse was revealed giving them permission to have sex with them:<ref>{{cite book|author=\u0623\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u0625\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0645\u0631/\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0634\u0642\u064a|title=THE EXEGESIS OF THE GRAND HOLY QUR'AN 1-4 Ibn Katheer VOL 2: \u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 &#91;\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0632\u064a&#93; 1/4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCxuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Dar Al Kotob Al Ilmiyah \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629|pages=40\u201341|id=GGKEY:47J6TBSZ6R8}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, \"We captured some women from the area of Awtas who were already married, and we disliked having sexual relations with them because they already had husbands. So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family. She chose her family. Likewise, the girls given to Talha, Uthman, [[Abdullah ibn Umar|Ibn Umar]] and Safwan bin Umayya were also returned to their families. However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an ''umm walad''. If she bacame an umm walad her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} A purchaser could not separate the woman he bought from her child until the stipulated age, which according to [[Ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani|Ibn Abi Zayd]] was when the child became six years old.{{sfn|Bellagamba|2016|p=24}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S.

While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} The most regular opposition to concubinage came from free wives. Early moral stories depicted wives as victims of concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=81}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The most highly desired slave-concubines in the Muslim world were not African women, but white girls, typically of Circassian or Georgian origin. However, they were very expensive.{{sfn|Miers|1975|p=56}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}} \n===Abbasid Caliphate===\nThe royals and nobles during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] kept large numbers of concubines. The Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] possessed hundreds of concubines. The Caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]] was reported to own 4,000 concubines.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} One Umayyad ruler, [[Abd al-Rahman III]], was known to have possessed more than 6000 concubines.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} Slave traders would abduct and sell [[Circassians|Circassian]] girls.{{sfn|Yelbasi|2019|p=14}} Circassian and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nSince the late 1300s Ottoman sultans would only permit heirs born from concubines to inherit their throne. Each concubine was only permitted to have one son. Once a concubine would bear a son she would spend the rest of her life plotting in favour of her son. If her son was to successfully become the next Sultan, she would become an unquestionable ruler. After the 1450s the Sultans stopped marrying altogether. Because of this there was great surprise when Sultan Sulayman fell in love with his concubine and married her. An Ottoman Sultan would have sexual relationships with only some women from his large collection of slave girls. This meant that a lot of the concubines were not given a family life if they were not desired by the Sultan. This effectively meant these women would have to spend the rest of their lives in virtual imprisonment. Some of these women would break the sharia by having [[Lesbian|homosexual]] relations.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\nResearch into Ottoman records show that polygamy was absent or rare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2010|p=531}} Concubinage and polygamy were quite uncommon outside the elite.

However, some kept Abyssinian slaves who were less costly than maintaining a wife. While white slave-girls would be in the keep of wealthy Turks, the concubines kept by upper and middle class Egyptians were usually Abyssinians.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=74}}\n\n===Indian subcontinent===\nOvington, a voyager who wrote about his journey to [[Surat]], stated that Muslim men had an \"extraordinary liberty for women\" and kept as many concubines as they could afford.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=59}} [[Akbar]] had a harem of at least 5000 women and [[Aurangzeb]]'s harem was even larger.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} The nobles in India could possess as many concubines as they wanted.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=357}} Ismail Quli Khan, a Mughal noble, possessed 1200 girls.

If he felt attracted to any slave-girl he would call her to him for his enjoyment while the wife would not dare to show her anger. The wife would punish the slave-girl later.{{sfn|Lal|2005|p=40}}\n\nLower class Muslims were generally monogamous. Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread.

Many of these had been captured in raids or wars and were then gifted to the elite Muslim soldiers as war booty or were sold as slaves in Muslim markets.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} [[Berbers|Berber]] pirates trafficked [[French people|French]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women to North Africa. Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 [[Europeans|European]] girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims. Non-Muslim girls were socially ostracised by their own communities for the sexual relationships Muslim soldiers and nobles would have with them, therefore, many of them preferred to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=9}} When Muslims would surround [[Rajput]] citadels, the Rajput women would commit [[jauhar]] (collective suicide) to save themselves from being dishonoured by their enemies.

The capture and enslavement of non-muslim women is described in a matter-of-fact way in the Muslim sources. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women.

The state, if it is Islamic, does not have the right to seize my house, my wife or my slave.\"</blockquote>\n\nIn response to the enslavement of [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] women by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] the [[Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations|Council on American-Islamic Relations]] and Fiqh Council of North America claimed that no scholar disputes the abolition of slavery was one of the aims of Islam. However, [[Kecia Ali]] finds this claim dishonest. While there was definitely  an \u201cemancipatory ethic\u201d (encouragement for freeing slaves) in Islamic jurisprudence, slavery was never actually abolished.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=6}} The translator of [[Ibn Kathir]]'s treatise on slaves, Umar ibn Sulayman Hafyan, felt obliged to explain why he published a slave treatise when [[slavery]] no longer exists. He states that just because slavery no longer exists does not mean that the laws about slavery have been abrogated. Moreover, slavery was only abolished half a century ago and could return in the future.  His comments were a reflection of the predicament modern Muslims find themselves in.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=304}}\n===Modernist and reformist abolition movements===\nThe first and most radical Muslim abolitionists were modernist thinkers in British India in the 1870s. These laymen incurred condemnation from the traditional Muslim scholars.

It has been accepted as the first  genocide of the 20th century by scholars of genocide and historians of the late Ottoman period.{{sfn|Sjoberg|2016|p=90}} The Ottomans had intended to destroy the Armenians.{{sfn|Eltringham|2014|p=14}} Derderuan notes that after being separated from their men who were killed, the Armenian women and children were raped, forcibly converted to Islam and subjected to sexual slavery. [[Eliz Sanasarian]] also notes the involvement of Turkish women in perpetrating violence against Armenian women by selling them into sexual slavery.{{sfn|Sjoberg|2016|p=91}} Women who were deemed beautiful were sold as sex slaves to military officials. The remaining women would be beaten and raped.{{sfn|Crawford|2017|p=13}} The women were also often forced into prostitution or forcibly married with non-Armenians.{{sfn|Demirdjian|2016|p=126}} Kidnapped Armenian girls were sorted on the basis of their age, beauty and marital status. The \"first choice\" was given to high-level Ottoman officials. Outside [[Mezre]], purchasers asked doctors to check the girls for diseases and to verify their virginity. One German reported the sale of girls in [[Ras al-Ayn]] and testified that the policemen carried out the trade in girls.{{sfn|Connellan|2017|p=141}} A few slave markers were set up in the vicinity of government buildings while Armenian captive sex slaves were kept in the Red Crescent Hospital in Trebizond.{{sfn|Connellan|2017|p=141-142}}\n\nA large number of free [[Baloch people|Baloch]] women were kidnapped in the first half of the 20th century by slave traders and sold across the [[Persian Gulf]]. For example, Yuri bint Lapek was abducted after raiders killed her husband.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=214}} Another notable case was that of  Marzuq who was kidnapped from [[Makran]] and sold in [[Sharjah]]. Marzuq was purchased by Rashid bin Ali who had sex with her. When she became pregnant he married her off to another Baluchi to avoid taking responsibility for the child.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=218}} Many slave owners arranged  marriages for their female slaves, just so they would not have to take responsibility for impregnating their slaves.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=219}}\n\n===South Asia===\nThe most widespread [[raptio]] in modern times was the [[Violence against women during the partition of India|kidnapping of tens of thousands of girls during the Partition of India]].{{sfn|Collins|1975|p=336}} These women were kept as captives or forced wives{{sfn|Khan|2007|p=135}} and concubines.{{sfn|Khan|2007|p=39}} For instance, one account from Kirpal Singh mentions how [[Pakistan Army|Pakistani soldiers]] in Kamoke took 50 Hindu girls after killing most of their men.{{sfn|D'Costa|2010|p=57-58}} After being taken, Hindu and Sikh girls would be forcibly converted to Islam to be \"worthy\" of their captors' harems.{{sfn|Collins|1975|p=336}} [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribesmen captured a large number of non-Muslim girls from Kashmir and sold them as slave-girls in [[West Punjab]].{{sfn|Major|1995|p=62}} In [[Mirpur District|Mirpur]], many of the Hindu women captured by Pakistani soldiers committed jauhar, the old practice of Hindu women to escape Muslim soldiers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bal K.

The female captives were used sexually. Their Muslim captors asserted that Islamic law allowed them.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=53}} Sudan's Arab government had recruited Arab troops. One component consisted of millitias and the other component of their forces, called the [[Popular Defense Forces]], consisted of the Sudanese Army. This was a mainly jihadi force fighting the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army|SPLA]] which they considered to be an \"enemy of Islam and the Arabs.\"{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=24-25}} Arab raiders destroyed black Christian villages, executed all their  males and then took away the women and children as slaves.{{sfn|Islam's Black Slaves|2001|p=138}} \n\nRegular soldiers also abducted women and children.

Western visitors noted that five or even more slaves could be bought for one rifle. Near the peak of the civil war in 1989 female black slaves were sold for 90 dollars at the slave markets. Several years later, when there was an abundance of slaves, the price of an average female black slave had dropped to $15. Many Western organisations traveled to Sudan with funds collected for the purpose of purchasing these slaves to emancipate them.{{sfn|Islam's Black Slaves|2001|p=138}}\n\n==Modern Muslim attitudes==\nWhile classical [[Sharia|Islamic law]] permits sexual slavery, the vast majority of Muslims today oppose it. This contradiction is demonstrated by Ahmed Hassan, a twentieth century translator of Sahih Muslim, who prefaced the translated chapter on marriage by claiming that Islam only allows sex within marriage. This was despite the fact that the same chapter included many references to Muslim men having sex with slave-girls.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=107}} Most ordinary Muslims ignore the existence of slavery and concubinage in Islamic history and texts. Most also ignore the millennia old consensus permitting it and a few writers even claim that those Islamic jurists who allowed sexual relations outside marriage with female slaves were mistaken.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=108}} For example, [[Muhammad Asad]], rejected the notion of any sexual relationship outside of marriage.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Asad|first=Muhammad|title=The Message of the Quran.

Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}} \n\nEarly sources indicate that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law and Sunni ulama recognise two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}}\n*War Captives: \n**These are originally free non-Muslims who are captured in battle.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Badawi|2019|p=17}} The entire population of a conquered territory can be enslaved, thus providing women who are otherwise rare on the battlefield.

Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} \n*Slave-girls by descent: \n**These are born to slave mothers.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=57}} Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.{{sfn|Erdem|1996|p=52}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.{{sfn|Ali|2011|p=76}} If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p=18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}}\n\n==Umm Walad (slave mother)==\n''Umm walad'' (mother of child) is a title given to a woman who gave birth to her master's child.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} If a female slave gave birth to her master's child she still remained a slave. However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of ''umm walad'' even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the information found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} \n\nDue to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves. However, there is no indication that these attitudes were ever acted upon.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=20-21}} One of the earliest surviving Christian texts from the Islamic period in Syria, dated by scholars to around 640 CE, describes the rise of Islam in this way: \n\n{{quote|They take the wife away from her husband and slay him like a sheep.

So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family. She chose her family. Likewise, the girls given to Talha, Uthman, [[Abdullah ibn Umar|Ibn Umar]] and Safwan bin Umayya were also returned to their families. However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an ''umm walad''. If she bacame an umm walad her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} A purchaser could not separate the woman he bought from her child until the stipulated age, which according to [[Ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani|Ibn Abi Zayd]] was when the child became six years old.{{sfn|Bellagamba|2016|p=24}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S.

While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} The most regular opposition to concubinage came from free wives. Early moral stories depicted wives as victims of concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=81}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The most highly desired slave-concubines in the Muslim world were not African women, but white girls, typically of Circassian or Georgian origin. However, they were very expensive.{{sfn|Miers|1975|p=56}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}} \n===Abbasid Caliphate===\nThe royals and nobles during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] kept large numbers of concubines. The Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] possessed hundreds of concubines. The Caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]] was reported to own 4,000 concubines.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} One Umayyad ruler, [[Abd al-Rahman III]], was known to have possessed more than 6000 concubines.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} Slave traders would abduct and sell [[Circassians|Circassian]] girls.{{sfn|Yelbasi|2019|p=14}} Circassian and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nSince the late 1300s Ottoman sultans would only permit heirs born from concubines to inherit their throne. Each concubine was only permitted to have one son. Once a concubine would bear a son she would spend the rest of her life plotting in favour of her son. If her son was to successfully become the next Sultan, she would become an unquestionable ruler. After the 1450s the Sultans stopped marrying altogether. Because of this there was great surprise when Sultan Sulayman fell in love with his concubine and married her. An Ottoman Sultan would have sexual relationships with only some women from his large collection of slave girls. This meant that a lot of the concubines were not given a family life if they were not desired by the Sultan. This effectively meant these women would have to spend the rest of their lives in virtual imprisonment. Some of these women would break the sharia by having [[Lesbian|homosexual]] relations.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\nResearch into Ottoman records show that polygamy was absent or rare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2010|p=531}} Concubinage and polygamy were quite uncommon outside the elite.

The wife would punish the slave-girl later.{{sfn|Lal|2005|p=40}}\n\nLower class Muslims were generally monogamous. Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread.

The descendants of these captives became known as \"Mrattas\" and their women were traditionally used as concubines by the Bugtis. They became equal citizens of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.{{sfn|Lieven|2012|p=362}}\n\n==History of sexual enslavement==\n===Sexual enslavement of non-Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIn [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]] the concubines of the Muslim elite were usually non-Muslim women from the Christian areas of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]]. Many of these had been captured in raids or wars and were then gifted to the elite Muslim soldiers as war booty or were sold as slaves in Muslim markets.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} [[Berbers|Berber]] pirates trafficked [[French people|French]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women to North Africa. Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 [[Europeans|European]] girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims. Non-Muslim girls were socially ostracised by their own communities for the sexual relationships Muslim soldiers and nobles would have with them, therefore, many of them preferred to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=9}} When Muslims would surround [[Rajput]] citadels, the Rajput women would commit [[jauhar]] (collective suicide) to save themselves from being dishonoured by their enemies. In 1296 approximately 16,000 women committed jauhar to save themselves from [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khalj]]<nowiki/>i's army.{{sfn|Roy|2012|p=182}} Rajput women would commit it when they saw that defeat and enslavement was imminent for their people.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=143}} In 1533 in [[Chittorgarh]] nearly 13,000 women and children killed themselves instead of being taken captive by [[Bahadur Shah]]'s army.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=144}} For them sexual intercourse was the worst form of humiliation.

[[Jahangir]] explicitly ordered the destruction of the domain of the rebellious zamindar of [[Jaitpur State|Jaitpur]] and the capture of his women. Thus, his daughters and wives were captured and brought to the harem.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} Aurangzeb would enslave rebellious peasants.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=91}} [[Manucci]] records that, during Mughal rule, when faujdars would enter rebellious villages they would take the most attractive girls and present them to the king.

The capture and enslavement of non-muslim women is described in a matter-of-fact way in the Muslim sources. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women. In the eleventh century Christians began an aggressive policy towards Muslims in Andalus. Christian military leaders captured Muslim women and included eight year old Muslim [[Virginity|virgins]] as part of their war booty.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=171}} When [[Granada]] passed from Muslim rule to Christian rule, thousands of Moorish women were enslaved and trafficked to Europe.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} Muslim families tried to ransom their daughters, mothers and wives who had been captured and enslaved.{{sfn|Salzmann|2013|p=397}} Muslim women were kept as concubines by Christian men.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret C.

Many women would convert to their master's religion.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} In one case an Algerian woman, Fatima, was captured and enslaved. She converted to Christianity and refused the ransom which the [[Turkish people|Turks]] had sent for her release. Other enslaved Muslim women had more \"harrowing\" experiences in being converted to [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Bekkaoui|2010|p=10}}\n\nIn India, the Hindu  elites and rulers would take revenge by taking Muslim women into their own harems.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} [[Rana Kumbha]] captured Muslim women. Under [[Medini Rai]] in [[Malwa]], the Rajputs took Muslim and [[Syed|Sayyid]] women as slave girls.{{sfn|Sharma|2011|p=101}} According to [[Niccolao Manucci|Manucci]], the Marathas and [[Sikhs]] would also capture Muslim women because 'the Mahomedans had interfered with Hindu women.'{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIslamic jurists had completely forbidden the enslavement of Muslims. However, Muslims have still at times enslaved Muslims from other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=53}} The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Muhammad II of C\u00f3rdoba]] gave orders that the Berber houses in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] be looted and that Berber women be captured and sold in Dar-al Banat.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=166}} In another case the Andalusian ruler of [[M\u00e1laga|Malaga]], Ibn Hassun, unsuccessfully attempted to kill his female relatives before the Berber [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] could capture them. He committed suicide but his daughters survived. These girls were then sold and some of them were taken as concubines by Almohad military commanders.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=168}}\n\nIn India attitudes towards women ignored their religious background if they belonged to enemies or rebels. [[Ferishta]] narrates that Baban captured female supporters of the rebellious noble [[Tughral Tughan Khan|Tughral]]. The atrocities of [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khilji]] on women have been documented in [[Tabaqat-i-Akbari]] by [[Nizamuddin Ahmad]].  [[Khusrau Khan]] humiliated [[Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah|Sultan Qutb ud din Mubarak]] by marrying his widow and allowing Hindus to take away his other female relatives. [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu Fazl]] records atrocities by [[Kamran Mirza|Kamran]] on the female relatives of [[Humayun]]'s supporters. [[Sher Shah Suri|Sher Shah]] was reported to have sold the wives of rebellious zamindars.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=64}}\n\n[[Kurds]] in the Ottoman-Persian frontier would enslave both Shias and Yazidis. The Ottoman jurist [[Ebussuud Efendi|Ebu Su'ud]] upheld the permissibility of wars against the Shia but he forbade the taking of Shias as captives. In particular, he also declared that sexual intercourse with Shia female captives was unlawful. However, he endorsed enslavement of Shias in a later fatwa.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=43}} In 1786-7 an Ottoman general enslaved the wives and children of [[Mamluk]] emirs. In the region of modern day [[Chad]], Muslim women and children from [[Sultanate of Bagirmi|Bagirmi]] were enslaved by the ruler of Wadai around 1800.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=44}} \n\n==Abolition==\nMarriage was not the only legal way to have sex in Muslim societies prior to the end of slavery in the 19th and 20th centuries.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=50}} Colonial governments and independent Muslim states restricted slave raids and the slave trade in response to pressure from Western liberals and nascent Muslim abolitionist movements. Eliminating slavery was an even more difficult task. Many Muslim governments refused to sign the international treaties against slavery which the [[League of Nations]] was co-ordinating since 1926. This refusal was also an issue at the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and at the [[Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery|1956 Anti-Slavery Convention]].{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=11}} It was mostly because of the pressure from European colonial powers and economic changes that slavery was abolished. White the institution was eventually abolished, there was no internally well-developed Islamic narrative against slave-ownership.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=54}}\n\nA group of ulama led by Waji al-Din Saharanpuri gave a fatwa in the 1830s that it was lawful to enslave men and women \"who sought refuge\" after battle. Sayyed Imdad Ali Akbarabadi led ulama in publishing a lot of material in defence of traditional kinds of slavery. Sayyid Muhammad Askari condemned the idea of abolishing slavery.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=135}}  In the 19th century some ulama in Cairo refused to allow slave girls, who had been freed under secular law, to marry unless they had obtained permission from their owner.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=138}} After 1882 the Egyptian ulama refused to prohibit slavery on the grounds that the Prophet had never forbidden it. In 1899 a scholar from  [[Al-Azhar University|Al-Azhar]], Shaykh Muhammad Ahmad al-Bulayqi defended concubinage and refuted modernist arguments.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=139}} Most ulama in [[West Africa]] opposed abolition.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=144-145}} They ruled that concubinage was still allowed with women of slave descent.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=145}} \n\nIn 1911 one Qadi in Mombasa ruled that no government can free a slave without the owner's permission.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=146}} [[J. Spencer Trimingham|Spencer Trimingham]] observed that in coastal Arab areas masters continued to take concubines from slave families because the descendants of slaves are still enslaved under religious law even if they have been freed according to secular law.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=147}} [[Armenians]] and other Christian rebels who had been enslaved in [[World War I]] were considered to be \"people of the book\" who had violated their contract. Hence, one [[Palestinian]] shaykh ruled that Muslims could buy those Christian girls from the slave markets in the Levant.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=141-142}} \n\nA conservative [[Deobandi]] scholar published a book in [[Lahore]] in 1946 in which he denied that the Prophet had ever encouraged the abolition of slavery.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=135}} After 1947, the ulama in Pakistan called for the revival of slavery. The wish to enslave enemies and take concubines was noted in the [[Punjab Disturbances Court of Inquiry|Munir Commission Report]]. When [[Zia ul Haq]] came to power in 1977 and started applying sharia, some argued that the reward for freeing slaves meant that slavery should not be abolished \"since to do so would be to deny future generations the opportunity to commit the virtuous deed of freeing slaves.\"{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=189}} [[Muhammad Taqi Usmani|Mufti Taqi Usmani]] states that slavery and turning captives into concubines is still allowed by Islam. However, he states that due to the fact that most Muslim countries have signed international treaties which prohibit enslavement, the Muslim countries should not enslave prisoners of war as long as other nations also refrain from enslavement.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Usmani |first1=Muftii Taqi |title=Slavery in Islam |url=https://www.deoband.org/2013/01/hadith/hadith-commentary/slavery-in-islam/ |website=Deoband.org}}</ref>\n\nA lot of ulama in Mauritania did not recognise the legitimacy of abolishing slavery. In 1981 a group of ulama argued that only owners could free their slaves and that the Mauritanian government was breaking a fundamental religious rule. In 1997 one [[Mauritanian]] scholar stated that abolition:{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=147}}\n\n<blockquote>\"is contrary to the teachings of the fundamental text of Islamic law, the Koran... [and] amounts to the expropriation from Muslims of their gods, goods that were acquired legally. The state, if it is Islamic, does not have the right to seize my house, my wife or my slave.\"</blockquote>\n\nIn response to the enslavement of [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] women by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] the [[Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations|Council on American-Islamic Relations]] and Fiqh Council of North America claimed that no scholar disputes the abolition of slavery was one of the aims of Islam. However, [[Kecia Ali]] finds this claim dishonest. While there was definitely  an \u201cemancipatory ethic\u201d (encouragement for freeing slaves) in Islamic jurisprudence, slavery was never actually abolished.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=6}} The translator of [[Ibn Kathir]]'s treatise on slaves, Umar ibn Sulayman Hafyan, felt obliged to explain why he published a slave treatise when [[slavery]] no longer exists. He states that just because slavery no longer exists does not mean that the laws about slavery have been abrogated. Moreover, slavery was only abolished half a century ago and could return in the future.  His comments were a reflection of the predicament modern Muslims find themselves in.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=304}}\n===Modernist and reformist abolition movements===\nThe first and most radical Muslim abolitionists were modernist thinkers in British India in the 1870s.

This was a mainly jihadi force fighting the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army|SPLA]] which they considered to be an \"enemy of Islam and the Arabs.\"{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=24-25}} Arab raiders destroyed black Christian villages, executed all their  males and then took away the women and children as slaves.{{sfn|Islam's Black Slaves|2001|p=138}} \n\nRegular soldiers also abducted women and children. The Sudanese government allowed soldiers to take booty to supplement their low salaries. The first slave raid on the [[Dinka]] took place on February 1986.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=25}} Two thousand women and children were taken. In a second raid on February 1987 one thousand women and children were taken. Once the raiders acquired enough booty they would distribute the captives between their selves and their families. Slave raids continued every year after 1985.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=26}} Dinka girls kept in Arab households were used as sex-slaves.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=35}} Some of them were sold to Arab men in [[Libya]], It has been alleged that slave markets were set up in Sudan. Western visitors noted that five or even more slaves could be bought for one rifle. Near the peak of the civil war in 1989 female black slaves were sold for 90 dollars at the slave markets. Several years later, when there was an abundance of slaves, the price of an average female black slave had dropped to $15. Many Western organisations traveled to Sudan with funds collected for the purpose of purchasing these slaves to emancipate them.{{sfn|Islam's Black Slaves|2001|p=138}}\n\n==Modern Muslim attitudes==\nWhile classical [[Sharia|Islamic law]] permits sexual slavery, the vast majority of Muslims today oppose it. This contradiction is demonstrated by Ahmed Hassan, a twentieth century translator of Sahih Muslim, who prefaced the translated chapter on marriage by claiming that Islam only allows sex within marriage. This was despite the fact that the same chapter included many references to Muslim men having sex with slave-girls.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=107}} Most ordinary Muslims ignore the existence of slavery and concubinage in Islamic history and texts. Most also ignore the millennia old consensus permitting it and a few writers even claim that those Islamic jurists who allowed sexual relations outside marriage with female slaves were mistaken.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=108}} For example, [[Muhammad Asad]], rejected the notion of any sexual relationship outside of marriage.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Asad|first=Muhammad|title=The Message of the Quran.

Note 32|publisher=|year=1982|isbn=1567441386|location=|pages=|quote=This passage lays down in an unequivocal manner that sexual relations with female slaves are permitted only on the basis of marriage, and that in this respect there is no difference between them and free women; consequently, concubinage is ruled out.}}</ref> [[Asifa Quraishi]] personally concludes that she is \"not convinced that sex with one's slave is approved by the Quran in the first place\", claiming that reading the respective Quranic section has led her to \"different conclusions than that held by the majority of classical muslim jurists.\"{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nAsifa Quraishi-Landes also observes that most Muslims believe that sex is only permissible within marriage and they ignore the permission for keeping concubines in Islamic jurisprudence.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=182}} Furthermore, the majority of modern Muslims are not aware that Islamic jurists had made an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} and many modern Muslims would be offended by the idea that a [[husband]] owns his wife's private parts under Islamic law.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=182}} A modern scholar on Islamic legal history made an assertion that the Quran does not allow non-consensual sex between masters and female slaves. However, Kecia Ali states that this view is not found anywhere in the pre-modern Islamic legal tradition.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Islamic views on slavery]]\n* [[Polygamy in Islam]]\n* [[Rape in Islamic law]]\n* [[What your right hands possess]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4|pages=196\u2013225|DOI=10.1163/2405836X-00402004| ref = {{sfnRef|Pernilla|2019}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Asifa Quraishi-Landes|title=Feminism, Law, and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfkFDAAAQBAJ|date=15 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-13579-1|chapter=A Meditation on Mahr, Modernity, and Muslim Marriage Contract Law| ref = {{sfnRef|Quraishi-Landes|2016}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Kecia Ali|title=Sexual Ethics and Islam: Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith and Jurisprudence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=my4XCwAAQBAJ|date=21 December 2015|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-853-5| ref = {{sfnRef|Ali|2015}}}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Ali |first1=Kecia |title=Sexual Ethics and Islam : Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith, and Jurisprudence |date=2016 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |ref = {{sfnRef|Ali|2016}}}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Saad |first1=Salma |title=The legal and social status of women in the Hadith literature |date=1990 |page=242|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/508/1/uk_bl_ethos_443314.pdf| ref = {{sfnRef|Saad|1990}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Y.

S. Anderson]], produced by [[Lawrence Kasanoff]], and starring [[Robin Shou]], [[Linden Ashby]], [[Bridgette Wilson]] and [[Christopher Lambert]]. It is a loose adaptation of the early entries in the [[fighting game]] series ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' and the first installment of the live-action [[Mortal Kombat (film series)|''Mortal Kombat'' film series]].\n\nThe plot of the film follows the warrior monk [[Liu Kang]], the actor [[Johnny Cage]], and the soldier [[Sonya Blade]], all three guided by the god [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] (spelled Rayden in the movie), on their journey to combat the evil sorcerer [[Shang Tsung]] and his forces in a tournament to save Earth. The film's primary source material was 1992's [[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|original game of the same title]], but it was also inspired by and incorporates elements of 1993's follow-up game ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]''.\n\n''Mortal Kombat'', a Lawrence Kasanoff/[[Threshold Entertainment]] production in association with [[Midway Games]], was filmed primarily in Los Angeles, as well as on location in Thailand, and premiered on August 18, 1995 in the United States. It received mixed reviews from the critics with praise towards its martial art sequences, atmosphere, exotic locations and production values whereas the performances were criticized along with the simple script and the PG-13 rating. Its tie-in media included hit soundtracks ''[[Mortal Kombat: Original Motion Picture Score]]'', ''[[Mortal Kombat: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat: More Kombat]]'', and an animated film, ''Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins''.\n\n''Mortal Kombat'' spent three weeks as the number-one film at the U.S. box office, earning over $122 million worldwide. Threshold Entertainment followed with a 1997 sequel film, ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]'', and created two spin-off television series, ''[[Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat: Conquest]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nMortal Kombat is a martial arts tournament that takes place once every generation between the representatives of the realms of Earth and Outworld conceived by the [[Elder Gods (Mortal Kombat)|Elder Gods]] amid looming invasion of the Earth by Outworld. If the realm of Outworld wins ten consecutive victories, its [[Shao Kahn|Emperor, Shao Kahn]] will be able to invade and conquer the Earthrealm. They have already won nine times. \n[[File:01-\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e23\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e0a\u0e0d\u0e4c.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|[[Wat Phra Si Sanphet]] was used in the film's opening for a fight between Shang Tsung and Liu Kang's brother]]\n[[Shaolin Kung Fu|Shaolin monk]] [[Liu Kang]] and his comrades, action movie star [[Johnny Cage]] and military officer [[Sonya Blade]] were handpicked by [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Rayden]], the god of thunder and defender of the Earth realm, to overcome their powerful adversaries in order to prevent Outworld from winning their tenth straight Mortal Kombat tournament. Each of the three has his or her own reason for competing: Liu seeks revenge against the tournament host [[Shang Tsung]] for killing his brother Chan; Sonya seeks revenge on an Australian crime lord [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]] for murdering a fellow officer; and Cage, having been branded as a fake by the media, seeks to prove otherwise. Johnny and Sonya are unaware of the supernatural and of the true nature of the tournament at first, but are gradually convinced.\n\n[[File:Phra Nang beach panorama 1.jpg|thumb|Phra Nang beach was used for the fight between Liu Kang and Kitana]]\n\nAt Shang Tsung's island, Liu is attracted to [[Kitana|Princess Kitana]], the Emperor's adopted daughter. Aware that Kitana is a dangerous adversary because she is the rightful heir to Outworld and that she will attempt to ally herself with the Earth warriors, Tsung orders the creature [[Reptile (Mortal Kombat)|Reptile]] to spy on her. Liu defeats his first opponent and Sonya gets her revenge on Kano by snapping his neck. Cage encounters and barely beats [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]]. Liu engages in a brief duel with Kitana, who secretly offers him cryptic advice for his next battle. Liu's next opponent is [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]], whose defense seems untouched because of his ice powers until Liu recalls Kitana's advice and uses it to kill Sub-Zero.\n\nPrince [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]] enters the tournament and crushes every opponent he faces. One of Cage's peers, Art Lean, is defeated by Goro as well and has his soul taken by Shang Tsung. Sonya worries that they may not win against Goro, but Rayden reassures them, declaring that their own fears and egos are preventing them from winning the tournament. Rayden points out Cage's fears of accepting he's a fake, and Sonya's reluctance in accepting help when she needs it, then calls Liu Kang out for fleeing to America, which caused him to disgrace his ancestor and indirectly resulted in his brother's death.\n\n[[File:Wat Ratchaburana Ayutthaya Thailand 03.jpg|thumb|[[Wat Ratchaburana, Ayutthaya]], was used as the place of confrontation between Liu Kang and Rayden]]\n\nDespite Sonya's warnings, Cage approaches Shang Tsung to demand a fight with Goro upon the realization that, as Mortal Kombat, the competition favors the mortal Earthrealm fighters. The sorcerer accepts on the condition that he be allowed to challenge any opponent of his choosing, and though Rayden tries to intervene, he is too late as the conditions are set. He is nonetheless impressed when Cage shows his awareness of the gravity of the tournament. Cage faces Goro and uses guile and the element of surprise to defeat the defending champion, who falls off a cliff to his death. The desperate Tsung abducts Sonya and takes her to Outworld as his chosen opponent. Knowing that his own powers are ineffective there and that Sonya cannot defeat Tsung, Rayden sends Liu and Cage into Outworld in order to rescue Sonya and challenge the sorcerer. In Outworld, Liu is attacked by Reptile, but eventually defeats him. Kitana then meets up with the mortals, revealing to them the origins of both herself and her home realm of Outworld. She helps them to infiltrate Tsung's castle while advising Liu Kang about three challenges in the castle: facing his enemy, himself, and then his worst fear.\n\nInside the castle tower, Shang Tsung attempts to goad Sonya into fighting him, falsely claiming that her refusal to accept will result in the Earthrealm forfeiting the tournament. All seems lost until Kitana, Liu, and Cage, disguised as Tsung's Shadow Priests, appear on the scene. Kitana berates Tsung for his treachery to the Outworld emperor, claiming that his arrogance and greed will cost him the tournament if he doesn't honor his deal. As Johnny frees Sonya, Tsung challenges him to final combat but is counter-challenged by Liu.\n\nDuring the lengthy battle, Liu faces not only Tsung but also the souls of the warriors that Tsung had forcibly taken in past tournaments. In a last-ditch attempt to take advantage, Tsung morphs into Liu's deceased brother Chan. Seeing through the charade, Liu renews his determination and ultimately fires an energy blast at the sorcerer, knocking him off a ledge and fatally impaling him on a spike bed. Tsung's death releases all of the captive souls, including Chan's. Before ascending to the afterlife, Chan tells Liu that he will remain with him in spirit until they are once again reunited.\n\nThe fighters return to Earthrealm, where a victory celebration is taking place at the Shaolin temple, but the jubilation halts when a giant figure suddenly appears in the roiling and darkened sky; the Emperor has come for the fighters' souls. Rayden declares \"I don't think so,\" and the warriors take up fighting stances.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christopher Lambert]] as [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Rayden]], god of thunder and protector of Earthrealm who guides the warriors on their journey. He desires to aid the heroes in defending Earthrealm, but as he himself is not mortal, he is not permitted to participate in the tournament and may only advise them and act to prevent cheating.\n* [[Robin Shou]] as [[Liu Kang]], a former Shaolin monk, who enters the tournament to avenge his brother's death. He is also Kitana's love interest and among the first who notice her sympathy towards Earthrealm. As in most of the games in the ''Mortal Kombat'' series, Liu Kang is the main protagonist. This was Shou's second American film, as his first American role was in 1990, the made-for-television film ''[[Forbidden Nights]]''.\n* [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]] as [[Shang Tsung]], a powerful, sadistic and treacherous demon sorcerer, he is the film's main antagonist who kills Liu Kang's brother Chan. Tagawa was the filmmakers' first and only choice for the role; he was instantly selected after he came to his audition in costume, and read his lines while standing on a chair.<ref name=\"MKBook\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0761500820|title=Goldman, Michael.

Ashby trained in [[karate]], [[tae kwon do]], and [[kung fu]] especially for this film.

The Outworld exterior scenes were filmed at the abandoned [[Kaiser Steel|Kaiser]] steel mill (now the [[Auto Club Speedway]]) in [[Fontana, California]], while all of Goro's scenes were filmed in Los Angeles. Shooting locations in Thailand were accessible only by boat, so cast, crew and equipment had to be transported on long canoe-style vessels.

On the way they meet Rayden, who provides them with some hints about how to survive the tournament and defeat Shang Tsung and his army of Tarkatan minions. Upon arriving at the island where the battles takes place, Rayden retells the origins of Shang Tsung, Goro, Scorpion, Sub-Zero and the [[Great Kung Lao]] in between fight scenes.\n\nThe film featured a combination of [[traditional animation]], [[motion capture]], and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] to explain the origins behind some of the movie's main characters, as well as a fifteen-minute behind-the-scenes documentary of the theatrical release.

The film also stars [[Brian Thompson]], [[Sandra Hess]], [[Lynn \"Red\" Williams]], [[Irina Pantaeva]], [[Marjean Holden]] and [[James Remar]]. Its storyline is largely an adaptation of ''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'', following a band of warriors as they attempt to save Earth from Shao Kahn himself. Although the story picks up where the last film left off, most of the lead roles were recast.\n\nIn contrast to its predecessor, which was a box office success and marginally well-received, ''Annihilation'' was critically panned and underperformed at the box office. As a result, development of the planned third installment halted and never progressed beyond pre-production. In July 2009, actors Chris Casamassa (Scorpion) and Linden Ashby (Johnny Cage) separately announced that they would be reprising their respective roles from the original film, with Casamassa additionally claiming that filming would begin in September of that year,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/blogs/sidebar/909182374/26950479/third-mortal-kombat-movie-filming-in-september-report.html|title=Third Mortal Kombat movie filming in September - Report|author=Polybren|date=2009-07-08|accessdate=2009-07-16|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712140445/http://www.gamespot.com/news/blogs/sidebar/909182374/26950479/third-mortal-kombat-movie-filming-in-september-report.html|archivedate=2009-07-12|url-status=dead|publisher=GameSpot.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truveo.com/Linden-Ashby-talks-about-Mortal-Kombat-3/id/282147513|title=Linden Ashby talks about Mortal Kombat}}</ref> but the project did not commence production.\n\n===Spin-off TV series===\nTwo television series, the animated series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm]]'' and the live-action series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Conquest]]'', were produced by Threshold Entertainment between 1996 and 1999.\n\n===Reboot===\nIt was announced that a [[Mortal Kombat (2021 film)|reboot film]] is currently under development and scheduled for release by [[Warner Bros.

S. Anderson]], produced by [[Lawrence Kasanoff]], and starring [[Robin Shou]], [[Linden Ashby]], [[Bridgette Wilson]] and [[Christopher Lambert]]. It is a loose adaptation of the early entries in the [[fighting game]] series ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' and the first installment of the live-action [[Mortal Kombat (film series)|''Mortal Kombat'' film series]].\n\nThe plot of the film follows the warrior monk [[Liu Kang]], the actor [[Johnny Cage]], and the soldier [[Sonya Blade]], all three guided by the god [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] (spelled Rayden in the movie), on their journey to combat the evil sorcerer [[Shang Tsung]] and his forces in a tournament to save Earth. The film's primary source material was 1992's [[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|original game of the same title]], but it was also inspired by and incorporates elements of 1993's follow-up game ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]''.\n\n''Mortal Kombat'', a Lawrence Kasanoff/[[Threshold Entertainment]] production in association with [[Midway Games]], was filmed primarily in Los Angeles, as well as on location in Thailand, and premiered on August 18, 1995 in the United States. It received mixed reviews from the critics with praise towards its martial art sequences, atmosphere, exotic locations and production values whereas the performances were criticized along with the simple script and the PG-13 rating. Its tie-in media included hit soundtracks ''[[Mortal Kombat: Original Motion Picture Score]]'', ''[[Mortal Kombat: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat: More Kombat]]'', and an animated film, ''Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins''.\n\n''Mortal Kombat'' spent three weeks as the number-one film at the U.S. box office, earning over $122 million worldwide. Threshold Entertainment followed with a 1997 sequel film, ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]'', and created two spin-off television series, ''[[Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat: Conquest]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nMortal Kombat is a martial arts tournament that takes place once every generation between the representatives of the realms of Earth and Outworld conceived by the [[Elder Gods (Mortal Kombat)|Elder Gods]] amid looming invasion of the Earth by Outworld. If the realm of Outworld wins ten consecutive victories, its [[Shao Kahn|Emperor, Shao Kahn]] will be able to invade and conquer the Earthrealm. They have already won nine times. \n[[File:01-\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e23\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e0a\u0e0d\u0e4c.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|[[Wat Phra Si Sanphet]] was used in the film's opening for a fight between Shang Tsung and Liu Kang's brother]]\n[[Shaolin Kung Fu|Shaolin monk]] [[Liu Kang]] and his comrades, action movie star [[Johnny Cage]] and military officer [[Sonya Blade]] were handpicked by [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Rayden]], the god of thunder and defender of the Earth realm, to overcome their powerful adversaries in order to prevent Outworld from winning their tenth straight Mortal Kombat tournament. Each of the three has his or her own reason for competing: Liu seeks revenge against the tournament host [[Shang Tsung]] for killing his brother Chan; Sonya seeks revenge on an Australian crime lord [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]] for murdering a fellow officer; and Cage, having been branded as a fake by the media, seeks to prove otherwise. Johnny and Sonya are unaware of the supernatural and of the true nature of the tournament at first, but are gradually convinced.\n\n[[File:Phra Nang beach panorama 1.jpg|thumb|Phra Nang beach was used for the fight between Liu Kang and Kitana]]\n\nAt Shang Tsung's island, Liu is attracted to [[Kitana|Princess Kitana]], the Emperor's adopted daughter. Aware that Kitana is a dangerous adversary because she is the rightful heir to Outworld and that she will attempt to ally herself with the Earth warriors, Tsung orders the creature [[Reptile (Mortal Kombat)|Reptile]] to spy on her. Liu defeats his first opponent and Sonya gets her revenge on Kano by snapping his neck. Cage encounters and barely beats [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]]. Liu engages in a brief duel with Kitana, who secretly offers him cryptic advice for his next battle. Liu's next opponent is [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]], whose defense seems untouched because of his ice powers until Liu recalls Kitana's advice and uses it to kill Sub-Zero.\n\nPrince [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]] enters the tournament and crushes every opponent he faces. One of Cage's peers, Art Lean, is defeated by Goro as well and has his soul taken by Shang Tsung. Sonya worries that they may not win against Goro, but Rayden reassures them, declaring that their own fears and egos are preventing them from winning the tournament. Rayden points out Cage's fears of accepting he's a fake, and Sonya's reluctance in accepting help when she needs it, then calls Liu Kang out for fleeing to America, which caused him to disgrace his ancestor and indirectly resulted in his brother's death.\n\n[[File:Wat Ratchaburana Ayutthaya Thailand 03.jpg|thumb|[[Wat Ratchaburana, Ayutthaya]], was used as the place of confrontation between Liu Kang and Rayden]]\n\nDespite Sonya's warnings, Cage approaches Shang Tsung to demand a fight with Goro upon the realization that, as Mortal Kombat, the competition favors the mortal Earthrealm fighters. The sorcerer accepts on the condition that he be allowed to challenge any opponent of his choosing, and though Rayden tries to intervene, he is too late as the conditions are set. He is nonetheless impressed when Cage shows his awareness of the gravity of the tournament. Cage faces Goro and uses guile and the element of surprise to defeat the defending champion, who falls off a cliff to his death. The desperate Tsung abducts Sonya and takes her to Outworld as his chosen opponent. Knowing that his own powers are ineffective there and that Sonya cannot defeat Tsung, Rayden sends Liu and Cage into Outworld in order to rescue Sonya and challenge the sorcerer. In Outworld, Liu is attacked by Reptile, but eventually defeats him. Kitana then meets up with the mortals, revealing to them the origins of both herself and her home realm of Outworld. She helps them to infiltrate Tsung's castle while advising Liu Kang about three challenges in the castle: facing his enemy, himself, and then his worst fear.\n\nInside the castle tower, Shang Tsung attempts to goad Sonya into fighting him, falsely claiming that her refusal to accept will result in the Earthrealm forfeiting the tournament. All seems lost until Kitana, Liu, and Cage, disguised as Tsung's Shadow Priests, appear on the scene. Kitana berates Tsung for his treachery to the Outworld emperor, claiming that his arrogance and greed will cost him the tournament if he doesn't honor his deal. As Johnny frees Sonya, Tsung challenges him to final combat but is counter-challenged by Liu.\n\nDuring the lengthy battle, Liu faces not only Tsung but also the souls of the warriors that Tsung had forcibly taken in past tournaments. In a last-ditch attempt to take advantage, Tsung morphs into Liu's deceased brother Chan. Seeing through the charade, Liu renews his determination and ultimately fires an energy blast at the sorcerer, knocking him off a ledge and fatally impaling him on a spike bed. Tsung's death releases all of the captive souls, including Chan's. Before ascending to the afterlife, Chan tells Liu that he will remain with him in spirit until they are once again reunited.\n\nThe fighters return to Earthrealm, where a victory celebration is taking place at the Shaolin temple, but the jubilation halts when a giant figure suddenly appears in the roiling and darkened sky; the Emperor has come for the fighters' souls. Rayden declares \"I don't think so,\" and the warriors take up fighting stances.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Christopher Lambert]] as [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Rayden]], god of thunder and protector of Earthrealm who guides the warriors on their journey. He desires to aid the heroes in defending Earthrealm, but as he himself is not mortal, he is not permitted to participate in the tournament and may only advise them and act to prevent cheating.\n* [[Robin Shou]] as [[Liu Kang]], a former Shaolin monk, who enters the tournament to avenge his brother's death. He is also Kitana's love interest and among the first who notice her sympathy towards Earthrealm. As in most of the games in the ''Mortal Kombat'' series, Liu Kang is the main protagonist. This was Shou's second American film, as his first American role was in 1990, the made-for-television film ''[[Forbidden Nights]]''.\n* [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]] as [[Shang Tsung]], a powerful, sadistic and treacherous demon sorcerer, he is the film's main antagonist who kills Liu Kang's brother Chan.

Shang Tsung's soul-stealing power was first visualized in ''MKII'' as one of his [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatality]] finishing moves, while Liu Kang uses his \"Bicycle Kick\" special move from the game. After he kills Scorpion in his fight, Cage then drops an autographed picture of himself near his remains, in a reference to his [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)#Friendship|Friendship]] finishing move. Shang Tsung's robed Shadow Priests, seen before the final battle, were first seen in the second game as background characters.\n\n[[Cameron Diaz]] was originally cast as Sonya Blade, but dropped out due to a wrist injury and was replaced by Bridgette Wilson.<ref>{{cite web|last=Couch|first=Aaron|title='Mortal Kombat': Untold Story of the Movie That \"Kicked the Hell\" Out of Everyone|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/mortal-kombat-movie-oral-history-815287|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=August 18, 2015|accessdate=September 14, 2016}}</ref> [[Steve James (actor)|Steve James]] was originally cast to play Jax, but he died from [[pancreatic cancer]] a year before production on the film began.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chud.com/140242/chud-salutes-steve-james/ |title=CHUD Salutes\u2026 Steve James |publisher=CHUD|date= July 2, 2013|accessdate=January 26, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707003054/http://www.chud.com/140242/chud-salutes-steve-james/|archivedate=July 7, 2013}}</ref> [[Brandon Lee]] was the filmmakers' first choice to play Johnny Cage, but his death at the set of ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'' forced them to re-cast the role.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] was offered the role but turned it down in order to do ''[[Street Fighter (1994 film)|Street Fighter]]'' and the role eventually went to Linden Ashby.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} [[Russell Wong]], [[Dustin Nguyen]], [[Keith Cooke]] and [[Phillip Rhee]] all auditioned for the role of Liu Kang.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| width = \n| align =\n| image1 = Sunset at Wat Chaiwatthanaram, Ayutthaya, Thailand.jpg\n| image2 = Railay Beach Panorama.jpeg\n| footer = \n| direction = vertical\n| caption1 = [[Wat Chaiwatthanaram]] was used as the film's Order of Light temple\n| caption2 =[[Railay Beach]] was used as the entrance to Shang Tsung's fortress\n}}\n\nFilming began in August 1994 and ended in December 1994.

Shooting locations in Thailand were accessible only by boat, so cast, crew and equipment had to be transported on long canoe-style vessels. [[Location manager]] Gerrit Folsom constructed an outhouse in a secluded area near the set in order to alleviate the problem of repeated trips to and from the mainland. Filming locations in Thailand include the [[Wat Phra Si Sanphet]] and [[Wat Ratchaburana, Ayutthaya|Wat Ratchaburana]] temples. The arrival of Earth's contestants via boats, Liu Kang's meditation scene and the fight between Liu Kang and Kitana were filmed at the [[Railay Beach]] and the Phra Nang Beach, respectively. The bows of the boats were fitted with ornamental dragon-head carvings and used in the movie as the fighters' secondary transport to Shang Tsung's island from his personal [[Junk (ship)|junk]].<ref name=MKBook/>\n\nRobin Shou said that in the original script he \"was supposed to fall in love with Talisa Soto [Kitana].

On the way they meet Rayden, who provides them with some hints about how to survive the tournament and defeat Shang Tsung and his army of Tarkatan minions. Upon arriving at the island where the battles takes place, Rayden retells the origins of Shang Tsung, Goro, Scorpion, Sub-Zero and the [[Great Kung Lao]] in between fight scenes.\n\nThe film featured a combination of [[traditional animation]], [[motion capture]], and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] to explain the origins behind some of the movie's main characters, as well as a fifteen-minute behind-the-scenes documentary of the theatrical release.

The film also stars [[Brian Thompson]], [[Sandra Hess]], [[Lynn \"Red\" Williams]], [[Irina Pantaeva]], [[Marjean Holden]] and [[James Remar]]. Its storyline is largely an adaptation of ''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'', following a band of warriors as they attempt to save Earth from Shao Kahn himself. Although the story picks up where the last film left off, most of the lead roles were recast.\n\nIn contrast to its predecessor, which was a box office success and marginally well-received, ''Annihilation'' was critically panned and underperformed at the box office. As a result, development of the planned third installment halted and never progressed beyond pre-production. In July 2009, actors Chris Casamassa (Scorpion) and Linden Ashby (Johnny Cage) separately announced that they would be reprising their respective roles from the original film, with Casamassa additionally claiming that filming would begin in September of that year,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/blogs/sidebar/909182374/26950479/third-mortal-kombat-movie-filming-in-september-report.html|title=Third Mortal Kombat movie filming in September - Report|author=Polybren|date=2009-07-08|accessdate=2009-07-16|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712140445/http://www.gamespot.com/news/blogs/sidebar/909182374/26950479/third-mortal-kombat-movie-filming-in-september-report.html|archivedate=2009-07-12|url-status=dead|publisher=GameSpot.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truveo.com/Linden-Ashby-talks-about-Mortal-Kombat-3/id/282147513|title=Linden Ashby talks about Mortal Kombat}}</ref> but the project did not commence production.\n\n===Spin-off TV series===\nTwo television series, the animated series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm]]'' and the live-action series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Conquest]]'', were produced by Threshold Entertainment between 1996 and 1999.\n\n===Reboot===\nIt was announced that a [[Mortal Kombat (2021 film)|reboot film]] is currently under development and scheduled for release by [[Warner Bros.

Although the ''Buran'' class was similar in appearance to [[NASA]]'s [[Space Shuttle orbiter]], and could similarly operate as a [[re-entry]] [[spaceplane]], its internal and functional design was distinct.  For example, the main engines during launch were on the Energia rocket and were not taken into orbit by the spacecraft. Smaller rocket engines on the craft's body provided propulsion in orbit and de-orbital burns, similar to the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|OMS pods]].\n\n== Introduction ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2015}}\nThe Buran orbital vehicle programme was developed in response to the U.S. Space Shuttle programme, which in the 1980s raised considerable concerns among the Soviet military and especially Defense Minister [[Dmitry Ustinov]].  An authoritative chronicler of the Soviet and later Russian space programmes, the academic [[Boris Chertok]], recounts how the programme came into being.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4110/vol3.pdf|first=Boris|last=Chertok|author-link=Boris Chertok|publisher=Books Express Publishing|asin-tld=B01AZXNJLS|chapter=Volume III: Hot Days of the Cold War|title=Rockets & People, Volumes I\u2013IV (NASA History Series) |year=2005}}</ref>\nAccording to Chertok, after the U.S. developed its Space Shuttle programme, the Soviet military became suspicious that it could be used for military purposes, due to its enormous payload, several times that of previous U.S. launch vehicles. The Soviet government asked the [[TsNIIMash]] (\u0426\u041d\u0418\u0418\u041c\u0410\u0428, Central Institute of Machine-building, a major player in defense analysis) for an expert opinion. Lieutenant General Yuri Mozzhorin recalled that by \"approximately 1965,\" when the Soviet Union had the 'long arm' ([[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBMs]]), the Soviets did not expect war \"and thought it would not happen.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Green|first1=Brendan R.|last2=Long|first2=Austin |title=The MAD Who Wasn't There: Soviet Reactions to the Late Cold War Nuclear Balance|date=2017|journal=Security Studies|doi=10.1080/09636412.2017.1331639|volume=26|issue=4|department=Perceptions of the Nuclear Balance over Time|pages=606\u2013641}}</ref> As institute director, Mozzhorin, recalled that for a long time the institute could not envisage a civilian payload large enough to require a vehicle of that capacity.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nOfficially, the Buran orbital vehicle was designed for the delivery to orbit and return to Earth of spacecraft, cosmonauts, and supplies. Both Chertok and [[Gleb Lozino-Lozinskiy]] (Chief Designer of [[S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia|RKK Energia]]) suggest that from the beginning, the programme was military in nature; however, the exact military capabilities, or intended capabilities, of the ''Buran'' programme remain classified. Commenting on the discontinuation of the programme in his interview to ''[[New Scientist]]'', Russian [[cosmonaut]] [[Oleg Kotov]] confirms their accounts:\n\n{{Quotation|We had no civilian tasks for ''Buran'' and the military ones were no longer needed.

Of these, only the [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] and [[X-37]] [[spaceflight]]s were [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|uncrewed]].]]\n\n=== Background ===\nThe Soviet reusable space-craft programme has its roots in the very beginning of the space age, the late 1950s. The idea of Soviet reusable space flight is very old, though it was neither continuous, nor consistently organized. Before Buran, no project of the programme reached production.\n\nThe idea saw its first iteration in the [[Burya]] high-altitude jet aircraft, which reached the prototype stage. Several test flights are known, before it was cancelled by order of the [[Central Committee]]. The [[Burya]] had the goal of delivering a nuclear payload, presumably to the United States, and then returning to base. The cancellation was based on a final decision to develop [[ICBM]]s. The next iteration of the idea was [[Zvezda (spacecraft)|Zvezda]] from the early 1960s, which also reached a prototype stage. Decades later, [[Zvezda (ISS module)|another project with the same name]] was used as a service module for the [[International Space Station]]. After Zvezda, there was a hiatus in reusable projects until Buran.\n\n=== Programme development ===\nThe development of the Buran began in the early 1970s as a response to the U.S. Space Shuttle program. Soviet officials were concerned about a perceived military threat posed by the U.S. Space Shuttle. In their opinion, the Shuttle's 30-ton payload-to-orbit capacity and, more significantly, its 15-ton payload return capacity, were a clear indication that one of its main objectives would be to place massive experimental laser weapons into orbit that could destroy enemy missiles from a distance of several thousands of kilometers. Their reasoning was that such weapons could only be effectively tested in actual space conditions and that to cut their development time and save costs it would be necessary to regularly bring them back to Earth for modifications and fine-tuning.{{sfn|Hendrickx|Vis|2007}} Soviet officials were also concerned that the U.S. Space Shuttle could make a sudden dive into the atmosphere to drop bombs on Moscow.<ref name=\"BBC Buran\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7738489.stm |title=Buran \u2013 the Soviet 'space shuttle' |work=BBC News |first=Anatoly |last=Zak |date=20 November 2008 |accessdate=7 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nSoviet [[engineers]] were initially reluctant to design a spacecraft that looked superficially identical to the Shuttle, but subsequent [[wind tunnel]] testing showed that NASA's design was already ideal.<ref>{{cite book |title=Spaceflight: The Complete Story From Sputnik to Shuttle\u2014and Beyond |publisher=DK Publishers |first=Giles |last=Sparrow |year=2009 |page=215 |isbn=9780756656416}}</ref> Even though the Molniya Scientific Production Association proposed its [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-105|Spiral]] programme design (halted 13 years earlier), it was rejected as being altogether dissimilar from the American shuttle design.  While [[NPO Molniya]] conducted development under the lead of [[Gleb Lozino-Lozinskiy]], the Soviet Union's Military-Industrial Commission, or VPK, was tasked with collecting all data it could on the U.S. Space Shuttle. Under the auspices of the KGB, the VPK was able to amass documentation on the American shuttle's airframe designs, design analysis software, materials, flight computer systems and propulsion systems.  The KGB targeted many university research project documents and databases, including Caltech, MIT, Princeton, Stanford and others. The thoroughness of the acquisition of data was made much easier as the U.S. shuttle development was unclassified.<ref name=\"NBC News\">{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18686090/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/how-soviets-stole-space-shuttle/ |title=How the Soviets stole a space shuttle |work=NBC News |last=Windrem |first=Robert |date=4 November 1997}}</ref>\n\nThe construction of the shuttles began in 1980, and by 1984 the first full-scale Buran was rolled out. The first [[sub-orbital flight|suborbital]] test flight of a scale-model ([[BOR-5]]) took place as early as July 1983. As the project progressed, five additional scale-model flights were performed.  A test vehicle was constructed with four jet engines mounted at the rear; this vehicle is usually referred to as [[OK-GLI]], or as the \"Buran aerodynamic analogue\". The jets were used to take off from a normal landing strip, and once it reached a designated point, the engines were cut and OK-GLI glided back to land. This provided invaluable information about the handling characteristics of the Buran design, and significantly differed from the carrier plane/air drop method used by the United States and the {{OV|101|full=no}} test craft. Twenty-four test flights of OK-GLI were performed by the [[Gromov Flight Research Institute]] [[test pilot]]s and researchers after which the shuttle was \"worn out\". The developers considered using a couple of [[Mil Mi-26]] [[helicopter]]s to \"bundle\" lift the Buran, but test flights with a [[mock-up]] showed how risky and impractical that was.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buran-energia.com/documentation/documentation-akc-air-transportation.php |title=BURAN Orbital Spaceship Airframe Creation |work=Buran-Energia.com |first=V.

In 1983 the Buran developers estimated that the software development would require several thousand programmers if done with their existing methodology (in assembly language), and they appealed to [[Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics]] for assistance. It was decided to develop a new high-level \"problem-oriented\" programming language.

All had experience as test pilots. They were: [[Ivan Ivanovich Bachurin]], [[Alexei Sergeyevich Borodai]], [[Anatoli Levchenko|Anatoli Semyonovich Levchenko]], [[Aleksandr Vladimirovich Shchukin]], [[Rimantas Stankevi\u010dius|Rimantas Antanas Stankevi\u010dius]], [[Igor Volk|Igor Petrovich Volk]] and [[Viktor Vasiliyevich Zabolotsky]].\n\nA rule, set in place for cosmonauts because of the failed [[Soyuz 25]] of 1977, insisted that all Soviet space missions contain at least one crew member who has been to space before. In 1982, it was decided that all Buran commanders and their back-ups would occupy the third seat on a Soyuz mission, prior to their Buran spaceflight. Several people had been selected to potentially be in the first Buran crew. By 1985, it was decided that at least one of the two crew members would be a [[test pilot]] trained at the [[Gromov Flight Research Institute]] (known as \"LII\"), and potential crew lists were drawn up. Only two potential Buran crew members reached space: [[Igor Volk]], who flew in [[Soyuz T-12]] to the space station [[Salyut 7]], and [[Anatoli Levchenko]] who visited [[Mir]], launching with [[Soyuz TM-4]] and landing with [[Soyuz TM-3]]. Both of these spaceflights lasted about a week.{{sfn|Hendrickx|Vis|2007}}\n\nLevchenko died of a brain tumour the year after his orbital flight, Bachurin left the cosmonaut corps because of medical reasons, Shchukin was assigned to the back-up crew of Soyuz TM-4 and later died in a plane crash, Stankevi\u010dius was also killed in a plane crash, while Borodai and Zabolotsky remained unassigned to a Soyuz flight until the Buran programme ended.\n\n==== Spaceflight of I. P. Volk ====\n{{main|Soyuz T-12}}\n[[Igor Volk]] was planned to be the commander of the first crewed Buran flight. There were two purposes of the Soyuz T-12 mission, one of which was to give Volk spaceflight experience. The other purpose, seen as the more important factor, was to beat the United States and have the first [[Extra-vehicular activity|spacewalk]] by a woman.{{sfn|Hendrickx|Vis|2007}} At the time of the Soyuz T-12 mission the Buran programme was still a [[Classified information|state secret]]. The appearance of Volk as a crew member caused some, including the [[British Interplanetary Society]] magazine ''[[Spaceflight (magazine)|Spaceflight]]'', to ask why a test pilot was occupying a Soyuz seat usually reserved for researchers or foreign cosmonauts.<ref name=VisBook>{{cite book |last=Hendrickx |first=Bart |author2=Bert Vis |title=Energiya-Buran : The Soviet Space Shuttle |publisher=Praxis |date=4 October 2007 |pages=526 |isbn=978-0-387-69848-9}}</ref>\n\n==== Spaceflight of A.

The main hangar at the site, called ''MIK RN'' or ''MIK 112'', was originally built for the assembly of the [[N1 (rocket)|N1 moon rocket]]. After cancellation of the N-1 programme in 1974, the facilities at Site 112 were converted for the Energia-Buran programme.

A purpose-built orbiter landing control facility, housed in a large multi-storey office building, was located near the runway. ''Yubileyniy Airfield'' was also used to receive heavy transport planes carrying elements of the Energia-Buran system.

The collapse killed 8 workers and destroyed one of the Buran craft ([[1.01 (Buran-class spacecraft)|Orbiter K1]]), which flew the test flight in 1988, as well as a [[mock-up]] of an Energia booster rocket.  It was not clear to outsiders at the time which Buran programme craft was destroyed, and the BBC reported that it was just \"a model\" of the orbiter.<ref name=\"buran-bbcColapse\"/> It occurred at the ''MIK RN/MIK 112'' building at Site 112 of the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]], 14 years after the [[Shuttle Buran#First flight|first and only Buran flight]]. Work on the roof had begun for a maintenance project, whose equipment is thought to have contributed to the collapse.

The three [[Space Shuttle main engine]]s were part of the orbiter, and were reused for multiple flights.\n* The core Energia rocket was equipped with its own [[guidance, navigation, and control]] system \u2013 unlike Space Shuttle whose entire control system was in the orbiter.\n* Unlike Space Shuttle's boosters, each of Energia's four boosters had their own guidance, navigation, and control system, which allowed them to be used as launch vehicles on their own to deliver smaller payloads than those requiring the complete Energia-Buran system.\n* Energia could be configured with four, two or no boosters for payloads other than Buran, and in full configuration was able to put up to 100 metric tons into orbit. The [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] was integral to its launch system and was the system's only payload.\n* Energia's four [[Zenit (rocket family)#Energia booster|boosters]] used [[Liquid rocket propellant|liquid propellant]] ([[kerosene]]/[[oxygen]]). The Space Shuttle's two boosters used solid propellant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/returntoflight/system/system_SRB.html |title=Space Shuttle: Solid Rocket Boosters |work=NASA.gov |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref>\n* The liquid fueled booster rockets were not constructed in segments vulnerable to leakage through O-rings, which caused the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|destruction]] of {{OV|099|full=no}}.\n* The Energia rocket was not covered in foam, the shedding of which from the large fuel tank led to the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|destruction]] of {{OV|102|full=no}}.\n* Energia's four boosters were designed to be recovered after each flight, though they were not recovered during Energia's two operational flights.

Although the ''Buran'' class was similar in appearance to [[NASA]]'s [[Space Shuttle orbiter]], and could similarly operate as a [[re-entry]] [[spaceplane]], its internal and functional design was distinct.  For example, the main engines during launch were on the Energia rocket and were not taken into orbit by the spacecraft. Smaller rocket engines on the craft's body provided propulsion in orbit and de-orbital burns, similar to the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|OMS pods]].\n\n== Introduction ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2015}}\nThe Buran orbital vehicle programme was developed in response to the U.S. Space Shuttle programme, which in the 1980s raised considerable concerns among the Soviet military and especially Defense Minister [[Dmitry Ustinov]].  An authoritative chronicler of the Soviet and later Russian space programmes, the academic [[Boris Chertok]], recounts how the programme came into being.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4110/vol3.pdf|first=Boris|last=Chertok|author-link=Boris Chertok|publisher=Books Express Publishing|asin-tld=B01AZXNJLS|chapter=Volume III: Hot Days of the Cold War|title=Rockets & People, Volumes I\u2013IV (NASA History Series) |year=2005}}</ref>\nAccording to Chertok, after the U.S. developed its Space Shuttle programme, the Soviet military became suspicious that it could be used for military purposes, due to its enormous payload, several times that of previous U.S. launch vehicles. The Soviet government asked the [[TsNIIMash]] (\u0426\u041d\u0418\u0418\u041c\u0410\u0428, Central Institute of Machine-building, a major player in defense analysis) for an expert opinion. Lieutenant General Yuri Mozzhorin recalled that by \"approximately 1965,\" when the Soviet Union had the 'long arm' ([[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBMs]]), the Soviets did not expect war \"and thought it would not happen.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Green|first1=Brendan R.|last2=Long|first2=Austin |title=The MAD Who Wasn't There: Soviet Reactions to the Late Cold War Nuclear Balance|date=2017|journal=Security Studies|doi=10.1080/09636412.2017.1331639|volume=26|issue=4|department=Perceptions of the Nuclear Balance over Time|pages=606\u2013641}}</ref> As institute director, Mozzhorin, recalled that for a long time the institute could not envisage a civilian payload large enough to require a vehicle of that capacity.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nOfficially, the Buran orbital vehicle was designed for the delivery to orbit and return to Earth of spacecraft, cosmonauts, and supplies. Both Chertok and [[Gleb Lozino-Lozinskiy]] (Chief Designer of [[S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia|RKK Energia]]) suggest that from the beginning, the programme was military in nature; however, the exact military capabilities, or intended capabilities, of the ''Buran'' programme remain classified. Commenting on the discontinuation of the programme in his interview to ''[[New Scientist]]'', Russian [[cosmonaut]] [[Oleg Kotov]] confirms their accounts:\n\n{{Quotation|We had no civilian tasks for ''Buran'' and the military ones were no longer needed. It was originally designed as a military system for weapon delivery, maybe even nuclear weapons.

Of these, only the [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] and [[X-37]] [[spaceflight]]s were [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|uncrewed]].]]\n\n=== Background ===\nThe Soviet reusable space-craft programme has its roots in the very beginning of the space age, the late 1950s. The idea of Soviet reusable space flight is very old, though it was neither continuous, nor consistently organized. Before Buran, no project of the programme reached production.\n\nThe idea saw its first iteration in the [[Burya]] high-altitude jet aircraft, which reached the prototype stage. Several test flights are known, before it was cancelled by order of the [[Central Committee]]. The [[Burya]] had the goal of delivering a nuclear payload, presumably to the United States, and then returning to base. The cancellation was based on a final decision to develop [[ICBM]]s. The next iteration of the idea was [[Zvezda (spacecraft)|Zvezda]] from the early 1960s, which also reached a prototype stage. Decades later, [[Zvezda (ISS module)|another project with the same name]] was used as a service module for the [[International Space Station]]. After Zvezda, there was a hiatus in reusable projects until Buran.\n\n=== Programme development ===\nThe development of the Buran began in the early 1970s as a response to the U.S. Space Shuttle program. Soviet officials were concerned about a perceived military threat posed by the U.S. Space Shuttle. In their opinion, the Shuttle's 30-ton payload-to-orbit capacity and, more significantly, its 15-ton payload return capacity, were a clear indication that one of its main objectives would be to place massive experimental laser weapons into orbit that could destroy enemy missiles from a distance of several thousands of kilometers. Their reasoning was that such weapons could only be effectively tested in actual space conditions and that to cut their development time and save costs it would be necessary to regularly bring them back to Earth for modifications and fine-tuning.{{sfn|Hendrickx|Vis|2007}} Soviet officials were also concerned that the U.S. Space Shuttle could make a sudden dive into the atmosphere to drop bombs on Moscow.<ref name=\"BBC Buran\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7738489.stm |title=Buran \u2013 the Soviet 'space shuttle' |work=BBC News |first=Anatoly |last=Zak |date=20 November 2008 |accessdate=7 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nSoviet [[engineers]] were initially reluctant to design a spacecraft that looked superficially identical to the Shuttle, but subsequent [[wind tunnel]] testing showed that NASA's design was already ideal.<ref>{{cite book |title=Spaceflight: The Complete Story From Sputnik to Shuttle\u2014and Beyond |publisher=DK Publishers |first=Giles |last=Sparrow |year=2009 |page=215 |isbn=9780756656416}}</ref> Even though the Molniya Scientific Production Association proposed its [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-105|Spiral]] programme design (halted 13 years earlier), it was rejected as being altogether dissimilar from the American shuttle design.  While [[NPO Molniya]] conducted development under the lead of [[Gleb Lozino-Lozinskiy]], the Soviet Union's Military-Industrial Commission, or VPK, was tasked with collecting all data it could on the U.S. Space Shuttle. Under the auspices of the KGB, the VPK was able to amass documentation on the American shuttle's airframe designs, design analysis software, materials, flight computer systems and propulsion systems.  The KGB targeted many university research project documents and databases, including Caltech, MIT, Princeton, Stanford and others. The thoroughness of the acquisition of data was made much easier as the U.S. shuttle development was unclassified.<ref name=\"NBC News\">{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18686090/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/how-soviets-stole-space-shuttle/ |title=How the Soviets stole a space shuttle |work=NBC News |last=Windrem |first=Robert |date=4 November 1997}}</ref>\n\nThe construction of the shuttles began in 1980, and by 1984 the first full-scale Buran was rolled out. The first [[sub-orbital flight|suborbital]] test flight of a scale-model ([[BOR-5]]) took place as early as July 1983. As the project progressed, five additional scale-model flights were performed.  A test vehicle was constructed with four jet engines mounted at the rear; this vehicle is usually referred to as [[OK-GLI]], or as the \"Buran aerodynamic analogue\". The jets were used to take off from a normal landing strip, and once it reached a designated point, the engines were cut and OK-GLI glided back to land. This provided invaluable information about the handling characteristics of the Buran design, and significantly differed from the carrier plane/air drop method used by the United States and the {{OV|101|full=no}} test craft. Twenty-four test flights of OK-GLI were performed by the [[Gromov Flight Research Institute]] [[test pilot]]s and researchers after which the shuttle was \"worn out\". The developers considered using a couple of [[Mil Mi-26]] [[helicopter]]s to \"bundle\" lift the Buran, but test flights with a [[mock-up]] showed how risky and impractical that was.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buran-energia.com/documentation/documentation-akc-air-transportation.php |title=BURAN Orbital Spaceship Airframe Creation |work=Buran-Energia.com |first=V.

In 1983 the Buran developers estimated that the software development would require several thousand programmers if done with their existing methodology (in assembly language), and they appealed to [[Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics]] for assistance. It was decided to develop a new high-level \"problem-oriented\" programming language.

In 1982, it was decided that all Buran commanders and their back-ups would occupy the third seat on a Soyuz mission, prior to their Buran spaceflight. Several people had been selected to potentially be in the first Buran crew. By 1985, it was decided that at least one of the two crew members would be a [[test pilot]] trained at the [[Gromov Flight Research Institute]] (known as \"LII\"), and potential crew lists were drawn up. Only two potential Buran crew members reached space: [[Igor Volk]], who flew in [[Soyuz T-12]] to the space station [[Salyut 7]], and [[Anatoli Levchenko]] who visited [[Mir]], launching with [[Soyuz TM-4]] and landing with [[Soyuz TM-3]]. Both of these spaceflights lasted about a week.{{sfn|Hendrickx|Vis|2007}}\n\nLevchenko died of a brain tumour the year after his orbital flight, Bachurin left the cosmonaut corps because of medical reasons, Shchukin was assigned to the back-up crew of Soyuz TM-4 and later died in a plane crash, Stankevi\u010dius was also killed in a plane crash, while Borodai and Zabolotsky remained unassigned to a Soyuz flight until the Buran programme ended.\n\n==== Spaceflight of I. P. Volk ====\n{{main|Soyuz T-12}}\n[[Igor Volk]] was planned to be the commander of the first crewed Buran flight. There were two purposes of the Soyuz T-12 mission, one of which was to give Volk spaceflight experience. The other purpose, seen as the more important factor, was to beat the United States and have the first [[Extra-vehicular activity|spacewalk]] by a woman.{{sfn|Hendrickx|Vis|2007}} At the time of the Soyuz T-12 mission the Buran programme was still a [[Classified information|state secret]].

Like the assembly and processing hall at Site 112, the launch complex was originally constructed for the [[Soviet manned lunar programs|Soviet lunar landing programme]] and later converted for the Energia-Buran programme.\n* Site 112 \u2013 Used for orbiter maintenance and to mate the orbiters to their [[Energia]] launchers (thus fulfilling a role similar to the [[Vehicle Assembly Building|VAB]] at [[Kennedy Space Center|KSC]]). The main hangar at the site, called ''MIK RN'' or ''MIK 112'', was originally built for the assembly of the [[N1 (rocket)|N1 moon rocket]]. After cancellation of the N-1 programme in 1974, the facilities at Site 112 were converted for the Energia-Buran programme. It was here that [[1.01 (Buran-class spacecraft)|Orbiter K1]] was stored after the end of the Buran programme and was destroyed when the hangar roof collapsed in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/baikonur_energia_112.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2 August 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706112853/http://www.russianspaceweb.com/baikonur_energia_112.html |archivedate=6 July 2015  }}</ref><ref>http://www.buran-energia.com/bourane-buran/bourane-fin.php</ref>\n* Site 251 \u2013 Used as Buran orbiter landing facility, also known as ''Yubileyniy Airfield'' (and fulfilling a role similar to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility|SLF]] at [[Kennedy Space Center|KSC]]). It features one runway, called 06/24, which is {{convert|4500|m|yd}} long and {{convert|84|m|yd}} wide, paved with \"Grade 600\" high quality reinforced concrete. At the edge of the runway was a special [[Mate-Demate Device|mating-demating device]], designed to lift an orbiter off its [[Antonov An-225 Mriya]] carrier aircraft and load it on a transporter, which would carry the orbiter to the processing building at Site 254. A purpose-built orbiter landing control facility, housed in a large multi-storey office building, was located near the runway. ''Yubileyniy Airfield'' was also used to receive heavy transport planes carrying elements of the Energia-Buran system. After the end of the Buran programme, Site 251 was abandoned but later reopened as a commercial cargo airport.

Despite remarkable external similarities, many key differences existed, which suggests that, had espionage been a factor in Buran's development, it would likely have been in the form of external photography or early airframe designs. One CIA commenter states that Buran was based on a rejected NASA design.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/96unclass/farewell.htm |title=The Farewell Dossier: Duping the Soviets \u2013 A Deception Operation |journal=Studies in Intelligence |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |first=Gus W. |last=Weiss |volume=39 |issue=5 |year=1996 |accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref> See the {{section link||Programme development}} section above.\n\n==== Key differences between Buran and NASA's Space Shuttle ====\n* Buran had no main engines; take off and ascent trajectory were accomplished with the Energia rocket whose four main engines were expendable. The three [[Space Shuttle main engine]]s were part of the orbiter, and were reused for multiple flights.\n* The core Energia rocket was equipped with its own [[guidance, navigation, and control]] system \u2013 unlike Space Shuttle whose entire control system was in the orbiter.\n* Unlike Space Shuttle's boosters, each of Energia's four boosters had their own guidance, navigation, and control system, which allowed them to be used as launch vehicles on their own to deliver smaller payloads than those requiring the complete Energia-Buran system.\n* Energia could be configured with four, two or no boosters for payloads other than Buran, and in full configuration was able to put up to 100 metric tons into orbit. The [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] was integral to its launch system and was the system's only payload.\n* Energia's four [[Zenit (rocket family)#Energia booster|boosters]] used [[Liquid rocket propellant|liquid propellant]] ([[kerosene]]/[[oxygen]]). The Space Shuttle's two boosters used solid propellant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/returntoflight/system/system_SRB.html |title=Space Shuttle: Solid Rocket Boosters |work=NASA.gov |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref>\n* The liquid fueled booster rockets were not constructed in segments vulnerable to leakage through O-rings, which caused the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|destruction]] of {{OV|099|full=no}}.\n* The Energia rocket was not covered in foam, the shedding of which from the large fuel tank led to the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|destruction]] of {{OV|102|full=no}}.\n* Energia's four boosters were designed to be recovered after each flight, though they were not recovered during Energia's two operational flights. The Space Shuttle's boosters were recovered and reused.\n* Buran's equivalent of the [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System]] used GOX/LOX/Kerosene propellant, with lower toxicity and higher performance (a [[specific impulse]] of {{convert|362|isp}} using a [[turbopump]] system)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buran.ru/htm/odu.htm |title=\u041e\u0431\u044a\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430 (\u041e\u0414\u0423) |trans-title=Joint Propulsion System (JPS) |work=Buran.ru |first=Vadim |last=Lukashevich |accessdate=21 November 2013}}</ref> than the Shuttle's pressure-fed [[monomethylhydrazine]]/[[dinitrogen tetroxide]] OMS engines.\n* Buran was designed to be capable of both [[human spaceflight|piloted]] and fully [[Robotic spacecraft|autonomous]] flight, including landing. The Space Shuttle was later retrofitted with [[Remote Control Orbiter|automated landing capability]], first flown 18 years after the Buran on [[STS-121]], but the system was intended to be used only
