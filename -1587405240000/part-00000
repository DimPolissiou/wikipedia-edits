Over the course of his career he worked for several different automobile brands, and many of his designs went into full production. He is best known for his work at [[Citro\u00ebn]], which he joined in 1962 and where he became ''Responsable de Style'', head of the design department, in 1964.<ref name=\"caspersbook\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nOpron was born in [[Amiens]] in Picardy, France. His father was in the military and received several postings to locations in French Colonial Africa, so Opron grew up in places like Algeria, Mali and Abidjan.<ref name=\"dear-mag\"/>\n\nAt 18 Opron contracted tuberculosis, and had to spend time in a sanatorium.<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/> He returned to France in 1952 and enrolled in the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Amiens; one year later he transferred to the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/> He studied architecture under [[Auguste Perret]].<ref name=\"dear-mag\"/><ref name=\"clubzeitung\"/> Altogether Opron spent eight years studying architecture, painting, and sculpture.<ref name=\"influx\"/>\n\nAt age 21 he married Genevi\u00e8ve Mercier.<ref name=\"dear-mag\"/> In the early 1950s Opron's interest in aircraft led him to take up flying, including acrobatic flying.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/>\n\nIn 1952 Opron began his professional career as a machine designer for the Compagnie Nationale des Sucreries in Ham in the Somme.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/> In 1954 he was hired by aircraft builder Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Constructions A\u00e9ronautices du Nord.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/> He specialised in cockpit design, and worked on the [[Nord Noratlas]] aircraft.\n\nOpron began working at Simca in 1958 at age 26.<ref name=\"gazoline-book\"/> His department was eliminated in 1961, and Opron received a two-year severance payout, but with a non-compete clause that prevented him from moving to another automaker.<ref name=\"icon-mag\"/> Instead Opron went to ''Arthur Martin'', a company that produced housewares and home appliances, where he became ''Director of Style''.<ref name=\"petrolicious\"/><ref name=\"drive-my\"/><ref name=\"lavoz\"/> Opron returned to automotive design with Citro\u00ebn in 1962. \n\nOver the course of his career Opron became known for balancing a collaborative, team-based approach to design with creative input from individuals.<ref name=\"lawsonbook\"/> He finally retired from design work in 2001.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/><ref name=\"icon-mag\"/>\n\n==Awards and recognition==\nOpron was one of twenty-five designers nominated for the 1999 [[Car Designer of the Century]] competition.\n\nA celebration of his work, ''OPRON 50 Years of Style'', was held on 11 May 2002 in Verri\u00e8res-le-Buisson on the occasion of his 70th birthday.<ref name=\"gs-gsa-50ans\"/><ref name=\"petrolicious\"/>\n\nOpron received Car Design News\u2019 Lifetime Achievement Award in 2016.<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/>\n\nThe Carlisle Import & Performance Nationals of 15\u201317 May 2020 is to include a featured display titled: \u201cCars of Robert Opron\u201d.<ref name=\"carlisle1\"/>\n\n==Design history==\n{{quote|text=The dolphin, the leopard, the swift, they each move at a speed consistent with their environment, each using a minimum of energy. What a great lesson for a stylist.|sign=Robert Opron|source=<ref name=\"pijlmanbook-ch6\"/>}}\n\n{{quote|text=All Opron\u2019s car designs have an organic wholeness as if they have been grown or shaped by the forces of wind, light, scale and structure.

The magazine supplied a list of anticipated standard features that included radar obstacle detection and gyroscopic stabilisation. Opron consulted with an astrophysicist friend to help integrate these not-yet realised concepts into the car.<ref name=\"drive-my\"/>\n\nWhile at Simca he sketched out a [[Car body configurations#Two-box design|two-box]] hatchback that caught the attention of Fiat's designers. This sketch eventually led to the [[Simca 1100]].<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/><ref name=\"absolutely-bio\"/><ref name=\"dear-mag\"/><ref name=\"curbside-sins1\"/>\n\nAnother sketch by Opron at Simca has been suggested to have been the original concept for what later became the Renault Espace.<ref name=\"dear-mag\"/> Others dispute this claim, and the design of the Espace is generally credited to [[Fergus Pollock]].<ref name=\"dtw-opron\"/> In the late 1970s Matra designer Antoine Volanis addressed the need for a replacement for the [[Matra Rancho]] by designing an [[Minivan|MPV]] using Simca parts and with input from Opron.<ref name=\"amk-p16\"/> This design was presented to PSA management in 1979 as \"Project P16\", but did not reach production. Opron was at Renault throughout most of the Espace's development and for one year after sales started.\n\n===Citro\u00ebn===\nIn 1962 Mme. Opron-Mercier noticed an advertisement in [[Le Monde]] saying that an \"Important industrial group\" was looking to hire an experienced designer.<ref name=\"pijlmanbook-ch6\"/> Opron responded to the ad, and was directed to report to the Quai de Javel, the home of Citro\u00ebn. The personnel manager asked Opron to return later that day to the Bureau d'\u00c9tudes on the Rue du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre to meet with [[Flaminio Bertoni]], Citro\u00ebn's chief designer and originator of the [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV|2CV]] and [[Citro\u00ebn DS|DS]].\n\nWhen Opron arrived for the meeting with Bertoni, the older man asked to see Opron's portfolio of drawings. Opron recalled that Bertoni \"threw them on the floor, poking them with his cane and stated that he did not think much of them.\"<ref name=\"pijlmanbook-ch6\"/> Opron collected his drawings and indicated that he found Bertoni's behavior unacceptable, to which Bertoni replied \"I do find you interesting though!\". Opron left, vowing to never work for such a man. Three weeks later, he received a letter of appointment from Citro\u00ebn.<ref name=\"gazoline-book\"/> \n\nOpron joined Citro\u00ebn\u2019s Bureau d\u2019\u00c9tudes in 1962. For the first three months he worked in the \"M\u00e9thodes\" section.<ref name=\"pijlmanbook-ch6\"/>\n\nOpron became Citro\u00ebn's Responable de Style, or chief stylist, in 1964 following the death of Bertoni.<ref name=\"petrolicious\"/>\n\nOpron was tasked with developing a replacement for the 2CV, which evolved into the 1965 [[Citro\u00ebn G-Mini]] design study.<ref name=\"cn-gmini\"/>\n\nIn 1965 Citro\u00ebn launched new lines of {{convert|3.5|\u2013|8.0|t|ST|0|abbr=on}} trucks; the 350 and 600 series that earned the nickname [[Citro\u00ebn Belph\u00e9gor|Belph\u00e9gor]] for their unique cab design. The trucks were designed by Bertoni and Opron.<ref name=\"cn-belphegor\"/><ref name=\"cj-aug2017\"/><ref name=\"pijlmanbook-ch6\"/>{{rp|176, 189}}\n\nOpron began working on the second restyling of the Citro\u00ebn DS as early as 1963 with ''Projet D29''. His \"Nouveau Visage\" (new face) front appearing on the 1968 model year DS was a four-headlamp design with two lamps on each side under glass covers that blended with the body's lines. The inner headlamp on each side pivoted with the steering wheel, while the outer lamps were self-leveling.\n\nIn 1967, having abandoned the ambitious ''Projet F'' begun by Bertoni and taken over by Opron, Citro\u00ebn initiated a competition for a new mid-range model that pitted Opron and the Bureau d'\u00c9tudes against [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and [[Italdesign Giugiaro|Italdesign]].<ref name=\"absolutely-bio\"/> Both teams submitted designs for front wheel drive 3- and 5-door cars powered by flat-four engines. Opron's proposal carried the day, and his ''Project G'' eventually became the [[Citro\u00ebn GS|GS]] released in 1970.<ref name=\"ean-designers\"/><ref name=\"lignes-10898\"/> Some have claimed that Opron based the GS' shape on the Pininfarina Austin 1800 Aerodinamica Berline of 1967.<ref name=\"cb-bmc1800\"/> Others assert that, while it may have been influenced by the Italo-English concept car, Opron's design was an independent work, and point out that Citro\u00ebn has never acknowledged any link.<ref name=\"colebook\"/>{{rp|322\u2013324}}<ref name=\"cv-bmc-cx\"/><ref name=\"landcrab-pinin\"/> Giugiaro's rejected design was taken up by Alfa Romeo and developed into the [[Alfasud]].<ref name=\"absolutely-bio\"/>\n\nIn 1968 Citro\u00ebn opened a new Centre d'\u00c9tudes at [[V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay|V\u00e9lizy]], France. Opron oversaw the arrangements for the move, which was completed progressively over several years.<ref name=\"pijlmanbook-ch6\"/>\n\nOpron refreshed the [[Citro\u00ebn Ami|Ami 6]] to create the Ami 8 of 1969.<ref name=\"om-ami8\"/><ref name=\"cn-projectm\"/> He also led the team that developed the [[Citro\u00ebn M35]], a two-door fastback based on the Ami 8 chassis that was powered by a single rotor [[Comotor]] engine.<ref name=\"colebook\"/> Production ran from 1969\u20131971, and although 500 M35s were planned to be built, the total number is believed to be just more than half that.\n\nThe first completely new model of the Opron era, and the car he is most closely associated with, was the [[Citro\u00ebn SM|SM]]. Assigned the development name ''Projet S'', the original goal was to produce a racing car suitable for Le Mans. Through the influence of Opron and [[Pierre Bercot]], Citro\u00ebn's managing director, it evolved from a racing car into a premium model in the old Grand Routier tradition.<ref name=\"hagerty-sm\"/>\n\nThe SM team, which included Jean Giert, built a full-scale model in the Bureau d'\u00c9tudes workshops on the Rue du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, making the SM the last model developed in this location before the last of the style department moved to their new location in V\u00e9lizy.<ref name=\"dsa-smretro\"/>\n\nA design for a possible GS-based coup\u00e9 progressed to the full-scale model stage.<ref name=\"lignes-10898\"/> The car was to be built by [[Ligier]] when their contract to assemble the SM expired in 1974\u201375 but did not go into production.\n\nThe project that was Opron's personal favorite was also his last design for Citro\u00ebn.<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/><ref name=\"cn-projetl\"/> Initially called ''Projet L'', the result was the [[Citro\u00ebn CX|CX]], which debuted in 1974 as the successor to the DS.\n\nWhen Citro\u00ebn declared bankruptcy in 1974, the French Government stepped in and arranged a merger of Citro\u00ebn with [[Peugeot]]. Opron left shortly after this.<ref name=\"petrolicious\"/>\n\n===Renault===\nIn 1975 Opron started work at Renault after reportedly being the target of an [[executive search]] by them.<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/> For his new employers he led the redesign of the [[Alpine A310]], a project that stylist [[Peter Stevens (car designer)|Peter Stevens]] was also involved in.<ref name=\"bat-alpine\"/> The original 4-cylinder A310 was modified to accommodate the [[V6 PRV engine]], and to address some aerodynamic deficiencies of the original shape.\n\nOpron developed a design for an ultra-compact city car called the V\u00e9hicule Bas de Gamme (VBG), or Entry Level Vehicle.<ref name=\"lignes-7691\"/> He was also involved in the Vesta II concept car of 1987, along with designer [[Gaston Juchet]].<ref name=\"jpb-juchet\"/>\n\nOpron's designs at Renault included the [[Renault Fuego]] sports coup\u00e9 of 1980, as well as the [[Renault 9 and 11]], with the 9 sedan released in 1981 and the 11 hatchback in 1983.<ref name=\"hemmings-fuego\"/><ref name=\"bonhams\"/> Opron worked with [[American Motors|AMC]]'s [[Dick Teague]] to adapt the 9 and 11 models to the American market, where they were sold as the Alliance and Encore respectively.<ref name=\"om-amc-renault\"/>\n\nOpron's tenure at Renault was marked by extensive collaborations with other well-known designers and carrosserie.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/><ref name=\"rc-juchet\"/> [[Marcello Gandini]] influenced the shape of the [[Renault 25|25]] of 1983, and produced the shape for the Super Cinq in 1984.<ref name=\"leroux-ggbio\"/> <ref name=\"lignes-14522\"/> An association with Giugiaro and Italdesign resulted in the Renault Gabbiano of 1983, and later the [[Renault 21]] of 1986 and [[Renault 19]] of 1988.<ref name=\"leroux-ggbio\"/> \n\nIn May 1977 Opron sent a letter to director Fran\u00e7ois Zanotti, director of Renault\u2019s commercial division, with a proposal for a new line of commercial trucks, and included two sketches by designer Guy Greffier. Zanotti approved further development, and Greffier refined his original sketches. As the project progressed, Opron invited Gandini to join the design effort. The end result was the Renault AE Magnum truck line released in 1990, when it also won \"European Truck of the Year\".<ref name=\"lam-win2019\"/>\n\nOpron wanted to establish a centre of advanced styling in the United States.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/><ref name=\"lam-spr2018\"/> He spent time in the States working to that end, but it did not materialise. When he returned to Europe he arrived to changes in the leadership of Renault.\n\nOpron left Renault in 1985.\n\n===Fiat===\nAfter Renault Opron moved to Centro Stile at [[Fiat]], where he was put in charge of advanced studies.\n\nHe is credited with creating the earliest sketches for a design project called the ES 30, for ''Experimental Sportscar 3.0 litres''. Opron's early concept, which won out against a competing proposal from Giugiaro, was fully developed by [[Antonio Castellana]].<ref name=\"petrol-sz\"/><ref name=\"dkbook\"/><ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/> The prototype was completed in just nineteen months \u2014 quickly enough to appear at the 1989 [[Geneva Motor Show]]. This highly controversial design went into limited production as the [[Alfa Romeo SZ]] coup\u00e9 and the later RZ convertible, where the \"Z\" refers to coachbuilder [[Zagato]]. The model was also given the nickname \"Il Mostro\" (the monster) for its unusual appearance.\n\nIn 1992 Opron left Fiat at sixty years of age, having reached mandatory retirement age.<ref name=\"drive-my\"/>\n\n===Independent consultant===\nFrom 1991 to 2000 he operated his own independent design consultancy in [[Verri\u00e8res-le-Buisson]] in south Paris ([[Essonne]]).\n\nOne of Opron's clients was Ligier, who had become a manufacturer of \"voitures sans permis\" or \"voiturettes\", a class of microcar in France that may be driven without an operator's license. For Ligier Opron produced the original Du\u00e9, which debuted at the 1998 [[Paris Motor Show]].<ref name=\"cf-due\"/><ref name=\"dkbook\"/> The Ligier Dragonfly shown at the 2000 [[Geneva Motor Show]] was also an Opron design.<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/>\n\nOpron also consulted for [[Piaggio]].<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/>\n\n==Design gallery==\n{{gallery\n|File:Simca Fulgur 1958 (3593990695).jpg|[[Simca#Fulgur|Simca Fulgur]] (1958)\n|File:Citroen DS 23 Pallas.jpg| Citro\u00ebn DS (1967) \"Nouveau Visage\"\n|File:Citroen Ami 8 February 1973 mfd 1972 602cc.jpg| Citro\u00ebn Ami 8 (1969)\n|File:Citroen SM (14521154082).jpg| [[Citro\u00ebn SM]] (1970) 1972 [[Motor Trend Car of the Year]].\n|File:50 ans de la GS.jpg| Citro\u00ebn GS<ref name=\"independent-gs\"/> (1970) 1971 [[European Car of the Year]].\n|File:Citroen CX Sum08.jpg| Citro\u00ebn CX<ref name=\"cpc-show\"/> (1974) 1975 European Car of the Year.\n|File:1980 Renault Alpine A310 V6 - 14404217287.jpg| [[Renault Alpine A310]] V6 (1976)\n|File:Renault Fuego France.jpg | [[Renault Fuego]] (1980)\n|File:Renault 9 Cambridge.jpg|[[Renault 9]]<ref name=\"rfo-opron\"/> (1981) 1982 European Car of the Year.\n|File:Renault 11 (46325126544).jpg| [[Renault 11]]<ref name=\"9et11-hist\"/> (1983)\n|File:Renault25.jpg| [[Renault 25]]<ref name=\"cpc-r25\"/> (1984)\n|File:1990 Alfa Romeo SZ 3.0 Front.jpg| [[Alfa Romeo SZ]]<ref name=\"rt-oct2017\"/> (1989)\n|}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"caspersbook\">{{cite book |last=Caspers |first=Markus |date=26 September 2016 |title=Designing Motion: Automotive Designers 1890 to 1990 |url= |location= |publisher=Birkh\u00e4user |isbn=978-3035609820 |page=149<!--|page=127 --> |author-link=}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dear-mag\">{{cite web |last=Maak |first=Niklas |url=https://www.dear-magazin.de/stories/Autopilot-49_-Vive-la-Berline_17515119.html |title=Autopilot #49: Vive la Berline |website=www.dear-magazin.de }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\">{{cite magazine |last=Guenzel |first=Peter |date=28 October 2017 |title=Robert Opron |url=https://www.pressreader.com/france/octane-france/20171028/283021169927764 |magazine=Octane |location= |publisher= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"leroux-bio\">{{cite web |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |url=http://leroux.andre.free.fr/carrossieropron.htm |title=Robert Opron |website=leroux.andre.free.fr }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"clubzeitung\">{{cite magazine |last=B\u00f6ttcher |first=Gerrit |title=Robert Opron \u2014 zum Anlass seines 75 zigsten Geburtstages |trans-title=Robert Opron \u2014 on the occasion of his 75th birthday |url=https://www.citroensmclub.de/files/SM_Clubzeitung_Nr_76.pdf |magazine=Citro\u00ebn-Clubzeitung |location= |publisher=Citro\u00ebn-SM-Club Deutschland e.

Over the course of his career he worked for several different automobile brands, and many of his designs went into full production. He is best known for his work at [[Citro\u00ebn]], which he joined in 1962 and where he became ''Responsable de Style'', head of the design department, in 1964.<ref name=\"caspersbook\"/>\n\n==Biography==\nOpron was born in [[Amiens]] in Picardy, France. His father was in the military and received several postings to locations in French Colonial Africa, so Opron grew up in places like Algeria, Mali and Abidjan.<ref name=\"dear-mag\"/>\n\nAt 18 Opron contracted tuberculosis, and had to spend time in a sanatorium.<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/> He returned to France in 1952 and enrolled in the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Amiens; one year later he transferred to the [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/> He studied architecture under [[Auguste Perret]].<ref name=\"dear-mag\"/><ref name=\"clubzeitung\"/> Altogether Opron spent eight years studying architecture, painting, and sculpture.<ref name=\"influx\"/>\n\nAt age 21 he married Genevi\u00e8ve Mercier.<ref name=\"dear-mag\"/> In the early 1950s Opron's interest in aircraft led him to take up flying, including acrobatic flying.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/>\n\nIn 1952 Opron began his professional career as a machine designer for the Compagnie Nationale des Sucreries in Ham in the Somme.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/> In 1954 he was hired by aircraft builder Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Constructions A\u00e9ronautices du Nord.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/> He specialised in cockpit design, and worked on the [[Nord Noratlas]] aircraft.\n\nOpron began working at Simca in 1958 at age 26.<ref name=\"gazoline-book\"/> His department was eliminated in 1961, and Opron received a two-year severance payout, but with a non-compete clause that prevented him from moving to another automaker.<ref name=\"icon-mag\"/> Instead Opron went to ''Arthur Martin'', a company that produced housewares and home appliances, where he became ''Director of Style''.<ref name=\"petrolicious\"/><ref name=\"drive-my\"/><ref name=\"lavoz\"/> Opron returned to automotive design with Citro\u00ebn in 1962. \n\nOver the course of his career Opron became known for balancing a collaborative, team-based approach to design with creative input from individuals.<ref name=\"lawsonbook\"/> He finally retired from design work in 2001.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/><ref name=\"icon-mag\"/>\n\n==Awards and recognition==\nOpron was one of twenty-five designers nominated for the 1999 [[Car Designer of the Century]] competition.\n\nA celebration of his work, ''OPRON 50 Years of Style'', was held on 11 May 2002 in Verri\u00e8res-le-Buisson on the occasion of his 70th birthday.<ref name=\"gs-gsa-50ans\"/><ref name=\"petrolicious\"/>\n\nOpron received Car Design News\u2019 Lifetime Achievement Award in 2016.<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/>\n\nThe Carlisle Import & Performance Nationals of 15\u201317 May 2020 is to include a featured display titled: \u201cCars of Robert Opron\u201d.<ref name=\"carlisle1\"/>\n\n==Design history==\n{{quote|text=The dolphin, the leopard, the swift, they each move at a speed consistent with their environment, each using a minimum of energy.

The magazine supplied a list of anticipated standard features that included radar obstacle detection and gyroscopic stabilisation. Opron consulted with an astrophysicist friend to help integrate these not-yet realised concepts into the car.<ref name=\"drive-my\"/>\n\nWhile at Simca he sketched out a [[Car body configurations#Two-box design|two-box]] hatchback that caught the attention of Fiat's designers. This sketch eventually led to the [[Simca 1100]].<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/><ref name=\"absolutely-bio\"/><ref name=\"dear-mag\"/><ref name=\"curbside-sins1\"/>\n\nAnother sketch by Opron at Simca has been suggested to have been the original concept for what later became the Renault Espace.<ref name=\"dear-mag\"/> Others dispute this claim, and the design of the Espace is generally credited to [[Fergus Pollock]].<ref name=\"dtw-opron\"/> In the late 1970s Matra designer Antoine Volanis addressed the need for a replacement for the [[Matra Rancho]] by designing an [[Minivan|MPV]] using Simca parts and with input from Opron.<ref name=\"amk-p16\"/> This design was presented to PSA management in 1979 as \"Project P16\", but did not reach production. Opron was at Renault throughout most of the Espace's development and for one year after sales started.\n\n===Citro\u00ebn===\nIn 1962 Mme. Opron-Mercier noticed an advertisement in [[Le Monde]] saying that an \"Important industrial group\" was looking to hire an experienced designer.<ref name=\"pijlmanbook-ch6\"/> Opron responded to the ad, and was directed to report to the Quai de Javel, the home of Citro\u00ebn. The personnel manager asked Opron to return later that day to the Bureau d'\u00c9tudes on the Rue du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre to meet with [[Flaminio Bertoni]], Citro\u00ebn's chief designer and originator of the [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV|2CV]] and [[Citro\u00ebn DS|DS]].\n\nWhen Opron arrived for the meeting with Bertoni, the older man asked to see Opron's portfolio of drawings. Opron recalled that Bertoni \"threw them on the floor, poking them with his cane and stated that he did not think much of them.\"<ref name=\"pijlmanbook-ch6\"/> Opron collected his drawings and indicated that he found Bertoni's behavior unacceptable, to which Bertoni replied \"I do find you interesting though!\". Opron left, vowing to never work for such a man. Three weeks later, he received a letter of appointment from Citro\u00ebn.<ref name=\"gazoline-book\"/> \n\nOpron joined Citro\u00ebn\u2019s Bureau d\u2019\u00c9tudes in 1962. For the first three months he worked in the \"M\u00e9thodes\" section.<ref name=\"pijlmanbook-ch6\"/>\n\nOpron became Citro\u00ebn's Responable de Style, or chief stylist, in 1964 following the death of Bertoni.<ref name=\"petrolicious\"/>\n\nOpron was tasked with developing a replacement for the 2CV, which evolved into the 1965 [[Citro\u00ebn G-Mini]] design study.<ref name=\"cn-gmini\"/>\n\nIn 1965 Citro\u00ebn launched new lines of {{convert|3.5|\u2013|8.0|t|ST|0|abbr=on}} trucks; the 350 and 600 series that earned the nickname [[Citro\u00ebn Belph\u00e9gor|Belph\u00e9gor]] for their unique cab design. The trucks were designed by Bertoni and Opron.<ref name=\"cn-belphegor\"/><ref name=\"cj-aug2017\"/><ref name=\"pijlmanbook-ch6\"/>{{rp|176, 189}}\n\nOpron began working on the second restyling of the Citro\u00ebn DS as early as 1963 with ''Projet D29''. His \"Nouveau Visage\" (new face) front appearing on the 1968 model year DS was a four-headlamp design with two lamps on each side under glass covers that blended with the body's lines. The inner headlamp on each side pivoted with the steering wheel, while the outer lamps were self-leveling.\n\nIn 1967, having abandoned the ambitious ''Projet F'' begun by Bertoni and taken over by Opron, Citro\u00ebn initiated a competition for a new mid-range model that pitted Opron and the Bureau d'\u00c9tudes against [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and [[Italdesign Giugiaro|Italdesign]].<ref name=\"absolutely-bio\"/> Both teams submitted designs for front wheel drive 3- and 5-door cars powered by flat-four engines. Opron's proposal carried the day, and his ''Project G'' eventually became the [[Citro\u00ebn GS|GS]] released in 1970.<ref name=\"ean-designers\"/><ref name=\"lignes-10898\"/> Some have claimed that Opron based the GS' shape on the Pininfarina Austin 1800 Aerodinamica Berline of 1967.<ref name=\"cb-bmc1800\"/> Others assert that, while it may have been influenced by the Italo-English concept car, Opron's design was an independent work, and point out that Citro\u00ebn has never acknowledged any link.<ref name=\"colebook\"/>{{rp|322\u2013324}}<ref name=\"cv-bmc-cx\"/><ref name=\"landcrab-pinin\"/> Giugiaro's rejected design was taken up by Alfa Romeo and developed into the [[Alfasud]].<ref name=\"absolutely-bio\"/>\n\nIn 1968 Citro\u00ebn opened a new Centre d'\u00c9tudes at [[V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay|V\u00e9lizy]], France. Opron oversaw the arrangements for the move, which was completed progressively over several years.<ref name=\"pijlmanbook-ch6\"/>\n\nOpron refreshed the [[Citro\u00ebn Ami|Ami 6]] to create the Ami 8 of 1969.<ref name=\"om-ami8\"/><ref name=\"cn-projectm\"/> He also led the team that developed the [[Citro\u00ebn M35]], a two-door fastback based on the Ami 8 chassis that was powered by a single rotor [[Comotor]] engine.<ref name=\"colebook\"/> Production ran from 1969\u20131971, and although 500 M35s were planned to be built, the total number is believed to be just more than half that.\n\nThe first completely new model of the Opron era, and the car he is most closely associated with, was the [[Citro\u00ebn SM|SM]]. Assigned the development name ''Projet S'', the original goal was to produce a racing car suitable for Le Mans. Through the influence of Opron and [[Pierre Bercot]], Citro\u00ebn's managing director, it evolved from a racing car into a premium model in the old Grand Routier tradition.<ref name=\"hagerty-sm\"/>\n\nThe SM team, which included Jean Giert, built a full-scale model in the Bureau d'\u00c9tudes workshops on the Rue du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, making the SM the last model developed in this location before the last of the style department moved to their new location in V\u00e9lizy.<ref name=\"dsa-smretro\"/>\n\nA design for a possible GS-based coup\u00e9 progressed to the full-scale model stage.<ref name=\"lignes-10898\"/> The car was to be built by [[Ligier]] when their contract to assemble the SM expired in 1974\u201375 but did not go into production.\n\nThe project that was Opron's personal favorite was also his last design for Citro\u00ebn.<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/><ref name=\"cn-projetl\"/> Initially called ''Projet L'', the result was the [[Citro\u00ebn CX|CX]], which debuted in 1974 as the successor to the DS.\n\nWhen Citro\u00ebn declared bankruptcy in 1974, the French Government stepped in and arranged a merger of Citro\u00ebn with [[Peugeot]]. Opron left shortly after this.<ref name=\"petrolicious\"/>\n\n===Renault===\nIn 1975 Opron started work at Renault after reportedly being the target of an [[executive search]] by them.<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/> For his new employers he led the redesign of the [[Alpine A310]], a project that stylist [[Peter Stevens]] was also involved in.<ref name=\"bat-alpine\"/> The original 4-cylinder A310 was modified to accommodate the [[V6 PRV engine]], and to address some aerodynamic deficiencies of the original shape.\n\nOpron developed a design for an ultra-compact city car called the V\u00e9hicule Bas de Gamme (VBG), or Entry Level Vehicle.<ref name=\"lignes-7691\"/> He was also involved in the Vesta II concept car of 1987, along with designer [[Gaston Juchet]].<ref name=\"jpb-juchet\"/>\n\nOpron's designs at Renault included the [[Renault Fuego]] sports coup\u00e9 of 1980, as well as the [[Renault 9 and 11]], with the 9 sedan released in 1981 and the 11 hatchback in 1983.<ref name=\"hemmings-fuego\"/><ref name=\"bonhams\"/> Opron worked with [[American Motors|AMC]]'s [[Dick Teague]] to adapt the 9 and 11 models to the American market, where they were sold as the Alliance and Encore respectively.<ref name=\"om-amc-renault\"/>\n\nOpron's tenure at Renault was marked by extensive collaborations with other well-known designers and carrosserie.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/><ref name=\"rc-juchet\"/> [[Marcello Gandini]] influenced the shape of the [[Renault 25|25]] of 1983, and produced the shape for the Super Cinq in 1984.<ref name=\"leroux-ggbio\"/> <ref name=\"lignes-14522\"/> An association with Giugiaro and Italdesign resulted in the Renault Gabbiano of 1983, and later the [[Renault 21]] of 1986 and [[Renault 19]] of 1988.<ref name=\"leroux-ggbio\"/> \n\nIn May 1977 Opron sent a letter to director Fran\u00e7ois Zanotti, director of Renault\u2019s commercial division, with a proposal for a new line of commercial trucks, and included two sketches by designer Guy Greffier. Zanotti approved further development, and Greffier refined his original sketches. As the project progressed, Opron invited Gandini to join the design effort. The end result was the Renault AE Magnum truck line released in 1990, when it also won \"European Truck of the Year\".<ref name=\"lam-win2019\"/>\n\nOpron wanted to establish a centre of advanced styling in the United States.<ref name=\"leroux-bio\"/><ref name=\"lam-spr2018\"/> He spent time in the States working to that end, but it did not materialise. When he returned to Europe he arrived to changes in the leadership of Renault.\n\nOpron left Renault in 1985.\n\n===Fiat===\nAfter Renault Opron moved to Centro Stile at [[Fiat]], where he was put in charge of advanced studies.\n\nHe is credited with creating the earliest sketches for a design project called the ES 30, for ''Experimental Sportscar 3.0 litres''. Opron's early concept, which won out against a competing proposal from Giugiaro, was fully developed by [[Antonio Castellana]].<ref name=\"petrol-sz\"/><ref name=\"dkbook\"/><ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/> The prototype was completed in just nineteen months \u2014 quickly enough to appear at the 1989 [[Geneva Motor Show]]. This highly controversial design went into limited production as the [[Alfa Romeo SZ]] coup\u00e9 and the later RZ convertible, where the \"Z\" refers to coachbuilder [[Zagato]]. The model was also given the nickname \"Il Mostro\" (the monster) for its unusual appearance.\n\nIn 1992 Opron left Fiat at sixty years of age, having reached mandatory retirement age.<ref name=\"drive-my\"/>\n\n===Independent consultant===\nFrom 1991 to 2000 he operated his own independent design consultancy in [[Verri\u00e8res-le-Buisson]] in south Paris ([[Essonne]]).\n\nOne of Opron's clients was Ligier, who had become a manufacturer of \"voitures sans permis\" or \"voiturettes\", a class of microcar in France that may be driven without an operator's license. For Ligier Opron produced the original Du\u00e9, which debuted at the 1998 [[Paris Motor Show]].<ref name=\"cf-due\"/><ref name=\"dkbook\"/> The Ligier Dragonfly shown at the 2000 [[Geneva Motor Show]] was also an Opron design.<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/>\n\nOpron also consulted for [[Piaggio]].<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\"/>\n\n==Design gallery==\n{{gallery\n|File:Simca Fulgur 1958 (3593990695).jpg|[[Simca#Fulgur|Simca Fulgur]] (1958)\n|File:Citroen DS 23 Pallas.jpg| Citro\u00ebn DS (1967) \"Nouveau Visage\"\n|File:Citroen Ami 8 February 1973 mfd 1972 602cc.jpg| Citro\u00ebn Ami 8 (1969)\n|File:Citroen SM (14521154082).jpg| [[Citro\u00ebn SM]] (1970) 1972 [[Motor Trend Car of the Year]].\n|File:50 ans de la GS.jpg| Citro\u00ebn GS<ref name=\"independent-gs\"/> (1970) 1971 [[European Car of the Year]].\n|File:Citroen CX Sum08.jpg| Citro\u00ebn CX<ref name=\"cpc-show\"/> (1974) 1975 European Car of the Year.\n|File:1980 Renault Alpine A310 V6 - 14404217287.jpg| [[Renault Alpine A310]] V6 (1976)\n|File:Renault Fuego France.jpg | [[Renault Fuego]] (1980)\n|File:Renault 9 Cambridge.jpg|[[Renault 9]]<ref name=\"rfo-opron\"/> (1981) 1982 European Car of the Year.\n|File:Renault 11 (46325126544).jpg| [[Renault 11]]<ref name=\"9et11-hist\"/> (1983)\n|File:Renault25.jpg| [[Renault 25]]<ref name=\"cpc-r25\"/> (1984)\n|File:1990 Alfa Romeo SZ 3.0 Front.jpg| [[Alfa Romeo SZ]]<ref name=\"rt-oct2017\"/> (1989)\n|}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"caspersbook\">{{cite book |last=Caspers |first=Markus |date=26 September 2016 |title=Designing Motion: Automotive Designers 1890 to 1990 |url= |location= |publisher=Birkh\u00e4user |isbn=978-3035609820 |page=149<!--|page=127 --> |author-link=}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"dear-mag\">{{cite web |last=Maak |first=Niklas |url=https://www.dear-magazin.de/stories/Autopilot-49_-Vive-la-Berline_17515119.html |title=Autopilot #49: Vive la Berline |website=www.dear-magazin.de }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"octane-oct2017\">{{cite magazine |last=Guenzel |first=Peter |date=28 October 2017 |title=Robert Opron |url=https://www.pressreader.com/france/octane-france/20171028/283021169927764 |magazine=Octane |location= |publisher= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"leroux-bio\">{{cite web |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |url=http://leroux.andre.free.fr/carrossieropron.htm |title=Robert Opron |website=leroux.andre.free.fr }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"clubzeitung\">{{cite magazine |last=B\u00f6ttcher |first=Gerrit |title=Robert Opron \u2014 zum Anlass seines 75 zigsten Geburtstages |trans-title=Robert Opron \u2014 on the occasion of his 75th birthday |url=https://www.citroensmclub.de/files/SM_Clubzeitung_Nr_76.pdf |magazine=Citro\u00ebn-Clubzeitung |location= |publisher=Citro\u00ebn-SM-Club Deutschland e.

Rogers Media also owns 52 radio stations and several television properties, including [[terrestrial television]] stations and [[cable television]] channels.\n\n==History==\nRogers Media was created in 1994 after the acquisition of [[Maclean-Hunter]] properties to manage all television station and specialty channels, radio stations and publishing assets. The division is split into two areas:\n\n*Broadcasting (television and radio)\n*Publishing (magazines and directories)\n\nRogers Media holds Rogers Communications' radio and television broadcasting operations, as well as the consumer and trade publishing operations, other television properties and notably the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] and [[Rogers Centre]]. Rogers Media also produces content and conducts e-commerce over the Internet relating to many of its individual broadcasting and publishing properties.\n\nThe group has 52 radio stations across Canada (as of 2015), 44 FM and 8 AM radio stations, thus making Rogers Media the third-largest radio broadcaster behind [[Bell Media]] and [[Newcap Radio]], the latter absorbed into the [[Stingray Group]]); both the [[Citytv]] and [[Omni Television]] networks consisting of 10 television stations. The division also operates specialty channels, including [[Sportsnet]], [[OLN]] and [[G4 (Canada)|G4]], and also owns an interest in the [[pay-per-view]] service [[Viewers Choice]]. Through Sportsnet, Rogers Media also holds 50% ownership in Dome Productions, a mobile production and distribution joint venture that is a leader in high-definition television (HDTV) production and broadcasting in Canada.\n\nRogers Media's publishing group publishes several consumer magazines and trade and professional publications and directories in Canada.\n\n==Operations==\n{{main|List of assets owned by Rogers Communications}}\n\n===Broadcasting===\nRogers Broadcasting Limited operates 52 Canadian radio stations, (44 FM and 8 AM radio stations) including formerly three (now two) FM stations launched in the Maritimes in October 2005; [[Omni Television]], which operates five multicultural television stations (two in Ontario, two in Alberta, and one in British Columbia); [[Citytv]]; which operates 7 stations in Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, Montreal and Saskatchewan (cable-only) with 3 privately owned affiliates in Prince George, Kamloops, and Medicine Hat; [[Sportsnet]], a specialty sports television service licensed to provide regional sports programming across Canada; [[The Shopping Channel]], Canada's only nationally televised shopping service, [[The Biography Channel (Canada)|The Biography Channel Canada]], acquired outright in August 2006 when Rogers bought out the 40% stake owned by Calgary's Shaw Communications and A&E Television Networks' 20% ownership.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shoprogers.com/investorrelations/rogers_media.asp?shopperID=QPPF8GKRFXM98K9D6F1MFKBU47SNBAP9 |title=Investor Relations |access-date=20 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928035807/http://www.shoprogers.com/investorrelations/rogers_media.asp?shopperID=QPPF8GKRFXM98K9D6F1MFKBU47SNBAP9 |archive-date=28 September 2007 |work=Rogers Communications Inc.}}</ref> and a majority and managing interest in [[G4 Canada]], a technology themed digital channel.  Rogers has returned to Canada's third-largest radio broadcaster behind [[Bell Media]] and [[Newcap Radio]].\n\nRogers also was a partner in [[DTour]] and [[Viewers Choice]]. Rogers also is a non-managing partner in [[OLN]], although on November 16, 2007, it was announced that Rogers would be acquiring 100% interest in the service from the remaining interest holders, CTVglobemedia and Comcast.\n\nSome of the better-known [[Rogers Radio|Rogers radio stations]] are CHFI Toronto ([[Canada]]'s most-listened to radio station), Kiss 92.5, CJCL Toronto (The FAN 590), CFTR Toronto (680 News), and various stations operating under the Jack FM brand. In summer 2006, Rogers acquired five stations from OK Radio in Alberta and, with regulatory approval, will be operating in Edmonton, Fort McMurray and Grande Prairie. Existing clusters of stations are in Vancouver-Victoria-Whistler, Calgary-Lethbridge, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa, Kitchener and Halifax-Moncton-Saint John, NB.\n\nIn 2007, Rogers entered a tentative deal to purchase the [[CTV Two|A Channel]] stations, [[CKX-TV]], [[Access Alberta]], [[Canadian Learning Television]] and [[SexTV: The Channel]] from [[CHUM Limited]], as part of the latter company's pending takeover by [[CTVglobemedia]].  On June 8, 2007, the CRTC approved the [[CTVglobemedia|CTV]] transaction of CHUM, but it added a condition that CTV must divest itself of Citytv rather than A-Channel, effectively voiding the deal. On June 12, it was announced that Rogers had made a new offer of $375 million for the Citytv stations. On June 28, Rogers further offered to sell the two religious-licensed Omni stations in Winnipeg and Vancouver as part of the Citytv deal, although the company stated that it intended to retain the multilingual-licensed Omni stations.

Rogers Media also owns 52 radio stations and several television properties, including [[terrestrial television]] stations and [[cable television]] channels.\n\n==History==\nRogers Media was created in 1994 after the acquisition of [[Maclean-Hunter]] properties to manage all television station and specialty channels, radio stations and publishing assets. The division is split into two areas:\n\n*Broadcasting (television and radio)\n*Publishing (magazines and directories)\n\nRogers Media holds Rogers Communications' radio and television broadcasting operations, as well as the consumer and trade publishing operations, other television properties and notably the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] and [[Rogers Centre]]. Rogers Media also produces content and conducts e-commerce over the Internet relating to many of its individual broadcasting and publishing properties.\n\nThe group has 52 radio stations across Canada (as of 2015), 44 FM and 8 AM radio stations, thus making Rogers Media the third-largest radio broadcaster behind [[Bell Media]] and [[Newcap Radio]], the latter absorbed into the [[Stingray Group]]); both the [[Citytv]] and [[Omni Television]] networks consisting of 10 television stations. The division also operates specialty channels, including [[Sportsnet]], [[OLN]] and [[G4 (Canada)|G4]], and also owns an interest in the [[pay-per-view]] service [[Viewers Choice]]. Through Sportsnet, Rogers Media also holds 50% ownership in Dome Productions, a mobile production and distribution joint venture that is a leader in high-definition television (HDTV) production and broadcasting in Canada.\n\nRogers Media's publishing group publishes several consumer magazines and trade and professional publications and directories in Canada.\n\n==Operations==\n{{main|List of assets owned by Rogers Communications}}\n\n===Broadcasting===\nRogers Broadcasting Limited operates 52 Canadian radio stations, (44 FM and 8 AM radio stations) including formerly three (now two) FM stations launched in the Maritimes in October 2005; [[Omni Television]], which operates five multicultural television stations (two in Ontario, two in Alberta, and one in British Columbia); [[Citytv]]; which operates 7 stations in Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, Montreal and Saskatchewan (cable-only) with 3 privately owned affiliates in Prince George, Kamloops, and Medicine Hat; [[Sportsnet]], a specialty sports television service licensed to provide regional sports programming across Canada; [[The Shopping Channel]], Canada's only nationally televised shopping service, [[The Biography Channel (Canada)|The Biography Channel Canada]], acquired outright in August 2006 when Rogers bought out the 40% stake owned by Calgary's Shaw Communications and A&E Television Networks' 20% ownership.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shoprogers.com/investorrelations/rogers_media.asp?shopperID=QPPF8GKRFXM98K9D6F1MFKBU47SNBAP9 |title=Investor Relations |access-date=20 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928035807/http://www.shoprogers.com/investorrelations/rogers_media.asp?shopperID=QPPF8GKRFXM98K9D6F1MFKBU47SNBAP9 |archive-date=28 September 2007 |work=Rogers Communications Inc.}}</ref> and a majority and managing interest in [[G4 Canada]], a technology themed digital channel.  Rogers has returned to Canada's third-largest radio broadcaster behind [[Bell Media]] and [[Newcap Radio]].\n\nRogers also was a partner in [[DTour]] and [[Viewers Choice]]. Rogers also is a non-managing partner in [[OLN]], although on November 16, 2007, it was announced that Rogers would be acquiring 100% interest in the service from the remaining interest holders, CTVglobemedia and Comcast.\n\nSome of the better-known [[Rogers Radio|Rogers radio stations]] are CHFI Toronto ([[Canada]]'s most-listened to radio station), Kiss 92.5, CJCL Toronto (The FAN 590), CFTR Toronto (680 News), and various stations operating under the Jack FM brand. In summer 2006, Rogers acquired five stations from OK Radio in Alberta and, with regulatory approval, will be operating in Edmonton, Fort McMurray and Grande Prairie. Existing clusters of stations are in Vancouver-Victoria-Whistler, Calgary-Lethbridge, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa, Kitchener and Halifax-Moncton-Saint John, NB.\n\nIn 2007, Rogers entered a tentative deal to purchase the [[CTV Two|A Channel]] stations, [[CKX-TV]], [[Access Alberta]], [[Canadian Learning Television]] and [[SexTV: The Channel]] from [[CHUM Limited]], as part of the latter company's pending takeover by [[CTVglobemedia]].  On June 8, 2007, the CRTC approved the [[CTVglobemedia|CTV]] transaction of CHUM, but it added a condition that CTV must divest itself of Citytv rather than A-Channel, effectively voiding the deal. On June 12, it was announced that Rogers had made a new offer of $375 million for the Citytv stations. On June 28, Rogers further offered to sell the two religious-licensed Omni stations in Winnipeg and Vancouver as part of the Citytv deal, although the company stated that it intended to retain the multilingual-licensed Omni stations.

With significant investment, he presided over a rebuilding phase. Inter had finished thirteenth and sixth in the seasons prior to his arrival. After a terrible start to the season that saw the team bottom of Serie A, Hodgson was brought in and guided the club to seventh place in the [[1995\u201396 Serie A|1995\u201396 season]], qualifying for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. In an interview with ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' in a May 2005 issue, Roberto Carlos stated that he had difficulties with Hodgson throughout the 1995\u201396 season, and that his decision to leave Inter at the end of the season was largely due to Hodgson's refusal to field him in his preferred position, as a left-back, rather than in a more advanced position on the wing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fourfourtwo.com/interviews/one-on-one/236/article.aspx |title=Roberto Carlos \u2013 One-on-One |work=[[FourFourTwo]] |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=1 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1996\u201397 Serie A|1996\u201397 season]] saw Hodgson leave Inter after guiding them to a third-place finish. He was replaced by [[Luigi Simoni]] whose side finished second in the league in the [[1997\u201398 Serie A|1997\u201398 season]] and won the UEFA Cup. In an interview in 2009, Hodgson recalled his time at Inter: \"We lacked stars, apart from [[Paul Ince]]. It wasn't the Inter we see today of household names. They weren't the best technically but physically they were like machines. The Premier League is like that now, but back then Italy was far ahead.\"<ref name=\"The Man That is Roy Hodgson\" />\n\nHodgson managed to get his Inter team, containing [[Javier Zanetti]], [[Youri Djorkaeff]] and Ince, through to the [[1997 UEFA Cup Final]], where they played [[Schalke 04]]. Given that Inter had a recent history of winning UEFA Cup finals, with victories in both 1991 and 1994, the Italian side started as favourites. It was the last UEFA Cup final to be played over two legs, with each club winning their home leg 1\u20130. When the German underdogs won the final in Milan on penalties, Inter fans pelted Hodgson with coins and lighters.<ref>[http://tomkinstimes.com/2010/06/does-roy-hodgson-have-the-credentials/ Does Roy Hodgson Have The Credentials?] ''The Tomkins Times'', 29 June 2010</ref> The final was his last match in charge and he subsequently left to become the manager of [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. In the same 2009 interview, Hodgson recalled how club president [[Massimo Moratti]] tried to talk him out of leaving: \"I could have stayed. They offered me a new contract, but I had a feeling that they wanted a change. So I allowed my contract at Inter to run out. Even after I agreed to join Blackburn, Moratti did say to me: 'I don't know why you didn't stay here, but if that's what you want to do I won't stand in your way.'\"<ref name=\"thrown\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/9242220/England-manager-Roy-Hodgson-had-big-stars-at-Inter-Milan-but-he-handled-everything-thrown-at-him.html |title=England manager Roy Hodgson had big stars at Inter Milan but he handled everything thrown at him |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=2 May 2012|accessdate=18 June 2012 |first=Jonathan |last=Liew}}</ref>\n\nSpeaking about Hodgson's time at Inter, club president Massimo Moratti said: \"Roy Hodgson was an important person in the development of Inter Milan to the point we have reached today.

Manager [[Ray Harford]] had resigned on 25 October 1996 with Blackburn winless, bottom of the Premier League and just knocked out of the [[Football League Cup]] by Division Two underdogs [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]]. Manager [[Tony Parkes]] had been put in charge for the rest of the season and had overseen an improvement in league form to secure survival, but it was clear that Walker wanted a more experienced man to build a side capable of regaining the form of a few years earlier,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} and Hodgson accepted the offer to take over.\n\nIn the [[1997\u201398 FA Premier League|1997\u201398 season]], his first season in charge, Blackburn finished sixth, qualifying for the UEFA Cup and appearing to be in the ascendancy, especially as they had been outsiders in the title race for more than half of the season and Hodgson had been voted [[Premier League Manager of the Month]] on two occasions, in August and December 1997.

Five successive defeats preceded a run of five unbeaten. Three straight defeats were then followed by three unbeaten before their final four games garnered one win and three defeats, meaning the club finished twelfth, just four points off ninth place.

In an interview with ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' in a May 2005 issue, Roberto Carlos stated that he had difficulties with Hodgson throughout the 1995\u201396 season, and that his decision to leave Inter at the end of the season was largely due to Hodgson's refusal to field him in his preferred position, as a left-back, rather than in a more advanced position on the wing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fourfourtwo.com/interviews/one-on-one/236/article.aspx |title=Roberto Carlos \u2013 One-on-One |work=[[FourFourTwo]] |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=1 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1996\u201397 Serie A|1996\u201397 season]] saw Hodgson leave Inter after guiding them to a third-place finish. He was replaced by [[Luigi Simoni]] whose side finished second in the league in the [[1997\u201398 Serie A|1997\u201398 season]] and won the UEFA Cup. In an interview in 2009, Hodgson recalled his time at Inter: \"We lacked stars, apart from [[Paul Ince]]. It wasn't the Inter we see today of household names. They weren't the best technically but physically they were like machines. The Premier League is like that now, but back then Italy was far ahead.\"<ref name=\"The Man That is Roy Hodgson\" />\n\nHodgson managed to get his Inter team, containing [[Javier Zanetti]], [[Youri Djorkaeff]] and Ince, through to the [[1997 UEFA Cup Final]], where they played [[Schalke 04]]. Given that Inter had a recent history of winning UEFA Cup finals, with victories in both 1991 and 1994, the Italian side started as favourites. It was the last UEFA Cup final to be played over two legs, with each club winning their home leg 1\u20130. When the German underdogs won the final in Milan on penalties, Inter fans pelted Hodgson with coins and lighters.<ref>[http://tomkinstimes.com/2010/06/does-roy-hodgson-have-the-credentials/ Does Roy Hodgson Have The Credentials?] ''The Tomkins Times'', 29 June 2010</ref> The final was his last match in charge and he subsequently left to become the manager of [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. In the same 2009 interview, Hodgson recalled how club president [[Massimo Moratti]] tried to talk him out of leaving: \"I could have stayed. They offered me a new contract, but I had a feeling that they wanted a change. So I allowed my contract at Inter to run out. Even after I agreed to join Blackburn, Moratti did say to me: 'I don't know why you didn't stay here, but if that's what you want to do I won't stand in your way.'\"<ref name=\"thrown\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/9242220/England-manager-Roy-Hodgson-had-big-stars-at-Inter-Milan-but-he-handled-everything-thrown-at-him.html |title=England manager Roy Hodgson had big stars at Inter Milan but he handled everything thrown at him |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=2 May 2012|accessdate=18 June 2012 |first=Jonathan |last=Liew}}</ref>\n\nSpeaking about Hodgson's time at Inter, club president Massimo Moratti said: \"Roy Hodgson was an important person in the development of Inter Milan to the point we have reached today.

Manager [[Ray Harford]] had resigned on 25 October 1996 with Blackburn winless, bottom of the Premier League and just knocked out of the [[Football League Cup]] by Division Two underdogs [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]]. Manager [[Tony Parkes]] had been put in charge for the rest of the season and had overseen an improvement in league form to secure survival, but it was clear that Walker wanted a more experienced man to build a side capable of regaining the form of a few years earlier,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} and Hodgson accepted the offer to take over.\n\nIn the [[1997\u201398 FA Premier League|1997\u201398 season]], his first season in charge, Blackburn finished sixth, qualifying for the UEFA Cup and appearing to be in the ascendancy, especially as they had been outsiders in the title race for more than half of the season and Hodgson had been voted [[Premier League Manager of the Month]] on two occasions, in August and December 1997.

Five successive defeats preceded a run of five unbeaten. Three straight defeats were then followed by three unbeaten before their final four games garnered one win and three defeats, meaning the club finished twelfth, just four points off ninth place.
