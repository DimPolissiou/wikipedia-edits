He played [[college football]] at [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]], and was drafted by the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in the first round (25th overall) of the [[2013 NFL Draft]]. With the Vikings, Rhodes made three [[Pro Bowls]] and a First-team [[All-Pro]] selection.\n\n==Early years==\nRhodes attended [[Miami Norland High School]] in [[Miami Gardens, Florida]], where he was a two-sport star in football and track. He played as a [[wide receiver]], [[running back]], and [[defensive back]] for the Miami Norland Vikings [[high school football|football]] team. As a junior, he recorded more than 1,000 all-purpose yards. In his senior year, he led his school in both rushing and receiving. He played in the 12th annual Nike South Florida All-Star game. He was honored as 6A FSWA first-team All-state selection, and a first-team All-Dade County athlete.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seminoles.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=32900&ATCLID=209588187|title=Florida State Seminoles Official Athletic Site|website=Florida State Seminoles}}</ref>\n\nRhodes also excelled in [[track & field]] at Norland. In his first season of track in 2007, he posted a personal-best time of 48.60 seconds in the [[400-meter dash]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fl.milesplit.com/meets/23344/results/44264|title=Sandra Darr Paladin Elite Invitational - Complete Results (Raw)|publisher=}}</ref> At the 2008 Sam Burley Hall of Fame Meet, he earned a third-place finish in the [[200-meter dash]] event with a time of 22.25 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fl.milesplit.com/meets/30999/results/62382|title=Sam Burley Hall of Fame Meet - Complete Results (Raw)|publisher=}}</ref> As a senior, he qualified for the state finals in the [[100-meter dash]] after running a career-best time of 10.70 seconds in the prelims of the regional championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fl.milesplit.com/meets/52674/results/89218|title=FHSAA 4A District 13 - Boys (Raw)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nRegarded as a three-star recruit by [[Rivals.com]], Rhodes was listed as the No. 75 wide receiver and the No. 91 prospect in the state of Florida.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/floridastate/football/recruiting/player-Xavier-Rhodes-78157|title=Rivals.com|website=sports.yahoo.com}}</ref> He chose FSU over scholarship offers from [[West Virginia University|West Virginia]], [[Auburn University|Auburn]], and [[Florida International University|Florida International]].\n\n==College career==\nRhodes received an athletic scholarship to attend [[Florida State University]], where he played for coach [[Jimbo Fisher]]'s [[Florida State Seminoles football]] team from 2009 to 2012. He started 38 of 43 games in the secondary in his distinguished college career.\n\n===Freshman (redshirt)===\n{{see also|2009 Florida State Seminoles football team}}\nAs a freshman in 2009, Rhodes played in only two games against [[2009 Boston College Eagles football team|Boston College]] and [[2009 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|Georgia Tech]] on special teams before suffering a hand injury that sidelined him for the rest of the season. He was granted a [[Redshirt (college sports)|medical redshirt]], preserving him another year of college eligibility.\n\n===Freshman===\n{{see also|2010 Florida State Seminoles football team}}\nIn 2010, Rhodes started all 14 games at the boundary cornerback position and emerged as a promising young star for FSU's vastly improved defense. He used his physical attributes to record 12 pass breakups and four interceptions, good for a share of the team lead. His pass breakups and 16 passes defended led all freshmen nationally. He was credited with three pass breakups in pivotal Atlantic Division wins over [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]] and [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]]. He also intercepted a pass in the end zone against the Tigers which proved to swing the momentum in the Seminoles' 16-13 victory. His previous interceptions came against [[BYU Cougars football|BYU]] and [[NC State Wolfpack football|NC State]]. A sure tackler, the [[Miami]] native ranked seventh on the team with 58 stops and his 49 solo tackles ranked fourth. Rhodes's ability to play close to the line of scrimmage in coverage enabled him to collect 3.5 tackles for loss on the season and two sacks. He recovered the first two fumbles of his career in FSU's home finale against [[Florida Gators football|Florida]] in a 31-7 rout. He was named one of the top newcomers on defense at the annual Florida State football banquet. In all, he recorded 54 tackles, four [[interceptions]], and two [[quarterback sack|sacks]]. He was named the ACC Defensive Rookie of the Year and was a consensus freshman [[All-American]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/sports_college_fsu/2010/11/florida-state-cb-xavier-rhodes-named-acc-defensive-rookie-of-the-year.html|title=Florida State CB Xavier Rhodes named ACC defensive rookie of the year|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cfn.scout.com/2/1031167.html|title=2010 All-Freshman Team|publisher=}}</ref> He also earned National Defensive Freshman of the Year honors from ''[[Collegefootballnews.com]]''.\n\n===Sophomore===\n{{see also|2011 Florida State Seminoles football team}}\nIn his redshirt sophomore season in 2011, Rhodes started as part of a three-man cornerback rotation with [[Mike Harris (American football)|Mike Harris]] and [[Greg Reid]]. He made five tackles at [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]], at [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons football|Wake Forest]], and [[Duke Blue Devils football|Duke]]. Against [[2010 Maryland Terrapins football team|Maryland]], Rhodes tallied a season-high six tackles. He intercepted his first pass of the season against [[NC State Wolfpack football|NC State]]. He finished with four tackles in the win over [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] in the 2011 [[Champs Sports Bowl]]. He registered 43 stops (36 solo) on the season with 1.5 tackles for loss, one interception, and four pass-breakups for the season. He was selected as the Mr. Dependable Skill Award winner at the team's annual banquet.\n\n===Junior===\n{{see also|2012 Florida State Seminoles football team}}\nFor his junior season in 2012, Rhodes was named to preseason watchlists for the [[Bednarik Award]] and [[Nagurski Trophy]]. He was also the only player from the ACC to be named a semifinalist for the [[Thorpe Award]]. He defended 10 passes on the season, placing 11th in the ACC and leading all FSU players, while his three interceptions tied for 8th and also tied for the team lead, leading this to earn first-team All-ACC honors. He also added seven pass break-ups which tied for third on the team. He recorded 39 tackles (27 unassisted) and 2.0 tackles for loss. His third interception and eighth career pick came in the [[2012 ACC Championship Game|ACC Championship Game]] versus [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]]. The two other picks came against [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]] and at [[South Florida Bulls football|USF]]. He forced and recovered a fumble in the [[2012 Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] against [[Northern Illinois Huskies football|Northern Illinois]]. He registered a season-high seven tackles at [[NC State Wolfpack football|NC State]]. He anchored an FSU secondary that held nine of the top 10 receivers in the ACC at the time they faced them to a combined 22 catches for 244 yards. In the last 12 games, he was targeted 47 times and allowed just 13 completions for 88 yards with two interceptions and seven pass break-ups. He helped Florida State's defense lead the nation in yards allowed per play (3.86), rank second nationally in total defense (254.14 ypg) and rank in the top six nationally in scoring defense (14.71 ppg), rushing defense (92.29 ypg), pass defense (161.86 ypg), pass efficiency defense (95.43) and opponent three-and-outs (6.29 per game). He earned the Mr. Dependable Skill Award at the team's annual banquet for the second straight year.\n\nShortly after FSU's 31\u201310 victory over [[2012 Northern Illinois Huskies football team|Northern Illinois]] in the [[2013 Orange Bowl]], Rhodes announced his decision to forgo his final year of collegiate eligibility, entering the [[2013 NFL Draft]]. \"I did all I could in college. If I was to come back, I don't think my status would be getting any better,\" said Rhodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/draft2013/story/_/id/8802125/xavier-rhodes-florida-state-seminoles-cornerback-enter-2013-nfl-draft|title=Seminoles CB Rhodes declares for NFL draft|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Statistics===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Team\n! colspan=\"2\"| Games\n! colspan=\"4\"| Tackles\n! colspan=\"6\"| Interceptions\n! colspan=\"2\"| Fumbles\n|-\n!

This era of \"purism\" by the SWP sparked criticisms by a number of persons. Two counter-movements emerged during this period of \"purism\": one campaigning against Tagalog and the other campaigning for more inclusiveness in the national language. In 1963, [[Negros Occidental]] congressman [[Innocencio V. Ferrer]] took a case reaching the Supreme Court questioning the constitutionality of the choice of Tagalog as the basis of the national language (a case ruled in favor of the national language in 1970). Accusing the national language as simply being Tagalog and lacking any substantial input from other Philippine languages, Congressman [[Geruncio Lacuesta]] eventually led a \"Modernizing the Language Approach Movement\" (MOLAM). Lacuesta hosted a number of \"anti-purist\" conferences and promoted a \u201cManila Lingua Franca\u201d which would be more inclusive of loanwords of both foreign and local languages. Lacuesta managed to get nine congressmen to propose a bill aiming to abolish the SWP with an ''Akademia ng Wikang Filipino'', to replace the ''balarila'' with a ''Gramatica ng Wikang Filipino'', to replace the 20-letter Abakada with a 32-letter alphabet, and to prohibit the creation of neologisms and the respelling of loanwords. This movement quietened down following the death of Lacuesta.<ref>{{cite publication|url=http://kwf.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FAQ_2.4.15-1.pdf |title=Frequently Asked Questions on the National Language |publisher=Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino}}</ref><ref name=\"Gonzalez\"/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Tan|first1=Michael L.|title=Behind Filipino (2)|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/77916/behind-filipino-2|publisher=inquirer.net|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe national language issue was revived once more during the [[1970 Philippine Constitutional Convention election|1971 Constitutional Convention]].

On May 23, 2007, Ricardo Maria Nolasco, KWF chair and a linguistics expert, acknowledged in a keynote speech during the NAKEM Conference at the [[Mariano Marcos State University]] in Batac, Ilocos Norte, that Filipino was simply Tagalog in syntax and grammar, with as yet no grammatical element or lexicon coming from [[Ilokano language|Ilokano]], [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], or any of the other [[Philippine languages]]. He said further that this is contrary to the intention of Republic Act No. 7104 that requires that the [[national language]] be developed and enriched by the lexicon of the country's other languages, something that the commission is working towards.<ref name=Nolasco07>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.asianjournal.com/?c=53&a=20983\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080703172807/http://www.asianjournal.com/?c=53&a=20983\n| archivedate=2008-07-03| title = New center to document Philippine dialects\n| accessdate = 2007-06-30\n| author = Inquirer\n| year = 2007\n| publisher = Asian Journal\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Wika / Maraming Wika, Matatag na Bansa - Chairman Nolasco|url=http://wika.pbworks.com/w/page/8021683/Maraming%20Wika%2C%20Matatag%20na%20Bansa%20-%20Chairman%20Nolasco|website=wika.pbworks.com|accessdate=15 February 2018|language=en}}</ref> On 24 August 2007, Nolasco elaborated further on the relationship between Tagalog and Filipino in a separate article, as follows:\n\n{{Quote|Are \"Tagalog,\" \"Pilipino\" and \"Filipino\" different languages? No, they are mutually intelligible varieties, and therefore belong to one language. According to the KWF, Filipino is that speech variety spoken in Metro Manila and other urban centers where different ethnic groups meet. It is the most prestigious variety of Tagalog and the language used by the national mass media.\n\nThe other yardstick for distinguishing a language from a dialect is: different grammar, different language. \"Filipino\", \"Pilipino\" and \"Tagalog\" share identical grammar. They have the same determiners (ang, ng and sa); the same personal pronouns (siya, ako, niya, kanila, etc.); the same demonstrative pronouns (ito, iyan, doon, etc.); the same linkers (na, at and ay); the same particles (na and pa); and the same verbal affixes -in, -an, i- and -um-. In short, same grammar, same language.<ref name=\"Filipino-Tagalog-Not-So-Simple\" />}}\n\nIn connection with the use of Filipino, or specifically the promotion of the national language, the related term ''Tagalista'' is frequently used. While the word ''Tagalista'' literally means \"one who specializes in Tagalog language or culture\" or a \"Tagalog specialist\", in the context of the debates on the national language and \"[[Imperial Manila]]\", the word ''Tagalista'' is used as a reference to \"people who promote or would promote the primacy of Tagalog at the expense of [the] other [Philippine] indigenous tongues\".<ref name=Tagalista>{{cite book|last=Martinez|first=David|title=A Country of Our Own: Partitioning the Philippines|page=202|publisher=Bisaya Books|year=2004|place=Los Angeles, California|isbn=9780976061304}}</ref>\n\n==Unicode==\n{{Main|Tagalog (Unicode block)}}\n\nTagalog-Numbers Unicode range: U+0000-U+007F U+1700\u2013U+171F\n\n{{Unicode chart Basic Latin}}\n{{Unicode chart Tagalog}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philippines|Language}}\n* [[Abakada alphabet]]\n* [[Philippine literature]]\n* [[Filipinology|Philippine studies]]\n* [[Filipino Sign Language]]\n* [[Filipino alphabet]]\n* [[Filipino orthography]]\n* [[Austronesian languages]]\n* [[Sa Aking Mga Kabata]]\n* [[Tagalog grammar]]\n* [[Tagalog phonology]]\n* [[Taglish]]\n* [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]]\n* [[Chavacano]]\n* [[List of loanwords in Tagalog]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{citation\n|date = 14 August 1991\n|title = Commission on the Filipino Language Act\n|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1991/ra_7104_1991.html\n|ref = {{harvid|Commission on the Filipino Language Act|1991}}\n}}\n* {{Citation\n|url=http://www.gov.ph/constitutions/1973-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-2/\n|title=1973 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines\n|work=Official Gazette|publisher=Government of the Philippines\n|ref={{harvid|Constitution of the Philippines|1973}}\n}}\n* {{Citation\n|url=http://www.gov.ph/constitutions/the-amended-1973-constitution-2/\n|title=The Amended 1973 Constitution\n|work=Official Gazette\n|publisher=Government of the Philippines\n|ref={{harvid|Amended Constitution of the Philippines|1976}}\n}}\n* {{Citation\n|date = 2 February 1987\n|title = Constitution of the Philippines\n|url = http://www.gov.ph/constitutions/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines/\n|ref = {{harvid|Constitution of the Philippines|1987}}\n}}\n* {{Citation\n| url = http://www.chanrobles.com/article14language.htm\n| title =The Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines\n| date = February 2, 1987\n| accessdate = 2017-02-12\n| publisher = Chanrobles Law Library\n|ref = {{harvid|1987 constitution art 14 sec 6-7}}\n}}\n* {{citation\n|author-last = Tabbada\n|author-first = Emil V.\n|editor-last = Gripaldo\n|editor-first = Rolando M.\n|editor2-last = McLean\n|editor2-first = George F.\n|year = 2005\n|work = Cultural Heritage and Contemporary Change\n|series = IIID, Southeast Asia\n|volume = 4\n|title = Filipino Cultural Traits: Claro R.

This era of \"purism\" by the SWP sparked criticisms by a number of persons. Two counter-movements emerged during this period of \"purism\": one campaigning against Tagalog and the other campaigning for more inclusiveness in the national language. In 1963, [[Negros Occidental]] congressman [[Innocencio V. Ferrer]] took a case reaching the Supreme Court questioning the constitutionality of the choice of Tagalog as the basis of the national language (a case ruled in favor of the national language in 1970). Accusing the national language as simply being Tagalog and lacking any substantial input from other Philippine languages, Congressman [[Geruncio Lacuesta]] eventually led a \"Modernizing the Language Approach Movement\" (MOLAM). Lacuesta hosted a number of \"anti-purist\" conferences and promoted a \u201cManila Lingua Franca\u201d which would be more inclusive of loanwords of both foreign and local languages. Lacuesta managed to get nine congressmen to propose a bill aiming to abolish the SWP with an ''Akademia ng Wikang Filipino'', to replace the ''balarila'' with a ''Gramatica ng Wikang Filipino'', to replace the 20-letter Abakada with a 32-letter alphabet, and to prohibit the creation of neologisms and the respelling of loanwords. This movement quietened down following the death of Lacuesta.<ref>{{cite publication|url=http://kwf.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FAQ_2.4.15-1.pdf |title=Frequently Asked Questions on the National Language |publisher=Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino}}</ref><ref name=\"Gonzalez\"/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Tan|first1=Michael L.|title=Behind Filipino (2)|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/77916/behind-filipino-2|publisher=inquirer.net|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe national language issue was revived once more during the [[1970 Philippine Constitutional Convention election|1971 Constitutional Convention]]. While there was a sizable number of delegates in favor of retaining the Tagalog-based national language, majority of the delegates who were non-Tagalogs were even in favor of scrapping the idea of a \"national language\" altogether.<ref>{{cite web|title=What the PH constitutions say about the national language|url=https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/65477-national-language-philippine-constitutions|website=Rappler|language=en}}</ref> A compromise was reached and the wording on the 1973 constitution made no mention of dropping the national language Pilipino or made any mention of Tagalog. Instead, the [[Constitution of the Philippines#1973 constitution|1973 Constitution]], in both its original form and as amended in 1976, designated English and Pilipino as official languages and provided for development and formal adoption of a common national language, termed ''Filipino'', to replace Pilipino.

On May 23, 2007, Ricardo Maria Nolasco, KWF chair and a linguistics expert, acknowledged in a keynote speech during the NAKEM Conference at the [[Mariano Marcos State University]] in Batac, Ilocos Norte, that Filipino was simply Tagalog in syntax and grammar, with as yet no grammatical element or lexicon coming from [[Ilokano language|Ilokano]], [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], or any of the other [[Philippine languages]]. He said further that this is contrary to the intention of Republic Act No. 7104 that requires that the [[national language]] be developed and enriched by the lexicon of the country's other languages, something that the commission is working towards.<ref name=Nolasco07>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.asianjournal.com/?c=53&a=20983\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080703172807/http://www.asianjournal.com/?c=53&a=20983\n| archivedate=2008-07-03| title = New center to document Philippine dialects\n| accessdate = 2007-06-30\n| author = Inquirer\n| year = 2007\n| publisher = Asian Journal\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Wika / Maraming Wika, Matatag na Bansa - Chairman Nolasco|url=http://wika.pbworks.com/w/page/8021683/Maraming%20Wika%2C%20Matatag%20na%20Bansa%20-%20Chairman%20Nolasco|website=wika.pbworks.com|accessdate=15 February 2018|language=en}}</ref> On 24 August 2007, Nolasco elaborated further on the relationship between Tagalog and Filipino in a separate article, as follows:\n\n{{Quote|Are \"Tagalog,\" \"Pilipino\" and \"Filipino\" different languages? No, they are mutually intelligible varieties, and therefore belong to one language. According to the KWF, Filipino is that speech variety spoken in Metro Manila and other urban centers where different ethnic groups meet. It is the most prestigious variety of Tagalog and the language used by the national mass media.\n\nThe other yardstick for distinguishing a language from a dialect is: different grammar, different language. \"Filipino\", \"Pilipino\" and \"Tagalog\" share identical grammar. They have the same determiners (ang, ng and sa); the same personal pronouns (siya, ako, niya, kanila, etc.); the same demonstrative pronouns (ito, iyan, doon, etc.); the same linkers (na, at and ay); the same particles (na and pa); and the same verbal affixes -in, -an, i- and -um-.

While the word ''Tagalista'' literally means \"one who specializes in Tagalog language or culture\" or a \"Tagalog specialist\", in the context of the debates on the national language and \"[[Imperial Manila]]\", the word ''Tagalista'' is used as a reference to \"people who promote or would promote the primacy of Tagalog at the expense of [the] other [Philippine] indigenous tongues\".<ref name=Tagalista>{{cite book|last=Martinez|first=David|title=A Country of Our Own: Partitioning the Philippines|page=202|publisher=Bisaya Books|year=2004|place=Los Angeles, California|isbn=9780976061304}}</ref>\n\n==Unicode==\n{{Main|Tagalog (Unicode block)}}\n\nTagalog-Numbers Unicode range: U+0000-U+007F U+1700\u2013U+171F\n\n{{Unicode chart Basic Latin}}\n{{Unicode chart Tagalog}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philippines|Language}}\n* [[Abakada alphabet]]\n* [[Philippine literature]]\n* [[Filipinology|Philippine studies]]\n* [[Filipino Sign Language]]\n* [[Filipino alphabet]]\n* [[Filipino orthography]]\n* [[Austronesian languages]]\n* [[Sa Aking Mga Kabata]]\n* [[Tagalog grammar]]\n* [[Tagalog phonology]]\n* [[Taglish]]\n* [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]]\n* [[Chavacano]]\n* [[List of loanwords in Tagalog]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{citation\n|date = 14 August 1991\n|title = Commission on the Filipino Language Act\n|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1991/ra_7104_1991.html\n|ref = {{harvid|Commission on the Filipino Language Act|1991}}\n}}\n* {{Citation\n|url=http://www.gov.ph/constitutions/1973-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-2/\n|title=1973 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines\n|work=Official Gazette|publisher=Government of the Philippines\n|ref={{harvid|Constitution of the Philippines|1973}}\n}}\n* {{Citation\n|url=http://www.gov.ph/constitutions/the-amended-1973-constitution-2/\n|title=The Amended 1973 Constitution\n|work=Official Gazette\n|publisher=Government of the Philippines\n|ref={{harvid|Amended Constitution of the Philippines|1976}}\n}}\n* {{Citation\n|date = 2 February 1987\n|title = Constitution of the Philippines\n|url = http://www.gov.ph/constitutions/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines/\n|ref = {{harvid|Constitution of the Philippines|1987}}\n}}\n* {{Citation\n| url = http://www.chanrobles.com/article14language.htm\n| title =The Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines\n| date = February 2, 1987\n| accessdate = 2017-02-12\n| publisher = Chanrobles Law Library\n|ref = {{harvid|1987 constitution art 14 sec 6-7}}\n}}\n* {{citation\n|author-last = Tabbada\n|author-first = Emil V.\n|editor-last = Gripaldo\n|editor-first = Rolando M.\n|editor2-last = McLean\n|editor2-first = George F.\n|year = 2005\n|work = Cultural Heritage and Contemporary Change\n|series = IIID, Southeast Asia\n|volume = 4\n|title = Filipino Cultural Traits: Claro R.
