His father was a ''Kommerzienrat'' (commerce councilor) and businessman who owned cork factories and other enterprises.<ref>H\u00f6hne, ''Der Fall Lissner'', p. 223.</ref> Before the First World War the family moved to Moscow. They were exiled in 1917 to the [[Volga]] region and returned to Moscow after the war. The political upheavals of the postwar period resulted in the family fleeing to [[Riga]] and then to Berlin, where Lissner attended high school. He studied languages, history, anthropology and law at [[Greifswald]], Berlin, [[G\u00f6ttingen]], [[Erlangen]], [[Lyon]] (1931\u20131932) and at the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris. He obtained his PhD in Foreign Trade Law in April 1936 in Erlangen.<ref>''Matrikel Verzeichnis der Studierenden der Univ. Erlangen; Universit\u00e4tsarchiv Erlangen'', in H\u00f6hne, ''Der Fall Lissner'', p. 225.</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nOn 1 April 1933 Lissner decided to take the bull by the horns and joined the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP).<ref>''Kurzbiografie Ivar Lissner f\u00fcr die Jahre 1933\u20131945'', published on https://ivar-lissner.de/Biografie, 2016. H\u00f6hne, ''Der Fall Lissner'', p. 225. His brother Percy joined the NSDAP at the same time.</ref> Only one year later Lissner claimed party membership since the beginning of 1932 and also pretended to be a member of the SS since the end of 1932. A lie to conceal his Jewish background and to prevent any doubts that he was not an \"Aryan\".\n\nIn 1935 he published his first book (''Blick nach Drau\u00dfen'', \"Looking Outside\") which was commercially unsuccessful but achieved the desired goal: creating a regime loyal fa\u00e7ade. By writing this book he was able to style himself as an \"ambassador\" of German \"values\".<ref>''Kurzbiografie Ivar Lissner f\u00fcr die Jahre 1933\u20131945'', published on https://ivar-lissner.de/Biografie/, 2016.</ref> One year later, in 1936, Ivar's father Robert Lissner was able to get hold of a forged [[Aryan certificate]] from the St. Peter's Church in Riga. It seems that this led to a more relaxed situation for the Lissner family. Ivar Lissner started a trip around the world on behalf of his publishing house \"Hanseatische Verlagsanstalt\" and visited the US, Canada, the Far and the Near East. His second (''V\u00f6lker und Kontinente'' (\"Peoples and Continents\") and third book (''Menschen und M\u00e4chte am Pazifik'' (\"People and Powers in the Pacific Region\"), published 1936 and 1937, became commercially successful and had the character of travel reports. Unusually for this period they largely abstain from any pro-National Socialist views.<ref>''Kurzbiografie Ivar Lissner f\u00fcr die Jahre 1933\u20131945'', published on https://ivar-lissner.de/Biografie/, 2016.</ref> Lissner wrote for the Hanseatic Service, the press service of his publisher, and some of his articles were \u2013 according to [[Heinz H\u00f6hne]] \u2013 also printed in ''[[Der Angriff]]''.\n \nWhen Lissner returned to Germany in January 1937 his father Robert was arrested by the [[Gestapo]]. They suspected him of being a Jew but were unable to prove it. So his father was released in poor health. Only after this episode Lissner, who \u2013 according to H\u00f6hne \u2013 never knew about his Jewish descent until the arrest of his father, began to distance himself from National Socialism, but maintained an anti-Soviet attitude as a result of his experiences in Russia.<ref>H\u00f6hne, ''Der Fall Lissner'', p. 229.</ref> This description of H\u00f6hne is contradicted by an article published on the Lissner website. According to this, Lissner always knew about his Jewish origins and never had a pro-National Socialist attitude.<ref>''\"Der angebliche \u201eSchulfreund\u201c Lissners: \"Hauptmann Werner Schulz\" Ein Konstrukt des Journalisten und Historikers Heinz H\u00f6hne?\"'', https://ivar-lissner.de/Projekt-Ivar-Lissner/</ref>\n\nIn 1938 he returned to Asia on behalf of Hanseatische Verlagsanstalt and the [[Abwehr]] (the German secret service). He reported on the Japanese fighting on the Korean-Soviet border, was interviewed by Japanese newspapers and provided information to the German ambassador. He also initiated contacts between the Japanese and German military intelligence, and during his stay in Manchuria in 1938 he acted as interpreter at the defection of the [[KGB]] chief for the Far East, [[Genrikh Lyushkov|Genrikh Samoilovich Lyushkov]]. He was given exclusive rights to publish the story in the press.<ref>H\u00f6hne, ''Der Fall Lissner'', p. 234.</ref> In 1939 he acted camouflaged as a correspondent for ''[[V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter]]'' and ''[[Der Angriff]]'' while in Japan. He also established contacts with the Propaganda Department and the German Embassy in Tokyo (historian H\u00f6hne describes him as an unofficial press attach\u00e9)<ref>H\u00f6hne, ''Der Fall Lissner'', p. 240.</ref> and was at that time a respected member of the Nazi-aligned German community in Tokyo. In September 1939 the Gestapo once again investigated the case of Lissner's father and arrested him, as they believed they now had reliable evidence. Lissner consequently lost his post in Tokyo and a proceeding was opened to exclude him from the NSDAP. Lissner urged the Abwehr to release his Jewish father from Gestapo prison. This task was managed by [[Karl Sack]] and [[Hans von Dohn\u00e1nyi]]. Three weeks after his arrest, Robert Lissner was released. In the coming months his wife Charlotte sold their whole furniture by auction. In mid 1940 Robert and Charlotte Lissner left Germany for Shanghai, where Percy Lissner worked for AEG. Lissner's sister Sigrid remained in Berlin despite the promise of the Abwehr that the whole Lissner family would be allowed to leave Germany. In 1941 she was murdered by the Gestapo.\n\nAmbassador [[Eugen Ott (ambassador)|Eugen Ott]] employed Lissner for four more months \"for reasons of expediency\" after he urged the German Foreign Office that this would be \"the only way to prevent Lissner from going over to the enemy\" (the Allied Forces). The German Embassy in Shanghai and the leader of the NSDAP in Japan (\"Landesgruppenleiter\") were continuously informed by Ott about the lawsuit against Lissner. Ott also tried to expatriate him because of his Jewish origins. This was the basis of the persecution of Lissner in Manchuria. It seems that Meisinger later circulated the false accusations of Lissner being a Soviet spy based on Ott's idea.<ref>''\"Der angebliche \"Schulfreund\" Lissners: \"Hauptmann Werner Schulz\" Ein Konstrukt des Journalisten und Historikers Heinz H\u00f6hne?\"'', https://ivar-lissner.de/Projekt-Ivar-Lissner/</ref><ref>''Kurzbiografie Ivar Lissner f\u00fcr die Jahre 1933\u20131945'', published on https://ivar-lissner.de/Biografie/, 2016.</ref>\n\n== Espionage ==\nIn the summer of 1940 \u2013 referring to H\u00f6hne \u2013 \"Werner Schulz\" recruited Lissner for the Abwehr after they promised to release his father from prison and let him move with his wife to Shanghai where his brother Percy was working for [[AEG]]. They also promised to restore his reputation in Tokyo.\n\nThis description of H\u00f6hne is wrong. An article published on the Lissner website concludes that \"Hauptmann Werner Schulz\" who \u2013 referring to Heinz H\u00f6hne \u2013 should be responsible for Lissner\u2019s recruitment into the Abwehr, is virtually certain a \"fictitious construction of Heinz H\u00f6hne\".<ref>''\"Der angebliche \"Schulfreund\" Lissners: \"Hauptmann Werner Schulz\" Ein Konstrukt des Journalisten und Historikers Heinz H\u00f6hne?\"'', https://ivar-lissner.de/Projekt-Ivar-Lissner/</ref> It seems that H\u00f6hne used \"Werner Schulz\" to impute Lissner with a pro-National Socialist attitude. According to the article Lissner was active in the [[German resistance to Nazism|German resistance movement]]. His agent controller, Captain Friedrich Busch, was a sincere anti-Nazi who saved several social democrats from concentration camp and who often shut his eyes to the fact that agents working for him were also working for the Allied intelligence services. In fact the sources mentioned in the article show that \"Hauptmann Schulz\"\u2019s biography is a combination of the biographies of two other Abwehr members, Dr. Julius Berthold Schultze and Gideon Richard Werner Sch\u00fcler. Indeed Lissner was recruited much earlier (in 1938) after the first arrest of his father. Lissner then travelled to East Asia camouflaged as a newspaper correspondent. Actually he never was a member of the \"Reichspressekammer\" (Reich Press Chamber). According to the article this fact was concealed by H\u00f6hne by the deletion of all relevant passages and contrary assurances of Ivar Lissner in his memoirs, and H\u00f6hne's own inadequate research.

In August 1941 Lissner was partly rehabilitated. His agent controller, Captain Friedrich Busch, sent a telegram that informed Lissner that his demands were fully granted. This was in fact untrue.

In this almost hopeless situation, Lissner's friend Werner Crome came to help. Crome used his contacts in Tokyo to get information concerning the case of [[Richard Sorge]]. In October 1941 Richard Sorge was arrested in Tokyo as a Soviet spy. He had maintained excellent relations in Nazi circles in Tokyo, including Ambassador Ott, who then tried to downplay the affair as a Japanese police intrigue. Also Josef Meisinger had failed.

His father was a ''Kommerzienrat'' (commerce councilor) and businessman who owned cork factories and other enterprises.<ref>H\u00f6hne, ''Der Fall Lissner'', p. 223.</ref> Before the First World War the family moved to Moscow. They were exiled in 1917 to the [[Volga]] region and returned to Moscow after the war. The political upheavals of the postwar period resulted in the family fleeing to [[Riga]] and then to Berlin, where Lissner attended high school. He studied languages, history, anthropology and law at [[Greifswald]], Berlin, [[G\u00f6ttingen]], [[Erlangen]], [[Lyon]] (1931\u20131932) and at the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris. He obtained his PhD in Foreign Trade Law in April 1936 in Erlangen.<ref>''Matrikel Verzeichnis der Studierenden der Univ. Erlangen; Universit\u00e4tsarchiv Erlangen'', in H\u00f6hne, ''Der Fall Lissner'', p. 225.</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nOn 1 April 1933 Lissner decided to take the bull by the horns and joined the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP).<ref>''Kurzbiografie Ivar Lissner f\u00fcr die Jahre 1933\u20131945'', published on https://ivar-lissner.de/Biografie, 2016. H\u00f6hne, ''Der Fall Lissner'', p. 225. His brother Percy joined the NSDAP at the same time.</ref> Only one year later Lissner claimed party membership since the beginning of 1932 and also pretended to be a member of the SS since the end of 1932. A lie to conceal his Jewish background and to prevent any doubts that he was not an \"Aryan\".\n\nIn 1935 he published his first book (''Blick nach Drau\u00dfen'', \"Looking Outside\") which was commercially unsuccessful but achieved the desired goal: creating a regime loyal fa\u00e7ade. By writing this book he was able to style himself as an \"ambassador\" of German \"values\".<ref>''Kurzbiografie Ivar Lissner f\u00fcr die Jahre 1933\u20131945'', published on https://ivar-lissner.de/Biografie/, 2016.</ref> One year later, in 1936, Ivar's father Robert Lissner was able to get hold of a forged [[Aryan certificate]] from the St. Peter's Church in Riga. It seems that this led to a more relaxed situation for the Lissner family. Ivar Lissner started a trip around the world on behalf of his publishing house \"Hanseatische Verlagsanstalt\" and visited the US, Canada, the Far and the Near East. His second (''V\u00f6lker und Kontinente'' (\"Peoples and Continents\") and third book (''Menschen und M\u00e4chte am Pazifik'' (\"People and Powers in the Pacific Region\"), published 1936 and 1937, became commercially successful and had the character of travel reports. Unusually for this period they largely abstain from any pro-National Socialist views.<ref>''Kurzbiografie Ivar Lissner f\u00fcr die Jahre 1933\u20131945'', published on https://ivar-lissner.de/Biografie/, 2016.</ref> Lissner wrote for the Hanseatic Service, the press service of his publisher, and some of his articles were \u2013 according to [[Heinz H\u00f6hne]] \u2013 also printed in ''[[Der Angriff]]''.\n \nWhen Lissner returned to Germany in January 1937 his father Robert was arrested by the [[Gestapo]]. They suspected him of being a Jew but were unable to prove it. So his father was released in poor health. Only after this episode Lissner, who \u2013 according to H\u00f6hne \u2013 never knew about his Jewish descent until the arrest of his father, began to distance himself from National Socialism, but maintained an anti-Soviet attitude as a result of his experiences in Russia.<ref>H\u00f6hne, ''Der Fall Lissner'', p. 229.</ref> This description of H\u00f6hne is contradicted by an article published on the Lissner website. According to this, Lissner always knew about his Jewish origins and never had a pro-National Socialist attitude.<ref>''\"Der angebliche \u201eSchulfreund\u201c Lissners: \"Hauptmann Werner Schulz\" Ein Konstrukt des Journalisten und Historikers Heinz H\u00f6hne?\"'', https://ivar-lissner.de/Projekt-Ivar-Lissner/</ref>\n\nIn 1938 he returned to Asia on behalf of Hanseatische Verlagsanstalt and the [[Abwehr]] (the German secret service). He reported on the Japanese fighting on the Korean-Soviet border, was interviewed by Japanese newspapers and provided information to the German ambassador. He also initiated contacts between the Japanese and German military intelligence, and during his stay in Manchuria in 1938 he acted as interpreter at the defection of the [[KGB]] chief for the Far East, [[Genrikh Lyushkov|Genrikh Samoilovich Lyushkov]]. He was given exclusive rights to publish the story in the press.<ref>H\u00f6hne, ''Der Fall Lissner'', p. 234.</ref> In 1939 he acted camouflaged as a correspondent for ''[[V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter]]'' and ''[[Der Angriff]]'' while in Japan. He also established contacts with the Propaganda Department and the German Embassy in Tokyo (historian H\u00f6hne describes him as an unofficial press attach\u00e9)<ref>H\u00f6hne, ''Der Fall Lissner'', p. 240.</ref> and was at that time a respected member of the Nazi-aligned German community in Tokyo. In September 1939 the Gestapo once again investigated the case of Lissner's father and arrested him, as they believed they now had reliable evidence. Lissner consequently lost his post in Tokyo and a proceeding was opened to exclude him from the NSDAP. Lissner urged the Abwehr to release his Jewish father from Gestapo prison. This task was managed by [[Karl Sack]] and [[Hans von Dohn\u00e1nyi]]. Three weeks after his arrest, Robert Lissner was released. In the coming months his wife Charlotte sold their whole furniture by auction. In mid 1940 Robert and Charlotte Lissner left Germany for Shanghai, where Percy Lissner worked for AEG. Lissner's sister Sigrid remained in Berlin despite the promise of the Abwehr that the whole Lissner family would be allowed to leave Germany. In 1941 she was murdered by the Gestapo.\n\nAmbassador [[Eugen Ott (ambassador)|Eugen Ott]] employed Lissner for four more months \"for reasons of expediency\" after he urged the German Foreign Office that this would be \"the only way to prevent Lissner from going over to the enemy\" (the Allied Forces). The German Embassy in Shanghai and the leader of the NSDAP in Japan (\"Landesgruppenleiter\") were continuously informed by Ott about the lawsuit against Lissner. Ott also tried to expatriate him because of his Jewish origins. This was the basis of the persecution of Lissner in Manchuria. It seems that Meisinger later circulated the false accusations of Lissner being a Soviet spy based on Ott's idea.<ref>''\"Der angebliche \"Schulfreund\" Lissners: \"Hauptmann Werner Schulz\" Ein Konstrukt des Journalisten und Historikers Heinz H\u00f6hne?\"'', https://ivar-lissner.de/Projekt-Ivar-Lissner/</ref><ref>''Kurzbiografie Ivar Lissner f\u00fcr die Jahre 1933\u20131945'', published on https://ivar-lissner.de/Biografie/, 2016.</ref>\n\n== Espionage ==\nIn the summer of 1940 \u2013 referring to H\u00f6hne \u2013 \"Werner Schulz\" recruited Lissner for the Abwehr after they promised to release his father from prison and let him move with his wife to Shanghai where his brother Percy was working for [[AEG]]. They also promised to restore his reputation in Tokyo.\n\nThis description of H\u00f6hne is wrong. An article published on the Lissner website concludes that \"Hauptmann Werner Schulz\" who \u2013 referring to Heinz H\u00f6hne \u2013 should be responsible for Lissner\u2019s recruitment into the Abwehr, is virtually certain a \"fictitious construction of Heinz H\u00f6hne\".<ref>''\"Der angebliche \"Schulfreund\" Lissners: \"Hauptmann Werner Schulz\" Ein Konstrukt des Journalisten und Historikers Heinz H\u00f6hne?\"'', https://ivar-lissner.de/Projekt-Ivar-Lissner/</ref> It seems that H\u00f6hne used \"Werner Schulz\" to impute Lissner with a pro-National Socialist attitude. According to the article Lissner was active in the [[German resistance to Nazism|German resistance movement]]. His agent controller, Captain Friedrich Busch, was a sincere anti-Nazi who saved several social democrats from concentration camp and who often shut his eyes to the fact that agents working for him were also working for the Allied intelligence services. In fact the sources mentioned in the article show that \"Hauptmann Schulz\"\u2019s biography is a combination of the biographies of two other Abwehr members, Dr. Julius Berthold Schultze and Gideon Richard Werner Sch\u00fcler. Indeed Lissner was recruited much earlier (in 1938) after the first arrest of his father. Lissner then travelled to East Asia camouflaged as a newspaper correspondent. Actually he never was a member of the \"Reichspressekammer\" (Reich Press Chamber). According to the article this fact was concealed by H\u00f6hne by the deletion of all relevant passages and contrary assurances of Ivar Lissner in his memoirs, and H\u00f6hne's own inadequate research. In addition H\u00f6hne misquoted a letter of Lissner to the British historian Deakin in his epilogue to the Lissner memoirs. He used this wrong quotation as a \"proof\" that Lissner had denied any connection with the \"VB\". Actually Lissner only denied having been a member of the \"Reichspressekammer\" \u2013 the prerequisite for working as a newspaper correspondent \u2013 and confirmed that he had pretended to work \"for those gangsters\" during a period of 33 days.\n\nWith the help of German merchants and Russian exiles in [[Harbin]], he built a spy network that reached as far as Siberia. In September 1940 Lissner was instructed by Admiral [[Wilhelm Canaris|Canaris]] to supply all information available to prevent an invasion of the Soviet Union. Canaris thought very highly of Lissner's work which provided him with detailed information about Soviet troops and commanders in the Far East. But despite the detailed information he received from Lissner, which showed the pointlessness of a war with the Soviet Union, he was unable to convince Hitler's headquarters.<ref>Ivar Lissner: ''Vergessen aber nicht vergeben'', Ullstein, 1970, p. 283</ref> By March 1943 Lissner's network was the only source of information in the Asian Soviet Union and the Manchurian region.<ref>Miron Rezun, ''The Soviet Union and Iran'', 1981, p. 361.</ref><ref>H\u00f6hne, ''Krieg im Dunkel'', p. 435.</ref>\n \nAfter the murder of his sister in Germany, Lissner urged the [[Abwehr]] to get an official decision that he and his family in Shanghai were equal to German citizens.

It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward in monochrome and re-coloured by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} In August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}} \n\nAccording to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time at Haddon composing songs on piano rather than acoustic guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} Biographer [[Marc Spitz]] notes that a piano could not fit in his Plaistow Grove bedroom, nor was it suitable for playing in clubs or bus tours with his previous groups. Haddon Hall, however, gave him more of a sense of comfort and permanence, something he had not felt before when composing.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} Here he composed over three dozen songs, many of which would end up on ''Hunky Dory'' and its follow-up ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Two of these were \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971,{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}} and subsequently re-recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}} The first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him. Also known as 'Zowie', Bowie would tell David Wigg in 1973: \"I got the name [Zowie] from a [[Batman]] comic.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} On 3 June, Bowie and the Spiders, along with traveled to the BBC's Paris Studios in London to record for [[John Peel]]'s radio show ''In Concert''. They were joined by [[Dana Gillespie]], Mark Pritchett, Geoffrey MacCormack (better known as [[Warren Peace]]) and George Underwood.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} The songs they performed were all originals written by Bowie, apart from a cover of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Almost Grown (song)|Almost Grown]]\" and [[Ron Davies (songwriter)|Ron Davies]]' \"It Ain't Easy\",{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}} which was to be recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust'' a year later.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} The performance began with \"[[Queen Bitch]]\" and \"[[Bombers (David Bowie song)|Bombers]]\", which Peel says will both be on the upcoming album, although \"Bombers\" was to replaced by the cover \"Fill Your Heart\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} They also played \"[[The Supermen]]\" from ''The Man Who Sold the World'', \"Looking for a Friend\" (which was sung by Pritchett), \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\" (which was sung by Underwood) and \"Andy Warhol\" (which was sung by Gillespie).{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} Although Bowie's backing trio were referred to as \"members of a group called Ronno\", the session would become the first performance with the trio who would become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] and who would record with him for the next three years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}}<ref name=\"Gallucci UCR\" /> \n\n{{quote box|quote=[''Hunky Dory''] is very much a duo record.

He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at Haddon Hall, where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} The piano Wakeman played on the album was an 1898 [[C. Bechstein|Bechstein]] that was the same one used for the Beatles' 1968 song \"[[Hey Jude]]\" and many of [[Elton John]] and [[Harry Nilsson]]'s early records, and would later be used by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] for \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} According to Wakeman, the sessions initially had a rough start, due to the band not learning the songs. He recalled in the Radio 2 documentary ''Golden Years'' and his autobiography ''Say Yes!'' that Bowie had to halt the sessions, telling the musicians off and to come back when they knew the music. Upon returning after a week, Wakeman said: \"the band were hot! They were so good, and the tracks just flowed through.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} However, this account has been disputed by other band members, including Bolder, who told Kevin Cann: \"[That's] rubbish. David would never have told the band off in the studio. Especially as Mick and Woody had already left him once, and everyone was now getting on. The band would not have survived that \u2013 it definitely didn't happen.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} Similarly, Scott said: \"I definitely don't remember that, and it's not something I would forget. I would definitely dispute that one.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}}\n\nWith Wakeman on the line-up, Bowie and the Spiders recorded reconvened at Trident on 9 July and recorded two takes of \"Bombers\" and \"It Ain't Easy\", the latter featuring backing vocals by Dana Gillespie.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} According to Cann, five days later on 14 July, Defries sent a letter to jazz pianist [[Dudley Moore]] asking him to play piano during a session. There is no known record of Moore responding and although the specific song Defries was asking him to play on is unknown, Cann deduces that it was most likely \"Life on Mars?\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} During this day, the group recorded four takes of \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\", the final take appeared on the finished album.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=223\u2013224}} On 18 July, the group spent the day rehearsing and mixing. During the session, Bowie was introduced by Grace to a band known as Chameleon. He gave them his future ''Ziggy Stardust'' track \"[[Star (David Bowie song)|Star]]\", which they recorded their own unreleased version of.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=224}} On 26 July, a seven-hour mixing session took place in order to compile a promotional album for Gem Productions. At this point, the songs \"Oh! You Pretty Things\", \"Eight Line Poem\", \"Kooks\", \"Queen Bitch\" and \"Andy Warhol\" were recorded, although the mixes of \"Eight Line Poem\" and \"Kooks\" on the promotional album were different than the final mixes on ''Hunky Dory''.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=224\u2013225}} Two takes of \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\" were recorded on 30 July, the second take appearing on the final album. It was recorded on a tape that contained rejected versions of \"Song for Bob Dylan\" and \"Fill Your Heart\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=225}} On 6 August, the band recorded \"Life on Mars?\" and \"Song for Bob Dylan\", after which the album recording is deemed complete. Ronson guided the recording of \"Life on Mars?\", counting in each take and overdubbed his guitar, strings, Mellotron and Bowie's vocal.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=225}} Cann does not have a recording date for \"Changes\",{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=219\u2013225}} but Doggett writes that it was recorded sometime between June and July.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}}\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n[[File:Rickwakemanmoog.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Rick Wakeman performing in 2012|The album features piano by keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] ''(pictured in 2012)'', whose playing greatly influenced the songs.]]\nAuthor [[Peter Doggett]] describes ''Hunky Dory'' as \"a collective of attractively accessible pop songs, through which Bowie tested out his feelings about the nature of stardom and power.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=11}} Musical biographer David Buckley said of the album: \"Its almost easy-listening status and conventional musical sensibility has detracted from the fact that, lyrically, this record lays down the blueprint for Bowie's future career.\"<ref name=buckstrange1>{{cite book |title=Strange Fascination \u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story |last=Buckley |first=David |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=London |isbn=0-7535-0457-X |page=112}}</ref> Spitz describes it as a piano-driven record and because of this, it offers more of an inviting and warmer feel, especially when compared to ''Space Oddity'' and ''The Man Who Sold the World''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} The opening track, \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\", focused on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me/Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\"). However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''The Man Who Sold the World'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''Space Oddity'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\". Between the two extremes was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\n== Title and artwork ==\nAlthough Bowie generally left naming his albums until last minute, the title, 'Hunky Dory', was announced at the John Peel session.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} It was suggested by Bob Grace of Chrysalis, who got the idea from an [[Esher]] pub landlord and formerly of the [[Royal Air Force]]. He told Peter and Leni Gillman, the authors of ''Alias David Bowie'', that the landlord had an unusual vocabulary that was \"peppered with upper-crust jargon\", using words such as 'prang' and 'whizzo', and phrases such as 'everything's hunky-dory'. Grace told Bowie and he loved it.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=606\u2013607}} Pegg notes that there was a song from 1957 by the American doo-wop band the Guytones also titled \"Hunky Dory\" that may have played a part as well.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} Spitz notes that 'hunky-dory' is an English slang term that means everything is right in the world.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} The album's sleeve would bear the credit \"Produced by Ken Scott (assisted by the actor)\". The \"actor\" was Bowie himself, whose \"pet conceit\", in the words of ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]], was \"to think of himself as an actor\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=7\u201311}}\n\nThe cover artwork was taken by photographer Brian Ward at his [[Heddon Street]] studio,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=610\u2013611}} who was introduced to Bowie by Grace. One idea was for Bowie to dress as an Egyptian Pharoah, partly inspired by the British media's infatuation with the [[British Museum]]'s new [[Tutankhamun]] exhibit.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Photos of Bowie posing as a sphinx and in a lotus position were taken \u2013 one of them was released as part of the 1990 ''Space Oddity'' reissue \u2013 but the idea was ultimately not chosen. Bowie later recalled: \"We didn't run with it, as they say. Probably a good idea.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Rather than something extravagant, Bowie opted for a more minimalist image reflecting the album's \"preoccupation with the silver screen.\" Bowie later said: \"I was into Oxford bags, and there are a pair, indeed, on the back of the album. [I was attempting] what I presumed was kind of an [[Evelyn Waugh]] Oxbridge look.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} The final image is a close-up of Bowie looking up into space as he pushes his hair back from his forehead. Originally shot in monochrome, the image was re-coloured by illustrator Terry Pastor, who recently set up the Main Artery design studio in [[Covent Garden]] with George Underwood; Pastor would later design the cover and sleeve for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Pegg writes: \"Bowie's decision to use a re-coloured photo suggests a hand-tinted lobby-card from the days of the silent cinema and, simultaneously, Warhol's famous ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'' screen-prints.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Robert Dimery, in his book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]'', also notes the influenced of Warhol's ''Dietrich'' prints and writes that Bowie took a photo book that contained multiple ''Dietrich'' prints with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must

It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward in monochrome and re-coloured by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} According to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time at Haddon composing songs on piano rather than acoustic guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} Biographer [[Marc Spitz]] notes that a piano could not fit in his Plaistow Grove bedroom, nor was it suitable for playing in clubs or bus tours with his previous groups. Haddon Hall, however, gave him more of a sense of comfort and permanence, something he had not felt before when composing.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} Here he composed over three dozen songs, many of which would end up on ''Hunky Dory'' and its follow-up ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Two of these were \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971,{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}} and subsequently re-recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}\n\nIn August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}} \n\nThe first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him. Also known as 'Zowie', Bowie would tell David Wigg in 1973: \"I got the name [Zowie] from a [[Batman]] comic.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} On 3 June, Bowie and the Spiders, along with traveled to the BBC's Paris Studios in London to record for [[John Peel]]'s radio show ''In Concert''. They were joined by [[Dana Gillespie]], Mark Pritchett, Geoffrey MacCormack (better known as [[Warren Peace]]) and George Underwood.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} The songs they performed were all originals written by Bowie, apart from a cover of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Almost Grown (song)|Almost Grown]]\" and [[Ron Davies (songwriter)|Ron Davies]]' \"It Ain't Easy\",{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}} which was to be recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust'' a year later.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} The performance began with \"[[Queen Bitch]]\" and \"[[Bombers (David Bowie song)|Bombers]]\", which Peel says will both be on the upcoming album, although \"Bombers\" was to replaced by the cover \"Fill Your Heart\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} They also played \"[[The Supermen]]\" from ''The Man Who Sold the World'', \"Looking for a Friend\" (which was sung by Pritchett), \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\" (which was sung by Underwood) and \"Andy Warhol\" (which was sung by Gillespie).{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} Although Bowie's backing trio were referred to as \"members of a group called Ronno\", the session would become the first performance with the trio who would become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] and who would record with him for the next three years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}}<ref name=\"Gallucci UCR\" /> \n\n{{quote box|quote=[''Hunky Dory''] is very much a duo record.

He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at Haddon Hall, where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} The piano Wakeman played on the album was an 1898 [[C. Bechstein|Bechstein]] that was the same one used for the Beatles' 1968 song \"[[Hey Jude]]\" and many of [[Elton John]] and [[Harry Nilsson]]'s early records, and would later be used by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] for \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} According to Wakeman, the sessions initially had a rough start, due to the band not learning the songs. He recalled in the Radio 2 documentary ''Golden Years'' and his autobiography ''Say Yes!'' that Bowie had to halt the sessions, telling the musicians off and to come back when they knew the music. Upon returning after a week, Wakeman said: \"the band were hot! They were so good, and the tracks just flowed through.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} However, this account has been disputed by other band members, including Bolder, who told Kevin Cann: \"[That's] rubbish. David would never have told the band off in the studio. Especially as Mick and Woody had already left him once, and everyone was now getting on. The band would not have survived that \u2013 it definitely didn't happen.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} Similarly, Scott said: \"I definitely don't remember that, and it's not something I would forget. I would definitely dispute that one.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}}\n\nWith Wakeman on the line-up, Bowie and the Spiders recorded reconvened at Trident on 9 July and recorded two takes of \"Bombers\" and \"It Ain't Easy\", the latter featuring backing vocals by Dana Gillespie.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} According to Cann, five days later on 14 July, Defries sent a letter to jazz pianist [[Dudley Moore]] asking him to play piano during a session. There is no known record of Moore responding and although the specific song Defries was asking him to play on is unknown, Cann deduces that it was most likely \"Life on Mars?\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} During this day, the group recorded four takes of \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\", the final take appeared on the finished album.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=223\u2013224}} On 18 July, the group spent the day rehearsing and mixing. During the session, Bowie was introduced by Grace to a band known as Chameleon. He gave them his future ''Ziggy Stardust'' track \"[[Star (David Bowie song)|Star]]\", which they recorded their own unreleased version of.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=224}} On 26 July, a seven-hour mixing session took place in order to compile a promotional album for Gem Productions. At this point, the songs \"Oh! You Pretty Things\", \"Eight Line Poem\", \"Kooks\", \"Queen Bitch\" and \"Andy Warhol\" were recorded, although the mixes of \"Eight Line Poem\" and \"Kooks\" on the promotional album were different than the final mixes on ''Hunky Dory''.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=224\u2013225}} Two takes of \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\" were recorded on 30 July, the second take appearing on the final album. It was recorded on a tape that contained rejected versions of \"Song for Bob Dylan\" and \"Fill Your Heart\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=225}} On 6 August, the band recorded \"Life on Mars?\" and \"Song for Bob Dylan\", after which the album recording is deemed complete. Ronson guided the recording of \"Life on Mars?\", counting in each take and overdubbed his guitar, strings, Mellotron and Bowie's vocal.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=225}} Cann does not have a recording date for \"Changes\",{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=219\u2013225}} but Doggett writes that it was recorded sometime between June and July.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}}\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n[[File:Rickwakemanmoog.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Rick Wakeman performing in 2012|The album features piano by keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] ''(pictured in 2012)'', whose playing greatly influenced the songs.]]\nAuthor [[Peter Doggett]] describes ''Hunky Dory'' as \"a collective of attractively accessible pop songs, through which Bowie tested out his feelings about the nature of stardom and power.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=11}} Musical biographer David Buckley said of the album: \"Its almost easy-listening status and conventional musical sensibility has detracted from the fact that, lyrically, this record lays down the blueprint for Bowie's future career.\"<ref name=buckstrange1>{{cite book |title=Strange Fascination \u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story |last=Buckley |first=David |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=London |isbn=0-7535-0457-X |page=112}}</ref> Spitz describes it as a piano-driven record and because of this, it offers more of an inviting and warmer feel, especially when compared to ''Space Oddity'' and ''The Man Who Sold the World''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} The opening track, \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\", focused on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me/Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\"). However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''The Man Who Sold the World'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''Space Oddity'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\". Between the two extremes was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\n== Title and artwork ==\nAlthough Bowie generally left naming his albums until last minute, the title, 'Hunky Dory', was announced at the John Peel session.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} It was suggested by Bob Grace of Chrysalis, who got the idea from an [[Esher]] pub landlord and formerly of the [[Royal Air Force]]. He told Peter and Leni Gillman, the authors of ''Alias David Bowie'', that the landlord had an unusual vocabulary that was \"peppered with upper-crust jargon\", using words such as 'prang' and 'whizzo', and phrases such as 'everything's hunky-dory'. Grace told Bowie and he loved it.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=606\u2013607}} Pegg notes that there was a song from 1957 by the American doo-wop band the Guytones also titled \"Hunky Dory\" that may have played a part as well.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} Spitz notes that 'hunky-dory' is an English slang term that means everything is right in the world.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} The album's sleeve would bear the credit \"Produced by Ken Scott (assisted by the actor)\". The \"actor\" was Bowie himself, whose \"pet conceit\", in the words of ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]], was \"to think of himself as an actor\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=7\u201311}}\n\nThe cover artwork was taken by photographer Brian Ward at his [[Heddon Street]] studio,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=610\u2013611}} who was introduced to Bowie by Grace. One idea was for Bowie to dress as an Egyptian Pharoah, partly inspired by the British media's infatuation with the [[British Museum]]'s new [[Tutankhamun]] exhibit.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Photos of Bowie posing as a sphinx and in a lotus position were taken \u2013 one of them was released as part of the 1990 ''Space Oddity'' reissue \u2013 but the idea was ultimately not chosen. Bowie later recalled: \"We didn't run with it, as they say. Probably a good idea.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Rather than something extravagant, Bowie opted for a more minimalist image reflecting the album's \"preoccupation with the silver screen.\" Bowie later said: \"I was into Oxford bags, and there are a pair, indeed, on the back of the album. [I was attempting] what I presumed was kind of an [[Evelyn Waugh]] Oxbridge look.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} The final image is a close-up of Bowie looking up into space as he pushes his hair back from his forehead. Originally shot in monochrome, the image was re-coloured by illustrator Terry Pastor, who recently set up the Main Artery design studio in [[Covent Garden]] with George Underwood; Pastor would later design the cover and sleeve for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Pegg writes: \"Bowie's decision to use a re-coloured photo suggests a hand-tinted lobby-card from the days of the silent cinema and, simultaneously, Warhol's famous ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'' screen-prints.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Robert Dimery, in his book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]'', also notes the influenced of Warhol's ''Dietrich'' prints and writes that Bowie took a photo book that contained multiple ''Dietrich'' prints with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must

''[[Gadaria]]'' is another word that may have the same origin. In the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra region]] of western Gujarat they exist as two [[endogamy|endogamous]] groups, known as the Mota Bhai (Motabhai) and the Nana Bhai (Nanabhai). According to the [[Anthropological Survey of India]]'s ''People of India'' series, Bharwads in the Saurashtra region often append ''[[Ahir]]'' to their names, while in south Gujarat it is common to see ''[[Patel]]'' appended.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n== Origin ==\nThe Bharwads consider themselves to be descended from the mythological [[Nandvanshi]] line that began with [[Nanda (mythology)|Nanda]], the foster-father of [[Krishna]]. Legend has it that Nanda came from [[Gokul]], in [[Mathura district]], and passed through Saurashtra on his way to [[Dwarka]].{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}} According to their traditions, the Bharwads were at some time based around [[Mathura]] and migrated to [[Mewar]] before later spreading out in Gujarat.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} Sudipta Mitra considers their move to Gujarat to have been predicated by a desire to keep away from the [[Muslim]] invasion of [[Sind]]. They arrived in the northern town of [[Banaskantha]] in 961 CE and later spread out to Saurashtra and other areas.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}}\n\nThere are other theories of origin. These include that they are an offshoot of the [[Bharude]] cattle-herders of [[Madhya Pradesh]] and that they are descendants of Anavil Bharwad, who helped a [[Chavda]] prince regain his kingdom. It is also possible that they are related to the Ahirs of Gujarat, with whom they share a common traditional occupation.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n== Divisions ==\nOf the various reasons given for the division between Motabhai and Nanabhai, the most popular is that two shepherd brothers were ordered by [[Krishna]] to take their flocks to different places. The older of the brothers went on to marry a Bharwad woman while the other married a [[Koli people|Koli]]. Since the latter was a marriage outside the community, the offspring were deemed to be [[untouchability|ritually polluted]]. Thus the Motabhai (literally, \"big brother\") descend from the first and the Nanabhai (\"little brother\") from the latter.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=147|ps=}}\n\nThe Bharwads have numerous subgroups known as ''ataks'' or ''guls'' (clans) whose main purpose is to determine eligibility for marriage. A constrained [[exogamy]] is practised between clans{{efn|For example, the Rathadia, Jadav and Yadav clans of the Mota Bhai consider that they are socially superior to the other clans and will only marry between themselves.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}}} but endogamy exists between the two Saurashtrian divisions despite there being no other social constraints on mixing. The Saurashtra Bharwads also hold a higher status than those in the south and thus marriage between the two regional groups operates in one direction only: daughters of southern Bharwads can marry into the family of those from Saurashtra.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY FURTHER CLANS HERE UNLESS THEY ARE SOURCED-->\nClans of the Mota Bhai Bharwads include the Babha, Bathela, Colthar, Dabi, Dhangia, Dharangia, Garia, Gomara, Jadav, Kathodi, Ker, Lambari, Matia, Mundhva, Pancha, Rathadia, Sania, Sasda, Tota and Yadav.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nAmong the Bharwad of south Gujarat, their main clans are the Chandulka, Dahika, Gundarya, Jodika, Kalwamia, Khohadya, Kuhadiya and Rokadka.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY FURTHER CLANS HERE UNLESS THEY ARE SOURCED-->\n\n== Varna and socio-economic status ==\nThe [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]] system of Hinduism is a traditional ritual ranking system based on levels of purported religious purity. Within this four-fold scheme, the Bharwads consider themselves to be [[Vaishya]] but they also believe themselves to be equal to [[Rajput]] communities that are generally considered to be of the more pure [[Kshatriya]] varna. They also believe themselves to be of a higher ritual status than [[artisan]] groups such as the [[Lohar]]s and [[Suthar]]s.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nDespite their own beliefs, the Bharwads are generally treated within regional society as being somewhat below the [[Brahmin]], [[Bania (caste)|Vania]], [[Lohana]], Patel, [[Charan]] and [[Dharjee]] communities.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} Mitra notes that they are generally considered to be among the lowest of the pastoral castes, being engaged primarily in the herding of goats and sheep.{{efn|Some Bharwads are cattle-herders but their number is declining.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}}}} However, although one of the [[Maldhari]] nomadic communities, they are also among the most urbanised of the region and, combined with their niche position in the supply of milk, which forms their main source of income, this has enabled them to improve their traditional social position.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|pp=65, 84|ps=}}\n\n== Customs ==\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe Bharwad are Hindu, and like other Hindu pastoral communities pay special reverence to Krishna. Each clan also has its own deity, while their chief goddess is Masai Mata. Their most sacred place is at [[Morvi]] and they also make pilgrimages to place such as Dwarka. Some Bharwads in the south have become [[vegetarian]] as a consequence of outside influences.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n=== Family arrangements ===\nMembers of the community practice [[monogamy]] and [[arranged marriage]]s are traditional, usually accompanied by a ritualised exchange of gifts between the partners.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} There is anecdotal evidence that ''pet chandla'' (marriage of children while they are still in the womb) is practised by some members of the community.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=272|ps=}} In other cases, a ''sagai'' (engagement) ceremony takes place when children are aged 2\u20133, with the marriage age usually being between 18-20 for women and 20-22 for men.{{efn|Marriages of six-year-olds have been recorded but most do not marry so young.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|pp=155, 253|ps=}}}} Remarriage in situations where the couple are childless requires the consent of the wife, and divorce is not usually tolerated except in this situation and that of mental infirmity. Remarriage upon widowhood is also accepted but men are expected generally to prefer a younger unmarried sister of their late wife.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nMarried couples live in a [[patrilocal]] arrangement. The Bharwads practice male [[equigeniture]], meaning that property is inherited equally by the male children, and it is the eldest son who becomes head of household on the death of the father. Women have no rights of inheritance over property. Although consulted, they also have no final say in the making of significant decisions.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n=== Clothing ===\nThe Bharwads practice \"sartorial conservatism\", according to Emma Tarlo, and it is not enough to be born a Bharwad if a person wants to be accepted as one: conforming with standards of dress and other customs is a necessity if a person is not to be considered a deserter from the community.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|pp=258, 262-263|ps=}} The details of clothing&nbsp;\u2014 in terms of style, colour and material&nbsp;\u2014 have changed over time while retaining a distinct Bharwad character. Despite it being a relatively recent practice, the wearing of pink and red shawls by both women and men is one of the most obvious identifiers of the modern community and they are worn even by those who shun the other aspects of the Bharwadi dress code in favour of Western styles.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=271-272|ps=}} The desire to identify through clothing and also through [[tattoo]]s may be a reflection of the community's traditional itinerant lifestyle, whereby a means of recognising their fellows was a significant social factor.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=273|ps=}}\n\nThe clothing worn by Bharwad women was traditionally made from coarse wool woven by members of local [[Untouchability|untouchable]] communities. In addition, they embroidered their own open-backed [[bodice]]s. The garments at that time&nbsp;\u2014 as late as the early 20th century&nbsp;\u2014 comprised the bodice, an unstitched black or red waist-cloth, known as a ''jimi'', and a veil. Motabhai clothing was made from thicker wool than that of the Nanabhai, leading to the two groups referring to themselves as \"thick cloth\" and \"thin cloth\". The veil was dyed black and bore red dots if the woman was a Motabhai and yellow if she was Nanabhai. While the styles and colours remain similar, modern Bharwad women use [[man-made fibre]]s, such as [[polyester]], and cotton. This change may be in part because the modern materials are of finer texture but it is more likely than it came about because of their relative cheapness. Cost is an important factor among the generally penurious community and women could sell the woollen fabric that they had used for clothing for a greater price than they paid for the replacement man-made fabric clothes.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|pp=xiii, 147, 267|ps=}} Tarlo quotes a Bharwad woman saying that \"If you wear a sari then you can no longer be called a Bharwad. That is the way it is among our caste. Better to die than change your clothes.\"{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=257|ps=}}\n\nThe men commonly wear a silver ear-ring, called a ''variya'', and a [[pagri (turban)]]. The length of the turban differs between the two divisions,{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} and there are numerous ways of tying them. A white turban, rather than the more usual pink or red, is a symbol of seniority.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=271|ps=}} Wearing Western-style clothing is still not generally accepted but the traditional three woollen blankets, worn around the head, waist and shoulders, have in many cases been replaced by a cotton ''[[kediyun]]'' together with a ''[[dhoti]]'' or ''[[chorni]]''.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=151|ps=}} As with the women, Carol Henderson notes that {{quote|[Bharwads] say that if a man doesn't wear their dress, he ceases to be Bharwad. Being Bharwad means dressing Bharwad. Bharwad men wear a distinctive short gathered smock with long, tight sleeves, massive wound turban, gathered pantaloons, and a shawl.{{sfnp|Henderson|2002|p=113|ps=}}}}\n\n== Occupations ==\n[[Image:Map Guj Gir NatPark Sanctuary.png|thumb|right|Many of the Bharwad community are found in the [[Gir Forest National Park]].]]\nBharwads are rarely educated beyond primary level and literacy rates are poor. Many of them live in and around the [[Gir Forest National Park]], where they tend to keep away from the forest itself when grazing their livestock due to the danger of attacks by [[Asiatic lion]]s. Aside from their involvement with livestock, the main source of income is agricultural labouring; few of them own land.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|pp=65, 84|ps=}}\n\n== Community associations ==\nThere is a hierarchy of ''nyat [[panchayat]]s'' (community councils) for the resolution of disputes. These are headed by chiefs and comprise several other members. The lowest tier of this are those that operate at the level of a single village or of a group of villages if the Bharwad population is small. Matters that cannot be settled at that level are referred upwards to a regional ''panchayat'' and thereafter to a central body based at [[Rajkot]]. If matters are still not resolved after referral to Rajkot then the parties will seek intervention form law enforcement agencies, although this is rare.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nThere also exists a community welfare association called the Gujarat Rajya Gopalak Sakahari Sangh, which was formed in 1950 at [[Ahmedabad]]. This has worked to document the history and traditions of the Bhardwads and has also established several hundred co-operative societies. In addition, it has worked to bring an end to some traditional social practices that are now deemed to be inappropriate, such as [[bride price]].{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Dhangar]]\n* [[Rabari]]\n\n== References ==\n'''Notes'''\n\nBbbiikbv\n\n'''Citations3'''\n\nHhhjj\n\n'''Bibliographyhhhhjj'''\n[[Category:Tribal communities of Gujarat]]\n[[Category:Maldhari communities]]\n[[Category:Tribes of Kutch]]\n[[Category:Herding castes]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Hindu caste found in the state of Gujarat in India}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Member of the Bharwad community of India.jpg|thumb|Member of the Bharwad community of India]]\nThe '''Bharwad''' are a [[Hindu]] YADAV [[caste]] found in the state of [[Gujarat]] in India.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=1nVCAAAAYAAJ&q=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A1+%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BF&dq=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A1+%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BF | title=Vanyaj\u0101ti, \u092d\u093e\u0917 16,\u0938\u092e\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e 2 | year=1968 | publisher=Bharatiya Adimjati Sevak Sangh., 1968| accessdate=23 Apr 2009| page=79}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Bharwad name may derive from the [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] word ''bharawad'', constructed from ''bhara'' (sheep) and ''wad'' (a compound or enclosure).

This change may be in part because the modern materials are of finer texture but it is more likely than it came about because of their relative cheapness. Cost is an important factor among the generally penurious community and women could sell the woollen fabric that they had used for clothing for a greater price than they paid for the replacement man-made fabric clothes.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|pp=xiii, 147, 267|ps=}} Tarlo quotes a Bharwad woman saying that \"If you wear a sari then you can no longer be called a Bharwad. That is the way it is among our caste. Better to die than change your clothes.\"{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=257|ps=}}\n\nThe men commonly wear a silver ear-ring, called a ''variya'', and a [[pagri (turban)]]. The length of the turban differs between the two divisions,{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} and there are numerous ways of tying them. A white turban, rather than the more usual pink or red, is a symbol of seniority.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=271|ps=}} Wearing Western-style clothing is still not generally accepted but the traditional three woollen blankets, worn around the head, waist and shoulders, have in many cases been replaced by a cotton ''[[kediyun]]'' together with a ''[[dhoti]]'' or ''[[chorni]]''.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=151|ps=}} As with the women, Carol Henderson notes that {{quote|[Bharwads] say that if a man doesn't wear their dress, he ceases to be Bharwad. Being Bharwad means dressing Bharwad. Bharwad men wear a distinctive short gathered smock with long, tight sleeves, massive wound turban, gathered pantaloons, and a shawl.{{sfnp|Henderson|2002|p=113|ps=}}}}\n\n== Occupations ==\n[[Image:Map Guj Gir NatPark Sanctuary.png|thumb|right|Many of the Bharwad community are found in the [[Gir Forest National Park]].]]\nBharwads are rarely educated beyond primary level and literacy rates are poor. Many of them live in and around the [[Gir Forest National Park]], where they tend to keep away from the forest itself when grazing their livestock due to the danger of attacks by [[Asiatic lion]]s. Aside from their involvement with livestock, the main source of income is agricultural labouring; few of them own land.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|pp=65, 84|ps=}}\n\n== Community associations ==\nThere is a hierarchy of ''nyat [[panchayat]]s'' (community councils) for the resolution of disputes. These are headed by chiefs and comprise several other members. The lowest tier of this are those that operate at the level of a single village or of a group of villages if the Bharwad population is small. Matters that cannot be settled at that level are referred upwards to a regional ''panchayat'' and thereafter to a central body based at [[Rajkot]]. If matters are still not resolved after referral to Rajkot then the parties will seek intervention form law enforcement agencies, although this is rare.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nThere also exists a community welfare association called the Gujarat Rajya Gopalak Sakahari Sangh, which was formed in 1950 at [[Ahmedabad]]. This has worked to document the history and traditions of the Bhardwads and has also established several hundred co-operative societies. In addition, it has worked to bring an end to some traditional social practices that are now deemed to be inappropriate, such as [[bride price]].{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Dhangar]]\n* [[Rabari]]\n\n== References ==\n'''Notes'''\n{{notelist}}\n'''Citations'''\n{{reflist}}\n'''Bibliography'''\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{citation |title=Culture and Customs of India |first=Carol E. |last=Henderson |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2002 |isbn=9780313305139 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CaRVePXX6vEC}}\n*{{citation |title=People of India Gujarat Volume XXI Part One |editor1-first=Rajendra Behari |editor1-last=Lal |editor2-first=P.

The school teaches grades 9 through 12. Students from [[Van Wyck Junior High School|Van Wyck]] who have successfully completed the 8th grade continue to the 9th grade at John Jay. The school is a part of the Wappingers Central School District.<ref>Wappingers Central School District, http://www.wappingersschools.org/</ref>\n\n==History==\nJohn Jay was built in 1968 to accommodate the growth of the Wappingers School District. Prior to its construction, Ketcham High School was the district's only high school, {{convert|8|miles}} away in [[Wappingers Falls]]. The 1973 graduating class was the first class to have completed four full years at John Jay HS. Growth in Southern [[Dutchess County, New York]] has resulted in a number of classes having more than 25 students in them, although there has been a recent{{when|date=December 2016}} rise in classes with less than 15 students. John Jay's current principal is David Kedzielawa. Paul Albanese, Eleanore Dicioccio, and Ken Lewis are John Jay's current administrators.<ref>https://www.wappingersschools.org/domain/2124</ref>\n\nIn 2002, a new biology-chemistry wing was opened for the exclusive use of these laboratory courses. In 2009, a new math wing was opened on the first floor. The school is geographically surrounded by [[IBM]] East Fishkill. The presence of IBM in the area has fueled and helped to fund a model example of a high school engineering focus. John Jay offers many classes focused on engineering, with some classes utilizing college-level computer programs and mathematics.

The school teaches grades 9 through 12. Students from [[Van Wyck Junior High School|Van Wyck]] who have successfully completed the 8th grade continue to the 9th grade at John Jay. The school is a part of the Wappingers Central School District.<ref>Wappingers Central School District, http://www.wappingersschools.org/</ref>\n\n==History==\nJohn Jay was built in 1968 to accommodate the growth of the Wappingers School District. Prior to its construction, Ketcham High School was the district's only high school, {{convert|8|miles}} away in [[Wappingers Falls]]. The 1973 graduating class was the first class to have completed four full years at John Jay HS. Growth in Southern [[Dutchess County, New York]] has resulted in a number of classes having more than 25 students in them, although there has been a recent{{when|date=December 2016}} rise in classes with less than 15 students. John Jay's current principal is David Kedzielawa. Paul Albanese, Eleanore Dicioccio, and Ken Lewis are John Jay's current administrators.<ref>https://www.wappingersschools.org/domain/2124</ref>\n\nIn 2002, a new biology-chemistry wing was opened for the exclusive use of these laboratory courses. In 2009, a new math wing was opened on the first floor. The school is geographically surrounded by [[IBM]] East Fishkill. The presence of IBM in the area has fueled and helped to fund a model example of a high school engineering focus. John Jay offers many classes focused on engineering, with some classes utilizing college-level computer programs and mathematics. Some of the classes are eligible for college credit through the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]].  The school added an addition in recent years extending, from the Math to the English wings and adding four new classrooms to the building.<ref>John Jay Construction Page, {{cite web|url=http://www.wappingersschools.org/johnjayhs/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303223703/http://wappingersschools.org/johnjayhs/ |archivedate=2009-03-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wappingersschools.org/johnjayhs/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303223703/http://wappingersschools.org/johnjayhs/ |archivedate=2009-03-03 }}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\nIn recent years{{when|date=December 2016}}, John Jay's percentage of students going on to two- and four-year colleges has been in the 90s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.p12.nysed.gov/irs/reportcard/home.html|title=District and School Report Card : IRS : P-12 : NYSED|publisher=}}</ref> Often students enrolled in two-year programs subsequently move on to four-year programs following their earning an associate degree.
