By 1938, the party joined the United Opposition, closely associated with [[Vladko Ma\u010dek]], which united entire Yugoslav opposition bent on establishing a more democratic society.

The Buckeyes played their home games at [[Ohio Stadium]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. It was the Buckeyes' 128th overall, the 105th as a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]], and fourth as a member of the Eastern Division. They were led by [[Urban Meyer]], who was in his 6th season as head coach at the school.\n\nComing off a [[College Football Playoff]] appearance in [[2016 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|2016]], the Buckeyes began the year ranked second in the preseason [[AP Poll]] and were the overwhelming favorites to win the Big Ten.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/osu/2017/07/ohio_state_buckeyes_picked_to.html|title=Ohio State Buckeyes picked to win Big Ten in cleveland.com 2017 preseason poll|date=July 21, 2017|website=Cleveland.com|first=Doug|last=Lesmerises}}</ref> In the second game of the year, they suffered their first loss at the hands of No. 5 [[2017 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] in Columbus, whom Ohio State had beaten on the road the previous year. Ohio State won their following six games, including a 39\u201338 victory over No. 2 [[2017 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]], but lost in a blowout on the road to [[2017 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|Iowa]] the following week. The Buckeyes won their remaining regular season games and earned a spot in the [[2017 Big Ten Championship Game]] by winning the East Division with an 8\u20131 conference record. \n\nOhio State would play then-undefeated No. 1 [[2017 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]] as a heavy underdog. However, the Buckeyes pulled off an upset in Indianapolis, causing the last-undefeated FBS team to incur a loss. There was huge controversy over the College Football Playoff committee as to who would get into the final four; Alabama, which didn't play in the SEC Championship, was given a spot over both the Buckeyes and Badgers, both of whom just missed out on a playoff spot. Ohio State instead received an invitation to the [[2017 Cotton Bowl Classic (December)|Cotton Bowl]]. They defeated [[2017 USC Trojans football team|USC]] in that bowl to end the season at 12\u20132 and ranked fifth in the final polls.\n\nOhio State was led on offense by quarterback [[J.T. Barrett]], who was named first-team All-Big Ten. Barrett was both a passing and a running threat, finishing with 3,053 yards and a Big Ten-leading 35 touchdowns through the air, and 798 yards and 12 touchdowns on the ground. His 47 total touchdowns were second in [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]] behind [[Baker Mayfield]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/years/2017-leaders.html|title=2017 Leaders|website=Sports-Reference.com|access-date=February 1, 2019}}</ref> Freshman running back [[J.

This marked the first time that the Buckeyes opened a season on the road since their 42\u201324 victory over [[2015 Virginia Tech Hokies football team|Virginia Tech]] in [[2015 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|2015]] and their first time opening with a [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] opponent since [[1976 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|1976]] when they defeated [[1976 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]] 49\u201321.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://ohiostate.247sports.com/ContentGallery/Ohio-State-Buckeyes-football-will-open-on-road-in-Big-Ten-for-th-106464208|title=Ohio State Buckeyes football will open on road in Big Ten for third time ever|work=Bucknuts|access-date=31 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nOhio State began the game well, driving the ball 66 yards on 11 plays, but were stalled in the redzone, settling for a Sean Nuernberger field goal to take an early 3\u20130 lead. The Hoosiers answered with an 87-yard drive that was capped with an 18-yard touchdown pass from Richard Lagow to tight end Ian Thomas to take a four-point lead. The teams continued to trade punts until the second quarter when the Buckeyes' Jordan Fuller intercepted an Indiana pass in the endzone. Ohio State mounted a 58-yard drive that ended came up short at Indiana two-yard line that resulted in another Nuernberger field goal to bring the score to 7\u20136. Each team would score on touchdown drives of more than 75 yards on the next two possessions to give the Hoosiers a 14\u201313 lead at halftime.\n\nThe third quarter started off looking like it would continue to be a back-and-forth game as the teams again traded touchdowns, but the Buckeye passing offense, led by [[J. T. Barrett]], threw touchdown passes to Parris Campbell for 74 yards and to Johnnie Dixon for 54 yard to give the Buckeyes a 35\u201321 lead. The Buckeye defense took over from there turning the Hoosiers over two times, each resulting in an Ohio State touchdown. The Buckeyes held on for the win, 49\u201321.\n\nTwo Buckeye records were set during the game: J.K. Dobbins broke [[Maurice Clarett]]'s 2002 debut rushing performance of 175 yards by amassing 181 yards on the ground,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/recap?gameId=400935229|title=Ohio State vs. Indiana \u2013 Game Recap \u2013 August 31, 2017 \u2013 ESPN|website=ESPN.com|access-date=1 September 2017}}</ref> and [[J.

The Buckeyes, on the other hand, began the game with two consecutive punts which resulted with the game scoreless at the end of the first. The first score came at 11:11 in the second with a 24-yard Sean Nuernberger field goal after the Buckeyes failed to convert inside of the redzone. Eight plays later, Oklahoma again failed to capitalize in Ohio State territory, this time missing a 37-yard field goal. Following a punt by the Buckeyes, Oklahoma was able to mount a 55-yard drive to kick a 35-yard field goal to tie the game 3\u20133 at the half.\n\nThe Buckeyes came out of the gates strong behind a 56-yard Parris Campbell kickoff return capped by 6-yard J.K. Dobbins touchdown, giving the Buckeyes a 10\u20133 lead. But, 1:47 seconds later, [[Baker Mayfield]] and the Oklahoma Sooners stuck back on a 36-yard [[Dimitri Flowers]] touchdown reception to tie the game at 10. Ohio State would never find the endzone again and would settle for two more Nuernberger field goals.

This was the Buckeyes first-ever match-up against the Black Knights and the seventh match-up against a military academy. Ohio State is 5\u20131 all-time against the other two major military academies with the most recent win coming in [[2014 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|2014]] against [[2014 Navy Midshipmen football team|Navy]] and the only loss coming in [[1990 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|1990]] against [[1990 Air Force Falcons football team|Air Force]].  \nA week after seemingly nothing went right in a prime-time loss to [[2017 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]], Ohio State couldn't have scripted a better start in its bounce-back attempt against Army. The Buckeyes purred on their first two drives, covering 75 and then 94 yards, to race to a 14\u20130 lead. Army limited the Buckeyes to one possession in the second quarter and outscored OSU to draw to 17\u20137. Army started the quarter with an 11-play drive that ended when Blake Wilson missed a 43-yard field-goal attempt. Finally getting the ball back in the second half, the Buckeyes wasted little time taking it to the end zone. [[J. K. Dobbins]] ripped off a 22-yard run on first down from the 26, then went 52 yards on a run around left end, a play in which the freshman juked Army cornerback Mike Reynolds almost into the ground. That made the score 24\u20137, and after Kendall Sheffield recovered a fumbled snap on Army's next drive, OSU went to the air to increase its lead. [[J.T. Barrett]] completed all three of his passes on the next drive, including a 31-yarder across the middle to tight end Marcus Baugh to move the ball to the 22. Two plays later, Barrett threw a fastball strike to Terry McLaurin, who headed downfield until he found an open spot in the end zone. With a 31\u20137 lead, the Buckeyes forced a three-and-out but couldn't put the game away and punted from inside Army territory late in the quarter. The Buckeyes were winning big on the scoreboard, and that continued to the end. J.T. Barrett's 9-yard touchdown pass to Austin Mack, which gave the senior quarterback the Big Ten record by accounting for his 107th career touchdown. Another three-and-out gave OSU the ball back with 4:36 remaining, and backup QB Dwayne Haskins Jr. guided the offense 72 yards before the time arrived for victory formation.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''<ref name=\"Statistics\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!Army\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|586\n|278\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|316\n|19\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|270\n|259\n|-\n|Penalties\n|5\u201355\n|2\u201322\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|23:03\n|36:57\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!Army\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.

All but one of Rutgers' possessions ended in a punt or a turnover with the exception of a missed 32-yard field goal with 43 seconds left in the game.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''<ref name=\"Statistics\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!RU\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|628\n|209\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|342\n|92\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|286\n|117\n|-\n|Penalties\n|10\u2013106\n|10\u201380\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|0\n|2\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|24:34\n|35:26\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!RU\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.T.

This was Ohio State's Homecoming game. The Buckeyes have continued their undefeated streak over the Terrapins by winning by an average of 39 points.\n\nThe heavily favored Buckeyes began the game with a 9-play, 70-yard drive, capped by a 1-yard [[J. T. Barrett]] touchdown run.  On the Terrapins first drive, Quarterback Max Bortenschlager, was hit from behind by DE Nick Bosa and fumbled the ball which was returned by LB Jerome Baker for a 20-yard touchdown to give the Buckeyes an early 14\u20130 lead. The Buckeyes' special teams woes began on the ensuing kickoff which was returned for a 100-yard touchdown by Ty Johnson to cut the Ohio State lead to 7. But, the Ohio State offense answered again by scoring an 8-yard touchdown pass from Barrett to Benjimin Victor. Following a botched PAT snap, the Buckeyes lead 20\u20137 at the end of the first quarter.\n\nThe Buckeyes' miscues began adding up at the beginning of the second quarter. Sean Nuernberger's 47-yard field goal was blocked, [[J. K. Dobbins]] fumbled and punter Drue Chrisman had a 22-yard punt giving Maryland great field position. Though the mistakes on special teams and offense added up, the defense kept the Maryland offense scoreless. In the final five minutes of the second half, Ohio State scored three consecutive touchdowns giving them a 41\u20137 halftime lead.\n\nMaryland began the second half with a \u221214 yard drive that was followed by an Ohio State drive that ended with a missed 29-yard field goal attempt. The Ohio State offense recovered and scored touchdowns on three of their next four drives. Maryland's only offensive score of the day came after a Dwayne Haskins fumble at the Ohio State 27, which allowed for a four play drive, capped by a 20-yard Javon Leake run, making the final 62\u201314.\n\nOhio State finished the day with 584 total yards and held the Terrapins to only 66.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''<ref name=\"Statistics\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MD\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|584\n|66\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|303\n|16\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|281\n|50\n|-\n|Penalties\n|8\u201385\n|6\u201366\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|2\n|2\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|32:24\n|27:36\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MD\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.T.

This is the third consecutive defeat of their cross-divisional foe, with the last and only loss coming in 2011. Additionally, the win marked the Buckeye's 500th [[Big Ten Conference]] victory and moved them into a tie with the Cornhuskers for the third-most [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision]] wins at 892.\n\nThe Buckeyes began the game on defense which forced a three-and-out. Following a 57-yard punt which pinned the Ohio State offense at their own 4-yard line, the Buckeye's drove 96 yards to score the game's first score that was capped by a 52-yard, [[J. K. Dobbins]], touchdown.  After another three-and-out by the Silver Bullet defense, the offense again scored on another drive that ended with a [[J. T. Barrett]] touchdown run, giving the Buckeyes a 14\u20130 lead at the end of the opening quarter. Ohio State scored less than 90 seconds into the second quarter, increasing their lead to 21. The Nebraska offense showed very little in the first half, gaining only five first downs on their six possessions, and the defense struggled even more by failing to stop the Buckeyes from reaching the endzone on all five of their possessions. This gave Ohio State a 35\u20130 halftime lead.\n\nOhio State once again lead a 75-yard drive to open the second half but were quickly matched by a 77-yard [[Tanner Lee]] touchdown pass to J.D. Spielman, making the score 42\u20137 Ohio State. The Cornhuskers would once again score on their following possession, on another Tanner Lee pass, but the score was again matched on a 15-play, 66-yard, Ohio State scoring drive. Nebraska would fail to score again while Ohio State would score once more, making the final score 56\u201314. Ohio State would score on eight of their nine drives and never having to punt.\n\n[[J. T. Barrett|Barrett]] scored five passing touchdowns and two rushing touchdowns, which tied his record for most touchdowns responsible for that he set in 2016. For his performance, he was named the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week for the eighth time in his career, the Davey O'Brien national quarterback of the week and the Earl Campbell Tyler Rose Award National Player of the Week.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elevenwarriors.com/ohio-state-football/2017/10/86685/jt-barrett-named-davey-obrien-award-national-quarterback-of-the-week|title=J.T.

The Buckeyes avenged last year's loss to Penn State that gave them their only regular season loss and allowed the Nittany Lions to earn a berth over the Buckeyes in the [[2016 Big Ten Football Championship Game]]. OSU Coach [[Urban Meyer]] is now 5\u20131 versus Penn State and PSU's [[James Franklin (American football coach)|James Franklin]] is 1\u20133 versus the Buckeyes. In all but three of the 32 match-ups, including 13 straight, at least one of the teams was ranked in the AP Top 25 poll. This game served as host to [[ESPN]]'s [[College GameDay (football)|College GameDay]], and was Ohio State's third appearance this year and Penn State's second.\n\nSpecial teams woes began immediately for the Buckeyes when Penn State won the opening coin toss and elected to receive the ball on the opening kickoff which resulted in a 97-yard [[Saquon Barkley]] kickoff return for a touchdown. On Ohio State's following possession, after only three plays, wide receiver Parris Campbell fumbled the ball after he was once again injured. This gave the Nittany Lion possession on their 23-yard line which led to an eventual 13-yard touchdown pass from [[Trace McSorley]] to [[DaeSean Hamilton]].  The Buckeyes found themselves in a 14-point hole at the 11:34 mark of the first quarter. After trading punts, Ohio State finally got on the scoreboard following a 38-yard Sean Nuernberger field goal to make the score 3\u201314. The remainder of the first quarter remained fairly quiet.\n\nThe second quarter of the game began with an 81-yard Penn State drive that resulted in a 36-yard touchdown Barkley run to give Penn State an 18-point lead with a score of 3\u201321. [[J. T. Barrett]] and the Ohio State offense was able to match that score with their first touchdown of the game by driving 63 yards and scoring on a 14-yard pass from Barrett to Terry McLaurin. The Buckeyes once again faced a special teams disaster on the following kickoff which was returned for 59 yards by Koa Farmer to the Ohio State 23 yard line. Two plays later McSorley ran for a 6-yard touchdown to give the Nittany Lions a 28\u201310 lead. Fortunately for the Buckeyes, the offense was able to travel 75 yards and a 2-yard [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] touchdown with less than five minutes in the half to cut the PSU lead to 17\u201328. Punts were traded by both teams to end the half and Penn State went to the locker room with an impressive 11-point lead.\n\nThe Buckeyes were able to amount a 57-yard drive following the intermission that resulted in a 36-yard Nuernberger field goal to get the lead to eight, but it was quickly negated ten plays later when McSorley found the endzone again on a 37-yard touchdown pass to DeAndre Thompkins. The third quarter had no more scoring and the Nittany Lions were able to secure a 20\u201335 lead going into the fourth and final quarter.\n\nOn the opening drive of the fourth quarter, Barrett fumbled the ball in a botched hand off attempt to [[J. K. Dobbins]] which gave the ball to the Nittany Lions on Ohio State's 42 yard line. The Buckeye defense stepped up and forced a three-and-out which was followed by a blocked punt by Denzel Ward. Two plays later Ohio State found the endzone on a 38-yard pass from Barrett to Johnnie Dixon, which would bring the Buckeyes within eight. Unfortunately for the Buckeyes, Penn State was able to pull back ahead by 11 on a 5:23 drive that ended in a 24-yard Tyler Davis field goal. Following the Penn State score, the Buckeye offense came alive and resulted in two 55+ yard drives that ended in Barrett touchdown passes. One to Dixon and the go-ahead touchdown to Marcus Baugh. Penn State on the other hand faced two consecutive possessions of negative yards, sealing the one-point Ohio State victory.\n\nJ.T. Barrett gained a school record 423 total offensive yards during the game earning him his ninth Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week honors, while wide receiver K.J. Hill caught 12 passes, which is the fourth most in program history. The Buckeye defense was able to hold [[Heisman Trophy]] hopeful Barkley to a season low of only 44 yards rushing on 21 attempts, but his performance on special teams earned him honors for Big Ten Special Team Player of the Week.\n\nOhio State moved up to No. 3 in both the AP and Coaches Polls while Penn State fell to No. 7 in both. The Buckeyes took over the sole lead of the Big Ten East division following the victory and a [[2017 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]] loss to [[2017 Northwestern Wildcats football team|Northwestern]].\n\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryStart|VisitorName=PSU|HomeName=OSU|state=collapsed}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=1\n| Time=14:45\n| Team=Penn State\n| DrivePlays=\n| DriveLength=\n| DriveTime=\n| Type=KickTD\n| Runner=[[Saquon Barkley]]\n| yards=97\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Tyler Davis\n| 2pt type=run/pass\n| 2pt result=good/failed/incomplete\n| Visitor=7\n| Home=0\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=1\n| Time=11:36\n| Team=Penn State\n| DrivePlays=5\n| DriveLength=23\n| DriveTime=1:56\n| Type=RecTD\n| Receiver=[[DaeSean Hamilton]]\n| QB=[[Trace McSorley]]\n| yards=13\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Tyler Davis\n| 2pt type=run/pass\n| 2pt result=good/failed/incomplete\n| Visitor=14\n| Home=0\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=1\n| Time=4:38\n| Team=Ohio State\n| DrivePlays=9\n| DriveLength=37\n| DriveTime=2:58\n| Type=FG\n| yards=38\n| Kicker=Sean Nuernberger\n| Visitor=14\n| Home=3\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=2\n| Time=11:40\n| Team=Penn State\n| DrivePlays=7\n| DriveLength=81\n| DriveTime=3:20\n| Type=RushTD\n| Runner=Saquon Barkley\n| yards=36\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Tyler Davis\n| 2pt type=run/pass\n| 2pt result=good/failed/incomplete\n| Visitor=21\n| Home=3\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=2\n| Time=9:32\n| Team=Ohio State\n| DrivePlays=5\n| DriveLength=63\n| DriveTime=2:01\n| Type=RecTD\n| Receiver=Terry McLaurin\n| QB=[[J.

This was the Buckeyes' first trip to Iowa since 2010 and the first time playing the Hawkeyes since 2013.\n\nThe first play of the game began a tough day for the Buckeyes when quarterback [[J. T. Barrett]] threw his first of four interceptions that was returned for an Iowa touchdown by [[Amani Hooker]]. The Buckeye offense looked to rebound by scoring two touchdowns and a field goal on their next three possessions. The Hawkeyes matched them by also scoring touchdowns on all but one of their first half drives. This gave Iowa a 31\u201317 lead at the half. The second half proved to be no easier on the Buckeyes as they allowed three more Iowa touchdowns and a field goal, while the Buckeyes offense only managed three first downs and one touchdown.\n\nOhio State fell to No. 11 in both the AP and the Coaches' Polls while falling to 13th in the CFP Poll. Iowa found themselves ranked for the first time in 2017 as they debuted at No. 25 in the AP Poll and No. 20 in the CFP Poll. The loss put the Buckeyes in a two-way tie at the top of the Big Ten East with their next opponent, Michigan State.

OSU coach [[Urban Meyer]] moved to 4\u20132 versus the Spartans, while MSU coach [[Mark Dantonio]] fell to 3\u20136 against the Buckeyes. With the victory, Ohio State became the sole possessors of first place in the Big Ten East.\n\nWhile Michigan State started on a nine-play drive that took more than five minutes off of the clock, the Buckeyes were able to force a punt, a large part due to Nick Bosa's 12-yard sack on third down. The Buckeye offense was able to form an 86-yard drive that resulted in 79 rushing yards, including a 47-yard touchdown run by [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]]. [[J. T. Barrett]] was able to rush for two more touchdowns as well as pass for another to give them a 28\u20130 lead. The Buckeye's final score of the first half came on a Weber 82-yard run on their next to-last possession, while Michigan State was able to kick a field goal as time expired following a Barrett interception. The Buckeyes would lead 35\u20133 at halftime. Ohio State was able to find the endzone on the third play of the second half with a 48-yard pass from Barrett to Binjimin Victor, this would be the last touchdown of the game. Ohio State would kick two Sean Nuernberger field goals on their next two possessions to increase their lead to 45.\n\nBefore this game, the largest Dantonio-Meyer match-up spread had been a 12-point OSU victory. This result was the largest defeat in the series history.\n\nThe Buckeyes moved up three spots to No. 8 in both the AP and Coaches' polls and four spots to No. 9 in the CFP poll while Michigan State fell to No. 24 in the AP poll, No. 22 in the Coaches' poll and No. 17 in the CFP poll.

Ohio State was awarded the [[Illibuck Trophy]] for the ninth consecutive time, which has been given out since 1925, making it the second oldest trophy between Big Ten football programs. [[Urban Meyer]] is now 5\u20130 against the Illini, while this was Illinois coach [[Lovie Smith]]'s first game against the Buckeyes.\n\nThe Buckeye offense came out and struck quickly by scoring on their first drive by a 25-yard [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] touchdown run. Ohio State's defense, matched the effort by forcing what would be the first of many three-and-outs. The following drive also resulted in a touchdown following a 6 play, 71-yard drive, capped by [[J.T. Barrett]]'s ninth rushing touchdown of the season. Ohio State would go on to score two more touchdowns in the first quarter, one by a pass from Barrett to Binjimen Victor and the other by a 43-yard Weber run. Illinois would fail to convert a first down, giving the Buckeyes a 28\u20130 lead at the end of the first quarter.\n\nOhio State was able to add a 33-year Sean Nuernberger field goal at the beginning of the second period, followed soon after by another OSU drive that ended with a [[J. K. Dobbins]] touchdown run, which would be the last time the primary starters would see the game in the first half. Ohio State would fail to score on a drive for the first time during their last possession, while Illinois would gain their only first down of the opening half. Ohio State would go into halftime with a 38\u20130 lead as heavy rain began to fall.\n\nOhio State's defense mounted another three-and-out to start the second half, but the offense was apparently effected by the rain when back-up quarterback Dwayne Haskins fumbled the ball and it was returned 54-yards by Ahmari Hayes for Illinois' first score. Ohio State's offensive starters went back into the game but were forced to punt. Luckily for the Buckeyes, the punt was muffed and recovered by Ohio State that led to a Barrett touchdown pass to tight end Marcus Ball. Ohio State led 45\u20137 at this point and would be the last time the offensive starters saw the field. The teams traded punts to close out the third quarter.\n\nAfter a short performance by back-up quarterback, Joe Burrow, Haskins went back in the game which resulted in a 21-yard touchdown pass to Victor. The Illini would match the result with their only offensive touchdown on a 65-yard drive to make the score 52\u201314. Neither team would score again to make that the final.\n\nOhio State would only allow three first downs and it was the sixth game of the season that they allowed less than 100 rushing yards and the fifth game they allowed less than 100 passing yards.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/ncf/boxscore/_/id/400935394|title=Penn State vs. Ohio State \u2013 Box Score \u2013 October 28, 2017 \u2013 ESPN|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-10-30}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!ILL\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|543\n|105\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|218\n|16\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|325\n|89\n|-\n|Penalties\n|7\u201368\n|7\u201355\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|37:16\n|22:44\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!ILL\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.T.

The No. 9 Ohio State Buckeyes defeated the Michigan Wolverines by a score of 31\u201320.\n\nOhio State and Michigan both started off slowly by forcing three-and-outs on each team's opening drive before the Wolverines mounted a nearly six minute, 13-play, 77-yard drive that resulted in a touchdown. Ohio State was again forced with another three-and-out that was followed by a Michigan drive that ended in a punt that pinned the Buckeye's deep. Ohio State was forced to punt and was returned 42-yards by Michigan wide receiver [[Donovan Peoples-Jones]], additionally, Ohio State committed a block in the back which gave the Wolverines the ball at the five-yard line. Michigan was able to take a 14\u20130 lead when quarterback [[John O'Korn]] completed a three-yard pass to Sean McKeon. Ohio State was held to \u22126 yard in the first quarter and was the first time since 2010 that Ohio State had been held to negative yardage in a quarter. The Ohio State offense and the rushing attack of [[J. T. Barrett]] and [[J. K. Dobbins]] came alive on the following drive when the two gained 71 yards on the ground that ended with a 21-yard Barrett touchdown run. Following a Michigan punt, Ohio State was able to move the ball again behind Barrett when he ran for 26 yards and threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to tight end Marcus Baugh, tying the game at 14. Neither team would score again in the first half.\n\nOhio State again started off slow by being forced to consecutive three-and-outs, while Michigan was able to score on a 2-yard [[Karan Higdon]] touchdown run. Ohio State linebacker, Chris Worley, was able to block the PAT and Michigan led 20\u201314. The Buckeyes answered back when Ohio State mounted a 78-yard touchdown drive capped by a 1-yard Dobbins touchdown run. Unfortunately for the Buckeyes, Barrett was injured during the drive and was forced out for the remainder of the game. RS Freshman, Dwayne Haskins gained 24 yards on the ground and 31 in the air on the drive that gave the Buckeyes a one-point, 21\u201320 lead. The Wolverines were unable to capitalize on the following possession and Ohio State was able to tack on a 44-yard Sean Nuernberger field goal, increasing the lead to four.  Michigan drove the ball 36-yards on their next possession, but turned the ball over on downs following an O'Korn sack and two additional incomplete passes. The Buckeyes drove again and Nuernberger missed only his third field goal of the season on a 43-yard attempt. The following play, O'Korn committed the only turnover of the game when he threw an interception to Jordan Fuller. On Ohio State's next possession, Dobbins ran for 41 yards and [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] was able to seal the game by scoring a 25-yard touchdown run with 1:44 remaining in the game, to make what would be the final score, 31\u201320.\n\nMichigan coach [[Jim Harbaugh]] dropped to 0\u20133 versus the Buckeyes, while [[Urban Meyer]] moved to 6\u20130 against the Wolverines. The current winning streak is tied for the second-longest in the series and tied for the longest for Ohio State with the 2004\u20132009 games. J.T. Barrett became the only quarterback in the series history to have four wins versus the other and moved Ohio State into first place in the number of all-time Big Ten wins. Ohio State clinched their first outright divisional title since 2014 and faced Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship Game. Ohio State's ranking would remain unchanged in the AP Poll at No. 8 and they would move up one spot to No. 7 in the Coaches Poll.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MICH\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|350\n|295\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|124\n|195\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|226\n|100\n|-\n|Penalties\n|9\u201375\n|6\u201350\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|31:17\n|28:43\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MICH\n|-\n|Passing\n|Dwayne Haskins (94)\n|[[John O'Korn]] (195)\n|-\n|Rushing\n|[[J.

Urban Meyer is now 5\u20130 versus the Badgers, with two of the victories coming in overtime. [[Paul Chryst]] fell to 0\u20132 versus the Buckeyes. This was Ohio State's third appearance in the Championship game and Wisconsin's fifth, including their second straight.\n\nThe Badgers began the game with the ball and were forced to punt after a three-and-out with the reverse result happening on the Buckeyes' first possession as well. Wisconsin would then follow with a 55-yard drive that ended with an interception in Wisconsin's redzone thrown by [[Alex Hornibrook]] to Denzel Ward at OSU's 4-yard line. [[J. T. Barrett]] would rush for a total of 12 yards before hitting Terry McLaurin for an 84-yard touchdown pass giving the Buckeyes an early 7\u20130 lead. The pass from Barrett to McLaurin was the longest play committed against the Badgers' defense all season. The following Wisconsin drive lasted for 7 plays and 44 yards and a punt trapped the Buckeyes on their own two-yard line. Barrett would go on to throw an interception to Wisconsin linebacker Andrew Van Ginkel that was returned for a touchdown, tying the game at 7\u20137. Ohio State would bounce back quickly and score on a Barrett to Parris Campbell, 57-yard touchdown pass, once again regaining the lead 14\u20137 and bringing an end to the first quarter.\n\nOhio State wand Wisconsin traded punts to open the second quarter, but the Buckeyes would strike again with a Barrett 1-yard touchdown run that was set up by a 77-yard rush by [[J. K. Dobbins]].  On Ohio State's second possession of the second quarter, [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] would commit his first fumble of the year that was recovered by Van Ginkel that would lead to a 28-yard field goal, making the score 21\u201310 in favor of the Buckeyes. Ohio State would attempt to add to their lead, but Sean Nuernberger's 43-yard field goal was blocked as time expired.\n\nWhile Ohio State couldn't amount a drive to open the second half, Wisconsin was able to convert a 46-yard field goal to narrow the lead to 8, which was quickly matched by the Buckeyes thanks to a 53-yard Dobbins run and a 27-yard Nuernberger field goal. Punts were traded after several three-and-outs both teams until Wisconsin began an 11-play, 52-yard drive that started with a Barrett interception that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by Chris James and a successful 2-point conversion. The score narrowed to 24\u201321 favoring Ohio State. The Buckeyes followed with a 15-play drive that took 5:20 off the clock and tacked on a 20-yard Ohio State field goal to increase the lead back to 6. The Buckeyes and the Badgers again traded punts and with 1:50 left in the game, Wisconsin would begin their final offensive drive. Wisconsin would secure two first downs bringing them to mid-field. A holding penalty on Wisconsin on first down would force a first and 20. Hornibrook would throw three incomplete passes until he threw an interception to Damon Webb. Ohio State was able to run out the clock and secure their 36th Big Ten Title.\n\n[[J. K. Dobbins]] would be named the MVP of the game which was the first time a Freshman earned the award. He would also become the all-time leading Freshman rusher in Ohio State history, passing [[Maurice Clarett]]. Ohio State would go on to be ranked No. 5 in the final CFP poll and miss the playoffs while Wisconsin would fall to No. 6.

This was the first time that the Buckeyes defeated the Trojans since 1974, which broke a seven-game USC win-streak.\n\nOhio State and their Silver Bullet defense proved to be a tough match for USC. On the third play of the game, Ohio State's Kendall Sheffield was able to strip the ball from USC wide receiver [[Deontay Burnett]] which was recovered and advanced 20 yards by Ohio State's Damon Webb. This set up a short five-play drive that resulted in a [[J. T. Barrett]] 1-yard touchdown run. Punts were traded a few times by both teams until the Buckeyes produced an 83-yard drive that tacked on a 26-yard Sean Nuernberger field goal at the beginning of the second quarter to five OSU a 10\u20130 lead. The following play, [[Sam Darnold]] threw an interception to Ohio State's Damon Webb which was returned for a 23-yard touchdown giving the Buckeyes a 17\u20130 lead. Again, both teams traded punts and USC fumbled the ball which set up a 59-yard Buckeye drive that ended with a 28-yard Barrett touchdown run giving the Buckeyes a 24-point lead. USC was able to find the scoreboard in the second quarter when K.J. Hill fumbled a punt return which set up a 15-yard drive, capped by a one-yard [[Ronald Jones II]] touchdown run.  The score at half would be 24\u20137 favoring Ohio State.\n\nOffensively, the Buckeyes remained quiet the second half by having all but one drive ending in a punt. USC was able to  drive deep into Buckeye territory three times, but a missed field goal, a fumble and a failed fourth-down conversion didn't allow the Trojans to score any points. The final score would end as 24\u20137.\n\nBarrett and Webb were named the Offensive and Defensive MVPs respectively.

The Buckeyes played their home games at [[Ohio Stadium]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. It was the Buckeyes' 128th overall, the 105th as a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]], and fourth as a member of the Eastern Division. They were led by [[Urban Meyer]], who was in his 6th season as head coach at the school.\n\nComing off a [[College Football Playoff]] appearance in [[2016 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|2016]], the Buckeyes began the year ranked second in the preseason [[AP Poll]] and were the overwhelming favorites to win the Big Ten.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/osu/2017/07/ohio_state_buckeyes_picked_to.html|title=Ohio State Buckeyes picked to win Big Ten in cleveland.com 2017 preseason poll|date=July 21, 2017|website=Cleveland.com|first=Doug|last=Lesmerises}}</ref> In the second game of the year, they suffered their first loss at the hands of No. 5 [[2017 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] in Columbus, whom Ohio State had beaten on the road the previous year. Ohio State won their following six games, including a 39\u201338 victory over No. 2 [[2017 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]], but lost in a blowout on the road to [[2017 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|Iowa]] the following week. The Buckeyes won their remaining regular season games and earned a spot in the [[2017 Big Ten Championship Game]] by winning the East Division with an 8\u20131 conference record. \n\nOhio State would play then-undefeated No. 1 [[2017 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]] as a heavy underdog. However, the Buckeyes pulled off an upset in Indianapolis, causing the last-undefeated FBS team to incur a loss. There was huge controversy over the College Football Playoff committee as to who would get into the final four; Alabama, which didn't play in the SEC Championship, was given a spot over both the Buckeyes and Badgers, both of whom just missed out on a playoff spot. Ohio State instead received an invitation to the [[2017 Cotton Bowl Classic (December)|Cotton Bowl]]. They defeated [[2017 USC Trojans football team|USC]] in that bowl to end the season at 12\u20132 and ranked fifth in the final polls.\n\nOhio State was led on offense by quarterback [[J.T. Barrett]], who was named first-team All-Big Ten. Barrett was both a passing and a running threat, finishing with 3,053 yards and a Big Ten-leading 35 touchdowns through the air, and 798 yards and 12 touchdowns on the ground. His 47 total touchdowns were second in [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]] behind [[Baker Mayfield]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/years/2017-leaders.html|title=2017 Leaders|website=Sports-Reference.com|access-date=February 1, 2019}}</ref> Freshman running back [[J.

This marked the first time that the Buckeyes opened a season on the road since their 42\u201324 victory over [[2015 Virginia Tech Hokies football team|Virginia Tech]] in [[2015 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|2015]] and their first time opening with a [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] opponent since [[1976 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|1976]] when they defeated [[1976 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]] 49\u201321.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://ohiostate.247sports.com/ContentGallery/Ohio-State-Buckeyes-football-will-open-on-road-in-Big-Ten-for-th-106464208|title=Ohio State Buckeyes football will open on road in Big Ten for third time ever|work=Bucknuts|access-date=31 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nOhio State began the game well, driving the ball 66 yards on 11 plays, but were stalled in the redzone, settling for a Sean Nuernberger field goal to take an early 3\u20130 lead. The Hoosiers answered with an 87-yard drive that was capped with an 18-yard touchdown pass from Richard Lagow to tight end Ian Thomas to take a four-point lead. The teams continued to trade punts until the second quarter when the Buckeyes' Jordan Fuller intercepted an Indiana pass in the endzone. Ohio State mounted a 58-yard drive that ended came up short at Indiana two-yard line that resulted in another Nuernberger field goal to bring the score to 7\u20136. Each team would score on touchdown drives of more than 75 yards on the next two possessions to give the Hoosiers a 14\u201313 lead at halftime.\n\nThe third quarter started off looking like it would continue to be a back-and-forth game as the teams again traded touchdowns, but the Buckeye passing offense, led by [[J. T. Barrett]], threw touchdown passes to Parris Campbell for 74 yards and to Johnnie Dixon for 54 yard to give the Buckeyes a 35\u201321 lead. The Buckeye defense took over from there turning the Hoosiers over two times, each resulting in an Ohio State touchdown.

The Buckeyes, on the other hand, began the game with two consecutive punts which resulted with the game scoreless at the end of the first. The first score came at 11:11 in the second with a 24-yard Sean Nuernberger field goal after the Buckeyes failed to convert inside of the redzone. Eight plays later, Oklahoma again failed to capitalize in Ohio State territory, this time missing a 37-yard field goal. Following a punt by the Buckeyes, Oklahoma was able to mount a 55-yard drive to kick a 35-yard field goal to tie the game 3\u20133 at the half.\n\nThe Buckeyes came out of the gates strong behind a 56-yard Parris Campbell kickoff return capped by 6-yard J.K.

But, 1:47 seconds later, [[Baker Mayfield]] and the Oklahoma Sooners stuck back on a 36-yard [[Dimitri Flowers]] touchdown reception to tie the game at 10.

This was the Buckeyes first-ever match-up against the Black Knights and the seventh match-up against a military academy. Ohio State is 5\u20131 all-time against the other two major military academies with the most recent win coming in [[2014 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|2014]] against [[2014 Navy Midshipmen football team|Navy]] and the only loss coming in [[1990 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|1990]] against [[1990 Air Force Falcons football team|Air Force]].  \nA week after seemingly nothing went right in a prime-time loss to [[2017 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]], Ohio State couldn't have scripted a better start in its bounce-back attempt against Army. The Buckeyes purred on their first two drives, covering 75 and then 94 yards, to race to a 14\u20130 lead. Army limited the Buckeyes to one possession in the second quarter and outscored OSU to draw to 17\u20137. Army started the quarter with an 11-play drive that ended when Blake Wilson missed a 43-yard field-goal attempt. Finally getting the ball back in the second half, the Buckeyes wasted little time taking it to the end zone. [[J. K. Dobbins]] ripped off a 22-yard run on first down from the 26, then went 52 yards on a run around left end, a play in which the freshman juked Army cornerback Mike Reynolds almost into the ground. That made the score 24\u20137, and after Kendall Sheffield recovered a fumbled snap on Army's next drive, OSU went to the air to increase its lead. [[J.T. Barrett]] completed all three of his passes on the next drive, including a 31-yarder across the middle to tight end Marcus Baugh to move the ball to the 22. Two plays later, Barrett threw a fastball strike to Terry McLaurin, who headed downfield until he found an open spot in the end zone. With a 31\u20137 lead, the Buckeyes forced a three-and-out but couldn't put the game away and punted from inside Army territory late in the quarter. The Buckeyes were winning big on the scoreboard, and that continued to the end. J.T. Barrett's 9-yard touchdown pass to Austin Mack, which gave the senior quarterback the Big Ten record by accounting for his 107th career touchdown. Another three-and-out gave OSU the ball back with 4:36 remaining, and backup QB Dwayne Haskins Jr. guided the offense 72 yards before the time arrived for victory formation.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''<ref name=\"Statistics\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!Army\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|586\n|278\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|316\n|19\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|270\n|259\n|-\n|Penalties\n|5\u201355\n|2\u201322\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|23:03\n|36:57\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!Army\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.

On the Terrapins first drive, Quarterback Max Bortenschlager, was hit from behind by DE Nick Bosa and fumbled the ball which was returned by LB Jerome Baker for a 20-yard touchdown to give the Buckeyes an early 14\u20130 lead. The Buckeyes' special teams woes began on the ensuing kickoff which was returned for a 100-yard touchdown by Ty Johnson to cut the Ohio State lead to 7.

The Buckeyes avenged last year's loss to Penn State that gave them their only regular season loss and allowed the Nittany Lions to earn a berth over the Buckeyes in the [[2016 Big Ten Football Championship Game]]. OSU Coach [[Urban Meyer]] is now 5\u20131 versus Penn State and PSU's [[James Franklin (American football coach)|James Franklin]] is 1\u20133 versus the Buckeyes. In all but three of the 32 match-ups, including 13 straight, at least one of the teams was ranked in the AP Top 25 poll. This game served as host to [[ESPN]]'s [[College GameDay (football)|College GameDay]], and was Ohio State's third appearance this year and Penn State's second.\n\nSpecial teams woes began immediately for the Buckeyes when Penn State won the opening coin toss and elected to receive the ball on the opening kickoff which resulted in a 97-yard [[Saquon Barkley]] kickoff return for a touchdown. On Ohio State's following possession, after only three plays, wide receiver Parris Campbell fumbled the ball after he was once again injured. This gave the Nittany Lion possession on their 23-yard line which led to an eventual 13-yard touchdown pass from [[Trace McSorley]] to [[DaeSean Hamilton]].  The Buckeyes found themselves in a 14-point hole at the 11:34 mark of the first quarter. After trading punts, Ohio State finally got on the scoreboard following a 38-yard Sean Nuernberger field goal to make the score 3\u201314. The remainder of the first quarter remained fairly quiet.\n\nThe second quarter of the game began with an 81-yard Penn State drive that resulted in a 36-yard touchdown Barkley run to give Penn State an 18-point lead with a score of 3\u201321. [[J. T. Barrett]] and the Ohio State offense was able to match that score with their first touchdown of the game by driving 63 yards and scoring on a 14-yard pass from Barrett to Terry McLaurin. The Buckeyes once again faced a special teams disaster on the following kickoff which was returned for 59 yards by Koa Farmer to the Ohio State 23 yard line. Two plays later McSorley ran for a 6-yard touchdown to give the Nittany Lions a 28\u201310 lead. Fortunately for the Buckeyes, the offense was able to travel 75 yards and a 2-yard [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] touchdown with less than five minutes in the half to cut the PSU lead to 17\u201328. Punts were traded by both teams to end the half and Penn State went to the locker room with an impressive 11-point lead.\n\nThe Buckeyes were able to amount a 57-yard drive following the intermission that resulted in a 36-yard Nuernberger field goal to get the lead to eight, but it was quickly negated ten plays later when McSorley found the endzone again on a 37-yard touchdown pass to DeAndre Thompkins. The third quarter had no more scoring and the Nittany Lions were able to secure a 20\u201335 lead going into the fourth and final quarter.\n\nOn the opening drive of the fourth quarter, Barrett fumbled the ball in a botched hand off attempt to [[J. K. Dobbins]] which gave the ball to the Nittany Lions on Ohio State's 42 yard line. The Buckeye defense stepped up and forced a three-and-out which was followed by a blocked punt by Denzel Ward. Two plays later Ohio State found the endzone on a 38-yard pass from Barrett to Johnnie Dixon, which would bring the Buckeyes within eight. Unfortunately for the Buckeyes, Penn State was able to pull back ahead by 11 on a 5:23 drive that ended in a 24-yard Tyler Davis field goal. Following the Penn State score, the Buckeye offense came alive and resulted in two 55+ yard drives that ended in Barrett touchdown passes. One to Dixon and the go-ahead touchdown to Marcus Baugh. Penn State on the other hand faced two consecutive possessions of negative yards, sealing the one-point Ohio State victory.\n\nJ.T. Barrett gained a school record 423 total offensive yards during the game earning him his ninth Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week honors, while wide receiver K.J. Hill caught 12 passes, which is the fourth most in program history. The Buckeye defense was able to hold [[Heisman Trophy]] hopeful Barkley to a season low of only 44 yards rushing on 21 attempts, but his performance on special teams earned him honors for Big Ten Special Team Player of the Week.\n\nOhio State moved up to No. 3 in both the AP and Coaches Polls while Penn State fell to No. 7 in both. The Buckeyes took over the sole lead of the Big Ten East division following the victory and a [[2017 Michigan State Spartans football team|Michigan State]] loss to [[2017 Northwestern Wildcats football team|Northwestern]].\n\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryStart|VisitorName=PSU|HomeName=OSU|state=collapsed}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=1\n| Time=14:45\n| Team=Penn State\n| DrivePlays=\n| DriveLength=\n| DriveTime=\n| Type=KickTD\n| Runner=[[Saquon Barkley]]\n| yards=97\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Tyler Davis\n| 2pt type=run/pass\n| 2pt result=good/failed/incomplete\n| Visitor=7\n| Home=0\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=1\n| Time=11:36\n| Team=Penn State\n| DrivePlays=5\n| DriveLength=23\n| DriveTime=1:56\n| Type=RecTD\n| Receiver=[[DaeSean Hamilton]]\n| QB=[[Trace McSorley]]\n| yards=13\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Tyler Davis\n| 2pt type=run/pass\n| 2pt result=good/failed/incomplete\n| Visitor=14\n| Home=0\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=1\n| Time=4:38\n| Team=Ohio State\n| DrivePlays=9\n| DriveLength=37\n| DriveTime=2:58\n| Type=FG\n| yards=38\n| Kicker=Sean Nuernberger\n| Visitor=14\n| Home=3\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=2\n| Time=11:40\n| Team=Penn State\n| DrivePlays=7\n| DriveLength=81\n| DriveTime=3:20\n| Type=RushTD\n| Runner=Saquon Barkley\n| yards=36\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Tyler Davis\n| 2pt type=run/pass\n| 2pt result=good/failed/incomplete\n| Visitor=21\n| Home=3\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=2\n| Time=9:32\n| Team=Ohio State\n| DrivePlays=5\n| DriveLength=63\n| DriveTime=2:01\n| Type=RecTD\n| Receiver=Terry McLaurin\n| QB=[[J.

This was the Buckeyes' first trip to Iowa since 2010 and the first time playing the Hawkeyes since 2013.\n\nThe first play of the game began a tough day for the Buckeyes when quarterback [[J. T. Barrett]] threw his first of four interceptions that was returned for an Iowa touchdown by [[Amani Hooker]]. The Buckeye offense looked to rebound by scoring two touchdowns and a field goal on their next three possessions. The Hawkeyes matched them by also scoring touchdowns on all but one of their first half drives. This gave Iowa a 31\u201317 lead at the half. The second half proved to be no easier on the Buckeyes as they allowed three more Iowa touchdowns and a field goal, while the Buckeyes offense only managed three first downs and one touchdown.\n\nOhio State fell to No. 11 in both the AP and the Coaches' Polls while falling to 13th in the CFP Poll. Iowa found themselves ranked for the first time in 2017 as they debuted at No. 25 in the AP Poll and No. 20 in the CFP Poll. The loss put the Buckeyes in a two-way tie at the top of the Big Ten East with their next opponent, Michigan State. Iowa quarterback, [[Nate Stanley]], was named the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/ncf/boxscore/_/id/400935394|title=Penn State vs. Ohio State \u2013 Box Score \u2013 October 28, 2017 \u2013 ESPN|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-10-30}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!Iowa\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|371\n|487\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|208\n|244\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|163\n|243\n|-\n|Penalties\n|9\u201395\n|5\u201334\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|4\n|0\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|25:09\n|34:51\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!Iowa\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.T.

OSU coach [[Urban Meyer]] moved to 4\u20132 versus the Spartans, while MSU coach [[Mark Dantonio]] fell to 3\u20136 against the Buckeyes. With the victory, Ohio State became the sole possessors of first place in the Big Ten East.\n\nWhile Michigan State started on a nine-play drive that took more than five minutes off of the clock, the Buckeyes were able to force a punt, a large part due to Nick Bosa's 12-yard sack on third down. The Buckeye offense was able to form an 86-yard drive that resulted in 79 rushing yards, including a 47-yard touchdown run by [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]]. [[J. T.

The Buckeye's final score of the first half came on a Weber 82-yard run on their next to-last possession, while Michigan State was able to kick a field goal as time expired following a Barrett interception. The Buckeyes would lead 35\u20133 at halftime. Ohio State was able to find the endzone on the third play of the second half with a 48-yard pass from Barrett to Binjimin Victor, this would be the last touchdown of the game. Ohio State would kick two Sean Nuernberger field goals on their next two possessions to increase their lead to 45.\n\nBefore this game, the largest Dantonio-Meyer match-up spread had been a 12-point OSU victory. This result was the largest defeat in the series history.\n\nThe Buckeyes moved up three spots to No. 8 in both the AP and Coaches' polls and four spots to No. 9 in the CFP poll while Michigan State fell to No. 24 in the AP poll, No. 22 in the Coaches' poll and No. 17 in the CFP poll.

Ohio State was awarded the [[Illibuck Trophy]] for the ninth consecutive time, which has been given out since 1925, making it the second oldest trophy between Big Ten football programs. [[Urban Meyer]] is now 5\u20130 against the Illini, while this was Illinois coach [[Lovie Smith]]'s first game against the Buckeyes.\n\nThe Buckeye offense came out and struck quickly by scoring on their first drive by a 25-yard [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] touchdown run. Ohio State's defense, matched the effort by forcing what would be the first of many three-and-outs. The following drive also resulted in a touchdown following a 6 play, 71-yard drive, capped by [[J.T. Barrett]]'s ninth rushing touchdown of the season. Ohio State would go on to score two more touchdowns in the first quarter, one by a pass from Barrett to Binjimen Victor and the other by a 43-yard Weber run. Illinois would fail to convert a first down, giving the Buckeyes a 28\u20130 lead at the end of the first quarter.\n\nOhio State was able to add a 33-year Sean Nuernberger field goal at the beginning of the second period, followed soon after by another OSU drive that ended with a [[J. K. Dobbins]] touchdown run, which would be the last time the primary starters would see the game in the first half. Ohio State would fail to score on a drive for the first time during their last possession, while Illinois would gain their only first down of the opening half. Ohio State would go into halftime with a 38\u20130 lead as heavy rain began to fall.\n\nOhio State's defense mounted another three-and-out to start the second half, but the offense was apparently effected by the rain when back-up quarterback Dwayne Haskins fumbled the ball and it was returned 54-yards by Ahmari Hayes for Illinois' first score. Ohio State's offensive starters went back into the game but were forced to punt. Luckily for the Buckeyes, the punt was muffed and recovered by Ohio State that led to a Barrett touchdown pass to tight end Marcus Ball. Ohio State led 45\u20137 at this point and would be the last time the offensive starters saw the field. The teams traded punts to close out the third quarter.\n\nAfter a short performance by back-up quarterback, Joe Burrow, Haskins went back in the game which resulted in a 21-yard touchdown pass to Victor. The Illini would match the result with their only offensive touchdown on a 65-yard drive to make the score 52\u201314. Neither team would score again to make that the final.\n\nOhio State would only allow three first downs and it was the sixth game of the season that they allowed less than 100 rushing yards and the fifth game they allowed less than 100 passing yards.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/ncf/boxscore/_/id/400935394|title=Penn State vs. Ohio State \u2013 Box Score \u2013 October 28, 2017 \u2013 ESPN|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-10-30}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!ILL\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|543\n|105\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|218\n|16\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|325\n|89\n|-\n|Penalties\n|7\u201368\n|7\u201355\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|1\n|1\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|37:16\n|22:44\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!ILL\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.T.

The No. 9 Ohio State Buckeyes defeated the Michigan Wolverines by a score of 31\u201320.\n\nOhio State and Michigan both started off slowly by forcing three-and-outs on each team's opening drive before the Wolverines mounted a nearly six minute, 13-play, 77-yard drive that resulted in a touchdown. Ohio State was again forced with another three-and-out that was followed by a Michigan drive that ended in a punt that pinned the Buckeye's deep. Ohio State was forced to punt and was returned 42-yards by Michigan wide receiver [[Donovan Peoples-Jones]], additionally, Ohio State committed a block in the back which gave the Wolverines the ball at the five-yard line. Michigan was able to take a 14\u20130 lead when quarterback [[John O'Korn]] completed a three-yard pass to Sean McKeon. Ohio State was held to \u22126 yard in the first quarter and was the first time since 2010 that Ohio State had been held to negative yardage in a quarter. The Ohio State offense and the rushing attack of [[J. T. Barrett]] and [[J. K. Dobbins]] came alive on the following drive when the two gained 71 yards on the ground that ended with a 21-yard Barrett touchdown run. Following a Michigan punt, Ohio State was able to move the ball again behind Barrett when he ran for 26 yards and threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to tight end Marcus Baugh, tying the game at 14. Neither team would score again in the first half.\n\nOhio State again started off slow by being forced to consecutive three-and-outs, while Michigan was able to score on a 2-yard [[Karan Higdon]] touchdown run. Ohio State linebacker, Chris Worley, was able to block the PAT and Michigan led 20\u201314. The Buckeyes answered back when Ohio State mounted a 78-yard touchdown drive capped by a 1-yard Dobbins touchdown run. Unfortunately for the Buckeyes, Barrett was injured during the drive and was forced out for the remainder of the game. RS Freshman, Dwayne Haskins gained 24 yards on the ground and 31 in the air on the drive that gave the Buckeyes a one-point, 21\u201320 lead. The Wolverines were unable to capitalize on the following possession and Ohio State was able to tack on a 44-yard Sean Nuernberger field goal, increasing the lead to four.  Michigan drove the ball 36-yards on their next possession, but turned the ball over on downs following an O'Korn sack and two additional incomplete passes. The Buckeyes drove again and Nuernberger missed only his third field goal of the season on a 43-yard attempt. The following play, O'Korn committed the only turnover of the game when he threw an interception to Jordan Fuller. On Ohio State's next possession, Dobbins ran for 41 yards and [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] was able to seal the game by scoring a 25-yard touchdown run with 1:44 remaining in the game, to make what would be the final score, 31\u201320.\n\nMichigan coach [[Jim Harbaugh]] dropped to 0\u20133 versus the Buckeyes, while [[Urban Meyer]] moved to 6\u20130 against the Wolverines. The current winning streak is tied for the second-longest in the series and tied for the longest for Ohio State with the 2004\u20132009 games. J.T. Barrett became the only quarterback in the series history to have four wins versus the other and moved Ohio State into first place in the number of all-time Big Ten wins. Ohio State clinched their first outright divisional title since 2014 and faced Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship Game. Ohio State's ranking would remain unchanged in the AP Poll at No. 8 and they would move up one spot to No. 7 in the Coaches Poll.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MICH\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|350\n|295\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|124\n|195\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|226\n|100\n|-\n|Penalties\n|9\u201375\n|6\u201350\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|0\n|1\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|31:17\n|28:43\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MICH\n|-\n|Passing\n|Dwayne Haskins (94)\n|[[John O'Korn]] (195)\n|-\n|Rushing\n|[[J.

Urban Meyer is now 5\u20130 versus the Badgers, with two of the victories coming in overtime. [[Paul Chryst]] fell to 0\u20132 versus the Buckeyes. This was Ohio State's third appearance in the Championship game and Wisconsin's fifth, including their second straight.\n\nThe Badgers began the game with the ball and were forced to punt after a three-and-out with the reverse result happening on the Buckeyes' first possession as well. Wisconsin would then follow with a 55-yard drive that ended with an interception in Wisconsin's redzone thrown by [[Alex Hornibrook]] to Denzel Ward at OSU's 4-yard line. [[J. T. Barrett]] would rush for a total of 12 yards before hitting Terry McLaurin for an 84-yard touchdown pass giving the Buckeyes an early 7\u20130 lead. The pass from Barrett to McLaurin was the longest play committed against the Badgers' defense all season. The following Wisconsin drive lasted for 7 plays and 44 yards and a punt trapped the Buckeyes on their own two-yard line. Barrett would go on to throw an interception to Wisconsin linebacker Andrew Van Ginkel that was returned for a touchdown, tying the game at 7\u20137. Ohio State would bounce back quickly and score on a Barrett to Parris Campbell, 57-yard touchdown pass, once again regaining the lead 14\u20137 and bringing an end to the first quarter.\n\nOhio State wand Wisconsin traded punts to open the second quarter, but the Buckeyes would strike again with a Barrett 1-yard touchdown run that was set up by a 77-yard rush by [[J. K. Dobbins]].  On Ohio State's second possession of the second quarter, [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] would commit his first fumble of the year that was recovered by Van Ginkel that would lead to a 28-yard field goal, making the score 21\u201310 in favor of the Buckeyes. Ohio State would attempt to add to their lead, but Sean Nuernberger's 43-yard field goal was blocked as time expired.\n\nWhile Ohio State couldn't amount a drive to open the second half, Wisconsin was able to convert a 46-yard field goal to narrow the lead to 8, which was quickly matched by the Buckeyes thanks to a 53-yard Dobbins run and a 27-yard Nuernberger field goal. Punts were traded after several three-and-outs both teams until Wisconsin began an 11-play, 52-yard drive that started with a Barrett interception that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by Chris James and a successful 2-point conversion. The score narrowed to 24\u201321 favoring Ohio State. The Buckeyes followed with a 15-play drive that took 5:20 off the clock and tacked on a 20-yard Ohio State field goal to increase the lead back to 6. The Buckeyes and the Badgers again traded punts and with 1:50 left in the game, Wisconsin would begin their final offensive drive. Wisconsin would secure two first downs bringing them to mid-field. A holding penalty on Wisconsin on first down would force a first and 20. Hornibrook would throw three incomplete passes until he threw an interception to Damon Webb. Ohio State was able to run out the clock and secure their 36th Big Ten Title.\n\n[[J. K. Dobbins]] would be named the MVP of the game which was the first time a Freshman earned the award. He would also become the all-time leading Freshman rusher in Ohio State history, passing [[Maurice Clarett]]. Ohio State would go on to be ranked No. 5 in the final CFP poll and miss the playoffs while Wisconsin would fall to No. 6. It was announced on December 3, that No. 5 Ohio State would face No. 8 USC in the [[2017 Cotton Bowl Classic (December)|Cotton Bowl Classic]].\n\n'''Game Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!WISC\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|449\n|298\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|211\n|238\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|238\n|60\n|-\n|Penalties\n|5\u201348\n|6\u201355\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|3\n|2\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|25:65\n|34:06\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!WISC\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.

This was the first time that the Buckeyes defeated the Trojans since 1974, which broke a seven-game USC win-streak.\n\nOhio State and their Silver Bullet defense proved to be a tough match for USC. On the third play of the game, Ohio State's Kendall Sheffield was able to strip the ball from USC wide receiver [[Deontay Burnett]] which was recovered and advanced 20 yards by Ohio State's Damon Webb. This set up a short five-play drive that resulted in a [[J. T. Barrett]] 1-yard touchdown run. Punts were traded a few times by both teams until the Buckeyes produced an 83-yard drive that tacked on a 26-yard Sean Nuernberger field goal at the beginning of the second quarter to five OSU a 10\u20130 lead. The following play, [[Sam Darnold]] threw an interception to Ohio State's Damon Webb which was returned for a 23-yard touchdown giving the Buckeyes a 17\u20130 lead. Again, both teams traded punts and USC fumbled the ball which set up a 59-yard Buckeye drive that ended with a 28-yard Barrett touchdown run giving the Buckeyes a 24-point lead. USC was able to find the scoreboard in the second quarter when K.J. Hill fumbled a punt return which set up a 15-yard drive, capped by a one-yard [[Ronald Jones II]] touchdown run.  The score at half would be 24\u20137 favoring Ohio State.\n\nOffensively, the Buckeyes remained quiet the second half by having all but one drive ending in a punt. USC was able to  drive deep into Buckeye territory three times, but a missed field goal, a fumble and a failed fourth-down conversion didn't allow the Trojans to score any points. The final score would end as 24\u20137.\n\nBarrett and Webb were named the Offensive and Defensive MVPs respectively. Barrett also passed [[Drew Brees]] for the Big Ten record of most offensive yards in a career.\n\n'''Game Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!USC\n|-\n|Total Yards\n|277\n|413\n|-\n|Passing Yards\n|114\n|356\n|-\n|Rushing Yards\n|163\n|57\n|-\n|Penalties\n|3\u201330\n|3\u201335\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|1\n|4\n|-\n|Time of Possession\n|25:04\n|34:56\n|}\n'''Game Leaders'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!USC\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.

''Charmante'' returned to Lorient to bring the news of the engagement, while the other survivors sailed on to Isle de France.

En route, d'Orves changed his objectif from [[Trincomalee]] to [[Madras]].<ref name=cunat97>Cunat, p.97</ref><ref group=Note>Present-day [[Chennai]]</ref> On 19 January, ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' detected a strange sail, and d'Orves detached ''H\u00e9ros'' and ''Art\u00e9sien'' to investigate. Suffren closed in, making signals according to tables captured at Porto Praya on the East Indiaman [[Hinchinbrooke (1780 ship)|''Hinchinbrooke'']], until the ship made signals that he was unable to answer. A chase ensued, and with the night Suffren abandonned the pursuit to rejoin the fleet. On 21, the fleet encountered the same ship again, and again detached ''H\u00e9ros'', ''Art\u00e9sien'' and ''Vengeur'', but this time with other ships deploying as to ensure communication between the pursuers and the main body of the fleet, allowing Suffren to press on his chase. Suffren caught up with his quarry on 22 around noon and forced her to surrender.

The fleet arrived North of Madras on 5 February 1782, and its light units started praying on coastal merchantmen and capturing cargo of rice.<ref name=cunat101>Cunat, p.101</ref> However, the [[monsoon]] caused strong winds from the South which trapped the French North of Madras, while at the same time favouring the return of Hughes' squadron from Ceylon to Madras.<ref name=cunat102>Cunat, p.102</ref> Upon Hughes' arrival, [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney|Lord Macartney]] warned him of the presence of the French squadron, and Hughes anchored his ships under the protection of [[Fort St. George, India|Fort St. George]] and [[George Town, Chennai|Black Town]]. On 9 February 1782, Hughes received reinforcements with the arrival of a squadron comprising the 64-gun [[HMS Monmouth (1772)|HMS ''Monmouth'']], the [[74-gun]] [[HMS Hero (1759)|''Hero'']], the 50-gun [[HMS Isis (1774)|''Isis'']] and the armed transport ''Manilla'', under [[James Alms]]. \n\nD'Orves died the same day at 1600. Suffren re-appointed his captains to the ships of the squadon: Captain de Lapalli\u00e8re{{refn|Sometimes spelt \"la Palli\u00e8re\"<ref name=cunat104 />|group=Note}} took command of ''Orient'' and Cillart that of ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re''; Captain [[Justin Bonaventure Morard de Galles|Morard de Galles]], of ''Pourvoyeuse'', and Lieutenant de Ruyter, in temporary command of ''Petit Annibal'', exchanged their positions; Beaulieu went on ''Bellone'';<ref name=cunat103>Cunat, p.103</ref>  Tromelin (the Younger) took on ''Subtile''; and Galifet took ''Sylphide''. General Duchemin transfered from ''Orient'' to ''H\u00e9ros''.<ref name=cunat104>Cunat, p.104</ref>\n\nOn 14 February, usual monsoon wind from the North-East resumed, allowing Suffren's squadron to sail South. In the evening, [[French frigate Fine (1779)|''Fine'']], under Perrier de Salvert, came in view of Madras harbour and Hughes' squadron. Seeing Hugues anchored in a very strong defensive position, Suffren decided to sail off the coast, <ref name=cunat105>Cunat, p.105</ref> but to his surprise, Hugues left the safety of the forts and gave chase.<ref name=cunat106>Cunat, p.106</ref> Suffren deployed a frigate screen to warn his squadron of Hugues' moves, but during the night ''Pourvoyeuse'' drifted away from the fleet due to a navigation error, while  ''Fine'' lost sight of the British ships, and both thus failed to keep Suffren appraised of Hughes's position.<ref name=cunat108>Cunat, p.108</ref> In the morning, signals from ''Fine'' informed Suffren that HMS ''Montmouth'', ''Hero'', ''Isis'', ''Aigle'' and ''Burford'' where approaching the French transports. Suffren rushed with his warships to protect the convoy, and Hughes ordered his ships to regroup and form a [[line of battle]].<ref name=cunat109>Cunat, p.109</ref> In the morning of 17 February, the fleets were about 6 km apart{{refn|one [[League (unit)|League]] and a half<ref name=cunat109 />|group=Note}}, the British forming a line and had captured ''Lawriston'', while the French were scattered due to an error in interpreting night signals. Suffren formed a line without consideration for the order of battle,<ref name=cunat111>Cunat, p.111</ref> and at 1500 he closed in within gun range, starting the [[Battle of Sadras]].\n\nSuffren sustained about 30 men killed and 100 wounded,<ref name=cunat115>Cunat, p.115</ref> and light damage to his riggings.<ref name=cunat116>Cunat, p.116</ref> At 1900 he broke contact.<ref name=cunat115 />\n\n==== Battle of Providien ====\n{{Main|Battle of Providien}}\nThe [[Battle of Providien]] on April 12 near [[Trincomalee]]; \n\n==== Battle of Negapatam ====\n{{Main|Battle of Negapatam (1782)}}\nthe [[Battle of Negapatam (1782)]] on July 6 off [[Cuddalore]], after which Suffren seized upon the anchorage of Trincomalee compelling the small British garrison to surrender; \n==== Battle of Trincomalee ====\n{{Main|Battle of Trincomalee}}\nand finally the [[Battle of Trincomalee]] near that port on September 3. No ship was lost by either side in any of these battles.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHis activity encouraged [[Hyder Ali]], who was then at war with the [[British East India Company]]. He refused to return to the islands for the purpose of escorting the troops coming out under command of Bussy, maintaining that his proper purpose was to cripple the squadron of Sir Edward Hughes. During the north-east monsoon he would not go to the islands but refitted in the Malay ports in Sumatra, and returned with the south-west [[monsoon]] in 1783. Hyder Ali was dead, but [[Tipu Sahib|Tipu Sultan]], his son, was still at war with the Company. Bussy arrived and landed. He was slack in his conduct of the operations on shore, which hampered Suffren. \n\n==== Battle of Cuddalore ====\n{{Main|Battle of Cuddalore (1783)}}\nStill, when Suffren met Hughes at the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] (20 April 1783), with fifteen ships to eighteen, Suffren forced Hughes to retire to Madras, leaving the army then besieging C\u00fcddalore in a very dangerous position. The arrival of the news that peace had been made in Europe put a stop to hostilities, and Suffren returned to France.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n===Death===\nWhile refitting at the Cape on his way home, several of the vessels also returning put in, and the captains waited on him. Suffren said in one of his letters that their praise gave him more pleasure than any other compliment paid him. In France he was received with enthusiasm, and in 1781 he succeeded Comte d'Aubigny unopposed to the office of vice-[[admiral of France]] (Ponant or the Atlantic). He had been promoted bailli in the Order of Malta during his absence. His death occurred very suddenly, when he was about to take command of a fleet collected in Brest. He died of apoplexy, due to a \"gout travelling upwards added to a putrid abscess\"<ref>Letter of Suffren's valet, quote in Glachant, p.377; quoted in Taillemite, p.323</ref><ref group=Note>\"''Goutte remont\u00e9e jointe \u00e0 un abc\u00e8s putride</ref>\n\nA legend has it that many years afterwards his body servant told M. Jal, the historiographer of the French navy, that he had been killed in a duel by the Prince de Mirepoix. The cause of the encounter, according to the servant, was that Suffren had refused in very strong language to use his influence to secure the restoration to the navy of two of the prince's relations who had been dismissed for misconduct.\n\n==Legacy==\nSuffren was crippled to a large extent by the want of loyal and capable co-operation on the part of his captains. This was, in no small part, his own fault: his bullying and openly expressed contempt for his subordinates undermined their support for him in battle, depriving him of the successes which his undoubted tactical ability and determination might otherwise have made possible. He had, however, an indefatigable energy, a wealth of resource and a thorough understanding of the fact that success at sea is won by defeating an enemy and not by merely outmanoeuvering him. This made him a formidable foe.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Suffren was perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref>\n \nSuffren's achievements may seem modest but even this record stands in stark contrast to the failures of most contemporary French naval commanders. Any assessment must acknowledge that he succeeded at the tasks assigned to him. He  revived French fortunes in India when Paris had conceived his tasks as essentially ones of armed transportation and privateering. That his achievement went beyond these duties despite a lack of support from his uncomprehending superiors and battle shy captains adds greatly to his credit and  perhaps explains his personal fury. Ironically, if anybody learned from his example, it was the British, who were confirmed in their longstanding policy of seeking outright victory in naval engagements. French military policy made naval operations subordinate to land operations, yet Suffren realized that in wars fought overseas from the mother country, the nation which controlled the sea first had a great advantage in supporting the land war:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports. That this diagnosis was correct is as certain as that it reversed the common French maxims, which would have put the port first and the fleet second as objectives.<ref>Mahan, A.T., ''The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660\u20131783, p. 433 {{ISBN|0-486-25509-3}}</ref>}}\n\nSeven ships of the French Navy have been named ''Suffren'' in honour of Suffren de Saint Tropez.

The cause of the encounter, according to the servant, was that Suffren had refused in very strong language to use his influence to secure the restoration to the navy of two of the prince's relations who had been dismissed for misconduct.\n\n==Legacy==\nSuffren was crippled to a large extent by the want of loyal and capable co-operation on the part of his captains. This was, in no small part, his own fault: his bullying and openly expressed contempt for his subordinates undermined their support for him in battle, depriving him of the successes which his undoubted tactical ability and determination might otherwise have made possible. He had, however, an indefatigable energy, a wealth of resource and a thorough understanding of the fact that success at sea is won by defeating an enemy and not by merely outmanoeuvering him. This made him a formidable foe.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Suffren was perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref>\n \nSuffren's achievements may seem modest but even this record stands in stark contrast to the failures of most contemporary French naval commanders. Any assessment must acknowledge that he succeeded at the tasks assigned to him. He  revived French fortunes in India when Paris had conceived his tasks as essentially ones of armed transportation and privateering. That his achievement went beyond these duties despite a lack of support from his uncomprehending superiors and battle shy captains adds greatly to his credit and  perhaps explains his personal fury. Ironically, if anybody learned from his example, it was the British, who were confirmed in their longstanding policy of seeking outright victory in naval engagements. French military policy made naval operations subordinate to land operations, yet Suffren realized that in wars fought overseas from the mother country, the nation which controlled the sea first had a great advantage in supporting the land war:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports. That this diagnosis was correct is as certain as that it reversed the common French maxims, which would have put the port first and the fleet second as objectives.<ref>Mahan, A.T., ''The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660\u20131783, p. 433 {{ISBN|0-486-25509-3}}</ref>}}\n\nSeven ships of the French Navy have been named ''Suffren'' in honour of Suffren de Saint Tropez.

He was named after his father, Mirche Atsev, who was a well-known voyvoda. He schooled himself in Prilep and then he worked as a shepherd. After Turks murdered his father, he joined the [[Hayduk]]'s band of [[Kone Pavlov]] in 1885. However, in the next year, he was arrested and imprisoned in [[Thessaloniki|Solun]]. After having escaped from the prison, Atsev moved to [[Bulgaria]]. During his stay in [[Sofia]], he was accused of involvement in the murder of [[Stefan Stambolov]], as a result of which he was imprisoned for three years in ''the Black Mosque'', (now [[Sveti Sedmochislenitsi Church]]). In Sofia, together with his brothers [[Petar Atsev|Petar]] and [[Georgi Atsev|Georgi]], he joined the revolutionary activity of the IMARO against the [[Turkey|Turkish]] authorities.

He was named after his father, Mirche Atsev, who was a well-known voyvoda. He schooled himself in Prilep and then he worked as a shepherd. After Turks murdered his father, he joined the [[Hayduk]]'s band of [[Kone Pavlov]] in 1885. Houever, in the next year, he was arrested and imprisoned in [[Thessaloniki|Solun]]. After having escaped from the prison, Atsev moved to [[Bulgaria]]. During his stay in [[Sofia]], he was accused of involvement in the murder of [[Stefan Stambolov]], as a result of which he was imprisoned for three years in ''the Black Mosque'', (now [[Sveti Sedmochislenitsi Church]]). In Sofia, together with his brothers [[Petar Atsev|Petar]] and [[Georgi Atsev|Georgi]], he joined the revolutionary activity of the IMARO against the [[Turkey|Turkish]] authorities.

The show relates the main events that happened in Colombia during this period and Escobar's relationship to them. It is told through the perspective of [[Stephen Murphy (civil servant)|Steve Murphy]], an American DEA agent working in Colombia. The series depicts how Escobar first became involved in the cocaine trade in Colombia. He was an established [[black market]]eer in [[Medell\u00edn]], moving trucks worth of illegal goods (alcohol, cigarettes, and household appliances) into Colombia during a time when this was strictly forbidden, when introduced to Mateo \"Cockroach\" Moreno, a [[Chile]]an exile and underground chemist, who pitched the idea that they go into business together, with Moreno producing and Escobar distributing a new, profitable drug\u2014cocaine. \n\nThey expand beyond Moreno's small cocaine processing lab by building additional, larger labs in the rainforest and, using the expertise of [[Carlos Lehder]], transport their product in bulk to Miami, where it gains notoriety amongst the rich and famous. Soon enough, Pablo develops larger labs and more extensive distribution routes into the United States to supply growing demand. With cocaine's growth into a drug of importance in the American market, one that accounts for a large flow of U.S. dollars to Colombia and escalating drug-related violence in the United States, the Americans send a task force from the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] to Colombia to address the issue. Murphy is partnered with [[Javier Pe\u00f1a]]. The purpose of Murphy's task force is to work with the Colombian authorities, led by Colonel Carrillo, to put an end to the flow of cocaine into the United States. The season ends with Escobar's escape from prison.\n\n===Season 2 (2016)===\n{{main|Narcos (season 2)}}\n\nSeason 2 continues where season 1 ended. Soldiers find Escobar and his entourage right outside the perimeter of '[[La Catedral]]' prison but are too petrified of Escobar to make an arrest. At the embassy, the United States sends a new ambassador who brings the CIA into play. In the beginning, little change occurs for Escobar, as he still has the loyalty of his cartel. This loyalty, however, starts to slip as Escobar needs more time and resources to hide from the government. Among the tricks he uses to avoid being seen are riding around town in the trunk of a taxi cab and using young lookouts to report police movements to him.\n\nInitially, Escobar easily adapts to his new life, giving money to the community while ruthlessly killing those who try to break away from his empire. The Colombian police and Escobar engage in massive battles, resulting in high tension and unrest in Colombia. Escobar's rivals in the [[Cali Cartel|Cali cartel]] form an unlikely alliance with ousted members of his own cartel, as well as with a CIA-backed anticommunist paramilitary group. Agent Pe\u00f1a secretly works with this group, who kill members of Pablo's organization and claim responsibility as \"[[Los Pepes]]\". \n\nAfter two of Escobar's top cartel members are caught and betray him, Escobar goes on the run. His bodyguard and he hide in a safehouse, where he celebrates his 44th birthday. When Pablo tries to make contact with his family, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] and military track him down via radio triangulation and corner him on the rooftops. Pablo is hit twice in the ensuing shootout, and although he might have survived his injuries, a Colombian policeman named Trujillo executes him, amidst shouts of \"Viva Colombia!\" \n\nEscobar's wife Tata goes to the Cali cartel for their help in leaving the country. Pe\u00f1a returns to the United States, in expectation of being reprimanded by the disciplinary committee for his associations with Los Pepes, but is surprised when asked to provide intelligence against the Cali cartel, implying his future involvement with the DEA.\n\n===Season 3 (2017)===\n{{main|Narcos (season 3)}}\nSeason 3 was released on September 1, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|website=Netflix|title=Narcos {{!}} Season 3 Teaser [HD] |date=July 14, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j73-IvTvNN0|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}</ref> The story continues after Pablo Escobar's death and shows the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]]'s fight against the [[Cali Cartel|Cali cartel]]. With Escobar out of the way, business for the cartel is booming, with new markets in the United States and elsewhere. To everyone's surprise, Gilberto Rodr\u00edguez Orejuela, the leader of the Cali cartel, announces that within 6 months, the cartel will leave the cocaine business entirely to focus on legal business interests. The decision is met with mixed reactions within the cartel.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main cast===\n* [[Wagner Moura]] as [[Pablo Escobar]] \u2013 a Colombian drug lord and the leader of the [[Medell\u00edn Cartel]] (seasons 1\u20132)\n* [[Boyd Holbrook]] as [[Stephen Murphy (civil servant)|Steve Murphy]] \u2013 a DEA agent tasked to bring down Escobar (seasons 1\u20132)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wegotthiscovered.com/tv/boyd-holbrook-wont-return-narcos-season-3/ |title=Boyd Holbrook Won't Return For Narcos Season 3 |accessdate=March 7, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Pedro Pascal]] as [[Javier Pe\u00f1a]] \u2013 a DEA agent given the task to bringing down Escobar and in season 3 the Cali Cartel (seasons 1\u20133) \n* [[Joanna Christie]] as Connie Murphy \u2013 Steve's wife, a nurse who works in the local hospital (seasons 1\u20132)\n* [[Maurice Compte]] as Colonel Horacio Carrillo \u2013 a Colombian police chief and commander of Search Bloc<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11776380/The-terrible-reign-of-cocaine-king-Pablo-Escobar.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=November 19, 2015|title=The terrible reign of cocaine king Pablo Escobar|first=Chris|last=Harvey|date=August 1, 2015}}</ref><ref name=pascal2>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/news/a602504/maurice-compte-boards-the-netflix-series-narcos.html#~oVxdhlMLYwDF3q|title=Maurice Compte boards the Netflix series Narcos|website=Digital Spy|date=October 10, 2014}}</ref> (main season 1, recurring season 2)\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Mattos]] as [[Jorge Luis Ochoa V\u00e1squez|Jorge Ochoa]] \u2013 founding member and former leader of the Medell\u00edn cartel (season 1)\n* Roberto Urbina as [[Fabio Ochoa V\u00e1squez|Fabio Ochoa]] \u2013 a high-ranking member of the Medell\u00edn cartel (season 1)\n* Diego Cata\u00f1o as Juan Diego \"La Quica\" D\u00edaz \u2013 an assassin routinely hired by the Medell\u00edn, based on [[Dandeny Mu\u00f1oz Mosquera]] (main season 1, recurring season 2)\n* Jorge A.

Critic Scott Tobias of ''The New York Times'' wrote, \u201cSetting aside the \u201cGoodfellas\u201d narration, the earliest episodes of \u201cNarcos\u201d were distinguished by a meat-and-potatoes approach to the crime genre that rebuffed the slickness that usually comes with the territory.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tobias |first1=Scott |title=Narcos' Season 3: Watched It All?

The show relates the main events that happened in Colombia during this period and Escobar's relationship to them. It is told through the perspective of [[Stephen Murphy (civil servant)|Steve Murphy]], an American DEA agent working in Colombia. The series depicts how Escobar first became involved in the cocaine trade in Colombia. He was an established [[black market]]eer in [[Medell\u00edn]], moving trucks worth of illegal goods (alcohol, cigarettes, and household appliances) into Colombia during a time when this was strictly forbidden, when introduced to Mateo \"Cockroach\" Moreno, a [[Chile]]an exile and underground chemist, who pitched the idea that they go into business together, with Moreno producing and Escobar distributing a new, profitable drug\u2014cocaine. \n\nThey expand beyond Moreno's small cocaine processing lab by building additional, larger labs in the rainforest and, using the expertise of [[Carlos Lehder]], transport their product in bulk to Miami, where it gains notoriety amongst the rich and famous. Soon enough, Pablo develops larger labs and more extensive distribution routes into the United States to supply growing demand. With cocaine's growth into a drug of importance in the American market, one that accounts for a large flow of U.S. dollars to Colombia and escalating drug-related violence in the United States, the Americans send a task force from the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] to Colombia to address the issue. Murphy is partnered with [[Javier Pe\u00f1a]]. The purpose of Murphy's task force is to work with the Colombian authorities, led by Colonel Carrillo, to put an end to the flow of cocaine into the United States. The season ends with Escobar's escape from prison.\n\n===Season 2 (2016)===\n{{main|Narcos (season 2)}}\n\nSeason 2 continues where season 1 ended. Soldiers find Escobar and his entourage right outside the perimeter of '[[La Catedral]]' prison but are too petrified of Escobar to make an arrest. At the embassy, the United States sends a new ambassador who brings the CIA into play. In the beginning, little change occurs for Escobar, as he still has the loyalty of his cartel. This loyalty, however, starts to slip as Escobar needs more time and resources to hide from the government. Among the tricks he uses to avoid being seen are riding around town in the trunk of a taxi cab and using young lookouts to report police movements to him.\n\nInitially, Escobar easily adapts to his new life, giving money to the community while ruthlessly killing those who try to break away from his empire. The Colombian police and Escobar engage in massive battles, resulting in high tension and unrest in Colombia. Escobar's rivals in the [[Cali Cartel|Cali cartel]] form an unlikely alliance with ousted members of his own cartel, as well as with a CIA-backed anticommunist paramilitary group. Agent Pe\u00f1a secretly works with this group, who kill members of Pablo's organization and claim responsibility as \"[[Los Pepes]]\". \n\nAfter two of Escobar's top cartel members are caught and betray him, Escobar goes on the run. His bodyguard and he hide in a safehouse, where he celebrates his 44th birthday. When Pablo tries to make contact with his family, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] and military track him down via radio triangulation and corner him on the rooftops. Pablo is hit twice in the ensuing shootout, and although he might have survived his injuries, a Colombian policeman named Trujillo executes him, amidst shouts of \"Viva Colombia!\" \n\nEscobar's wife Tata goes to the Cali cartel for their help in leaving the country. Pe\u00f1a returns to the United States, in expectation of being reprimanded by the disciplinary committee for his associations with Los Pepes, but is surprised when asked to provide intelligence against the Cali cartel, implying his future involvement with the DEA.\n\n===Season 3 (2017)===\n{{main|Narcos (season 3)}}\nSeason 3 was released on September 1, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|website=Netflix|title=Narcos {{!}} Season 3 Teaser [HD] |date=July 14, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j73-IvTvNN0|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}</ref> The story continues after Pablo Escobar's death and shows the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]]'s fight against the [[Cali Cartel|Cali cartel]].
