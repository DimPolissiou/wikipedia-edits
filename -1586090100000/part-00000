It lasted from 241 to late 238 or early 237 BC and ended with Carthage suppressing both the mutiny and the revolt.\n\nThe war began as a dispute over the payment of wages owed to the foreign soldiers who had fought for Carthage during the [[First Punic War]]. When a compromise seemed to have been reached the army erupted into full-scale mutiny under the leadership of [[Spendius]] and [[Mathos|Matho]]. 70,000 Africans from Carthage's oppressed dependant territories flocked to join them, bringing supplies and finance. War-weary Carthage fared poorly in the initial engagements of the war, especially under the generalship of [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno]]. [[Hamilcar Barca]], a veteran of the campaigns in [[Sicily]] (and father of [[Hannibal Barca]]), was given joint and then supreme command. He campaigned successfully, initially demonstrating lenience in an attempt to woo the rebels over. To prevent this Spendius tortured 700 Carthaginian prisoners to death, and henceforth the war was pursued with great brutality.\n\nBy early 237 BC, after numerous setbacks, the rebels were defeated and their cities brought back under Carthaginian rule. An expedition was prepared to reoccupy [[Sardinia]], where mutinous soldiers had slaughtered all Carthaginians. However, Rome declared that this would be an act of war and occupied both Sardinia and [[Corsica]], in contravention of the recent peace treaty. This has been considered to be the single greatest cause of war with Carthage breaking out again in 218 BC in the [[Second Punic War]].\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:Stele des Polybios.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting a man in classical Greek clothing raising one arm|{{center|Polybius}}]]\n\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[First Punic War]]{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Jones|Sidwell|2003|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa}}118 BC), a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known today for [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after this war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} Only part of the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with this war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the war in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Craige Champion describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Champion|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} Modern historians also take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other that Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}} Other sources include inscriptions, coins and archaeological evidence.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}}\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe First Punic War was fought between [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] and [[Roman Republic|Rome]], the two main powers of the western [[Mediterranean]] in the early 3rd century BC, and lasted for 23 years, from 264 to 241 BC. Rome still exists as the capital of Italy, while Carthage was razed by Rome in a [[Third Punic War|later war]]; its ruins lie {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}} east of modern [[Tunis]] on the North African coast. The two powers struggled for supremacy primarily on the Mediterranean island of [[Sicily]] and its surrounding waters, and also in [[North Africa]].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=82}} It was the longest continuous conflict and greatest naval war of antiquity. After immense material and human losses on both sides, the Carthaginians were defeated.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} The Carthaginian Senate ordered the commander of its forces on Sicily, [[Hamilcar Barca]] to negotiate a peace treaty; he delegated this to his deputy [[Gisco (died 239 BC)|Gisco]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=206}} The [[Treaty of Lutatius]] was signed and brought the First Punic War to its end. By the treaty's terms Carthage evacuated Sicily, handed over all prisoners taken during the war, and paid an [[indemnity]] of 3,200 talents{{#tag:ref|3,200 talents was approximately {{convert|81|lt|kg|disp=flip}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}}{{snd}}1,000 talents of this was due immediately, the balance over ten years.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}}\n\nWhile the war with Rome was being played out, the Carthaginian general [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno]] was leading a series of campaigns which greatly increased the area of Africa controlled by Carthage. He extended its control to [[Theveste]] (modern [[T\u00e9bessa]], [[Algeria]]) {{convert|300|km}} south-west of their capital.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=99}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=205}} Hanno was rigorous in squeezing taxes out of the newly conquered territory in order to pay for both the war with Rome and his own campaigns.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=205}} Half of all agricultural output was taken as war tax, and the tribute previously due from towns and cities was doubled. These exactions were harshly enforced, causing extreme hardship in many areas.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=114}}{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=6}}\n[[File:Troupes carthaginoises Arverniales 2012.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.15|alt=A group of men dressed in clothes and carrying weapons from the 3rd century BC accompanying a medium-sized elephant|{{center|Modern recreations of Carthaginian soldiers and a [[war elephant]]}}]]\n\nCarthaginian armies were nearly always composed of foreigners; citizens only served in the army if there was a direct threat to the city of Carthage. The majority of these foreigners were from North Africa.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=567}} [[Libyans]] provided close-order infantry equipped with large shields, helmets, short swords and long thrusting [[spear]]s; as well as close-order shock cavalry carrying spears{{snd}}both were noted for their discipline and staying power.

The evacuation of the Carthaginian army of 20,000 men from Sicily was left in the hands of Gesco. Not wishing the freshly idle soldiers to combine for purposes of their own, Gisco split the army into small detachments based on their regions of origin. He sent these back to Carthage one at a time. He anticipated they would be promptly paid the several years back pay they were owed and hurried on their way home.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=133}} The Carthaginian authorities decided to instead wait until all of the troops had arrived and then attempt to negotiate a settlement at a lower rate. Meanwhile, as each group arrived it was billeted inside the city of Carthage where the advantages of civilisation were appreciated to the full after up to eight years under siege. So much so, that before the full 20,000 had arrived they were relocated to Sicca Veneria (modern [[El Kef]]) {{convert|180|km}} away, even though a significant portion of their arrears had to be paid before they would go.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=112}} \n\nFreed of their long period of military discipline and with nothing to do, the men grumbled among themselves and refused all attempts by the Carthaginians to pay them less than the full amount due. Frustrated by the Carthaginian negotiators' attempts to haggle, all 20,000 troops marched to Tunis, {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}} from Carthage. Panicking, the Senate agreed to payment in full. The [[Mutiny|mutinous]] troops responded by demanding even more. Gisco, who had a good reputation with the army, was brought over from Sicily in late 241 BC and despatched to the camp with enough money to pay most of what was owed. He started to disburse this, with promises that the balance would be paid as soon as it could be raised. The discontent seemed to have abated when, for some unknown reason, discipline broke down. Several soldiers insisted that no deal with Carthage was acceptable, a riot broke out, dissenters were stoned to death, Gesco and his staff were taken prisoner and his treasury was seized. [[Spendius]], an escaped Roman slave who faced death by torture if he were recaptured, and [[Mathos|Matho]], an African dissatisfied with Hanno's attitude towards tax raising from Carthage's African possessions, were declared generals. The news of a formed, experienced, anti-Carthaginian army in the heart of its territory spread rapidly and many cities and towns rose in rebellion. Provisions, money and reinforcements poured in; an additional 70,000 men according to Polybius.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=112\u2013114}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=133\u2013134}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=371}} The pay dispute had become a full-scale revolt threatening Carthage's existence as a state.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=204}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=567}}\n\n==War==\n\n===Hanno===\n[[File:Utica240.PNG|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=A map showing the major movements of both sides during the Battle of Utica|{{center|The Battle of Utica}}]]\nHanno, as the commander of Carthage's African army, took the field.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=207}} Most of the Africans in his force remained loyal; they were accustomed to acting against their fellow Africans. His non-African contingent had remained quartered in Carthage when the army of Sicily was expelled, and also remained loyal. The few troops still in Sicily were paid up to date and redeployed with Hanno, and money was raised to hire fresh troops. An unknown number of Carthaginian citizens were incorporated into Hanno's army.{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|p=88}} By the time Hanno assembled this force, the rebels had already [[blockade]]d [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] and [[Hippo Diarrhytus|Hippo]] (modern [[Bizerte]]).{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=188}}\n\nIn early 240 BC Hanno set off with the army to relieve Utica;{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=373}} he took with him 100 elephants and a [[Siege engine|siege train]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=114\u2013115}}{{#tag:ref|The military historian Nigel Bagnall queries the utility of the siege train, as the rebels held no towns which could be besieged.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}}|group=note}} Hanno stormed the rebels' camp in the [[Battle of Utica]] and his elephants [[rout]]ed the besiegers. Hanno's army took over the camp and Hanno himself entered the city in triumph. However, the battle-hardened veterans of the Sicilian army regathered in the nearby hills and, not being pursued, returned towards Utica. The Carthaginians, accustomed to fighting the [[militia]]s of the Numidian cities, were still celebrating their victory when the rebels [[counterattack|counter-attacked]]. The Carthaginians fled, with great loss of life, losing their [[train (military)|baggage]] and siege trains. For the rest of the year Hanno skirmished with the rebel force, repeatedly missing opportunities to bring it to battle or to place it at a disadvantage; the military historian [[Nigel Bagnall]] writes of Hanno's \"incompetence as a field commander\".{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=6}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}}\n\nRome pointedly declined to take advantage of Carthage's troubles. Italians were prohibited from trading with the rebels but encouraged to trade with Carthage; 2,743 Carthaginian prisoners still held were released without a ransom being required and were immediately enrolled into Carthage's army.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}} [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero]], the king of the Roman satellite kingdom of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], was allowed to supply Carthage with the large amounts of food it needed and was no longer able to obtain from its own hinterland.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} In late 240 or early 239 BC the Carthaginian garrisons on [[Sardinia]] joined the mutiny, killing their officers and the island's governor. The Carthaginians sent a force to retake the island. When it arrived its members also mutinied, joined the previous mutineers, and killed all of the Carthaginians on the island. The mutineers then appealed to Rome for protection, which was refused.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=376}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=212}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}\n\n===Hamilcar===\n[[File:Macar240.PNG|thumb|left|upright=0.8|alt=A map showing the major movements of both sides during the Battle of the Bagradas River|{{center|The Battle of the Bagradas River}}]]\nAt some point during 240 BC the Carthaginians raised another, smaller, force, of approximately 10,000. It included deserters from the rebels, 2,000 cavalry, and 70 elephants. This was placed under the command of Hamilcar, who had commanded the Carthaginian forces on Sicily for the last six years of the First Punic War.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}} The rebels held the line of the [[Medjerda River|Bagradas River]] with 10,000 men commanded by Spendius. Hamilcar would need to force a crossing if he were to gain access to open country where he could manoeuvre. He did so by a stratagem, and Spendius was reinforced by an additional 15,000 men from the siege of Utica, which the rebels had renewed. The rebel force of 25,000 moved to attack Hamilcar in the [[Battle of the Bagradas River (c. 240 BC)|Battle of the Bagradas River]]. What happened next is unclear: it seems Hamilcar [[Feigned retreat|feigned a retreat]], the rebels broke ranks to pursue, the Carthaginians turned in good order and counter-attacked, routing the rebels, who suffered losses of 8,000 men.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=207}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=115\u2013117}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=567}}\n\nHamilcar was appointed joint commander of the Carthaginian army, alongside Hanno, but there was no cooperation between the two.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=209}} While Hanno manoeuvred against Matho to the north near Hippo, Hamilcar confronted various towns and cities which had gone over to the rebels, bringing them back to Carthaginian allegiance with varying mixtures of diplomacy and force. He was shadowed by a superior-sized rebel force, which kept to rough ground for fear of Hamilcar's cavalry and elephants, and harried his foragers and scouts.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=117}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=207\u2013208}} South west of Utica Hamilcar moved his force into the mountains in an attempt to bring the rebels to battle,{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=6}} but was surrounded. The Carthaginians were only saved from destruction when a Numidian leader, [[Navaras]], who had served with and admired Hamilcar in Sicily, swapped sides with his 2,000 cavalry.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=150\u2013152}} This proved disastrous for the rebels, and in the [[Hamilcar's victory with Navaras|resulting battle]] they lost 10,000 killed and 4,000 captured.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=118}}\n\n===Truceless War===\n[[File:Guerra mercenaria (cropped).png|thumb|upright=|alt=A map showing the major movements of both sides during the war|{{center|Main manoeuvres during the war}}]]\nSince leaving Carthage, Hamilcar had treated rebels he had captured well and offered them a choice of joining his army or free passage home. He made the same offer to the 4,000 captives from the recent battle.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=118}} The rebel leaders perceived this generous treatment as the motivation behind Navaras's defection and feared the disintegration of their army; they were aware that such generous terms would not be extended to them personally. To remove the possibility of any goodwill between the sides, they had 700 Carthaginian prisoners, including Gesco, tortured to death: they had their hands cut off, were castrated, their legs broken and were thrown into a pit and buried alive.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} Hamilcar, in turn, killed his prisoners. From this point, neither side showed any mercy, and the unusual ferocity of the fighting caused Polybius to term it the \"Truceless War\".{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} Any further prisoners taken by the Carthaginians were trampled to death by elephants.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=210}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=135}}\n\nAt some point between March and September 239 BC{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}} the previously loyal cities of Utica and Hippo slew their Carthaginian garrisons and joined the rebels. The people of Utica offered their city to the Romans, who declined. The classicist [[Richard Miles (historian)|Richard Miles]] writes that \"Rome was in no shape to embark on yet another war\" and wished to avoid acquiring a reputation for supporting mutinous uprisings.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=209\u2013210}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=136}} The rebels previously operating in the area moved south and laid siege to Carthage.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}}\n\nHaving a clear superiority in cavalry, Hamilcar raided the supply lines of the rebels around Carthage.{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} In mid-239 BC he was joined by Hanno and his army, but the two men disagreed as to the best strategy and operations were paralysed. Unusually, the choice of supreme commander was put to a vote of the army{{snd}}possibly only the officers{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=208}}{{snd}}and Hamilcar was elected; Hanno left the army.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=119}} In early 238 BC the lack of supplies forced the rebels to lift the siege of Carthage. They fell back to Tunis, from where they maintained a more distant blockade.{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=376}} While Matho maintained the blockade, Spendius led 40,000 men against Hamilcar. As in the previous year, they stayed to the higher and rougher terrain and harassed the Carthaginian army. After a period of campaigning, the details of which are not clear in the sources, Hamilcar trapped the rebels in a pass or mountain range known as the Saw. Pinned against mountains and with their food exhausted, the rebels ate their horses, their prisoners and then their slaves, hoping that Matho would [[sortie]] from Tunis to rescue them. Eventually, the surrounded troops forced their leaders to parley with Hamilcar, but on a thin pretext he took Spendius and his lieutenants prisoner. The rebels then attempted to fight their way out in the [[Battle of \"The Saw\"|Battle of the Saw]] and were massacred to a man.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=121\u2013122}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=146\u2013150}}\n\nHamilcar then marched on Tunis and laid siege to it in late 238 BC. The city was difficult to access from both the east and the west, so Hamilcar occupied a position to the south with half the army, and his deputy [[Hannibal (Mercenary War)|Hannibal]] was to the north with the balance. The rebel leaders taken captive prior to the Saw were crucified in full view of the city. Matho ordered a largescale night attack, which surprised the Carthaginians, who suffered many casualties. One of their camps was overrun and they lost much of their baggage. In addition, Hannibal and a delegation of 30 Carthaginian notables who were visiting the army were captured. They were tortured and then nailed to the crosses previously occupied by Spendius and his colleagues.

It lasted from 241 to late 238 or early 237 BC and ended with Carthage suppressing both the mutiny and the revolt.\n\nThe war began as a dispute over the payment of wages owed to the foreign soldiers who had fought for Carthage during the [[First Punic War]]. When a compromise seemed to have been reached the army erupted into full-scale mutiny under the leadership of [[Spendius]] and [[Mathos|Matho]]. 70,000 Africans from Carthage's oppressed dependant territories flocked to join them, bringing supplies and finance. War-weary Carthage fared poorly in the initial engagements of the war, especially under the generalship of [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno]]. [[Hamilcar Barca]], a veteran of the campaigns in [[Sicily]] (and father of [[Hannibal Barca]]), was given joint and then supreme command. He campaigned successfully, initially demonstrating lenience in an attempt to woo the rebels over. To prevent this Spendius tortured 700 Carthaginian prisoners to death, and henceforth the war was pursued with great brutality.\n\nBy early 237 BC, after numerous setbacks, the rebels were defeated and their cities brought back under Carthaginian rule. An expedition was prepared to reoccupy [[Sardinia]], where mutinous soldiers had slaughtered all Carthaginians. However, Rome declared that this would be an act of war and occupied both Sardinia and [[Corsica]], in contravention of the recent peace treaty. This has been considered to be the single greatest cause of war with Carthage breaking out again in 218 BC in the [[Second Punic War]].\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:Stele des Polybios.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting a man in classical Greek clothing raising one arm|{{center|Polybius}}]]\n\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[First Punic War]]{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Jones|Sidwell|2003|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa}}118 BC), a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known today for [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after this war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} Only part of the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with this war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the war in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Craige Champion describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Champion|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} Modern historians also take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other that Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}} Other sources include inscriptions, coins and archaeological evidence.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}}\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe First Punic War was fought between [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] and [[Roman Republic|Rome]], the two main powers of the western [[Mediterranean]] in the early 3rd century BC, and lasted for 23 years, from 264 to 241 BC. Rome still exists as the capital of Italy, while Carthage was razed by Rome in a [[Third Punic War|later war]]; its ruins lie {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}} east of modern [[Tunis]] on the North African coast. The two powers struggled for supremacy primarily on the Mediterranean island of [[Sicily]] and its surrounding waters, and also in [[North Africa]].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=82}} It was the longest continuous conflict and greatest naval war of antiquity. After immense material and human losses on both sides, the Carthaginians were defeated.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} The Carthaginian Senate ordered the commander of its forces on Sicily, [[Hamilcar Barca]] to negotiate a peace treaty; he delegated this to his deputy [[Gisco (died 239 BC)|Gisco]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=206}} The [[Treaty of Lutatius]] was signed and brought the First Punic War to its end. By the treaty's terms Carthage evacuated Sicily, handed over all prisoners taken during the war, and paid an [[indemnity]] of 3,200 talents{{#tag:ref|3,200 talents was approximately {{convert|81|lt|kg|disp=flip}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}}{{snd}}1,000 talents of this was due immediately, the balance over ten years.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}}\n\nWhile the war with Rome was being played out, the Carthaginian general [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno]] was leading a series of campaigns which greatly increased the area of Africa controlled by Carthage. He extended its control to [[Theveste]] (modern [[T\u00e9bessa]], [[Algeria]]) {{convert|300|km}} south-west of their capital.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=99}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=205}} Hanno was rigorous in squeezing taxes out of the newly conquered territory in order to pay for both the war with Rome and his own campaigns.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=205}} Half of all agricultural output was taken as war tax, and the tribute previously due from towns and cities was doubled.

The majority of these foreigners were from North Africa.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=567}} [[Libyans]] provided close-order infantry equipped with large shields, helmets, short swords and long thrusting [[spear]]s; as well as close-order shock cavalry carrying spears{{snd}}both were noted for their discipline and staying power.

The evacuation of the Carthaginian army of 20,000 men from Sicily was left in the hands of Gesco. Not wishing the freshly idle soldiers to combine for purposes of their own, Gisco split the army into small detachments based on their regions of origin. He sent these back to Carthage one at a time. He anticipated they would be promptly paid the several years back pay they were owed and hurried on their way home.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=133}} The Carthaginian authorities decided to instead wait until all of the troops had arrived and then attempt to negotiate a settlement at a lower rate. Meanwhile, as each group arrived it was billeted inside the city of Carthage where the advantages of civilisation were appreciated to the full after up to eight years under siege. So much so, that before the full 20,000 had arrived they were relocated to Sicca Veneria (modern [[El Kef]]) {{convert|180|km}} away, even though a significant portion of their arrears had to be paid before they would go.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=112}} \n\nFreed of their long period of military discipline and with nothing to do, the men grumbled among themselves and refused all attempts by the Carthaginians to pay them less than the full amount due. Frustrated by the Carthaginian negotiators' attempts to haggle, all 20,000 troops marched to Tunis, {{convert|16|km|sigfig=1}} from Carthage. Panicking, the Senate agreed to payment in full. The [[Mutiny|mutinous]] troops responded by demanding even more. Gisco, who had a good reputation with the army, was brought over from Sicily in late 241 BC and despatched to the camp with enough money to pay most of what was owed. He started to disburse this, with promises that the balance would be paid as soon as it could be raised. The discontent seemed to have abated when, for some unknown reason, discipline broke down. Several soldiers insisted that no deal with Carthage was acceptable, a riot broke out, dissenters were stoned to death, Gesco and his staff were taken prisoner and his treasury was seized. [[Spendius]], an escaped Roman slave who faced death by torture if he were recaptured, and [[Mathos|Matho]], an African dissatisfied with Hanno's attitude towards tax raising from Carthage's African possessions, were declared generals. The news of a formed, experienced, anti-Carthaginian army in the heart of its territory spread rapidly and many cities and towns rose in rebellion.

His non-African contingent had remained quartered in Carthage when the army of Sicily was expelled, and also remained loyal. The few troops still in Sicily were paid up to date and redeployed with Hanno, and money was raised to hire fresh troops. An unknown number of Carthaginian citizens were incorporated into Hanno's army.{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|p=88}} By the time Hanno assembled this force, the rebels had already [[blockade]]d [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] and [[Hippo Diarrhytus|Hippo]] (modern [[Bizerte]]).{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=188}}\n\nIn early 240 BC Hanno set off with the army to relieve Utica;{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=373}} he took with him 100 elephants and a [[Siege engine|siege train]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=114\u2013115}}{{#tag:ref|The military historian Nigel Bagnall queries the utility of the siege train, as the rebels held no towns which could be besieged.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}}|group=note}} Hanno stormed the rebels' camp in the [[Battle of Utica]] and his elephants [[rout]]ed the besiegers. Hanno's army took over the camp and Hanno himself entered the city in triumph. However, the battle-hardened veterans of the Sicilian army regathered in the nearby hills and, not being pursued, returned towards Utica. The Carthaginians, accustomed to fighting the [[militia]]s of the Numidian cities, were still celebrating their victory when the rebels [[counterattack|counter-attacked]]. The Carthaginians fled, with great loss of life, losing their [[train (military)|baggage]] and siege trains. For the rest of the year Hanno skirmished with the rebel force, repeatedly missing opportunities to bring it to battle or to place it at a disadvantage; the military historian [[Nigel Bagnall]] writes of Hanno's \"incompetence as a field commander\".{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=6}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}}\n\nRome pointedly declined to take advantage of Carthage's troubles. Italians were prohibited from trading with the rebels but encouraged to trade with Carthage; 2,743 Carthaginian prisoners still held were released without a ransom being required and were immediately enrolled into Carthage's army.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}} [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero]], the king of the Roman satellite kingdom of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], was allowed to supply Carthage with the large amounts of food it needed and was no longer able to obtain from its own hinterland.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} In late 240 or early 239 BC the Carthaginian garrisons on [[Sardinia]] joined the mutiny, killing their officers and the island's governor. The Carthaginians sent a force to retake the island. When it arrived its members also mutinied, joined the previous mutineers, and killed all of the Carthaginians on the island. The mutineers then appealed to Rome for protection, which was refused.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=376}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=212}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}\n\n===Hamilcar===\n[[File:Macar240.PNG|thumb|left|upright=0.8|alt=A map showing the major movements of both sides during the Battle of the Bagradas River|{{center|The Battle of the Bagradas River}}]]\nAt some point during 240 BC the Carthaginians raised another, smaller, force, of approximately 10,000. It included deserters from the rebels, 2,000 cavalry, and 70 elephants. This was placed under the command of Hamilcar, who had commanded the Carthaginian forces on Sicily for the last six years of the First Punic War.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=115}} The rebels held the line of the [[Medjerda River|Bagradas River]] with 10,000 men commanded by Spendius. Hamilcar would need to force a crossing if he were to gain access to open country where he could manoeuvre. He did so by a stratagem, and Spendius was reinforced by an additional 15,000 men from the siege of Utica, which the rebels had renewed. The rebel force of 25,000 moved to attack Hamilcar in the [[Battle of the Bagradas River (c. 240 BC)|Battle of the Bagradas River]]. What happened next is unclear: it seems Hamilcar [[Feigned retreat|feigned a retreat]], the rebels broke ranks to pursue, the Carthaginians turned in good order and counter-attacked, routing the rebels, who suffered losses of 8,000 men.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=207}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=115\u2013117}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=567}}\n\nHamilcar was appointed joint commander of the Carthaginian army, alongside Hanno, but there was no cooperation between the two.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=209}} While Hanno manoeuvred against Matho to the north near Hippo, Hamilcar confronted various towns and cities which had gone over to the rebels, bringing them back to Carthaginian allegiance with varying mixtures of diplomacy and force. He was shadowed by a superior-sized rebel force, which kept to rough ground for fear of Hamilcar's cavalry and elephants, and harried his foragers and scouts.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=117}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=207\u2013208}} South west of Utica Hamilcar moved his force into the mountains in an attempt to bring the rebels to battle,{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=6}} but was surrounded. The Carthaginians were only saved from destruction when a Numidian leader, [[Navaras]], who had served with and admired Hamilcar in Sicily, swapped sides with his 2,000 cavalry.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=150\u2013152}} This proved disastrous for the rebels, and in the [[Hamilcar's victory with Navaras|resulting battle]] they lost 10,000 killed and 4,000 captured.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=118}}\n\n===Truceless War===\n[[File:Guerra mercenaria (cropped).png|thumb|upright=|alt=A map showing the major movements of both sides during the war|{{center|Main manoeuvres during the war}}]]\nSince leaving Carthage, Hamilcar had treated rebels he had captured well and offered them a choice of joining his army or free passage home. He made the same offer to the 4,000 captives from the recent battle.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=118}} The rebel leaders perceived this generous treatment as the motivation behind Navaras's defection and feared the disintegration of their army; they were aware that such generous terms would not be extended to them personally. To remove the possibility of any goodwill between the sides, they had 700 Carthaginian prisoners, including Gesco, tortured to death: they had their hands cut off, were castrated, their legs broken and were thrown into a pit and buried alive.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} Hamilcar, in turn, killed his prisoners. From this point, neither side showed any mercy, and the unusual ferocity of the fighting caused Polybius to term it the \"Truceless War\".{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=208}}{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} Any further prisoners taken by the Carthaginians were trampled to death by elephants.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=210}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=135}}\n\nAt some point between March and September 239 BC{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}} the previously loyal cities of Utica and Hippo slew their Carthaginian garrisons and joined the rebels. The people of Utica offered their city to the Romans, who declined. The classicist [[Richard Miles (historian)|Richard Miles]] writes that \"Rome was in no shape to embark on yet another war\" and wished to avoid acquiring a reputation for supporting mutinous uprisings.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=209\u2013210}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=136}} The rebels previously operating in the area moved south and laid siege to Carthage.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}}\n\nHaving a clear superiority in cavalry, Hamilcar raided the supply lines of the rebels around Carthage.{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}} In mid-239 BC he was joined by Hanno and his army, but the two men disagreed as to the best strategy and operations were paralysed. Unusually, the choice of supreme commander was put to a vote of the army{{snd}}possibly only the officers{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=208}}{{snd}}and Hamilcar was elected; Hanno left the army.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=374}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=119}} In early 238 BC the lack of supplies forced the rebels to lift the siege of Carthage. They fell back to Tunis, from where they maintained a more distant blockade.{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=7}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=376}} While Matho maintained the blockade, Spendius led 40,000 men against Hamilcar. As in the previous year, they stayed to the higher and rougher terrain and harassed the Carthaginian army. After a period of campaigning, the details of which are not clear in the sources, Hamilcar trapped the rebels in a pass or mountain range known as the Saw. Pinned against mountains and with their food exhausted, the rebels ate their horses, their prisoners and then their slaves, hoping that Matho would [[sortie]] from Tunis to rescue them. Eventually, the surrounded troops forced their leaders to parley with Hamilcar, but on a thin pretext he took Spendius and his lieutenants prisoner. The rebels then attempted to fight their way out in the [[Battle of \"The Saw\"|Battle of the Saw]] and were massacred to a man.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=121\u2013122}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=146\u2013150}}\n\nHamilcar then marched on Tunis and laid siege to it in late 238 BC. The city was difficult to access from both the east and the west, so Hamilcar occupied a position to the south with half the army, and his deputy [[Hannibal (Mercenary War)|Hannibal]] was to the north with the balance. The rebel leaders taken captive prior to the Saw were crucified in full view of the city. Matho ordered a largescale night attack, which surprised the Carthaginians, who suffered many casualties. One of their camps was overrun and they lost much of their baggage. In addition, Hannibal and a delegation of 30 Carthaginian notables who were visiting the army were captured. They were tortured and then nailed to the crosses previously occupied by Spendius and his colleagues. Hamilcar abandoned the siege and withdrew to the north.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=122}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2007|pp=220\u2013223}}\n\nThe Senate encouraged reconciliation between Hanno and Hamilcar, and they agreed to serve together. Meanwhile, Matho and his army had left Tunis and marched {{convert|160|km|sigfig=1}} south to the wealthy city of [[Leptis Parva]], which had risen against Carthage earlier in the war.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=122}} Hanno and Hamilcar marched after them with an army totalling perhaps 40,000{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} including every Carthaginian citizen of military age. The rebels, rather than wait to be besieged, met the Carthaginians in open battle in mid- to late 238 BC.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=380}} No details of [[Battle of Leptis Parva|the battle]] survive,{{sfn|Eckstein|2017|p=8}} but the remaining 30,000 rebels{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} were wiped out and Matho captured with few losses to the Carthaginians. Any other prisoners were crucified, while Matho was dragged through the streets of Carthage and tortured to death by its inhabitants.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=211}} Most of the towns and cities which had not already come to terms with Carthage now did so, with the exceptions of Utica and Hippo, whose inhabitants feared vengeance for their massacre of Carthaginians. They attempted to hold out, but Polybius says that they too \"quickly\" surrendered, probably in late 238 or very early 237 BC.{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=377}} The surrendered towns and cities were treated leniently, although Carthaginian governors were imposed on them.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=210}}\n\n===Sardinia===\n\nProbably in 237 BC{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=136}} the indigenous inhabitants of Sardinia rose up and drove out the mutinous garrison, which took refuge in Italy. As the war in Africa came to a close, they appealed again for Roman assistance. This time the Romans agreed and prepared an expedition to seize both Sardinia and [[Corsica]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}} It is unclear from the sources why the Romans acted differently from three years earlier.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=210}} Polybius held that this action was indefensible.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=569}} Carthage sent an embassy to Rome, which quoted the Treaty of Lutatius and claimed they were outfitting their own expedition to retake the island, which it had held for 300 years. The [[Roman Senate]] cynically stated that they considered the preparation of this force an act of war. Their peace terms were the ceding of Sardinia and Corsica and the payment of an additional 1,200 talent indemnity.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=569}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=209, 212\u2013213}}{{#tag:ref|1,200 talents was approximately {{convert|30|lt|kg|disp=flip}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} Weakened by 30 years of war, Carthage agreed rather than enter into a conflict with Rome again. The Romans required a strong military presence on the islands for at least the next seven years, as they struggled to suppress the local inhabitants. Polybius considered this act of bad faith by the Romans to be the single greatest cause of war with Carthage breaking out again in 218 BC in the [[Second Punic War]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=175}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe historian Dexter Hoyos writes that the  \"the truceless war ... produce[d] a complete and enduring reversal of Carthage's domestic fortunes and military orientation\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=206}} Miles agrees there was \"a period of profound political transformation\".{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=214}} The seizure of Sardinia and Corsica by Rome and the additional indemnity fuelled resentment in Carthage.{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=211}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=213}} The role of Hamilcar Barca in the victory greatly enhanced the prestige and power of the [[Barcid]] family.

According to the theory, historical events are associated with recurring generational personas (archetypes). Each generational persona unleashes a new era (called a turning) lasting around 20\u201322 years, in which a new social, political, and economic climate exists. They are part of a larger cyclical \"[[saeculum]]\" (a long human life, which usually spans between 80 and 90 years, although some ''saecula'' have lasted longer). The theory states that after every saeculum, a [[crisis]] recurs in American history, which is followed by a recovery (high). During this recovery, institutions and [[communitarian]] values are strong. Ultimately, succeeding generational archetypes attack and weaken institutions in the name of autonomy and [[individualism]], which ultimately creates a tumultuous political environment that ripens conditions for another crisis.\n\nStrauss and Howe laid the groundwork for their theory in their 1991 book ''Generations'', which discusses the [[history of the United States]] as a series of generational biographies going back to 1584.<ref name=\"generations\" /> In their 1997 book ''The Fourth Turning'', the authors expanded the theory to focus on a fourfold cycle of generational types and recurring mood eras<ref name=\"fourthturning\" />  to describe the history of the United States, including the [[Thirteen Colonies]] and their British antecedents.

Each had written on generational topics: Strauss on Baby Boomers and the [[Draft lottery (1969)|Vietnam War draft]], and Howe on the [[G.I. Generation]] and federal entitlement programs.<ref name=Gen14>Strauss & Howe, 1991. p. 14.</ref> Strauss co-wrote two books with [[Lawrence Baskir]] about how the [[Vietnam War]] affected the Baby Boomers (''Chance and Circumstance: The Draft the War and The Vietnam Generation'' (1978) and ''Reconciliation after Vietnam'' (1977)).  Neil Howe studied what he believed to be the US's [[entitlement]] attitude of the 1980s and co-authored ''On Borrowed Time: How America's entitlement ego puts America's future at risk of Bankruptcy'' in 1988 with [[Peter George Peterson]].<ref>{{cite book|title=On Borrowed Time: How the Growth in Entitlement Spending Threatens America's Future|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4bPN_6p9LjgC|accessdate=6 November 2012|first=Peter G. |last=Peterson |author2= Neil Howe|date= 1988|isbn=9781412829991}}</ref> The authors' interest in generations as a broader topic emerged after they met in Washington, D.C., and began discussing the connections between each of their previous works.<ref>{{cite video|title=Millennials: A profile of the Next Great Generation |publisher=WMFE & PBS |medium=DVD |isbn=978-0-9712606-7-2}}</ref>\n\nThey wondered why Boomers and G.I.s had developed such different ways of looking at the world, and what it was about these generations\u2019 experiences growing up that prompted their different outlooks.  They also wondered whether any previous generations had acted along similar lines, and their research discussed historical analogues to the current generations.  They ultimately described a recurring pattern in Anglo-American history of four generational types, each with a distinct collective persona, and a corresponding cycle of four different types of era, each with a distinct mood. The groundwork for this theory was laid out in ''Generations'' in 1991.  Strauss and Howe expanded on their theory and updated the terminology in ''The Fourth Turning'' in 1997.<ref name=Gen14/><ref>Strauss&Howe, 1997. p. 338.</ref> ''Generations'' helped popularize the idea that people in a particular age group tend to share a distinct set of beliefs, attitudes, values and behaviors because they all grow up and come of age during a particular period in history.<ref name=Hoover/>\n\nIn ''Generations'' (1991) and ''The Fourth Turning'' (1997), they discussed the [[generation gap]] between Baby Boomers and their parents and predicted there would be no such gap between Millennials and their elders. In 2000, they published ''Millennials Rising''. A 2000  ''[[New York Times]]'' book review for this book titled: ''What's the Matter With Kids Today? Not a Thing'', described the message of ''Millennials Rising'' as \u201cwe boomers are raising a cohort of kids who are smarter, more industrious and better behaved than any generation before\u201d, saying the book complimented the Baby Boomer cohort by complimenting their parenting skills.<ref name=\"The New York Times\">{{cite news|last1=Brooks|first1=David|title=What's the Matter With Kids Today?

They provided historical information regarding living and past generations and made various predictions. Many of their predictions were regarding the Millennial Generation, who were young children when they began their work, thus lacking significant historical data. In their first book  ''Generations'' (1991), Strauss and Howe describe the history of the US as a succession of Anglo-American generational biographies from 1584 to the present, and they describe a theorized recurring generational cycle in American history. The authors posit a pattern of four repeating phases, generational types and a recurring cycle of spiritual awakenings and secular crises, from the founding colonials of America through the present day.<ref name=generations>{{cite book|last1=Howe|first1=Neil|title=Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069|date=1992|isbn=978-0688119126|url=https://archive.org/details/generationshisto00stra_0}}</ref><ref name=\"Fourth\">{{cite book|last1=Strauss|first1=William|title=The Fourth Turning|date=2009|publisher=Three Rivers Press|asin=B001RKFU4I}}</ref>\n\nStrauss and Howe followed in 1993 with their second book ''13th Gen: Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail?'', which was published while Gen Xers were young adults.  The book examines the generation born between 1961 and 1981, \"Gen-Xers\" (which they called \"13ers\", describing them as the thirteenth generation since the US became a nation).  The book asserts that 13ers' location in history as under-protected  children during the [[Sexual Revolution|Consciousness Revolution]] explains their pragmatic attitude. They describe Gen Xers as growing up during a time when society was less focused on children and more focused on adults and their [[self-actualization]].<ref>Strauss & Howe, 1993.</ref><ref name = \"13th Gen\">{{cite book|last1=Howe|first1=Neil|title=13th Gen: Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail?|date=1993|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0679743651|url=https://archive.org/details/13thgenabortretr00howe}}</ref><ref name=\"Fourth\"/>\n\nIn 1997, the authors published ''The Fourth Turning: An American Prophecy,'' which expanded on the ideas presented in ''Generations'' and extended their cycles back into the early 15th century. The authors began the use of more colorful names for generational archetypes - e.g. \"Civics\" became \"Heroes\" (which they applied to the Millennial Generation), \"Adaptives\" became \"Artists\" - and of the terms \"Turning\" and \"Saeculum\" for the generational cycles. The title is a reference to what their first book called a Crisis period, which they expected to recur soon after the turn of the millennium.<ref name=\"fourthturning\">Strauss & Howe, 1997.</ref>\n\nIn 2000, the two authors published ''Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation''. This work discussed the personality of the Millennial Generation, whose oldest members were described as the high school graduating class of the year 2000. In this 2000 book, Strauss and Howe asserted that Millennial teens and young adults were recasting the image of youth from \"downbeat and alienated to upbeat and engaged\". They credited increased parental attention and protection for these positive changes. They asserted Millennials are held to higher standards than adults apply to themselves and that they're a lot less vulgar and violent than the teen culture older people produce for them. They described them as less sexually charged and as ushering in a new sexual modesty, with increasing belief that sex should be saved for marriage and a return to conservative family values. They predicted that over the following decade, Millennials would transform what it means to be young.  According to the authors, Millennials could emerge as the next \"Great Generation\".  The book was described as an optimistic, feel-good book for the parents of the Millennial Generation, predominantly the Baby Boomers.<ref name=\"The New York Times\"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Gomez|first=Dina|title=The next great generation|url=http://www.saeculumresearch.com/assets/client-assets/files/selected-pubs/NEA-Today-The-Next-Great-Generation.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2012|newspaper=NEA Today, V.19 No.4|date=May 2001}}</ref><ref>Strauss & Howe, 2000.</ref>\n\n==Defining a generation==\nStrauss and Howe define a [[generation#Cultural generation|social generation]] as the aggregate of all people born over a span of roughly twenty years or about the length of one phase of life: [[childhood]], [[young adult (psychology)|young adulthood]], [[middle age|midlife]], and [[old age]].  Generations are identified (from first birthyear to last) by looking for [[Demographics#Generational cohorts|cohort groups]] of this length that share three criteria. First, members of a generation share what the authors call an ''age location in history'': they encounter key historical events and social trends while occupying the same phase of life. In this view, members of a generation are shaped in lasting ways by the eras they encounter as children and young adults and they share certain common ''beliefs and behaviors''. Aware of the experiences and traits that they share with their peers, members of a generation would also share a sense of common ''perceived membership'' in that generation.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1991, pp. 58\u201368.</ref>\n\nThey based their definition of a generation on the work of various writers and social thinkers, from ancient writers such as [[Polybius]] and [[Ibn Khaldun]] to modern social theorists such as [[Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset]], [[Karl Mannheim]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[\u00c9mile Littr\u00e9]], [[Auguste Comte]], and Fran\u00e7ois Mentr\u00e9.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1991, pp. 433\u2013446.</ref>\n\n===Turnings===\nWhile writing ''Generations'', Strauss and Howe described a theorized pattern in the historical generations they examined, which they say revolved around generational events which they call turnings. In ''Generations'', and in greater detail in ''The Fourth Turning'', they describe a four-stage cycle of social or mood eras which they call \"turnings\". The turnings include: \"The High\", \"The Awakening\", \"The Unraveling\" and \"The Crisis\".<ref name=\"Fourth\"/>\n\n====High====\nAccording to Strauss and Howe, the First Turning is a ''High'', which occurs after a Crisis. During ''The High,'' institutions are strong and individualism is weak. Society is confident about where it wants to go collectively, though those outside the majoritarian center often feel stifled by the conformity.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, p. 101.</ref>\n\nAccording to the authors, the most recent First Turning in the US was the [[history of the United States (1945\u201364)|post\u2013World War II American]] High, beginning in 1946 and ending with the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] on November 22, 1963.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, pp. 145\u2013152.</ref>\n\n====Awakening====\nAccording to the theory, the Second Turning is an ''Awakening''. This is an era when institutions are attacked in the name of personal and spiritual autonomy. Just when society is reaching its high tide of public progress, people suddenly tire of social discipline and want to recapture a sense of \"self-awareness\", \"spirituality\" and \"personal authenticity\". Young activists look back at the previous High as an era of cultural and spiritual poverty.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, p. 102.</ref>\n\nStrauss & Howe say the US's most recent Awakening was the \u201cConsciousness Revolution,\u201d which spanned from the campus and inner-city revolts of the mid-1960s to the tax revolts of the early 1980s.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, pp. 171\u2013179.</ref>\n\n====Unraveling====\nAccording to Strauss and Howe, the Third Turning is an ''Unraveling''. The mood of this era they say is in many ways the opposite of a High: Institutions are weak and distrusted, while individualism is strong and flourishing.  The authors say Highs come after Crises, when society wants to coalesce and build and avoid the death and destruction of the previous crisis. Unravelings come after Awakenings, when society wants to atomize and enjoy.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, pp. 102\u2013103.</ref> They say the most recent Unraveling in the US began in the 1980s and includes the [[1990s United States boom|Long Boom]] and [[Culture War]].<ref name=\"Fourth\"/>\n\n====Crisis====\nAccording to the authors, the Fourth Turning is a ''Crisis''. This is an era of destruction, often involving war or revolution, in which institutional life is destroyed and rebuilt in response to a perceived threat to the nation's survival. After the crisis, civic authority revives, cultural expression redirects towards community purpose, and people begin to locate themselves as members of a larger group.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, pp. 103\u2013104.</ref>\n\nThe authors say the previous Fourth Turning in the US began with the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and climaxed with the end of [[World War II]]. The G.I. Generation (which they call a Hero archetype, born 1901 to 1924) came of age during this era. They say their confidence, optimism, and collective outlook epitomized the mood of that era.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, pp. 254\u2013260.</ref> The authors assert the Millennial Generation (which they also describe as a Hero archetype, born 1982 to 2004) show many similar traits to those of the G.I. youth, which they describe as including: rising civic engagement, improving behavior, and collective confidence.<ref>Strauss & Howe 2007, pp. 23\u201324.</ref>\n\n===Cycle===\nThe authors describe each turning as lasting about 20\u201322 years. Four turnings make up a full cycle of about 80 to 90 years,<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, pp. 2\u20133.</ref> which the authors term a ''[[saeculum]]'', after the Latin word meaning both \"a long human life\" and \"a natural century\".<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, pp. 14\u201315.</ref>\n\nGenerational change drives the cycle of turnings and determines its [[Frequency|periodicity]].  As each generation ages into the next life phase (and a new social role) society's mood and behavior fundamentally changes, giving rise to a new turning. Therefore, a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship exists between historical events and generational personas. Historical events shape generations in childhood and young adulthood; then, as parents and leaders in midlife and old age, generations in turn shape history.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, pp. 58p62.</ref>\n\nEach of the four turnings has a distinct mood that recurs every saeculum. Strauss and Howe describe these turnings as the \"seasons of history\". At one extreme is the Awakening, which is analogous to summer, and at the other extreme is the Crisis, which is analogous to winter. The turnings in between are transitional seasons, the High and the Unraveling are similar to spring and autumn, respectively.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, pp. 40\u201341.</ref> Strauss and Howe have discussed 26 theorized turnings over 7 saecula in Anglo-American history, from the year 1435 through today.\n\nAt the heart of Strauss & Howe's ideas is a basic alternation between two different types of eras, Crises and Awakenings. Both of these are defining eras in which people observe that historic events are radically altering their social environment.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1991, pp. 69\u201372.</ref> Crises are periods marked by major secular upheaval, when society focuses on reorganizing the outer world of institutions and public behavior (they say the last American Crisis was the period spanning the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]]). Awakenings are periods marked by cultural or religious renewal, when society focuses on changing the inner world of values and private behavior (the last American Awakening was the \"Consciousness Revolution\" of the [[History of the United States (1964\u20131980)|1960s and 1970s]]).<ref name=\"Strauss & Howe 1991, p. 71\">Strauss & Howe 1991, p. 71.</ref>\n\nDuring Crises, great peril provokes a societal consensus, an ethic of personal sacrifice, and strong institutional order. During Awakenings, an ethic of individualism emerges, and the institutional order is attacked by new social ideals and spiritual agendas.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1991, p. 93.</ref> According to the authors, about every eighty to ninety years\u2014the length of a long human life\u2014a national Crisis occurs in American society. Roughly halfway to the next Crisis, a cultural Awakening occurs (historically, these have often been called [[Great Awakenings]]).<ref name=\"Strauss & Howe 1991, p. 71\"/>\n\nIn describing this cycle of Crises and Awakenings, they draw from the work of other historians and social scientists who have also discussed long cycles in American and [[Europe]]an history.  The cycle of Crises corresponds with long cycles of war identified by such scholars as [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], [[Quincy Wright]], and L. L. Ferrar Jr., and with geopolitical cycles identified by William R. Thompson and [[George Modelski]].<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, pp. 36\u201341.</ref>  Strauss and Howe say their cycle of Awakenings corresponds with [[Anthony FC Wallace|Anthony Wallace]]'s work on [[revitalization movements]];<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, p. 40.</ref> they also say recurring Crises and Awakenings correspond with two-stroke cycles in politics ([[Walter Dean Burnham]], [[Arthur Schlesinger Sr.]] and [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.|Jr.]]), foreign affairs (Frank L. Klingberg), and the economy ([[Nikolai Kondratieff]]) as well as with long-term oscillations in crime and substance abuse.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, pp. 106\u2013116.</ref>\n\n===Archetypes===\nThe authors say two different types of eras and two formative age locations associated with them (childhood and young adulthood) produce four generational ''[[archetypes]]'' that repeat sequentially, in rhythm with the cycle of Crises and Awakenings. In ''Generations'', they refer to these four archetypes as ''Idealist, Reactive, Civic,'' and ''Adaptive''.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1991, pp. 73\u201374.</ref> In ''The Fourth Turning'' (1997) they change this terminology to ''Prophet, Nomad, Hero,'' and ''Artist''.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, p. 70.</ref> They say the generations in each archetype not only share a similar age-location in history, they also share some basic attitudes towards family, risk, culture and values, and civic engagement. In essence, generations shaped by similar early-life experiences develop similar collective personas and follow similar life-trajectories.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1991, pp. 357\u2013365.</ref> To date, Strauss and Howe have described 25 generations in Anglo-American history, each with a corresponding archetype. The authors describe the archetypes as follows:\n\n====Prophet====\n[[File:Abelincoln1846.jpeg|thumb|[[Abraham Lincoln]], born in 1809. Strauss and Howe would identify him as a member of the Transcendental generation. ]]\n''Prophet'' (Idealist) generations enter childhood ''during a High'', a time of rejuvenated community life and consensus around a new societal order. Prophets grow up as the increasingly indulged children of this post-Crisis era, come of age as self-absorbed young crusaders of an Awakening, focus on morals and principles in midlife, and emerge as elders guiding another Crisis.<ref name=\"Strauss & Howe 1997, p. 84\">Strauss & Howe 1997, p. 84.</ref> Examples:  [[Era of Good Feelings|Transcendental Generation]], [[Missionary Generation]], [[Baby Boomers]].\n\n====Nomad====\n''Nomad'' (Reactive) generations enter childhood ''during an Awakening'', a time of social ideals and spiritual agendas, when young adults are passionately attacking the established institutional order. Nomads grow up as under-protected children during this Awakening, come of age as [[Social alienation|alienated]], post-Awakening young adults, become pragmatic midlife leaders during a Crisis, and age into resilient post-Crisis elders.<ref name=\"Strauss & Howe 1997, p. 84\"/> Examples: [[Gilded Generation]], [[Lost Generation]], [[Generation X]]\n\n====Hero====\n[[File:Lt.

Kennedy aboard the PT-109.jpg|thumb|Young adults fighting in [[World War II]] were born in the early part of the 20th century, like [[PT109]] commander [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|LTJG]] [[John F. Kennedy]] (b. 1917). They are part of the [[G.I. Generation]], which follows the Hero archetype.]]\n''Hero'' (Civic) generations enter childhood ''after an Awakening'', ''during an Unraveling'', a time of individual pragmatism, self-reliance, and laissez-faire. Heroes grow up as increasingly protected post-Awakening children, come of age as team-oriented young optimists during a Crisis, emerge as energetic, overly-confident midlifers, and age into politically powerful elders attacked by another Awakening.<ref name=\"Strauss & Howe 1997, p. 84\"/> Examples: [[Republican Generation]], [[G.I. Generation]], [[Millennials]]\n\n====Artist====\n''Artist'' (Adaptive) generations enter childhood ''after an Unraveling,'' ''during a Crisis'', a time when great dangers cut down social and political complexity in favor of public consensus, aggressive institutions, and an ethic of personal sacrifice. Artists grow up overprotected by adults preoccupied with the Crisis, come of age as the socialized and conformist young adults of a post-Crisis world, break out as process-oriented midlife leaders during an Awakening, and age into thoughtful post-Awakening elders.<ref name=\"Strauss & Howe 1997, p. 84\"/> Examples: [[Progressive Generation]], [[Silent Generation]], [[Generation Z]]\n\n=== Summary ===\n* An average life is 80 years, and consists of four periods of ~20-22 years\n** Childhood \u2192 Young adult \u2192 Midlife \u2192 Elderhood\n* A generation is an aggregate of people born every ~20-22 years\n** Baby Boomers \u2192 Gen X \u2192 Millennials \u2192 Homelanders\n* Each generation experiences \"four turnings\" every ~80-90 years\n** High \u2192 Awakening \u2192 Unraveling \u2192 Crisis\n* A generation is considered \"dominant\" or \"recessive\" according to the turning experienced as young adults.

As long as the transition to adulthood occurs around age 20, the transition to midlife around age 40, and the transition to old age around age 60, they say the basic length of both generations and turnings will remain the same.<ref name=\"Strauss & Howe 1997, pp. 53\u201362\"/>\n\nIn their book, The Fourth Turning, however, Strauss and Howe say that the precise boundaries of generations and turnings are erratic. The generational rhythm is not like certain simple, [[inorganic compound|inorganic]] cycles in [[List of cycles#Physics cycles|physics]] or [[List of cycles#Astronomical cycles|astronomy]], where time and periodicity can be predicted to the second. Instead, it resembles the complex, [[List of cycles#Organic cycles|organic cycles]] of biology, where basic intervals endure but precise timing is difficult to predict. Strauss and Howe compare the saecular rhythm to the four seasons, which they say similarly occur in the same order, but with slightly varying timing. Just as winter may come sooner or later, and be more or less severe in any given year, the same is true of a Fourth Turning in any given saeculum.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, pp. 51\u201352.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

A generation \"coming of age\" is signaled by a \"triggering event\" that marks the turning point and the ending of one turning and the beginning of the new.  For example, the \"triggering event\" that marked the coming of age for the Baby Boom Generation was the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy]].  This marked the end of a first turning and the beginning of a second turning.  This is why turning start and end dates don't match up exactly with the generational birth years, but they tend to start and end a few years after the generational year spans.  This also explains why a generation is described to have \"entered childhood\" during a particular turning, rather than \"born during\" a particular turning.}}\n|-\n| [[Humanist Generation]] || Artist (Adaptive)  || align=center|1461\u20131482 (22)|| 4th Turning: Crisis: [[Wars of the Roses|War of the Roses]] || align=center|1459\u20131497 (38)\n|-\n! colspan=5 | Reformation Saeculum (97 years)\n|-\n| [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation Generation]] || Prophet (Idealist) ||align=center|1483\u20131511 (28) || 1st Turning: High: [[English Renaissance|Tudor Renaissance]] || align=center|1497\u20131517 (20)\n|-\n| [[Reprisal Generation]] || Nomad (Reactive) || align=center|1512\u20131540 (29) || 2nd Turning: Awakening: [[Protestant Reformation]] || align=center|1517\u20131542 (25)\n|-\n| Elizabethan Generation || Hero (Civic) || align=center|1541\u20131565 (24) || 3rd Turning: Unraveling: [[Counter reformation|Reaction]] & [[English Reformation#Marian Restoration|Restoration]]|| align=center|1542\u20131569 (27)\n|-\n| Parliamentary Generation || Artist (Adaptive) ||align=center|1566\u20131587 (22)|| 4th Turning: Crisis: [[Spanish Armada|Armada Crisis]] || align=center|1569\u20131594 (25)\n|-\n! colspan=5 | New World Saeculum (110 years)\n|-\n| Puritan Generation || Prophet (Idealist) || align=center|1588\u20131617 (30)|| 1st Turning: High: [[Merry England|Merrie England]] || align=center|1594\u20131621 (27)\n|-\n| [[Cavalier Generation (Strauss-Howe Theory)|Cavalier Generation]] || Nomad (Reactive) || align=center|1618\u20131647 (30) || 2nd Turning: Awakening: [[Puritan Awakening]] || align=center|1621\u20131649 (26)\n|-\n| Glorious Generation || Hero (Civic) || align=center|1648\u20131673 (26)|| 3rd Turning: Unraveling: [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] || align=center|1649\u20131675 (26)\n|-\n| Enlightenment Generation || Artist (Adaptive) ||align=center|1674\u20131700 (27)|| 4th Turning: Crisis: [[Glorious Revolution]] || align=center|1675\u20131704 (29)\n|-\n! colspan=5 | Revolutionary Saeculum (90 years)\n|-\n| Awakening Generation || Prophet (Idealist) || align=center|1701\u20131723 (23) || 1st Turning: High: [[Augustan literature|Augustan Age of Empire]] || align=center|1704\u20131727 (23)\n|-\n| [[Liberty Generation]] || Nomad (Reactive) || align=center|1724\u20131741 (18) || 2nd Turning: Awakening: [[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]] || align=center|1727\u20131746 (19)\n|-\n| [[Republican Generation]] || Hero (Civic) || align=center|1742\u20131766 (25)|| 3rd Turning: Unraveling: [[French and Indian War]] || align=\"center\" | 1746\u20131773 (27)\n|-\n| Compromise Generation || Artist (Adaptive) || align=center|1767\u20131791 (23)|| 4th Turning: Crisis: [[American Revolution]] || align=center|1773\u20131794 (21)\n|-\n! colspan=5 | Civil War Saeculum (71 years)\n|-\n| Transcendental Generation || Prophet (Idealist) ||align=center|1792\u20131821 (28)|| 1st Turning: High: [[Era of Good Feelings]] || align=center|1794\u20131822 (28)\n|-\n| [[Gilded Generation (Strauss\u2013Howe theory)|Gilded Generation]] || Nomad (Reactive)   || align=center|1822\u20131842 (21)|| 2nd Turning: Awakening: [[Second Great Awakening|Transcendental Awakening]]|| align=center|1822\u20131844 (22)\n|-\n| {{efn|According to Strauss and Howe their generational types have appeared in Anglo-American history in a fixed order for more than 500 years with one hitch, occurring in the Civil War Saeculum.

One of the things to understand is that most historians never look at history in terms of generations. They prefer to tell history as a seamless row of 55-year-old leaders who always tend to think and behave the same way -- but they don't and they never have. If you look at the way America's 55-year-old leaders were acting in the 1960s -- you know, the ebullience and confidence of the JFKs and LBJs and Hubert Humphreys -- and compare them with today's leaders in Congress -- the indecision, the lack of sure-footedness -- I think you would have to agree that 55-year-olds do not always act the same way and you're dealing with powerful generational forces at work that explain why one generation of war veterans, war heroes, and another generation which came of age in very different circumstances tend to have very different instincts about acting in the world.\u201d<ref name=\"Booknotes\"/>\n\nResponding to criticisms in 1991, William Strauss accepted that some historians might not like their theory, which they presented as a new [[paradigm]] for looking at American history, that filled a need for a unifying vision of American history:\n\n{{quote|People are looking for a new way to connect themselves to the larger story of America. That is the problem. We've felt adrift over the past 10 years, and we think that the way history has been presented over the past couple of decades has been more in terms of the little pieces and people are not as interested in the little pieces now. They're looking for a unifying vision. We haven't had unifying visions of the story of America for decades now, and we're trying to provide it in this book.\n\nThe kinds of historians who are drawn to our book -- and I'm sure it will be very controversial among academics because we are presenting something that is so new -- but the kinds who are drawn to it are the ones who themselves have focused on the human life cycle rather than just the sequential series of events. Some good examples of that are Morton Keller up at Brandeis and [[David Hackett Fischer]].

According to the theory, historical events are associated with recurring generational personas (archetypes). Each generational persona unleashes a new era (called a turning) lasting around 20\u201322 years, in which a new social, political, and economic climate exists. They are part of a larger cyclical \"[[saeculum]]\" (a long human life, which usually spans between 80 and 90 years, although some ''saecula'' have lasted longer). The theory states that after every saeculum, a [[crisis]] recurs in American history, which is followed by a recovery (high). During this recovery, institutions and [[communitarian]] values are strong. Ultimately, succeeding generational archetypes attack and weaken institutions in the name of autonomy and [[individualism]], which ultimately creates a tumultuous political environment that ripens conditions for another crisis.\n\nStrauss and Howe laid the groundwork for their theory in their 1991 book ''Generations'', which discusses the [[history of the United States]] as a series of generational biographies going back to 1584.<ref name=\"generations\" /> In their 1997 book ''The Fourth Turning'', the authors expanded the theory to focus on a fourfold cycle of generational types and recurring mood eras<ref name=\"fourthturning\" />  to describe the history of the United States, including the [[Thirteen Colonies]] and their British antecedents.

Each had written on generational topics: Strauss on Baby Boomers and the [[Draft lottery (1969)|Vietnam War draft]], and Howe on the [[G.I. Generation]] and federal entitlement programs.<ref name=Gen14>Strauss & Howe, 1991. p. 14.</ref> Strauss co-wrote two books with [[Lawrence Baskir]] about how the [[Vietnam War]] affected the Baby Boomers (''Chance and Circumstance: The Draft the War and The Vietnam Generation'' (1978) and ''Reconciliation after Vietnam'' (1977)).  Neil Howe studied what he believed to be the US's [[entitlement]] attitude of the 1980s and co-authored ''On Borrowed Time: How America's entitlement ego puts America's future at risk of Bankruptcy'' in 1988 with [[Peter George Peterson]].<ref>{{cite book|title=On Borrowed Time: How the Growth in Entitlement Spending Threatens America's Future|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4bPN_6p9LjgC|accessdate=6 November 2012|first=Peter G. |last=Peterson |author2= Neil Howe|date= 1988|isbn=9781412829991}}</ref> The authors' interest in generations as a broader topic emerged after they met in Washington, D.C., and began discussing the connections between each of their previous works.<ref>{{cite video|title=Millennials: A profile of the Next Great Generation |publisher=WMFE & PBS |medium=DVD |isbn=978-0-9712606-7-2}}</ref>\n\nThey wondered why Boomers and G.I.s had developed such different ways of looking at the world, and what it was about these generations\u2019 experiences growing up that prompted their different outlooks.  They also wondered whether any previous generations had acted along similar lines, and their research discussed historical analogues to the current generations.  They ultimately described a recurring pattern in Anglo-American history of four generational types, each with a distinct collective persona, and a corresponding cycle of four different types of era, each with a distinct mood. The groundwork for this theory was laid out in ''Generations'' in 1991.  Strauss and Howe expanded on their theory and updated the terminology in ''The Fourth Turning'' in 1997.<ref name=Gen14/><ref>Strauss&Howe, 1997. p. 338.</ref> ''Generations'' helped popularize the idea that people in a particular age group tend to share a distinct set of beliefs, attitudes, values and behaviors because they all grow up and come of age during a particular period in history.<ref name=Hoover/>\n\nIn ''Generations'' (1991) and ''The Fourth Turning'' (1997), they discussed the [[generation gap]] between Baby Boomers and their parents and predicted there would be no such gap between Millennials and their elders. In 2000, they published ''Millennials Rising''. A 2000  ''[[New York Times]]'' book review for this book titled: ''What's the Matter With Kids Today? Not a Thing'', described the message of ''Millennials Rising'' as \u201cwe boomers are raising a cohort of kids who are smarter, more industrious and better behaved than any generation before\u201d, saying the book complimented the Baby Boomer cohort by complimenting their parenting skills.<ref name=\"The New York Times\">{{cite news|last1=Brooks|first1=David|title=What's the Matter With Kids Today?

The book examines the generation born between 1961 and 1981, \"Gen-Xers\" (which they called \"13ers\", describing them as the thirteenth generation since the US became a nation).  The book asserts that 13ers' location in history as under-protected  children during the [[Sexual Revolution|Consciousness Revolution]] explains their pragmatic attitude. They describe Gen Xers as growing up during a time when society was less focused on children and more focused on adults and their [[self-actualization]].<ref>Strauss & Howe, 1993.</ref><ref name = \"13th Gen\">{{cite book|last1=Howe|first1=Neil|title=13th Gen: Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail?|date=1993|publisher=Vintage|isbn=978-0679743651|url=https://archive.org/details/13thgenabortretr00howe}}</ref><ref name=\"Fourth\"/>\n\nIn 1997, the authors published ''The Fourth Turning: An American Prophecy,'' which expanded on the ideas presented in ''Generations'' and extended their cycles back into the early 15th century. The authors began the use of more colorful names for generational archetypes - e.g. \"Civics\" became \"Heroes\" (which they applied to the Millennial Generation), \"Adaptives\" became \"Artists\" - and of the terms \"Turning\" and \"Saeculum\" for the generational cycles. The title is a reference to what their first book called a Crisis period, which they expected to recur soon after the turn of the millennium.<ref name=\"fourthturning\">Strauss & Howe, 1997.</ref>\n\nIn 2000, the two authors published ''Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation''. This work discussed the personality of the Millennial Generation, whose oldest members were described as the high school graduating class of the year 2000. In this 2000 book, Strauss and Howe asserted that Millennial teens and young adults were recasting the image of youth from \"downbeat and alienated to upbeat and engaged\". They credited increased parental attention and protection for these positive changes. They asserted Millennials are held to higher standards than adults apply to themselves and that they're a lot less vulgar and violent than the teen culture older people produce for them. They described them as less sexually charged and as ushering in a new sexual modesty, with increasing belief that sex should be saved for marriage and a return to conservative family values. They predicted that over the following decade, Millennials would transform what it means to be young.  According to the authors, Millennials could emerge as the next \"Great Generation\".  The book was described as an optimistic, feel-good book for the parents of the Millennial Generation, predominantly the Baby Boomers.<ref name=\"The New York Times\"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Gomez|first=Dina|title=The next great generation|url=http://www.saeculumresearch.com/assets/client-assets/files/selected-pubs/NEA-Today-The-Next-Great-Generation.pdf|accessdate=22 December 2012|newspaper=NEA Today, V.19 No.4|date=May 2001}}</ref><ref>Strauss & Howe, 2000.</ref>\n\n==Defining a generation==\nStrauss and Howe define a [[generation#Cultural generation|social generation]] as the aggregate of all people born over a span of roughly twenty years or about the length of one phase of life: [[childhood]], [[young adult (psychology)|young adulthood]], [[middle age|midlife]], and [[old age]].  Generations are identified (from first birthyear to last) by looking for [[Demographics#Generational cohorts|cohort groups]] of this length that share three criteria. First, members of a generation share what the authors call an ''age location in history'': they encounter key historical events and social trends while occupying the same phase of life. In this view, members of a generation are shaped in lasting ways by the eras they encounter as children and young adults and they share certain common ''beliefs and behaviors''. Aware of the experiences and traits that they share with their peers, members of a generation would also share a sense of common ''perceived membership'' in that generation.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1991, pp. 58\u201368.</ref>\n\nThey based their definition of a generation on the work of various writers and social thinkers, from ancient writers such as [[Polybius]] and [[Ibn Khaldun]] to modern social theorists such as [[Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset]], [[Karl Mannheim]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[\u00c9mile Littr\u00e9]], [[Auguste Comte]], and Fran\u00e7ois Mentr\u00e9.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1991, pp. 433\u2013446.</ref>\n\n===Turnings===\nWhile writing ''Generations'', Strauss and Howe described a theorized pattern in the historical generations they examined, which they say revolved around generational events which they call turnings. In ''Generations'', and in greater detail in ''The Fourth Turning'', they describe a four-stage cycle of social or mood eras which they call \"turnings\". The turnings include: \"The High\", \"The Awakening\", \"The Unraveling\" and \"The Crisis\".<ref name=\"Fourth\"/>\n\n====High====\nAccording to Strauss and Howe, the First Turning is a ''High'', which occurs after a Crisis. During ''The High,'' institutions are strong and individualism is weak. Society is confident about where it wants to go collectively, though those outside the majoritarian center often feel stifled by the conformity.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, p. 101.</ref>\n\nAccording to the authors, the most recent First Turning in the US was the [[history of the United States (1945\u201364)|post\u2013World War II American]] High, beginning in 1946 and ending with the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] on November 22, 1963.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, pp. 145\u2013152.</ref>\n\n====Awakening====\nAccording to the theory, the Second Turning is an ''Awakening''. This is an era when institutions are attacked in the name of personal and spiritual autonomy. Just when society is reaching its high tide of public progress, people suddenly tire of social discipline and want to recapture a sense of \"self-awareness\", \"spirituality\" and \"personal authenticity\". Young activists look back at the previous High as an era of cultural and spiritual poverty.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, p. 102.</ref>\n\nStrauss & Howe say the US's most recent Awakening was the \u201cConsciousness Revolution,\u201d which spanned from the campus and inner-city revolts of the mid-1960s to the tax revolts of the early 1980s.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, pp. 171\u2013179.</ref>\n\n====Unraveling====\nAccording to Strauss and Howe, the Third Turning is an ''Unraveling''. The mood of this era they say is in many ways the opposite of a High: Institutions are weak and distrusted, while individualism is strong and flourishing.  The authors say Highs come after Crises, when society wants to coalesce and build and avoid the death and destruction of the previous crisis. Unravelings come after Awakenings, when society wants to atomize and enjoy.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, pp. 102\u2013103.</ref> They say the most recent Unraveling in the US began in the 1980s and includes the [[1990s United States boom|Long Boom]] and [[Culture War]].<ref name=\"Fourth\"/>\n\n====Crisis====\nAccording to the authors, the Fourth Turning is a ''Crisis''. This is an era of destruction, often involving war or revolution, in which institutional life is destroyed and rebuilt in response to a perceived threat to the nation's survival. After the crisis, civic authority revives, cultural expression redirects towards community purpose, and people begin to locate themselves as members of a larger group.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, pp. 103\u2013104.</ref>\n\nThe authors say the previous Fourth Turning in the US began with the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and climaxed with the end of [[World War II]]. The G.I. Generation (which they call a Hero archetype, born 1901 to 1924) came of age during this era. They say their confidence, optimism, and collective outlook epitomized the mood of that era.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, pp. 254\u2013260.</ref> The authors assert the Millennial Generation (which they also describe as a Hero archetype, born 1982 to 2004) show many similar traits to those of the G.I. youth, which they describe as including: rising civic engagement, improving behavior, and collective confidence.<ref>Strauss & Howe 2007, pp. 23\u201324.</ref>\n\n===Cycle===\nThe authors describe each turning as lasting about 20\u201322 years. Four turnings make up a full cycle of about 80 to 90 years,<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, pp. 2\u20133.</ref> which the authors term a ''[[saeculum]]'', after the Latin word meaning both \"a long human life\" and \"a natural century\".<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, pp. 14\u201315.</ref>\n\nGenerational change drives the cycle of turnings and determines its [[Frequency|periodicity]].  As each generation ages into the next life phase (and a new social role) society's mood and behavior fundamentally changes, giving rise to a new turning. Therefore, a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship exists between historical events and generational personas. Historical events shape generations in childhood and young adulthood; then, as parents and leaders in midlife and old age, generations in turn shape history.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, pp. 58p62.</ref>\n\nEach of the four turnings has a distinct mood that recurs every saeculum. Strauss and Howe describe these turnings as the \"seasons of history\". At one extreme is the Awakening, which is analogous to summer, and at the other extreme is the Crisis, which is analogous to winter. The turnings in between are transitional seasons, the High and the Unraveling are similar to spring and autumn, respectively.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, pp. 40\u201341.</ref> Strauss and Howe have discussed 26 theorized turnings over 7 saecula in Anglo-American history, from the year 1435 through today.\n\nAt the heart of Strauss & Howe's ideas is a basic alternation between two different types of eras, Crises and Awakenings. Both of these are defining eras in which people observe that historic events are radically altering their social environment.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1991, pp. 69\u201372.</ref> Crises are periods marked by major secular upheaval, when society focuses on reorganizing the outer world of institutions and public behavior (they say the last American Crisis was the period spanning the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]]). Awakenings are periods marked by cultural or religious renewal, when society focuses on changing the inner world of values and private behavior (the last American Awakening was the \"Consciousness Revolution\" of the [[History of the United States (1964\u20131980)|1960s and 1970s]]).<ref name=\"Strauss & Howe 1991, p. 71\">Strauss & Howe 1991, p. 71.</ref>\n\nDuring Crises, great peril provokes a societal consensus, an ethic of personal sacrifice, and strong institutional order. During Awakenings, an ethic of individualism emerges, and the institutional order is attacked by new social ideals and spiritual agendas.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1991, p. 93.</ref> According to the authors, about every eighty to ninety years\u2014the length of a long human life\u2014a national Crisis occurs in American society. Roughly halfway to the next Crisis, a cultural Awakening occurs (historically, these have often been called [[Great Awakenings]]).<ref name=\"Strauss & Howe 1991, p. 71\"/>\n\nIn describing this cycle of Crises and Awakenings, they draw from the work of other historians and social scientists who have also discussed long cycles in American and [[Europe]]an history.  The cycle of Crises corresponds with long cycles of war identified by such scholars as [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], [[Quincy Wright]], and L. L. Ferrar Jr., and with geopolitical cycles identified by William R. Thompson and [[George Modelski]].<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, pp. 36\u201341.</ref>  Strauss and Howe say their cycle of Awakenings corresponds with [[Anthony FC Wallace|Anthony Wallace]]'s work on [[revitalization movements]];<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, p. 40.</ref> they also say recurring Crises and Awakenings correspond with two-stroke cycles in politics ([[Walter Dean Burnham]], [[Arthur Schlesinger Sr.]] and [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.|Jr.]]), foreign affairs (Frank L. Klingberg), and the economy ([[Nikolai Kondratieff]]) as well as with long-term oscillations in crime and substance abuse.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, pp. 106\u2013116.</ref>\n\n===Archetypes===\nThe authors say two different types of eras and two formative age locations associated with them (childhood and young adulthood) produce four generational ''[[archetypes]]'' that repeat sequentially, in rhythm with the cycle of Crises and Awakenings. In ''Generations'', they refer to these four archetypes as ''Idealist, Reactive, Civic,'' and ''Adaptive''.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1991, pp. 73\u201374.</ref> In ''The Fourth Turning'' (1997) they change this terminology to ''Prophet, Nomad, Hero,'' and ''Artist''.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1997, p. 70.</ref> They say the generations in each archetype not only share a similar age-location in history, they also share some basic attitudes towards family, risk, culture and values, and civic engagement. In essence, generations shaped by similar early-life experiences develop similar collective personas and follow similar life-trajectories.<ref>Strauss & Howe 1991, pp. 357\u2013365.</ref> To date, Strauss and Howe have described 25 generations in Anglo-American history, each with a corresponding archetype. The authors describe the archetypes as follows:\n\n====Prophet====\n[[File:Abelincoln1846.jpeg|thumb|[[Abraham Lincoln]], born in 1809. Strauss and Howe would identify him as a member of the Transcendental generation. ]]\n''Prophet'' (Idealist) generations enter childhood ''during a High'', a time of rejuvenated community life and consensus around a new societal order. Prophets grow up as the increasingly indulged children of this post-Crisis era, come of age as self-absorbed young crusaders of an Awakening, focus on morals and principles in midlife, and emerge as elders guiding another Crisis.<ref name=\"Strauss & Howe 1997, p. 84\">Strauss & Howe 1997, p. 84.</ref> Examples:  [[Era of Good Feelings|Transcendental Generation]], [[Missionary Generation]], [[Baby Boomers]].\n\n====Nomad====\n''Nomad'' (Reactive) generations enter childhood ''during an Awakening'', a time of social ideals and spiritual agendas, when young adults are passionately attacking the established institutional order. Nomads grow up as under-protected children during this Awakening, come of age as [[Social alienation|alienated]], post-Awakening young adults, become pragmatic midlife leaders during a Crisis, and age into resilient post-Crisis elders.<ref name=\"Strauss & Howe 1997, p. 84\"/> Examples: [[Gilded Generation]], [[Lost Generation]], [[Generation X]]\n\n====Hero====\n[[File:Lt.

Kennedy]] (b. 1917). They are part of the [[G.I. Generation]], which follows the Hero archetype.]]\n''Hero'' (Civic) generations enter childhood ''after an Awakening'', ''during an Unraveling'', a time of individual pragmatism, self-reliance, and laissez-faire. Heroes grow up as increasingly protected post-Awakening children, come of age as team-oriented young optimists during a Crisis, emerge as energetic, overly-confident midlifers, and age into politically powerful elders attacked by another Awakening.<ref name=\"Strauss & Howe 1997, p. 84\"/> Examples: [[Republican Generation]], [[G.I. Generation]], [[Millennials]]\n\n====Artist====\n''Artist'' (Adaptive) generations enter childhood ''after an Unraveling,'' ''during a Crisis'', a time when great dangers cut down social and political complexity in favor of public consensus, aggressive institutions, and an ethic of personal sacrifice. Artists grow up overprotected by adults preoccupied with the Crisis, come of age as the socialized and conformist young adults of a post-Crisis world, break out as process-oriented midlife leaders during an Awakening, and age into thoughtful post-Awakening elders.<ref name=\"Strauss & Howe 1997, p. 84\"/> Examples: [[Progressive Generation]], [[Silent Generation]], [[Generation Z]]\n\n=== Summary ===\n* An average life is 80 years, and consists of four periods of ~20-22 years\n** Childhood \u2192 Young adult \u2192 Midlife \u2192 Elderhood\n* A generation is an aggregate of people born every ~20-22 years\n** Baby Boomers \u2192 Gen X \u2192 Millennials \u2192 Homelanders\n* Each generation experiences \"four turnings\" every ~80-90 years\n** High \u2192 Awakening \u2192 Unraveling \u2192 Crisis\n* A generation is considered \"dominant\" or \"recessive\" according to the turning experienced as young adults.

Instead, it resembles the complex, [[List of cycles#Organic cycles|organic cycles]] of biology, where basic intervals endure but precise timing is difficult to predict. Strauss and Howe compare the saecular rhythm to the four seasons, which they say similarly occur in the same order, but with slightly varying timing.

This marked the end of a first turning and the beginning of a second turning.  This is why turning start and end dates don't match up exactly with the generational birth years, but they tend to start and end a few years after the generational year spans.  This also explains why a generation is described to have \"entered childhood\" during a particular turning, rather than \"born during\" a particular turning.}}\n|-\n| [[Humanist Generation]] || Artist (Adaptive)  || align=center|1461\u20131482 (22)|| 4th Turning: Crisis: [[Wars of the Roses|War of the Roses]] || align=center|1459\u20131497 (38)\n|-\n! colspan=5 | Reformation Saeculum (97 years)\n|-\n| [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation Generation]] || Prophet (Idealist) ||align=center|1483\u20131511 (28) || 1st Turning: High: [[English Renaissance|Tudor Renaissance]] || align=center|1497\u20131517 (20)\n|-\n| [[Reprisal Generation]] || Nomad (Reactive) || align=center|1512\u20131540 (29) || 2nd Turning: Awakening: [[Protestant Reformation]] || align=center|1517\u20131542 (25)\n|-\n| Elizabethan Generation || Hero (Civic) || align=center|1541\u20131565 (24) || 3rd Turning: Unraveling: [[Counter reformation|Reaction]] & [[English Reformation#Marian Restoration|Restoration]]|| align=center|1542\u20131569 (27)\n|-\n| Parliamentary Generation || Artist (Adaptive) ||align=center|1566\u20131587 (22)|| 4th Turning: Crisis: [[Spanish Armada|Armada Crisis]] || align=center|1569\u20131594 (25)\n|-\n! colspan=5 | New World Saeculum (110 years)\n|-\n| Puritan Generation || Prophet (Idealist) || align=center|1588\u20131617 (30)|| 1st Turning: High: [[Merry England|Merrie England]] || align=center|1594\u20131621 (27)\n|-\n| [[Cavalier Generation (Strauss-Howe Theory)|Cavalier Generation]] || Nomad (Reactive) || align=center|1618\u20131647 (30) || 2nd Turning: Awakening: [[Puritan Awakening]] || align=center|1621\u20131649 (26)\n|-\n| Glorious Generation || Hero (Civic) || align=center|1648\u20131673 (26)|| 3rd Turning: Unraveling: [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] || align=center|1649\u20131675 (26)\n|-\n| Enlightenment Generation || Artist (Adaptive) ||align=center|1674\u20131700 (27)|| 4th Turning: Crisis: [[Glorious Revolution]] || align=center|1675\u20131704 (29)\n|-\n! colspan=5 | Revolutionary Saeculum (90 years)\n|-\n| Awakening Generation || Prophet (Idealist) || align=center|1701\u20131723 (23) || 1st Turning: High: [[Augustan literature|Augustan Age of Empire]] || align=center|1704\u20131727 (23)\n|-\n| [[Liberty Generation]] || Nomad (Reactive) || align=center|1724\u20131741 (18) || 2nd Turning: Awakening: [[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]] || align=center|1727\u20131746 (19)\n|-\n| [[Republican Generation]] || Hero (Civic) || align=center|1742\u20131766 (25)|| 3rd Turning: Unraveling: [[French and Indian War]] || align=\"center\" | 1746\u20131773 (27)\n|-\n| Compromise Generation || Artist (Adaptive) || align=center|1767\u20131791 (23)|| 4th Turning: Crisis: [[American Revolution]] || align=center|1773\u20131794 (21)\n|-\n! colspan=5 | Civil War Saeculum (71 years)\n|-\n| Transcendental Generation || Prophet (Idealist) ||align=center|1792\u20131821 (28)|| 1st Turning: High: [[Era of Good Feelings]] || align=center|1794\u20131822 (28)\n|-\n| [[Gilded Generation (Strauss\u2013Howe theory)|Gilded Generation]] || Nomad (Reactive)   || align=center|1822\u20131842 (21)|| 2nd Turning: Awakening: [[Second Great Awakening|Transcendental Awakening]]|| align=center|1822\u20131844 (22)\n|-\n| {{efn|According to Strauss and Howe their generational types have appeared in Anglo-American history in a fixed order for more than 500 years with one hitch, occurring in the Civil War Saeculum.

Among professional historians, it faces a tougher sell. Period specialists will resist the idea that their period is akin to several others. Sweeping theories of history are long out of fashion in the halls of ivy, and the authors' lack of academic standing won't help their cause. Their generational quartet is \"just too wooden\" and \"too neat,\" says one Yale historian. \"Prediction is for prophets,\" scoffed William McLoughlin (a former history professor at Brown), who said it is wrong to think that \"if you put enough data together and have enough charts and graphs, you've made history into a science.\" He also said the book might get a friendlier reception in sociology and political science departments than the science department.<ref name=\"Pershall\"/>\n\nSociologist [[David Riesman]] and political scientist [[Richard Neustadt]] offered strong, if qualified, praise.

One of the things to understand is that most historians never look at history in terms of generations. They prefer to tell history as a seamless row of 55-year-old leaders who always tend to think and behave the same way -- but they don't and they never have. If you look at the way America's 55-year-old leaders were acting in the 1960s -- you know, the ebullience and confidence of the JFKs and LBJs and Hubert Humphreys -- and compare them with today's leaders in Congress -- the indecision, the lack of sure-footedness -- I think you would have to agree that 55-year-olds do not always act the same way and you're dealing with powerful generational forces at work that explain why one generation of war veterans, war heroes, and another generation which came of age in very different circumstances tend to have very different instincts about acting in the world.\u201d<ref name=\"Booknotes\"/>\n\nResponding to criticisms in 1991, William Strauss accepted that some historians might not like their theory, which they presented as a new [[paradigm]] for looking at American history, that filled a need for a unifying vision of American history:\n\n{{quote|People are looking for a new way to connect themselves to the larger story of America. That is the problem. We've felt adrift over the past 10 years, and we think that the way history has been presented over the past couple of decades has been more in terms of the little pieces and people are not as interested in the little pieces now. They're looking for a unifying vision. We haven't had unifying visions of the story of America for decades now, and we're trying to provide it in this book.\n\nThe kinds of historians who are drawn to our book -- and I'm sure it will be very controversial among academics because we are presenting something that is so new -- but the kinds who are drawn to it are the ones who themselves have focused on the human life cycle rather than just the sequential series of events. Some good examples of that are Morton Keller up at Brandeis and [[David Hackett Fischer]].

A 2009, ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' report commented Howe and Strauss based these core traits on a \"hodgepodge of anecdotes, statistics, and pop-culture references\" and on surveys of approximately 600 high-school seniors from [[Fairfax County, Virginia]], an affluent county with median household income approximately twice the national average. The report described ''Millennials Rising'' as a \"good-news revolution\" making \"sweeping predictions\" and as describing Millennials as \"rule followers who were engaged, optimistic, and downright pleasant\", commenting the \"book gave educators and tens of millions of parents, a warm feeling, saying who wouldn't want to hear that their kids are special?\"<ref name=Hoover />\n\n===General===\nIn 2006, Frank Giancola wrote an article in ''Human Resource Planning'' that stated \"the emphasis on generational differences is not generally borne out by empirical research, despite its popularity\".<ref name=Giancola>{{Cite journal | title = The Generation Gap: More Myth than Reality | journal = Human Resource Planning | year = 2006 | volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=32\u201337 |author = Giancola, Frank |quote=Research and expert opinion do not fully support the generational premise.

is located on the largest island in the [[Turks Islands]] <!--not the Caicos island--> [[archipelago]], [[Grand Turk Island]]. Historic 18th and 19th century Bermudian architecture line Duke and Front Streets in the town. The town is known for its long, narrow streets and old street lamps.\n\nThe closest [[anchor]]age to Cockburn Town is Hawk's Nest Anchorage, which, though sheltered, should only be entered in good light because of [[reef]]s near the entrance.\n\n==History==\nThe seat of government ever since 1766, Cockburn Town was the first permanent settlement on any of the islands, founded in 1681 by salt collectors who arrived in the Turks and Caicos Islands. The city supposedly lies on the place where [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n]] first landed on the island.\n\n==Main sights==\n\n===National Museum===\n[[File:Turks & Caicos National Museum.jpg|thumb|left|National Museum on Front Street]]\n\nCockburn Town is home to the Turks & Caicos National Museum, which is housed in the colonial-era Guinep House, on Front Street.  The house is believed to be over 180 years old and much of its structural material came from local [[shipwreck]]s, including a ship's mast, which is one of the building's main supports.  The site was donated to the Museum in 1990.<ref>[http://www.tcmuseum.org/guinep_house/ \"Guinep House\".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728082451/http://www.tcmuseum.org/guinep_house/ |date=2011-07-28 }} [http://www.tcmuseum.org ''Turks & Caicos National Museum''.] Retrieved January 29, 2010.</ref>\n\nAmong the National Museum's collections is an exhibit of shipwrecks, including the oldest known European shipwreck in the [[Americas]], the [[Molasses Reef Wreck]], dated 1505.<ref>[http://www.tcmuseum.org/molasses_reef_shipwreck/ \"Molasses Reef Shipwreck\".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123172540/http://www.tcmuseum.org/molasses_reef_shipwreck |date=2010-01-23 }} [http://www.tcmuseum.org ''Turks & Caicos National Museum''.] Retrieved January 29, 2010.</ref>\n\nOther exhibits detail the history of the [[Lucayans]], the [[Space Race]], Turks and Caicos [[postage stamp]]s, slavery and the history of the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]], the [[sisal]] and [[Salt evaporation pond|salt]] industries, royal events, as well as a general history of the islands.  The museum also maintains a garden, which is adjacent to the Guinep House.<ref>[http://www.tcmuseum.org ''Turks & Caicos National Museum''.] Retrieved January 29, 2010.</ref>\n\nAlso of interest are the museum's research projects, including its Message in a Bottle Project, recording nearly 40 years' worth of messages to wash upon the shores of Grand Turk.<ref>[http://tcmuseum.org/collections/message-in-a-bottle/ \"Message in a Bottle\".] [http://www.tcmuseum.org ''Turks & Caicos National Museum''.] Retrieved January 29, 2010.</ref>\n\n===Her Majesty's Prison===\n\"Her Majesty's Prison\" on Pond Street was built in the 1830s and remained in operation until 1994.

Later in the century, many Greek mercenaries were employed by Persian [[satrap]]s, especially in [[Anatolia]]. During the [[Peloponnesian War]], mercenaries from [[Thrace]] and other outlying regions were hired by both sides as [[hoplite]]s and [[peltast]]s. In 401 BC, many Greeks supported [[Cyrus the Younger]] in his campaign against [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] and fought at the [[Battle of Cunaxa]].

As [[Hysiae, Argolis|Hysiae]] is in [[Argolis]], it is assumed that the Spartans had invaded. The Argives won the battle and so repulsed the invasion.<ref name=\"BM524\">{{harvnb | Bury | Meiggs | 1975 | p=524}}</ref> Argos, then ruled by [[Pheidon II]], thus confirmed its continuing dominance in the [[Peloponnese]], unbroken since the [[Dorian invasion]] and it is thought that this was the peak of Argive power.<ref name=\"BM524\"/> The battle marked a turning point in both Greek and military history as it caused the Spartans to adopt the [[phalanx]] of [[hoplite]]s as their key strategy in place of the loose spear-throwing formations prevalent until then. The phalanx was to revolutionise warfare.\n\nIt is in the 7th century that mercenaries are mentioned in the [[lyric poetry]] works of [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] and [[Archilochus]].\n\nArgos went into decline after the death of Pheidon c.655 but tyrannies became common throughout the Greek world, starting with [[Cypselus]] of [[Corinth]] from c.655 to c.625.<ref name=\"BM106\">{{harvnb | Bury | Meiggs | 1975 | p=106}}</ref> He was succeeded by his son [[Periander]] to c.585.

He was also a [[lyric poetry|lyric poet]] and left a [[skolion]] (drinking song) called the ''spear-song'' in which he proclaimed himself a great warrior: \"I have great wealth \u2014 a spear, a sword and a fine shield to save my skin. With these I plough, I reap, I tread the sweet grapes and am called master of my serfs. All those that dare not hold the spear and sword and fine shield to save their skin, all bow and kiss my knee, calling me master and great king\".<ref name=\"PJSpec\">{{cite web | url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/01/ancient-and-modern-the-mercenaries-of-is-and-ancient-greece/ | title=Ancient and Modern: The mercenaries of IS and ancient Greece | last=Jones | first=Peter | website=The Spectator | date=16 January 2016 | accessdate=18 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==5th century BC==\nGreek [[hoplites]] were widely admired for their skill as soldiers. The demand led many Greeks who faced poverty or exile to enlist as mercenaries in the pay of another state. Others, not so burdened with worry, became mercenaries through a desire for loot and adventure.<ref name=\"PJSpec\"/>\n\n==4th century BC==\nIn many Greek states, including Athens, the threats from Persia and Macedon required strong defensive forces. One of the main problems in creating and maintaining military strength was that peasant citizens could not afford to abandon their smallholdings for long periods of service and so the demand for professional soldiers increased. The orator [[Isocrates]] was highly critical of Athens for employing mercenaries whom he denounced as the \"common enemies of mankind\". Athenian citizens, he said, must not be \"rejoicing in the atrocities of such violent, lawless brigands\".<ref name=\"PJSpec\"/>\n\n[[Aristotle]] accepted that mercenaries were competent but he doubted their courage and loyalty. In his view, mercenaries \"become cowards when the danger seems too great for them\", being the \"first to run\" when defeat is imminent. Aristotle argued in favour of citizen soldiers who see flight from battle as a disgrace, preferring death with honour. Mercenaries, said Aristotle, \"fear death more than shame\".<ref name=\"PJSpec\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n===Books===\n* {{cite book | ref=harv | last1=Bury | first1=J.

The Argives won the battle and so repulsed the invasion.<ref name=\"BM524\">{{harvnb | Bury | Meiggs | 1975 | p=524}}</ref> Argos, then ruled by [[Pheidon II]], thus confirmed its continuing dominance in the [[Peloponnese]], unbroken since the [[Dorian invasion]] and it is thought that this was the peak of Argive power.<ref name=\"BM524\"/> The battle marked a turning point in both Greek and military history as it caused the Spartans to adopt the [[phalanx]] of [[hoplite]]s as their key strategy in place of the loose spear-throwing formations prevalent until then. The phalanx was to revolutionise warfare.\n\nIt is in the 7th century that mercenaries are mentioned in the [[lyric poetry]] works of [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] and [[Archilochus]].\n\nArgos went into decline after the death of Pheidon c.655 but tyrannies became common throughout the Greek world, starting with [[Cypselus]] of [[Corinth]] from c.655 to c.625.<ref name=\"BM106\">{{harvnb | Bury | Meiggs | 1975 | p=106}}</ref> He was succeeded by his son [[Periander]] to c.585. He was contemporary with [[Thrasybulus]], tyrant of [[Miletus]] from c.615 to c.590.

He eventually concluded a peace treaty with [[Alyattes of Lydia|Alyattes]].<ref name=\"BM107\"/>\n\n==6th century BC==\nA noted Cretan mercenary of this time was [[Hybrias]]. He was also a [[lyric poetry|lyric poet]] and left a [[skolion]] (drinking song) called the ''spear-song'' in which he proclaimed himself a great warrior: \"I have great wealth \u2014 a spear, a sword and a fine shield to save my skin. With these I plough, I reap, I tread the sweet grapes and am called master of my serfs.

The demand led many Greeks who faced poverty or exile to enlist as mercenaries in the pay of another state. Others, not so burdened with worry, became mercenaries through a desire for loot and adventure.<ref name=\"PJSpec\"/>\n\n==4th century BC==\nIn many Greek states, including Athens, the threats from Persia and Macedon required strong defensive forces. One of the main problems in creating and maintaining military strength was that peasant citizens could not afford to abandon their smallholdings for long periods of service and so the demand for professional soldiers increased. The orator [[Isocrates]] was highly critical of Athens for employing mercenaries whom he denounced as the \"common enemies of mankind\". Athenian citizens, he said, must not be \"rejoicing in the atrocities of such violent, lawless brigands\".<ref name=\"PJSpec\"/>\n\n[[Aristotle]] accepted that mercenaries were competent but he doubted their courage and loyalty. In his view, mercenaries \"become cowards when the danger seems too great for them\", being the \"first to run\" when defeat is imminent. Aristotle argued in favour of citizen soldiers who see flight from battle as a disgrace, preferring death with honour. Mercenaries, said Aristotle, \"fear death more than shame\".<ref name=\"PJSpec\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n===Books===\n* {{cite book | ref=harv | last1=Bury | first1=J.

This includes all digits ''except'':<ref>''Chemistry in the Community''; Kendall-Hunt:Dubuque, IA 1988</ref>\n\n*  All [[leading zeros]]. For example, \"013.\" has two significant figures: 1 and 3;\n* [[Trailing zeros]] when they are merely placeholders to indicate the scale of the number (exact rules are explained at [[#Identifying significant figures|identifying significant figures]]); and\n* [[wikt:spurious|Spurious]] digits introduced, for example, by calculations carried out to greater precision than that of the original data, or measurements reported to a greater precision than the equipment supports.\n\nOf the significant figures in a number, the '''most significant''' is the position with the highest exponent value (the left-most in normal decimal notation), and the '''least significant''' is the position with the lowest exponent value (the right-most in normal decimal notation).\n \n[[Significance arithmetic]] is a set of approximate rules for roughly maintaining significance throughout a computation.  The more sophisticated scientific rules are known as [[propagation of uncertainty]].\n\nNumbers are often [[rounding|rounded]] to avoid reporting insignificant figures. For example, it would create [[false precision]] to express a measurement as 12.34525&nbsp;kg (which has seven significant figures) if the scales only measured to the nearest gram and gave a reading of 12.345&nbsp;kg (which has five significant figures). Numbers can also be rounded merely for simplicity rather than to indicate a given precision of measurement, for example, to make them faster to pronounce in news broadcasts or other things.\n\n==Identifying significant figures==\n\n===Concise rules===\n[[File:Sigfigs.png|thumb|Digits in red are significant figures; those in black are not]]\n*All non-zero digits are significant: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n*Zeros between non-zero digits are significant: 102, 2005, 50009.\n*Leading zeros are never significant: 0.02, 001.887, 0.000515.\n*In a number ''with'' or '' without'' a decimal point, trailing zeros (those to the right of the last non-zero digit) are significant provided they are justified by the precision of their derivation: 389,000; 2.02000; 5.400; 57.5400. More information through additional graphical symbols or explicit information on errors is needed to clarify the significance or importance of trailing zeros.\n\n===Significant figures rules explained===\nSpecifically, the rules for identifying significant figures when writing or interpreting numbers are as follows:<ref>Giving a precise definition for the number of correct significant digits is surprisingly subtle, see {{cite book |first= Nicholas |last= Higham |title= Accuracy and Stability of Numerical Algorithms |edition= 2nd |publisher= SIAM |year= 2002 |pages = 3\u20135  | url=http://ftp.demec.ufpr.br/CFD/bibliografia/Higham_2002_Accuracy%20and%20Stability%20of%20Numerical%20Algorithms.pdf}}</ref>\n*All non-zero digits are considered significant. For example, 91 has two significant figures (9 and 1), while 123.45 has five significant figures (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5).\n*Zeros appearing anywhere between two non-zero digits are significant: 101.1203 has seven significant figures: 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0 and 3.\n* Zeros to the left of the significant figures are not significant. For example, 0.00052 has two significant figures: 5 and 2.\n\nZeros to the right of the significant figures are significant if and only if they are justified by the precision of their derivation. For example, 12.2300 may have six significant figures: 1, 2, 2, 3, 0 and 0. The number 0.000122300 still has only six significant figures (the zeros before the 1 are not significant). In addition, 120.00 has five significant figures since it has three trailing zeros. In most contexts it is understood that trailing zeros are only shown if they are significant: for example, if a measurement precise to four decimal places (0.0001) were to be given as 12.23, then it would usually be misunderstood to indicate that only two decimal places of precision are available. Stating the result as 12.2300, however, makes clear that it is precise to four decimal places (in this case, six significant figures).\n\n*The significance of trailing zeros in a number not containing a decimal point can be ambiguous. For example, it may not always be clear if a number like 1300 is precise to the nearest unit (and just happens coincidentally to be an exact multiple of a hundred) or if it is only shown to the nearest hundred due to rounding or uncertainty. Many conventions exist to address this issue, but these conventions are mostly esoteric and not understood by those who are not specialists in the subject:\n\n:*An [[overline]], sometimes also called an overbar, or less accurately, a [[Vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]], may be placed over the last significant figure; any trailing zeros following this are insignificant. For example, 13{{overline|0}}0 has three significant figures (and hence indicates that the number is precise to the nearest ten).\n\n:*Less often, using a closely related convention, the last significant figure of a number may be [[underline]]d; for example, \"2<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">0</span>00\" has two significant figures.\n\n:*A decimal point may be placed after the number; for example \"100.\" indicates specifically that three significant figures are meant.<ref name=\"Chemistry Significant Figures\">{{cite book |last= Myers |first= R. Thomas |last2= Oldham |first2= Keith B. |last3= Tocci |first3= Salvatore |title= Chemistry |year= 2000 |publisher= Holt Rinehart Winston |location= Austin, Texas |isbn= 0-03-052002-9 |page= [https://archive.org/details/holtchemistryvis00myer/page/59 59] |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/holtchemistryvis00myer/page/59 }}</ref>\n\n:*In the combination of a number and a [[unit of measurement]], the ambiguity can be avoided by choosing a suitable [[unit prefix]]. For example, the number of significant figures in a mass specified as 1300&nbsp;g is ambiguous, while if stated as 1.3&nbsp;kg it is not.\n\n:*The number can be expressed in Scientific Notation (see below).\n\nAs these conventions are not in general use, it is often necessary to determine from context whether such trailing zeros are intended to be significant. If all else fails, the level of rounding can be specified explicitly. The abbreviation s.f. is sometimes used, for example \"20&nbsp;000 to 2&nbsp;s.f.\" or \"20&nbsp;000 (2&nbsp;sf)\". Alternatively, the uncertainty can be stated separately and explicitly with a [[plus-minus sign]], as in 20&nbsp;000&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;1%, so that significant-figures rules do not apply.  This also allows specifying a precision in-between powers of ten.\n\n===Scientific notation===\nIn most cases, the same rules apply to numbers expressed in [[scientific notation]]. However, in the normalized form of that notation, placeholder leading and trailing digits do not occur, so all digits are significant. For example, {{val|0.00012}} (two significant figures) becomes {{val|1.2|e=-4}}, and {{val|0.00122300}} (six significant figures) becomes {{val|1.22300|e=-3}}. In particular, the potential ambiguity about the significance of trailing zeros is eliminated. For example, {{val|1300}} to four significant figures is written as {{val|1.300|e=3}}, while {{val|1300}} to two significant figures is written as {{val|1.3|e=3}}.\n\nThe part of the representation that contains the significant figures (as opposed to the base or the exponent) is known as the [[significand]] or mantissa.\n\n==Rounding and decimal places==\n\nThe basic concept of significant figures is often used in connection with [[rounding]]. Rounding to significant figures is a more general-purpose technique than rounding to ''n'' decimal places, since it handles numbers of different scales in a uniform way. For example, the population of a city might only be known to the nearest thousand and be stated as 52,000, while the population of a country might only be known to the nearest million and be stated as 52,000,000. The former might be in error by hundreds, and the latter might be in error by hundreds of thousands, but both have two significant figures (5 and 2). This reflects the fact that the significance of the error is the same in both cases, relative to the size of the quantity being measured.\n\nTo round to ''n'' significant figures:<ref>{{cite web\n|title = Rounding Decimal Numbers to a Designated Precision\n|author = Engelbrecht, Nancy|display-authors=etal\n|year = 1990\n|publisher = U.S. Department of Education\n|location = Washington, D.C.\n|url = https://archive.org/download/ERIC_ED327701/ERIC_ED327701.pdf\n|format = PDF}}</ref><ref name=\"Numerical Mathematics and Computing, by Cheney and Kincaid\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUfVZELlrMEC&pg=PA321&lpg=PA321&dq=Condition+Number+Rule+of+Thumb&source=bl&ots=kMuMoeATcB&sig=22t9ml1TcXKbve-nAkkTJ-qAf1g&hl=en&ei=A5abTIvGOsaMnQe_17TpDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Condition%20Number%20Rule%20of%20Thumb&f=false Numerical Mathematics and Computing, by Cheney and Kincaid].</ref>\n\n* Identify the significant figures before rounding.  These are the ''n'' consecutive digits beginning with the first non-zero digit.\n* If the digit immediately to the right of the last significant figure is greater than 5 or is a 5 followed by other non-zero digits, add 1 to the last significant figure. For example, 1.2459 as the result of a calculation or measurement that only allows for 3 significant figures should be written 1.25.\n* If the digit immediately to the right of the last significant figure is a 5 not followed by any other digits or followed only by zeros, rounding requires a [[Rounding#Tie-breaking|tie-breaking]] rule. For example, to round 1.25 to 2 significant figures:\n**[[Rounding#Round half away from zero|Round half away from zero]] (also known as \"5/4\"){{Citation needed|date=August 2018|reason=By who?}} rounds up to 1.3. This is the default rounding method implied in many disciplines{{Citation needed|date=August 2018|reason=How many, and which, disciplines?}} if not specified.\n** [[Rounding#Round half to even|Round half to even]], which rounds to the nearest even number, rounds down to 1.2 in this case. The same strategy applied to 1.35 would instead round up to 1.4. This is the method preferred by many scientific disciplines, because, for example, it avoids skewing the average value of a long list of values upwards.\n* Replace non-significant figures in front of the decimal point by zeros.\n* Drop all the digits after the decimal point to the right of the significant figures (do not replace them with zeros).\n\nIn financial calculations, a number is often rounded to a given number of places (for example, to two places after the [[decimal separator]] for many world currencies). This is done because greater precision is immaterial, and usually it is not possible to settle a debt of less than the smallest currency unit.\n\nIn UK personal tax returns income is rounded down to the nearest pound, whilst tax paid is calculated to the nearest penny.\n\nAs an illustration, the [[decimal]] quantity '''12.345''' can be expressed with various numbers of significant digits or decimal places.  If insufficient precision is available then the number is [[rounding|rounded]] in some manner to fit the available precision.  The following table shows the results for various total precisions and decimal places.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! &nbsp;<br>Precision\n! Rounded to<br>significant figures\n!

Exact mathematical quantities like the {{math|\u03c0}} in the formula for the [[area of a disk|area of a circle]] with radius {{math|''r''}}, {{math|\u03c0''r''<sup>2</sup>}} has no effect on the number of significant figures in the final calculated area.

The constants {{math|\u03c0}} and {{math|\u00bd}} are considered for this purpose to have an ''infinite'' number of significant figures.\n\nFor quantities created from measured quantities by '''multiplication''' and '''division''', the calculated result should have as many significant figures as the ''measured'' number with the ''least'' number of significant figures.  For example, \n:1.234 \u00d7 2.0 =  2.{{overline|4}}68\u2026 \u2248 2.5, \nwith only ''two'' significant figures. The first factor has four significant figures and the second has two significant figures. The factor with the least number of significant figures is the second one with only two, so the final calculated result should also have a total of two significant figures. However see below regarding intermediate results.\n\nFor quantities created from measured quantities by '''addition''' and '''subtraction''', the last significant [[Positional notation|''decimal place'']] (hundreds, tens, ones, tenths, and so forth) in the calculated result should be the same as the ''leftmost'' or largest ''decimal place'' of the last significant figure out of all the ''measured'' quantities in the terms of the sum.  For example, \n:100.0 + 1.234 = 101.{{overline|2}}34\u2026 \u2248 101.2 \nwith the last significant figure in the ''tenths'' place. The first term has its last significant figure in the tenths place and the second term has its last significant figure in the thousandths place. The leftmost of the decimal places of the last significant figure out of all the terms of the sum is the tenths place from the first term, so the calculated result should also have its last significant figure in the tenths place.\n\nThe rules for calculating significant figures for multiplication and division are opposite to the rules for addition and subtraction. For multiplication and division, only the total number of significant figures in each of the factors matters; the decimal place of the last significant figure in each factor is irrelevant. For addition and subtraction, only the decimal place of the last significant figure in each of the terms matters; the total number of significant figures in each term is irrelevant. However, greater accuracy will often be obtained if some non-significant digits are maintained in intermediate results which are used in subsequent calculations.\n\n<!-- see [[Significance arithmetic#Addition and subtraction using significance arithmetic]] for details -->\nIn a [[Base (exponentiation)|base]] 10 [[logarithm]] of a [[normalized number]], the result should be rounded to the number of significant figures in the normalized number.

However, in practice a measurement can usually be estimated by eye to closer than the interval between the ruler's smallest mark, e.g. in the above case it might be estimated as between 4.51&nbsp;cm and 4.53&nbsp;cm (see below).\n\nIt is also possible that the overall length of a ruler may not be accurate to the degree of the smallest mark, and the marks may be imperfectly spaced within each unit. However assuming a normal good quality ruler, it should be possible to estimate tenths between the nearest two marks to achieve an extra decimal place of accuracy.<ref name=\"Weston\">{{cite book|title=Experimental Electrical Testing|url=https://archive.org/details/experimentalele00njgoog|quote=Experimental Electrical Testing..|date=1914|publisher=Weston Electrical Instruments Co.|location=Newark, NJ|page=[https://archive.org/details/experimentalele00njgoog/page/n14 9]|accessdate=14 January 2019}}</ref> Failing to do this adds the error in reading the ruler to any error in the calibration of the ruler.<ref name=\"UMmeasurements\">{{cite web|title=Measurements|url=http://slc.umd.umich.edu/slconline/SIGF/page7.html|website=slc.umd.umich.edu|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=3 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Estimation==\n{{Main|Estimation}}\nWhen estimating the proportion of individuals carrying some particular characteristic in a population, from a random sample of that population, the number of significant figures should not exceed the maximum precision allowed by that sample size.\n\n==Relationship to accuracy and precision in measurement==\n{{main|Accuracy and precision}}\n\nTraditionally, in various technical fields, \"accuracy\" refers to the closeness of a given measurement to its true value; \"precision\" refers to the stability of that measurement when repeated many times.  Hoping to reflect the way the term \"accuracy\" is actually used in the scientific community, there is a more recent standard, ISO 5725, which keeps the same definition of precision but defines the term \"trueness\" as the closeness of a given measurement to its true value and uses the term \"accuracy\" as the combination of trueness and precision.  (See the [[Accuracy and precision]] article for a fuller discussion.)  In either case, the number of significant figures roughly corresponds to ''precision'', not to either use of the word accuracy or to the newer concept of trueness. <!--The smaller digits are not significant because they effectively random noise generated by the measurement process having little to do with the true value; they, they can be omitted for some reporting purposes. (This approach ignores techniques such as averaging to produce a higher-precision result.) *****NOTE: Aside from being broken grammatically, the previous blanket statement is unlikely to be true\u2014it depends on the precision of the instruments and the exact situation. -->\n\n==In computing==\n{{main|Floating point}}\nComputer representations of [[floating point numbers]] typically use a form of rounding to significant figures, but with [[binary number]]s. The number of correct significant figures is closely related to the notion of [[Approximation error|relative error]] (which has the advantage of being a more accurate measure of precision, and is independent of the radix, also known as the base, of the number system used).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Accuracy and precision]]\n*[[Benford's Law]] (First Digit Law)\n*[[Engineering notation]]\n*[[Error bar]]\n*[[False precision]]\n*[[IEEE754]] (IEEE floating point standard)\n*[[Interval arithmetic]]\n*[[Kahan summation algorithm]]\n*[[Precision (computer science)]]\n*[[Round-off error]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.khanacademy.org/video/significant-figures?playlist=Pre-algebra Significant Figures Video by Khan academy]\n* [https://www.calculators.tech/sig-fig-calculator Significant Figures Calculator by Calculators.tech]\n\n[[Category:Arithmetic]]\n[[Category:Numerical analysis]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=July 2013|talk=Problems}}\n{{Redir|First digit|the body part|First digit (anatomy)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2019|cs1-dates=y}}\n{{Order-of-approx}}\nThe '''significant figures''' (also known as the '''significant digits''' and '''decimal places''') of a number are [[Numerical digit|digits]] that carry meaning contributing to its [[Accuracy and precision|measurement resolution]]. This includes all digits ''except'':<ref>''Chemistry in the Community''; Kendall-Hunt:Dubuque, IA 1988</ref>\n\n*  All [[leading zeros]]. For example, \"013.\" has two significant figures: 1 and 3;\n* [[Trailing zeros]] when they are merely placeholders to indicate the scale of the number (exact rules are explained at [[#Identifying significant figures|identifying significant figures]]); and\n* [[wikt:spurious|Spurious]] digits introduced, for example, by calculations carried out to greater precision than that of the original data, or measurements reported to a greater precision than the equipment supports.\n\nOf the significant figures in a number, the '''most significant''' is the position with the highest exponent value (the left-most in normal decimal notation), and the '''least significant''' is the the position with the lowest exponent value (the right-most in normal decimal notation).\n \n[[Significance arithmetic]] is a set of approximate rules for roughly maintaining significance throughout a computation.  The more sophisticated scientific rules are known as [[propagation of uncertainty]].\n\nNumbers are often [[rounding|rounded]] to avoid reporting insignificant figures. For example, it would create [[false precision]] to express a measurement as 12.34525&nbsp;kg (which has seven significant figures) if the scales only measured to the nearest gram and gave a reading of 12.345&nbsp;kg (which has five significant figures). Numbers can also be rounded merely for simplicity rather than to indicate a given precision of measurement, for example, to make them faster to pronounce in news broadcasts or other things.\n\n==Identifying significant figures==\n\n===Concise rules===\n[[File:Sigfigs.png|thumb|Digits in red are significant figures; those in black are not]]\n*All non-zero digits are significant: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n*Zeros between non-zero digits are significant: 102, 2005, 50009.\n*Leading zeros are never significant: 0.02, 001.887, 0.000515.\n*In a number ''with'' or '' without'' a decimal point, trailing zeros (those to the right of the last non-zero digit) are significant provided they are justified by the precision of their derivation: 389,000; 2.02000; 5.400; 57.5400. More information through additional graphical symbols or explicit information on errors is needed to clarify the significance or importance of trailing zeros.\n\n===Significant figures rules explained===\nSpecifically, the rules for identifying significant figures when writing or interpreting numbers are as follows:<ref>Giving a precise definition for the number of correct significant digits is surprisingly subtle, see {{cite book |first= Nicholas |last= Higham |title= Accuracy and Stability of Numerical Algorithms |edition= 2nd |publisher= SIAM |year= 2002 |pages = 3\u20135  | url=http://ftp.demec.ufpr.br/CFD/bibliografia/Higham_2002_Accuracy%20and%20Stability%20of%20Numerical%20Algorithms.pdf}}</ref>\n*All non-zero digits are considered significant. For example, 91 has two significant figures (9 and 1), while 123.45 has five significant figures (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5).\n*Zeros appearing anywhere between two non-zero digits are significant: 101.1203 has seven significant figures: 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0 and 3.\n* Zeros to the left of the significant figures are not significant. For example, 0.00052 has two significant figures: 5 and 2.\n\nZeros to the right of the significant figures are significant if and only if they are justified by the precision of their derivation. For example, 12.2300 may have six significant figures: 1, 2, 2, 3, 0 and 0. The number 0.000122300 still has only six significant figures (the zeros before the 1 are not significant). In addition, 120.00 has five significant figures since it has three trailing zeros. In most contexts it is understood that trailing zeros are only shown if they are significant: for example, if a measurement precise to four decimal places (0.0001) were to be given as 12.23, then it would usually be misunderstood to indicate that only two decimal places of precision are available. Stating the result as 12.2300, however, makes clear that it is precise to four decimal places (in this case, six significant figures).\n\n*The significance of trailing zeros in a number not containing a decimal point can be ambiguous. For example, it may not always be clear if a number like 1300 is precise to the nearest unit (and just happens coincidentally to be an exact multiple of a hundred) or if it is only shown to the nearest hundred due to rounding or uncertainty. Many conventions exist to address this issue, but these conventions are mostly esoteric and not understood by those who are not specialists in the subject:\n\n:*An [[overline]], sometimes also called an overbar, or less accurately, a [[Vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]], may be placed over the last significant figure; any trailing zeros following this are insignificant. For example, 13{{overline|0}}0 has three significant figures (and hence indicates that the number is precise to the nearest ten).\n\n:*Less often, using a closely related convention, the last significant figure of a number may be [[underline]]d; for example, \"2<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">0</span>00\" has two significant figures.\n\n:*A decimal point may be placed after the number; for example \"100.\" indicates specifically that three significant figures are meant.<ref name=\"Chemistry Significant Figures\">{{cite book |last= Myers |first= R. Thomas |last2= Oldham |first2= Keith B. |last3= Tocci |first3= Salvatore |title= Chemistry |year= 2000 |publisher= Holt Rinehart Winston |location= Austin, Texas |isbn= 0-03-052002-9 |page= [https://archive.org/details/holtchemistryvis00myer/page/59 59] |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/holtchemistryvis00myer/page/59 }}</ref>\n\n:*In the combination of a number and a [[unit of measurement]], the ambiguity can be avoided by choosing a suitable [[unit prefix]]. For example, the number of significant figures in a mass specified as 1300&nbsp;g is ambiguous, while if stated as 1.3&nbsp;kg it is not.\n\n:*The number can be expressed in Scientific Notation (see below).\n\nAs these conventions are not in general use, it is often necessary to determine from context whether such trailing zeros are intended to be significant. If all else fails, the level of rounding can be specified explicitly. The abbreviation s.f. is sometimes used, for example \"20&nbsp;000 to 2&nbsp;s.f.\" or \"20&nbsp;000 (2&nbsp;sf)\". Alternatively, the uncertainty can be stated separately and explicitly with a [[plus-minus sign]], as in 20&nbsp;000&nbsp;\u00b1&nbsp;1%, so that significant-figures rules do not apply.  This also allows specifying a precision in-between powers of ten.\n\n===Scientific notation===\nIn most cases, the same rules apply to numbers expressed in [[scientific notation]]. However, in the normalized form of that notation, placeholder leading and trailing digits do not occur, so all digits are significant. For example, {{val|0.00012}} (two significant figures) becomes {{val|1.2|e=-4}}, and {{val|0.00122300}} (six significant figures) becomes {{val|1.22300|e=-3}}. In particular, the potential ambiguity about the significance of trailing zeros is eliminated. For example, {{val|1300}} to four significant figures is written as {{val|1.300|e=3}}, while {{val|1300}} to two significant figures is written as {{val|1.3|e=3}}.\n\nThe part of the representation that contains the significant figures (as opposed to the base or the exponent) is known as the [[significand]] or mantissa.\n\n==Rounding and decimal places==\n\nThe basic concept of significant figures is often used in connection with [[rounding]]. Rounding to significant figures is a more general-purpose technique than rounding to ''n'' decimal places, since it handles numbers of different scales in a uniform way. For example, the population of a city might only be known to the nearest thousand and be stated as 52,000, while the population of a country might only be known to the nearest million and be stated as 52,000,000. The former might be in error by hundreds, and the latter might be in error by hundreds of thousands, but both have two significant figures (5 and 2). This reflects the fact that the significance of the error is the same in both cases, relative to the size of the quantity being measured.\n\nTo round to ''n'' significant figures:<ref>{{cite web\n|title = Rounding Decimal Numbers to a Designated Precision\n|author = Engelbrecht, Nancy|display-authors=etal\n|year = 1990\n|publisher = U.S. Department of Education\n|location = Washington, D.C.\n|url = https://archive.org/download/ERIC_ED327701/ERIC_ED327701.pdf\n|format = PDF}}</ref><ref name=\"Numerical Mathematics and Computing, by Cheney and Kincaid\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUfVZELlrMEC&pg=PA321&lpg=PA321&dq=Condition+Number+Rule+of+Thumb&source=bl&ots=kMuMoeATcB&sig=22t9ml1TcXKbve-nAkkTJ-qAf1g&hl=en&ei=A5abTIvGOsaMnQe_17TpDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Condition%20Number%20Rule%20of%20Thumb&f=false Numerical Mathematics and Computing, by Cheney and Kincaid].</ref>\n\n* Identify the significant figures before rounding.  These are the ''n'' consecutive digits beginning with the first non-zero digit.\n* If the digit immediately to the right of the last significant figure is greater than 5 or is a 5 followed by other non-zero digits, add 1 to the last significant figure. For example, 1.2459 as the result of a calculation or measurement that only allows for 3 significant figures should be written 1.25.\n* If the digit immediately to the right of the last significant figure is a 5 not followed by any other digits or followed only by zeros, rounding requires a [[Rounding#Tie-breaking|tie-breaking]] rule. For example, to round 1.25 to 2 significant figures:\n**[[Rounding#Round half away from zero|Round half away from zero]] (also known as \"5/4\"){{Citation needed|date=August 2018|reason=By who?}} rounds up to 1.3. This is the default rounding method implied in many disciplines{{Citation needed|date=August 2018|reason=How many, and which, disciplines?}} if not specified.\n** [[Rounding#Round half to even|Round half to even]], which rounds to the nearest even number, rounds down to 1.2 in this case. The same strategy applied to 1.35 would instead round up to 1.4. This is the method preferred by many scientific disciplines, because, for example, it avoids skewing the average value of a long list of values upwards.\n* Replace non-significant figures in front of the decimal point by zeros.\n* Drop all the digits after the decimal point to the right of the significant figures (do not replace them with zeros).\n\nIn financial calculations, a number is often rounded to a given number of places (for example, to two places after the [[decimal separator]] for many world currencies). This is done because greater precision is immaterial, and usually it is not possible to settle a debt of less than the smallest currency unit.\n\nIn UK personal tax returns income is rounded down to the nearest pound, whilst tax paid is calculated to the nearest penny.\n\nAs an illustration, the [[decimal]] quantity '''12.345''' can be expressed with various numbers of significant digits or decimal places.  If insufficient precision is available then the number is [[rounding|rounded]] in some manner to fit the available precision.

For example, log<sub>10</sub>(3.000\u00d710<sup>4</sup>) = log<sub>10</sub>(10<sup>4</sup>) + log<sub>10</sub>(3.000) \u2248 4 + 0.47712125472, should be rounded to 4.4771.\n\nWhen taking antilogarithms, the resulting number should have as many significant figures as the [[Common logarithm|mantissa]] in the logarithm.\n\nWhen performing a calculation, do not follow these guidelines for intermediate results; keep as many digits as is practical (at least 1 more than implied by the precision of the final result) until the end of calculation to avoid cumulative rounding errors.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ligo.caltech.edu/~vsanni/ph3/SignificantFiguresAndMeasurements/SignificantFiguresAndMeasurements.pdf |format= PDF |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130618184216/http://www.ligo.caltech.edu/~vsanni/ph3/SignificantFiguresAndMeasurements/SignificantFiguresAndMeasurements.pdf |archivedate= June 18, 2013 |title= Measurements and Significant Figures (Draft) |first= Virg\u00ednio |last= de Oliveira Sannibale |year= 2001 |work= Freshman Physics Laboratory |publisher= California Institute of Technology, Physics Mathematics And Astronomy Division }}</ref>\n\n==Estimating tenths==\nWhen using a ruler, initially use the smallest mark as the first estimated digit. For example, if a ruler's smallest mark is 0.1&nbsp;cm, and 4.5&nbsp;cm is read, it is 4.5 (\u00b10.1&nbsp;cm) or 4.4&nbsp;\u2013 4.6&nbsp;cm. However, in practice a measurement can usually be estimated by eye to closer than the interval between the ruler's smallest mark, e.g. in the above case it might be estimated as between 4.51&nbsp;cm and 4.53&nbsp;cm (see below).\n\nIt is also possible that the overall length of a ruler may not be accurate to the degree of the smallest mark, and the marks may be imperfectly spaced within each unit. However assuming a normal good quality ruler, it should be possible to estimate tenths between the nearest two marks to achieve an extra decimal place of accuracy.<ref name=\"Weston\">{{cite book|title=Experimental Electrical Testing|url=https://archive.org/details/experimentalele00njgoog|quote=Experimental Electrical Testing..|date=1914|publisher=Weston Electrical Instruments Co.|location=Newark, NJ|page=[https://archive.org/details/experimentalele00njgoog/page/n14 9]|accessdate=14 January 2019}}</ref> Failing to do this adds the error in reading the ruler to any error in the calibration of the ruler.<ref name=\"UMmeasurements\">{{cite web|title=Measurements|url=http://slc.umd.umich.edu/slconline/SIGF/page7.html|website=slc.umd.umich.edu|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=3 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Estimation==\n{{Main|Estimation}}\nWhen estimating the proportion of individuals carrying some particular characteristic in a population, from a random sample of that population, the number of significant figures should not exceed the maximum precision allowed by that sample size.\n\n==Relationship to accuracy and precision in measurement==\n{{main|Accuracy and precision}}\n\nTraditionally, in various technical fields, \"accuracy\" refers to the closeness of a given measurement to its true value; \"precision\" refers to the stability of that measurement when repeated many times.  Hoping to reflect the way the term \"accuracy\" is actually used in the scientific community, there is a more recent standard, ISO 5725, which keeps the same definition of precision but defines the term \"trueness\" as the closeness of a given measurement to its true value and uses the term \"accuracy\" as the combination of trueness and precision.  (See the [[Accuracy and precision]] article for a fuller discussion.)  In either case, the number of significant figures roughly corresponds to ''precision'', not to either use of the word accuracy or to the newer concept of trueness. <!--The smaller digits are not significant because they effectively random noise generated by the measurement process having little to do with the true value; they, they can be omitted for some reporting purposes. (This approach ignores techniques such as averaging to produce a higher-precision result.) *****NOTE: Aside from being broken grammatically, the previous blanket statement is unlikely to be true\u2014it depends on the precision of the instruments and the exact situation. -->\n\n==In computing==\n{{main|Floating point}}\nComputer representations of [[floating point numbers]] typically use a form of rounding to significant figures, but with [[binary number]]s. The number of correct significant figures is closely related to the notion of [[Approximation error|relative error]] (which has the advantage of being a more accurate measure of precision, and is independent of the radix, also known as the base, of the number system used).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Accuracy and precision]]\n*[[Benford's Law]] (First Digit Law)\n*[[Engineering notation]]\n*[[Error bar]]\n*[[False precision]]\n*[[IEEE754]] (IEEE floating point standard)\n*[[Interval arithmetic]]\n*[[Kahan summation algorithm]]\n*[[Precision (computer science)]]\n*[[Round-off error]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.khanacademy.org/video/significant-figures?playlist=Pre-algebra Significant Figures Video by Khan academy]\n* [https://www.calculators.tech/sig-fig-calculator Significant Figures Calculator by Calculators.tech]\n\n[[Category:Arithmetic]]\n[[Category:Numerical analysis]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figures"}
