The conflict killed about 250,000 people<ref>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13729504</ref> and eventually led to the involvement of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) and of the [[United Nations]]. The peace did not last long, and in 1999 the [[Second Liberian Civil War]] broke out.\n\n[[Samuel Doe]] had led a rebellion that overthrew the elected government in 1980, and in [[Liberian general election, 1985|1985 held elections]] that were widely considered fraudulent. There had been one unsuccessful coup by a former military leader. In December 1989, former government minister [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] moved into the country from neighboring [[Ivory Coast]] to start an uprising meant to topple the Doe government.\n\nTaylor's forces, the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL) battled with [[Prince Johnson]]'s rebel group, the [[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL) \u2013 a faction of NPFL \u2013 for control in Monrovia. In 1990, Johnson seized the capital of [[Monrovia]] and executed Doe brutally.\n\nPeace negotiations and foreign involvement led to a ceasefire in 1995 that was broken the next year before a final peace agreement and new national elections were held in 1997. Taylor was elected [[President of Liberia]] in July 1997.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger - Samuel K. Doe.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Samuel Doe]] with then-Secretary of Defense of the United States [[Caspar W. Weinberger]] outside of the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] in 1982.]]\n\n=== Samuel Doe takes power in coup (1980) ===\n[[Samuel Doe]] had taken power in a popular rebellion in 1980 against the Liberian Government, becoming the first Liberian President of non [[Americo-Liberian people|Americo-Liberian]] descent. Doe established a military regime called the [[People's Representative]] and enjoyed Liberian ethnic groups who were denied power since the founding of the country in 1847\n\nAny hope that Doe would improve the way Liberia was run was put aside as he quickly clamped down on opposition, fueled by his paranoia of a counter-coup attempt against him. As promised, Doe held [[Liberian general election, 1985|elections in 1985]] and won the presidency by just enough of a margin to avoid a runoff. However, international monitors condemned this election as fraudulent.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1985/1025/olib.html|title=Fraud charged in Liberia's first one-man, one-vote election|date=1985-10-25|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2017-10-17|issn=0882-7729}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Coup attempt by Thomas Johnson (November 1985) ===\n[[Thomas Johnson (general)|Thomas Johnson]], the former Commanding General of the Armed Forces of Liberia whom Doe had demoted and forced to flee the country, attempted to overthrow Doe's regime from neighbouring [[Sierra Leone]]. The coup attempt failed and Johnson was killed and allegedly eaten.<ref name=Dickovick>{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Africa 2012 |last=Dickovick |first=J.

''Daily Star'' 1985-11-18: 5.</ref>\n\n=== Mistreatment of the Gio and Mano ethnic groups (1985) ===\nThe Gio and Mano ethnic groups were persecuted against because they were charged with treason against the state. Thus, they were seen as inferiors to the President's own tribe, the Krahn. The mistreatment of the Gio and Mano increased the tensions in Liberia, which had already been rising due to Doe's preferential treatment of his own group.\n\n=== Charles Taylor builds insurgent forces (1985-1989) ===\n[[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]], who had left Doe's government after being accused of embezzlement, assembled a group of rebels in [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]] (mostly ethnic Gios and Manos who felt persecuted by Doe) who later became known as the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL). They invaded Nimba County on 24 December 1989. The Liberian Army retaliated against the whole population of the region, attacking unarmed civilians and burning villages. Many left as refugees for [[Guinea]] and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, but opposition to Doe was inflamed. [[Prince Johnson]], an NPFL fighter, split to form his own [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] force soon after crossing the border, based on the [[Gio Tribe|Gio tribe]] and named [[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL).\n\n==First Liberian Civil War (1989-1997)==\n\n=== Charles Taylor's force attacks (1989) ===\n[[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] organized and trained indigenous northerners in [[Ivory Coast]]. During Doe's regime Taylor had served in the Liberian Government's General Services Agency, acting  'as its ''de facto'' director'.<ref>Stephen Ellis, ''The Mask of Anarchy'', Hurst & Company, London, 2001, p.57, 67-68</ref> He fled to the United States in 1983 amid what Stephan Ellis describes as the 'increasingly menacing atmosphere in Monrovia' shortly before [[Thomas Quiwonkpa]], Doe's chief lieutenant, fled into exile himself. Doe requested Taylor's extradition for embezzling $900,000 of Liberian government funds. Taylor was thus arrested in the United States and after sixteen months broke out of a Massachusetts jail in circumstances that are still unclear.\n\n=== Krahn vs Gio and Mano ethnic groups ===\nThe NPFL initially encountered plenty of support within Nimba County, which had endured the majority of Samuel Doe's wrath after the 1985 attempted coup. Taylor and his force of 100 rebels reentered Liberia in 1989, on Christmas Eve, thousands of Gio and Mano joined them. Doe responded by sending two AFL battalions, including the 1st Infantry Battalion,<ref>HRW, Flight from Terror, May 1990</ref> to Nimba in December 1989-January 1990,<ref>Charles Hartung, 'Peacekeeping in Liberia: ECOMOG and the Struggle for Order,' Liberian Studies Journal, Volume XXX, No.2, 2005</ref> apparently under then-Colonel Hezekiah Bowen.<ref>Mark Huband, The Liberian Civil War, p.115, 118-119</ref>\n\nThe AFL acted in a very brutal and scorched-earth fashion, which quickly alienated the local people. The rebel invasion soon pitted [[Krahn people|ethnic Krahn]] sympathetic to the Doe regime against those victimized by it, the [[Gio Tribe|Gio]] and the Mano. Thousands of civilians were massacred on both sides. Hundreds of thousands fled their homes. The [[Monrovia Church massacre]] was carried out by approximately 30 ethnic Krahn government soldiers, killing 600 civilians in St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Monrovia, on 29 July 1990, the worst single atrocity of the First Liberian Civil War.<ref name=\"Bbcnews\" >{{cite news |date=12 February 2018|title=Liberian church massacre survivors seek US justice|trans-title=|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42996851|language= |work=[[BBC News]]|location= |access-date=14 December 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"Nytimes\" >{{cite news |date=31 July 1990|title=Liberia Troops Accused Of Massacre in Church|trans-title=|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/31/world/liberia-troops-accused-of-massacre-in-church.html|language= |work=[[The New York Times]]|location= |access-date=14 December 2018 }}</ref>\n\nBy May 1990 the AFL had been forced back to [[Gbarnga]], still under the control of Bowen's troops, but they lost the town to a NPFL assault on 28 May.<ref>Hubard, p.115</ref> By June 1990, Taylor's forces were laying siege to Monrovia.  In July 1990, [[Prince Yormie Johnson]] split from Taylor and formed the Independent National Patriotic Front (INPFL). The INPFL and NPFL continued their siege on Monrovia, which the AFL defended. Johnson quickly took control of parts of Monrovia prompting evacuation of foreign nationals and diplomats by the US Navy in August.\n\n=== ECOWAS intervention force (August 1990) ===\nIn August 1990, the 16-member [[ECOWAS|Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)]] agreed to deploy a joint military intervention force, the Economic Community Monitoring Group ([[ECOMOG]]), and place it under Nigerian leadership. The mission later included troops from non-ECOWAS countries, including Uganda and Tanzania. ECOMOG's objectives were to impose a cease-fire; help Liberians establish an interim government until elections could be held; stop the killing of innocent civilians; and ensure the safe evacuation of foreign nationals.\n\nECOMOG also sought to prevent the conflict from spreading into neighboring states, which share a complex history of state, economic, and ethno-linguistic social relations with Liberia. The [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) attempted to persuade Doe to resign and go into exile, but despite his weak position&nbsp;\u2013 besieged in his mansion&nbsp;\u2013 he refused. [[ECOMOG]], an ECOWAS intervention force, arrived at the Freeport of Monrovia on August 24, 1990, landing from Nigerian and Ghanaian vessels.<ref>Adebajo, 2002, p.75</ref>\n\n=== Capture and killing of Samuel Doe (September 1990) ===\n[[File:Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia in Monrovia 1990.png|thumb|300px|[[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia|INPFL]] militiamen in 1990 after taking control of much of [[Monrovia]].]]\n\nOn 9 September 1990, Doe visited the barely established, newly arrived ECOMOG headquarters in the Free Port of Maher. Stephen Ellis says,<ref>''The Mask of Anarchy'', by Stephen Ellis, 2001, p.1-9</ref> his motive was to lay a complaint that the ECOMOG commander had not paid a courtesy call to Doe, the Head of State, however, the exact circumstances that led to Doe's visit to the Free Port are still unclear. Doe had been under pressure to accept exile outside of Liberia. However, after Doe arrived, a large rebel force led by Prince Johnson's INPFL arrived at the headquarters and then attacked Doe's party. Doe was captured and taken to the INPFL's Caldwell base. He was brutally tortured before being killed and dismembered. His torture and execution was videotaped by his captors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/liberia/chronology.php#1990 |title=Liberia: Chronology |accessdate=2007-02-26 |last=Armon |first=Jeremy |author2=Andy Carl |year=1996 |work=Conciliation Resources |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308142809/http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/liberia/chronology.php#1990 |archive-date=8 March 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=MASK>{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Stephen|title=The Mask of Anarchy: The Destruction of Liberia and the Religious Dimension of African Civil War|origyear=1999|year=2007|publisher=Hurst & Company|location=London, UK|isbn=1850654174|pages=1\u201316}}</ref>\n\nJohnson's INPFL and Taylor's NPFL continued to struggle for control of Monrovia in the months that followed.  With military discipline absent and bloodshed throughout the capital region, members of ECOWAS created the Economic Community Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to restore order. The force comprised some 4,000 troops from [[Nigeria]], [[Ghana]], [[Sierra Leone]], the [[Gambia]] and [[Guinea]]. ECOMOG succeeded in bringing Taylor and Johnson to agree to its intervention, but Taylor's forces engaged it in the port area of Monrovia.\n\n=== Peace making attempts (1990) ===\nA series of peacemaking conferences in regional capitals followed. There were meetings in Bamako in November 1990, Lome in January 1991, and Yamoussoukro in June\u2013October 1991. But the first seven peace conferences, including the Yamoussoukro I-IV processes failed. In November 1990, ECOWAS invited the principal Liberian players to meet in [[Banjul]], Gambia to form a government of national unity. The negotiated settlement established the Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU), led by [[Amos Sawyer|Dr. Amos Sawyer]], leader of the LPP. Bishop Ronald Diggs of the Liberian Council of Churches became vice president. However, Taylor's NPFL refused to attend the conference. Within days, hostilities resumed.  ECOMOG was reinforced in order to protect the interim government. Sawyer was able to establish his authority over most of Monrovia, but the rest of Liberia was in the hands of various factions of the NPFL or of local gangs.\n\n===ULIMO===\nThe [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy]] (ULIMO) was formed in June 1991 by supporters of the late [[President of Liberia|President]] [[Samuel K. Doe]] and former [[Armed Forces of Liberia]] (AFL) fighters who had taken refuge in [[Guinea]] and [[Sierra Leone]]. It was led by Alahaji G.V. Kromah, a minister in the Doe government.\n\nAfter fighting alongside the Sierra Leonean army against the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF), ULIMO forces entered western Liberia in September 1991. The group scored significant gains in areas held by another rebel group&nbsp;\u2013 the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL), notably around the diamond mining areas of [[Lofa County|Lofa]] and [[Bomi County|Bomi]] [[Counties of Liberia|counties]].\n\nFrom its outset, ULIMO was beset with internal divisions and the group effectively broke into two separate militias in 1994: [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Johnson faction|ULIMO-J]], an ethnic [[Krahn]] faction led by General [[Roosevelt Johnson]] and [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Kromah faction|ULIMO-K]], a [[Mandinka people|Mandingo]]-based faction led by [[Alhaji G.V. Kromah]].\n\nThe group was alleged to have committed serious violations of [[human rights]], both before and after its breakup.\n\n=== Attack on Monrovia (1992) ===\nPeace was still far off as both Taylor and Johnson claimed power.  ECOMOG declared an Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU) with [[Amos Sawyer]] as their president, with the broad support of Johnson.  Taylor launched an assault on Monrovia on October 15, 1992, named 'Operation Octopus.'<ref>See Ellis, Mask of Anarchy, 98-99.</ref> which  may have been led by Burkina Faso soldiers.<ref>Herbert Howe, Ambiguous Order, 2005, 143.</ref> The resulting siege lasted two months.\n\nBy late December, ECOMOG had pushed the NPFL back beyond Monrovia's suburbs.\n\n===UNOMIL===\n{{main article|UNOMIL}}\nIn 1993, ECOWAS brokered a peace agreement in [[Cotonou]], Benin. Following this, on September 22, 1993, the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council established the UN Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL), to support ECOMOG in implementing this peace agreement. UNOMIL was deployed in early 1994 with 368 military observers and associated civilian personnel to monitor implementation of the Cotonou Peace Agreement, prior to elections originally planned for February/March 1994.\n\nRenewed armed hostilities broke out in May 1994 and continued, becoming especially intense in July and August. ECOMOG, and later UNOMIL, members were captured and held hostage by some factions. By mid-1994, the humanitarian situation had become disastrous, with 1.8 million Liberians in need of humanitarian assistance. Conditions continued to deteriorate, but humanitarian agencies were unable to reach many in need due to hostilities and general insecurity.\n\nFactional leaders agreed in September 1994 to the Akosombo Agreement, a supplement to the Cotonou agreement, named after the Ghanaian town where it was signed. The security situation in Liberia remained poor. In October 1994, in the face of ECOMOG funding shortfalls and a lack of will by the Liberian combatants to honor agreements to end the war, the UN Security Council reduced to about 90 the number of UNOMIL observers. It extended UNOMIL's mandate and subsequently extended it several times until September 1997.\n\nIn December 1994, the factions and other parties signed the Accra Agreement, a supplement to the Akosombo Agreement. Disagreements ensued and fighting continued.\n\n===Ceasefire (1995)===\nIn August 1995, the main factions signed an agreement largely brokered by Ghanaian President [[Jerry Rawlings]]. At a conference sponsored by ECOWAS, the United Nations and the United States, the European Union, and the [[Organization of African Unity]], Charles Taylor agreed to a cease-fire.\n\nAt the beginning of September 1995, Liberia's three principal warlords&nbsp;\u2013 Taylor, [[George Boley]] and [[Alhaji Kromah]]&nbsp;\u2013 made theatrical entrances into Monrovia. A ruling council of six members under civilian [[Wilton G. S. Sankawulo]] and with the three factional heads Taylor, Kromah and Boley, took control of the country preparatory to elections that were originally scheduled for 1996.\n\n=== Fighting in Monrovia (1996) ===\n[[File:National Patriotic Liberation Front fighters in Monrovia 1996.png|thumb|300px|[[National Patriotic Front of Liberia|NPFL]] fighters search for [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy|ULIMO]] militants in [[Monrovia]].]]\n\nHeavy fighting broke out again in April 1996. This led to the evacuation of most international [[non-governmental organization]]s and the destruction of much of Monrovia.\n\nIn August 1996, these battles were ended by the [[Abuja]] Accord in Nigeria, agreeing to [[disarmament]] and [[demobilization]] by 1997 and [[Liberia elections, 1997|elections]] in July of that year. 3 September 1996, Sankawulo is followed by [[Ruth Perry]] as chairwoman of the ruling council, who served until 2 August 1997.\n\n=== 1997 Elections ===\n{{Main|1997 Liberian general election}}\nSimultaneous elections for the [[Liberia elections, 1997#Presidential election results|presidency]] and [[Liberia elections, 1997#Legislative election results|national assembly]] were finally held in July 1997.\nIn a climate hardly conducive to free movement and security of persons, Taylor and his [[National Patriotic Party]] won an overwhelming victory against 12 other candidates.  Assisted by widespread intimidation, Taylor took 75 per cent of the presidential poll (no other candidate won more than 10 per cent) while the NPP won a similar proportion of seats in both parliamentary chambers. 2 August 1997, Ruth Perry handed power to elected president Charles Taylor.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{See also|1998 Monrovia clashes}}\n\nIn 1997, the Liberian people elected Charles Taylor as the President after he entered the capital city, [[Monrovia]], by force. Liberians had voted for Taylor in the hope that he would end the bloodshed.  The bloodshed did slow considerably, but it did not end. Violent events flared up regularly after the putative end of the war. Taylor, furthermore, was accused of backing guerrillas in neighboring countries and funneling diamond money into arms purchases for the rebel armies he supported, and into luxuries for himself. The implicit unrest manifested during the late 1990s is emblematic in the sharp national economic decline and the prevalent sale of diamonds and timber in exchange for small arms.\n\nAfter Taylor's victory, Liberia was peaceful enough so that refugees began to return. But other leaders were forced to leave the country, and some ULIMO forces reformed as the [[Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy]] (LURD). LURD began fighting in [[Lofa County]] with the aim of destabilizing the government and gaining control of the local [[diamond]] fields, leading to the [[Second Liberian Civil War]].\n\n===Impact===\nThe Liberian civil war was one of Africa's bloodiest. From 1989-1996, it claimed the lives of more than 200,000 Liberians and further displaced a million others into refugee camps in neighboring countries. [[Child soldier]]s were used throughout the war.\n\nThe civil war claimed the lives of one out of every 17 people in the country, uprooted most of the rest, and destroyed a once-viable economic infrastructure.  The strife also spread to Liberia's neighbors. It helped slow democratization in West Africa at the beginning of the 1990s and destabilized a region that already was one of the world's most unsteady.\n\n==Second Liberian Civil War==\nThe [[Second Liberian Civil War]] began in 1999 and ended in October 2003, when [[ECOWAS]] intervened to stop the [[Siege of Monrovia|rebel siege]] on Monrovia and exiled Charles Taylor to Nigeria until he was arrested in 2006 and taken to [[The Hague]] for his trial. By the conclusion of the final war, more than 250,000 people had been killed and nearly 1 million displaced. Half that number remain to be repatriated in 2005, at the election of Liberia's first democratic President since the initial 1980 ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' of Samuel Doe.\n\nFormer president [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]], who initially was a strong supporter of Charles Taylor, was inaugurated in January 2006 and the National Transitional Government of Liberia terminated its power.\n\nCharles Taylor was sentenced to a trial in 2003, after being accused of rape and acts of sexual violence, promoting child soldiers, and an illegal ownership of weapons. He denied these accusations but was eventually testified against by his victims. He was then sentenced to 50 years in prison.\n\n== Lists ==\n\n===Armed groups that participated in the war===\n*[[Armed Forces of Liberia]] (AFL)\n*[[Liberia Peace Council]] (LPC)\n*[[Lofa Defense Force]] (LDF)\n*[[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL)\n**[[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL)\n**[[National Patriotic Front of Liberia-Central Revolutionary Council]] (NPFL-CRC)\n*[[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy]] (ULIMO)\n**[[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Johnson faction]] (ULIMO-J)\n**[[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Kromah faction]] (ULIMO-K)\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2017}}\n=== Peace agreements ===\nPeace agreements signed included the:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=94&value=#|title=Uppsala Conflict Data Program}}</ref> \n*Banjul III Agreement (1990-10-24)\n*Bamako Ceasefire Agreement (1990-11-28)\n*Banjul IV Agreement (1990-12-21)\n*Lom\u00e9 Agreement (1991-02-13)\n*Yamoussoukro IV Peace Agreement (1991-10-30)\n*Geneva Agreement 1992 (1992-04-07)\n*Cotonou Peace Agreement (1993-07-25)\n*Akosombo Peace Agreement (1994-09-12)\n*Accra Agreements/Akosombo clarification agreement (1994-12-21)\n*Abuja Peace Agreement (1995-08-19)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Second Liberian Civil War]]\n\n'''General:'''\n*[[History of Liberia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Gerdes, Felix: Civil War and State Formation: The Political Economy of War and Peace in Liberia, Frankfurt/New York: Campus Verlag & University of Chicago Press, 2013\n*Hoffman, Danny. \"The City as Barracks: Freetown, Monrovia, and the Organization of Violence in Postcolonial African Cities.\" Cultural Anthropology.

The conflict killed about 250,000 people<ref>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13729504</ref> and eventually led to the involvement of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) and of the [[United Nations]]. The peace did not last long, and in 1999 the [[Second Liberian Civil War]] broke out.\n\n[[Samuel Doe]] had led a rebellion that overthrew the elected government in 1980, and in [[Liberian general election, 1985|1985 held elections]] that were widely considered fraudulent. There had been one unsuccessful coup by a former military leader. In December 1989, former government minister [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] moved into the country from neighboring [[Ivory Coast]] to start an uprising meant to topple the Doe government.\n\nTaylor's forces, the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL) battled with [[Prince Johnson]]'s rebel group, the [[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL) \u2013 a faction of NPFL \u2013 for control in Monrovia. In 1990, Johnson seized the capital of [[Monrovia]] and executed Doe brutally.\n\nPeace negotiations and foreign involvement led to a ceasefire in 1995 that was broken the next year before a final peace agreement and new national elections were held in 1997. Taylor was elected [[President of Liberia]] in July 1997.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger - Samuel K. Doe.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Samuel Doe]] with then-Secretary of Defense of the United States [[Caspar W. Weinberger]] outside of the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] in 1982.]]\n\n=== Samuel Doe takes power in coup (1980) ===\n[[Samuel Doe]] had taken power in a popular rebellion in 1980 against the Liberian Government, becoming the first Liberian President of non [[Americo-Liberian people|Americo-Liberian]] descent. Doe established a military regime called the [[People's Representative]] and enjoyed Liberian ethnic groups who were denied power since the founding of the country in 1847\n\nAny hope that Doe would improve the way Liberia was run was put aside as he quickly clamped down on opposition, fueled by his paranoia of a counter-coup attempt against him. As promised, Doe held [[Liberian general election, 1985|elections in 1985]] and won the presidency by just enough of a margin to avoid a runoff. However, international monitors condemned this election as fraudulent.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1985/1025/olib.html|title=Fraud charged in Liberia's first one-man, one-vote election|date=1985-10-25|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2017-10-17|issn=0882-7729}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Coup attempt by Thomas Johnson (November 1985) ===\n[[Thomas Johnson (general)|Thomas Johnson]], the former Commanding General of the Armed Forces of Liberia whom Doe had demoted and forced to flee the country, attempted to overthrow Doe's regime from neighbouring [[Sierra Leone]]. The coup attempt failed and Johnson was killed and allegedly eaten.<ref name=Dickovick>{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Africa 2012 |last=Dickovick |first=J.

''Daily Star'' 1985-11-18: 5.</ref>\n\n=== Mistreatment of the Gio and Mano ethnic groups (1985) ===\nThe Gio and Mano ethnic groups were persecuted against because they were charged with treason against the state. Thus, they were seen as inferiors to the President's own tribe, the Krahn. The mistreatment of the Gio and Mano increased the tensions in Liberia, which had already been rising due to Doe's preferential treatment of his own group.\n\n=== Charles Taylor builds insurgent forces (1985-1989) ===\n[[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]], who had left Doe's government after being accused of embezzlement, assembled a group of rebels in [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]] (mostly ethnic Gios and Manos who felt persecuted by Doe) who later became known as the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL). They invaded Nimba County on 24 December 1989. The Liberian Army retaliated against the whole population of the region, attacking unarmed civilians and burning villages. Many left as refugees for [[Guinea]] and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, but opposition to Doe was inflamed. [[Prince Johnson]], an NPFL fighter, split to form his own [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] force soon after crossing the border, based on the [[Gio Tribe|Gio tribe]] and named [[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL).\n\n==First Liberian Civil War (1989-1997)==\n\n=== Charles Taylor's force attacks (1989) ===\n[[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] organized and trained indigenous northerners in [[Ivory Coast]]. During Doe's regime Taylor had served in the Liberian Government's General Services Agency, acting  'as its ''de facto'' director'.<ref>Stephen Ellis, ''The Mask of Anarchy'', Hurst & Company, London, 2001, p.57, 67-68</ref> He fled to the United States in 1983 amid what Stephan Ellis describes as the 'increasingly menacing atmosphere in Monrovia' shortly before [[Thomas Quiwonkpa]], Doe's chief lieutenant, fled into exile himself. Doe requested Taylor's extradition for embezzling $900,000 of Liberian government funds. Taylor was thus arrested in the United States and after sixteen months broke out of a Massachusetts jail in circumstances that are still unclear.\n\n=== Krahn vs Gio and Mano ethnic groups ===\nThe NPFL initially encountered plenty of support within Nimba County, which had endured the majority of Samuel Doe's wrath after the 1985 attempted coup. Taylor and his force of 100 rebels reentered Liberia in 1989, on Christmas Eve, thousands of Gio and Mano joined them. Doe responded by sending two AFL battalions, including the 1st Infantry Battalion,<ref>HRW, Flight from Terror, May 1990</ref> to Nimba in December 1989-January 1990,<ref>Charles Hartung, 'Peacekeeping in Liberia: ECOMOG and the Struggle for Order,' Liberian Studies Journal, Volume XXX, No.2, 2005</ref> apparently under then-Colonel Hezekiah Bowen.<ref>Mark Huband, The Liberian Civil War, p.115, 118-119</ref>\n\nThe AFL acted in a very brutal and scorched-earth fashion, which quickly alienated the local people. The rebel invasion soon pitted [[Krahn people|ethnic Krahn]] sympathetic to the Doe regime against those victimized by it, the [[Gio Tribe|Gio]] and the Mano. Thousands of civilians were massacred on both sides. Hundreds of thousands fled their homes. The [[Monrovia Church massacre]] was carried out by approximately 30 ethnic Krahn government soldiers, killing 600 civilians in St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Monrovia, on 29 July 1990, the worst single atrocity of the First Liberian Civil War.<ref name=\"Bbcnews\" >{{cite news |date=12 February 2018|title=Liberian church massacre survivors seek US justice|trans-title=|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42996851|language= |work=[[BBC News]]|location= |access-date=14 December 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"Nytimes\" >{{cite news |date=31 July 1990|title=Liberia Troops Accused Of Massacre in Church|trans-title=|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/31/world/liberia-troops-accused-of-massacre-in-church.html|language= |work=[[The New York Times]]|location= |access-date=14 December 2018 }}</ref>\n\nBy May 1990 the AFL had been forced back to [[Gbarnga]], still under the control of Bowen's troops, but they lost the town to a NPFL assault on 28 May.<ref>Hubard, p.115</ref> By June 1990, Taylor's forces were laying siege to Monrovia.  In July 1990, [[Prince Yormie Johnson]] split from Taylor and formed the Independent National Patriotic Front (INPFL). The INPFL and NPFL continued their siege on Monrovia, which the AFL defended. Johnson quickly took control of parts of Monrovia prompting evacuation of foreign nationals and diplomats by the US Navy in August.\n\n=== ECOWAS intervention force (August 1990) ===\nIn August 1990, the 16-member [[ECOWAS|Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)]] agreed to deploy a joint military intervention force, the Economic Community Monitoring Group ([[ECOMOG]]), and place it under Nigerian leadership. The mission later included troops from non-ECOWAS countries, including Uganda and Tanzania. ECOMOG's objectives were to impose a cease-fire; help Liberians establish an interim government until elections could be held; stop the killing of innocent civilians; and ensure the safe evacuation of foreign nationals.\n\nECOMOG also sought to prevent the conflict from spreading into neighboring states, which share a complex history of state, economic, and ethno-linguistic social relations with Liberia. The [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) attempted to persuade Doe to resign and go into exile, but despite his weak position&nbsp;\u2013 besieged in his mansion&nbsp;\u2013 he refused. [[ECOMOG]], an ECOWAS intervention force, arrived at the Freeport of Monrovia on August 24, 1990, landing from Nigerian and Ghanaian vessels.<ref>Adebajo, 2002, p.75</ref>\n\n=== Capture and killing of Samuel Doe (September 1990) ===\n[[File:Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia in Monrovia 1990.png|thumb|300px|[[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia|INPFL]] militiamen in 1990 after taking control of much of [[Monrovia]].]]\n\nOn 9 September 1990, Doe visited the barely established, newly arrived ECOMOG headquarters in the Free Port of Maher. Stephen Ellis says,<ref>''The Mask of Anarchy'', by Stephen Ellis, 2001, p.1-9</ref> his motive was to lay a complaint that the ECOMOG commander had not paid a courtesy call to Doe, the Head of State, however, the exact circumstances that led to Doe's visit to the Free Port are still unclear. Doe had been under pressure to accept exile outside of Liberia. However, after Doe arrived, a large rebel force led by Prince Johnson's INPFL arrived at the headquarters and then attacked Doe's party. Doe was captured and taken to the INPFL's Caldwell base. He was brutally tortured before being killed and dismembered. His torture and execution was videotaped by his captors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/liberia/chronology.php#1990 |title=Liberia: Chronology |accessdate=2007-02-26 |last=Armon |first=Jeremy |author2=Andy Carl |year=1996 |work=Conciliation Resources |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308142809/http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/liberia/chronology.php#1990 |archive-date=8 March 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=MASK>{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Stephen|title=The Mask of Anarchy: The Destruction of Liberia and the Religious Dimension of African Civil War|origyear=1999|year=2007|publisher=Hurst & Company|location=London, UK|isbn=1850654174|pages=1\u201316}}</ref>\n\nJohnson's INPFL and Taylor's NPFL continued to struggle for control of Monrovia in the months that followed.  With military discipline absent and bloodshed throughout the capital region, members of ECOWAS created the Economic Community Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to restore order. The force comprised some 4,000 troops from [[Nigeria]], [[Ghana]], [[Sierra Leone]], the [[Gambia]] and [[Guinea]]. ECOMOG succeeded in bringing Taylor and Johnson to agree to its intervention, but Taylor's forces engaged it in the port area of Monrovia.\n\n=== Peace making attempts (1990) ===\nA series of peacemaking conferences in regional capitals followed. There were meetings in Bamako in November 1990, Lome in January 1991, and Yamoussoukro in June\u2013October 1991. But the first seven peace conferences, including the Yamoussoukro I-IV processes failed. In November 1990, ECOWAS invited the principal Liberian players to meet in [[Banjul]], Gambia to form a government of national unity. The negotiated settlement established the Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU), led by [[Amos Sawyer|Dr. Amos Sawyer]], leader of the LPP. Bishop Ronald Diggs of the Liberian Council of Churches became vice president. However, Taylor's NPFL refused to attend the conference. Within days, hostilities resumed.  ECOMOG was reinforced in order to protect the interim government. Sawyer was able to establish his authority over most of Monrovia, but the rest of Liberia was in the hands of various factions of the NPFL or of local gangs.\n\n===ULIMO===\nThe [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy]] (ULIMO) was formed in June 1991 by supporters of the late [[President of Liberia|President]] [[Samuel K. Doe]] and former [[Armed Forces of Liberia]] (AFL) fighters who had taken refuge in [[Guinea]] and [[Sierra Leone]]. It was led by Raleigh Seekie, a deputy [[Minister of Finance]] in the Doe government.\n\nAfter fighting alongside the Sierra Leonean army against the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF), ULIMO forces entered western Liberia in September 1991. The group scored significant gains in areas held by another rebel group&nbsp;\u2013 the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL), notably around the diamond mining areas of [[Lofa County|Lofa]] and [[Bomi County|Bomi]] [[Counties of Liberia|counties]].\n\nFrom its outset, ULIMO was beset with internal divisions and the group effectively broke into two separate militias in 1994: [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Johnson faction|ULIMO-J]], an ethnic [[Krahn]] faction led by General [[Roosevelt Johnson]] and [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Kromah faction|ULIMO-K]], a [[Mandinka people|Mandingo]]-based faction led by [[Alhaji G.V. Kromah]].\n\nThe group was alleged to have committed serious violations of [[human rights]], both before and after its breakup.\n\n=== Attack on Monrovia (1992) ===\nPeace was still far off as both Taylor and Johnson claimed power.  ECOMOG declared an Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU) with [[Amos Sawyer]] as their president, with the broad support of Johnson.  Taylor launched an assault on Monrovia on October 15, 1992, named 'Operation Octopus.'<ref>See Ellis, Mask of Anarchy, 98-99.</ref> which  may have been led by Burkina Faso soldiers.<ref>Herbert Howe, Ambiguous Order, 2005, 143.</ref> The resulting siege lasted two months.\n\nBy late December, ECOMOG had pushed the NPFL back beyond Monrovia's suburbs.\n\n===UNOMIL===\n{{main article|UNOMIL}}\nIn 1993, ECOWAS brokered a peace agreement in [[Cotonou]], Benin. Following this, on September 22, 1993, the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council established the UN Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL), to support ECOMOG in implementing this peace agreement. UNOMIL was deployed in early 1994 with 368 military observers and associated civilian personnel to monitor implementation of the Cotonou Peace Agreement, prior to elections originally planned for February/March 1994.\n\nRenewed armed hostilities broke out in May 1994 and continued, becoming especially intense in July and August. ECOMOG, and later UNOMIL, members were captured and held hostage by some factions. By mid-1994, the humanitarian situation had become disastrous, with 1.8 million Liberians in need of humanitarian assistance. Conditions continued to deteriorate, but humanitarian agencies were unable to reach many in need due to hostilities and general insecurity.\n\nFactional leaders agreed in September 1994 to the Akosombo Agreement, a supplement to the Cotonou agreement, named after the Ghanaian town where it was signed. The security situation in Liberia remained poor. In October 1994, in the face of ECOMOG funding shortfalls and a lack of will by the Liberian combatants to honor agreements to end the war, the UN Security Council reduced to about 90 the number of UNOMIL observers. It extended UNOMIL's mandate and subsequently extended it several times until September 1997.\n\nIn December 1994, the factions and other parties signed the Accra Agreement, a supplement to the Akosombo Agreement. Disagreements ensued and fighting continued.\n\n===Ceasefire (1995)===\nIn August 1995, the main factions signed an agreement largely brokered by Ghanaian President [[Jerry Rawlings]]. At a conference sponsored by ECOWAS, the United Nations and the United States, the European Union, and the [[Organization of African Unity]], Charles Taylor agreed to a cease-fire.\n\nAt the beginning of September 1995, Liberia's three principal warlords&nbsp;\u2013 Taylor, [[George Boley]] and [[Alhaji Kromah]]&nbsp;\u2013 made theatrical entrances into Monrovia. A ruling council of six members under civilian [[Wilton G. S. Sankawulo]] and with the three factional heads Taylor, Kromah and Boley, took control of the country preparatory to elections that were originally scheduled for 1996.\n\n=== Fighting in Monrovia (1996) ===\n[[File:National Patriotic Liberation Front fighters in Monrovia 1996.png|thumb|300px|[[National Patriotic Front of Liberia|NPFL]] fighters search for [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy|ULIMO]] militants in [[Monrovia]].]]\n\nHeavy fighting broke out again in April 1996. This led to the evacuation of most international [[non-governmental organization]]s and the destruction of much of Monrovia.\n\nIn August 1996, these battles were ended by the [[Abuja]] Accord in Nigeria, agreeing to [[disarmament]] and [[demobilization]] by 1997 and [[Liberia elections, 1997|elections]] in July of that year. 3 September 1996, Sankawulo is followed by [[Ruth Perry]] as chairwoman of the ruling council, who served until 2 August 1997.\n\n=== 1997 Elections ===\n{{Main|1997 Liberian general election}}\nSimultaneous elections for the [[Liberia elections, 1997#Presidential election results|presidency]] and [[Liberia elections, 1997#Legislative election results|national assembly]] were finally held in July 1997.\nIn a climate hardly conducive to free movement and security of persons, Taylor and his [[National Patriotic Party]] won an overwhelming victory against 12 other candidates.  Assisted by widespread intimidation, Taylor took 75 per cent of the presidential poll (no other candidate won more than 10 per cent) while the NPP won a similar proportion of seats in both parliamentary chambers. 2 August 1997, Ruth Perry handed power to elected president Charles Taylor.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{See also|1998 Monrovia clashes}}\n\nIn 1997, the Liberian people elected Charles Taylor as the President after he entered the capital city, [[Monrovia]], by force. Liberians had voted for Taylor in the hope that he would end the bloodshed.  The bloodshed did slow considerably, but it did not end. Violent events flared up regularly after the putative end of the war. Taylor, furthermore, was accused of backing guerrillas in neighboring countries and funneling diamond money into arms purchases for the rebel armies he supported, and into luxuries for himself. The implicit unrest manifested during the late 1990s is emblematic in the sharp national economic decline and the prevalent sale of diamonds and timber in exchange for small arms.\n\nAfter Taylor's victory, Liberia was peaceful enough so that refugees began to return. But other leaders were forced to leave the country, and some ULIMO forces reformed as the [[Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy]] (LURD). LURD began fighting in [[Lofa County]] with the aim of destabilizing the government and gaining control of the local [[diamond]] fields, leading to the [[Second Liberian Civil War]].\n\n===Impact===\nThe Liberian civil war was one of Africa's bloodiest. From 1989-1996, it claimed the lives of more than 200,000 Liberians and further displaced a million others into refugee camps in neighboring countries. [[Child soldier]]s were used throughout the war.\n\nThe civil war claimed the lives of one out of every 17 people in the country, uprooted most of the rest, and destroyed a once-viable economic infrastructure.  The strife also spread to Liberia's neighbors. It helped slow democratization in West Africa at the beginning of the 1990s and destabilized a region that already was one of the world's most unsteady.\n\n==Second Liberian Civil War==\nThe [[Second Liberian Civil War]] began in 1999 and ended in October 2003, when [[ECOWAS]] intervened to stop the [[Siege of Monrovia|rebel siege]] on Monrovia and exiled Charles Taylor to Nigeria until he was arrested in 2006 and taken to [[The Hague]] for his trial. By the conclusion of the final war, more than 250,000 people had been killed and nearly 1 million displaced. Half that number remain to be repatriated in 2005, at the election of Liberia's first democratic President since the initial 1980 ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' of Samuel Doe.\n\nFormer president [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]], who initially was a strong supporter of Charles Taylor, was inaugurated in January 2006 and the National Transitional Government of Liberia terminated its power.\n\nCharles Taylor was sentenced to a trial in 2003, after being accused of rape and acts of sexual violence, promoting child soldiers, and an illegal ownership of weapons. He denied these accusations but was eventually testified against by his victims. He was then sentenced to 50 years in prison.\n\n== Lists ==\n\n===Armed groups that participated in the war===\n*[[Armed Forces of Liberia]] (AFL)\n*[[Liberia Peace Council]] (LPC)\n*[[Lofa Defense Force]] (LDF)\n*[[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL)\n**[[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL)\n**[[National Patriotic Front of Liberia-Central Revolutionary Council]] (NPFL-CRC)\n*[[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy]] (ULIMO)\n**[[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Johnson faction]] (ULIMO-J)\n**[[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Kromah faction]] (ULIMO-K)\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2017}}\n=== Peace agreements ===\nPeace agreements signed included the:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=94&value=#|title=Uppsala Conflict Data Program}}</ref> \n*Banjul III Agreement (1990-10-24)\n*Bamako Ceasefire Agreement (1990-11-28)\n*Banjul IV Agreement (1990-12-21)\n*Lom\u00e9 Agreement (1991-02-13)\n*Yamoussoukro IV Peace Agreement (1991-10-30)\n*Geneva Agreement 1992 (1992-04-07)\n*Cotonou Peace Agreement (1993-07-25)\n*Akosombo Peace Agreement (1994-09-12)\n*Accra Agreements/Akosombo clarification agreement (1994-12-21)\n*Abuja Peace Agreement (1995-08-19)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Second Liberian Civil War]]\n\n'''General:'''\n*[[History of Liberia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Gerdes, Felix: Civil War and State Formation: The Political Economy of War and Peace in Liberia, Frankfurt/New York: Campus Verlag & University of Chicago Press, 2013\n*Hoffman, Danny. \"The City as Barracks: Freetown, Monrovia, and the Organization of Violence in Postcolonial African Cities.\" Cultural Anthropology.

In addition, since 1994, TMG has developed a tuning business for Toyota road cars, offering complete vehicle service, tuning and sports accessories. In 1999 the company stopped participating in rallying, in order to prepare for a switch to [[Formula One]] in {{f1|2002}}. From 2002 to 2009, TMG participated in Formula 1 under the team name [[Panasonic Toyota Racing]], starting 139 Grands Prix.

TMG has moved back into sports car racing as an exclusive engine supplier from 2011 onwards to [[Lola Cars]], powering [[Rebellion Racing]]. In 2012 TMG fully returned to sports car competition with the [[Toyota TS030 Hybrid]].\n\nIn addition to its motorsport activities, Toyota Motorsport also undertakes production vehicle analysis and development on behalf of Toyota, providing \"highly skilled and rapidly reacting engineering\" services.

Andersson came ninth, beating other Japanese top teams who mostly worked with the [[Datsun 240Z]].\n\nThe Toyota Celica had to travel from Japan to the European events all the time, which was not good for the car, so Andersson set up a workshop of his own, [[Andersson Motorsport]], which became Toyota's first European team. It was founded in 1973 with its workshop in Uppsala, Sweden. Shortly thereafter it moved to Brussels, Belgium. It ran [[Toyota Corolla|Corollas]] and Celicas from this location, with some help from Japan for major events.\n\nToyota Team Europe began in February 1975. In August of that year, [[Hannu Mikkola]] won TTE's first rally, the [[1000 Lakes Rally]] in a Corolla 1600, where the competition used 2.0&nbsp;L engines.\n\nIn 1979 TTE moved 11 of the 20 employees from Brussels to Cologne, where the Toyota Allee was created. This was also the first time it used a Celica Turbo, and TTE won the next two Safaris.\n\nIn September 1987, TTE moved to a larger premises, in which they still reside. It was also the time they revealed their first [[four wheel drive]] car, the [[Toyota Celica GT-Four]], driven by [[Juha Kankkunen]] and [[Kenneth Eriksson]]. [[Carlos Sainz]] won the [[1990 World Rally Championship season|1990]] [[FIA]] [[World Rally Championship]] [[List of World Rally Championship Drivers' Champions|Title for Drivers]] with '''ST165'''. The newer GT-Four, '''ST185''', made its debut at the [[1992 World Rally Championship season|1992]] Rallye Monte Carlo, culminating in Sainz again winning the title in this year. The ST185 also won the WRC Driver's and [[List of World Rally Championship Constructors' Champions|Manufacturer's]] Titles in [[1993 World Rally Championship season|1993]] with [[Juha Kankkunen]], and in [[1994 World Rally Championship season|1994]] with [[Didier Auriol]].\n\nIn 1993 [[Toyota Motor Corporation]] bought TTE which then renamed Toyota Motorsport GmbH (TMG).

When they returned to the WRC for [[1998 World Rally Championship season|1998]], they did so with a Corolla WRC driven by the crews of Carlos Sainz/[[Luis Moya]] and Didier Auriol/[[Denis Giraudet]]. They finished the season in second overall in both the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships.\n\nIn [[1999 World Rally Championship season|1999]], however, the manufacturers championship was taken, the third in TTE's existence.\n\n== Sports car racing history ==\n[[File:Toyota GTone.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Toyota GT-One]]]]\nIn addition to spearheading Toyota's efforts in the World Rally Championship, the group has also developed and run the [[Toyota GT-One]] and [[Toyota TS030 Hybrid]] in [[sports car racing]].

Three GT-Ones appeared, setting the 2nd, 5th, and 10th best times, easily beating out custom built prototypes which were meant to be the superior class. For the race week itself, all three cars performed admirably in qualifying by continuing their quick pace, qualifying 2nd, 7th, and 8th, being beaten only by their GT class competitor, Mercedes-Benz. For the race itself, the No. 28 GT-One suffered from a high speed accident halfway through the race, taking it out of competition. The two other entrants continued to fight on, both remaining in the top 10. However, within the closing hours, the higher ranked No. 29 GT-One suffered a gearbox failure while in competition for the race win. Thus Toyota was left to take 9th place in the race with the lone No. 27 entry, which ended the race 25 laps behind the winning [[Porsche 911 GT1]].\n\nTheir [[1999 24 Hours of Le Mans]] started bitterly after the team was plagued by multiple [[Michelin]] tyre failures, the situation becoming somewhat reminiscent of 1998, when the No. 1 & No. 2 car were retired. [[Martin Brundle]] in the No. 1 Toyota suffered a puncture at high speed on the [[Mulsanne Straight]], the cars rear suspension was badly damaged and he was unable (despite his best efforts) to get back to the pits. The No. 2 Toyota being driven by [[Thierry Boutsen]] was next to go when he suffered a high speed crash under the Dunlop bridge due to a rapid deflation. The car was destroyed and Boutsen suffered injury to his lower back. At the break of dawn, the No. 15 BMW was almost a lap ahead of the No. 3 Toyota which had been quietly cruising around at a steady pace. With this sniff of a win [[Ukyo Katayama]] put the foot down in the Toyota and set the fastest lap of the race. He narrowed the gap to less than a minute till again a tyre blowout befell the Toyota team again. Ukyo was however able to return to the pits for new tyres and continued. He managed to finish second after a valiant effort placing first in the GT-P class. However, they fell short of the overall victory at Le Mans, which would have made them only the second Japanese manufacturer to get an overall win ([[Mazdaspeed|Mazda]] being the first in [[1991 24 Hours of Le Mans|1991]]).\n\nThe GT-One raced only once more, a single entrant appearing in the [[1999 Le Mans Fuji 1000km]]. Although the race mostly consisted of Japanese teams, thus leaving out most of the manufacturers that had competed at Le Mans, Toyota still had to compete against rival Nissan, who also entered their [[Nissan R391|R391]]. In the end the GT-One would fall short once again, finishing 2nd and only one lap behind the winning R391.\n\nThe GT-One program was not continued into 2000, Toyota instead turning TTE into leaders of the new [[Toyota F1]] team. This would mark a hiatus in Toyota's attempts at Le Mans until the 2012 season, over a decade later, when Toyota decided to once again contest at the top tier of sports car racing.\n\n=== Toyota TS030 Hybrid ===\n[[File:Toyota TS030 Hybrid 2012 WEC Fuji FP1.jpg|right|thumb|Toyota TS030 Hybrid LMP1]]\nIn October 2011, Toyota announced its return to Le Mans in [[2012 24 Hours of Le Mans|2012]], with a [[Toyota TS030 Hybrid|hybrid-powered Le Mans Prototype]], sporting a petrol engine similar to that found in their customer P1 car. The car would be entered in the inaugural season of the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]], though it would miss the [[12 Hours of Sebring|first round]] of the series.\n\nToyota suffered a severe setback with a crash in late April preventing the debut of the car at the [[2012 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps]], but managed to get two TS030s ready by Le Mans. Unfortunately, neither car finished the race: the #8 car being driven by [[Anthony Davidson]] suffered a massive crash with a Ferrari 458 (which also fractured two of Davidson's vertebrae), while the No. 7 car hit the [[DeltaWing]] and later retired with an engine failure.\n\nToyota continued to compete in the rest of the WEC season with a single car, collecting 3 wins including the [[2012 6 Hours of Fuji|6 Hours of Fuji]].\n\nAt the [[2013 24 Hours of Le Mans]] Toyota achieved its fourth second-place finish at Le Mans with a revised Toyota TS030 driven by [[St\u00e9phane Sarrazin]], [[Anthony Davidson]] and [[S\u00e9bastien Buemi]]. The sister car finished in 4th several laps down.\n\nToyota finished the WEC season in 2nd place again, taking two wins at rain-shortened Fuji and Shanghai.\n\n=== Toyota TS040 Hybrid ===\nToyota announced in October 2013 that it would continue racing in the World Endurance Championship in 2014. In order to comply with new-for-2014 LMP1 rules, Toyota revealed its new car, the [[Toyota TS040 Hybrid]]. The car uses a similar hybrid system as the TS030 Hybrid but adds an additional supercapacitor at the front to allow temporary [[four-wheel drive]].\n\n=== 24 Hours of Le Mans results ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!

It employs around 350 people in a 30,000m<sup>2</sup> factory and provides [[motorsport]] and automotive services to fellow Toyota companies and to outside clients.\n\nAs of the 2018 season, TMG currently operates Toyota's FIA [[FIA World Endurance Championship|World Endurance Championship]] (WEC) factory team under the name Toyota Gazoo Racing.<ref name=\"Toyota Motorsport GmbH official website\">{{cite web |title=Toyota Motorsport GmbH |url=https://www.toyota-motorsport.com/en/ |website=Toyota Motorsport GmbH official website |accessdate=1 July 2018}}</ref> TMG's WEC team is not to be confused with [[Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT]], which is Toyota's factory team in the FIA [[World Rally Championship]] and is not operated by TMG.\n\nTMG was responsible, under the name Toyota Team Europe (TTE), for Toyota's [[World Rally Championship]] cars starting from the 1970s right up to the 1990s. In addition, since 1994, TMG has developed a tuning business for Toyota road cars, offering complete vehicle service, tuning and sports accessories. In 1999 the company stopped participating in rallying, in order to prepare for a switch to [[Formula One]] in {{f1|2002}}. From 2002 to 2009, TMG participated in Formula 1 under the team name [[Panasonic Toyota Racing]], starting 139 Grands Prix. In that time, they finished on the podium 13 times, earned three pole positions and scored a total of 278.5 points. On 4 November 2009, Toyota announced their withdrawal from Formula 1.\n\nIn the meantime, it entered sports car racing and the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]: in [[1998 24 Hours of Le Mans|1998]] and [[1999 24 Hours of Le Mans|1999]], finishing 2nd in 1999 with their notably quick [[Toyota GT-One]]. TMG has moved back into sports car racing as an exclusive engine supplier from 2011 onwards to [[Lola Cars]], powering [[Rebellion Racing]]. In 2012 TMG fully returned to sports car competition with the [[Toyota TS030 Hybrid]].\n\nIn addition to its motorsport activities, Toyota Motorsport also undertakes production vehicle analysis and development on behalf of Toyota, providing \"highly skilled and rapidly reacting engineering\" services. A range of modified Toyota road cars is also available from the [[Cologne]] factory.\n\n== Rally history ==\n[[File:Toyota Celica Gr.A 001.JPG|left|thumb|[[Toyota Celica GT-Four]] ST165 Group A in Safari Rally trim]]\n[[File:Toyota Celica rally.jpg|right|thumb|TTE's Celica GT-Four ST185 Group A in Safari Rally trim]]\n[[File:Toyota Monte-Carlo 1999.jpg|thumb|TTE [[Toyota Corolla WRC|Corolla WRC]] at the Monte-Carlo Rally]]\n{{For|Toyota WRC team competing since 2017|Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT}}\n{{Main|Toyota Motorsport WRC results}}\nTTE was started in London in 1972 when Toyota representatives and [[Ove Andersson]], who won the [[Monte Carlo Rally]] in 1971, decided that he should drive a [[Toyota Celica]] in the [[RAC Rally]] in the autumn of that year. Andersson came ninth, beating other Japanese top teams who mostly worked with the [[Datsun 240Z]].\n\nThe Toyota Celica had to travel from Japan to the European events all the time, which was not good for the car, so Andersson set up a workshop of his own, [[Andersson Motorsport]], which became Toyota's first European team. It was founded in 1973 with its workshop in Uppsala, Sweden. Shortly thereafter it moved to Brussels, Belgium. It ran [[Toyota Corolla|Corollas]] and Celicas from this location, with some help from Japan for major events.\n\nToyota Team Europe began in February 1975. In August of that year, [[Hannu Mikkola]] won TTE's first rally, the [[1000 Lakes Rally]] in a Corolla 1600, where the competition used 2.0&nbsp;L engines.\n\nIn 1979 TTE moved 11 of the 20 employees from Brussels to Cologne, where the Toyota Allee was created. This was also the first time it used a Celica Turbo, and TTE won the next two Safaris.\n\nIn September 1987, TTE moved to a larger premises, in which they still reside. It was also the time they revealed their first [[four wheel drive]] car, the [[Toyota Celica GT-Four]], driven by [[Juha Kankkunen]] and [[Kenneth Eriksson]]. [[Carlos Sainz]] won the [[1990 World Rally Championship season|1990]] [[FIA]] [[World Rally Championship]] [[List of World Rally Championship Drivers' Champions|Title for Drivers]] with '''ST165'''. The newer GT-Four, '''ST185''', made its debut at the [[1992 World Rally Championship season|1992]] Rallye Monte Carlo, culminating in Sainz again winning the title in this year. The ST185 also won the WRC Driver's and [[List of World Rally Championship Constructors' Champions|Manufacturer's]] Titles in [[1993 World Rally Championship season|1993]] with [[Juha Kankkunen]], and in [[1994 World Rally Championship season|1994]] with [[Didier Auriol]].\n\nIn 1993 [[Toyota Motor Corporation]] bought TTE which then renamed Toyota Motorsport GmbH (TMG). At this time, as a fully owned part of Toyota Motor Corporation, Toyota Motorsport were employing 300 staff from 17 nations.\n\nIn [[1995 World Rally Championship season|1995]] TTE was banned for 12 months<ref>{{cite web |url=http://freespace.virgin.net/shalco.com/tte_ban.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204145940/http://freespace.virgin.net/shalco.com/tte_ban.htm |archivedate=4 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> from the [[World Rally Championship]] (WRC) for cheating by designing an illegal air restrictor<ref>[http://forums.autosport.com/showthread.php?threadid=90222 ]</ref> on the '''ST205''' that included both a bypass mechanism and spring-loaded devices to conceal it from scrutineers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.autosport.com/showthread.php?threadid=90222 |title=Board Message |publisher=Forums.autosport.com |date= |accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref>\nIn the [[1996 World Rally Championship season|1996]] and [[1997 World Rally Championship season|1997]], despite lack of works team appearance in 1996 due to the ban, TTE supported the Celica ST205 rallied by Italian HF Grifone Team, Toyota Team Sweden, Marlboro Toyota Team Belgium, and Tein Sport in the selected WRC events, before introduced the [[Toyota Corolla WRC|Corolla WRC]] in the 1997 Rally of Finland. When they returned to the WRC for [[1998 World Rally Championship season|1998]], they did so with a Corolla WRC driven by the crews of Carlos Sainz/[[Luis Moya]] and Didier Auriol/[[Denis Giraudet]]. They finished the season in second overall in both the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships.\n\nIn [[1999 World Rally Championship season|1999]], however, the manufacturers championship was taken, the third in TTE's existence.\n\n== Sports car racing history ==\n[[File:Toyota GTone.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Toyota GT-One]]]]\nIn addition to spearheading Toyota's efforts in the World Rally Championship, the group has also developed and run the [[Toyota GT-One]] and [[Toyota TS030 Hybrid]] in [[sports car racing]]. The GT-One entered the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] in both [[1998 24 Hours of Le Mans|1998]] and [[1999 24 Hours of Le Mans|1999]], and the TS030 Hybrid made its d\u00e9but in [[2012 24 Hours of Le Mans|2012]].\n\n=== GT-One ===\nIntroduced in time for [[1998 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans in 1998]], the GT-One first appeared at the official testing days for the race held in May. Three GT-Ones appeared, setting the 2nd, 5th, and 10th best times, easily beating out custom built prototypes which were meant to be the superior class. For the race week itself, all three cars performed admirably in qualifying by continuing their quick pace, qualifying 2nd, 7th, and 8th, being beaten only by their GT class competitor, Mercedes-Benz. For the race itself, the No. 28 GT-One suffered from a high speed accident halfway through the race, taking it out of competition. The two other entrants continued to fight on, both remaining in the top 10. However, within the closing hours, the higher ranked No. 29 GT-One suffered a gearbox failure while in competition for the race win. Thus Toyota was left to take 9th place in the race with the lone No. 27 entry, which ended the race 25 laps behind the winning [[Porsche 911 GT1]].\n\nTheir [[1999 24 Hours of Le Mans]] started bitterly after the team was plagued by multiple [[Michelin]] tyre failures, the situation becoming somewhat reminiscent of 1998, when the No. 1 & No. 2 car were retired. [[Martin Brundle]] in the No. 1 Toyota suffered a puncture at high speed on the [[Mulsanne Straight]], the cars rear suspension was badly damaged and he was unable (despite his best efforts) to get back to the pits. The No. 2 Toyota being driven by [[Thierry Boutsen]] was next to go when he suffered a high speed crash under the Dunlop bridge due to a rapid deflation. The car was destroyed and Boutsen suffered injury to his lower back. At the break of dawn, the No. 15 BMW was almost a lap ahead of the No. 3 Toyota which had been quietly cruising around at a steady pace. With this sniff of a win [[Ukyo Katayama]] put the foot down in the Toyota and set the fastest lap of the race. He narrowed the gap to less than a minute till again a tyre blowout befell the Toyota team again. Ukyo was however able to return to the pits for new tyres and continued. He managed to finish second after a valiant effort placing first in the GT-P class. However, they fell short of the overall victory at Le Mans, which would have made them only the second Japanese manufacturer to get an overall win ([[Mazdaspeed|Mazda]] being the first in [[1991 24 Hours of Le Mans|1991]]).\n\nThe GT-One raced only once more, a single entrant appearing in the [[1999 Le Mans Fuji 1000km]]. Although the race mostly consisted of Japanese teams, thus leaving out most of the manufacturers that had competed at Le Mans, Toyota still had to compete against rival Nissan, who also entered their [[Nissan R391|R391]]. In the end the GT-One would fall short once again, finishing 2nd and only one lap behind the winning R391.\n\nThe GT-One program was not continued into 2000, Toyota instead turning TTE into leaders of the new [[Toyota F1]] team. This would mark a hiatus in Toyota's attempts at Le Mans until the 2012 season, over a decade later, when Toyota decided to once again contest at the top tier of sports car racing.\n\n=== Toyota TS030 Hybrid ===\n[[File:Toyota TS030 Hybrid 2012 WEC Fuji FP1.jpg|right|thumb|Toyota TS030 Hybrid LMP1]]\nIn October 2011, Toyota announced its return to Le Mans in [[2012 24 Hours of Le Mans|2012]], with a [[Toyota TS030 Hybrid|hybrid-powered Le Mans Prototype]], sporting a petrol engine similar to that found in their customer P1 car. The car would be entered in the inaugural season of the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]], though it would miss the [[12 Hours of Sebring|first round]] of the series.\n\nToyota suffered a severe setback with a crash in late April preventing the debut of the car at the [[2012 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps]], but managed to get two TS030s ready by Le Mans. Unfortunately, neither car finished the race: the #8 car being driven by [[Anthony Davidson]] suffered a massive crash with a Ferrari 458 (which also fractured two of Davidson's vertebrae), while the No. 7 car hit the [[DeltaWing]] and later retired with an engine failure.\n\nToyota continued to compete in the rest of the WEC season with a single car, collecting 3 wins including the [[2012 6 Hours of Fuji|6 Hours of Fuji]].\n\nAt the [[2013 24 Hours of Le Mans]] Toyota achieved its fourth second-place finish at Le Mans with a revised Toyota TS030 driven by [[St\u00e9phane Sarrazin]], [[Anthony Davidson]] and [[S\u00e9bastien Buemi]]. The sister car finished in 4th several laps down.\n\nToyota finished the WEC season in 2nd place again, taking two wins at rain-shortened Fuji and Shanghai.\n\n=== Toyota TS040 Hybrid ===\nToyota announced in October 2013 that it would continue racing in the World Endurance Championship in 2014. In order to comply with new-for-2014 LMP1 rules, Toyota revealed its new car, the [[Toyota TS040 Hybrid]]. The car uses a similar hybrid system as the TS030 Hybrid but adds an additional supercapacitor at the front to allow temporary [[four-wheel drive]].\n\n=== 24 Hours of Le Mans results ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!

It combines elements of African-American [[gospel music]], [[rhythm and blues]] and [[jazz]]. Soul music became popular for dancing and listening in the United States, where record labels such as [[Motown]], [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] and [[Stax Records|Stax]] were influential during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing [[rock music]] and the [[music of Africa]].<ref name=\"Mojapelo2008\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-KW9f02oNMC&pg=PA1 |title=Beyond Memory: Recording the History, Moments and Memories of South African Music |last=Max Mojapelo |publisher=African Minds |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-920299-28-6 |pages=1\u2013 |access-date=September 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], soul is \"music that arose out of the [[African American culture|black experience in America]] through the transmutation of gospel and rhythm & blues into a form of [[funk]]y, [[Secularity|secular]] testifying\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/otis-redding/ |title=Otis Redding |website=Rockhall.com}}</ref> Catchy rhythms, stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body moves, are an important feature of soul music.

By 1968, the soul music genre had begun to splinter. Some soul artists developed [[funk]] music, while other singers and groups developed slicker, more sophisticated, and in some cases more politically conscious varieties.<ref name=\"bbc\" /> By the early 1970s, soul music had been influenced by [[psychedelic rock]] and other genres, leading to [[psychedelic soul]]. The United States saw the development of [[neo soul]] around 1994. There are also several other subgenres and offshoots of soul music.\n\nThe key subgenres of soul include the Detroit ([[Motown]]) style, a more [[pop music|pop]]-friendly and rhythmic style; ''deep soul'' and ''southern soul'', driving, energetic soul styles combining [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] with southern [[gospel music]] sounds; [[Memphis soul]], a shimmering, sultry style; [[New Orleans soul]], which came out of the rhythm and blues style; [[Chicago soul]], a lighter gospel-influenced sound; [[Philadelphia soul]], a lush [[orchestral]] sound with [[doo-wop]]-inspired vocals; as well as [[psychedelic soul]], a blend of [[psychedelic rock]] and soul music.\n\n== Origins ==\n{{Gospel music articles}}\n[[File:Ray_Charles_classic_piano_pose.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ray Charles]] pioneered the soul music genre during the 1950s by combining blues, rhythm and blues, and gospel styles]]\nSoul music has its roots in [[traditional black gospel music|traditional African-American gospel music]] and [[rhythm and blues]] and as the hybridization of their respective religious and secular styles \u2013 in both lyrical content and instrumentation \u2013 that began in the 1950s.

Burke's early 1960s songs, including \"[[Cry to Me]]\", \"[[Just Out of Reach]]\" and \"Down in the Valley\" are considered classics of the genre. Guralnick wrote: <blockquote>\"Soul started, in a sense, with the 1961 success of Solomon Burke's \"Just Out Of Reach\". Ray Charles, of course, had already enjoyed enormous success (also on Atlantic), as had James Brown and Sam Cooke \u2014 primarily in a pop vein.

With its relaxed tempos and soft melodies, quiet storm soul took influences from [[Jazz fusion|fusion]] and [[adult contemporary]]. Some funk bands, such as EW&F, The Commodores and [[Con Funk Shun]] would have a few quiet storm tracks on their albums. Among the most successful acts in this era include Smokey Robinson, Jeffry Osbourne, [[Peabo Bryson]], [[Chaka Kahn]], and [[Larry Graham]].\n\nAfter the decline of disco and funk in the early 1980s, soul music became influenced by [[electro music]]. It became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a style known as [[contemporary R&B]], which sounded very different from the original [[rhythm and blues]] style. The United States saw the development of [[neo-soul]] around 1994. Mainstream [[record label]] marketing support for soul genres cooled in the 2000s due to the industry's re-focus on [[hip hop music|hip-hop]].\n\n== Notable record labels and producers ==\n=== Motown records ===\n[[File:LeviStubbs.jpg|thumb|Levi Stubbs singing lead with the Four Tops in 1966]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2014}}\n{{Main|Motown Records}}\n[[Berry Gordy]]'s successful Tamla/Motown group of labels was notable for being African-American owned, unlike most of the earlier independent R&B labels. Notable artists under this label were [[The Supremes]], [[The Temptations]], [[The Miracles]], the [[Four Tops]], [[The Marvelettes]], [[Mary Wells]], [[Junior Walker|Jr. Walker & The All-Stars]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Tammi Terrell]], [[Martha and the Vandellas]],<ref name=\"pc25\">{{Pop Chronicles |25| |Motown artists}}</ref> and [[The Jackson Five]].\n\nHits were made using a quasi-industrial \"[[Assembly line|production-line]]\" approach. The producers and songwriters brought artistic sensitivity to the three-minute tunes. [[Brian Holland]], [[Lamont Dozier]] and [[Eddie Holland]] were rarely out of the charts for their work as [[songwriter]]s and [[record producer]]s for [[The Supremes]], the [[Four Tops]] and [[Martha and the Vandellas]].<ref name=pc25/> They allowed important elements to shine through the dense musical texture. Rhythm was emphasized by handclaps or [[tambourine]]. [[Smokey Robinson]] was another writer and record producer who added lyrics to \"[[The Tracks of My Tears]]\" by his group [[The Miracles]], which was one of the most important songs of the decade.\n\n=== Stax Records and Atlantic records ===\n{{Main|Stax Records|Atlantic Records}}\nStax Records and Atlantic Records were independent labels that produced high-quality dance records featuring many well known singers of the day. They tended to have smaller ensembles marked by expressive gospel-tinged vocals. Brass and saxophones were also used extensively.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Pop Music: The Textbook |publisher=Peters Editions |date=November 1, 2013 |first=Julia |last=Winterson |first2=Peter |last2=Nickol |first3=Toby |last3=Bricheno |first4=Ben |last4=Kaye |first5=Jessica |last5=Winterson |ISBN=978-1843670391}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=February 2020}}  [[Stax Records]], founded by siblings Estelle and James Stewart, was the second most successful record label behind [[Motown Records]].

Ertegun wrote many songs for [[Ray Charles]] and [[The Clovers]].

The Motown sound often includes hand [[clapping]], a powerful [[bassline]], [[string section|strings]], [[brass section|brass]] and [[vibraphone]]. Motown Records' house band was [[The Funk Brothers]]. [[AllMusic]] cites Motown as the pioneering label of pop-soul, a style of soul music with raw vocals, but polished production and toned-down subject matter intended for pop radio and [[crossover (music)|crossover]] success.<ref name=\"popsoul\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/pop-soul-ma0000011870 |title=Pop-Soul |publisher=[[AllMusic]].

[[Memphis, Tennessee]] label [[Stax Records]] nurtured a distinctive sound, which included putting vocals further back in the mix than most contemporary R&B records, using vibrant horn parts in place of background vocals, and a focus on the low end of the frequency spectrum. The vast majority of Stax releases were backed by house bands [[Booker T & the MGs]] (with [[Booker T. Jones]], [[Steve Cropper]], [[Duck Dunn]], and [[Al Jackson Jr.|Al Jackson]]) and the Memphis Horns (the splinter horn section of [[the Mar-Keys]], trumpeter [[Wayne Jackson (musician)|Wayne Jackson]] and saxophonist [[Andrew Love (musician)|Andrew Love]]).\n\n=== Memphis soul ===\n{{further|Memphis soul}}\n''Memphis soul'' is a shimmering, sultry style of soul music produced in the 1960s and 1970s at [[Stax Records]] and [[Hi Records]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. It featured melancholic and melodic horns, [[Hammond organ]], bass, and drums, as heard in recordings by Hi's [[Al Green]] and Stax's [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]]. The latter group also sometimes played in the harder-edged [[Southern soul]] style. The Hi Records house band ([[Hi Rhythm Section]]) and producer [[Willie Mitchell (musician)|Willie Mitchell]] developed a surging soul style heard in the label's 1970s hit recordings. Some Stax recordings fit into this style, but had their own unique sound.\n\n=== Birmingham soul ===\nImpactful and underrated [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] soul is a driving and strongly rhythmic style, which combined elements of gospel music with the uptempo energy of R&B. As a soul city it is thoroughly influenced by the hard driving \"southern soul\" of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] era and the musical and social legacy of that time. The rise of Muscle Shoals Alabama as a recording center was in part influenced by professional musicians coming north from Birmingham such as [[Barry Beckett]], of the [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]] also known as the \"Swampers\" and bringing their musical influence with them to the [[Tennessee Valley]]. Similarly [[Detroit soul]] is influenced to a large extent by Birmingham and its downhome soul roots because many of its performers had migrated north from [[Alabama]] as well. The most notable are 3/5 of the [[Temptations]], [[Melvin Franklin]] of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], and [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]], and [[Eddie Kendricks]] both of Birmingham.\n\n=== New Orleans soul ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}\n{{further|New Orleans soul}}\nThe New Orleans soul scene directly came out of the rhythm and blues era, when such artists as [[Little Richard]], [[Fats Domino]], and [[Huey Piano Smith]] made a huge impact on the pop and R&B charts and a huge direct influence on the birth of [[Funk]] music. The principal architect of Crescent City's soul was songwriter, arranger, and producer [[Allen Toussaint]].  He worked with such artists as [[Irma Thomas]] (\"the Soul Queen of New Orleans\"), Jessie Hill, [[Chris Kenner]], Benny Spellman, and [[Ernie K. Doe]] on the Minit/Instant label complex to produce a distinctive New Orleans soul sound that generated a passel of national hits. Other notable New Orleans hits came from Robert Parker, [[Betty Harris]], and [[Aaron Neville]]. While record labels in New Orleans largely disappeared by the mid-1960s, producers in the city continued to record New Orleans soul artists for other mainly New York City- and Los Angeles-based record labels\u2014notably [[Lee Dorsey]] for New York\u2013based Amy Records and the Meters for New York\u2013based Josie and then LA-based Reprise.\n\n=== Chicago soul ===\n{{further|Chicago soul}}\nChicago soul generally had a light gospel-influenced sound, but the large number of record labels based in the city tended to produce a more diverse sound than other cities. [[Vee Jay Records]], which lasted until 1966, produced recordings by [[Jerry Butler (singer)|Jerry Butler]], [[Betty Everett]], [[Dee Clark]], and [[Gene Chandler]]. [[Chess Records]], mainly a blues and rock and roll label, produced a number of major soul artists, including [[The Dells]] and [[Billy Stewart]]. [[Curtis Mayfield]] not only scored many hits with his group, [[The Impressions]], but wrote many hit songs for Chicago artists and produced hits on his own labels for [[The Fascinations]], [[Major Lance]], and the [[Five Stairsteps]].\n\n=== Philadelphia soul ===\n{{further|Philadelphia soul}}\nBased primarily in the [[Philadelphia International]] record label, Philadelphia soul (or Philly Soul) had lush [[string section|string]] and [[horn section|horn]] arrangements and [[doo-wop]]-inspired vocals. [[Thom Bell]], and [[Kenneth Gamble & Leon Huff]] are considered the founders of Philadelphia soul, which produced hits for [[Patti LaBelle]], [[the O'Jays]], [[The Intruders (music group)|the Intruders]], [[the Three Degrees]], [[the Delfonics]], [[the Stylistics]], [[Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes]], and [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|the Spinners]].\n\n=== Psychedelic soul ===\n{{Main|Psychedelic soul}}\nPsychedelic soul, sometimes known as \"black rock\", was a blend of [[psychedelic rock]] and soul music in the late 1960s, which paved the way for the mainstream emergence of [[funk]] music a few years later.<ref name=\"Harrington2002\">J.

The style was developed in the early to mid-1990s and the term was coined in the early 1990s by producer and [[record label]] executive [[Kedar Massenburg]]. A key element in neo soul is a heavy dose of [[Fender Rhodes]] or [[Wurlitzer electric piano]] \"pads\" over a mellow, grooving interplay between the drums (usually with a rim shot snare sound) and a muted, deep funky bass. The Fender Rhodes piano sound gives the music a warm, organic character.\n\n=== Northern soul and modern soul ===\n{{further|Northern soul|Modern soul}}\nNorthern soul is a music and dance movement that emerged in the late 1960s out of the British [[mod subculture]] in [[Northern England]] and the [[Midlands|English Midlands]], based on a particular style of soul music with a heavy beat and fast tempo. The phrase ''northern soul'' was coined by journalist [[Dave Godin]] and popularised through his column in ''Blues and Soul'' magazine.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chrishunt.biz/features05.html |title=Chris Hunt - Wigan Casino |website=Chrishunt.biz |access-date=September 29, 2018}}</ref>   The rare soul records were played by DJs at [[nightclub]]s, and included obscure 1960s and early 1970s American recordings with an [[uptempo]] beat, such as those on [[Motown]] and smaller labels, not necessarily from the [[Northern United States]].\n  \nModern soul developed when northern soul DJs began looking in record shops in the United States and United Kingdom for music that was more complex and contemporary. What emerged was a richer sound that was more advanced in terms of [[Hi-Fi]] and [[FM radio]] technology.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== Hypersoul ===\nHyper soul is a medley of soul and dance music.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.riddim.ca/?p=180 |title=What is Hypersoul?

It is also remarkable for possessing a more euro sound influence than the other subgenres of soul. The subgenre provides more roles that may be adopted by the song's female subjects and more space to express different facets of gender experience as compared to traditional soul, through the reversal of male-female dynamics and the embrace of dominating and confrontational attitudes.

To a lesser extent, the term has been applied to singers in other [[music genre]]s that are influenced by soul music. Artists like [[Hall and Oates]], [[David Bowie]], [[Teena Marie]], Hamilton, Joe Frank & Raynolds, [[Frankie Vali]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Amy Winehouse]] and [[Adele]] are known as blue-eyed soul singers.\n\nAnother term is '''brown-eyed soul''', or soul music or R&B created and performed mainly by [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]] in [[Southern California]] during the 1960s, continuing through to the early 1980s.<ref name=\"ALLmu\">[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d11241|pure_url=yes}} allmusic: Brown-eyed Soul].

It combines elements of African-American [[gospel music]], [[rhythm and blues]] and [[jazz]]. Soul music became popular for dancing and listening in the United States, where record labels such as [[Motown]], [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] and [[Stax Records|Stax]] were influential during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing [[rock music]] and the [[music of Africa]].<ref name=\"Mojapelo2008\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-KW9f02oNMC&pg=PA1 |title=Beyond Memory: Recording the History, Moments and Memories of South African Music |last=Max Mojapelo |publisher=African Minds |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-920299-28-6 |pages=1\u2013 |access-date=September 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], soul is \"music that arose out of the [[African American culture|black experience in America]] through the transmutation of gospel and rhythm & blues into a form of [[funk]]y, [[Secularity|secular]] testifying\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/otis-redding/ |title=Otis Redding |website=Rockhall.com}}</ref> Catchy rhythms, stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body moves, are an important feature of soul music.

By 1968, the soul music genre had begun to splinter. Some soul artists developed [[funk]] music, while other singers and groups developed slicker, more sophisticated, and in some cases more politically conscious varieties.<ref name=\"bbc\" /> By the early 1970s, soul music had been influenced by [[psychedelic rock]] and other genres, leading to [[psychedelic soul]]. The United States saw the development of [[neo soul]] around 1994. There are also several other subgenres and offshoots of soul music.\n\nThe key subgenres of soul include the Detroit ([[Motown]]) style, a more [[pop music|pop]]-friendly and rhythmic style; ''deep soul'' and ''southern soul'', driving, energetic soul styles combining [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] with southern [[gospel music]] sounds; [[Memphis soul]], a shimmering, sultry style; [[New Orleans soul]], which came out of the rhythm and blues style; [[Chicago soul]], a lighter gospel-influenced sound; [[Philadelphia soul]], a lush [[orchestral]] sound with [[doo-wop]]-inspired vocals; as well as [[psychedelic soul]], a blend of [[psychedelic rock]] and soul music.\n\n== Origins ==\n{{Gospel music articles}}\n[[File:Ray_Charles_classic_piano_pose.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ray Charles]] pioneered the soul music genre during the 1950s by combining blues, rhythm and blues, and gospel styles]]\nSoul music has its roots in [[traditional black gospel music|traditional African-American gospel music]] and [[rhythm and blues]] and as the hybridization of their respective religious and secular styles \u2013 in both lyrical content and instrumentation \u2013 that began in the 1950s.

With its relaxed tempos and soft melodies, quiet storm soul took influences from [[Jazz fusion|fusion]] and [[adult contemporary]]. Some funk bands, such as EW&F, The Commodores and [[Con Funk Shun]] would have a few quiet storm tracks on their albums. Among the most successful acts in this era include Smokey Robinson, Jeffry Osbourne, [[Peabo Bryson]], [[Chaka Kahn]], and [[Larry Graham]].\n\nAfter the decline of disco and funk in the early 1980s, soul music became influenced by [[electro music]]. It became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a style known as [[contemporary R&B]], which sounded very different from the original [[rhythm and blues]] style. The United States saw the development of [[neo-soul]] around 1994. Mainstream [[record label]] marketing support for soul genres cooled in the 2000s due to the industry's re-focus on [[hip hop music|hip-hop]].\n\n== Notable record labels and producers ==\n=== Motown records ===\n[[File:LeviStubbs.jpg|thumb|Levi Stubbs singing lead with the Four Tops in 1966]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2014}}\n{{Main|Motown Records}}\n[[Berry Gordy]]'s successful Tamla/Motown group of labels was notable for being African-American owned, unlike most of the earlier independent R&B labels. Notable artists under this label were [[The Supremes]], [[The Temptations]], [[The Miracles]], the [[Four Tops]], [[The Marvelettes]], [[Mary Wells]], [[Junior Walker|Jr. Walker & The All-Stars]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Tammi Terrell]], [[Martha and the Vandellas]],<ref name=\"pc25\">{{Pop Chronicles |25| |Motown artists}}</ref> and [[The Jackson Five]].\n\nHits were made using a quasi-industrial \"[[Assembly line|production-line]]\" approach. The producers and songwriters brought artistic sensitivity to the three-minute tunes. [[Brian Holland]], [[Lamont Dozier]] and [[Eddie Holland]] were rarely out of the charts for their work as [[songwriter]]s and [[record producer]]s for [[The Supremes]], the [[Four Tops]] and [[Martha and the Vandellas]].<ref name=pc25/> They allowed important elements to shine through the dense musical texture. Rhythm was emphasized by handclaps or [[tambourine]]. [[Smokey Robinson]] was another writer and record producer who added lyrics to \"[[The Tracks of My Tears]]\" by his group [[The Miracles]], which was one of the most important songs of the decade.\n\n=== Stax Records and Atlantic records ===\n{{Main|Stax Records|Atlantic Records}}\nStax Records and Atlantic Records were independent labels that produced high-quality dance records featuring many well known singers of the day. They tended to have smaller ensembles marked by expressive gospel-tinged vocals. Brass and saxophones were also used extensively.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Pop Music: The Textbook |publisher=Peters Editions |date=November 1, 2013 |first=Julia |last=Winterson |first2=Peter |last2=Nickol |first3=Toby |last3=Bricheno |first4=Ben |last4=Kaye |first5=Jessica |last5=Winterson |ISBN=978-1843670391}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=February 2020}}  [[Stax Records]], founded by siblings Estelle and James Stewart, was the second most successful record label behind [[Motown Records]].

The Motown sound often includes hand [[clapping]], a powerful [[bassline]], [[string section|strings]], [[brass section|brass]] and [[vibraphone]]. Motown Records' house band was [[The Funk Brothers]]. [[AllMusic]] cites Motown as the pioneering label of pop-soul, a style of soul music with raw vocals, but polished production and toned-down subject matter intended for pop radio and [[crossover (music)|crossover]] success.<ref name=\"popsoul\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/pop-soul-ma0000011870 |title=Pop-Soul |publisher=[[AllMusic]].

[[Memphis, Tennessee]] label [[Stax Records]] nurtured a distinctive sound, which included putting vocals further back in the mix than most contemporary R&B records, using vibrant horn parts in place of background vocals, and a focus on the low end of the frequency spectrum. The vast majority of Stax releases were backed by house bands [[Booker T & the MGs]] (with [[Booker T. Jones]], [[Steve Cropper]], [[Duck Dunn]], and [[Al Jackson Jr.|Al Jackson]]) and the Memphis Horns (the splinter horn section of [[the Mar-Keys]], trumpeter [[Wayne Jackson (musician)|Wayne Jackson]] and saxophonist [[Andrew Love (musician)|Andrew Love]]).\n\n=== Memphis soul ===\n{{further|Memphis soul}}\n''Memphis soul'' is a shimmering, sultry style of soul music produced in the 1960s and 1970s at [[Stax Records]] and [[Hi Records]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. It featured melancholic and melodic horns, [[Hammond organ]], bass, and drums, as heard in recordings by Hi's [[Al Green]] and Stax's [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]]. The latter group also sometimes played in the harder-edged [[Southern soul]] style. The Hi Records house band ([[Hi Rhythm Section]]) and producer [[Willie Mitchell (musician)|Willie Mitchell]] developed a surging soul style heard in the label's 1970s hit recordings. Some Stax recordings fit into this style, but had their own unique sound.\n\n=== Birmingham soul ===\nImpactful and underrated [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] soul is a driving and strongly rhythmic style, which combined elements of gospel music with the uptempo energy of R&B. As a soul city it is thoroughly influenced by the hard driving \"southern soul\" of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] era and the musical and social legacy of that time. The rise of Muscle Shoals Alabama as a recording center was in part influenced by professional musicians coming north from Birmingham such as [[Barry Beckett]], of the [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]] also known as the \"Swampers\" and bringing their musical influence with them to the [[Tennessee Valley]]. Similarly [[Detroit soul]] is influenced to a large extent by Birmingham and its downhome soul roots because many of its performers had migrated north from [[Alabama]] as well. The most notable are 3/5 of the [[Temptations]], [[Melvin Franklin]] of [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], and [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]], and [[Eddie Kendricks]] both of Birmingham.\n\n=== New Orleans soul ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}\n{{further|New Orleans soul}}\nThe New Orleans soul scene directly came out of the rhythm and blues era, when such artists as [[Little Richard]], [[Fats Domino]], and [[Huey Piano Smith]] made a huge impact on the pop and R&B charts and a huge direct influence on the birth of [[Funk]] music. The principal architect of Crescent City's soul was songwriter, arranger, and producer [[Allen Toussaint]].  He worked with such artists as [[Irma Thomas]] (\"the Soul Queen of New Orleans\"), Jessie Hill, [[Chris Kenner]], Benny Spellman, and [[Ernie K. Doe]] on the Minit/Instant label complex to produce a distinctive New Orleans soul sound that generated a passel of national hits. Other notable New Orleans hits came from Robert Parker, [[Betty Harris]], and [[Aaron Neville]]. While record labels in New Orleans largely disappeared by the mid-1960s, producers in the city continued to record New Orleans soul artists for other mainly New York City- and Los Angeles-based record labels\u2014notably [[Lee Dorsey]] for New York\u2013based Amy Records and the Meters for New York\u2013based Josie and then LA-based Reprise.\n\n=== Chicago soul ===\n{{further|Chicago soul}}\nChicago soul generally had a light gospel-influenced sound, but the large number of record labels based in the city tended to produce a more diverse sound than other cities. [[Vee Jay Records]], which lasted until 1966, produced recordings by [[Jerry Butler (singer)|Jerry Butler]], [[Betty Everett]], [[Dee Clark]], and [[Gene Chandler]]. [[Chess Records]], mainly a blues and rock and roll label, produced a number of major soul artists, including [[The Dells]] and [[Billy Stewart]]. [[Curtis Mayfield]] not only scored many hits with his group, [[The Impressions]], but wrote many hit songs for Chicago artists and produced hits on his own labels for [[The Fascinations]], [[Major Lance]], and the [[Five Stairsteps]].\n\n=== Philadelphia soul ===\n{{further|Philadelphia soul}}\nBased primarily in the [[Philadelphia International]] record label, Philadelphia soul (or Philly Soul) had lush [[string section|string]] and [[horn section|horn]] arrangements and [[doo-wop]]-inspired vocals. [[Thom Bell]], and [[Kenneth Gamble & Leon Huff]] are considered the founders of Philadelphia soul, which produced hits for [[Patti LaBelle]], [[the O'Jays]], [[The Intruders (music group)|the Intruders]], [[the Three Degrees]], [[the Delfonics]], [[the Stylistics]], [[Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes]], and [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|the Spinners]].\n\n=== Psychedelic soul ===\n{{Main|Psychedelic soul}}\nPsychedelic soul, sometimes known as \"black rock\", was a blend of [[psychedelic rock]] and soul music in the late 1960s, which paved the way for the mainstream emergence of [[funk]] music a few years later.<ref name=\"Harrington2002\">J.

The style was developed in the early to mid-1990s and the term was coined in the early 1990s by producer and [[record label]] executive [[Kedar Massenburg]]. A key element in neo soul is a heavy dose of [[Fender Rhodes]] or [[Wurlitzer electric piano]] \"pads\" over a mellow, grooving interplay between the drums (usually with a rim shot snare sound) and a muted, deep funky bass. The Fender Rhodes piano sound gives the music a warm, organic character.\n\n=== Northern soul and modern soul ===\n{{further|Northern soul|Modern soul}}\nNorthern soul is a music and dance movement that emerged in the late 1960s out of the British [[mod subculture]] in [[Northern England]] and the [[Midlands|English Midlands]], based on a particular style of soul music with a heavy beat and fast tempo. The phrase ''northern soul'' was coined by journalist [[Dave Godin]] and popularised through his column in ''Blues and Soul'' magazine.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chrishunt.biz/features05.html |title=Chris Hunt - Wigan Casino |website=Chrishunt.biz |access-date=September 29, 2018}}</ref>   The rare soul records were played by DJs at [[nightclub]]s, and included obscure 1960s and early 1970s American recordings with an [[uptempo]] beat, such as those on [[Motown]] and smaller labels, not necessarily from the [[Northern United States]].\n  \nModern soul developed when northern soul DJs began looking in record shops in the United States and United Kingdom for music that was more complex and contemporary. What emerged was a richer sound that was more advanced in terms of [[Hi-Fi]] and [[FM radio]] technology.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== Hypersoul ===\nHyper soul is a medley of soul and dance music.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.riddim.ca/?p=180 |title=What is Hypersoul? (2001) - Riddim.ca |website=Riddim.ca |access-date=September 29, 2018}}</ref> It maintains the vocal quality, techniques, and style, but includes a movement towards technology, materialism, and heightened sexuality and sensationalism in the rhythm and lyricism.  It is also remarkable for possessing a more euro sound influence than the other subgenres of soul. The subgenre provides more roles that may be adopted by the song's female subjects and more space to express different facets of gender experience as compared to traditional soul, through the reversal of male-female dynamics and the embrace of dominating and confrontational attitudes. Performers included [[Timbaland]], [[Aaliyah]], [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Destiny's Child]]. Hypersoul maybe also be seen as a precursor to modern R&B.\n\n=== Nu-jazz and soul-influenced electronica ===\n{{further|Nu jazz|Electronica}}\nMany artists in various genres of [[electronic music]] (such as [[House music|house]], [[drum n bass]], [[UK garage]], and [[downtempo]]) are heavily influenced by soul, and have produced many soul-inspired compositions.\n\n== Social impact ==\n=== Non-black Americans in soul music ===\n{{further|Non-black Americans in soul music}}\nThe impact of soul music was manifold; both domestic non-black and international artists were influenced by soul music. [[British soul]] and [[Northern soul]], rare soul music played by DJs at [[nightclub]]s in Northern England, are an example of later developments influenced by soul music. \n\nSeveral terms were introduced, such as \"blue-eyed soul\", which is [[Rhythm and Blues|R&B]] or soul music performed by [[White (people)|white]] artists. The meaning of '''blue-eyed soul''' has evolved over decades. Originally the term was associated with mid-1960s white artists who performed soul and R&B that was similar to the music released by [[Motown Records]] and [[Stax Records]].<ref name=\"pc52\">{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1/ |title=Show 52 \u2013 The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit.

The term continued to be used in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly by the British media to refer to a new generation of singers who adopted elements of the Stax and Motown sounds. To a lesser extent, the term has been applied to singers in other [[music genre]]s that are influenced by soul music. Artists like [[Hall and Oates]], [[David Bowie]], [[Teena Marie]], Hamilton, Joe Frank & Raynolds, [[Frankie Vali]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Amy Winehouse]] and [[Adele]] are known as blue-eyed soul singers.\n\nAnother term is '''brown-eyed soul''', or soul music or R&B created and performed mainly by [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]] in [[Southern California]] during the 1960s, continuing through to the early 1980s.<ref name=\"ALLmu\">[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d11241|pure_url=yes}} allmusic: Brown-eyed Soul].
