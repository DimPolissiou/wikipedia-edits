In India, the figure for deaths due to AIDS stood at 170,000 in 2009. The report says India has contributed enormously to the AIDS response. \"With 80 per cent of these drugs being generics purchased in India, several billion dollars have been saved over the past five years. The country is also committed to new forms of partnership with low-income countries through innovative support mechanisms and South Asia cooperation\" the UNAIDS report says. It also points out that India already provides substantial support to neighbouring countries and other Asian countries \u2013 in 2011, it allocated [[USD]] 430 million to 68 projects in [[Bhutan]] across key socio-economic sectors, including health, education and capacity-building. In 2011 at Addis Ababa, the [[Government of India]] further committed to accelerating technology transfer between its [[pharmaceutical]] sector and African manufacturers.\n\nThe National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has increased the number of centres providing free Antiretroviral Treatment (ART) from 54 to 91 centres with another 9 more centres also getting operational soon{{when|date=June 2019}}. At these 91 centres medicines for treating 8,500 patients have been made available. All the 91 centres have specially appointed and trained doctors, counsellors and laboratory technicians to help initiate patients on ART and follow them up regularly. The ART is a combination of three potent drugs, which is being given to the persons with advanced stage of AIDS. Although these drugs do not cure HIV infection, they suppress multiplication of the virus and reduce the number of opportunistic infections thereby improving the quality of life and prolonging the life span. Apart from providing free treatment, all the ART centres are providing counselling to the infected persons so that they maintain regularity of their medication. Continuity is the most important factor for the long term effectiveness of the ART drugs as disruption can lead to drug resistance.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} At present 40,000 are on ART, which are expected to go up to 85,000 by March end.{{when|date=June 2019}} All these centres have a plan to ensure that patients take their medicines regularly and are followed up, in case of default, while maintaining their confidentiality.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nResponding to a petition made by NGO's, in December 2010, the [[Supreme Court of India]] directed Indian government to provide second-line [[Antiretroviral drug|Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)]] to all AIDS patients in the country, by warning the government against abdicating its constitutional duty of providing treatment to HIV positive patients on grounds of financial constraint, as it was issue of the [[right to life]] guaranteed under Article 21 of the [[Indian Constitution]]. Previously in an affidavit before the Supreme Court, NACO had said second-line ART treatment for HIV patients, costing Rs28,500 each, could not be extended to those who had received \"irrational treatment\" by private medical practitioners for the first round, which costs around Rs 6,500. The court rejected both the arguments of financial constraints and only 10 [[viral load]] testing centres needed for test patients for migrating from first line of treatment to the second line being are available, raised by the [[Solicitor General of India|Solicitor General]] representing the government. The court further asked the government to give a clear-cut and \"workable\" solution response within a week's time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-12-11/india/28231314_1_hiv-patients-second-line-treatment-second-line-drugs|title=SC forces govt to agree to second-line ART to all AIDS patients|date=11 Dec 2010|work=The Times of India}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/SC-cautions-govt-over-HIV-treatment/Article1-636976.aspx|title=SC cautions govt over HIV treatment|date=11 December 2010|work=Hindustan Times}}</ref>\n\n=== Funding ===\n{{See also|Cost of HIV treatment}}\n\nHIV spending increased in India from 2003 to 2007, and fell by 15% in 2008 to 2009. Currently, India spends about 5% of its health budget on HIV/AIDS. Spending on HIV/AIDS may create a burden in the health sector which faces a variety of other challenges like malaria, diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Thus, it is crucial for India to step up on its prevention efforts to decrease its spending of the health budget on HIV/AIDS in future.<ref name=avert/>\n\nApart from government funding, there are various international foundations like [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]], [[World Bank Group|World Bank]], [[Elton John AIDS Foundation]], [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]] and others who are providing funding for HIV/AIDS in India.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://london.ejaf.org/grants/|title=Grants \u2013 Elton John AIDS Foundation|work=Elton John AIDS Foundation|access-date=2018-08-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://naco.gov.in/about-us/funds-and-expenditures-0|title=Funds and Expenditures {{!}} National AIDS Control Organization {{!}} MoHFW {{!}} GoI|website=naco.gov.in|access-date=2018-08-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/usaid-amcham-join-hands-to-address-indias-development-challenges/articleshow/65200612.cms|title=USAID, AMCHAM join hands to address India's development challenges \u2013 Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-08-28}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|History of HIV/AIDS}}\n\nIn [[1986 in India|1986]], the first known case of HIV in India was diagnosed by Dr. [[Suniti Solomon]] and her student Dr. [[Sellappan Nirmala]] amongst six female sex workers in [[Chennai]], Tamil Nadu.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2005-02-23-aids-india_x.htm | title=HIV scars India | first1=Steve | last1=Sternberg | date=23 February 2005 | work=USA Today}}</ref><ref name=nirmala>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-37183012|title=The woman who discovered India's first HIV cases|last=Pandey|first=Geeta|date=2016-08-30|newspaper=BBC News|access-date=2016-12-08}}</ref> In the same year, the [[Government of India]] established the National AIDS Committee within the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.<ref name=ODI1>Fiona Samuels and Sanju Wagle 2011.

In India, the figure for deaths due to AIDS stood at 170,000 in 2009. The report says India has contributed enormously to the AIDS response. \"With 80 per cent of these drugs being generics purchased in India, several billion dollars have been saved over the past five years. The country is also committed to new forms of partnership with low-income countries through innovative support mechanisms and South Asia cooperation\" the UNAIDS report says. It also points out that India already provides substantial support to neighbouring countries and other Asian countries \u2013 in 2011, it allocated [[USD]] 430 million to 68 projects in [[Bhutan]] across key socio-economic sectors, including health, education and capacity-building. In 2011 at Addis Ababa, the [[Government of India]] further committed to accelerating technology transfer between its [[pharmaceutical]] sector and African manufacturers.\n\nThe National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) has increased the number of centres providing free Antiretroviral Treatment (ART) from 54 to 91 centres with another 9 more centres also getting operational soon{{when|date=June 2019}}. At these 91 centres medicines for treating 8,500 patients have been made available. All the 91 centres have specially appointed and trained doctors, counsellors and laboratory technicians to help initiate patients on ART and follow them up regularly. The ART is a combination of three potent drugs, which is being given to the persons with advanced stage of AIDS. Although these drugs do not cure HIV infection, they suppress multiplication of the virus and reduce the number of opportunistic infections thereby improving the quality of life and prolonging the life span. Apart from providing free treatment, all the ART centres are providing counselling to the infected persons so that they maintain regularity of their medication. Continuity is the most important factor for the long term effectiveness of the ART drugs as disruption can lead to drug resistance.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} At present 40,000 are on ART, which are expected to go up to 85,000 by March end.{{when|date=June 2019}} All these centres have a plan to ensure that patients take their medicines regularly and are followed up, in case of default, while maintaining their confidentiality.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nResponding to a petition made by NGO's, in December 2010, the [[Supreme Court of India]] directed Indian government to provide second-line [[Antiretroviral drug|Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)]] to all AIDS patients in the country, by warning the government against abdicating its constitutional duty of providing treatment to HIV positive patients on grounds of financial constraint, as it was issue of the [[right to life]] guaranteed under Article 21 of the [[Indian Constitution]]. Previously in an affidavit before the Supreme Court, NACO had said second-line ART treatment for HIV patients, costing Rs28,500 each, could not be extended to those who had received \"irrational treatment\" by private medical practitioners for the first round, which costs around Rs 6,500. The court rejected both the arguments of financial constraints and only 10 [[viral load]] testing centres needed for test patients for migrating from first line of treatment to the second line being are available, raised by the [[Solicitor General of India|Solicitor General]] representing the government. The court further asked the government to give a clear-cut and \"workable\" solution response within a week's time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-12-11/india/28231314_1_hiv-patients-second-line-treatment-second-line-drugs|title=SC forces govt to agree to second-line ART to all AIDS patients|date=11 Dec 2010|work=The Times of India}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/SC-cautions-govt-over-HIV-treatment/Article1-636976.aspx|title=SC cautions govt over HIV treatment|date=11 December 2010|work=Hindustan Times}}</ref>\n\n=== Funding ===\n{{See also|Cost of HIV treatment}}\n\nHIV spending increased in India from 2003 to 2007, and fell by 15% in 2008 to 2009.

Specifically, the [[mental health]] of AIDS orphans in India is shown to be poor as compared to children who were orphaned by other factors.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBefore becoming orphans, children whose parents suffer from AIDS face many obstacles. There is \"tremendous emotional trauma\" associated with having a parent ill with HIV, and the child often worries about resource scarcity, being separated from siblings, and grief of the impending death of the parent.<ref name=\":6\" /> While the parent is ill, the child experiences long periods of uncertainty and episodic crises, which decreases the child's sense of security and stability.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Children orphaned by AIDS : front-line responses from eastern and southern Africa|date=1999|publisher=UNICEF|oclc=59176094}}</ref>\n\nA study done in orphanages in Hyderabad, India showed that orphans in India who have lost one or both parents to AIDS are 1.3 times as likely to be clinically depressed than children orphaned due to other reasons.<ref name=\":0\" /> The study used The [[Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale]] (CES-DC) to measure depression in children orphaned by AIDS and children orphaned by other reasons. The mean depression score for AIDS orphans was 34.6, while that of other orphans was 20.6. When questioned, 58.3% of AIDS orphans answered \u201cI felt like crying\u201d a lot as compared to 20.8% of children orphaned by other reasons. 60.3% of AIDS orphans also answered \u201cI felt sad\u201d a lot, while only 20.8% of children orphaned by other reasons answered the same level. In addition, the study showed that the bulk of the depression score was concentrated among children of younger ages for AIDS orphans, while in other orphans it was mostly seen in older children. A distinction was also made between genders; girls orphaned due to AIDS had a higher rate of depression than boys.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nStudies also show that the likelihood of post traumatic stress disorder is common among AIDS orphans. In a study done in South Africa of the mental health of 60 orphans, 73% of the HIV orphans were shown to have PTSD.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Lata|first=Swaran|date=October 2013|title=Mental health of HIV/AIDS orphans: A review|url=|journal=Journal of AIDS and HIV Research|volume=5|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAnother study done on mental health of different AIDS orphans around the world showed more behavioral problems later in life as compared to other vulnerable children.<ref name=\":3\" /> For example, AIDS orphans were more likely to smoke, be engaged in crime, and drink alcohol.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWhile further studies about mental health in AIDS orphans in India is limited, a study done in South Africa showed that AIDS orphans viewed themselves as having \"no good friends\" than non-orphans.<ref name=\":3\" /> However, they were less likely to have anger problems. The orphans in this study also showed more frequency of nightmares.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==== Education ====\nBecause AIDS OVC often have many family members either deceased or ill, these orphans are often forced into taking jobs at a young age in order to provide for the rest of their family, resulting in lower attendance at school or being forced to drop out from school completely. For example, orphans that have lost their father due to AIDS are forced to take on field or manual labor jobs, which may be high risk occupations. Orphans that have lost their mothers take on housework and childcare. Girls are more often taken out of school to help with domestic work and care for sick parents.<ref name=\":10\" /> Studies show that 17% of children with HIV-infected parents took on a job to assist with household income.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe cost of treatment for HIV is so high that many families often do not have the means to pay for care or education of the child.<ref name=\":8\" /> If a child is forced to drop out of school in order to take on additional responsibility at home due to the illness of his parent, the child is named a \u201cde-facto\u201d orphan.<ref name=\":02\" />&nbsp; There has been no correlation found between gender and risk of poor educational outcomes or risk of dropping out of school.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Sinha|first=Aakanksha|last2=Lombe|first2=Margaret|last3=Saltzman|first3=Leia Y.|last4=Whetten|first4=Kathryn|last5=Whetten|first5=Rachel|date=March 2016|title=Exploring Factors Associated with Educational Outcomes for Orphan and Abandoned Children in India |journal=Global Social Welfare |volume=3|issue=1|pages=23\u201332|doi=10.1007/s40609-016-0043-7|issn=2196-8799|pmc=4830269|pmid=27088068}}</ref> Because of stigma, many AIDS orphans are expelled from school.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nIn a study on education of orphans in India, the caretaker's health was found to be very important in determining if the orphan was at a target educational standard.<ref name=\":1\" /> When a primary caregiver was in poor health, the odds of the orphan being in the target grade level decreased by 54%.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe prevalence of AIDS orphans around the world has been shown to be a threat to economic development in many countries.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite web|last=Salaam|first=Tiaji|title=AIDS Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC): Problems, Responses, and Issues for Congress|publisher=Congressional Research Service|date=February 11, 2005|url=http://ovcsupport.org/wp-content/uploads/Documents/AIDS_Orphans_and_Vulnerable_Children_OVC_Problems_Responses_and_Issues_for_Congress_1.pdf }}</ref> Because AIDS orphans have a lower chance of completing primary and secondary education, they have a lower chance of entering professions that depend on education level and professional training.
