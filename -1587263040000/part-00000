For many thousands of years, humans wore no clothing, which continues to be the norm in some isolated indigenous societies in tropical climates. The widespread adoption of clothing only occurred as people migrated to other climates which required protection from the elements. As societies developed from being [[hunter-gatherer]]s to being agrarian, clothing became part of cultural evolution as individuals and groups became differentiated by status and class. In early civilizations such as Egypt, slaves, children, and others with lower status often continued to be naked.\n\nThe modern understanding of nudity is culturally complex due to different meanings given various states of undress in differing social situations. In any particular society, nudity is defined in relation to being properly dressed, not in relation to the specific body parts being exposed. For humans, nakedness and clothing are connected to many [[Culture|cultural categories]] such as [[Identity (social science)|identity]], [[privacy]], [[social status]] and [[Morality|moral behavior]].{{sfn|Barcan|2004a|loc=Introduction}} Synonyms and euphemisms for nudity abound, including \"birthday suit\", \"in the altogether\" and \"in the buff\". \"In a [[state of nature]]\" is also used by philosophers to refer to the state of humans before the existence of organized societies.<ref name=\"Websters.nude\"/>\n\nIn [[Western world|Western societies]], there are two contradictory cultural traditions relating to nudity. The first comes from the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], who saw the naked body as the natural state and as essentially positive. The second is based upon the [[Abrahamic religions]], which have viewed being naked as shameful and essentially negative. The fundamental teachings of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam prohibit public, and sometimes also private nudity. However, the interaction between the Greek classical and later traditions has resulted in Western ambivalence, with nudity representing both positive and negative meanings in individual psychology, in social life, and in depictions such as art.{{sfn|Barcan|2004a|pp=11\u201315}} In the late 19th century, organized groups of nudists or naturists emerged with the stated purpose of regaining a natural connection to the human body and nature, sometimes in private spaces but also in public.\n\nIn Africa, there is a sharp contrast between the attitude toward nudity in Islamic countries and the attitude toward nudity in certain [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan countries]] that never abandoned, or are reasserting, precolonial norms.\n\nIn Asia, the norms regarding public nudity are in keeping with the cultural values of social propriety and human dignity. Rather than being perceived as immoral or shameful, nakedness is perceived as a breach of [[etiquette]] and perhaps as an embarrassment. In China, [[Face (sociological concept)|saving face]] is a powerful social force. In Japan, proper behavior included a tradition of mixed gender public baths before Western contact began in the 19th century, and proper attire for farmers and other workers might be a loincloth for both men and women. In India, the conventions regarding proper dress do not apply to monks in some Hindu and Jain sects who reject clothing as worldly.\n\nSocieties use clothing (or the lack thereof) as a marker of social status. Generally, social norms regarding nudity are different for men than they are for women. It was not until the 17th century in Europe that the female breast became a part of the body that must be covered in public. It is only in the modern era that the nudity of children represented anything but innocence. Individuals may intentionally violate norms regarding nudity; those without power may use nudity as a form of protest, and those with power may impose nakedness on others as a form of punishment.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of nudity}}\n<!--Opening of main article and summary of what follows -->\nThe history of nudity involves social attitudes to nakedness of the human body in different cultures in history. The use of clothing is one of the changes that mark the end of the [[Neolithic]] and the beginning of civilization.\n=== Prehistory ===\n<!--Defined as period before recorded history-->\n==== Evolution of hairlessness ====\n{{main|Human evolution}}\nThe dissipation of body heat remains the most widely accepted evolutionary explanation for the loss of body hair in early members of the genus [[homo]], the surviving member of which is modern humans.{{sfn|Kushlan|1980}}{{sfn|Wheeler|1985}}{{sfn|Sutou|2012}} Less hair, and an increase in sweat glands, made it easier for their bodies to cool when they moved from shady [[forest]] to open [[savanna]]. This change in environment also resulted in a change in diet, from largely vegetarian to hunting. Pursuing game on the savanna also increased the need for regulation of body heat.{{sfn|Daley|2018}}  Anthropologist and palaeobiologist [[Nina Jablonski]] posits that the ability to dissipate excess body heat through [[Eccrine sweat gland|eccrine sweating]] helped make possible the dramatic enlargement of the brain, the most temperature-sensitive human organ.{{sfn|Jablonski|2012}} Thus the loss of fur was also a factor in further adaptions, both physical and behavioral, that differentiated humans from other primates. Some of these changes are thought to be the result of sexual selection, which was first proposed by Darwin in [[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]. By selecting more hairless mates, humans accelerated changes initiated by natural selection. Sexual selection may also account for the remaining human hair in the pubic area and armpits, which are sites for pheromones, while hair on the head continued to provide protection from the sun.{{sfn|Wade|2003}}\n\nA divergent explanation of humans' relative hairlessness holds that ecroparasites (such as ticks) residing in fur became problematic as humans became hunters living in larger groups with a \"home base\". Nakedness would also make the lack of parasites apparent to prospective mates.{{sfn|Rantala|2007|pp=1\u20137}}\n\nThe last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees was only partially bipedal, often using their front legs for locomotion. Other primate mothers do not need to carry their young because there is fur for them to cling to, but the loss of fur encouraged full bipedalism, allowing the mothers to carry their babies with one or both hands. The combination of hairlessness and upright posture may also explain the enlargement of the female breasts as a sexual signal.{{sfn|Sutou|2012}}\n\nWith the loss of fur, darker, high-melanin skin evolved as a protection from ultraviolet radiation damage. As humans migrated outside of the tropics, varying degrees of depigmentation evolved in order to permit UVB-induced synthesis of previtamin D<sub>3</sub>.{{sfn|Jablonski|Chaplin|2000|pp=57\u2013106}}{{sfn|Jablonski|Chaplin|2017}}\n\n==== Origin of clothing ====\n{{main|History of clothing and textiles}}\nThe wearing of clothing is most likely a behavioral [[adaptation]] arising from the need for protection from the elements, including the sun (for depigmented human populations) and cold temperatures as humans migrated to colder regions. According to a 2010 study published in ''Molecular Biology and Evolution'', estimates of the origins of clothing are based upon a genetic analysis indicating that clothing lice diverged from head louse ancestors at some point in time between 83,000 years ago and 170,000 years ago; this information suggests that the use of clothing likely originated with anatomically modern humans in Africa prior to their migration to colder climates.{{sfn| Toups| Kitchen| Light| Reed| 2010| pp=29\u201332}} A 2017 study published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' estimated that anatomically modern humans evolved 260,000 to 350,000 years ago.{{sfn| Schlebusch| 2017}} \n\nThe complex garments needed for survival in extreme cold would have required invention of the tools for turning animal skins into clothes: scrapers for cleaning and smoothing, fine stone knives for cutting and bone needles for stitching.{{sfn|Gilligan|2010}} What is now called clothing may have originated along with other types of adornment, including [[jewelry]], [[body paint]], [[tattoo]]s, and other [[body modification]]s, \"dressing\" the naked body without concealing it.{{sfn|Hollander|1978|p=83}} According to Leary and Buttermore, body adornment is one of the changes that occurred in the late [[Paleolithic]] (40,000 to 60,000 years ago) in which humans became not only anatomically modern, but also [[Behavioral modernity|culturally and psychologically modern]] and capable of self-reflection and symbolic interaction.{{sfn|Leary|Buttermore|2003}}\n\n=== Ancient history ===\n<!--Defined as period from beginning of recorded history to the end of the classical period, about 3000 BCE to 500 CE. Preliterate societies, unless mentioned in written history (usually as savages and barbarians), are not part of history.-->\n[[File:Fetekti3c.jpg| thumb| left| 240px| Scenes painted on white plaster, Fifth Dynasty (approx. 2500\u20132300 BCE), [[Abusir]] necropolis, [[Egypt]]]]\nIn ancient [[Mesopotamia]], most people owned a single item of clothing, and being naked meant being at the bottom of the social scale, lacking in dignity and status.{{sfn|Batten|2010}}\n\nFor the average person, clothing changed little in [[ancient Egypt]] from the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]], (3150\u20132686 BCE) until the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (2055\u20131650 BCE). Although the genitals of adults were generally covered, nakedness in ancient Egypt was not a violation of any social norm, but more often a convention indicating wealth; those that could afford to do so covered more.{{sfn|Mertz|1990|p=75}} Both men and women wore skirts called ''schenti''\u2014which evolved from [[loincloth]]s and resembled modern kilts. Slaves and laborers were nude or wore loincloths. Only women of the upper classes wore  ''[[kalasiris]]'', a dress of loose draped or translucent linen which came from just above or below the breasts to the ankles.{{sfn|Mark|2017}} Women entertainers performed naked. Children went without clothing until [[puberty]], at about age 12.{{sfn|Altenm\u00fcller|1998|pp=406\u20137}} It was not until the later periods, in particular the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] (1550\u20131069 BCE), that functionaries in the households of the wealthy also began wearing more refined dress, and upper class women wore elaborate dresses and ornamentation which covered their breasts. These later styles are often shown in film and TV as representing ancient Egypt in all periods.{{sfn|Mark|2017}}\n\nMale nudity was celebrated in [[ancient Greece]] as in no culture before or since. They considered embarrassment at having to disrobe for sports a sign of barbarism.{{sfn|Adams|2005|p=57}} The female nude emerged as a subject for art in the 5th century BCE, illustrating stories of women bathing both indoors and outdoors. While depictions of nude women were erotic in nature, there was no attribution of impropriety as would be the case for such images in later Western culture. However, the passive images reflected the unequal status of women in society compared to the athletic and heroic images of naked men.{{sfn| Kosso| Scott| 2009| pp=61-86}}\n\nThe [[toga]] was essential to announce the status and rank of male [[Roman citizenship|citizens at Rome]].{{sfn|Habinek|Schiesaro|1997|p=39}} The poet [[Ennius]] (c. 239\u2013169&nbsp;BCE) declared, \"exposing naked bodies among citizens is the beginning of public disgrace\". [[Cicero]] endorsed Ennius' words.{{sfn|Cicero|1927|p=[https://www.loebclassics.com/view/marcus_tullius_cicero-tusculan_disputations/1927/pb_LCL141.409.xml 408]}} An exception was the Roman baths ([[thermae]]), which had many social functions.{{sfn|Fagan|2002}}\n[[File:Stamnos women bath Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2411.jpg| thumb| right| 180px| Three young women bathing. Side B from an [[Attica|Attic]] red-figure [[stamnos]], 440\u2013430 BCE.]]\nClothing used in the Middle East, which loosely envelopes the entire body, changed little for centuries. In part, this consistency arises from the fact that such clothing is well-suited for the climate (protecting the body from [[dust storm]]s while also allowing cooling by evaporation).<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> The meaning of the naked body in the societies based upon the [[Abrahamic religions]] ([[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]) was defined by a creation narrative in which [[Adam and Eve]], the [[Protoplast (religion)|first]] [[Adam|man]] and [[Eve|woman]], were naked and unashamed until they ate the [[forbidden fruit]] of the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]]. The philosophical meaning of this myth in terms of stating the source of shame is unclear. The \"[[original sin]]\" did not involve nakedness, but disobedience, yet the first response was to cover their bodies with fig leaves.{{sfn|Velleman|2001}} In all three religions, modesty generally prevails in public, with clothing covering all parts of the body of a sexual nature. The [[Torah]] set forth laws regarding clothing and modesty (''[[tzniut]]'') which also separated Jews from other people in the societies they lived within.{{sfn|Silverman|2013}} \n\nEarly Christians generally inherited the norms of dress from Jewish traditions. However, the [[Adamites]] were an obscure Christian sect in [[North Africa]] originating in the second century who worshiped in the nude, professing to have regained the innocence of Adam.{{sfn|Livingstone|2013}} [[Islamic clothing]] for both men and women is in accordance with the rules of [[hajib]]. For men, clothing covers the area from the waist to the knees. For women, clothing covers the area from the neck to the ankles and also covers the hair. The practice known as [[veil]]ing of women in public predates Islam in [[Iran|Persia]], [[Assyria|Syria]], and [[Anatolia]]. The [[Qur\u02be\u0101n]] provides guidance on the dress of women, but not strict rulings;<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> such rulings may be found in the [[Hadith]]. Originally, veiling applied only to the wives of [[Muhammad]]; however, veiling was adopted by all upper-class women after his death and became a symbol of [[Muslim]] identity.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2013}}\n\nIn stories written in [[Zhou dynasty|China]] as early as the fourth century BCE, nudity is presented as an affront to [[human dignity]], reflecting the belief that \"humanness\" in Chinese society is not innate, but is earned by correct behavior. However, nakedness could also be used by an individual to express contempt for others in their presence. In other stories, the nudity of women, emanating the power of ''[[Yin and yang|yin]]'', could nullify the ''yang'' of aggressive forces.{{sfn|Henry|1999|pp=475\u2013486}} Nudity in mixed-gender public baths was common in [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] before the effects of Western influence, which began in the 19th century and became extensive during the [[Occupation of Japan|American occupation]] after [[World War II]]. The practice continues at a dwindling number of hot springs (''konyoku'') outside of urban areas.{{sfn|Hadfield|2016}} Another Japanese tradition was the women [[free-diver]]s (''[[Ama (diving)|ama]]'') who for 2,000 years until the 1960s collected seaweed and shellfish wearing only loincloths. Their nakedness was not shocking, since women farmers often worked bare-breasted during the summer.{{sfn|Martinez|1995}}\n\n=== Post-classical history ===\nThe late fourth century CE was a period of both of Christian conversion and standardization of church teachings, in particular on matters of sex. Sex outside marriage with a respectable woman injured third parties; her husband, father, and male relatives. Fornication with an unattached woman, likely a prostitute, courtesan or slave, was a lesser sin since it had no male victims, which in a patriarchal society might mean no victim at all.{{sfn|Harper|2012}} The dress or nakedness of women that were not deemed respectable was also of lesser importance.{{sfn|Glancy|2015}}\n\nThe period between the ancient and modern world\u2014approximately 500 to 1450 CE\u2014saw an increasingly stratified society in Europe. At the beginning of the period, everyone other that the upper classes lived in close quarters and did not have the modern sensitivity to private nudity, but slept and bathed together naked with innocence rather than shame. The Roman baths in [[Bath, Somerset]], were rebuilt, and used by both sexes without garments until the 15th century.{{sfn|Byrde|2018}} Sects with beliefs similar to the Adamites, who worshiped naked, emerged in the early 15th century.{{sfn|Lerner|1972}} Later in the period, with the emergence of a middle class, clothing in the form of fashion was a significant indicator of [[social|class]], and thus its lack became a greater source of [[embarrassment]].{{sfn|Classen|2008}}\n\n[[File:Jan Gossaert - Virgin and Child - WGA9771.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Virgin and Child (c. 1530) by [[Jan Gossaert]] ]]\nUntil the beginning of the eighth century, Christians were [[Baptism|baptized]] naked to represent that they emerged from baptism without sin.{{snf|Veyne|1987|p=455}} Although there is a common misconception that Europeans did not bathe in the [[Middle Ages]], public bath houses\u2014usually segregated by sex\u2014were popular until the 16th century, when concern for the spread of disease closed many of them.<ref name=\"Medievalists\" /> In Christian Europe, the parts of the body that were required to be covered in public did not always include the female breasts. In 1350, breasts were associated with nourishment and loving care, but by 1750, artistic representations of the breast were either erotic or medical. This eroticization of the breast coincided with the persecution of women as witches.{{sfn|Miles|Lyon|2008}}\n\nIn the medieval period, Islamic norms became more patriarchal, and very concerned with the chastity of women before marriage and fidelity afterward. Women were not only veiled, but segregated from society, with no contact with men not of close kinship, the presence of whom defined the difference between public and private spaces.{{sfn|Lindsay|2005|p=173}} Of particular concern for both Islam and early Christians, as they extended their control over countries that had previously been part of the Byzantine or Roman empires, was the local custom of public bathing. While Christians were mainly concerned about mixed-gender bathing, which was not uncommon, Islam prohibited nudity for women in the company of non-Muslim women.{{sfn| Kosso| Scott| 2009| pp=171-190}}\n\n=== Modern history ===\n==== Early modern ====\n<!-- About 1500 to 1850, aka the Age of Discovery and Colonialism -->\nThe association of nakedness with shame and anxiety became ambivalent during the [[Renaissance]]. The rediscovered art and writings of [[ancient Greece]] offered an alternative tradition of nudity as symbolic of innocence and purity  which could be understood in terms of the state of man \"[[Fall of man|before the fall]]\". Subsequently, norms and behaviors surrounding nudity in life and in works of art diverged during the modern history of individual societies.{{snf|Barcan|2004a|loc=chpt. 2}}\n\nDue to concerns about the spread of disease, many European public bath houses closed in the 16th century.<ref name=\"Medievalists\" /> By 1750, European artistic representations of the female breast were either erotic or medical.{{sfn|Miles|Lyon|2008}}\n\nThe age of [[colonialism]] was marked by frequent encounters between Christian and Muslim cultures and indigenous peoples of the tropics ([[Nudity#Tropical cultures|see below]]), leading to the [[stereotype]] of the \"naked savage\".{{sfn|Stevens|2003|pp=124\u2013140}}\n\nIn England during the 17th to 19th centuries, the clothing of the poor by Christian charity did not extend to those confined to \"madhouses\" such as [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]], where the inmates were often kept naked and treated harshly.{{sfn|Andrews|2007|pp=131\u2013156}}\n\nThe [[Victorian Era#Morality|Victorian Era]] is often considered to be entirely restrictive of nudity. However, throughout the [[United Kingdom]] in the 19th century, workers in [[Coal mining in the United Kingdom|coal]] [[Coal mining|mine]]s were naked due to the heat and the narrow tunnels that would catch on clothing. Men and boys worked fully naked, while women and girls (usually employed as \"[[Hurrying|hurriers]]\") would generally only strip to the waist (in some locations, they were fully naked as well). Testimony before a Parliamentary labour commission revealed that working naked in confined spaces made \"sexual vices\" a \"common occurrence\".<ref name=\"FordhamU\"/>\n\n==== Late modern ====\nPublic swimming pools in the U.S. were the product of municipal reform movements beginning in the mid-19th century. Civic leaders had not intended pools to be used for recreation, but for health and sporting activities, which were male only. Initially, working class men and boys swam in the nude, as had previously been customary in lakes and rivers.{{sfn|Wiltse|2003}} Communal male nudity in the [[United States]] and other Western countries was not a taboo for much of the 20th century.<ref name=\"HistoricArchive\"/> Males have been more likely than females to be expected to swim nude in swimming pools or to share communal showers in school locker rooms with other members of the same sex.{{sfn|Smithers|1999}} These expectations were based on cultural beliefs that females need more privacy than males do.{{sfn|Senelick|2014}} A 1963 article on a swim program in [[Troy, New York]] stated that boys swam nude, but that girls were expected to wear bathing suits; the writer of the article found nothing remarkable about these requirements.{{sfn|Mann|1963}} The era of nude swimming by boys in municipal pools ended when mixed-gender bathing was allowed.{{sfn|Wiltse|2003}}\n\nIn 1974, an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted an increase in American tolerance for nudity, both at home and in public, approaching that of Europe. However, some traditional nudists at the time decried the trend as encouraging sexual exhibitionism and voyeurism and threatening the viability of private nudist clubs.{{sfn|Sterba|1974}}\n\n=== Traditional cultures ===\nIn tropical regions worldwide complete or near nudity was common for both men and women before contact with [[Western culture]]s or [[Islam]]. Some contemporary societies, particularly in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and the [[Amazon rainforest]], maintain their traditional norms, going about their everyday activities either nude or partially nude. Some [[Nudity#Non-Western societies|developing nations]] have revived precolonial practices.{{sfn|Nkosi|2013}}\n\n{{Gallery\n| title        = Indigenous peoples in tropical climates\n| align        =\n| footer       =\n| style        =\n| state        =\n| height       = \n| width        = 140px\n| captionstyle =\n| File:Four young Masai tribesmen, carrying spears, standing beside Wellcome V0048592.jpg\n| alt1=\n| Four [[Maasai people|Masai]] tribesmen, (c. 1900)\n| File:Bundesarchiv Bild 105-DOA0430, Deutsch-Ostafrika, Einheimische.jpg\n| alt2=\n| Indigenous woman in [[German East Africa]], early 20th century\n| File:Cape Dombey people.jpg\n| alt3=\n| Aboriginal people at Cape Dombey, north of [[Wadeye, Northern Territory|Port Keats]], [[Northern Territory]] (1905)\n| File:Women of all nations, a record of their characteristics, habits, manners, customs and influence; (1908) (14769808302).jpg\n| alt4=\n| [[Fijians|Fijian]] girl (1908).

The report asserted that children have a natural curiosity about their own bodies and the bodies of others that ought to be addressed in an age-appropriate manner. According to the report:\n*Children less than four years old will normally touch their own private parts, look at the private parts of others, and remove their clothes wanting to be naked;\n*Between ages four and six, children will be more actively curious. They will attempt to see others dressing or undressing, or will perhaps \"[[playing doctor|play doctor]]\"; and\n*Between ages six and twelve, children will expand their curiosity to images of undressed people available in the media. They will develop a need for privacy regarding their own bodies and begin to be sexually attracted to peers.\nThe report recommended that parents learn what is normal in regard to nudity and sexuality at each stage of a child's development and refrain from overreacting to their children's nudity-related behaviors unless there are signs of a problem (e.g. anxiety, aggression, or sexual interactions between children not of the same age or stage of development).<ref name=\"NTCSN.2009\"/>\n\nThe naturist/nudist point of view is that children are \"nudists at heart\" and that naturism provides the ideal environment for healthy development. It is noted that modern psychology generally agrees that children can benefit from an open environment where the bodies of others their own age of both sexes are not a mystery. However, there is less agreement regarding children and adults being nude. While some doctors have taken the view that some exposure of children to adult nudity (particularly parental nudity) may be healthy, others\u2014notably [[Benjamin Spock]]\u2014disagreed. Spock's view was later attributed to the lingering effect of [[Freudianism]] on the medical profession.{{sfn|Shantz|2017}}\n\n{{anchor|Nudity and children}}\nIn their 1986 study on the effects of social nudity on children, Smith and Sparks concluded that \"the viewing of the unclothed body, far from being destructive to the psyche, seems to be either benign or to actually provide positive benefits to the individuals involved.{{sfn|Smith|Sparks|1986|p=183}} In 1995, Gordon and Schroeder contended that \"there is nothing inherently wrong with bathing with children or otherwise appearing naked in front of them\", noting that doing so may provide an opportunity for parents to provide important information. They noted that by ages five to six, children begin to develop a sense of modesty, and recommended to parents who desire to be sensitive to their children's wishes that they respect a child's modesty from that age onwards.{{sfn|Gordon|Schroeder|1995|p=16}} \n\nIn a 1995 review of the literature, Paul Okami concluded that there was no reliable evidence linking exposure to parental nudity to any negative effect.{{sfn|Okami|1995|pp=51\u201364}} Three years later, his team finished an 18-year longitudinal study that showed that, if anything, such exposure was associated with slight beneficial effects, particularly for boys.{{sfn|Okami|Olmstead|Abramson|Pendleton|1998|pp=361\u2013384}} \n\nIn 1999, psychologist Barbara Bonner recommended against nudity in the home if children exhibit sexual play of a type that is considered problematic.{{sfn|Bonner|1999|p=211}} In 2019, psychiatrist Lea Lis recommended that parents allow nudity as a natural part of family life when children are very young, but to respect the modesty that is likely to emerge with puberty.{{sfn|Lis|2019}}\n{{Gallery\n| title        = Cultural differences in childhood nudity\n| align        =\n| footer       =\n| style        =\n| state        =\n| height       = 180\n| width        =\n| captionstyle =\n| File:Recreational swim in the Greenbrier river for campers, who are children of miners.

In a subsequent series for teens and young adults, real people were recruited to have sex on tv as counterbalance to the unrealistic presentations in advertising and porn.<ref name=\"CultureTrip.2017\"/>\n\nAs of 2015, however, 37 U.S. states required that sex education curricula include lessons on abstinence and 25 required that a \u201cjust say no\u201d approach be stressed. Studies show that early and complete sex education does not increase the likelihood of becoming sexually active, but leads to better health outcomes overall.{{snf|Zadrozny|2015}} The Netherlands also has open and comprehensive sex education beginning as early as age 4, which similar health outcomes, in addition to promoting social benefits such as gender equality. Young children often play outdoors or in public wading pools nude.{{sfn|Rough|2018}}\n\nIn a 2018 survey of predominantly white middle-class college students in the United States, only 9.98% of women and 7.04% of men reported seeing real people (either adults or other children) as their first childhood experience of nudity. Many were accidental (walking in on someone) and were more likely to be remembered as negative by women. Only 4.72% of women and 2% of men reported seeing nude images as part of sex education. 83.59% of women and 89.45% of men reported that their first image of nudity was in film, video, or other mass media.{{sfn|Allen| Gary| Lavender-Stott| Kaestle|2018}}\n\n====High and low context cultures====\n{{also| Naturism in Germany| Naturism in France}}\nHigh and low context cultures were defined by [[Edward T. Hall]]. The behaviors and norms of a high context culture depend upon shared implicit intuitions that operate within a social situation, while in a low context culture behavior is more dependent upon explicit communications.{{sfn|Hall|1989}} An example of this distinction was found in research on the behavior of French and German naturists on a nude beach. Germans are extremely low in cultural context. They are characterized by individualism, alienation, estrangement from other people, little body contact, low sensitivity to nonverbal cues, and segmentation of time and space. By contrast, the French, in their personal lives are relatively high context: they interact within closely knit groups, are sensitive to nonverbal cues, and engage in relatively high amounts of body contact. To maintain public propriety on a nude beach, German naturists avoided touching themselves and others and avoid any adornments or behaviors that would call attention to the body. French naturists, on the other hand, were more likely than Germans to wear make-up and jewelry and to touch others as they would while dressed.{{sfn|Smith|1980}}\n\n====Concepts of privacy====\nSocieties in [[continental Europe]] conceive of privacy as protecting a right to respect and personal dignity. In America, the right to privacy is oriented toward values of liberty, especially in one's home. While Europeans maintain their dignity, even while naked where others may see them, Americans see public nakedness as a surrender of \"any reasonable [[expectation of privacy]]\". Such cultural differences may make some laws and behaviors of other societies seem incomprehensible.{{sfn|Whitman|2004|p=9}}\n\n==== Gender differences ====\n{{also|Sex differences in humans|Breast#Society and culture}}\nIn Western cultures, shame can result from not living up to the ideals of society with regard to physical appearance. Historically, such shame has affected women more than men. With regard to their naked bodies, the result is a tendency towards self-criticism by women, while men are less concerned by the evaluation of others.{{sfn|Weinberg|Williams|2010}}\n\n[[File:3 Topless Females Sunbathing on a Beach.JPG|thumb|left|In many European counties women may sunbathe without covering their breasts.]]\n\nIn much of the world, the modesty of women is a matter not only of social custom but of the legal definition of [[Indecent exposure#United States|indecent exposure]]. In the United States, the exposure of female nipples is a criminal offense in many states and is not usually allowed in public.{{sfn|Williams|2019}} \n\nThe \"[[topfreedom]]\" movement promotes equal rights for women to be naked above the waist in public on the same basis that would apply to men in the same circumstances.{{sfn|Jensen|2004}}\n\n[[Breastfeeding in public]] is forbidden in some [[jurisdiction]]s, not regulated in others, and protected as a legal right in public and the workplace in still others. Where public breastfeeding is a legal right, some mothers may be reluctant to [[breastfeed]],{{sfn|Wolf|2008|p=11}}{{sfn|Vance|2005|pp=51\u201354}} and some people may object to the practice.{{sfn|Jordan|Pile|2003|p=233}}\n\n=== Imposed nudity ===\n{{also|Pantsing}}\n\n==== Punishment ====\nIn some situations, nudity is forced on a person. For example, imposed nudity (full or partial) can be part of a [[corporal punishment]] or as [[public humiliation|humiliation]], especially when administered in public.\n\nFor example, in 2017, students at a girls' school in the north-east Indian state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] were forced to undress as a form of punishment, police say. Although not as common as [[corporal punishment]], it is not unusual for stripping to be used as a form of punishment in Indian schools.<ref name=\"BBC.2017\"/>\n====Torture====\n[[File:Abu-ghraib-leash.jpg|thumb|180px|One of the iconic photographs of the [[Abu Ghraib]] prison torture scandal: a naked prisoner being forced to crawl and bark like a dog on a leash. ]]\n\n[[Nazism|Nazis]] used forced nudity to attempt to humiliate inmates in [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. This practice was depicted in the film ''[[Schindler's List]]'' (1994).{{sfn|McDonald|Swaak-Goldman|2000|pp=280\u2013283}}\n\nIn 2003, [[Baghdad Central Prison|Abu Ghraib prison]] in [[Baghdad]] ([[Iraq]]) gained international notoriety for accounts of [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|torture and abuses]] by members of the [[United States Army Reserve]] during the [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003\u2013present|post-invasion period]]. Photographic images were circulated that showed the posing of prisoners naked, sometimes bound, and being intimidated and otherwise humiliated, resulting in widespread condemnation of the abuse.<ref name=\"CNN.2004\" />{{sfn|Hoge|2004}}\n\n==== Strip search ====\n{{Main|Strip search}}\nA strip search is the removal of some or all of a person's clothing to insure that they do not have weapons or contraband. Such searches are generally done when an individual is imprisoned after an arrest, and is justified by the need to maintain order in the facility, not as punishment for a crime.<ref name=\"FindLaw\"/>\n\n===Laws regarding public nudity===\n{{Main|Indecent exposure|Clothing laws by country}}\nSince regulation of everyday public behavior is more often a matter of social convention than written law, some jurisdictions may have no specific law against nudity in public. This was the case in 2006, when three young men who had been skinny-dipping outside [[Brattleboro, Vermont]] decided to go into town to see what would happen if they disrobed there. They were not arrested, and the following two summers saw a number of incidents of public nakedness until an ordinance banning nudity was passed.{{sfn|Anand|2008}}\n\nIn the 21st century [[United States]], the legal definition of \"full nudity\" is exposure of the genitals. \"Partial nudity\" includes exposure of the [[buttocks]] by either sex or exposure of the female [[breast]]s.<ref name=\"LawInsider\" /> Legal definitions are further complicated by laws regarding [[indecent exposure]]; this term generally refers to engaging in public nudity with an intent to offend common decency.<ref name=\"Websters\"/> Lewd and indecent behavior is usually defined as causing alarm, discomfort, or annoyance for the average person. Where the law has been challenged by asserting that nudity by itself in not lewd or disorderly, laws have been amended to specify indecent exposure, usually of the genitals but not always of the breast. Public indecency in generally a [[misdemeanor]], but may become a [[felony]] upon repeated offense or always if done in the presence of a minor.{{sfn|Posner|Silbaugh|1996|loc=chpt. 6}} In the State of Oregon, public nudity is legal and protected as free speech as long as there is not an \"intent to arouse\".{{sfn|Hale|2015}} At the other extreme, the State of Arkansas not only outlaws private nudism, but bans anyone from advocating the practice.{{sfn|Posner|Silbaugh|1996|p=85}}\n\nIn the United Kingdom, nudity may not be used to \"harass, alarm or distress\" according to the Public Order Act of 1986.{{sfn|Arfin|2019}} According to a police spokesperson in 2013, nudity per se is not unlawful in the United Kingdom; however, the circumstances surrounding particular episodes of nudity may create public order offenses. Most naturists comply with the law by being nude only where others cannot see them.<ref name=\"BBC.2013\"/> After repeated arrests, prosecutions, and convictions in Great Britain, the activist [[Stephen Gough]] sued at the [[European Court of Human Rights]] for the right to be nude in public outside of designated areas. His claim was ultimately rejected.{{sfn|Shaw|2014}}\n\nThe brief, sudden exposure of parts of the body normally hidden from public view has a long tradition, taking several forms, which may or may not prompt legal action.\n* Flashing refers to the brief public exposure of the genitals or female breasts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=46422|title=Definition of Flashing|website=MedicineNet}}</ref> At [[Mardi Gras]] in [[New Orleans]] flashing\u2014an activity that would be prohibited at any other time and place\u2014has become a ritual of long standing in celebration of [[carnival]]. While many celebrations of carnival worldwide include minimal costumes, the extent of nudity in the [[French Quarter]] is due to its long history as a \"[[red light district]]\". The ritual \"disrobing\" is done in the context of a performance which earns a payment, even though it is only symbolic (glass beads). Although the majority of those performing continue to be women, men (both homosexual and heterosexual) now also participate.{{sfn|Shrum|Kilburn|1996}}\n* [[Mooning]] refers to exposure of the buttocks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://slate.com/culture/2012/06/mooning-a-history-when-did-people-start-baring-their-butts-as-an-insult.html|title=When Did People Start Mooning Each Other?|first=Forrest|last=Wickman|date=27 June 2012|website=Slate Magazine}}</ref>  Mooning opponents in sports or in battle as an insult may have a history going back to ancient Rome.{{sfn|Wickman|2012}}\n* [[Streaking]] refers to running nude through a public area for publicity, as a [[prank]], as a dare, or as a form of [[protest]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/life/stripped-of-inhibitions-486277171.html|title=Jun 2018: Streakers make some events memorable for wrong reasons|first=Doug|last=Speirs|date=23 June 2018|via=www.winnipegfreepress.com|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press}}</ref>\n\n===Morality===\n{{also|Nudity in religion}}\n[[Shame]] is one of the [[moral emotions]] often associated with nudity. While [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] is the emotion experienced in response to a particular wrong action, shame is a more general and long-lasting self-assessment.{{sfn|Uebel|2019}} Shame is often thought of as positive in response to a failure to act in accordance with moral values, thus motivating an individual to do better in the future. However, shame is often negative as the response to perceived failures to live up to unrealistic expectations. The shame regarding nudity is one of the classic examples of the emotion, yet rather than being a positive motivator, it is considered unhealthy, standing in the way of developing a positive self-image.{{sfn|Thomason|2018|loc=chpt. 1}} Others argue that the shame felt when naked in public is due to valuing modesty and privacy as socially positive.{{sfn| Deonna| Rodogno| Teroni| 2012}} However, the response to such public exposure of normally private behavior is called embarrassment (like guilt, also a short-term emotion), rather than shame.{{sfn|Thomason|2018|p=11}}\n\nThe moral ambiguity of nudity is reflected in its many meanings, often expressed in the [[Conceptual metaphor| metaphors]] used to describe cultural values, both positive and negative.{{sfn|Barcan|2004a|pp=77\u201383}} \n\nOne of the first\u2014but now obsolete\u2014meanings of ''nude'' in the 16th century was \"mere, plain, open, explicit\" reflected in the modern metaphors \"the naked truth\", \"the bare facts\". Naturists often speak of their nakedness in terms of a return to the innocence and simplicity of childhood. The term naturism is based upon nakedness as being connected to nature in a positive way; which includes [[egalitarianism]], that all humans are alike in their nakedness. Nudity also represents freedom; the liberation of the body is associated with sexual liberation, although many naturists tend to downplay this connection. In some forms of [[Nude psychotherapy|group psychotherapy]], nudity has been used to promote open interaction and communication. Religious persons who reject the world as it is including all possessions may practice nudism, or use nakedness as a protest against an unjust world.{{sfn|Barcan|2004a|pp=83\u2013106}}\n\nMany of the negative associations are the inverse of positive ones. If nudity is truth, nakedness may be an invasion of privacy or the exposure of uncomfortable truths, a source of anxiety. The strong connection of nudity to sex produces shame when naked in contexts where sexuality is deemed inappropriate. Rather than being natural, nakedness is associated with savagery, poverty, criminality, and death. To be deprived of clothes is punishment; humiliating and degrading.{{sfn|Barcan|2004a|pp=106\u2013138}}\n\nConfronted with this ambiguity, some individuals seek to resolve it by working toward greater acceptance of nudity for themselves and others. The majority of naturists go through stages during which they gradually learn a new set of values regarding the human body.{{sfn|G\u00f3rnicka|2016|}} However, Krista Thomason notes that negative emotions including shame exist because they are functional, and that human beings are not perfect.{{sfn|Thomason|2018|loc=Conclusion}}\n\n=== Protests ===\n{{main article|Nudity and protest}}\n[[File:WNBR London 2012.jpg|thumb|left|People taking part in the [[World Naked Bike Ride]] in London]]\nNudity is used to draw public and attention to a cause, sometimes including the promotion of public nudity itself.{{sfn|Alaimo|2010}}\n\nParticular issues represented include animal rights by the group [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]], environmental issues by the [[World Naked Bike Ride]], women's rights by the organization [[Femen|FEMEN]].\n\n===Sexuality===\n{{main|Nudity and sexuality}}\n{{also|Sexual attraction|Physical attractiveness}}\n\nPersons who practice and advocate personal and social nudity distinguish between ''sexual'' and ''non-sexual'' nudity. Studies of naturism find that its practitioners adopt behaviors and norms that suppress the sexual responses while practicing social nudity.{{sfn|Smith|King|2009|pp=439\u2013446}} Such norms include refraining from staring, touching, or otherwise calling attention to the body while naked.{{sfn|Smith|1980|pp=223\u2013241}} However, some naturists do not maintain this non-sexual atmosphere, as when nudist resorts host sexually oriented events.{{sfn|Silver|1991}}\n\n==Modern social practices==\nNorms related to nudity are associated with norms regarding [[personal freedom]], [[human sexuality]], and [[gender role]]s, which vary widely among modern societies. Situations where nudity is accepted vary. Some people practice nudism within the confines of \"[[nudist camp]]s\" or clothing-optional resorts, while naturists seek more open acceptance of nudity in everyday life and in public spaces.{{sfn|Cooper|2011|pp=326\u2013357}}\n\n===Baths and spas===\n{{also|Sauna}}\nBathing for cleanliness and recreation is a human universal found worldwide, and the communal use of bathing facilities has been maintained in many cultures from varying traditional sources. When there is complete nudity, the facilities are often segregated by sex, but not always.\n\nThe [[sauna]], originating from [[Finland]], is attended nude in its source country{{sfn|Daney|1998}} as well as in most Scandinavian countries and in the German-speaking countries of Europe.{{sfn|Scheuch|2004|pp=156-}} This is true even when a swimsuit must be worn in the swimming pool area of the same complex.{{sfn|Daney|1998}} The trend in some European countries (Germany, Finland and the [[Netherlands]], for instance) is to allow both genders to bathe together naked. For example, the Friedrichsbad in [[Baden-Baden]] has designated times when mixed nude bathing is permitted. Most German (not to mention French, Spanish and Greek) beaches and swimming pools offer [[Freik\u00f6rperkultur|FKK]] (clothing-optional) areas. The German sauna culture also became popular in neighbouring countries such as [[Switzerland]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Luxembourg]].{{efn|{{lang|de|German text: \"Dass M\u00e4nner und Frauen zusammen splitternackt schwitzen, ist eine deutsche Spezialit\u00e4t, f\u00fcr die sich nur noch Urlauber aus den Benelux-Staaten, aus \u00d6sterreich und der Schweiz erw\u00e4rmen k\u00f6nnen, vielleicht auch noch Osteurop\u00e4er\".}}{{sfn|Kast|2014}} English translation: \"The fact that men and women sweat together stark naked is a German specialty that only tourists from the Benelux countries, Austria and Switzerland can warm to, maybe even Eastern Europeans\".}} In contrast to [[Scandinavia]], public sauna facilities in these countries\u2014while nude\u2014do not usually segregate genders.{{efn|{{lang|de|German text: \"In den Fitnesszentren und Kuranstalten wurde das finnische Bad, oft gro\u00dfz\u00fcgig ausgestaltet zu ganzen Saunalandschaften, zum selbstverst\u00e4ndlichen Angebot.

For much of the 20th century, the norm in locker rooms had been for men to undress completely without embarrassment. That norm has changed; in the 21st century, men typically wear towels or other garments in the locker room most of the time and avoid any interaction with others while naked. This shift is the result of changes in social norms regarding masculinity and how maleness is publicly expressed; also, open male nudity has become associated with homosexuality.{{sfn|Miller|2016}} In facilities such as the YMCA that cater to multiple generations, the young are uncomfortable sharing space with older people who do not cover up.{{sfn|Tosches|2012}} The behavior in women's locker rooms and showers also indicates a generational change, younger women covering more, and full nudity being brief and rare, while older women are more open and casual.{{sfn|Goldman|2007}}\n\nBy the 1990s, communal showers in American schools had become \"uncomfortable\", not only because students were accustomed to more privacy at home, but because young people became more self-conscious based upon the comparison to mass media images of perfect bodies.{{sfn|Johnson|1996}} In the 21st century, some high-end New York City gyms were redesigned to cater to [[millennial]]s who want to shower without ever being seen naked.{{sfn|Sicha|2015}} The trend for privacy is being extended to public schools, colleges and community facilities replacing \"gang showers\" and open locker rooms with individual stalls and changing rooms. The change also addresses issues of transgender usage and family use when one parent accompanies children of differing gender.{{sfn|Steinbach|2017}} \n\nThis shift in attitudes has come to societies historically open to nudity. In Denmark, secondary school students are now avoiding showering after gym classes.

In the United States in 2012, the city council of [[San Francisco]], California banned public nudity in the inner-city area.

Nudism originated in opposition to the [[industrialization]] of Europe in the late 19th century.<ref name=\"Grinnell\"/> \n\nNaturists reject contemporary standards of modesty that discourage personal, family and social nudity. They instead seek to create a social environment where individuals feel comfortable being in the company of nude people and being seen nude, either by other naturists or by the general public.{{sfn|Hile|2004}}\n\nNudism spawned a proselytizing literature in the 1920s and 1930s. Nudism's other common name, naturism, signals its core contention that the naked body is natural and that modesty and shame are cultural impositions with deleterious effects on psychological, sexual, and social well-being. Early nudism was in dialogue with sexology and feminism in a critique of society and its future.{{sfn|Barcan|2004b|pp=63-65}} While Christian moralists tended to condemn nudism, other Christians argued for the purity of the nude body compared to the corruption of the scanty clothing of the era.{{sfn|Barcan|2004b|pp=65-66}} Its proponents believed that nudism could combat social inequality, including sexual inequality.{{sfn|Barcan|2004b|pp=67-68}} As a socially marginal practice based on the naturalness of nakedness, nudism has had a complicated relationship with sexuality and pro\u2010sex discourses.{{sfn|Barcan|2015}} \n\nThe social sciences until the middle of the 20th century often studied public nakedness, including naturism, in the context of [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]] or criminality.{{sfn|Barcan|2004a|pp=4\u201310}} However, more recent studies find that naturism has positive effects on body image, self esteem and life satisfaction.{{sfn|West|2018|pp=677\u2013697}} The ''Encyclopedia of Social Deviance'' continues to have an entry on \"Nudism\",{{sfn|Black|2014}} but also defines \"Normal Deviance\" as violating social norms in a positive way, leading to social change.{{sfn|Hasha|Kalish|2014}}\n\n====Nude beaches====\n{{main|Nude beach}}\n{{also|Nude recreation|Nude swimming}}\nA nude beach, sometimes called a clothing-optional or free beach, is a [[beach]] where users are at liberty to be nude.

Nude beaches may be official (legally sanctioned), unofficial (tolerated by residents and law enforcement), or illegal but so isolated as to escape enforcement.\n\n==== Arts-related activities ====\nDistinct from the [[nudity#Depictions of nudity|nude artworks]] created, sessions where artists, both amateur and professional, work from live models are a social situation where nudity has a long tradition. The role of the model both as part of visual art education and in the creation of finished works has evolved since antiquity in Western societies and worldwide wherever western cultural practices in the visual arts have been adopted. At modern universities, art schools, and community groups \"[[Model (art)|art model]]\" is a job, one requirement of which is to pose \"undraped\" and motionless for minutes, hours (with breaks) or days as the artwork requires.{{sfn| Steinhart|2004}}\n\nPhotography of groups of nude people in public places has been done around the world with or without official cooperation. The gathering itself is proposed as performance art, while the resulting images become statements based upon the identities of people invited to participate by posing, and the location selected; urban, scenic landscapes, or sites of historical significance. The photographers state a variety of artistic, cultural, and political reasons for their work, while those being photographed may be professional models or unpaid volunteers attracted to the project for personal reasons.\n\n*[[Spencer Tunick]] has been photographing his \"installations\" since 1994, often in urban spaces but also in landscapes. The number of participants has also varied, growing from hundreds to thousands of volunteers.<ref name=\"ArtNet.Tunick\"/>\n*San Francisco Bay area photographer Jack Gescheidt<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jackphoto.com/|title=Jack Gescheidt photographer|author=|date=|website=www.jackphoto.com|accessdate=6 July 2017}}</ref> stages events as part of an ongoing series, called \"The Tree Spirit Project\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treespiritproject.com/|title=TreeSpirit Project \u2013 Raising awareness of the critical role of trees in our lives.|author=|date=|website=www.treespiritproject.com|accessdate=6 July 2017}}</ref>\n*Photographer [[Henning von Berg]] photographs naked people in public urban locations around the globe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.henning-von-berg.com/about/2 |title=Henning von Berg: About 2 |website=Henning-von-berg.com|accessdate=2019-12-19}}</ref> One of the locations was the [[Reichstag building]] in [[Berlin]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.henning-von-berg.com/about/1 |title=Henning von Berg: About 1 |website=Henning-von-berg.com | accessdate=2019-12-19}}</ref>\n\n==Depictions of nudity==\n{{main|Depictions of nudity}}\n{{also|Nudity in film| Nudity in American television}}\n[[File:Pioneer plaque humans.svg|thumb|left|180px|Images of a man and woman attached to [[Pioneer 10]] as part of a message to any extra-terrestrial intelligence the [[space probe]] might encounter.]]\nIn a picture-making civilization, pictorial conventions continually reaffirm what is natural in human appearance, which is part of [[socialization]].{{sfn|Hollander|1978}}\n\nIn Western societies, the contexts for depictions of nudity include [[information]], [[art]] and [[pornography]]. Any ambiguous image not easily fitting into one of these categories may be misinterpreted, leading to disputes.{{sfn|Eck|2001}} The nude in photography includes [[Nude photography|scientific, commercial]], [[Nude photography (art)|fine art]], and [[erotic photography]].{{sfn|Rasmus|2011}}\n\n===Indecency and obscenity===\nLimits of the depiction of nudity are based upon the legal definitions of indecency and [[obscenity]].\nIn 1973, the Supreme Court in ''[[Miller v. California]]'' established the three-tiered [[Miller test]] to determine what was obscene (and thus not protected) versus what was merely erotic and thus protected by the First Amendment.{{sfn|Rasmus|2011}}\n\n[[Depictions of child nudity]] (or of children with nude adults) appear in [[work of art|works of art]] in various cultures and historical periods. These attitudes have changed over time and have become increasingly frowned upon,{{sfn|Higonnet|1998|p=}} especially in the case of photography. In recent years, snapshots taken by parents of their nude infant or toddler children were challenged as [[child pornography]].{{sfn|Kincaid|2000}}\n \n[[File:Venus von Willendorf 01.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The [[Venus of Willendorf]] made between 24,000 and 22,000 BCE.]]\n\n===Art===\n{{main| Nude (art)}}\nThe nude human figure has been one of subjects of art from its [[Paleolithic]] beginnings, and a major preoccupation of Western art since the ancient Greeks. In \"The Nude: a Study in Ideal Form\", Lord [[Kenneth Clark]] states that to be naked is to be deprived of clothes, and implies embarrassment and shame, while a nude, as a work of art, has no such connotations.{{sfn|Clark|1956|loc=chpt. 1}} This separation of the artistic form from the related social and cultural issues was largely unexamined by classical art historians, but became a focus of social and feminist critiques in the 1970s, when classical nudes of women were seen as symbolic of male objectification of female bodies.{{sfn|Berger|1972}}{{sfn|Mulvey|1975}} The debate over [[objectification]] has continued, recently energized by the #[[MeToo]] movement.{{sfn|Slenske|Langmuir|2018}}\n\n==Performance==\nNudity may be used as a part of live performances, such as dance, theater, [[Performance art#1960s|performance art]] and nude [[body painting]].<!--Summary of content below-->\n===Dance===\n[[Dance]], as a sequence of human movement, may be [[Ceremonial dance|ceremonial]], [[Social dance|social]] or one of the [[performing arts]]. Partial or complete nudity is a feature of ceremonial dances in some tropical countries. However, some claim that modern practices may be used to promote \"ethnic tourism\" rather than to revive authentic traditions.{{sfn|Firenzi|2012}} In Western traditions, dance costumes have evolved towards providing more freedom of movement and revealing more of the body; complete nakedness is the culmination of this process.{{sfn|Sparshott|1995}} Modern choreographers consider nudity one of the possible \"costumes\" available for dance, some seeing nudity as expressing deeper human qualities through dance which works against the [[sexual objectification]] of the body in commercial culture.{{sfn|Cappelle|Whittenburg|2014}} While nudity in social dance is not common, events such as \"Naked Tango\" have been held in Germany.{{sfn|Nethers|2013}}\n\n===Theater===\nA well-known performance that included nudity was the Broadway musical [[Hair (musical)#Nude scene|Hair]] in 1968.{{sfn|Libbey|2018}} The New York Times printed a number of letters to the editor in 1969 with opinions ranging from actress [[June Havoc]] stating that nudity indicates that the producer has run out of ideas; while actress [[Shelley Winters]] joked that it was disgusting, but if she were 22 she would do it.{{sfn|NY Times Editorial|1969}}\n\n===Erotic performances===\n{{also|Striptease|Sex show}}\nModels posing on stage nude was a feature of ''[[Tableau vivant|tableaux vivants]]'' at London's [[Windmill Theatre]] and New York's [[Ziegfeld Follies]] in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Chapman|2018}}{{sfn|Bloom|2013}} English law did not allow nude actresses to move on stage, but allowed them stand motionless to imitate works of art.{{sfn|Jacobs|2012}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Human sexuality|Nudity}}\n*[[Nudity in combat]]\n*[[Nude recreation]]\n*[[Anarcho-naturism]]\n*[[List of places where social nudity is practised]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"wikt\">{{Wiktionary-inline}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Spiegel2006\">{{cite news | title=Baring It All: Get Naked with the Germans | newspaper=Spiegel Online | date=10 May 2006 | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/baring-it-all-get-naked-with-the-germans-a-415516.html | accessdate=13 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"CNN.2004\">{{Cite web |title=CNN.com \u2013 Iraq prison 'abuse' sparks outrage |author= |work=CNN.com |date=April 30, 2004 |access-date=November 8, 2019 |url= https://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/04/30/iraq.photos.reaction/index.html |language= |quote=}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"FCN1999\">{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205145214/http://www.fcn.ca/about-naturism/information-and-references/survey-on-naturism-in-canada?start=1|date=5 December 2013|title=1999 National Survey on Canadian Attitudes Towards Nudity}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ABCSexSurvey2004\">{{citation|url=http://abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/959a1AmericanSexSurvey.pdf|title=The American Sex Survey: A Peek Beneath the Sheets|page=26|publisher=abcnews|date=21 October 2004|accessdate=2009-09-04}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"TCS\">{{citation|title=The Clothes Show |title-link=The Clothes Show|date= May 1996|publisher= [[BBC]] }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Medievalists\">{{cite web| website=Medievalists.net| date=April 13, 2013| title=Did people in the Middle Ages take baths?| accessdate=October 27, 2019| url=https://www.medievalists.net/2013/04/did-people-in-the-middle-ages-take-baths/}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"LawInsider\">{{cite web| url=https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/partial-nudity| title=Definition of Partial nudity| website=Law Insider| accessdate=October 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Japan\">{{cite web| url=https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2074.html| website= Japan Guide| title=Public Baths in Japan| accessdate=October 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"omovalleytribaltours\">{{cite web| url=http://omovalleytribaltours.com/index.php/stick-fight/| title=Stick Fight| accessdate=October 31, 2019|website=Omo Valley Tribal Tours}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"HistoricArchive\">{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/historicarchives4maleswimming/| title=Historic Archive \u2013 Male Nude Swimming| accessdate=November 8, 2019| website=Historical Archives \u2013 Male Nude Swimming}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"FordhamU\">{{cite web| url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/1842womenminers.asp| website=Fordham University| title=Modern History Sourcebook: Women Miners in English Coal Pits| accessdate=November 9, 2019}}</ref>\n<!-- Not currently used:\n<ref name=\"Aquinnah\">{{cite web| url=http://www.gomarthasvineyard.com/island/beach/gay-head-beach| website=gomarthasvineyard| title=Gay Head Beach| accessdate=November 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Haulover\">{{cite web| website=Haulover Beach| title=Haulover Beach| url=https://www.hauloverbeach.org/| accessdate=November 10, 2019}}</ref>\n-->\n<ref name=\"FindLaw\">{{cite web| website=FindLaw| title=Strip Search After an Arrest| url=https://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-rights/strip-search-after-an-arrest.html| accessdate=November 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BBC.2017\">{{cite web| website=BBC| title=Inquiry after India students 'stripped for punishment'| url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-42180151| date=30 November 2017| accessdate=November 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Websters\">{{cite web |title=Indecent Exposure| website=Merriam-Webster's Legal Dictionary| url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/indecent%20exposure#legalDictionary |accessdate=November 12, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Websters.nude\">{{cite web |title=Nude| website=Merriam-Webster's Dictionary| url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nude |accessdate=November 13, 2019 | quote=Synonyms, Adjective: au naturel, bare, bottomless, disrobed, mother-naked, naked, raw, starkers [chiefly British], stripped, unclad, unclothed, undressed;

which a [[human]] is not wearing [[clothing]] or specifically is not covering the [[genitals]].<ref name=\"wikt\" /> In some societies, partial nudity is defined as not covering other parts of the body that are deemed to be sexual.\n\n'''Nakedness''', or the loss of body fur, was one of the physical characteristics that marked the evolution of anatomically modern humans from their [[hominini]] ancestors. For many thousands of years, humans wore no clothing, which continues to be the norm in some isolated indigenous societies in tropical climates. The widespread adoption of clothing only occurred as people migrated to other climates which required protection from the elements. As societies developed from being [[hunter-gatherer]]s to being agrarian, clothing became part of cultural evolution as individuals and groups became differentiated by status and class. In early civilizations such as Egypt, slaves, children, and others with lower status often continued to be naked.\n\nThe modern understanding of nudity is culturally complex due to different meanings given various states of undress in differing social situations. In any particular society, nudity is defined in relation to being properly dressed, not in relation to the specific body parts being exposed. For humans, nakedness and clothing are connected to many [[Culture|cultural categories]] such as [[Identity (social science)|identity]], [[privacy]], [[social status]] and [[Morality|moral behavior]].{{sfn|Barcan|2004a|loc=Introduction}} Synonyms and euphemisms for nudity abound, including \"birthday suit\", \"in the altogether\" and \"in the buff\". \"In a [[state of nature]]\" is also used by philosophers to refer to the state of humans before the existence of organized societies.<ref name=\"Websters.nude\"/>\n\nIn [[Western world|Western societies]], there are two contradictory cultural traditions relating to nudity. The first comes from the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], who saw the naked body as the natural state and as essentially positive. The second is based upon the [[Abrahamic religions]], which have viewed being naked as shameful and essentially negative. The fundamental teachings of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam prohibit public, and sometimes also private nudity. However, the interaction between the Greek classical and later traditions has resulted in Western ambivalence, with nudity representing both positive and negative meanings in individual psychology, in social life, and in depictions such as art.{{sfn|Barcan|2004a|pp=11\u201315}} In the late 19th century, organized groups of nudists or naturists emerged with the stated purpose of regaining a natural connection to the human body and nature, sometimes in private spaces but also in public.\n\nIn Africa, there is a sharp contrast between the attitude toward nudity in Islamic countries and the attitude toward nudity in certain [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan countries]] that never abandoned, or are reasserting, precolonial norms.\n\nIn Asia, the norms regarding public nudity are in keeping with the cultural values of social propriety and human dignity. Rather than being perceived as immoral or shameful, nakedness is perceived as a breach of [[etiquette]] and perhaps as an embarrassment. In China, [[Face (sociological concept)|saving face]] is a powerful social force. In Japan, proper behavior included a tradition of mixed gender public baths before Western contact began in the 19th century, and proper attire for farmers and other workers might be a loincloth for both men and women. In India, the conventions regarding proper dress do not apply to monks in some Hindu and Jain sects who reject clothing as worldly.\n\nSocieties use clothing (or the lack thereof) as a marker of social status. Generally, social norms regarding nudity are different for men than they are for women. It was not until the 17th century in Europe that the female breast became a part of the body that must be covered in public. It is only in the modern era that the nudity of children represented anything but innocence. Individuals may intentionally violate norms regarding nudity; those without power may use nudity as a form of protest, and those with power may impose nakedness on others as a form of punishment.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of nudity}}\n<!--Opening of main article and summary of what follows -->\nThe history of nudity involves social attitudes to nakedness of the human body in different cultures in history. The use of clothing is one of the changes that mark the end of the [[Neolithic]] and the beginning of civilization.\n=== Prehistory ===\n<!--Defined as period before recorded history-->\n==== Evolution of hairlessness ====\n{{main|Human evolution}}\nThe dissipation of body heat remains the most widely accepted evolutionary explanation for the loss of body hair in early members of the genus [[homo]], the surviving member of which is modern humans.{{sfn|Kushlan|1980}}{{sfn|Wheeler|1985}}{{sfn|Sutou|2012}} Less hair, and an increase in sweat glands, made it easier for their bodies to cool when they moved from shady [[forest]] to open [[savanna]]. This change in environment also resulted in a change in diet, from largely vegetarian to hunting. Pursuing game on the savanna also increased the need for regulation of body heat.{{sfn|Daley|2018}}  Anthropologist and palaeobiologist [[Nina Jablonski]] posits that the ability to dissipate excess body heat through [[Eccrine sweat gland|eccrine sweating]] helped make possible the dramatic enlargement of the brain, the most temperature-sensitive human organ.{{sfn|Jablonski|2012}} Thus the loss of fur was also a factor in further adaptions, both physical and behavioral, that differentiated humans from other primates. Some of these changes are thought to be the result of sexual selection, which was first proposed by Darwin in [[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]. By selecting more hairless mates, humans accelerated changes initiated by natural selection. Sexual selection may also account for the remaining human hair in the pubic area and armpits, which are sites for pheromones, while hair on the head continued to provide protection from the sun.{{sfn|Wade|2003}}\n\nA divergent explanation of humans' relative hairlessness holds that ecroparasites (such as ticks) residing in fur became problematic as humans became hunters living in larger groups with a \"home base\". Nakedness would also make the lack of parasites apparent to prospective mates.{{sfn|Rantala|2007|pp=1\u20137}}\n\nThe last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees was only partially bipedal, often using their front legs for locomotion. Other primate mothers do not need to carry their young because there is fur for them to cling to, but the loss of fur encouraged full bipedalism, allowing the mothers to carry their babies with one or both hands. The combination of hairlessness and upright posture may also explain the enlargement of the female breasts as a sexual signal.{{sfn|Sutou|2012}}\n\nWith the loss of fur, darker, high-melanin skin evolved as a protection from ultraviolet radiation damage. As humans migrated outside of the tropics, varying degrees of depigmentation evolved in order to permit UVB-induced synthesis of previtamin D<sub>3</sub>.{{sfn|Jablonski|Chaplin|2000|pp=57\u2013106}}{{sfn|Jablonski|Chaplin|2017}}\n\n==== Origin of clothing ====\n{{main|History of clothing and textiles}}\nThe wearing of clothing is most likely a behavioral [[adaptation]] arising from the need for protection from the elements, including the sun (for depigmented human populations) and cold temperatures as humans migrated to colder regions. According to a 2010 study published in ''Molecular Biology and Evolution'', estimates of the origins of clothing are based upon a genetic analysis indicating that clothing lice diverged from head louse ancestors at some point in time between 83,000 years ago and 170,000 years ago; this information suggests that the use of clothing likely originated with anatomically modern humans in Africa prior to their migration to colder climates.{{sfn| Toups| Kitchen| Light| Reed| 2010| pp=29\u201332}} A 2017 study published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' estimated that anatomically modern humans evolved 260,000 to 350,000 years ago.{{sfn| Schlebusch| 2017}} \n\nThe complex garments needed for survival in extreme cold would have required invention of the tools for turning animal skins into clothes: scrapers for cleaning and smoothing, fine stone knives for cutting and bone needles for stitching.{{sfn|Gilligan|2010}} What is now called clothing may have originated along with other types of adornment, including [[jewelry]], [[body paint]], [[tattoo]]s, and other [[body modification]]s, \"dressing\" the naked body without concealing it.{{sfn|Hollander|1978|p=83}} According to Leary and Buttermore, body adornment is one of the changes that occurred in the late [[Paleolithic]] (40,000 to 60,000 years ago) in which humans became not only anatomically modern, but also [[Behavioral modernity|culturally and psychologically modern]] and capable of self-reflection and symbolic interaction.{{sfn|Leary|Buttermore|2003}}\n\n=== Ancient history ===\n<!--Defined as period from beginning of recorded history to the end of the classical period, about 3000 BCE to 500 CE. Preliterate societies, unless mentioned in written history (usually as savages and barbarians), are not part of history.-->\n[[File:Fetekti3c.jpg| thumb| left| 240px| Scenes painted on white plaster, Fifth Dynasty (approx. 2500\u20132300 BCE), [[Abusir]] necropolis, [[Egypt]]]]\nIn ancient [[Mesopotamia]], most people owned a single item of clothing, and being naked meant being at the bottom of the social scale, lacking in dignity and status.{{sfn|Batten|2010}}\n\nFor the average person, clothing changed little in [[ancient Egypt]] from the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]], (3150\u20132686 BCE) until the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (2055\u20131650 BCE). Although the genitals of adults were generally covered, nakedness in ancient Egypt was not a violation of any social norm, but more often a convention indicating wealth; those that could afford to do so covered more.{{sfn|Mertz|1990|p=75}} Both men and women wore skirts called ''schenti''\u2014which evolved from [[loincloth]]s and resembled modern kilts. Slaves and laborers were nude or wore loincloths. Only women of the upper classes wore  ''[[kalasiris]]'', a dress of loose draped or translucent linen which came from just above or below the breasts to the ankles.{{sfn|Mark|2017}} Women entertainers performed naked. Children went without clothing until [[puberty]], at about age 12.{{sfn|Altenm\u00fcller|1998|pp=406\u20137}} It was not until the later periods, in particular the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] (1550\u20131069 BCE), that functionaries in the households of the wealthy also began wearing more refined dress, and upper class women wore elaborate dresses and ornamentation which covered their breasts. These later styles are often shown in film and TV as representing ancient Egypt in all periods.{{sfn|Mark|2017}}\n\nMale nudity was celebrated in [[ancient Greece]] as in no culture before or since. They considered embarrassment at having to disrobe for sports a sign of barbarism.{{sfn|Adams|2005|p=57}} The female nude emerged as a subject for art in the 5th century BCE, illustrating stories of women bathing both indoors and outdoors. While depictions of nude women were erotic in nature, there was no attribution of impropriety as would be the case for such images in later Western culture. However, the passive images reflected the unequal status of women in society compared to the athletic and heroic images of naked men.{{sfn| Kosso| Scott| 2009| pp=61-86}}\n\nThe [[toga]] was essential to announce the status and rank of male [[Roman citizenship|citizens at Rome]].{{sfn|Habinek|Schiesaro|1997|p=39}} The poet [[Ennius]] (c. 239\u2013169&nbsp;BCE) declared, \"exposing naked bodies among citizens is the beginning of public disgrace\". [[Cicero]] endorsed Ennius' words.{{sfn|Cicero|1927|p=[https://www.loebclassics.com/view/marcus_tullius_cicero-tusculan_disputations/1927/pb_LCL141.409.xml 408]}} An exception was the Roman baths ([[thermae]]), which had many social functions.{{sfn|Fagan|2002}}\n[[File:Stamnos women bath Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2411.jpg| thumb| right| 180px| Three young women bathing. Side B from an [[Attica|Attic]] red-figure [[stamnos]], 440\u2013430 BCE.]]\nClothing used in the Middle East, which loosely envelopes the entire body, changed little for centuries. In part, this consistency arises from the fact that such clothing is well-suited for the climate (protecting the body from [[dust storm]]s while also allowing cooling by evaporation).<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> The meaning of the naked body in the societies based upon the [[Abrahamic religions]] ([[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]) was defined by a creation narrative in which [[Adam and Eve]], the [[Protoplast (religion)|first]] [[Adam|man]] and [[Eve|woman]], were naked and unashamed until they ate the [[forbidden fruit]] of the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]]. The philosophical meaning of this myth in terms of stating the source of shame is unclear. The \"[[original sin]]\" did not involve nakedness, but disobedience, yet the first response was to cover their bodies with fig leaves.{{sfn|Velleman|2001}} In all three religions, modesty generally prevails in public, with clothing covering all parts of the body of a sexual nature. The [[Torah]] set forth laws regarding clothing and modesty (''[[tzniut]]'') which also separated Jews from other people in the societies they lived within.{{sfn|Silverman|2013}} \n\nEarly Christians generally inherited the norms of dress from Jewish traditions. However, the [[Adamites]] were an obscure Christian sect in [[North Africa]] originating in the second century who worshiped in the nude, professing to have regained the innocence of Adam.{{sfn|Livingstone|2013}} [[Islamic clothing]] for both men and women is in accordance with the rules of [[hajib]]. For men, clothing covers the area from the waist to the knees. For women, clothing covers the area from the neck to the ankles and also covers the hair. The practice known as [[veil]]ing of women in public predates Islam in [[Iran|Persia]], [[Assyria|Syria]], and [[Anatolia]]. The [[Qur\u02be\u0101n]] provides guidance on the dress of women, but not strict rulings;<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> such rulings may be found in the [[Hadith]]. Originally, veiling applied only to the wives of [[Muhammad]]; however, veiling was adopted by all upper-class women after his death and became a symbol of [[Muslim]] identity.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2013}}\n\nIn stories written in [[Zhou dynasty|China]] as early as the fourth century BCE, nudity is presented as an affront to [[human dignity]], reflecting the belief that \"humanness\" in Chinese society is not innate, but is earned by correct behavior. However, nakedness could also be used by an individual to express contempt for others in their presence. In other stories, the nudity of women, emanating the power of ''[[Yin and yang|yin]]'', could nullify the ''yang'' of aggressive forces.{{sfn|Henry|1999|pp=475\u2013486}} Nudity in mixed-gender public baths was common in [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] before the effects of Western influence, which began in the 19th century and became extensive during the [[Occupation of Japan|American occupation]] after [[World War II]]. The practice continues at a dwindling number of hot springs (''konyoku'') outside of urban areas.{{sfn|Hadfield|2016}} Another Japanese tradition was the women [[free-diver]]s (''[[Ama (diving)|ama]]'') who for 2,000 years until the 1960s collected seaweed and shellfish wearing only loincloths. Their nakedness was not shocking, since women farmers often worked bare-breasted during the summer.{{sfn|Martinez|1995}}\n\n=== Post-classical history ===\nThe late fourth century CE was a period of both of Christian conversion and standardization of church teachings, in particular on matters of sex. Sex outside marriage with a respectable woman injured third parties; her husband, father, and male relatives. Fornication with an unattached woman, likely a prostitute, courtesan or slave, was a lesser sin since it had no male victims, which in a patriarchal society might mean no victim at all.{{sfn|Harper|2012}} The dress or nakedness of women that were not deemed respectable was also of lesser importance.{{sfn|Glancy|2015}}\n\nThe period between the ancient and modern world\u2014approximately 500 to 1450 CE\u2014saw an increasingly stratified society in Europe. At the beginning of the period, everyone other that the upper classes lived in close quarters and did not have the modern sensitivity to private nudity, but slept and bathed together naked with innocence rather than shame. The Roman baths in [[Bath, Somerset]], were rebuilt, and used by both sexes without garments until the 15th century.{{sfn|Byrde|2018}} Sects with beliefs similar to the Adamites, who worshiped naked, emerged in the early 15th century.{{sfn|Lerner|1972}} Later in the period, with the emergence of a middle class, clothing in the form of fashion was a significant indicator of [[social|class]], and thus its lack became a greater source of [[embarrassment]].{{sfn|Classen|2008}}\n\n[[File:Jan Gossaert - Virgin and Child - WGA9771.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Virgin and Child (c. 1530) by [[Jan Gossaert]] ]]\nUntil the beginning of the eighth century, Christians were [[Baptism|baptized]] naked to represent that they emerged from baptism without sin.{{snf|Veyne|1987|p=455}} Although there is a common misconception that Europeans did not bathe in the [[Middle Ages]], public bath houses\u2014usually segregated by sex\u2014were popular until the 16th century, when concern for the spread of disease closed many of them.<ref name=\"Medievalists\" /> In Christian Europe, the parts of the body that were required to be covered in public did not always include the female breasts. In 1350, breasts were associated with nourishment and loving care, but by 1750, artistic representations of the breast were either erotic or medical. This eroticization of the breast coincided with the persecution of women as witches.{{sfn|Miles|Lyon|2008}}\n\nIn the medieval period, Islamic norms became more patriarchal, and very concerned with the chastity of women before marriage and fidelity afterward. Women were not only veiled, but segregated from society, with no contact with men not of close kinship, the presence of whom defined the difference between public and private spaces.{{sfn|Lindsay|2005|p=173}} Of particular concern for both Islam and early Christians, as they extended their control over countries that had previously been part of the Byzantine or Roman empires, was the local custom of public bathing. While Christians were mainly concerned about mixed-gender bathing, which was not uncommon, Islam prohibited nudity for women in the company of non-Muslim women.{{sfn| Kosso| Scott| 2009| pp=171-190}}\n\n=== Modern history ===\n==== Early modern ====\n<!-- About 1500 to 1850, aka the Age of Discovery and Colonialism -->\nThe association of nakedness with shame and anxiety became ambivalent during the [[Renaissance]]. The rediscovered art and writings of [[ancient Greece]] offered an alternative tradition of nudity as symbolic of innocence and purity  which could be understood in terms of the state of man \"[[Fall of man|before the fall]]\". Subsequently, norms and behaviors surrounding nudity in life and in works of art diverged during the modern history of individual societies.{{snf|Barcan|2004a|loc=chpt. 2}}\n\nDue to concerns about the spread of disease, many European public bath houses closed in the 16th century.<ref name=\"Medievalists\" /> By 1750, European artistic representations of the female breast were either erotic or medical.{{sfn|Miles|Lyon|2008}}\n\nThe age of [[colonialism]] was marked by frequent encounters between Christian and Muslim cultures and indigenous peoples of the tropics ([[Nudity#Tropical cultures|see below]]), leading to the [[stereotype]] of the \"naked savage\".{{sfn|Stevens|2003|pp=124\u2013140}}\n\nIn England during the 17th to 19th centuries, the clothing of the poor by Christian charity did not extend to those confined to \"madhouses\" such as [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]], where the inmates were often kept naked and treated harshly.{{sfn|Andrews|2007|pp=131\u2013156}}\n\nThe [[Victorian Era#Morality|Victorian Era]] is often considered to be entirely restrictive of nudity. However, throughout the [[United Kingdom]] in the 19th century, workers in [[Coal mining in the United Kingdom|coal]] [[Coal mining|mine]]s were naked due to the heat and the narrow tunnels that would catch on clothing. Men and boys worked fully naked, while women and girls (usually employed as \"[[Hurrying|hurriers]]\") would generally only strip to the waist (in some locations, they were fully naked as well). Testimony before a Parliamentary labour commission revealed that working naked in confined spaces made \"sexual vices\" a \"common occurrence\".<ref name=\"FordhamU\"/>\n\n==== Late modern ====\nPublic swimming pools in the U.S. were the product of municipal reform movements beginning in the mid-19th century. Civic leaders had not intended pools to be used for recreation, but for health and sporting activities, which were male only. Initially, working class men and boys swam in the nude, as had previously been customary in lakes and rivers.{{sfn|Wiltse|2003}} Communal male nudity in the [[United States]] and other Western countries was not a taboo for much of the 20th century.<ref name=\"HistoricArchive\"/> Males have been more likely than females to be expected to swim nude in swimming pools or to share communal showers in school locker rooms with other members of the same sex.{{sfn|Smithers|1999}} These expectations were based on cultural beliefs that females need more privacy than males do.{{sfn|Senelick|2014}} A 1963 article on a swim program in [[Troy, New York]] stated that boys swam nude, but that girls were expected to wear bathing suits; the writer of the article found nothing remarkable about these requirements.{{sfn|Mann|1963}} The era of nude swimming by boys in municipal pools ended when mixed-gender bathing was allowed.{{sfn|Wiltse|2003}}\n\nIn 1974, an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted an increase in American tolerance for nudity, both at home and in public, approaching that of Europe. However, some traditional nudists at the time decried the trend as encouraging sexual exhibitionism and voyeurism and threatening the viability of private nudist clubs.{{sfn|Sterba|1974}}\n\n=== Traditional cultures ===\nIn tropical regions worldwide complete or near nudity was common for both men and women before contact with [[Western culture]]s or [[Islam]]. Some contemporary societies, particularly in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and the [[Amazon rainforest]], maintain their traditional norms, going about their everyday activities either nude or partially nude.

The report asserted that children have a natural curiosity about their own bodies and the bodies of others that ought to be addressed in an age-appropriate manner. According to the report:\n*Children less than four years old will normally touch their own private parts, look at the private parts of others, and remove their clothes wanting to be naked;\n*Between ages four and six, children will be more actively curious. They will attempt to see others dressing or undressing, or will perhaps \"[[playing doctor|play doctor]]\"; and\n*Between ages six and twelve, children will expand their curiosity to images of undressed people available in the media. They will develop a need for privacy regarding their own bodies and begin to be sexually attracted to peers.\nThe report recommended that parents learn what is normal in regard to nudity and sexuality at each stage of a child's development and refrain from overreacting to their children's nudity-related behaviors unless there are signs of a problem (e.g. anxiety, aggression, or sexual interactions between children not of the same age or stage of development).<ref name=\"NTCSN.2009\"/>\n\nThe naturist/nudist point of view is that children are \"nudists at heart\" and that naturism provides the ideal environment for healthy development. It is noted that modern psychology generally agrees that children can benefit from an open environment where the bodies of others their own age of both sexes are not a mystery. However, there is less agreement regarding children and adults being nude. While some doctors have taken the view that some exposure of children to adult nudity (particularly parental nudity) may be healthy, others\u2014notably [[Benjamin Spock]]\u2014disagreed. Spock's view was later attributed to the lingering effect of [[Freudianism]] on the medical profession.{{sfn|Shantz|2017}}\n\n{{anchor|Nudity and children}}\nIn their 1986 study on the effects of social nudity on children, Smith and Sparks concluded that \"the viewing of the unclothed body, far from being destructive to the psyche, seems to be either benign or to actually provide positive benefits to the individuals involved.{{sfn|Smith|Sparks|1986|p=183}} In 1995, Gordon and Schroeder contended that \"there is nothing inherently wrong with bathing with children or otherwise appearing naked in front of them\", noting that doing so may provide an opportunity for parents to provide important information. They noted that by ages five to six, children begin to develop a sense of modesty, and recommended to parents who desire to be sensitive to their children's wishes that they respect a child's modesty from that age onwards.{{sfn|Gordon|Schroeder|1995|p=16}} \n\nIn a 1995 review of the literature, Paul Okami concluded that there was no reliable evidence linking exposure to parental nudity to any negative effect.{{sfn|Okami|1995|pp=51\u201364}} Three years later, his team finished an 18-year longitudinal study that showed that, if anything, such exposure was associated with slight beneficial effects, particularly for boys.{{sfn|Okami|Olmstead|Abramson|Pendleton|1998|pp=361\u2013384}} \n\nIn 1999, psychologist Barbara Bonner recommended against nudity in the home if children exhibit sexual play of a type that is considered problematic.{{sfn|Bonner|1999|p=211}} In 2019, psychiatrist Lea Lis recommended that parents allow nudity as a natural part of family life when children are very young, but to respect the modesty that is likely to emerge with puberty.{{sfn|Lis|2019}}\n{{Gallery\n| title        = Cultural differences in childhood nudity\n| align        =\n| footer       =\n| style        =\n| state        =\n| height       = 180\n| width        =\n| captionstyle =\n| File:Recreational swim in the Greenbrier river for campers, who are children of miners.

The Culture Minister defended the book's being available for parents, and supported libraries that were under attack.{{sfn|Marosevic|2014}}\n\nAs part of a science program on Norwegian public television ([[NRK]]), a series on [[puberty]] intended for 8\u201312 year olds includes explicit information and images of reproduction, anatomy, and the changes that are normal with the approach of puberty. Rather than diagrams or photos, the videos are shot in a locker room with live nude people of all ages. The presenter, a physician, is relaxed about close examination and touching of relevant body parts, including genitals. While the videos note that the age of consent in Norway is 16, abstinence is not emphasized. In a subsequent series for teens and young adults, real people were recruited to have sex on tv as counterbalance to the unrealistic presentations in advertising and porn.<ref name=\"CultureTrip.2017\"/>\n\nAs of 2015, however, 37 U.S. states required that sex education curricula include lessons on abstinence and 25 required that a \u201cjust say no\u201d approach be stressed. Studies show that early and complete sex education does not increase the likelihood of becoming sexually active, but leads to better health outcomes overall.{{snf|Zadrozny|2015}} The Netherlands also has open and comprehensive sex education beginning as early as age 4, which similar health outcomes, in addition to promoting social benefits such as gender equality. Young children often play outdoors or in public wading pools nude.{{sfn|Rough|2018}}\n\nIn a 2018 survey of predominantly white middle-class college students in the United States, only 9.98% of women and 7.04% of men reported seeing real people (either adults or other children) as their first childhood experience of nudity. Many were accidental (walking in on someone) and were more likely to be remembered as negative by women. Only 4.72% of women and 2% of men reported seeing nude images as part of sex education. 83.59% of women and 89.45% of men reported that their first image of nudity was in film, video, or other mass media.{{sfn|Allen| Gary| Lavender-Stott| Kaestle|2018}}\n\n====High and low context cultures====\n{{also| Naturism in Germany| Naturism in France}}\nHigh and low context cultures were defined by [[Edward T. Hall]]. The behaviors and norms of a high context culture depend upon shared implicit intuitions that operate within a social situation, while in a low context culture behavior is more dependent upon explicit communications.{{sfn|Hall|1989}} An example of this distinction was found in research on the behavior of French and German naturists on a nude beach. Germans are extremely low in cultural context. They are characterized by individualism, alienation, estrangement from other people, little body contact, low sensitivity to nonverbal cues, and segmentation of time and space. By contrast, the French, in their personal lives are relatively high context: they interact within closely knit groups, are sensitive to nonverbal cues, and engage in relatively high amounts of body contact. To maintain public propriety on a nude beach, German naturists avoided touching themselves and others and avoid any adornments or behaviors that would call attention to the body. French naturists, on the other hand, were more likely than Germans to wear make-up and jewelry and to touch others as they would while dressed.{{sfn|Smith|1980}}\n\n====Concepts of privacy====\nSocieties in [[continental Europe]] conceive of privacy as protecting a right to respect and personal dignity. In America, the right to privacy is oriented toward values of liberty, especially in one's home. While Europeans maintain their dignity, even while naked where others may see them, Americans see public nakedness as a surrender of \"any reasonable [[expectation of privacy]]\". Such cultural differences may make some laws and behaviors of other societies seem incomprehensible.{{sfn|Whitman|2004|p=9}}\n\n==== Gender differences ====\n{{also|Sex differences in humans|Breast#Society and culture}}\nIn Western cultures, shame can result from not living up to the ideals of society with regard to physical appearance. Historically, such shame has affected women more than men. With regard to their naked bodies, the result is a tendency towards self-criticism by women, while men are less concerned by the evaluation of others.{{sfn|Weinberg|Williams|2010}}\n\n[[File:3 Topless Females Sunbathing on a Beach.JPG|thumb|left|In many European counties women may sunbathe without covering their breasts.]]\n\nIn much of the world, the modesty of women is a matter not only of social custom but of the legal definition of [[Indecent exposure#United States|indecent exposure]]. In the United States, the exposure of female nipples is a criminal offense in many states and is not usually allowed in public.{{sfn|Williams|2019}} \n\nThe \"[[topfreedom]]\" movement promotes equal rights for women to be naked above the waist in public on the same basis that would apply to men in the same circumstances.{{sfn|Jensen|2004}}\n\n[[Breastfeeding in public]] is forbidden in some [[jurisdiction]]s, not regulated in others, and protected as a legal right in public and the workplace in still others. Where public breastfeeding is a legal right, some mothers may be reluctant to [[breastfeed]],{{sfn|Wolf|2008|p=11}}{{sfn|Vance|2005|pp=51\u201354}} and some people may object to the practice.{{sfn|Jordan|Pile|2003|p=233}}\n\n=== Imposed nudity ===\n{{also|Pantsing}}\n\n==== Punishment ====\nIn some situations, nudity is forced on a person. For example, imposed nudity (full or partial) can be part of a [[corporal punishment]] or as [[public humiliation|humiliation]], especially when administered in public.\n\nFor example, in 2017, students at a girls' school in the north-east Indian state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] were forced to undress as a form of punishment, police say. Although not as common as [[corporal punishment]], it is not unusual for stripping to be used as a form of punishment in Indian schools.<ref name=\"BBC.2017\"/>\n====Torture====\n[[File:Abu-ghraib-leash.jpg|thumb|180px|One of the iconic photographs of the [[Abu Ghraib]] prison torture scandal: a naked prisoner being forced to crawl and bark like a dog on a leash. ]]\n\n[[Nazism|Nazis]] used forced nudity to attempt to humiliate inmates in [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]].

Photographic images were circulated that showed the posing of prisoners naked, sometimes bound, and being intimidated and otherwise humiliated, resulting in widespread condemnation of the abuse.<ref name=\"CNN.2004\" />{{sfn|Hoge|2004}}\n\n==== Strip search ====\n{{Main|Strip search}}\nA strip search is the removal of some or all of a person's clothing to insure that they do not have weapons or contraband. Such searches are generally done when an individual is imprisoned after an arrest, and is justified by the need to maintain order in the facility, not as punishment for a crime.<ref name=\"FindLaw\"/>\n\n===Laws regarding public nudity===\n{{Main|Indecent exposure|Clothing laws by country}}\nSince regulation of everyday public behavior is more often a matter of social convention than written law, some jurisdictions may have no specific law against nudity in public. This was the case in 2006, when three young men who had been skinny-dipping outside [[Brattleboro, Vermont]] decided to go into town to see what would happen if they disrobed there. They were not arrested, and the following two summers saw a number of incidents of public nakedness until an ordinance banning nudity was passed.{{sfn|Anand|2008}}\n\nIn the 21st century [[United States]], the legal definition of \"full nudity\" is exposure of the genitals. \"Partial nudity\" includes exposure of the [[buttocks]] by either sex or exposure of the female [[breast]]s.<ref name=\"LawInsider\" /> Legal definitions are further complicated by laws regarding [[indecent exposure]]; this term generally refers to engaging in public nudity with an intent to offend common decency.<ref name=\"Websters\"/> Lewd and indecent behavior is usually defined as causing alarm, discomfort, or annoyance for the average person. Where the law has been challenged by asserting that nudity by itself in not lewd or disorderly, laws have been amended to specify indecent exposure, usually of the genitals but not always of the breast. Public indecency in generally a [[misdemeanor]], but may become a [[felony]] upon repeated offense or always if done in the presence of a minor.{{sfn|Posner|Silbaugh|1996|loc=chpt. 6}} In the State of Oregon, public nudity is legal and protected as free speech as long as there is not an \"intent to arouse\".{{sfn|Hale|2015}} At the other extreme, the State of Arkansas not only outlaws private nudism, but bans anyone from advocating the practice.{{sfn|Posner|Silbaugh|1996|p=85}}\n\nIn the United Kingdom, nudity may not be used to \"harass, alarm or distress\" according to the Public Order Act of 1986.{{sfn|Arfin|2019}} According to a police spokesperson in 2013, nudity per se is not unlawful in the United Kingdom; however, the circumstances surrounding particular episodes of nudity may create public order offenses. Most naturists comply with the law by being nude only where others cannot see them.<ref name=\"BBC.2013\"/> After repeated arrests, prosecutions, and convictions in Great Britain, the activist [[Stephen Gough]] sued at the [[European Court of Human Rights]] for the right to be nude in public outside of designated areas.

While many celebrations of carnival worldwide include minimal costumes, the extent of nudity in the [[French Quarter]] is due to its long history as a \"[[red light district]]\". The ritual \"disrobing\" is done in the context of a performance which earns a payment, even though it is only symbolic (glass beads). Although the majority of those performing continue to be women, men (both homosexual and heterosexual) now also participate.{{sfn|Shrum|Kilburn|1996}}\n* [[Mooning]] refers to exposure of the buttocks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://slate.com/culture/2012/06/mooning-a-history-when-did-people-start-baring-their-butts-as-an-insult.html|title=When Did People Start Mooning Each Other?|first=Forrest|last=Wickman|date=27 June 2012|website=Slate Magazine}}</ref>  Mooning opponents in sports or in battle as an insult may have a history going back to ancient Rome.{{sfn|Wickman|2012}}\n* [[Streaking]] refers to running nude through a public area for publicity, as a [[prank]], as a dare, or as a form of [[protest]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/life/stripped-of-inhibitions-486277171.html|title=Jun 2018: Streakers make some events memorable for wrong reasons|first=Doug|last=Speirs|date=23 June 2018|via=www.winnipegfreepress.com|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press}}</ref>\n\n===Morality===\n{{also|Nudity in religion}}\n[[Shame]] is one of the [[moral emotions]] often associated with nudity. While [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] is the emotion experienced in response to a particular wrong action, shame is a more general and long-lasting self-assessment.{{sfn|Uebel|2019}} Shame is often thought of as positive in response to a failure to act in accordance with moral values, thus motivating an individual to do better in the future. However, shame is often negative as the response to perceived failures to live up to unrealistic expectations. The shame regarding nudity is one of the classic examples of the emotion, yet rather than being a positive motivator, it is considered unhealthy, standing in the way of developing a positive self-image.{{sfn|Thomason|2018|loc=chpt. 1}} Others argue that the shame felt when naked in public is due to valuing modesty and privacy as socially positive.{{sfn| Deonna| Rodogno| Teroni| 2012}} However, the response to such public exposure of normally private behavior is called embarrassment (like guilt, also a short-term emotion), rather than shame.{{sfn|Thomason|2018|p=11}}\n\nThe moral ambiguity of nudity is reflected in its many meanings, often expressed in the [[Conceptual metaphor| metaphors]] used to describe cultural values, both positive and negative.{{sfn|Barcan|2004a|pp=77\u201383}} \n\nOne of the first\u2014but now obsolete\u2014meanings of ''nude'' in the 16th century was \"mere, plain, open, explicit\" reflected in the modern metaphors \"the naked truth\", \"the bare facts\". Naturists often speak of their nakedness in terms of a return to the innocence and simplicity of childhood. The term naturism is based upon nakedness as being connected to nature in a positive way; which includes [[egalitarianism]], that all humans are alike in their nakedness. Nudity also represents freedom; the liberation of the body is associated with sexual liberation, although many naturists tend to downplay this connection. In some forms of [[Nude psychotherapy|group psychotherapy]], nudity has been used to promote open interaction and communication. Religious persons who reject the world as it is including all possessions may practice nudism, or use nakedness as a protest against an unjust world.{{sfn|Barcan|2004a|pp=83\u2013106}}\n\nMany of the negative associations are the inverse of positive ones. If nudity is truth, nakedness may be an invasion of privacy or the exposure of uncomfortable truths, a source of anxiety. The strong connection of nudity to sex produces shame when naked in contexts where sexuality is deemed inappropriate. Rather than being natural, nakedness is associated with savagery, poverty, criminality, and death. To be deprived of clothes is punishment; humiliating and degrading.{{sfn|Barcan|2004a|pp=106\u2013138}}\n\nConfronted with this ambiguity, some individuals seek to resolve it by working toward greater acceptance of nudity for themselves and others. The majority of naturists go through stages during which they gradually learn a new set of values regarding the human body.{{sfn|G\u00f3rnicka|2016|}} However, Krista Thomason notes that negative emotions including shame exist because they are functional, and that human beings are not perfect.{{sfn|Thomason|2018|loc=Conclusion}}\n\n=== Protests ===\n{{main article|Nudity and protest}}\n[[File:WNBR London 2012.jpg|thumb|left|People taking part in the [[World Naked Bike Ride]] in London]]\nNudity is used to draw public and attention to a cause, sometimes including the promotion of public nudity itself.{{sfn|Alaimo|2010}}\n\nParticular issues represented include animal rights by the group [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]], environmental issues by the [[World Naked Bike Ride]], women's rights by the organization [[Femen|FEMEN]].\n\n===Sexuality===\n{{main|Nudity and sexuality}}\n{{also|Sexual attraction|Physical attractiveness}}\n\nPersons who practice and advocate personal and social nudity distinguish between ''sexual'' and ''non-sexual'' nudity. Studies of naturism find that its practitioners adopt behaviors and norms that suppress the sexual responses while practicing social nudity.{{sfn|Smith|King|2009|pp=439\u2013446}} Such norms include refraining from staring, touching, or otherwise calling attention to the body while naked.{{sfn|Smith|1980|pp=223\u2013241}} However, some naturists do not maintain this non-sexual atmosphere, as when nudist resorts host sexually oriented events.{{sfn|Silver|1991}}\n\n==Modern social practices==\nNorms related to nudity are associated with norms regarding [[personal freedom]], [[human sexuality]], and [[gender role]]s, which vary widely among modern societies. Situations where nudity is accepted vary. Some people practice nudism within the confines of \"[[nudist camp]]s\" or clothing-optional resorts, while naturists seek more open acceptance of nudity in everyday life and in public spaces.{{sfn|Cooper|2011|pp=326\u2013357}}\n\n===Baths and spas===\n{{also|Sauna}}\nBathing for cleanliness and recreation is a human universal found worldwide, and the communal use of bathing facilities has been maintained in many cultures from varying traditional sources. When there is complete nudity, the facilities are often segregated by sex, but not always.\n\nThe [[sauna]], originating from [[Finland]], is attended nude in its source country{{sfn|Daney|1998}} as well as in most Scandinavian countries and in the German-speaking countries of Europe.{{sfn|Scheuch|2004|pp=156-}} This is true even when a swimsuit must be worn in the swimming pool area of the same complex.{{sfn|Daney|1998}} The trend in some European countries (Germany, Finland and the [[Netherlands]], for instance) is to allow both genders to bathe together naked. For example, the Friedrichsbad in [[Baden-Baden]] has designated times when mixed nude bathing is permitted. Most German (not to mention French, Spanish and Greek) beaches and swimming pools offer [[Freik\u00f6rperkultur|FKK]] (clothing-optional) areas.

These normal activities are guided by generally accepted norms, the first of which is that the facilities are most often segregated by gender; however, this may not be the case in all cultures.<!--Summary of section content, no citations-->\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1987-0609-302, K\u00f6ritz, Duschraum des Kindergartens.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Kindergarten shower room in K\u00f6ritz, a district of [[Neustadt (Dosse)|Neustadt-Dosse]] (1987)]]\n\n[[Changing room|Changing rooms]] may be provided in stores, workplaces, or sports facilities to allow people to change their clothing. Some changing rooms have individual cubicles or stalls affording varying degrees of privacy. Locker rooms and communal showers associated with sports generally lacked any individual space, thus providing minimal physical privacy.\n\nThe men\u2019s locker room\u2014which historically in Western cultures had been a setting for open male social nudity\u2014is, in the 21st century United States, becoming a space of modesty and distancing between men. For much of the 20th century, the norm in locker rooms had been for men to undress completely without embarrassment. That norm has changed; in the 21st century, men typically wear towels or other garments in the locker room most of the time and avoid any interaction with others while naked. This shift is the result of changes in social norms regarding masculinity and how maleness is publicly expressed; also, open male nudity has become associated with homosexuality.{{sfn|Miller|2016}} In facilities such as the YMCA that cater to multiple generations, the young are uncomfortable sharing space with older people who do not cover up.{{sfn|Tosches|2012}} The behavior in women's locker rooms and showers also indicates a generational change, younger women covering more, and full nudity being brief and rare, while older women are more open and casual.{{sfn|Goldman|2007}}\n\nBy the 1990s, communal showers in American schools had become \"uncomfortable\", not only because students were accustomed to more privacy at home, but because young people became more self-conscious based upon the comparison to mass media images of perfect bodies.{{sfn|Johnson|1996}} In the 21st century, some high-end New York City gyms were redesigned to cater to [[millennial]]s who want to shower without ever being seen naked.{{sfn|Sicha|2015}} The trend for privacy is being extended to public schools, colleges and community facilities replacing \"gang showers\" and open locker rooms with individual stalls and changing rooms. The change also addresses issues of transgender usage and family use when one parent accompanies children of differing gender.{{sfn|Steinbach|2017}} \n\nThis shift in attitudes has come to societies historically open to nudity. In Denmark, secondary school students are now avoiding showering after gym classes. In interviews, students cited the lack of privacy, fears of being judged by idealized standards, and the possibility of being photographed while naked.{{sfn|Frydendal|Thing|2020}} Similar results were found in schools in Norway.{{sfn|Johansen|M\u00e6hle|\u00d8yvind|Haugen|2017}}\n\n====Social and public nudity====\n{{also|Nude recreation|Issues in social nudity}}\n[[File:Fremont Solstice Parade 2007 - naked couple 01.jpg|thumb|Nude people at Fremont Solstice Parade in Seattle, Washington, USA]]\nAttitudes toward public nudity vary depending on culture, time, location, and context. There are particular contexts in which nudity is tolerated, accepted, or even encouraged in [[public spaces]]. In Europe, such contexts include [[nude beach|nude beaches]], within some [[Intentional community|intentional communities]] (such as [[naturism|naturist]] resorts or clubs) and at special events.\n\nWhile some European countries (such as [[Germany]], for example) are rather tolerant of public nudity,<ref name=\"Spiegel2006\" /> other nations disfavor or punish public nudity. In the United States in 2012, the city council of [[San Francisco]], California banned public nudity in the inner-city area. This move was met by harsh resistance because the city was known for its liberal culture and had previously tolerated public nudity.{{sfn|Taub|2012}}{{sfn|Reynolds|2012}} Similarly, [[park ranger]]s began filing tickets against nudists at [[San Onofre State Beach]]\u2014also a place with long tradition of public nudity\u2014in 2010.{{sfn|Sisson|2010}}\n\n====Naturism====\n{{Main article|Naturism}}\n{{also|Christian naturism}}\n[[File:At the nudist beach.jpg|thumb|left|A group of naturists on a beach in [[Crimea]], 2008]]\n\nNaturism (or nudism) is a [[subculture]] advocating and defending private and public nudity as part of a simple, natural [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]]. Nudism originated in opposition to the [[industrialization]] of Europe in the late 19th century.<ref name=\"Grinnell\"/> \n\nNaturists reject contemporary standards of modesty that discourage personal, family and social nudity. They instead seek to create a social environment where individuals feel comfortable being in the company of nude people and being seen nude, either by other naturists or by the general public.{{sfn|Hile|2004}}\n\nNudism spawned a proselytizing literature in the 1920s and 1930s. Nudism's other common name, naturism, signals its core contention that the naked body is natural and that modesty and shame are cultural impositions with deleterious effects on psychological, sexual, and social well-being. Early nudism was in dialogue with sexology and feminism in a critique of society and its future.{{sfn|Barcan|2004b|pp=63-65}} While Christian moralists tended to condemn nudism, other Christians argued for the purity of the nude body compared to the corruption of the scanty clothing of the era.{{sfn|Barcan|2004b|pp=65-66}} Its proponents believed that nudism could combat social inequality, including sexual inequality.{{sfn|Barcan|2004b|pp=67-68}} As a socially marginal practice based on the naturalness of nakedness, nudism has had a complicated relationship with sexuality and pro\u2010sex discourses.{{sfn|Barcan|2015}} \n\nThe social sciences until the middle of the 20th century often studied public nakedness, including naturism, in the context of [[Deviance (sociology)|deviance]] or criminality.{{sfn|Barcan|2004a|pp=4\u201310}} However, more recent studies find that naturism has positive effects on body image, self esteem and life satisfaction.{{sfn|West|2018|pp=677\u2013697}} The ''Encyclopedia of Social Deviance'' continues to have an entry on \"Nudism\",{{sfn|Black|2014}} but also defines \"Normal Deviance\" as violating social norms in a positive way, leading to social change.{{sfn|Hasha|Kalish|2014}}\n\n====Nude beaches====\n{{main|Nude beach}}\n{{also|Nude recreation|Nude swimming}}\nA nude beach, sometimes called a clothing-optional or free beach, is a [[beach]] where users are at liberty to be nude. Such beaches are usually on public lands. Nude beaches may be official (legally sanctioned), unofficial (tolerated by residents and law enforcement), or illegal but so isolated as to escape enforcement.\n\n==== Arts-related activities ====\nDistinct from the [[nudity#Depictions of nudity|nude artworks]] created, sessions where artists, both amateur and professional, work from live models are a social situation where nudity has a long tradition. The role of the model both as part of visual art education and in the creation of finished works has evolved since antiquity in Western societies and worldwide wherever western cultural practices in the visual arts have been adopted. At modern universities, art schools, and community groups \"[[Model (art)|art model]]\" is a job, one requirement of which is to pose \"undraped\" and motionless for minutes, hours (with breaks) or days as the artwork requires.{{sfn| Steinhart|2004}}\n\nPhotography of groups of nude people in public places has been done around the world with or without official cooperation. The gathering itself is proposed as performance art, while the resulting images become statements based upon the identities of people invited to participate by posing, and the location selected; urban, scenic landscapes, or sites of historical significance. The photographers state a variety of artistic, cultural, and political reasons for their work, while those being photographed may be professional models or unpaid volunteers attracted to the project for personal reasons.\n\n*[[Spencer Tunick]] has been photographing his \"installations\" since 1994, often in urban spaces but also in landscapes.

In \"The Nude: a Study in Ideal Form\", Lord [[Kenneth Clark]] states that to be naked is to be deprived of clothes, and implies embarrassment and shame, while a nude, as a work of art, has no such connotations.{{sfn|Clark|1956|loc=chpt. 1}} This separation of the artistic form from the related social and cultural issues was largely unexamined by classical art historians, but became a focus of social and feminist critiques in the 1970s, when classical nudes of women were seen as symbolic of male objectification of female bodies.{{sfn|Berger|1972}}{{sfn|Mulvey|1975}} The debate over [[objectification]] has continued, recently energized by the #[[MeToo]] movement.{{sfn|Slenske|Langmuir|2018}}\n\n==Performance==\nNudity may be used as a part of live performances, such as dance, theater, [[Performance art#1960s|performance art]] and nude [[body painting]].<!--Summary of content below-->\n===Dance===\n[[Dance]], as a sequence of human movement, may be [[Ceremonial dance|ceremonial]], [[Social dance|social]] or one of the [[performing arts]].

However, some claim that modern practices may be used to promote \"ethnic tourism\" rather than to revive authentic traditions.{{sfn|Firenzi|2012}} In Western traditions, dance costumes have evolved towards providing more freedom of movement and revealing more of the body; complete nakedness is the culmination of this process.{{sfn|Sparshott|1995}} Modern choreographers consider nudity one of the possible \"costumes\" available for dance, some seeing nudity as expressing deeper human qualities through dance which works against the [[sexual objectification]] of the body in commercial culture.{{sfn|Cappelle|Whittenburg|2014}} While nudity in social dance is not common, events such as \"Naked Tango\" have been held in Germany.{{sfn|Nethers|2013}}\n\n===Theater===\nA well-known performance that included nudity was the Broadway musical [[Hair (musical)#Nude scene|Hair]] in 1968.{{sfn|Libbey|2018}} The New York Times printed a number of letters to the editor in 1969 with opinions ranging from actress [[June Havoc]] stating that nudity indicates that the producer has run out of ideas;

As a native of Lviv, even after the war she felt a bond with the city of her childhood and youth which she revealed in her work. She studied [[Classics|classical philology]] and graduated in [[romance studies]] at the  [[University of Lviv]]. Knowledge of Greek and Latin, German, and especially fluent knowledge of French, which she mastered with confidence, along with a lively and absorbent intellectual sensitivity, allowed her to read in the original the works of the classics, and also to closely follow modern Western culture.\n\nIn 1924, Anna Chrzanowska's married her 10 years older professor, Jerzy Kowalski, classical philologist at the University of Lviv. In the interwar period, they traveled a lot around Europe: they visited, among others, [[Italy]], [[Paris]], [[Lausanne]] (where Kowalska attended lectures in Latin literature), [[Berlin]] and [[Munich]] (where she also listened to university lectures). In 1946, their daughter Maria, called Tula at home, was born in Wroc\u0142aw. Kowalska joined the literary life of interwar Lviv, cooperated with the Sygna\u0142y weekly and the Przedmie\u015bcie literary group. In 1936 she co-organized the Congress of Culture Workers.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the [[World War II]], the Kowalski family remained in Soviet Lviv: Jerzy continued lecturing at the university, Anna was a witness of political repressions (her brother was imprisoned, and her sister-in-law was deported to Siberia by Russians). In 1943 they moved to Warsaw, where Kowalska joined the underground resistane. She was in the city during the [[Warsaw Uprising]].\n\nIn 1945 she moved with her husband to [[Wroc\u0142aw]], where Jerzy Kowalski organized classical philology at the University of Wroc\u0142aw. They settled in [[Kar\u0142owice]], in a villa at Samuel Bogumi\u0142 Linde Street 10. After the death of her husband (he died of cancer in 1948) Kowalska remained in Wroc\u0142aw. She participated in the literary and intellectual life of the city, in the years 1947\u20131952 she was a co-editor of the quarterly \"Zeszyty Wroc\u0142awskie\". A room in the house at Linde Street was rented by [[Czes\u0142aw Hernas]], then a student of Polish studies, then he was very close friends with Kowalska and [[Maria D\u0105browska]].\n\nIn 1954, Anna Kowalska moved to Warsaw and lived together with her daughter and Maria D\u0105browska (in a spacious apartment in a pre-war tenement house at Aleja Niepodleg\u0142o\u015bci). In 1963 they went together to Italy, [[Switzerland]] and Paris - visiting, among others [[Gustaw Herling-Grudzi\u0144ski]], [[Jerzy Giedroyc]] and [[Jerzy Stempowski]]. She participated in the literary life of the capital, belonging to ZLP and [[Pen Club]]. She was one of the signatories of the so-called [[Letter of 34]] to Prime Minister [[J\u00f3zef Cyrankiewicz]] regarding freedom of culture. Despite having a progressing cancer, she followed the events of [[1968 Polish political crisis|March 1968]], bitterly journaling anti-democratic activities of the authorities.\n\nKowalska was [[Bisexuality|bisexual]]<ref>[[Krzysztof Tomasik]]: ''Czy wielki pisarz mo\u017ce by\u0107 lesbijk\u0105?

In 1941 she met Maria D\u0105browska in Lviv, and when after two years she moved with her husband to Warsaw, they settled at home at Polna Street, in which D\u0105browska and Stanis\u0142aw Stempowski had their apartment for years. Soon friendship and passionate love formed between women. Anna Kowalska remained a lifelong friend and companion of D\u0105browska's life. The bond lasted also during Kowalska's stay in Wroc\u0142aw and regardless of her motherhood. Living together in Warsaw, however, Kowalska felt (which she reports in the diary) the tear between her daughter Tulcia and D\u0105browska, who disliked each other. During the last years of her life, D\u0105browska lived in her own home in Komor\u00f3w near Warsaw. After D\u0105browska's death in 1965, Kowalska felt humiliated by her friend's will (in which she was omitted), before a later version was found, which included her and made her responsible for the legacy of writing.<ref>[[Tadeusz Drewnowski]]: ''Wyprowadzka z czy\u015b\u0107ca.

She had many good friends among writers, who treated hertreated as an authority (also with regards to resistance against the communist authorities). They were, among others.

As a native of Lviv, even after the war she felt a bond with the city of her childhood and youth which she revealed in her work. She studied [[Classics|classical philology]] and graduated in [[romance studies]] at the  [[University of Lviv]]. Knowledge of Greek and Latin, German, and especially fluent knowledge of French, which she mastered with confidence, along with a lively and absorbent intellectual sensitivity, allowed her to read in the original the works of the classics, and also to closely follow modern Western culture.\n\nIn 1924, Anna Chrzanowska's married her 10 years older professor, Jerzy Kowalski, classical philologist at the University of Lviv. In the interwar period, they traveled a lot around Europe: they visited, among others, [[Italy]], [[Paris]], [[Lausanne]] (where Kowalska attended lectures in Latin literature), [[Berlin]] and [[Munich]] (where she also listened to university lectures). In 1946, their daughter Maria, called Tula at home, was born in Wroc\u0142aw. Kowalska joined the literary life of interwar Lviv, cooperated with the Sygna\u0142y weekly and the Przedmie\u015bcie literary group. In 1936 she co-organized the Congress of Culture Workers.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the [[World War II]], the Kowalski family remained in Soviet Lviv: Jerzy continued lecturing at the university, Anna was a witness of political repressions (her brother was imprisoned, and her sister-in-law was deported to Siberia by Russians). In 1943 they moved to Warsaw, where Kowalska joined the underground resistane. She was in the city during the [[Warsaw Uprising]].\n\nIn 1945 she moved with her husband to [[Wroc\u0142aw]], where Jerzy Kowalski organized classical philology at the University of Wroc\u0142aw. They settled in [[Kar\u0142owice]], in a villa at Samuel Bogumi\u0142 Linde Street 10. After the death of her husband (he died of cancer in 1948) Kowalska remained in Wroc\u0142aw. She participated in the literary and intellectual life of the city, in the years 1947\u20131952 she was a co-editor of the quarterly \"Zeszyty Wroc\u0142awskie\". A room in the house at Linde Street was rented by [[Czes\u0142aw Hernas]], then a student of Polish studies, then he was very close friends with Kowalska and [[Maria D\u0105browska]].\n\nIn 1954, Anna Kowalska moved to Warsaw and lived together with her daughter and Maria D\u0105browska (in a spacious apartment in a pre-war tenement house at Aleja Niepodleg\u0142o\u015bci). In 1963 they went together to Italy, [[Switzerland]] and Paris - visiting, among others [[Gustaw Herling-Grudzi\u0144ski]], [[Jerzy Giedroyc]] and [[Jerzy Stempowski]]. She participated in the literary life of the capital, belonging to ZLP and [[Pen Club]]. She was one of the signatories of the so-called [[Letter of 34]] to Prime Minister [[J\u00f3zef Cyrankiewicz]] regarding freedom of culture. Despite having a progressing cancer, she followed the events of [[1968 Polish political crisis|March 1968]], bitterly journaling anti-democratic activities of the authorities.\n\nKowalska was [[Bisexuality|bisexual]]<ref>[[Krzysztof Tomasik]]: ''Czy wielki pisarz mo\u017ce by\u0107 lesbijk\u0105?

In 1941 she met Maria D\u0105browska in Lviv, and when after two years she moved with her husband to Warsaw, they settled at home at Polna Street, in which D\u0105browska and Stanis\u0142aw Stempowski had their apartment for years. Soon friendship and passionate love formed between women. Anna Kowalska remained a lifelong friend and companion of D\u0105browska's life. The bond lasted also during Kowalska's stay in Wroc\u0142aw and regardless of her motherhood. Living together in Warsaw, however, Kowalska felt (which she reports in the diary) the tear between her daughter Tulcia and D\u0105browska, who disliked each other. During the last years of her life, D\u0105browska lived in her own home in Komor\u00f3w near Warsaw. After D\u0105browska's death in 1965, Kowalska felt humiliated by her friend's will (in which she was omitted), before a later version was found, which included her and made her responsible for the legacy of writing.<ref>[[Tadeusz Drewnowski]]: ''Wyprowadzka z czy\u015b\u0107ca.
