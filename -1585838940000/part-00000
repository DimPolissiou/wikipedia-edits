In 1620, the Jesuit fathers which belonged to the \"residencia\" of Carigara, the first and central station of the Society of Jesus in Leyte.\n\nBy superior approbation, Baybay was created a parish on September 8, 1835 with the invocation of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. However, the town was erected and independent parish on February 27, 1836.\n[[File:Immaculate Conceptio Church, Baybay City, Leyte, Philippines.JPG|thumb|left|The Immaculate Conception Church in Baybay, Leyte]]\n\nWhen the Augustinians took over the administration of the parish after the expulsion of the Jesuits, they opened the first school in Baybay. During their time, the first road leading to Palompon was constructed, thus bringing Baybay closer to her neighboring municipalities. The Augustinian fathers stayed in the town for 75 years - all of which they devoted to the upliftment of the natives in education and in their economic standing.\n\nThe first church of Baybay was built in Barrio Punta where it still stands today but is in need of repair. Punta is one of the seven original barrios of Baybay and was even believed to be the original site of Baybay itself, although there are others who say that it was actually in Kabkab, in the vicinity of Barrio Pangasugan.\n\nChinese invaders attempted to conquer the community, but the brave and staunch natives foiled several attempts. When the Spanish conquistadors spread themselves out to the provinces, an expeditionary force under Felipe Segundo, evidently looking for a bigger settlement, landed in a barrio north of the town which was and still is called Pangasugan. Landing near the river, he pointed to a spot and asked a native in Spanish for the name of the place. Unable to understand Spanish and thinking that Felipe Segundo wanted to ask about the river, he answered in Visayan, \" Ang suba nagbaybay sa Pangasugan.\" This is how Baybay got its name.\n\nBaybay also suffered from Moro raids. On October 22, 1605, one such raid occurred and the pirates, after leaving countless dead, carried off 60 men as captives. Again, on November 4, 1663, moors under the dreaded Corralat took their toll of human lives and captives after mercilessly slaughtering the handful of men who defended the town with the aid of the parish priest.\n\nBaybay suffered a great setback in 1866 when a great fire practically reduced the town to ashes leaving only the chapel of the Holy Cross in a miraculous manner.\n\nThe civil administration of the town during the Spanish era was placed in the hands of the gobernadorcillo, assisted by a teniente and the different jueces and cabezas. In 1892, in accordance with the provisions of the Mayura law, the head of the municipal government was given the designation of \"Capitan Municipal\" and his assistants in office were called \"teniente mayor indice\" and the \"teniente de policia.\" For the first time, a juez de paz was designated and a detachment of guardias civiles was placed in the town.\n\nThe construction of the church, which still stands today, was begun under the engineering administration of Mariano Vasnillio during the term of Fr. Vicente E. Coronado in 1852. The construction lagged for ten years after which the work was resumed under Maestro Proceso, who came from Manila for the purpose of finishing the work. The church was finally finished in 1870 after Capitan Mateo Espinoso, a sculptor and painter of renown, put on the finishing touches. The altar and the rails as they stand today are a credit to his genius.\n\nAs the Spanish residents moved away in the early months of 1898, the reins of local government passed completely into the hands of the Filipino officials. An election was held and Don Quirimon Alkuino was elected as the first Filipino presidente. However, after about four months, Gen. Vicente Lukban nullified the results of the election and ordered another one to be held, with the same results. Lukban ordered that the barrios of Baybay be named after the tenientes, thus Caridad was renamed \"Veloso,\" Plaridel became \"Alvarado,\" Bitanhuan was named \"Coronado.\" San Agustin \"Sabando,\" Punta \"Virgineza,\" Pomponan \"Montefolka,\" Gabas \"Bartolini\", etc.\n\nThroughout these years, Baybay developed into one of the biggest towns in Leyte.\n\nThe port of Baybay was closed in 1899 by the American coast guards. The price of commodities soared and products like copra and hemp accumulated in the docks. The order was lifted, but only after 14 ships, the greatest number to dock in port at one time, had stayed in port for days waiting for the order to leave.\n\nOn February 10, 1901, the first Americans arrived in Baybay on the ship \"Melliza\", their arrival caused great confusion and the people evacuated to the barrios. Only a few officials stayed in the town. The next day, soldiers scoured the countryside convincing the people to return to their homes.\n\nEven while the local government was under Don Quirimon Alkuino, he was under orders to follow Capt. Gilmore's (commander of the American attachment) advice. Eventually, this caused conflicts in the local government, and Filipinos took to the hills to join the fight against the Americans.\n\nThere were several attempts to attack the American garrison in the town, but practically all of them failed because the Americans had superior arms. Don Guilermo Alkuino and Don Magdaleno Fernandez led the first attack with more than 200 men. The American soldiers fought another in Barrio Pomponan that resulted in the death of 30 men and the destruction of the barrio.\n\nA group of Hilongosnons under the renowned Francisco Flordelis made an attempt in 1901 but they were driven off in a battle at Barrio Punta.\n\nFilipino nationalist made Baybay one of the areas where they made their last stand against the Americans. Later, the surrender ceremonies were held in the town, but only after numerous conferences between American officers and Filipino pacifists were held to effect the surrender of the resistance leaders. The surrender of Capt. Florentino Penaranda who was the last to give up the fight was a colorful one. All his men and officers, thousands of them, gathered at the banks of the Pagbanganan River. From there, they marched to the plaza in front of the municipal hall where the American officers were waiting. Before the Filipinos laid down their arms, Penaranda delivered a speech that even today is considered one of the most stirring addresses made in the province. To commemorate the event, a sumptuous banquet was held for the Americans and the Filipino nationalists. The following day, the Filipino soldiers trekked home in their uniforms to start another life of peace and work.\n\nA sect of the Protestant religion entered Baybay for the first time sometime in 1900. They established their own church in the poblacion. In 1902, the Philippine Independent Church established itself in the barrio of Caridad; shortly afterwards, the Seventh Day Adventists came in.\n\nAt the turn of the century, a provincial high school was founded in Baybay, one of the first high schools in Leyte. The government also established the Baybay National Agricultural School for young farmers of Visayas and Mindanao.\n\nThe Japanese forces came to Baybay in two waves in 1942. A puppet government was established shortly after their arrival wherein Paterno Tan Sr. was the mayor.\n\nIn 1944, American planes passed the town in bombing missions in Cebu. They bombed a ship at anchor in the port of Baybay and left it in flames. The Japanese Imperial Forces left the town on October 19, 1944.\n\nBaybay was used by liberation forces as a springboard for patrol units in the south and for forces that went north for the great battle of Ormoc, where a fierce battle was raging. The hospital was taken over by the provincial government and is still functioning today.\n\n===Cityhood===\n{{Main|League of Cities of the Philippines vs. COMELEC}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| align= right\n| title= Population census of Baybay\n| 1903 = 22990\n| 1918 = 36917\n| 1939 = 42526\n| 1948 = 50725\n| 1960 = 51799\n| 1970 = 63782\n| 1975 = 67031\n| 1980 = 74640\n| 1990 = 82281\n| 1995 = 86179\n| 2000 = 95630\n| 2007 = 102526\n| 2010 = 102841\n| 2015 = 109432\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote = Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]] {{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nThe people of Baybay, known as Baybayanons or Baybayanos (depending on the usage) which are Cebuano-speaking. Most of the people are [[Roman Catholic]] with almost 90% of the whole population.\n\n===Language===\nPeople of Baybay City are mostly [[Boholano language|Boholano-speaking]] and [[Cebuano language|Cebuano-speaking]] Leyte\u00f1os with some influences from the [[Waray-Waray language]]. [[Baybayanon]] is the language spoken by inhabitants of the original settlements of Baybay City before mass migration of [[Cebuano people|Cebuanos]] and [[Boholano people|Boholanos]] into the area and widely recognized as predating the surrounding [[Cebuano people|Cebuano]] communities. It is a more representative language reference name than the so-called \"Utodnon\" or \"Waya-Waya\" since it does not refer to a single barangay, but spoken in five barangays, namely Guadalupe (Utod), Gabas, Kilim, Patag and Pangasugan.\n\nIt is a living language given an ISO 639-3 language code '''bvy''' and has an approximate 10,000 speakers (2009 J. Lobel). It has been listed by [[Ethnologue]] as a dialect of Waray-Waray, however, it is distinct from Waray-Waray, and is not mutually intelligible with that language. Furthermore, Baybayanon speakers do not consider themselves or their language to be [[Waray language|Waray-Waray]]. No published works have argued that Baybayanon is a dialect of Waray-Waray; in fact, published works (by Rufino, as well as Lobel's forthcoming dissertation) have specifically referred to this as a distinct or separate language. Other languages spoken by few in the city include [[Philippine English|English]], which is used as a second languages, as well as [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]], mainly spoken by the remaining people of [[Spanish Filipino|mestizo]] and [[Chinese Filipino|Chinese]] descent.\n\n==Local government==\n\n[[File:Baybay City Legislative Building.jpg|thumb|upright|Baybay City Legislative Building and Convention Center.]]\nExecutive power is vested in the mayor.

In 1620, the Jesuit fathers which belonged to the \"residencia\" of Carigara, the first and central station of the Society of Jesus in Leyte.\n\nBy superior approbation, Baybay was created a parish on September 8, 1835 with the invocation of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. However, the town was erected and independent parish on February 27, 1836.\n[[File:Immaculate Conceptio Church, Baybay City, Leyte, Philippines.JPG|thumb|left|The Immaculate Conception Church in Baybay, Leyte]]\n\nWhen the Augustinians took over the administration of the parish after the expulsion of the Jesuits, they opened the first school in Baybay. During their time, the first road leading to Palompon was constructed, thus bringing Baybay closer to her neighboring municipalities. The Augustinian fathers stayed in the town for 75 years - all of which they devoted to the upliftment of the natives in education and in their economic standing.\n\nThe first church of Baybay was built in Barrio Punta where it still stands today but is in need of repair. Punta is one of the seven original barrios of Baybay and was even believed to be the original site of Baybay itself, although there are others who say that it was actually in Kabkab, in the vicinity of Barrio Pangasugan.\n\nChinese invaders attempted to conquer the community, but the brave and staunch natives foiled several attempts. When the Spanish conquistadors spread themselves out to the provinces, an expeditionary force under Felipe Segundo, evidently looking for a bigger settlement, landed in a barrio north of the town which was and still is called Pangasugan. Landing near the river, he pointed to a spot and asked a native in Spanish for the name of the place. Unable to understand Spanish and thinking that Felipe Segundo wanted to ask about the river, he answered in Visayan, \" Ang suba nagbaybay sa Pangasugan.\" This is how Baybay got its name.\n\nBaybay also suffered from Moro raids. On October 22, 1605, one such raid occurred and the pirates, after leaving countless dead, carried off 60 men as captives. Again, on November 4, 1663, moors under the dreaded Corralat took their toll of human lives and captives after mercilessly slaughtering the handful of men who defended the town with the aid of the parish priest.\n\nBaybay suffered a great setback in 1866 when a great fire practically reduced the town to ashes leaving only the chapel of the Holy Cross in a miraculous manner.\n\nThe civil administration of the town during the Spanish era was placed in the hands of the gobernadorcillo, assisted by a teniente and the different jueces and cabezas. In 1892, in accordance with the provisions of the Mayura law, the head of the municipal government was given the designation of \"Capitan Municipal\" and his assistants in office were called \"teniente mayor indice\" and the \"teniente de policia.\" For the first time, a juez de paz was designated and a detachment of guardias civiles was placed in the town.\n\nThe construction of the church, which still stands today, was begun under the engineering administration of Mariano Vasnillio during the term of Fr. Vicente E. Coronado in 1852. The construction lagged for ten years after which the work was resumed under Maestro Proceso, who came from Manila for the purpose of finishing the work. The church was finally finished in 1870 after Capitan Mateo Espinoso, a sculptor and painter of renown, put on the finishing touches. The altar and the rails as they stand today are a credit to his genius.\n\nAs the Spanish residents moved away in the early months of 1898, the reins of local government passed completely into the hands of the Filipino officials. An election was held and Don Quirimon Alkuino was elected as the first Filipino presidente. However, after about four months, Gen. Vicente Lukban nullified the results of the election and ordered another one to be held, with the same results. Lukban ordered that the barrios of Baybay be named after the tenientes, thus Caridad was renamed \"Veloso,\" Plaridel became \"Alvarado,\" Bitanhuan was named \"Coronado.\" San Agustin \"Sabando,\" Punta \"Virgineza,\" Pomponan \"Montefolka,\" Gabas \"Bartolini\", etc.\n\nThroughout these years, Baybay developed into one of the biggest towns in Leyte.\n\nThe port of Baybay was closed in 1899 by the American coast guards. The price of commodities soared and products like copra and hemp accumulated in the docks. The order was lifted, but only after 14 ships, the greatest number to dock in port at one time, had stayed in port for days waiting for the order to leave.\n\nOn February 10, 1901, the first Americans arrived in Baybay on the ship \"Melliza\", their arrival caused great confusion and the people evacuated to the barrios. Only a few officials stayed in the town. The next day, soldiers scoured the countryside convincing the people to return to their homes.\n\nEven while the local government was under Don Quirimon Alkuino, he was under orders to follow Capt. Gilmore's (commander of the American attachment) advice. Eventually, this caused conflicts in the local government, and Filipinos took to the hills to join the fight against the Americans.\n\nThere were several attempts to attack the American garrison in the town, but practically all of them failed because the Americans had superior arms. Don Guilermo Alkuino and Don Magdaleno Fernandez led the first attack with more than 200 men. The American soldiers fought another in Barrio Pomponan that resulted in the death of 30 men and the destruction of the barrio.\n\nA group of Hilongosnons under the renowned Francisco Flordelis made an attempt in 1901 but they were driven off in a battle at Barrio Punta.\n\nFilipino nationalist made Baybay one of the areas where they made their last stand against the Americans. Later, the surrender ceremonies were held in the town, but only after numerous conferences between American officers and Filipino pacifists were held to effect the surrender of the resistance leaders. The surrender of Capt. Florentino Penaranda who was the last to give up the fight was a colorful one. All his men and officers, thousands of them, gathered at the banks of the Pagbanganan River. From there, they marched to the plaza in front of the municipal hall where the American officers were waiting. Before the Filipinos laid down their arms, Penaranda delivered a speech that even today is considered one of the most stirring addresses made in the province. To commemorate the event, a sumptuous banquet was held for the Americans and the Filipino nationalists. The following day, the Filipino soldiers trekked home in their uniforms to start another life of peace and work.\n\nA sect of the Protestant religion entered Baybay for the first time sometime in 1900. They established their own church in the poblacion. In 1902, the Philippine Independent Church established itself in the barrio of Caridad; shortly afterwards, the Seventh Day Adventists came in.\n\nAt the turn of the century, a provincial high school was founded in Baybay, one of the first high schools in Leyte. The government also established the Baybay National Agricultural School for young farmers of Visayas and Mindanao.\n\nThe Japanese forces came to Baybay in two waves in 1942. A puppet government was established shortly after their arrival wherein Paterno Tan Sr. was the mayor.\n\nIn 1944, American planes passed the town in bombing missions in Cebu. They bombed a ship at anchor in the port of Baybay and left it in flames. The Japanese Imperial Forces left the town on October 19, 1944.\n\nBaybay was used by liberation forces as a springboard for patrol units in the south and for forces that went north for the great battle of Ormoc, where a fierce battle was raging. The hospital was taken over by the provincial government and is still functioning today.\n\n===Cityhood===\n{{Main|League of Cities of the Philippines vs. COMELEC}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| align= right\n| title= Population census of Baybay\n| 1903 = 22990\n| 1918 = 36917\n| 1939 = 42526\n| 1948 = 50725\n| 1960 = 51799\n| 1970 = 63782\n| 1975 = 67031\n| 1980 = 74640\n| 1990 = 82281\n| 1995 = 86179\n| 2000 = 95630\n| 2007 = 102526\n| 2010 = 102841\n| 2015 = 109432\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote = Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]] {{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nThe people of Baybay, known as Baybayanons or Baybayanos (depending on the usage) which are Cebuano-speaking.

[[Baybayanon]] is the language spoken by inhabitants of the original settlements of Baybay City before mass migration of [[Cebuano people|Cebuanos]] and [[Boholano people|Boholanos]] into the area and widely recognized as predating the surrounding [[Cebuano people|Cebuano]] communities. It is a more representative language reference name than the so-called \"Utodnon\" or \"Waya-Waya\" since it does not refer to a single barangay, but spoken in five barangays, namely Guadalupe (Utod), Gabas, Kilim, Patag and Pangasugan.\n\nIt is a living language given an ISO 639-3 language code '''bvy''' and has an approximate 10,000 speakers (2009 J. Lobel). It has been listed by [[Ethnologue]] as a dialect of Waray-Waray, however, it is distinct from Waray-Waray, and is not mutually intelligible with that language. Furthermore, Baybayanon speakers do not consider themselves or their language to be [[Waray language|Waray-Waray]]. No published works have argued that Baybayanon is a dialect of Waray-Waray; in fact, published works (by Rufino, as well as Lobel's forthcoming dissertation) have specifically referred to this as a distinct or separate language. Other languages spoken by few in the city include [[Philippine English|English]], which is used as a second languages, as well as [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]], mainly spoken by the remaining people of [[Spanish Filipino|mestizo]] and [[Chinese Filipino|Chinese]] descent.\n\n==Local government==\n\n[[File:Baybay City Legislative Building.jpg|thumb|upright|Baybay City Legislative Building and Convention Center.]]\nExecutive power is vested in the mayor.

These mandatory [[badge of shame|badges of shame]] had specific meanings indicated by their colour and shape. Such emblems helped guards assign tasks to the detainees. For example, a guard at a glance could see if someone were a convicted criminal (green patch) and thus likely of a tough temperament suitable for ''[[Kapo (concentration camp)|kapo]]'' duty.\n\nSomeone with an escape suspect mark usually would not be assigned to work squads operating outside the camp fence. Someone wearing an F could be called upon to help translate guards' spoken instructions to a trainload of new arrivals from France. Some historical monuments quote the badge-imagery, with the use of a triangle being a sort of visual shorthand to symbolize all camp victims.\n\nThe modern-day use of a [[pink triangle]] emblem to symbolize gay rights is a response to the camp identification patches.\n\n== Badge coding system ==\n[[File:Wikpedia system of identification German camps.png|thumb|right|Prisoners' distinguishing badges]]\nThe system of badges varied between the camps and in the later stages of [[World War II]] the use of badges dwindled in some camps and became increasingly accidental in others. The following description is based on the badge coding system used before and during the early stages of the war in the [[Dachau concentration camp]], which had one of the more elaborate coding systems.\n\nShape was chosen by analogy with the common [[Warning sign|triangular road hazard signs]] in Germany that denote warnings to motorists. Here, a triangle is called inverted because its base is up while one of its angles points down.\n\n=== Single triangles ===\n* Red triangle \u2013 [[political prisoner]]s: [[social democracy|social democrats]], [[Socialism|socialists]], [[communism|communists]] and [[anarchism|anarchists]]; [[Individuals and groups assisting Jews during the Holocaust|rescuers of Jews]]; trade unionists; and [[Suppression of Freemasonry|Freemasons]].\n* Green triangle \u2013 convicts and criminals (often working as ''[[Kapo (concentration camp)|kapos]]'').\n* Blue triangle \u2013 foreign forced laborers and [[emigrants]].\n* [[Purple triangle]] \u2013 primarily [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (over 99%) as well as members of other small pacifist religious groups.<ref group=notes>Johannes S.

A letter P (for ''Polen'') was cut out of the purple cloth to show the yellow backing beneath.  \n\nFurthermore, repeat offenders (''r\u00fcckf\u00e4llige'', meaning recidivists) would receive bars over their stars or triangles, a different colour for a different crime.\n* A political prisoner would have a red bar over their star or triangle.\n* A professional criminal would have a green bar.\n* A foreign forced laborer would not have a blue bar (as their impressment was for the duration of the war), but might have a different coloured bar if they were drawn from another pool of inmates. \n* One of Jehovah's Witnesses would have a purple bar.\n* A homosexual or sex offender would have a pink bar.\n* An asocial would have a black bar.\n* Roma and Sinti (Gypsies) would usually be incarcerated in special sub-camps until they died and so would not normally receive a repeat stripe.\n\nLater in the war (late 1944), to save cloth Jewish prisoners wore a yellow bar over a regular point-down triangle to indicate their status. For instance, regular Jews would wear a yellow bar over a red triangle while Jewish criminals would wear a yellow bar over a green triangle.\n\n==== Special marks ====\n{{More citations needed|section|date=October 2019}}\nMany various markings and combinations existed. A prisoner would usually have at least two and possibly more than six.\n\nLimited preventative custody detainee (''Befristete Vorbeugungshaft H\u00e4ftling'', or BV) was the term for general criminals (who wore green triangles with no special marks). They originally were only supposed to be incarcerated at the camp until their term expired and then they would be released. However, when the war began they were confined indefinitely for its duration.\n\n''Erziehungsh\u00e4ftlinge'' (reformatory inmates) wore E or EH in large black letters on a white square. They were made up of intellectuals and respected community members who could organize and lead a resistance movement, suspicious persons picked up in sweeps or stopped at checkpoints, people caught performing conspiratorial activities or acts and inmates who broke work discipline. They were assigned to hard labor for 6 to 8 weeks and were then released. It was hoped that the threat of permanent incarceration at hard labor  would deter them from further mischief.\n\n''Polizeih\u00e4ftlinge'' (police inmates), short for ''Polizeilich Sicherungsverwahrte H\u00e4ftlinge'' (police secure custody inmates), wore either PH in large black letters on a white square or the letter S (for ''Sicherungsverwahrt'' \u2014 secure custody) on a green triangle. To save expense, some camps had them just wear their civilian clothes without markings. Records used the letter PSV (''Polizeilich Sicherungsverwahrt'') to designate them. They were people awaiting trial by a police court-martial or who were already convicted. They were detained in a special jail barracks until they were executed.\n\nSome camps assigned ''[[Nacht und Nebel]]'' (night and fog) prisoners had them wear two large letters NN in yellow.\n\nSoviet prisoners of war (''russische Kriegsgefangenen'') assigned to work camps (''Arbeitslager'') wore two large letters SU (for ''sowjetischer Untermensch'', meaning Soviet sub-human){{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} in yellow and had vertical stripes painted on their uniforms. They were the few who had not been shot out of hand or died of neglect from untreated wounds, exposure to the elements, or starvation before they could reach a camp. They performed hard labor. Some joined [[Andrey Vlasov|Andrey Vlasov's]] [[Russian Liberation Army|Liberation Army]] to fight for the Germans.\n\nLabor education detainees (''Arbeitserziehung H\u00e4ftling'') wore a white letter A on their black triangle. This stood for ''Arbeitsscheuer'' (work-shy person), designating as lazy social undesirables like Gypsies, petty criminals (e.g. prostitutes and pickpockets), alcoholics/drug addicts and vagrants. They were usually assigned to work at labor camps.\n\n''Asoziale'' (anti-socials) inmates wore a plain black triangle. They were considered either too \"selfish\" or \"deviant\" to contribute to society or were considered too impaired to support themselves. They were therefore considered a burden. This category included pacifists and conscription resisters, petty or habitual criminals, the mentally ill and the mentally and/or physically disabled. They were usually executed or euthanized.\n\nThe Wehrmacht ''[[Strafbattalion]]'' (punishment battalion) and SS ''Bew\u00e4hrungstruppe'' (probation company) were military punishment units. They consisted of [[Wehrmacht]] and SS military criminals, SS personnel convicted by an Honor Court of bad conduct and civilian criminals for which military service was either the assigned punishment or a voluntary replacement of imprisonment. They wore regular uniforms, but were forbidden rank or unit insignia until they had proven themselves in combat. They wore an uninverted (point-upwards) red triangle on their upper sleeves to indicate their status. Most were used for hard labor, \"special tasks\" (unwanted dangerous jobs like defusing landmines or running phone cables) or were used as [[forlorn hope]]s or [[cannon fodder]]. The infamous [[Dirlewanger Brigade]] was an example of a regular unit created from such personnel.\n\nA ''Strafkompanie'' (punishment company) was a hard labor unit in the camps. Inmates assigned to it wore a black roundel bordered white under their triangle patch.\n\nPrisoners \"suspected of [attempting to] escape\" (''Fluchtverd\u00e4chtiger'') wore a red roundel bordered white under their triangle patch. If also assigned to hard labor, they wore the red roundel under their black ''Strafkompanie'' roundel.\n\nA prisoner-functionary (''Funktionsh\u00e4ftling''), or ''[[Kapo (concentration camp)|kapo]]'' (boss), wore a cloth [[brassard]] (their ''Kennzeichen'', or identifying mark) to indicate their status. They served as camp guards (''Lagerpolizei''), barracks clerks (''Blockschreiber'') and the senior prisoners (''\u00e4ltesten'', meaning elders) at the camp (''lager\u00e4ltester''), barracks (''block\u00e4ltester'') and room (''stuben\u00e4ltester'') levels of camp organization. They received privileges like bigger and sometimes better food rations, better quarters (or even a private room), luxuries (like tobacco or alcohol) and access to the camp's facilities (like the showers or the pool). Failure to please their captors meant demotion and loss of privileges and an almost certain death at the hands of their fellow inmates.\n\nDetainees wearing civilian clothing (more common later in the war) instead of the striped uniforms were often marked with a prominent X on the back.<ref name=Saidel>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zglu2RvoLmgC&lpg=PA76&ots=ElAQpjF6Aw&dq=%22an%20x%22%20%22concentration%20camp%22%20-%22x-men%22%20-%22x-ray%22&pg=PA77#v=onepage&q=%22an%20x%22%20%22concentration%20camp%22%20-%22x-men%22%20-%22x-ray%22&f=false|title=The Jewish Women of Ravensbr\u00fcck Concentration Camp|author=Rochelle G.

Most triangles are plain while some others bear [[Nazi concentration camp badges#Other badges|nationality-letters]]. The otherwise potentially puzzling designs are a direct reference to the identification patches used in the camps. On such monuments, typically an inverted (point down, base up) triangle (especially if red) evokes all victims, including also the [[Holocaust#Non-Jewish|non-Jewish victims]] like Slavs, Poles, communists, homosexuals, [[Romani people|Roma and Sinti]] (see [[Porajmos]]), the handicapped (see [[Action T4]]) Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|Soviet POWs]].  An inverted triangle colored pink would symbolize gay male victims.  A non-inverted (base down, point up) triangle and/or a yellow triangle is generally more evocative of the Jewish victims.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"Some examples of camp triangle emblems on monuments and related uses\" widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:KZ Sachsenhausen - zentrales Mahnmal.JPG|At [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]]\nFile:Todesmarsch Gedenkstein Breitenfeld.JPG|A [[Mittelbau-Dora|Dora]] ''Todesmarsch'' [[Death marches (Holocaust)|(death march)]] roadside tablet marked only with the date and a red triangle\nFile:Holocaust Memorial in Estonia.jpg|On the [[Klooga concentration camp|Klooga]] Jewish victims' memorial\nFile:Crawinkel Gedenktafel.JPG|On a [[Buchenwald]] ''Todesmarsch'' [[Death marches (Holocaust)|(death march)]] route historical marker\nFile:Death March Memorial Plaque, Oranienburg.jpg|On a [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]] death march route [[historical marker]]\nFile:Belower-Damm-Wittstock-Dosse-Mahnmal.jpg|Monument (in the village of [[Grabow-Below]]) for [[Ravensbr\u00fcck]] death march victims\nFile:Denkmal KZ Woebbelin4.jpg|On a [[W\u00f6bbelin concentration camp|W\u00f6bbelin]] memorial stone\nFile:Gedenkst\u00e4tte_Lindenring_(2).jpg|Boulder (in Lindenring) for 2,000 women victims of [[Ravensbr\u00fcck]]\nFile:Cenoteph of Cap Arcona.JPG|On a ''[[SS Cap Arcona (1927)|Cap Arcona]]'' incident memorial\nFile:Neustadt-Glewe VVN-Denkmal 2008-01-03.jpg|At the [[Neustadt-Glewe]] concentration camp memorial\nFile:French monument Mauthausen 1243.JPG|F-triangle at [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen-Gusen]] honors French victims\nFile:Croix du Prisonnier Politique 1940-1945.jpg|B-triangle incorporated into the Belgian [[Political Prisoner's Cross 1940\u20131945|Political Prisoner's Cross]]\nFile:KZ-Hinzert-Plakette-Nacht-und-Nebel.jpg|F-triangle at [[Hinzert concentration camp|Hinzert]] honors French victims, especially of the ''[[Nacht und Nebel]]'' program\nFile:Stamps of Germany (DDR) 1973, MiNr 1878.jpg|On a [[Langenstein-Zwieberge]] memorial (pictured on an East German stamp).\nFile:Han Seelhorst Mahnmal KZ Opfer 01.PNG|On a monument to [[Neuengamme concentration camp|Neuengamme]] victims in [[Hamburg]], where the letters KZ are not nationality-letters, but rather are the German abbreviation for ''Konzentrationslager''<br>(concentration camp)\nFile:Ludwigsfelde Friedhof Gedenkstein Widerstandsk\u00e4mpfer.JPG|On a memorial to victims killed at Genshagen (right panel), where the letters KZ are not nationality-letters but rather are the German abbreviation for ''Konzentrationslager''<br>(concentration camp)\nFile:Denkmal f\u00fcr die Opfer der NS-Konzentrationslager Zgorzelec.JPG|P-triangle at a Zgorzelec memorial\nFile:Krzy\u017c O\u015bwi\u0119cimski-awers.jpg|P-triangle on the [[Auschwitz Cross|Polish medal for camp victims]]\nFile:Memorial with Prisoners Triangle Badges and Star of David Badge - Dachau Concentration Camp Site - Dachau - Bavaria - Germany.jpg|Various badges on a [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] memorial{{note|Photo by Adam Jones.}}\nFile:In memory of homosexual.JPG|[[Pink triangle]] (''Rosa Winkel'' in German) memorial for gay men killed at [[Buchenwald]]\nFile:Gedenktafel Rosa Winkel Nollendorfplatz.jpg|In the Berlin [[Nollendorfplatz (Berlin U-Bahn)|Nollendorfplatz subway station]], a pink triangle plaque honors gay male victims{{note|Photo by Manfred Brueckels.}}\nFile:Ac.homomonument.jpg|Amsterdam's ''[[Homomonument]]'' uses pink triangles symbolically to memorialize gay men killed in the [[Holocaust]] and also victims of [[Gay bashing|anti-gay violence generally]]\nFile:Pink triangle on Twin Peaks (19055079410).jpg|Every year, a pink triangle is erected on [[Twin Peaks (San Francisco)|Twin Peaks]] in San Francisco during [[San Francisco Pride|Pride weekend]].\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n'''Informational notes'''\n{{reflist|group=notes}}\n\n'''Citations'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* Richard Plant (1988).

They were used in the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] in the [[Nazism|Nazi]]-occupied countries to identify the reason the prisoners had been placed there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/holocaust/h-dach-early.htm|title=The History Place - Holocaust Timeline: Nazis Open Dachau Concentration Camp|website=historyplace.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref> The triangles were made of fabric and were sewn on jackets and trousers of the prisoners. These mandatory [[badge of shame|badges of shame]] had specific meanings indicated by their colour and shape. Such emblems helped guards assign tasks to the detainees. For example, a guard at a glance could see if someone were a convicted criminal (green patch) and thus likely of a tough temperament suitable for ''[[Kapo (concentration camp)|kapo]]'' duty.\n\nSomeone with an escape suspect mark usually would not be assigned to work squads operating outside the camp fence. Someone wearing an F could be called upon to help translate guards' spoken instructions to a trainload of new arrivals from France. Some historical monuments quote the badge-imagery, with the use of a triangle being a sort of visual shorthand to symbolize all camp victims.\n\nThe modern-day use of a [[pink triangle]] emblem to symbolize gay rights is a response to the camp identification patches.\n\n== Badge coding system ==\n[[File:Wikpedia system of identification German camps.png|thumb|right|Prisoners' distinguishing badges]]\nThe system of badges varied between the camps and in the later stages of [[World War II]] the use of badges dwindled in some camps and became increasingly accidental in others. The following description is based on the badge coding system used before and during the early stages of the war in the [[Dachau concentration camp]], which had one of the more elaborate coding systems.\n\nShape was chosen by analogy with the common [[Warning sign|triangular road hazard signs]] in Germany that denote warnings to motorists. Here, a triangle is called inverted because its base is up while one of its angles points down.\n\n=== Single triangles ===\n* Red triangle \u2013 [[political prisoner]]s: [[social democracy|social democrats]], [[Socialism|socialists]], [[communism|communists]] and [[anarchism|anarchists]]; [[Individuals and groups assisting Jews during the Holocaust|rescuers of Jews]]; trade unionists; and [[Suppression of Freemasonry|Freemasons]].\n* Green triangle \u2013 convicts and criminals (often working as ''[[Kapo (concentration camp)|kapos]]'').\n* Blue triangle \u2013 foreign forced laborers and [[emigrants]].\n* [[Purple triangle]] \u2013 primarily [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (over 99%) as well as members of other small pacifist religious groups.<ref group=notes>Johannes S.

Since their numbers in the camps were quite small compared with the total number of Jehovah\u2019s Witness prisoners, I shall not consider them separately in this article. Historian Antje Zeiger (2001, p. 88) writes about Sachsenhausen camp: 'In May 1938, every tenth prisoner was a Jehovah's Witness.

A letter P (for ''Polen'') was cut out of the purple cloth to show the yellow backing beneath.  \n\nFurthermore, repeat offenders (''r\u00fcckf\u00e4llige'', meaning recidivists) would receive bars over their stars or triangles, a different colour for a different crime.\n* A political prisoner would have a red bar over their star or triangle.\n* A professional criminal would have a green bar.\n* A foreign forced laborer would not have a blue bar (as their impressment was for the duration of the war), but might have a different coloured bar if they were drawn from another pool of inmates. \n* One of Jehovah's Witnesses would have a purple bar.\n* A homosexual or sex offender would have a pink bar.\n* An asocial would have a black bar.\n* Roma and Sinti (Gypsies) would usually be incarcerated in special sub-camps until they died and so would not normally receive a repeat stripe.\n\nLater in the war (late 1944), to save cloth Jewish prisoners wore a yellow bar over a regular point-down triangle to indicate their status. For instance, regular Jews would wear a yellow bar over a red triangle while Jewish criminals would wear a yellow bar over a green triangle.\n\n==== Special marks ====\n{{More citations needed|section|date=October 2019}}\nMany various markings and combinations existed. A prisoner would usually have at least two and possibly more than six.\n\nLimited preventative custody detainee (''Befristete Vorbeugungshaft H\u00e4ftling'', or BV) was the term for general criminals (who wore green triangles with no special marks). They originally were only supposed to be incarcerated at the camp until their term expired and then they would be released. However, when the war began they were confined indefinitely for its duration.\n\n''Erziehungsh\u00e4ftlinge'' (reformatory inmates) wore E or EH in large black letters on a white square. They were made up of intellectuals and respected community members who could organize and lead a resistance movement, suspicious persons picked up in sweeps or stopped at checkpoints, people caught performing conspiratorial activities or acts and inmates who broke work discipline. They were assigned to hard labor for 6 to 8 weeks and were then released. It was hoped that the threat of permanent incarceration at hard labor  would deter them from further mischief.\n\n''Polizeih\u00e4ftlinge'' (police inmates), short for ''Polizeilich Sicherungsverwahrte H\u00e4ftlinge'' (police secure custody inmates), wore either PH in large black letters on a white square or the letter S (for ''Sicherungsverwahrt'' \u2014 secure custody) on a green triangle. To save expense, some camps had them just wear their civilian clothes without markings. Records used the letter PSV (''Polizeilich Sicherungsverwahrt'') to designate them. They were people awaiting trial by a police court-martial or who were already convicted. They were detained in a special jail barracks until they were executed.\n\nSome camps assigned ''[[Nacht und Nebel]]'' (night and fog) prisoners had them wear two large letters NN in yellow.\n\nSoviet prisoners of war (''russische Kriegsgefangenen'') assigned to work camps (''Arbeitslager'') wore two large letters SU (for ''sowjetischer Untermensch'', meaning Soviet sub-human){{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} in yellow and had vertical stripes painted on their uniforms. They were the few who had not been shot out of hand or died of neglect from untreated wounds, exposure to the elements, or starvation before they could reach a camp. They performed hard labor. Some joined [[Andrey Vlasov|Andrey Vlasov's]] [[Russian Liberation Army|Liberation Army]] to fight for the Germans.\n\nLabor education detainees (''Arbeitserziehung H\u00e4ftling'') wore a white letter A on their black triangle. This stood for ''Arbeitsscheuer'' (work-shy person), designating as lazy social undesirables like Gypsies, petty criminals (e.g. prostitutes and pickpockets), alcoholics/drug addicts and vagrants. They were usually assigned to work at labor camps.\n\n''Asoziale'' (anti-socials) inmates wore a plain black triangle. They were considered either too \"selfish\" or \"deviant\" to contribute to society or were considered too impaired to support themselves. They were therefore considered a burden. This category included pacifists and conscription resisters, petty or habitual criminals, the mentally ill and the mentally and/or physically disabled. They were usually executed or euthanized.\n\nThe Wehrmacht ''[[Strafbattalion]]'' (punishment battalion) and SS ''Bew\u00e4hrungstruppe'' (probation company) were military punishment units. They consisted of [[Wehrmacht]] and SS military criminals, SS personnel convicted by an Honor Court of bad conduct and civilian criminals for which military service was either the assigned punishment or a voluntary replacement of imprisonment. They wore regular uniforms, but were forbidden rank or unit insignia until they had proven themselves in combat. They wore an uninverted (point-upwards) red triangle on their upper sleeves to indicate their status. Most were used for hard labor, \"special tasks\" (unwanted dangerous jobs like defusing landmines or running phone cables) or were used as [[forlorn hope]]s or [[cannon fodder]]. The infamous [[Dirlewanger Brigade]] was an example of a regular unit created from such personnel.\n\nA ''Strafkompanie'' (punishment company) was a hard labor unit in the camps. Inmates assigned to it wore a black roundel bordered white under their triangle patch.\n\nPrisoners \"suspected of [attempting to] escape\" (''Fluchtverd\u00e4chtiger'') wore a red roundel bordered white under their triangle patch. If also assigned to hard labor, they wore the red roundel under their black ''Strafkompanie'' roundel.\n\nA prisoner-functionary (''Funktionsh\u00e4ftling''), or ''[[Kapo (concentration camp)|kapo]]'' (boss), wore a cloth [[brassard]] (their ''Kennzeichen'', or identifying mark) to indicate their status. They served as camp guards (''Lagerpolizei''), barracks clerks (''Blockschreiber'') and the senior prisoners (''\u00e4ltesten'', meaning elders) at the camp (''lager\u00e4ltester''), barracks (''block\u00e4ltester'') and room (''stuben\u00e4ltester'') levels of camp organization. They received privileges like bigger and sometimes better food rations, better quarters (or even a private room), luxuries (like tobacco or alcohol) and access to the camp's facilities (like the showers or the pool). Failure to please their captors meant demotion and loss of privileges and an almost certain death at the hands of their fellow inmates.\n\nDetainees wearing civilian clothing (more common later in the war) instead of the striped uniforms were often marked with a prominent X on the back.<ref name=Saidel>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zglu2RvoLmgC&lpg=PA76&ots=ElAQpjF6Aw&dq=%22an%20x%22%20%22concentration%20camp%22%20-%22x-men%22%20-%22x-ray%22&pg=PA77#v=onepage&q=%22an%20x%22%20%22concentration%20camp%22%20-%22x-men%22%20-%22x-ray%22&f=false|title=The Jewish Women of Ravensbr\u00fcck Concentration Camp|author=Rochelle G.

Most triangles are plain while some others bear [[Nazi concentration camp badges#Other badges|nationality-letters]]. The otherwise potentially puzzling designs are a direct reference to the identification patches used in the camps. On such monuments, typically an inverted (point down, base up) triangle (especially if red) evokes all victims, including also the [[Holocaust#Non-Jewish|non-Jewish victims]] like Slavs, Poles, communists, homosexuals, [[Romani people|Roma and Sinti]] (see [[Porajmos]]), the handicapped (see [[Action T4]]) Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|Soviet POWs]].  An inverted triangle colored pink would symbolize gay male victims.  A non-inverted (base down, point up) triangle and/or a yellow triangle is generally more evocative of the Jewish victims.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"Some examples of camp triangle emblems on monuments and related uses\" widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:KZ Sachsenhausen - zentrales Mahnmal.JPG|At [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]]\nFile:Todesmarsch Gedenkstein Breitenfeld.JPG|A [[Mittelbau-Dora|Dora]] ''Todesmarsch'' [[Death marches (Holocaust)|(death march)]] roadside tablet marked only with the date and a red triangle\nFile:Holocaust Memorial in Estonia.jpg|On the [[Klooga concentration camp|Klooga]] Jewish victims' memorial\nFile:Crawinkel Gedenktafel.JPG|On a [[Buchenwald]] ''Todesmarsch'' [[Death marches (Holocaust)|(death march)]] route historical marker\nFile:Death March Memorial Plaque, Oranienburg.jpg|On a [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]] death march route [[historical marker]]\nFile:Belower-Damm-Wittstock-Dosse-Mahnmal.jpg|Monument (in the village of [[Grabow-Below]]) for [[Ravensbr\u00fcck]] death march victims\nFile:Denkmal KZ Woebbelin4.jpg|On a [[W\u00f6bbelin concentration camp|W\u00f6bbelin]] memorial stone\nFile:Gedenkst\u00e4tte_Lindenring_(2).jpg|Boulder (in Lindenring) for 2,000 women victims of [[Ravensbr\u00fcck]]\nFile:Cenoteph of Cap Arcona.JPG|On a ''[[SS Cap Arcona (1927)|Cap Arcona]]'' incident memorial\nFile:Neustadt-Glewe VVN-Denkmal 2008-01-03.jpg|At the [[Neustadt-Glewe]] concentration camp memorial\nFile:French monument Mauthausen 1243.JPG|F-triangle at [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen-Gusen]] honors French victims\nFile:Croix du Prisonnier Politique 1940-1945.jpg|B-triangle incorporated into the Belgian [[Political Prisoner's Cross 1940\u20131945|Political Prisoner's Cross]]\nFile:KZ-Hinzert-Plakette-Nacht-und-Nebel.jpg|F-triangle at [[Hinzert concentration camp|Hinzert]] honors French victims, especially of the ''[[Nacht und Nebel]]'' program\nFile:Stamps of Germany (DDR) 1973, MiNr 1878.jpg|On a [[Langenstein-Zwieberge]] memorial (pictured on an East German stamp).\nFile:Han Seelhorst Mahnmal KZ Opfer 01.PNG|On a monument to [[Neuengamme concentration camp|Neuengamme]] victims in [[Hamburg]], where the letters KZ are not nationality-letters, but rather are the German abbreviation for ''Konzentrationslager''<br>(concentration camp)\nFile:Ludwigsfelde Friedhof Gedenkstein Widerstandsk\u00e4mpfer.JPG|On a memorial to victims killed at Genshagen (right panel), where the letters KZ are not nationality-letters but rather are the German abbreviation for ''Konzentrationslager''<br>(concentration camp)\nFile:Denkmal f\u00fcr die Opfer der NS-Konzentrationslager Zgorzelec.JPG|P-triangle at a Zgorzelec memorial\nFile:Krzy\u017c O\u015bwi\u0119cimski-awers.jpg|P-triangle on the [[Auschwitz Cross|Polish medal for camp victims]]\nFile:Memorial with Prisoners Triangle Badges and Star of David Badge - Dachau Concentration Camp Site - Dachau - Bavaria - Germany.jpg|Various badges on a [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] memorial{{note|Photo by Adam Jones.}}\nFile:In memory of homosexual.JPG|[[Pink triangle]] (''Rosa Winkel'' in German) memorial for gay men killed at [[Buchenwald]]\nFile:Gedenktafel Rosa Winkel Nollendorfplatz.jpg|In the Berlin [[Nollendorfplatz (Berlin U-Bahn)|Nollendorfplatz subway station]], a pink triangle plaque honors gay male victims{{note|Photo by Manfred Brueckels.}}\nFile:Ac.homomonument.jpg|Amsterdam's ''[[Homomonument]]'' uses pink triangles symbolically to memorialize gay men killed in the [[Holocaust]] and also victims of [[Gay bashing|anti-gay violence generally]]\nFile:Pink triangle on Twin Peaks (19055079410).jpg|Every year, a pink triangle is erected on [[Twin Peaks (San Francisco)|Twin Peaks]] in San Francisco during [[San Francisco Pride|Pride weekend]].\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n'''Informational notes'''\n{{reflist|group=notes}}\n\n'''Citations'''\n{{reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* Richard Plant (1988).

The descendants\n\nRam Navami celebrates the birth of the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Lord Ram appeared in Ayodhya as the son of King Dasharath and Queen Kaushalya in the Raghu Kula (Solar Dynasty). He was born on the ninth day of Chaitra month in the noon. This day coincides with the ninth day of Chaitra Navratri, on which is the day when the fasting concludes. As per the Gregorian calendar, the festival falls in the month of March or April.\n\nThe celebration of Ram Navami is done with devotion and joy. The house is decorated and Deity idols are beautifully decorated with flowers, clothes and jewels. The celebrations include fasting, singing of devotional songs, visiting temple and recitation of hymns from Ram Charitmanas. In some places, the celebrations start from the first day of Chaitra Navratri until Navami. While Ram Lila- a theatrical enactment of Ramayana, recitation of Ramayan, chariot procession of Ram, Sita and Laxman idols is done, discourse on Ramayana by story-tellers and satsangs are organized at few places.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Public holidays in India]]\n* [[List of Hindu festivals]]\n\n==References and notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Ramanavami}}\n[https://www.kitpiks.com/why-do-we-celebrate-rama-navami/ Why do we celebrate Rama Navami?]{{Ramayana}}\n{{Hindu Festivals}}\n{{Hindudharma}}\n\n[[Category:Hindu festivals]]\n[[Category:Hindu holy days]]\n[[Category:Vaishnavism]]\n[[Category:Religious festivals in India]]\n[[Category:Religious festivals in Nepal]]\n[[Category:Public holidays in Nepal]]\n[[Category:March observances]]\n[[Category:April observances]]\n[[Category:Swaminarayan sect of Hinduism]]\n[[Category:Ramayana]]\n[[Category:Vrata]]\n[[Category:Birthdays]]\n[[Category:Hindu festivals in India]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Spring festival that celebrates the birthday of the Hindu God Rama}}\n{{EngvarB|date=April 2015}}\n''{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2018}}''\n{{Infobox holiday\n|holiday_name  = Rama Navami\n|type          = Hindu\n|image         = File:Ram Lalla in Shwetambar.JPG\n|caption       = Baby [[Rama]] (Ram Lalla)\n|significance  = Birthday of [[Rama]]\n|date        = Ninth day of [[Chaitra]] (Chaitra [[Shukla Paksha]] Navami)\n|date2019 = 14 April (Sun)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.india.gov.in/calendar?date=2019-04|title=National Portal of India|website=www.india.gov.in|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n|date2020 = 2 April (Thu)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.india.gov.in/calendar?date=2020-04|title=National Portal of India|website=www.india.gov.in|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n|celebrations  = Last day of Chaitra [[Navratri]]\n|observances   = [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]], [[Vrata]] (fast), [[Ramayana]] [[Katha (storytelling format)|Katha recitation]], [[Homa (ritual)|Havan]], [[D\u0101na]] (charity), [[Music Festival]]\n|frequency     = Annual\n}}\n'''Rama Navami''' is a spring [[Hindu]] festival that celebrates the birthday of the Hindu God Lord [[Rama]].\nHe is particularly important to the [[Vaishnavism]] tradition of [[Hinduism]], as the seventh [[avatar]] of God [[Vishnu]].<ref name=bbc/><ref>[http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=175953 The nine-day festival of Navratri leading up to Sri Rama Navami has bhajans, kirtans and discourses in store for devotees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407143924/http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=175953 |date= 7 April 2009 }} ''[[Indian Express]]'', Friday , 31 March 2006.</ref> The festival celebrates the descent of Vishnu as shri Rama avatar, through his birth to King [[Dasharatha]] and Queen [[Kausalya]] in [[Ayodhya (Ramayana)|Ayodhya]].<ref name=dna8apr2014/> The festival is a part of the spring [[Navratri]], and falls on the ninth day of the bright half ([[Paksha|Shukla Paksha]]) in the [[Hindu calendar]] month of [[Chaitra]].

In 1948, the Commonwealth [[head of government|Heads of Government]] agreed that each member would adopt a national citizenship (Canada had already done so), but that the existing status of British subject would continue as a common status held by all [[Commonwealth citizen]]s.\n\nThe [[British Nationality Act 1948]] marked the first time that married British women gained independent nationality, regardless of the citizenship of their spouses.<ref name=\"Baldwin_2001\">{{cite journal |last1=Baldwin |first1=M.

Until the early 1960s there was little difference, if any, in UK law between the rights of CUKCs and other British subjects, all of whom had the right at any time to enter, live and work in the UK.\n\nIndependence acts, passed when the remaining colonies were granted independence, contained nationality provisions. In general, these provisions withdrew CUKC status from anyone who became a citizen of the newly independent country, unless the person had a connection with the UK or a remaining colony (e.g. through birth in the UK). Exceptions were sometimes made in cases where the colonies did not become independent (notable cases include the [[Crown Colony of Penang]] and the [[Crown Colony of Malacca]], which were made part of the [[Federation of Malaya]] in 1957; CUKC status was not withdrawn from CUKCs from Penang and Malacca even though they automatically acquired Malayan citizenship at the time of independence).\n\nBetween 1962 and 1971, as a result of fears about increasing immigration by Commonwealth citizens, the UK gradually tightened controls on immigration by British subjects from other parts of the Commonwealth, which included CUKCs without familial or residential ties to the UK. The [[Immigration Act 1971]] introduced the concept of ''patriality'', by which only British subjects (i.e. CUKCs and Commonwealth citizens) with sufficiently strong links to the [[British Islands]] (e.g. being born in the islands or having a parent or a grandparent who was born there) had ''[[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode]]'', meaning they were exempt from immigration control and had the right to enter, live and work in the islands. The act, therefore, had ''de facto'' created two types of CUKCs: those with right of abode in the UK, and those without right of abode in the UK (who might or might not have right of abode in a Crown colony or another country). Despite differences in immigration status being created, there was no ''de jure'' difference between the two in a nationality context, as the 1948 Act still specified one tier of citizenship throughout the UK and its colonies. This changed in 1983, when the 1948 Act was replaced by a multi-tier nationality system.\n\nThe current principal British nationality law in force, since 1 January 1983, is the [[British Nationality Act 1981]], which established the system of multiple categories of British nationality. To date, six tiers were created: ''British citizens'', ''British Overseas Territories citizens'', ''British Overseas citizens'', ''British Nationals (Overseas)'', ''British subjects'', and ''British protected persons''. Only British citizens and certain Commonwealth citizens have the automatic right of abode in the UK, with the latter holding residual rights they had prior to 1983.\n\nAside from different categories of a nationality, the 1981 Act also ceased to recognise Commonwealth citizens as British subjects. There remain only two categories of people who are still British subjects: those (formerly known as British subjects without citizenship) who acquired British nationality through a connection with former British India, and those connected with the Republic of Ireland before 1949 who have made a declaration to retain British nationality. British subjects connected with former British India lose British nationality if they acquire another citizenship.\n\nIn spite of the fact that the 1981 Act repealed most of the provisions of the 1948 Act and the nationality clauses in subsequent independence acts, the acquisition of new categories of British nationality created by the 1981 Act was often dependent on nationality status prior to 1 January 1983 (the date the 1981 Act entered into force), so many of the provisions of the 1948 Act and subsequent independence acts are still relevant. Not taking this into account might lead to the erroneous conclusion, for example, that the 1981 Act's repeal of the nationality clauses in the Kenya Independence Act of 1963 restored British nationality to those who lost their CUKC status as a result of [[Kenya]]'s independence in 1963. This is one of the reasons for the complexity of British nationality law; in complicated cases, determining British nationality status requires an examination of several nationality acts in their original form.\n\n==Classes of British nationality==\n{{as of|August 2019}}, there are six classes of British nationality.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080405223352/http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/citizenship-report-full.pdf Lord Goldsmith citizenship review]</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Category\n!Active\n!British<br>passport\n!Consular assistance<br>from UK diplomatic posts\n!Exempt from<br>UK immigration control\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|British Citizen\n|\u2714\ufe0f\n|\u2714\ufe0f\n|\u2714\ufe0f\n|\u2714\ufe0f\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|rowspan=2|[[British Overseas Territories citizen]]\n|rowspan=2|\u2714\ufe0f\n|rowspan=2|\u2714\ufe0f\n|rowspan=2|\u2714\ufe0f\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \u2714\ufe0f<small>([[Gibraltar]])</small>\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \u274c<small>(other territories)</small>\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|[[British Overseas citizen]]\n|\u274c\n|\u2714\ufe0f\n|\u2714\ufe0f\n|\u274c\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|rowspan=2|[[British subject]]\n|rowspan=2|\u274c\n|rowspan=2|\u2714\ufe0f\n|rowspan=2|\u2714\ufe0f\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \u2714\ufe0f<small>(with [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode]])</small>\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \u274c<small>(without [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode]])</small>\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|[[British National (Overseas)]]\n|\u274c\n|\u2714\ufe0f\n|\u2714\ufe0f\n|\u274c\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|[[British protected person]]\n|\u274c\n|\u2714\ufe0f\n|\u2714\ufe0f\n|\u274c\n|}\n\n===Active categories===\nThe following two classes of British nationality are \"active\", meaning that they can be acquired by any eligible person at birth or by naturalisation or registration.\n\n{{anchor|British citizenship}}\n; British citizen\n:Persons who are British citizens usually hold this status through a connection with the [[United Kingdom]], [[Channel Islands]] and [[Isle of Man]] (\"United Kingdom and Islands\"); the [[Falkland Islands]]; or, since 2002, one of the remaining [[British Overseas Territories]] (BOTs), except [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]].<ref>British Overseas Territories Act 2002, c.8.</ref> [[Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies|Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies]] (CUKCs) who possessed [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode]] under the [[Immigration Act 1971]] through a connection with the UK and Islands generally became British citizens on 1 January 1983. This status was also retroactively extended to British Dependent Territories citizens with a connection to the Falkland Islands on 28 March 1983, while the remaining British Dependent Territories citizens who were not solely connected with Akrotiri and Dhekelia acquired the status on 21 May 2002.\n\n:British citizenship is the most common type of British nationality, and the only one that bestows automatic right of abode in the UK.\n\n:Other rights can vary depending on how the British citizenship was acquired. In particular, there are restrictions for \"[[British nationality law#British citizenship by descent|British citizens by descent]]\" when transmitting British citizenship to children born outside the UK. These restrictions do not apply to \"British citizens otherwise than by descent\".\n\n; British Overseas Territories citizen (formerly British Dependent Territories citizen) (BOTC)\n\n:BOTC (formerly BDTC) is the form of British nationality held through connection with any [[British Overseas Territory]] (BOT). It is possible to hold BOTC and British citizenship simultaneously. Nearly all BOTCs are now also British citizens as a result of the [[British Overseas Territories Act 2002]].\n\n===Residual categories===\nThe four residual categories are expected to lapse with the passage of time. They can be passed to children only in exceptional circumstances, e.g., if the child would otherwise be [[Stateless person|stateless]]. There is consequently little provision for the acquisition of these classes of nationality by people who do not already have them. To reduce ''de facto'' statelessness, most are allowed to be registered as British citizens as long as they hold no other citizenship or nationality.\n\n; British Overseas citizen (BOC)\n\n:In general, most BOCs are CUKCs who did not qualify for British citizenship or British Dependent Territories citizenship. Most derived their status as CUKCs from former colonies, such as [[Malaysia]] and [[Kenya]], because of quirks and exceptions in the law that resulted in their retaining CUKC status in spite of the independence of their colonies. This is fairly uncommon: most CUKCs (including those from Malaysia and Kenya) lost their CUKC status upon independence.\n\n:In 1997, BDTCs with a connection to [[Hong Kong]] became BOCs if they did not register as British Nationals (Overseas) and would have become stateless after the withdrawal of BDTC status from Hong Kong residents.\n\n; British subject\n\n:British subjects (as defined in the 1981 Act) are British subjects who were not CUKCs or citizens of any other Commonwealth country. Most derived their status as British subjects from [[British Raj|British India]] or the [[Republic of Ireland]] as they existed before 1949.\n\n; British National (Overseas) (BN(O))\n\n:The status of BN(O) was created by the Hong Kong Act 1985 and the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Order 1986. BN(O)s are BDTCs with a connection to Hong Kong who applied for registration as BN(O)s before the [[handover of Hong Kong]] to the [[People's Republic of China]].\n\n; British protected person (BPP)\n\n:BPPs derive from parts of the [[British Empire]] that were [[protectorate]]s or [[protected state]]s with nominally independent rulers under the \"protection\" of the British Crown, not officially part of the Crown's dominions. The status of BPP is ''[[sui generis]]''{{spaced ndash}}BPPs are not Commonwealth citizens (\"British subjects\", in the old sense) and were not traditionally considered British nationals, but are not aliens either.\n\n===Relationship with right of abode===\nOnly the status of British citizen carries with it the [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode]] in a certain country or territory (in this case, the UK).\n\nIn practice, BOTCs (except those associated with the [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia|Sovereign bases in Cyprus]]) were granted full British citizenship in 2002; BN(O)s have right of abode or right to land in [[Hong Kong]] (note: not conferred by the status itself, but by the Immigration Ordinance of Hong Kong) and are eligible for registration as British citizens if they hold no other nationality under the [[Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009]]; BSs and BPPs lose their statuses upon acquiring another nationality (except BSs connected with the Republic of Ireland) and so should be eligible for registration as British citizens under the [[Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002]].\n\nBritish Overseas citizens are unique in that their nationality status is not associated with a right of residence, and only certain types of BOCs are eligible to be registered as British citizens under the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.\n\n==Acquisition of British citizenship==\nBritish Citizenship can be acquired in the following ways:\n# ''{{lang|la|[[lex soli]]}}'': By birth in the UK or a qualified British Overseas Territory to a parent who is a British citizen at the time of the birth, or to a parent who is settled in the UK or that Overseas Territory\n# ''{{lang|la|[[lex sanguinis]]}}'': By birth abroad, which constitutes \"by descent\" if one of the parents is a British citizen otherwise than by descent (for example by birth, adoption, registration or naturalisation in the UK). British citizenship by descent is only transferable to one generation down from the parent who is a British citizen otherwise than by descent, if the child is born abroad.\n# By [[#British citizenship by naturalisation|naturalisation]]\n# By [[#British citizenship by registration|registration]]\n# By [[#British citizenship by adoption|adoption]]\n\nFor nationality purposes, the [[Channel Islands]] and the [[Isle of Man]] are generally treated as if they were part of the [[United Kingdom|UK]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/554378/AN_Booklet_-__September_2016.pdf|title=Naturalisation Booklet \u2013 The Requirements}}</ref>\n\nInformation about British citizenship and other kinds of British nationality is available from Her Majesty's Government.<ref>{{cite web|title=Types of British nationality|url=https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref> Information is also available on provisions for reducing statelessness.<ref>{{cite web|title=Register as a British Citizen - Stateless People|url=https://www.gov.uk/register-british-citizen/stateless-people|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=10 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nPersons acquiring citizenship by method (2) are called British citizens ''by descent''; those acquiring citizenship by methods (1), (3) or (5) are called British citizens ''otherwise than by descent''. British citizens by registration, method (4), may be either, depending on the circumstances. Only citizens ''otherwise than by descent'' can pass on their citizenship to their children born outside the UK or a British Overseas Territory automatically; British citizens ''by descent'' can pass on citizenship to their non-UK born children only by meeting certain UK residence requirements and registering them before the age of 18.\n\n===British citizenship by birth in the United Kingdom or a qualified British Overseas Territory===\nFrom 1 January 1983, a child born in the UK or the [[Falkland Islands]]<ref>S2(1) of the [[British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983]]</ref> to a parent who is a British citizen or \"settled\" in the UK or the Falkland Islands is automatically a British citizen by birth. This provision is extended to children born to such parents in any remaining [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] other than [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]] after 21 May 2002. Since 13 January 2010, a child born to a parent who is a member of the [[British Armed Forces]] at the time of birth also automatically acquires British citizenship if he or she was born in the UK or a qualified British Overseas Territory.\n* Only one parent needs to meet this requirement.\n* \"Settled\" status usually means the parent is resident in the UK or a [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] and has the [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode]] (or similar status), or holds [[Indefinite Leave to Remain]] (ILR), or is a citizen of an [[European Union|EU]]/[[European Economic Area|EEA]] Member State and has permanent residence, or is otherwise unrestricted by immigration laws to remain in the UK or that Overseas Territory.<ref>\"Settled\" outlined in section 50 of the British Nationality Act 1981 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/61#commentary-c1925606</ref> Irish citizens in the UK are deemed settled for this purpose.\n* To qualify under the armed forces provision, the parent must be a member of the armed forces at the time of the child's birth.\n* Special rules exist for cases where a parent of a child is a citizen of a [[European Union]] or [[European Economic Area]] Member State, or [[Switzerland]]. The law in this respect was changed on 2 October 2000 and 30 April 2006. See [[British nationality law#Citizens of EEA States and Switzerland|below]] for details.\n* For children born before 1 July 2006, if only the father meets this requirement, the parents must be married. Marriage subsequent to the birth is normally enough to confer British citizenship from that point.\n* Where the father is not married to the mother, the Home Office usually registers the child as British provided an application is made and the child would have been British otherwise. The child must be under 18 on the date of application.\n* Where, after the child's birth, a parent subsequently acquires British citizenship or \"settled\" status, the child can be registered as a British citizen using Form MN1 provided he/she is aged under 18.<ref name=\"BNA1981s1(3)\">[[British Nationality Act 1981]], Section 1(3)</ref><ref name=\"RegisterBornAfter1983\"/>\n* If the child lives in the UK until the age of 10, there is a lifetime entitlement to register as a British citizen using Form T. The immigration status of the child and his/her parents is irrelevant. During each of the first 10 years of the child's life, he/she must not have spent over 90 days outside the UK (unless there were \"special circumstances\").

CUKCs without a connection to the UK became either British Overseas Territories citizens or British Overseas citizens in 1983, depending on whether they had a connection to another BOT.\n\nThe only exception to this rule were children of diplomats and enemy aliens. This exception did not apply to most visiting forces, so, in general, children born in the UK before 1983 to visiting military personnel (e.g. US forces stationed in the UK) were CUKCs connected to the UK and would become British citizens in 1983, albeit as a second nationality.\n\n===British citizenship by descent===\n{{anchor|British citizenship by descent}}\"British citizenship by descent\" is the category for children born outside the UK or an Overseas Territory to a British citizen. Rules for acquiring British citizenship by descent depend on when the person was born.\n\n====From 1983====\nA child born outside the UK, Gibraltar or the Falkland Islands on or after 1 January 1983 (or outside another British Overseas Territory on or after 21 May 2002) automatically acquires British citizenship ''by descent'' if either parent is a British citizen'' otherwise than by descent'' at the time of the child's birth. \n* At least one parent must be a British citizen ''otherwise than by descent''.\n* As a general rule, an unmarried father cannot pass on British citizenship automatically in the case of a child born before 1 July 2006. If the parents marry subsequent to the birth, the child normally becomes a British citizen at that point if ''legitimated'' by the marriage and the father was eligible to pass on British citizenship. If the unmarried British father was residing in a country that treated (at the date of birth of the child born before 1 July 2006) a child born to unmarried parents in the same way as a child born to married parents, then the father passed on British citizenship automatically to his child, even though the child was born before 1 July 2006 to unmarried parents.<ref>See chapter on \u201cLegitimacy\u201d in UK Border Agency Nationality Instructions, Volume 2, Section 2, paragraphs 1.1, 1.2 and 5.1.2 (second example). http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/policyandlaw/nationalityinstructions/nisec2gensec/legitimacy?view=Binary</ref> Such countries are listed in the UK Home Office Immigration and Passport Services publication \"Legitimation and Domicile\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/agencies-public-bodies/ips/passports-policy-publications/legitimation-and-domicile?view=Binary|title=Legitimation and domicile}}</ref>\n* Where the parent is a British citizen ''by descent'', additional requirements apply. In the most common scenario, the parent is normally expected to have lived in the UK for three consecutive years and apply to register the child as a British citizen while the child is a minor (clause 43, [[Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009]], effective from 13 January 2010). Prior to this date, the age limit was 12 months.\n* Before 21 May 2002, all British Overseas Territories except two were treated as 'overseas' for nationality purposes. The exceptions were [[Gibraltar]], where residents are eligible to register as British citizens under section 5 the [[British Nationality Act 1981]]; and the Falkland Islands, granted British citizenship following the [[Falklands War]] under the [[British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983]]. Hence, children born to such parents on a British Overseas Territory other than those listed above acquired British citizenship ''by descent'' if they were born prior to 21 May 2002, while children born on or after that day on a British Overseas Territory (other than [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]]) acquired British citizenship ''otherwise than by descent'' as UK-born children.\n* Children born overseas to parents on ''Crown Service'' are normally granted British citizenship ''otherwise than by descent'', so their status is the same as it would have been had they been born in the UK.\n* In exceptional cases, the Home Secretary may register a child of parents who are British ''by descent'' as a British citizen under discretionary provisions, for example if the child is stateless, or a second or subsequent generation born abroad into a British citizen family with strong links with the UK, or in 'compassionate circumstances'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/420396/chapter_9_changes_re_s65_150402.pdf|title=Home Office Nationality Instructions (Chapter 9: Registration of Minors at Discretion), Section 9.12}}</ref>\n\n====Before 1983====\nBefore 1983, as a general rule CUKC status was transmitted automatically only for one generation, with registration in infancy possible for subsequent generations. Transmission was from the father only, and only if the parents were married. (See [[History of British nationality law]].)\n\nIn 1979 the Home Office had begun to take quiet steps to address this gender discrimination by allowing British citizen mothers to register children born abroad at the local British consulate within one year of birth, just as British citizen fathers could.<ref name=Romein /><ref name=RomeinCSIH /> However, the change was without great publicity and was largely unnoticed, and in 2002, Parliament formalized the approach in law, by enacting amendments to the British Nationality Act 1981 allowing children who had been covered by the 1979 procedural change (because they were under 18 years old at that time) to register themselves at any point later in life.<ref name=Romein /><ref name=RomeinCSIH /> The class of eligible registrants was later expanded in 2009, and was upheld by a 2018 UK Supreme Court ruling.<ref name=Romein /><ref name=RomeinCSIH />\n\nSeveral laws also accorded a right of registration to children born of unmarried British citizen fathers.\n\n====Children ineligible for British citizenship at birth====\n{{see also|#British citizenship by registration}}\nChildren born outside the UK before 1 January 1983 to a CUKC mother who became a British citizen on 1 January 1983 and a foreign father are not British citizens by birth, and neither are children born between 1 January 1983 to 1 July 2006 to a British citizen father and a foreign mother out of wedlock.\n\nIn the face of various concerns over gender equality, human rights, and treaty obligations, Parliament moved to act on these situations.<ref name=RomeinCSIH>{{cite BAILII|litigants=Shelley Elizabeth Romein v The Advocate General for Scotland on behalf of The Secretary of State for the Home Department |link= |court=ScotCS  |scotcase=CSIH |year=2016 |num=24 |format = 2 |parallelcite= [2017] INLR 76, 2016 SCLR 789, [2016] Imm AR 909  |date=1 April 2016 |courtname=auto}} [http://www.bailii.org/scot/cases/ScotCS/2016/%5B2016%5DCSIH24.html http://www.bailii.org/scot/cases/ScotCS/2016/[2016<nowiki>]</nowiki>CSIH24.html]</ref>\n\nThe [[Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002]] inserted a section 4C into the British Nationality Act 1981 allowing for registration as a British citizen of any person born between 7 February 1961 and 1 January 1983 who would have become a CUKC if the British Nationality Act 1948 had provided for mothers to transmit citizenship in the same way that fathers could.<ref name=NIAA2002>{{Cite legislation UK | type = act  | year = 2002  | chapter = 41  | act = Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 | section =13}}</ref> The [[Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009]] then expanded the earliest date of birth covered from 1961 to 1 January 1949, and elaborated in \"a dense and at times impenetrable piece of drafting\"<ref name=ScottishLegal>{{cite web |url=https://www.scottishlegal.com/article/u-s-woman-wins-appeal-against-unlawful-decision-to-refuse-british-citizenship |title=U.S. woman wins appeal against 'unlawful' decision to refuse British citizenship |date=4 April 2016 |publisher=Scottish Legal News Ltd |access-date=1 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=RomeinCSIH /> on the section's approach, while also covering numerous additional and less common situations, and adding a good character requirement.<ref name=BCIA2009>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2009/pdf/ukpga_20090011_en.pdf |title=newbook.book |date= |accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nRegistration through this method is performed with Form UKM.

Usually this is granted provided the Secretary of State accepts the adoption is ''bona fide'' and the child would have been a British citizen if the natural child of the adopters. Usually the adoption must have taken place under the law of a 'designated country' (most developed nations along with some others are 'designated' for this purpose) and be recognised in the UK. This is the standard method for children adopted by British citizens permanently resident overseas to acquire British citizenship.\n\nThe cancellation or annulment of an adoption order does not cause loss of British citizenship acquired by that adoption.\n\nBritish children adopted by non-British nationals do not lose British nationality, even if they acquire a foreign nationality as a result of the adoption.\n\nAny person who obtains British nationality by this method is British otherwise than by descent, which means they have the same status as those born or naturalised in the UK and can pass on British nationality to their children.\n\n===British citizenship by naturalisation===\nNaturalisation as a British citizen is at the discretion of the [[Home Secretary]], who may grant British citizenship to anyone they \"think fit\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Primary&PageNumber=2&Year=1981&NavFrom=2&parentActiveTextDocId=1360590&ActiveTextDocId=1360600&filesize=1152 |title=British Nationality Act 1981 (c. 61) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date=5 December 2005 |accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref> Although the Home Office sets down official requirements for naturalisation they may waive any of them, or may refuse citizenship to a person even if they meet all of the requirements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Primary&PageNumber=2&Year=1981&NavFrom=2&parentActiveTextDocId=1360590&ActiveTextDocId=1360662&filesize=1511 |title=British Nationality Act 1981 (c. 61) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref> However, applications for naturalisation are normally granted if the requirements are met.\n\n====Requirements for the applicants====\nThe requirements for naturalisation as a British citizen depend on whether or not one is the spouse or [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partner]] of a British citizen.\n\nFor those married to or in a civil partnership with a British citizen, the applicant must:\n* Have held [[indefinite leave to remain]] in the UK (or an \"equivalent\" for this purpose, such as the right of abode, [[Irish nationality law|Irish citizenship]], or permanent residency as a citizen of an EU/EEA country or a family member of one) at the time they apply for naturalisation.

The Home Secretary has delegated his powers to grant BOTC to the Governors of the Overseas Territories. Only in exceptional cases is a person naturalised as a BOTC by the Home Office in the UK.\n\n==Acquisition of other categories of British nationality==\nIt is unusual for a person to be able to acquire British Overseas citizenship, British subject or British protected person status. They are not generally transmissible by descent, nor are they open to acquisition by registration, except for certain instances to prevent [[Stateless person|statelessness]]. It is also not possible for any person to acquire British National (Overseas) status as the registration period for such status had permanently ended on 31 December 1997.\n\nThe [[Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002]] granted British Overseas Citizens, British Subjects and British Protected Persons the right to register as British citizens if they have no other citizenship or nationality and have not after 4 July 2002 renounced, voluntarily relinquished or lost through action or inaction any citizenship or nationality. Previously such persons would have not had the right of abode in any country, and would have thus been ''de facto'' stateless.

The remaining few became British Overseas citizens.\n\nBefore the handover in 1997, former BDTCs from Hong Kong had been able to acquire British citizenship under legislation passed in 1990, 1996 and 1997. In other cases, certain persons may already hold British citizenship as a matter of entitlement or through registration under normal procedures.\n\nAlthough it is no longer possible to acquire British National (Overseas) status after 31 December 1997, stateless children born to such parents are entitled to British Overseas citizenship and can subsequently apply to register as British citizens under the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. Since 2009, BN(O)s without other nationalities or citizenship are able to register as British citizens under the [[Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009]] as well.\n\nBritish citizens and BN(O)s who are of full or partial Chinese descent are also Chinese nationals under Chinese law unless they have renounced their Chinese nationality with the [[Hong Kong SAR Government]]. As China does not recognise multiple nationality, those persons are considered by China as solely Chinese nationals before and after the handover of Hong Kong and hence are not eligible for [[consular protection]] when on Chinese soil. Although holding the same nationality under the Chinese nationality law, Chinese nationals with a connection to Hong Kong or Macau have been categorised differently from Chinese nationals domiciled in [[Mainland China]].\n\nIn February 2006, in response to extensive representations made by Lord Avebury and Tameem Ebrahim,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcitizen.info/CitizenshipDenied_HO_Submission.pdf|title=britishcitizen.info}}</ref> British authorities announced that 600 British citizenship applications of ethnic minority children of Indian descent from Hong Kong were wrongly refused.<ref>https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldlwa/060228wa1.pdf</ref> The applications dated from the period July 1997 onwards.

Where such a person acquired a right of abode in the UK before 1983, it is possible for British citizenship to have been acquired. See also [[History of British nationality law]] and [[Sophia Naturalization Act 1705]].\n\n==Loss of British nationality==\n\n===Renunciation and resumption of British nationality===\nAll categories of British nationality can be renounced by a declaration made to the [[Secretary of State for the Home Department|Home Secretary]]. A person ceases to be a British national on the date the Home Secretary registers the declaration of renunciation. If a declaration is registered in the expectation of acquiring another citizenship but one is not acquired within six months of the registration, it does not take effect and the person remains a British national.\n\nRenunciations made to other authorities (such as the [[Oath of Allegiance (United States)|general renunciation made as part of the US naturalisation ceremony]]) are not recognised by the UK. The forms must be sent through the UK Border Agency's citizenship renunciation process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/britishcitizenship/givingupcitizenship/ |title=UK Border Agency &#124; How do I give up British citizenship or another form of British nationality? |publisher=Bia.homeoffice.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref>\nThere are provisions for the resumption of British citizenship or British overseas territories citizenship renounced for the purpose of gaining or retaining another citizenship.

Until the early 1960s there was little difference, if any, in UK law between the rights of CUKCs and other British subjects, all of whom had the right at any time to enter, live and work in the UK.\n\nIndependence acts, passed when the remaining colonies were granted independence, contained nationality provisions. In general, these provisions withdrew CUKC status from anyone who became a citizen of the newly independent country, unless the person had a connection with the UK or a remaining colony (e.g. through birth in the UK). Exceptions were sometimes made in cases where the colonies did not become independent (notable cases include the [[Crown Colony of Penang]] and the [[Crown Colony of Malacca]], which were made part of the [[Federation of Malaya]] in 1957; CUKC status was not withdrawn from CUKCs from Penang and Malacca even though they automatically acquired Malayan citizenship at the time of independence).\n\nBetween 1962 and 1971, as a result of fears about increasing immigration by Commonwealth citizens, the UK gradually tightened controls on immigration by British subjects from other parts of the Commonwealth, which included CUKCs without familial or residential ties to the UK. The [[Immigration Act 1971]] introduced the concept of ''patriality'', by which only British subjects (i.e. CUKCs and Commonwealth citizens) with sufficiently strong links to the [[British Islands]] (e.g. being born in the islands or having a parent or a grandparent who was born there) had ''[[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode]]'', meaning they were exempt from immigration control and had the right to enter, live and work in the islands. The act, therefore, had ''de facto'' created two types of CUKCs: those with right of abode in the UK, and those without right of abode in the UK (who might or might not have right of abode in a Crown colony or another country). Despite differences in immigration status being created, there was no ''de jure'' difference between the two in a nationality context, as the 1948 Act still specified one tier of citizenship throughout the UK and its colonies. This changed in 1983, when the 1948 Act was replaced by a multi-tier nationality system.\n\nThe current principal British nationality law in force, since 1 January 1983, is the [[British Nationality Act 1981]], which established the system of multiple categories of British nationality. To date, six tiers were created: ''British citizens'', ''British Overseas Territories citizens'', ''British Overseas citizens'', ''British Nationals (Overseas)'', ''British subjects'', and ''British protected persons''. Only British citizens and certain Commonwealth citizens have the automatic right of abode in the UK, with the latter holding residual rights they had prior to 1983.\n\nAside from different categories of a nationality, the 1981 Act also ceased to recognise Commonwealth citizens as British subjects. There remain only two categories of people who are still British subjects: those (formerly known as British subjects without citizenship) who acquired British nationality through a connection with former British India, and those connected with the Republic of Ireland before 1949 who have made a declaration to retain British nationality. British subjects connected with former British India lose British nationality if they acquire another citizenship.\n\nIn spite of the fact that the 1981 Act repealed most of the provisions of the 1948 Act and the nationality clauses in subsequent independence acts, the acquisition of new categories of British nationality created by the 1981 Act was often dependent on nationality status prior to 1 January 1983 (the date the 1981 Act entered into force), so many of the provisions of the 1948 Act and subsequent independence acts are still relevant. Not taking this into account might lead to the erroneous conclusion, for example, that the 1981 Act's repeal of the nationality clauses in the Kenya Independence Act of 1963 restored British nationality to those who lost their CUKC status as a result of [[Kenya]]'s independence in 1963. This is one of the reasons for the complexity of British nationality law; in complicated cases, determining British nationality status requires an examination of several nationality acts in their original form.\n\n==Classes of British nationality==\n{{as of|August 2019}}, there are six classes of British nationality.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080405223352/http://www.justice.gov.uk/docs/citizenship-report-full.pdf Lord Goldsmith citizenship review]</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Category\n!Active\n!British<br>passport\n!Consular assistance<br>from UK diplomatic posts\n!Exempt from<br>UK immigration control\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|British Citizen\n|\u2714\ufe0f\n|\u2714\ufe0f\n|\u2714\ufe0f\n|\u2714\ufe0f\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|rowspan=2|[[British Overseas Territories citizen]]\n|rowspan=2|\u2714\ufe0f\n|rowspan=2|\u2714\ufe0f\n|rowspan=2|\u2714\ufe0f\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \u2714\ufe0f<small>([[Gibraltar]])</small>\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \u274c<small>(other territories)</small>\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|[[British Overseas citizen]]\n|\u274c\n|\u2714\ufe0f\n|\u2714\ufe0f\n|\u274c\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|rowspan=2|[[British subject]]\n|rowspan=2|\u274c\n|rowspan=2|\u2714\ufe0f\n|rowspan=2|\u2714\ufe0f\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \u2714\ufe0f<small>(with [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode]])</small>\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \u274c<small>(without [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode]])</small>\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|[[British National (Overseas)]]\n|\u274c\n|\u2714\ufe0f\n|\u2714\ufe0f\n|\u274c\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|[[British protected person]]\n|\u274c\n|\u2714\ufe0f\n|\u2714\ufe0f\n|\u274c\n|}\n\n===Active categories===\nThe following two classes of British nationality are \"active\", meaning that they can be acquired by any eligible person at birth or by naturalisation or registration.\n\n{{anchor|British citizenship}}\n; British citizen\n:Persons who are British citizens usually hold this status through a connection with the [[United Kingdom]], [[Channel Islands]] and [[Isle of Man]] (\"United Kingdom and Islands\"); the [[Falkland Islands]]; or, since 2002, one of the remaining [[British Overseas Territories]] (BOTs), except [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]].<ref>British Overseas Territories Act 2002, c.8.</ref> [[Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies|Citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies]] (CUKCs) who possessed [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode]] under the [[Immigration Act 1971]] through a connection with the UK and Islands generally became British citizens on 1 January 1983. This status was also retroactively extended to British Dependent Territories citizens with a connection to the Falkland Islands on 28 March 1983, while the remaining British Dependent Territories citizens who were not solely connected with Akrotiri and Dhekelia acquired the status on 21 May 2002.\n\n:British citizenship is the most common type of British nationality, and the only one that bestows automatic right of abode in the UK.\n\n:Other rights can vary depending on how the British citizenship was acquired. In particular, there are restrictions for \"[[British nationality law#British citizenship by descent|British citizens by descent]]\" when transmitting British citizenship to children born outside the UK. These restrictions do not apply to \"British citizens otherwise than by descent\".\n\n; British Overseas Territories citizen (formerly British Dependent Territories citizen) (BOTC)\n\n:BOTC (formerly BDTC) is the form of British nationality held through connection with any [[British Overseas Territory]] (BOT). It is possible to hold BOTC and British citizenship simultaneously. Nearly all BOTCs are now also British citizens as a result of the [[British Overseas Territories Act 2002]].\n\n===Residual categories===\nThe four residual categories are expected to lapse with the passage of time. They can be passed to children only in exceptional circumstances, e.g., if the child would otherwise be [[Stateless person|stateless]]. There is consequently little provision for the acquisition of these classes of nationality by people who do not already have them. To reduce ''de facto'' statelessness, most are allowed to be registered as British citizens as long as they hold no other citizenship or nationality.\n\n; British Overseas citizen (BOC)\n\n:In general, most BOCs are CUKCs who did not qualify for British citizenship or British Dependent Territories citizenship. Most derived their status as CUKCs from former colonies, such as [[Malaysia]] and [[Kenya]], because of quirks and exceptions in the law that resulted in their retaining CUKC status in spite of the independence of their colonies. This is fairly uncommon: most CUKCs (including those from Malaysia and Kenya) lost their CUKC status upon independence.\n\n:In 1997, BDTCs with a connection to [[Hong Kong]] became BOCs if they did not register as British Nationals (Overseas) and would have become stateless after the withdrawal of BDTC status from Hong Kong residents.\n\n; British subject\n\n:British subjects (as defined in the 1981 Act) are British subjects who were not CUKCs or citizens of any other Commonwealth country. Most derived their status as British subjects from [[British Raj|British India]] or the [[Republic of Ireland]] as they existed before 1949.\n\n; British National (Overseas) (BN(O))\n\n:The status of BN(O) was created by the Hong Kong Act 1985 and the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Order 1986. BN(O)s are BDTCs with a connection to Hong Kong who applied for registration as BN(O)s before the [[handover of Hong Kong]] to the [[People's Republic of China]].\n\n; British protected person (BPP)\n\n:BPPs derive from parts of the [[British Empire]] that were [[protectorate]]s or [[protected state]]s with nominally independent rulers under the \"protection\" of the British Crown, not officially part of the Crown's dominions. The status of BPP is ''[[sui generis]]''{{spaced ndash}}BPPs are not Commonwealth citizens (\"British subjects\", in the old sense) and were not traditionally considered British nationals, but are not aliens either.\n\n===Relationship with right of abode===\nOnly the status of British citizen carries with it the [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode]] in a certain country or territory (in this case, the UK).\n\nIn practice, BOTCs (except those associated with the [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia|Sovereign bases in Cyprus]]) were granted full British citizenship in 2002; BN(O)s have right of abode or right to land in [[Hong Kong]] (note: not conferred by the status itself, but by the Immigration Ordinance of Hong Kong) and are eligible for registration as British citizens if they hold no other nationality under the [[Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009]]; BSs and BPPs lose their statuses upon acquiring another nationality (except BSs connected with the Republic of Ireland) and so should be eligible for registration as British citizens under the [[Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002]].\n\nBritish Overseas citizens are unique in that their nationality status is not associated with a right of residence, and only certain types of BOCs are eligible to be registered as British citizens under the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.\n\n==Acquisition of British citizenship==\nBritish Citizenship can be acquired in the following ways:\n# ''{{lang|la|[[lex soli]]}}'': By birth in the UK or a qualified British Overseas Territory to a parent who is a British citizen at the time of the birth, or to a parent who is settled in the UK or that Overseas Territory\n# ''{{lang|la|[[lex sanguinis]]}}'': By birth abroad, which constitutes \"by descent\" if one of the parents is a British citizen otherwise than by descent (for example by birth, adoption, registration or naturalisation in the UK). British citizenship by descent is only transferable to one generation down from the parent who is a British citizen otherwise than by descent, if the child is born abroad.\n# By [[#British citizenship by naturalisation|naturalisation]]\n# By [[#British citizenship by registration|registration]]\n# By [[#British citizenship by adoption|adoption]]\n\nFor nationality purposes, the [[Channel Islands]] and the [[Isle of Man]] are generally treated as if they were part of the [[United Kingdom|UK]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/554378/AN_Booklet_-__September_2016.pdf|title=Naturalisation Booklet \u2013 The Requirements}}</ref>\n\nInformation about British citizenship and other kinds of British nationality is available from Her Majesty's Government.<ref>{{cite web|title=Types of British nationality|url=https://www.gov.uk/types-of-british-nationality|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref> Information is also available on provisions for reducing statelessness.<ref>{{cite web|title=Register as a British Citizen - Stateless People|url=https://www.gov.uk/register-british-citizen/stateless-people|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=10 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nPersons acquiring citizenship by method (2) are called British citizens ''by descent''; those acquiring citizenship by methods (1), (3) or (5) are called British citizens ''otherwise than by descent''. British citizens by registration, method (4), may be either, depending on the circumstances. Only citizens ''otherwise than by descent'' can pass on their citizenship to their children born outside the UK or a British Overseas Territory automatically; British citizens ''by descent'' can pass on citizenship to their non-UK born children only by meeting certain UK residence requirements and registering them before the age of 18.\n\n===British citizenship by birth in the United Kingdom or a qualified British Overseas Territory===\nFrom 1 January 1983, a child born in the UK or the [[Falkland Islands]]<ref>S2(1) of the [[British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983]]</ref> to a parent who is a British citizen or \"settled\" in the UK or the Falkland Islands is automatically a British citizen by birth. This provision is extended to children born to such parents in any remaining [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] other than [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]] after 21 May 2002. Since 13 January 2010, a child born to a parent who is a member of the [[British Armed Forces]] at the time of birth also automatically acquires British citizenship if he or she was born in the UK or a qualified British Overseas Territory.\n* Only one parent needs to meet this requirement.\n* \"Settled\" status usually means the parent is resident in the UK or a [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] and has the [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode]] (or similar status), or holds [[Indefinite Leave to Remain]] (ILR), or is a citizen of an [[European Union|EU]]/[[European Economic Area|EEA]] Member State and has permanent residence, or is otherwise unrestricted by immigration laws to remain in the UK or that Overseas Territory.<ref>\"Settled\" outlined in section 50 of the British Nationality Act 1981 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/61#commentary-c1925606</ref> Irish citizens in the UK are deemed settled for this purpose.\n* To qualify under the armed forces provision, the parent must be a member of the armed forces at the time of the child's birth.\n* Special rules exist for cases where a parent of a child is a citizen of a [[European Union]] or [[European Economic Area]] Member State, or [[Switzerland]]. The law in this respect was changed on 2 October 2000 and 30 April 2006. See [[British nationality law#Citizens of EEA States and Switzerland|below]] for details.\n* For children born before 1 July 2006, if only the father meets this requirement, the parents must be married. Marriage subsequent to the birth is normally enough to confer British citizenship from that point.\n* Where the father is not married to the mother, the Home Office usually registers the child as British provided an application is made and the child would have been British otherwise. The child must be under 18 on the date of application.\n* Where, after the child's birth, a parent subsequently acquires British citizenship or \"settled\" status, the child can be registered as a British citizen using Form MN1 provided he/she is aged under 18.<ref name=\"BNA1981s1(3)\">[[British Nationality Act 1981]], Section 1(3)</ref><ref name=\"RegisterBornAfter1983\"/>\n* If the child lives in the UK until the age of 10, there is a lifetime entitlement to register as a British citizen using Form T. The immigration status of the child and his/her parents is irrelevant. During each of the first 10 years of the child's life, he/she must not have spent over 90 days outside the UK (unless there were \"special circumstances\").

CUKCs without a connection to the UK became either British Overseas Territories citizens or British Overseas citizens in 1983, depending on whether they had a connection to another BOT.\n\nThe only exception to this rule were children of diplomats and enemy aliens. This exception did not apply to most visiting forces, so, in general, children born in the UK before 1983 to visiting military personnel (e.g. US forces stationed in the UK) were CUKCs connected to the UK and would become British citizens in 1983, albeit as a second nationality.\n\n===British citizenship by descent===\n{{anchor|British citizenship by descent}}\"British citizenship by descent\" is the category for children born outside the UK or an Overseas Territory to a British citizen. Rules for acquiring British citizenship by descent depend on when the person was born.\n\n====From 1983====\nA child born outside the UK, Gibraltar or the Falkland Islands on or after 1 January 1983 (or outside another British Overseas Territory on or after 21 May 2002) automatically acquires British citizenship ''by descent'' if either parent is a British citizen'' otherwise than by descent'' at the time of the child's birth. \n* At least one parent must be a British citizen ''otherwise than by descent''.\n* As a general rule, an unmarried father cannot pass on British citizenship automatically in the case of a child born before 1 July 2006. If the parents marry subsequent to the birth, the child normally becomes a British citizen at that point if ''legitimated'' by the marriage and the father was eligible to pass on British citizenship. If the unmarried British father was residing in a country that treated (at the date of birth of the child born before 1 July 2006) a child born to unmarried parents in the same way as a child born to married parents, then the father passed on British citizenship automatically to his child, even though the child was born before 1 July 2006 to unmarried parents.<ref>See chapter on \u201cLegitimacy\u201d in UK Border Agency Nationality Instructions, Volume 2, Section 2, paragraphs 1.1, 1.2 and 5.1.2 (second example). http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/policyandlaw/nationalityinstructions/nisec2gensec/legitimacy?view=Binary</ref> Such countries are listed in the UK Home Office Immigration and Passport Services publication \"Legitimation and Domicile\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/agencies-public-bodies/ips/passports-policy-publications/legitimation-and-domicile?view=Binary|title=Legitimation and domicile}}</ref>\n* Where the parent is a British citizen ''by descent'', additional requirements apply. In the most common scenario, the parent is normally expected to have lived in the UK for three consecutive years and apply to register the child as a British citizen while the child is a minor (clause 43, [[Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009]], effective from 13 January 2010). Prior to this date, the age limit was 12 months.\n* Before 21 May 2002, all British Overseas Territories except two were treated as 'overseas' for nationality purposes. The exceptions were [[Gibraltar]], where residents are eligible to register as British citizens under section 5 the [[British Nationality Act 1981]]; and the Falkland Islands, granted British citizenship following the [[Falklands War]] under the [[British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983]]. Hence, children born to such parents on a British Overseas Territory other than those listed above acquired British citizenship ''by descent'' if they were born prior to 21 May 2002, while children born on or after that day on a British Overseas Territory (other than [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]]) acquired British citizenship ''otherwise than by descent'' as UK-born children.\n* Children born overseas to parents on ''Crown Service'' are normally granted British citizenship ''otherwise than by descent'', so their status is the same as it would have been had they been born in the UK.\n* In exceptional cases, the Home Secretary may register a child of parents who are British ''by descent'' as a British citizen under discretionary provisions, for example if the child is stateless, or a second or subsequent generation born abroad into a British citizen family with strong links with the UK, or in 'compassionate circumstances'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/420396/chapter_9_changes_re_s65_150402.pdf|title=Home Office Nationality Instructions (Chapter 9: Registration of Minors at Discretion), Section 9.12}}</ref>\n\n====Before 1983====\nBefore 1983, as a general rule CUKC status was transmitted automatically only for one generation, with registration in infancy possible for subsequent generations. Transmission was from the father only, and only if the parents were married. (See [[History of British nationality law]].)\n\nIn 1979 the Home Office had begun to take quiet steps to address this gender discrimination by allowing British citizen mothers to register children born abroad at the local British consulate within one year of birth, just as British citizen fathers could.<ref name=Romein /><ref name=RomeinCSIH /> However, the change was without great publicity and was largely unnoticed, and in 2002, Parliament formalized the approach in law, by enacting amendments to the British Nationality Act 1981 allowing children who had been covered by the 1979 procedural change (because they were under 18 years old at that time) to register themselves at any point later in life.<ref name=Romein /><ref name=RomeinCSIH /> The class of eligible registrants was later expanded in 2009, and was upheld by a 2018 UK Supreme Court ruling.<ref name=Romein /><ref name=RomeinCSIH />\n\nSeveral laws also accorded a right of registration to children born of unmarried British citizen fathers.\n\n====Children ineligible for British citizenship at birth====\n{{see also|#British citizenship by registration}}\nChildren born outside the UK before 1 January 1983 to a CUKC mother who became a British citizen on 1 January 1983 and a foreign father are not British citizens by birth, and neither are children born between 1 January 1983 to 1 July 2006 to a British citizen father and a foreign mother out of wedlock.\n\nIn the face of various concerns over gender equality, human rights, and treaty obligations, Parliament moved to act on these situations.<ref name=RomeinCSIH>{{cite BAILII|litigants=Shelley Elizabeth Romein v The Advocate General for Scotland on behalf of The Secretary of State for the Home Department |link= |court=ScotCS  |scotcase=CSIH |year=2016 |num=24 |format = 2 |parallelcite= [2017] INLR 76, 2016 SCLR 789, [2016] Imm AR 909  |date=1 April 2016 |courtname=auto}} [http://www.bailii.org/scot/cases/ScotCS/2016/%5B2016%5DCSIH24.html http://www.bailii.org/scot/cases/ScotCS/2016/[2016<nowiki>]</nowiki>CSIH24.html]</ref>\n\nThe [[Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002]] inserted a section 4C into the British Nationality Act 1981 allowing for registration as a British citizen of any person born between 7 February 1961 and 1 January 1983 who would have become a CUKC if the British Nationality Act 1948 had provided for mothers to transmit citizenship in the same way that fathers could.<ref name=NIAA2002>{{Cite legislation UK | type = act  | year = 2002  | chapter = 41  | act = Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 | section =13}}</ref> The [[Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009]] then expanded the earliest date of birth covered from 1961 to 1 January 1949, and elaborated in \"a dense and at times impenetrable piece of drafting\"<ref name=ScottishLegal>{{cite web |url=https://www.scottishlegal.com/article/u-s-woman-wins-appeal-against-unlawful-decision-to-refuse-british-citizenship |title=U.S. woman wins appeal against 'unlawful' decision to refuse British citizenship |date=4 April 2016 |publisher=Scottish Legal News Ltd |access-date=1 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=RomeinCSIH /> on the section's approach, while also covering numerous additional and less common situations, and adding a good character requirement.<ref name=BCIA2009>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2009/pdf/ukpga_20090011_en.pdf |title=newbook.book |date= |accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nRegistration through this method is performed with Form UKM.

Usually this is granted provided the Secretary of State accepts the adoption is ''bona fide'' and the child would have been a British citizen if the natural child of the adopters. Usually the adoption must have taken place under the law of a 'designated country' (most developed nations along with some others are 'designated' for this purpose) and be recognised in the UK. This is the standard method for children adopted by British citizens permanently resident overseas to acquire British citizenship.\n\nThe cancellation or annulment of an adoption order does not cause loss of British citizenship acquired by that adoption.\n\nBritish children adopted by non-British nationals do not lose British nationality, even if they acquire a foreign nationality as a result of the adoption.\n\nAny person who obtains British nationality by this method is British otherwise than by descent, which means they have the same status as those born or naturalised in the UK and can pass on British nationality to their children.\n\n===British citizenship by naturalisation===\nNaturalisation as a British citizen is at the discretion of the [[Home Secretary]], who may grant British citizenship to anyone they \"think fit\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Primary&PageNumber=2&Year=1981&NavFrom=2&parentActiveTextDocId=1360590&ActiveTextDocId=1360600&filesize=1152 |title=British Nationality Act 1981 (c. 61) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date=5 December 2005 |accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref> Although the Home Office sets down official requirements for naturalisation they may waive any of them, or may refuse citizenship to a person even if they meet all of the requirements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Primary&PageNumber=2&Year=1981&NavFrom=2&parentActiveTextDocId=1360590&ActiveTextDocId=1360662&filesize=1511 |title=British Nationality Act 1981 (c. 61) - Statute Law Database |publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref> However, applications for naturalisation are normally granted if the requirements are met.\n\n====Requirements for the applicants====\nThe requirements for naturalisation as a British citizen depend on whether or not one is the spouse or [[Civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partner]] of a British citizen.\n\nFor those married to or in a civil partnership with a British citizen, the applicant must:\n* Have held [[indefinite leave to remain]] in the UK (or an \"equivalent\" for this purpose, such as the right of abode, [[Irish nationality law|Irish citizenship]], or permanent residency as a citizen of an EU/EEA country or a family member of one) at the time they apply for naturalisation.

The Home Secretary has delegated his powers to grant BOTC to the Governors of the Overseas Territories. Only in exceptional cases is a person naturalised as a BOTC by the Home Office in the UK.\n\n==Acquisition of other categories of British nationality==\nIt is unusual for a person to be able to acquire British Overseas citizenship, British subject or British protected person status. They are not generally transmissible by descent, nor are they open to acquisition by registration, except for certain instances to prevent [[Stateless person|statelessness]]. It is also not possible for any person to acquire British National (Overseas) status as the registration period for such status had permanently ended on 31 December 1997.\n\nThe [[Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002]] granted British Overseas Citizens, British Subjects and British Protected Persons the right to register as British citizens if they have no other citizenship or nationality and have not after 4 July 2002 renounced, voluntarily relinquished or lost through action or inaction any citizenship or nationality. Previously such persons would have not had the right of abode in any country, and would have thus been ''de facto'' stateless.

The remaining few became British Overseas citizens.\n\nBefore the handover in 1997, former BDTCs from Hong Kong had been able to acquire British citizenship under legislation passed in 1990, 1996 and 1997. In other cases, certain persons may already hold British citizenship as a matter of entitlement or through registration under normal procedures.\n\nAlthough it is no longer possible to acquire British National (Overseas) status after 31 December 1997, stateless children born to such parents are entitled to British Overseas citizenship and can subsequently apply to register as British citizens under the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. Since 2009, BN(O)s without other nationalities or citizenship are able to register as British citizens under the [[Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009]] as well.\n\nBritish citizens and BN(O)s who are of full or partial Chinese descent are also Chinese nationals under Chinese law unless they have renounced their Chinese nationality with the [[Hong Kong SAR Government]]. As China does not recognise multiple nationality, those persons are considered by China as solely Chinese nationals before and after the handover of Hong Kong and hence are not eligible for [[consular protection]] when on Chinese soil. Although holding the same nationality under the Chinese nationality law, Chinese nationals with a connection to Hong Kong or Macau have been categorised differently from Chinese nationals domiciled in [[Mainland China]].\n\nIn February 2006, in response to extensive representations made by Lord Avebury and Tameem Ebrahim,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcitizen.info/CitizenshipDenied_HO_Submission.pdf|title=britishcitizen.info}}</ref> British authorities announced that 600 British citizenship applications of ethnic minority children of Indian descent from Hong Kong were wrongly refused.<ref>https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldlwa/060228wa1.pdf</ref> The applications dated from the period July 1997 onwards.

Where such a person acquired a right of abode in the UK before 1983, it is possible for British citizenship to have been acquired. See also [[History of British nationality law]] and [[Sophia Naturalization Act 1705]].\n\n==Loss of British nationality==\n\n===Renunciation and resumption of British nationality===\nAll categories of British nationality can be renounced by a declaration made to the [[Secretary of State for the Home Department|Home Secretary]]. A person ceases to be a British national on the date the Home Secretary registers the declaration of renunciation. If a declaration is registered in the expectation of acquiring another citizenship but one is not acquired within six months of the registration, it does not take effect and the person remains a British national.\n\nRenunciations made to other authorities (such as the [[Oath of Allegiance (United States)|general renunciation made as part of the US naturalisation ceremony]]) are not recognised by the UK. The forms must be sent through the UK Border Agency's citizenship renunciation process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/britishcitizenship/givingupcitizenship/ |title=UK Border Agency &#124; How do I give up British citizenship or another form of British nationality? |publisher=Bia.homeoffice.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=13 August 2010}}</ref>\nThere are provisions for the resumption of British citizenship or British overseas territories citizenship renounced for the purpose of gaining or retaining another citizenship.

Secure Digital changed the MMC design in several ways:\n\n* Asymmetrical shape of the sides of the SD card prevent inserting it upside down (while an MMC goes in most of the way but makes no contact if inverted).\n* Most SD cards are {{convert|2.1|mm|abbr=in}} thick, compared to {{convert|1.4|mm|abbr=in}} for MMCs. The SD specification defines a card called '''Thin SD''' with a thickness of 1.4&nbsp;mm, but they occur only rarely, as the SDA went on to define even smaller form factors.\n* The card's electrical contacts are recessed beneath the surface of the card, protecting them from contact with a user's fingers.\n* The SD specification envisioned capacities and transfer rates exceeding those of MMC, and both of these functionalities have grown over time. For a comparison table, see [[#Comparison to other flash memory formats|below]].\n* While MMC uses a single pin for data transfers, the SD card added a four-wire bus mode for higher data rates.\n* The SD card added [[Content Protection for Recordable Media]] (CPRM) security circuitry for [[digital rights management]] (DRM) content-protection.\n* Addition of a write-protect notch\n\nFull-size SD cards do not fit into the slimmer MMC slots, and other issues also affect the ability to use one format in a host device designed for the other.\n\n===SDHC===\n[[File:SDHC-Logo.svg|thumb|upright=0.65|Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) logo; the specification defines cards with a capacity of more than {{No wrap|2 GiB}} up to {{nowrap|32 GiB}}]]\n\nThe Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) format, announced in January 2006 and defined in version 2.0 of the SD specification, supports cards with capacities up to 32&nbsp;GiB (34359738368 bytes).<ref name=\"sdcard_capacity\" /> The SDHC trademark is licensed to ensure compatibility.<ref name=sandisk-sdhc>[http://www.sandisk.com/Assets/File/pdf/retail/SDHC1.pdf What are SDHC, miniSDHC, and microSDHC?] SanDisk.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916035153/http://www.sandisk.com/Assets/File/pdf/retail/SDHC1.pdf |date=September 16, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nSDHC cards are physically and electrically identical to standard-capacity SD cards (SDSC).

In this mode, four bits are transferred when the clock signal rises and another four bits when it falls, transferring an entire byte on each full clock cycle, hence a 50&nbsp;MB/s operation could be transferred using a 50&nbsp;MHz clock.\n\n; UHS-II:Specified in version 4.0, further raises the data transfer rate to a theoretical maximum of 156&nbsp;MB/s (full-[[Duplex (telecommunications)|duplex]]) or 312&nbsp;MB/s (half-duplex) using an additional row of pins<ref name=\"firstsdxc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sdcard.org/press/SD_Association_Announces_UHS-II_eBOOK_Jan_5_2011_ENGLISH.PDF | publisher = SD Card | title = Association Triples Speeds with UHS-II | date = {{date|2011-01-05}} | accessdate=2011-08-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.robgalbraith.com/bins/content_page.asp?cid=7-11133-11156 | title =SD Association announces UHS-II, ultra high-speed SD card specification| first =Rob | last = Galbraith|date=2011-01-05|accessdate= 2011-01-05}}</ref> (a total of 17 pins for full-size and 16 pins for micro-size cards).<ref name=\"sda_bus_speed\" />\n\n; UHS-III: Version 6.0, released in February 2017, added two new data rates to the standard.

Use of UHS-I requires that the host device command the card to drop from 3.3-volt to 1.8-volt operation over the I/O interface pins and select the four-bit transfer mode, while UHS-II requires 0.4-volt operation.\n\nThe higher speed rates are achieved by using a two-lane low voltage (0.4&nbsp;V pp) differential interface. Each lane is capable of transferring up to 156&nbsp;MB/s. In full-duplex mode, one lane is used for Transmit while the other is used for Receive. In half-duplex mode both lanes are used for the same direction of data transfer allowing a double data rate at the same clock speed. In addition to enabling higher data rates, the UHS-II interface allows for lower interface power consumption, lower I/O voltage and lower electromagnetic interference (EMI).\n[[File:SD Express Highest Speed Card Standard.jpg|thumb]]\n\n==== {{Anchor|Express}} SD Express ====\nThe SD Express bus was released in June 2018 with SD specification 7.0. It uses a single [[PCIe]] lane to provide full-duplex 985 MB/s transfer speed. Supporting cards must also implement the [[NVM Express]] storage access protocol. The Express bus can be implemented by SDHC, SDXC, and SDUC cards. For legacy application use, SD Express cards must also support High Speed bus and UHS-I bus.

Both read and write speeds must exceed the specified value. The specification defines these classes in terms of performance curves that translate into the following minimum read-write performance levels on an empty card and suitability for different applications:<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /><ref name=\"sda_speed_class\"/><ref name=\"sda_speed_class_consumer\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/consumers/choices/speed_class/index.html|title=Speed Class Standards for Video Recording - SD Association|website=www.sdcard.org}}</ref><ref name=\"sda_logos_2017\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/consumers/pdf/2017SDA_brochure_eng.pdf|title=SD Standards Brochure 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe SD Association defines three types of Speed Class ratings: the original Speed Class, UHS Speed Class, and Video Speed Class.\n\n===== Speed Class =====\n'''Speed Class''' ratings 2, 4, and 6 assert that the card supports the respective number of megabytes per second as a minimum sustained write speed for a card in a fragmented state. Class 10 asserts that the card supports 10&nbsp;MB/s as a minimum non-fragmented sequential write speed and uses a High Speed bus mode.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> The host device can read a card's speed class and warn the user if the card reports a speed class that falls below an application's minimum need.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> By comparison, the older \"\u00d7\" rating measured maximum speed under ideal conditions, and was vague as to whether this was read speed or write speed. The graphical symbol for the speed class has a number encircled with 'C' (C2, C4, C6, and C10).\n\n===== UHS Speed Class =====\nUHS-I and UHS-II cards can use '''UHS Speed Class''' rating with two possible grades: class 1 for minimum read/write performance of at least 10&nbsp;MB/s ('U1' symbol featuring number 1 inside 'U') and class 3 for minimum write performance of 30&nbsp;MB/s ('U3' symbol featuring 3 inside 'U'), targeted at recording [[4K video]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/home/New_SDXC_and_SDHC_Memory_Cards_Now_Support_4K2K_Video_11-6-2013_FINAL_2.pdf |title=NEW SDXC AND SDHC MEMORY CARDS SUPPORT 4K2K VIDEO |publisher=SD Association |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13}}</ref> Before November 2013, the rating was branded ''UHS Speed Grade'' and contained grades 0 (no symbol) and 1 ('U1' symbol). Manufacturers can also display standard speed class symbols (C2, C4, C6, and C10) alongside, or in place of UHS speed class.\n\nUHS memory cards work best with UHS host devices.

Basic cards transfer data at up to six times (6\u00d7) the CD-ROM speed; that is, 900&nbsp;KiB/s or 7.37&nbsp;Mbit/s. The 2.0 specification{{clarify|reason=which specification|date=September 2013}} defines speeds up to 200\u00d7, but is not as specific as Speed Classes are on how to measure speed. Manufacturers may report best-case speeds and may report the card's fastest read speed, which is typically faster than the write speed. Some vendors, including [[Transcend Information|Transcend]] and [[Kingston Technology|Kingston]], report their cards' write speed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kingston.com/us/flash/x-speed |title=Flash Memory Cards and X-Speed Ratings |website=Kingston |accessdate=2017-08-05 }}</ref> When a card lists both a speed class and an \"\u00d7\" rating, the latter may be assumed a read speed only.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Real-world performance===\nIn applications that require sustained write throughput, such as video recording, the device might not perform satisfactorily if the SD card's class rating falls below a particular speed. For example, a high-definition [[camcorder]] may require a card of not less than Class 6, suffering dropouts or corrupted video if a slower card is used. [[Digital camera]]s with slow cards may take a noticeable time after taking a photograph before being ready for the next, while the camera writes the first picture.\n\nThe speed class rating does not totally characterize card performance. Different cards of the same class may vary considerably while meeting class specifications. A card's speed depends on many factors, including:\n* The frequency of soft errors that the card's controller must re-try\n* [[Write amplification]]: The flash controller may need to overwrite more data than requested. This has to do with performing read-modify-write operations on write blocks, freeing up (the much larger) erase blocks, while moving data around to achieve [[wear leveling]].\n* [[File fragmentation]]: where there is not sufficient space for a file to be recorded in a contiguous region, it is split into non-contiguous fragments. This does not cause rotational or head-movement delays as with electromechanical [[hard drive]]s, but may decrease speed\u2060\u200a\u2060\u200a\u2060\u2015\u200a\u200afor instance, by requiring additional reads and computation to determine where on the card the file's next fragment is stored.\n\nIn addition, speed may vary markedly between writing a large amount of data to a single file ([[sequential access]], as when a [[digital camera]] records large photographs or videos) and writing a large number of small files (a [[random access|random-access]] use common in [[smartphone]]s). A study in 2012 found that, in this random-access use, some Class 2 cards achieved a write speed of 1.38&nbsp;[[MB/s]], while all cards tested of Class 6 or greater (and some of lower Classes; lower Class does not ''necessarily'' mean better small-file performance), including those from major manufacturers, were over 100 times slower.<ref name=necstudy/> In 2014, a blogger measured a 300-fold performance difference on small writes; this time, the best card in this category was a class 4 card.<ref name=Gough2014/>\n\n==Features==\n\n===Card security===\nCards can protect their contents from erasure or modification, prevent access by non-authorized users, and protect copyrighted content using digital rights management.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n====Commands to disable writes====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nThe host device can command the SD card to become read-only (to reject subsequent commands to write information to it). There are both reversible and irreversible host commands that achieve this.\n\n====Write-protect notch====\n[[File:SD card unlocked and locked.svg|thumb|Unlocked and locked SD cards]]\n[[File:Sony toughcard notch less design.jpg|thumb|Sony 128GB SF-G Tough Series UHS-II SDXC Memory Card is one of the few cards in the market without a sliding tab on the write protect notch.]]\n\nMost full-size SD cards have a \"mechanical write protect switch\" allowing the user to advise the host computer that the user wants the device to be treated as read-only. This does not protect the data on the card if the host is compromised: ''\"It is the responsibility of the host to protect the card. The position of the write protect switch is unknown to the internal circuitry of the card.\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/index.html|title=Simplified Specifications - SD Association, version 3.10 , Part 1, Physical Layer, section 4.3.6\" Write Protect Management\"|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sdcard.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=2019-04-11}}</ref> Some host devices do not support write protection, which is an optional feature of the SD specification, and drivers and devices that do obey a read-only indication may give the user a way to override it.\n\nThe switch is a sliding tab that covers a notch in the card. The miniSD and microSD formats do not directly support a write protection notch, but they can be inserted into full-size adapters which do.\n\nWhen looking at the SD card from the top, the right side (the side with the beveled corner) must be notched.\n\nOn the left side, there may be a write-protection notch. If the notch is omitted, the card can be read and written. If the card is notched, it is read-only. If the card has a notch and a sliding tab which covers the notch, the user can slide the tab upward (toward the contacts) to declare the card read/write, or downward to declare it read-only. The diagram to the right shows an orange sliding write-protect tab in both the unlocked and locked positions.\n\nCards sold with content that must not be altered are permanently marked read-only by having a notch and no sliding tab.\n\n====Card password====\n[[File:Sdadaptersandcards.jpg|thumb|MicroSD to SD adapter (left), microSD to miniSD adapter (middle), microSD card (right)]]\n\nA host device can lock an SD card using a password of up to 16&nbsp;bytes, typically supplied by the user. A locked card interacts normally with the host device except that it rejects commands to read and write data. A locked card can be unlocked only by providing the same password. The host device can, after supplying the old password, specify a new password or disable locking. Without the password (typically, in the case that the user forgets the password), the host device can command the card to erase all the data on the card for future re-use (except card data under DRM), but there is no way to gain access to the existing data.\n\n[[Windows Phone 7]] devices use SD cards designed for access only by the phone manufacturer or mobile provider. An SD card inserted into the phone underneath the battery compartment becomes locked \"to the phone with an automatically generated key\" so that \"the SD card cannot be read by another phone, device, or PC\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2450831|title=Windows Phone 7 Secure Digital Card Limitations}}</ref> [[Symbian OS|Symbian]] devices, however, are some of the few that can perform the necessary low-level format operations on locked SD cards.

SDIO cards are only fully functional in host devices designed to support their input-output functions (typically PDAs like the [[Palm Treo]], but occasionally laptops or mobile phones). These devices can use the SD slot to support [[GPS]] receivers, [[modem]]s, [[barcode reader]]s, [[FM radio]] tuners, TV tuners, [[RFID]] readers, [[digital camera]]s, and interfaces to [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]], [[Ethernet]], and [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]]. Many other SDIO devices have been proposed, but it is now more common for I/O devices to connect using the USB interface.\n\nSDIO cards support most of the memory commands of SD cards. SDIO cards can be structured as eight logical cards, although currently, the typical way that an SDIO card uses this capability is to structure itself as one I/O card and one memory card.\n\nThe SDIO and SD interfaces are mechanically and electrically identical. Host devices built for SDIO cards generally accept SD memory cards without I/O functions. However, the reverse is not true, because host devices need suitable drivers and applications to support the card's I/O functions. For example, an HP SDIO camera usually does not work with PDAs that do not list it as an accessory. Inserting an SDIO card into any SD slot causes no physical damage nor disruption to the host device, but users may be frustrated that the SDIO card does not function fully when inserted into a seemingly compatible slot. (USB and Bluetooth devices exhibit comparable compatibility issues, although to a lesser extent thanks to standardized [[Class driver|USB device classes]] and [[Bluetooth profiles]].)\n\nThe [[#SDIO|SDIO]] family comprises Low-Speed and Full-Speed cards. Both types of SDIO cards support SPI and one-bit SD bus types. Low-Speed SDIO cards are allowed to also support the four-bit SD bus; Full-Speed SDIO cards are required to support the four-bit SD bus. To use an SDIO card as a \"combo card\" (for both memory and I/O), the host device must first select four-bit SD bus operation. Two other unique features of Low-Speed SDIO are a maximum clock rate of 400&nbsp;kHz for all communications, and the use of Pin 8 as \"interrupt\" to try to initiate dialogue with the host device.<ref name=\"SDIOspec\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/sdio/sdio_spec/|title=Simplified Version of SDIO CARD SPEC|publisher=SD Association|accessdate=2011-12-09}}</ref>\n\n; Ganging cards together\nThe one-bit SD protocol was derived from the MMC protocol, which envisioned the ability to put up to three cards on a bus of common signal lines. The cards use [[open collector]] interfaces, where a card may pull a line to the low voltage level; the line is at the high voltage level (because of a [[pull-up resistor]]) if no card pulls it low. Though the cards shared clock and signal lines, each card had its own [[chip select]] line to sense that the host device had selected it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe SD protocol envisioned the ability to gang 30 cards together without separate chip select lines. The host device would broadcast commands to all cards and identify the card to respond to the command using its unique serial number.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn practice, cards are rarely ganged together because open-collector operation has problems at high speeds and increases power consumption. Newer versions of the SD specification recommend separate lines to each card.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Compatibility===\nHost devices that comply with newer versions of the specification provide [[backward compatibility]] and accept older SD cards.<ref name=\"sdcard.org\"/> For example, SDXC host devices accept all previous families of SD memory cards, and SDHC host devices also accept standard SD cards.\n\nOlder host devices generally do not support newer card formats, and even when they might support the bus interface used by the card,<ref name=sdcard_using_sdxc /> there are several factors that arise:\n\n* A newer card may offer [[#Types of cards|greater capacity]] than the host device can handle (over 4 GB for SDHC, over 32 GB for SDXC).\n* A newer card may use a [[#File system|file system]] the host device cannot navigate ([[FAT32]] for SDHC, [[exFAT]] for SDXC)\n* Use of an SDIO card requires the host device be designed for the input/output functions the card provides.\n* The hardware interface of the card was changed starting with the version 2.0 (new high-speed bus clocks, redefinition of [[#Storage capacity calculations|storage capacity bits]]) and [[#SDHC|SDHC]] family (Ultra-high speed (UHS) bus)\n* UHS-II has physically more pins but is backwards compatible to UHS-I and non-UHS for both slot and card.<ref name=\"sda_bus_speed\"/>\n* Some vendors produced SDSC cards above&nbsp;1GB before the SDA had standardized a method of doing so.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ SD compatibility table\n! {{Diagonal split header|Slot|Card}}\n! scope=\"col\" | SDSC\n! scope=\"col\" | SDHC\n! scope=\"col\" | SDHC<br/>UHS\n! scope=\"col\" | SDXC\n! scope=\"col\" | SDXC<br/>UHS \n! scope=\"col\" | SDIO\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDSC\n| {{Partial}}{{Efn|name=sdsccompat|See [[#Storage_capacity_and_compatibilities|discussion about storage capacity and compatibilities]]}} || {{Partial|FAT16,<4GiB}}{{Efn|name=sdsccompat}} || {{Partial|FAT16,<4GiB}}{{Efn|name=sdsccompat}} || {{No}} || {{No}} || {{No}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDHC\n| {{Yes}} || {{Yes}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs|In non-UHS mode}}}} || {{Partial|FAT32}} || {{Partial|FAT32{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}}  || {{No}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDHC UHS\n| {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} ||  {{Yes|Yes{{Efn|name=uhs|In UHS mode}}}} || {{Partial|FAT32{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{Partial|FAT32{{Efn|name=uhs}}}} ||  {{No}}\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDXC\n| {{Yes}} || {{Yes}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{Yes}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}}  || {{No}}\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDXC UHS\n| {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} ||  {{Yes|Yes{{Efn|name=uhs}}}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}}|| {{Yes|Yes{{Efn|name=uhs}}}} || {{No}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDIO\n| {{partial|Varies}} ||  {{partial|Varies}} || {{partial|Varies}} || {{partial|Varies}} || {{partial|Varies}} || {{Yes}}\n|}\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==Markets==\nSecure Digital cards are used in many consumer electronic devices, and have become a widespread means of storing several gigabytes of data in a small size.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Devices in which the user may remove and replace cards often, such as [[digital camera]]s, [[camcorder]]s, and [[video game console]]s, tend to use full-sized cards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Devices in which small size is paramount, such as [[mobile phone]]s, tend to use microSD cards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe microSD card has helped propel the smartphone market by giving both manufacturers and consumers greater flexibility and freedom.{{According to whom|date=October 2016}} Due to their compact size, microSD cards are used in many{{Which|date=October 2016}} different applications in a large variety{{Which|date=October 2016}} of markets.

They may also not present the best choice for applications that require higher storage capacities or speeds as provided by other flash card standards such as [[CompactFlash]]. These limitations may be addressed by evolving memory technologies, such as the new SD 7.0 specifications which allow storage capabilities of up to 128 TB.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sdcard.org/consumers/choices/speed_class/index.html |title=Speed Class Standards for Video Recording|website=SD Association |accessdate=21 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Samsung Pro 64gb micro-SDXC original and falsification front and back.jpg|thumb|[[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]] Pro 64&nbsp;GB microSDXC original (left) and counterfeit (right): The counterfeit claims to have 64&nbsp;GB in capacity, but only 8&nbsp;GB (Class 4 speed) are usable: When trying to write more than 8 GB, [[data loss]] occurs.

The files that were copied back can be tested either by comparing checksums (e.g. [[Md5sum|MD5]]), or trying to [[Data compression|compress]] them. The latter approach leverages the fact that counterfeited cards let the user read back files, which then consist of easily compressible uniform data (for example, repeating [[0xFF]]s).\n\n===Digital cameras===\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2016}}\nSD/MMC cards replaced [[Toshiba]]'s [[SmartMedia]] as the dominant memory card format used in digital cameras. In 2001, SmartMedia had achieved nearly 50% use, but by 2005 SD/MMC had achieved over 40% of the digital camera market and SmartMedia's share had plummeted by 2007.\n\nAt this time, all the leading digital camera manufacturers used SD in their consumer product lines, including [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], [[Casio]], [[Fujifilm]], [[Kodak]], [[Leica Camera|Leica]], [[Nikon]], [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]], [[Panasonic]], [[Pentax]], [[Ricoh]], [[Samsung]], and [[Sony]]. Formerly, [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] and [[Fujifilm]] used [[XD-Picture Card]]s (xD cards) exclusively, while [[Sony]] only used [[Memory Stick]]; by early 2010 all three supported SD.\n\nSome [[prosumer]] and professional digital cameras continued to offer [[CompactFlash]] (CF), either on a second card slot or as the only storage, as CF supports much higher maximum capacities and historically was cheaper for the same capacity.\n\nSecure Digital memory cards can be used in Sony [[XDCAM]] EX [[camcorder]]s with an adapter<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/micro-xdcamexsite/cat-accessories/product-MEADSD01/ |title=MEAD-SD01 SDHC card adapter (Sony) |publisher=Pro.sony.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> and in Panasonic [[P2 (storage media)|P2 card]] equipment with a [[MicroP2]] adapter.\n\n===Personal computers===\nAlthough many [[personal computer]]s accommodate SD cards as an auxiliary storage device using a built-in slot, or can accommodate SD cards by means of a USB adapter, SD cards cannot be used as the primary [[hard disk]] through the onboard [[Parallel ATA|ATA]] controller, because none of the SD card variants support ATA signalling.

However, on computers that support [[bootstrapping]] from a USB interface, an SD card in a USB adapter can be the primary hard disk, provided it contains an operating system that supports USB access once the bootstrap is complete.\n\nSince late 2009, newer [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computers with installed SD card readers have been able to boot in [[macOS]] from SD storage devices, when properly formatted to [[HFS Plus|Mac OS Extended]] file format and the default partition table set to [[GUID Partition Table]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3553 |title=About the SD and SDXC card slot |publisher=Support.apple.com |date=2013-06-08 |accessdate=2013-11-13}}</ref> (See [[#File system|Other file systems]] below).\n\nSD cards are increasing in usage and popular among owners of vintage computers like [[Atari 8-bit family|8-bit Atari]]. For example SIO2SD ([[Atari SIO|SIO]] is an Atari port for connecting external devices) is used nowadays. It may be an interesting fact that the whole collection of software for an 8-bit Atari may be included on one SD card that may have less than 4-8 GB of disk size (2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://retrohax.net/sio2sd-for-atari/|title=SIO2SD for 8-bit Atari|date=May 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Embedded systems===\n[[File:Arduino Ethernet Shield (pre-production sample).jpg|thumb|A shield ([[daughterboard]]) that gives [[Arduino]] prototyping microprocessors access to SD cards]]\n\nIn 2008, the SDA specified Embedded SD, \"leverag[ing] well-known SD standards\" to enable non-removable SD-style devices on printed circuit boards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Embedded SD|publisher=SD Association|url=http://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/embedded_sd/|accessdate=2011-11-30}}</ref> However this standard was not adopted by the market while the [[MultiMediaCard|MMC]] standard became the de facto standard for embedded systems.

The SPI bus mode and one-bit SD bus mode are mandatory for all SD families, as explained in the next section. Once the host device and the SD card negotiate a bus interface mode, the usage of the numbered pins is the same for all card sizes.\n* '''SPI bus mode:''' [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus]] is primarily used by embedded [[microcontroller]]s.

UHS-I and UHS-II require this bus type.\n* '''Two differential lines SD UHS-II mode:''' Uses two low-voltage differential interfaces to transfer commands and data. UHS-II cards include this interface in addition to the SD bus modes.\n\nThe physical interface comprises 9 pins, except that the miniSD card adds two unconnected pins in the center and the microSD card omits one of the two V<sub>SS</sub> (Ground) pins.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/simplified_specs/part1_410.pdf |title=SD Part 1, Physical Layer Simplified Specification, Version 4.10 |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232415/https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/simplified_specs/part1_410.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-02 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:MMC-SD-miniSD-microSD-Color-Numbers-Names.gif|thumb|upright|Official pin numbers for each card type (top to bottom): [[MultiMediaCard|MMC]], SD, miniSD, microSD.

The host device thereby sends 48-bit commands and receives responses. The card can signal that a response will be delayed, but the host device can abort the dialogue.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\"/>\n\nThrough issuing various commands, the host device can:<ref name=\"SDHCspec\"/>\n* Determine the type, memory capacity, and capabilities of the SD card\n* Command the card to use a different voltage, different clock speed, or advanced electrical interface\n* Prepare the card to receive a block to write to the flash memory, or read and reply with the contents of a specified block.\n\nThe command interface is an extension of the [[MultiMediaCard]] (MMC) interface. SD cards dropped support for some of the commands in the MMC protocol, but added commands related to copy protection. By using only commands supported by both standards until determining the type of card inserted, a host device can accommodate both SD and MMC cards.\n\n====Electrical interface====\nAll SD card families initially use a 3.3&nbsp;[[volt]] electrical interface. On command, SDHC and SDXC cards can switch to 1.8&nbsp;V operation.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" />\n\nAt initial power-up or card insertion, the host device selects either the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus or the one-bit SD bus by the voltage level present on Pin 1. Thereafter, the host device may issue a command to switch to the four-bit SD bus interface, if the SD card supports it. For various card types, support for the four-bit SD bus is either optional or mandatory.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" />\n\nAfter determining that the SD card supports it, the host device can also command the SD card to switch to a [[#Speed|higher transfer speed]]. Until determining the card's capabilities, the host device should not use a clock speed faster than 400&nbsp;kHz. SD cards other than SDIO (see below) have a \"Default Speed\" clock rate of 25&nbsp;MHz. The host device is not required to use the maximum clock speed that the card supports. It may operate at less than the maximum clock speed to conserve power.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> Between commands, the host device can stop the clock entirely.\n\n====Achieving higher card speeds====\nThe SD specification defines four-bit-wide transfers. (The MMC specification supports this and also defines an eight-bit-wide mode; MMC cards with extended bits were not accepted by the market.) Transferring several bits on each clock pulse improves the card speed. Advanced SD families have also improved speed by offering faster clock frequencies and double data rate (explained [[#UHS Speed Class|here]]) in a high-speed differential interface (UHS-II).{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===File system===\nLike other types of [[flash memory]] card, an SD card of any SD family is a [[block (data storage)|block-addressable]] [[Data storage device|storage device]], in which the host device can read or write fixed-size blocks by specifying their block number.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n====MBR and FAT====\nMost SD cards ship preformatted with one or more [[Master boot record|MBR partitions]], where the first or only partition contains a [[file system]]. This lets them operate like the [[hard disk]] of a [[personal computer]]. Per the SD card specification, an SD card is formatted with MBR and the following file system:\n\n* For SDSC cards:\n** Capacity of less than 32,680 logical sectors<!-- This is the exact condition as per the SD card spec. For operating systems to properly recognize this as FAT12, the cluster values used on the resulting volume must not be outside the range 002h..FF5h, a condition normally (but not necessarily) met implicitly when applying standard logical geometries on a FAT filesystem with less than 32680 logical sectors. We mention the logical sector count rather than the allowed cluster range here as this article is about SD cards specifically. --> (smaller than 16 MB): [[FAT12]] with partition type [[Partition type#PID 01h|01h]] and [[BPB 3.0]] or [[EBPB 4.1]]<ref name=\"SDG_2000_SD-P2-V1.0\">{{cite book\n|title=SD Memory Card Specifications \u2013 PART 2 FILE SYSTEM SPECIFICATION \u2013 Version 1.0\n|author=<!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line -->\n|publisher=SD Group, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.

Universal support for FAT12, FAT16, FAT16B, and FAT32 allows the use of SDSC and SDHC cards on most host computers with a compatible SD reader, to present the user with the familiar method of named files in a hierarchical directory tree.\n\nOn such SD cards, standard utility programs such as Mac OS X's \"{{nowrap|[[Disk Utility]]}}\" or Windows' [[SCANDISK]] can be used to repair a corrupted filing system and sometimes recover deleted files. [[Defragmentation]] tools for FAT file systems may be used on such cards. The resulting consolidation of files may provide a marginal improvement in the time required to read or write the file,<ref name=\"Fragmentation_and_Speed\">{{Citation | url = https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/speed_class/ | title = Fragmentation and Speed | publisher = SD Card}}</ref> but not an improvement comparable to defragmentation of hard drives, where storing a file in multiple fragments requires additional physical, and relatively slow, movement of a drive head. Moreover, defragmentation performs writes to the SD card that count against the card's rated lifespan. The write endurance of the physical memory is discussed in the article on [[Flash memory degradation|flash memory]]; newer technology to increase the storage capacity of a card provides worse write endurance.\n\nWhen reformatting an SD card with a capacity of at least 32&nbsp;MB (65536 logical sectors or more), but not more than 2&nbsp;GB, [[FAT16B]] with partition type [[Partition type#PID 06h|06h]] and [[EBPB 4.1]]<ref name=\"SDG_2000_SD-P2-V1.0\"/> is recommended if the card is for a consumer device. (FAT16B is also an option for 4&nbsp;GB cards, but it requires the use of 64&nbsp;KiB [[cluster (file system)|clusters]], which are not widely supported.) FAT16B does not support cards above 4&nbsp;GB at all.\n\nThe SDXC specification mandates the use of [[Microsoft]]'s [[proprietary format|proprietary]] [[exFAT]] file system,<ref name=\"engadget_sdxc_2t_300m\">{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2009/01/07/sdxc-memory-cards-promise-2tb-of-storage-300mbps-transfer/ |title = SDXC memory cards promise 2 TB of storage, 300 MBps transfer | publisher=Engadget |date= 2009-01-07 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> which sometimes requires appropriate drivers (e.g. <code>exfat-utils</code>/<code>exfat-fuse</code> on Linux).\n\n====Other file systems====\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2016}}\nBecause the host views the SD card as a block storage device, the card does not require MBR partitions or any specific file system. The card can be reformatted to use any file system the operating system supports. For example:\n* Under [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], SD cards can be formatted using [[NTFS]] and, on later versions, [[exFAT]].\n* Under [[macOS]], SD cards can be partitioned as [[GUID Partition Table|GUID]] devices and formatted with either [[HFS Plus]] or [[Apple File System|APFS]] file systems or still use [[exFAT]].\n* Under [[Unix-like]] operating systems such as [[Linux]] or [[FreeBSD]], SD cards can be formatted using the [[Unix File System|UFS]], [[Ext2]], [[Ext3]], [[Ext4]], [[btrfs]], [[HFS Plus]], [[ReiserFS]] or [[F2FS]] file system. Additionally under Linux, [[HFS Plus]] file systems may be accessed for read/write if the \"hfsplus\" package is installed, and partitioned and formatted if \"hfsprogs\" is installed. (These package names are correct under Debian, Ubuntu etc., but may differ on other Linux distributions.)\n\nAny recent version of the above can format SD cards using the [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] file system.\n\nAdditionally, as with [[live USB]] flash drives, an SD card can have an operating system installed on it. Computers that can [[booting|boot]] from an SD card (either using a USB adapter or inserted into the computer's flash media reader) instead of the hard disk drive may thereby be able to recover from a corrupted hard disk drive.<ref>Any operating system used on [[Raspberry Pi]] generally have to boot off a Live SD, most commonly Raspbian.</ref> Such an SD card can be [[#Card security|write-locked]] to preserve the system's integrity.\n\nThe SD Standard allows usage of only the above-mentioned Microsoft FAT file systems and any card produced in the market shall be preloaded with the related standard file system upon its delivery to the market. If any application or user re-formats the card with a non-standard file system the proper operation of the card, including interoperability, cannot be assured.\n\n====Risks of reformatting====\nReformatting an SD card with a different file system, or even with the same one, may make the card slower, or shorten its lifespan. Some cards use [[wear leveling]], in which frequently modified blocks are mapped to different portions of memory at different times, and some wear-leveling algorithms are designed for the access patterns typical of FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/428584/ |title=Optimizing Linux with cheap flash drives |publisher=Linux Weekly News|accessdate=2011-04-11}}</ref> In addition, the preformatted file system may use a cluster size that matches the erase region of the physical memory on the card; reformatting may change the cluster size and make writes less efficient.  The SD Association provides freely-downloadable SD Formatter software to overcome these problems for Windows and Mac OS X.<ref name=sdfmt>[https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_3/ SD Formatter 3.1 for SD/SDHC/SDXC], SD Association</ref>\n\nSD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards have a \"Protected Area\" on the card for the SD standard's security function.  Neither standard formatters nor the SD Association formatter will erase it.  The SD Association suggests that devices or software which use the SD security function may format it.<ref name=sdfmt/>\n\n===Power consumption===\nThe power consumption of SD cards varies by its speed mode, manufacturer and model.\n\nDuring transfer it may be in the range of 66\u2013330&nbsp;mW (20\u2013100&nbsp;mA at a supply voltage of 3.3&nbsp;V). Specifications from TwinMos technologies list a maximum of 149&nbsp;mW (45&nbsp;mA) during transfer. Toshiba lists 264\u2013330&nbsp;mW (80\u2013100&nbsp;mA).<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.toshiba-memory.com/en/micro_sd_cards.html | contribution = microSD & microSDHC Cards | publisher = Toshiba | title = Memory Solutions}}</ref> Standby current is much lower, less than 0.2&nbsp;mA for one 2006 microSD card.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.dtt8.com/images/micro-sd%20specification.pdf | publisher = DTT | title = Micro SD specification | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130207004550/http://www.dtt8.com/images/micro-sd%20specification.pdf | archive-date = 2013-02-07 | df =  }}</ref> If there is data transfer for significant periods, battery life may be reduced noticeably (smartphones typically have batteries of capacity around 6&nbsp;Wh (Samsung Galaxy S2, 1650&nbsp;mAh @ 3.7&nbsp;V)).\n\nModern UHS-II cards can consume up to 2.88&nbsp;W, if the host device supports bus speed mode SDR104 or UHS-II.

In standard-capacity cards (SDSC), 12 bits identify the number of memory clusters (ranging from 1 to 4,096) and 3 bits identify the number of blocks per cluster (which decode to 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, or 512 blocks per cluster). The host device multiplies these figures (as shown in the following section) with the number of bytes per block to determine the card's capacity in bytes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nSD version 1.00 assumed 512 bytes per block. This permitted SDSC cards up to 4,096 \u00d7 512 \u00d7 512 B = 1&nbsp;GiB, for which there are no known incompatibilities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nVersion 1.01 let an SDSC card use a 4-bit field to indicate 1,024 or 2,048 bytes per block instead.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> Doing so enabled cards with 2&nbsp;GB and 4&nbsp;GB capacity, such as the Transcend 4&nbsp;GB SD card and the Memorette 4 GB SD card.\n\nEarly SDSC host devices that assume 512-byte blocks therefore do not fully support the insertion of 2&nbsp;GB or 4&nbsp;GB cards. In some cases, the host device can read data that happens to reside in the first 1&nbsp;GB of the card. If the assumption is made in the driver software, success may be version-dependent. In addition, any host device might not support a 4&nbsp;GB SDSC card, since the specification lets it assume that 2&nbsp;GB is the maximum for these cards.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Storage capacity calculations===\nThe format of the Card-Specific Data (CSD) register changed between version 1 (SDSC) and version 2.0 (which defines SDHC and SDXC).\n\n====Version 1====\nIn version 1 of the SD specification, capacities up to 2&nbsp;GB are calculated by combining fields of the CSD as follows:\n\n Capacity = ('''C_SIZE''' + 1) \u00d7 2<sup>('''C_SIZE_MULT''' + '''READ_BL_LEN''' + 2)</sup>\n where\n   0 \u2264 '''C_SIZE''' \u2264 4095,\n   0 \u2264 '''C_SIZE_MULT''' \u2264 7,\n   '''READ_BL_LEN''' is 9 (for 512 bytes/sector) or 10 (for 1024 bytes/sector)\n\nLater versions state (at Section 4.3.2) that a 2&nbsp;GB SDSC card shall set its READ_BL_LEN (and WRITE_BL_LEN) to indicate 1024 bytes, so that the above computation correctly reports the card's capacity; but that, for consistency, the host device shall not request (by CMD16) block lengths over 512 B.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" />\n\n====Versions 2 and 3====\nIn the definition of SDHC cards in version 2.0, the C_SIZE portion of the CSD is 22 bits and it indicates the memory size in multiples of 512&nbsp;KiB (the C_SIZE_MULT field is removed and READ_BL_LEN is no longer used to compute capacity). Two bits that were formerly reserved now identify the card family: 0 is SDSC; 1 is SDHC or SDXC; 2 and 3 are reserved.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> Because of these redefinitions, older host devices do not correctly identify SDHC or SDXC cards nor their correct capacity.\n\n* SDHC cards are restricted to reporting a capacity not over 32&nbsp;GB.\n* SDXC cards are allowed to use all 22 bits of the C_SIZE field. An SDHC card that did so (reported C_SIZE > 65375 to indicate a capacity of over 32&nbsp;GB) would violate the specification. A host device that relied on C_SIZE rather than the specification to determine the card's maximum capacity might support such a card, but the card might fail in other SDHC-compatible host devices.\n\nCapacity is calculated thus:\n\n Capacity = ('''C_SIZE''' + 1) \u00d7 524288\n where for SDHC  \n   4112 \u2264 '''C_SIZE''' \u2264 65375  \n   \u22482&nbsp;GB \u2264 Capacity \u2264 \u224832&nbsp;GB\n where for SDXC \n   65535 \u2264 '''C_SIZE'''\n   \u224832&nbsp;GB \u2264 Capacity \u2264 2&nbsp;TB\n\nCapacities above 4&nbsp;GB can only be achieved by following version 2.0 or later versions. In addition, capacities equal to 4&nbsp;GB must also do so to guarantee compatibility.\n\n==Openness of specification==\n[[File:SD-microSD adaptor.jpg|thumb|upright|Dismantled microSD to SD adapter showing the passive connection from the microSD card slot on the bottom to the SD pins on the top]]\n\nLike most memory card formats, SD is covered by numerous [[patent]]s and [[trademark]]s. Excluding [[Secure Digital#SDIO cards|SDIO]] cards, [[Royalty payment|royalties]] for SD card licenses are imposed for manufacture and sale of memory cards and host adapters (US$1,000/year plus membership at US$1,500/year)\n\nEarly versions of the SD specification were available under a [[non-disclosure agreement]] (NDA) prohibiting development of [[open-source software|open-source]] drivers. However, the system was eventually [[reverse-engineered]] and free software drivers provided access to SD cards not using DRM. Subsequent to the release of most open-source drivers, the SDA provided a simplified version of the specification under a less restrictive license helping reduce some incompatibility issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/20060 |title=Sharp Linux PDA promotes the use of proprietary SD card, but more open MMC works just fine |publisher=Linux.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\nUnder a disclaimers agreement, the simplified specification released by the SDA in 2006 \u2013 as opposed to that of SD cards \u2013 which later extended to the physical layer, ASSD extensions, SDIO, and SDIO [[Bluetooth]] Type-A.<ref>[http://www.sdcard.org/developers/tech/sdcard/pls/ Simplified Specification Agreement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028165644/http://www.sdcard.org/developers/tech/sdcard/pls/ |date=2008-10-28 }} from the SDA's website</ref> Again, most of the information had already been discovered and [[Linux]] had a fully free driver for it. Still, building a chip conforming to this specification caused the [[One Laptop per Child]] project to claim \"the first truly Open Source SD implementation, with no need to obtain an SDI license or sign NDAs to create SD drivers or applications.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mailman.laptop.org/pipermail/community-news/2006-September/000023.html |title=OLPC mailing list archive |publisher=Mailman.laptop.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412094819/http://mailman.laptop.org/pipermail/community-news/2006-September/000023.html|archivedate=2011-04-12}}</ref>\n\nThe proprietary nature of the complete SD specification affects [[embedded system]]s, laptop computers, and some desktop computers; many desktop computers do not have card slots, instead using [[USB]]-based [[card reader#Memory card readers|card readers]] if necessary. These card readers present a standard [[USB mass storage]] interface to memory cards, thus separating the operating system from the details of the underlying SD interface. However, embedded systems (such as portable music players) usually gain direct access to SD cards and thus need complete programming information. Desktop card readers are themselves embedded systems; their manufacturers have usually paid the SDA for complete access to the SD specifications. Many notebook computers now include SD card readers not based on USB; device drivers for these essentially gain direct access to the SD card, as do embedded systems.\n\nThe [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]]-bus interface mode is the only type that does not require a host license for accessing SD cards.\n\n==Comparison to other flash memory formats==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:Flash memory cards size.jpg|thumb|upright|Size comparison of various flash cards: SD, [[CompactFlash]], [[MultiMediaCard|MMC]], [[xD-Picture Card|xD]]]]\n\nOverall, SD is less open than [[CompactFlash]] or [[USB flash drive|USB flash memory drives]]. Those [[open standard]]s can be implemented without paying for licensing, royalties, or documentation. (CompactFlash and USB flash drives may require licensing fees for the use of the SDA's trademarked logos.)\n\nHowever, SD is much more open than [[Memory Stick|Sony's Memory Stick]], for which no public documentation nor any documented legacy implementation is available. All SD cards can be accessed freely using the well-documented [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]] bus.\n\n[[xD-Picture Card|xD]] cards are simply 18-pin [[NAND flash]] chips in a special package and support [[XD-Picture Card#Raw hardware|the standard command set]] for raw NAND flash access. Although the raw hardware interface to xD cards is well understood, the layout of its memory contents\u2014necessary for interoperability with xD card readers and digital cameras\u2014is totally undocumented. The consortium that licenses xD cards has not released any technical information to the public.\n\n{{Comparison of memory cards}}\n\n==Data recovery==\nA malfunctioning SD card can be repaired using specialized equipment, as long as the middle part, containing the flash storage, is not physically damaged. The controller can in this way be circumvented.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.acelaboratory.com/pc-3000-flash-circuit-board-and-msd-card-preparing-and-soldering.html|title=PC-3000 Flash.

Secure Digital changed the MMC design in several ways:\n\n* Asymmetrical shape of the sides of the SD card prevent inserting it upside down (while an MMC goes in most of the way but makes no contact if inverted).\n* Most SD cards are {{convert|2.1|mm|abbr=in}} thick, compared to {{convert|1.4|mm|abbr=in}} for MMCs. The SD specification defines a card called '''Thin SD''' with a thickness of 1.4&nbsp;mm, but they occur only rarely, as the SDA went on to define even smaller form factors.\n* The card's electrical contacts are recessed beneath the surface of the card, protecting them from contact with a user's fingers.\n* The SD specification envisioned capacities and transfer rates exceeding those of MMC, and both of these functionalities have grown over time. For a comparison table, see [[#Comparison to other flash memory formats|below]].\n* While MMC uses a single pin for data transfers, the SD card added a four-wire bus mode for higher data rates.\n* The SD card added [[Content Protection for Recordable Media]] (CPRM) security circuitry for [[digital rights management]] (DRM) content-protection.\n* Addition of a write-protect notch\n\nFull-size SD cards do not fit into the slimmer MMC slots, and other issues also affect the ability to use one format in a host device designed for the other.\n\n===SDHC===\n[[File:SDHC-Logo.svg|thumb|upright=0.65|Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) logo; the specification defines cards with a capacity of more than {{No wrap|2 GiB}} up to {{nowrap|32 GiB}}]]\n\nThe Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) format, announced in January 2006 and defined in version 2.0 of the SD specification, supports cards with capacities up to 32&nbsp;GiB (34359738368 bytes).<ref name=\"sdcard_capacity\" /> The SDHC trademark is licensed to ensure compatibility.<ref name=sandisk-sdhc>[http://www.sandisk.com/Assets/File/pdf/retail/SDHC1.pdf What are SDHC, miniSDHC, and microSDHC?] SanDisk.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916035153/http://www.sandisk.com/Assets/File/pdf/retail/SDHC1.pdf |date=September 16, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nSDHC cards are physically and electrically identical to standard-capacity SD cards (SDSC).

Compliance with a higher speed rating is a guarantee that the card limits its use of the \"busy\" indication.\n\n=== Bus===\n\n==== Default Speed ====\nSD Cards will read and write at speeds of 12.5 MB/s.\n\n==== High Speed ====\n{{Empty section |date=February 2019}}\n\n==== {{Anchor|Ultra High Speed|UHS}} Ultra High Speed (UHS) ====\n[[File:Lexar 1000x MicroSDHC UHS-II U3 Class 10 - Back.jpg|thumb|upright|Back side of a Lexar UHS-II microSDHC card, showing the additional row of UHS-II connections]]\n\nThe Ultra High Speed (UHS) bus is available on some SDHC and SDXC cards.<ref name=\"sda_bus_speed\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/bus_speed/ |title=Bus Speed (Default Speed/ High Speed/ UHS) - SD Association |publisher=Sdcard.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.engadget.com/2010/06/24/sd-cards-branded-with-an-upper-case-i-are-faster-yo/ |title=SD cards branded with an upper-case 'I' are faster, yo |publisher=Engadget|date= 2010-06-24 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Rigg |first=Jamie |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/07/16/toshiba-exceria-pro-sd-cards/ |title=Toshiba's Exceria Pro SDHC cards claim 'world's fastest' write speeds of 240&nbsp;MB per second |publisher=Engadget.com |date=2013-07-16 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> The following ultra-high speeds are specified:\n\n; UHS-I: Specified in SD version 3.01.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\">{{cite web | publisher = SD Association | url = http://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/simplified_specs/archive/part1_301.pdf | title = SD Part 1, Physical Layer Simplified Specification, Version 3.01 | date = 2010-05-18 | accessdate = 2013-11-25 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131205014133/https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/simplified_specs/archive/part1_301.pdf | archive-date = 2013-12-05 | url-status = dead }}</ref> <!-- There is a newer 2017 version at https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/ but it has a complicated little onScroll JS to ensure you've \"read\" (\"yeah, right..\") the license terms, which doesn't seem to work. --> Supports a clock frequency of 100&nbsp;MHz (a quadrupling of the original \"Default Speed\"), which in four-bit transfer mode could transfer 50&nbsp;MB/s (SDR50).

Each lane is capable of transferring up to 156&nbsp;MB/s. In full-duplex mode, one lane is used for Transmit while the other is used for Receive. In half-duplex mode both lanes are used for the same direction of data transfer allowing a double data rate at the same clock speed.

Basic cards transfer data at up to six times (6\u00d7) the CD-ROM speed; that is, 900&nbsp;KiB/s or 7.37&nbsp;Mbit/s. The 2.0 specification{{clarify|reason=which specification|date=September 2013}} defines speeds up to 200\u00d7, but is not as specific as Speed Classes are on how to measure speed. Manufacturers may report best-case speeds and may report the card's fastest read speed, which is typically faster than the write speed. Some vendors, including [[Transcend Information|Transcend]] and [[Kingston Technology|Kingston]], report their cards' write speed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kingston.com/us/flash/x-speed |title=Flash Memory Cards and X-Speed Ratings |website=Kingston |accessdate=2017-08-05 }}</ref> When a card lists both a speed class and an \"\u00d7\" rating, the latter may be assumed a read speed only.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Real-world performance===\nIn applications that require sustained write throughput, such as video recording, the device might not perform satisfactorily if the SD card's class rating falls below a particular speed. For example, a high-definition [[camcorder]] may require a card of not less than Class 6, suffering dropouts or corrupted video if a slower card is used. [[Digital camera]]s with slow cards may take a noticeable time after taking a photograph before being ready for the next, while the camera writes the first picture.\n\nThe speed class rating does not totally characterize card performance. Different cards of the same class may vary considerably while meeting class specifications. A card's speed depends on many factors, including:\n* The frequency of soft errors that the card's controller must re-try\n* [[Write amplification]]: The flash controller may need to overwrite more data than requested. This has to do with performing read-modify-write operations on write blocks, freeing up (the much larger) erase blocks, while moving data around to achieve [[wear leveling]].\n* [[File fragmentation]]: where there is not sufficient space for a file to be recorded in a contiguous region, it is split into non-contiguous fragments. This does not cause rotational or head-movement delays as with electromechanical [[hard drive]]s, but may decrease speed\u2060\u200a\u2060\u200a\u2060\u2015\u200a\u200afor instance, by requiring additional reads and computation to determine where on the card the file's next fragment is stored.\n\nIn addition, speed may vary markedly between writing a large amount of data to a single file ([[sequential access]], as when a [[digital camera]] records large photographs or videos) and writing a large number of small files (a [[random access|random-access]] use common in [[smartphone]]s). A study in 2012 found that, in this random-access use, some Class 2 cards achieved a write speed of 1.38&nbsp;[[MB/s]], while all cards tested of Class 6 or greater (and some of lower Classes; lower Class does not ''necessarily'' mean better small-file performance), including those from major manufacturers, were over 100 times slower.<ref name=necstudy/> In 2014, a blogger measured a 300-fold performance difference on small writes; this time, the best card in this category was a class 4 card.<ref name=Gough2014/>\n\n==Features==\n\n===Card security===\nCards can protect their contents from erasure or modification, prevent access by non-authorized users, and protect copyrighted content using digital rights management.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n====Commands to disable writes====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nThe host device can command the SD card to become read-only (to reject subsequent commands to write information to it).

The miniSD and microSD formats do not directly support a write protection notch, but they can be inserted into full-size adapters which do.\n\nWhen looking at the SD card from the top, the right side (the side with the beveled corner) must be notched.\n\nOn the left side, there may be a write-protection notch. If the notch is omitted, the card can be read and written. If the card is notched, it is read-only. If the card has a notch and a sliding tab which covers the notch, the user can slide the tab upward (toward the contacts) to declare the card read/write, or downward to declare it read-only. The diagram to the right shows an orange sliding write-protect tab in both the unlocked and locked positions.\n\nCards sold with content that must not be altered are permanently marked read-only by having a notch and no sliding tab.\n\n====Card password====\n[[File:Sdadaptersandcards.jpg|thumb|MicroSD to SD adapter (left), microSD to miniSD adapter (middle), microSD card (right)]]\n\nA host device can lock an SD card using a password of up to 16&nbsp;bytes, typically supplied by the user. A locked card interacts normally with the host device except that it rejects commands to read and write data. A locked card can be unlocked only by providing the same password. The host device can, after supplying the old password, specify a new password or disable locking. Without the password (typically, in the case that the user forgets the password), the host device can command the card to erase all the data on the card for future re-use (except card data under DRM), but there is no way to gain access to the existing data.\n\n[[Windows Phone 7]] devices use SD cards designed for access only by the phone manufacturer or mobile provider. An SD card inserted into the phone underneath the battery compartment becomes locked \"to the phone with an automatically generated key\" so that \"the SD card cannot be read by another phone, device, or PC\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2450831|title=Windows Phone 7 Secure Digital Card Limitations}}</ref> [[Symbian OS|Symbian]] devices, however, are some of the few that can perform the necessary low-level format operations on locked SD cards.

SDIO cards are only fully functional in host devices designed to support their input-output functions (typically PDAs like the [[Palm Treo]], but occasionally laptops or mobile phones). These devices can use the SD slot to support [[GPS]] receivers, [[modem]]s, [[barcode reader]]s, [[FM radio]] tuners, TV tuners, [[RFID]] readers, [[digital camera]]s, and interfaces to [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]], [[Ethernet]], and [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]]. Many other SDIO devices have been proposed, but it is now more common for I/O devices to connect using the USB interface.\n\nSDIO cards support most of the memory commands of SD cards. SDIO cards can be structured as eight logical cards, although currently, the typical way that an SDIO card uses this capability is to structure itself as one I/O card and one memory card.\n\nThe SDIO and SD interfaces are mechanically and electrically identical. Host devices built for SDIO cards generally accept SD memory cards without I/O functions. However, the reverse is not true, because host devices need suitable drivers and applications to support the card's I/O functions. For example, an HP SDIO camera usually does not work with PDAs that do not list it as an accessory. Inserting an SDIO card into any SD slot causes no physical damage nor disruption to the host device, but users may be frustrated that the SDIO card does not function fully when inserted into a seemingly compatible slot. (USB and Bluetooth devices exhibit comparable compatibility issues, although to a lesser extent thanks to standardized [[Class driver|USB device classes]] and [[Bluetooth profiles]].)\n\nThe [[#SDIO|SDIO]] family comprises Low-Speed and Full-Speed cards. Both types of SDIO cards support SPI and one-bit SD bus types. Low-Speed SDIO cards are allowed to also support the four-bit SD bus; Full-Speed SDIO cards are required to support the four-bit SD bus. To use an SDIO card as a \"combo card\" (for both memory and I/O), the host device must first select four-bit SD bus operation. Two other unique features of Low-Speed SDIO are a maximum clock rate of 400&nbsp;kHz for all communications, and the use of Pin 8 as \"interrupt\" to try to initiate dialogue with the host device.<ref name=\"SDIOspec\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/sdio/sdio_spec/|title=Simplified Version of SDIO CARD SPEC|publisher=SD Association|accessdate=2011-12-09}}</ref>\n\n; Ganging cards together\nThe one-bit SD protocol was derived from the MMC protocol, which envisioned the ability to put up to three cards on a bus of common signal lines. The cards use [[open collector]] interfaces, where a card may pull a line to the low voltage level; the line is at the high voltage level (because of a [[pull-up resistor]]) if no card pulls it low. Though the cards shared clock and signal lines, each card had its own [[chip select]] line to sense that the host device had selected it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe SD protocol envisioned the ability to gang 30 cards together without separate chip select lines. The host device would broadcast commands to all cards and identify the card to respond to the command using its unique serial number.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn practice, cards are rarely ganged together because open-collector operation has problems at high speeds and increases power consumption. Newer versions of the SD specification recommend separate lines to each card.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Compatibility===\nHost devices that comply with newer versions of the specification provide [[backward compatibility]] and accept older SD cards.<ref name=\"sdcard.org\"/> For example, SDXC host devices accept all previous families of SD memory cards, and SDHC host devices also accept standard SD cards.\n\nOlder host devices generally do not support newer card formats, and even when they might support the bus interface used by the card,<ref name=sdcard_using_sdxc /> there are several factors that arise:\n\n* A newer card may offer [[#Types of cards|greater capacity]] than the host device can handle (over 4 GB for SDHC, over 32 GB for SDXC).\n* A newer card may use a [[#File system|file system]] the host device cannot navigate ([[FAT32]] for SDHC, [[exFAT]] for SDXC)\n* Use of an SDIO card requires the host device be designed for the input/output functions the card provides.\n* The hardware interface of the card was changed starting with the version 2.0 (new high-speed bus clocks, redefinition of [[#Storage capacity calculations|storage capacity bits]]) and [[#SDHC|SDHC]] family (Ultra-high speed (UHS) bus)\n* UHS-II has physically more pins but is backwards compatible to UHS-I and non-UHS for both slot and card.<ref name=\"sda_bus_speed\"/>\n* Some vendors produced SDSC cards above&nbsp;1GB before the SDA had standardized a method of doing so.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ SD compatibility table\n! {{Diagonal split header|Slot|Card}}\n! scope=\"col\" | SDSC\n! scope=\"col\" | SDHC\n! scope=\"col\" | SDHC<br/>UHS\n! scope=\"col\" | SDXC\n! scope=\"col\" | SDXC<br/>UHS \n! scope=\"col\" | SDIO\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDSC\n| {{Partial}}{{Efn|name=sdsccompat|See [[#Storage_capacity_and_compatibilities|discussion about storage capacity and compatibilities]]}} || {{Partial|FAT16,<4GiB}}{{Efn|name=sdsccompat}} || {{Partial|FAT16,<4GiB}}{{Efn|name=sdsccompat}} || {{No}} || {{No}} || {{No}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDHC\n| {{Yes}} || {{Yes}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs|In non-UHS mode}}}} || {{Partial|FAT32}} || {{Partial|FAT32{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}}  || {{No}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDHC UHS\n| {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} ||  {{Yes|Yes{{Efn|name=uhs|In UHS mode}}}} || {{Partial|FAT32{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{Partial|FAT32{{Efn|name=uhs}}}} ||  {{No}}\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDXC\n| {{Yes}} || {{Yes}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{Yes}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}}  || {{No}}\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDXC UHS\n| {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} ||  {{Yes|Yes{{Efn|name=uhs}}}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}}|| {{Yes|Yes{{Efn|name=uhs}}}} || {{No}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDIO\n| {{partial|Varies}} ||  {{partial|Varies}} || {{partial|Varies}} || {{partial|Varies}} || {{partial|Varies}} || {{Yes}}\n|}\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==Markets==\nSecure Digital cards are used in many consumer electronic devices, and have become a widespread means of storing several gigabytes of data in a small size.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Devices in which the user may remove and replace cards often, such as [[digital camera]]s, [[camcorder]]s, and [[video game console]]s, tend to use full-sized cards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Devices in which small size is paramount, such as [[mobile phone]]s, tend to use microSD cards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe microSD card has helped propel the smartphone market by giving both manufacturers and consumers greater flexibility and freedom.{{According to whom|date=October 2016}} Due to their compact size, microSD cards are used in many{{Which|date=October 2016}} different applications in a large variety{{Which|date=October 2016}} of markets.

They may also not present the best choice for applications that require higher storage capacities or speeds as provided by other flash card standards such as [[CompactFlash]]. These limitations may be addressed by evolving memory technologies, such as the new SD 7.0 specifications which allow storage capabilities of up to 128 TB.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sdcard.org/consumers/choices/speed_class/index.html |title=Speed Class Standards for Video Recording|website=SD Association |accessdate=21 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Samsung Pro 64gb micro-SDXC original and falsification front and back.jpg|thumb|[[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]] Pro 64&nbsp;GB microSDXC original (left) and counterfeit (right): The counterfeit claims to have 64&nbsp;GB in capacity, but only 8&nbsp;GB (Class 4 speed) are usable: When trying to write more than 8 GB, [[data loss]] occurs.

The files that were copied back can be tested either by comparing checksums (e.g. [[Md5sum|MD5]]), or trying to [[Data compression|compress]] them. The latter approach leverages the fact that counterfeited cards let the user read back files, which then consist of easily compressible uniform data (for example, repeating [[0xFF]]s).\n\n===Digital cameras===\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2016}}\nSD/MMC cards replaced [[Toshiba]]'s [[SmartMedia]] as the dominant memory card format used in digital cameras. In 2001, SmartMedia had achieved nearly 50% use, but by 2005 SD/MMC had achieved over 40% of the digital camera market and SmartMedia's share had plummeted by 2007.\n\nAt this time, all the leading digital camera manufacturers used SD in their consumer product lines, including [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], [[Casio]], [[Fujifilm]], [[Kodak]], [[Leica Camera|Leica]], [[Nikon]], [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]], [[Panasonic]], [[Pentax]], [[Ricoh]], [[Samsung]], and [[Sony]]. Formerly, [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] and [[Fujifilm]] used [[XD-Picture Card]]s (xD cards) exclusively, while [[Sony]] only used [[Memory Stick]]; by early 2010 all three supported SD.\n\nSome [[prosumer]] and professional digital cameras continued to offer [[CompactFlash]] (CF), either on a second card slot or as the only storage, as CF supports much higher maximum capacities and historically was cheaper for the same capacity.\n\nSecure Digital memory cards can be used in Sony [[XDCAM]] EX [[camcorder]]s with an adapter<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/micro-xdcamexsite/cat-accessories/product-MEADSD01/ |title=MEAD-SD01 SDHC card adapter (Sony) |publisher=Pro.sony.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> and in Panasonic [[P2 (storage media)|P2 card]] equipment with a [[MicroP2]] adapter.\n\n===Personal computers===\nAlthough many [[personal computer]]s accommodate SD cards as an auxiliary storage device using a built-in slot, or can accommodate SD cards by means of a USB adapter, SD cards cannot be used as the primary [[hard disk]] through the onboard [[Parallel ATA|ATA]] controller, because none of the SD card variants support ATA signalling.

However, on computers that support [[bootstrapping]] from a USB interface, an SD card in a USB adapter can be the primary hard disk, provided it contains an operating system that supports USB access once the bootstrap is complete.\n\nSince late 2009, newer [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computers with installed SD card readers have been able to boot in [[macOS]] from SD storage devices, when properly formatted to [[HFS Plus|Mac OS Extended]] file format and the default partition table set to [[GUID Partition Table]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3553 |title=About the SD and SDXC card slot |publisher=Support.apple.com |date=2013-06-08 |accessdate=2013-11-13}}</ref> (See [[#File system|Other file systems]] below).\n\nSD cards are increasing in usage and popular among owners of vintage computers like [[Atari 8-bit family|8-bit Atari]]. For example SIO2SD ([[Atari SIO|SIO]] is an Atari port for connecting external devices) is used nowadays. It may be an interesting fact that the whole collection of software for an 8-bit Atari may be included on one SD card that may have less than 4-8 GB of disk size (2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://retrohax.net/sio2sd-for-atari/|title=SIO2SD for 8-bit Atari|date=May 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Embedded systems===\n[[File:Arduino Ethernet Shield (pre-production sample).jpg|thumb|A shield ([[daughterboard]]) that gives [[Arduino]] prototyping microprocessors access to SD cards]]\n\nIn 2008, the SDA specified Embedded SD, \"leverag[ing] well-known SD standards\" to enable non-removable SD-style devices on printed circuit boards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Embedded SD|publisher=SD Association|url=http://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/embedded_sd/|accessdate=2011-11-30}}</ref> However this standard was not adopted by the market while the [[MultiMediaCard|MMC]] standard became the de facto standard for embedded systems.

The SPI bus mode and one-bit SD bus mode are mandatory for all SD families, as explained in the next section. Once the host device and the SD card negotiate a bus interface mode, the usage of the numbered pins is the same for all card sizes.\n* '''SPI bus mode:''' [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus]] is primarily used by embedded [[microcontroller]]s. This bus type supports only a 3.3-volt interface. This is the only bus type that does not require a host license.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n* '''One-bit SD bus mode:''' Separate command and data channels and a proprietary transfer format.\n* '''Four-bit SD bus mode:''' Uses extra pins plus some reassigned pins.

UHS-I and UHS-II require this bus type.\n* '''Two differential lines SD UHS-II mode:''' Uses two low-voltage differential interfaces to transfer commands and data.

The host device thereby sends 48-bit commands and receives responses. The card can signal that a response will be delayed, but the host device can abort the dialogue.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\"/>\n\nThrough issuing various commands, the host device can:<ref name=\"SDHCspec\"/>\n* Determine the type, memory capacity, and capabilities of the SD card\n* Command the card to use a different voltage, different clock speed, or advanced electrical interface\n* Prepare the card to receive a block to write to the flash memory, or read and reply with the contents of a specified block.\n\nThe command interface is an extension of the [[MultiMediaCard]] (MMC) interface. SD cards dropped support for some of the commands in the MMC protocol, but added commands related to copy protection. By using only commands supported by both standards until determining the type of card inserted, a host device can accommodate both SD and MMC cards.\n\n====Electrical interface====\nAll SD card families initially use a 3.3&nbsp;[[volt]] electrical interface. On command, SDHC and SDXC cards can switch to 1.8&nbsp;V operation.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" />\n\nAt initial power-up or card insertion, the host device selects either the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus or the one-bit SD bus by the voltage level present on Pin 1. Thereafter, the host device may issue a command to switch to the four-bit SD bus interface, if the SD card supports it. For various card types, support for the four-bit SD bus is either optional or mandatory.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" />\n\nAfter determining that the SD card supports it, the host device can also command the SD card to switch to a [[#Speeds|higher transfer speed]]. Until determining the card's capabilities, the host device should not use a clock speed faster than 400&nbsp;kHz. SD cards other than SDIO (see below) have a \"Default Speed\" clock rate of 25&nbsp;MHz. The host device is not required to use the maximum clock speed that the card supports. It may operate at less than the maximum clock speed to conserve power.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> Between commands, the host device can stop the clock entirely.\n\n====Achieving higher card speeds====\nThe SD specification defines four-bit-wide transfers. (The MMC specification supports this and also defines an eight-bit-wide mode; MMC cards with extended bits were not accepted by the market.) Transferring several bits on each clock pulse improves the card speed. Advanced SD families have also improved speed by offering faster clock frequencies and double data rate (explained [[#UHS Speed Class|here]]) in a high-speed differential interface (UHS-II).{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===File system===\nLike other types of [[flash memory]] card, an SD card of any SD family is a [[block (data storage)|block-addressable]] [[Data storage device|storage device]], in which the host device can read or write fixed-size blocks by specifying their block number.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n====MBR and FAT====\nMost SD cards ship preformatted with one or more [[Master boot record|MBR partitions]], where the first or only partition contains a [[file system]]. This lets them operate like the [[hard disk]] of a [[personal computer]]. Per the SD card specification, an SD card is formatted with MBR and the following file system:\n\n* For SDSC cards:\n** Capacity of less than 32,680 logical sectors<!-- This is the exact condition as per the SD card spec.

We mention the logical sector count rather than the allowed cluster range here as this article is about SD cards specifically. --> (smaller than 16 MB): [[FAT12]] with partition type [[Partition type#PID 01h|01h]] and [[BPB 3.0]] or [[EBPB 4.1]]<ref name=\"SDG_2000_SD-P2-V1.0\">{{cite book\n|title=SD Memory Card Specifications \u2013 PART 2 FILE SYSTEM SPECIFICATION \u2013 Version 1.0\n|author=<!-- Staff writer(s); no by-line -->\n|publisher=SD Group, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.

Universal support for FAT12, FAT16, FAT16B, and FAT32 allows the use of SDSC and SDHC cards on most host computers with a compatible SD reader, to present the user with the familiar method of named files in a hierarchical directory tree.\n\nOn such SD cards, standard utility programs such as Mac OS X's \"{{nowrap|[[Disk Utility]]}}\" or Windows' [[SCANDISK]] can be used to repair a corrupted filing system and sometimes recover deleted files. [[Defragmentation]] tools for FAT file systems may be used on such cards. The resulting consolidation of files may provide a marginal improvement in the time required to read or write the file,<ref name=\"Fragmentation_and_Speed\">{{Citation | url = https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/speed_class/ | title = Fragmentation and Speed | publisher = SD Card}}</ref> but not an improvement comparable to defragmentation of hard drives, where storing a file in multiple fragments requires additional physical, and relatively slow, movement of a drive head. Moreover, defragmentation performs writes to the SD card that count against the card's rated lifespan. The write endurance of the physical memory is discussed in the article on [[Flash memory degradation|flash memory]]; newer technology to increase the storage capacity of a card provides worse write endurance.\n\nWhen reformatting an SD card with a capacity of at least 32&nbsp;MB (65536 logical sectors or more), but not more than 2&nbsp;GB, [[FAT16B]] with partition type [[Partition type#PID 06h|06h]] and [[EBPB 4.1]]<ref name=\"SDG_2000_SD-P2-V1.0\"/> is recommended if the card is for a consumer device. (FAT16B is also an option for 4&nbsp;GB cards, but it requires the use of 64&nbsp;KiB [[cluster (file system)|clusters]], which are not widely supported.) FAT16B does not support cards above 4&nbsp;GB at all.\n\nThe SDXC specification mandates the use of [[Microsoft]]'s [[proprietary format|proprietary]] [[exFAT]] file system,<ref name=\"engadget_sdxc_2t_300m\">{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2009/01/07/sdxc-memory-cards-promise-2tb-of-storage-300mbps-transfer/ |title = SDXC memory cards promise 2 TB of storage, 300 MBps transfer | publisher=Engadget |date= 2009-01-07 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> which sometimes requires appropriate drivers (e.g. <code>exfat-utils</code>/<code>exfat-fuse</code> on Linux).\n\n====Other file systems====\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2016}}\nBecause the host views the SD card as a block storage device, the card does not require MBR partitions or any specific file system. The card can be reformatted to use any file system the operating system supports. For example:\n* Under [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], SD cards can be formatted using [[NTFS]] and, on later versions, [[exFAT]].\n* Under [[macOS]], SD cards can be partitioned as [[GUID Partition Table|GUID]] devices and formatted with either [[HFS Plus]] or [[Apple File System|APFS]] file systems or still use [[exFAT]].\n* Under [[Unix-like]] operating systems such as [[Linux]] or [[FreeBSD]], SD cards can be formatted using the [[Unix File System|UFS]], [[Ext2]], [[Ext3]], [[Ext4]], [[btrfs]], [[HFS Plus]], [[ReiserFS]] or [[F2FS]] file system. Additionally under Linux, [[HFS Plus]] file systems may be accessed for read/write if the \"hfsplus\" package is installed, and partitioned and formatted if \"hfsprogs\" is installed. (These package names are correct under Debian, Ubuntu etc., but may differ on other Linux distributions.)\n\nAny recent version of the above can format SD cards using the [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] file system.\n\nAdditionally, as with [[live USB]] flash drives, an SD card can have an operating system installed on it. Computers that can [[booting|boot]] from an SD card (either using a USB adapter or inserted into the computer's flash media reader) instead of the hard disk drive may thereby be able to recover from a corrupted hard disk drive.<ref>Any operating system used on [[Raspberry Pi]] generally have to boot off a Live SD, most commonly Raspbian.</ref> Such an SD card can be [[#Card security|write-locked]] to preserve the system's integrity.\n\nThe SD Standard allows usage of only the above-mentioned Microsoft FAT file systems and any card produced in the market shall be preloaded with the related standard file system upon its delivery to the market. If any application or user re-formats the card with a non-standard file system the proper operation of the card, including interoperability, cannot be assured.\n\n====Risks of reformatting====\nReformatting an SD card with a different file system, or even with the same one, may make the card slower, or shorten its lifespan. Some cards use [[wear leveling]], in which frequently modified blocks are mapped to different portions of memory at different times, and some wear-leveling algorithms are designed for the access patterns typical of FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/428584/ |title=Optimizing Linux with cheap flash drives |publisher=Linux Weekly News|accessdate=2011-04-11}}</ref> In addition, the preformatted file system may use a cluster size that matches the erase region of the physical memory on the card; reformatting may change the cluster size and make writes less efficient.  The SD Association provides freely-downloadable SD Formatter software to overcome these problems for Windows and Mac OS X.<ref name=sdfmt>[https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_3/ SD Formatter 3.1 for SD/SDHC/SDXC], SD Association</ref>\n\nSD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards have a \"Protected Area\" on the card for the SD standard's security function.  Neither standard formatters nor the SD Association formatter will erase it.  The SD Association suggests that devices or software which use the SD security function may format it.<ref name=sdfmt/>\n\n===Power consumption===\nThe power consumption of SD cards varies by its speed mode, manufacturer and model.\n\nDuring transfer it may be in the range of 66\u2013330&nbsp;mW (20\u2013100&nbsp;mA at a supply voltage of 3.3&nbsp;V). Specifications from TwinMos technologies list a maximum of 149&nbsp;mW (45&nbsp;mA) during transfer. Toshiba lists 264\u2013330&nbsp;mW (80\u2013100&nbsp;mA).<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.toshiba-memory.com/en/micro_sd_cards.html | contribution = microSD & microSDHC Cards | publisher = Toshiba | title = Memory Solutions}}</ref> Standby current is much lower, less than 0.2&nbsp;mA for one 2006 microSD card.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.dtt8.com/images/micro-sd%20specification.pdf | publisher = DTT | title = Micro SD specification | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130207004550/http://www.dtt8.com/images/micro-sd%20specification.pdf | archive-date = 2013-02-07 | df =  }}</ref> If there is data transfer for significant periods, battery life may be reduced noticeably (smartphones typically have batteries of capacity around 6&nbsp;Wh (Samsung Galaxy S2, 1650&nbsp;mAh @ 3.7&nbsp;V)).\n\nModern UHS-II cards can consume up to 2.88&nbsp;W, if the host device supports bus speed mode SDR104 or UHS-II.

In standard-capacity cards (SDSC), 12 bits identify the number of memory clusters (ranging from 1 to 4,096) and 3 bits identify the number of blocks per cluster (which decode to 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, or 512 blocks per cluster). The host device multiplies these figures (as shown in the following section) with the number of bytes per block to determine the card's capacity in bytes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nSD version 1.00 assumed 512 bytes per block. This permitted SDSC cards up to 4,096 \u00d7 512 \u00d7 512 B = 1&nbsp;GiB, for which there are no known incompatibilities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nVersion 1.01 let an SDSC card use a 4-bit field to indicate 1,024 or 2,048 bytes per block instead.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> Doing so enabled cards with 2&nbsp;GB and 4&nbsp;GB capacity, such as the Transcend 4&nbsp;GB SD card and the Memorette 4 GB SD card.\n\nEarly SDSC host devices that assume 512-byte blocks therefore do not fully support the insertion of 2&nbsp;GB or 4&nbsp;GB cards. In some cases, the host device can read data that happens to reside in the first 1&nbsp;GB of the card. If the assumption is made in the driver software, success may be version-dependent. In addition, any host device might not support a 4&nbsp;GB SDSC card, since the specification lets it assume that 2&nbsp;GB is the maximum for these cards.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Storage capacity calculations===\nThe format of the Card-Specific Data (CSD) register changed between version 1 (SDSC) and version 2.0 (which defines SDHC and SDXC).\n\n====Version 1====\nIn version 1 of the SD specification, capacities up to 2&nbsp;GB are calculated by combining fields of the CSD as follows:\n\n Capacity = ('''C_SIZE''' + 1) \u00d7 2<sup>('''C_SIZE_MULT''' + '''READ_BL_LEN''' + 2)</sup>\n where\n   0 \u2264 '''C_SIZE''' \u2264 4095,\n   0 \u2264 '''C_SIZE_MULT''' \u2264 7,\n   '''READ_BL_LEN''' is 9 (for 512 bytes/sector) or 10 (for 1024 bytes/sector)\n\nLater versions state (at Section 4.3.2) that a 2&nbsp;GB SDSC card shall set its READ_BL_LEN (and WRITE_BL_LEN) to indicate 1024 bytes, so that the above computation correctly reports the card's capacity; but that, for consistency, the host device shall not request (by CMD16) block lengths over 512 B.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" />\n\n====Versions 2 and 3====\nIn the definition of SDHC cards in version 2.0, the C_SIZE portion of the CSD is 22 bits and it indicates the memory size in multiples of 512&nbsp;KiB (the C_SIZE_MULT field is removed and READ_BL_LEN is no longer used to compute capacity). Two bits that were formerly reserved now identify the card family: 0 is SDSC; 1 is SDHC or SDXC; 2 and 3 are reserved.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> Because of these redefinitions, older host devices do not correctly identify SDHC or SDXC cards nor their correct capacity.\n\n* SDHC cards are restricted to reporting a capacity not over 32&nbsp;GB.\n* SDXC cards are allowed to use all 22 bits of the C_SIZE field. An SDHC card that did so (reported C_SIZE > 65375 to indicate a capacity of over 32&nbsp;GB) would violate the specification. A host device that relied on C_SIZE rather than the specification to determine the card's maximum capacity might support such a card, but the card might fail in other SDHC-compatible host devices.\n\nCapacity is calculated thus:\n\n Capacity = ('''C_SIZE''' + 1) \u00d7 524288\n where for SDHC  \n   4112 \u2264 '''C_SIZE''' \u2264 65375  \n   \u22482&nbsp;GB \u2264 Capacity \u2264 \u224832&nbsp;GB\n where for SDXC \n   65535 \u2264 '''C_SIZE'''\n   \u224832&nbsp;GB \u2264 Capacity \u2264 2&nbsp;TB\n\nCapacities above 4&nbsp;GB can only be achieved by following version 2.0 or later versions. In addition, capacities equal to 4&nbsp;GB must also do so to guarantee compatibility.\n\n==Openness of specification==\n[[File:SD-microSD adaptor.jpg|thumb|upright|Dismantled microSD to SD adapter showing the passive connection from the microSD card slot on the bottom to the SD pins on the top]]\n\nLike most memory card formats, SD is covered by numerous [[patent]]s and [[trademark]]s. Excluding [[Secure Digital#SDIO cards|SDIO]] cards, [[Royalty payment|royalties]] for SD card licenses are imposed for manufacture and sale of memory cards and host adapters (US$1,000/year plus membership at US$1,500/year)\n\nEarly versions of the SD specification were available under a [[non-disclosure agreement]] (NDA) prohibiting development of [[open-source software|open-source]] drivers. However, the system was eventually [[reverse-engineered]] and free software drivers provided access to SD cards not using DRM. Subsequent to the release of most open-source drivers, the SDA provided a simplified version of the specification under a less restrictive license helping reduce some incompatibility issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/20060 |title=Sharp Linux PDA promotes the use of proprietary SD card, but more open MMC works just fine |publisher=Linux.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\nUnder a disclaimers agreement, the simplified specification released by the SDA in 2006 \u2013 as opposed to that of SD cards \u2013 which later extended to the physical layer, ASSD extensions, SDIO, and SDIO [[Bluetooth]] Type-A.<ref>[http://www.sdcard.org/developers/tech/sdcard/pls/ Simplified Specification Agreement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028165644/http://www.sdcard.org/developers/tech/sdcard/pls/ |date=2008-10-28 }} from the SDA's website</ref> Again, most of the information had already been discovered and [[Linux]] had a fully free driver for it. Still, building a chip conforming to this specification caused the [[One Laptop per Child]] project to claim \"the first truly Open Source SD implementation, with no need to obtain an SDI license or sign NDAs to create SD drivers or applications.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mailman.laptop.org/pipermail/community-news/2006-September/000023.html |title=OLPC mailing list archive |publisher=Mailman.laptop.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412094819/http://mailman.laptop.org/pipermail/community-news/2006-September/000023.html|archivedate=2011-04-12}}</ref>\n\nThe proprietary nature of the complete SD specification affects [[embedded system]]s, laptop computers, and some desktop computers; many desktop computers do not have card slots, instead using [[USB]]-based [[card reader#Memory card readers|card readers]] if necessary. These card readers present a standard [[USB mass storage]] interface to memory cards, thus separating the operating system from the details of the underlying SD interface. However, embedded systems (such as portable music players) usually gain direct access to SD cards and thus need complete programming information. Desktop card readers are themselves embedded systems; their manufacturers have usually paid the SDA for complete access to the SD specifications. Many notebook computers now include SD card readers not based on USB; device drivers for these essentially gain direct access to the SD card, as do embedded systems.\n\nThe [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]]-bus interface mode is the only type that does not require a host license for accessing SD cards.\n\n==Comparison to other flash memory formats==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:Flash memory cards size.jpg|thumb|upright|Size comparison of various flash cards: SD, [[CompactFlash]], [[MultiMediaCard|MMC]], [[xD-Picture Card|xD]]]]\n\nOverall, SD is less open than [[CompactFlash]] or [[USB flash drive|USB flash memory drives]]. Those [[open standard]]s can be implemented without paying for licensing, royalties, or documentation. (CompactFlash and USB flash drives may require licensing fees for the use of the SDA's trademarked logos.)\n\nHowever, SD is much more open than [[Memory Stick|Sony's Memory Stick]], for which no public documentation nor any documented legacy implementation is available. All SD cards can be accessed freely using the well-documented [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]] bus.\n\n[[xD-Picture Card|xD]] cards are simply 18-pin [[NAND flash]] chips in a special package and support [[XD-Picture Card#Raw hardware|the standard command set]] for raw NAND flash access. Although the raw hardware interface to xD cards is well understood, the layout of its memory contents\u2014necessary for interoperability with xD card readers and digital cameras\u2014is totally undocumented. The consortium that licenses xD cards has not released any technical information to the public.\n\n{{Comparison of memory cards}}\n\n==Data recovery==\nA malfunctioning SD card can be repaired using specialized equipment, as long as the middle part, containing the flash storage, is not physically damaged. The controller can in this way be circumvented.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.acelaboratory.com/pc-3000-flash-circuit-board-and-msd-card-preparing-and-soldering.html|title=PC-3000 Flash.
