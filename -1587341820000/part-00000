French author [[\u00c9mile Gaboriau]]'s [[Monsieur Lecoq (novel)|''Monsieur Lecoq'']] (1868) laid the groundwork for the methodical, scientifically minded detective.\n\nThe evolution of [[Locked room mystery|locked room mysteries]] was one of the landmarks in the history of crime fiction. The [[Canon of Sherlock Holmes|Sherlock Holmes mysteries]] of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] are said to have been singularly responsible for the huge popularity in this genre. A precursor was [[Paul F\u00e9val]], whose series ''[[Les Habits Noirs]]'' (1862\u201367) features [[Scotland Yard]] detectives and criminal conspiracies. The best-selling crime novel of the nineteenth century was [[Fergus Hume]]'s ''[[The Mystery of a Hansom Cab]]'' (1886), set in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nThe evolution of the print [[mass media]] in the United Kingdom and the United States in the latter half of the 19th century was crucial in popularising crime fiction and related genres. Literary 'variety' magazines like ''Strand'', ''[[McClure's]]'', and ''[[Harper's]]'' quickly became central to the overall structure and function of [[popular fiction]] in society, providing a [[Mass production|mass-produced]] medium that offered cheap, illustrated publications that were essentially disposable.\n\nLike the works of many other important fiction writers of his day\u2014e.g. [[Wilkie Collins]] and [[Charles Dickens]]\u2014Arthur [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Conan Doyle]]'s Sherlock Holmes stories first appeared in serial form in the monthly [[Strand Magazine|''Strand'']] magazine in the United Kingdom. The series quickly attracted a wide and passionate following on both sides of the Atlantic, and when Doyle killed off Holmes in ''[[The Final Problem]]'', the public outcry was so great, and the publishing offers for more stories so attractive, that he was reluctantly forced to resurrect him.\n\nIn Italy early translations of English and American stories and local works were published in cheap yellow covers and thus the genre was baptized with the term \"Libri gialli\" or yellow books. The genre was outlawed by the Fascists during [[World War II|WWII]] but exploded in popularity after the war, especially influenced by the American [[Hardboiled crime fiction|hard-boiled]] school of crime fiction. There emerged a group of mainstream Italian writers who used the detective format to create an anti-detective or postmodern novel in which the detectives are imperfect, the crimes usually unsolved and clues left for the reader to decipher. Famous writers include [[Leonardo Sciascia]], [[Umberto Eco]], and [[Carlo Emilio Gadda]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~gjdemko/nyaag.htm|title=The International Diffusion and Adaptation of the Crime Fiction Genre|last=Demko|first=George J|website=www.dartmouth.edu|access-date=2018-03-21}}</ref>\n\nIn Spain, ''The Nail and other Tales of Mystery and Crime'' was published by [[Pedro Antonio de Alarc\u00f3n]] in 1853. Crime fiction in Spain (also curtailed in [[Francoist Spain]]) took on some very special characteristics that reflected the culture of the country. The Spanish writers emphasized the corruption and ineptitude of the police and depicted the authorities and the wealthy in very negative terms.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn China, modern crime fiction was first developed from translations of foreign works from the 1890s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Giving Texts a Context: Chinese Translations of Classical English Detective Stories, 1896-1916|last=Hung|first=Eva|publisher=David Pollard, ed.,Translation and Creation|year=1998|isbn=9027216282|location=Amsterdam ; Philadelphia|pages=151\u2013176}}</ref> [[Cheng Xiaoqing]], considered \"The Grand Master\" of twentieth-century Chinese detective fiction, translated Sherlock Holmes into classical and vernacular Chinese.

Readers speak of crime fiction as a mode of escapism  to cope with other aspects of their life.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Brewster|first=Liz|date=2017-03-01|title=Murder by the book: using crime fiction as a bibliotherapeutic resource|url=http://mh.bmj.com/content/43/1/62|journal=Medical Humanities|language=en|volume=43|issue=1|pages=62\u201367|doi=10.1136/medhum-2016-011069|issn=1468-215X|pmid=27799411}}</ref> Crime fiction provides distraction from readers\u2019 personal lives through a strong narrative at a comfortable distance.<ref name=\":1\" /> Forensic crime novels have been referred to as \u2018''distraction therapy''\u2019, proposing that crime fiction can improve mental health and be considered as a form of treatment to prevent depression.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Categories ==\n* [[Detective fiction]]: a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or a detective\u2014either professional, amateur or retired\u2014investigates a crime, often murder\n* The [[cozy mystery]]: a subgenre of detective fiction in which profanity, sex, and violence are downplayed or treated humorously.\n* The [[whodunit]]: the most common form of detective fiction. It features a complex, plot-driven story in which the reader is provided with clues from which the identity of the perpetrator of the crime may be deduced before the solution is revealed at the end of the book.\n* The [[historical whodunnit]]: also a subgenre of [[historical fiction]]. The setting of the story and the crime has some historical significance.\n* The [[locked room mystery]]: a specialized kind of a whodunit in which the crime is committed under apparently impossible circumstances, such as a locked room which no intruder could have entered or left.\n* The American [[hardboiled]] school: distinguished by the unsentimental portrayal of sex and violence; the sleuth usually also confronts danger and engages in violence.\n* The [[police procedural]]: the detective is a member of the police, and thus the activities of a police force are usually convincingly depicted.\n* [[Forensic]] crime fiction; similar to the police procedural. The investigator the reader follows is usually a medical examiner or pathologist\u2014they must use the forensic evidence left on the body and at the crime scene to catch the killer. This subgenre was first introduced by [[Patricia Cornwell]].\n* The [[legal thriller]]: the major characters are lawyers and their employees, and they become involved in proving their cases.\n* The [[spy fiction|spy novel]]: the major characters are [[Espionage|spies]], usually working for an [[intelligence agency]].\n* The [[caper story]] and the criminal novel: the stories are told from the point of view of the criminals.\n* The [[psychological thriller]] or psychological suspense: this specific subgenre of the [[Thriller (genre)|thriller genre]] also incorporates elements from detective fiction, as the protagonist must solve the mystery of the psychological conflict presented in these types of stories.\n* The [[parody]] or spoof.\n* The crime thriller: A thriller in which the central characters are involved in crime, either in its investigation, as the perpetrator or, less commonly, a victim.\n\n=== Pseudonymous authors ===\nAs far as the history of crime fiction is concerned, some authors have been reluctant to publish their crime novels under their real names. More currently, some publish pseudonymously because of the belief that since the large booksellers are aware of their historical sales figures, and command a certain degree of influence over publishers, the only way to \"break out\" of their current advance numbers is to publish as someone with no track record.\n\nIn the late 1930s and 40s, British County Court judge Arthur Alexander Gordon Clark (1900\u20131958) published a number of detective novels under the alias [[Cyril Hare]] in which he made use of his profoundly extensive knowledge of the English legal system. When he was still young and unknown, award-winning British [[novelist]] [[Julian Barnes]] (born 1946) published some crime novels under the alias Dan Kavanagh. Other authors take delight in cherishing their [[alter ego]]s: [[Ruth Rendell]] (1930\u20132015) writes one sort of crime novels as Ruth Rendell and another type as [[Barbara Vine]]; [[John Dickson Carr]] also used the pseudonym [[Carter Dickson]]. The author [[Evan Hunter]] (which itself was a pseudonym) wrote his crime fiction under the name of Ed McBain.\n\n==Availability of crime novels==\n\n===Quality and availability===\nAs with any other entity, quality of a crime fiction book is not in any meaningful proportion to its availability. Some of the crime novels generally regarded as the finest, including those regularly chosen by experts as belonging to the best 100 crime novels ever written (see bibliography), have been [[out of print]] ever since their first publication, which often dates back to the 1920s or 30s. The bulk of books that can be found today on the shelves labelled \"Crime\" consists of recent first publications usually no older than a few years.\n\n===Classics and bestsellers===\nFurthermore, only a select few authors have achieved the status of \"classics\" for their published works. A classic is any text that can be received and accepted universally, because they transcend context. A popular, well known example is [[Agatha Christie]], whose texts, originally published between 1920 and her death in 1976, are available in UK and US editions in all English speaking nations. Christie's works, particularly featuring detectives [[Hercule Poirot]] or [[Miss Jane Marple]], have given her the title the 'Queen of Crime' and made her one of the most important and innovative writers in the development of the genre. Her most famous novels include ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1934), ''[[Death on the Nile]]'' (1937), and the world's best-selling mystery ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' (1939).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/21-best-selling-books-of-all-time.htm|title=21 Best-Selling Books of All Time|last=Davies|first=Helen|author2=Marjorie Dorfman|author3=Mary Fons|author4=Deborah Hawkins|author5=Martin Hintz|author6=Linnea Lundgren|author7=David Priess|author8=Julia Clark Robinson|author9=Paul Seaburn|author10=Heidi Stevens|author11=Steve Theunissen|date=14 September 2007|publisher=Editors of Publications International, Ltd.|accessdate=2009-03-25}}</ref>\n\nOther less successful, contemporary authors who are still writing have seen reprints of their earlier works, due to current overwhelming popularity of crime fiction texts among audiences. One example is [[Val McDermid]], whose first book appeared as far back as 1987; another is [[Florida]]-based author [[Carl Hiaasen]], who has been publishing books since 1981, all of which are readily available.\n\n===Revival of past classics===\nFrom time to time publishing houses decide, for commercial purposes, to revive long-forgotten authors and reprint one or two of their more commercially successful novels. Apart from [[Penguin Books]], who for this purpose have resorted to their old green cover and dug out some of their vintage authors, Pan started a series in 1999 entitled \"Pan Classic Crime,\" which includes a handful of novels by [[Eric Ambler]], but also American [[Hillary Waugh]]'s ''[[Last Seen Wearing ... (Hillary Waugh novel)|Last Seen Wearing ...]]''. In 2000, [[Edinburgh]]-based [[Canongate Books]] started a series called \"Canongate Crime Classics,\" \u2014both a [[whodunnit]] and a ''roman noir'' about [[amnesia]] and [[insanity]]\u2014and other novels. However, books brought out by smaller publishers like Canongate Books are usually not stocked by the larger bookshops and overseas booksellers. The British Library has also (since 2012) starting republishing \"lost\" crime classics, with the collection referred to on their website as \"British Library Crime Classics series\".\n\nSometimes older crime novels are revived by screenwriters and directors rather than publishing houses. In many such cases, publishers then follow suit and release a so-called \"film tie-in\" edition showing a still from the movie on the front cover and the film credits on the back cover of the book\u2014yet another marketing strategy aimed at those cinemagoers who may want to do both: first read the book and then watch the film (or vice versa). Recent examples include [[Patricia Highsmith]]'s ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'' (originally published in 1955), [[Ira Levin]]'s ''[[Sliver (novel)|Sliver]]'' (1991), with the cover photograph depicting a steamy sex scene between [[Sharon Stone]] and [[William Baldwin]] straight from the [[Sliver (film)|1993 movie]], and, again, [[Bret Easton Ellis]]'s ''[[American Psycho]]'' (1991). [[Bloomsbury Publishing PLC]] on the other hand have launched what they call \"Bloomsbury Film Classics\"\u2014a series of original novels on which feature films were based. This series includes, for example, [[Ethel Lina White]]'s novel ''The Wheel Spins'' (1936), which [[Alfred Hitchcock]]\u2014before he went to Hollywood\u2014turned into a much-loved movie entitled ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938), and [[Ira Levin]]'s (born 1929) science fiction thriller ''[[The Boys from Brazil (novel)|The Boys from Brazil]]'' (1976), which was filmed in [[The Boys from Brazil (film)|1978]].\n\nOlder novels can often be retrieved from the ever-growing [[Project Gutenberg]] database.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Novels|Literature|Society}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time]]\n* [[Detective fiction]]\n* [[Murder mystery game]]\n* [[Mystery fiction]]\n* [[Mystery film]]\n* [[List of crime writers]]\n* [[List of female detective characters]]\n* [[Whodunit]]\n* [[Hardboiled]]\n* [[Art theft]]\n* [[Crime Writers' Association]]\n* [[Crime comics]]\n* [[Giallo]]\n* [[Scandinavian noir]]\n* [[Western (genre)|Western]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''[[The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time|The Crown Crime Companion.]] The Top 100 Mystery Novels of All Time Selected by the Mystery Writers of America'', annotated by Otto Penzler, compiled by Mickey Friedman (New York, 1995, {{ISBN|0-517-88115-2}})\n* [[William L.

The best-selling crime novel of the nineteenth century was [[Fergus Hume]]'s ''[[The Mystery of a Hansom Cab]]'' (1886), set in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nThe evolution of the print [[mass media]] in the United Kingdom and the United States in the latter half of the 19th century was crucial in popularising crime fiction and related genres. Literary 'variety' magazines like ''Strand'', ''[[McClure's]]'', and ''[[Harper's]]'' quickly became central to the overall structure and function of [[popular fiction]] in society, providing a [[Mass production|mass-produced]] medium that offered cheap, illustrated publications that were essentially disposable.\n\nLike the works of many other important fiction writers of his day\u2014e.g. [[Wilkie Collins]] and [[Charles Dickens]]\u2014Arthur [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Conan Doyle]]'s Sherlock Holmes stories first appeared in serial form in the monthly [[Strand Magazine|''Strand'']] magazine in the United Kingdom. The series quickly attracted a wide and passionate following on both sides of the Atlantic, and when Doyle killed off Holmes in ''[[The Final Problem]]'', the public outcry was so great, and the publishing offers for more stories so attractive, that he was reluctantly forced to resurrect him.\n\nIn Italy early translations of English and American stories and local works were published in cheap yellow covers and thus the genre was baptized with the term \"Libri gialli\" or yellow books. The genre was outlawed by the Fascists during [[World War II|WWII]] but exploded in popularity after the war, especially influenced by the American [[Hardboiled crime fiction|hard-boiled]] school of crime fiction. There emerged a group of mainstream Italian writers who used the detective format to create an anti-detective or postmodern novel in which the detectives are imperfect, the crimes usually unsolved and clues left for the reader to decipher. Famous writers include [[Leonardo Sciascia]], [[Umberto Eco]], and [[Carlo Emilio Gadda]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~gjdemko/nyaag.htm|title=The International Diffusion and Adaptation of the Crime Fiction Genre|last=Demko|first=George J|website=www.dartmouth.edu|access-date=2018-03-21}}</ref>\n\nIn Spain, ''The Nail and other Tales of Mystery and Crime'' was published by [[Pedro Antonio de Alarc\u00f3n]] in 1853. Crime fiction in Spain (also curtailed in [[Francoist Spain]]) took on some very special characteristics that reflected the culture of the country. The Spanish writers emphasized the corruption and ineptitude of the police and depicted the authorities and the wealthy in very negative terms.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn China, modern crime fiction was first developed from translations of foreign works from the 1890s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Giving Texts a Context: Chinese Translations of Classical English Detective Stories, 1896-1916|last=Hung|first=Eva|publisher=David Pollard, ed.,Translation and Creation|year=1998|isbn=9027216282|location=Amsterdam ; Philadelphia|pages=151\u2013176}}</ref> [[Cheng Xiaoqing]], considered \"The Grand Master\" of twentieth-century Chinese detective fiction, translated Sherlock Holmes into classical and vernacular Chinese.

Readers speak of crime fiction as a mode of escapism  to cope with other aspects of their life.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Brewster|first=Liz|date=2017-03-01|title=Murder by the book: using crime fiction as a bibliotherapeutic resource|url=http://mh.bmj.com/content/43/1/62|journal=Medical Humanities|language=en|volume=43|issue=1|pages=62\u201367|doi=10.1136/medhum-2016-011069|issn=1468-215X|pmid=27799411}}</ref> Crime fiction provides distraction from readers\u2019 personal lives through a strong narrative at a comfortable distance.<ref name=\":1\" /> Forensic crime novels have been referred to as \u2018''distraction therapy''\u2019, proposing that crime fiction can improve mental health and be considered as a form of treatment to prevent depression.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Categories ==\n* [[Detective fiction]]: a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or a detective\u2014either professional, amateur or retired\u2014investigates a crime, often murder\n* The [[cozy mystery]]: a subgenre of detective fiction in which profanity, sex, and violence are downplayed or treated humorously.\n* The [[whodunit]]: the most common form of detective fiction. It features a complex, plot-driven story in which the reader is provided with clues from which the identity of the perpetrator of the crime may be deduced before the solution is revealed at the end of the book.\n* The [[historical whodunnit]]: also a subgenre of [[historical fiction]]. The setting of the story and the crime has some historical significance.\n* The [[locked room mystery]]: a specialized kind of a whodunit in which the crime is committed under apparently impossible circumstances, such as a locked room which no intruder could have entered or left.\n* The American [[hardboiled]] school: distinguished by the unsentimental portrayal of sex and violence; the sleuth usually also confronts danger and engages in violence.\n* The [[police procedural]]: the detective is a member of the police, and thus the activities of a police force are usually convincingly depicted.\n* [[Forensic]] crime fiction; similar to the police procedural. The investigator the reader follows is usually a medical examiner or pathologist\u2014they must use the forensic evidence left on the body and at the crime scene to catch the killer. This subgenre was first introduced by [[Patricia Cornwell]].\n* The [[legal thriller]]: the major characters are lawyers and their employees, and they become involved in proving their cases.\n* The [[spy fiction|spy novel]]: the major characters are [[Espionage|spies]], usually working for an [[intelligence agency]].\n* The [[caper story]] and the criminal novel: the stories are told from the point of view of the criminals.\n* The [[psychological thriller]] or psychological suspense: this specific subgenre of the [[Thriller (genre)|thriller genre]] also incorporates elements from detective fiction, as the protagonist must solve the mystery of the psychological conflict presented in these types of stories.\n* The [[parody]] or spoof.\n* The crime thriller: A thriller in which the central characters are involved in crime, either in its investigation, as the perpetrator or, less commonly, a victim.\n\n=== Pseudonymous authors ===\nAs far as the history of crime fiction is concerned, some authors have been reluctant to publish their crime novels under their real names. More currently, some publish pseudonymously because of the belief that since the large booksellers are aware of their historical sales figures, and command a certain degree of influence over publishers, the only way to \"break out\" of their current advance numbers is to publish as someone with no track record.\n\nIn the late 1930s and 40s, British County Court judge Arthur Alexander Gordon Clark (1900\u20131958) published a number of detective novels under the alias [[Cyril Hare]] in which he made use of his profoundly extensive knowledge of the English legal system. When he was still young and unknown, award-winning British [[novelist]] [[Julian Barnes]] (born 1946) published some crime novels under the alias Dan Kavanagh. Other authors take delight in cherishing their [[alter ego]]s: [[Ruth Rendell]] (1930\u20132015) writes one sort of crime novels as Ruth Rendell and another type as [[Barbara Vine]]; [[John Dickson Carr]] also used the pseudonym [[Carter Dickson]]. The author [[Evan Hunter]] (which itself was a pseudonym) wrote his crime fiction under the name of Ed McBain.\n\n==Availability of crime novels==\n\n===Quality and availability===\nAs with any other entity, quality of a crime fiction book is not in any meaningful proportion to its availability. Some of the crime novels generally regarded as the finest, including those regularly chosen by experts as belonging to the best 100 crime novels ever written (see bibliography), have been [[out of print]] ever since their first publication, which often dates back to the 1920s or 30s. The bulk of books that can be found today on the shelves labelled \"Crime\" consists of recent first publications usually no older than a few years.\n\n===Classics and bestsellers===\nFurthermore, only a select few authors have achieved the status of \"classics\" for their published works. A classic is any text that can be received and accepted universally, because they transcend context. A popular, well known example is [[Agatha Christie]], whose texts, originally published between 1920 and her death in 1976, are available in UK and US editions in all English speaking nations. Christie's works, particularly featuring detectives [[Hercule Poirot]] or [[Miss Jane Marple]], have given her the title the 'Queen of Crime' and made her one of the most important and innovative writers in the development of the genre. Her most famous novels include ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1934), ''[[Death on the Nile]]'' (1937), and the world's best-selling mystery ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' (1939).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/21-best-selling-books-of-all-time.htm|title=21 Best-Selling Books of All Time|last=Davies|first=Helen|author2=Marjorie Dorfman|author3=Mary Fons|author4=Deborah Hawkins|author5=Martin Hintz|author6=Linnea Lundgren|author7=David Priess|author8=Julia Clark Robinson|author9=Paul Seaburn|author10=Heidi Stevens|author11=Steve Theunissen|date=14 September 2007|publisher=Editors of Publications International, Ltd.|accessdate=2009-03-25}}</ref>\n\nOther less successful, contemporary authors who are still writing have seen reprints of their earlier works, due to current overwhelming popularity of crime fiction texts among audiences. One example is [[Val McDermid]], whose first book appeared as far back as 1987; another is [[Florida]]-based author [[Carl Hiaasen]], who has been publishing books since 1981, all of which are readily available.\n\n===Revival of past classics===\nFrom time to time publishing houses decide, for commercial purposes, to revive long-forgotten authors and reprint one or two of their more commercially successful novels. Apart from [[Penguin Books]], who for this purpose have resorted to their old green cover and dug out some of their vintage authors, Pan started a series in 1999 entitled \"Pan Classic Crime,\" which includes a handful of novels by [[Eric Ambler]], but also American [[Hillary Waugh]]'s ''[[Last Seen Wearing ... (Hillary Waugh novel)|Last Seen Wearing ...]]''. In 2000, [[Edinburgh]]-based [[Canongate Books]] started a series called \"Canongate Crime Classics,\" \u2014both a [[whodunnit]] and a ''roman noir'' about [[amnesia]] and [[insanity]]\u2014and other novels. However, books brought out by smaller publishers like Canongate Books are usually not stocked by the larger bookshops and overseas booksellers. The British Library has also (since 2012) starting republishing \"lost\" crime classics, with the collection referred to on their website as \"British Library Crime Classics series\".\n\nSometimes older crime novels are revived by screenwriters and directors rather than publishing houses. In many such cases, publishers then follow suit and release a so-called \"film tie-in\" edition showing a still from the movie on the front cover and the film credits on the back cover of the book\u2014yet another marketing strategy aimed at those cinemagoers who may want to do both: first read the book and then watch the film (or vice versa). Recent examples include [[Patricia Highsmith]]'s ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'' (originally published in 1955), [[Ira Levin]]'s ''[[Sliver (novel)|Sliver]]'' (1991), with the cover photograph depicting a steamy sex scene between [[Sharon Stone]] and [[William Baldwin]] straight from the [[Sliver (film)|1993 movie]], and, again, [[Bret Easton Ellis]]'s ''[[American Psycho]]'' (1991). [[Bloomsbury Publishing PLC]] on the other hand have launched what they call \"Bloomsbury Film Classics\"\u2014a series of original novels on which feature films were based. This series includes, for example, [[Ethel Lina White]]'s novel ''The Wheel Spins'' (1936), which [[Alfred Hitchcock]]\u2014before he went to Hollywood\u2014turned into a much-loved movie entitled ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]'' (1938), and [[Ira Levin]]'s (born 1929) science fiction thriller ''[[The Boys from Brazil (novel)|The Boys from Brazil]]'' (1976), which was filmed in [[The Boys from Brazil (film)|1978]].\n\nOlder novels can often be retrieved from the ever-growing [[Project Gutenberg]] database.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Novels|Literature|Society}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time]]\n* [[Detective fiction]]\n* [[Murder mystery game]]\n* [[Mystery fiction]]\n* [[Mystery film]]\n* [[List of crime writers]]\n* [[List of female detective characters]]\n* [[Whodunit]]\n* [[Hardboiled]]\n* [[Art theft]]\n* [[Crime Writers' Association]]\n* [[Crime comics]]\n* [[Giallo]]\n* [[Scandinavian noir]]\n* [[Western (genre)|Western]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''[[The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time|The Crown Crime Companion.]] The Top 100 Mystery Novels of All Time Selected by the Mystery Writers of America'', annotated by Otto Penzler, compiled by Mickey Friedman (New York, 1995, {{ISBN|0-517-88115-2}})\n* [[William L.

{"title_page": "Chinese numerals", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=July 2009}}\n{{Numeral systems}}\n\n'''Chinese numerals''' are words and characters used to denote [[number]]s in [[Chinese language|Chinese]].\n\nToday, speakers of Chinese use three written [[numeral system]]s: the system of [[Arabic numerals]] used worldwide, and two indigenous systems. The more familiar indigenous system is based on [[Chinese character]]s that correspond to [[Numeral (linguistics)|numerals in the spoken language]]. These are shared with other languages of the [[Chinese cultural sphere]] such as Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese. Most people and institutions in China and Taiwan primarily use the Arabic or mixed Arabic-Chinese systems for convenience, with traditional Chinese numerals used in finance, mainly for writing amounts on checks, banknotes, some ceremonial occasions, some boxes, and on commercials.\n{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nThe other indigenous system is the [[Suzhou numerals]], or ''huama'', a positional system, the only surviving form of the [[rod numerals]]. These were once used by Chinese mathematicians, and later in Chinese markets, such as those in [[Hong Kong]] before the 1990s, but have been gradually supplanted by Arabic (and also [[Roman numerals|Roman]]) numerals.\n\n==Characters used to represent numbers==\n[[File:Muyu-G209-1620km-5469-crop.jpg|thumb|Chinese and Arabic numerals may coexist, as on this kilometer marker: {{convert|1620|km|abbr=on}} on [[China National Highway 209|Hwy G209]] (G\u4e8c\u3007\u4e5d)]]\nThe Chinese character numeral system consists of the [[Chinese characters]] used by the [[Chinese written language]] to write spoken numerals. Similar to spelling-out numbers in English (e.g., \"one thousand nine hundred forty-five\"), it is not an independent system ''per se''. Since it reflects spoken language, it does not use the positional system as in [[Arabic numerals]], in the same way that spelling out numbers in English does not.\n\n=== Standard numbers ===\nThere are characters representing the numbers zero through nine, and other characters representing larger numbers such as tens, hundreds, thousands and so on. There are two sets of characters for Chinese numerals: one for everyday writing, known as ''xi\u01ceoxi\u011b'' ({{zh|t=\u5c0f\u5beb|s=\u5c0f\u5199|l=small writing, i.e. [[lower case]]}}), and one for use in commercial or financial contexts, known as ''d\u00e0xi\u011b'' ({{zh|t=\u5927\u5beb|s=\u5927\u5199|l=big writing, i.e. [[upper case]]}}). The latter arose because the characters used for writing numerals are geometrically simple, so simply using those numerals cannot prevent forgeries in the same way spelling numbers out in English would.<ref>[http://big5.hwjyw.com/zyzx/jxsc/hy/200912/t20091215_34515.shtml \u5927\u5beb\u6578\u5b57\u300e] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722183729/http://big5.hwjyw.com/zyzx/jxsc/hy/200912/t20091215_34515.shtml |date=2011-07-22 }}</ref> A forger could easily change the everyday characters <span class=\"nounderlines\">[[wikt:\u4e09\u5341|\u4e09\u5341]]</span> (30) to <span class=\"nounderlines\">[[wikt:\u4e94\u5343|\u4e94\u5343]]</span> (5000) just by adding a few strokes.

They are also referred to as \"banker's numerals\", \"anti-fraud numerals\", or \"banker's anti-fraud numerals\". For the same reason, rod numerals were never used in commercial records.\n\n'''T''' denotes [[Traditional Chinese characters]], while '''S''' denotes [[Simplified Chinese characters]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Financial\n! colspan=\"2\" | Normal\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Value\n! rowspan=\"2\" | P\u012bny\u012bn <br>([[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]])\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Jyutping <br>([[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]])\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b <br>([[Hokkien]])\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Notes\n|-\n!

Partly due to this, combinations of \u4e07 and \u4ebf are often used instead of the larger units of the traditional system as well, for example \u4ebf\u4ebf (y\u00ecy\u00ec) instead of \u4eac.

Whole numbers ===\nMultiple-digit numbers are constructed using a multiplicative principle; first the digit itself (from 1 to 9), then the place (such as 10 or 100); then the next digit.\n\nIn Mandarin, the multiplier {{Zh|c={{linktext|\u5169}}|s=|t=|p=|labels=no}} (''li\u01ceng'') is often used rather than {{Zh|c={{linktext|\u4e8c}}|s=|t=|p=|labels=no}} (''\u00e8r'') for all numbers 200 and greater with the \"2\" numeral (although as noted earlier this varies from dialect to dialect and person to person). Use of both \u5169 (''li\u01ceng'') or \u4e8c (''\u00e8r'') are acceptable for the number 200. When writing in the Cantonese dialect, \u4e8c (''yi<sup>6</sup>'') is used to represent the \"2\" numeral for all numbers.  In the [[Min Nan|southern Min]] dialect of Chaozhou ([[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]), \u5169 (''no<sup>6</sup>'') is used to represent the \"2\" numeral in all numbers from 200 onwards.

Hence it is more convenient to think of numbers here as in groups of four, thus 1,234,567,890 is regrouped here as 12,3456,7890.

If one of the numbers is between 10 and 19, the leading \"one\" is omitted as per the above point.

For example, \"three people\" is expressed as {{Zh|c=|s=\u4e09{{linktext|\u4e2a|\u4eba}}|t=\u4e09{{linktext|\u500b|\u4eba}}|labels=no|p=s\u0101n ge r\u00e9n}} , \"three ({{Zh|c=|s=|t=|p=ge|labels=no}} particle) person\", where {{Zh|c=|s=\u4e2a|labels=no}}/{{Zh|c=|labels=no|t=\u500b|p=}} ''{{Zh|c=|s=|t=|p=ge|labels=no}}'' is a [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]]. There exist many [[List of Chinese classifiers|different classifiers]], for use with different sets of nouns, although {{Zh|c=|s=\u4e2a|labels=no}}/{{Zh|c=|labels=no|t=\u500b|p=}} is the most common, and may be used informally in place of other classifiers.\n\nChinese uses [[cardinal number]]s in certain situations in which English would use [[Ordinal number|ordinals]]. For example, {{Zh|c=\u4e09\u697c/\u4e09\u6a13|s=|t=|p=s\u0101n l\u00f3u|labels=no}} (literally \"three [[Storey|story/storey]]\") means \"third floor\" (\"second floor\" in British {{Section link|Storey|Numbering|nopage=y}}). Likewise, {{Zh|p=\u00e8rsh\u00ed y\u012b sh\u00ecj\u00ec|labels=no|c=\u4e8c\u5341\u4e00\u4e16\u7eaa/\u4e8c\u5341\u4e00\u4e16\u7d00}} (literally \"twenty-one century\") is used for \"21st century\".<ref>Yip, Po-Ching; Rimmington, Don, ''Chinese: A Comprehensive Grammar'', Routledge, 2004, p. 12.</ref>\n\nNumbers of years are commonly spoken as a sequence of digits, as in {{Zh|p=\u00e8r l\u00edng l\u00edng y\u012b|labels=no|c=\u4e8c\u96f6\u96f6\u4e00|s=|t=}} (\"two zero zero one\") for the year 2001.<ref>Yip, Po-Ching; Rimmington, Don, ''Chinese: A Comprehensive Grammar'', Routledge, 2004, p. 13.</ref> Names of months and days (in the Western system) are also expressed using numbers: {{Zh|p=y\u012byu\u00e8|labels=no|c=\u4e00{{linktext|\u6708}}|s=|t=}} (\"one month\") for January, etc.; and {{Zh|p=x\u012bngq\u012by\u012b|labels=no|c={{linktext|\u661f\u671f}}\u4e00|s=|t=}} (\"week one\") for Monday, etc. Only one exception, Sunday is {{Zh|p=x\u012bngq\u012br\u00ec|labels=no|c={{linktext|\u661f\u671f\u65e5}}|s=|t=}}, or informally {{Zh|p=x\u012bngq\u012bti\u0101n|labels=no|c={{linktext|\u661f\u671f\u5929}}|s=|t=}}, both literally \"week day\". When meaning \"week\", \"{{Zh|labels=no|c=\u661f\u671f|s=|t=}}\" {{Zh|labels=no|s=|t=|p=x\u012bngq\u012b}} and \"{{Zh|labels=no|c=|s=\u793c\u62dc|t=\u79ae\u62dc|p=|first=t}}\" {{Zh|labels=no|s=|t=|p=l\u01d0b\u00e0i|c=}} are interchangeable. \"{{Zh|labels=no|c=\u79ae\u62dc\u5929|p=|s=|t=}}\" {{Zh|labels=no|s=|t=|p=l\u01d0b\u00e0iti\u0101n|c=}} or \"{{Zh|labels=no|c=\u79ae\u62dc\u65e5|p=|s=|t=}}\" {{Zh|labels=no|s=|t=|p=l\u01d0b\u00e0ir\u00ec|c=}} means \"day of worship\". [[Chinese Catholics]] call Sunday \"{{Zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|\u4e3b\u65e5}}|s=|t=}}\" ''{{Zh|labels=no|s=|t=|p=zh\u01d4r\u00ec|c=}}'', \"Lord's day\".<ref>Days of the Week in Chinese: Three Different Words for 'Week' http://www.cjvlang.com/Dow/dowchin.html</ref>\n\nFull dates are usually written in the format 2001\u5e741\u670820\u65e5 for January 20, 2001 (using {{Zh|p=ni\u00e1n|labels=no|c={{linktext|\u5e74}}|s=|t=}} \"year\", {{Zh|p=yu\u00e8|labels=no|c={{linktext|\u6708}}|s=|t=}} \"month\", and {{Zh|p=r\u00ec|labels=no|c={{linktext|\u65e5}}|s=|t=}} \"day\") \u2013 all the numbers are read as cardinals, not ordinals, with no leading zeroes, and the year is read as a sequence of digits. For brevity the {{Zh|labels=no|s=|t=|p=ni\u00e1n|c=}}, {{Zh|labels=no|s=|t=|p=yu\u00e8|c=}} and {{Zh|labels=no|s=|t=|p=r\u00ec|c=}} may be dropped to give a date composed of just numbers.  For example \"6-4\" in Chinese is \"six-four\", short for \"month six, day four\" i.e. June Fourth, a common Chinese shorthand for the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests]] (because of the violence that occurred on June 4). For another example 67, in Chinese is sixty seven, short for year nineteen sixty seven, a common Chinese shorthand for the [[Hong Kong 1967 leftist riots]].\n\n== Counting rod and Suzhou numerals ==\n[[File:Chounumerals.svg|thumb|right|150px|Counting rod numerals]]\n{{Main|Suzhou numerals}}\n\nIn the same way that [[Roman numerals]] were standard in ancient and medieval Europe for mathematics and commerce, the Chinese formerly used the [[counting rods|rod numerals]], which is a positional system. The Suzhou numerals ({{zh|t=\u8607\u5dde\u82b1\u78bc |s=\u82cf\u5dde\u82b1\u7801 |p=S\u016bzh\u014du hu\u0101m\u01ce}}) system is a variation of the [[Song dynasty|Southern Song]] rod numerals. Nowadays, the ''hu\u0101m\u01ce'' system is only used for displaying prices in Chinese markets or on traditional handwritten invoices.\n\n==Hand gestures==\n{{Main|Chinese number gestures}}\n\nThere is a common method of using of one hand to signify the numbers one to ten. While the five digits on one hand can express the numbers one to five, six to ten have special signs that can be used in commerce or day-to-day communication.\n\n==Historical use of numerals in China==\n[[File:Shang numerals.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Shang oracle bone numerals of 14th century B.C.<ref>The Shorter Science & Civilisation in China Vol 2, An abridgement by Colin Ronan of Joseph Needham's original text, Table 20, p. 6, Cambridge University Press {{isbn|0-521-23582-0}}</ref>]] \n[[File:\u897f\u5468\u91d1\u6587.jpg|thumb|right|250px|West Zhou dynasty bronze script]]\n[[File:Rod numeral positioning.JPG|thumb|right|300px|rod numeral place value from Yongle Encyclopedia]]\n[[File:Counting board.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Japanese counting board with grids]]\n\nMost Chinese numerals of later periods were descendants of the [[Shang dynasty]] oracle numerals of the 14th century BC. The [[oracle bone script]] numerals were found on tortoise shell and animal bones. In early civilizations, the Shang were able to express any numbers, however large, with only nine symbols and a counting board.<ref>The Shorter Science & Civilisation in China Vol 2, An abridgement by Colin Ronan of Joseph Needham's original text, p5, Cambridge University Press  {{ISBN|0-521-23582-0}}</ref>\n\nSome of the bronze script numerals such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, and 13 became part of the system of [[rod numerals]].\n\nIn this system, horizontal rod numbers are used for the tens, thousands, hundred thousands etc.  It's written in ''[[Sunzi Suanjing]]'' that \"one is vertical, ten is horizontal\".<ref>[http://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/%E5%AD%AB%E5%AD%90%E7%AE%97%E7%B6%93 Chinese Wikisource] \u5b6b\u5b50\u7b97\u7d93: \u5148\u8b58\u5176\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e00\u5f9e\u5341\u6a6b\uff0c\u767e\u7acb\u5343\u50f5\uff0c\u5343\u5341\u76f8\u671b\uff0c\u842c\u767e\u76f8\u7576\u3002</ref>\n\n{| border=\"0\" width=\"500\" align=\"center\" style=\"border: 5px solid #999; background-color:white\"\n|-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#EFEFEF\"\n! \u4e03\n! \u4e00\n! \u516b\n! \u4e8c\n! \u56db\n|-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#EFEFEF\"\n| [[File:Counting rod v7.png|20px]]\n| [[File:Counting rod h1.png|20px]]\n| [[File:Counting rod v8.png|20px]]\n| [[File:Counting rod h2.png|20px]]\n| [[File:Counting rod v4.png|20px]]\n|-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#EFEFEF\"\n| 7 \n| 1\n| 8\n| 2\n| 4\n|}\n\nThe counting rod numerals system has place value and decimal numerals for computation, and was used widely by Chinese merchants, mathematicians and astronomers from the [[Han dynasty]] to the 16th century.\n\nIn 690 AD, [[Wu Zetian|Empress W\u01d4]] promulgated [[Chinese characters of Empress Wu|Zetian characters]], one of which was \"\u3007\". The word is now used as a synonym for the number zero.<ref>'''''Note:''''' The code for the lowercase \u3007 (IDEOGRAPHIC NUMBER ZERO) is U+3007, not to be confused with the [[O mark]] (CIRCLE).</ref>\n\n[[Alexander Wylie (missionary)|Alexander Wylie]], Christian missionary to China, in 1853 already refuted the notion that \"the Chinese numbers were written in words at length\", and stated that in ancient China, calculation was carried out by means of counting rods, and \"the written character is evidently a rude presentation of these\". After being introduced to the rod numerals, he said \"Having thus obtained a simple but effective system of figures, we find the Chinese in actual use of a method of notation depending on the theory of local value [i.e. place-value], several centuries before such theory was understood in Europe, and while yet the science of numbers had scarcely dawned among the Arabs.\"<ref>Alexander Wylie, ''Jottings on the Sciences of the Chinese, North Chinese Herald, 1853, Shanghai''</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties (after Arabic numerals were introduced into China), some Chinese mathematicians used Chinese numeral characters as positional system digits. After the Qing period, both the Chinese numeral characters and the Suzhou numerals were replaced by Arabic numerals in mathematical writings.\n\n== Cultural influences ==\n\nTraditional Chinese numeric characters are also used in [[Japan]] and [[Korea]] and were used in [[Vietnam]] before the 20th century. In vertical text (that is, read top to bottom), using characters for numbers is the norm, while in horizontal text, Arabic numerals are most common. Chinese numeric characters are also used in much the same formal or decorative fashion that Roman numerals are in Western cultures. Chinese numerals may appear together with Arabic numbers on the same sign or document.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Chinese numerals}}\n* [[Chinese number gestures]]\n* [[Numbers in Chinese culture]]\n* [[Chinese units of measurement]]\n* [[Chinese classifier]]\n* [[Chinese grammar]]\n* [[Japanese numerals]]\n* [[Korean numerals]]\n* [[Vietnamese numerals]]\n* [[Celestial stem]]\n* [[List of numbers in various languages#Sinitic languages|List of numbers in Sinitic languages]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{Chinese language}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chinese Numerals}}\n[[Category:Numerals]]\n[[Category:Chinese language]]\n[[Category:Chinese mathematics]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=July 2009}}\n{{Numeral systems}}\n\n'''Chinese numerals''' are words and characters used to denote [[number]]s in [[Chinese language|Chinese]].\n\nToday, speakers of Chinese use three written [[numeral system]]s: the system of [[Arabic numerals]] used worldwide, and two indigenous systems. The more familiar indigenous system is based on [[Chinese character]]s that correspond to [[Numeral (linguistics)|numerals in the spoken language]]. These are shared with other languages of the [[Chinese cultural sphere]] such as Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese. Most people and institutions in China and Taiwan primarily use the Arabic or mixed Arabic-Chinese systems for convenience, with traditional Chinese numerals used in finance, mainly for writing amounts on checks, banknotes, some ceremonial occasions, some boxes, and on commercials.\n{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nThe other indigenous system is the [[Suzhou numerals]], or ''huama'', a positional system, the only surviving form of the [[rod numerals]]. These were once used by Chinese mathematicians, and later in Chinese markets, such as those in [[Hong Kong]] before the 1990s, but have been gradually supplanted by Arabic (and also [[Roman numerals|Roman]]) numerals.\n\n==Characters used to represent numbers==\n[[File:Muyu-G209-1620km-5469-crop.jpg|thumb|Chinese and Arabic numerals may coexist, as on this kilometer marker: {{convert|1620|km|abbr=on}} on [[China National Highway 209|Hwy G209]] (G\u4e8c\u3007\u4e5d)]]\nThe Chinese character numeral system consists of the [[Chinese characters]] used by the [[Chinese written language]] to write spoken numerals. Similar to spelling-out numbers in English (e.g., \"one thousand nine hundred forty-five\"), it is not an independent system ''per se''. Since it reflects spoken language, it does not use the positional system as in [[Arabic numerals]], in the same way that spelling out numbers in English does not.\n\n=== Standard numbers ===\nThere are characters representing the numbers zero through nine, and other characters representing larger numbers such as tens, hundreds, thousands and so on. There are two sets of characters for Chinese numerals: one for everyday writing, known as ''xi\u01ceoxi\u011b'' ({{zh|t=\u5c0f\u5beb|s=\u5c0f\u5199|l=small writing, i.e. [[lower case]]}}), and one for use in commercial or financial contexts, known as ''d\u00e0xi\u011b'' ({{zh|t=\u5927\u5beb|s=\u5927\u5199|l=big writing, i.e. [[upper case]]}}). The latter arose because the characters used for writing numerals are geometrically simple, so simply using those numerals cannot prevent forgeries in the same way spelling numbers out in English would.<ref>[http://big5.hwjyw.com/zyzx/jxsc/hy/200912/t20091215_34515.shtml \u5927\u5beb\u6578\u5b57\u300e] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722183729/http://big5.hwjyw.com/zyzx/jxsc/hy/200912/t20091215_34515.shtml |date=2011-07-22 }}</ref> A forger could easily change the everyday characters <span class=\"nounderlines\">[[wikt:\u4e09\u5341|\u4e09\u5341]]</span> (30) to <span class=\"nounderlines\">[[wikt:\u4e94\u5343|\u4e94\u5343]]</span> (5000) just by adding a few strokes.

Partly due to this, combinations of \u4e07 and \u4ebf are often used instead of the larger units of the traditional system as well, for example \u4ebf\u4ebf (y\u00ecy\u00ec) instead of \u4eac.

Whole numbers ===\nMultiple-digit numbers are constructed using a multiplicative principle; first the digit itself (from 1 to 9), then the place (such as 10 or 100); then the next digit.\n\nIn Mandarin, the multiplier {{Zh|c={{linktext|\u5169}}|s=|t=|p=|labels=no}} (''li\u01ceng'') is often used rather than {{Zh|c={{linktext|\u4e8c}}|s=|t=|p=|labels=no}} (''\u00e8r'') for all numbers 200 and greater with the \"2\" numeral (although as noted earlier this varies from dialect to dialect and person to person). Use of both \u5169 (''li\u01ceng'') or \u4e8c (''\u00e8r'') are acceptable for the number 200. When writing in the Cantonese dialect, \u4e8c (''yi<sup>6</sup>'') is used to represent the \"2\" numeral for all numbers.  In the [[Min Nan|southern Min]] dialect of Chaozhou ([[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]), \u5169 (''no<sup>6</sup>'') is used to represent the \"2\" numeral in all numbers from 200 onwards.

Hence it is more convenient to think of numbers here as in groups of four, thus 1,234,567,890 is regrouped here as 12,3456,7890.

If one of the numbers is between 10 and 19, the leading \"one\" is omitted as per the above point.

For example, \"three people\" is expressed as {{Zh|c=|s=\u4e09{{linktext|\u4e2a|\u4eba}}|t=\u4e09{{linktext|\u500b|\u4eba}}|labels=no|p=s\u0101n ge r\u00e9n}} , \"three ({{Zh|c=|s=|t=|p=ge|labels=no}} particle) person\", where {{Zh|c=|s=\u4e2a|labels=no}}/{{Zh|c=|labels=no|t=\u500b|p=}} ''{{Zh|c=|s=|t=|p=ge|labels=no}}'' is a [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]]. There exist many [[List of Chinese classifiers|different classifiers]], for use with different sets of nouns, although {{Zh|c=|s=\u4e2a|labels=no}}/{{Zh|c=|labels=no|t=\u500b|p=}} is the most common, and may be used informally in place of other classifiers.\n\nChinese uses [[cardinal number]]s in certain situations in which English would use [[Ordinal number|ordinals]]. For example, {{Zh|c=\u4e09\u697c/\u4e09\u6a13|s=|t=|p=s\u0101n l\u00f3u|labels=no}} (literally \"three [[Storey|story/storey]]\") means \"third floor\" (\"second floor\" in British {{Section link|Storey|Numbering|nopage=y}}).

For example \"6-4\" in Chinese is \"six-four\", short for \"month six, day four\" i.e. June Fourth, a common Chinese shorthand for the [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests]] (because of the violence that occurred on June 4). For another example 67, in Chinese is sixty seven, short for year nineteen sixty seven, a common Chinese shorthand for the [[Hong Kong 1967 leftist riots]].\n\n== Counting rod and Suzhou numerals ==\n[[File:Chounumerals.svg|thumb|right|150px|Counting rod numerals]]\n{{Main|Suzhou numerals}}\n\nIn the same way that [[Roman numerals]] were standard in ancient and medieval Europe for mathematics and commerce, the Chinese formerly used the [[counting rods|rod numerals]], which is a positional system. The Suzhou numerals ({{zh|t=\u8607\u5dde\u82b1\u78bc |s=\u82cf\u5dde\u82b1\u7801 |p=S\u016bzh\u014du hu\u0101m\u01ce}}) system is a variation of the [[Song dynasty|Southern Song]] rod numerals. Nowadays, the ''hu\u0101m\u01ce'' system is only used for displaying prices in Chinese markets or on traditional handwritten invoices.\n\n==Hand gestures==\n{{Main|Chinese number gestures}}\n\nThere is a common method of using of one hand to signify the numbers one to ten. While the five digits on one hand can express the numbers one to five, six to ten have special signs that can be used in commerce or day-to-day communication.\n\n==Historical use of numerals in China==\n[[File:Shang numerals.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Shang oracle bone numerals of 14th century B.C.<ref>The Shorter Science & Civilisation in China Vol 2, An abridgement by Colin Ronan of Joseph Needham's original text, Table 20, p. 6, Cambridge University Press {{isbn|0-521-23582-0}}</ref>]] \n[[File:\u897f\u5468\u91d1\u6587.jpg|thumb|right|250px|West Zhou dynasty bronze script]]\n[[File:Rod numeral positioning.JPG|thumb|right|300px|rod numeral place value from Yongle Encyclopedia]]\n[[File:Counting board.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Japanese counting board with grids]]\n\nMost Chinese numerals of later periods were descendants of the [[Shang dynasty]] oracle numerals of the 14th century BC.

After being introduced to the rod numerals, he said \"Having thus obtained a simple but effective system of figures, we find the Chinese in actual use of a method of notation depending on the theory of local value [i.e. place-value], several centuries before such theory was understood in Europe, and while yet the science of numbers had scarcely dawned among the Arabs.\"<ref>Alexander Wylie, ''Jottings on the Sciences of the Chinese, North Chinese Herald, 1853, Shanghai''</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties (after Arabic numerals were introduced into China), some Chinese mathematicians used Chinese numeral characters as positional system digits. After the Qing period, both the Chinese numeral characters and the Suzhou numerals were replaced by Arabic numerals in mathematical writings.\n\n== Cultural influences ==\n\nTraditional Chinese numeric characters are also used in [[Japan]] and [[Korea]] and were used in [[Vietnam]] before the 20th century. In vertical text (that is, read top to bottom), using characters for numbers is the norm, while in horizontal text, Arabic numerals are most common. Chinese numeric characters are also used in much the same formal or decorative fashion that Roman numerals are in Western cultures.

{"title_page": "Pojama", "text_new": "[[File:Pojama class frigate.JPG|thumb|Line drawing of the ''Brynhilda'', one of the three pojamas built for the Swedish navy]]\n\nA '''pojama''' or '''pojema''' (also '''pojanmaa''') was a type of warship built for the Swedish [[archipelago fleet]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It was developed for warfare in the [[Archipelago Sea]] and along the coasts of [[Svealand]] and [[Finland]] against the [[Russian navy]]. The pojama was designed by the prolific naval architect [[Fredrik Henrik af Chapman]] for use in an area of mostly shallow waters and groups of islands and islets that extend from Stockholm all the way to the Gulf of Finland.\n\nThe pojama was intended to complement and partially to replace the existing [[galley]]s of the Swedish inshore squadrons, but were designed as hybrid sailing vessels that could also be rowed.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Swedish galley (1715)-SMM-Fo132035DIA.jpg|alt=A side view of a model of a small galley with two masts rigged with [[lateen]] (triangular) sails.

The bow has a raised platform (rambade) armed with 3 small cannons.|thumb|Contemporary model of an early 18th-century Swedish galley from the collections of the Maritime Museum in Stockholm. Small galleys like this one were a mainstay of the first Swedish coastal fleets.]]\nIn the early 18th century, the establishment of [[Russian Empire|Russian]] naval power in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] challenged the interests of Sweden, at the time one of the major powers in the Baltic. The [[Swedish empire]] at the time included territory in Northern Germany, all of modern Finland and most of the [[Baltic states]], a dominion held together by the Baltic sea routes. Russian Tsar [[Peter the Great]] had established a new capital and naval base in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1703. During the [[Great Northern War]] Sweden lost its Baltic state territories, and experienced destructive Russian raiding in Finland and along the chain of islands and [[archipelago]]s that stretched all the way from the [[Gulf of Finland]] to the capital of [[Stockholm]]. The traumatic experience led to the establishment of inshore flotillas of shallow-draft vessels. The first of these consisted mainly of smaller versions of the traditional Mediterranean warship, the [[galley]]s. Most of these more akin to [[galiot]]s and were complemented with gun [[Pram (ship)|pram]]. The disastrous war against [[Russo-Swedish War (1741\u20131743)|Russia 1741-43]] and the minor involvement in [[Prussia]] in the [[Seven Years' War]] 1757-62 showed the need for further expansion and development of the inshore flotillas with more specialized vessels.<ref>Berg (2000), pp. 50-59</ref>\n\nTraditional galleys were effective as troop transports for amphibious operations, but were severely under-gunned, especially in relation to their large crews; a galley with a 250-man crew, most of whom were rowers, would typically be armed with only one 24-pounder [[cannon]] and two 6-pounders, all in the bow. However, they were undecked and lacked adequate shelter for the rower-soldiers, great numbers of which succumbed to illness in the war of 1741-43.<ref>Glete (1992), pp. 115-116, 118</ref> The Swedish military invested considerable resources into the establishment of the \"[[archipelago fleet]]\" (''sk\u00e4rg\u00e5rdsflottan''), a separate branch of the armed forced that organizationally belonged to the army. In 1756, it was even officially designated ''Arm\u00e9ns flotta'', \"Navy of the Army\", though it was in many ways a highly independent organization that attracted a social and cultural elite and enjoyed the protection of [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] after his 1772 coup that empowered him as an [[absolute monarch]].<ref>Glete (1992), p. 118</ref>\n\nSeveral new ships were designed by the naval architect [[Fredrik Henrik af Chapman]] to bolster the hitting-power of the new Swedish arm, to provide it with better naval defense and greater [[fire support]] capabilities during amphibious operations. The result was four new vessels that combined the maneuverability of oar-powered galleys with the superior rigs and decent living conditions of sailing ships: the [[udema]], pojama, [[turuma]] and [[hemmema]], named after the Finnish regions of Uudeenmaa ([[Uusimaa]]), [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|Pohjanmaa]], [[\u00c5boland|Turunmaa]] and H\u00e4meenmaa ([[Tavastia (historical province)|Tavastia]]).<ref>Anderson (1962), pp. 93-94</ref> All four have been referred to as ''sk\u00e4rg\u00e5rdsfregatter'', \"archipelago frigates\", in Swedish and English historical literature, though the smaller udema and pojama are also described as \"archipelago corvettes\" originally.<ref>Berg (1993), p. 35 and (2000) refer to ''sk\u00e4rg\u00e5rdsfregatter'' only for the larger [[turuma]] and hemmemas while Glete (1992) and Anderson (1962) do not.</ref> The name \"pojama\" has been carried on (in its more modern variant) as a traditional vessel name in the Finnish navy, with [[Finnish minelayer Pohjanmaa|the previous flagship]] and [[Pohjanmaa-class corvette|the future class of corvettes in development as of 2019]] named after the type.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Pojama Brynhilda1.jpg|thumb|right|Contemporary model of ''Brynhilda'' (built in 1776) at the [[Maritime Museum (Stockholm)|Maritime Museum]] in Stockholm. The model is flying the blue three-tongued flag of the [[archipelago fleet]] from the stern.]]\n[[File:Pojama Brynhilda-stern.JPG|thumb|right|Closeup view of the stern of the ''Brynhilda'' model]]\nThe first pojama was built in 1764 (the same year as the larger version [[turuma]]s and the earliest [[hemmema]]). It was a low-hulled vessel with two masts, a main and a mizzen, rigged like a [[bomb ketch]] with two square sails, a [[lug sail]], and three staysails supported between the mainmast and the [[bowsprit]]. The first pojama was 23.8 m (78 ft) long, 5.5 m (18 ft) wide, with a draft of 1.8 m (6 ft). The three later pojamas built for the Swedish navy varied in size from 20 m (65.5 ft) up to 27.6 m (90.5 ft). Its main armament was two heavy guns in the bow and stern (ranging from 12-pounders up to 24-pounders). These could also be dragged towards the center of the vessel and aimed sideways, though with considerable effort. It also had up to 10 [[swivel gun]]s along the railings for close-range defense. For maneuverability, it carried 14 pairs of oars which operated through oarpoarts attached to a rectangular [[outrigger]] which improved the leverage for the oarsmen.<ref>Anderson (1962), p. 95; Berg (1993), p. 34-35</ref>\n\n==Service==\nOnly four pojamas were built for the Swedish navy and their use was often limited to reconnaissance and dispatch duties.<ref>Berg (2000), p. 61</ref> The pojamas saw limited action in the archipelago navy's operations in the [[Russo-Swedish War (1788-1790)|war of 1788-90]]. A single pojama participated in the first battle of Svensksund in 1789, a minor Russian victory, but none in the second battle, Sweden's greatest naval victory ever.<ref>Glete (1992), pp. 152-53, 163-64</ref>\n\nLike the other specialized archipelago vessels, the pojama proved to have only limited advantages.

It was developed for warfare in the [[Archipelago Sea]] and along the coasts of [[Svealand]] and [[Finland]] against the [[Russian navy]]. The pojama was designed by the prolific naval architect [[Fredrik Henrik af Chapman]] for use in an area of mostly shallow waters and groups of islands and islets that extend from Stockholm all the way to the Gulf of Finland.\n\nThe pojama was intended to complement and partially to replace the existing [[galley]]s of the Swedish inshore squadrons, but were designed as hybrid sailing vessels that could also be rowed.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Swedish galley (1715)-SMM-Fo132035DIA.jpg|alt=A side view of a model of a small galley with two masts rigged with [[lateen]] (triangular) sails.

The bow has a raised platform (rambade) armed with 3 small cannons.|thumb|Contemporary model of an early 18th-century Swedish galley from the collections of the Maritime Museum in Stockholm. Small galleys like this one were a mainstay of the first Swedish coastal fleets.]]\nIn the early 18th century, the establishment of [[Russian Empire|Russian]] naval power in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] challenged the interests of Sweden, at the time one of the major powers in the Baltic. The [[Swedish empire]] at the time included territory in Northern Germany, all of modern Finland and most of the [[Baltic states]], a dominion held together by the Baltic sea routes. Russian Tsar [[Peter the Great]] had established a new capital and naval base in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1703. During the [[Great Northern War]] Sweden lost its Baltic state territories, and experienced destructive Russian raiding in Finland and along the chain of islands and [[archipelago]]s that stretched all the way from the [[Gulf of Finland]] to the capital of [[Stockholm]]. The traumatic experience led to the establishment of inshore flotillas of shallow-draft vessels. The first of these consisted mainly of smaller versions of the traditional Mediterranean warship, the [[galley]]s. Most of these more akin to [[galiot]]s and were complemented with gun [[Pram (ship)|pram]]. The disastrous war against [[Russo-Swedish War (1741\u20131743)|Russia 1741-43]] and the minor involvement in [[Prussia]] in the [[Seven Years' War]] 1757-62 showed the need for further expansion and development of the inshore flotillas with more specialized vessels.<ref>Berg (2000), pp. 50-59</ref>\n\nTraditional galleys were effective as troop transports for amphibious operations, but were severely under-gunned, especially in relation to their large crews; a galley with a 250-man crew, most of whom were rowers, would typically be armed with only one 24-pounder [[cannon]] and two 6-pounders, all in the bow. However, they were undecked and lacked adequate shelter for the rower-soldiers, great numbers of which succumbed to illness in the war of 1741-43.<ref>Glete (1992), pp. 115-116, 118</ref> The Swedish military invested considerable resources into the establishment of the \"[[archipelago fleet]]\" (''sk\u00e4rg\u00e5rdsflottan''), a separate branch of the armed forced that organizationally belonged to the army. In 1756, it was even officially designated ''Arm\u00e9ns flotta'', \"Navy of the Army\", though it was in many ways a highly independent organization that attracted a social and cultural elite and enjoyed the protection of [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] after his 1772 coup that empowered him as an [[absolute monarch]].<ref>Glete (1992), p. 118</ref>\n\nSeveral new ships were designed by the naval architect [[Fredrik Henrik af Chapman]] to bolster the hitting-power of the new Swedish arm, to provide it with better naval defense and greater [[fire support]] capabilities during amphibious operations. The result was four new vessels that combined the maneuverability of oar-powered galleys with the superior rigs and decent living conditions of sailing ships: the [[udema]], pojama, [[turuma]] and [[hemmema]], named after the Finnish regions of Uudeenmaa ([[Uusimaa]]), [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|Pohjanmaa]], [[\u00c5boland|Turunmaa]] and H\u00e4meenmaa ([[Tavastia (historical province)|Tavastia]]).<ref>Anderson (1962), pp. 93-94</ref> All four have been referred to as ''sk\u00e4rg\u00e5rdsfregatter'', \"archipelago frigates\", in Swedish and English historical literature, though the smaller udema and pojama are also described as \"archipelago corvettes\" originally.<ref>Berg (1993), p. 35 and (2000) refer to ''sk\u00e4rg\u00e5rdsfregatter'' only for the larger [[turuma]] and hemmemas while Glete (1992) and Anderson (1962) do not.</ref> The name \"pojama\" has been carried on (in its more modern variant) as a traditional vessel name in the Finnish navy, with [[Finnish minelayer Pohjanmaa|the previous flagship]] and [[Pohjanmaa-class corvette|the future class of corvettes in development as of 2019]] named after the type.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Pojama Brynhilda1.jpg|thumb|right|Contemporary model of ''Brynhilda'' (built in 1776) at the [[Maritime Museum (Stockholm)|Maritime Museum]] in Stockholm. The model is flying the blue three-tongued flag of the [[archipelago fleet]] from the stern.]]\n[[File:Pojama Brynhilda-stern.JPG|thumb|right|Closeup view of the stern of the ''Brynhilda'' model]]\nThe first pojama was built in 1764 (the same year as the larger version [[turuma]]s and the earliest [[hemmema]]). It was a low-hulled vessel with two masts, a main and a mizzen, rigged like a [[bomb ketch]] with two square sails, a [[lug sail]], and three staysails supported between the mainmast and the [[bowsprit]]. The first pojama was 23.8 m (78 ft) long, 5.5 m (18 ft) wide, with a draft of 1.8 m (6 ft). The three later pojamas built for the Swedish navy varied in size from 20 m (65.5 ft) up to 27.6 m (90.5 ft). Its main armament was two heavy guns in the bow and stern (ranging from 12-pounders up to 24-pounders). These could also be dragged towards the center of the vessel and aimed sideways, though with considerable effort. It also had up to 10 [[swivel gun]]s along the railings for close-range defense. For maneuverability, it carried 14 pairs of oars which operated through oarpoarts attached to a rectangular [[outrigger]] which improved the leverage for the oarsmen.<ref>Anderson (1962), p. 95; Berg (1993), p. 34-35</ref>\n\n==Service==\nOnly four pojamas were built for the Swedish navy and their use was often limited to reconnaissance and dispatch duties.<ref>Berg (2000), p. 61</ref> The pojamas saw limited action in the archipelago navy's operations in the [[Russo-Swedish War (1788-1790)|war of 1788-90]]. A single pojama participated in the first battle of Svensksund in 1789, a minor Russian victory, but none in the second battle, Sweden's greatest naval victory ever.<ref>Glete (1992), pp. 152-53, 163-64</ref>\n\nLike the other specialized archipelago vessels, the pojama proved to have only limited advantages. While its firepower that was equal or superior even to larger galleys, they were slow even under oars. The second battle of Svensksund showed that the smaller gunboats and gunsloops were far more efficient for inshore operations and eventually replaced the \"archipelago frigates\" by the [[Finnish War]] of 1808-9, where Sweden eventually lost all of its Finnish possessions.<ref>Berg (1993), p. 35-36</ref>\n\n==Ships==\nFour pojamas were built, all of them for the Swedish archipelago fleet.

It was a personal victory for [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]], and it resulted in the Royalists holding [[Newark-on-Trent]] until very near the end of the war.\n\n==Background==\nAt the start of 1644, [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] hoped to form an army in the northwest of England, built around regiments which he had been able to bring back from Ireland as a result of the signing of a treaty, or \"cessation\", with the [[Confederate Ireland|Catholic Confederates]]. [[John Byron, 1st Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] commanded this army, but at the [[Battle of Nantwich]] on 26 January, Byron was defeated, with heavy casualties to the first regiments of foot landed from Ireland. In the aftermath of this setback, Charles ordered his nephew, Prince Rupert, to take command and restore Royalist fortunes in the north west. Rupert set up his headquarters in [[Shrewsbury]] on 21 February.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] forces in the Midland counties advanced to besiege the Royalist stronghold of Newark-on-Trent. Newark was a vital garrison, as it dominated the [[River Trent]], and also posed a threat to the Parliamentarians in the eastern counties of England. The town's defences were naturally very strong. The Trent divided above the town and merged below it, surrounding the town with water. The garrison under governor Richard Byron, brother of Lord Byron, fortified the town itself with earthworks and batteries.\n\nThe Parliamentarian force was led by an experienced Scottish professional soldier, Sir [[John Meldrum]]. On 6 March, Meldrum's forces forced a crossing of the eastern branch of the river, but were thrown back when they tried to attack the town itself on 8 March. They then began constructing formal siege works and entrenchments.\n\nOn 12 March, Charles ordered Rupert to relieve Newark. Hastily returning to Shrewsbury from [[Chester]], where he had been conferring with Lord Byron, Rupert collected a force based around his own regiment of horse, and musketeers detached mainly from two regiments from Ireland (Tillier's and Broughton's) which had recently landed in North Wales and which had therefore not been involved in the defeat at Nantwich. He marched towards Newark via the Royalist-held towns of [[Wolverhampton]], [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]] and [[Bingham, Nottinghamshire|Bingham]], augmenting his force with troops drawn from their garrisons.\n\n==Battle==\nAlthough Meldrum had been warned of Rupert's approach, Rupert had arrived too quickly for him to withdraw. Instead, Meldrum drew up his forces around the \"Spittal\", the ruins of St Leonard's Hospice which had been destroyed by fighting in the previous year, on the east side of the Trent. Fearing that Meldrum might still withdraw, Rupert's cavalry advanced by moonlight and attacked early in the morning of 21 March.\n\nRupert left a small troop under Colonel [[Charles Gerard, 1st Earl of Macclesfield|Charles Gerard]] in reserve, and led his own lifeguard of horse on the left wing in person,<ref name=Young&Holmes178>Young & Holmes, p.178</ref> while Colonel Sir Richard Crane led Rupert's regiment of horse on the right wing.<ref name=Warner90>Warner, p.90</ref> The Parliamentarian cavalry were led by Colonel Edward Rossiter on the left wing with troops raised from Nottinghamshire and Colonel Francis Thornhalgh on the left with troops from Lincolnshire.<ref name=Young&Holmes178/> A third body of Parliamentarian horse from Derby was absent covering the siege works, so the numbers of opposing cavalry were roughly equal.\n\nWhen Rupert attacked, the Parliamentarian right wing fled. Rupert himself was engaged in hand-to-hand fighting.<ref name=Young&Holmes178/> The Parliamentarian right wing drove the Royalist left back. Gerard was unhorsed and captured leading a counterattack. Eventually Rossiter was outflanked and forced to withdraw, in good order. The Parliamentarians withdrew across a [[bridge of boats]] onto the \"Island\", the area between the two branches of the Trent.\n\nWhen Rupert's infantry arrived, commanded by Colonel Henry Tillier, they attempted to capture the bridge of boats but were repulsed. Nevertheless, Meldrum's army was now trapped on the \"Island\". He had only a few days' rations, and there were quarrels among his officers, which culminated in a mutiny by a regiment from Norfolk.<ref name=Warner90/> Meldrum asked for terms of surrender. His army was allowed to withdraw to nearby Parliamentarian garrisons, leaving behind all their weapons and ammunition. The Royalists secured 3,000 muskets, 11 guns and two mortars.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Relief of Newark was perhaps Rupert's best personal triumph in the civil war. His rapid march and determined offensive had compelled a Parliamentarian force superior in numbers to his own scratch force to capitulate. He was unable to keep his army in being, as the detachments he had gathered on his march had to be returned to their garrisons. Nor did he have time to exploit his victory, as the Royalists were in difficulty elsewhere, both in the north and south of England.\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|indent=yes}}\n::{{Cite book |last=Warner |first=Philip |title=British Battlefields: The North |publisher=Fontana |year=1972 |isbn=0-00-633823-2}}\n::{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Peter |authorlink1=Peter Young (historian) |last2=Holmes |first2=Richard |authorlink2=Richard Holmes (military historian) |title=The English Civil War |location=Ware |publisher=Wordsworth Editions |year=2000 |isbn=1-84022-222-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/englishcivilwarm00youn }}\n\n==General References==\n::{{Cite book |last=Rodgers |first=Colonel H.

It was a personal victory for [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]], and it resulted in the Royalists holding [[Newark-on-Trent]] until very near the end of the war.\n\n==Background==\nAt the start of 1644, [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] hoped to form an army in the northwest of England, built around regiments which he had been able to bring back from Ireland as a result of the signing of a treaty, or \"cessation\", with the [[Confederate Ireland|Catholic Confederates]]. [[John Byron, 1st Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] commanded this army, but at the [[Battle of Nantwich]] on 26 January, Byron was defeated, with heavy casualties to the first regiments of foot landed from Ireland. In the aftermath of this setback, Charles ordered his nephew, Prince Rupert, to take command and restore Royalist fortunes in the north west. Rupert set up his headquarters in [[Shrewsbury]] on 21 February.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] forces in the Midland counties advanced to besiege the Royalist stronghold of Newark-on-Trent. Newark was a vital garrison, as it dominated the [[River Trent]], and also posed a threat to the Parliamentarians in the eastern counties of England. The town's defences were naturally very strong. The Trent divided above the town and merged below it, surrounding the town with water. The garrison under governor Richard Byron, brother of Lord Byron, fortified the town itself with earthworks and batteries.\n\nThe Parliamentarian force was led by an experienced Scottish professional soldier, Sir [[John Meldrum]]. On 6 March, Meldrum's forces forced a crossing of the eastern branch of the river, but were thrown back when they tried to attack the town itself on 8 March. They then began constructing formal siege works and entrenchments.\n\nOn 12 March, Charles ordered Rupert to relieve Newark. Hastily returning to Shrewsbury from [[Chester]], where he had been conferring with Lord Byron, Rupert collected a force based around his own regiment of horse, and musketeers detached mainly from two regiments from Ireland (Tillier's and Broughton's) which had recently landed in North Wales and which had therefore not been involved in the defeat at Nantwich. He marched towards Newark via the Royalist-held towns of [[Wolverhampton]], [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]] and [[Bingham, Nottinghamshire|Bingham]], augmenting his force with troops drawn from their garrisons.\n\n==Battle==\nAlthough Meldrum had been warned of Rupert's approach, Rupert had arrived too quickly for him to withdraw. Instead, Meldrum drew up his forces around the \"Spittal\", the ruins of St Leonard's Hospice which had been destroyed by fighting in the previous year, on the east side of the Trent. Fearing that Meldrum might still withdraw, Rupert's cavalry advanced by moonlight and attacked early in the morning of 21 March.\n\nRupert left a small troop under Colonel [[Charles Gerard, 1st Earl of Macclesfield|Charles Gerard]] in reserve, and led his own lifeguard of horse on the left wing in person,<ref name=Young&Holmes178>Young & Holmes, p.178</ref> while Colonel Sir Richard Crane led Rupert's regiment of horse on the right wing.<ref name=Warner90>Warner, p.90</ref> The Parliamentarian cavalry were led by Colonel Edward Rossiter on the left wing with troops raised from Nottinghamshire and Colonel Francis Thornhalgh on the left with troops from Lincolnshire.<ref name=Young&Holmes178/> A third body of Parliamentarian horse from Derby was absent covering the siege works, so the numbers of opposing cavalry were roughly equal.\n\nWhen Rupert attacked, the Parliamentarian right wing fled. Rupert himself was engaged in hand-to-hand fighting.<ref name=Young&Holmes178/> The Parliamentarian right wing drove the Royalist left back. Gerard was unhorsed and captured leading a counterattack. Eventually Rossiter was outflanked and forced to withdraw, in good order. The Parliamentarians withdrew across a [[bridge of boats]] onto the \"Island\", the area between the two branches of the Trent.\n\nWhen Rupert's infantry arrived, commanded by Colonel Henry Tillier, they attempted to capture the bridge of boats but were repulsed. Nevertheless, Meldrum's army was now trapped on the \"Island\". He had only a few days' rations, and there were quarrels among his officers, which culminated in a mutiny by a regiment from Norfolk.<ref name=Warner90/> Meldrum asked for terms of surrender. His army was allowed to withdraw to nearby Parliamentarian garrisons, leaving behind all their weapons and ammunition. The Royalists secured 3,000 muskets, 11 guns and two mortars.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Relief of Newark was perhaps Rupert's best personal triumph in the civil war. His rapid march and determined offensive had compelled a Parliamentarian force superior in numbers to his own scratch force to capitulate. He was unable to keep his army in being, as the detachments he had gathered on his march had to be returned to their garrisons. Nor did he have time to exploit his victory, as the Royalists were in difficulty elsewhere, both in the north and south of England.\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|indent=yes}}\n::{{Cite book |last=Warner |first=Philip |title=British Battlefields: The North |publisher=Fontana |year=1972 |isbn=0-00-633823-2}}\n::{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Peter |authorlink1=Peter Young (historian) |last2=Holmes |first2=Richard |authorlink2=Richard Holmes (military historian) |title=The English Civil War |location=Ware |publisher=Wordsworth Editions |year=2000 |isbn=1-84022-222-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/englishcivilwarm00youn }}\n\n==General References==\n::{{Cite book |last=Rodgers |first=Colonel H.
