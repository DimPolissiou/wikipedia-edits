To this date, his body has not been found.\n\n==CNN footage==\nKhadzhi-Murat Yandiyev was captured in a group of Chechen fighters sheltering in a hospital in the village of [[Alkhan-Kala]], during the [[military]] [[siege]] of the [[Chechnya|Chechen]] [[Capital (political)|capital]] [[Grozny]].\n\nWhat appears to be the execution order was caught on camera in the [[television]] [[footage]] recorded by journalists from [[CNN]] who were travelling with Russian forces along with representatives of several Russian television stations.\n\nYandiyev, dressed in a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-model [[military camouflage]] [[uniform]], can be seen in the footage standing injured while Russian soldiers are kicking him and other Chechens in their wounded legs. With television cameras rolling, a top Russian military official then aggressively interrogates Yandiyev before finally ordering his execution. Yandiyev and the Russian quickly get into an argument, and the officer eventually shouts: \"''Take him away, damn it, finish him off there, shit, - that's the whole order. Get him out of here, damn it. Come on, come on, come on, do it, take him away, finish him off, shoot him, damn it...''\" Yandiyev was then separated from the other prisoners and the soldiers led him away. He has not been seen since.\n\nThe officer in the footage, then General [[Alexander Baranov (general)|Alexander Baranov]], has not been charged with any misconduct, and served as the chief commander of the [[North Caucasus Military District]] from July 2004 to May 2008. He was also since promoted to the rank of [[Colonel General]] and awarded with a title of the [[Hero of the Russian Federation]].\n\n==Mother's quest==\nAccording to his mother Fatima Bazorkina, her son's disappearance stemmed from a tragic misunderstanding. She said Khadzhi left [[university]] as soon as the [[Second Chechen War]] broke out in 1999 to search for his father, who he believed was [[Siege|besieged]] in Grozny but had actually left Chechnya to join Bazorkina at a relative's house in [[Ingushetia]]. Bazorkina said she never saw her son after August 1999.\n\nFollowing Yandiyev's disappearance, Bazorkina scoured the [[republic]]'s [[mass graves]] and [[Detention (Imprisonment)|detention]] centers where Russian troops kept suspected fighters. After she saw the CNN footage of her son she appealed to [[prosecutor]]s, who opened a [[criminal case]] in July 2001, 17 months after his disappearance. In February 2004 they closed it again, citing lack of [[evidence]].\n\nIn 2006, Yandiyev's mother sued Russia to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) for failing to adequately investigate the case. On July 27, 2006, in a landmark ruling, the Court has held [[Russian Federation]] responsible for the \"disappearance\" and presumed death of Khadzhi-Murat Yandiyev. The court awarded Mrs Bazorkina 35,000 [[euros]] (\u00a324,000) in damages and 12,241 euros (\u00a38,400) for costs and expenses.<ref>[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=807138&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 CASE OF BAZORKINA v.

{"title_page": "Inter regalia (Scots law)", "text_new": "{{Underlinked|date=June 2019}}\n\n=== Introduction ===\n{{Scots law}}'''The ''inter regalia''''' are the rights falling to the [[Crown Estate Scotland|Crown]] (ie: [[List of Scottish monarchs|The King/Queen of Scots]]) in [[Scots property law|Scots Property law]]. The term derives from [[Latin]] ''inter'' (among) and ''regalia'' (things of the king).\n\nThere are two classes of rights, divided into:\n\n*''The regalia majora'' (major regalia), which are inseparable from the person of the sovereign.\n*''The regalia minora'' (minor regalia), which may be conveyed to a subject.\n\n== The Regalia Majora ==\n[Section in Edit]\n\n== The Regalia Minora ==\nUnder [[Scots property law#Operation of the Feudal System|feudal law]], which operated in Scotland from the [[Davidian Revolution|Davidian Revolutio]]<nowiki/>n until 28 November 2004,<ref>Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000 s.1</ref> all land in Scotland was owned by the [[Crown Estate Scotland|Crown]] (ie: [[List of Scottish monarchs|The King/Queen of Scots]] of the time). Certain rights in the land, called the ''[[Inter regalia (Scots law)|regalia minora]]'', could be reserved to the Crown when they granted land to a Crown vassal. Today, following the [[Scots property law#Feudal%20Reform%20and%20Abolition|abolition of feudalism]], any of the ''regalia minora'' that has not been expressly granted to the owner of land through previous grant or another individual as a separate legal tenement, still remains the property of the Crown under the ''Regalia Minora''.<ref>Steven, A. and Gretton, G.

However, following ''Parker v Lord Advocate''<ref>[1904] A.C. 364, (1904) 6 F. (H.L.) 37, (1904) 12 S.L.T. 33</ref>, it has been established that the right of mussel gathering and right of oyster gathering are a separate legal tenement and are the property of the Crown if not expressly granted to the owner of the mussel-bed land''.'' The Crown's right to take mussels and right to take oysters is of continued relevance due to the commercial success of Scottish seafood''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.scot/publications/identifying-options-developing-transport-infrastructure-food-drink-supply-chain-strengthen-resilience/pages/3/|title=Food and drink supply chain and transport industry: evidence report - gov.scot|website=www.gov.scot|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref><ref>In 2017, Fish and seafood accounted for the majority of food exports in Scotland and were worth approximately \u00a3944 million, up 23% from the previous year and 16% of total food and drink exports.</ref>'' The Crown, or a subsequent owner, can transfer these rights to the owner of the mussel-bed or another individual through a disposition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rosdev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/2ARM/pages/378863713/Sporting+Rights+-+Salmon+Fishing+and+Rights+to+Take+Game|title=Registers of Scotland Manuals|website=rosdev.atlassian.net|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> There are two alternatives to this option to obtain the right: (1) Obtaining the right of ownership of the tenement (shellfishing rights) through prescriptive possession The rationale for this tenement belonging to the Crown as ''regalia <u>minora</u>'', and not held for the general public under the rights of ''regalia majora'', appears to be due to the risks incumbent with [[overfishing]] the sea-bed.<ref>Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, ''Property,'' Ch 5, ''The Separate Tenements'', para 333.</ref>\n\n=== Right of port    ===\nThe Crown has the right to operate [[Port|ports]] and [[Ferry|ferry services]] as separate tenements of the land, and this right continues to be held by the Crown except where the tenement has been granted to the owners of the land.<ref>Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Ch. 6, ''Water'', ''The Separate Tenements'', para 334.</ref> Modern ports and harbours are now largely covered by [[Private bill|private legislation]] and the [[Harbours, Docks and Piers Clauses Act 1847]] (c 27).<ref>For full authoritative discussion and current legislation concerning harbours, see Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 11.</ref>  However the underlying authority for (ie: the [[Deeds registration|deeds]] of) ownership for historic ports may still be in a separate legal tenement so the right of port is of continued relevance.

Rising up the ranks of [[Sri Lanka's movement for independence]] in the early part of the 20th century, he became the first Minister of Education in the [[State Council of Ceylon]], and was instrumental in introducing extensive reforms to the country's education system that opened up education to children from all levels of society.\n\nBorn in the Southern coastal town of [[Hikkaduwa]], his academic prowess enabled him to win a Foundation Scholarship to [[Richmond College (Sri Lanka)|Richmond College]], [[Galle]], a prestigious secondary school at the time. After leaving school, he worked as a teacher in Mathematics at Wesley College, Colombo and Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa. He excelled as a lawyer in the Southern Province which made the public of the area to nominate him to contest at the legislative council election representing the Southern Province at which he made an easy win as a member of the legislative council. This was the beginning of his political career. Later, he entered the national movement for independence. Kannangara was first elected to the Ceylon Legislative Council in 1923 and then to the State Council. He also served as the President of the Ceylon National Congress.\n\nAs Minister of Education in the State Council, Kannangara introduced extensive reforms to the education system of Sri Lanka throughout the 1940s. They benefitted thousands of underprivileged students in rural parts of the country by making education free for all students.

Among the reforms he introduced, which came into operation on 1 October 1945,<ref name='dn-9/24/03'/> were to make education free of charge for all students, to ensure that every student was provided with instruction in the religion of his/her parents, to prevent teachers from been exploited by managers of schools by having their wages paid directly by the government and to make adequate provisions for [[adult education]] in the country.<ref name='moe-ho'/>\n\nHe also established a series of [[Madhya Vidyalaya|central schools]] (''Madhya  Vidhyala''), modelled on [[Royal College, Colombo]], in locations outside major cities.
