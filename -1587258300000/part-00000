The [[Brothers Grimm]] published it in 1812 in the first edition of their collection ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]''. It was titled in German: ''Sneewittchen'' (in modern orthography ''Schneewittchen'') and numbered as Tale 53. The name ''Sneewittchen'' was [[Low German]] and in the first version it was translated with ''Schneewei\u00dfchen''. The Grimms completed their final revision of the story in 1854.<ref name=multiple2/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qr3BAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Snow+White%22+is+a+German+fairy+tale+known+across+much+of+Europe+and+is+today+one+of+the+most+famous+fairy+tales+worldwide#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Original Folk and Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm: The Complete First ... |author1=Jacob Grimm |author2=Wilhelm Grimm |website=Books.google.co.in |date=2014-10-19 |accessdate=2016-04-05|isbn=9781400851898 }}</ref>\n\nThe fairy tale features such elements as the [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|magic mirror]], the poisoned apple, the glass coffin, and the characters of the [[Evil Queen]] and the [[Seven Dwarfs]]. The seven dwarfs were first given individual names in the 1912 Broadway play ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1912 play)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' and then given [[List of names of the Seven Dwarfs|different names]] in [[Walt Disney]]'s 1937 film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''. The Grimm story, which is commonly referred to as \"Snow White\",<ref name=bartels/> should not be confused with the story of \"[[Snow-White and Rose-Red]]\" (in German \"''Schneewei\u00dfchen und Rosenrot''\"), another fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm.\n\nIn the [[Aarne\u2013Thompson classification systems|Aarne\u2013Thompson folklore classification]], tales of this kind are grouped together as type 709, Snow White. Others of this kind include \"[[Bella Venezia]]\", \"[[Myrsina]]\", \"[[Nourie Hadig]]\", \"[[Gold-Tree and Silver-Tree]]\",<ref name=surla/> \"[[The Young Slave]]\", and \"[[La petite Toute-Belle]]\".\n\n==Story==\n[[File:Makart hans das schlafende schneewittchen.jpg|left|thumb|The fable's antagonist the [[Evil Queen]] with the protagonist Snow White as depicted in ''The Sleeping Snow White'' by [[Hans Makart]] (1872)]]\n\nAt the beginning of the story, a queen sits sewing at an open window during a winter snowfall when she pricks her finger with her needle, causing three drops of red blood to drip onto the freshly fallen white snow on the black windowsill. Then, she says to herself, \"How I wish that I had a daughter that had skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as night.\" Some time later, the queen gives birth to a baby daughter whom she names Snow White, but the queen dies in childbirth a short while later.<ref name=\"multiple2\" /><ref name=HTV/>\n\nA year later, Snow White's father, [[King (Snow White)|the king]], marries again. His new wife is very beautiful, but she is a vain and wicked woman who practices witchcraft. [[Evil Queen|The new queen]] possesses a [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|magic mirror]], which she asks every morning, \"Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?\" The mirror always tells the queen that she is the fairest. The queen is always pleased with that, because the magic mirror never lies. But as Snow White grows up, she becomes more beautiful each day and even more beautiful than her stepmother. When the queen asks her mirror, it tells her that Snow White is the fairest.<ref name=\"multiple2\"/><ref name=HTV/>\n\nThis gives the queen a great shock. She becomes envious, and from that moment on, her heart turns against Snow White, whom the queen grows to hate increasingly with time. Eventually, the angry queen orders [[Huntsman (Snow White)|a huntsman]] to take Snow White into the forest to be killed. As proof that Snow White is dead, the queen demands that he returns with her lungs and liver, which she will consume in order to become as beautiful as Snow White. The huntsman takes Snow White into the forest, but after raising his knife he finds himself unable to kill her. When Snow White finds out about her stepmother's plan, she tearfully begs, \"Spare me this mockery of justice! I will run away into the forest and never come home again!\" The huntsman reluctantly agrees to spare Snow White and brings the queen the lungs and liver of a boar instead.<ref name=\"multiple2\" /><ref name=HTV/>\n\nAfter wandering through the forest for hours, Snow White discovers a tiny cottage belonging to a group of [[Seven Dwarfs|seven dwarfs]]. Since no one is at home, she eats some of the tiny meals, drinks some of their wine, and then tests all the beds. Finally, the last bed is comfortable enough for her and she falls asleep. When the dwarfs return home, they immediately become aware that there is a burglar in their house, because everything in their home is in disorder. Prowling about frantically, they head upstairs and discover the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them what happened, and the dwarfs take pity on her and let her stay with them in exchange for housekeeping. They warn her to be careful when alone at home and to let no one in while they are working in the mountains.<ref name=\"multiple2\" /><ref name=HTV/>\n\nMeanwhile, the queen, believing that Snow White is dead, asks her mirror once again: \"Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?\" The mirror tells her that Snow White is still the fairest in the land.<ref name=\"multiple2\"/> The queen is furious when she learns that Snow White is still alive, and decides to kill the girl herself. She appears at the dwarfs' cottage, disguised as an old peddler, and offers Snow White colorful, silky [[bodice|laced bodices]] as a present; the queen laces her up so tightly that Snow White faints. The dwarfs return just in time, and Snow White revives when the dwarfs loosen the laces.<ref name=\"multiple2\"/><ref name=HTV/> Upon hearing from her Magic Mirror that Snow White still lives, the queen dresses as a comb seller and convinces Snow White to take a beautiful comb as a present; she brushes Snow White's hair with the poisoned comb. The girl faints again, but she is again revived by the dwarfs when they remove the comb from her hair. The Magic Mirror informs the queen that her plan has failed again and Snow White is not dead, so the queen disguises herself as a farmer's wife and offers Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White is hesitant to accept it, so the queen cuts the apple in half, eating the white (harmless) half and giving the red poisoned half to Snow White. The girl eagerly takes a bite and falls down unconscious. This time, the dwarfs are unable to revive Snow White. Assuming that she is dead, they place her in a glass casket.<ref name=\"multiple2\"/><ref name=HTV/>\n\nThree days later, [[Prince Charming|a prince]] stumbles upon Snow White lying in her glass coffin during a hunting trip. After hearing her story from the seven dwarfs, the prince is allowed to take Snow White to her proper resting place. While Snow White is being transported, one of the prince's servants trips and loses his balance. This dislodges the piece of poisoned apple from Snow White's throat, reviving her. In the first edition, Snow White is carried to the palace without mishap, but later a servant, frustrated by the inconvenience caused by the prince's fawning over her, hits the body and dislodges the apple.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Grimm|first1=Jacob|last2=Grimm|first2=Wilhelm|editor1-last=Zipes|editor1-first=Jack|title=The Original Folk and Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm: the complete first edition.|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn= 9780691160597|oclc=879662315}}, I pp. 184-85.</ref> The prince is overjoyed, and declares his love for Snow White. Snow White agrees to marry him.\n\nSnow White and the prince invite everyone to their wedding party, including Snow White's stepmother.\n\nThe queen, still believing that Snow White is dead, again asks her magic mirror who is the fairest in the land. The mirror says that the prince's bride is the fairest. Not knowing that the bride is her stepdaughter, the queen arrives at the wedding to investigate. Frozen with rage and fear, she tries to sow chaos but the prince recognizes her as a threat. He orders that she wear a pair of red-hot iron slippers and dance in them until she drops dead for the attempted murder of Snow White.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Franz J\u00fcttner's illustrations from ''Sneewittchen'' (1905)\">\nFile:Franz J\u00fcttner Schneewittchen 1.jpg|1.

In 1994, a German historian named Eckhard Sander published ''Schneewittchen: M\u00e4rchen oder Wahrheit?'' (''Snow White: Fairy Tale or Truth?''), claiming he had uncovered an account that may have inspired the story that first appeared in [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|''Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales'']]. According to Sander, the character of Snow White was based on the life of [[Margaretha von Waldeck]], a German countess born to [[Philipp IV, Count of Waldeck|Philip IV]] in 1533. At the age of 16, Margarete was forced by her stepmother, Katharina of Hatzfeld, to move away to [[Brussels]]. There, Margarete fell in love with a prince who would later become [[Philip II of Spain]]. Margarete's father and stepmother disapproved of the relationship as it was \u2018politically inconvenient\u2019. Margarete mysteriously died at the age of 21, apparently having been poisoned. Historical accounts point to the King of Spain who, in opposing the romance, may have dispatched Spanish agents to murder Margarete.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Schneewittchen: Marchen oder Wahrheit? : ein lokaler Bezug zum Kellerwald|last = Sander|first = Eckhard|year = 1994|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>\n\nScholar Graham Anderson compares the story of Snow White to the Roman legend of [[Daedalion#Mythology|Chione]], recorded in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. The name ''Chione'' means \"Snow\" in Greek and, in the story, she is described as the most beautiful woman in the land, so beautiful that the gods [[Apollo]] and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] both fell in love with her. Mercury put her to sleep with the touch of his [[caduceus]] and raped her in her sleep. Then Apollo, disguised as an old crone, approached her and raped her again. These affections led Chione to openly boast that she was more beautiful than the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] herself, resulting in Diana shooting her through the tongue with an arrow.<ref>[[Ovid]], Metamorphoses, Book XI, 289</ref><ref>{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the ancient world |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|url= https://books.google.com/?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC&pg=PA27&dq=Fairytale+in+the+ancient+world+rhodopis&cd=1#v=onepage&q=Fairytale%20in%20the%20ancient%20world%20rhodopis&f=false|accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nKarlheinz Bartels, a pharmacist and scholar from [[Lohr am Main]], a town in northwestern [[Bavaria]], found evidence that Snow White was Maria Sophia Margarethe Catharina, Baroness von und zu Erthal, who was born in Lohr on June 25, 1725.<ref>{{cite book |url= |title=Schneewittchen \u2013 Zur Fabulologie des Spessarts |last=Bartels|first=Karlheinz |publisher=Geschichts- und Museumsverein Lohr a.

Disney's variation of Snow White gave the [[List of names of the Seven Dwarfs|dwarfs names]] and included a singing [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]]. The Disney film also is the only version in which Snow White and her prince meet before she bites the apple; in fact, it is this meeting that sets the plot in motion. Instead of her lungs and liver, as written in the original, the huntsman is asked by [[Evil Queen (Disney)|the queen]] to bring back Snow White's heart. While the heart is mentioned, it is never shown in the box. Snow White is much more mature (an adolescent). And she is discovered by the dwarfs after ''cleaning'' the house, not vandalizing it. Furthermore, in the Disney movie the evil queen tries only once to kill Snow White (by a poisoned apple) and fails (this was likely to save time). She then dies by falling down a cliff and being crushed by a boulder, after the dwarfs had chased her through the forest. In the original, the queen is forced to dance to death.<ref>Grimm's Complete Fairy Tales, p 194, {{ISBN|978-1-60710-313-4}}</ref>\n\nMany later versions omit the Queen's attempted [[cannibalism]], eating what she believed to be the lungs and liver of Snow White. This may be a reference to old [[Slavic mythology]] which includes tales of witches eating human [[heart]]s.\n\n==In other traditions==\nMany other variations of the story exist across and outside Europe. In some of these variations the dwarfs are robbers, while the magic mirror is a dialogue with the sun or moon.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n* In a version from Albania, collected by [[Johann Georg von Hahn]],<ref name=\"hahn\" /> the main character lives with 40 dragons, and her sleep is caused by a ring. The beginning of the story has a twist, in that a teacher urges the heroine to kill her evil stepmother so that she would take her place. The origin of this tale is debated; it is likely no older than the Middle Ages. In fact, there are possibly two Albanian versions of Snow White: one in which her stepmother tries to kill her, and another in which her two jealous sisters try to kill her.\n* \"The Jealous Sisters\" is another Albanian fairy tale.

For example, the huntsman, who was ordered to kill Snow White, describes her as a \"pretty child\" and lets her go, which carries over to when the seven dwarfs decide not to cast her out when they find Snow White in their home. Even when the Queen devises the poison apple and kills Snow White, she is saved by the Prince because he finds her to be \"the fairest of them all.\" The Queen dies at the end of the story while Snow White lives happily ever after with the Prince, implying that the Queen's cunning was not enough to counter the power of Snow White's elegance. This suggests that the moral of the story is that beauty is more desirable than intelligence. Despite the modern connotations of this concept, one must consider the time period at which the story was written; Snow White as told by the Brothers Grimm was first published in 1812, where at the time, it was arguably common place for people to live according to traditional gender roles.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Children's literature|Germany}}\n*[[Sne\u017eana]], a Slavic female name meaning \"snow woman\" with a similar connotation to \"Snow White\"\n* \"[[Snow-White-Fire-Red]]\", an Italian fairy tale\n* \"[[Sleeping Beauty]]\"\n*\"[[The Glass Coffin]]\"\n*\"[[Udea and her Seven Brothers]]\" \n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=multiple2>Jacob Grimm & Wilhelm Grimm: ''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen''; Band 1, 7.

The seven dwarfs were first given individual names in the 1912 Broadway play ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1912 play)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' and then given [[List of names of the Seven Dwarfs|different names]] in [[Walt Disney]]'s 1937 film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''. The Grimm story, which is commonly referred to as \"Snow White\",<ref name=bartels/> should not be confused with the story of \"[[Snow-White and Rose-Red]]\" (in German \"''Schneewei\u00dfchen und Rosenrot''\"), another fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm.\n\nIn the [[Aarne\u2013Thompson classification systems|Aarne\u2013Thompson folklore classification]], tales of this kind are grouped together as type 709, Snow White. Others of this kind include \"[[Bella Venezia]]\", \"[[Myrsina]]\", \"[[Nourie Hadig]]\", \"[[Gold-Tree and Silver-Tree]]\",<ref name=surla/> \"[[The Young Slave]]\", and \"[[La petite Toute-Belle]]\".\n\n==Story==\n[[File:Makart hans das schlafende schneewittchen.jpg|left|thumb|The fable's antagonist the [[Evil Queen]] with the protagonist Snow White as depicted in ''The Sleeping Snow White'' by [[Hans Makart]] (1872)]]\n\nAt the beginning of the story, a queen sits sewing at an open window during a winter snowfall when she pricks her finger with her needle, causing three drops of red blood to drip onto the freshly fallen white snow on the black windowsill. Then, she says to herself, \"How I wish that I had a daughter that had skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as night.\" Some time later, the queen gives birth to a baby daughter whom she names Snow White, but the queen dies in childbirth a short while later.<ref name=\"multiple2\" /><ref name=HTV/>\n\nA year later, Snow White's father, [[King (Snow White)|the king]], marries again. His new wife is very beautiful, but she is a vain and wicked woman who practices witchcraft. [[Evil Queen|The new queen]] possesses a [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|magic mirror]], which she asks every morning, \"Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?\" The mirror always tells the queen that she is the fairest. The queen is always pleased with that, because the magic mirror never lies. But as Snow White grows up, she becomes more beautiful each day and even more beautiful than her stepmother. When the queen asks her mirror, it tells her that Snow White is the fairest.<ref name=\"multiple2\"/><ref name=HTV/>\n\nThis gives the queen a great shock. She becomes envious, and from that moment on, her heart turns against Snow White, whom the queen grows to hate increasingly with time. Eventually, the angry queen orders [[Huntsman (Snow White)|a huntsman]] to take Snow White into the forest to be killed. As proof that Snow White is dead, the queen demands that he returns with her lungs and liver, which she will consume in order to become as beautiful as Snow White. The huntsman takes Snow White into the forest, but after raising his knife he finds himself unable to kill her. When Snow White finds out about her stepmother's plan, she tearfully begs, \"Spare me this mockery of justice!

Since no one is at home, she eats some of the tiny meals, drinks some of their wine, and then tests all the beds. Finally, the last bed is comfortable enough for her and she falls asleep. When the dwarfs return home, they immediately become aware that there is a burglar in their house, because everything in their home is in disorder. Prowling about frantically, they head upstairs and discover the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them what happened, and the dwarfs take pity on her and let her stay with them in exchange for housekeeping. They warn her to be careful when alone at home and to let no one in while they are working in the mountains.<ref name=\"multiple2\" /><ref name=HTV/>\n\nMeanwhile, the queen, believing that Snow White is dead, asks her mirror once again: \"Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?\" The mirror tells her that Snow White is still the fairest in the land.<ref name=\"multiple2\"/> The queen is furious when she learns that Snow White is still alive, and decides to kill the girl herself. She appears at the dwarfs' cottage, disguised as an old peddler, and offers Snow White colorful, silky [[bodice|laced bodices]] as a present; the queen laces her up so tightly that Snow White faints. The dwarfs return just in time, and Snow White revives when the dwarfs loosen the laces.<ref name=\"multiple2\"/><ref name=HTV/> Upon hearing from her Magic Mirror that Snow White still lives, the queen dresses as a comb seller and convinces Snow White to take a beautiful comb as a present; she brushes Snow White's hair with the poisoned comb. The girl faints again, but she is again revived by the dwarfs when they remove the comb from her hair. The Magic Mirror informs the queen that her plan has failed again and Snow White is not dead, so the queen disguises herself as a farmer's wife and offers Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White is hesitant to accept it, so the queen cuts the apple in half, eating the white (harmless) half and giving the red poisoned half to Snow White. The girl eagerly takes a bite and falls down unconscious. This time, the dwarfs are unable to revive Snow White. Assuming that she is dead, they place her in a glass casket.<ref name=\"multiple2\"/><ref name=HTV/>\n\nThree days later, [[Prince Charming|a prince]] stumbles upon Snow White lying in her glass coffin during a hunting trip. After hearing her story from the seven dwarfs, the prince is allowed to take Snow White to her proper resting place. While Snow White is being transported, one of the prince's servants trips and loses his balance. This dislodges the piece of poisoned apple from Snow White's throat, reviving her. In the first edition, Snow White is carried to the palace without mishap, but later a servant, frustrated by the inconvenience caused by the prince's fawning over her, hits the body and dislodges the apple.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Grimm|first1=Jacob|last2=Grimm|first2=Wilhelm|editor1-last=Zipes|editor1-first=Jack|title=The Original Folk and Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm: the complete first edition.|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn= 9780691160597|oclc=879662315}}, I pp. 184-85.</ref> The prince is overjoyed, and declares his love for Snow White.

The mirror says that the prince's bride is the fairest. Not knowing that the bride is her stepdaughter, the queen arrives at the wedding to investigate. Frozen with rage and fear, she tries to sow chaos but the prince recognizes her as a threat.

In 1994, a German historian named Eckhard Sander published ''Schneewittchen: M\u00e4rchen oder Wahrheit?'' (''Snow White: Fairy Tale or Truth?''), claiming he had uncovered an account that may have inspired the story that first appeared in [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|''Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales'']]. According to Sander, the character of Snow White was based on the life of [[Margaretha von Waldeck]], a German countess born to [[Philipp IV, Count of Waldeck|Philip IV]] in 1533. At the age of 16, Margarete was forced by her stepmother, Katharina of Hatzfeld, to move away to [[Brussels]]. There, Margarete fell in love with a prince who would later become [[Philip II of Spain]]. Margarete's father and stepmother disapproved of the relationship as it was \u2018politically inconvenient\u2019. Margarete mysteriously died at the age of 21, apparently having been poisoned. Historical accounts point to the King of Spain who, in opposing the romance, may have dispatched Spanish agents to murder Margarete.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Schneewittchen: Marchen oder Wahrheit? : ein lokaler Bezug zum Kellerwald|last = Sander|first = Eckhard|year = 1994|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>\n\nScholar Graham Anderson compares the story of Snow White to the Roman legend of [[Daedalion#Mythology|Chione]], recorded in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. The name ''Chione'' means \"Snow\" in Greek and, in the story, she is described as the most beautiful woman in the land, so beautiful that the gods [[Apollo]] and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] both fell in love with her. Mercury put her to sleep with the touch of his [[caduceus]] and raped her in her sleep. Then Apollo, disguised as an old crone, approached her and raped her again. These affections led Chione to openly boast that she was more beautiful than the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] herself, resulting in Diana shooting her through the tongue with an arrow.<ref>[[Ovid]], Metamorphoses, Book XI, 289</ref><ref>{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the ancient world |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|url= https://books.google.com/?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC&pg=PA27&dq=Fairytale+in+the+ancient+world+rhodopis&cd=1#v=onepage&q=Fairytale%20in%20the%20ancient%20world%20rhodopis&f=false|accessdate=4 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nKarlheinz Bartels, a pharmacist and scholar from [[Lohr am Main]], a town in northwestern [[Bavaria]], found evidence that Snow White was Maria Sophia Margarethe Catharina, Baroness von und zu Erthal, who was born in Lohr on June 25, 1725.<ref>{{cite book |url= |title=Schneewittchen \u2013 Zur Fabulologie des Spessarts |last=Bartels|first=Karlheinz |publisher=Geschichts- und Museumsverein Lohr a.

Disney's variation of Snow White gave the [[List of names of the Seven Dwarfs|dwarfs names]] and included a singing [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]]. The Disney film also is the only version in which Snow White and her prince meet before she bites the apple; in fact, it is this meeting that sets the plot in motion. Instead of her lungs and liver, as written in the original, the huntsman is asked by [[Evil Queen (Disney)|the queen]] to bring back Snow White's heart. While the heart is mentioned, it is never shown in the box. Snow White is much more mature (an adolescent). And she is discovered by the dwarfs after ''cleaning'' the house, not vandalizing it. Furthermore, in the Disney movie the evil queen tries only once to kill Snow White (by a poisoned apple) and fails (this was likely to save time). She then dies by falling down a cliff and being crushed by a boulder, after the dwarfs had chased her through the forest. In the original, the queen is forced to dance to death.<ref>Grimm's Complete Fairy Tales, p 194, {{ISBN|978-1-60710-313-4}}</ref>\n\nMany later versions omit the Queen's attempted [[cannibalism]], eating what she believed to be the lungs and liver of Snow White. This may be a reference to old [[Slavic mythology]] which includes tales of witches eating human [[heart]]s.\n\n==In other traditions==\nMany other variations of the story exist across and outside Europe. In some of these variations the dwarfs are robbers, while the magic mirror is a dialogue with the sun or moon.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n* In a version from Albania, collected by [[Johann Georg von Hahn]],<ref name=\"hahn\" /> the main character lives with 40 dragons, and her sleep is caused by a ring. The beginning of the story has a twist, in that a teacher urges the heroine to kill her evil stepmother so that she would take her place. The origin of this tale is debated; it is likely no older than the Middle Ages. In fact, there are possibly two Albanian versions of Snow White: one in which her stepmother tries to kill her, and another in which her two jealous sisters try to kill her.\n* \"The Jealous Sisters\" is another Albanian fairy tale.

For example, the huntsman, who was ordered to kill Snow White, describes her as a \"pretty child\" and lets her go, which carries over to when the seven dwarfs decide not to cast her out when they find Snow White in their home. Even when the Queen devises the poison apple and kills Snow White, she is saved by the Prince because he finds her to be \"the fairest of them all.\" The Queen dies at the end of the story while Snow White lives happily ever after with the Prince, implying that the Queen's cunning was not enough to counter the power of Snow White's elegance. This suggests that the moral of the story is that beauty is more desirable than intelligence. Despite the modern connotations of this concept, one must consider the time period at which the story was written; Snow White as told by the Brothers Grimm was first published in 1812, where at the time, it was arguably common place for people to live according to traditional gender roles.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Children's literature|Germany}}\n*[[Sne\u017eana]], a Slavic female name meaning \"snow woman\" with a similar connotation to \"Snow White\"\n* \"[[Snow-White-Fire-Red]]\", an Italian fairy tale\n* \"[[Sleeping Beauty]]\"\n*\"[[The Glass Coffin]]\"\n*\"[[Udea and her Seven Brothers]]\" \n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=multiple2>Jacob Grimm & Wilhelm Grimm: ''Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen''; Band 1, 7.

It is based on the series of novels and short stories by [[P. G. Wodehouse]] that centre around the character of [[Bertie Wooster]] and his loyal valet, [[Jeeves]]. \n\nPremiering on April 22, 1975, at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] in London, the show flopped initially, running for only a month. After rewrites, the show was produced in 1996 in both London and America, and premiered on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 2001.  \n\n==1975: ''Jeeves''==\n\n===Background and production===\n[[Tim Rice]] conceived the idea of turning P. G. Wodehouse's Jeeves stories into a musical. Originally, he was to work with his then-partner, [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], but Rice backed out of the project.<ref name=\"name\">Andrew Lloyd Webber: His Life and Works \u2013 Walsh, Michael (1989, revised and expanded, 1997),P.82, Abrams: New York</ref> Eventually Lloyd Webber teamed up with famed British playwright [[Alan Ayckbourn]], and the two of them began work with the personal blessing of Wodehouse. Ayckbourn utilised characters and plot lines from several Jeeves and Wooster stories, notably ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. The action takes place at the East London Club for Unmanageable Boys, where Bertie Wooster is playing a banjo concert; his banjo keeps breaking down, so he is forced to tell stories to pass the time while Jeeves is sent off to fetch new strings.  Bertie recounts how he managed to become engaged to three ladies simultaneously and how his valet Jeeves (through ingenious intervention) unravelled the complications.\n\n[[Tryout (theatre)|Tryout]] performances were held at the [[Bristol Hippodrome]] between 20 March and 5 April 1975. According to the programme, the Bristol show was presented by [[David Land]] and [[Guy Bolton]].<ref name=bristol>{{cite web | url=https://overtures.org.uk/?p=6901| title=JEEVES \u2013 40 years on| website=Overtures: The Bunnet-Muir Musical Theatre Archive Trust | date = 13 April 2015 | accessdate=30 October 2019}}</ref> Unfortunately, the loyalty to the Wodehouse material made for an epic length (four and three-quarter hours at the Bristol tryouts), and reducing the duration made for creative tensions.<ref name=autogenerated2>Andrew Lloyd Webber: His Life and Works \u2013 Walsh, Michael (1989, revised and expanded, 1997),P.84-85, Abrams: New York</ref> Rows broke out about the presence of an all-male singing sextet accompanying Bertie Wooster and the realization that the first woman did not appear on stage until thirty-five minutes had passed.<ref name=\"name\" /> Additional problems were caused by Ayckbourn's disinterest in musical theater as a genre: he was quoted at one point as saying, \"I think musicals are pretty damn boring, but I hope this one is a bit different\", and he ended up writing a book that could hypothetically stand on its own without songs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Andrew Lloyd Webber: His Life and Works|last=Walsh|first=Michael|publisher=|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=84\u201385}}</ref>\n\nLloyd Webber wrote a period score that eschewed all traces of the pop inflections of his work on ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'' and ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''.  The sound of trumpets, banjos and saxophones for this score were written by a group of arrangers: Keith Amos, [[Don Walker (orchestrator)|Don Walker]], Lloyd Webber himself and his future orchestrator, David Cullen.\n\nThe show opened in London on 22 April 1975 at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]], starring [[David Hemmings]] as Bertie Wooster and [[Michael Aldridge]] as Jeeves. The role of Madeleine Bassett was performed by T.V. actress [[Gabrielle Drake]]. Other cast members included Debbie Bowen, Gordon Clyde, Angela Easterling, [[John Turner (actor)|John Turner]], [[Bill Wallis]] and [[David Wood (actor)|David Wood]]. Actress [[Betty Marsden]] was cast as Aunt Dahlia, but the role and the accomplished actress were released before opening night.<ref name=autogenerated1>Andrew Lloyd Webber: His Life and Works \u2013 Walsh, Michael (1989, revised and expanded, 1997),P.85, Abrams: New York</ref>\n\nThe director [[Eric Thompson]] (father of actress [[Emma Thompson]]) was fired just before the opening, so Ayckbourn himself stepped into the fray, aided by choreographer [[Christopher Bruce]].  The production received poor reviews and closed after little over a month and 38 performances, on 24 May. Several critics noted that the authors failed to develop the title character, Jeeves not even having a solo song.\n\nThe original cast album (MCA Cat. No. MCF 2726) was recorded and released, but it is extremely hard to find. Lloyd Webber, reportedly acting on the advice of American theatre director [[Harold Prince]], withdrew the recording in order to be able to reuse some of the musical material in subsequent shows.\n\n===Roles and original cast===\nThe following is a list of the roles in the 1975 musical, with the original cast.<ref name=castlist>{{cite web | url=http://jeeves.alanayckbourn.net/page16/ | title=Jeeves / By Jeeves: Significant Productions | website=Alan Ayckbourn | publisher=Haydonning Ltd | last=Murgatroyd | first=Simon | accessdate=30 October 2019}}</ref>\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bertie Wooster]] \u2013\u00a0[[David Hemmings]]\n* [[Jeeves]] \u2013 [[Michael Aldridge]]\n* [[Stinker Pinker|Harold \"Stinker\" Pinker]] \u2013\u00a0[[Gordon Clyde]]\n* [[Gussie Fink-Nottle]] \u2013\u00a0[[Christopher Good]]\n* [[Sir Watkyn Bassett]] \u2013\u00a0[[Bill Wallis]]\n* [[Roderick Spode]] \u2013 [[John Turner (actor)|John Turner]]\n* [[Honoria Glossop]] \u2013\u00a0Angela Easterling\n* [[List of Jeeves characters#Seppings|Seppings]] \u2013\u00a0[[Graham Hamilton]]\n* Ramsay, the parlourmaid \u2013\u00a0Elaine Louden\n* Dawkins, the kitchenmaid \u2013\u00a0Jini Steel \n* [[Madeline Bassett]] \u2013\u00a0[[Gabrielle Drake]]\n* [[List of Jeeves characters#Stiffy Byng|Stiffy Byng]] \u2013\u00a0Debbie Bowen\n* [[Bingo Little]] \u2013\u00a0[[David Wood (actor)|David Wood]]\n* [[Aunt Dahlia]] \u2013 [[Betty Marsden]]*\n* Sharkey, a gardener's boy \u2013\u00a0Peter Kosta\n* Cropper, a gardener's boy \u2013 Brett Forrest\n* [[Drones Club|The Drones Club]] \u2013\u00a0Derek Beard, Bill Boazman, [[John Dicks (actor)|John Dicks]], David Cordwell, Sam Cox, and Terry Wood\n}}\n\nThe list includes Betty Marsden, who was cast as Aunt Dahlia.

A small section of \"Half a Moment\" was cut from the song and reused in [[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|''Sunset Boulevard'']] as part of the song \"As if We Never Said Goodbye\".\n\nThe melody of \"Female of the Species\" appeared earlier than its Jeeves incarnation, with lyrics written and sung by [[Tim Rice]] as \"The Ballad of Robert and Peter\" in 1973 (for private recording purposes).<ref name=\"Andrew Lloyd Webber 2001\">Andrew Lloyd Webber, ''Now & Forever'',(CD boxed set)-liner notes, Polydor Ltd.2001.</ref> \"Travel Hopefully\" is a melody originally written as \"Love Is Here\" for the first ever Lloyd Webber/Rice project, ''[[The Likes of Us]]''.\n\n==1996: ''By Jeeves''==\n\n===Background===\nIn 1996, [[Andrew Lloyd Webber|Lloyd Webber]] and [[Alan Ayckbourn|Ayckbourn]] decided to revisit the show, jettisoning most of the score and the entire original book.   Retitled ''By Jeeves'' (so as to dispel all previous associations with the original production), the character of Roderick Spode and his fascistic intentions were eliminated from the plot.  The character list was whittled down from 22 to 10, and the original orchestrations also underwent a reduction to a little band. Only three songs from the original show remained lyrically intact: \"Banjo Boy\", \"Half a Moment\" and \"Travel Hopefully\".   The other songs and musical interludes were mostly new or reworked compositions by Lloyd Webber.\n\n===Productions===\n''By Jeeves'' re-opened on 1 May 1996 at the [[Stephen Joseph Theatre]]-in-the-round in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire]], an English seaside resort. Audience reaction was generally enthusiastic so the show moved on 2 July 1996 to London for a 12-week season at the fairly intimate [[Duke of York's Theatre]]. The show turned out to be more popular than first thought, and the run was extended to February 1997 with the show moved to [[Lyric Theatre (London)|The Lyric Theatre]] in [[Shaftesbury Avenue]].<ref>[http://www.thisistheatre.com/shows/dukeofyorks144.html \"By Jeeves\" partial listing] thisistheatre.com</ref>\n\n[[Steven Pacey]] played Bertie Wooster and [[Malcolm Sinclair (actor)|Malcolm Sinclair]] played his valet Jeeves. The Musical Director was Kate Young. The 1996 cast recording has an unusual format, taking a track between every song where Bertie and Jeeves humorously summarize the plot.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Jeeves-1996-London-Revival-Cast/dp/B000001EYU \"By Jeeves\", 1996 London Revival Cast] amazon.com</ref> Pacey was nominated for an [[Olivier Award]] for Best Actor in a Musical, and ''By Jeeves'' also received nominations for Outstanding New Production and Best Costume Designer.<ref>[http://www.albemarle-london.com/awards/AwardWinners.php?Award_Type=Laurence%20Olivier%20Awards&Year=1997 Olivier Awards, wins and nominations, for 1996 season] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315052952/http://www.albemarle-london.com/awards/AwardWinners.php?Award_Type=Laurence%20Olivier%20Awards&Year=1997 |date=2008-03-15 }} albemarle-london.com</ref> A radio version, performed by the original London cast, was broadcast on 14 December 1996 on [[BBC Radio 2]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/77ed879bd91a408686e2fdda7c82e286 | title=By Jeeves | website=BBC Genome | publisher=BBC | accessdate=6 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe show had its United States premiere on 12 November 1996, at the [[Goodspeed Opera House]] in [[Connecticut]].

It is based on the series of novels and short stories by [[P. G. Wodehouse]] that centre around the character of [[Bertie Wooster]] and his loyal valet, [[Jeeves]]. \n\nPremiering on April 22, 1975, at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] in London, the show flopped initially, running for only a month. After rewrites, the show was produced in 1996 in both London and America, and premiered on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 2001.  \n\n==1975: ''Jeeves''==\n\n===Background and production===\n[[Tim Rice]] conceived the idea of turning P. G. Wodehouse's Jeeves stories into a musical. Originally, he was to work with his then-partner, [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], but Rice backed out of the project.<ref name=\"name\">Andrew Lloyd Webber: His Life and Works \u2013 Walsh, Michael (1989, revised and expanded, 1997),P.82, Abrams: New York</ref> Eventually Lloyd Webber teamed up with famed British playwright [[Alan Ayckbourn]], and the two of them began work with the personal blessing of Wodehouse. Ayckbourn utilised characters and plot lines from several Jeeves and Wooster stories, notably ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. The action takes place at the East London Club for Unmanageable Boys, where Bertie Wooster is playing a banjo concert; his banjo keeps breaking down, so he is forced to tell stories to pass the time while Jeeves is sent off to fetch new strings.  Bertie recounts how he managed to become engaged to three ladies simultaneously and how his valet Jeeves (through ingenious intervention) unravelled the complications.\n\n[[Tryout (theatre)|Tryout]] performances were held at the [[Bristol Hippodrome]] between 20 March and 5 April 1975. According to the programme, the Bristol show was presented by [[David Land]] and [[Guy Bolton]].<ref name=bristol>{{cite web | url=https://overtures.org.uk/?p=6901| title=JEEVES \u2013 40 years on| website=Overtures: The Bunnet-Muir Musical Theatre Archive Trust | date = 13 April 2015 | accessdate=30 October 2019}}</ref> Unfortunately, the loyalty to the Wodehouse material made for an epic length (four and three-quarter hours at the Bristol tryouts), and reducing the duration made for creative tensions.<ref name=autogenerated2>Andrew Lloyd Webber: His Life and Works \u2013 Walsh, Michael (1989, revised and expanded, 1997),P.84-85, Abrams: New York</ref> Rows broke out about the presence of an all-male singing sextet accompanying Bertie Wooster and the realization that the first woman did not appear on stage until thirty-five minutes had passed.<ref name=\"name\" /> Additional problems were caused by Ayckbourn's disinterest in musical theater as a genre: he was quoted at one point as saying, \"I think musicals are pretty damn boring, but I hope this one is a bit different\", and he ended up writing a book that could hypothetically stand on its own without songs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Andrew Lloyd Webber: His Life and Works|last=Walsh|first=Michael|publisher=|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=84\u201385}}</ref>\n\nLloyd Webber wrote a period score that eschewed all traces of the pop inflections of his work on ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'' and ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''.  The sound of trumpets, banjos and saxophones for this score were written by a group of arrangers: Keith Amos, [[Don Walker (orchestrator)|Don Walker]], Lloyd Webber himself and his future orchestrator, David Cullen.\n\nThe show opened in London on 22 April 1975 at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]], starring [[David Hemmings]] as Bertie Wooster and [[Michael Aldridge]] as Jeeves. The role of Madeleine Bassett was performed by T.V. actress [[Gabrielle Drake]]. Other cast members included Debbie Bowen, Gordon Clyde, Angela Easterling, [[John Turner (actor)|John Turner]], [[Bill Wallis]] and [[David Wood (actor)|David Wood]]. Actress [[Betty Marsden]] was cast as Aunt Dahlia, but the role and the accomplished actress were released before opening night.<ref name=autogenerated1>Andrew Lloyd Webber: His Life and Works \u2013 Walsh, Michael (1989, revised and expanded, 1997),P.85, Abrams: New York</ref>\n\nThe director [[Eric Thompson]] (father of actress [[Emma Thompson]]) was fired just before the opening, so Ayckbourn himself stepped into the fray, aided by choreographer [[Christopher Bruce]].  The production received poor reviews and closed after little over a month and 38 performances, on 24 May. Several critics noted that the authors failed to develop the title character, Jeeves not even having a solo song.\n\nThe original cast album (MCA Cat. No. MCF 2726) was recorded and released, but it is extremely hard to find. Lloyd Webber, reportedly acting on the advice of American theatre director [[Harold Prince]], withdrew the recording in order to be able to reuse some of the musical material in subsequent shows.\n\n===Roles and original cast===\nThe following is a list of the roles in the 1975 musical, with the original cast.<ref name=castlist>{{cite web | url=http://jeeves.alanayckbourn.net/page16/ | title=Jeeves / By Jeeves: Significant Productions | website=Alan Ayckbourn | publisher=Haydonning Ltd | last=Murgatroyd | first=Simon | accessdate=30 October 2019}}</ref>\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bertie Wooster]] \u2013\u00a0[[David Hemmings]]\n* [[Jeeves]] \u2013 [[Michael Aldridge]]\n* [[List of Jeeves characters#Harold \"Stinker\" Pinker|Harold \"Stinker\" Pinker]] \u2013\u00a0[[Gordon Clyde]]\n* [[Gussie Fink-Nottle]] \u2013\u00a0[[Christopher Good]]\n* [[Sir Watkyn Bassett]] \u2013\u00a0[[Bill Wallis]]\n* [[Roderick Spode]] \u2013 [[John Turner (actor)|John Turner]]\n* [[Honoria Glossop]] \u2013\u00a0Angela Easterling\n* [[List of Jeeves characters#Seppings|Seppings]] \u2013\u00a0[[Graham Hamilton]]\n* Ramsay, the parlourmaid \u2013\u00a0Elaine Louden\n* Dawkins, the kitchenmaid \u2013\u00a0Jini Steel \n* [[Madeline Bassett]] \u2013\u00a0[[Gabrielle Drake]]\n* [[List of Jeeves characters#Stephanie \"Stiffy\" Byng|Stiffy Byng]] \u2013\u00a0Debbie Bowen\n* [[Bingo Little]] \u2013\u00a0[[David Wood (actor)|David Wood]]\n* [[Aunt Dahlia]] \u2013 [[Betty Marsden]]*\n* Sharkey, a gardener's boy \u2013\u00a0Peter Kosta\n* Cropper, a gardener's boy \u2013 Brett Forrest\n* [[Drones Club|The Drones Club]] \u2013\u00a0Derek Beard, Bill Boazman, [[John Dicks (actor)|John Dicks]], David Cordwell, Sam Cox, and Terry Wood\n}}\n\nThe list includes Betty Marsden, who was cast as Aunt Dahlia.

A small section of \"Half a Moment\" was cut from the song and reused in [[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|''Sunset Boulevard'']] as part of the song \"As if We Never Said Goodbye\".\n\nThe melody of \"Female of the Species\" appeared earlier than its Jeeves incarnation, with lyrics written and sung by [[Tim Rice]] as \"The Ballad of Robert and Peter\" in 1973 (for private recording purposes).<ref name=\"Andrew Lloyd Webber 2001\">Andrew Lloyd Webber, ''Now & Forever'',(CD boxed set)-liner notes, Polydor Ltd.2001.</ref> \"Travel Hopefully\" is a melody originally written as \"Love Is Here\" for the first ever Lloyd Webber/Rice project, ''[[The Likes of Us]]''.\n\n==1996: ''By Jeeves''==\n\n===Background===\nIn 1996, [[Andrew Lloyd Webber|Lloyd Webber]] and [[Alan Ayckbourn|Ayckbourn]] decided to revisit the show, jettisoning most of the score and the entire original book.   Retitled ''By Jeeves'' (so as to dispel all previous associations with the original production), the character of Roderick Spode and his fascistic intentions were eliminated from the plot.  The character list was whittled down from 22 to 10, and the original orchestrations also underwent a reduction to a little band. Only three songs from the original show remained lyrically intact: \"Banjo Boy\", \"Half a Moment\" and \"Travel Hopefully\".   The other songs and musical interludes were mostly new or reworked compositions by Lloyd Webber.\n\n===Productions===\n''By Jeeves'' re-opened on 1 May 1996 at the [[Stephen Joseph Theatre]]-in-the-round in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire]], an English seaside resort. Audience reaction was generally enthusiastic so the show moved on 2 July 1996 to London for a 12-week season at the fairly intimate [[Duke of York's Theatre]]. The show turned out to be more popular than first thought, and the run was extended to February 1997 with the show moved to [[Lyric Theatre (London)|The Lyric Theatre]] in [[Shaftesbury Avenue]].<ref>[http://www.thisistheatre.com/shows/dukeofyorks144.html \"By Jeeves\" partial listing] thisistheatre.com</ref>\n\n[[Steven Pacey]] played Bertie Wooster and [[Malcolm Sinclair (actor)|Malcolm Sinclair]] played his valet Jeeves.
