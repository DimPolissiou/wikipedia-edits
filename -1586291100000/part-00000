These features and the vehicles employing them may be labeled as ''intelligent'' or ''smart''. A vehicle using automation for difficult tasks, especially navigation, may be referred to as ''semi-autonomous''. A vehicle relying solely on automation is consequently referred to as [[robotic]] or [[Autonomous robot|autonomous]]. After the invention of the [[integrated circuit]], the sophistication of [[automation]] technology increased. Manufacturers and researchers subsequently added a variety of automated functions to automobiles and other vehicles.\n\n==Autonomy levels==\nAutonomy in vehicles is often categorized in six levels: <ref>[https://www.caranddriver.com/features/path-to-autonomy-self-driving-car-levels-0-to-5-explained-feature Path to Autonomy: Self-Driving Car Levels 0 to 5 Explained] - Car and Driver, October 2017</ref> The level system was developed by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3016_201806/|title=Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to Driving Automation Systems for On-Road Motor Vehicles|date=June 15, 2018|website=SAE International|archive-url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Hk2I5OFViegJ:https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3016_201806/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=ca&client=firefox-b-d|archive-date=July 28, 2019|url-status=|access-date=July 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\n* Level 0: No automation.\n* Level 1: Driver assistance - The vehicle can control either steering or speed autonomously in specific circumstances to assist the driver.\n* Level 2: Partial automation - The vehicle can control both steering and speed autonomously in specific circumstances to assist the driver.\n* Level 3: Conditional automation - The vehicle can control both steering and speed autonomously under normal environmental conditions, but requires driver oversight.\n* Level 4: High automation - The vehicle can complete a travel autonomously under normal environmental conditions, not requiring driver oversight.\n* Level 5: Full autonomy - The vehicle can complete a travel autonomously in any environmental conditions.\n\n==Ground vehicles==\n{{Further|Unmanned ground vehicles}}\nGround vehicles employing automation and [[teleoperation]] include shipyard gantries, mining trucks, bomb-disposal robots, robotic insects, and [[driverless tractor]]s.\n\nThere are a lot of autonomous and semi-autonomous ground vehicles being made for the purpose of transporting passengers. One such example is the free-ranging on grid ([[:nl:Free Ranging On Grid|FROG]]) technology which consists of autonomous vehicles, a magnetic track and a supervisory system. The FROG system is deployed for industrial purposes in factory sites and has been in use since 1999 on the [[ParkShuttle]], a [[personal rapid transit|PRT]]-style public transport system in the city of [[Capelle aan den IJssel]] to connect the Rivium business park with the neighboring city of [[Rotterdam]] (where the route terminates at the [[Kralingse Zoom]] metro station). The system experienced a crash in 2005<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wolfstad.com/2005/12/driveless-robot-busses-crash/ |title=Driverless robot buses crash |publisher=Wolfstad.com |date=2005-12-06 |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref> that proved to be caused by a human error.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wolfstad.com/2005/12/driverless-robot-buses-crash-part-2/ |title=Driverless robot buses crash, Part 2 |publisher=Wolfstad.com |date=2005-12-17 |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>\n\nApplications for automation in ground vehicles include the following:\n* [[Vehicle tracking system]] system ESITrack, [[Lojack]]\n* Rear-view alarm, to detect obstacles behind.\n* [[Anti-lock braking system]] (ABS) (also Emergency Braking Assistance ([[Emergency brake assist|EBA]])), often coupled with [[Electronic brake force distribution]] (EBD), which prevents the brakes from locking and losing traction while braking. This shortens stopping distances in most cases and, more importantly, allows the driver to steer the vehicle while braking.\n* [[Traction control system]] (TCS) actuates brakes or reduces throttle to restore traction if driven wheels begin to spin.\n* [[Four wheel drive]] (AWD) with a centre differential. Distributing power to all four wheels lessens the chances of wheel spin. It also suffers less from [[oversteer]] and [[understeer]].\n* [[Electronic Stability Control]] (ESC) (also known for [[Mercedes-Benz]] proprietary Electronic Stability Program (ESP), [[Acceleration Slip Regulation]] (ASR) and Electronic differential lock (EDL)). Uses various sensors to intervene when the car senses a possible loss of control. The car's control unit can reduce power from the engine and even apply the brakes on individual wheels to prevent the car from [[understeer]]ing or [[oversteer]]ing.\n* [[Dynamic steering response]] (DSR) corrects the rate of [[power steering]] system to adapt it to vehicle's speed and road conditions.\n\nResearch is ongoing and prototypes of autonomous ground vehicles exist.\n\n===Cars===\n{{See also|Autonomous car}}\nExtensive automation for cars focuses on either introducing [[robotic cars]] or modifying modern car designs to be semi-autonomous.\n\nSemi-autonomous designs could be implemented sooner as they rely less on technology that is still at the forefront of research. An example is the dual mode monorail. Groups such as [[Dual-mode transit|RUF]] (Denmark) and TriTrack (USA) are working on projects consisting of specialized private cars that are driven manually on normal roads but also that dock onto a monorail/guideway along which they are driven autonomously.\n\nAs a method of automating cars without extensively modifying the cars as much as a [[robotic car]], [[Automated highway system]]s (AHS) aims to construct lanes on highways that would be equipped with, for example, magnets to guide the vehicles. Automation vehicles have auto-brakes named as Auto Vehicles Braking System (AVBS). Highway computers would manage the traffic and direct the cars to avoid crashes.\n\nThe [[European Commission]] has established a smart car development program called the ''Intelligent Car Flagship Initiative''.<ref>[http://auto.ihs.com/news/eu-en-intelligent-cars-faq.htm IHS Automotive News, February 23, 2006, accessed October 9, 2006]</ref>  The goals of that program include:\n\n* [[Adaptive cruise control]]\n* [[Lane departure warning system]]\n* Project AWAKE for drowsy drivers\n\nThere are plenty of further uses for automation in relation to cars. These include:\n\n* [[Assured Clear Distance Ahead]]\n* [[Headlamp#Advanced front-lighting system (AFS)|Adaptive headlamps]]\n* [[Advanced Automatic Collision Notification]], such as [[OnStar]]\n* [[Intelligent Parking Assist System]]\n* [[Automatic Parking]]\n* [[Automotive night vision]] with pedestrian detection\n* [[Blind spot monitoring]]\n* [[Driver Monitoring System]]\n* [[Robotic car]] or self-driving car which may result in less-stressed \"drivers\", higher efficiency (the driver can do something else), increased safety and less [[pollution]] (e.g. via completely automated [[gasoline|fuel]] control)\n* [[Precrash system]]\n* [[Assured Clear Distance Ahead|Safe speed governing]]\n* [[Traffic sign recognition]]\n* Following another car on a motorway \u2013 \"enhanced\" or \"adaptive\" cruise control, as used by Ford and Vauxhall<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/news/autoexpressnews/62349/vauxhall_vectra.html |title=Vauxhall Vectra &#124; Auto Express News &#124; News |magazine=Auto Express |date=2005-11-29 |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>\n* Distance control assist \u2013 as developed by Nissan<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/NEWS/2006/_STORY/060315-01-e.html |title=Nissan &#124; News Press Release |publisher=Nissan-global.com |date=2006-03-15 |accessdate=2011-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027124358/http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/NEWS/2006/_STORY/060315-01-e.html |archive-date=2011-10-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* [[Dead man's switch]] \u2013 there is a move to introduce [[deadman's braking]] into automotive application, primarily heavy vehicles, and there may also be a need to add [[penalty switch]]es to [[cruise control]]s.\n\nSingapore also announced a set of provisional national standards on January 31, 2019, to guide the autonomous vehicle industry. The standards, known as Technical Reference 68 (TR68), will promote the safe deployment of fully driverless vehicles in Singapore, according to a joint press release by Enterprise Singapore (ESG), Land Transport Authority (LTA), Standards Development Organisation and Singapore Standards Council (SSC).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/singapore-driverless-vehicle-autonomous-national-standards-11190498|title=Singapore\u2019s driverless vehicle ambitions reach next milestone with new national standards|website=Channel NewsAsia|language=en|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref>\n\n===Shared autonomous vehicles===\nFollowing recent developments in autonomous cars, shared autonomous vehicles are now able to run in ordinary traffic without the need for embedded guidance markers.  So far the focus has been on low speed, {{convert|20|mph|kph}}, with short, fixed routes for the \"last mile\" of journeys.  This means issues of collision avoidance and safety are significantly less challenging than those for automated cars, which seek to match the performance of conventional vehicles.  Aside from 2getthere (\"[[ParkShuttle]]\"), three companies - [[Ligier]] (\"[[Ligier EZ10|Easymile EZ10]]\"), [http://navya.tech/ Navya] (\"ARMA\" & \"Autonom Cab\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Navya unveils autonomous taxi|url=https://smartcitiesworld.net/news/news/navya-unveils-autonomous-taxi-2284|accessdate=13 November 2017|date=November 9, 2017}}</ref>) and RDM Group (\"[[LUTZ Pathfinder]]\") - are manufacturing and actively testing such vehicles.  Two other companies have produced prototypes, [[Local Motors]] (\"Olli\") and the [https://gateway-project.org.uk/ GATEway project].\n\nBeside these efforts, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] is reportedly developing an autonomous shuttle, based on a vehicle from an existing automaker, to transfer employees between its offices in Palo Alto and [[Infinite Loop (street)|Infinite Loop]], Cupertino.

At the same time, some companies like Starsky, are aiming for Level 3 Autonomy, which would see the driver playing a control role around the truck's environment. The company's project, remote truck driving, would give truck drivers a greater work-life balance, enabling them to avoid long periods away from their home. This would however provoke a potential mismatch between the driver's skills with the technological redefinition of the job.\n\nCompanies that buy driverless trucks could massively cut down on costs: human drivers will no longer be required, companies' liabilities due to truck accidents will diminish, and productivity will increase (as the driverless truck doesn't need to rest). The usage of self driving trucks will go hand in hand with the use of real-time data to optimize both efficiency and productivity of the service delivered, as a way to tackle traffic congestion for example. Driverless trucks could enable new business models that would see deliveries shift from day time to night time or time slots in which traffic is less heavily dense.\n\n==== Waymo Semi ====\nIn March 2018, [[Waymo]], the automated vehicle company spun off from [[Google]] parent company [[Alphabet Inc.]], announced it was applying its technology to semi trucks.

The company is based in San Francisco. {{cite news|title=Silicon Valley's Levandowski returns with self-driving truck start-up|url=https://www.ft.com/content/9ea9c332-02de-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1|date=December 18, 2018|newspaper=Financial Times}}</ref>\n\n===Drones===\nAlso see [[Delivery drone|Delivery Drone]].\n\nA few experiments have been undergone to develop delivery drones for various industries, including packages and food. Innovation is driving this very young market and sees traditional transportation companies compete with start-ups, governments and technological companies like Amazon, for whom delivery is central to its growth strategy.\n\nHowever, even if technology seems to allow for those solutions to function correctly as various tests of various companies show, the main throwback to the market launch and use of such drones is inevitably the legislation in place and regulatory agencies have to decide on the framework they wish to take to draft regulation. This process is in different phases across the world as each country will tackle the topic independently. For example, Iceland's government and departments of transport, aviation, police have already started issuing licenses for drone operations. It has a permissive approach and together with Costa Rica, Italy, the UAE, Sweden and Norway, has a fairly unrestricted legislation on commercial drone use. Those countries are characterized by a body of regulation that may give operational guidelines or require licensing, registration and insurance.<ref>{{cite web|title=International Commercial Drone Regulation and Drone Delivery Services|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1700/RR1718z3/RAND_RR1718z3.pdf|website=RAND}}</ref>\n\nOn the other side, other countries have decided to ban, either directly (outright ban) or indirectly (effective ban), the use of commercial drones. The RAND Corporation thus makes the difference between countries forbidding drones and those that  have a formal process for commercial drone licensing, but requirements are either impossible to meet or licenses do not appear to have been approved.\n\nHowever, most countries seem to be struggling on the integration of drones for commercial uses into their aviation regulatory frameworks. Thus, constraints are placed on the use of those drones such as that they must be operating within the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the pilot and thus limiting their potential range. This would be the case of the Netherlands and Belgium. Most countries do let pilot operate outside the VLOS but is subject to restrictions and pilot ratings, which would be the case of the US. \n\nThe general trend is that legislation is moving fast and laws are constantly being reevaluated. Countries are moving towards a more permissive approach but the industry still lacks infrastructures to ensure the success of such a transition. To provide safety and efficiency, specialized training courses, pilot exams (type of UAV and flying conditions) as well as liability management measures regarding insurances have to be developed.\n\nThere is a sense of urgency that breathes from this innovation as competition is high and companies lobby to integrate them rapidly in their products and services offerings. Since June 2017, the US Senate legislation reauthorized the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Transportation to create a carrier certificate allowing for package deliveries by drones.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bill S. 1405|url=https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/0be741be-c332-47a5-ab62-3edb4f966d22/1D2EF027AE2DDF838BA2C11FF06F00CF.highlights---faa.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Trains===\n{{main|Automatic train operation}}\n\nThe concept for autonomous vehicles has also been applied for commercial uses, like for autonomous trains.

They are most often used in industrial applications to move materials around a manufacturing facility or warehouse. Application of the automatic guided vehicle has broadened during the late 20th century.\n\n==Aircraft==\n{{Main|Unmanned aerial vehicle}}\nAircraft has received much attention for automation, especially for navigation. A system capable of autonomously navigating a vehicle (especially aircraft) is known as [[autopilot]].\n\n==Watercraft==\n{{main|Unmanned surface vehicle}}\nAutonomous boats can provide security, do research, or perform hazardous or repetitive tasks (such as guiding a large ship into a harbor or transporting cargo).\n\n==Submersibles==\n{{main|Autonomous underwater vehicle}}\nUnderwater vehicles have been a focus for automation for tasks such as pipeline inspection and underwater mapping.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dashcam]]\n* [[Intelligent speed adaptation]]\n* [[Intelligent Transportation System]]\n* [[PReVENT]]\n* [[Robo-Taxi]]\n* [[Transit media]]\n* [[Uncrewed vehicle]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/intelligentcar/index_en.htm European Commission Intelligent Car website]\n* [http://www.its.dot.gov/automated_vehicle/index.htm U.S. Department of Transportation - Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office website]\n\n[[Category:Unmanned ground vehicles]]\n[[Category:Automotive safety]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|vehicles relying completely on automation|Uncrewed vehicle}}\n{{redirect|intelligent car|the European Commission policy|Intelligent Car Initiative}}\n\n[[File:The ESA Seeker autonomous rover during tests at Paranal.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[ESA]] Seeker autonomous rover during tests at [[Paranal Observatory|Paranal]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Self-steering Mars Rover tested at ESO\u2019s Paranal Observatory|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann12048/|accessdate=21 June 2012|newspaper=ESO Announcement}}</ref> ]]\n\n'''Vehicular automation''' involves the use of [[mechatronics]], [[artificial intelligence]], and [[multi-agent system]] to assist a [[driver (person)|vehicle's operator]]. These features and the vehicles employing them may be labeled as ''intelligent'' or ''smart''. A vehicle using automation for difficult tasks, especially navigation, may be referred to as ''semi-autonomous''. A vehicle relying solely on automation is consequently referred to as [[robotic]] or [[Autonomous robot|autonomous]]. After the invention of the [[integrated circuit]], the sophistication of [[automation]] technology increased. Manufacturers and researchers subsequently added a variety of automated functions to automobiles and other vehicles.\n\n==Autonomy levels==\nAutonomy in vehicles is often categorized in six levels: <ref>[https://www.caranddriver.com/features/path-to-autonomy-self-driving-car-levels-0-to-5-explained-feature Path to Autonomy: Self-Driving Car Levels 0 to 5 Explained] - Car and Driver, October 2017</ref> The level system was developed by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3016_201806/|title=Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to Driving Automation Systems for On-Road Motor Vehicles|date=June 15, 2018|website=SAE International|archive-url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Hk2I5OFViegJ:https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3016_201806/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=ca&client=firefox-b-d|archive-date=July 28, 2019|url-status=|access-date=July 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\n* Level 0: No automation.\n* Level 1: Driver assistance - The vehicle can control either steering or speed autonomously in specific circumstances to assist the driver.\n* Level 2: Partial automation - The vehicle can control both steering and speed autonomously in specific circumstances to assist the driver.\n* Level 3: Conditional automation - The vehicle can control both steering and speed autonomously under normal environmental conditions, but requires driver oversight.\n* Level 4: High automation - The vehicle can complete a travel autonomously under normal environmental conditions, not requiring driver oversight.\n* Level 5: Full autonomy - The vehicle can complete a travel autonomously in any environmental conditions.\n\n==Ground vehicles==\n{{Further|Unmanned ground vehicles}}\nGround vehicles employing automation and [[teleoperation]] include shipyard gantries, mining trucks, bomb-disposal robots, robotic insects, and [[driverless tractor]]s.\n\nThere are a lot of autonomous and semi-autonomous ground vehicles being made for the purpose of transporting passengers. One such example is the free-ranging on grid ([[:nl:Free Ranging On Grid|FROG]]) technology which consists of autonomous vehicles, a magnetic track and a supervisory system. The FROG system is deployed for industrial purposes in factory sites and has been in use since 1999 on the [[ParkShuttle]], a [[personal rapid transit|PRT]]-style public transport system in the city of [[Capelle aan den IJssel]] to connect the Rivium business park with the neighboring city of [[Rotterdam]] (where the route terminates at the [[Kralingse Zoom]] metro station).

This shortens stopping distances in most cases and, more importantly, allows the driver to steer the vehicle while braking.\n* [[Traction control system]] (TCS) actuates brakes or reduces throttle to restore traction if driven wheels begin to spin.\n* [[Four wheel drive]] (AWD) with a centre differential. Distributing power to all four wheels lessens the chances of wheel spin. It also suffers less from [[oversteer]] and [[understeer]].\n* [[Electronic Stability Control]] (ESC) (also known for [[Mercedes-Benz]] proprietary Electronic Stability Program (ESP), [[Acceleration Slip Regulation]] (ASR) and Electronic differential lock (EDL)). Uses various sensors to intervene when the car senses a possible loss of control. The car's control unit can reduce power from the engine and even apply the brakes on individual wheels to prevent the car from [[understeer]]ing or [[oversteer]]ing.\n* [[Dynamic steering response]] (DSR) corrects the rate of [[power steering]] system to adapt it to vehicle's speed and road conditions.\n\nResearch is ongoing and prototypes of autonomous ground vehicles exist.\n\n===Cars===\n{{See also|Autonomous car}}\nExtensive automation for cars focuses on either introducing [[robotic cars]] or modifying modern car designs to be semi-autonomous.\n\nSemi-autonomous designs could be implemented sooner as they rely less on technology that is still at the forefront of research. An example is the dual mode monorail. Groups such as [[Dual-mode transit|RUF]] (Denmark) and TriTrack (USA) are working on projects consisting of specialized private cars that are driven manually on normal roads but also that dock onto a monorail/guideway along which they are driven autonomously.\n\nAs a method of automating cars without extensively modifying the cars as much as a [[robotic car]], [[Automated highway system]]s (AHS) aims to construct lanes on highways that would be equipped with, for example, magnets to guide the vehicles. Automation vehicles have auto-brakes named as Auto Vehicles Braking System (AVBS). Highway computers would manage the traffic and direct the cars to avoid crashes.\n\nThe [[European Commission]] has established a smart car development program called the ''Intelligent Car Flagship Initiative''.<ref>[http://auto.ihs.com/news/eu-en-intelligent-cars-faq.htm IHS Automotive News, February 23, 2006, accessed October 9, 2006]</ref>  The goals of that program include:\n\n* [[Adaptive cruise control]]\n* [[Lane departure warning system]]\n* Project AWAKE for drowsy drivers\n\nThere are plenty of further uses for automation in relation to cars.

The standards, known as Technical Reference 68 (TR68), will promote the safe deployment of fully driverless vehicles in Singapore, according to a joint press release by Enterprise Singapore (ESG), Land Transport Authority (LTA), Standards Development Organisation and Singapore Standards Council (SSC).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/singapore-driverless-vehicle-autonomous-national-standards-11190498|title=Singapore\u2019s driverless vehicle ambitions reach next milestone with new national standards|website=Channel NewsAsia|language=en|access-date=2019-02-02}}</ref>\n\n===Shared autonomous vehicles===\nFollowing recent developments in autonomous cars, shared autonomous vehicles are now able to run in ordinary traffic without the need for embedded guidance markers.  So far the focus has been on low speed, {{convert|20|mph|kph}}, with short, fixed routes for the \"last mile\" of journeys.  This means issues of collision avoidance and safety are significantly less challenging than those for automated cars, which seek to match the performance of conventional vehicles.

At the same time, some companies like Starsky, are aiming for Level 3 Autonomy, which would see the driver playing a control role around the truck's environment. The company's project, remote truck driving, would give truck drivers a greater work-life balance, enabling them to avoid long periods away from their home. This would however provoke a potential mismatch between the driver's skills with the technological redefinition of the job.\n\nCompanies that buy driverless trucks could massively cut down on costs: human drivers will no longer be required, companies' liabilities due to truck accidents will diminish, and productivity will increase (as the driverless truck doesn't need to rest). The usage of self driving trucks will go hand in hand with the use of real-time data to optimize both efficiency and productivity of the service delivered, as a way to tackle traffic congestion for example. Driverless trucks could enable new business models that would see deliveries shift from day time to night time or time slots in which traffic is less heavily dense.\n\n==== Waymo Semi ====\nIn March 2018, [[Waymo]], the automated vehicle company spun off from [[Google]] parent company [[Alphabet Inc.]], announced it was applying its technology to semi trucks.

The company is based in San Francisco. {{cite news|title=Silicon Valley's Levandowski returns with self-driving truck start-up|url=https://www.ft.com/content/9ea9c332-02de-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1|date=December 18, 2018|newspaper=Financial Times}}</ref>\n\n===Drones===\nAlso see [[Delivery drone|Delivery Drone]].\n\nA few experiments have been undergone to develop delivery drones for various industries, including packages and food. Innovation is driving this very young market and sees traditional transportation companies compete with start-ups, governments and technological companies like Amazon, for whom delivery is central to its growth strategy.\n\nHowever, even if technology seems to allow for those solutions to function correctly as various tests of various companies show, the main throwback to the market launch and use of such drones is inevitably the legislation in place and regulatory agencies have to decide on the framework they wish to take to draft regulation. This process is in different phases across the world as each country will tackle the topic independently. For example, Iceland's government and departments of transport, aviation, police have already started issuing licenses for drone operations. It has a permissive approach and together with Costa Rica, Italy, the UAE, Sweden and Norway, has a fairly unrestricted legislation on commercial drone use. Those countries are characterized by a body of regulation that may give operational guidelines or require licensing, registration and insurance.<ref>{{cite web|title=International Commercial Drone Regulation and Drone Delivery Services|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1700/RR1718z3/RAND_RR1718z3.pdf|website=RAND}}</ref>\n\nOn the other side, other countries have decided to ban, either directly (outright ban) or indirectly (effective ban), the use of commercial drones. The RAND Corporation thus makes the difference between countries forbidding drones and those that  have a formal process for commercial drone licensing, but requirements are either impossible to meet or licenses do not appear to have been approved.\n\nHowever, most countries seem to be struggling on the integration of drones for commercial uses into their aviation regulatory frameworks. Thus, constraints are placed on the use of those drones such as that they must be operating within the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the pilot and thus limiting their potential range. This would be the case of the Netherlands and Belgium. Most countries do let pilot operate outside the VLOS but is subject to restrictions and pilot ratings, which would be the case of the US. \n\nThe general trend is that legislation is moving fast and laws are constantly being reevaluated. Countries are moving towards a more permissive approach but the industry still lacks infrastructures to ensure the success of such a transition. To provide safety and efficiency, specialized training courses, pilot exams (type of UAV and flying conditions) as well as liability management measures regarding insurances have to be developed.\n\nThere is a sense of urgency that breathes from this innovation as competition is high and companies lobby to integrate them rapidly in their products and services offerings. Since June 2017, the US Senate legislation reauthorized the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Transportation to create a carrier certificate allowing for package deliveries by drones.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bill S. 1405|url=https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/0be741be-c332-47a5-ab62-3edb4f966d22/1D2EF027AE2DDF838BA2C11FF06F00CF.highlights---faa.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Trains===\n{{main|Automatic train operation}}\n\nThe concept for autonomous vehicles has also been applied for commercial uses, like for autonomous trains.

They also perform in public at taverns, nightclubs, and block parties.<ref name=\"Zemon, Stacy 2002\"/>\n \nBusiness models for mobile disc jockeys include full-time, part-time, multi-operator, and single-operator companies.<ref name=\"Zemon, Stacy 2002\">Zemon, Stacy.  ''The Mobile DJ Handbook: How to Start & Run a Profitable Mobile Disc Jockey Service'', Second Edition.  St. Louis:  Focal Press, 2002.</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe concept of mobile discos started in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1966, when Roger Squire began an entertainment service in North [[London]] named \"Roger Squire's Mobile Discoth\u00e8ques\". The word ''discoth\u00e8que'' is French for \"disco\". Within two years, Squire had fifteen mobile discoth\u00e8ques performing approximately sixty functions each week. He performed at events attended by celebrities and royalty, at countless college dances, wedding receptions, and all kinds of social events. Over the next few years, many copycat \"Mobile Discos\" started to emulate his successful formula. During this period, London got its \"[[Swinging London]]\" reputation. Squire later set up a disco equipment supply service that sold disco sound and lighting systems to budding DJs, both in the United Kingdom and abroad.<ref>Gilbert, Jerry 1983 \"The Beginning\" Disco International & Club News (UK Magazine), August edition, pages 49 \u2013 56.</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, mobile DJs began to form associations and create professional business networks that evolved into annual trade shows and internet discussion forums. The early 1990s saw the emergence of organized professional trade shows such as the \"Mobile Beat Show\" in [[Las Vegas]], Nevada, and the \"DJ Times Expo\" in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], New Jersey. Seminars by numerous respected DJs such as John Rozz, Ray \"Ray Mar\" Martinez, Stacy Zemon, Mark Ferrell, [[Peter Merry]], Randy Bartlett, and Steve Moody{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} have helped DJs to better understand their profession, how to be more professional and to treat being a DJ as a business operation.\n\n1991 saw the publication of ''Mobile Beat'', a magazine geared specifically toward mobile DJs. In 1992, the [[Moving Picture Experts Group]] (MPEG), released The MPEG-1 file standard, designed to produce reasonable sound from a digital file using minimal storage. The lossy compression scheme MPEG-1 Layer-3, popularly known as [[MP3]], later revolutionized the digital music domain.\n\nIn 1998, [[Final Scratch]] debuted at the BE Developer Conference, marking the first digital DJ system to give DJs control of MP3 files through special time-coded vinyl records or CDs. While it would take some time for this novel concept to catch on with the \"die hard\" vinyl-oriented DJs, it was the first step in the new digital DJ revolution. Manufacturers joined with computer DJ pioneers to offer professional endorsements, the first being \"Professor Jam\", also known as William P. Rader, who went on to develop the industry's first dedicated computer DJ convention and learning program, the \"Computerized Performance System\" (CPS) known as \"DJ Summit\", which helped spread the word about the advantages of this emerging technology.\n\nThe American Disc Jockey Awards Show was established, and its first edition was held in Las Vegas, Nevada. Since then, thirteen mobile DJs have been elected to the American Disc Jockey Hall of Fame. The thirteen members include John Rozz, Al Lampkin, Joe Martin, Robert A. Lindquist, Jon Michaels, Mike Buonaccorso, Sid Vanderpool, Bobby Morganstein, John Roberts, Ken Knotts, Ray \"Ray Mar\" Martinez, Cesar Cosio, and Bernie Howard-Fryman.<ref>Mobile Beat Magazine May 2006 Issue Page 48</ref>\n\nThe American Disc Jockey Awards Show annually recognizes and honors individuals who have given of themselves to benefit their community or a charitable cause in the name of the ADJA or the DJ Trade as a whole. <!-- Known as the Michael Butler Humanitarian Award, recipients include the following:<br />\n1998 \u2013 Mark \u201cPeace\u201d Thomas<br />\n1999 \u2013 Ray Martinez<br />\n2000 \u2013 Professor Jam (aka William P.

KoKoruz, Shawn \"Big Daddy\" McKee, Marz Lawhorn, Gerry Siracusa, Adam Weitz, Steve Moody and Pascal Levesque who, in 2013, was the first Canadian to take part in the competition. Pascal Levesque from Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, was named \"DJ of the Year Runner-Up\" and won the \"Best Dance\" award.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n==Developments==\nA number of books have been written about the business, and by furthering their education at trade shows and seminars, mobile DJs have gained a positive public perception. In the 1970s Mobile DJs were averaging $350\u2013500 per four-hour event; now a wedding reception can cost between $800\u20132,500 per event, with the national average being around $1,038.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xogroupinc.com/press-releases-home/2014-press-releases/2014-03-27-real-weddings-study-average-cost-of-wedding.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620151633/http://www.xogroupinc.com/press-releases-home/2014-press-releases/2014-03-27-real-weddings-study-average-cost-of-wedding.aspx |archivedate=2014-06-20 |df= }}</ref>\n\nWhile many club disc jockeys still use traditional vinyl records, many mobile DJs also currently use [[compact disc]]s, computer-based files (such as [[MP3]]s), or a combination of sources. In addition, professional-grade equipment created by a variety of companies expressly for the mobile DJ industry has allowed for faster set-up and break down times and improved quality of performance.<ref name=\"Graudins, Charles A. 2004\">Graudins, Charles A. \"How to Be a DJ''.

The word ''discoth\u00e8que'' is French for \"disco\". Within two years, Squire had fifteen mobile discoth\u00e8ques performing approximately sixty functions each week. He performed at events attended by celebrities and royalty, at countless college dances, wedding receptions, and all kinds of social events. Over the next few years, many copycat \"Mobile Discos\" started to emulate his successful formula. During this period, London got its \"[[Swinging London]]\" reputation. Squire later set up a disco equipment supply service that sold disco sound and lighting systems to budding DJs, both in the United Kingdom and abroad.<ref>Gilbert, Jerry 1983 \"The Beginning\" Disco International & Club News (UK Magazine), August edition, pages 49 \u2013 56.</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, mobile DJs began to form associations and create professional business networks that evolved into annual trade shows and internet discussion forums. The early 1990s saw the emergence of organized professional trade shows such as the \"Mobile Beat Show\" in [[Las Vegas]], Nevada, and the \"DJ Times Expo\" in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], New Jersey. Seminars by numerous respected DJs such as John Rozz, Ray \"Ray Mar\" Martinez, Stacy Zemon, Mark Ferrell, [[Peter Merry]], Randy Bartlett, and Steve Moody{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} have helped DJs to better understand their profession, how to be more professional and to treat being a DJ as a business operation.\n\n1991 saw the publication of ''Mobile Beat'', a magazine geared specifically toward mobile DJs. In 1992, the [[Moving Picture Experts Group]] (MPEG), released The MPEG-1 file standard, designed to produce reasonable sound from a digital file using minimal storage. The lossy compression scheme MPEG-1 Layer-3, popularly known as [[MP3]], later revolutionized the digital music domain.\n\nIn 1998, [[Final Scratch]] debuted at the BE Developer Conference, marking the first digital DJ system to give DJs control of MP3 files through special time-coded vinyl records or CDs. While it would take some time for this novel concept to catch on with the \"die hard\" vinyl-oriented DJs, it was the first step in the new digital DJ revolution. Manufacturers joined with computer DJ pioneers to offer professional endorsements, the first being \"Professor Jam\", also known as William P. Rader, who went on to develop the industry's first dedicated computer DJ convention and learning program, the \"Computerized Performance System\" (CPS) known as \"DJ Summit\", which helped spread the word about the advantages of this emerging technology.\n\nThe American Disc Jockey Awards Show was established, and its first edition was held in Las Vegas, Nevada. Since then, thirteen mobile DJs have been elected to the American Disc Jockey Hall of Fame. The thirteen members include John Rozz, Al Lampkin, Joe Martin, Robert A. Lindquist, Jon Michaels, Mike Buonaccorso, Sid Vanderpool, Bobby Morganstein, John Roberts, Ken Knotts, Ray \"Ray Mar\" Martinez, Cesar Cosio, and Bernie Howard-Fryman.<ref>Mobile Beat Magazine May 2006 Issue Page 48</ref>\n\nThe American Disc Jockey Awards Show annually recognizes and honors individuals who have given of themselves to benefit their community or a charitable cause in the name of the ADJA or the DJ Trade as a whole. <!-- Known as the Michael Butler Humanitarian Award, recipients include the following:<br />\n1998 \u2013 Mark \u201cPeace\u201d Thomas<br />\n1999 \u2013 Ray Martinez<br />\n2000 \u2013 Professor Jam (aka William P.

[[The Great Game]] saw the rise of systematic espionage and surveillance throughout the region by both powers]]\nModern tactics of espionage and dedicated government intelligence agencies developed over the course of the late-19th century. A key background to this development was [[The Great Game]] - the strategic rivalry and conflict between the British Empire and the Russian Empire throughout [[Central Asia]] between 1830 and 1895. To counter Russian ambitions in the region and the potential threat it posed to the British position in [[British India|India]], the [[Indian Civil Service]] built up a system of surveillance, intelligence and counterintelligence. The existence of this shadowy conflict was popularized in [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s famous [[espionage fiction|spy book]], ''[[Kim (novel)|Kim]]'' (1901), where he portrayed the Great Game (a phrase Kipling popularized) as an espionage and intelligence conflict that \"never ceases, day or night\".<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=D3KIwYA_QyAC|title= Intelligence and Government in Britain and the United States: A Comparative Perspective|author= Philip H.J. Davies|year= 2012|publisher= ABC-CLIO}}</ref>\n\nThe establishment of dedicated intelligence and counterintelligence organizations had much to do with the colonial rivalries between the major European powers and to the accelerating development of military technology. As espionage became more widely used, it became imperative to expand the role of existing police and internal security forces into a role of detecting and countering foreign spies. The ''[[Evidenzbureau]]'' (founded in the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1850) had the role from the late-19th century of countering the actions of the [[Pan Slavism|Pan-Slavist movement]] operating out of [[Serbia]].\n\nAfter the fallout from the [[Dreyfus Affair]] of 1894\u20131906 in France, responsibility for French military counter-espionage passed in 1899 to the [[S\u00fbret\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale]]\u2014an agency originally responsible for order enforcement and public safety\u2014and overseen by the [[Ministry of the Interior]].<ref>[http://www.aassdn.org/hsvEXhis01.html Anciens des Services Sp\u00e9ciaux de la D\u00e9fense Nationale] ( France )</ref>\n\n[[Image:Okhranka group photo.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The [[Okhrana]], founded in 1880, had the task of countering enemy espionage against [[Imperial Russia]].

It set up a branch in [[Paris]], run by [[Pyotr Rachkovsky]], to monitor their activities. The agency used many methods to achieve its goals, including [[covert operations]], [[undercover agent]]s, and \"perlustration\"\u2014the interception and reading of private correspondence. The Okhrana became notorious for its use of [[agent provocateur|agents provocateurs]], who often succeeded in penetrating the activities of revolutionary groups - including the [[Bolsheviks]].<ref>Ian D. Thatcher, Late Imperial Russia: problems and prospects, page 50.</ref>\n\nIntegrated counterintelligence agencies run directly by governments were also established. The British government founded the [[Secret Intelligence Service|Secret Service Bureau]] in 1909 as the first independent and interdepartmental agency fully in control over all government counterintelligence activities.\n\nDue to intense lobbying from [[William Melville]] and after he obtained German mobilization plans and proof of their financial support to the [[Boer]]s, the British government authorized the formation of a new intelligence section in the [[War Office]], MO3 (subsequently redesignated M05) headed by Melville, in 1903. Working under-cover from a flat in London, Melville ran both counterintelligence and foreign intelligence operations, capitalizing on the knowledge and foreign contacts he had accumulated during his years running [[Special Branch]].\n\nDue to its success, the Government Committee on Intelligence, with support from [[Richard Haldane]] and [[Winston Churchill]], established the Secret Service Bureau in 1909 as a joint initiative of the [[Admiralty]], the [[War Office]] and the [[Foreign Office]] to control secret intelligence operations in the UK and overseas, particularly concentrating on the activities of the [[Imperial Germany|Imperial German]] government. Its first director was [[Mansfield Smith-Cumming|Captain Sir George Mansfield Smith-Cumming]] alias \"C\".<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.sis.gov.uk/output/sis-or-mi6-what-s-in-a-name.html |title= SIS Or MI6.

Instead of a system whereby rival departments and military services would work on their own priorities with little to no consultation or cooperation with each other, the newly established [[Secret Intelligence Service]] was interdepartmental, and submitted its intelligence reports to all relevant government departments.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9TXJAwAAQBAJ\n|title= Empire of Secrets: British Intelligence, the Cold War, and the Twilight of Empire\n|author= Calder Walton|year= 2013\n|publisher= Overlook|pages = 5\u20136\n}}\n</ref>\n\nFor the first time, governments had access to peacetime, centralized independent intelligence and counterintelligence bureaucracy with indexed registries and defined procedures, as opposed to the more ''[[ad hoc]]'' methods used previously.\n\n== Categories ==\n'''Collective counterintelligence''' is gaining information about an opponent's intelligence collection capabilities whose aim is at an entity.<br>\n\n'''Defensive counterintelligence''' is thwarting efforts by hostile intelligence services to penetrate the service.<br>\n\n'''Offensive counterintelligence''' is having identified an opponent's efforts against the system, trying to manipulate these attacks by either \"turning\" the opponent's agents into double agents or feeding them false information to report.<ref>Lowenthal, M.

Washington, DC: CQ Press.</ref>\n\n==Counterintelligence, counterterror, and government==\nMany governments organize counterintelligence agencies separately and distinct from their intelligence collection services. In most countries the counterintelligence mission is spread over multiple organizations, though one usually predominates. There is usually a domestic counterintelligence service, usually part of a larger [[law enforcement organization]] such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] in the [[United States]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe [[United Kingdom]] has the separate [[MI5|Security Service]], also known as MI5, which does not have direct police powers but works closely with law enforcement especially [[Special Branch]] that can carry out arrests, do searches with a warrant, etc.\n\nThe [[Russian Federation]]'s major domestic security organization is the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]], which principally came from the Second Chief Directorate and [[Military counterintelligence of the Soviet Army|Third Chief Directorate]] of the USSR's [[KGB]].\n\n[[Canada]] separates the functions of general defensive counterintelligence (''contre-ing\u00e9rence''), security intelligence (the intelligence preparation necessary to conduct offensive counterintelligence), law enforcement intelligence, and offensive counterintelligence.\n\nMilitary organizations have their own counterintelligence forces, capable of conducting protective operations both at home and when deployed abroad.<ref name=\"auto\">Clark, R.M. and Mitchell, W.L., 2018. Deception: Counterdeception and Counterintelligence. CQ Press.</ref> Depending on the country, there can be various mixtures of civilian and military in foreign operations. For example, while [[#Offensive counterintelligence operations|offensive counterintelligence]] is a mission of the US [[CIA]]'s [[National Clandestine Service]], [[#Defensive counterintelligence|defensive counterintelligence]] is a mission of the [[Diplomatic Security Service|U.S. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), Department of State]], who work on protective security for personnel and information processed abroad at US Embassies and Consulates.<ref>{{cite web\n | title = Counterintelligence Investigations\n | url = https://2009-2017.state.gov/m/ds/terrorism/c8653.htm\n | accessdate = 2008-05-08\n}}</ref>\n\nThe term counter-espionage is really specific to countering [[HUMINT]], but, since virtually all offensive counterintelligence involves exploiting human sources, the term \"offensive counterintelligence\" is used here to avoid some ambiguous phrasing.\n\nOther countries also deal with the proper organization of defenses against Foreign Intelligence Services (FIS), often with separate services with no common authority below the head of government.\n\n[[France]], for example, builds its domestic counterterror in a law enforcement framework. In France, a senior anti-terror magistrate is in charge of defense against terrorism. French magistrates have multiple functions that overlap US and UK functions of investigators, prosecutors, and judges. An anti-terror magistrate may call upon France's domestic intelligence service ''[[Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 int\u00e9rieure]]'' (DGSI), which may work with the ''[[Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ext\u00e9rieure]]'' (DGSE), foreign intelligence service.\n\n[[Spain]] gives its Interior Ministry, with military support, the leadership in domestic counterterrorism. For international threats, the National Intelligence Center (CNI) has responsibility. CNI, which reports directly to the Prime Minister, is staffed principally by which is subordinated directly to the Prime Minister's office. After the March 11, [[2004 Madrid train bombings]], the national investigation found problems between the Interior Ministry and CNI, and, as a result, the National Anti-Terrorism Coordination Center was created. Spain's 3/11 Commission called for this Center to do operational coordination as well as information collection and dissemination.<ref name=Archick>{{cite web\n | title = European Approaches to Homeland Security and Counterterrorism\n | url = https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/RL33573.pdf\n | first = Kristen\n | last  = Archick\n | publisher = Congressional Research Service\n | date = 2006-07-24\n | accessdate = 2007-11-05\n|format=PDF}}</ref> The military has organic counterintelligence to meet specific military needs.\n\n== Counterintelligence missions ==\n[[Frank Wisner]], a well-known CIA operations executive said of the autobiography of Director of Central Intelligence [[Allen W.

Threats have broadened to include threats from non-national or trans-national groups, including internal insurgents, organized crime, and transnational based groups (often called \"terrorists\", but that is limiting). Still, the FIS term remains the usual way of referring to the threat against which counterintelligence protects.\n\nIn modern practice, several missions are associated with counterintelligence from the national to the field level.\n* Defensive analysis is the practice of looking for vulnerabilities in one's own organization, and, with due regard for risk versus benefit, closing the discovered holes.\n* Offensive counterespionage is the set of techniques that at least neutralizes discovered FIS personnel and arrests them or, in the case of diplomats, expels them by declaring them [[persona non grata]]. Beyond that minimum, it exploits FIS personnel to gain intelligence for one's own side, or actively manipulates the FIS personnel to damage the hostile FIS organization.\n* Counterintelligence force protection source operations (CFSO) are human source operations, conducted abroad that are intended to fill the existing gap in national-level coverage in protecting a field station or force from terrorism and espionage.\n\nCounterintelligence is part of [[intelligence cycle security]], which, in turn, is part of [[intelligence cycle management]]. A variety of security disciplines also fall under intelligence security management and complement counterintelligence, including:\n* [[Physical security]]\n* [[Intelligence cycle security#Personnel security|Personnel security]]\n* [[Communications security]] (COMSEC)\n* [[Information security|Informations system security]] (INFOSEC)\n* [[Classified information|security classification]]\n* [[Operations security]] (OPSEC)\n\nThe disciplines involved in \"positive security,\" measures by which one's own society collects information on its actual or potential security, complement security. For example, when communications intelligence identifies a particular radio transmitter as one used only by a particular country, detecting that transmitter inside one's own country suggests the presence of a spy that counterintelligence should target. In particular, counterintelligence has a significant relationship with the collection discipline of [[HUMINT]] and at least some relationship with the others. Counterintelligence can both produce information and protect it.\n\nAll US departments and agencies with intelligence functions are responsible for their own security abroad, except those that fall under [[Chief of Mission]] authority.<ref name=Matschulat>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/docs/v13i2a05p_0001.htm \n |first=Austin B. \n |last=Matschulat \n |title=Coordination and Cooperation in Counerintelligence \n |date=1996-07-02 \n |accessdate=2007-11-03 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010091345/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/docs/v13i2a05p_0001.htm \n |archivedate=2007-10-10 \n}}</ref>\n\nGovernments try to protect three things:\n*Their personnel\n*Their installations\n*Their operations\n\nIn many governments, the responsibility for protecting these things is split. Historically, CIA assigned responsibility for protecting its personnel and operations to its Office of Security, while it assigned the security of operations to multiple groups within the Directorate of Operations: the counterintelligence staff and the area (or functional) unit, such as Soviet Russia Division. At one point, the counterintelligence unit operated quite autonomously, under the direction of [[James Jesus Angleton]]. Later, operational divisions had subordinate counterintelligence branches, as well as a smaller central counterintelligence staff. [[Aldrich Ames]] was in the Counterintelligence Branch of Europe Division, where he was responsible for directing the analysis of Soviet intelligence operations. US military services have had a similar and even more complex split.\n\nThis kind of division clearly requires close coordination, and this in fact occurs on a daily basis. The interdependence of the US counterintelligence community is also manifest in our relationships with liaison services. We cannot cut off these relationships because of concern about security, but experience has certainly shown that we must calculate the risks involved.<ref name = Matschulat/>\n\nOn the other side of the CI coin, counterespionage has one purpose that transcends all others in importance: penetration. The emphasis which the KGB places on penetration is evident in the cases already discussed from the defensive or security viewpoint. The best security system in the world cannot provide an adequate defense against it because the technique involves people. The only way to be sure that an enemy has been contained is to know his plans in advance and in detail.\n\n<blockquote>Moreover, only a high-level penetration of the opposition can tell you whether your own service is penetrated. A high-level defector can also do this, but the adversary knows that he defected and within limits can take remedial action. Conducting CE without the aid of penetrations is like fighting in the dark. Conducting CE with penetrations can be like [[shooting fish in a barrel]].<ref name=Matschulat /></blockquote>\n\nIn the British service, the cases of the [[Cambridge Five]], and the later suspicions about MI5 chief Sir [[Roger Hollis]] caused great internal dissension. Clearly, the British were penetrated by Philby, but it has never been determined, in any public forum, if there were other serious penetrations. In the US service, there was also significant disruption over the contradictory accusations about moles from defectors [[Anatoliy Golitsyn]] and [[Yuri Nosenko]], and their [[James Jesus Angleton#Golitsyn and Nosenko|respective supporters in CIA and the British Security Service (MI5)]]. Golitsyn was generally believed by Angleton. [[George Kisevalter]], the CIA operations officer that was the CIA side of the joint US-UK handling of [[Oleg Penkovsky]], did not believe Angleton's theory that Nosenko was a [[KGB]] plant. Nosenko had exposed [[John Vassall]], a [[KGB]] asset principally in the British Admiralty, but there were arguments Vassall was a KGB sacrifice to protect other operations, including Nosenko and a possibly more valuable source on the Royal Navy.\n\n=== Defensive counterintelligence ===\nDefensive counterintelligence starts by looking for places in one's own organization that could easily be exploited by foreign intelligence services (FIS). FIS is an established term of art in the counterintelligence community, and, in today's world, \"foreign\" is shorthand for \"opposing.\" Opposition might indeed be a country, but it could be a transnational group or an internal insurgent group. Operations against a FIS might be against one's own nation, or another friendly nation. The range of actions that might be done to support a friendly government can include a wide range of functions, certainly including military or counterintelligence activities, but also humanitarian aid and aid to development (\"nation building\").<ref name=JP3-07.1>{{cite web\n | url = https://fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/jp3_07_1.pdf\n | title = Joint Publication 3-07.1: Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Foreign Internal Defense (FID)\n | author =\n | date = 2004-04-30\n | accessdate = 2007-11-03\n|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nTerminology here is still emerging, and \"transnational group\" could include not only terrorist groups but also transnational criminal organization. Transnational criminal organizations include the drug trade, money laundering, extortion targeted against computer or communications systems, smuggling, etc.\n\n\"Insurgent\" could be a group opposing a recognized government by criminal or military means, as well as conducting clandestine intelligence and covert operations against the government in question, which could be one's own or a friendly one.\n\nCounterintelligence and counterterrorism analyses provide strategic assessments of foreign intelligence and terrorist groups and prepare tactical options for ongoing operations and investigations. Counterespionage may involve proactive acts against foreign intelligence services, such as [[double agent]]s, [[deception]], or recruiting foreign intelligence officers. While clandestine [[HUMINT]] sources can give the greatest insight into the adversary's thinking, they may also be most vulnerable to the adversary's attacks on one's own organization. Before trusting an enemy agent, remember that such people started out as being trusted by their own countries and may still be loyal to that country.\n\n=== Offensive counterintelligence operations ===\nWisner emphasized his own, and Dulles', views that the best defense against foreign attacks on, or infiltration of, intelligence services is active measures against those hostile services.<ref name=Wisner /> This is often called '''counterespionage''': measures taken to detect enemy espionage or physical attacks against friendly intelligence services, prevent damage and information loss, and, where possible, to turn the attempt back against its originator. Counterespionage goes beyond being reactive and actively tries to subvert hostile intelligence service, by recruiting agents in the foreign service, by discrediting personnel actually loyal to their own service, and taking away resources that would be useful to the hostile service. All of these actions apply to non-national threats as well as to national organizations.\n\nIf the hostile action is in one's own country or in a friendly one with co-operating police, the hostile agents may be arrested, or, if diplomats, declared [[persona non grata]]. From the perspective of one's own intelligence service, exploiting the situation to the advantage of one's side is usually preferable to arrest or actions that might result in the death of the threat. The intelligence priority sometimes comes into conflict with the instincts of one's own law enforcement organizations, especially when the foreign threat combines foreign personnel with citizens of one's country.\n\nIn some circumstances, arrest may be a first step in which the prisoner is given the choice of co-operating or facing severe consequence up to and including a death sentence for espionage. Co-operation may consist of telling all one knows about the other service but preferably actively assisting in deceptive actions against the hostile service.\n\n=== Counterintelligence protection of intelligence services ===\nDefensive counterintelligence specifically for intelligence services involves risk assessment of their culture, sources, methods and resources. Risk management must constantly reflect those assessments, since effective intelligence operations are often risk-taking. Even while taking calculated risks, the services need to mitigate risk with appropriate countermeasures.\n\nFIS are especially able to explore open societies and, in that environment, have been able to subvert insiders in the intelligence community. Offensive counterespionage is the most powerful tool for finding penetrators and neutralizing them, but it is not the only tool. Understanding what leads individuals to turn on their own side is the focus of Project Slammer. Without undue violations of personal privacy, systems can be developed to spot anomalous behavior, especially in the use of information systems.\n\nDecision makers require intelligence free from hostile control or manipulation. Since every intelligence discipline is subject to manipulation by our adversaries, validating the reliability of intelligence from all collection platforms is essential. Accordingly, each counterintelligence organization will validate the reliability of sources and methods that relate to the counterintelligence mission in accordance with common standards. For other mission areas, we will examine collection, analysis, dissemination practices, and other intelligence activities and will recommend improvements, best practices, and common standards.<ref name=NCIX>{{Cite web\n | url = https://fas.org/irp/ops/ci/cistrategy2007.pdf\n |format=PDF\n | title = National Counterintelligence Executive (NCIX)\n | year = 2007\n | postscript = <!--None-->\n}}</ref>\n\nIntelligence is vulnerable not only to external but also to internal threats. Subversion, treason, and leaks expose vulnerabilities, governmental and commercial secrets, and intelligence sources and methods. The insider threat has been a source of extraordinary damage to US national security, as with [[Counterintelligence failures#Aldrich Ames|Aldrich Ames]], [[Counterintelligence failures#Robert Hanssen|Robert Hanssen]], and [[Counterintelligence failures#Edward Lee Howard|Edward Lee Howard]], all of whom had access to major clandestine activities. Had an electronic system to detect anomalies in browsing through counterintelligence files been in place, [[Counterintelligence failures#Robert Hanssen|Robert Hanssen]]'s searches for suspicion of activities of his Soviet (and later Russian) paymasters might have surfaced early. Anomalies might simply show that an especially-creative analyst has a [[Intelligence analysis#Trained intuition|trained intuition]] possible connections and is trying to research them.\n\nAdding the new tools and techniques to [national arsenals], the counterintelligence community will seek to manipulate foreign spies, conduct aggressive investigations, make arrests and,\nwhere foreign officials are involved, expel them for engaging in practices inconsistent\nwith their diplomatic status or exploit them as an unwitting channel for deception, or turn them into witting double agents.<ref name=NCIX /> \"Witting\" is a term of intelligence art that indicates that one is not only aware of a fact or piece of information but also aware of its connection to intelligence activities.\n\n[[Victor Suvorov]], the pseudonym of a former Soviet military intelligence ([[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]]) officer, makes the point that a defecting HUMINT officer is a special threat to walk-in or other volunteer assets of the country that he is leaving. Volunteers who are \"warmly welcomed\" do not take into consideration the fact that they are despised by hostile intelligence agents.\n<blockquote>The Soviet operational officer, having seen a great deal of the ugly face of communism, very frequently feels the utmost repulsion to those who sell themselves to it willingly. And when a GRU or KGB officer decides to break with his criminal organization, something which fortunately happens quite often, the first thing he will do is try to expose the hated volunteer.<ref name=Suvorov-IM-04>{{Cite book\n | first = Victor | last = Suvorov\n | title = Inside Soviet Military Intelligence\n | url = http://militera.lib.ru/research/suvorov8/16.html\n | publisher = MacMillan Publishing Company\n | year = 1984\n | chapter = Chapter 4, Agent Recruiting\n | postscript = <!--None-->\n}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Counterintelligence force protection source operations ===\nAttacks against military, diplomatic, and related facilities are a very real threat, as demonstrated by the 1983 attacks against French and US peacekeepers in Beirut, the 1996 attack on the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, 1998 attacks on Colombian bases and on U.S. embassies (and local buildings) in Kenya and Tanzania the 2000 attack on the ''USS Cole'', and many others. The U.S. military force protection measures are the set of actions taken against military personnel and family members, resources, facilities and critical information, and most countries have a similar doctrine for protecting those facilities and conserving the potential of the forces. Force protection is defined to be a defense against deliberate attack, not accidents or natural disasters.\n\nCounterintelligence Force Protection Source Operations (CFSO) are human source operations, normally clandestine in nature, conducted abroad that are intended to fill the existing gap in national level coverage, as well as satisfying the combatant commander's intelligence requirements.<ref name=FM34-60>{{cite web\n | author = US Department of the Army\n | title = Field Manual 34-60: Counterintelligence\n | date = 1995-10-03\n | url = https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm34-60/\n | accessdate = 2007-11-04\n}}</ref> Military police and other patrols that mingle with local people may indeed be valuable HUMINT sources for counterintelligence awareness, but are not themselves likely to be CFSOs.

Although all intelligence disciplines can be used to gather force protection intelligence, HUMINT collected by intelligence and CI agencies plays a key role in providing indications and warning of terrorist and other force protection threats.<ref>{{cite web\n |last=US Department of Defense \n |authorlink=United States Department of Defense \n |title=Joint Publication 1-02 Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms \n |date=2007-07-12 \n |url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf \n |accessdate=2007-10-01 \n |format=PDF \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123014953/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf \n |archivedate=2008-11-23 \n}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nForce protection, for forces deployed in host countries, occupation duty, and even at home, may not be supported sufficiently by a national-level counterterrorism organization alone. In a country, colocating FPCI personnel, of all services, with military assistance and advisory units, allows agents to build relationships with host nation law enforcement and intelligence agencies, get to know the local environments, and improve their language skills. FPCI needs a legal domestic capability to deal with domestic terrorism threats.\n\nAs an example of terrorist planning cycles, the [[Khobar Towers]] attack shows the need for long-term FPCI. \"The Hizballah operatives believed to have conducted this attack began intelligence collection and planning activities in 1993. They recognized American military personnel were billeted at Khobar Towers in the fall of 1994 and began surveillance of the facility, and continued to plan, in June 1995. In March 1996, Saudi Arabian border guards arrested a Hizballah member attempting plastic explosive into the country, leading to the arrest of two more Hizballah members. Hizballah leaders recruited replacements for those arrested, and continued planning for the attack.\"<ref>{{Cite web\n  | last = Imbus\n  | first = Michael T\n  | title = Identifying Threats: Improving Intelligence and Counterintelligence Support to Force Protection\n  | date = April 2002\n  | id = USAFCSC-Imbus-2002\n  | url = http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/acsc/02-059.pdf\n  |format=PDF| accessdate = 2007-11-03\n  | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>\n\n==Defensive counterintelligence operations==\n\nIn U.S. doctrine, although not necessarily that of other countries, CI is now seen as primarily a counter to FIS [[HUMINT]]. In the 1995 US Army counterintelligence manual, CI had a broader scope against the various intelligence collection disciplines. Some of the overarching CI tasks are described as\n:#Developing, maintaining, and disseminating multidiscipline threat data and intelligence files on organizations, locations, and individuals of CI interest. This includes insurgent and terrorist infrastructure and individuals who can assist in the CI mission.\n:#Educating personnel in all fields of security. A component of this is the multidiscipline threat briefing. Briefings can and should be tailored, both in scope and classification level. Briefings could then be used to familiarize supported commands with the nature of the multidiscipline threat posed against the command or activity.\n\nMore recent US joint intelligence doctrine<ref>{{cite web\n  | author = Joint Chiefs of Staff\n  | authorlink = Joint Chiefs of Staff\n  | title = Joint Publication 2-0: Intelligence\n  | date = 2007-06-22\n  | id = US JP 2-0\n  | url = https://fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/jp2_0.pdf\n  | accessdate = 2007-11-05|format=PDF}}</ref> restricts its primary scope to counter-HUMINT, which usually includes counter-terror. It is not always clear, under this doctrine, who is responsible for all intelligence collection threats against a military or other resource. The full scope of US military counterintelligence doctrine has been moved to a classified publication, Joint Publication (JP) 2-01.2, ''Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence Support to Joint Operations''.\n\nMore specific countermeasures against intelligence collection disciplines are listed below\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n<caption>CI roles against Intelligence Collection Disciplines, 1995 doctrine<ref name=\"FM34-60\"/></caption>\n|-\n!

There is an additional category relevant to the broad spectrum of counterintelligence: why one becomes a terrorist.\n\nThe acronym '''MICE''':\n: '''M'''oney\n: '''I'''deology\n: '''C'''ompromise (or coercion)\n: '''E'''go\ndescribes the most common reasons people break trust and disclose classified materials, reveal operations to hostile services, or join terrorist groups. It makes sense, therefore, to monitor trusted personnel for risks in these areas, such as financial stress, extreme political views, potential vulnerabilities for blackmail, and excessive need for approval or intolerance of criticism. With luck, problems in an employee can be caught early, assistance can be provided to correct them, and not only is espionage avoided, but a useful employee retained. See [[Motives for spying]] for specific examples.\n\nSometimes, the preventive and neutralization tasks overlap, as in the case of [[Earl Edwin Pitts]]. Pitts had been an FBI agent who had sold secret information to the Soviets, and, after the fall of the USSR, to the Russians. He was caught by an FBI false flag sting, in which FBI agents, posing as Russian FSB agents, came to Pitts with an offer to \"reactivate\" him. His activities seemed motivated by both money and ego over perceived bad treatment when he was an FBI agent. His sentence required him to tell the FBI all he knew of foreign agents. Ironically, he told them of suspicious actions by [[Robert Hanssen]], which were not taken seriously at the time.\n\n==== Motivations for information and operations disclosure ====\n\nTo go beyond slogans, Project Slammer was an effort of the Intelligence Community Staff, under the Director of Central Intelligence, to come up with characteristics of an individual likely to commit espionage against the United States.\nIt \"examines espionage by interviewing and psychologically assessing actual espionage subjects. Additionally, persons knowledgeable of subjects are contacted to better understand the subjects' private lives and how they are perceived by others while conducting espionage.\"<ref name=Slammer1990>{{Cite web\n | title = Project Slammer Interim Progress Report\n | last = Intelligence Community Staff\n | date = 12 April 1990\n | url =http://antipolygraph.org/documents/slammer-12-04-1990.shtml\n | accessdate = 2007-11-04\n | postscript = <!--None-->\n}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n<caption>How an espionage subject sees himself (at the time of espionage)</caption>\n|-\n!

These are mutually reinforcing, often simultaneous events.\n\n&ndash; Subject finds that it is easy to go around security safeguards (or is able to solve that problem). They belittle the security system, feeling that if the information was really important espionage would be hard to do (the information would really be better protected).

This occurs when access to classified information is lost or there is a perceived need to prove themselves or both.\n\n&ndash; Others find that espionage activity becomes stressful, they no longer want it. Glamour (if present earlier) subsides. They are reluctant to continue. They may even break contact.\n\n&ndash; Sometimes they consider telling authorities what they have done. Those wanting to reverse their role aren't confessing, they're negotiating. Those who are \"Stressed out\" want to confess. Neither wants punishment. Both attempt to minimize or avoid punishment.\n|}\n\nAccording to a press report about Project Slammer and Congressional oversight of counterespionage, one fairly basic function is observing one's own personnel for behavior that either suggests that they could be targets for foreign HUMINT, or may already have been subverted. News reports indicate that in hindsight, red flags were flying but not noticed.<ref name=Stein>{{Cite journal\n | title = The Mole's Manual\n | last = Stein\n | first = Jeff\n | date = July 5, 1994\n | journal = New York Times\n | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/05/opinion/the-mole-s-manual.html?pagewanted=print\n | accessdate = 2007-11-04\n | postscript = <!--None-->\n}}</ref> In several major penetrations of US services, such as [[Aldrich Ames]], the Walker ring or [[Robert Hanssen]], the individual showed patterns of spending inconsistent with their salary.

They emphasize the <blockquote>essential and multi-faceted motivational patterns underlying espionage. Future Slammer analyses will focus on newly developing issues in espionage such as the role of money, the new dimensions of loyalty and what seems to be a developing trend toward economic espionage.</blockquote>\n\n===Counter-SIGINT (Signals Intelligence)===\n\nMilitary and security organizations will provide secure communications, and may [[Signals intelligence#Monitoring friendly communications|monitor]] less secure systems, such as commercial telephones or general Internet connections, to detect inappropriate information being passed through them. Education on the need to use secure communications, and instruction on using them properly so that they do not become vulnerable to [[Transmission security|specialized technical interception]].\n\n===Counter-IMINT (Imagery Intelligence)===\nThe basic methods of countering IMINT are to know when the opponent will use imaging against one's own side, and interfering with the taking of images. In some situations, especially in free societies, it must be accepted that public buildings may always be subject to photography or other techniques.\n\nCountermeasures include putting visual shielding over sensitive targets or camouflaging them. When countering such threats as imaging satellites, awareness of the orbits can guide security personnel to stop an activity, or perhaps cover the sensitive parts, when the satellite is overhead. This also applies to imaging on aircraft and UAVs, although the more direct expedient of shooting them down, or attacking their launch and support area, is an option in wartime.\n\n===Counter-OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)===\nWhile the concept well precedes the recognition of a discipline of [[OSINT]], the idea of [[Censorship#Censorship of state secrets and prevention of attention|censorship of material directly relevant to national security]] is a basic OSINT defense. In democratic societies, even in wartime, censorship must be watched carefully lest it violate reasonable freedom of the press, but the balance is set differently in different countries and at different times.\n\nThe [[United Kingdom]] is generally considered to have a very free press, but there is the [[DA-Notice|DA-Notice, formerly D-notice]] system. Many British journalists find that the system is used fairly, but there will always be arguments. In the specific context of counterintelligence, note that [[Peter Wright (MI5 officer)|Peter Wright]], a former senior member of the [[MI5|Security Service]] who left their service without his pension, moved to [[Australia]] before publishing his book [[Spycatcher]]. While much of the book was reasonable commentary, it revealed some specific and sensitive techniques, such as [[Operation RAFTER]], a means of detecting the existence and setting of radio receivers.\n\n===Counter-MASINT (Measurement and Signature Intelligence)===\nMASINT is mentioned here for completeness, but the discipline contains so varied a range of technologies that a type-by-type strategy is beyond the current scope. One example, however, can draw on the [[Operation RAFTER]] technique revealed in Wright's book. With the knowledge that [[Radiofrequency MASINT]] was being used to pick up an internal frequency in radio receivers, it would be possible to design a shielded receiver that would not radiate the signal that RAFTER monitored.\n\n==Theory of offensive counterintelligence==\nOffensive techniques in current counterintelligence doctrine are principally directed against human sources, so counterespionage can be considered a synonym for offensive counterintelligence. At the heart of exploitation operations is the objective to degrade the effectiveness of an adversary's intelligence service or a terrorist organization. Offensive counterespionage (and counterterrorism) is done one of two ways, either by manipulating the adversary (FIS or terrorist) in some manner or by disrupting the adversary's normal operations.\n\nDefensive counterintelligence operations that succeed in breaking up a clandestine network by arresting the persons involved or by exposing their actions demonstrate that disruption is quite measurable and effective against FIS if the right actions are taken. If defensive counterintelligence stops terrorist attacks, it has succeeded.\n\nOffensive counterintelligence seeks to damage the long-term capability of the adversary. If it can lead a national adversary into putting large resources into protecting from a nonexistent threat, or if it can lead terrorists to assume that all of their \"sleeper\" agents in a country have become unreliable and must be replaced (and possibly killed as security risks), there is a greater level of success than can be seen from defensive operations alone, To carry out offensive counterintelligence, however, the service must do more than detect; it must manipulate persons associated with the adversary.\n\nThe Canadian Department of National Defence makes some useful logical distinctions in its Directive on its<ref name=DND-8002-2>{{Cite web\n | url = http://www.admfincs.forces.gc.ca/admfincs/subjects/daod/8002/2_e.asp\n | title = Canadian Forces National Counter-Intelligence Unit\n | accessdate = 2007-11-19\n | date = 2003-03-28\n | id = Canada-DND-DAOD 8002-2\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071121153316/http://www.admfincs.forces.gc.ca/admfincs/subjects/daod/8002/2_e.asp\n | archive-date = 2007-11-21\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref>\nNational Counter-Intelligence Unit. The terminology is not the same as used by other services, but the distinctions are useful:\n:#\"Counter-intelligence (''contre-ing\u00e9rence'') means activities concerned with identifying and counteracting threats to the security of DND employees, CF members, and DND and CF property and information, that are posed by hostile intelligence services, organizations or individuals, who are or may be engaged in espionage, sabotage, subversion, terrorist activities, organized crime or other criminal activities.\" This corresponds to defensive counterintelligence in other services.\n:#\"Security intelligence  (''renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9'') means intelligence on the identity, capabilities and intentions of hostile intelligence services, organizations or individuals, who are or may be engaged in espionage, sabotage, subversion, terrorist activities, organized crime or other criminal activities.\" This does ''not'' (''emphasis added'') correspond directly to offensive counterintelligence, but is the intelligence preparation necessary to conduct offensive counterintelligence.\n:#The duties of the Canadian Forces National Counter-Intelligence Unit include \"identifying, investigating and countering threats to the security of the DND and the CF from espionage, sabotage, subversion, terrorist activities, and other criminal activity; identifying, investigating and countering the actual or possible compromise of highly classified or special DND or CF material; conducting CI security investigations, operations and security briefings and debriefings to counter threats to, or to preserve, the security of DND and CF interests.\"  This mandate is a good statement of a mandate to conduct offensive counterintelligence.\n\nDND further makes the useful clarification,<ref name=DND8002-3>{{Cite web\n | url = http://www.admfincs.forces.gc.ca/admfincs/subjects/daod/8002/3_e.asp\n | title = Security Intelligence Liaison Program\n | accessdate = 2007-11-19\n | date = 2003-03-28\n | id = Canada-DND-DAOD 8002-3\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071130193223/http://www.admfincs.forces.gc.ca/admfincs/subjects/daod/8002/3_e.asp\n | archive-date = 2007-11-30\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref>\n\"The security intelligence process ''should not be confused with'' the liaison conducted by members of the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service (CFNIS) for the purpose of ''obtaining criminal intelligence,'' as the collection of this type of information is within their mandate.\"\n\nManipulating an intelligence professional, himself trained in counterintelligence, is no easy task, unless he is already predisposed toward the opposing side. Any effort that does not start with a sympathetic person will take a long-term commitment, and creative thinking to overcome the defenses of someone who knows he is a counterintelligence target and also knows counterintelligence techniques.\n\nTerrorists on the other hand, although they engage in deception as a function of security appear to be more prone to manipulation or deception by a well-placed adversary than are foreign intelligence services. This is in part due to the fact that many terrorist groups, whose members \"often mistrust and fight among each other, disagree, and vary in conviction.\", are not as internally cohesive as foreign intelligence services, potentially leaving them more vulnerable to both deception and manipulation.\n\nA person willing to take on an offensive counterintelligence role, especially when not starting as a professional member of a service, can present in many ways. A person may be attracted by careful nurturing of a sense that someone may want to act against service A, or may be opportunistic: a walk-in or write-in.\n\nOpportunistic acquisition, as of a walk-in, has the disadvantage of being unexpected and therefore unplanned for: the decision to run a double agent should be made only after a great deal of thought, assessment, and evaluation, and if the candidate comes as a volunteer, the service may have to act without sufficient time for reflection. In this situation the necessity of assessing the candidate conflicts also with the preservation of security, particularly if the officer approached is in covert status. Volunteers and walk-ins are tricky customers, and the possibility of provocation is always present. On the other hand, some of our best operations have been made possible by volunteers. The test of the professional skill of an intelligence organization is its ability to handle situations of this type.<ref name=Begoum>{{Cite journal\n | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol6no1/pdf/v06i1a05p.pdf\n | title = Observations on the Double Agent\n | date = 18 September 1995\n | first = F.M.\n | last = Begoum\n | journal = Studies in Intelligence\n | accessdate = 2007-11-03\n| postscript = <!--None-->\n}}</ref>\n\nWhen an agent candidate appears, judgments are needed on four essential questions to decide if a potential operation makes sense, if the candidate is the right person for the operation, and if one's own service can support the operation.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n<caption>Deciding if a candidate is viable</caption>\n|-\n! Question\n! Answer\n|-\n| Has he told you everything?\n| Enough information can ordinarily be obtained in one or two sessions with the candidate to permit testing by polygraph, investigation of leads, and file checks. These steps must be taken very quickly because it is not possible to un-recruit a man. The two areas of possible concealment which are especially dangerous are prior intelligence ties and side-commo.\n|-\n| Does he have stayability?\n| This term combines two concepts\u2014his ability to maintain access to the counterintelligence target for the foreseeable future, and his psychological stamina under the constant (and sometimes steadily increasing) pressure of the double agent's role. If he lacks stayability he may still be useful, but the operation must then be planned for short range.\n|-\n| Does the adversary trust him?\n|Indications of adversary trust can be found in the level of the communications system given him, his length of service, the seniority of the adversary case officer, the nature and level of requirements, and the kind and extent of training provided. If the opposition keeps the agent at arm's length, there is little prospect that doubling him will yield significant returns.\n|-\n| Can you control his communications both ways?\n| Control of communications on your own side can be difficult enough, especially if the agent lives in hostile territory. But control of adversary channels is hard under even the best of circumstances. It requires a great deal of time, technical skill, and\u2014as a rule, manpower.\n|}\n\nNegative answers on one or even two of these questions are not ground for immediate rejection of the possible operation. But they are ground for requiring some unusually high entries on the credit side of the ledger.\n\nThe initial assessment comes from friendly debriefing or interview. The interviewing officer may be relaxed and casual, but underneath the surface his attitude is one of deliberate purpose: he is trying to find out enough to make an initial judgment of the man sensing the subject's motivations, emotional state and mental processes.\n\nFor instance, if an agent walks in, says he is a member of another service, and reveals information so sensitive that the other service would surely not give it away just to establish the informant's bona fides, there are two possibilities:\n:*either the agent is telling the truth\n:*he is attempting a provocation\nSometimes, the manner in which the man conducts himself will suggest which of the two it is. In addition to establishing the individual's true identity and examining his documents, there is also a need to gain information on the walk-in's service.\n\nIt may be more difficult to determine the reason why the agent presented himself than to establish who he is and what service he represents, because motivation is a complex of mental and emotional drives. The question of the double agent's motivation is approached by the interviewing officer from two angles:\n:*the agent's professed reasons\n:*the officer's own inferences from his story and behavior.\n\nIf a recruit speaks of a high regard for democratic ideology, but casual conversation about Western history and politics may reveal that the potential double agent really has no understanding of democracy, then ideology may not be the real reason why he is willing to cooperate. While it is possible that such an individual created a romanticized fantasy of democracy, it is more likely that he is saying what he thinks the CI officer wants to hear. CI officers should make it comfortable for the agent to mention more base motivations: money or revenge. It can be informative to leave such things as luxury catalogs where the agent can see them, and observe if he reacts with desire, repugnance, or disbelief.\n\nTo decide between what the officer thinks the motive is and what the agent says it is not easy, because double agents act out of a wide variety of motivations, sometimes psychopathic ones like a masochistic desire for punishment by both services. Others have financial, religious, political, or vindictive motives.   The last are often the best double agents: they get pleasure out of deceiving their comrades by their every act day after day.<ref name = Begoum/>\n\nMaking the judgment about the agent's psychological and physical suitability is also difficult. Sometimes a psychologist or psychiatrist can be called in under some pretext. Such professionals, or a well-trained CI officer, may recognize signs of [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic personality disorder]] in potential double agents. From the point of view of the double agent operation, here are their key traits:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n<caption>Characteristics of sociopaths</caption>\n|-\n| They are unusually calm and stable under stress but cannot tolerate routine or boredom\n| They do not form lasting and adult emotional relationships with other people because their attitude toward others is exploitative\n|-\n| They have above-average intelligence. They are good verbalizers\u2014sometimes in two or more languages\n| They are skeptical and even cynical about the motives and abilities of others but have exaggerated notions about their own competence.\n|-\n| Their reliability as agents is largely determined by the extent to which the case officer's instructions coincide with what they consider their own best interests.\n| They are ambitious only in a short range sense: they want much and they want it now. They do not have the patience to plod toward a distant reward.\n|-\n| They are naturally clandestine and enjoy secrecy and deception for its own sake.\n|\n|}\nThe candidate must be considered as a person and the operation as a potential. Possibilities which would otherwise be rejected out of hand can be accepted if the counterintelligence service is or will be in a position to obtain and maintain an independent view of both the double agent and the case.\n\nThe estimate of the potential value of the operation must take into consideration whether his service has the requisite personnel, facilities, and technical support; whether running the operation will prejudice other activities of his government; whether it will be necessary or desirable, at the outset or later, to share the case with foreign liaison; and whether the case has political implications.\n\n==Types of offensive counterespionage operations==\n\nA subject of offensive counterintelligence starts with a loyalty to one service. In these examples:\n:*Service A: Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) or non-national group\n::*Service A1: a client, supporting organization, or ally of A\n:*Service B: One's own or an allied service\n::*Service B1: a client, supporting organization, or ally of B\n:*Service C: A third country's service, which, in this context, should be assumed to be neutral.\n\nDouble agents and defectors start out being loyal to service B, which immediately creates the potential for emotional conflict. False flag operations also have the potential for conflict, as these operations recruit people who believe they are working for service C, but they have not been told the truth: they are actually working for service A or B, depending on the nature of the operation.\n\n===Mole===\n\nMoles start out as loyal to service A, but may or may not be a trained intelligence officer of that service. Indeed, those that are not trained, but volunteer to penetrate a FIS, may either not understand the risk, or are tremendously brave individuals, highly motivated against Country B and willing to risk its retaliation if their limited preparation reveals their true affiliation.\n\n:Starts in A\n:Joins B\n:Transmits to A or disrupts operations until leaves or disrupted\n\nNote that some intelligence professionals reserve mole to refer to enemy personnel that personally know important things about enemy intelligence operations, technology, or military plans. A person such as a clerk or courier, who photographs many documents but is not really in a position to explore enemy thinking, is more generically an asset. To be clear, all moles are assets, but not all assets are moles.\n\nOne of the more difficult methods involves having the would-be-mole \"dangled\" \u2013 that is luring the adversary intelligence service (or terrorist group) to recruit the opposition's clandestine intelligence officer who is posing as a \"walk-in\" (someone who voluntarily offers information) \u2013 in the hopes that the adversary will unknowingly take the bait.\n\nAnother special case is a \"deep cover\" or \"sleeper\" mole, who may enter a service, possibly at a young age, but definitely not reporting or doing anything that would attract suspicion, until reaching a senior position.  [[Kim Philby]] is an example of an agent actively recruited by Britain while he was already committed to Communism.\n\n===False-flag penetrator===\n\nA special case is a false-flag recruitment of a penetrator:\n\n:Starts in C\n:Believes being recruited by A\n:Actually is recruited by B and sends false information to C\n\n===Defector===\n\nAn individual may want to leave their service at once, perhaps from high-level disgust, or low-level risk of having been discovered in financial irregularities and is just ahead of arrest. Even so, the defector certainly brings knowledge with him, and may be able to bring documents or other materials of value.\n\n:Starts in A\n:Leaves and goes to B\n\n===Defector in place===\n\nAnother method is to directly recruit an intelligence officer (or terrorist member) from within the ranks of the adversary service (terrorist group) and having that officer (terrorist) maintain their normal duties while spying on their parent service (organization); this is also referred to as recruiting an \"agent\" or defector in place.<ref name = Gleghorn/>\n\n:Starts in A\n:Stays working in A but reporting to B\n\n===Double agent===\n\nBefore even considering double agent operations, a service has to consider its own resources. Managing that agent will take skill and sophistication, both at the local/case officer and central levels. Complexity goes up astronomically when the service cannot put physical controls on its doubles, as did the [[Double Cross System]] in [[World War II]].\n\nFrom beginning to end, a DA operation must be most carefully planned, executed, and above all, [[#Protecting your own service|reported]]. The amount of detail and administrative backstopping seems unbearable at times in such matters. But since penetrations are always in short supply, and defectors can tell less and less of what we need to know as time goes on, because of their cut-off dates, double agents will continue to be part of the scene.<ref name=Matschulat/>\n\nServices functioning abroad\u2014and particularly those operating in areas where the police powers are in neutral or hostile hands&mdash;need professional subtlety as well.<ref name = Begoum/> Case officers must know the agent's area and have a nuanced understanding of his language; this is an extremely unwise situation for using interpreters, since the case officer needs to sense the emotional content of the agent's communication and match it with the details of the information flowing in both directions. Depending on whether the operation is being run in one's own country, an allied country, or hostile territory, the case officer needs to know the relevant laws. Even in friendly territory, the case officer needs both liaison with, and knowledge of, the routine law enforcement and security units in the area, so the operation is not blown because an ordinary policeman gets suspicious and brings the agent in for questioning.\n\nThe most preferable situation is that the service running the double agent have complete control of communications. When communications were by Morse code, each operator had a unique rhythm of keying, called a \"fist\". MASINT techniques of the time recognized individual operators, so it was impossible to substitute a different operator than the agent. The agent also could make deliberate and subtle changes in his keying, to alert his side that he had been turned. While Morse is obsolete, voices are very recognizable and resistant to substitution. Even text communication can have patterns of grammar or word choice, known to the agent and his original service, that can hide a warning of capture.\n\nFull knowledge of [the agent's] past (and especially of any prior intelligence associations), a solid grasp of his behavior pattern (both as an individual and as a member of a national grouping), and rapport in the relationship with him.\n\nThe discovery of an adversary intelligence officer who has succeeded in penetrating one's own organization offers the penetrated intelligence service the possibility of \"turning\" this officer in order to use him as a \"double agent\". The way a double agent case starts deeply affects the operation throughout its life. Almost all of them begin in one of the three ways following:\n:*Walk-in or talk-in\n:*Detected and doubled, usually under duress\n:*Provocation agent\n\n'''Double agent'''\n:Starts in A\n:Recruited by B\n:Defects and tells B all he knows (defector)\n::operates in place (Agent [[#Doubled in place|doubled in place]]) and continues to tell B about A\n\n'''False flag double agent'''\n:Starts in A\n:Assigned to C\n:B creates a situation where agent believes he is talking to C, when actually receiving B disinformation\n'''Active penetrator'''\n:Starts in A and is actually loyal to A\n:Goes to B, says he works for A, but wants to switch sides. Gives B access to his communications channel with A\n:Keeps second communications channel, X with A, about which B knows nothing\n::Reports operational techniques of B to A via X\n::Provides disinformation from A to B via X\n\n'''[[#Passive provocateur|Passive Provocateur]]'''\n:A does an analysis of C and determines what targets would be attractive to B\n:A then recruits citizens of C, which A believes will be more loyal to B\n:The A recruit, a citizen of C, volunteers to B\n:A can then expose B's penetration of C, hurting B-C relations.\n\nThis may be extremely difficult to accomplish, and even if accomplished the real difficulty is maintaining control of this \"turned asset\". Controlling an enemy agent who has been turned is a many-faceted and complex exercise that essentially boils down to making certain that the agent's new-found loyalty remains consistent, which means determining whether the \"doubled\" agent's turning is genuine or false. However, this process can be quite convoluted and fraught with uncertainty and suspicion.\n\nWhere it concerns terrorist groups, a terrorist who betrays his organization can be thought of and run as a double-agent against the terrorist's \"parent\" organization in much the same fashion as an intelligence officer from a foreign intelligence service. Therefore, for sake of ease, wherever double-agents are discussed the methodologies generally apply to activities conducted against terrorist groups as well.<ref name = Gleghorn/>\n\nA double agent is a person who engages in clandestine activity for two intelligence or security services (or more in joint operations), who provides information about one or about each to the other, and who wittingly withholds significant information from one on the instructions of the other or is unwittingly manipulated by one so that significant facts are withheld from the adversary. Peddlers, fabricators, and others who work for themselves rather than a service are not double agents because they are not agents. The fact that doubles have an agent relationship with both sides distinguishes them from penetrations, who normally are placed with the target service in a staff or officer capacity.\n\nThe unwitting double agent is an extremely rare bird. The manipulative skill required to deceive an agent into thinking that he is serving the adversary when in fact he is damaging its interests is plainly of the highest order.\n\nFor predictive purposes the most important clue embedded in the origins of an operation is the agent's original or primary affiliation, whether it was formed voluntarily or not, the length of its duration, and its intensity. The effects of years of clandestine association with the adversary are deep and subtle; the Service B case officer working with a double agent of service A is characterized by an ethnicity or religion may find those bonds run deep, even if the agent hates the government of A. The service B officer may care deeply for the double.\n\nAnother result of lengthy prior clandestine service is that the agent may be hard to control in most operations the case officer's superior training and experience give him so decided an edge over the agent that recognition of this superiority makes the agent more tractable. But add to the fact that the experienced double agent may have been in the business longer than his U.S. control his further advantage in having gained a first-hand comparative knowledge of the workings of at least two disparate services, and the case officer's margin of superiority diminishes, vanishes, or even is reversed.\n\nOne facet of the efforts to control a double agent operation is to ensure that the double agent is protected from discovery by the parent intelligence service; this is especially true in circumstances where the double agent is a defector-in-place.\n\nLike all other intelligence operations, double agent cases are run to protect and enhance the national security. They serve this purpose principally by providing current counterintelligence about hostile intelligence and security services and about clandestine subversive activities. The service and officer considering a double agent possibility must weigh net national advantage thoughtfully, never forgetting that a double agent is, in effect, a condoned channel of communication with the enemy.\n\n====Doubled in place====\n\nA service discovering an adversary agent may offer him employment as a double. His agreement, obtained under open or implied duress, is unlikely, however, to be accompanied by a genuine switch of loyalties. The so-called redoubled agent whose duplicity in doubling for another service has been detected by his original sponsor and who has been persuaded to reverse his affections again also belongs to this dubious class. Many detected and doubled agents degenerate into what are sometimes called \"piston agents\" or \"mailmen,\" who change their attitudes with their visas as they shunt from side to side.\n\nOperations based on them are little more than unauthorized liaison with the enemy, and usually time-wasting exercises in futility. A notable exception is the detected and unwillingly doubled agent who is relieved to be found out in his enforced service to the adversary.\n\n====Active provocateur====\nThere can be active and passive provocation agents. A double agent may serve as a means through which a provocation can be mounted against a person, an organization, an intelligence or security service, or any affiliated group to induce action to its own disadvantage. The provocation might be aimed at identifying members of the other service, at diverting it to less important objectives, at tying up or wasting its assets and facilities, at sowing dissension within its ranks, at inserting false data into its files to mislead it, at building up in it a tainted file for a specific purpose, at forcing it to surface an activity it wanted to keep hidden, or at bringing public discredit on it, making it look like an organization of idiots. The Soviets and some of the Satellite services, the Poles in particular, are extremely adept in the art of conspiratorial provocation. All kinds of mechanisms have been used to mount provocation operations; the double agent is only one of them.\n\nAn active one is sent by Service A to Service B to tell B that he works for A but wants to switch sides. Or he may be a talk-in rather than a walk-in. In any event, the significant information that he is withholding, in compliance with A's orders, is the fact that his offer is being made at A's instigation. He is also very likely to conceal one channel of communication with A-for example, a second secret writing system. Such \"side-commo\" enables A to keep in full touch while sending through the divulged communications channel only messages meant for adversary eyes. The provocateur may also conceal his true sponsor, claiming for example (and truthfully) to represent an A1 service (allied with A) whereas his actual control is the A.\n\n====Passive provocateur====\nPassive provocations are variants involving false-flag recruiting.\n\nIn Country C, Service A surveys the intelligence terrain through the eyes of Service B (a species of mirror-reading) and selects those citizens whose access to sources and other qualifications make them most attractive to B. Service A officers, posing as service B officers, recruit the citizens of country C. At some point, service A then exposes these individuals, and complains to country C that country B is subverting its citizens.\n\nThe stake-out has a far better chance of success in areas like Africa, where intelligence exploitation of local resources is far less intensive than in Europe, where persons with valuable access are likely to have been approached repeatedly by recruiting services during the postwar years.<ref name = Begoum/>\n\n====Multiply turned agent====\n\nA triple agent can be a double agent that decides his true loyalty is to his original service or could always have been loyal to his service but is part of an active provocation of your service. If managing a double agent is difficult, agents that turned again (tripled) or another time after that are far more difficult but, in some rare cases, worthwhile.\n\nAny service B controlling or believing that it controls a double agent must constantly evaluate the information that agent is providing on service A. While service A may have been willing to sacrifice meaningful information or even other human assets, to help an intended penetration agent establish his bona fides, at some point, service A may start providing useless or misleading information as part of the goal of service A. In the World War II [[Double Cross System]], another way that the British controllers (service B in this example) kept the Nazis believing in their agent, was that the British let true information flow but too late for the Germans to act on it. The double agent might send information indicating that a lucrative target was in range of a German submarine, but by the time the information reaches the Germans, they confirm the report was true because the ship is now docked in a safe port that would have been a logical destination on the course reported by the agent.<ref>{{cite book\n | first = Anthony Cave\n | last = Brown\n | title = Bodyguard of Lies: The Extraordinary True Story Behind D-Day\n | year = 1975\n}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Double Cross System actively handled the double agent, the information sent to the Germans was part of the overall [[Operation Bodyguard]] deception program of the [[London Controlling Section]]. Operation Bodyguard was meant to convince the Germans that the Allies planned their main invasion at one of several places, none of which was Normandy. As long as the Germans found the deceptions credible, as occurred, they reinforced the other locations. Even when the large landings came at Normandy, deception operations continued to convince the Germans that [[Operation Neptune]] at Normandy was a feint and so they held back their strategic reserves. When it had become apparent that Normandy was indeed the main invasions, the strategic reserves had been under heavy air attack, and the lodgment was sufficiently strong that the reduced reserves could not push it back.\n\nThere are other benefits to analyzing the exchange of information between the double agent and his original service, such as learning the priorities of service A through the information requests they are sending to an individual they believe is working for them. If the requests all turn out to be for information that service B could not use against A, and it becomes a pattern, service A may have realized their agent has been turned.\n\nSince maintaining control over double agents is tricky at best, it is not hard to see how problematic this methodology can become. The potential for multiple turnings of agents and perhaps worse, the turning of one's own intelligence officers, especially those working within counterintelligence itself, poses a serious risk to any intelligence service wishing to employ these techniques. That may be the reason that triple-agent operations appear not to have been undertaken by US counterintelligence in some espionage cases that have come to light in recent years, particularly among those involving high-level penetrations.\n\nAlthough the arrest and prosecution of [[Aldrich Ames]] of the CIA and [[Robert Hanssen]] of the FBI, both of whom were senior counterintelligence officers in their respective agencies who volunteered to spy for the Russians, hardly qualifies as conclusive evidence that triple-agent operations were not attempted throughout the community writ large, both cases suggest that neutralization operations may be the preferred method of handling adversary double agent operations vice the more aggressive exploitation of these potential triple-agent sources.<ref name = Gleghorn/>\n\n'''Triple agent'''\n:Starts out working for B\n:Volunteers to be a defector-in-place for A\n:Discovered by B\n:Offers his communications with A to B, so B may gain operational data about A and send disinformation to A\n\nA concern with triple agents, of course, is if they have changed loyalties twice, why not a third or even more times? Consider a variant where the agent remains fundamentally loyal to B\n\n'''Quadruple agent'''\n:Starts out working for B\n:Volunteers to be a defector-in-place for A. Works out a signal by which he can inform A that B has discovered and is controlling him\n:Discovered by B\n:Offers his communications with A to B.\n::B actually gets disinformation about A's operational techniques\n::A learns what B wants to know, such as potential vulnerabilities of A, which A will then correct\n\nSuccesses such as the British Double Cross System or the German [[Operation North Pole]] show that such of operations are indeed feasible. Therefore, despite the obviously very risky and extremely-complex nature of double agent operations, the potentially quite lucrative intelligence windfall, the disruption or deception of an adversary service, makes them an inseparable component of exploitation operations.<ref name=\"Gleghorn\"/>\n\nIf a double agent wants to come home to Service A, how can he offer a better way to redeem himself than recruiting the Service B case officer that was running his double agent case, essentially redoubling the direction of the operation? If the case officer refuses, that is apt to be the end of the operation. If the attempt fails, of course, the whole operation has to be terminated. A creative agent can tell his case office, even if he had not been tripled, that he had been loyal all along, and the case officer would at best be revealed as a fool.\n\nOccasionally, a service runs a double agent whom it knows to be under the control of the other service and so has little ability to manipulate or even one who it knows has been successfully redoubled. The question for a service to do so is valid. One reason for sometimes doing so humanitarian: when the other service has gained physical control of the agent by apprehending him in a denied area, the operation can be continued even if it is known that he has been doubled back because it is desirable to keep him alive if possible.\n\nAnother reason might be a desire to determine how the other service conducts its double agent operations or what it uses for operational build-up or deception material and from what level it is disseminated. There might be other advantages, such as deceiving the opposition as to the service's own capabilities, skills, intentions, etc. Perhaps, the service might want to continue running the known redoubled agent to conceal other operations. It might want to tie up the facilities of the opposition. It might use the redoubled agent as an adjunct in a provocation being run against the opposition elsewhere.\n\nRunning a known redoubled agent is like playing poker against a professional who has marked the cards but presumably is unaware that the other player can read the backs as well as he can.<ref name = Begoum/>\n\n==Running offensive counterespionage operations==\nControl is the capacity of a case officer of country B to generate, alter, or halt agent behavior by using or indicating his capacity to use physical or psychological means of leverage. A case officer working overseas does not control a double agent the way a policeman controls an informer. At best, the matter is in shades of gray. The case officer has to consider that the double from country A still has contact with country B.\n\nBefore the case officer pushes a button on the agent's control panel, he should know what is likely to happen next. For example, pressure exerted bluntly or blindly, without insight into the agent's motivation and personality, may cause him to tell the truth to the adversary as a means of escaping from a painful situation.\n\nThe target service (A) inevitably exercises some control over the double agent, if only in his performance of the tasks that it assigns to him. B, in fact, must be careful not to disrupt the double's relation with his own service, warning service A of a control. Even if the positive side is being run so poorly that the misguided agent is in danger of coming to the attention of local authorities whose intervention would spoil the CI aspect, the case officer must restrain his natural impulse to button up the adversary's operation for him. At the very most, he can suggest for the agent to complain to the hostile case officer about insecure practices and then only if the agent's sophistication and relationship with that case officer make such a complaint seem normal.\n\nPhysical control of the double is likely only with agents captured in war. The best possible outside capture is to have the double live where he can be watched or at least to work in a place that he can be watched. Control of the agent's communications is very close to physical control. Communications control, at least partial, is essential: the agent himself is controlled to a considerable extent if his communications are controlled, but even when his communications are completely controlled, a well-trained agent doubled against his will may appear to be co-operating but manage at an opportune moment to send a signal to his own service indicating that he is under duress.\n\nWith only partial control, if the agent is in communication with the opposition service through a courier, dead drop, or live drop, some control or surveillance must be established over these meetings or servicings. The double agent who makes trips in and out of the area in which he can be physically controlled presents a multiplicity of problems.<ref name = Begoum/>\n\n===Balancing risk and reward in offensive counterespionage===\nThe nature and value of the double agent's functions depend greatly on his personal ability as well as on his mission for the other service. He can always report on the objectives and conduct of this mission and possibly more broadly on the positive and counterintelligence targets of the other service or on its plans. If he is skillful and well trained, he can do valuable work by exploiting the weaknesses of others: all intelligence officers of any service, despite their training, have some weaknesses.\n\nOne's own side may triple an agent or even more times. With each turn, the chances of deception increase and so in such operations, the quality of the agent's services needs to be checked constantly. If the agent no longer elicits trust, he might be offered exfiltration if in a foreign country. He might be retired and given an advisory position in which he handles no secrets but might be useful as an occasional reference.\n\nA rare agent may actually understand the thinking of the highest levels of government policy. That may not be purely a matter of his assignment; Oleg Penkovsky had social ties to high-ranking generals.\n\nAn agent who has been with his service any appreciable time will be able to provide a good deal of information on the practices and possibly resources of his FIS. Other than for the most important agents, a service is not apt to invent new communications techniques, either for hard copy passed by dead drop or courier or for electronic transmission. Information on capabilities comes indirectly, from the level of technology and manufacturing quality with the country-specific equipment with which he was provided.\n\nSome agencies, however, make a point of providing their agents with \"sterile\" equipment obtained commercially from third countries. If that is their pattern, it may become obvious only if multiple agents are compared at the national CI level. A sufficiently-sophisticated agency may obtain different third-country equipment for different agents, leaving the operational instructions as the only detail that may establish a pattern.\n\nThe double agent serves also as a controlled channel through which information can be passed to the other service to build up the agent in its estimation or for the purposes of deception. In the complex matter of deception, the following may be distinguished:\n:*operational deception, that concerning the service's own capabilities, intentions, and control of the agent\n:*national deception, that concerning the intentions of the controlling government or other components of it\n\nNational deception operations are usually very delicate and frequently involve the highest levels of the government. They, therefore, require prior co-ordination and approval at the national headquarters level.\n\nThe double agent channel can be used by the controlling service to insert data into the mechanisms of the other service with a number of possible objectives, such as to detect its activities in some field. The inserted material is designed to induce certain actions on the part of the other service, which are then observed through another operation or group of operations. The material has to be designed very skillfully if it is to deceive the other service and produce the desired reactions. Such a situation might arise if a case officer handling several operations wanted to set up still another one and needed to find out in advance what the pertinent operational pattern was.\n\n===Running the operation: dos and don'ts===\nThe following principles apply to the handling of all double agent operations in varying degrees. In composite, they form a checklist against which ongoing operations might be periodically reviewed and given special examination with the appearance of danger signals.<ref name=\"Begoum\"/>\n\n====Monitoring, testing, and managing the double agent====\n\"Testing is a continuous process.\" In accordance with the doctrine in force, use your own, or assistance from psychological specialists, look for changes in motivation. If appropriate, use a polygraph or newer techniques for detecting emotional stress. Without revealing the penetration, cross-check the information from the agents, including technical analysis of documents and equipment, surveillance, and further research into verifying the agent's story (\"legend\" in tradecraft) While \"name traces cannot be run on every person mentioned by the agent, do not be stingy with them on persons who have familial, emotional, or business ties with him\" in verifying his legend.\n\n\"Test, but only as a double.\" Improve his own security and cover as a double. Do not, however, improve his intelligence collection skills. The hostile service might make use of information that he collects independently, or it may become suspicious if his skill and reporting suddenly improve. If he has been a bad speller in his reports to his service, don not volunteer to copy edit!\n\n\"Require the agent to report and, as security permits, turn over to you everything he gets from the other side: money, gifts, equipment, documents, etc.\" This is a delicate balance. If he thinks that he does not have to report something to you, he can become confused about who gets what. At the same time, use judgment to keep him motivated. Rather than confiscating payments to him, you might deposit them in a third-country bank account of which he is aware, which he can access on termination.\n\n\"Prepare all briefings carefully.\" Teaching him resistance to interrogation may improve his security, but it also may make his service suspicious if his manner to them changes.\n\n\"Keep analyzing the agent as well as the case.\" Labels such as \"anticommunist,\" \"militant jihadist,\" and \"morally offended by own side\" can oversimplify and interfere with your own understanding of his thinking.\n\n\"Review the case file periodically.\" Always be thinking if the situation would be improved with improvements in your cover, his cover, or the cover for the operational techniques. Think about how new facts validate or invalidate the old. You may be able to ferret out the real priorities of the opposition with a historical perspective by looking at what they told him to follow up out of his reporting.\n\n\"Decide early in the operation how it will be terminated if the need arises.\" The last thing you want to do is leave an angry agent in place in a hostile service. Transfer him to another case officer or allied agency or arrange his escape to your side.\n\n====Managing expectations of the hostile service====\n\"Mirror-read.\" Constantly think about the operation as if you were in the opposing service. Think about what it receives from your agent, its satisfaction with it, and its perception of the agent and his capabilities. Do not assume the other side thinks as your service does, a special risk for the United States. The US tends to rely more on technical collection and OSINT than many other world services; the Soviet Union regarded espionage as the most important collection technique even when it could have used OSINT to collect the same information.\n\n\"Be careful about awakening in the hostile service an appetite which cannot later be satisfied without giving away too much.\" Do not give the agent material that is attractive to the other service but that it might realize he could not have obtained on his own. As long as you are monitoring what he collects before sending it to the other side, let him operate in his own way. By letting him do so, you may detect vulnerabilities that have been missed by your own service, but you can either stop the material from being sent or create appropriate disinformation.\n\n\"Avoid interference.\" Let the other service solve or not solve agent problems in their usual manner. For example, if the agent is arrested, do not immediately and visibly intervene. In such a situation, the other side may expose additional resources to support the agent or to provide alternate means of collection. That can always be explained to the agent, with some truth, that you are not giving obvious help to protect his security to his own service.\n\n\"Be constantly alert for hostile provocation.\" If the agent reports a crisis with his service, do not take it at face value; always look for the plot within a plot, but keep perspective. The opposition is not supermen.\n\n\"If the adversary appears to be a satellite [client] service, do not forget that the more powerful organization may not be pulling the strings.\" A local ideological terror group may well be receiving direction from a distant transnational group. Consider the possibility of false-flag agents in such circumstances.\n\n====Protecting your own service====\n\"Report the case frequently, quickly, and in detail.\" The FIS has a headquarters staff looking globally for penetrations; why should you not take advantage of your central resources? \"Only timely and full reporting to your headquarters will permit it to help you effectively.\" Keep a full record, including dates, of all adversary assignments given the agent.\n\n\"Keep precise records\" of any of your own side's classified material fed to the agent. To protect both your service and yourself, keep careful notes about who approved the release.\n\n\"Do not plan a deception operation or pass deception material without prior headquarters approval.\"\n\n\"Do not reveal your service's assets or CI knowledge to a double.\" It is vital for double agents to be run within the framework of their own materials the information that they themselves supply. The more you keep from an experienced double the information that he should not have, the more he will be reassured that his own safety is in good hands.\n\n\"Do not run the operation in a vacuum.\" Be aware of any political implications that it may have, locally or internationally. Ask for advice when you are nt sure.\n\n\"If the operation is joint, weigh, its probable effect upon the liaison relationship.\" What should you do if the joint services changes its priorities?\n\n==Further reading==\n* Johnson, William R.

[[The Great Game]] saw the rise of systematic espionage and surveillance throughout the region by both powers]]\nModern tactics of espionage and dedicated government intelligence agencies developed over the course of the late-19th century. A key background to this development was [[The Great Game]] - the strategic rivalry and conflict between the British Empire and the Russian Empire throughout [[Central Asia]] between 1830 and 1895. To counter Russian ambitions in the region and the potential threat it posed to the British position in [[British India|India]], the [[Indian Civil Service]] built up a system of surveillance, intelligence and counterintelligence. The existence of this shadowy conflict was popularized in [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s famous [[espionage fiction|spy book]], ''[[Kim (novel)|Kim]]'' (1901), where he portrayed the Great Game (a phrase Kipling popularized) as an espionage and intelligence conflict that \"never ceases, day or night\".<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=D3KIwYA_QyAC|title= Intelligence and Government in Britain and the United States: A Comparative Perspective|author= Philip H.J.

As espionage became more widely used, it became imperative to expand the role of existing police and internal security forces into a role of detecting and countering foreign spies. The ''[[Evidenzbureau]]'' (founded in the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1850) had the role from the late-19th century of countering the actions of the [[Pan Slavism|Pan-Slavist movement]] operating out of [[Serbia]].\n\nAfter the fallout from the [[Dreyfus Affair]] of 1894-1906 in France, responsibility for French military counter-espionage passed in 1899 to the [[S\u00fbret\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale]]\u2014an agency originally responsible for order enforcement and public safety\u2014and overseen by the [[Ministry of the Interior]].<ref>[http://www.aassdn.org/hsvEXhis01.html Anciens des Services Sp\u00e9ciaux de la D\u00e9fense Nationale] ( France )</ref>\n\n[[Image:Okhranka group photo.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The [[Okhrana]], founded in 1880, had the task of countering enemy espionage against [[Imperial Russia]].

The agency used many methods to achieve its goals, including [[covert operations]], [[undercover agent]]s, and \"perlustration\"\u2014the interception and reading of private correspondence. The Okhrana became notorious for its use of [[agent provocateur|agents provocateurs]], who often succeeded in penetrating the activities of revolutionary groups - including the [[Bolsheviks]].<ref>Ian D. Thatcher, Late Imperial Russia: problems and prospects, page 50.</ref>\n\nIntegrated counterintelligence agencies run directly by governments were also established. The British government founded the [[Secret Intelligence Service|Secret Service Bureau]] in 1909 as the first independent and interdepartmental agency fully in control over all government counterintelligence activities.\n\nDue to intense lobbying from [[William Melville]] and after he obtained German mobilization plans and proof of their financial support to the [[Boer]]s, the British government authorized the formation of a new intelligence section in the [[War Office]], MO3 (subsequently redesignated M05) headed by Melville, in 1903. Working under-cover from a flat in London, Melville ran both counterintelligence and foreign intelligence operations, capitalizing on the knowledge and foreign contacts he had accumulated during his years running [[Special Branch]].\n\nDue to its success, the Government Committee on Intelligence, with support from [[Richard Haldane]] and [[Winston Churchill]], established the Secret Service Bureau in 1909 as a joint initiative of the [[Admiralty]], the [[War Office]] and the [[Foreign Office]] to control secret intelligence operations in the UK and overseas, particularly concentrating on the activities of the [[Imperial Germany|Imperial German]] government.

In most countries the counterintelligence mission is spread over multiple organizations, though one usually predominates. There is usually a domestic counterintelligence service, usually part of a larger [[law enforcement organization]] such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] in the [[United States]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe [[United Kingdom]] has the separate [[MI5|Security Service]], also known as MI5, which does not have direct police powers but works closely with law enforcement especially [[Special Branch]] that can carry out arrests, do searches with a warrant, etc.\n\nThe [[Russian Federation]]'s major domestic security organization is the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]], which principally came from the Second Chief Directorate and [[Military counterintelligence of the Soviet Army|Third Chief Directorate]] of the USSR's [[KGB]].\n\n[[Canada]] separates the functions of general defensive counterintelligence (''contre-ing\u00e9rence''), security intelligence (the intelligence preparation necessary to conduct offensive counterintelligence), law enforcement intelligence, and offensive counterintelligence.\n\nMilitary organizations have their own counterintelligence forces, capable of conducting protective operations both at home and when deployed abroad.<ref name=\"auto\">Clark, R.M. and Mitchell, W.L., 2018. Deception: Counterdeception and Counterintelligence. CQ Press.</ref> Depending on the country, there can be various mixtures of civilian and military in foreign operations. For example, while [[#Offensive counterintelligence operations|offensive counterintelligence]] is a mission of the US [[CIA]]'s [[National Clandestine Service]], [[#Defensive counterintelligence|defensive counterintelligence]] is a mission of the [[Diplomatic Security Service|U.S. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), Department of State]], who work on protective security for personnel and information processed abroad at US Embassies and Consulates.<ref>{{cite web\n | title = Counterintelligence Investigations\n | url = https://2009-2017.state.gov/m/ds/terrorism/c8653.htm\n | accessdate = 2008-05-08\n}}</ref>\n\nThe term counter-espionage is really specific to countering [[HUMINT]], but, since virtually all offensive counterintelligence involves exploiting human sources, the term \"offensive counterintelligence\" is used here to avoid some ambiguous phrasing.\n\nOther countries also deal with the proper organization of defenses against Foreign Intelligence Services (FIS), often with separate services with no common authority below the head of government.\n\n[[France]], for example, builds its domestic counterterror in a law enforcement framework. In France, a senior anti-terror magistrate is in charge of defense against terrorism. French magistrates have multiple functions that overlap US and UK functions of investigators, prosecutors, and judges. An anti-terror magistrate may call upon France's domestic intelligence service ''[[Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 int\u00e9rieure]]'' (DGSI), which may work with the ''[[Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ext\u00e9rieure]]'' (DGSE), foreign intelligence service.\n\n[[Spain]] gives its Interior Ministry, with military support, the leadership in domestic counterterrorism. For international threats, the National Intelligence Center (CNI) has responsibility. CNI, which reports directly to the Prime Minister, is staffed principally by which is subordinated directly to the Prime Minister's office. After the March 11, [[2004 Madrid train bombings]], the national investigation found problems between the Interior Ministry and CNI, and, as a result, the National Anti-Terrorism Coordination Center was created. Spain's 3/11 Commission called for this Center to do operational coordination as well as information collection and dissemination.<ref name=Archick>{{cite web\n | title = European Approaches to Homeland Security and Counterterrorism\n | url = https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/RL33573.pdf\n | first = Kristen\n | last  = Archick\n | publisher = Congressional Research Service\n | date = 2006-07-24\n | accessdate = 2007-11-05\n|format=PDF}}</ref> The military has organic counterintelligence to meet specific military needs.\n\n== Counterintelligence missions ==\n[[Frank Wisner]], a well-known CIA operations executive said of the autobiography of Director of Central Intelligence [[Allen W.

Threats have broadened to include threats from non-national or trans-national groups, including internal insurgents, organized crime, and transnational based groups (often called \"terrorists\", but that is limiting). Still, the FIS term remains the usual way of referring to the threat against which counterintelligence protects.\n\nIn modern practice, several missions are associated with counterintelligence from the national to the field level.\n* Defensive analysis is the practice of looking for vulnerabilities in one's own organization, and, with due regard for risk versus benefit, closing the discovered holes.\n* Offensive counterespionage is the set of techniques that at least neutralizes discovered FIS personnel and arrests them or, in the case of diplomats, expels them by declaring them [[persona non grata]]. Beyond that minimum, it exploits FIS personnel to gain intelligence for one's own side, or actively manipulates the FIS personnel to damage the hostile FIS organization.\n* Counterintelligence force protection source operations (CFSO) are human source operations, conducted abroad that are intended to fill the existing gap in national-level coverage in protecting a field station or force from terrorism and espionage.\n\nCounterintelligence is part of [[intelligence cycle security]], which, in turn, is part of [[intelligence cycle management]]. A variety of security disciplines also fall under intelligence security management and complement counterintelligence, including:\n* [[Physical security]]\n* [[Intelligence cycle security#Personnel security|Personnel security]]\n* [[Communications security]] (COMSEC)\n* [[Information security|Informations system security]] (INFOSEC)\n* [[Classified information|security classification]]\n* [[Operations security]] (OPSEC)\n\nThe disciplines involved in \"positive security,\" measures by which one's own society collects information on its actual or potential security, complement security. For example, when communications intelligence identifies a particular radio transmitter as one used only by a particular country, detecting that transmitter inside one's own country suggests the presence of a spy that counterintelligence should target. In particular, counterintelligence has a significant relationship with the collection discipline of [[HUMINT]] and at least some relationship with the others. Counterintelligence can both produce information and protect it.\n\nAll US departments and agencies with intelligence functions are responsible for their own security abroad, except those that fall under [[Chief of Mission]] authority.<ref name=Matschulat>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/docs/v13i2a05p_0001.htm \n |first=Austin B. \n |last=Matschulat \n |title=Coordination and Cooperation in Counerintelligence \n |date=1996-07-02 \n |accessdate=2007-11-03 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010091345/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/docs/v13i2a05p_0001.htm \n |archivedate=2007-10-10 \n}}</ref>\n\nGovernments try to protect three things:\n*Their personnel\n*Their installations\n*Their operations\n\nIn many governments, the responsibility for protecting these things is split. Historically, CIA assigned responsibility for protecting its personnel and operations to its Office of Security, while it assigned the security of operations to multiple groups within the Directorate of Operations: the counterintelligence staff and the area (or functional) unit, such as Soviet Russia Division. At one point, the counterintelligence unit operated quite autonomously, under the direction of [[James Jesus Angleton]]. Later, operational divisions had subordinate counterintelligence branches, as well as a smaller central counterintelligence staff. [[Aldrich Ames]] was in the Counterintelligence Branch of Europe Division, where he was responsible for directing the analysis of Soviet intelligence operations. US military services have had a similar and even more complex split.\n\nThis kind of division clearly requires close coordination, and this in fact occurs on a daily basis. The interdependence of the US counterintelligence community is also manifest in our relationships with liaison services. We cannot cut off these relationships because of concern about security, but experience has certainly shown that we must calculate the risks involved.<ref name = Matschulat/>\n\nOn the other side of the CI coin, counterespionage has one purpose that transcends all others in importance: penetration. The emphasis which the KGB places on penetration is evident in the cases already discussed from the defensive or security viewpoint. The best security system in the world cannot provide an adequate defense against it because the technique involves people. The only way to be sure that an enemy has been contained is to know his plans in advance and in detail.\n\n<blockquote>Moreover, only a high-level penetration of the opposition can tell you whether your own service is penetrated. A high-level defector can also do this, but the adversary knows that he defected and within limits can take remedial action. Conducting CE without the aid of penetrations is like fighting in the dark. Conducting CE with penetrations can be like [[shooting fish in a barrel]].<ref name=Matschulat /></blockquote>\n\nIn the British service, the cases of the [[Cambridge Five]], and the later suspicions about MI5 chief Sir [[Roger Hollis]] caused great internal dissension. Clearly, the British were penetrated by Philby, but it has never been determined, in any public forum, if there were other serious penetrations. In the US service, there was also significant disruption over the contradictory accusations about moles from defectors [[Anatoliy Golitsyn]] and [[Yuri Nosenko]], and their [[James Jesus Angleton#Golitsyn and Nosenko|respective supporters in CIA and the British Security Service (MI5)]]. Golitsyn was generally believed by Angleton. [[George Kisevalter]], the CIA operations officer that was the CIA side of the joint US-UK handling of [[Oleg Penkovsky]], did not believe Angleton's theory that Nosenko was a [[KGB]] plant. Nosenko had exposed [[John Vassall]], a [[KGB]] asset principally in the British Admiralty, but there were arguments Vassall was a KGB sacrifice to protect other operations, including Nosenko and a possibly more valuable source on the Royal Navy.\n\n=== Defensive counterintelligence ===\nDefensive counterintelligence starts by looking for places in one's own organization that could easily be exploited by foreign intelligence services (FIS). FIS is an established term of art in the counterintelligence community, and, in today's world, \"foreign\" is shorthand for \"opposing.\" Opposition might indeed be a country, but it could be a transnational group or an internal insurgent group. Operations against a FIS might be against one's own nation, or another friendly nation. The range of actions that might be done to support a friendly government can include a wide range of functions, certainly including military or counterintelligence activities, but also humanitarian aid and aid to development (\"nation building\").<ref name=JP3-07.1>{{cite web\n | url = https://fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/jp3_07_1.pdf\n | title = Joint Publication 3-07.1: Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Foreign Internal Defense (FID)\n | author =\n | date = 2004-04-30\n | accessdate = 2007-11-03\n|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nTerminology here is still emerging, and \"transnational group\" could include not only terrorist groups but also transnational criminal organization. Transnational criminal organizations include the drug trade, money laundering, extortion targeted against computer or communications systems, smuggling, etc.\n\n\"Insurgent\" could be a group opposing a recognized government by criminal or military means, as well as conducting clandestine intelligence and covert operations against the government in question, which could be one's own or a friendly one.\n\nCounterintelligence and counterterrorism analyses provide strategic assessments of foreign intelligence and terrorist groups and prepare tactical options for ongoing operations and investigations. Counterespionage may involve proactive acts against foreign intelligence services, such as [[double agent]]s, [[deception]], or recruiting foreign intelligence officers. While clandestine [[HUMINT]] sources can give the greatest insight into the adversary's thinking, they may also be most vulnerable to the adversary's attacks on one's own organization. Before trusting an enemy agent, remember that such people started out as being trusted by their own countries and may still be loyal to that country.\n\n=== Offensive counterintelligence operations ===\nWisner emphasized his own, and Dulles', views that the best defense against foreign attacks on, or infiltration of, intelligence services is active measures against those hostile services.<ref name=Wisner /> This is often called '''counterespionage''': measures taken to detect enemy espionage or physical attacks against friendly intelligence services, prevent damage and information loss, and, where possible, to turn the attempt back against its originator. Counterespionage goes beyond being reactive and actively tries to subvert hostile intelligence service, by recruiting agents in the foreign service, by discrediting personnel actually loyal to their own service, and taking away resources that would be useful to the hostile service. All of these actions apply to non-national threats as well as to national organizations.\n\nIf the hostile action is in one's own country or in a friendly one with co-operating police, the hostile agents may be arrested, or, if diplomats, declared [[persona non grata]]. From the perspective of one's own intelligence service, exploiting the situation to the advantage of one's side is usually preferable to arrest or actions that might result in the death of the threat. The intelligence priority sometimes comes into conflict with the instincts of one's own law enforcement organizations, especially when the foreign threat combines foreign personnel with citizens of one's country.\n\nIn some circumstances, arrest may be a first step in which the prisoner is given the choice of co-operating or facing severe consequence up to and including a death sentence for espionage. Co-operation may consist of telling all one knows about the other service but preferably actively assisting in deceptive actions against the hostile service.\n\n=== Counterintelligence protection of intelligence services ===\nDefensive counterintelligence specifically for intelligence services involves risk assessment of their culture, sources, methods and resources. Risk management must constantly reflect those assessments, since effective intelligence operations are often risk-taking. Even while taking calculated risks, the services need to mitigate risk with appropriate countermeasures.\n\nFIS are especially able to explore open societies and, in that environment, have been able to subvert insiders in the intelligence community. Offensive counterespionage is the most powerful tool for finding penetrators and neutralizing them, but it is not the only tool. Understanding what leads individuals to turn on their own side is the focus of Project Slammer. Without undue violations of personal privacy, systems can be developed to spot anomalous behavior, especially in the use of information systems.\n\nDecision makers require intelligence free from hostile control or manipulation. Since every intelligence discipline is subject to manipulation by our adversaries, validating the reliability of intelligence from all collection platforms is essential. Accordingly, each counterintelligence organization will validate the reliability of sources and methods that relate to the counterintelligence mission in accordance with common standards. For other mission areas, we will examine collection, analysis, dissemination practices, and other intelligence activities and will recommend improvements, best practices, and common standards.<ref name=NCIX>{{Cite web\n | url = https://fas.org/irp/ops/ci/cistrategy2007.pdf\n |format=PDF\n | title = National Counterintelligence Executive (NCIX)\n | year = 2007\n | postscript = <!--None-->\n}}</ref>\n\nIntelligence is vulnerable not only to external but also to internal threats. Subversion, treason, and leaks expose vulnerabilities, governmental and commercial secrets, and intelligence sources and methods.

Had an electronic system to detect anomalies in browsing through counterintelligence files been in place, [[Counterintelligence failures#Robert Hanssen|Robert Hanssen]]'s searches for suspicion of activities of his Soviet (and later Russian) paymasters might have surfaced early. Anomalies might simply show that an especially-creative analyst has a [[Intelligence analysis#Trained intuition|trained intuition]] possible connections and is trying to research them.\n\nAdding the new tools and techniques to [national arsenals], the counterintelligence community will seek to manipulate foreign spies, conduct aggressive investigations, make arrests and,\nwhere foreign officials are involved, expel them for engaging in practices inconsistent\nwith their diplomatic status or exploit them as an unwitting channel for deception, or turn them into witting double agents.<ref name=NCIX /> \"Witting\" is a term of intelligence art that indicates that one is not only aware of a fact or piece of information but also aware of its connection to intelligence activities.\n\n[[Victor Suvorov]], the pseudonym of a former Soviet military intelligence ([[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]]) officer, makes the point that a defecting HUMINT officer is a special threat to walk-in or other volunteer assets of the country that he is leaving. Volunteers who are \"warmly welcomed\" do not take into consideration the fact that they are despised by hostile intelligence agents.\n<blockquote>The Soviet operational officer, having seen a great deal of the ugly face of communism, very frequently feels the utmost repulsion to those who sell themselves to it willingly. And when a GRU or KGB officer decides to break with his criminal organization, something which fortunately happens quite often, the first thing he will do is try to expose the hated volunteer.<ref name=Suvorov-IM-04>{{Cite book\n | first = Victor | last = Suvorov\n | title = Inside Soviet Military Intelligence\n | url = http://militera.lib.ru/research/suvorov8/16.html\n | publisher = MacMillan Publishing Company\n | year = 1984\n | chapter = Chapter 4, Agent Recruiting\n | postscript = <!--None-->\n}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Counterintelligence force protection source operations ===\nAttacks against military, diplomatic, and related facilities are a very real threat, as demonstrated by the 1983 attacks against French and US peacekeepers in Beirut, the 1996 attack on the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, 1998 attacks on Colombian bases and on U.S. embassies (and local buildings) in Kenya and Tanzania the 2000 attack on the ''USS Cole'', and many others. The U.S. military force protection measures are the set of actions taken against military personnel and family members, resources, facilities and critical information, and most countries have a similar doctrine for protecting those facilities and conserving the potential of the forces. Force protection is defined to be a defense against deliberate attack, not accidents or natural disasters.\n\nCounterintelligence Force Protection Source Operations (CFSO) are human source operations, normally clandestine in nature, conducted abroad that are intended to fill the existing gap in national level coverage, as well as satisfying the combatant commander's intelligence requirements.<ref name=FM34-60>{{cite web\n | author = US Department of the Army\n | title = Field Manual 34-60: Counterintelligence\n | date = 1995-10-03\n | url = https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm34-60/\n | accessdate = 2007-11-04\n}}</ref> Military police and other patrols that mingle with local people may indeed be valuable HUMINT sources for counterintelligence awareness, but are not themselves likely to be CFSOs.

Although all intelligence disciplines can be used to gather force protection intelligence, HUMINT collected by intelligence and CI agencies plays a key role in providing indications and warning of terrorist and other force protection threats.<ref>{{cite web\n |last=US Department of Defense \n |authorlink=United States Department of Defense \n |title=Joint Publication 1-02 Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms \n |date=2007-07-12 \n |url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf \n |accessdate=2007-10-01 \n |format=PDF \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123014953/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf \n |archivedate=2008-11-23 \n}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nForce protection, for forces deployed in host countries, occupation duty, and even at home, may not be supported sufficiently by a national-level counterterrorism organization alone. In a country, colocating FPCI personnel, of all services, with military assistance and advisory units, allows agents to build relationships with host nation law enforcement and intelligence agencies, get to know the local environments, and improve their language skills. FPCI needs a legal domestic capability to deal with domestic terrorism threats.\n\nAs an example of terrorist planning cycles, the [[Khobar Towers]] attack shows the need for long-term FPCI. \"The Hizballah operatives believed to have conducted this attack began intelligence collection and planning activities in 1993. They recognized American military personnel were billeted at Khobar Towers in the fall of 1994 and began surveillance of the facility, and continued to plan, in June 1995. In March 1996, Saudi Arabian border guards arrested a Hizballah member attempting plastic explosive into the country, leading to the arrest of two more Hizballah members. Hizballah leaders recruited replacements for those arrested, and continued planning for the attack.\"<ref>{{Cite web\n  | last = Imbus\n  | first = Michael T\n  | title = Identifying Threats: Improving Intelligence and Counterintelligence Support to Force Protection\n  | date = April 2002\n  | id = USAFCSC-Imbus-2002\n  | url = http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/acsc/02-059.pdf\n  |format=PDF| accessdate = 2007-11-03\n  | postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>\n\n==Defensive counterintelligence operations==\n\nIn U.S. doctrine, although not necessarily that of other countries, CI is now seen as primarily a counter to FIS [[HUMINT]]. In the 1995 US Army counterintelligence manual, CI had a broader scope against the various intelligence collection disciplines. Some of the overarching CI tasks are described as\n:#Developing, maintaining, and disseminating multidiscipline threat data and intelligence files on organizations, locations, and individuals of CI interest. This includes insurgent and terrorist infrastructure and individuals who can assist in the CI mission.\n:#Educating personnel in all fields of security. A component of this is the multidiscipline threat briefing. Briefings can and should be tailored, both in scope and classification level. Briefings could then be used to familiarize supported commands with the nature of the multidiscipline threat posed against the command or activity.\n\nMore recent US joint intelligence doctrine<ref>{{cite web\n  | author = Joint Chiefs of Staff\n  | authorlink = Joint Chiefs of Staff\n  | title = Joint Publication 2-0: Intelligence\n  | date = 2007-06-22\n  | id = US JP 2-0\n  | url = https://fas.org/irp/doddir/dod/jp2_0.pdf\n  | accessdate = 2007-11-05|format=PDF}}</ref> restricts its primary scope to counter-HUMINT, which usually includes counter-terror. It is not always clear, under this doctrine, who is responsible for all intelligence collection threats against a military or other resource. The full scope of US military counterintelligence doctrine has been moved to a classified publication, Joint Publication (JP) 2-01.2, ''Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence Support to Joint Operations''.\n\nMore specific countermeasures against intelligence collection disciplines are listed below\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n<caption>CI roles against Intelligence Collection Disciplines, 1995 doctrine<ref name=\"FM34-60\"/></caption>\n|-\n!

There is an additional category relevant to the broad spectrum of counterintelligence: why one becomes a terrorist.\n\nThe acronym '''MICE''':\n: '''M'''oney\n: '''I'''deology\n: '''C'''ompromise (or coercion)\n: '''E'''go\ndescribes the most common reasons people break trust and disclose classified materials, reveal operations to hostile services, or join terrorist groups. It makes sense, therefore, to monitor trusted personnel for risks in these areas, such as financial stress, extreme political views, potential vulnerabilities for blackmail, and excessive need for approval or intolerance of criticism. With luck, problems in an employee can be caught early, assistance can be provided to correct them, and not only is espionage avoided, but a useful employee retained. See [[Motives for spying]] for specific examples.\n\nSometimes, the preventive and neutralization tasks overlap, as in the case of [[Earl Edwin Pitts]]. Pitts had been an FBI agent who had sold secret information to the Soviets, and, after the fall of the USSR, to the Russians. He was caught by an FBI false flag sting, in which FBI agents, posing as Russian FSB agents, came to Pitts with an offer to \"reactivate\" him. His activities seemed motivated by both money and ego over perceived bad treatment when he was an FBI agent. His sentence required him to tell the FBI all he knew of foreign agents. Ironically, he told them of suspicious actions by [[Robert Hanssen]], which were not taken seriously at the time.\n\n==== Motivations for information and operations disclosure ====\n\nTo go beyond slogans, Project Slammer was an effort of the Intelligence Community Staff, under the Director of Central Intelligence, to come up with characteristics of an individual likely to commit espionage against the United States.\nIt \"examines espionage by interviewing and psychologically assessing actual espionage subjects. Additionally, persons knowledgeable of subjects are contacted to better understand the subjects' private lives and how they are perceived by others while conducting espionage.\"<ref name=Slammer1990>{{Cite web\n | title = Project Slammer Interim Progress Report\n | last = Intelligence Community Staff\n | date = 12 April 1990\n | url =http://antipolygraph.org/documents/slammer-12-04-1990.shtml\n | accessdate = 2007-11-04\n | postscript = <!--None-->\n}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n<caption>How an espionage subject sees himself (at the time of espionage)</caption>\n|-\n!

The process that evolves into espionage reduces barriers, making it essentially \"Okay\" to initiate the crime.\n\n&ndash; They see espionage as a \"Victimless\" crime.\n\n&ndash; Once they consider espionage, they figure out how it might be done. These are mutually reinforcing, often simultaneous events.\n\n&ndash; Subject finds that it is easy to go around security safeguards (or is able to solve that problem). They belittle the security system, feeling that if the information was really important espionage would be hard to do (the information would really be better protected). This \"Ease of accomplishment\" further reinforces resolve.\n|-\n| Attempts to cope with espionage activity\n|&ndash; Anxious on initial hostile intelligence service contact (some also feel thrill and excitement).\n\n&ndash; After a relationship with espionage activity and HOIS develops, the process becomes much more bearable, espionage continues  (even flourishes).\n\n&ndash; In the course of long-term activity, subjects may reconsider their involvement.\n\n&ndash; Some consider breaking their role to become an operative for the government. This occurs when access to classified information is lost or there is a perceived need to prove themselves or both.\n\n&ndash; Others find that espionage activity becomes stressful, they no longer want it. Glamour (if present earlier) subsides. They are reluctant to continue. They may even break contact.\n\n&ndash; Sometimes they consider telling authorities what they have done. Those wanting to reverse their role aren't confessing, they're negotiating. Those who are \"Stressed out\" want to confess. Neither wants punishment. Both attempt to minimize or avoid punishment.\n|}\n\nAccording to a press report about Project Slammer and Congressional oversight of counterespionage, one fairly basic function is observing one's own personnel for behavior that either suggests that they could be targets for foreign HUMINT, or may already have been subverted. News reports indicate that in hindsight, red flags were flying but not noticed.<ref name=Stein>{{Cite journal\n | title = The Mole's Manual\n | last = Stein\n | first = Jeff\n | date = July 5, 1994\n | journal = New York Times\n | url =https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/05/opinion/the-mole-s-manual.html?pagewanted=print\n | accessdate = 2007-11-04\n | postscript = <!--None-->\n}}</ref> In several major penetrations of US services, such as [[Aldrich Ames]], the Walker ring or [[Robert Hanssen]], the individual showed patterns of spending inconsistent with their salary.

They emphasize the <blockquote>essential and multi-faceted motivational patterns underlying espionage. Future Slammer analyses will focus on newly developing issues in espionage such as the role of money, the new dimensions of loyalty and what seems to be a developing trend toward economic espionage.</blockquote>\n\n===Counter-SIGINT (Signals Intelligence)===\n\nMilitary and security organizations will provide secure communications, and may [[Signals intelligence#Monitoring friendly communications|monitor]] less secure systems, such as commercial telephones or general Internet connections, to detect inappropriate information being passed through them. Education on the need to use secure communications, and instruction on using them properly so that they do not become vulnerable to [[Transmission security|specialized technical interception]].\n\n===Counter-IMINT (Imagery Intelligence)===\nThe basic methods of countering IMINT are to know when the opponent will use imaging against one's own side, and interfering with the taking of images. In some situations, especially in free societies, it must be accepted that public buildings may always be subject to photography or other techniques.\n\nCountermeasures include putting visual shielding over sensitive targets or camouflaging them. When countering such threats as imaging satellites, awareness of the orbits can guide security personnel to stop an activity, or perhaps cover the sensitive parts, when the satellite is overhead. This also applies to imaging on aircraft and UAVs, although the more direct expedient of shooting them down, or attacking their launch and support area, is an option in wartime.\n\n===Counter-OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)===\nWhile the concept well precedes the recognition of a discipline of [[OSINT]], the idea of [[Censorship#Censorship of state secrets and prevention of attention|censorship of material directly relevant to national security]] is a basic OSINT defense. In democratic societies, even in wartime, censorship must be watched carefully lest it violate reasonable freedom of the press, but the balance is set differently in different countries and at different times.\n\nThe [[United Kingdom]] is generally considered to have a very free press, but there is the [[DA-Notice|DA-Notice, formerly D-notice]] system. Many British journalists find that the system is used fairly, but there will always be arguments. In the specific context of counterintelligence, note that [[Peter Wright (MI5 officer)|Peter Wright]], a former senior member of the [[MI5|Security Service]] who left their service without his pension, moved to [[Australia]] before publishing his book [[Spycatcher]]. While much of the book was reasonable commentary, it revealed some specific and sensitive techniques, such as [[Operation RAFTER]], a means of detecting the existence and setting of radio receivers.\n\n===Counter-MASINT (Measurement and Signature Intelligence)===\nMASINT is mentioned here for completeness, but the discipline contains so varied a range of technologies that a type-by-type strategy is beyond the current scope. One example, however, can draw on the [[Operation RAFTER]] technique revealed in Wright's book. With the knowledge that [[Radiofrequency MASINT]] was being used to pick up an internal frequency in radio receivers, it would be possible to design a shielded receiver that would not radiate the signal that RAFTER monitored.\n\n==Theory of offensive counterintelligence==\nOffensive techniques in current counterintelligence doctrine are principally directed against human sources, so counterespionage can be considered a synonym for offensive counterintelligence. At the heart of exploitation operations is the objective to degrade the effectiveness of an adversary's intelligence service or a terrorist organization. Offensive counterespionage (and counterterrorism) is done one of two ways, either by manipulating the adversary (FIS or terrorist) in some manner or by disrupting the adversary's normal operations.\n\nDefensive counterintelligence operations that succeed in breaking up a clandestine network by arresting the persons involved or by exposing their actions demonstrate that disruption is quite measurable and effective against FIS if the right actions are taken. If defensive counterintelligence stops terrorist attacks, it has succeeded.\n\nOffensive counterintelligence seeks to damage the long-term capability of the adversary. If it can lead a national adversary into putting large resources into protecting from a nonexistent threat, or if it can lead terrorists to assume that all of their \"sleeper\" agents in a country have become unreliable and must be replaced (and possibly killed as security risks), there is a greater level of success than can be seen from defensive operations alone, To carry out offensive counterintelligence, however, the service must do more than detect; it must manipulate persons associated with the adversary.\n\nThe Canadian Department of National Defence makes some useful logical distinctions in its Directive on its<ref name=DND-8002-2>{{Cite web\n | url = http://www.admfincs.forces.gc.ca/admfincs/subjects/daod/8002/2_e.asp\n | title = Canadian Forces National Counter-Intelligence Unit\n | accessdate = 2007-11-19\n | date = 2003-03-28\n | id = Canada-DND-DAOD 8002-2\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071121153316/http://www.admfincs.forces.gc.ca/admfincs/subjects/daod/8002/2_e.asp\n | archive-date = 2007-11-21\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref>\nNational Counter-Intelligence Unit. The terminology is not the same as used by other services, but the distinctions are useful:\n:#\"Counter-intelligence (''contre-ing\u00e9rence'') means activities concerned with identifying and counteracting threats to the security of DND employees, CF members, and DND and CF property and information, that are posed by hostile intelligence services, organizations or individuals, who are or may be engaged in espionage, sabotage, subversion, terrorist activities, organized crime or other criminal activities.\" This corresponds to defensive counterintelligence in other services.\n:#\"Security intelligence  (''renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9'') means intelligence on the identity, capabilities and intentions of hostile intelligence services, organizations or individuals, who are or may be engaged in espionage, sabotage, subversion, terrorist activities, organized crime or other criminal activities.\" This does ''not'' (''emphasis added'') correspond directly to offensive counterintelligence, but is the intelligence preparation necessary to conduct offensive counterintelligence.\n:#The duties of the Canadian Forces National Counter-Intelligence Unit include \"identifying, investigating and countering threats to the security of the DND and the CF from espionage, sabotage, subversion, terrorist activities, and other criminal activity; identifying, investigating and countering the actual or possible compromise of highly classified or special DND or CF material; conducting CI security investigations, operations and security briefings and debriefings to counter threats to, or to preserve, the security of DND and CF interests.\"  This mandate is a good statement of a mandate to conduct offensive counterintelligence.\n\nDND further makes the useful clarification,<ref name=DND8002-3>{{Cite web\n | url = http://www.admfincs.forces.gc.ca/admfincs/subjects/daod/8002/3_e.asp\n | title = Security Intelligence Liaison Program\n | accessdate = 2007-11-19\n | date = 2003-03-28\n | id = Canada-DND-DAOD 8002-3\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071130193223/http://www.admfincs.forces.gc.ca/admfincs/subjects/daod/8002/3_e.asp\n | archive-date = 2007-11-30\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref>\n\"The security intelligence process ''should not be confused with'' the liaison conducted by members of the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service (CFNIS) for the purpose of ''obtaining criminal intelligence,'' as the collection of this type of information is within their mandate.\"\n\nManipulating an intelligence professional, himself trained in counterintelligence, is no easy task, unless he is already predisposed toward the opposing side. Any effort that does not start with a sympathetic person will take a long-term commitment, and creative thinking to overcome the defenses of someone who knows he is a counterintelligence target and also knows counterintelligence techniques.\n\nTerrorists on the other hand, although they engage in deception as a function of security appear to be more prone to manipulation or deception by a well-placed adversary than are foreign intelligence services. This is in part due to the fact that many terrorist groups, whose members \"often mistrust and fight among each other, disagree, and vary in conviction.\", are not as internally cohesive as foreign intelligence services, potentially leaving them more vulnerable to both deception and manipulation.\n\nA person willing to take on an offensive counterintelligence role, especially when not starting as a professional member of a service, can present in many ways. A person may be attracted by careful nurturing of a sense that someone may want to act against service A, or may be opportunistic: a walk-in or write-in.\n\nOpportunistic acquisition, as of a walk-in, has the disadvantage of being unexpected and therefore unplanned for: the decision to run a double agent should be made only after a great deal of thought, assessment, and evaluation, and if the candidate comes as a volunteer, the service may have to act without sufficient time for reflection. In this situation the necessity of assessing the candidate conflicts also with the preservation of security, particularly if the officer approached is in covert status. Volunteers and walk-ins are tricky customers, and the possibility of provocation is always present. On the other hand, some of our best operations have been made possible by volunteers. The test of the professional skill of an intelligence organization is its ability to handle situations of this type.<ref name=Begoum>{{Cite journal\n | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol6no1/pdf/v06i1a05p.pdf\n | title = Observations on the Double Agent\n | date = 18 September 1995\n | first = F.M.\n | last = Begoum\n | journal = Studies in Intelligence\n | accessdate = 2007-11-03\n| postscript = <!--None-->\n}}</ref>\n\nWhen an agent candidate appears, judgments are needed on four essential questions to decide if a potential operation makes sense, if the candidate is the right person for the operation, and if one's own service can support the operation.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n<caption>Deciding if a candidate is viable</caption>\n|-\n! Question\n! Answer\n|-\n| Has he told you everything?\n| Enough information can ordinarily be obtained in one or two sessions with the candidate to permit testing by polygraph, investigation of leads, and file checks. These steps must be taken very quickly because it is not possible to un-recruit a man. The two areas of possible concealment which are especially dangerous are prior intelligence ties and side-commo.\n|-\n| Does he have stayability?\n| This term combines two concepts\u2014his ability to maintain access to the counterintelligence target for the foreseeable future, and his psychological stamina under the constant (and sometimes steadily increasing) pressure of the double agent's role. If he lacks stayability he may still be useful, but the operation must then be planned for short range.\n|-\n| Does the adversary trust him?\n|Indications of adversary trust can be found in the level of the communications system given him, his length of service, the seniority of the adversary case officer, the nature and level of requirements, and the kind and extent of training provided. If the opposition keeps the agent at arm's length, there is little prospect that doubling him will yield significant returns.\n|-\n| Can you control his communications both ways?\n| Control of communications on your own side can be difficult enough, especially if the agent lives in hostile territory. But control of adversary channels is hard under even the best of circumstances. It requires a great deal of time, technical skill, and\u2014as a rule, manpower.\n|}\n\nNegative answers on one or even two of these questions are not ground for immediate rejection of the possible operation. But they are ground for requiring some unusually high entries on the credit side of the ledger.\n\nThe initial assessment comes from friendly debriefing or interview. The interviewing officer may be relaxed and casual, but underneath the surface his attitude is one of deliberate purpose: he is trying to find out enough to make an initial judgment of the man sensing the subject's motivations, emotional state and mental processes.\n\nFor instance, if an agent walks in, says he is a member of another service, and reveals information so sensitive that the other service would surely not give it away just to establish the informant's bona fides, there are two possibilities:\n:*either the agent is telling the truth\n:*he is attempting a provocation\nSometimes, the manner in which the man conducts himself will suggest which of the two it is. In addition to establishing the individual's true identity and examining his documents, there is also a need to gain information on the walk-in's service.\n\nIt may be more difficult to determine the reason why the agent presented himself than to establish who he is and what service he represents, because motivation is a complex of mental and emotional drives. The question of the double agent's motivation is approached by the interviewing officer from two angles:\n:*the agent's professed reasons\n:*the officer's own inferences from his story and behavior.\n\nIf a recruit speaks of a high regard for democratic ideology, but casual conversation about Western history and politics may reveal that the potential double agent really has no understanding of democracy, then ideology may not be the real reason why he is willing to cooperate. While it is possible that such an individual created a romanticized fantasy of democracy, it is more likely that he is saying what he thinks the CI officer wants to hear. CI officers should make it comfortable for the agent to mention more base motivations: money or revenge. It can be informative to leave such things as luxury catalogs where the agent can see them, and observe if he reacts with desire, repugnance, or disbelief.\n\nTo decide between what the officer thinks the motive is and what the agent says it is not easy, because double agents act out of a wide variety of motivations, sometimes psychopathic ones like a masochistic desire for punishment by both services. Others have financial, religious, political, or vindictive motives.   The last are often the best double agents: they get pleasure out of deceiving their comrades by their every act day after day.<ref name = Begoum/>\n\nMaking the judgment about the agent's psychological and physical suitability is also difficult. Sometimes a psychologist or psychiatrist can be called in under some pretext. Such professionals, or a well-trained CI officer, may recognize signs of [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic personality disorder]] in potential double agents. From the point of view of the double agent operation, here are their key traits:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n<caption>Characteristics of sociopaths</caption>\n|-\n| They are unusually calm and stable under stress but cannot tolerate routine or boredom\n| They do not form lasting and adult emotional relationships with other people because their attitude toward others is exploitative\n|-\n| They have above-average intelligence. They are good verbalizers\u2014sometimes in two or more languages\n| They are skeptical and even cynical about the motives and abilities of others but have exaggerated notions about their own competence.\n|-\n| Their reliability as agents is largely determined by the extent to which the case officer's instructions coincide with what they consider their own best interests.\n| They are ambitious only in a short range sense: they want much and they want it now. They do not have the patience to plod toward a distant reward.\n|-\n| They are naturally clandestine and enjoy secrecy and deception for its own sake.\n|\n|}\nThe candidate must be considered as a person and the operation as a potential. Possibilities which would otherwise be rejected out of hand can be accepted if the counterintelligence service is or will be in a position to obtain and maintain an independent view of both the double agent and the case.\n\nThe estimate of the potential value of the operation must take into consideration whether his service has the requisite personnel, facilities, and technical support; whether running the operation will prejudice other activities of his government; whether it will be necessary or desirable, at the outset or later, to share the case with foreign liaison; and whether the case has political implications.\n\n==Types of offensive counterespionage operations==\n\nA subject of offensive counterintelligence starts with a loyalty to one service. In these examples:\n:*Service A: Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) or non-national group\n::*Service A1: a client, supporting organization, or ally of A\n:*Service B: One's own or an allied service\n::*Service B1: a client, supporting organization, or ally of B\n:*Service C: A third country's service, which, in this context, should be assumed to be neutral.\n\nDouble agents and defectors start out being loyal to service B, which immediately creates the potential for emotional conflict. False flag operations also have the potential for conflict, as these operations recruit people who believe they are working for service C, but they have not been told the truth: they are actually working for service A or B, depending on the nature of the operation.\n\n===Mole===\n\nMoles start out as loyal to service A, but may or may not be a trained intelligence officer of that service. Indeed, those that are not trained, but volunteer to penetrate a FIS, may either not understand the risk, or are tremendously brave individuals, highly motivated against Country B and willing to risk its retaliation if their limited preparation reveals their true affiliation.\n\n:Starts in A\n:Joins B\n:Transmits to A or disrupts operations until leaves or disrupted\n\nNote that some intelligence professionals reserve mole to refer to enemy personnel that personally know important things about enemy intelligence operations, technology, or military plans. A person such as a clerk or courier, who photographs many documents but is not really in a position to explore enemy thinking, is more generically an asset. To be clear, all moles are assets, but not all assets are moles.\n\nOne of the more difficult methods involves having the would-be-mole \"dangled\" \u2013 that is luring the adversary intelligence service (or terrorist group) to recruit the opposition's clandestine intelligence officer who is posing as a \"walk-in\" (someone who voluntarily offers information) \u2013 in the hopes that the adversary will unknowingly take the bait.\n\nAnother special case is a \"deep cover\" or \"sleeper\" mole, who may enter a service, possibly at a young age, but definitely not reporting or doing anything that would attract suspicion, until reaching a senior position.  [[Kim Philby]] is an example of an agent actively recruited by Britain while he was already committed to Communism.\n\n===False-flag penetrator===\n\nA special case is a false-flag recruitment of a penetrator:\n\n:Starts in C\n:Believes being recruited by A\n:Actually is recruited by B and sends false information to C\n\n===Defector===\n\nAn individual may want to leave their service at once, perhaps from high-level disgust, or low-level risk of having been discovered in financial irregularities and is just ahead of arrest. Even so, the defector certainly brings knowledge with him, and may be able to bring documents or other materials of value.\n\n:Starts in A\n:Leaves and goes to B\n\n===Defector in place===\n\nAnother method is to directly recruit an intelligence officer (or terrorist member) from within the ranks of the adversary service (terrorist group) and having that officer (terrorist) maintain their normal duties while spying on their parent service (organization); this is also referred to as recruiting an \"agent\" or defector in place.<ref name = Gleghorn/>\n\n:Starts in A\n:Stays working in A but reporting to B\n\n===Double agent===\n\nBefore even considering double agent operations, a service has to consider its own resources. Managing that agent will take skill and sophistication, both at the local/case officer and central levels. Complexity goes up astronomically when the service cannot put physical controls on its doubles, as did the [[Double Cross System]] in [[World War II]].\n\nFrom beginning to end, a DA operation must be most carefully planned, executed, and above all, [[#Protecting your own service|reported]]. The amount of detail and administrative backstopping seems unbearable at times in such matters. But since penetrations are always in short supply, and defectors can tell less and less of what we need to know as time goes on, because of their cut-off dates, double agents will continue to be part of the scene.<ref name=Matschulat/>\n\nServices functioning abroad\u2014and particularly those operating in areas where the police powers are in neutral or hostile hands&mdash;need professional subtlety as well.<ref name = Begoum/> Case officers must know the agent's area and have a nuanced understanding of his language; this is an extremely unwise situation for using interpreters, since the case officer needs to sense the emotional content of the agent's communication and match it with the details of the information flowing in both directions. Depending on whether the operation is being run in one's own country, an allied country, or hostile territory, the case officer needs to know the relevant laws. Even in friendly territory, the case officer needs both liaison with, and knowledge of, the routine law enforcement and security units in the area, so the operation is not blown because an ordinary policeman gets suspicious and brings the agent in for questioning.\n\nThe most preferable situation is that the service running the double agent have complete control of communications. When communications were by Morse code, each operator had a unique rhythm of keying, called a \"fist\". MASINT techniques of the time recognized individual operators, so it was impossible to substitute a different operator than the agent. The agent also could make deliberate and subtle changes in his keying, to alert his side that he had been turned. While Morse is obsolete, voices are very recognizable and resistant to substitution. Even text communication can have patterns of grammar or word choice, known to the agent and his original service, that can hide a warning of capture.\n\nFull knowledge of [the agent's] past (and especially of any prior intelligence associations), a solid grasp of his behavior pattern (both as an individual and as a member of a national grouping), and rapport in the relationship with him.\n\nThe discovery of an adversary intelligence officer who has succeeded in penetrating one's own organization offers the penetrated intelligence service the possibility of \"turning\" this officer in order to use him as a \"double agent\". The way a double agent case starts deeply affects the operation throughout its life. Almost all of them begin in one of the three ways following:\n:*Walk-in or talk-in\n:*Detected and doubled, usually under duress\n:*Provocation agent\n\n'''Double agent'''\n:Starts in A\n:Recruited by B\n:Defects and tells B all he knows (defector)\n::operates in place (Agent [[#Doubled in place|doubled in place]]) and continues to tell B about A\n\n'''False flag double agent'''\n:Starts in A\n:Assigned to C\n:B creates a situation where agent believes he is talking to C, when actually receiving B disinformation\n'''Active penetrator'''\n:Starts in A and is actually loyal to A\n:Goes to B, says he works for A, but wants to switch sides. Gives B access to his communications channel with A\n:Keeps second communications channel, X with A, about which B knows nothing\n::Reports operational techniques of B to A via X\n::Provides disinformation from A to B via X\n\n'''[[#Passive provocateur|Passive Provocateur]]'''\n:A does an analysis of C and determines what targets would be attractive to B\n:A then recruits citizens of C, which A believes will be more loyal to B\n:The A recruit, a citizen of C, volunteers to B\n:A can then expose B's penetration of C, hurting B-C relations.\n\nThis may be extremely difficult to accomplish, and even if accomplished the real difficulty is maintaining control of this \"turned asset\". Controlling an enemy agent who has been turned is a many-faceted and complex exercise that essentially boils down to making certain that the agent's new-found loyalty remains consistent, which means determining whether the \"doubled\" agent's turning is genuine or false. However, this process can be quite convoluted and fraught with uncertainty and suspicion.\n\nWhere it concerns terrorist groups, a terrorist who betrays his organization can be thought of and run as a double-agent against the terrorist's \"parent\" organization in much the same fashion as an intelligence officer from a foreign intelligence service. Therefore, for sake of ease, wherever double-agents are discussed the methodologies generally apply to activities conducted against terrorist groups as well.<ref name = Gleghorn/>\n\nA double agent is a person who engages in clandestine activity for two intelligence or security services (or more in joint operations), who provides information about one or about each to the other, and who wittingly withholds significant information from one on the instructions of the other or is unwittingly manipulated by one so that significant facts are withheld from the adversary. Peddlers, fabricators, and others who work for themselves rather than a service are not double agents because they are not agents. The fact that doubles have an agent relationship with both sides distinguishes them from penetrations, who normally are placed with the target service in a staff or officer capacity.\n\nThe unwitting double agent is an extremely rare bird. The manipulative skill required to deceive an agent into thinking that he is serving the adversary when in fact he is damaging its interests is plainly of the highest order.\n\nFor predictive purposes the most important clue embedded in the origins of an operation is the agent's original or primary affiliation, whether it was formed voluntarily or not, the length of its duration, and its intensity. The effects of years of clandestine association with the adversary are deep and subtle; the Service B case officer working with a double agent of service A is characterized by an ethnicity or religion may find those bonds run deep, even if the agent hates the government of A. The service B officer may care deeply for the double.\n\nAnother result of lengthy prior clandestine service is that the agent may be hard to control in most operations the case officer's superior training and experience give him so decided an edge over the agent that recognition of this superiority makes the agent more tractable. But add to the fact that the experienced double agent may have been in the business longer than his U.S. control his further advantage in having gained a first-hand comparative knowledge of the workings of at least two disparate services, and the case officer's margin of superiority diminishes, vanishes, or even is reversed.\n\nOne facet of the efforts to control a double agent operation is to ensure that the double agent is protected from discovery by the parent intelligence service; this is especially true in circumstances where the double agent is a defector-in-place.\n\nLike all other intelligence operations, double agent cases are run to protect and enhance the national security. They serve this purpose principally by providing current counterintelligence about hostile intelligence and security services and about clandestine subversive activities. The service and officer considering a double agent possibility must weigh net national advantage thoughtfully, never forgetting that a double agent is, in effect, a condoned channel of communication with the enemy.\n\n====Doubled in place====\n\nA service discovering an adversary agent may offer him employment as a double. His agreement, obtained under open or implied duress, is unlikely, however, to be accompanied by a genuine switch of loyalties. The so-called redoubled agent whose duplicity in doubling for another service has been detected by his original sponsor and who has been persuaded to reverse his affections again also belongs to this dubious class. Many detected and doubled agents degenerate into what are sometimes called \"piston agents\" or \"mailmen,\" who change their attitudes with their visas as they shunt from side to side.\n\nOperations based on them are little more than unauthorized liaison with the enemy, and usually time-wasting exercises in futility. A notable exception is the detected and unwillingly doubled agent who is relieved to be found out in his enforced service to the adversary.\n\n====Active provocateur====\nThere can be active and passive provocation agents. A double agent may serve as a means through which a provocation can be mounted against a person, an organization, an intelligence or security service, or any affiliated group to induce action to its own disadvantage. The provocation might be aimed at identifying members of the other service, at diverting it to less important objectives, at tying up or wasting its assets and facilities, at sowing dissension within its ranks, at inserting false data into its files to mislead it, at building up in it a tainted file for a specific purpose, at forcing it to surface an activity it wanted to keep hidden, or at bringing public discredit on it, making it look like an organization of idiots. The Soviets and some of the Satellite services, the Poles in particular, are extremely adept in the art of conspiratorial provocation. All kinds of mechanisms have been used to mount provocation operations; the double agent is only one of them.\n\nAn active one is sent by Service A to Service B to tell B that he works for A but wants to switch sides. Or he may be a talk-in rather than a walk-in. In any event, the significant information that he is withholding, in compliance with A's orders, is the fact that his offer is being made at A's instigation. He is also very likely to conceal one channel of communication with A-for example, a second secret writing system. Such \"side-commo\" enables A to keep in full touch while sending through the divulged communications channel only messages meant for adversary eyes. The provocateur may also conceal his true sponsor, claiming for example (and truthfully) to represent an A1 service (allied with A) whereas his actual control is the A.\n\n====Passive provocateur====\nPassive provocations are variants involving false-flag recruiting.\n\nIn Country C, Service A surveys the intelligence terrain through the eyes of Service B (a species of mirror-reading) and selects those citizens whose access to sources and other qualifications make them most attractive to B. Service A officers, posing as service B officers, recruit the citizens of country C. At some point, service A then exposes these individuals, and complains to country C that country B is subverting its citizens.\n\nThe stake-out has a far better chance of success in areas like Africa, where intelligence exploitation of local resources is far less intensive than in Europe, where persons with valuable access are likely to have been approached repeatedly by recruiting services during the postwar years.<ref name = Begoum/>\n\n====Multiply turned agent====\n\nA triple agent can be a double agent that decides his true loyalty is to his original service or could always have been loyal to his service but is part of an active provocation of your service. If managing a double agent is difficult, agents that turned again (tripled) or another time after that are far more difficult but, in some rare cases, worthwhile.\n\nAny service B controlling or believing that it controls a double agent must constantly evaluate the information that agent is providing on service A. While service A may have been willing to sacrifice meaningful information or even other human assets, to help an intended penetration agent establish his bona fides, at some point, service A may start providing useless or misleading information as part of the goal of service A. In the World War II [[Double Cross System]], another way that the British controllers (service B in this example) kept the Nazis believing in their agent, was that the British let true information flow but too late for the Germans to act on it. The double agent might send information indicating that a lucrative target was in range of a German submarine, but by the time the information reaches the Germans, they confirm the report was true because the ship is now docked in a safe port that would have been a logical destination on the course reported by the agent.<ref>{{cite book\n | first = Anthony Cave\n | last = Brown\n | title = Bodyguard of Lies: The Extraordinary True Story Behind D-Day\n | year = 1975\n}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Double Cross System actively handled the double agent, the information sent to the Germans was part of the overall [[Operation Bodyguard]] deception program of the [[London Controlling Section]]. Operation Bodyguard was meant to convince the Germans that the Allies planned their main invasion at one of several places, none of which was Normandy. As long as the Germans found the deceptions credible, as occurred, they reinforced the other locations. Even when the large landings came at Normandy, deception operations continued to convince the Germans that [[Operation Neptune]] at Normandy was a feint and so they held back their strategic reserves. When it had become apparent that Normandy was indeed the main invasions, the strategic reserves had been under heavy air attack, and the lodgment was sufficiently strong that the reduced reserves could not push it back.\n\nThere are other benefits to analyzing the exchange of information between the double agent and his original service, such as learning the priorities of service A through the information requests they are sending to an individual they believe is working for them. If the requests all turn out to be for information that service B could not use against A, and it becomes a pattern, service A may have realized their agent has been turned.\n\nSince maintaining control over double agents is tricky at best, it is not hard to see how problematic this methodology can become. The potential for multiple turnings of agents and perhaps worse, the turning of one's own intelligence officers, especially those working within counterintelligence itself, poses a serious risk to any intelligence service wishing to employ these techniques. That may be the reason that triple-agent operations appear not to have been undertaken by US counterintelligence in some espionage cases that have come to light in recent years, particularly among those involving high-level penetrations.\n\nAlthough the arrest and prosecution of [[Aldrich Ames]] of the CIA and [[Robert Hanssen]] of the FBI, both of whom were senior counterintelligence officers in their respective agencies who volunteered to spy for the Russians, hardly qualifies as conclusive evidence that triple-agent operations were not attempted throughout the community writ large, both cases suggest that neutralization operations may be the preferred method of handling adversary double agent operations vice the more aggressive exploitation of these potential triple-agent sources.<ref name = Gleghorn/>\n\n'''Triple agent'''\n:Starts out working for B\n:Volunteers to be a defector-in-place for A\n:Discovered by B\n:Offers his communications with A to B, so B may gain operational data about A and send disinformation to A\n\nA concern with triple agents, of course, is if they have changed loyalties twice, why not a third or even more times? Consider a variant where the agent remains fundamentally loyal to B\n\n'''Quadruple agent'''\n:Starts out working for B\n:Volunteers to be a defector-in-place for A. Works out a signal by which he can inform A that B has discovered and is controlling him\n:Discovered by B\n:Offers his communications with A to B.\n::B actually gets disinformation about A's operational techniques\n::A learns what B wants to know, such as potential vulnerabilities of A, which A will then correct\n\nSuccesses such as the British Double Cross System or the German [[Operation North Pole]] show that such of operations are indeed feasible. Therefore, despite the obviously very risky and extremely-complex nature of double agent operations, the potentially quite lucrative intelligence windfall, the disruption or deception of an adversary service, makes them an inseparable component of exploitation operations.<ref name=\"Gleghorn\"/>\n\nIf a double agent wants to come home to Service A, how can he offer a better way to redeem himself than recruiting the Service B case officer that was running his double agent case, essentially redoubling the direction of the operation? If the case officer refuses, that is apt to be the end of the operation. If the attempt fails, of course, the whole operation has to be terminated. A creative agent can tell his case office, even if he had not been tripled, that he had been loyal all along, and the case officer would at best be revealed as a fool.\n\nOccasionally, a service runs a double agent whom it knows to be under the control of the other service and so has little ability to manipulate or even one who it knows has been successfully redoubled. The question for a service to do so is valid. One reason for sometimes doing so humanitarian: when the other service has gained physical control of the agent by apprehending him in a denied area, the operation can be continued even if it is known that he has been doubled back because it is desirable to keep him alive if possible.\n\nAnother reason might be a desire to determine how the other service conducts its double agent operations or what it uses for operational build-up or deception material and from what level it is disseminated. There might be other advantages, such as deceiving the opposition as to the service's own capabilities, skills, intentions, etc. Perhaps, the service might want to continue running the known redoubled agent to conceal other operations. It might want to tie up the facilities of the opposition. It might use the redoubled agent as an adjunct in a provocation being run against the opposition elsewhere.\n\nRunning a known redoubled agent is like playing poker against a professional who has marked the cards but presumably is unaware that the other player can read the backs as well as he can.<ref name = Begoum/>\n\n==Running offensive counterespionage operations==\nControl is the capacity of a case officer of country B to generate, alter, or halt agent behavior by using or indicating his capacity to use physical or psychological means of leverage. A case officer working overseas does not control a double agent the way a policeman controls an informer. At best, the matter is in shades of gray. The case officer has to consider that the double from country A still has contact with country B.\n\nBefore the case officer pushes a button on the agent's control panel, he should know what is likely to happen next. For example, pressure exerted bluntly or blindly, without insight into the agent's motivation and personality, may cause him to tell the truth to the adversary as a means of escaping from a painful situation.\n\nThe target service (A) inevitably exercises some control over the double agent, if only in his performance of the tasks that it assigns to him. B, in fact, must be careful not to disrupt the double's relation with his own service, warning service A of a control. Even if the positive side is being run so poorly that the misguided agent is in danger of coming to the attention of local authorities whose intervention would spoil the CI aspect, the case officer must restrain his natural impulse to button up the adversary's operation for him. At the very most, he can suggest for the agent to complain to the hostile case officer about insecure practices and then only if the agent's sophistication and relationship with that case officer make such a complaint seem normal.\n\nPhysical control of the double is likely only with agents captured in war. The best possible outside capture is to have the double live where he can be watched or at least to work in a place that he can be watched. Control of the agent's communications is very close to physical control. Communications control, at least partial, is essential: the agent himself is controlled to a considerable extent if his communications are controlled, but even when his communications are completely controlled, a well-trained agent doubled against his will may appear to be co-operating but manage at an opportune moment to send a signal to his own service indicating that he is under duress.\n\nWith only partial control, if the agent is in communication with the opposition service through a courier, dead drop, or live drop, some control or surveillance must be established over these meetings or servicings. The double agent who makes trips in and out of the area in which he can be physically controlled presents a multiplicity of problems.<ref name = Begoum/>\n\n===Balancing risk and reward in offensive counterespionage===\nThe nature and value of the double agent's functions depend greatly on his personal ability as well as on his mission for the other service. He can always report on the objectives and conduct of this mission and possibly more broadly on the positive and counterintelligence targets of the other service or on its plans. If he is skillful and well trained, he can do valuable work by exploiting the weaknesses of others: all intelligence officers of any service, despite their training, have some weaknesses.\n\nOne's own side may triple an agent or even more times. With each turn, the chances of deception increase and so in such operations, the quality of the agent's services needs to be checked constantly. If the agent no longer elicits trust, he might be offered exfiltration if in a foreign country. He might be retired and given an advisory position in which he handles no secrets but might be useful as an occasional reference.\n\nA rare agent may actually understand the thinking of the highest levels of government policy. That may not be purely a matter of his assignment; Oleg Penkovsky had social ties to high-ranking generals.\n\nAn agent who has been with his service any appreciable time will be able to provide a good deal of information on the practices and possibly resources of his FIS. Other than for the most important agents, a service is not apt to invent new communications techniques, either for hard copy passed by dead drop or courier or for electronic transmission. Information on capabilities comes indirectly, from the level of technology and manufacturing quality with the country-specific equipment with which he was provided.\n\nSome agencies, however, make a point of providing their agents with \"sterile\" equipment obtained commercially from third countries. If that is their pattern, it may become obvious only if multiple agents are compared at the national CI level. A sufficiently-sophisticated agency may obtain different third-country equipment for different agents, leaving the operational instructions as the only detail that may establish a pattern.\n\nThe double agent serves also as a controlled channel through which information can be passed to the other service to build up the agent in its estimation or for the purposes of deception. In the complex matter of deception, the following may be distinguished:\n:*operational deception, that concerning the service's own capabilities, intentions, and control of the agent\n:*national deception, that concerning the intentions of the controlling government or other components of it\n\nNational deception operations are usually very delicate and frequently involve the highest levels of the government. They, therefore, require prior co-ordination and approval at the national headquarters level.\n\nThe double agent channel can be used by the controlling service to insert data into the mechanisms of the other service with a number of possible objectives, such as to detect its activities in some field. The inserted material is designed to induce certain actions on the part of the other service, which are then observed through another operation or group of operations. The material has to be designed very skillfully if it is to deceive the other service and produce the desired reactions. Such a situation might arise if a case officer handling several operations wanted to set up still another one and needed to find out in advance what the pertinent operational pattern was.\n\n===Running the operation: dos and don'ts===\nThe following principles apply to the handling of all double agent operations in varying degrees. In composite, they form a checklist against which ongoing operations might be periodically reviewed and given special examination with the appearance of danger signals.<ref name=\"Begoum\"/>\n\n====Monitoring, testing, and managing the double agent====\n\"Testing is a continuous process.\" In accordance with the doctrine in force, use your own, or assistance from psychological specialists, look for changes in motivation. If appropriate, use a polygraph or newer techniques for detecting emotional stress. Without revealing the penetration, cross-check the information from the agents, including technical analysis of documents and equipment, surveillance, and further research into verifying the agent's story (\"legend\" in tradecraft) While \"name traces cannot be run on every person mentioned by the agent, do not be stingy with them on persons who have familial, emotional, or business ties with him\" in verifying his legend.\n\n\"Test, but only as a double.\" Improve his own security and cover as a double. Do not, however, improve his intelligence collection skills. The hostile service might make use of information that he collects independently, or it may become suspicious if his skill and reporting suddenly improve. If he has been a bad speller in his reports to his service, don not volunteer to copy edit!\n\n\"Require the agent to report and, as security permits, turn over to you everything he gets from the other side: money, gifts, equipment, documents, etc.\" This is a delicate balance. If he thinks that he does not have to report something to you, he can become confused about who gets what. At the same time, use judgment to keep him motivated. Rather than confiscating payments to him, you might deposit them in a third-country bank account of which he is aware, which he can access on termination.\n\n\"Prepare all briefings carefully.\" Teaching him resistance to interrogation may improve his security, but it also may make his service suspicious if his manner to them changes.\n\n\"Keep analyzing the agent as well as the case.\" Labels such as \"anticommunist,\" \"militant jihadist,\" and \"morally offended by own side\" can oversimplify and interfere with your own understanding of his thinking.\n\n\"Review the case file periodically.\" Always be thinking if the situation would be improved with improvements in your cover, his cover, or the cover for the operational techniques. Think about how new facts validate or invalidate the old. You may be able to ferret out the real priorities of the opposition with a historical perspective by looking at what they told him to follow up out of his reporting.\n\n\"Decide early in the operation how it will be terminated if the need arises.\" The last thing you want to do is leave an angry agent in place in a hostile service. Transfer him to another case officer or allied agency or arrange his escape to your side.\n\n====Managing expectations of the hostile service====\n\"Mirror-read.\" Constantly think about the operation as if you were in the opposing service. Think about what it receives from your agent, its satisfaction with it, and its perception of the agent and his capabilities. Do not assume the other side thinks as your service does, a special risk for the United States. The US tends to rely more on technical collection and OSINT than many other world services; the Soviet Union regarded espionage as the most important collection technique even when it could have used OSINT to collect the same information.\n\n\"Be careful about awakening in the hostile service an appetite which cannot later be satisfied without giving away too much.\" Do not give the agent material that is attractive to the other service but that it might realize he could not have obtained on his own. As long as you are monitoring what he collects before sending it to the other side, let him operate in his own way. By letting him do so, you may detect vulnerabilities that have been missed by your own service, but you can either stop the material from being sent or create appropriate disinformation.\n\n\"Avoid interference.\" Let the other service solve or not solve agent problems in their usual manner. For example, if the agent is arrested, do not immediately and visibly intervene. In such a situation, the other side may expose additional resources to support the agent or to provide alternate means of collection. That can always be explained to the agent, with some truth, that you are not giving obvious help to protect his security to his own service.\n\n\"Be constantly alert for hostile provocation.\" If the agent reports a crisis with his service, do not take it at face value; always look for the plot within a plot, but keep perspective. The opposition is not supermen.\n\n\"If the adversary appears to be a satellite [client] service, do not forget that the more powerful organization may not be pulling the strings.\" A local ideological terror group may well be receiving direction from a distant transnational group. Consider the possibility of false-flag agents in such circumstances.\n\n====Protecting your own service====\n\"Report the case frequently, quickly, and in detail.\" The FIS has a headquarters staff looking globally for penetrations; why should you not take advantage of your central resources? \"Only timely and full reporting to your headquarters will permit it to help you effectively.\" Keep a full record, including dates, of all adversary assignments given the agent.\n\n\"Keep precise records\" of any of your own side's classified material fed to the agent. To protect both your service and yourself, keep careful notes about who approved the release.\n\n\"Do not plan a deception operation or pass deception material without prior headquarters approval.\"\n\n\"Do not reveal your service's assets or CI knowledge to a double.\" It is vital for double agents to be run within the framework of their own materials the information that they themselves supply. The more you keep from an experienced double the information that he should not have, the more he will be reassured that his own safety is in good hands.\n\n\"Do not run the operation in a vacuum.\" Be aware of any political implications that it may have, locally or internationally.

She appeared in a range of genres, from [[screwball comedy]] to literary drama, and she received [[List of actors with two or more Academy Awards in acting categories|a record]] (for any gender) four [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Lead Acting Performances]], plus eight further nominations. In 1999, Hepburn was named by the [[American Film Institute]] the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest female star]] of [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Classic Hollywood Cinema]]. She was known for her fierce independence and spirited personality.\n\nRaised in [[Connecticut]] by wealthy, [[Progressive Era|progressive]] parents, Hepburn began to act while studying at [[Bryn Mawr College]]. Favorable reviews of her work on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] brought her to the attention of Hollywood. Her early years in film were marked with success, including an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her third picture, ''[[Morning Glory (1933 film)|Morning Glory]]'' (1933), but this was followed by a series of commercial failures culminating in the critically lauded but commercially unsuccessful comedy ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938), a pairing with [[Cary Grant]]. Hepburn masterminded her own comeback, buying out [[Studio system|her contract]] with [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] and acquiring the film rights to ''[[The Philadelphia Story (play)|The Philadelphia Story]]'', which she sold on the condition that she be the star. That comedy film, again co-starring [[Cary Grant]], was a box office success and landed her a third Academy Award nomination, plus won her other co-star, [[James Stewart]], his only Academy Award. Both movies are now considered among the greatest comedy films.\n\nIn the 1940s, she began focusing on a screen and romantic partnership with [[Spencer Tracy]], which spanned 26 years and nine movies, although the romance with the married Tracy was hidden from the public. The partnership began with ''[[Woman of the Year]]'' (1942), continued with ''[[Adam's Rib]]'' (1949), both being \"battle of the sexes\" romantic comedies, and concluded with the race-issue drama ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]'' (1967), also starring [[Sidney Poitier]]; Tracy died shortly after the movie's filming.\n\nHepburn challenged herself in the latter half of her life, as she tackled [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] stage productions and a range of literary roles. She found a niche playing middle-aged spinsters, such as in ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (1951), which landed her another Academy Award nomination and co-star [[Humphrey Bogart]] his sole Academy Award. ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer]]'' (1959) was another commercial and critical success and landed her another Oscar nomination. Hepburn earned three more Oscars for her work in ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]'' (1967), ''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]'' (1968), and ''[[On Golden Pond (1981 film)|On Golden Pond]]'' (1981), co-starring [[Henry Fonda]], who won his only Academy Award for the movie. In the 1970s, she began appearing in television films, which later became the focus of her career. She made her final screen appearance at the age of 87. After a period of inactivity and ill health, Hepburn died in 2003 at the age of 96.\n\nHepburn famously shunned the Hollywood publicity machine, and refused to conform to society's expectations of women. She was outspoken, assertive, and athletic, and wore trousers before they were fashionable for women. She was briefly married as a young woman, but thereafter lived independently. With her unconventional lifestyle and the independent characters she brought to the screen, Hepburn epitomized the \"modern woman\" in the 20th-century United States, and is remembered as an important cultural figure.\n\n== Early life and education ==\n[[File:DrandMrsThomasNHepburn.jpg|thumb|upright|Hepburn (left) with [[Katharine Martha Houghton Hepburn|her mother]] and siblings, 1921]]\n\nHepburn was born on May 12, 1907, in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], the second of six children.

She appeared in a range of genres, from [[screwball comedy]] to literary drama, and she received [[List of actors with two or more Academy Awards in acting categories|a record]] (for any gender) four [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Lead Acting Performances]], plus eight further nominations. In 1999, Hepburn was named by the [[American Film Institute]] the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest female star]] of [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Classic Hollywood Cinema]]. She was known for her fierce independence and spirited personality.\n\nRaised in [[Connecticut]] by wealthy, [[Progressive Era|progressive]] parents, Hepburn began to act while studying at [[Bryn Mawr College]]. Favorable reviews of her work on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] brought her to the attention of Hollywood. Her early years in film were marked with success, including an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her third picture, ''[[Morning Glory (1933 film)|Morning Glory]]'' (1933), but this was followed by a series of commercial failures culminating in the critically lauded but commercially unsuccessful comedy ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' (1938), a pairing with [[Cary Grant]]. Hepburn masterminded her own comeback, buying out [[Studio system|her contract]] with [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] and acquiring the film rights to ''[[The Philadelphia Story (play)|The Philadelphia Story]]'', which she sold on the condition that she be the star. That comedy film, again co-starring [[Cary Grant]], was a box office success and landed her a third Academy Award nomination, plus won her other co-star, [[James Stewart]], his only Academy Award. Both movies are now considered among the greatest comedy films.\n\nIn the 1940s, she began focusing on a screen and romantic partnership with [[Spencer Tracy]], which spanned 26 years and nine movies, although the romance with the married Tracy was hidden from the public. The partnership began with ''[[Woman of the Year]]'' (1942), continued with ''[[Adam's Rib]]'' (1949), both being \"battle of the sexes\" romantic comedies, and concluded with the race-issue drama ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]'' (1967), also starring [[Sidney Poitier]]; Tracy died shortly after the movie's filming.\n\nHepburn challenged herself in the latter half of her life, as she tackled [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] stage productions and a range of literary roles. She found a niche playing middle-aged spinsters, such as in ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (1951), which landed her another Academy Award nomination and co-star [[Humphrey Bogart]] his sole Academy Award. ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer]]'' (1959) was another commercial and critical success and landed her another Oscar nomination. Hepburn earned three more Oscars for her work in ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]'' (1967), ''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]'' (1968), and ''[[On Golden Pond (1981 film)|On Golden Pond]]'' (1981), co-starring [[Henry Fonda]], who won his only Academy Award for the movie. In the 1970s, she began appearing in television films, which later became the focus of her career. She made her final screen appearance at the age of 87. After a period of inactivity and ill health, Hepburn died in 2003 at the age of 96.\n\nHepburn famously shunned the Hollywood publicity machine, and refused to conform to society's expectations of women. She was outspoken, assertive, and athletic, and wore trousers before they were fashionable for women. She was briefly married as a young woman, but thereafter lived independently. With her unconventional lifestyle and the independent characters she brought to the screen, Hepburn epitomized the \"modern woman\" in the 20th-century United States, and is remembered as an important cultural figure.\n\n== Early life and education ==\n[[File:DrandMrsThomasNHepburn.jpg|thumb|upright|Hepburn (left) with [[Katharine Martha Houghton Hepburn|her mother]] and siblings, 1921]]\n\nHepburn was born on May 12, 1907, in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], the second of six children.

{"title_page": "William Savage", "text_new": "{{other people}}\n{{EngvarB|date=December 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2017}}\n\n'''William Savage''' (1720 \u2013 27 July 1789) was an [[English people|English]] composer, organist, and singer of the [[18th century]]. He sang as a boy [[boy soprano|treble]] and [[alto]], a [[countertenor]], and as a [[bass (voice)|bass]]. He is best remembered for his association with the composer [[George Frideric Handel]], in whose [[oratorio]]s Savage sang.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Singer===\n[[Image:Haendel.jpg|thumb|210px|The composer [[George Frideric Handel]], who composed many different roles in his [[operas]] and [[oratorios]] for Savage (1733)]]\nSavage first came to prominence as a boy treble in 1735, singing in a revival of Handel's ''[[Athalia]]'' and in ''[[Alcina]]'' during the composer's Covent Garden season. The role of Oberto in ''Alcina'' was composed with his voice particularly in mind. After his voice had broken, he initially continued his career singing as an alto ([[countertenor]]), and later turned into a bass. As a countertenor he performed possibly the small roles of La Fortuna and Childerico in Handel's operas, ''[[Giustino (Handel)|Giustino]]'' (1737) and ''[[Faramondo]]'' (1738),<ref>Grove. Savage's countertenor performing the role of Childerico is also stated by Hogwood (p. 146). According to the English conductor, \"the countertenor voice was not typical of ''opera seria'' and Savage perhaps took the small [[soprano]] part of Childerico because of the problems <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[impresario]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> [[John James Heidegger|Heidegger]] encountered in casting it. It is certainly no historical precedent; in a similar dilemma Handel would normally have transposed or transferred a castrato part to a female singer\". According to [[Anthony Hicks]], however, the role of the goddess Fortuna was instead his last appearance as a treble, while the minor soprano part of Childerico, which has no arias, was probably sung an octave lower than written, having Savage's voice just broken (articles: ''Giustino'' (ii) and ''Faramondo'', in [[Stanley Sadie]] (ed), ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', New York, Oxford University Press, 1997, II, pp. 121 e 440\u2013441).</ref> and also appeared in the first performance of  ''[[Israel in Egypt]]'' (1739), as well as in revivals of other Handel oratorios.<ref name=\"countertenor\">The information for these performances and their dates comes from http://gfhandel.org/.</ref> As a bass, he created the title role in ''[[Imeneo]]'' (1740), the role of Fenice in ''[[Deidamia (opera)|Deidamia]]'' (1741)<ref name=\"Grove\">Burrows.</ref> and that of Manoa at the premiere of the oratorio ''[[Samson (oratorio)|Samson]]'' (1743).<ref name=\"countertenor\"/> The 18th-century musicologist [[Charles Burney]] described Savage's voice as a \"powerful and not unpleasant bass\".<ref name=\"Grove\"/> The description of his pupil R.
