The RAF AWACS fleet is made up of seven E-3Ds, with the UK designation Sentry AEW1.\n\nIt was announced in July 2019 that from the early 2020s the squadron will be the first to operate the [[Boeing 737 AEW&C|Boeing E-7 Wedgetail]], the [[Future of the Royal Air Force#Wedgetail|planned replacement]] for the RAF's E-3D Sentry fleet.\n\n==History==\n\n===First World War===\nAs No. 8 Squadron of the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) it was formed at [[Brooklands]], [[Surrey]] on 1 January 1915, equipped with the [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2]]c.

On 12 August 1918, Captain [[Ferdinand Maurice Felix West]] of 8 Squadron was flying a F.K.8 on a contact patrol when he was attacked by seven German fighters. Despite a severe leg wound, West managed to maneuver his aircraft so that his observer could drive off the attacking fighters, before making a forced landing behind Allied lines and insisting in reporting the results of the flight.

It flew operations against [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] in February 1928 and against the Subaihi tribe, who were refusing to pay taxes and revolting, from January to March 1929. Operations against the Subaihi involved destroying crops with incendiary bombs and bombing villages after giving warning so they could be evacuated. This pressure eventually forced the Subaihi to sue for peace, with the rebel chiefs paying fines. More peaceful operation carried out by the squadron included survey flights, casualty evacuation and carrying mail, while the squadron carried out a long-distance return trip from Aden to Cairo and back in 1932.<ref name=\"8sqd aden\">[http://8squadron.co.uk/history_move_to_aden.php \"8 Squadron Moves to Aden\"].

The RAF AWACS fleet is made up of seven E-3Ds, with the UK designation Sentry AEW1.\n\nIt was announced in July 2019 that from the early 2020s the squadron will be the first to operate the [[Boeing 737 AEW&C|Boeing E-7 Wedgetail]], the [[Future of the Royal Air Force#Wedgetail|planned replacement]] for the RAF's E-3D Sentry fleet.\n\n==History==\n\n===First World War===\nAs No. 8 Squadron of the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) it was formed at [[Brooklands]], [[Surrey]] on 1 January 1915, equipped with the [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2]]c. The squadron moved to Gosport later in January for further training, and crossed to France on 15 April 1915.<ref name=\"Rawlings coast p19\">Rawlings 1982, p. 19.</ref> While its main equipment was the B.E.2c, it also operated a fighter flight between May 1915 and early 1916 equipped with a mixture of aircraft, including the [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.8]] and the [[Bristol Scout]], while it also evaluated the prototype [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.9]], a modified B.E.2 that carried the observer/gunner in a nacelle ahead of the aircraft's propeller.<ref name=\"Rawlings coast p19\"/><ref name=\"Bruce RFC p379,2,4\">Bruce 1982, pp. 379, 382, 384.</ref>\n\nOperating from airfields near [[Saint-Omer]], the squadron was initially used for bombing and long-range reconnaissance, carrying out flights of up to {{convert|100|mi|km}} behind the front lines.<ref name=\"Rawlings coast p19\"/><ref name=\"Ashworth p43\">Ashworth 1989, p. 43.</ref> In February 1916 it moved to Bellevue and specialised in the Corps Reconnaissance role, carrying out contact patrols and artillery spotting in close co-operation with the army.<ref name=\"Rawlings coast p19\"/><ref name=\"Halley p29\">Halley 1980, p. 29.</ref> The squadron flew in support of the [[Battle of the Somme]] in the summer of 1916 and the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] in April\u2013May 1917. It received the improved B.E.2e from February 1917, but despite this, losses were heavy as all marks of B.E.2 were outclassed.

On 12 August 1918, Captain [[Ferdinand Maurice Felix West]] of 8 Squadron was flying a F.K.8 on a contact patrol when he was attacked by seven German fighters. Despite a severe leg wound, West managed to maneuver his aircraft so that his observer could drive off the attacking fighters, before making a forced landing behind Allied lines and insisting in reporting the results of the flight.

It flew operations against [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] in February 1928 and against the Subaihi tribe, who were refusing to pay taxes and revolting, from January to March 1929. Operations against the Subaihi involved destroying crops with incendiary bombs and bombing villages after giving warning so they could be evacuated. This pressure eventually forced the Subaihi to sue for peace, with the rebel chiefs paying fines. More peaceful operation carried out by the squadron included survey flights, casualty evacuation and carrying mail, while the squadron carried out a long-distance return trip from Aden to Cairo and back in 1932.<ref name=\"8sqd aden\">[http://8squadron.co.uk/history_move_to_aden.php \"8 Squadron Moves to Aden\"].

The Oilers would finish the season with a 37\u201337\u20136 record for 80 points, their lowest point total since 1980\u201381, and Edmonton would score a franchise low 272 goals, however, the Oilers would set a franchise record for fewest goals against, with 272.  After a 2\u201311\u20132 start to the season, the Oilers would rebound, and finish 3rd in the Smythe Division and continue their playoff streak of making the playoffs every year they've been in the NHL.\n\nPrior to the season, long time Oiler [[Jari Kurri]] left the team due to a contract dispute signing with [[Italy|Italian]] club Milano Devils, leaving a big hole on the team's top line.  Injuries would also hurt the Oilers, as [[Mark Messier]] would miss 29 games due to injuries, and his 64 points was his lowest total since 1984\u201385.  Messier would also match the lowest goal total of his career with 12, which matched his rookie season total back in 1979\u201380.  [[Esa Tikkanen]] would lead the club in points with 69, while [[Petr Klima]] scored a career high 40 goals to lead Edmonton in that department.  [[James Stephen Smith|Steve Smith]] would lead the Oilers defense with 54 points, and his 193 penalty minutes would lead the club.\n\nIn goal, [[Bill Ranford]] had a solid season, winning a team high 27 games and posting a 3.20 GAA.  [[Grant Fuhr]] returned from his substance abuse suspension near the end of the season, and put together a solid 6\u20134\u20133 record with a 3.01 GAA.\n\nIn the playoffs, the Oilers would face their [[Battle of Alberta]] rivals, the [[Calgary Flames]], who were huge favourites to win the series, as they finished with 20 more points than the Oilers did.  The series went the full 7 games, with the Oilers winning the series in OT at the [[Saddledome]] in Calgary to advance to the division finals.  There, they met the [[Los Angeles Kings]], who finished 22 points better than Edmonton, however, the Oilers overtime magic continued after dropping the first game of the series, as Edmonton would win 2 games in a row in double OT to take the series lead.  Edmonton would go on to win the series in 6 games, clinching the series in OT.  In the Conference Finals, the Oilers would face the surprising [[Minnesota North Stars]], who finished the season 12 games under .500, however, they defeated the [[Presidents Trophy]] winning [[Chicago Blackhawks]] and the [[St. Louis Blues]], who finished 1 point behind Chicago, to make it to the 3rd round against Edmonton.  The North Stars cinderella playoff run would continue, as they defeated the Oilers in 5 games, ending Edmonton's chance for back-to-back Stanley Cups.\n\nThey finished the regular season with the fewest short-handed goals allowed (4).<ref>https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1991.html</ref>\n\n==Season standings==\n{{1990\u201391 Smythe Division standings|team=EDM}}\n{{1990\u201391 NHL Campbell Conference standings|team=EDM}}\n\n==Schedule and results==\n{| class=\"toccolours\"  style=\"width:90%;

The Oilers would finish the season with a 37\u201337\u20136 record for 80 points, their lowest point total since 1980\u201381, and Edmonton would score a franchise low 272 goals, however, the Oilers would set a franchise record for fewest goals against, with 272.  After a 2\u201311\u20132 start to the season, the Oilers would rebound, and finish 3rd in the Smythe Division and continue their playoff streak of making the playoffs every year they've been in the NHL.\n\nPrior to the season, long time Oiler [[Jari Kurri]] left the team due to a contract dispute signing with [[Italy|Italian]] club Milano Devils, leaving a big hole on the teams top line.  Injuries would also hurt the Oilers, as [[Mark Messier]] would miss 29 games due to injuries, and his 64 points was his lowest total since 1984\u201385.  Messier would also match the lowest goal total of his career with 12, which matched his rookie season total back in 1979\u201380.  [[Esa Tikkanen]] would lead the club in points with 69, while [[Petr Klima]] scored a career high 40 goals to lead Edmonton in that department.  [[James Stephen Smith|Steve Smith]] would lead the Oilers defense with 54 points, and his 193 penalty minutes would lead the club.\n\nIn goal, [[Bill Ranford]] had a solid season, winning a team high 27 games and posting a 3.20 GAA.  [[Grant Fuhr]] returned from his substance abuse suspension near the end of the season, and put together a solid 6\u20134\u20133 record with a 3.01 GAA.\n\nIn the playoffs, the Oilers would face their [[Battle of Alberta]] rivals, the [[Calgary Flames]], who were huge favourites to win the series, as they finished with 20 more points than the Oilers did.  The series went the full 7 games, with the Oilers winning the series in OT at the [[Saddledome]] in Calgary to advance to the division finals.  There, they met the [[Los Angeles Kings]], who finished 22 points better than Edmonton, however, the Oilers overtime magic continued after dropping the first game of the series, as Edmonton would win 2 games in a row in double OT to take the series lead.  Edmonton would go on to win the series in 6 games, clinching the series in OT.  In the Conference Finals, the Oilers would face the surprising [[Minnesota North Stars]], who finished the season 12 games under .500, however, they defeated the [[Presidents Trophy]] winning [[Chicago Blackhawks]] and the [[St. Louis Blues]], who finished 1 point behind Chicago, to make it to the 3rd round against Edmonton.  The North Stars cinderella playoff run would continue, as they defeated the Oilers in 5 games, ending Edmonton's chance for back-to-back Stanley Cups.\n\nThey finished the regular season with the fewest short-handed goals allowed (4).<ref>https://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1991.html</ref>\n\n==Season standings==\n{{1990\u201391 Smythe Division standings|team=EDM}}\n{{1990\u201391 NHL Campbell Conference standings|team=EDM}}\n\n==Schedule and results==\n{| class=\"toccolours\"  style=\"width:90%;

Found in drier regions across much of the continent, it inhabits [[shrubland|scrub]] and open [[woodland]]. Like many brightly coloured robins of the family [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|10.5|\u2013|12.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, the robin has a small, thin, black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. The male has a distinctive red cap and red breast, black upperparts, and a black tail with white tips. The underparts and shoulders are white. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown. This species uses a variety of songs, and males generally sing to [[territory (animal)|advertise territories]] and attract females. Birds are encountered in pairs or small groups, but the social behaviour has been little studied.\n\nThe position of the red-capped robin is unclear; it and its relatives are unrelated to [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin|American]] robins, but they appear to be an early offshoot of the [[songbird]] infraorder [[Passerida]]. The red-capped robin is a predominantly ground-feeding bird, and its prey consists of [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s. Although widespread, it is uncommon in much of its range and has receded in some areas from human activity.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe red-capped robin was described by [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]] and [[Thomas Horsfield]] in 1827, having been collected in the northern [[Spencer Gulf]] in [[South Australia]]. They named it ''Muscicapa goodenovii'',<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Vigors, Nicholas A. |author2=Horsfield, Thomas |year=1827 |title=A description of the Australian birds in the collection of the Linnean Society; with an attempt at arranging them according to their natural affinities |journal=Transactions of the Linnean Society of London |volume=15 |pages=170\u2013331 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.1826.tb00115.x}}[245]</ref><!-- cites previous clause and sentence before it --> and placed it among the [[Old World flycatcher]] family [[Muscicapidae]].<ref name=\"Boles, p. xv\">Boles, p. xv.</ref> The [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''goodenovii'' honours the Reverend [[Samuel Goodenough]], [[Bishop of Carlisle]] and first treasurer of the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Every Australian Bird Illustrated |editor=Wade, Paul |year=1977 |page=217 |publisher=Rigby |isbn=0-7270-0009-8}}</ref>\n\nThe red-capped robin was later moved to the genus ''[[Petroica]]''. The generic name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''petros'' 'rock' and ''oikos'' 'home', from the bird's habit of sitting on rocks.<ref>Boles, p. 66.</ref> Within the genus, it is one of five red- or pink-breasted species colloquially known as \"red robins\", as distinct from the \"yellow robins\" of the genus ''[[Eopsaltria]]''.

Found in drier regions across much of the continent, it inhabits [[shrubland|scrub]] and open [[woodland]]. Like many brightly coloured robins of the family [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|10.5|\u2013|12.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, the robin has a small, thin, black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. The male has a distinctive red cap and red breast, black upperparts, and a black tail with white tips. The underparts and shoulders are white. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown. This species uses a variety of songs, and males generally sing to [[territory (animal)|advertise territories]] and attract females. Birds are encountered in pairs or small groups, but the social behaviour has been little studied.\n\nThe position of the red-capped robin is unclear; it and its relatives are unrelated to [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin|American]] robins, but they appear to be an early offshoot of the [[songbird]] infraorder [[Passerida]]. The red-capped robin is a predominantly ground-feeding bird, and its prey consists of [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s. Although widespread, it is uncommon in much of its range and has receded in some areas from human activity.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe red-capped robin was described by [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]] and [[Thomas Horsfield]] in 1827, having been collected in the northern [[Spencer Gulf]] in [[South Australia]].

During the summer the club invested heavily in their squad, attempting to offset the loss of rising star [[Paul Gascoigne]] to [[Tottenham Hotspurs F.C.|Spurs]] for a then club record fee. [[F.A. Cup]] winners Dave Beasant and Andy Thorn were signed for \u00a3850,000 each, [[Scottish People|Scotsmen]] John Robertson and John Hendrie joined for similar fees as the club spent the \u00a32.2 million it received for Gascoigne. The loss of Gascoigne proved to be the [[straw that broke the camel's back]] so soon after selling star players [[Peter Beardsley]] and [[Chris Waddle]], and promising youngster [[Michael O'Neill (footballer)|Michael O'Neill]], struggling with loss of form and injuries along with enigmatic [[Brazilians|Brazilian]] [[Mirandinha]] were in and out of the team all season.\n\nThis season saw Newcastle United relegated to the [[1989-90 Football League#Second Division|Football League Second Division]], finishing bottom of the division after a horrible season in which the team changed manager 2 months into the season. Manager Willie McFaul was sacked after a 3-0 home defeat which came exactly a week after the team had beaten current League Champions [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at Anfield. New manager Jim Smith, who struggled to change the team's fortunes, set about 'Wheeling and dealing' that saw many changes to the squad. Out went big money new signings Beasant and Robertson to be replaced by unknown Northern Irishman keeper Tommy Wright and ex-patriate striker Rob MacDonald. Other signings included ex-England international Kenny Sansom, experienced right back Ray Ranson and [[Danish people|Danish]] pair Bj\u00f8rn Kristensen and Frank Pingel.\n\n==Appearances, goals and

Football League#First Division|Football League First Division]]. During the summer the club invested heavily in their squad, attempting to offset the loss of rising star [[Paul Gascoigne]] to [[Tottenham Hotspurs F.C.|Spurs]] for a then club record fee. [[F.A. Cup]] winners Dave Beasant and Andy Thorn were signed for \u00a3850,000 each, [[Scottish People|Scotsmen]] John Robertson and John Hendrie joined for similar fees as the club spent the \u00a32.2 million it received for Gascoigne. The loss of Gascoigne proved to be the [[straw that broke the camel's back]] so soon after selling star players [[Peter Beardsley]] and [[Chris Waddle]], and promising youngster [[Michael O'Neill (footballer)|Michael O'Neill]], struggling with loss of form and injuries along with enigmatic [[Brazilians|Brazilian]] [[Mirandinha]] were in and out of the team all season. \n\nThis season saw Newcastle United relegated to the [[1989-90 Football League#Second Division|Football League Second Division]], finishing bottom of the division after a horrible season in which the team changed manager 2 months into the season. Manager Willie McFaul was sacked after a 3-0 home defeat which came exactly a week after the team had beaten current League Champions [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] at Anfield. New manager Jim Smith, who struggled to change the teams fortunes, set about 'Wheeling and dealing' that saw many changes to the squad. Out went big money new signings Beasant and Robertson to be replaced by unknown Northern Irishman keeper Tommy Wright and ex-patriate striker Rob MacDonald. Other signings included ex-England international Kenny Sansom, experienced right back Ray Ranson and [[Danish people|Danish]] pair Bj\u00f8rn Kristensen and Frank Pingel.\n\n==Appearances, goals and
