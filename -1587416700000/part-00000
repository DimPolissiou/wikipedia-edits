For example, an [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] instruction using the conventional two-operand form ''a&nbsp;=&nbsp;a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b'' can now use a non-destructive three-operand form ''c&nbsp;=&nbsp;a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b'', preserving both source operands. AVX's three-operand format is limited to the instructions with SIMD operands (YMM), and does not include instructions with general purpose registers (e.g. EAX). Such support will first appear in AVX2.<ref name=\"avx2\"/>\n\nThe [[Data structure alignment|alignment]] requirement of SIMD memory operands is relaxed.<ref name=\"intel_vol1\">{{cite book|title=Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual Volume 1: Basic Architecture|publisher=Intel Corporation|page=349|edition=-051US|url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-vol-1-manual.pdf|accessdate=August 23, 2014|chapter=14.9|quote=Memory arguments for most instructions with VEX prefix operate normally without causing #GP(0) on any byte-granularity alignment (unlike Legacy SSE instructions).}}</ref>\n\nThe new [[VEX coding scheme]] introduces a new set of code prefixes that extends the [[opcode]] space, allows instructions to have more than two operands, and allows SIMD vector registers to be longer than 128 bits. The VEX prefix can also be used on the legacy SSE instructions giving them a three-operand form, and making them interact more efficiently with AVX instructions without the need for VZEROUPPER and VZEROALL.\n\nThe AVX instructions support both 128-bit and 256-bit SIMD. The 128-bit versions can be useful to improve old code without needing to widen the vectorization, and avoid the penalty of going from SSE to AVX, they are also faster on some early AMD implementations of AVX. This mode is sometimes known as AVX-128.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.8.2/gcc/i386-and-x86-64-Options.html#i386-and-x86-64-Options|title=i386 and x86-64 Options - Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)|accessdate=February 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== New instructions ===\nThese AVX instructions are in addition to the ones that are 256-bit extensions of the legacy 128-bit SSE instructions; most are usable on both 128-bit and 256-bit operands.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

On the AMD Jaguar processor architecture, this instruction with a memory source operand takes more than 300 clock cycles when the mask is zero, in which case the instruction should do nothing.

For example, an [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] instruction using the conventional two-operand form ''a&nbsp;=&nbsp;a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b'' can now use a non-destructive three-operand form ''c&nbsp;=&nbsp;a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b'', preserving both source operands. AVX's three-operand format is limited to the instructions with SIMD operands (YMM), and does not include instructions with general purpose registers (e.g. EAX). Such support will first appear in AVX2.<ref name=\"avx2\"/>\n\nThe [[Data structure alignment|alignment]] requirement of SIMD memory operands is relaxed.<ref name=\"intel_vol1\">{{cite book|title=Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual Volume 1: Basic Architecture|publisher=Intel Corporation|page=349|edition=-051US|url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-vol-1-manual.pdf|accessdate=August 23, 2014|chapter=14.9|quote=Memory arguments for most instructions with VEX prefix operate normally without causing #GP(0) on any byte-granularity alignment (unlike Legacy SSE instructions).}}</ref>\n\nThe new [[VEX coding scheme]] introduces a new set of code prefixes that extends the [[opcode]] space, allows instructions to have more than two operands, and allows SIMD vector registers to be longer than 128 bits. The VEX prefix can also be used on the legacy SSE instructions giving them a three-operand form, and making them interact more efficiently with AVX instructions without the need for VZEROUPPER and VZEROALL.\n\nThe AVX instructions support both 128-bit and 256-bit SIMD. The 128-bit versions can be useful to improve old code without needing to widen the vectorization, and avoid the penalty of going from SSE to AVX, they are also faster on some early AMD implementations of AVX. This mode is sometimes known as AVX-128.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.8.2/gcc/i386-and-x86-64-Options.html#i386-and-x86-64-Options|title=i386 and x86-64 Options - Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)|accessdate=February 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== New instructions ===\nThese AVX instructions are in addition to the ones that are 256-bit extensions of the legacy 128-bit SSE instructions; most are usable on both 128-bit and 256-bit operands.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

She also looked after four [[potto]]s for many years and published a series of observations on their behaviour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?n=ursula-moser-cowgill&pid=177862601|title=Ursula Moser Cowgill's Obituary|website=New York Times|accessdate=24 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nCowgill earned a [[PhD]] from [[Iowa State University]] in 1956. Later she worked as an analytical chemist for the [[limnologist]] [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]]. Her first journal articles, some published jointly with Hutchinson, appeared in the early 1960s.\n\nCowgill was living in [[Colorado]] as of 2003. In addition to her scientific research, she was an activist with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].\n\n==Work and findings==\n\n===Pottos===\nIn 1959, three pairs of pottos from West Africa arrived at Yale's Osborn Zoological Laboratory. At first they lived in the laboratory with a number of other [[nocturnal]] [[prosimian]]s that Cowgill and Hutchinson were studying. In 1964, Cowgill took two of the pairs to live with her. She looked after them until 1981, when she gave the sole surviving male to a colleague.\n\nWhile the pottos were with her, Cowgill published a number of journal articles on their anatomy, diet, reproduction, illnesses and recovery, and social behaviour. These publications constitute one of the few long-term studies of pottos in captivity.\n\n===Maya agriculture===\nBetween 1961 and 1963, Cowgill and Hutchinson made studies of [[soil]] in the [[Pet\u00e9n Basin]], [[Guatemala]], with the aim of learning about the effects of [[agriculture|agricultural]] practices of the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]].<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=daTnCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA304&lpg=PA304&dq=Ursula+Cowgill#v=onepage&q=Ursula%20Cowgill&f=false | title=Human Adaptation in Ancient Mesoamerica: Empirical Approaches to Mesoamerican Archaeology| isbn=9781607323921| last1=Gonlin| first1=Nancy| last2=French| first2=Kirk D.| date=2015-12-01}}</ref> Their findings reported that Maya cultivation methods had gradually robbed the soil of vital elements, meaning that it eventually became unable to sustain crops. Some scholars have linked this exhaustion of the soil to the 10th-century decline of the Maya urban settlements in the Pet\u00e9n region.\n\n===Sex ratio and childhood mortality===\nCowgill's research into gender and child mortality covered both historical records in [[England]] and contemporary observations in [[Guatemala]]. Using birth and death records from the parish registers of [[York]] between 1538 and 1812, Cowgill found that throughout the city's history, girls at every stage of childhood had died at a higher rate than boys of the same age. This resulted in an adult [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] of 136 males for every 100 females. Cowgill theorised that this was partly because girls were more likely to be victims of [[infanticide]], and partly because sons tended to receive better feeding and care than daughters.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2173357|title = Some Comments on Ursula M. Cowgill's Article, 'Life and Death in the Sixteenth Century in the City of York': (Population Studies, July 1967)|journal = Population Studies|volume = 22|issue = 1|pages = 165\u2013169|last1 = Henry|first1 = L.|year = 1968|doi=10.1080/00324728.1968.10405530}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Guatemala]], Cowgill studied an indigenous village where the sex ratio was even more skewed\u2014178:100. Cowgill observed that mothers in this village [[breastfeeding|breastfed]] sons for much longer than daughters, and tended to give them preferential treatment even after weaning. Cowgill and Hutchinson also speculated that the sexually provocative behaviour of young girls in this village might be a [[survival mechanism]].\n\n===Seasons of birth===\nCowgill undertook one of the first scientific studies of seasonality in human reproduction. Taking data from historical records and indigenous peoples in various countries, she concluded that conception and birth in human beings, like that of many other animals, followed seasonal patterns to a degree. Because the pattern was different in the [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]] and [[Southern Hemisphere]]s, Cowgill hypothesised that [[weather]] was the determining factor. However, she found that in [[urbanisation|urbanised]] and [[industrialisation|industrialised]] areas the pattern had been disrupted. Her 1966 article on the topic, published in the journal ''Ecology'', has formed the basis for subsequent research by other scientists.\n\n===Selenium and AIDS===\nIn 1997, Cowgill gauged the selenium content of soil in various locations in the [[United States]] by measuring the amount of the mineral that was absorbed by [[alfalfa]]. She then correlated this information with the mortality rate of [[AIDS]] in the area. She found that the more selenium there was in the soil, the lower mortality from AIDS was. The relationship was especially strong among [[African-Americans]].\n\n==Publications==\n*{{cite journal |jstor=71188 |pages=238\u201341 |last1=Cowgill |first1=U.

Her work includes studies of [[Agriculture in Mesoamerica|agricultural practices in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica]], seasons of [[birth]] in human beings, the relationship between cultural [[sexism|gender bias]] and [[infant mortality]], and the possible role of [[selenium]] in reducing [[death|mortality]] from [[AIDS]]. She also looked after four [[potto]]s for many years and published a series of observations on their behaviour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?n=ursula-moser-cowgill&pid=177862601|title=Ursula Moser Cowgill's Obituary|website=New York Times|accessdate=24 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nCowgill earned a [[PhD]] from [[Iowa State University]] in 1956. Later she worked as an analytical chemist for the [[limnologist]] [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]]. Her first journal articles, some published jointly with Hutchinson, appeared in the early 1960s.\n\nCowgill was living in [[Colorado]] as of 2003. In addition to her scientific research, she was an activist with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].\n\n==Work and findings==\n\n===Pottos===\nIn 1959, three pairs of pottos from West Africa arrived at Yale's Osborn Zoological Laboratory. At first they lived in the laboratory with a number of other [[nocturnal]] [[prosimian]]s that Cowgill and Hutchinson were studying. In 1964, Cowgill took two of the pairs to live with her. She looked after them until 1981, when she gave the sole surviving male to a colleague.\n\nWhile the pottos were with her, Cowgill published a number of journal articles on their anatomy, diet, reproduction, illnesses and recovery, and social behaviour. These publications constitute one of the few long-term studies of pottos in captivity.\n\n===Maya agriculture===\nBetween 1961 and 1963, Cowgill and Hutchinson made studies of [[soil]] in the [[Pet\u00e9n Basin]], [[Guatemala]], with the aim of learning about the effects of [[agriculture|agricultural]] practices of the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]].<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=daTnCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA304&lpg=PA304&dq=Ursula+Cowgill#v=onepage&q=Ursula%20Cowgill&f=false | title=Human Adaptation in Ancient Mesoamerica: Empirical Approaches to Mesoamerican Archaeology| isbn=9781607323921| last1=Gonlin| first1=Nancy| last2=French| first2=Kirk D.| date=2015-12-01}}</ref> Their findings reported that Maya cultivation methods had gradually robbed the soil of vital elements, meaning that it eventually became unable to sustain crops. Some scholars have linked this exhaustion of the soil to the 10th-century decline of the Maya urban settlements in the Pet\u00e9n region.\n\n===Sex ratio and childhood mortality===\nCowgill's research into gender and child mortality covered both historical records in [[England]] and contemporary observations in [[Guatemala]]. Using birth and death records from the parish registers of [[York]] between 1538 and 1812, Cowgill found that throughout the city's history, girls at every stage of childhood had died at a higher rate than boys of the same age. This resulted in an adult [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] of 136 males for every 100 females. Cowgill theorised that this was partly because girls were more likely to be victims of [[infanticide]], and partly because sons tended to receive better feeding and care than daughters.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2173357|title = Some Comments on Ursula M. Cowgill's Article, 'Life and Death in the Sixteenth Century in the City of York': (Population Studies, July 1967)|journal = Population Studies|volume = 22|issue = 1|pages = 165\u2013169|last1 = Henry|first1 = L.|year = 1968|doi=10.1080/00324728.1968.10405530}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Guatemala]], Cowgill studied an indigenous village where the sex ratio was even more skewed\u2014178:100. Cowgill observed that mothers in this village [[breastfeeding|breastfed]] sons for much longer than daughters, and tended to give them preferential treatment even after weaning. Cowgill and Hutchinson also speculated that the sexually provocative behaviour of young girls in this village might be a [[survival mechanism]].\n\n===Seasons of birth===\nCowgill undertook one of the first scientific studies of seasonality in human reproduction. Taking data from historical records and indigenous peoples in various countries, she concluded that conception and birth in human beings, like that of many other animals, followed seasonal patterns to a degree. Because the pattern was different in the [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]] and [[Southern Hemisphere]]s, Cowgill hypothesised that [[weather]] was the determining factor. However, she found that in [[urbanisation|urbanised]] and [[industrialisation|industrialised]] areas the pattern had been disrupted. Her 1966 article on the topic, published in the journal ''Ecology'', has formed the basis for subsequent research by other scientists.\n\n===Selenium and AIDS===\nIn 1997, Cowgill gauged the selenium content of soil in various locations in the [[United States]] by measuring the amount of the mineral that was absorbed by [[alfalfa]]. She then correlated this information with the mortality rate of [[AIDS]] in the area. She found that the more selenium there was in the soil, the lower mortality from AIDS was. The relationship was especially strong among [[African-Americans]].\n\n==Publications==\n*{{cite journal |jstor=71188 |pages=238\u201341 |last1=Cowgill |first1=U.

Three [[species]] are universally recognized: ''P. walkeri'' (the [[type species]]), ''P. tubicen'', and the short-crested ''P. cyrtocristatus''. Additionally, a fourth species, ''P. jiayensis'', has been proposed, although it is more commonly placed in the separate genus ''[[Charonosaurus]]''. Remains are known from [[Alberta]] (Canada), [[New Mexico]] and [[Utah]] (United States), and possibly [[Heilongjiang]], (China). The genus was first described in 1922 by [[William Parks (paleontologist)|William Parks]] from a [[skull]] and partial skeleton found in Alberta.\n\n''Parasaurolophus'' was a [[hadrosaurid]], part of a diverse [[family (biology)|family]] of Cretaceous dinosaurs known for their range of bizarre head adornments. This genus is known for its large, elaborate cranial crest, which at its largest forms a long curved tube projecting upwards and back from the [[skull]]. ''[[Charonosaurus]]'' from China, which may have been its closest relative, had a similar skull and potentially a similar crest. Visual recognition of both species and sex, acoustic resonance, and [[thermoregulation]] have been proposed as functional explanations for the crest. It is one of the rarer hadrosaurids, known from only a handful of good specimens.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Human-parasaurolophus size comparison.svg|thumb|left|Size of a ''P. walkeri'' (10 metres long) compared to a human (1.8 metres tall)]]\n[[File:Parasaurolophus walkeri.png|thumb|Restoration of ''P. walkeri'']]\nLike most dinosaurs, the skeleton of ''Parasaurolophus'' is incompletely known. The length of the [[type specimen]] of ''P. walkeri'' is estimated at {{convert|9.5|m|abbr=on}}, and its weight is estimated at {{convert|2.5|t|ST}}.{{sfn|Glut|1997}} Its skull is about {{convert|1.6|m|abbr=on}} long, including the crest, whereas the type skull of ''P. tubicen'' is over {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} long, indicating a larger animal.{{sfn|Lull|Wright|1942}} Its single known forelimb was relatively short for a hadrosaurid, with a short but wide [[scapula|shoulder blade]]. The [[femur|thighbone]] measures {{convert|103|cm|abbr=on}} long in ''P. walkeri'' and is robust for its length when compared to other hadrosaurids.{{sfn|Lull|Wright|1942}} The [[humerus|upper arm]] and [[pelvis|pelvic]] bones were also heavily built.{{sfn|Brett-Surman|Wagner|2006}}\n\nLike other hadrosaurids, it was able to walk on either two legs or four. It probably preferred to forage for food on four legs, but ran on two.{{sfn|Weishampel et al.|2004}} The [[spinous process|neural spines]] of the [[vertebra]]e were tall, as was common in lambeosaurines;{{sfn|Lull|Wright|1942}} tallest over the hips, they increased the height of the back. [[Integumentary system|Skin]] impressions are known for ''P. walkeri'', showing uniform tubercle-like scales but no larger structures.{{sfn|Parks|1922}}\n\n===Skull=== \n[[File: Head of Parasaurolophus.jpg|thumb|''P. walkeri'' skull cast]]\nThe most noticeable feature was the cranial crest, which protruded from the rear of the head and was made up of the [[premaxilla]] and [[nasal bone]]s.{{sfn|Lull|Wright|1942}} William Parks, who named the genus, hypothesized that a [[ligament]] ran from the crest to the notch to support the head, and cited the presence of possibly pathological notch as evidence.{{sfn|Parks|1922}} Although this idea seems unlikely,{{sfn|Glut|1997}} ''Parasaurolophus'' is sometimes restored with a skin flap from the crest to the neck. The crest was hollow, with distinct tubes leading from each nostril to the end of the crest before reversing direction and heading back down the crest and into the skull. The tubes were simplest in ''P. walkeri'', and more complex in ''P. tubicen'', where some tubes were blind and others met and separated.{{sfn|Sullivan|Williamson|1999}} While ''P. walkeri'' and ''P. tubicen'' had long crests with only slight curvature, ''P. cyrtocristatus'' had a short crest with a more circular profile.{{sfn|Ostrom|1961}}\n\n==Discovery and naming==\n[[File:Parasaurolophus walkeri.jpg|thumb|Holotype specimen of ''P. walkeri'', showing the pathologic v-shaped notch]]\nMeaning \"near crested lizard\", the name ''Parasaurolophus'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''para''/\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1 \"beside\" or \"near\", ''saurus''/\u03c3\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \"lizard\" and ''lophos''/\u03bb\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 \"crest\".{{sfn|Liddell|Scott|1980}} It is [[holotype|based on]] [[Royal Ontario Museum|ROM]] 768, a skull and partial skeleton missing most of the tail and the hind legs below the knees, which was found by a field party from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1920 near Sand Creek along the [[Red Deer River]] in Alberta, Canada.{{sfn|Parks|1922}} These rocks are now known as the [[Campanian]]-age [[Upper Cretaceous]] [[Dinosaur Park Formation]]. William Parks named the specimen ''P. walkeri'' in honor of Sir [[Byron Edmund Walker]], Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the [[Royal Ontario Museum]].{{sfn|Parks|1922}} ''Parasaurolophus'' remains are rare in Alberta,{{sfn|Currie|Koppelhus|2005}} with only one other partial skull from (probably) the Dinosaur Park Formation,{{sfn|Evans|Reisz|2007}} and three Dinosaur Park specimens lacking skulls, possibly belonging to the genus.{{sfn|Currie|Koppelhus|2005}} In some faunal lists, there is a mention of possible ''P. walkeri'' material in the [[Hell Creek Formation]] of [[Montana]], a rock unit of [[Maastrichtian|late Maastrichtian]] age.{{sfn|Weishampel et al.|2004}} This occurrence is not noted by Sullivan and Williamson in their 1999 review of the genus,{{sfn|Sullivan|Williamson|1999}} and has not been further elaborated upon elsewhere.\n\nIn 1921, [[Charles Hazelius Sternberg|Charles H. Sternberg]] recovered a partial skull ([[Uppsala University|PMU]].R1250) from what is now known as the slightly younger [[Kirtland Formation]] in [[San Juan County, New Mexico|San Juan County]], New Mexico. This specimen was sent to [[Uppsala]], Sweden, where [[Carl Wiman]] described it as a second species, ''P. tubicen'', in 1931.{{sfn|Wiman|1931}} The specific epithet is derived from the [[Latin]] ''t\u01d4b\u01d0c\u011bn'' \"trumpeter\".{{sfn|Simpson|1979}} A second, nearly complete ''P. tubicen'' skull ([[New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science|NMMNH]] P-25100) was found in New Mexico in 1995. Using [[computed tomography]] of this skull, Robert Sullivan and Thomas Williamson gave the genus a [[monograph]]ic treatment in 1999, covering aspects of its anatomy and taxonomy, and the functions of its crest.{{sfn|Sullivan|Williamson|1999}} Williamson later published an independent review of the remains, disagreeing with the taxonomic conclusions.{{sfn|Williamson|2000}}\n\n[[John Ostrom]] described another good specimen ([[Field Museum of Natural History|FMNH]] P27393) from New Mexico as ''P. cyrtocristatus'' in 1961. It includes a partial skull with a short, rounded crest, and much of the [[postcrania]]l skeleton except for the feet, neck, and parts of the tail.{{sfn|Ostrom|1961}} Its specific name is derived from the [[Latin]] ''curtus'' \"shortened\" and  ''cristatus'' \"crested\".{{sfn|Simpson|1979}} The specimen was found in either the top of the [[Fruitland Formation]] or, more likely, the base of the overlying Kirtland Formation.{{sfn|Sullivan|Williamson|1999}} The range of this species was expanded in 1979, when [[David B.

Its teeth were continually being replaced; they were packed into dental batteries containing hundreds of teeth, only a relative handful of which were in use at any time. It used its beak to crop plant material, which was held in the jaws by a [[cheek]]-like organ. Vegetation could have been taken from the ground up to a height of around {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.{{sfn|Horner et al.|2004}} As noted by [[Bob Bakker]], lambeosaurines have narrower beaks than hadrosaurines, implying that ''Parasaurolophus'' and its relatives could feed more selectively than their broad-beaked, crestless counterparts.{{sfn|Bakker|1986}}\n\n===Growth===\n[[File:Parasaurolophus juvenile skeleton.png|upright|thumb|left|Juvenile skeleton RAM 14000]] \n''Parasaurolophus'' is known from many adult specimens, and a  juvenile described in 2013. The juvenile was discovered in the [[Kaiparowits Formation]] in 2009. Excavated by the joint expedition by [[The Webb Schools]] and [[Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology]] (RAM), the juvenile has been identified as around only one year old when it died. Referred to ''Parasaurolophus'' sp., the juvenile, under specimen number RAM 14000, is the most complete, as well as youngest ''Parasaurolophus'' ever found, and measures {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}. This individual fits neatly into the currently known ''Parasaurolophus'' growth stages, and lived approximately 75&nbsp;million years ago. Even though no complete skull of the intermediate age between RAM 14000 and adult ''Parasaurolophus'' has been found yet, a partial braincase of about the right size is known. At 25% of the total adult size, the juvenile show that crest growth of ''Parasaurolophus'' began sooner than in related genera, such as ''Corythosaurus''. It has been suggested that ''Parasaurolophus'' adults bore such large crests, especially when compared to the related ''Corythosaurus'', because of this difference in age between when their crests started developing. Its age also means that ''Parasaurolophus'' had a very fast growth rate, which took place in about a year. The crest of the juvenile is not long and tubular like the adults, but low and hemispherical.{{sfn|Farke et al.|2013}}\n[[File:Parasaurolophus reconstructed skeleton.png|thumb|alt=Juvenile skeleton|Reconstruction of a juvenile skeleton, based on RAM 14000]]\nThe skull of RAM 14000 is almost complete, with the left side only lacking a piece of the [[maxilla]]. However, the skull was split down the middle by [[erosion]], possibly when it was resting on the bottom of a [[river bed]]. The two sides are displaced slightly, with some bones of the right being moved off the main block, also by erosion. After reconstruction, the skull viewed from the side resembles other juvenile lambeosaurines found, being roughly a [[trapezoid]] in shape.{{sfn|Farke et al.|2013}}\n\nA partial cranial endocast for RAM 14000 was reconstructed from CT scan data, the first ever for a ''Parasaurolophus'' of any ontogenetic stage. The endocast was reconstructed in two sections, one on the portion of the braincase articulated with the left half of the skull and the remainder on the disarticulated portion of the braincase. Their relative position was then approximated based on cranial landmarks and comparison with other hadrosaurids. Because of weathering, many of the smaller neural canals and foramina could not be identified for certain.{{sfn|Farke et al.|2013}}\n\n===Cranial crest===\n[[File:Parasaurolophus Cranial Crest.svg|thumb|Diagram showing internal features of the crest]]\nMany hypotheses have been advanced as to what functions the cranial crest of ''Parasaurolophus'' performed, but most have been discredited.{{sfn|Glut|1997}}{{sfn|Norman|1985}} It is now believed that it may have had several functions: visual display for identifying species and sex, sound amplification for communication, and thermoregulation. It is not clear which was most significant at what times in the evolution of the crest and its internal nasal passages.{{sfn|Evans|2006}}\n\n====Differences in crests====\nAs for other lambeosaurines, it is believed that the cranial crest of ''Parasaurolophus'' changed with age and was a [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] characteristic in adults. [[James Hopson]], one of the first researchers to describe lambeosaurine crests in terms of such distinctions, suggested that ''P. cyrtocristatus'', with its small crest, was the female form of ''P. tubicen''.{{sfn|Hopson|1975}} Thomas Williamson suggested it was the [[juvenile (organism)|juvenile]] form. Neither hypothesis became widely accepted. As only six good skulls, one juvenile braincase,{{sfn|Williamson|2000}} and one recently discovered juvenile skull are known,{{sfn|Farke et al.|2013}} additional material will help clear up these potential relationships. Williamson noted that in any case, juvenile ''Parasaurolophus'' probably had small, rounded crests like ''P. cyrtocristatus'', that probably grew faster as individuals approached [[sexual maturity]].{{sfn|Williamson|2000}} Recent restudy of a juvenile braincase previously assigned to ''Lambeosaurus'', now assigned to ''Parasaurolophus'', provides evidence that a small tubular crest was present in juveniles. This specimen preserves a small upward flaring of the [[frontal bone]]s that was similar to but smaller than what is seen in adult specimens; in adults, the frontals formed a platform that supported the base of the crest. This specimen also indicates that the growth of the crest in ''Parasaurolophus'' and the facial profile of juvenile individuals differed from the ''Corythosaurus''-''Hypacrosaurus''-''Lambeosaurus'' model, in part because the crest of ''Parasaurolophus'' lacks the thin bony 'coxcomb' that makes up the upper portion of the crest of the other three lambeosaurines.{{sfn|Evans|Reisz|2007}}\n\n====Rejected function hypotheses====\nMany early suggestions focused on adaptations for an aquatic lifestyle, following the hypothesis that hadrosaurids were amphibious, a common line of thought until the 1960s. Thus, [[Alfred Sherwood Romer]] proposed it served as a [[Snorkel (swimming)|snorkel]],{{sfn|Romer|1933}} Martin Wilfarth that it was an attachment for a mobile [[proboscis]] used as a breathing tube or for food gathering,{{sfn|Wilfarth|1947}} [[Charles Mortram Sternberg|Charles M. Sternberg]] that it served as an airtrap to keep water out of the [[lung]]s,{{sfn|Sternberg|1935}} and [[Edwin Harris Colbert|Ned Colbert]] that it served as an air reservoir for prolonged stays underwater.{{sfn|Colbert|1945}}\n\nOther proposals were more physical in nature. As mentioned above, William Parks suggested that it was joined to the vertebrae with [[ligament]]s or muscles, and helped with moving and supporting the head.{{sfn|Parks|1922}} [[Othenio Abel]] proposed it was used as a weapon in combat among members of the same species,{{sfn|Abel|1924}} and Andrew Milner suggested that it could be used as a foliage deflector, like the helmet crest (called a 'casque') of the [[cassowary]].{{sfn|Norman|1985}} Still, other proposals made housing specialized organs the major function. [[Halszka Osm\u00f3lska]] suggested that it housed [[salt gland]]s,{{sfn|Maryanska|Osmolska|1979}} and John Ostrom suggested that it housed expanded areas for [[olfactory epithelium|olfactory tissue]] and much improved [[olfaction|sense of smell]] of the lambeosaurines, which had no obvious defensive capabilities.{{sfn|Ostrom|1962}}\n\nMost of these hypotheses have been discredited or rejected.{{sfn|Glut|1997}} For example, there is no hole at the end of the crest for a snorkeling function. There are no muscle scars for a proboscis and it is dubious that an animal with a beak would need one. As a proposed airlock, it would not have kept out water. The proposed air reservoir would have been insufficient for an animal the size of ''Parasaurolophus''. Other hadrosaurids had large heads without needing large hollow crests to serve as attachment points for supporting ligaments.{{sfn|Ostrom|1962}} Also, none of the proposals explain why the crest has such a shape, why other lambeosaurines should have crests that look much different but perform a similar function, how crestless or solid-crested hadrosaurids got along without such capabilities, or why some hadrosaurids had solid crests. These considerations particularly impact hypotheses based on increasing the capabilities of systems already present in the animal, such as the salt gland and olfaction hypotheses,{{sfn|Norman|1985}} and indicate that these were not primary functions of the crest. Additionally, work on the nasal cavity of lambeosaurines shows that [[olfactory nerve]]s and corresponding sensory tissue were largely outside the portion of the nasal passages in the crest, so the expansion of the crest had little to do with the sense of smell.{{sfn|Evans|2006}}\n\n====Temperature regulation hypothesis====\nThe large surface area and [[vascularization]] of the crest also suggests a thermoregulatory function.{{sfn|Sullivan|Williamson|1996}} The first to propose the cranial crests of lambeosaurines related to temperature regulation was Wheeler (1978). He proposed that there was a nerve connection between the crest and the [[brain]], so that the latter could be cooled by the former.{{sfn|Wheeler|1978}}{{sfn|Weishampel|1997}} The next people to publish a related idea were [[Teresa Marya\u0144ska]] and Osm\u00f3lska, who realized that like modern lizards, dinosaurs could have possessed salt glands, and cooled off by osmo-regulation.{{sfn|Weishampel|1997}}{{sfn|Maryanska|Osmolska|1979}} In 2006 Evans published an argument about the functions of lambeosaurine crests, and supported why this could be a causing factor for the evolution of the crest.{{sfn|Evans|2006}}\n\n====Behavioural hypotheses====\n[[File:Parasaurolophus with frill.jpg|thumb|Restoration of ''P. walkeri'' with hypothetical skin frill]]\n''Parasaurolophus'' is often hypothesized to have used its crest as a resonating chamber to produce low frequency sounds to alert other members of a group or its species.{{sfn|Weishampel|1981}} This function was originally suggested by Wiman in 1931 when he described ''P. tubicen''. He noted that the crests internal structures are similar to those of a swan and theorized that an animal could use its elongated nasal passages to create noise.{{sfn|Weishampel|1981}}{{sfn|Wiman|1931}} However, the nasal tubes of ''Hypacrosaurus'', ''Corythosaurus'', and ''Lambeosaurus'' are much more variable and complicated than the airway of ''Parasaurolophus''. A large amount of material and data supports the hypothesis that the large, tubular crest of ''Parasaurolophus'' was a resonating chamber. Weishampel in 1981 suggested that ''Parasaurolophus'' made noises ranging between the [[frequencies]] 55 and 720 [[Hertz|Hz]], although there was some difference in the range of individual species because of the crest size, shape, and nasal passage length, most obvious in ''P. cyrtocristatus'' (interpreted as a possible female).{{sfn|Weishampel|1981}} Hopson found that there is anatomical evidence that hadrosaurids had a strong hearing. There is at least one example, in the related ''Corythosaurus'', of a slender stapes (reptilian ear bone) in place, which combined with a large space for an eardrum implies a sensitive middle ear. Furthermore, the hadrosaurid lagena is elongate like a crocodilian's, indicating that the auditory portion of the inner ear was well-developed.{{sfn|Hopson|1975}} Based on the similarity of hadrosaurid [[inner ears]] to those of [[crocodiles]], he also proposed that adult hadrosaurids were sensitive to high frequencies, such as their offspring might produce. According to Weishampel, this is consistent with parents and offspring communicating.{{sfn|Weishampel|1981}}\n\nComputer modeling of a well-preserved specimen of ''P. tubicen'', with more complex air passages than those of ''P. walkeri'', has allowed the reconstruction of the possible sound its crest produced.{{sfn|Sandia|1997}} The main path resonates at around 30&nbsp;Hz, but the complicated sinus anatomy causes peaks and valleys in the sound.{{sfn|Diegert|Williamson|1998}}\nThe other main behavioral theory is that the crest was used for intra-species recognition.{{sfn|Weishampel|1997}} This means that the crest could have been used for species recognition, as a warning signal, and for other, non-sexual uses. These could have been some of the reasons crests evolved in ''Parasaurolophus'' and other hadrosaurids.{{sfn|Hone et al.|2011}} Instead, social and [[physiology of dinosaurs|physiological]] functions have become more supported as function(s) of the crest, focusing on [[visual perception|visual]] and [[hearing (sense)|auditory]] identification and communication. As a large object, the crest has clear value as a visual signal and sets this animal apart from its contemporaries. The large size of hadrosaurid [[orbit (anatomy)|eye sockets]] and the presence of [[sclerotic ring]]s in the eyes imply acute vision and [[Diurnality|diurnal]] habits, evidence that sight was important to these animals. If, as is commonly illustrated, a skin frill extended from the crest to the neck or back, the proposed visual display would have been even showier.{{sfn|Hopson|1975}} As is suggested by other lambeosaurine skulls, the crest of ''Parasaurolophus'' likely permitted both species identification (such as separating it from ''Corythosaurus'' or ''Lambeosaurus'') and sexual identification by shape and size.{{sfn|Evans|2006}}\n\n===Paleopathology===\n''Parasaurolophus walkeri'' is known from one specimen which might contain a [[pathology]]. The skeleton shows a v-shaped gap or notch in the vertebrae at the base of the neck.{{sfn|Benson et al.|2012}} Originally thought to be pathologic, Parks published a second interpretation of this, as a ligament attachment to support the head. The crest would attach to the gap via muscles or ligaments, and be used to support the head while bearing a frill, like predicted to exist in some hadrosaurids.{{sfn|Parks|1922}} One other possibility, is that during preparation, the specimen was damaged, creating the possible pathology.{{sfn|Benson et al.|2012}} The notch, however, is still considered more likely to be a pathology,{{sfn|Benson et al.|2012}}{{sfn|Glut|1997}} even though some illustrations of ''Parasaurolophus'' restore the skin flap.{{sfn|Sullivan|Williamson|1999}}\n\nAnother possible pathology was noticed by Parks, and from around the notch. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth vertebrae, directly anterior to the notch, the neural spines were damaged. The fourth had an obvious fracture, with the other two possessing a swelling at the base of the break.{{sfn|Parks|1922}}\n\n==Paleoecology==\n===Alberta===\n[[File:Map cretaceous Parasaurolophus.svg|thumb|Left|Locations of fossil finds, written in French.]]\n''Parasaurolophus walkeri'', from the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]], was a member of a diverse and well-documented [[fauna]] of prehistoric animals, including well-known dinosaurs such as the [[ceratopsidae|horned]] ''[[Centrosaurus]]'', ''[[Chasmosaurus]]'', and ''[[Styracosaurus]]''; fellow duckbills ''[[Gryposaurus]]'' and ''Corythosaurus''; [[tyrannosaurid]] ''[[Gorgosaurus]]''; and [[ankylosauridae|armored]] ''[[Edmontonia]]'', ''[[Euoplocephalus]]'' and ''[[Dyoplosaurus]]''.{{sfn|Weishampel et al.|2004}} It was a rare constituent of this fauna.{{sfn|Currie|Koppelhus|2005}} The Dinosaur Park Formation is interpreted as a low-relief setting of [[river]]s and [[floodplain]]s that became more [[swamp]]y and influenced by [[ocean|marine]] conditions over time as the [[Western Interior Seaway]] [[transgression (geology)|transgressed]] westward.{{sfn|Currie|Koppelhus|2005}} The [[climate]] was warmer than present-day Alberta, without [[frost]], but with wetter and drier seasons. [[Conifer]]s were apparently the dominant [[forest canopy|canopy]] plants, with an [[understory]] of [[fern]]s, [[tree fern]]s, and [[angiosperm]]s.{{sfn|Currie|Koppelhus|2005}}\n\nSome of the less common hadrosaurs in the Dinosaur Park Formation of Dinosaur Provincial Park, such as ''Parasaurolophus'', may represent the remains of individuals who died while migrating through the region. They might also have had a more upland habitat where they may have nested or fed. The presence of ''Parasaurolophus'' and ''Kritosaurus'' in northern latitude fossil sites may represent faunal exchange between otherwise distinct northern and southern biomes in Late Cretaceous North America. Both taxa are uncommon outside of the southern biome, where, along with ''[[Pentaceratops]]'', they are predominate members of the fauna.{{sfn|Tanke|Carpenter|2001}}\n\n===New Mexico===\n[[File:GorgosaurusDB.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Teratophoneus]]'' attacking a ''P. cyrtocristatus'']]\nIn the [[Fruitland Formation]] of New Mexico, ''P. cyrtocristatus'' shared its habitat with other ornithischians and theropods.

The plateau where dinosaurs lived was an ancient floodplain dominated by large channels and abundant wetland [[peat]] swamps, ponds and lakes, and was bordered by highlands. The climate was wet and humid, and supported an abundant and diverse range of organisms.{{sfn|Titus|Loewen|2013}} This formation contains one of the best and most continuous records of Late Cretaceous terrestrial life in the world.{{sfn|Clinton|1996}}\n\n''Parasaurolophus'' shared its [[natural environment|paleoenvironment]] with other dinosaurs, such as [[dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurid]] [[theropod]]s, the [[troodontidae|troodontid]] ''[[Talos sampsoni]]'', [[ornithomimids]] like ''[[Ornithomimus|Ornithomimus velox]]'', [[tyrannosaurids]] like ''[[Albertosaurus]]'' and ''[[Teratophoneus]]'', [[ankylosauria|armored ankylosaurids]], the [[hadrosaurid|duckbilled hadrosaur]] ''[[Gryposaurus|Gryposaurus monumentensis]]'', the [[ceratopsians]] ''[[Utahceratops|Utahceratops gettyi]]'', ''[[Nasutoceratops titusi]]'' and ''[[Kosmoceratops|Kosmoceratops richardsoni]]'' and the [[oviraptorosauria]]n ''[[Hagryphus|Hagryphus giganteus]]''.{{sfn|Zanno|Sampson|2005}} Paleofauna present in the Kaiparowits Formation included [[chondrichthyes|chondrichthyans]] (sharks and rays), [[frog]]s, [[salamander]]s, [[turtle]]s, [[lizard]]s and [[crocodilia]]ns.

Three [[species]] are universally recognized: ''P. walkeri'' (the [[type species]]), ''P. tubicen'', and the short-crested ''P. cyrtocristatus''. Additionally, a fourth species, ''P. jiayensis'', has been proposed, although it is more commonly placed in the separate genus ''[[Charonosaurus]]''. Remains are known from [[Alberta]] (Canada), [[New Mexico]] and [[Utah]] (United States), and possibly [[Heilongjiang]], (China). The genus was first described in 1922 by [[William Parks (paleontologist)|William Parks]] from a [[skull]] and partial skeleton found in Alberta.\n\n''Parasaurolophus'' was a [[hadrosaurid]], part of a diverse [[family (biology)|family]] of Cretaceous dinosaurs known for their range of bizarre head adornments. This genus is known for its large, elaborate cranial crest, which at its largest forms a long curved tube projecting upwards and back from the [[skull]]. ''[[Charonosaurus]]'' from China, which may have been its closest relative, had a similar skull and potentially a similar crest. Visual recognition of both species and sex, acoustic resonance, and [[thermoregulation]] have been proposed as functional explanations for the crest. It is one of the rarer hadrosaurids, known from only a handful of good specimens.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Human-parasaurolophus size comparison.svg|thumb|left|Size of a ''P. walkeri'' (10 metres long) compared to a human (1.8 metres tall)]]\n[[File:Parasaurolophus walkeri.png|thumb|Restoration of ''P. walkeri'']]\nLike most dinosaurs, the skeleton of ''Parasaurolophus'' is incompletely known. The length of the [[type specimen]] of ''P. walkeri'' is estimated at {{convert|9.5|m|abbr=on}}, and its weight is estimated at {{convert|2.5|t|ST}}.{{sfn|Glut|1997}} Its skull is about {{convert|1.6|m|abbr=on}} long, including the crest, whereas the type skull of ''P. tubicen'' is over {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} long, indicating a larger animal.{{sfn|Lull|Wright|1942}} Its single known forelimb was relatively short for a hadrosaurid, with a short but wide [[scapula|shoulder blade]]. The [[femur|thighbone]] measures {{convert|103|cm|abbr=on}} long in ''P. walkeri'' and is robust for its length when compared to other hadrosaurids.{{sfn|Lull|Wright|1942}} The [[humerus|upper arm]] and [[pelvis|pelvic]] bones were also heavily built.{{sfn|Brett-Surman|Wagner|2006}}\n\nLike other hadrosaurids, it was able to walk on either two legs or four. It probably preferred to forage for food on four legs, but ran on two.{{sfn|Weishampel et al.|2004}} The [[spinous process|neural spines]] of the [[vertebra]]e were tall, as was common in lambeosaurines;{{sfn|Lull|Wright|1942}} tallest over the hips, they increased the height of the back. [[Integumentary system|Skin]] impressions are known for ''P. walkeri'', showing uniform tubercle-like scales but no larger structures.{{sfn|Parks|1922}}\n\n===Skull=== \n[[File: Head of Parasaurolophus.jpg|thumb|''P. walkeri'' skull cast]]\nThe most noticeable feature was the cranial crest, which protruded from the rear of the head and was made up of the [[premaxilla]] and [[nasal bone]]s.{{sfn|Lull|Wright|1942}} William Parks, who named the genus, hypothesized that a [[ligament]] ran from the crest to the notch to support the head, and cited the presence of possibly pathological notch as evidence.{{sfn|Parks|1922}} Although this idea seems unlikely,{{sfn|Glut|1997}} ''Parasaurolophus'' is sometimes restored with a skin flap from the crest to the neck. The crest was hollow, with distinct tubes leading from each nostril to the end of the crest before reversing direction and heading back down the crest and into the skull. The tubes were simplest in ''P. walkeri'', and more complex in ''P. tubicen'', where some tubes were blind and others met and separated.{{sfn|Sullivan|Williamson|1999}} While ''P. walkeri'' and ''P. tubicen'' had long crests with only slight curvature, ''P. cyrtocristatus'' had a short crest with a more circular profile.{{sfn|Ostrom|1961}}\n\n==Discovery and naming==\n[[File:Parasaurolophus walkeri.jpg|thumb|Holotype specimen of ''P. walkeri'', showing the pathologic v-shaped notch]]\nMeaning \"near crested lizard\", the name ''Parasaurolophus'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''para''/\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1 \"beside\" or \"near\", ''saurus''/\u03c3\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \"lizard\" and ''lophos''/\u03bb\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 \"crest\".{{sfn|Liddell|Scott|1980}} It is [[holotype|based on]] [[Royal Ontario Museum|ROM]] 768, a skull and partial skeleton missing most of the tail and the hind legs below the knees, which was found by a field party from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1920 near Sand Creek along the [[Red Deer River]] in Alberta, Canada.{{sfn|Parks|1922}} These rocks are now known as the [[Campanian]]-age [[Upper Cretaceous]] [[Dinosaur Park Formation]]. William Parks named the specimen ''P. walkeri'' in honor of Sir [[Byron Edmund Walker]], Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the [[Royal Ontario Museum]].{{sfn|Parks|1922}} ''Parasaurolophus'' remains are rare in Alberta,{{sfn|Currie|Koppelhus|2005}} with only one other partial skull from (probably) the Dinosaur Park Formation,{{sfn|Evans|Reisz|2007}} and three Dinosaur Park specimens lacking skulls, possibly belonging to the genus.{{sfn|Currie|Koppelhus|2005}} In some faunal lists, there is a mention of possible ''P. walkeri'' material in the [[Hell Creek Formation]] of [[Montana]], a rock unit of [[Maastrichtian|late Maastrichtian]] age.{{sfn|Weishampel et al.|2004}} This occurrence is not noted by Sullivan and Williamson in their 1999 review of the genus,{{sfn|Sullivan|Williamson|1999}} and has not been further elaborated upon elsewhere.\n\nIn 1921, [[Charles Hazelius Sternberg|Charles H. Sternberg]] recovered a partial skull ([[Uppsala University|PMU]].R1250) from what is now known as the slightly younger [[Kirtland Formation]] in [[San Juan County, New Mexico|San Juan County]], New Mexico. This specimen was sent to [[Uppsala]], Sweden, where [[Carl Wiman]] described it as a second species, ''P. tubicen'', in 1931.{{sfn|Wiman|1931}} The specific epithet is derived from the [[Latin]] ''t\u01d4b\u01d0c\u011bn'' \"trumpeter\".{{sfn|Simpson|1979}} A second, nearly complete ''P. tubicen'' skull ([[New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science|NMMNH]] P-25100) was found in New Mexico in 1995. Using [[computed tomography]] of this skull, Robert Sullivan and Thomas Williamson gave the genus a [[monograph]]ic treatment in 1999, covering aspects of its anatomy and taxonomy, and the functions of its crest.{{sfn|Sullivan|Williamson|1999}} Williamson later published an independent review of the remains, disagreeing with the taxonomic conclusions.{{sfn|Williamson|2000}}\n\n[[John Ostrom]] described another good specimen ([[Field Museum of Natural History|FMNH]] P27393) from New Mexico as ''P. cyrtocristatus'' in 1961. It includes a partial skull with a short, rounded crest, and much of the [[postcrania]]l skeleton except for the feet, neck, and parts of the tail.{{sfn|Ostrom|1961}} Its specific name is derived from the [[Latin]] ''curtus'' \"shortened\" and  ''cristatus'' \"crested\".{{sfn|Simpson|1979}} The specimen was found in either the top of the [[Fruitland Formation]] or, more likely, the base of the overlying Kirtland Formation.{{sfn|Sullivan|Williamson|1999}} The range of this species was expanded in 1979, when [[David B. Weishampel]] and [[James A. Jensen]] described a partial skull with a similar crest ([[Brigham Young University|BYU]] 2467) from the Campanian-age [[Kaiparowits Formation]] of [[Garfield County, Utah|Garfield County]], [[Utah]].{{sfn|Weishampel|Jensen|1979}} Since then, another skull has been found in Utah with the short/round ''P. cyrtocristatus'' crest morphology.{{sfn|Sullivan|Williamson|1999}}\n\n===Species===\n[[File:Hadrosauridae fossils at the CMNH.jpg|thumb|left|''P. tubicen'' crest and other hadrosaur material, [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]]]] \n''Parasaurolophus'' is known from three certain species, ''P. walkeri'', ''P. tubicen'', and ''P. cyrtocristatus''.{{sfn|Evans et al.|2009}} All of them can be distinguished from each other, and have many differences.{{sfn|Hone et al.|2011}}{{sfn|Benson et al.|2012}} The first named species, therefore the [[type species|type]], is ''P. walkeri''. One certain specimen, from the Dinosaur Park Formation is referred to it,{{sfn|Horner et al.|2004}} but many more are almost certainly referable.{{sfn|Evans et al.|2009}} Like stated above, it is different from the other two species, with it having a simpler internal structure than ''P. tubicen'',{{sfn|Sullivan|Williamson|1999}} a straighter crest and different internal structuring than ''P. cyrtocristatus''.{{sfn|Hone et al.|2011}}\n\nThe next named species is ''P. tubicen'', which is the largest of the ''Parasaurolophus'' species.{{sfn|Sullivan|Williamson|1999}} It lived in New Mexico, where three specimens are known,{{sfn|Horner et al.|2004}} and can be differentiated from its other species.{{sfn|Hone et al.|2011}} It possesses a long and straight crest, with a very complex interior compared to the other species.{{sfn|Sullivan|Williamson|1999}} All known specimens of ''P. tubicen'' come from the De-Na-Zin Member of the [[Kirtland Formation]].{{sfn|Sullivan et al.|2011}}\n[[File:Parasaurolophus cyrtocristatus 1 salt lake city.jpg|thumb|''P. cyrtocristatus'' skeleton, [[Natural History Museum of Utah]]]] \nIn 1961, the third species, ''P. cyrtocristatus'' was named by [[John Ostrom]].{{sfn|Ostrom|1961}} Its three known specimens, have been found in the [[Fruitland Formation|Fruitland]] and [[Kaiparowits Formation|Kaiparowits]] formations from Utah and New Mexico.{{sfn|Evans et al.|2009}} The second specimen, the first known from the Kaiparowits Formation, was originally unassigned to a specific taxon.{{sfn|Weishampel|Jensen|1979}} Of the ''Parasaurolophus'' species, ''P. cyrtocristatus'' it is the smallest, and has the most curved crest.{{sfn|Sullivan|Williamson|1999}} Because of its possession of the two above features, it has often been speculated that it was a female of ''P. walkeri'' or ''P. tubicen'', which were males,{{sfn|Hone et al.|2011}}{{sfn|Weishampel|1981}} although ''P. tubicen'' lived approximately a million years later.{{sfn|Evans et al.|2009}} As noted by Thomas Williamson, the type material of ''P. cyrtocristatus'' is about 72% the size of ''P. tubicen'', close to the size at which other lambeosaurines are interpreted to begin showing definitive [[sexual dimorphism]] in their crests (~70% of adult size).{{sfn|Williamson|2000}} Even though many scientists have supported the possible fact of ''P. cyrtocristatus'' being a female,{{sfn|Weishampel|1981}}{{sfn|Hopson|1975}} many other studies have found that it is not,{{sfn|Horner et al.|2004}}{{sfn|Evans|Reisz|2007}} because of the differences in age, distribution, and the large differences in the crest and its internal structure.{{sfn|Hone et al.|2011}}\n\nA  study published in ''[[PLoS ONE]]'' in 2014 found that one more species could be referred to ''Parasaurolophus''.

Its teeth were continually being replaced; they were packed into dental batteries containing hundreds of teeth, only a relative handful of which were in use at any time. It used its beak to crop plant material, which was held in the jaws by a [[cheek]]-like organ. Vegetation could have been taken from the ground up to a height of around {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.{{sfn|Horner et al.|2004}} As noted by [[Bob Bakker]], lambeosaurines have narrower beaks than hadrosaurines, implying that ''Parasaurolophus'' and its relatives could feed more selectively than their broad-beaked, crestless counterparts.{{sfn|Bakker|1986}}\n\n===Growth===\n[[File:Parasaurolophus juvenile skeleton.png|upright|thumb|left|Juvenile skeleton RAM 14000]] \n''Parasaurolophus'' is known from many adult specimens, and a  juvenile described in 2013. The juvenile was discovered in the [[Kaiparowits Formation]] in 2009. Excavated by the joint expedition by [[The Webb Schools]] and [[Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology]] (RAM), the juvenile has been identified as around only one year old when it died. Referred to ''Parasaurolophus'' sp., the juvenile, under specimen number RAM 14000, is the most complete, as well as youngest ''Parasaurolophus'' ever found, and measures {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}. This individual fits neatly into the currently known ''Parasaurolophus'' growth stages, and lived approximately 75&nbsp;million years ago. Even though no complete skull of the intermediate age between RAM 14000 and adult ''Parasaurolophus'' has been found yet, a partial braincase of about the right size is known. At 25% of the total adult size, the juvenile show that crest growth of ''Parasaurolophus'' began sooner than in related genera, such as ''Corythosaurus''. It has been suggested that ''Parasaurolophus'' adults bore such large crests, especially when compared to the related ''Corythosaurus'', because of this difference in age between when their crests started developing. Its age also means that ''Parasaurolophus'' had a very fast growth rate, which took place in about a year. The crest of the juvenile is not long and tubular like the adults, but low and hemispherical.{{sfn|Farke et al.|2013}}\n[[File:Parasaurolophus reconstructed skeleton.png|thumb|alt=Juvenile skeleton|Reconstruction of a juvenile skeleton, based on RAM 14000]]\nThe skull of RAM 14000 is almost complete, with the left side only lacking a piece of the [[maxilla]]. However, the skull was split down the middle by [[erosion]], possibly when it was resting on the bottom of a [[river bed]]. The two sides are displaced slightly, with some bones of the right being moved off the main block, also by erosion. After reconstruction, the skull viewed from the side resembles other juvenile lambeosaurines found, being roughly a [[trapezoid]] in shape.{{sfn|Farke et al.|2013}}\n\nA partial cranial endocast for RAM 14000 was reconstructed from CT scan data, the first ever for a ''Parasaurolophus'' of any ontogenetic stage. The endocast was reconstructed in two sections, one on the portion of the braincase articulated with the left half of the skull and the remainder on the disarticulated portion of the braincase. Their relative position was then approximated based on cranial landmarks and comparison with other hadrosaurids. Because of weathering, many of the smaller neural canals and foramina could not be identified for certain.{{sfn|Farke et al.|2013}}\n\n===Cranial crest===\n[[File:Parasaurolophus Cranial Crest.svg|thumb|Diagram showing internal features of the crest]]\nMany hypotheses have been advanced as to what functions the cranial crest of ''Parasaurolophus'' performed, but most have been discredited.{{sfn|Glut|1997}}{{sfn|Norman|1985}} It is now believed that it may have had several functions: visual display for identifying species and sex, sound amplification for communication, and thermoregulation. It is not clear which was most significant at what times in the evolution of the crest and its internal nasal passages.{{sfn|Evans|2006}}\n\n====Differences in crests====\nAs for other lambeosaurines, it is believed that the cranial crest of ''Parasaurolophus'' changed with age and was a [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] characteristic in adults. [[James Hopson]], one of the first researchers to describe lambeosaurine crests in terms of such distinctions, suggested that ''P. cyrtocristatus'', with its small crest, was the female form of ''P. tubicen''.{{sfn|Hopson|1975}} Thomas Williamson suggested it was the [[juvenile (organism)|juvenile]] form. Neither hypothesis became widely accepted. As only six good skulls, one juvenile braincase,{{sfn|Williamson|2000}} and one recently discovered juvenile skull are known,{{sfn|Farke et al.|2013}} additional material will help clear up these potential relationships. Williamson noted that in any case, juvenile ''Parasaurolophus'' probably had small, rounded crests like ''P. cyrtocristatus'', that probably grew faster as individuals approached [[sexual maturity]].{{sfn|Williamson|2000}} Recent restudy of a juvenile braincase previously assigned to ''Lambeosaurus'', now assigned to ''Parasaurolophus'', provides evidence that a small tubular crest was present in juveniles. This specimen preserves a small upward flaring of the [[frontal bone]]s that was similar to but smaller than what is seen in adult specimens; in adults, the frontals formed a platform that supported the base of the crest. This specimen also indicates that the growth of the crest in ''Parasaurolophus'' and the facial profile of juvenile individuals differed from the ''Corythosaurus''-''Hypacrosaurus''-''Lambeosaurus'' model, in part because the crest of ''Parasaurolophus'' lacks the thin bony 'coxcomb' that makes up the upper portion of the crest of the other three lambeosaurines.{{sfn|Evans|Reisz|2007}}\n\n====Rejected function hypotheses====\nMany early suggestions focused on adaptations for an aquatic lifestyle, following the hypothesis that hadrosaurids were amphibious, a common line of thought until the 1960s. Thus, [[Alfred Sherwood Romer]] proposed it served as a [[Snorkel (swimming)|snorkel]],{{sfn|Romer|1933}} Martin Wilfarth that it was an attachment for a mobile [[proboscis]] used as a breathing tube or for food gathering,{{sfn|Wilfarth|1947}} [[Charles Mortram Sternberg|Charles M. Sternberg]] that it served as an airtrap to keep water out of the [[lung]]s,{{sfn|Sternberg|1935}} and [[Edwin Harris Colbert|Ned Colbert]] that it served as an air reservoir for prolonged stays underwater.{{sfn|Colbert|1945}}\n\nOther proposals were more physical in nature. As mentioned above, William Parks suggested that it was joined to the vertebrae with [[ligament]]s or muscles, and helped with moving and supporting the head.{{sfn|Parks|1922}} [[Othenio Abel]] proposed it was used as a weapon in combat among members of the same species,{{sfn|Abel|1924}} and Andrew Milner suggested that it could be used as a foliage deflector, like the helmet crest (called a 'casque') of the [[cassowary]].{{sfn|Norman|1985}} Still, other proposals made housing specialized organs the major function. [[Halszka Osm\u00f3lska]] suggested that it housed [[salt gland]]s,{{sfn|Maryanska|Osmolska|1979}} and John Ostrom suggested that it housed expanded areas for [[olfactory epithelium|olfactory tissue]] and much improved [[olfaction|sense of smell]] of the lambeosaurines, which had no obvious defensive capabilities.{{sfn|Ostrom|1962}}\n\nMost of these hypotheses have been discredited or rejected.{{sfn|Glut|1997}} For example, there is no hole at the end of the crest for a snorkeling function. There are no muscle scars for a proboscis and it is dubious that an animal with a beak would need one. As a proposed airlock, it would not have kept out water. The proposed air reservoir would have been insufficient for an animal the size of ''Parasaurolophus''. Other hadrosaurids had large heads without needing large hollow crests to serve as attachment points for supporting ligaments.{{sfn|Ostrom|1962}} Also, none of the proposals explain why the crest has such a shape, why other lambeosaurines should have crests that look much different but perform a similar function, how crestless or solid-crested hadrosaurids got along without such capabilities, or why some hadrosaurids had solid crests. These considerations particularly impact hypotheses based on increasing the capabilities of systems already present in the animal, such as the salt gland and olfaction hypotheses,{{sfn|Norman|1985}} and indicate that these were not primary functions of the crest. Additionally, work on the nasal cavity of lambeosaurines shows that [[olfactory nerve]]s and corresponding sensory tissue were largely outside the portion of the nasal passages in the crest, so the expansion of the crest had little to do with the sense of smell.{{sfn|Evans|2006}}\n\n====Temperature regulation hypothesis====\nThe large surface area and [[vascularization]] of the crest also suggests a thermoregulatory function.{{sfn|Sullivan|Williamson|1996}} The first to propose the cranial crests of lambeosaurines related to temperature regulation was Wheeler (1978). He proposed that there was a nerve connection between the crest and the [[brain]], so that the latter could be cooled by the former.{{sfn|Wheeler|1978}}{{sfn|Weishampel|1997}} The next people to publish a related idea were [[Teresa Marya\u0144ska]] and Osm\u00f3lska, who realized that like modern lizards, dinosaurs could have possessed salt glands, and cooled off by osmo-regulation.{{sfn|Weishampel|1997}}{{sfn|Maryanska|Osmolska|1979}} In 2006 Evans published an argument about the functions of lambeosaurine crests, and supported why this could be a causing factor for the evolution of the crest.{{sfn|Evans|2006}}\n\n====Behavioural hypotheses====\n[[File:Parasaurolophus with frill.jpg|thumb|Restoration of ''P. walkeri'' with hypothetical skin frill]]\n''Parasaurolophus'' is often hypothesized to have used its crest as a resonating chamber to produce low frequency sounds to alert other members of a group or its species.{{sfn|Weishampel|1981}} This function was originally suggested by Wiman in 1931 when he described ''P. tubicen''. He noted that the crests internal structures are similar to those of a swan and theorized that an animal could use its elongated nasal passages to create noise.{{sfn|Weishampel|1981}}{{sfn|Wiman|1931}} However, the nasal tubes of ''Hypacrosaurus'', ''Corythosaurus'', and ''Lambeosaurus'' are much more variable and complicated than the airway of ''Parasaurolophus''. A large amount of material and data supports the hypothesis that the large, tubular crest of ''Parasaurolophus'' was a resonating chamber. Weishampel in 1981 suggested that ''Parasaurolophus'' made noises ranging between the [[frequencies]] 55 and 720 [[Hertz|Hz]], although there was some difference in the range of individual species because of the crest size, shape, and nasal passage length, most obvious in ''P. cyrtocristatus'' (interpreted as a possible female).{{sfn|Weishampel|1981}} Hopson found that there is anatomical evidence that hadrosaurids had a strong hearing. There is at least one example, in the related ''Corythosaurus'', of a slender stapes (reptilian ear bone) in place, which combined with a large space for an eardrum implies a sensitive middle ear. Furthermore, the hadrosaurid lagena is elongate like a crocodilian's, indicating that the auditory portion of the inner ear was well-developed.{{sfn|Hopson|1975}} Based on the similarity of hadrosaurid [[inner ears]] to those of [[crocodiles]], he also proposed that adult hadrosaurids were sensitive to high frequencies, such as their offspring might produce. According to Weishampel, this is consistent with parents and offspring communicating.{{sfn|Weishampel|1981}}\n\nComputer modeling of a well-preserved specimen of ''P. tubicen'', with more complex air passages than those of ''P. walkeri'', has allowed the reconstruction of the possible sound its crest produced.{{sfn|Sandia|1997}} The main path resonates at around 30&nbsp;Hz, but the complicated sinus anatomy causes peaks and valleys in the sound.{{sfn|Diegert|Williamson|1998}}\nThe other main behavioral theory is that the crest was used for intra-species recognition.{{sfn|Weishampel|1997}} This means that the crest could have been used for species recognition, as a warning signal, and for other, non-sexual uses. These could have been some of the reasons crests evolved in ''Parasaurolophus'' and other hadrosaurids.{{sfn|Hone et al.|2011}} Instead, social and [[physiology of dinosaurs|physiological]] functions have become more supported as function(s) of the crest, focusing on [[visual perception|visual]] and [[hearing (sense)|auditory]] identification and communication. As a large object, the crest has clear value as a visual signal and sets this animal apart from its contemporaries. The large size of hadrosaurid [[orbit (anatomy)|eye sockets]] and the presence of [[sclerotic ring]]s in the eyes imply acute vision and [[Diurnality|diurnal]] habits, evidence that sight was important to these animals. If, as is commonly illustrated, a skin frill extended from the crest to the neck or back, the proposed visual display would have been even showier.{{sfn|Hopson|1975}} As is suggested by other lambeosaurine skulls, the crest of ''Parasaurolophus'' likely permitted both species identification (such as separating it from ''Corythosaurus'' or ''Lambeosaurus'') and sexual identification by shape and size.{{sfn|Evans|2006}}\n\n===Paleopathology===\n''Parasaurolophus walkeri'' is known from one specimen which might contain a [[pathology]]. The skeleton shows a v-shaped gap or notch in the vertebrae at the base of the neck.{{sfn|Benson et al.|2012}} Originally thought to be pathologic, Parks published a second interpretation of this, as a ligament attachment to support the head. The crest would attach to the gap via muscles or ligaments, and be used to support the head while bearing a frill, like predicted to exist in some hadrosaurids.{{sfn|Parks|1922}} One other possibility, is that during preparation, the specimen was damaged, creating the possible pathology.{{sfn|Benson et al.|2012}} The notch, however, is still considered more likely to be a pathology,{{sfn|Benson et al.|2012}}{{sfn|Glut|1997}} even though some illustrations of ''Parasaurolophus'' restore the skin flap.{{sfn|Sullivan|Williamson|1999}}\n\nAnother possible pathology was noticed by Parks, and from around the notch. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth vertebrae, directly anterior to the notch, the neural spines were damaged. The fourth had an obvious fracture, with the other two possessing a swelling at the base of the break.{{sfn|Parks|1922}}\n\n==Paleoecology==\n===Alberta===\n[[File:Map cretaceous Parasaurolophus.svg|thumb|Left|Locations of fossil finds, written in French.]]\n''Parasaurolophus walkeri'', from the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]], was a member of a diverse and well-documented [[fauna]] of prehistoric animals, including well-known dinosaurs such as the [[ceratopsidae|horned]] ''[[Centrosaurus]]'', ''[[Chasmosaurus]]'', and ''[[Styracosaurus]]''; fellow duckbills ''[[Gryposaurus]]'' and ''Corythosaurus''; [[tyrannosaurid]] ''[[Gorgosaurus]]''; and [[ankylosauridae|armored]] ''[[Edmontonia]]'', ''[[Euoplocephalus]]'' and ''[[Dyoplosaurus]]''.{{sfn|Weishampel et al.|2004}} It was a rare constituent of this fauna.{{sfn|Currie|Koppelhus|2005}} The Dinosaur Park Formation is interpreted as a low-relief setting of [[river]]s and [[floodplain]]s that became more [[swamp]]y and influenced by [[ocean|marine]] conditions over time as the [[Western Interior Seaway]] [[transgression (geology)|transgressed]] westward.{{sfn|Currie|Koppelhus|2005}} The [[climate]] was warmer than present-day Alberta, without [[frost]], but with wetter and drier seasons. [[Conifer]]s were apparently the dominant [[forest canopy|canopy]] plants, with an [[understory]] of [[fern]]s, [[tree fern]]s, and [[angiosperm]]s.{{sfn|Currie|Koppelhus|2005}}\n\nSome of the less common hadrosaurs in the Dinosaur Park Formation of Dinosaur Provincial Park, such as ''Parasaurolophus'', may represent the remains of individuals who died while migrating through the region. They might also have had a more upland habitat where they may have nested or fed. The presence of ''Parasaurolophus'' and ''Kritosaurus'' in northern latitude fossil sites may represent faunal exchange between otherwise distinct northern and southern biomes in Late Cretaceous North America. Both taxa are uncommon outside of the southern biome, where, along with ''[[Pentaceratops]]'', they are predominate members of the fauna.{{sfn|Tanke|Carpenter|2001}}\n\n===New Mexico===\n[[File:GorgosaurusDB.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Teratophoneus]]'' attacking a ''P. cyrtocristatus'']]\nIn the [[Fruitland Formation]] of New Mexico, ''P. cyrtocristatus'' shared its habitat with other ornithischians and theropods.

The climate was wet and humid, and supported an abundant and diverse range of organisms.{{sfn|Titus|Loewen|2013}} This formation contains one of the best and most continuous records of Late Cretaceous terrestrial life in the world.{{sfn|Clinton|1996}}\n\n''Parasaurolophus'' shared its [[natural environment|paleoenvironment]] with other dinosaurs, such as [[dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurid]] [[theropod]]s, the [[troodontidae|troodontid]] ''[[Talos sampsoni]]'', [[ornithomimids]] like ''[[Ornithomimus|Ornithomimus velox]]'', [[tyrannosaurids]] like ''[[Albertosaurus]]'' and ''[[Teratophoneus]]'', [[ankylosauria|armored ankylosaurids]], the [[hadrosaurid|duckbilled hadrosaur]] ''[[Gryposaurus|Gryposaurus monumentensis]]'', the [[ceratopsians]] ''[[Utahceratops|Utahceratops gettyi]]'', ''[[Nasutoceratops titusi]]'' and ''[[Kosmoceratops|Kosmoceratops richardsoni]]'' and the [[oviraptorosauria]]n ''[[Hagryphus|Hagryphus giganteus]]''.{{sfn|Zanno|Sampson|2005}} Paleofauna present in the Kaiparowits Formation included [[chondrichthyes|chondrichthyans]] (sharks and rays), [[frog]]s, [[salamander]]s, [[turtle]]s, [[lizard]]s and [[crocodilia]]ns.

It is one of the last known non-avian dinosaur genera, and became extinct in the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]] 66 million years ago. The name ''Triceratops'', which literally means \"three-horned face\", is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words \u03c4\u03c1\u03af- (''tri-'') meaning \"three\", [[wikt:\u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2|\u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2]] (''k\u00e9ras'') meaning \"horn\", and [[wikt:\u1f64\u03c8|\u1f64\u03c8]] (''\u014dps'') meaning \"face\".\n\n''Triceratops'' has been documented by numerous remains collected since the genus was first described in 1889 by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]]. Specimens representing life stages from hatchling to adult have been found. As the archetypal ceratopsid, ''Triceratops'' is one of the most popular dinosaurs, and has been featured in film, postal stamps, and many other types of media.\n\nBearing a large bony [[neck frill|frill]] and three [[horn (anatomy)|horns]] on the skull, and its large four-legged body possessing similarities with the modern [[rhinoceros]], ''Triceratops'' is one of the most recognizable of all dinosaurs and the best-known ceratopsid. It was also one of the largest, up to nine metres long and twelve tonnes in weight. It shared the landscape with and was probably [[predation|preyed upon]] by ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', though it is less certain that the two did battle in the fanciful manner often depicted in museum displays and popular images. The functions of the frills and three distinctive facial horns on its head have long inspired debate. Traditionally, these have been viewed as defensive weapons against predators. More recent interpretations find it probable that these features were primarily used in species identification, [[mating|courtship]] and dominance display, much like the [[antler]]s and horns of modern ungulates.\n\n''Triceratops'' was traditionally placed within the \"short-frilled\" ceratopsids but modern [[cladistic]] studies show it to be a member of the [[Chasmosaurinae]] which usually have long frills. Two [[species]], ''T. horridus'' and ''T. prorsus'', are considered valid today, from the seventeen species that have ever been named. Research published in 2010 concluded that the contemporaneous ''[[Torosaurus]]'', a ceratopsid long regarded as a separate genus, represents ''Triceratops'' in its mature form. This view was immediately disputed with examination of more fossil evidence needed to settle the debate.\n\n==Description==\n===Size===\n[[File:Triceratops Scale V1.svg|thumb|left|Size comparison with ''T. horridus'' in blue and ''T. prorsus'' in red]]\nIndividual ''Triceratops'' are estimated to have reached about {{Convert|7.9|to|9|m|lk=on}} in length, {{convert|2.9|to|3.0|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height,<ref name=\"dinodict\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dinodictionary.com/dinos_tpg2.asp|title=T Dinosaurs Page 2 |publisher=DinoDictionary.com |access-date=2010-08-03}}</ref><ref name=\"nhm\">{{cite web |url=http://internt.nhm.ac.uk/jdsml/nature-online/dino-directory/detail.dsml?Genus=Triceratops |title=Triceratops in The Natural History Museum's Dino Directory |publisher=Internt.nhm.ac.uk |access-date=2010-08-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217160801/http://internt.nhm.ac.uk/jdsml/nature-online/dino-directory//detail.dsml?Genus=Triceratops |archivedate=2009-02-17 }}</ref> and {{Convert|6.1|to|12.0|t|lb|lk=on}} in [[weight]].<ref name=\"Alexander\">{{Cite journal |last=Alexander |first=R.M. |year=1985 |title=Mechanics of posture and gait of some large dinosaurs |journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=83 |pages=1\u201325 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1985.tb00871.x}}</ref> The most distinctive feature is their large [[skull]], among the largest of all land animals.

The core of the top beak was formed by a special rostral bone.<ref name=\"Dino2\"/> Behind it, the [[premaxilla]]e bones were located, embayed from behind by very large circular nostrils. In chasmosaurines, the premaxillae met on their midline in a complex bone plate, the rear edge of which was reinforced by the \"narial strut\". From the base of this strut, a triangular process jutted out into the nostril. ''Triceratops'' differs from most relatives in that this process was hollowed out on the outer side.<ref name=\"Dino2\"/> Behind the toothless premaxilla, the [[maxilla]] bore thirty-six to forty tooth positions, in which three to five teeth per position were vertically stacked. The teeth were closely appressed, forming a \"dental battery\" curving to the inside. The skull bore a single horn on the snout, above the nostrils.

The front neck vertebrae were fused into a syncervical. Traditionally, this was assumed to have incorporated the first three vertebrae which would imply that the frontmost [[atlas (anatomy)|atlas]] was very large and sported a neural spine. Later interpretations revived an old hypothesis by [[John Bell Hatcher]] that at the very front a vestige of the real atlas can be observed, the syncervical then consisting of four vertebrae. The vertebral count mentioned, is adjusted to this view. In ''Triceratops'' the neural spines of the neck are constant in height, instead of gradually sloping upwards. Another peculiarity is that the neck ribs only begin to lengthen with the ninth cervical vertebra.<ref name=\"Dino2\"/>\n\nThe rather short and high vertebrae of the back were in its middle region reinforced by ossified tendons running along the tops of the [[neural arch]]es. The straight sacrum was long and adult individuals show a fusion of all sacral vertebrae. In ''Triceratops'' the first four and last two sacrals had transverse processes, connecting the vertebral column to the pelvis, that were fused at their distal ends. Sacrals seven and eight had longer processes, causing the sacrum to have an oval profile in top view. On top of the sacrum a neural plate was present formed by a fusion of the neural spines of the second through fifth vertebrae. ''Triceratops'' had a large pelvis with a long [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]]. The [[ischium]] was curved downwards. The foot was short with four functional toes. The phalangeal formula of the foot is 2-3-4-5-0.<ref name=\"Dino2\"/>\n[[File:Triceratops pelvis NHM.JPG|thumb|right|Closeup of pelvis of ''Triceratops'' specimen at the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]]]]\nAlthough certainly [[quadruped]]al, the posture of horned dinosaurs has long been the subject of some debate.

The first species had been named ''Triceratops horridus'' by Marsh. Its [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] was derived from the [[Latin]] ''horridus''; \"rough, rugose\", perhaps suggesting the roughened texture of those bones belonging to the type specimen, later identified as an aged individual. The additional skulls varied to a lesser or greater degree from the original ''Triceratops'' specimen. This variation is unsurprising, given that ''Triceratops'' skulls are large three-dimensional objects, coming from individuals of different ages and both sexes, and which were subjected to different amounts and directions of pressure during fossilization.<ref name=\"Dodhorned\"/>\n\nHowever, not a single one of these skulls was referred to ''T. horridus'' by Marsh who instead named eight further species and eventually even a new genus ''Sterrholophus''. In 1889, he named two species. ''Triceratops flabellatus'', the \"fan-shaped\", was based on skull YPM 1821. ''Triceratops galeus'', \"the helmeted one\", was exceptionally based on a specimen not found by Hatcher, USNM 2410, a horn and frill excavated by George Homans Eldridge in Colorado in the [[Laramie Formation]]. In December 1889, Marsh published the first illustration ever of a ''Triceratops'' skull, that of ''T. flabellatus''. In January 1890, two additional species were added. ''Triceratops serratus'', \"the serrated one\", was based on skull YPM 1823, and ''Triceratops prorsus'', \"pointing forward\", on specimen YPM 1822, a nose horn. In May 1890, ''Triceratops sulcatus'' was added, named \"the one with troughs\" because of grooves on the horns, based on the fragmentary skull USNM 4276. On this occasion, Marsh reported a natural brain cast, that he considered remarkably small. In February 1891, Marsh published additional images, for the first time concluding that the animal walked on all fours: initially he had assumed it was a bipedal form, brought to the brink of extinction by its overly heavy skull. A full skeletal restoration followed in April, together with one of ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' in the same publication, the first for Mesozoic dinosaurs ever drawn. The same year he renamed ''T. flabellatus'' into the separate genus ''Sterrholophus'', the \"stiffly crested\". In September, he named ''Triceratops elatus'', \"the raised one\", based on specimen YPM 1201, an enormous skull with an upwards pointing low nose horn found on 23 October 1890 by Hatcher. Marsh named his last ''Triceratops'' species in 1898, when part of his collection was transferred from Yale to the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. ''Triceratops calicornis'', \"the chalice horned\", was based on specimen USNM 4928, a skull with a strange depression on the rear of the horn base. ''Triceratops obtusus'', the \"stumpy one\", was based on specimen USNM 4720 with an obtuse nose horn.\n\nAfter Marsh's death, Hatcher attempted to revise the material but fell ill writing the study, never to recover. [[Richard Swann Lull]] completed his monograph. Lull and subsequent researchers would disagree as to the number of separate species (listed below), and came up with several [[phylogenetic]] schemes for how they were related to each other.\n\nIn the first attempt to understand the many species, Lull found two groups, although he did not say how he distinguished them: one composed of ''T. horridus'', ''T. prorsus'', and ''T. brevicornus''; the other of ''T. elatus'' and ''T. calicornis''. Two species (''T. serratus'' and ''T. flabellatus'') stood apart from these groups.<ref name=\"HML07\"/> By 1933, and his revision of the landmark 1907 Hatcher-Marsh-Lull [[monograph]] of all known ceratopsians, he retained his two groups and two unaffiliated species, with a third lineage of ''T. obtusus'' and ''T. hatcheri'' that was characterized by a very small nasal horn.<ref name=\"RSL33\"/> ''T. horridus''-''T. prorsus''-''T. brevicornus'' was now thought to be the most conservative lineage, with an increase in skull size and a decrease in nasal horn size, and ''T. elatus''-''T. calicornis'' was defined by large brow horns and small nasal horn.<ref name=\"RSL33\"/><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Goussard |first=Florent |year=2006 |title=The skull of Triceratops in the palaeontology gallery, Mus\u00e9um national d'Histoire naturelle, Paris |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242181069 |journal=Geodiversitas |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=467\u2013476 |via=ResearchGate}}</ref> C.

C. Marsh]], based on the holotype skull YPM 1822 and referred elements]]\nWith time, the idea that the differing skulls might be representative of individual variation within one (or two) species gained popularity. In 1986, [[John Ostrom]] and [[Peter Wellnhofer]] published a paper in which they proposed that there was only one species, ''Triceratops horridus''.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ostrom |first=J. H. |last2=Wellnhofer |first2=P. |year=1986 |title=The Munich specimen of ''Triceratops'' with a revision of the genus |journal=Zitteliana |volume=14 |pages=111\u2013158}}</ref> Part of their rationale was that generally there are only one or two species of any large animal in a region. To their findings, Lehman added the old Lull-Sternberg lineages combined with maturity and [[sexual dimorphism]], suggesting that the ''T. horridus''-''T. prorsus''-''T. brevicornus'' lineage was composed of females, the ''T. calicornis''-''T. elatus'' lineage was made up of males, and the ''T. obtusus''-''T. hatcheri'' lineage was of [[pathologic]] old males.<ref name=\"TML90\"/> His reasoning was that males had taller, more erect horns and larger skulls, and females had smaller skulls with shorter, forward-facing horns.\n\nThese findings were contested a few years later by Catherine Forster, who reanalyzed ''Triceratops'' material more comprehensively and concluded that the remains fell into two species, ''T. horridus'' and ''T. prorsus'', although the distinctive skull of ''T.'' (\"''Nedoceratops''\") ''hatcheri'' differed enough to warrant a separate genus.<ref name=\"Forster1996\">{{Cite journal |last=Forster |first=C.A. |year=1996 |title=Species resolution in ''Triceratops'': cladistic and morphometric approaches |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=259\u2013270 |doi=10.1080/02724634.1996.10011313}}</ref> She found that ''T. horridus'' and several other species belonged together, and ''T. prorsus'' and ''T. brevicornus'' stood alone, and since there were many more specimens in the first group, she suggested that this meant the two groups were two species.

Jack Horner, Scannella's mentor at Bozeman Campus, [[Montana State University]], noted that ceratopsian skulls consist of metaplastic bone. A characteristic of metaplastic bone is that it lengthens and shortens over time, extending and resorbing to form new shapes. Significant variety is seen even in those skulls already identified as ''Triceratops'', Horner said, \"where the horn orientation is backwards in juveniles and forward in adults\". Approximately 50% of all subadult ''Triceratops'' skulls have two thin areas in the frill that correspond with the placement of \"holes\" in ''Torosaurus'' skulls, suggesting that holes developed to offset the weight that would otherwise have been added as maturing ''Triceratops'' individuals grew longer frills.<ref name=\"growth09\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091031002314.htm|title=New Analyses Of Dinosaur Growth May Wipe Out One-third Of Species|date=2009-10-31|work=Science News|publisher=ScienceDaily.com|access-date=2009-11-03}}</ref> A paper describing these findings in detail was published in July 2010 by Scannella and Horner.

Such changes would include the growth of additional [[epoccipital]]s, reversion of bone texture from an adult to immature type and back to adult again, and growth of frill holes at a later stage than usual.<ref name=\"AF2011\"/> A study by Nicholas Longrich and Daniel Field analyzed 35 specimens of both ''Triceratops'' and ''Torosaurus''. The authors concluded that ''Triceratops'' individuals too old to be considered immature forms are represented in the fossil record, as are ''Torosaurus'' individuals too young to be considered fully mature adults. The synonymy of ''Triceratops'' and ''Torosaurus'' cannot be supported, they said, without more convincing intermediate forms than Scannella and Horner initially produced. Scannella's ''Triceratops'' specimen with a hole on its frill, they argued, could represent a diseased or malformed individual rather than a transitional stage between an immature ''Triceratops'' and mature ''Torosaurus'' form.<ref name=\"longrichfieldstudy\">{{Cite journal |last=Longrich |first=Nicholas R. |last2=Field |first2=Daniel J. |date=2012-02-29 |title=Torosaurus Is Not Triceratops: Ontogeny in Chasmosaurine Ceratopsids as a Case Study in Dinosaur Taxonomy |journal=PLOS One |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=e32623 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0032623 |pmid=22393425 |pmc=3290593 |issn=1932-6203|bibcode=2012PLoSO...732623L }}</ref><ref name=\"bbcTriNotToro\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17192624 |title=Triceratops and Torosaurus dinosaurs 'two species, not one' |last=Bowdler |first=Neil |date=2012-03-01 |work=BBC News |access-date=July 29, 2013 |language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n====Other genera as growth stages of ''Triceratops''====\n{{Main|Nedoceratops}}\n[[File:Nedoceratops skull, PLoS ONE.png|thumb|Comparisons between the skulls of ''Triceratops'' and ''[[Nedoceratops]]'']]\nOpinion has varied on the validity of a separate genus for ''[[Nedoceratops]]''.

It is one of the last known non-avian dinosaur genera, and became extinct in the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]] 66 million years ago. The name ''Triceratops'', which literally means \"three-horned face\", is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words \u03c4\u03c1\u03af- (''tri-'') meaning \"three\", [[wikt:\u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2|\u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2]] (''k\u00e9ras'') meaning \"horn\", and [[wikt:\u1f64\u03c8|\u1f64\u03c8]] (''\u014dps'') meaning \"face\".\n\n''Triceratops'' has been documented by numerous remains collected since the genus was first described in 1889 by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]]. Specimens representing life stages from hatchling to adult have been found. As the archetypal ceratopsid, ''Triceratops'' is one of the most popular dinosaurs, and has been featured in film, postal stamps, and many other types of media.\n\nBearing a large bony [[neck frill|frill]] and three [[horn (anatomy)|horns]] on the skull, and its large four-legged body possessing similarities with the modern [[rhinoceros]], ''Triceratops'' is one of the most recognizable of all dinosaurs and the best-known ceratopsid. It was also one of the largest, up to nine metres long and twelve tonnes in weight. It shared the landscape with and was probably [[predation|preyed upon]] by ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', though it is less certain that the two did battle in the fanciful manner often depicted in museum displays and popular images. The functions of the frills and three distinctive facial horns on its head have long inspired debate. Traditionally, these have been viewed as defensive weapons against predators. More recent interpretations find it probable that these features were primarily used in species identification, [[mating|courtship]] and dominance display, much like the [[antler]]s and horns of modern ungulates.\n\n''Triceratops'' was traditionally placed within the \"short-frilled\" ceratopsids but modern [[cladistic]] studies show it to be a member of the [[Chasmosaurinae]] which usually have long frills. Two [[species]], ''T. horridus'' and ''T. prorsus'', are considered valid today, from the seventeen species that have ever been named. Research published in 2010 concluded that the contemporaneous ''[[Torosaurus]]'', a ceratopsid long regarded as a separate genus, represents ''Triceratops'' in its mature form.

Later interpretations revived an old hypothesis by [[John Bell Hatcher]] that at the very front a vestige of the real atlas can be observed, the syncervical then consisting of four vertebrae. The vertebral count mentioned, is adjusted to this view. In ''Triceratops'' the neural spines of the neck are constant in height, instead of gradually sloping upwards. Another peculiarity is that the neck ribs only begin to lengthen with the ninth cervical vertebra.<ref name=\"Dino2\"/>\n\nThe rather short and high vertebrae of the back were in its middle region reinforced by ossified tendons running along the tops of the [[neural arch]]es.

Sacrals seven and eight had longer processes, causing the sacrum to have an oval profile in top view. On top of the sacrum a neural plate was present formed by a fusion of the neural spines of the second through fifth vertebrae. ''Triceratops'' had a large pelvis with a long [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]].

The first species had been named ''Triceratops horridus'' by Marsh. Its [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] was derived from the [[Latin]] ''horridus''; \"rough, rugose\", perhaps suggesting the roughened texture of those bones belonging to the type specimen, later identified as an aged individual. The additional skulls varied to a lesser or greater degree from the original ''Triceratops'' specimen. This variation is unsurprising, given that ''Triceratops'' skulls are large three-dimensional objects, coming from individuals of different ages and both sexes, and which were subjected to different amounts and directions of pressure during fossilization.<ref name=\"Dodhorned\"/>\n\nHowever, not a single one of these skulls was referred to ''T. horridus'' by Marsh who instead named eight further species and eventually even a new genus ''Sterrholophus''. In 1889, he named two species. ''Triceratops flabellatus'', the \"fan-shaped\", was based on skull YPM 1821. ''Triceratops galeus'', \"the helmeted one\", was exceptionally based on a specimen not found by Hatcher, USNM 2410, a horn and frill excavated by George Homans Eldridge in Colorado in the [[Laramie Formation]]. In December 1889, Marsh published the first illustration ever of a ''Triceratops'' skull, that of ''T. flabellatus''. In January 1890, two additional species were added. ''Triceratops serratus'', \"the serrated one\", was based on skull YPM 1823, and ''Triceratops prorsus'', \"pointing forward\", on specimen YPM 1822, a nose horn. In May 1890, ''Triceratops sulcatus'' was added, named \"the one with troughs\" because of grooves on the horns, based on the fragmentary skull USNM 4276. On this occasion, Marsh reported a natural brain cast, that he considered remarkably small. In February 1891, Marsh published additional images, for the first time concluding that the animal walked on all fours: initially he had assumed it was a bipedal form, brought to the brink of extinction by its overly heavy skull. A full skeletal restoration followed in April, together with one of ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' in the same publication, the first for Mesozoic dinosaurs ever drawn. The same year he renamed ''T. flabellatus'' into the separate genus ''Sterrholophus'', the \"stiffly crested\". In September, he named ''Triceratops elatus'', \"the raised one\", based on specimen YPM 1201, an enormous skull with an upwards pointing low nose horn found on 23 October 1890 by Hatcher. Marsh named his last ''Triceratops'' species in 1898, when part of his collection was transferred from Yale to the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. ''Triceratops calicornis'', \"the chalice horned\", was based on specimen USNM 4928, a skull with a strange depression on the rear of the horn base. ''Triceratops obtusus'', the \"stumpy one\", was based on specimen USNM 4720 with an obtuse nose horn.\n\nAfter Marsh's death, Hatcher attempted to revise the material but fell ill writing the study, never to recover. [[Richard Swann Lull]] completed his monograph. Lull and subsequent researchers would disagree as to the number of separate species (listed below), and came up with several [[phylogenetic]] schemes for how they were related to each other.\n\nIn the first attempt to understand the many species, Lull found two groups, although he did not say how he distinguished them: one composed of ''T. horridus'', ''T. prorsus'', and ''T. brevicornus''; the other of ''T. elatus'' and ''T. calicornis''. Two species (''T. serratus'' and ''T. flabellatus'') stood apart from these groups.<ref name=\"HML07\"/> By 1933, and his revision of the landmark 1907 Hatcher-Marsh-Lull [[monograph]] of all known ceratopsians, he retained his two groups and two unaffiliated species, with a third lineage of ''T. obtusus'' and ''T. hatcheri'' that was characterized by a very small nasal horn.<ref name=\"RSL33\"/> ''T. horridus''-''T. prorsus''-''T. brevicornus'' was now thought to be the most conservative lineage, with an increase in skull size and a decrease in nasal horn size, and ''T. elatus''-''T. calicornis'' was defined by large brow horns and small nasal horn.<ref name=\"RSL33\"/><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Goussard |first=Florent |year=2006 |title=The skull of Triceratops in the palaeontology gallery, Mus\u00e9um national d'Histoire naturelle, Paris |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242181069 |journal=Geodiversitas |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=467\u2013476 |via=ResearchGate}}</ref> C.

C. Marsh]], based on the holotype skull YPM 1822 and referred elements]]\nWith time, the idea that the differing skulls might be representative of individual variation within one (or two) species gained popularity. In 1986, [[John Ostrom]] and [[Peter Wellnhofer]] published a paper in which they proposed that there was only one species, ''Triceratops horridus''.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ostrom |first=J. H. |last2=Wellnhofer |first2=P. |year=1986 |title=The Munich specimen of ''Triceratops'' with a revision of the genus |journal=Zitteliana |volume=14 |pages=111\u2013158}}</ref> Part of their rationale was that generally there are only one or two species of any large animal in a region. To their findings, Lehman added the old Lull-Sternberg lineages combined with maturity and [[sexual dimorphism]], suggesting that the ''T. horridus''-''T. prorsus''-''T. brevicornus'' lineage was composed of females, the ''T. calicornis''-''T. elatus'' lineage was made up of males, and the ''T. obtusus''-''T. hatcheri'' lineage was of [[pathologic]] old males.<ref name=\"TML90\"/> His reasoning was that males had taller, more erect horns and larger skulls, and females had smaller skulls with shorter, forward-facing horns.\n\nThese findings were contested a few years later by Catherine Forster, who reanalyzed ''Triceratops'' material more comprehensively and concluded that the remains fell into two species, ''T. horridus'' and ''T. prorsus'', although the distinctive skull of ''T.''

Jack Horner, Scannella's mentor at Bozeman Campus, [[Montana State University]], noted that ceratopsian skulls consist of metaplastic bone. A characteristic of metaplastic bone is that it lengthens and shortens over time, extending and resorbing to form new shapes. Significant variety is seen even in those skulls already identified as ''Triceratops'', Horner said, \"where the horn orientation is backwards in juveniles and forward in adults\". Approximately 50% of all subadult ''Triceratops'' skulls have two thin areas in the frill that correspond with the placement of \"holes\" in ''Torosaurus'' skulls, suggesting that holes developed to offset the weight that would otherwise have been added as maturing ''Triceratops'' individuals grew longer frills.<ref name=\"growth09\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091031002314.htm|title=New Analyses Of Dinosaur Growth May Wipe Out One-third Of Species|date=2009-10-31|work=Science News|publisher=ScienceDaily.com|access-date=2009-11-03}}</ref> A paper describing these findings in detail was published in July 2010 by Scannella and Horner. It formally argues that ''Torosaurus'' and the similar contemporary ''[[Nedoceratops]]'' are synonymous with ''Triceratops''.<ref name=\"ScanHorn2010\"/>\n\nThe assertion ignited debate. Andrew Farke had in 2006 stressed that, apart from the frill, no systematic differences could be found between ''Torosaurus'' and ''Triceratops''.<ref name=\"Farke-2006\"/> He nevertheless disputed Scannella's conclusion by arguing in 2011 that the proposed morphological changes required to \"age\" a ''Triceratops'' into a ''Torosaurus'' would be without precedent among ceratopsids. Such changes would include the growth of additional [[epoccipital]]s, reversion of bone texture from an adult to immature type and back to adult again, and growth of frill holes at a later stage than usual.<ref name=\"AF2011\"/> A study by Nicholas Longrich and Daniel Field analyzed 35 specimens of both ''Triceratops'' and ''Torosaurus''. The authors concluded that ''Triceratops'' individuals too old to be considered immature forms are represented in the fossil record, as are ''Torosaurus'' individuals too young to be considered fully mature adults. The synonymy of ''Triceratops'' and ''Torosaurus'' cannot be supported, they said, without more convincing intermediate forms than Scannella and Horner initially produced. Scannella's ''Triceratops'' specimen with a hole on its frill, they argued, could represent a diseased or malformed individual rather than a transitional stage between an immature ''Triceratops'' and mature ''Torosaurus'' form.<ref name=\"longrichfieldstudy\">{{Cite journal |last=Longrich |first=Nicholas R. |last2=Field |first2=Daniel J. |date=2012-02-29 |title=Torosaurus Is Not Triceratops: Ontogeny in Chasmosaurine Ceratopsids as a Case Study in Dinosaur Taxonomy |journal=PLOS One |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=e32623 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0032623 |pmid=22393425 |pmc=3290593 |issn=1932-6203|bibcode=2012PLoSO...732623L }}</ref><ref name=\"bbcTriNotToro\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17192624 |title=Triceratops and Torosaurus dinosaurs 'two species, not one' |last=Bowdler |first=Neil |date=2012-03-01 |work=BBC News |access-date=July 29, 2013 |language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n====Other genera as growth stages of ''Triceratops''====\n{{Main|Nedoceratops}}\n[[File:Nedoceratops skull, PLoS ONE.png|thumb|Comparisons between the skulls of ''Triceratops'' and ''[[Nedoceratops]]'']]\nOpinion has varied on the validity of a separate genus for ''[[Nedoceratops]]''.

The player achieves this through controlled wrist movements of the bowing hand, often masked or enhanced with                                                                                                                                                  [[vibrato]]. Such a legato style of playing can also be associated with [[portamento]].\n\n==Guitar==\nIn [[guitar|guitar playing]] (apart from classical guitar) legato is used interchangeably as a label for both musical articulation and a particular application of technique\u2014playing musical phrases using the left hand to play the notes\u2014using techniques such as [[glissando]], [[Finger vibrato|string bending]], [[hammer-on]]s and [[pull-off]]s instead of picking to sound the notes.  The fact that the same finger is both setting the string vibrating and setting the pitch leads to smoother transitions between notes than when one hand is used to mark pitch while the other strikes the string. Legato ''technique'' to provide legato ''articulation'' on electric guitar generally requires playing notes that are close and on the same string, following the first note with others that are played by hammer-ons and pull-offs. \n\nSome guitar virtuosos (notably [[Allan Holdsworth]], [[Shawn Lane]] and [[Brett Garsed]]) developed their legato technique to the extent that they could perform extremely complex passages involving any permutation of notes on a string at extreme tempos, and particularly in the case of Holdsworth, tend to eschew pull-offs entirely for what some feel is a detrimental effect on guitar tone as the string is pulled slightly sideways. The term \"hammer-ons from nowhere\"{{Reference needed|date=October 2012}} is commonly employed when crossing strings and relying solely on fretting hand strength to produce a note but on a plucked string. Many guitar virtuosos are well-versed in the legato technique, as it allows for rapid and \"clean\" runs.  Multiple hammer-ons and pull-offs together are sometimes also referred to colloquially as \"rolls,\" a reference to the fluid sound of the technique. A rapid series of hammer-ons and pull-offs between a single pair of notes is called a [[trill (music)|trill]]. \n\nLegato on guitar is commonly associated with playing more notes within a beat than the stated timing, i.e., playing 5 (a [[tuplet|quintuplet]]) or 7 (a septuplet) notes against a quarter-note instead of the usual even number or triplet. This gives the passage an unusual timing and when played slowly an unusual sound. However, this is less noticeable by ear when played fast, as legato usually is. There is a fine line between legato and two-hand [[Tapping|finger tapping]], in some cases making the two techniques harder to distinguish by ear.  Generally, legato adds a more fluid, smooth sound to a passage.\n\n==Synthesizers==\nIn [[synthesizer]]s legato is a type of [[monophonic (synthesizers)|monophonic]] operation. In contrast to the typical monophonic mode where every new note rearticulates the sound by restarting the [[ADSR envelope|envelope generator]]s, in legato mode the envelopes are not re-triggered if the new note is played \"legato\" (with the previous note still depressed). This causes the initial [[Transient (acoustics)|transient]] from the attack and decay phases to sound only once for an entire legato sequence of notes. Envelopes reaching the sustain stage remain there until the final note is released.\n\n== Vocal music ==\n{{see also|Melisma}}\nIn Classical [[singing]], legato means a string of sustained vowels with minimal interruption from consonants. It is a key characteristic of the [[bel canto]] singing style that prevailed among voice teachers and singers during the 18th century and the first four decades of the 19th century.  Usually referred to as ''the line'', a good, smooth legato is still necessary for successful classical singers. In Western Classical vocal music, singers generally use it on any phrase without explicit articulation marks. Usually the most prevalent issue with vocal legato is maintaining the \"line\" across registers.\n\n==Audio examples==\n{{listen |\n  | filename = Bassoon-technical-articulations.ogg\n  | title = Bassoon articulations\n  | description = A [[bassoon]] played [[staccato]], '''legato''', legato + [[vibrato]], and [[slur (music)|slurred]].\n|}}{{Clear}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Slur (music)]]\n*[[Staccato]]\n*[[Portato]]\n\n==References==\n{{More citations needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |title=Elementary Rudiments of Music |first=Barbara |last=Wharram |edition=Revised |editor-first=Kathleen |editor-last=Wood |location=Mississauga |publisher=Frederick Harris Music |year=2005 |isbn=1-55440-011-2 }}\n\n{{Shred Guitar}}\n{{Musical notation}}\n{{opera terms}}\n\n[[Category:Articulations]]\n[[Category:Italian opera terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|legato in music}}{{Image frame|content=<score> {\n\\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f    \\relative c'' {\n        a4( b c d e f g a)\n    }\n\n}\n</score>|width=220|caption=A [[slur (music)|slurred]] A-minor natural scale.

Fossils of this genus date to the [[Late Jurassic]] [[Period (geology)|period]], where they are found in [[Kimmeridgian]] to early [[Tithonian]] aged [[stratum|strata]], between 155 and 150&nbsp;[[Mya (unit)|million years ago]] and the real one was founded at [[Safari]] in [[Africa]], in the western [[United States]] and [[Portugal]]. Of the species that have been classified in the upper [[Morrison Formation]] of the western US, only three are universally recognized; '''''S. stenops''''', '''''S. ungulatus''''' and '''''S. sulcatus'''''. The remains of over 80 individual animals of this genus have been found. ''Stegosaurus'' would have lived alongside dinosaurs such as ''[[Apatosaurus]]'', ''[[Diplodocus]]'', ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'', ''[[Allosaurus]]'', and ''[[Ceratosaurus]]''; the latter two may have preyed on it.\n\nThese were large, heavily built, [[herbivore|herbivorous]] [[quadruped]]s with rounded backs, short fore limbs, long hind limbs, and tails held high in the air. Due to their distinctive combination of broad, upright plates and tail tipped with [[Thagomizer|spikes]], ''Stegosaurus'' is one of the most recognizable kinds of dinosaurs. The function of this array of plates and spikes has been the subject of much speculation among scientists. Today, it is generally agreed that their spiked tails were most likely used for defense against predators, while their plates may have been used primarily for display, and secondarily for [[thermoregulation|thermoregulatory]] functions. ''Stegosaurus'' had a relatively low [[brain-to-body mass ratio]]. It had a short neck and a small head, meaning it most likely ate low-lying bushes and shrubs. One species, ''Stegosaurus ungulatus'', is the largest known of all the stegosaurians (bigger than related dinosaurs such as ''[[Kentrosaurus]]'' and ''[[Huayangosaurus]]'').\n\n''Stegosaurus'' remains were first identified during the \"[[Bone Wars]]\" by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] at [[Dinosaur Ridge]] National Landmark.  The first known skeletons were fragmentary and the bones were scattered, and it would be many years before the true appearance of these animals, including their posture and plate arrangement, became well understood. Despite its popularity in books and film, mounted skeletons of ''Stegosaurus'' did not become a staple of major natural history museums until the mid-20th century, and many museums have had to assemble composite displays from several different specimens due to a lack of complete skeletons. ''Stegosaurus'' is one of the better-known dinosaurs, and has been featured in film, postal stamps, and many other types of media.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Stegosaurus size comparison.svg|thumb|left|201px|Size of ''S.&nbsp;ungulatus'' (orange) and ''S. stenops'' (green) compared to a human]]\nThe quadrupedal ''Stegosaurus'' is one of the most easily identifiable dinosaur genera, due to the distinctive double row of kite-shaped plates rising vertically along the rounded back and the two pairs of long spikes extending horizontally near the end of the tail.

One subadult specimen, discovered in 1994 in Wyoming, is {{convert|4.6|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, and is estimated to have weighed 2.4&nbsp;metric tons (2.6&nbsp;short tons) while alive.

It had a small [[antorbital fenestra]], the hole between the nose and eye common to most [[archosaur]]s, including modern birds, though lost in extant crocodylians. The skull's low position suggests that ''Stegosaurus'' may have been a browser of low-growing vegetation.

The lower jaw had flat downward and upward extensions that would have completely hidden the teeth when viewed from the side, and these probably supported a turtle-like beak in life.

The presacrals are divided into cervical (neck) and dorsal (back) vertebrae, with around 10 cervicals and 17 dorsals, the total number being one greater than in ''[[Hesperosaurus]]'', two greater than ''[[Huayangosaurus]]'', although ''[[Miragaia]]'' preserves 17 cervicals and an unknown number of dorsals. The first cervical vertebra is the [[axis bone]], which is connected and often fused to the [[atlas bone]]. Farther posteriorly, the proportionately larger the cervicals become, although they do not change greatly in anything other than size. Past the first few dorsals, the [[vertebral centrum|centrum]] of the bones become more elongate front-to-back, and the [[wikt:transverse|transverse]] processes become more elevated [[dorsa]]l. The sacrum of ''S. stenops'' includes four sacral vertebrae, but one of the dorsals is also incorporated into the structure. In some specimens of ''S. stenops'', a caudal is also incorporated, as a caudosacral. In ''[[Hesperosaurus]]'' there are two dorsosacrals, and only four fused sacrals, but in ''[[Kentrosaurus]]'' there may be as many as seven vertebrae in the sacrum, with both dorsosacrals and caudosacrals. ''S. stenops'' preserves 46 caudal vertebrae, and up to 49, and along the series both the centrums and the [[neural spines]] become smaller, until the neural spines disappear at caudal 35.

Lucas reclassified this species in the new genus ''[[Hoplitosaurus]]'' later that year. Lucas also re-examined the issue of the life appearance of ''Stegosaurus'', coming to the conclusion that the plates were arranged in pairs in two rows along the back, arranged above the bases of the ribs. Lucas commissioned [[Charles R. Knight]] to produce a life restoration of ''S. ungulatus'' based on his new interpretation. However, the following year, Lucas wrote that he now believed the plates were probably attached in staggered rows.<ref name=\"gilmore14\"/> In 1910, [[Richard Swann Lull]] wrote that the alternating pattern seen in ''S. stenops'' was probably due to shifting of the skeleton after death. He led the construction of the first ever ''Stegosaurus'' skeletal mount at the [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]], which was depicted with paired plates.<ref name=\"gilmore14\"/> In 1914, Charles Gilmore argued against Lull's interpretation, noting that several specimens of ''S. stenops'', including the now-completely prepared holotype, preserved the plates in alternating rows near the peak of the back, and that there was no evidence of the plates having shifted relative to the body during fossilization.<ref name=\"gilmore14\"/> Gilmore and Lucas' interpretation became the generally accepted standard, and Lull's mount at the Peabody Museum was changed to reflect this in 1924.<ref name=revan2011/>\n\nSophie the ''Stegosaurus'' is the most nearly complete [[fossil]] [[Zoological specimen|specimen]] of a ''Stegosaurus''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ghosh |first=Pallab |date=3 December 2014 |title=Scientists seek to solve mystery of Stegosaurus plates |work=BBC News |quote=Sophie is 80% complete and is thought to be the most complete specimen in the world. |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-30301895}}</ref> It is a young adult of undetermined sex, {{convert|5.6|m|ft}} long and {{convert|2.9|m|ft}} tall.

As further and complete plates were found, their form showed they stood on edge, rather than lying flat.\n* By 1891, Marsh published a more familiar view of ''Stegosaurus'',<ref name=\"Marsh1891\" /> with a single row of plates. This was dropped fairly early on (apparently because it was poorly understood how the plates were embedded in the skin and they were thought to overlap too much in this arrangement).

This has led to the influential idea that dinosaurs like ''Stegosaurus'' had a \"second brain\" in the tail, which may have been responsible for controlling reflexes in the rear portion of the body. This \"brain\" was proposed to have given a ''Stegosaurus'' a temporary boost when it was under threat from predators.<ref name=\"FasWeis04\" />\n\nThis space, however, is more likely to have served other purposes. The sacro-lumbar expansion is not unique to stegosaurs, nor even sauropods. It is also present in birds. In their case, it contains what is called the [[glycogen body]], a structure whose function is not definitely known, but which is postulated to facilitate the supply of [[glycogen]] to the animal's [[nervous system]].<ref name=\"Giffin90\">{{cite journal|author=Buchholz (n\u00e9e Giffin) EB|year=1990|title=Gross Spinal Anatomy and Limb Use in Living and Fossil Reptiles|journal=Paleobiology|volume=16|issue=4|pages=448\u201358|doi=10.1017/S0094837300010186}}</ref> It also may function as a balance organ, or reservoir of compounds to support the nervous system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://svpow.com/2009/12/15/lies-damned-lies-and-clash-of-the-dinosaurs/|title=Lies, damned lies, and Clash of the Dinosaurs|date=December 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== Growth ===\nJuveniles of ''Stegosaurus'' have been preserved, probably showing the growth of the genus.

However, their teeth and jaws are very different from those of other herbivorous [[ornithischian]] dinosaurs, suggesting a different feeding strategy that is not yet well understood. The other ornithischians possessed teeth capable of grinding plant material and a jaw structure capable of movements in planes other than simply orthal (i.e. not only the fused up-down motion to which stegosaur jaws were likely limited). Unlike the sturdy jaws and grinding teeth common to its fellow ornithischians, ''Stegosaurus'' (and all stegosaurians) had small, peg-shaped teeth that have been observed with horizontal wear facets associated with tooth-food contact<ref>{{cite book|title=The Armored Dinosaurs|year=2001|chapter=Tooth wear and possible jaw action of ''Scelidosaurus harrisoni'', and a review of feeding mechanisms in other thyreophoran dinosaurs|editor=Carpenter, Kenneth|author=Barrett PM|pages=25\u201352|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-33964-5}}</ref> and their unusual jaws were probably capable of only orthal (up-down) movements.<ref name=\"dinosauria04\" /> Their teeth were \"not tightly pressed together in a block for efficient grinding\",<ref name=\"conciseHistory\">{{cite book | title=Dinosaurs: A Concise Natural History | publisher=Cambridge University Press |author1=Fastovsky, David E.  |author2=Weishampel, David B.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2009 | location=Cambridge, GBR | pages=89\u201390 | isbn=978-0-511-47789-8}}</ref> and no evidence in the fossil record of stegosaurians indicates use of [[gastrolith]]s\u2014the stone(s) some dinosaurs (and some present-day bird species) ingested\u2014to aid the grinding process, so how exactly ''Stegosaurus'' obtained and processed the amount of plant material required to sustain its size remains \"poorly understood\".<ref name=\"conciseHistory\" />\n\n[[File:Stegotooth.svg|thumb|left|Tooth crown illustration]]\nThe stegosaurians were widely distributed geographically in the late Jurassic.<ref name=\"dinosauria04\" /> Palaeontologists believe it would have eaten plants such as mosses, ferns, horsetails, cycads, and conifers or fruits.<ref>\n[http://www.carnegiemnh.org/exhibits/jurassic/fctsteg.htm ''Stegosaurus ungulatus''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312204144/http://www.carnegiemnh.org/exhibits/jurassic/fctsteg.htm |date=2007-03-12 }} Carnegie Museum of Natural History.

Bite force was also calculated using these models and the known skull proportions of the animal, as well as simulated tree branches of different size and hardness. The resultant bite forces calculated for ''Stegosaurus'' were 140.1 [[Newton (unit)|newtons]] (N), 183.7&nbsp;N, and 275&nbsp;N (for anterior, middle and posterior teeth, respectively), which means its bite force was less than half that of a [[Labrador retriever]]. ''Stegosaurus'' could have easily bitten through smaller green branches, but would have had difficulty with anything over 12&nbsp;mm in diameter. ''Stegosaurus'', therefore, probably browsed primarily among smaller twigs and foliage, and would have been unable to handle larger plant parts unless the animal was capable of biting much more efficiently than predicted in this study.<ref>{{cite journal|doi= 10.1007/s00015-010-0025-1|title= A model for the bite mechanics in the herbivorous dinosaur Stegosaurus (Ornithischia, Stegosauridae)|year= 2010|last1= Reichel|first1= Miriam|journal= Swiss Journal of Geosciences|volume= 103|issue= 2|pages= 235\u2013240}}</ref> However, a study published on May 20, 2016 by Stephen Lautenschlager et al. indicates ''Stegosaurus''{{'s}} bite strength was stronger than previously believed.

Based on the results of the study, it was revealed that ''Stegosaurus'' had a bite similar in strength to that of modern herbivorous mammals, in particular, cattle and sheep. Based on this data, it is likely ''Stegosaurus'' also ate woodier, tougher plants such as cycads, perhaps even acting as a means of spreading cycad seeds.

Tobin, 1884]]\nOne of the most recognizable of all dinosaurs,<ref name=\"FasWeis04\" /> ''Stegosaurus'' has been depicted on film, in cartoons and comics and as children's toys. Due to the fragmentary nature of most early ''Stegosaurus'' fossil finds, it took many years before reasonably accurate restorations of this dinosaur could be produced. The earliest popular image of ''Stegosaurus'' was an engraving produced by A. Tobin for the November 1884 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', which included the dinosaur amid a speculative Morrison age landscape. Tobin restored the ''Stegosaurus'' as bipedal and long-necked, with the plates arranged along the tail and the back covered in spikes. This covering of spikes might have been based on a misinterpretation of the teeth, which Marsh had noted were oddly shaped, cylindrical, and found scattered, such that he thought they might turn out to be small dermal spines.<ref name=prehistoric_monsters>Debus, A. A. (2009). ''Prehistoric Monsters: The Real and Imagined Creatures of the Past That We Love to Fear''.

This illustration would later go on to form the basis of the stop-motion puppet used in the 1933 film ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]''.<ref name=dinosaurs_decade/> Like Marsh's reconstruction, Knight's first restoration had a single row of large plates, though he next used a double row for his more well-known 1901 painting, produced under the direction of Frederic Lucas. Again under Lucas, Knight revised his version of ''Stegosaurus'' again two years later, producing a model with a staggered double row of plates. Knight would go on to paint a stegosaur with a staggered double plate row in 1927 for the [[Field Museum of Natural History]], and was followed by [[Rudolph F. Zallinger]], who painted ''Stegosaurus'' this way in his \"Age of Reptiles\" mural at the Peabody Museum in 1947.<ref name=dinosaurs_decade>Moore, R. (2014).

Fossils of this genus date to the [[Late Jurassic]] [[Period (geology)|period]], where they are found in [[Kimmeridgian]] to early [[Tithonian]] aged [[stratum|strata]], between 155 and 150&nbsp;[[Mya (unit)|million years ago]], in the western [[United States]] and [[Portugal]]. Of the species that have been classified in the upper [[Morrison Formation]] of the western US, only three are universally recognized; '''''S. stenops''''', '''''S. ungulatus''''' and '''''S. sulcatus'''''. The remains of over 80 individual animals of this genus have been found. ''Stegosaurus'' would have lived alongside dinosaurs such as ''[[Apatosaurus]]'', ''[[Diplodocus]]'', ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'', ''[[Allosaurus]]'', and ''[[Ceratosaurus]]''; the latter two may have preyed on it.\n\nThese were large, heavily built, [[herbivore|herbivorous]] [[quadruped]]s with rounded backs, short fore limbs, long hind limbs, and tails held high in the air. Due to their distinctive combination of broad, upright plates and tail tipped with [[Thagomizer|spikes]], ''Stegosaurus'' is one of the most recognizable kinds of dinosaurs. The function of this array of plates and spikes has been the subject of much speculation among scientists. Today, it is generally agreed that their spiked tails were most likely used for defense against predators, while their plates may have been used primarily for display, and secondarily for [[thermoregulation|thermoregulatory]] functions. ''Stegosaurus'' had a relatively low [[brain-to-body mass ratio]]. It had a short neck and a small head, meaning it most likely ate low-lying bushes and shrubs. One species, ''Stegosaurus ungulatus'', is the largest known of all the stegosaurians (bigger than related dinosaurs such as ''[[Kentrosaurus]]'' and ''[[Huayangosaurus]]'').\n\n''Stegosaurus'' remains were first identified during the \"[[Bone Wars]]\" by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] at [[Dinosaur Ridge]] National Landmark.  The first known skeletons were fragmentary and the bones were scattered, and it would be many years before the true appearance of these animals, including their posture and plate arrangement, became well understood. Despite its popularity in books and film, mounted skeletons of ''Stegosaurus'' did not become a staple of major natural history museums until the mid-20th century, and many museums have had to assemble composite displays from several different specimens due to a lack of complete skeletons. ''Stegosaurus'' is one of the better-known dinosaurs, and has been featured in film, postal stamps, and many other types of media.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Stegosaurus size comparison.svg|thumb|left|201px|Size of ''S.&nbsp;ungulatus'' (orange) and ''S. stenops'' (green) compared to a human]]\nThe quadrupedal ''Stegosaurus'' is one of the most easily identifiable dinosaur genera, due to the distinctive double row of kite-shaped plates rising vertically along the rounded back and the two pairs of long spikes extending horizontally near the end of the tail.

The skull's low position suggests that ''Stegosaurus'' may have been a browser of low-growing vegetation. This interpretation is supported by the absence of front teeth and their likely replacement by a horny beak or [[beak#Anatomy|rhamphotheca]]. The lower jaw had flat downward and upward extensions that would have completely hidden the teeth when viewed from the side, and these probably supported a turtle-like beak in life.

The presacrals are divided into cervical (neck) and dorsal (back) vertebrae, with around 10 cervicals and 17 dorsals, the total number being one greater than in ''[[Hesperosaurus]]'', two greater than ''[[Huayangosaurus]]'', although ''[[Miragaia]]'' preserves 17 cervicals and an unknown number of dorsals. The first cervical vertebra is the [[axis bone]], which is connected and often fused to the [[atlas bone]]. Farther posteriorly, the proportionately larger the cervicals become, although they do not change greatly in anything other than size. Past the first few dorsals, the [[vertebral centrum|centrum]] of the bones become more elongate front-to-back, and the [[wikt:transverse|transverse]] processes become more elevated [[dorsa]]l. The sacrum of ''S. stenops'' includes four sacral vertebrae, but one of the dorsals is also incorporated into the structure. In some specimens of ''S. stenops'', a caudal is also incorporated, as a caudosacral. In ''[[Hesperosaurus]]'' there are two dorsosacrals, and only four fused sacrals, but in ''[[Kentrosaurus]]'' there may be as many as seven vertebrae in the sacrum, with both dorsosacrals and caudosacrals. ''S. stenops'' preserves 46 caudal vertebrae, and up to 49, and along the series both the centrums and the [[neural spines]] become smaller, until the neural spines disappear at caudal 35.

Fewer ''S. ungulatus'' plates have been found, and none articulated, making the arrangement in this species more difficult to determine.

This first reconstruction, of ''S. ungulatus'' with missing parts filled in from ''S. stenops'', was published by Marsh in 1891.

Lucas reclassified this species in the new genus ''[[Hoplitosaurus]]'' later that year. Lucas also re-examined the issue of the life appearance of ''Stegosaurus'', coming to the conclusion that the plates were arranged in pairs in two rows along the back, arranged above the bases of the ribs. Lucas commissioned [[Charles R. Knight]] to produce a life restoration of ''S. ungulatus'' based on his new interpretation. However, the following year, Lucas wrote that he now believed the plates were probably attached in staggered rows.<ref name=\"gilmore14\"/> In 1910, [[Richard Swann Lull]] wrote that the alternating pattern seen in ''S. stenops'' was probably due to shifting of the skeleton after death. He led the construction of the first ever ''Stegosaurus'' skeletal mount at the [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]], which was depicted with paired plates.<ref name=\"gilmore14\"/> In 1914, Charles Gilmore argued against Lull's interpretation, noting that several specimens of ''S. stenops'', including the now-completely prepared holotype, preserved the plates in alternating rows near the peak of the back, and that there was no evidence of the plates having shifted relative to the body during fossilization.<ref name=\"gilmore14\"/> Gilmore and Lucas' interpretation became the generally accepted standard, and Lull's mount at the Peabody Museum was changed to reflect this in 1924.<ref name=revan2011/>\n\nSophie the ''Stegosaurus'' is the most nearly complete [[fossil]] [[Zoological specimen|specimen]] of a ''Stegosaurus''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ghosh |first=Pallab |date=3 December 2014 |title=Scientists seek to solve mystery of Stegosaurus plates |work=BBC News |quote=Sophie is 80% complete and is thought to be the most complete specimen in the world. |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-30301895}}</ref> It is a young adult of undetermined sex, {{convert|5.6|m|ft}} long and {{convert|2.9|m|ft}} tall.

This was Marsh's initial interpretation, which led to the name 'roof lizard'. As further and complete plates were found, their form showed they stood on edge, rather than lying flat.\n* By 1891, Marsh published a more familiar view of ''Stegosaurus'',<ref name=\"Marsh1891\" /> with a single row of plates. This was dropped fairly early on (apparently because it was poorly understood how the plates were embedded in the skin and they were thought to overlap too much in this arrangement).

By the early 1960s, this had become (and remains) the prevalent idea, mainly because some ''S. stenops'' fossils in which the plates are still partially articulated show this arrangement.

Additional support for this idea was a punctured tail vertebra of an ''Allosaurus'' into which a tail spike fits perfectly.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Carnivorous Dinosaurs|year=2005|chapter=Evidence for predator-prey relationships: Examples for ''Allosaurus'' and ''Stegosaurus''.|editor=Carpenter, Kenneth|vauthors=Carpenter K, Sanders F, McWhinney L, Wood L |pages=325\u201350|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-34539-4}}</ref>\n\n''S. stenops'' had four dermal spikes, each about {{convert|60|\u2013|90|cm|ft|abbr=on}} long. Discoveries of articulated stegosaur armor show, at least in some species, these spikes protruded horizontally from the tail, not vertically as is often depicted.<ref name=\"Carpenter98\" /> Initially, Marsh described ''S.&nbsp;ungulatus'' as having eight spikes in its tail, unlike ''S.&nbsp;stenops''. However, recent research re-examined this and concluded this species also had four.<ref name=\"8spike\" />\n\n=== \"Second brain\" ===\n[[File:Stegosaurus brain.jpg|thumb|Brain cavity of ''S.&nbsp;stenops'' marked with red]]\nAt one time, stegosaurs were described as having a \"second brain\" in their hips. Soon after describing ''Stegosaurus'', Marsh noted a large canal in the hip region of the spinal cord, which could have accommodated a structure up to 20 times larger than the famously small brain. This has led to the influential idea that dinosaurs like ''Stegosaurus'' had a \"second brain\" in the tail, which may have been responsible for controlling reflexes in the rear portion of the body. This \"brain\" was proposed to have given a ''Stegosaurus'' a temporary boost when it was under threat from predators.<ref name=\"FasWeis04\" />\n\nThis space, however, is more likely to have served other purposes. The sacro-lumbar expansion is not unique to stegosaurs, nor even sauropods. It is also present in birds. In their case, it contains what is called the [[glycogen body]], a structure whose function is not definitely known, but which is postulated to facilitate the supply of [[glycogen]] to the animal's [[nervous system]].<ref name=\"Giffin90\">{{cite journal|author=Buchholz (n\u00e9e Giffin) EB|year=1990|title=Gross Spinal Anatomy and Limb Use in Living and Fossil Reptiles|journal=Paleobiology|volume=16|issue=4|pages=448\u201358|doi=10.1017/S0094837300010186}}</ref> It also may function as a balance organ, or reservoir of compounds to support the nervous system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://svpow.com/2009/12/15/lies-damned-lies-and-clash-of-the-dinosaurs/|title=Lies, damned lies, and Clash of the Dinosaurs|date=December 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== Growth ===\nJuveniles of ''Stegosaurus'' have been preserved, probably showing the growth of the genus.

However, their teeth and jaws are very different from those of other herbivorous [[ornithischian]] dinosaurs, suggesting a different feeding strategy that is not yet well understood. The other ornithischians possessed teeth capable of grinding plant material and a jaw structure capable of movements in planes other than simply orthal (i.e. not only the fused up-down motion to which stegosaur jaws were likely limited). Unlike the sturdy jaws and grinding teeth common to its fellow ornithischians, ''Stegosaurus'' (and all stegosaurians) had small, peg-shaped teeth that have been observed with horizontal wear facets associated with tooth-food contact<ref>{{cite book|title=The Armored Dinosaurs|year=2001|chapter=Tooth wear and possible jaw action of ''Scelidosaurus harrisoni'', and a review of feeding mechanisms in other thyreophoran dinosaurs|editor=Carpenter, Kenneth|author=Barrett PM|pages=25\u201352|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-33964-5}}</ref> and their unusual jaws were probably capable of only orthal (up-down) movements.<ref name=\"dinosauria04\" /> Their teeth were \"not tightly pressed together in a block for efficient grinding\",<ref name=\"conciseHistory\">{{cite book | title=Dinosaurs: A Concise Natural History | publisher=Cambridge University Press |author1=Fastovsky, David E.  |author2=Weishampel, David B.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2009 | location=Cambridge, GBR | pages=89\u201390 | isbn=978-0-511-47789-8}}</ref> and no evidence in the fossil record of stegosaurians indicates use of [[gastrolith]]s\u2014the stone(s) some dinosaurs (and some present-day bird species) ingested\u2014to aid the grinding process, so how exactly ''Stegosaurus'' obtained and processed the amount of plant material required to sustain its size remains \"poorly understood\".<ref name=\"conciseHistory\" />\n\n[[File:Stegotooth.svg|thumb|left|Tooth crown illustration]]\nThe stegosaurians were widely distributed geographically in the late Jurassic.<ref name=\"dinosauria04\" /> Palaeontologists believe it would have eaten plants such as mosses, ferns, horsetails, cycads, and conifers or fruits.<ref>\n[http://www.carnegiemnh.org/exhibits/jurassic/fctsteg.htm ''Stegosaurus ungulatus''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312204144/http://www.carnegiemnh.org/exhibits/jurassic/fctsteg.htm |date=2007-03-12 }} Carnegie Museum of Natural History.

Bite force was also calculated using these models and the known skull proportions of the animal, as well as simulated tree branches of different size and hardness. The resultant bite forces calculated for ''Stegosaurus'' were 140.1 [[Newton (unit)|newtons]] (N), 183.7&nbsp;N, and 275&nbsp;N (for anterior, middle and posterior teeth, respectively), which means its bite force was less than half that of a [[Labrador retriever]]. ''Stegosaurus'' could have easily bitten through smaller green branches, but would have had difficulty with anything over 12&nbsp;mm in diameter. ''Stegosaurus'', therefore, probably browsed primarily among smaller twigs and foliage, and would have been unable to handle larger plant parts unless the animal was capable of biting much more efficiently than predicted in this study.<ref>{{cite journal|doi= 10.1007/s00015-010-0025-1|title= A model for the bite mechanics in the herbivorous dinosaur Stegosaurus (Ornithischia, Stegosauridae)|year= 2010|last1= Reichel|first1= Miriam|journal= Swiss Journal of Geosciences|volume= 103|issue= 2|pages= 235\u2013240}}</ref> However, a study published on May 20, 2016 by Stephen Lautenschlager et al. indicates ''Stegosaurus''{{'s}} bite strength was stronger than previously believed. Comparisons were made between it (represented by a specimen known as \"[[Sophie the Stegosaurus|Sophie]]\" from the United Kingdom's Natural History Museum) and two other herbivorous dinosaurs; ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'' and ''[[Plateosaurus]]'' to determine if all three had similar bite forces and similar niches. Based on the results of the study, it was revealed that ''Stegosaurus'' had a bite similar in strength to that of modern herbivorous mammals, in particular, cattle and sheep. Based on this data, it is likely ''Stegosaurus'' also ate woodier, tougher plants such as cycads, perhaps even acting as a means of spreading cycad seeds.

Tobin, 1884]]\nOne of the most recognizable of all dinosaurs,<ref name=\"FasWeis04\" /> ''Stegosaurus'' has been depicted on film, in cartoons and comics and as children's toys. Due to the fragmentary nature of most early ''Stegosaurus'' fossil finds, it took many years before reasonably accurate restorations of this dinosaur could be produced. The earliest popular image of ''Stegosaurus'' was an engraving produced by A. Tobin for the November 1884 issue of ''[[Scientific American]]'', which included the dinosaur amid a speculative Morrison age landscape. Tobin restored the ''Stegosaurus'' as bipedal and long-necked, with the plates arranged along the tail and the back covered in spikes. This covering of spikes might have been based on a misinterpretation of the teeth, which Marsh had noted were oddly shaped, cylindrical, and found scattered, such that he thought they might turn out to be small dermal spines.<ref name=prehistoric_monsters>Debus, A. A. (2009). ''Prehistoric Monsters: The Real and Imagined Creatures of the Past That We Love to Fear''. McFarland.</ref>\n\nMarsh published his more accurate skeletal reconstruction of ''Stegosaurus'' in 1891, and within a decade ''Stegosaurus'' had become among the most-illustrated types of dinosaur.<ref name=prehistoric_monsters/> Artist [[Charles R. Knight]] published his first illustration of ''Stegosaurus ungulatus'' based on Marsh's skeletal reconstruction in a November 1897 issue of ''[[The Century Magazine]]''. This illustration would later go on to form the basis of the stop-motion puppet used in the 1933 film ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]''.<ref name=dinosaurs_decade/> Like Marsh's reconstruction, Knight's first restoration had a single row of large plates, though he next used a double row for his more well-known 1901 painting, produced under the direction of Frederic Lucas. Again under Lucas, Knight revised his version of ''Stegosaurus'' again two years later, producing a model with a staggered double row of plates. Knight would go on to paint a stegosaur with a staggered double plate row in 1927 for the [[Field Museum of Natural History]], and was followed by [[Rudolph F. Zallinger]], who painted ''Stegosaurus'' this way in his \"Age of Reptiles\" mural at the Peabody Museum in 1947.<ref name=dinosaurs_decade>Moore, R. (2014).
