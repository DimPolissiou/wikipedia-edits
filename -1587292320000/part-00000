Yet, further investigation has revealed that the trading had no connection with 9/11. A single U.S.-based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al Qaeda purchased 95 percent of the UAL puts on September 6 as part of a trading strategy that also included ''buying'' 115,000 shares of American on September 10. Similarly, much of the seemingly suspicious trading in American on September 10 was traced to a specific U.S.-based options trading newsletter, faxed to its subscribers on Sunday, September 9, which recommended these trades.

[[David Ray Griffin]] and [[Alex Jones]] have asserted that large parts of the plane, including the main body of the engine, landed miles away from the main wreckage site, too far away for an ordinary plane crash. Jones says that planes usually leave a small debris field when they crash, and that this is not compatible with reports of wreckage found farther away from the main crash site.

They join the movement for different reasons, loosely self-assemble to fill different roles and are united by their shared mistrust in experts and the establishment (government and reputable sources of knowledge), and conspiratorial stance. Through their engagement, they each find their own fulfillment and satisfaction. Together, they contribute to the persistence, resilience and exaggerated claims of acceptance (in general public) of the movement. These three groups are:<ref name=Bartlett>{{cite journal |last1=Bartlett |first1=Jamie |last2=Miller |first2=Carl |title=A Bestiary of the 9/11 Truth Movement: Notes from the Front Line |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |volume=35.4 |issue=July/August |pages=43\u201346 |year=2011 |publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/a_bestiary_of_the_9_11_truth_movement_notes_from_the_front_line |accessdate=May 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001051753/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/a_bestiary_of_the_9_11_truth_movement_notes_from_the_front_line |archive-date=October 1, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n* Hard Core: The organizers and active members of the various 9/11 Truth Movement organizations. They produce the information, spot the anomalies and technical inconsistencies, provide the technical base and form the theories. While they claim to be only interested in facts and to use [[scientific method]], they commit the logical fallacy of '[[confirmation bias]]' by pre-determining the outcome, then searching for corroborating evidence while ignoring the vast body of [[peer-review]]ed, independent, consensual research which contradict their theories. They supply the physical structure of the movement by organizing events, seminars, discussions, marches and distributing flyers and pamphlets. Their numbers are relatively small but they are tight-knit and highly connected. Their worldview favors 'super-conspiracy', a master plan that is behind conspiracies which they believe they are uncovering.<ref name=Bartlett/>\n* Critically turned: They are the young students and political activists whose affiliation with the 9/11 Truth Movement often is rooted from their dissatisfaction and anger at the established political and social order. Their sense of justice and [[idealism]] propels them to activism against perceived oppression and social injustice. Their penchant to use Internet, especially [[social media]], and tech savvy make them the propaganda machine for the movement. They produce [[YouTube]] videos and films with cool, countercultural content, make good use of pop culture parody and eye-catching graphics. The countercultural street cred of their productions buy them broad appeal and exposure to millions of people.<ref name=Bartlett/>\n* Illiterati: They are the movement's mass membership backbone, a large, diffuse group which give the movement exaggerated claims of popularity and influence. Participation in the 9/11 Truth Movement, to this group of people, is as much a social and recreational pursuit as the quest for truth. Their partaking is mostly through [[web 2.0]] social networking and YouTube. Their commentaries often are emotional and they make no pretense to be accurate, balanced or to show genuine intent to find truth. Involvement with the movement that fit their worldview gives them a sense of identity and belonging, which they find more appealing than the facts and evidences of the 9/11 terrorist attack itself.<ref name=Bartlett/>\n\n== Media reaction ==\nWhile discussion and coverage of these theories is mainly confined to Internet pages, books, documentary films, and conversation, a number of mainstream news outlets around the world have covered the issue.\n\nThe Norwegian version of the July 2006 ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'' sparked interest when they ran, on their own initiative, a three-page main story on the 9/11 attacks and summarized the various types of 9/11 conspiracy theories (which were not specifically endorsed by the newspaper, only recensed).<ref>[http://www.lmd.no/index.php?article=947 11.September \u2013 en innsidejobb?], Norwegian edition of ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', July 2006.

According to an international poll that same year, huge majorities in Muslim countries prefer to believe baseless conspiracy theories rather than listen to the mainstream facts of what happened on September 11, 2001, in New York City and Washington. Although al-Qaeda occasionally brags about its \"achievement,\" 75 percent of Egyptian citizens, for example, still deny that Arabs carried out the attacks, as a Pew study reported in July 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/getting-egypts-morsi-to-give-up-911-conspiracy-rhetoric/2012/09/11/4ca304ea-fb97-11e1-8adc-499661afe377_story.html |title=Getting Egypt's Morsi to give up his 9/11 'truther' talk by Robert Satloff and Eric Trager of the Washington Post September 11, 2012 |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=June 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Legal cases ==\nArmy specialist April Gallop filed suit claiming that Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]], and other Bush administration officials orchestrated the 9/11 attacks and that the Pentagon was hit by an attack ordered by Cheney. The suit was dismissed in 2010 by Judge [[Denny Chin]], who said the claim was \"the product of cynical delusion and fantasy\". Her lawyers filed an appeal to the [[U.S. Court of Appeals]] which in April 2010 issued a [[show cause order]] why the lawyers and Gallop should not be sanctioned for filing a frivolous lawsuit. Her lawyers asked that the judges on the Court of Appeals recuse themselves because their emotions made them prejudge the case and abuse their power. On October 14, 2011, the judges sanctioned her lawyers $15,000 each for both the frivolous lawsuits and the accusations of prejudice. Gallop was not fined because of her unfamiliarity with the law.<ref>{{cite web|author=vicfedorov |url=http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/PubArticleNY.jsp?id=1202519035977&slreturn=1 |title=Circuit Levels $15,000 in Sanctions Against 9/11 Conspiracy Theorists New York Law Journal October 17, 2010 |publisher=Newyorklawjournal.com |date= |accessdate=June 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Opinion polls about 9/11 conspiracy theories]]\n* [[Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge conspiracy theory|1941 Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge conspiracy theory]]\n* [[Controversies about the 2004 Madrid train bombings|2004 Madrid train bombings controversies]]\n* [[Conspiracy theories about the July 2005 London bombings|2005 London July bombings conspiracy theories]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n<!-- {{sfn|Barkun|2003}} -->\n* {{cite book| last = Barkun | first = M. | year = 2003 | title = A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America | publisher = University of California Press | isbn = 978-0-520-23805-3 | ref = harv}}\n<!-- {{sfn|Dunbar|Reagan|2011}} -->\n* {{cite book | editor-last1 = Dunbar | editor-first1 = D. | editor-last2 = Reagan | editor-first2 = B. | title = Debunking 9/11 Myths: Why conspiracy theories can't stand up to the facts | publisher = Hearst | location = New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-1-58816-855-9 | ref = harv}}\n<!-- {{sfn|Mol\u00e9|2006}} -->\n* {{cite journal | last = Mol\u00e9 | first = P. | title = 9/11 Conspiracy Theories: The 9/11 Truth Movement Perspective | journal = ESkeptic | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | year = 2006 | publisher = [[The Skeptics Society]] | location = Altadena, California | url = http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/06-09-11 | accessdate = June 2, 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090606001336/http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/06-09-11| archivedate=June 6, 2009 | url-status= live | issn = 1556-5696 | ref = harv}}\n<!-- {{sfn|Powell|2006}} -->\n* {{cite news | last = Powell | first = M. | title = 9/11 conspiracy theorists multiply | newspaper = The Seattle Times | date = September 9, 2006 | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003250424_911conspire09.html | accessdate = September 21, 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140308001143/http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2003250424_911conspire09.html | archivedate = March 8, 2014 | url-status = dead | ref = harv | df = mdy-all }}\n<!-- NOT USED -->\n<!--\n* {{Cite book| last = Begin | first = Jeremy | year = 2007 | title = Fighting for G.O.D.

Thomas pointed out that when [[Jesse Ventura]] hired [[New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology|New Mexico Tech]] to conduct a demonstration showing nanothermite slicing through a large steel beam, the nanothermite produced copious flame and smoke but no damage to the beam, even though it was in a horizontal, and therefore optimally positioned.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Thomas | first1=Dave | title=The 9/11 Truth Movement: The Top Conspiracy Theory, a Decade Later | journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] | date=July\u2013August 2011 | pages=34\u201340 | volume=35 | issue=4 | url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_9_11_truth_movement_the_top_conspiracy_theory_a_decade_later/ | access-date=September 11, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923074425/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_9_11_truth_movement_the_top_conspiracy_theory_a_decade_later | archive-date=September 23, 2012 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) concluded the accepted version was more than sufficient to explain the collapse of the buildings.

Jones says that planes usually leave a small debris field when they crash, and that this is not compatible with reports of wreckage found farther away from the main crash site.

Most no-planes adherents, including [[Thierry Meyssan]] and Reynolds, assert that either CGI of a passenger plane was overlaid onto a winged cruise missile or military aircraft, or that computer-generated images of a passenger plane were inserted into the video footage and plane-shaped explosive cut-outs were planted in the buildings in order to create the impression of plane impact.<ref>[Weekend Live, Fox News, September 10, 2006|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reQZT9Hzvt8]</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/01/september11.france|title=US invented air attack on Pentagon, claims French book|last=Henley|first=Jon|date=2002-04-01|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-04-25|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>The Great Derangement, Matt Taibbi, New York, 2009</ref> Some truth movement veterans have repeatedly refuted the \"no-plane\" claims.<ref name=\"women.timesonline.co.uk\"/><ref name=\"msnbc\">{{Cite news| url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003250424_911conspire09.html| title = WP: 9/11 conspiracy theories| author = Michael Powell| date = September 8, 2006| publisher = [[MSNBC]]| accessdate = June 13, 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100723110251/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003250424_911conspire09.html| archivedate = July 23, 2010| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref> In fact, discussion of no-plane theories has been banned from certain conspiracy theory websites and advocates have sometimes been threatened with violence by posters at other conspiracy theory websites.<ref name=Yoda>{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2007-08-09/news/the-yoda-of-9-11/5 |title=The Yoda of 9/11|page=5 |work=Phoenix News|publisher=Phoenixnewtimes.com |date= |accessdate=July 20, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Cover-up allegations ==\nPaul Zarembka, in his book, ''The Hidden History of 9/11'', states that the debris from ground zero was removed without a proper forensic investigation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/12/911thebigcoverup|title=9/11 \u2013 the big cover-up?|author=Peter Tatchell|publisher=Guardian News and Media, Ltd.|date=September 12, 2007|accessdate=January 12, 2010 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100110223812/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/sep/12/911thebigcoverup| archivedate=January 10, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o9jo_In37aEC&pg=PA95&dq=9/11+coverup+debris+removal|title=The hidden history of 9-11-2001|author=Paul Zermebka|publisher=Elsevier JAI|year=2006|pages=94, 95|isbn=978-0-7623-1305-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Cockpit recorders ===\n[[File:Flight 77 CVR.jpg|thumb|The [[cockpit voice recorder]] from [[American Airlines Flight 77|Flight 77]] was heavily damaged from the impact and resulting fire.]]\nAccording to the 9/11 Commission Report, both black boxes from Flight 77 and both black boxes from Flight 93 were recovered.

They produce the information, spot the anomalies and technical inconsistencies, provide the technical base and form the theories. While they claim to be only interested in facts and to use [[scientific method]], they commit the logical fallacy of '[[confirmation bias]]' by pre-determining the outcome, then searching for corroborating evidence while ignoring the vast body of [[peer-review]]ed, independent, consensual research which contradict their theories. They supply the physical structure of the movement by organizing events, seminars, discussions, marches and distributing flyers and pamphlets. Their numbers are relatively small but they are tight-knit and highly connected. Their worldview favors 'super-conspiracy', a master plan that is behind conspiracies which they believe they are uncovering.<ref name=Bartlett/>\n* Critically turned: They are the young students and political activists whose affiliation with the 9/11 Truth Movement often is rooted from their dissatisfaction and anger at the established political and social order. Their sense of justice and [[idealism]] propels them to activism against perceived oppression and social injustice. Their penchant to use Internet, especially [[social media]], and tech savvy make them the propaganda machine for the movement. They produce [[YouTube]] videos and films with cool, countercultural content, make good use of pop culture parody and eye-catching graphics. The countercultural street cred of their productions buy them broad appeal and exposure to millions of people.<ref name=Bartlett/>\n* Illiterati: They are the movement's mass membership backbone, a large, diffuse group which give the movement exaggerated claims of popularity and influence. Participation in the 9/11 Truth Movement, to this group of people, is as much a social and recreational pursuit as the quest for truth. Their partaking is mostly through [[web 2.0]] social networking and YouTube. Their commentaries often are emotional and they make no pretense to be accurate, balanced or to show genuine intent to find truth. Involvement with the movement that fit their worldview gives them a sense of identity and belonging, which they find more appealing than the facts and evidences of the 9/11 terrorist attack itself.<ref name=Bartlett/>\n\n== Media reaction ==\nWhile discussion and coverage of these theories is mainly confined to Internet pages, books, documentary films, and conversation, a number of mainstream news outlets around the world have covered the issue.\n\nThe Norwegian version of the July 2006 ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'' sparked interest when they ran, on their own initiative, a three-page main story on the 9/11 attacks and summarized the various types of 9/11 conspiracy theories (which were not specifically endorsed by the newspaper, only recensed).<ref>[http://www.lmd.no/index.php?article=947 11.September \u2013 en innsidejobb?], Norwegian edition of ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', July 2006.

According to an international poll that same year, huge majorities in Muslim countries prefer to believe baseless conspiracy theories rather than listen to the mainstream facts of what happened on September 11, 2001, in New York City and Washington. Although al-Qaeda occasionally brags about its \"achievement,\" 75 percent of Egyptian citizens, for example, still deny that Arabs carried out the attacks, as a Pew study reported in July 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/getting-egypts-morsi-to-give-up-911-conspiracy-rhetoric/2012/09/11/4ca304ea-fb97-11e1-8adc-499661afe377_story.html |title=Getting Egypt's Morsi to give up his 9/11 'truther' talk by Robert Satloff and Eric Trager of the Washington Post September 11, 2012 |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref>\n\n== Legal cases ==\nArmy specialist April Gallop filed suit claiming that Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]], and other Bush administration officials orchestrated the 9/11 attacks and that the Pentagon was hit by an attack ordered by Cheney.

Her lawyers filed an appeal to the [[U.S. Court of Appeals]] which in April 2010 issued a [[show cause order]] why the lawyers and Gallop should not be sanctioned for filing a frivolous lawsuit. Her lawyers asked that the judges on the Court of Appeals recuse themselves because their emotions made them prejudge the case and abuse their power. On October 14, 2011, the judges sanctioned her lawyers $15,000 each for both the frivolous lawsuits and the accusations of prejudice.

The will appointed her granddaughter Lady Mary Stewart (d. 1668) as executor, but she was still a minor when the countess died in London in March 1644. Her daughters and their husbands instead acted as executors.<ref>Marilyn M. Brown & Michael Pearce, 'The Gardens of Moray House, Edinburgh', ''Garden History'' 47:1 (2019), p. 5, citing 'Will of Maria Soton, Countess of Home', TNA Prob/11/272/611 ff. 403-6, and NLS MS. 14547.</ref>\n\n===The will and the Commonwealth===\nIn 1648 Lauderdale's share of her possessions and furniture in London was forfeited by his [[Committee for Compounding with Delinquents|delinquency]] and given to [[John Ireton]] and William Geere. Claims that the furnishings belonged to his daughter or had been sold to a Scottish merchant in London, Robert English, were disregarded. Some goods at Aldersgate were sold in October 1648. It also came to light that Mary had lent \u00a32,000 to the [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Cleveland|Earl of Cleveland]] and obtained property in Hackney and Stepney, and \u00a31000 to Elizabeth Ashfield, a neighbour in Aldersgate, gaining her lands at North Barsteed in Suffolk.<ref>''Calendar of the Proceedings of the Committee for Advance of Money, 1642-1656'', part 2 (London, 1888), p. 948-952, the [[National Library of Scotland]] holds related papers and charters from the archive of the [[Marquess of Tweeddale|Tweeddale]] archive, including the Lauderdale's marriage contract, and the executry papers MS 14547.</ref> A challenge to the administration of the will by a third-party William Dudley, demonstrating that goods belonged not to Lauderdale but to his daughter, and that the executors had not been lawfully appointed, failed in 1658. Lauderdale was enabled to recover his property at the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]. It is due to the complexities of dividing her goods and this legal battle that her inventories survive to give a unique insight into the material culture of Anglo-Scottish aristocrat in the 1630s.<ref>Marilyn M.

The Gamecocks represent [[University of South Carolina]] in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[Southeastern Conference]].\n\nAlthough South Carolina began competing in intercollegiate football in 1892,<ref name=\"MG\" /> the school's official record book does not generally contain entries from before the late 1940s, as records before this time are often incomplete and inconsistent. These lists are dominated by more recent players for several reasons:\n* Since 1949, seasons have increased from 10 games to 11 and then 12 games in length.\n* The NCAA didn't allow freshmen to play varsity football until [[1972 college football season|1972]] (with the exception of the [[World War II]] years), allowing players to have four-year careers.\n* [[Bowl game]]s only began counting toward single-season and career statistics in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://a.espncdn.com/ncf/news/2002/0828/1423821.html|title = NCAA changes policy on football stats|date = 2002-08-28|accessdate

Economic activity is limited to servicing [[meteorology|meteorological]] and [[geophysics|geophysical]] research stations and French and other fishing fleets.\n\nThe main fish resources are [[Patagonian toothfish]] and [[spiny lobster]]. Both are poached by foreign fleets; because of this, the [[French Navy]], and occasionally other services, patrol the zone and arrest poaching vessels. Such arrests can result in heavy fines and/or the seizure of the ship.\n\nFrance previously sold licenses to foreign fisheries to fish the Patagonian toothfish; because of overfishing, it is now

Economic activity is limited to servicing [[meteorology|meteorological]] and [[geophysics|geophysical]] research stations and French and other fishing fleets.\n\nThe main fish resources are [[Patagonian toothfish]] and [[spiny lobster]]. Both are poached by foreign fleets; because of this, the [[French Navy]], and occasionally other services, patrol the zone and arrest poaching vessels. Such arrests can result in heavy fines and/or the seizure of the ship.\n\nFrance previously sold licenses to foreign fisheries to fish the Patagonian toothfish; because of overfishing, it is now restricted to a small number of fisheries from R\u00e9union Island.\n\nThe territory takes in revenues of about [[euro|\u20ac]]16 million a year.\n\n== Codes ==\nThe French Southern Territories (i.e. the TAAF excluding Ad\u00e9lie Land) have been given the following [[country code|country codes]]: FS ([[List of FIPS country codes|FIPS]]) and [[ISO 3166-2:TF|TF]] ([[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]]).\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Geography|Africa|<!--East Africa-->|<!--Indian Ocean-->|France|<!--French Southern and Antarctic Lands-->}}\n\n* [[Administrative divisions of France]]\n* <!-- [[Bibliography of France]] -->\n* [[France]]\n* [[French colonial empire]]\n* <!-- [[Index of France-related articles]] -->\n* [[List of French islands in the Indian and Pacific oceans]]\n* [[List of French possessions and colonies]]\n* [[Outline of France]]\n* [[Overseas France]]\n* <!-- {{wikipedia books link|France}} -->\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|French Southern and Antarctic Lands}}\n{{Wikivoyage}}\n\n* {{wikiatlas|the French Southern and Antarctic Lands}}\n* {{Official website}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130316074522/http://www.france.fr/en/regions-and-cities/french-southern-and-antarctic-lands French Southern and Antarctic Lands] \u2013 Official French website (in English)\n* {{CIA World Factbook link|fs|French Southern and Antarctic Lands}}\n* {{dmoz|Regional/Polar_Regions/Antarctic/French_Southern_Territories|French Southern Territories}}\n* [http://www.discoverfrance.net/Colonies/Antarctic.shtml Southern & Antarctic Territories]\n* [http://www.discoverfrance.net/Colonies/Crozet.shtml Crozet Archipelago]\n* [http://www.discoverfrance.net/Colonies/Kerguelen.shtml Kerguelen Archipelago]\n* [http://www.discoverfrance.net/Colonies/Terre_Adelie.shtml Terre Ad\u00e9lie]\n\n{{Districts of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands}}\n{{World Heritage Sites in France}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n|list = \n{{Peri-Antarctic countries and overseas territories}}\n{{French overseas departments and territories|state=collapsed}}\n{{EU dependencies|state=collapsed}}\n{{Outlying territories of European countries|state=collapsed}}\n{{Antarctica claims|state=collapsed}}\n{{Countries of Africa}}\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:French Southern and Antarctic Lands| ]]\n[[Category:Overseas France]]\n[[Category:Island countries of the Indian Ocean]]\n[[Category:Dependent territories in Africa]]\n[[Category:East African countries]]\n[[Category:Southeast African countries]]\n[[Category:France and the Antarctic]]\n[[Category:Territorial claims in Antarctica]]\n[[Category:Geography of Antarctica]]\n[[Category:Geography of Overseas France]]\n[[Category:Special territories of the European Union]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1955]]\n[[Category:1955 establishments in France]]\n[[Category:1955 in Antarctica]]\n[[Category:Ramsar sites in France]]\n[[Category:World Heritage Sites in France]]\n", "name_user": "Kenwick", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Southern_and_Antarctic_Lands"}
