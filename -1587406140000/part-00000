On 23 October 1805 ''Aeneas'' was wrecked on the coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] with terrible loss of life.\n\n==Convoy==\nA large collection of shipping gathered in the English port of [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] with the intention of sailing across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in [[convoy]] to supplement the garrison in [[Quebec]] with soldiers of the [[100th Regiment of Foot (Prince Regent's County of Dublin Regiment)|100th Regiment of Foot]].  In addition to this unit, replacements for regiments already in [[British North America]], the families of the soldiers being sent abroad, several government officials, and numerous private passengers also took passage. \n\nThe ships were a mix of small [[warship]]s, government-owned [[Transport (ship)|transports]], and private [[Merchant ship|merchantmen]] gathered together with the hope of safety in numbers from the large number of French [[privateers]] which were operating against British shipping during the [[War of the Third Coalition]] at the time. The disadvantage to this plan was that should some crisis befall the convoy, the damage would be substantially more serious than if it had occurred amongst independently sailing ships. The convoy departed Falmouth on 29 August 1805, expecting to make landfall in [[Canada]] sometime towards the end of September.\n\nThe passage was substantially worse than had been anticipated, with the convoy experiencing severe autumn storms in the North Atlantic, with strong winds and heavy seas. This caused a serious delay in the arrival of the convoy, resulting in the exhaustion of the ships' food and fresh water supplies and causing a surge in the spread of infectious diseases, especially in the packed [[troopship]]s. The first ships began to make landfall scattered across the Canadian coast on 20 October with [[Two Friends (ship)|''Two Friends'']] being lost off the south coast of [[Cape Breton Island]] on the 22nd.\n\n==Wreck==\nThe loss of ''Two Friends'' was unfortunate, but was nothing compared to the catastrophe which befell ''Aeneas'' the following day. The heavy transport had become totally separated from the main body of the convoy some time before, and was relying on her own navigation to make the Canadian coast in appalling weather. Crammed into her hold were 347 people consisting of soldiers of the 100th, many women and children from their families and the ship's crew.\n\nAt 4 a.m. on 23 October 1805, the ship went ashore somewhere near [[Cape Ray]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] in total darkness and raging wind. The exact location is unknown, but is believed to be a submerged reef close to the [[Isle aux Morts]]. The passengers poured on deck in a state of panic, which contributed to the disaster when a huge waves swept hundreds of struggling people into the sea. Within four hours, the ship had broken up, and 35 survivors were washed onto a tiny islet about half a mile from the scene of the disaster. An incredible back surge of water then carried any more survivors and all possible salvage from the ship far out to sea. Amongst this little band were two army officers, seven sailors and 26 soldiers, who spent the remains of the day building a raft.\n\nBy the next morning, five had died from exposure and three more were in a bad state when the raft made landfall on a desolate patch of coastline. Upon landfall, the three desperately ill men were abandoned by the main party, who walked south hoping to find succour. Two other sailors became separated from the group, and two soldiers volunteered to remain with one of the officers when he collapsed, whilst the remaining officer, Ensign Faulkner, led the remaining 21 survivors southwards. \n\nA passing hunter, Michael Gilliam, who stayed in a hut during the summer collecting furs, discovered the three sick men, and with the help of the two detached sailors removed them to his hut, where the six remained for the winter. At some point they were joined by the two soldiers left guarding the officer, who had been discovered and rescued by a band of hunters after said officer perished.  \n\nIn the spring of 1806, this band of hunters and survivors made their way to [[Fortune Bay]], and from there to Quebec, where they were reunited with the remainder of their regiment and told the tale of the loss of ''Aeneas''. Of Ensign Faulkner and his band, there has never been any sign. It is believed they perished somewhere in the deep woods, either of starvation or due to the advancing winter.\n\n==Notes==\nThe Canadian coast was and is notorious for wrecks and disasters of this kind, especially in this period, when it was sparsely inhabited and poorly mapped. There has been some discrepancy with the number of people killed in the wreck, with contemporary reports mentioning \"230 souls\" lost, despite the ship's manifest clearly stating 347 persons aboard, of which seven survived. This is probably simply an error caused by the long communication distances and questionable book-keeping prevalent at the time.\n\n==References==\n* Grocott, Terence, Shipwrecks of the Revolutionary & Napoleonic Eras, Caxton Editions, Great Britain: 2002. {{ISBN|1-84067-164-5}}.\n\n{{1805 shipwrecks}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Aeneas'' (troopship)|noerror}}\n[[Category:Shipwrecks of the Newfoundland and Labrador coast|Aeneas]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 1805]]\n", "text_old": "{|{{Infobox ship begin <!-- age of sail -->\n|infobox caption= <!-- keywords: yes, nodab; or caption text -->\n|display title= <!-- keywords: none, ital; or article title with markup -->\n}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n|Ship image=\n|Ship image size=\n|Ship caption=\n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n|Hide header=\n|Ship country= \n|Ship flag={{flag|United Kingdom|civil}}\n|Ship name= ''Aeneas''\n|Ship owner=\n|Ship ordered=\n|Ship builder=\n|Ship original cost=\n|Ship laid down=\n|Ship launched=\n|Ship acquired=\n|Ship commissioned=\n|Ship decommissioned=\n|Ship in service=\n|Ship out of service=\n|Ship renamed=\n|Ship struck=\n|Ship reinstated=\n|Ship honours=\n|Ship honors=\n|Ship captured=\n|Ship fate= Wrecked 23&nbsp;October&nbsp;1805\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n{{Infobox ship characteristics\n|Hide header=\n|Header caption=\n|Ship class=\n|Ship tons burthen=\n|Ship length=\n|Ship beam=\n|Ship draught=\n|Ship draft=\n|Ship hold depth=\n|Ship propulsion=[[Sailing ship]]\n|Ship sail plan=\n|Ship complement=\n|Ship armament=\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n|}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2012}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2012}}\n'''''Aeneas''''' was a wooden [[sailing ship]] named after the [[Aeneas|Trojan hero]] of the ''[[Iliad]]''.\n\nShe was owned by the British government and used to transport troops to garrisons across the [[British Empire]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

Pliny informs us that a form of ''alumen'' was found naturally in the earth, and calls it ''salsugoterrae''.\n\nPliny wrote that different substances were distinguished by the name of ''alumen'', but they were all characterised by a certain degree of [[astringent|astringency]], and were all employed in dyeing and medicine.<ref name=\"pliny\" /> Pliny says that there is another kind of alum that the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]]s call ''schiston'', and which \"splits into filaments of a whitish colour\",<ref name=\"pliny\" /> From the name ''schiston'' and the mode of formation, it appears that this kind was the salt that forms spontaneously on certain salty minerals, as alum [[slate]] and bituminous [[shale]], and consists chiefly of sulfates of iron and aluminium.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} One kind of ''alumen'' was a liquid, which was apt to be adulterated; but when pure it had the property of blackening when added to [[pomegranate]] juice. This property seems to characterize a solution of [[Iron(II) sulfate|iron sulfate]] in water; a solution of ordinary (potassium) alum would possess no such property. Contamination with iron sulfate was greatly disliked as this darkened and dulled dye colours. In some places the iron sulfate may have been lacking, so the salt would be white and would be suitable, according to Pliny, for dyeing bright colors.\n\nPliny describes several other types of alumen but it is not clear as to what these minerals are. The ''alumen'' of the ancients, then, was not always potassium alum, not even an alkali aluminum sulfate.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=766-767}}\n\n====Alum described in medieval texts====\nAlum and [[Iron(II) sulfate|green vitriol]] (iron sulfate) both have sweetish and astringent taste, and they had overlapping uses. Therefore, through the [[Middle Ages]], alchemists and other writers do not seem to have discriminated the two salts accurately from each other. In the writings of the [[alchemy|alchemists]] we find the words ''misy'', ''sory'', and ''chalcanthum'' applied to either compound; and the name ''atramentum sutorium'', which one might expect to belong exclusively to green vitriol, applied indifferently to both.\n\n===Modern understanding of the alums===\n\nIn the early 1700s, [[Georg Ernst Stahl]] claimed that reacting sulfuric acid with limestone produced a sort of alum.<ref name=stahl1>George Ernst Stahl (1703), [http://www.e-rara.ch/zut/content/pageview/4572022 ''Specimen Beccherianum''].

This property seems to characterize a solution of [[Iron(II) sulfate|iron sulfate]] in water; a solution of ordinary (potassium) alum would possess no such property. Contamination with iron sulfate was greatly disliked as this darkened and dulled dye colours. In some places the iron sulfate may have been lacking, so the salt would be white and would be suitable, according to Pliny, for dyeing bright colors.\n\nPliny describes several other types of alumen but it is not clear as to what these minerals are.
