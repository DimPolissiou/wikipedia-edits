Tropical climates are characterized by monthly average temperatures of 18\u2103 (64.4 \u2109) or higher year-round, and have high levels of precipitation. There are no remarkable seasonal variations in tropical climates. Most tropical climate regions are located around the Equator with latitudes ranging from 25 degrees south to 24 degrees north.\n\nThere are three types of climates belonging to the Tropical Climate group: [[Tropical rainforest climate|Tropical rainforest climate(Af)]], [[Tropical monsoon climate|Tropical monsoon climate(Am)]] and [[Tropical savanna climate|Tropical wet and dry or savanna climate(Aw or As)]], which are classified and distinguished by the annual precipitation and the precipitation level of the driest month in those regions.\n\n== K\u00f6ppen climate classification ==\n[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] is one of the most widely used climate classification systems. It defines a tropical climate as a region where the temperature of the coldest month is greater than or equal to 18\u2103 (64.4 \u2109) and classifies them as an A-group (tropical climate group).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Kottek|first=Markus|last2=Grieser|first2=J\u00fcrgen|last3=Beck|first3=Christoph|last4=Rudolf|first4=Bruno|last5=Rubel|first5=Franz|date=2006-07-10|title=World Map of the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification updated|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0941-2948/2006/0130|journal=Meteorologische Zeitschrift|volume=15|issue=3|pages=259\u2013263|doi=10.1127/0941-2948/2006/0130|issn=0941-2948}}</ref> A-group regions are usually found around the Equator, including Central America, northern part of South America, central part of Africa, southern part of Asia and the Pacific Ocean islands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at|title=World maps of K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn Group A, there are three types of climate: [[Tropical rainforest climate|Tropical rainforest climate(Af)]], [[Tropical monsoon climate|Tropical monsoon climate(Am)]] and [[Tropical savanna climate|Tropical wet and dry or savanna climate (Aw or As)]].

Due to the high temperature and abundant rainfall, some plants can grow throughout the year. High temperature and humidity is the most suitable environment for epiphytes to grow. Plants of all sizes can vegetate under tropical climates. Vegetations grow in layers: [[Shrub|shrubs]] under tall trees, and bushes under shrubs. Almost every inch of space is being well used.

{"title_page": "Deck (building)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Deck (disambiguation){{!}}Deck}}\n{{More citations needed|date=August 2007}}\n[[File:Backyard deck.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A deck in the backyard of a [[suburb]]an house.]]\n[[File:Deck-roof.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A high level corridor deck in the backyard of a [[suburb]]an house, in Australia]]\n[[File:Deck-2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A high level deck in the backyard of a [[suburb]]an house, in Australia. The decking is a [[Malaysia]]n [[timber]], ''selangan batu'']]\nIn [[architecture]], a '''deck'''  is a flat surface capable of supporting weight, similar to a [[floor]], but typically constructed outdoors, often elevated from the ground, and usually connected to a building. The term is a generalization of [[deck (ship)|deck]]s as found on ships.\n\n==Functions and materials==\nWood or timber \"decking\" can be used in a number of ways: as part of garden landscaping, to extend living areas of houses, and as an alternative to stone based features such as [[patio]]s. Decks are made from [[treated lumber]], [[composite lumber]], [[composite material]],  and [[Aluminum]]. Lumber may be [[Western red cedar]], [[teak]], [[mahogany]], [[ip\u00ea]], reclaimed and recycled [[Eusideroxylon zwageri|Ulin]] and other [[hardwood]]s.  Recycled planks may be [[high-density polyethylene]] ([[HDPE]]), [[polystyrene]] (PS) and [[Polyethylene terephthalate#Uses|PET plastic]] as well as mixed plastics and wood fiber (often called \"composite\" lumber). Artificial decking products are often called \"[[wood-plastic composite]]s\". These days, WPC's have more widely known by different brands like NewTechWood, Azek, Ecornboard etc.\n\nHistorically, the softwoods used for decking were logged from old growth forests. These include [[Atlantic white cedar]], [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] and [[Western red cedar]] (redcedar). [[Atlantic City]] built the first coastal [[boardwalk]] in the [[United States]], originally constructed of Atlantic white cedar. However, it was not long before the commercial logging of this tree and clearing of cedar swamps in [[New Jersey]] caused a decline in the availability of decking. Atlantic City and [[New York City]] both switched to Western red cedar. By the 1960s, Western red cedar from the US was declining due to over-logging. More expensive Western red cedar was available from western [[Canada]] ([[British Columbia]]) but by then, pressure treated pine had become available.\n\nBut even with chemical treatments (such as [[chromated copper arsenate]] or CCA), pine decking is not as durable as cedars in an outdoor environment. Thus, many [[municipalities]] and homeowners are turning to [[hardwoods]]. Decks are often built from [[pressure treated wood]]. Pressure treated wood is long lasting and holds up to wet and icey weather conditions. Pressure treated wood however is treated with chemicals which have been known to be toxic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lumber Pressure Treated with Chromated Copper Arsenate|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/8790.html|publisher=New York State Department of Environmental Conservation|year=2013}}</ref> It is also important to note that both softwood and hardwood decks will need to be finished after installation using either an oil or varnish to prevent weathering, wear, mould, algae and wood boring insects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blueprintjoinery.com/blog/choosing-the-best-decking-oil/|title=Choosing The Best Decking Oil|website=Blueprint Joinery|language=en|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, hardwoods used for decking come from [[tropical forests]]. Much of the logging taking place to produce these woods, especially teak, mahogany and ip\u00ea, is occurring illegally, as outlined in numerous reports by environmental organizations such as [[Greenpeace]], [[Friends of the Earth]] and [[Rainforest]] Relief.<ref name = \"Teak\">{{Citation  | first = Tim  | last = Keating  |  title = Teak is Torture: Forced Labor Logging in Burma  | year = 1997  | pages =   | place =   | publisher = Rainforest Relief, New York  | url = http://www.rainforestrelief.org/documents/Teak_Is_Torture.pdf  | doi =   | id = }}</ref><ref name = \"Impact\">{{Citation  | first = Tim  | last = Keating  |  title = Deep Impact: An Estimate of Tropical Rainforest Acres Impacted for a Board Foot of Imported Ip\u00ea  | year = 1998  | pages =   | place =   | publisher = Rainforest Relief, New York  | url = http://www.rainforestrelief.org/documents/Deep_Impact_2.pdf  | doi =   | id = }}</ref><ref name=\"Mahogany\">{{Citation | last = Monbiot | first = George | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Mahogany is Murder: Mahogany Extraction from Indian Reserves in Brazil | publisher = Friends of the Earth, London | year = 1992 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-1-85750-160-5}}</ref> US tropical wood imports are rising, partly due to the demand for decking.\n\nDue to environmental and durability concerns, composite decking (a mixture of two materials, typically wood pulp and recycled material such as plastic bottles or plastic bags) have appeared on the market. Proponents of [[composite decking]] have touted this as a much needed development as this helps to curb logging of trees for new decks. However composite decking has been found to contain harmful chemicals, cannot be refurbished, and despite claims from decking companies, some composite decking still attracts mold. However newer more modern composites feature a cap or shell that prevents mold and staining.<ref>{{cite web|last=Paster|first=Pablo|title=Deck: Wood or Plastic?|url=http://www.treehugger.com/green-architecture/deck-wood-or-plastic.html|publisher=Treehugger|year=2009}}</ref>\n\nResidential decks may contain spaces for cooking, dining and seating. Cooking areas ideally should be situated near the patio door while out of the way from general foot traffic. Dining spaces will include patio tables.  For a typical 6 person outdoor patio table building an area of 12' x 16' (4x5 m) is ideal. If deck space is available, homeowners may choose to include a seating area for outdoor couches and benches.\n\n==Construction==\nThe deck of a [[house]] is generally a wooden platform built above the ground and connected to the main building. It is generally enclosed by a [[handrail|railing]] for safety. Access may be from the house through [[door]]s and from the ground via a [[stairway]]. Residential decks can be constructed over steep areas or rough ground that is otherwise unusable. Decks can also be covered by a [[canopy (building)|canopy]] or [[pergola]] to control sunlight. Deck designs can be found in numerous books, do-it-yourself magazines and web sites, and from the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]].<ref>L.O. Anderson, T.B. Heebink, and A.E. Oviatt. (1972).[http://naldr.nal.usda.gov/NALWeb/Agricola_Link.asp?Accession=CAT10309354 \"Construction guides for exposed wood decks. Agriculture handbook no. 432\"]{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Washington: USDA, Forest Service.</ref>\n\nTypical construction is either of a post and beam architecture, or a cantilever construction. The post and beam construction relies on posts anchored to piers in the ground. Typically these types of structural decks are engineered and require an experienced construction company that specializes in structural decks. Cantilever decks rely on floor joists that protrude out further than the wall of the house. While this type of construction is common, it raises significant safety issues if the decks are not properly waterproofed and flashed. There have been a growing number deck failures resulting in death and critical injuries. Another key component of decks are code compliant railings. Railings on decks above 30 inches are considered guard rails. Guard rails have a specific building code requirement for both height and structural strength. Most U.S. commercial building codes require a 42-inch guardrail on decks, and 36 or 42 inches for residential code depending on the state. Typical railing assemblies must meet structural strength requirements of 200lbs of load force per foot. In short, decks are complex load bearing structures that most often require structural engineering, plans, and permits.\n\nLarger buildings may also have decks on the upper floors of the building which can be open to the public as [[observation deck]]s or [[skyrise greenery|greeneries]].\n\nA deck is also the surface used to construct a [[boardwalk]] over sand on [[barrier islands]].\n\nLaying deck or throwing deck refers to the act of placing and bolting down [[cold-formed steel]] beneath roofing and concrete floors.

The decking is a [[Malaysia]]n [[timber]], ''Selangan Batu'']]\nIn [[architecture]], a '''deck'''  is a flat surface capable of supporting weight, similar to a [[floor]], but typically constructed outdoors, often elevated from the ground, and usually connected to a building. The term is a generalization of [[deck (ship)|deck]]s as found on ships.\n\n==Functions and materials==\nWood or timber \"decking\" can be used in a number of ways: as part of garden landscaping, to extend living areas of houses, and as an alternative to stone based features such as [[patio]]s. Decks are made from [[treated lumber]], [[composite lumber]], [[composite material]],  and [[Aluminum]]. Lumber may be [[Western red cedar]], [[teak]], [[mahogany]], [[ip\u00ea]], reclaimed and recycled [[Eusideroxylon_zwageri|Ulin]] and other [[hardwood]]s.  Recycled planks may be [[high-density polyethylene]] ([[HDPE]]), [[polystyrene]] (PS) and [[Polyethylene terephthalate#Uses|PET plastic]] as well as mixed plastics and wood fiber (often called \"composite\" lumber). Artificial decking products are often called \"[[wood-plastic composite]]s\". These days, WPC's have more widely known by different brands like NewTechWood, Azek, Ecornboard etc.\n\nHistorically, the softwoods used for decking were logged from old growth forests. These include [[Atlantic white cedar]], [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] and [[Western red cedar]] (redcedar). [[Atlantic City]] built the first coastal [[boardwalk]] in the [[United States]], originally constructed of Atlantic white cedar. However, it was not long before the commercial logging of this tree and clearing of cedar swamps in [[New Jersey]] caused a decline in the availability of decking. Atlantic City and [[New York City]] both switched to Western red cedar. By the 1960s, Western red cedar from the US was declining due to over-logging. More expensive Western red cedar was available from western [[Canada]] ([[British Columbia]]) but by then, pressure treated pine had become available.\n\nBut even with chemical treatments (such as [[chromated copper arsenate]] or CCA), pine decking is not as durable as cedars in an outdoor environment. Thus, many [[municipalities]] and homeowners are turning to [[hardwoods]]. Decks are often built from [[pressure treated wood]]. Pressure treated wood is long lasting and holds up to wet and icey weather conditions. Pressure treated wood however is treated with chemicals which have been known to be toxic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lumber Pressure Treated with Chromated Copper Arsenate|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/8790.html|publisher=New York State Department of Environmental Conservation|year=2013}}</ref> It is also important to note that both softwood and hardwood decks will need to be finished after installation using either an oil or varnish to prevent weathering, wear, mould, algae and wood boring insects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blueprintjoinery.com/blog/choosing-the-best-decking-oil/|title=Choosing The Best Decking Oil|website=Blueprint Joinery|language=en|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, hardwoods used for decking come from [[tropical forests]]. Much of the logging taking place to produce these woods, especially teak, mahogany and ip\u00ea, is occurring illegally, as outlined in numerous reports by environmental organizations such as [[Greenpeace]], [[Friends of the Earth]] and [[Rainforest]] Relief.<ref name = \"Teak\">{{Citation  | first = Tim  | last = Keating  |  title = Teak is Torture: Forced Labor Logging in Burma  | year = 1997  | pages =   | place =   | publisher = Rainforest Relief, New York  | url = http://www.rainforestrelief.org/documents/Teak_Is_Torture.pdf  | doi =   | id = }}</ref><ref name = \"Impact\">{{Citation  | first = Tim  | last = Keating  |  title = Deep Impact: An Estimate of Tropical Rainforest Acres Impacted for a Board Foot of Imported Ip\u00ea  | year = 1998  | pages =   | place =   | publisher = Rainforest Relief, New York  | url = http://www.rainforestrelief.org/documents/Deep_Impact_2.pdf  | doi =   | id = }}</ref><ref name=\"Mahogany\">{{Citation | last = Monbiot | first = George | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Mahogany is Murder: Mahogany Extraction from Indian Reserves in Brazil | publisher = Friends of the Earth, London | year = 1992 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-1-85750-160-5}}</ref> US tropical wood imports are rising, partly due to the demand for decking.\n\nDue to environmental and durability concerns, composite decking (a mixture of two materials, typically wood pulp and recycled material such as plastic bottles or plastic bags) have appeared on the market. Proponents of [[composite decking]] have touted this as a much needed development as this helps to curb logging of trees for new decks. However composite decking has been found to contain harmful chemicals, cannot be refurbished, and despite claims from decking companies, some composite decking still attracts mold. However newer more modern composites feature a cap or shell that prevents mold and staining.<ref>{{cite web|last=Paster|first=Pablo|title=Deck: Wood or Plastic?|url=http://www.treehugger.com/green-architecture/deck-wood-or-plastic.html|publisher=Treehugger|year=2009}}</ref>\n\nResidential decks may contain spaces for cooking, dining and seating. Cooking areas ideally should be situated near the patio door while out of the way from general foot traffic. Dining spaces will include patio tables.  For a typical 6 person outdoor patio table building an area of 12' x 16' (4x5 m) is ideal. If deck space is available, homeowners may choose to include a seating area for outdoor couches and benches.\n\n==Construction==\nThe deck of a [[house]] is generally a wooden platform built above the ground and connected to the main building. It is generally enclosed by a [[handrail|railing]] for safety. Access may be from the house through [[door]]s and from the ground via a [[stairway]]. Residential decks can be constructed over steep areas or rough ground that is otherwise unusable. Decks can also be covered by a [[canopy (building)|canopy]] or [[pergola]] to control sunlight. Deck designs can be found in numerous books, do-it-yourself magazines and web sites, and from the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]].<ref>L.O. Anderson, T.B. Heebink, and A.E. Oviatt. (1972).[http://naldr.nal.usda.gov/NALWeb/Agricola_Link.asp?Accession=CAT10309354 \"Construction guides for exposed wood decks. Agriculture handbook no. 432\"]{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Washington: USDA, Forest Service.</ref>\n\nTypical construction is either of a post and beam architecture, or a cantilever construction. The post and beam construction relies on posts anchored to piers in the ground. Typically these types of structural decks are engineered and require an experienced construction company that specializes in structural decks. Cantilever decks rely on floor joists that protrude out further than the wall of the house. While this type of construction is common, it raises significant safety issues if the decks are not properly waterproofed and flashed. There have been a growing number deck failures resulting in death and critical injuries. Another key component of decks are code compliant railings. Railings on decks above 30 inches are considered guard rails. Guard rails have a specific building code requirement for both height and structural strength. Most U.S. commercial building codes require a 42-inch guardrail on decks, and 36 or 42 inches for residential code depending on the state.

He is suspected of having murdered three individuals in different states: Kathleen McCormack Durst, his first wife, who disappeared in New York in 1982; [[Susan Berman]], his longtime friend, who was killed in [[California]] in 2000; and his neighbor, Morris Black, who was killed in [[Texas]] in 2001. Durst was the subject of a multi-state manhunt after Black's body parts were found floating in [[Galveston Bay]], but although he admitted to the dismembering of Black (which he was not charged with), he was ultimately acquitted of his murder on the grounds of self defense.  \n\nOn March 14, 2015, Durst was arrested in [[New Orleans]] on a [[first-degree murder]] warrant in relation to the Berman killing. On November 4, 2016, he was transferred to California and soon after was [[Arraignment|arraigned]] in [[Los Angeles]] on first-degree murder charges. In October 2018, Los Angeles County Superior Judge Mark Windham ruled there was sufficient evidence for Durst to be tried for the death of Berman.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thejewishvoice.com/2018/10/31/judge-rules-that-ny-real-estate-heir-durst-stand-trial-for-murder/|title=Judge Rules that NY Real Estate Heir Durst Stand Trial for Murder|first=Andrew|last=Schiff|newspaper=[[The Jewish Voice]]|date=October 31, 2018|accessdate=February 20, 2019}}</ref> His trial began on 2 March 2020<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/truecrime/robert-dursts-fate-will-rest-with-12-jurors-the-only-audience-that-matters-now/ar-BB10E1Dx?ocid=spartanntp|title=Robert Durst's fate will rest with 12 jurors, the only audience that matters now|first=Matt|last=Hamilton|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=March 2, 2020|accessdate=March 2, 2020}}</ref> but was postponed when Superior court judge Mark E Windham announced that the trial, which had been under way for six days, will stand adjourned until 6 April due to the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] outbreak.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-15/robert-durst-murder-trial-postponed-due-to-coronavirus|title=Robert Durst murder trial postponed because of coronavirus as court announces new safety measures|first=Matt|last=Hamilton|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=March 15, 2020|accessdate=March 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nOne of four children, Robert Durst was born on April 12, 1943<ref name=WOTrace>{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Marion|title=Without a Trace|date=November 18, 2002|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=0-312-98502-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jNadyEUsW98C&pg=PA13}}</ref> and grew up in [[Scarsdale, New York]], in a Jewish family.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chilewich |first1=Aron |title=Robert Durst\u2019s Jewish background |url=https://jewishjournal.com/culture/religion/164809/ |website=Jewish Journal |publisher=Tribe Media Corp |accessdate=7 September 2019}}</ref> He is the son of real estate investor [[Seymour Durst]] and his wife [[Bernice Herstein]].

The game is a [[Clone (computing)|clone]] of the ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' franchise, and as such, features nearly identical gameplay. The main draw of the game is its ability to play community-made songs, which has resulted in a large [[Fandom|fan community]] around the game.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:CloneHero Gameplay.jpg|left|thumb|Gameplay screenshot, showcasing notes on the highway; song progression, star, and star power meters; point, star, and combo counter; and combo multiplier.|alt=Against a black background, there is a black rectangle, foreshortened to look like a highway. At the bottom, there are five empty colored circles. Circular notes are falling down the highway and landing over the slots of matching color. Attached to the side of the highway is an x3 multiplier, and a blue meter, partially filled. A blue progress meter, a point counter, a star with a counter in it, a star completion bar, and an orange combo counter are held in a small clump of elements to the right side of the highway.]]\n\n''Clone Hero'', by design, features nearly identical gameplay to ''Guitar Hero''. Specifically, the game is most similar to later entries in the series such as ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour|World Tour]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock|Warriors of Rock]]'', using [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] assets from those games. Gameplay involves pressing colored buttons on a [[guitar]]-shaped controller to play along to songs, although in ''Clone Hero'' these inputs can be mapped to a keyboard or any other input device. Players must hold specific buttons that line up with colored notes that appear on the screen on a \"highway\"; when the notes hit the bottom of the highway, the player must strum to hit the notes in time with the music. There is also an \"open strum\" note, represented with a purple bar, which requires the player to strum without pressing any other buttons. In addition to normal notes, there are \"HOPO\"s (\"[[Hammer-on|Hammer-ons]]\" and \"[[Pull-off|Pull-offs]]\") and \"tap notes\", which both do not require the player to strum them to hit them, with the difference between the two being that a string of HOPOs must begin with a strum, and the player must re-strum if they miss a note. Unlike the ''Guitar Hero'' series, by default there is no penalty for missing notes, aside from breaking a combo, making it impossible to fail a song, although there is an option to enable this. The game also contains a mode which emulates the gameplay of ''[[Guitar Hero Live]]'', which is notably different from other games in the series, as well as support for drum-based charts.\n\n''Clone Hero'' has the ability to play community-made songs, called \"charts\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-01-meet-the-community-reviving-classic-guitar-hero-gameplay-in-their-own-clone|title=The spirit of Guitar Hero lives on in a bizarre community-made clone|last=Stubbs|first=Mike|date=2018-05-01|website=Eurogamer|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200403231817/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-01-meet-the-community-reviving-classic-guitar-hero-gameplay-in-their-own-clone|archive-date=2020-04-03|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.avclub.com/guitar-heroes-never-die-they-just-start-playing-clone-1828254899|title=Guitar Heroes never die, they just start playing Clone Hero|last=Neilan|first=Dan|date=August 10, 2018|website=AV Club|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200403231952/https://news.avclub.com/guitar-heroes-never-die-they-just-start-playing-clone-1828254899|archive-date=2020-04-03|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> However, unlike games in the ''Guitar Hero'' series, these songs do not need to be original compositions, and can instead be any audio file a member of the community wishes to turn into a playable chart.

At the bottom, there are five empty colored circles. Circular notes are falling down the highway and landing over the slots of matching color. Attached to the side of the highway is an x3 multiplier, and a blue meter, partially filled. A blue progress meter, a point counter, a star with a counter in it, a star completion bar, and an orange combo counter are held in a small clump of elements to the right side of the highway.]]\n\n''Clone Hero'', by design, features nearly identical gameplay to ''Guitar Hero''. Specifically, the game is most similar to later entries in the series such as ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour|World Tour]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock|Warriors of Rock]]'', using [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] assets from those games. Gameplay involves pressing colored buttons on a [[guitar]]-shaped controller to play along to songs, although in ''Clone Hero'' these inputs can be mapped to a keyboard or any other input device. Players must hold specific buttons that line up with colored notes that appear on the screen on a \"highway\"; when the notes hit the bottom of the highway, the player must strum to hit the notes in time with the music. There is also an \"open strum\" note, represented with a purple bar, which requires the player to strum without pressing any other buttons. In addition to normal notes, there are \"HOPO\"s (\"[[Hammer-on|Hammer-ons]]\" and \"[[Pull-off|Pull-offs]]\") and \"tap notes\", which both do not require the player to strum them to hit them, with the difference between the two being that a string of HOPOs must begin with a strum, and the player must re-strum if they miss a note. Unlike the ''Guitar Hero'' series, by default there is no penalty for missing notes, aside from breaking a combo, making it impossible to fail a song, although there is an option to enable this. The game also contains a mode which emulates the gameplay of ''[[Guitar Hero Live]]'', which is notably different from other games in the series, as well as support for drum-based charts.\n\n''Clone Hero'' has the ability to play community-made songs, called \"charts\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-01-meet-the-community-reviving-classic-guitar-hero-gameplay-in-their-own-clone|title=The spirit of Guitar Hero lives on in a bizarre community-made clone|last=Stubbs|first=Mike|date=2018-05-01|website=Eurogamer|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200403231817/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-01-meet-the-community-reviving-classic-guitar-hero-gameplay-in-their-own-clone|archive-date=2020-04-03|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.avclub.com/guitar-heroes-never-die-they-just-start-playing-clone-1828254899|title=Guitar Heroes never die, they just start playing Clone Hero|last=Neilan|first=Dan|date=August 10, 2018|website=AV Club|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200403231952/https://news.avclub.com/guitar-heroes-never-die-they-just-start-playing-clone-1828254899|archive-date=2020-04-03|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> However, unlike games in the ''Guitar Hero'' series, these songs do not need to be original compositions, and can instead be any audio file a member of the community wishes to turn into a playable chart.
