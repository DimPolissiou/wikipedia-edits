The campaign involved [[commerce raiding]] by detached forces and two minor engagements, eventually culminating in the full fleet action of the [[Glorious First of June]] 1794, at which both fleets were badly mauled and both Britain and France claimed victory. The French lost seven battleships; the British none, but the battle distracted the British fleet long enough for the French convoy to safely reach port.\n\nBy the spring of 1794, the [[First French Republic|French Republic]], under the rule of the [[National Convention]], was at [[French Revolutionary Wars|war with all its neighbours]]. With [[famine]] imminent, the French [[Committee of Public Safety]] looked to France's colonies and the United States to provide an infusion of grain; this was to be convoyed across the [[Atlantic]] during April, May and June, accompanied by a small escort squadron and supported by a second, larger squadron in the [[Bay of Biscay]]. However, political upheaval had severely reduced the [[French Navy]]'s ability to fight coherently and supply shortages had devastated its morale, significantly weakening the fleet. Britain, by contrast, was at a high state of readiness with a well-organised command structure, but was suffering from a severe shortage of trained seamen with which to man its large navy. The French Atlantic Fleet, under Admiral [[Villaret de Joyeuse]], was tasked with keeping the British Channel Fleet occupied long enough for the convoy to reach France safely. The Channel Fleet, commanded by [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]], knew of the convoy's passage, and dispatched squadrons to protect British commerce while pursuing Villaret himself with the main body of the Royal Navy's Channel Fleet. For over a week the two battlefleets manoeuvred around one another, Villaret drawing Howe deeper westwards into the Atlantic and away from the convoy. Two partial but inconclusive fleet actions on 28 and 29 May followed, during which Howe seized the [[weather gage]] from Villaret, granting him freedom to choose the time and place of his next attack.\n\nThe culminating action of the campaign took place over {{convert|400|nmi|km}} into the Atlantic, and became known as the Glorious First of June. This final engagement saw Howe use the weather gage to attack Villaret directly while his opponent attempted to fight in a traditional [[line of battle]] formation. In the battle, the British fleet inflicted a heavy defeat on the French after a bitterly contested day of fighting. Forcing Villaret to retreat, Howe's force captured seven French battleships, one of which later sank, and inflicted 7,000 casualties on the enemy. Villaret however, claimed strategic success as his delaying tactics had bought enough time for the convoy to reach France safely. The battle was the first in a series of defeats the French Navy suffered during the early years of the war, which bred a defeatist attitude and an unwillingness among the French officer corps to engage the British at sea.\n\n==Background==\nIn the winter of 1793, war and internal disorder had combined with poor weather to leave France facing starvation following the collapse of the harvest.<ref>Williams, p. 381.</ref> France's ongoing [[French Revolutionary Wars|conflict]] with her neighbours precluded overland imports; the only nation willing and able to sell grain to the [[National Convention]] was the United States. Importing food from the Americas was a highly risky venture, as the British [[Royal Navy]]\u2014at war with France since early 1793\u2014patrolled much of the Atlantic passage. To provide effective protection for the vessels involved, a plan was agreed between France and the United States to collect the supplies over a period of months and transport them in a single convoy. A gathering point was arranged at [[Hampton Roads]] in the [[Chesapeake Bay]].<ref name=\"NT89\">Tracy, p. 89</ref>\n\nA squadron commanded by Admiral [[Pierre Vanstabel]] was dispatched to Hampton Roads to provide escort. Vanstabel would bring the convoy to the Bay of Biscay, where a second squadron under [[Joseph-Marie Nielly]] would reinforce him for the rest of the journey.<ref name=\"BI128\"/> Together, these officers mustered six [[ships of the line]] and numerous smaller craft.<ref name=\"WJ127\">James, p. 127</ref> The main French battlefleet of 25 ships under Admiral [[Villaret de Joyeuse]] would cruise the Bay of Biscay in order to challenge the British Channel Fleet if it attempted to intercept the supplies. The convoy's passage was expected to take approximately two months, and it included 117 [[cargo ship|merchant ships]] carrying enough food to feed France for a year.<ref name=\"WJ127\"/>\n\n[[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]], admiral of the British Channel Fleet, was aware of the convoy's nature and destination long before it left the Chesapeake, and made preparations to block its passage. Sending several small squadrons to protect British commerce crossing the Bay of Biscay, Howe detailed Admiral [[George Montagu (Royal Navy officer)|George Montagu]] with six battleships to search for the convoy in the south of the Bay while Howe took the main body of the fleet, 26 ships of the line, to patrol near Brest.<ref name=\"WJ125\">James, p. 125</ref>\n\n==May 1794==\n{{see also|Order of battle at the Glorious First of June}}\nApril 1794 was a month of fevered activity on both sides of the [[English Channel]] as Villaret and Howe made their final preparations for the coming campaign. The slow French convoy had departed American waters on 2 April, and British convoys destined for the [[British Empire|Empire]] had sailed from Portsmouth on 2 May. Howe used his whole force to provide them with protection as far as the [[Western Approaches]], and on 5 May sent the [[frigates]] [[HMS Latona (1781)|HMS ''Latona'']] and [[HMS Phaeton (1782)|HMS ''Phaeton'']] close in to Brest to ascertain the status of the French\u2014they reported that Villaret's battlefleet was still in harbour.<ref name=\"WJ126\">James, p. 126</ref>\n\n===Commerce raiding===\nOut in the Atlantic, the detached squadrons of Nielly (French) and Montagu (British) were [[commerce raiding]] against enemy merchant shipping, but had thus far failed to find the main food convoy. Nielly encountered a British convoy from Newfoundland and took ten ships as [[Prize (law)|prizes]]\u2014including the convoy escort, the 32-gun [[frigate]] [[HMS Castor (1785)|HMS ''Castor'']].<ref name=\"BI128\">Ireland, p. 128</ref> [[Thomas Troubridge]], captain of the ''Castor'', would spend the entire campaign aboard Nielly's flagship [[French ship Sans Pareil (1793)|''Sans Pareil'']].<ref name=\"ODNBTroubridge\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27765?docPos=3 Troubridge, Sir Thomas], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', P.K. Crimmin, retrieved 23 December 2007</ref> Montagu also met with some success on 15 May, recapturing the merchant ships Nielly had taken, along with the French corvette ''Marie-Guiton'' and accurate intelligence on the direction and size of the French convoy which Montagu immediately passed to Howe.<ref name=\"NM134\">Mostert, p. 134</ref> Resuming his patrol in the Mid-Atlantic, Nielly found the convoy from America a few days later, and transferred two of his ships to Vanstabel's escort to augment the convoy's defences. He then returned to the Eastern Atlantic to look for signs of British activity which might pose a threat to its passage.<ref name=\"WJ128\"/> He also dispatched frigates to Villaret, carrying information about the convoy's location and speed.\n\nWhile Nielly and Montagu searched out at sea, Howe took his fleet on a series of cruises back and forth across the Bay of Biscay in the hope of catching the convoy. Between 5 and 18 May he found nothing and so returned to Brest, where his scouting frigates reported that the French battlefleet had gone.<ref name=\"WJ127\" />  Taking advantage of dense fog, Villaret had sailed the previous day, his ships passing within earshot of the British fleet.<ref name=\"WJ128\"/> The French admiral was on the trail of Nielly's squadron; his intention was to meet both Nielly and the convoy and combine forces; with superior numbers he would then be able to escort the convoy to France in safety. Having eluded Howe and still some days from his planned rendezvous, Villaret gained an unexpected success when he ran across a Dutch convoy of 53 vessels. Its escorts, [[Dutch ship Alliance|''Alliance'']] and [[Dutch ship Waakzaamheid|''Waakzaamheid'']], fled at the sight of the approaching French fleet, and Villaret was free to attack the convoy, capturing 20 [[cargo ship|merchantmen]].<ref name=\"WJ128\">James, p. 128</ref>\n\n===Howe's pursuit===\nHowe realised that the direction of Villaret's departure would take him directly across Admiral Montagu's planned route, and that, should Montagu meet Villaret, the British squadron would be destroyed.<ref name=\"WJ129\">James, p. 129</ref> Setting all sail in pursuit, Howe followed Villaret into the Atlantic on 20 May. The next day Howe's ships recaptured ten of the lost Dutch merchantmen, but he was forced to burn them since crewing them with British sailors would weaken his own already understrength fleet.<ref name=\"NM135\">Mostert, p. 135</ref> Prisoners from these ships gave Howe the information that the French fleet was only a short distance ahead, but that it had been joined by an additional ship from Nielly's squadron as well as several frigates.<ref name=\"BI128\"/> By now satisfied that Montagu was safely to the southwest, Howe pressed on hoped to bring Villaret to battle within the week. On 23 May however, the British fleet was driven southwards by strong winds and had to slowly work its way north to find the French track again. The detour did however enable him to recapture and destroy four more of Villaret's Dutch prizes.<ref name=\"WJ129\"/>\n\nOn the morning of 25 May Howe's pursuit finally bore fruit, when his scouting frigates spotted a lone French ship of the line at 04:00. This ship sighted Howe's force at the same time, and immediately made off in the direction of the French fleet. The fleeing battleship left behind an American merchant ship she had been towing, which when taken reported that the French ship was [[French ship Audacieux (1784)|''Audacieux'']], of Nielly's squadron.<ref name=\"WJ130\">James, p. 130</ref> Pursuing ''Audacieux'' after burning the American prize, the British fleet also overran and burnt two French corvettes, the 20-gun ''R\u00e9publicaine'' and 16-gun ''Inconnue''.<ref name=\"RG27\">Gardiner, p. 27</ref> Continuing his chase over the next three days, on 28 May Howe's lookouts spotted the French on the eastern horizon slightly to the south, indicating that the French held the weather gage.<sup>[[#notea|[Note A]]]</sup><ref name=\"RG28\">Gardiner, p. 28</ref>\n\n==28 May==\n[[File:Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe - Project Gutenberg eText 18314.jpg|thumb|upright|Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe;<br />mezzotint engraving by R. Dunkarton, after the painting by [[John Singleton Copley]]]]\nWith his enemy visible from the deck of his flagship by 06:30, Howe recalled his frigates and ordered his fleet to press on all sail in the hope of engaging the rear of the scattered French line.<ref name=\"WJ130\" /> By 10:35 Howe's continued pursuit was making his own battleline ragged, but he pressed on in the belief that Villaret intended to use the weather gage to outrun him and escape. To counter this, Howe ordered his fastest ships into a flying squadron under Admiral [[Thomas Pasley]].<ref name=\"FJ94\">Jane, p. 94</ref> This squadron was significantly faster than the majority of the vessels in either fleet and rapidly closed with the French rear. The first shots of the engagement were fired at 14:30 by [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS ''Russell'']], commanded by [[John Willett Payne]], which managed some long-distance fire at the rearmost French ships on the opposite tack. Fire was returned by the French but without significant effect.<ref name=\"NT96\">Tracy, p. 96, ''Biographical Memoir of Rear-Admiral John Willett Payne''</ref> In an attempt to hold off Pasley's squadron, at 17:00 the French [[first rate]] 110-gun [[French ship Bretagne (1766)|''R\u00e9volutionnaire'']] exchanged places with the smaller [[third rate]]s at the rear of the line and engaged the pursuing British van.<ref name=\"BI128\"/> This manoeuvre was apparently conducted on the initiative of Captain Vandangel of ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' without orders from Admiral Villaret or his political observer [[Jean Bon Saint-Andr\u00e9]].<ref name=\"WJ131\">James, p. 131</ref>\n\nThrough a sharp and skilful tack, [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS ''Bellerophon'']], one of the slowest ships in the British van, succeeded in bringing the ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' to steady action at 18:00. The ships exchanged fire for twenty minutes, the weaker ''Bellerophon'' taking severe damage to her rigging, and falling back to be replaced by [[HMS Marlborough (1767)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] under Captain [[George Cranfield Berkeley]].<ref name=\"NT100\">Tracy, p. 100, ''Proceedings of His Majesty's Ship the Orion''</ref> ''Marlborough'' was joined by HMS ''Russell'' and [[HMS Thunderer (1783)|HMS ''Thunderer'']], and between them they shot away much of the ''R\u00e9volutionnaire's'' rigging, so that by 19:30 she was unmanageable.<ref name=\"NT97\">Tracy, p. 97, ''The Biographical Memoirs of the Right Honourable Lord Gardner''</ref> [[HMS Leviathan (1790)|HMS ''Leviathan'']] also joined the action, firing at an unidentified ship ahead of ''R\u00e9volutionnaire''.<ref name=\"WJ132\">James, p. 132</ref> Concerned about Pasley's squadron becoming cut off from the main body of his fleet, Howe recalled them to the British line at 20:00. All complied except the newly arrived [[HMS Audacious (1785)|HMS ''Audacious'']] under Captain [[Sir William Parker, 1st Baronet, of Harburn|William Parker]]. ''Audacious'' had engaged ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' so closely that she could not safely withdraw, and although her gunnery eventually dismasted her huge opponent, ''Audacious'' took severe damage.<ref name=\"FJ94\"/>\n\nIt was not until 22:00 that ''Audacious'' and ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' disentangled themselves and limped apart\u2014their respective fleets now some way off.<ref name=\"WJ132\"/> ''Audacious's'' crew later claimed that ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' had struck her colours during the engagement, although this has not been corroborated.<ref name=\"WJ132\" />  Parker stated that he did not take possession of ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' because he was concerned by the distant sighting of nine French battleships on the horizon. He had spotted a squadron under Commodore [[Jean-Joseph Castagnier]], which was uninvolved in the current campaign and which soon disappeared without participating in any of the subsequent engagements.<ref name=\"WJ133\"/> ''Audacious's'' crew made strenuous efforts to repair their ship and rejoin the British fleet during the night, but became disorientated and in the morning ''Audacious'' was still only half a mile from her former opponent.<ref name=\"WJ133\"/>\n\n''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' had suffered much more severely than ''Audacious'', but survived the encounter without being boarded thanks to a misread signal by Captain [[Sir Albemarle Bertie, 1st Baronet|Albemarle Bertie]] of ''Thunderer'', who failed to take possession of the dismasted three-decker when ordered to.<ref name=\"WJ133\"/> During the night Villaret sent reinforcements to rescue ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'', and at dawn on 29 May Parker saw that his large opponent was soon to be supported by the undamaged ship of the line ''Audacieux'', the frigate [[French frigate Bellone (1778)|''Bellone'']], and two corvettes. Once more ''Audacious'' came under fire from ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'', leaving her no option but to flee this superior force.<ref name=\"WJ133\">James, p. 133</ref> ''Audacious'' was chased for half an hour by ''Bellone'' and the corvettes, before losing them in a rain squall, and eventually returned to [[Plymouth]] on 3 June. ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' also escaped pursuit and was taken under tow by ''Audacieux'', who brought her safely to [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] several days later.<ref name=\"RG28\"/> For leaving the battlefleet before the main engagement, ''R\u00e9volutionnaire''{{'}}s captain was subsequently arrested.<ref name=\"BI128\"/>\n\n==29 May==\n[[File:Louis-Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse, vice-amiral (1750-1812).jpg|thumb|upright|Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse, 1839 painting by [[Jean-Baptiste Paulin Gu\u00e9rin|Gu\u00e9rin]]]]\nWith ''Audacious'' and ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' lost in the dark behind them, both British and French fleets continued westwards towards the convoy rendezvous. At dawn on 29 May the British fleet saw ''Audacieux'' retiring to the east but did not follow, concentrating on the main French line with the hope of provoking a decisive engagement.<ref name=\"WJ134\">James, p. 134</ref> Howe ordered his ships to pursue the enemy rear, and the British line was placed on a tack that was intended to cut through the French line and isolate and capture the ships east of the cut. Captain [[Anthony James Pye Molloy|Anthony Molloy]] in [[HMS Caesar (1793)|HMS ''Caesar'']] was chosen to lead the attack as his ship was the fastest in the fleet, but the manoeuvre was a complete failure due to the inexplicable refusal of Molloy to close with the enemy.<ref name=\"NM137\">Mostert, p. 137</ref> Instead, ''Caesar'' and [[HMS Queen (1769)|HMS ''Queen'']] opened fire on the rearmost French ships from a distance.<ref name=\"NT96\"/> The vans of the opposing fleets then engaged in a long-range broadside duel from 10:00. This inflicted mild damage on both sides, the worst hit being the French [[French ship Jupiter (1789)|''Montagnard'']].<ref name=\"WJ143\">James, p. 143</ref>\n\nHaving failed to cut the French line at his first attempt, Howe reissued the order at 12:30. Once more ''Caesar'' was to lead the way, with the intention of splitting the enemy fleet in half.<ref name=\"WJ135\">James, p. 135</ref> Captain Molloy then refused to carry out the order, signalling without cause that ''Caesar'' was unable to tack and then turning and sailing eastwards down the outside of the British fleet, rather than towards the enemy.<ref name=\"WJ138\">James, p. 138</ref> This unexpected move threw the following ships into a state of confusion; ''Queen'', coming behind ''Caesar'', attempted to obey Howe's signal alone but was badly damaged by shot, and her captain [[John Hutt (Royal Navy officer)|John Hutt]] mortally wounded.<ref name=\"ODNBHutt\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14295 Hutt, John], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[J. K. Laughton]], retrieved 23 December 2007</ref> Unable to effectively manoeuvre, ''Queen'' passed down the outside of the French line, firing as she went.<ref name=\"NT96\" />\n\nHis plan in tatters, Howe responded by example, leading his flagship [[HMS Queen Charlotte (1790)|HMS ''Queen Charlotte'']] towards the French line which was rapidly slipping ahead of the British, steering around the meandering ''Caesar'' as he did so.<ref name=\"NM138\">Mostert, p. 138</ref> ''Queen Charlotte'' first attempted to break through the French between the sixth and seventh ships from the rear, but was unable to reach this gap and instead sailed between the fifth and sixth, raking the sixth ship [[French ship Eole (1789)|''Eole'']] from close range. ''Bellerophon'' and [[Lord Hugh Seymour]] in ''Leviathan'' followed close behind the flagship. Both battleships attempted to cut between the subsequent French ships; ''Bellerophon'' successfully, ''Leviathan'' prevented by damage to her helm.<ref name=\"WJ137\">James, p. 137</ref> This manoeuvre changed the course of the battle, as Howe's ships isolated and raked the [[French ship Terrible (1779)|''Terrible'']], [[French ship Tyrannicide (1793)|''Tyrannicide'']], and [[French ship Indomptable (1789)|''Indomptable'']], forcing Villaret to either abandon his ships or sacrifice the weather gage to save them.<ref name=\"WJ138\"/>\n\nAs Howe pressed after the main body of the French fleet\u2014now tailed by the damaged ''Terrible''\u2014the rest of his fleet followed, bombarding the already battered ''Tyrannicide'' and ''Indomptable'' as they passed.<ref name=\"NT101\"/> As [[HMS Orion (1787)|HMS ''Orion'']], [[HMS Invincible (1765)|HMS ''Invincible'']], and [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS ''Barfleur'']] cut through the French in turn, Villaret [[Jibe (sailing)|wore]] his fleet round to face Howe. Encouraged by ''Caesar's'' disobedience, he deliberately sacrificed the weather gage in the belief that Howe's fleet was more damaged than it appeared.<ref name=\"WJ138\"/> All of Villaret's ships followed him except ''Montagnard'', which refused to turn, claiming to be seriously damaged.<ref name=\"WJ143\"/> Villaret's manoeuvre soon isolated the ''Queen Charlotte'', ''Bellerophon'', and ''Leviathan'', which were forced to retreat hastily before the main French force.  Having driven away the ships threatening ''Indomptable'' and ''Tyrannicide'', Villaret reformed his fleet and attempted to escape westwards, closely followed by the British van who were now holding the weather gage. Both fleets were too damaged to continue action in the remaining daylight and firing stopped at 17:00.<ref name=\"PP16\">Padfield, p. 16</ref> The British fleet has suffered 67 killed and 128 wounded during the day's fighting.<ref name=\"NM138\"/>\n\nEvening found the fleets approximately {{convert|10|nmi|km}} apart, sailing northwest. Both were conducting hasty repairs and attempting to ready themselves for what all assumed would be another day of battle on 30 May. Significantly, Lord Howe was unaware that to the northeast, over the same sea as the previous day's action had been fought, the ponderous convoy of merchant ships was passing, having successfully evaded British pursuit.<ref name=\"WJ172\">James, p. 172</ref> Unlike his opponent Villaret knew the location of the convoy, which was joined that evening by the battered ''Montagnard''. Escorting the convoy, Admiral Nielly had been apprised of the situation by ''Montagnard''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s captain, and had left his escort duties to reinforce Villaret.<ref name=\"WJ145\">James, p. 145</ref>\n\nIn a postscript to the day's action the British frigate ''Castor'', captured early in the campaign by Nielly, was attacked and retaken by the smaller [[HMS Carysfort (1766)|HMS ''Carysfort'']] under Captain [[Francis Laforey]] at the [[frigate action of 29 May 1794]]. Some of the crew were released by their rescuers but most, including the officers, were not aboard, having been taken onto Nielly's flagship [[French ship Sans Pareil (1793)|''Sans Pareil'']].<ref name=\"ODNBTroubridge\"/>\n\n==Between the actions==\nOn the morning of 30 May, Howe sent a signal to all his captains asking if they considered their ships ready for combat. All but ''Caesar'' replied in the affirmative and Howe pushed his ships after the retreating French.<ref name=\"NM139\">Mostert, p. 139</ref> Despite holding the weather gage, Howe's pursuit was soon hampered by descending fog, and unable to see or come to grips with the enemy throughout the whole day, the admiral feared he may have lost his opportunity for battle. However, by 31 May the fog had cleared and the French were still within sight to the north.<ref name=\"NT101\">Tracy, p. 101, ''Proceedings of His Majesty's Ship the Orion''</ref> To the surprise of the British, none of the 26 battleships in the French fleet appeared to show battle damage, whereas many of the British ships were nursing damaged rigging and battered hulls.<ref name=\"WJ146\">James, p. 146</ref> Villaret had made use of the fog to reorganise his force, losing ''Montagnard'' and the frigate [[French ship Seine|''Seine'']] to the convoy but gaining the independently sailing battleship [[French ship Mont Blanc (1791)|''Trente-un-Mai'']] and Nielly's squadron of ''Sans Pareil'', [[French ship Trajan (1792)|''Trajan'']], and [[French ship T\u00e9m\u00e9raire (1782)|''T\u00e9m\u00e9raire'']].<ref name=\"WJ145\"/> Villaret had also dispatched the battered ''Indomptable'' for home, escorted by an undamaged French ship.<ref>British sources have listed this ship as [[French ship Mont Blanc|''Mont Blanc'']], (James, p. 145) but in fact the ship originally named ''Mont Blanc'' had been renamed ''Trente-un-Mai'' by June 1794, and the French fleet did not possess another vessel of this name at this time. Thus, the identity of the ship departing with ''Indomptable'' is unclear, although it may have been [[French ship Diad\u00e8me (1756)|''Brutus'']], a 42-gun [[razee]].</ref>\n\nThroughout 31 May Howe's fleet closed with the French, making full use of the advantage of the weather gage. By 17:00 the fleets were five miles (9&nbsp;km) apart, but at 19:00 Howe gave orders to keep his ships out of shot range but within easy sailing of the French. He did not want a repeat of the confusion of 29 May and preferred to delay any combat until he was assured of a full day in which to conduct it, in order that his signals not be obscured or misinterpreted.<ref name=\"WJ145\"/> During the night the fleets remained in visual contact, and by first light on 1 June the British were just six miles (11&nbsp;km) from Villaret's fleet and organising in preparation to attack once more.<ref name=\"FJ95\">Jane, p. 95</ref> Both fleets were now sailing in a western direction, Villaret still hoping to draw Howe away from the convoy.\n\n==Glorious First of June==\n{{Location map|North Atlantic|caption=Map of the Atlantic Ocean showing the position of the battle|alt=|relief=|AlternativeMap=|overlay_image=|label=|label_size=|position=|background=|mark=Battle icon (crossed swords).svg|marksize=25|coordinates={{Coord|47|24|0|N|17|27|0|W}}}}\n[[File:Vengeur du Peuple-Prairial.png|thumb|The sinking of the ''Vengeur du Peuple'',<br />engraving by P. Ozanne]]\n{{details|Glorious First of June}}\nAt 09:24 on the morning of 1 June, Howe sent his ships into action using the original tactic of turning each ship in his line northwest simultaneously, so that they would bear down individually on Villaret's fleet and each break the enemy line separately. His intention was to cut the French line in 25 places, raking the enemy vessels at both bow and stern and dividing their fire so they could be defeated piecemeal. Ultimately though this ambitious plan failed, due to ill-discipline among Howe's subordinates and the damage his fleet had sustained over the previous week.<ref name=\"JP153\">James, p. 153</ref> While six of Howe's ships did break the French line as ordered, and several others came close, many of his captains failed to follow orders and instead engaged the enemy from a distance in desultory gun duels which had little effect.<ref name=\"NR430\">Rodger, p. 430</ref>\n\nAs various British and French ships broke off into personal duels and some latecoming British ships struggled to get into action, Villaret led his flagship [[French ship Ocean (1790)|''Montagne'']] to the north and began assembling a coherent counter-force from those of his fleet which had escaped Howe's assault.<ref name=\"JP166\">James, p. 166</ref>  In the melee itself several very hard-fought engagements took place\u2014particularly that between [[HMS Brunswick (1790)|HMS ''Brunswick'']] and [[French ship Vengeur du Peuple|''Vengeur du Peuple'']]. At least twelve ships were dismasted, with the British battleships HMS ''Marlborough'' and [[HMS Defence (1763)|HMS ''Defence'']] losing all three masts and ten French vessels suffering similarly.<ref name=\"JP152\">James, p. 152</ref>\n\nBy 11:30 the initial action was dying down, and Villaret brought his reconstituted force back towards the battle site to contest ownership of the dismasted hulks floating there. Howe likewise reformed his main force and met Villaret, who failed to capture any of the battered British ships but did regather six of his own, leaving Howe with seven prizes.<ref name=\"FJ96\">Jane, p. 96</ref> Of these, the wrecked ''Vengeur'' soon sank, although British boats had removed many of her crew.<ref name=\"JP164\">James, p. 164</ref>  Howe was left in possession of the battle site, but Villaret had successfully held off the British long enough for the convoy to pass to the east unmolested. Both fleets returned to their home ports over the next week.<ref name=\"JP170\">James, p. 170</ref>\n\n==The convoy arrives==\nWhile searching for the convoy during the first week of June, Montagu's squadron became trapped between two French squadrons and was forced to sail southwards to avoid Villaret's returning fleet. As a result, the French Atlantic seaboard was clear of British forces for a significant period.<ref name=\"JP171\">James, p. 171</ref> The food convoy arrived safely in France in the third week of June, and Montagu returned to Britain empty-handed. Both nations claimed victory in the campaign; the British by virtue of success in the only major action, and the French through the intact arrival of their convoy.<ref name=\"RG15\">Gardiner, p. 15</ref>\n\nThe campaign had notable effects on the navies of both Britain and France. The French did not directly contest British supremacy in Northern European waters again, spending most of the next 23 years in Brest and other ports, their few major sallies mainly directed at the [[Mediterranean]]. Continued upheavals in the French Navy resulted in a decline of quality in its officer corps, so that by the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] 11 years later the port-bound nature of the French fleet had resulted in a cautious and inexperienced tactical outlook.<ref name=\"PP163\">Padfield, p. 163</ref> In Britain, the battle created a division within the Royal Navy's officer corps. Howe's dispatch after the battle criticised some officers who he believed had hesitated in action, and those officers received none of the honours distributed at the end of the campaign. Fallout from this dispute was widespread, with several senior figures resigning in disgust.<ref name=\"ODNBCald\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4383 Caldwell, Sir Benjamin], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', J.K.

As long as Villaret held the weather gage, Howe was unable to attack him as he wished and instead had to be on the defensive while simultaneously attempting to force Villaret to give up his advantage. Villaret could have used the weather gage to attack Howe at any time, but did not do so in order to buy time for the convoy to pass the British fleet.</li>\n</ol>\n{{refend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Gardiner\n | first = Robert\n | year = 2001\n | origyear= reprint of 1996\n | chapter = The Glorious First of June\n | title = Fleet Battle and Blockade\n | publisher = Caxton Editions\n | isbn = 1-84067-363-X\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Ireland\n | first = Bernard\n | year = 2000\n | origyear=\n | chapter =\n | title = Naval Warfare in the Age of Sail\n | publisher = Harper Collins\n | isbn = 0-00-414522-4\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = James\n | first = William\n | authorlink = William James (naval historian)\n | year = 2002\n | origyear = reprint of 1827\n | chapter =\n | title = The Naval History of Great Britain, Volume 1, 1793\u20131796\n | publisher = Conway Maritime Press\n | isbn = 0-85177-905-0\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Jane\n | first = Fred T.\n | authorlink = Fred T.

The campaign involved [[commerce raiding]] by detached forces and two minor engagements, eventually culminating in the full fleet action of the [[Glorious First of June]] 1794, at which both fleets were badly mauled and both Britain and France claimed victory. The French lost seven battleships; the British none, but the battle distracted the British fleet long enough for the French convoy to safely reach port.\n\nBy the spring of 1794, the [[First French Republic|French Republic]], under the rule of the [[National Convention]], was at [[French Revolutionary Wars|war with all its neighbours]]. With [[famine]] imminent, the French [[Committee of Public Safety]] looked to France's colonies and the United States to provide an infusion of grain; this was to be convoyed across the [[Atlantic]] during April, May and June, accompanied by a small escort squadron and supported by a second, larger squadron in the [[Bay of Biscay]]. However, political upheaval had severely reduced the [[French Navy]]'s ability to fight coherently and supply shortages had devastated its morale, significantly weakening the fleet. Britain, by contrast, was at a high state of readiness with a well-organised command structure, but was suffering from a severe shortage of trained seamen with which to man its large navy. The French Atlantic Fleet, under Admiral [[Villaret de Joyeuse]], was tasked with keeping the British Channel Fleet occupied long enough for the convoy to reach France safely. The Channel Fleet, commanded by [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]], knew of the convoy's passage, and dispatched squadrons to protect British commerce while pursuing Villaret himself with the main body of the Royal Navy's Channel Fleet. For over a week the two battlefleets manoeuvred around one another, Villaret drawing Howe deeper westwards into the Atlantic and away from the convoy. Two partial but inconclusive fleet actions on 28 and 29 May followed, during which Howe seized the [[weather gage]] from Villaret, granting him freedom to choose the time and place of his next attack.\n\nThe culminating action of the campaign took place over {{convert|400|nmi|km}} into the Atlantic, and became known as the Glorious First of June. This final engagement saw Howe use the weather gage to attack Villaret directly while his opponent attempted to fight in a traditional [[line of battle]] formation. In the battle, the British fleet inflicted a heavy defeat on the French after a bitterly contested day of fighting. Forcing Villaret to retreat, Howe's force captured seven French battleships, one of which later sank, and inflicted 7,000 casualties on the enemy. Villaret however, claimed strategic success as his delaying tactics had bought enough time for the convoy to reach France safely. The battle was the first in a series of defeats the French Navy suffered during the early years of the war, which bred a defeatist attitude and an unwillingness among the French officer corps to engage the British at sea.\n\n==Background==\nIn the winter of 1793, war and internal disorder had combined with poor weather to leave France facing starvation following the collapse of the harvest.<ref>Williams, p. 381.</ref> France's ongoing [[French Revolutionary Wars|conflict]] with her neighbours precluded overland imports; the only nation willing and able to sell grain to the [[National Convention]] was the United States. Importing food from the Americas was a highly risky venture, as the British [[Royal Navy]]\u2014at war with France since early 1793\u2014patrolled much of the Atlantic passage. To provide effective protection for the vessels involved, a plan was agreed between France and the United States to collect the supplies over a period of months and transport them in a single convoy. A gathering point was arranged at [[Hampton Roads]] in the [[Chesapeake Bay]].<ref name=\"NT89\">Tracy, p. 89</ref>\n\nA squadron commanded by Admiral [[Pierre Vanstabel]] was dispatched to Hampton Roads to provide escort. Vanstabel would bring the convoy to the Bay of Biscay, where a second squadron under [[Joseph-Marie Nielly]] would reinforce him for the rest of the journey.<ref name=\"BI128\"/> Together, these officers mustered six [[ships of the line]] and numerous smaller craft.<ref name=\"WJ127\">James, p. 127</ref> The main French battlefleet of 25 ships under Admiral [[Villaret de Joyeuse]] would cruise the Bay of Biscay in order to challenge the British Channel Fleet if it attempted to intercept the supplies. The convoy's passage was expected to take approximately two months, and it included 117 [[cargo ship|merchant ships]] carrying enough food to feed France for a year.<ref name=\"WJ127\"/>\n\n[[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]], admiral of the British Channel Fleet, was aware of the convoy's nature and destination long before it left the Chesapeake, and made preparations to block its passage. Sending several small squadrons to protect British commerce crossing the Bay of Biscay, Howe detailed Admiral [[George Montagu (Royal Navy officer)|George Montagu]] with six battleships to search for the convoy in the south of the Bay while Howe took the main body of the fleet, 26 ships of the line, to patrol near Brest.<ref name=\"WJ125\">James, p. 125</ref>\n\n==May 1794==\n{{see also|Order of battle at the Glorious First of June}}\nApril 1794 was a month of fevered activity on both sides of the [[English Channel]] as Villaret and Howe made their final preparations for the coming campaign. The slow French convoy had departed American waters on 2 April, and British convoys destined for the [[British Empire|Empire]] had sailed from Portsmouth on 2 May. Howe used his whole force to provide them with protection as far as the [[Western Approaches]], and on 5 May sent the [[frigates]] [[HMS Latona (1781)|HMS ''Latona'']] and [[HMS Phaeton (1782)|HMS ''Phaeton'']] close in to Brest to ascertain the status of the French\u2014they reported that Villaret's battlefleet was still in harbour.<ref name=\"WJ126\">James, p. 126</ref>\n\n===Commerce raiding===\nOut in the Atlantic, the detached squadrons of Nielly (French) and Montagu (British) were [[commerce raiding]] against enemy merchant shipping, but had thus far failed to find the main food convoy. Nielly encountered a British convoy from Newfoundland and took ten ships as [[Prize (law)|prizes]]\u2014including the convoy escort, the 32-gun [[frigate]] [[HMS Castor (1785)|HMS ''Castor'']].<ref name=\"BI128\">Ireland, p. 128</ref> [[Thomas Troubridge]], captain of the ''Castor'', would spend the entire campaign aboard Nielly's flagship [[French ship Sans Pareil (1793)|''Sans Pareil'']].<ref name=\"ODNBTroubridge\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27765?docPos=3 Troubridge, Sir Thomas], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', P.K. Crimmin, retrieved 23 December 2007</ref> Montagu also met with some success on 15 May, recapturing the merchant ships Nielly had taken, along with the French corvette ''Marie-Guiton'' and accurate intelligence on the direction and size of the French convoy which Montagu immediately passed to Howe.<ref name=\"NM134\">Mostert, p. 134</ref> Resuming his patrol in the Mid-Atlantic, Nielly found the convoy from America a few days later, and transferred two of his ships to Vanstabel's escort to augment the convoy's defences. He then returned to the Eastern Atlantic to look for signs of British activity which might pose a threat to its passage.<ref name=\"WJ128\"/> He also dispatched frigates to Villaret, carrying information about the convoy's location and speed.\n\nWhile Nielly and Montagu searched out at sea, Howe took his fleet on a series of cruises back and forth across the Bay of Biscay in the hope of catching the convoy. Between 5 and 18 May he found nothing and so returned to Brest, where his scouting frigates reported that the French battlefleet had gone.<ref name=\"WJ127\" />  Taking advantage of dense fog, Villaret had sailed the previous day, his ships passing within earshot of the British fleet.<ref name=\"WJ128\"/> The French admiral was on the trail of Nielly's squadron; his intention was to meet both Nielly and the convoy and combine forces; with superior numbers he would then be able to escort the convoy to France in safety. Having eluded Howe and still some days from his planned rendezvous, Villaret gained an unexpected success when he ran across a Dutch convoy of 53 vessels. Its escorts, [[Dutch ship Alliance|''Alliance'']] and [[Dutch ship Waakzaamheid|''Waakzaamheid'']], fled at the sight of the approaching French fleet, and Villaret was free to attack the convoy, capturing 20 [[cargo ship|merchantmen]].<ref name=\"WJ128\">James, p. 128</ref>\n\n===Howe's pursuit===\nHowe realised that the direction of Villaret's departure would take him directly across Admiral Montagu's planned route, and that, should Montagu meet Villaret, the British squadron would be destroyed.<ref name=\"WJ129\">James, p. 129</ref> Setting all sail in pursuit, Howe followed Villaret into the Atlantic on 20 May. The next day Howe's ships recaptured ten of the lost Dutch merchantmen, but he was forced to burn them since crewing them with British sailors would weaken his own already understrength fleet.<ref name=\"NM135\">Mostert, p. 135</ref> Prisoners from these ships gave Howe the information that the French fleet was only a short distance ahead, but that it had been joined by an additional ship from Nielly's squadron as well as several frigates.<ref name=\"BI128\"/> By now satisfied that Montagu was safely to the southwest, Howe pressed on hoped to bring Villaret to battle within the week. On 23 May however, the British fleet was driven southwards by strong winds and had to slowly work its way north to find the French track again. The detour did however enable him to recapture and destroy four more of Villaret's Dutch prizes.<ref name=\"WJ129\"/>\n\nOn the morning of 25 May Howe's pursuit finally bore fruit, when his scouting frigates spotted a lone French ship of the line at 04:00. This ship sighted Howe's force at the same time, and immediately made off in the direction of the French fleet. The fleeing battleship left behind an American merchant ship she had been towing, which when taken reported that the French ship was [[French ship Audacieux (1784)|''Audacieux'']], of Nielly's squadron.<ref name=\"WJ130\">James, p. 130</ref> Pursuing ''Audacieux'' after burning the American prize, the British fleet also overran and burnt two French corvettes, the 20-gun ''R\u00e9publicaine'' and 16-gun ''Inconnue''.<ref name=\"RG27\">Gardiner, p. 27</ref> Continuing his chase over the next three days, on 28 May Howe's lookouts spotted the French on the eastern horizon slightly to the south, indicating that the French held the weather gage.<sup>[[#notea|[Note A]]]</sup><ref name=\"RG28\">Gardiner, p. 28</ref>\n\n==28 May==\n[[File:Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe - Project Gutenberg eText 18314.jpg|thumb|upright|Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe;<br />mezzotint engraving by R. Dunkarton, after the painting by [[John Singleton Copley]]]]\nWith his enemy visible from the deck of his flagship by 06:30, Howe recalled his frigates and ordered his fleet to press on all sail in the hope of engaging the rear of the scattered French line.<ref name=\"WJ130\" /> By 10:35 Howe's continued pursuit was making his own battleline ragged, but he pressed on in the belief that Villaret intended to use the weather gage to outrun him and escape. To counter this, Howe ordered his fastest ships into a flying squadron under Admiral [[Thomas Pasley]].<ref name=\"FJ94\">Jane, p. 94</ref> This squadron was significantly faster than the majority of the vessels in either fleet and rapidly closed with the French rear. The first shots of the engagement were fired at 14:30 by [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS ''Russell'']], commanded by [[John Willett Payne]], which managed some long-distance fire at the rearmost French ships on the opposite tack. Fire was returned by the French but without significant effect.<ref name=\"NT96\">Tracy, p. 96, ''Biographical Memoir of Rear-Admiral John Willett Payne''</ref> In an attempt to hold off Pasley's squadron, at 17:00 the French [[first rate]] 110-gun [[French ship Bretagne (1766)|''R\u00e9volutionnaire'']] exchanged places with the smaller [[third rate]]s at the rear of the line and engaged the pursuing British van.<ref name=\"BI128\"/> This manoeuvre was apparently conducted on the initiative of Captain Vandangel of ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' without orders from Admiral Villaret or his political observer [[Jean Bon Saint-Andr\u00e9]].<ref name=\"WJ131\">James, p. 131</ref>\n\nThrough a sharp and skilful tack, [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS ''Bellerophon'']], one of the slowest ships in the British van, succeeded in bringing the ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' to steady action at 18:00. The ships exchanged fire for twenty minutes, the weaker ''Bellerophon'' taking severe damage to her rigging, and falling back to be replaced by [[HMS Marlborough (1767)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] under Captain [[George Cranfield Berkeley]].<ref name=\"NT100\">Tracy, p. 100, ''Proceedings of His Majesty's Ship the Orion''</ref> ''Marlborough'' was joined by HMS ''Russell'' and [[HMS Thunderer (1783)|HMS ''Thunderer'']], and between them they shot away much of the ''R\u00e9volutionnaire's'' rigging, so that by 19:30 she was unmanageable.<ref name=\"NT97\">Tracy, p. 97, ''The Biographical Memoirs of the Right Honourable Lord Gardner''</ref> [[HMS Leviathan (1790)|HMS ''Leviathan'']] also joined the action, firing at an unidentified ship ahead of ''R\u00e9volutionnaire''.<ref name=\"WJ132\">James, p. 132</ref> Concerned about Pasley's squadron becoming cut off from the main body of his fleet, Howe recalled them to the British line at 20:00. All complied except the newly arrived [[HMS Audacious (1785)|HMS ''Audacious'']] under Captain [[Sir William Parker, 1st Baronet, of Harburn|William Parker]]. ''Audacious'' had engaged ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' so closely that she could not safely withdraw, and although her gunnery eventually dismasted her huge opponent, ''Audacious'' took severe damage.<ref name=\"FJ94\"/>\n\nIt was not until 22:00 that ''Audacious'' and ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' disentangled themselves and limped apart\u2014their respective fleets now some way off.<ref name=\"WJ132\"/> ''Audacious's'' crew later claimed that ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' had struck her colours during the engagement, although this has not been corroborated.<ref name=\"WJ132\" />  Parker stated that he did not take possession of ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' because he was concerned by the distant sighting of nine French battleships on the horizon. He had spotted a squadron under Commodore [[Jean-Joseph Castagnier]], which was uninvolved in the current campaign and which soon disappeared without participating in any of the subsequent engagements.<ref name=\"WJ133\"/> ''Audacious's'' crew made strenuous efforts to repair their ship and rejoin the British fleet during the night, but became disorientated and in the morning ''Audacious'' was still only half a mile from her former opponent.<ref name=\"WJ133\"/>\n\n''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' had suffered much more severely than ''Audacious'', but survived the encounter without being boarded thanks to a misread signal by Captain [[Sir Albemarle Bertie, 1st Baronet|Albemarle Bertie]] of ''Thunderer'', who failed to take possession of the dismasted three-decker when ordered to.<ref name=\"WJ133\"/> During the night Villaret sent reinforcements to rescue ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'', and at dawn on 29 May Parker saw that his large opponent was soon to be supported by the undamaged ship of the line ''Audacieux'', the frigate [[French frigate Bellone (1778)|''Bellone'']], and two corvettes. Once more ''Audacious'' came under fire from ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'', leaving her no option but to flee this superior force.<ref name=\"WJ133\">James, p. 133</ref> ''Audacious'' was chased for half an hour by ''Bellone'' and the corvettes, before losing them in a rain squall, and eventually returned to [[Plymouth]] on 3 June. ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' also escaped pursuit and was taken under tow by ''Audacieux'', who brought her safely to [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] several days later.<ref name=\"RG28\"/> For leaving the battlefleet before the main engagement, ''R\u00e9volutionnaire''{{'}}s captain was subsequently arrested.<ref name=\"BI128\"/>\n\n==29 May==\n[[File:Louis-Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse, vice-amiral (1750-1812).jpg|thumb|upright|Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse, 1839 painting by [[Jean-Baptiste Paulin Gu\u00e9rin|Gu\u00e9rin]]]]\nWith ''Audacious'' and ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' lost in the dark behind them, both British and French fleets continued westwards towards the convoy rendezvous. At dawn on 29 May the British fleet saw ''Audacieux'' retiring to the east but did not follow, concentrating on the main French line with the hope of provoking a decisive engagement.<ref name=\"WJ134\">James, p. 134</ref> Howe ordered his ships to pursue the enemy rear, and the British line was placed on a tack that was intended to cut through the French line and isolate and capture the ships east of the cut. Captain [[Anthony James Pye Molloy|Anthony Molloy]] in [[HMS Caesar (1793)|HMS ''Caesar'']] was chosen to lead the attack as his ship was the fastest in the fleet, but the manoeuvre was a complete failure due to the inexplicable refusal of Molloy to close with the enemy.<ref name=\"NM137\">Mostert, p. 137</ref> Instead, ''Caesar'' and [[HMS Queen (1769)|HMS ''Queen'']] opened fire on the rearmost French ships from a distance.<ref name=\"NT96\"/> The vans of the opposing fleets then engaged in a long-range broadside duel from 10:00.

Once more ''Caesar'' was to lead the way, with the intention of splitting the enemy fleet in half.<ref name=\"WJ135\">James, p. 135</ref> Captain Molloy then refused to carry out the order, signalling without cause that ''Caesar'' was unable to tack and then turning and sailing eastwards down the outside of the British fleet, rather than towards the enemy.<ref name=\"WJ138\">James, p. 138</ref> This unexpected move threw the following ships into a state of confusion; ''Queen'', coming behind ''Caesar'', attempted to obey Howe's signal alone but was badly damaged by shot, and her captain [[John Hutt (Royal Navy officer)|John Hutt]] mortally wounded.<ref name=\"ODNBHutt\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14295 Hutt, John], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[J.

''Bellerophon'' and [[Lord Hugh Seymour]] in ''Leviathan'' followed close behind the flagship. Both battleships attempted to cut between the subsequent French ships; ''Bellerophon'' successfully, ''Leviathan'' prevented by damage to her helm.<ref name=\"WJ137\">James, p. 137</ref> This manoeuvre changed the course of the battle, as Howe's ships isolated and raked the [[French ship Terrible (1779)|''Terrible'']], [[French ship Tyrannicide (1793)|''Tyrannicide'']], and [[French ship Indomptable (1789)|''Indomptable'']], forcing Villaret to either abandon his ships or sacrifice the weather gage to save them.<ref name=\"WJ138\"/>\n\nAs Howe pressed after the main body of the French fleet\u2014now tailed by the damaged ''Terrible''\u2014the rest of his fleet followed, bombarding the already battered ''Tyrannicide'' and ''Indomptable'' as they passed.<ref name=\"NT101\"/> As [[HMS Orion (1787)|HMS ''Orion'']], [[HMS Invincible (1765)|HMS ''Invincible'']], and [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS ''Barfleur'']] cut through the French in turn, Villaret [[Jibe (sailing)|wore]] his fleet round to face Howe. Encouraged by ''Caesar's'' disobedience, he deliberately sacrificed the weather gage in the belief that Howe's fleet was more damaged than it appeared.<ref name=\"WJ138\"/> All of Villaret's ships followed him except ''Montagnard'', which refused to turn, claiming to be seriously damaged.<ref name=\"WJ143\"/> Villaret's manoeuvre soon isolated the ''Queen Charlotte'', ''Bellerophon'', and ''Leviathan'', which were forced to retreat hastily before the main French force.  Having driven away the ships threatening ''Indomptable'' and ''Tyrannicide'', Villaret reformed his fleet and attempted to escape westwards, closely followed by the British van who were now holding the weather gage. Both fleets were too damaged to continue action in the remaining daylight and firing stopped at 17:00.<ref name=\"PP16\">Padfield, p. 16</ref> The British fleet has suffered 67 killed and 128 wounded during the day's fighting.<ref name=\"NM138\"/>\n\nEvening found the fleets approximately {{convert|10|nmi|km}} apart, sailing northwest. Both were conducting hasty repairs and attempting to ready themselves for what all assumed would be another day of battle on 30 May. Significantly, Lord Howe was unaware that to the northeast, over the same sea as the previous day's action had been fought, the ponderous convoy of merchant ships was passing, having successfully evaded British pursuit.<ref name=\"WJ172\">James, p. 172</ref> Unlike his opponent Villaret knew the location of the convoy, which was joined that evening by the battered ''Montagnard''. Escorting the convoy, Admiral Nielly had been apprised of the situation by ''Montagnard''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s captain, and had left his escort duties to reinforce Villaret.<ref name=\"WJ145\">James, p. 145</ref>\n\nIn a postscript to the day's action the British frigate ''Castor'', captured early in the campaign by Nielly, was attacked and retaken by the smaller [[HMS Carysfort (1766)|HMS ''Carysfort'']] under Captain [[Francis Laforey]] at the [[frigate action of 29 May 1794]]. Some of the crew were released by their rescuers but most, including the officers, were not aboard, having been taken onto Nielly's flagship [[French ship Sans Pareil (1793)|''Sans Pareil'']].<ref name=\"ODNBTroubridge\"/>\n\n==Between the actions==\nOn the morning of 30 May, Howe sent a signal to all his captains asking if they considered their ships ready for combat. All but ''Caesar'' replied in the affirmative and Howe pushed his ships after the retreating French.<ref name=\"NM139\">Mostert, p. 139</ref> Despite holding the weather gage, Howe's pursuit was soon hampered by descending fog, and unable to see or come to grips with the enemy throughout the whole day, the admiral feared he may have lost his opportunity for battle. However, by 31 May the fog had cleared and the French were still within sight to the north.<ref name=\"NT101\">Tracy, p. 101, ''Proceedings of His Majesty's Ship the Orion''</ref> To the surprise of the British, none of the 26 battleships in the French fleet appeared to show battle damage, whereas many of the British ships were nursing damaged rigging and battered hulls.<ref name=\"WJ146\">James, p. 146</ref> Villaret had made use of the fog to reorganise his force, losing ''Montagnard'' and the frigate [[French ship Seine|''Seine'']] to the convoy but gaining the independently sailing battleship [[French ship Mont Blanc (1791)|''Trente-un-Mai'']] and Nielly's squadron of ''Sans Pareil'', [[French ship Trajan (1792)|''Trajan'']], and [[French ship T\u00e9m\u00e9raire (1782)|''T\u00e9m\u00e9raire'']].<ref name=\"WJ145\"/> Villaret had also dispatched the battered ''Indomptable'' for home, escorted by an undamaged French ship.<ref>British sources have listed this ship as [[French ship Mont Blanc|''Mont Blanc'']], (James, p. 145) but in fact the ship originally named ''Mont Blanc'' had been renamed ''Trente-un-Mai'' by June 1794, and the French fleet did not possess another vessel of this name at this time. Thus, the identity of the ship departing with ''Indomptable'' is unclear, although it may have been [[French ship Diad\u00e8me (1756)|''Brutus'']], a 42-gun [[razee]].</ref>\n\nThroughout 31 May Howe's fleet closed with the French, making full use of the advantage of the weather gage. By 17:00 the fleets were five miles (9&nbsp;km) apart, but at 19:00 Howe gave orders to keep his ships out of shot range but within easy sailing of the French. He did not want a repeat of the confusion of 29 May and preferred to delay any combat until he was assured of a full day in which to conduct it, in order that his signals not be obscured or misinterpreted.<ref name=\"WJ145\"/> During the night the fleets remained in visual contact, and by first light on 1 June the British were just six miles (11&nbsp;km) from Villaret's fleet and organising in preparation to attack once more.<ref name=\"FJ95\">Jane, p. 95</ref> Both fleets were now sailing in a western direction, Villaret still hoping to draw Howe away from the convoy.\n\n==Glorious First of June==\n{{Location map|North Atlantic|caption=Map of the Atlantic Ocean showing the position of the battle|alt=|relief=|AlternativeMap=|overlay_image=|label=|label_size=|position=|background=|mark=Battle icon (crossed swords).svg|marksize=25|coordinates={{Coord|47|24|0|N|17|27|0|W}}}}\n[[File:Vengeur du Peuple-Prairial.png|thumb|The sinking of the ''Vengeur du Peuple'',<br />engraving by P. Ozanne]]\n{{details|Glorious First of June}}\nAt 09:24 on the morning of 1 June, Howe sent his ships into action using the original tactic of turning each ship in his line northwest simultaneously, so that they would bear down individually on Villaret's fleet and each break the enemy line separately. His intention was to cut the French line in 25 places, raking the enemy vessels at both bow and stern and dividing their fire so they could be defeated piecemeal. Ultimately though this ambitious plan failed, due to ill-discipline among Howe's subordinates and the damage his fleet had sustained over the previous week.<ref name=\"JP153\">James, p. 153</ref> While six of Howe's ships did break the French line as ordered, and several others came close, many of his captains failed to follow orders and instead engaged the enemy from a distance in desultory gun duels which had little effect.<ref name=\"NR430\">Rodger, p. 430</ref>\n\nAs various British and French ships broke off into personal duels and some latecoming British ships struggled to get into action, Villaret led his flagship [[French ship Ocean (1790)|''Montagne'']] to the north and began assembling a coherent counter-force from those of his fleet which had escaped Howe's assault.<ref name=\"JP166\">James, p. 166</ref>  In the melee itself several very hard-fought engagements took place\u2014particularly that between [[HMS Brunswick (1790)|HMS ''Brunswick'']] and [[French ship Vengeur du Peuple|''Vengeur du Peuple'']]. At least twelve ships were dismasted, with the British battleships HMS ''Marlborough'' and [[HMS Defence (1763)|HMS ''Defence'']] losing all three masts and ten French vessels suffering similarly.<ref name=\"JP152\">James, p. 152</ref>\n\nBy 11:30 the initial action was dying down, and Villaret brought his reconstituted force back towards the battle site to contest ownership of the dismasted hulks floating there. Howe likewise reformed his main force and met Villaret, who failed to capture any of the battered British ships but did regather six of his own, leaving Howe with seven prizes.<ref name=\"FJ96\">Jane, p. 96</ref> Of these, the wrecked ''Vengeur'' soon sank, although British boats had removed many of her crew.<ref name=\"JP164\">James, p. 164</ref>  Howe was left in possession of the battle site, but Villaret had successfully held off the British long enough for the convoy to pass to the east unmolested. Both fleets returned to their home ports over the next week.<ref name=\"JP170\">James, p. 170</ref>\n\n==The convoy arrives==\nWhile searching for the convoy during the first week of June, Montagu's squadron became trapped between two French squadrons and was forced to sail southwards to avoid Villaret's returning fleet. As a result, the French Atlantic seaboard was clear of British forces for a significant period.<ref name=\"JP171\">James, p. 171</ref> The food convoy arrived safely in France in the third week of June, and Montagu returned to Britain empty-handed. Both nations claimed victory in the campaign; the British by virtue of success in the only major action, and the French through the intact arrival of their convoy.<ref name=\"RG15\">Gardiner, p. 15</ref>\n\nThe campaign had notable effects on the navies of both Britain and France. The French did not directly contest British supremacy in Northern European waters again, spending most of the next 23 years in Brest and other ports, their few major sallies mainly directed at the [[Mediterranean]]. Continued upheavals in the French Navy resulted in a decline of quality in its officer corps, so that by the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] 11 years later the port-bound nature of the French fleet had resulted in a cautious and inexperienced tactical outlook.<ref name=\"PP163\">Padfield, p. 163</ref> In Britain, the battle created a division within the Royal Navy's officer corps. Howe's dispatch after the battle criticised some officers who he believed had hesitated in action, and those officers received none of the honours distributed at the end of the campaign. Fallout from this dispute was widespread, with several senior figures resigning in disgust.<ref name=\"ODNBCald\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4383 Caldwell, Sir Benjamin], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', J.K.

As long as Villaret held the weather gage, Howe was unable to attack him as he wished and instead had to be on the defensive while simultaneously attempting to force Villaret to give up his advantage.

Due to the hydrostatic pressure of the transporting medium, the pressure inside the column increases along the ''z'' axis (see figure). Initially, the balloon is inflated by the working fluid at temperature ''T''<sub>C</sub> and pressure ''P''<sub>0</sub> and located on top of the column. A thermogravitational cycle is decomposed into four ideal steps:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Aouane|first=Kamel|last2=Sandre|first2=Olivier|last3=Ford|first3=Ian J.|last4=Elson|first4=Tim P.|last5=Nightingale|first5=Chris|date=2018|title=Thermogravitational Cycles: Theoretical Framework and Example of an Electric Thermogravitational Generator Based on Balloon Inflation/Deflation|url=https://www.mdpi.com/2411-5134/3/4/79|journal=Inventions|language=en|volume=3|issue=4|pages=79|doi=10.3390/inventions3040079|via=}}</ref>\n\n* 1->2: Descent of the balloon towards the bottom of the column. The working fluid undergoes [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic compression]] with its temperature increasing and its pressure reaching value ''P''<sub>h</sub> at the bottom (''P''<sub>h</sub>>''P''<sub>0</sub>).\n\n* 2->3: While the ballon lays at the bottom, the working fluid receives heat from the hot source at temperature ''T''<sub>H</sub> and undergoes [[Isobaric process|isobaric expansion]] at pressure ''P''<sub>h</sub>.\n\n* 3->4: The balloon rises towards the column top. The working fluid undergoes [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic expansion]] with a drop in temperature and reaches pressure ''P''<sub>0</sub> after expansion when the balloon is on top.\n\n* 4->1: Once arrived on top, the working fluid supplies heat to the cold source at temperature ''T''<sub>C</sub> while undergoing [[Isobaric process|isobaric compression]] at pressure ''P''<sub>0</sub>.\n\nFor a thermogravitational cycle to occur, the balloon has to be denser than the transporting medium during 1->2 step and less dense during 3->4 step. If these conditions are not naturally satisfied by the working fluid, a weight can be attached to the balloon to increase its effective mass density.\n\n== Applications and examples ==\n\n[[File:Thermogravitational_electric_generator.gif|thumb|403x403px|Thermogravitational electric generator based on balloon inflation/deflation<ref name=\":0\" />. A balloon filled with perfluorohexane inflates and deflates due to density changes via heat exchanges. Each time the magnet attached to the balloon passes through the coil, an electrical signal is recorded on the oscilloscope.]]\n\nAn experimental device working according to thermogravitational cycle principle was developed in a laboratory of the [[University of Bordeaux]] and patented in France.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/FR3020729A1/en|title=Thermogravitation device for generating electricity|last=Aouane|first=Kamel|last2=Sandre|first2=Olivier|date=2014-04-30|website=FR3020729 A1 as on Google Patents|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Such thermogravitational electric generator is based on inflation and deflation cycles of an elastic bag made of nitrile elastomer cut from a glove finger.<ref name=\":0\" /> The bag is filled with a volatile [[working fluid]] that has low chemical affinity for the elastomer such as [[perfluorohexane]] (C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>14</sub>). It is attached to a strong [[Neodymium magnet|NdFeB spherical magnet]] that acts both as a weight and for transducing the mechanical energy into voltage. The glass cylinder is filled with water acting as transporting fluid. It is heated at the bottom by a hot circulating water-jacket, and cooled down at the top by a cold water bath. Due to its low boiling point temperature (56\u00b0C), the [[perfluorohexane]] drop contained in the bag vaporizes and inflates the balloon. Once its density is lower than the water density, the balloon raises according to [[Archimedes\u2019 principle]]. Cooled down at the column top, the balloon deflates partially until its gets effectively denser than water and starts to fall down. As seen from the videos, the cyclic motion has a period of several seconds. These oscillations can last for several hours and their duration is limited only by leaks of the working fluid through the rubbery membrane. Each time the magnet goes through the coil produces a variation in the [[magnetic flux]]. An [[electromotive force]] is created and detected through an oscilloscope. It has been estimated that the average power of this machine is 7 \u03bcW and its efficiency is 4.8 x 10<sup>-6</sup><ref name=\":0\" />. Although these values are very small, this experiment brings a proof of principle of renewable energy device for harvesting electricity from a weak waste heat source without need of other external energy supply, e.g. for a compressor in a regular [[heat engine]]. The experiment was successfully reproduced by undergraduate students in preparatory classes of the [[Lyc\u00e9e Hoche]] in Versailles.\n[[File:Manipe Elsa et Jean-Baptiste2.gif|left|thumb|Thermogravitational cycle experiment performed by Elsa Giraudat and Jean-Baptiste Hubert (while undergraduate students at the Lyc\u00e9e Hoche, Versailles, France) for their personal project in physics. The fluid was perfluoropentane ([[Perflenapent|C<sub>5</sub>F<sub>12</sub>]]) in their case, and the cold source was made by ice blocks floating on the water column. Numerical integration of the electromotive force gave a harvested energy of 192 \u00b5J per cycle.]]\n\nSeveral other applications based on the thermogravitational cycles could be found in the literature.

Due to the hydrostatic pressure of the transporting medium, the pressure inside the column increases along the ''z'' axis (see figure). Initially, the balloon is inflated by the working fluid at temperature ''T''<sub>C</sub> and pressure ''P''<sub>0</sub> and located on top of the column. A thermogravitational cycle is decomposed into four ideal steps:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Aouane|first=Kamel|last2=Sandre|first2=Olivier|last3=Ford|first3=Ian J.|last4=Elson|first4=Tim P.|last5=Nightingale|first5=Chris|date=2018|title=Thermogravitational Cycles: Theoretical Framework and Example of an Electric Thermogravitational Generator Based on Balloon Inflation/Deflation|url=https://www.mdpi.com/2411-5134/3/4/79|journal=Inventions|language=en|volume=3|issue=4|pages=79|doi=10.3390/inventions3040079|via=}}</ref>\n\n* 1->2: Descent of the balloon towards the bottom of the column. The working fluid undergoes [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic compression]] with its temperature increasing and its pressure reaching value ''P''<sub>h</sub> at the bottom (''P''<sub>h</sub>>''P''<sub>0</sub>).\n\n* 2->3: While the ballon lays at the bottom, the working fluid receives heat from the hot source at temperature ''T''<sub>H</sub> and undergoes [[Isobaric process|isobaric expansion]] at pressure ''P''<sub>h</sub>.\n\n* 3->4: The balloon rises towards the column top. The working fluid undergoes [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic expansion]] with a drop in temperature and reaches pressure ''P''<sub>0</sub> after expansion when the balloon is on top.\n\n* 4->1: Once arrived on top, the working fluid supplies heat to the cold source at temperature ''T''<sub>C</sub> while undergoing [[Isobaric process|isobaric compression]] at pressure ''P''<sub>0</sub>.\n\nFor a thermogravitational cycle to occur, the balloon has to be denser than the transporting medium during 1->2 step and less dense during 3->4 step. If these conditions are not naturally satisfied by the working fluid, a weight can be attached to the balloon to increase its effective mass density.\n\n== Applications and examples ==\n\n[[File:Thermogravitational_electric_generator.gif|thumb|403x403px|Thermogravitational electric generator based on balloon inflation/deflation<ref name=\":0\" />. A balloon filled with perfluorohexane inflates and deflates due to density changes via heat exchanges. Each time the magnet attached to the balloon passes through the coil, an electrical signal is recorded on the oscilloscope.]]\n\nAn experimental device working according to thermogravitational cycle principle was developed in a laboratory of the [[University of Bordeaux]] and patented in France.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/FR3020729A1/en|title=Thermogravitation device for generating electricity|last=Aouane|first=Kamel|last2=Sandre|first2=Olivier|date=2014-04-30|website=FR3020729 A1 as on Google Patents|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Such thermogravitational electric generator is based on inflation and deflation cycles of an elastic bag made of nitrile elastomer cut from a glove finger.<ref name=\":0\" /> The bag is filled with a volatile [[working fluid]] that has low chemical affinity for the elastomer such as [[perfluorohexane]] (C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>14</sub>). It is attached to a strong [[Neodymium magnet|NdFeB spherical magnet]] that acts both as a weight and for transducing the mechanical energy into voltage. The glass cylinder is filled with water acting as transporting fluid. It is heated at the bottom by a hot circulating water-jacket, and cooled down at the top by a cold water bath. Due to its low boiling point temperature (56\u00b0C), the [[perfluorohexane]] drop contained in the poach vaporizes and inflates the balloon. Once its density is lower than the water density, the balloon raises according to [[Archimedes\u2019 principle]]. Cooled down at the column top, the balloon deflates partially until its gets effectively denser than water and starts to fall down. As seen from the videos, the cyclic motion has a period of several seconds. These oscillations can last for several hours and their duration is limited only by leaks of the working fluid through the rubbery membrane. Each time the magnet goes through the coil produces a variation in the [[magnetic flux]]. An [[electromotive force]] is created and detected through an oscilloscope. It has been estimated that the average power of this machine is 7 \u03bcW and its efficiency is 4.8 x 10<sup>-6</sup><ref name=\":0\" />. Although these values are very small, this experiment brings a proof of principle of renewable energy device for harvesting electricity from a weak waste heat source without need of other external energy supply, e.g. for a compressor in a regular [[heat engine]]. The experiment was successfully reproduced by undergraduate students in preparatory classes of the [[Lyc\u00e9e Hoche]] in Versailles.\n[[File:Manipe Elsa et Jean-Baptiste2.gif|left|thumb|Thermogravitational cycle experiment performed by Elsa Giraudat and Jean-Baptiste Hubert (while undergraduate students at the Lyc\u00e9e Hoche, Versailles, France) for their personal project in physics. The fluid was perfluoropentane ([[Perflenapent|C<sub>5</sub>F<sub>12</sub>]]) in their case, and the cold source was made by ice blocks floating on the water column. Numerical integration of the electromotive force gave a harvested energy of 192 \u00b5J per cycle.]]\n\nSeveral other applications based on the thermogravitational cycles could be found in the literature.

She asks for help from Officer Paul Larkin, a rookie cop who is unable to tell her anything about the incident, due to both protocol and a lack of knowledge of the incident, telling her that he has to wait for Lieutenant John Stokes, the AM shift liaison officer. Soon, her estranged husband, FBI agent Scott Connor, arrives at the station and demands to know where Jamal is.\n\nLarkin is able to tell Scott that Jamal and two other black men were pulled over by police but is unable to tell them anything further, other than the fact that Jamal's car had a provocative bumper sticker about violence against cops. This revelation devolves into a long argument between Kendra and Scott, where the two confront their tumultuous marriage and their experiences raising a biracial son in a privileged community. Kendra repeatedly brings up how Jamal feels depressed and isolated as one of the very few black men at his school (referring to himself as \"the face of the race\"), while Scott says that Jamal should have known better than to present himself like \"a gangster.\" \n\nLarkin returns and says that Jamal was with two black friends, one of whom has a warrant for misdemeanor drug possession. After this discovery, Kendra and Scott engage in a lengthy, contentious discussion about Jamal growing up in an environment of racial tension, specifically pertaining to Kendra's own experiences as a black woman and her fears of a possible confrontation between Jamal and police. Scott says that Jamal should not have been hanging out with these men in the first place, prompting Kendra to reveal that Jamal was angry at Scott for leaving him, which is why he placed the bumper sticker on his car. Scott then receives a video from his brother, which shows a recording of the traffic stop Jamal was involved in. In it, a police officer fires at a fleeing suspect as a bystander records it.\n\nThe video sends Scott over the edge, physically threatening Larkin to know where his son is. At this time, Lieutenant Stokes arrives and places Scott under arrest after Scott shoves him. After booking Scott, Stokes tells Kendra that three black males were taken into custody in connection with the traffic stop, unable to tell if one of them was Jamal. After Scott is released after being given a \"promise to appear\" court order, Kendra reveals that Jamal left the house after an argument with her.\n\nStokes is able to obtain a full report of the incident: Bell, Rolle, and Jamal were driving around in Liberty City, where Bell (who was driving the car) stopped to purchase a nickel bag of marijuana. Rodney Banks, a black police officer, witnessed the exchange and stopped the car. After both Bell and Rolle exited the vehicle to confront Banks, Bell fled after Banks had trained his gun on both men. Banks proceeded to fire three shots at Bell. One of the bullets (it is unknown if it was a stray shot or ricochet) accidentally hits Jamal in the head, which kills him instantly. Kendra and Scott are devastated, and Stokes gives them a moment, but they can only wail in agony.  In the final scene, Scott exclaims \"I can't breathe! I can't breathe!\" in allusion to the killing of Eric Garner. \n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kerry Washington]] as Kendra Ellis-Connor\n* [[Steven Pasquale]] as Scott Connor\n* [[Jeremy Jordan (actor, born 1984)|Jeremy Jordan]] as Officer Paul Larkin\n* [[Eugene Lee (actor)|Eugene Lee]] as Lieutenant John Stokes\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received negative reviews due to its \"heavy handed\" nature and dealings on the subject of race.

She asks for help from Officer Paul Larkin, a rookie cop who is unable to tell her anything about the incident, due to both protocol and a lack of knowledge of the incident, telling her that he has to wait for Lieutenant John Stokes, the AM shift liaison officer. Soon, her estranged husband, FBI agent Scott Connor, arrives at the station and demands to know where Jamal is.\n\nLarkin is able to tell Scott that Jamal and two other black men were pulled over by police but is unable to tell them anything further, other than the fact that Jamal's car had a provocative bumper sticker about violence against cops. This revelation devolves into a long argument between Kendra and Scott, where the two confront their tumultuous marriage and their experiences raising a biracial son in a privileged community. Kendra repeatedly brings up how Jamal feels depressed and isolated as one of the very few black men at his school (referring to himself as \"the face of the race\"), while Scott says that Jamal should have known better than to present himself like \"a gangster.\" \n\nLarkin returns and says that Jamal was with two black friends, one of whom has a warrant for misdemeanor drug possession. After this discovery, Kendra and Scott engage in a lengthy, contentious discussion about Jamal growing up in an environment of racial tension, specifically pertaining to Kendra's own experiences as a black woman and her fears of a possible confrontation between Jamal and police. Scott says that Jamal should not have been hanging out with these men in the first place, prompting Kendra to reveal that Jamal was angry at Scott for leaving him, which is why he placed the bumper sticker on his car. Scott then receives a video from his brother, which shows a recording of the traffic stop Jamal was involved in. In it, a police officer fires at a fleeing suspect as a bystander records it.\n\nThe video sends Scott over the edge, physically threatening Larkin to know where his son is. At this time, Lieutenant Stokes arrives and places Scott under arrest after Scott shoves him. After booking Scott, Stokes tells Kendra that three black males were taken into custody in connection with the traffic stop, unable to tell if one of them was Jamal. After Scott is released after being given a \"promise to appear\" court order, Kendra reveals that Jamal left the house after an argument with her.\n\nStokes is able to obtain a full report of the incident: Bell, Rolle, and Jamal were driving around in Liberty City, where Bell (who was driving the car) stopped to purchase a nickel bag of marijuana. Rodney Banks, a black police officer, witnessed the exchange and stopped the car. After both Bell and Rolle exited the vehicle to confront Banks, Bell fled after Banks had trained his gun on both men. Banks proceeded to fire three shots at Bell. One of the bullets (it is unknown if it was a stray shot or ricochet) accidentally hits Jamal in the head, which kills him instantly. Kendra and Scott are devastated, and Stokes gives them a moment, but they can only wail in agony.  In the final scene, Scott exclaims \"I can't breathe! I can't breathe!\" in allusion to the killing of Eric Garner. \n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kerry Washington]] as Kendra Ellis-Connor\n* [[Steven Pasquale]] as Scott Connor\n* [[Jeremy Jordan (actor, born 1984)|Jeremy Jordan]] as Officer Paul Larkin\n* [[Eugene Lee (actor)|Eugene Lee]] as Lieutenant John Stokes\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received negative reviews due to it's \"heavy handed\" nature and dealings on the subject of race.
