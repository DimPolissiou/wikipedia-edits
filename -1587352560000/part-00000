This larger fire was seen as far away as Indiana, and caused approximately $6 million worth of damages.  While only one watchman was killed, a few cattle also perished, but the yards were in business the following Sunday evening.\n\n===Workers and unions===\nFollowing the opening of the new Union Stockyards on December 25, 1865, a community of workers began living in the area just west of the packing plants between Ashland Avenue and South Robey Street and bounded on the north by 43rd Street and on the south by 47th Street.<ref name=\"Jeanette Swist p. 2\"/>  At first, the residents were overwhelmingly Irish and German\u201460% Irish and 30% German.<ref>Robert A. Slayton, ''Back of the Yards: The Making of a Local Democracy'', p. 21.</ref>  Officially designated the \"Town of Lake\" until its incorporation into the City of Chicago in about 1870, the neighborhood was known locally as \"Packingtown.\"<ref name=\"Rick Halpern 1997 p. 10\"/>  However, much later in the 1930s, the community would become known as the \"Back of the Yards.\"\n\nThe overwhelming sensation about the neighborhood was the smell of the community caused not just by the packing plants located immediately to the east, but also by the 345-acre Chicago Union Stock Yards containing 2,300 pens of livestock, located further east from the packing plants.<ref>J'Nell L. Pate, ''Livestock Hotels: America's Historic Stockyards'', pp. 77-78.</ref>\n\n===Back of the Yards Community===\nSettlement in the area that was to become known as the \"Back of the Yards\" began in the 1850s before there were any meat packers or stockyards in the area.  At this time the area was known as the \"Town of Lake.\"  Indeed, the area would continue to be called Town of Lake until 1939.  Witness that the newspaper of the area was called the ''Town of Lake Journal''.  Only with the founding of the community organization called the \"Back of the Yards Neighborhood Council\" in 1939 did the neighborhood west and south of the meat packinghouses start being called the \"Back of the Yards.\"  It was a name that the residents proudly claimed as their own.  In 1939, the ''Town of Lake Journal'' officially changed its name to ''Back of the Yards Journal''.<ref>Robert A. Slayton, ''Back of the Yards: The Making of a Local Democracy'' (University of Chicago Press: Chicago, 1986), p. 97.</ref>\n\nPioneers to the area first called \"Town of Lake\" were S. S. Crocker and John Caffrey.  Indeed, Crocker earned the nickname \"Father of the Town of Lake.\"<ref name=\"Robert A. Slayton p. 16\"/>  By February 1865 the area was incorporated officially as \"Town of Lake\" the area still consisted of fewer than 700 persons.  In the early 1860s the meat packing industry of the United States was still located in Cincinnati, Ohio, the original \"Porkopolis\" of the pre-Civil War era.<ref>J'Nell L. Pate, ''Livestock Hotels: America's Historic Stockyards'', p. 63.</ref>  However, with the end of the American Civil War, the meat packing industry had started to move westward along with the westward migration of the population of the United States.  For the meat packing industry moving west meant coming to Chicago.  As early as 1827, Archibauld Clybourn had established himself as a butcher in a log slaughter house on the north branch of the Chicago River and supplied most to the garrison of Fort Dearborn.  Other small butchers came later.  In 1848, the [[Bull's Head Stockyard]] began operations at Madison Street and Ogden Avenue on the [[West Side, Chicago|West Side]] of Chicago.  Operations for this early stockyard, however, still meant holding and feeding cattle and hogs in transit to meat packing plants further east\u2014Indianapolis<ref>J'Nell L. Pate, ''Livestock Hotels: America's Historic Stockyards'', p. 96.</ref>  and, of course, Cincinnati.\n\n==Decline and current use==\n[[Image:Union Stock Yards, 1866. (CHS ICHi-06898).jpg|thumb|150px|right|The Union Stock Yards Livestock Pens, 1880]]\nThe prosperity of the stockyards was due to both the concentration of railroads and the evolution of [[Refrigerator car|refrigerated railroad car]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/99.html|accessdate=March 9, 2007|title=Back of the Yards|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|year=2005|author=Barrett, James R.}}</ref> Its decline was due to further advances in post-[[World War II]] transportation and distribution. Direct sales of livestock from breeders to packers, facilitated by advancement in interstate [[truck driver|trucking]], made it cheaper to slaughter animals where they were raised and excluded the intermediary stockyards.<ref name=\"EoCUSY\" /><ref name=USYTC /> At first, the major meatpacking companies resisted change, but Swift and Armour both surrendered and vacated their plants in the Yards in the 1950s.<ref name=USYTC />\n\nIn 1971, the area bounded by Pershing Road, Ashland, Halsted, and 47th Street became [[The Stockyards Industrial Park]]. The neighborhood to the west and south of the industrial park is still known as [[Back of the Yards]], and is still home to a thriving immigrant population.\n\n===Gate===\n{{main|Union Stock Yard Gate}}\n[[Image:Union Stock Yard Gate.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Union Stock Yard Gate|Entry to the Union Stock Yards]]]]\nA remnant of the [[Union Stock Yard Gate]] still arches over Exchange Avenue, next to the firefighters' memorial, and can be seen by those driving along Halsted Street. This [[limestone]] gate, marking the entrance to the stockyards, survives as one of the few relics of Chicago's [[cultural heritage|heritage]] of livestock and meatpacking.

This larger fire was seen as far away as Indiana, and caused approximately $6 million worth of damages.  While only one watchman was killed, a few cattle also perished, but the yards were in business the following Sunday evening.\n\n===Workers and unions===\nFollowing the opening of the new Union Stockyards on December 25, 1865, a community of workers began living in the area just west of the packing plants between Ashland Avenue and South Robey Street and bounded on the north by 43rd Street and on the south by 47th Street.<ref name=\"Jeanette Swist p. 2\"/>  At first, the residents were overwhelmingly Irish and German\u201460% Irish and 30% German.<ref>Robert A. Slayton, ''Back of the Yards: The Making of a Local Democracy'', p. 21.</ref>  Officially designated the \"Town of Lake\" until its incorporation into the City of Chicago in about 1870, the neighborhood was known locally as \"Packingtown.\"<ref name=\"Rick Halpern 1997 p. 10\"/>  However, much later in the 1930s, the community would become known as the \"Back of the Yards.\"\n\nThe overwhelming sensation about the neighborhood was the smell of the community caused not just by the packing plants located immediately to the east, but also by the 345-acre Chicago Union Stock Yards containing 2,300 pens of livestock, located further east from the packing plants.<ref>J'Nell L. Pate, ''Livestock Hotels: America's Historic Stockyards'', pp. 77-78.</ref>\n\n===Back of the Yards Community===\nSettlement in the area that was to become known as the \"Back of the Yards\" began in the 1850s before there were any meat packers or stockyards in the area.  At this time the area was known as the \"Town of Lake.\"  Indeed, the area would continue to be called Town of Lake until 1939.  Witness that the newspaper of the area was called the ''Town of Lake Journal''.  Only with the founding of the community organization called the \"Back of the Yards Neighborhood Council\" in 1939 did the neighborhood west and south of the meat packinghouses start being called the \"Back of the Yards.\"  It was a name that the residents proudly claimed as their own.  In 1939, the ''Town of Lake Journal'' officially changed its name to ''Back of the Yards Journal''.<ref>Robert A. Slayton, ''Back of the Yards: The Making of a Local Democracy'' (University of Chicago Press: Chicago, 1986), p. 97.</ref>\n\nPioneers to the area first called \"Town of Lake\" were S. S. Crocker and John Caffrey.  Indeed, Crocker earned the nickname \"Father of the Town of Lake.\"<ref name=\"Robert A. Slayton p. 16\"/>  By February 1865 the area was incorporated officially as \"Town of Lake\" the area still consisted of fewer than 700 persons.  In the early 1860s the meat packing industry of the United States was still located in Cincinnati, Ohio, the original \"Porkopolis\" of the pre-Civil War era.<ref>J'Nell L. Pate, ''Livestock Hotels: America's Historic Stockyards'', p. 63.</ref>  However, with the end of the American Civil War, the meat packing industry had started to move westward along with the westward migration of the population of the United States.  For the meat packing industry moving west meant coming to Chicago.  As early as 1827, Archibauld Clybourn had established himself as a butcher in a log slaughter house on the north branch of the Chicago River and supplied most to the garrison of Fort Dearborn.  Other small butchers came later.  In 1848, the [[Bull's Head Stockyard]] began operations at Madison Street and Ogden Avenue on the [[West Side, Chicago|West Side]] of Chicago.  Operations for this early stockyard, however, still meant holding and feeding cattle and hogs in transit to meat packing plants further east\u2014Indianapolis<ref>J'Nell L. Pate, ''Livestock Hotels: America's Historic Stockyards'', p. 96.</ref>  and, of course, Cincinnati.\n\n==Decline and current use==\n[[Image:Union Stock Yards, 1866. (CHS ICHi-06898).jpg|thumb|150px|right|The Union Stock Yards Livestock Pens, 1880]]\nThe prosperity of the stockyards was due to both the concentration of railroads and the evolution of [[Refrigerator car|refrigerated railroad car]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/99.html|accessdate=March 9, 2007|title=Back of the Yards|publisher=Chicago Historical Society|year=2005|author=Barrett, James R.}}</ref> Its decline was due to further advances in post-[[World War II]] transportation and distribution. Direct sales of livestock from breeders to packers, facilitated by advancement in interstate [[truck driver|trucking]], made it cheaper to slaughter animals where they were raised and excluded the intermediary stockyards.<ref name=\"EoCUSY\" /><ref name=USYTC /> At first, the major meatpacking companies resisted change, but Swift and Armour both surrendered and vacated their plants in the Yards in the 1950s.<ref name=USYTC />\n\nIn 1971, the area bounded by Pershing Road, Ashland, Halsted, and 47th Street became [[The Stockyards Industrial Park]]. The neighborhood to the west and south of the industrial park is still known as [[Back of the Yards]], and is still home to a thriving immigrant population.\n\n===Gate===\n{{main article|Union Stock Yard Gate}}\n[[Image:Union Stock Yard Gate.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Union Stock Yard Gate|Entry to the Union Stock Yards]]]]\nA remnant of the [[Union Stock Yard Gate]] still arches over Exchange Avenue, next to the firefighters' memorial, and can be seen by those driving along Halsted Street.
