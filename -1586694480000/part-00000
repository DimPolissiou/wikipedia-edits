The eastern end of the bridge is in [[Hayward, California|Hayward]]. It is the longest bridge in California and the 25th [[List of bridges by length|longest in the world by length]]. The bridge is owned by the state of California, and is maintained by [[California Department of Transportation]] (Caltrans), the state highway agency. Further oversight is provided by the [[Bay Area Toll Authority]] (BATA).\n\nThe bridge is part of [[California State Route 92|State Route 92]] (SR&nbsp;92), whose western terminus is at the city of [[Half Moon Bay, California|Half Moon Bay]] on the Pacific coast. It links [[Interstate 880 (California)|Interstate 880]] (I-880) in the East Bay with [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]] (US&nbsp;101) on the peninsula.

Norman Raab was in charge of all the bay bridges. Later it came time to build the San Mateo Bridge. He proposed the San Mateo Bridge to be double deck, one on top, one on bottom, like the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge. He proposed steel trusses. Double deck. The Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, one deck on top, one deck below. Save money according to him. Probably did save some money. Now come to the San Mateo Bridge, he wants to design it just like the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge which he is used to. And then, I think, lots of people objected to the look of this type of bridge. Double deck and steel truss. Allan Temko wrote an article against this. And that caught public attention.  And in his article, he quoted T.Y. Lin. He had consulted me and whatever I said and\u2014then we hit the headlines, so that Governor Brown called a meeting, a public hearing on the bridge design. And came in steel executives, board chairman or president of American Steel Company, et cetera; we all met in a big hall\u2014I cannot remember where in San Francisco. At that meeting the steel people were so powerful, you know! [laughs] They declared it must be a steel bridge. It must be a girder bridge as hinted in Allan Temko's article and then was adopted with the approval of the steel board chairman. I was too young to say anything. I was there but I didn't say anything.  However, I was, a few weeks before that meeting, quoted by Allan Temko as being against this repetition of the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge. And that made me a nonconformist. And also, there was an engineering uproar against me that I shouldn't be speaking something against another engineer. This kind of thing. But Allan Temko was for the critique and he changed it to a girder design. Hence the San Mateo Bridge was designed of the girder type. Among the longest girders in the world. Steel girder, with a main span of 750 feet. It's beautiful, single deck. Much better than Richmond-San Rafael Bridge.  [...] You know who designed the bridge? Allan Temko did! He initiated the whole thing. Without him, this would have been another one like the Richmond-San Rafael, steel truss, double deck. He insisted on a single deck and a girder bridge.--> }}</ref> Raab retired and his successor, E.R. \"Mike\" Foley, was willing to incorporate aesthetic considerations, resulting in the final design.<ref name=CSeim /> The western highrise span features an all-steel superstructure, with an [[orthotropic deck]] over two parallel box girders, following the construction of several smaller test bridges using the same orthotropic deck technology.<ref name=Mangus05>{{cite journal |url = http://www.structuremag.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/F-Orthotropics-Oct-051.pdf |title = California's Orthotropic Steel Bridges |last = Mangus |first = Alfred R. |date = October 2005 |journal = Structure |accessdate = January 15, 2015 |pages = }}</ref> It was the first large-scale use of an orthotropic deck, which reduces weight, and thus seismic loading, although the bridge is expected to receive moderate to major damage following an earthquake.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://bata.mtc.ca.gov/projects/seismic.htm |title = Toll Bridge Seismic Retrofit Program |author = <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line--> |date = September 6, 2013 |publisher = Bay Area Toll Authority |accessdate = January 15, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nMurphy Pacific Marine built the ''Marine Boss'' floating barge-crane in 1966 with a {{convert |500|ST|MT|0|adj=on}} capacity to perform the heavy box girder and deck-section lifts.<ref>{{cite conference |url = http://www.orthotropic-bridge.org/pdffiles/CaliforniaOrthotropicBridgeBusTourOBC2008.pdf |last = Mangus |first = Alfred R. |date = August 30, 2008 |title = California Orthotropic Bridge Bus Tour |conference = Orthotropic Bridge Conference |location = Sacramento, California |accessdate = January 15, 2015 }}</ref> The heavy lift capacity of ''Marine Boss'' enabled Murphy Pacific to raise much longer prefabricated girders than existing barge cranes would have allowed.

Norman Raab was in charge of all the bay bridges. Later it came time to build the San Mateo Bridge. He proposed the San Mateo Bridge to be double deck, one on top, one on bottom, like the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge. He proposed steel trusses. Double deck. The Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, one deck on top, one deck below. Save money according to him. Probably did save some money. Now come to the San Mateo Bridge, he wants to design it just like the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge which he is used to. And then, I think, lots of people objected to the look of this type of bridge. Double deck and steel truss. Allan Temko wrote an article against this. And that caught public attention.  And in his article, he quoted T.Y. Lin. He had consulted me and whatever I said and\u2014then we hit the headlines, so that Governor Brown called a meeting, a public hearing on the bridge design. And came in steel executives, board chairman or president of American Steel Company, et cetera; we all met in a big hall\u2014I cannot remember where in San Francisco. At that meeting the steel people were so powerful, you know! [laughs] They declared it must be a steel bridge. It must be a girder bridge as hinted in Allan Temko's article and then was adopted with the approval of the steel board chairman. I was too young to say anything. I was there but I didn't say anything.  However, I was, a few weeks before that meeting, quoted by Allan Temko as being against this repetition of the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge. And that made me a nonconformist. And also, there was an engineering uproar against me that I shouldn't be speaking something against another engineer. This kind of thing. But Allan Temko was for the critique and he changed it to a girder design. Hence the San Mateo Bridge was designed of the girder type. Among the longest girders in the world. Steel girder, with a main span of 750 feet. It's beautiful, single deck. Much better than Richmond-San Rafael Bridge.  [...] You know who designed the bridge? Allan Temko did! He initiated the whole thing. Without him, this would have been another one like the Richmond-San Rafael, steel truss, double deck. He insisted on a single deck and a girder bridge.--> }}</ref> Raab retired and his successor, E.R. \"Mike\" Foley, was willing to incorporate aesthetic considerations, resulting in the final design.<ref name=CSeim /> The western highrise span features an all-steel superstructure, with an [[orthotropic deck]] over two parallel box girders, following the construction of several smaller test bridges using the same orthotropic deck technology.<ref name=Mangus05>{{cite journal |url = http://www.structuremag.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/F-Orthotropics-Oct-051.pdf |title = California's Orthotropic Steel Bridges |last = Mangus |first = Alfred R. |date = October 2005 |journal = Structure |accessdate = January 15, 2015 |pages = }}</ref> It was the first large-scale use of an orthotropic deck, which reduces weight, and thus seismic loading, although the bridge is expected to receive moderate to major damage following an earthquake.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://bata.mtc.ca.gov/projects/seismic.htm |title = Toll Bridge Seismic Retrofit Program |author = <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line--> |date = September 6, 2013 |publisher = Bay Area Toll Authority |accessdate = January 15, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nMurphy Pacific Marine built the ''Marine Boss'' floating barge-crane in 1966 with a {{convert |500|ST|MT|0|adj=on}} capacity to perform the heavy box girder and deck-section lifts.<ref>{{cite conference |url = http://www.orthotropic-bridge.org/pdffiles/CaliforniaOrthotropicBridgeBusTourOBC2008.pdf |last = Mangus |first = Alfred R. |date = August 30, 2008 |title = California Orthotropic Bridge Bus Tour |conference = Orthotropic Bridge Conference |location = Sacramento, California |accessdate = January 15, 2015 }}</ref> The heavy lift capacity of ''Marine Boss'' enabled Murphy Pacific to raise much longer prefabricated girders than existing barge cranes would have allowed.
