At age 76 in 2006, he became the second-oldest inmate at the time to be executed in the United States since 1976, after [[John B. Nixon]], who was executed in Mississippi in December 2005 at age 77. This record has since been broken by [[Walter Moody]].\n\nPro-death penalty activists cite Allen's actions as a reason to support capital punishment in the United States. He was already serving a life sentence for one murder when he was convicted of organizing the killing of three more people.\n\nWhile in prison, Allen then acknowledged his Native American [[Choctaw]] heritage. He also claimed to be deaf, blind and severely disabled, requiring a wheelchair for mobility. He did not know any [[sign language]] to communicate with hearing people. During his execution, he was able to walk from his wheelchair to the death podium unassisted. In addition, he appeared to be looking straight at his family prior to receiving the first dose of drugs during his lethal injection procedure. Allen had a confirmed advanced case of [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]], and he suffered a perhaps related [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on September 2, 2005. His lawyers declared that \"he presents absolutely no danger at this point, as incapacitated as he is. There's no legitimate state purpose served by executing him. It would be gratuitous punishment.\" They argued that his execution would constitute [[cruel and unusual punishment]] and requested that he be granted [[clemency]] by California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], which was subsequently refused.\n\n==Murder of Mary Sue Kitts==\nIn 1974, Allen plotted the [[burglary]] of Fran's Market, a [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] area [[supermarket]], owned by Ray and Fran Schletewitz, whom Allen had known for years. The plot involved his son, Roger Allen, as well as Ed Savala, Carl Mayfield, and Charles Jones. Mayfield and Jones worked for Clarence Ray Allen in his security guard business as well as part of a burglary enterprise allegedly operated by Allen. As part of the burglary plot against Fran's Market, he arranged for someone to steal a set of door and alarm keys from the market owner's son, Bryon Schletewitz, age 19, while Schletewitz was swimming in Allen's pool. Allen then arranged a date between Schletewitz and Mary Sue Kitts (his son Roger's girlfriend) for the evening, during which time the burglary took place. The burglary netted $500 in cash and $10,000 in money orders from the store's safe. Following the commission of the burglary, Kitts told Bryon Schletewitz that Allen had committed the crime, which she knew as she had helped Allen cash [[money order]]s that had been stolen from the store.<ref name=\"DoubleLife\">\n{{cite news\n |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-01-12/news/17275973_1_san-joaquin-valley-fresno-county-clarence-ray-allen/4\n |title=Double life of a Death Row killer \n |author=Jim Doyle \n |newspaper=[[The San Francisco Chronicle]] \n |date=January 12, 2006 \n}}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSchletewitz confronted Roger Allen, informing him that he had been told of the crime by Kitts, and Roger Allen admitted the crime.

He had also referred to himself as a Mafia hitman and stated that the \"secret witness program\" was useless because a good lawyer could always discover an informant's name and address.

The body has never been found.\n\n==Execution at Fran's Market==\nWhile in [[Folsom Prison]], Allen conspired with fellow inmate [[Billy Ray Hamilton]] to murder the various witnesses who had testified against him, including Bryon Schletewitz. Allen intended to obtain a new trial, where there would be no witnesses to testify to his acts.\n\nAfter Hamilton was [[paroled]] from Folsom Prison, he carried out Allen's orders. On September 5, 1980, Hamilton and his girlfriend, Connie Barbo, went to Fran's Market, east of Fresno, California. Bryon Schletewitz, the son of the market's owner, worked at the market. There, Hamilton murdered Schletewitz and fellow employees Josephine Rocha, 17, and Douglas White, 18, with a [[sawed-off shotgun]] and wounded two other people, Joe Rios and Jack Abbott.<ref name=\"FresnoExecution\">\n{{cite news\n |url=http://www.fresnobee.com/local/story/11697658p-12423869c.html\n |title=Fresno killer Allen put to death; U.S. Supreme Court refuses to intervene in 1980 triple murder\n |author=Bill McEwen, Tim Eberly and John Ellis\n |newspaper=[[The Fresno Bee]]\n |date=January 17, 2006\n}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref> Hamilton shot Schletewitz at near point-blank range in the forehead and then killed Rocha and White after forcing them to lie on the floor of the store.  Rios, also an employee of the market, was shot as well but raised his arm as Hamilton fired on him and this action undoubtedly saved his life.  The other wounded survivor, Abbott, was a neighbor who heard the shotgun blasts, came to the market to investigate, and was also shot by Hamilton.  Abbott returned fire and wounded Hamilton, who escaped from the scene.\n\nFive days after the events at Fran's Market, Hamilton was arrested while attempting to rob a liquor store.  On his person was found a \"hit list\" with the names and addresses of the witnesses who testified against Allen at his trial for Kitts' murder; Bryon Schletewitz was on the list.\n\n==Legal proceedings==\nIn 1980, the [[California Attorney General]] filed charges against Allen and prosecuted the trial in [[Glenn County, California]], due to a change of venue. The trial took place in 1982 and lasted 23 days, and 58 witnesses were called to testify.<ref>''''Allen v. Woodford'', 395 F.3d 979, 989-990'', ''''</ref>  Ultimately, the jury convicted Allen of triple [[murder]] and [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] to murder eight witnesses.\n\nAs special circumstances making Allen eligible for the death penalty, the jury also found that Allen had previously been convicted of murder, had committed multiple murders, and had murdered witnesses in retaliation for their prior testimony and to prevent future testimony.  During a seven-day penalty phase, the Attorney General introduced evidence of Allen's career orchestrating violent robberies in the Central Valley, including ten violent crimes and six prior felony convictions.  The jury returned a unanimous verdict of death, and the Glenn County Superior Court sentenced Allen on November 22, 1980.\n\nIn 1987, the [[California Supreme Court]] affirmed Allen's death sentence. [[Associate Justice]] Joseph Grodin's opinion referred to Allen's crimes as \"sordid events\" with an \"extraordinarily massive amount\" of aggravating evidence.  In a dissenting opinion, California Supreme Court Justice Broussard stated that the prosecutor influenced the jury by telling them that \"if you conclude that aggravating evidence outweighs the [[Mitigating factor|mitigating evidence]], you shall return a death sentence,\" while the law does not mandate a death sentence in such a situation.  According to Justice Broussard, this led to a lack of freedom for the jury to make a \"normative decision.\"\n\nIn 2005, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] found that Allen's trial counsel had been inadequate, and the evidence against him was largely the testimony of Allen's several accomplices, who painted him as the mastermind who forced them by threats and scare tactics to commit robberies and murders.  However the court denied rehearing in Allen's case.  In her opinion for the panel, Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw concluded:\n\n: Evidence of Allen's guilt is overwhelming.  Given the nature of his crimes, sentencing him to another life term would achieve none of the traditional purposes underlying punishment.  Allen continues to pose a threat to society, indeed to those very persons who testified against him in the Fran's Market triple-murder trial here at issue, and has proven that he is beyond rehabilitation.  He has shown himself more than capable of arranging murders from behind bars.  If the death penalty is to serve any purpose at all, it is to prevent the very sort of murderous conduct for which Allen was convicted.\n\nDeputy [[California Attorney General]] Ward Campbell stated in an interview:\n: Well, Mr. Allen has cited his age, the length of time on death row, claims about innocence, errors at his trial.  We found and told the governor we found all those reasons to be unpersuasive given the nature of his crime, which was in fact a direct attack on the criminal justice system perpetrated by a man whom Society thought to be safe from.  They thought they were safe from him because he was behind bars and yet he continued to perpetrate these types of crimes and none of the factors that they cite now overshadow or outbalance those reasons for now executing the judgment of the people of the State of California.\n\nOn January 13, 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger refused to grant Allen [[clemency]], stating that \"his conduct did not result from youth or inexperience, but instead resulted from the hardened and calculating decisions of a mature man.\"  Schwarzenegger also cited a poem in which Allen glorified his actions, where Allen wrote, \"We rob and steal and for those who squeal are usually found dying or dead.\"\n\nOn January 15, 2006, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied Allen's claim that executing an aged or infirm person was cruel and unusual punishment, observing that his mental acuity was unimpaired and that he had been fifty years of age when he arranged the murders from prison.  Judge Kim Wardlaw writing for the panel of judges Susan Graber, Richard Clifton, and herself: \n: His age and experience only sharpened his ability to coldly calculate the execution of the crime.  Nothing about his current ailments reduces his culpability and thus they do not lessen the retributive or deterrent purposes of the death penalty.\n\nThe [[United States Supreme Court]] declined to hear the case, albeit over the dissent of Justice [[Stephen Breyer]], who stated: \"I believe that in the circumstances he raises a significant question as to whether his execution would constitute 'cruel and unusual punishment.'\"\n\n==1983 Chino Hills Murders==\n[[Kevin Cooper (prisoner)|Kevin Cooper]] was convicted of the 1983 murder of a family in the Chino Hills.

Woodford'', 395 F.3d 979, 989-990'', ''''</ref>  Ultimately, the jury convicted Allen of triple [[murder]] and [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] to murder eight witnesses.\n\nAs special circumstances making Allen eligible for the death penalty, the jury also found that Allen had previously been convicted of murder, had committed multiple murders, and had murdered witnesses in retaliation for their prior testimony and to prevent future testimony.  During a seven-day penalty phase, the Attorney General introduced evidence of Allen's career orchestrating violent robberies in the Central Valley, including ten violent crimes and six prior felony convictions.  The jury returned a unanimous verdict of death, and the Glenn County Superior Court sentenced Allen on November 22, 1980.\n\nIn 1987, the [[California Supreme Court]] affirmed Allen's death sentence. [[Associate Justice]] Joseph Grodin's opinion referred to Allen's crimes as \"sordid events\" with an \"extraordinarily massive amount\" of aggravating evidence.  In a dissenting opinion, California Supreme Court Justice Broussard stated that the prosecutor influenced the jury by telling them that \"if you conclude that aggravating evidence outweighs the [[Mitigating factor|mitigating evidence]], you shall return a death sentence,\" while the law does not mandate a death sentence in such a situation.  According to Justice Broussard, this led to a lack of freedom for the jury to make a \"normative decision.\"\n\nIn 2005, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] found that Allen's trial counsel had been inadequate, and the evidence against him was largely the testimony of Allen's several accomplices, who painted him as the mastermind who forced them by threats and scare tactics to commit robberies and murders.  However the court denied rehearing in Allen's case.  In her opinion for the panel, Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw concluded:\n\n: Evidence of Allen's guilt is overwhelming.  Given the nature of his crimes, sentencing him to another life term would achieve none of the traditional purposes underlying punishment.  Allen continues to pose a threat to society, indeed to those very persons who testified against him in the Fran's Market triple-murder trial here at issue, and has proven that he is beyond rehabilitation.  He has shown himself more than capable of arranging murders from behind bars.  If the death penalty is to serve any purpose at all, it is to prevent the very sort of murderous conduct for which Allen was convicted.\n\nDeputy [[California Attorney General]] Ward Campbell stated in an interview:\n: Well, Mr. Allen has cited his age, the length of time on death row, claims about innocence, errors at his trial.  We found and told the governor we found all those reasons to be unpersuasive given the nature of his crime, which was in fact a direct attack on the criminal justice system perpetrated by a man whom Society thought to be safe from.  They thought they were safe from him because he was behind bars and yet he continued to perpetrate these types of crimes and none of the factors that they cite now overshadow or outbalance those reasons for now executing the judgment of the people of the State of California.\n\nOn January 13, 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger refused to grant Allen [[clemency]], stating that \"his conduct did not result from youth or inexperience, but instead resulted from the hardened and calculating decisions of a mature man.\"  Schwarzenegger also cited a poem in which Allen glorified his actions, where Allen wrote, \"We rob and steal and for those who squeal are usually found dying or dead.\"\n\nOn January 15, 2006, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied Allen's claim that executing an aged or infirm person was cruel and unusual punishment, observing that his mental acuity was unimpaired and that he had been fifty years of age when he arranged the murders from prison.  Judge Kim Wardlaw writing for the panel of judges Susan Graber, Richard Clifton, and herself: \n: His age and experience only sharpened his ability to coldly calculate the execution of the crime.  Nothing about his current ailments reduces his culpability and thus they do not lessen the retributive or deterrent purposes of the death penalty.\n\nThe [[United States Supreme Court]] declined to hear the case, albeit over the dissent of Justice [[Stephen Breyer]], who stated: \"I believe that in the circumstances he raises a significant question as to whether his execution would constitute 'cruel and unusual punishment.'\"\n\n==1983 Chino Hills Murders==\n[[Kevin Cooper (prisoner)|Kevin Cooper]] was convicted of the 1983 murder of a family in the Chino Hills.

While the system efficiency of a gas furnace may be higher than the combination of natural gas power plant and electric heat, the combination of the same natural gas power plant and an electric [[heat pump]] has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates. This is possible because of the very high [[coefficient of performance]] of heat pumps.\n\n\nThe economics of switching the demand side from fossil fuels to electricity for heating, will depend on the price of fuels vs electricity and the relative prices of the equipment. Electrifying heating loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in [[demand response]]. Since thermostatically controlled loads have inherent energy storage, electrification of heating could provide a valuable resource to integrate variable renewable resources into the grid.\n\nAlternatives to electrification, include decarbonizing pipeline gas through [[power to gas]], [[biogas]], or other [[carbon-neutral fuels]].\n\nAt the beginning of this century 70% of all electricity was generated by fossil fuels, and as carbon free sources eventually make up half of the generation mix, replacing gas or oil furnaces and water heaters with electric ones will have a climate benefit. In areas like Norway, [[Brazil]], and [[Quebec]] that have abundant hydroelectricity, electric heat and hot water are common.\n\n=====Heat pump=====\n{{Main|Heat pump}}\n[[File:Outunit of heat pump.jpg|thumb|upright|Outside unit of an air-source heat pump]]\nA heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a \"heat sink\". Heat pumps are designed to move [[thermal energy]] opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A heat pump uses some amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink.\n\nWhile [[air conditioner]]s and [[freezer]]s are familiar examples of heat pumps, the term \"heat pump\" is more general and applies to many [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) devices used for space heating or space cooling. When a heat pump is used for heating, it employs the same basic [[heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration-type cycle]] used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator, but in the opposite direction\u2014releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment. In this use, heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground.<ref>[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy01osti/28037.pdf Air-source heat pumps] [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] June 2011</ref> In heating mode, heat pumps are three to four times [[efficient energy use|more efficient]] in their use of electric power than simple electrical resistance heaters.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIt has been concluded that heat pumps are the single technology that could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of households better than every other technology that is available on the market.

For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. \n\nEnergy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily growing [[world energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-400-2005-043/CEC-400-2005-043.PDF |title=Loading Order White Paper |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Energy conservation]] is broader than energy efficiency in that it encompasses reducing demand for a service service, for example through behavioral change, as well as encompassing energy efficiency. Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements would be heating a room less in winter or driving less. As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms. This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels.<ref>Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 87.</ref>\n\nReducing energy use is seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Some of the plans include building pumped storage or continental [[super grid]]s costing billions of dollars. However instead of building for more power, there are a variety of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand on the consumer side. Designing for reduced demands on a smaller power grid is more efficient and economic than having extra generation and transmission for intermittency, power failures and peak demands. Having these abilities is one of the chief aims of a [[smart grid]].\n\n[[Net energy metering#Time of use metering|Time of use]] metering is a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption. For instance, running dishwashers and laundry at night after the peak has passed, reduces electricity costs.\n\n[[Dynamic demand]] plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid. This method may work very well with thermostats, when power on the grid sags a small amount, a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid. For instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations. Consumers need to have a [[smart meter]] in order for the utility to calculate credits.\n\n[[Demand response]] devices can receive all sorts of messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This allows electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day. [[Vehicle-to-grid]] uses a car's battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily.\n\n===Lifestyle and behavior===\n\nThe [[IPCC]] [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|Fifth Assessment Report]] emphasises that behaviour, lifestyle, and cultural change have a high mitigation potential in some sectors, particularly when complementing technological and structural change.<ref name=\"edenhofer-etal-2014\">{{cite book\n|first1= Ottmar | last1= Edenhofer\n|first2= Ram\u00f3n | last2= Pichs-Madruga\n|display-authors= etal\n|editor= IPCC\n|year= 2014\n|title= Climate change 2014: mitigation of climate change.

A variety of means of artificially capturing and storing carbon, as well as of enhancing natural sequestration processes, are being explored. The main natural process is [[photosynthesis]] by plants and single-celled organisms (see [[biosequestration]]). Artificial processes vary, and concerns have been expressed about the long-term effects of some of these processes.<ref name=RoyalSociety>The Royal Society, (2009) [http://royalsociety.org/displaypagedoc.asp?id=35151 \"Geoengineering the climate: science, governance and uncertainty\"].

Personal cars are extremely inefficient at moving passengers, while [[public transport]] and bicycles are many times more efficient (as is the simplest form of human transportation, walking). All of these are encouraged by urban/community planning and are an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Inefficient [[land use]] development practices have increased infrastructure costs as well as the amount of energy needed for transportation, community services, and buildings.\n\nAt the same time, a growing number of citizens and government officials have begun advocating a smarter approach to land use planning. These [[smart growth]] practices include compact community development, multiple transportation choices, mixed land uses, and practices to conserve green space. These programs offer environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits; and they also serve to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nApproaches such as [[New Urbanism]] and [[transit-oriented development]] seek to reduce distances travelled, especially by private vehicles, encourage [[public transit]] and make [[walking]] and [[cycling]] more attractive options. This is achieved through \"medium-density\", [[mixed-use development|mixed-use planning]] and the concentration of housing within walking distance of [[town center]]s and [[transport node]]s.<!--Energy usage comparisons done in the book \"Sustainability and Cities\" by Peter Newman and Jeff Kentworthy.-->\n\nSmarter growth land use policies have both a direct and indirect effect on energy consuming behavior. For example, transportation energy usage, the number one user of petroleum fuels, could be significantly reduced through more compact and mixed use land development patterns, which in turn could be served by a greater variety of non-automotive based transportation choices.\n\n====Building design====\n{{Main|Sustainable architecture|Green building}}\n\nEmissions from [[house|housing]] are substantial,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.est.org.uk/myhome/climatechange/stats/homeenvironment/ |title=Energy Saving Trust: Home and the environment |publisher=[[Energy Saving Trust]] |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> and government-supported energy efficiency programmes can make a difference.<ref>{{cite news\n|last= Osborne\n|first= Hilary\n|title= Energy efficiency 'saves \u00a3350m a year'\n|newspaper= Guardian Unlimited\n|date= 2005-08-02\n|url= http://money.guardian.co.uk/utilities/story/0,11992,1541051,00.html?gusrc=ticker-103704\n|location=London}}</ref>\n\nNew buildings can be constructed using [[passive solar building design]], [[low-energy building]], or [[zero-energy building]] techniques, using [[renewable heat]] sources.

Consumption above basic needs would require countries to buy more emission rights. From this viewpoint, developing countries would need to be at least as well off under an emissions control regime as they would be outside the regime.\n*'''Proportionality and polluter-pays principle''': Proportionality reflects the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] principle that people should receive in proportion to what they put in, and pay in proportion to the damages they cause. This has a potential relationship with the \"polluter-pays principle\", which can be interpreted in a number of ways:\n**''Historical responsibilities'': this asserts that allocation of emission rights should be based on patterns of past emissions. Two-thirds of the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere at present is due to the past actions of developed countries (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;29).<ref name=goldemberg>{{cite book\n|year=1996\n|author=Goldemberg, J.\n|title=Introduction: scope of the assessment.

Ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population, as well as other, more complex measures, like the [[UNDP]]'s [[Human Development Index]].\n**''[[Willingness to pay]]'': with this approach, countries take on emission reductions based on their ability to pay along with how much they benefit{{cn|date=November 2019}} from reducing their emissions.\n\n====Specific proposals====\n*'''Ad hoc''': Lashof (1992) and Cline (1992) (referred to by Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;106),<ref name=banuri/> for example, suggested that allocations based partly on [[GNP]] could be a way of sharing the burdens of emission reductions. This is because GNP and economic activity are partially tied to carbon emissions.\n*'''Equal per capita entitlements''': this is the most widely cited method of distributing abatement costs, and is derived from egalitarianism (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&nbsp;106\u2013107). This approach can be divided into two categories. In the first category, emissions are allocated according to national population. In the second category, emissions are allocated in a way that attempts to account for historical (cumulative) emissions.\n*'''Status quo''': with this approach, historical emissions are ignored, and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;107). An analogy for this approach can be made with [[fishery|fisheries]], which is a common, limited resource. The analogy would be with the atmosphere, which can be viewed as an exhaustible [[natural resource]] (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;27).<ref name=goldemberg/> In [[international law]], one state recognized the long-established use of another state's use of the fisheries resource. It was also recognized by the state that part of the other state's economy was dependent on that resource.\n\n==Governmental and intergovernmental action==\n{{Main|Politics of global warming}}\n{{See also|Global warming#Political response}}\n{{Reduced pull quote|1=right\n|2=Bringing down emissions of greenhouse gases asks a good deal of people, not least that they accept the science of climate change.

These can be targets set by international bodies or voluntary action by individuals or institutions. This is the most important, expensive and least appealing aspect of environmental governance.<ref name=\"Evans\">Evans. J (forthcoming 2012) Environmental Governance, Routledge, Oxon</ref>\n\n====Funding====\n{{main|Climate Finance}}\nFunding, such as the [[Green Climate Fund]], is often provided by nations, groups of nations and increasingly NGO and private sources. These funds are often channelled through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). This is an environmental funding mechanism in the World Bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues.<ref name=\"Evans\"/> The GEF was originally designed to tackle four main areas: biological diversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer depletion, to which [[land degradation]] and [[persistent organic pollutant]] were added. The GEF funds projects that are agreed to achieve global environmental benefits that are endorsed by governments and screened by one of the GEF's implementing agencies.<ref>Mee. L. D, Dublin. H.

The relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation. When information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed, context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier. Institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place, calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes. The Short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues. Statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made. Missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation.<ref name=\"IHDP\">Biesbroek. G.R, Termeer. C.J.A.M, Kabat.

One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM). The [[World Bank]]'s Prototype Carbon Fund<ref>[http://carbonfinance.org/pcf/ Prototype Carbon Fund] from the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit</ref> is a [[public private partnership]] that operates within the CDM.\n\nAn important point of contention, however, is how [[overseas development]] assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation.<ref name=ODI>Jessica Brown, Neil Bird and Liane Schalatek (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4931&title=climate-finance-additionality-definitions-implications Climate finance additionality: emerging definitions and their implications] [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> One of the outcomes of the UNFCC [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] was the [[Copenhagen Accord]], in which developed countries promised to provide US$30&nbsp;million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources.<ref name=ODI/> Yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the [[European Commission]] has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional, and researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have found four main understandings:<ref name=ODI/>\n# Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the [[Millennium Development Goals#Funding commitment|'0.7%' ODA target]];\n# Increase on previous year's [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;\n# Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and\n# Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.\nThe main point being that there is a conflict between the [[OECD]] states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important [[Millennium Development Goals]].<ref name=ODI/>\n\nHowever, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} of mitigation often argue that, the developing countries' drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet.\n\nIn an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies, [[UNEP]] and [[WTO]] urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the [[Doha Development Round|Doha trade round]] \"which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services\".<ref>[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31278&Cr=trade&Cr1=environment# Free trade can help combat global warming, finds UN report] UN News Centre, 26 June 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2019 week of climate action in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] result in a declaration in which leaders says that they will act to reduce emissions in the sectors of transportation, energy, urbanism, industry, forest conservation and land use and \"sent a message of solidarity with all the people of Brazil suffering the consequences of the [[Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|rainforest fires in the Amazon region]], underscoring that protecting the world's forests is a collective responsibility, that forests are vital for life and that they are a critical part of the solution to climate change\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 Key Messages for the UN Climate Action Summit |url=https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/LACCW%202019%20Messages%20for%20UN%20Climate%20Action%20Summit.pdf |website=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Latin American & Caribbean Climate Week Calls for Urgent, Ambitious Action |url=https://unfccc.int/news/latin-american-caribbean-climate-week-calls-for-urgent-ambitious-action |website=United Nations Climate Change |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Non-governmental approaches==\nWhile many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding, legislation and regulatory action, individuals and [[business action on climate change|businesses]] can also play a part in the mitigation effort.\n\n===Choices in personal actions and business operations===\nEnvironmental groups encourage [[individual and political action on climate change|individual action against global warming]], often aimed at the [[consumer]].

While the system efficiency of a gas furnace may be higher than the combination of natural gas power plant and electric heat, the combination of the same natural gas power plant and an electric [[heat pump]] has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates. This is possible because of the very high [[coefficient of performance]] of heat pumps.\n\n\nThe economics of switching the demand side from fossil fuels to electricity for heating, will depend on the price of fuels vs electricity and the relative prices of the equipment. Electrifying heating loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in [[demand response]]. Since thermostatically controlled loads have inherent energy storage, electrification of heating could provide a valuable resource to integrate variable renewable resources into the grid.\n\nAlternatives to electrification, include decarbonizing pipeline gas through [[power to gas]], [[biogas]], or other [[carbon-neutral fuels]].\n\nAt the beginning of this century 70% of all electricity was generated by fossil fuels, and as carbon free sources eventually make up half of the generation mix, replacing gas or oil furnaces and water heaters with electric ones will have a climate benefit. In areas like Norway, [[Brazil]], and [[Quebec]] that have abundant hydroelectricity, electric heat and hot water are common.\n\n=====Heat pump=====\n{{Main|Heat pump}}\n[[File:Outunit of heat pump.jpg|thumb|upright|Outside unit of an air-source heat pump]]\nA heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a \"heat sink\".

A heat pump uses some amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink.\n\nWhile [[air conditioner]]s and [[freezer]]s are familiar examples of heat pumps, the term \"heat pump\" is more general and applies to many [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) devices used for space heating or space cooling. When a heat pump is used for heating, it employs the same basic [[heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration-type cycle]] used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator, but in the opposite direction\u2014releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment. In this use, heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground.<ref>[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy01osti/28037.pdf Air-source heat pumps] [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] June 2011</ref> In heating mode, heat pumps are three to four times [[efficient energy use|more efficient]] in their use of electric power than simple electrical resistance heaters.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIt has been concluded that heat pumps are the single technology that could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of households better than every other technology that is available on the market. With a market share of 30% and (potentially) clean electricity, heat pumps could reduce global {{CO2}} emissions by 8% annually.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Staffell Iain|display-authors=et al |year= 2012 |title= A review of domestic heat pumps |url= |journal= [[Energy and Environmental Science]] |volume= 5 |issue= 11 |pages= 9291\u20139306 |doi= 10.1039/c2ee22653g}}</ref> Using ground source heat pumps could reduce around 60% of the [[primary energy]] demand and 90% of {{CO2}} emissions of natural gas boilers in Europe in 2050 and make handling high shares of renewable energy easier.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Carvalho |display-authors=et al |year= 2015 |title= Ground source heat pump carbon emissions and primary energy reduction potential for heating in buildings in Europe\u2014results of a case study in Portugal |url= |journal= [[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]] |volume= 45 |issue= |pages= 755\u2013768 |doi= 10.1016/j.rser.2015.02.034}}</ref> Using surplus renewable energy in heat pumps is regarded as the most effective household means to reduce global warming and fossil fuel depletion.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Sternberg Andr\u00e9, Bardow Andr\u00e9 |year= 2015 |title= Power-to-What? \u2013 Environmental assessment of energy storage systems |url= |journal= [[Energy and Environmental Science]] |volume= 8 |issue= 2 |pages= 389\u2013400 |doi= 10.1039/c4ee03051f}}</ref>\n\nWith significant amounts of fossil fuel used in electricity production, demands on the electrical grid also generate greenhouse gases. Without a high share{{quantify|date=October 2019}} of low-carbon electricity, a domestic heat pump will produce more carbon emissions than using natural gas.<ref>[http://www.energysolutionscenter.org/assets/1/Page/GHP_Position_Paper_and_apndx_031710.pdf pg 7]</ref>\n\n==Energy conservation==\n\n\n===Energy efficiency===\n{{Main|Efficient energy use|Energy conservation}}Efficient energy use, sometimes simply called \"energy efficiency\", is the goal of efforts to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services. For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. \n\nEnergy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily growing [[world energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-400-2005-043/CEC-400-2005-043.PDF |title=Loading Order White Paper |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Energy conservation]] is broader than energy efficiency in that it encompasses reducing demand for a service service, for example through behavioral change, as well as encompassing energy efficiency. Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements would be heating a room less in winter or driving less. As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms. This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels.<ref>Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 87.</ref>\n\nReducing energy use is seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. According to the [[International Energy Agency]], improved energy efficiency in [[energy-efficient buildings|buildings]], industrial processes and [[sustainable transportation|transportation]] could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sophie Hebden |url=http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&itemid=2929&language=1 |title=Invest in clean technology says IEA report |publisher=Scidev.net |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>\n\n===Smart grid===\n{{Main|Smart grid}}\nExpanding intermittent electrical sources, such as [[wind power]], creates a growing problem balancing grid fluctuations. Some of the plans include building pumped storage or continental [[super grid]]s costing billions of dollars. However instead of building for more power, there are a variety of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand on the consumer side. Designing for reduced demands on a smaller power grid is more efficient and economic than having extra generation and transmission for intermittency, power failures and peak demands. Having these abilities is one of the chief aims of a [[smart grid]].\n\n[[Net energy metering#Time of use metering|Time of use]] metering is a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption. For instance, running dishwashers and laundry at night after the peak has passed, reduces electricity costs.\n\n[[Dynamic demand]] plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid. This method may work very well with thermostats, when power on the grid sags a small amount, a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid. For instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations. Consumers need to have a [[smart meter]] in order for the utility to calculate credits.\n\n[[Demand response]] devices can receive all sorts of messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This allows electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day. [[Vehicle-to-grid]] uses a car's battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily.\n\n===Lifestyle and behavior===\n\nThe [[IPCC]] [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|Fifth Assessment Report]] emphasises that behaviour, lifestyle, and cultural change have a high mitigation potential in some sectors, particularly when complementing technological and structural change.<ref name=\"edenhofer-etal-2014\">{{cite book\n|first1= Ottmar | last1= Edenhofer\n|first2= Ram\u00f3n | last2= Pichs-Madruga\n|display-authors= etal\n|editor= IPCC\n|year= 2014\n|title= Climate change 2014: mitigation of climate change.

Several scientific studies have shown that when relatively rich people wish to reduce their carbon footprint, there are a few key actions they can take such as living [[car-free movement|car-free]] (2.4 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>), avoiding one round-trip transatlantic flight (1.6 tonnes) and eating a [[plant-based diet]] (0.8 tonnes).<ref name=Wynes-Nicholas-2017>{{cite journal |title= The climate mitigation gap: education and government recommendations miss the most effective individual actions |journal= Environmental Research Letters |first1= Seth |last1= Wynes |first2= Kimberly A |last2= Nicholas |date= 12 July 2017 |volume= 12 |page= 074024 |number= 7 |doi= 10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541 |bibcode= 2017ERL....12g4024W}}</ref>\n\nThese appear to differ significantly from the popular advice for \"greening\" one's lifestyle, which seem to fall mostly into the \"low-impact\" category: Replacing a typical car with a hybrid (0.52 tonnes); Washing clothes in cold water (0.25 tonnes); Recycling (0.21 tonnes); Upgrading light bulbs (0.10 tonnes); etc. The researchers found that public discourse on reducing one's carbon footprint overwhelmingly focuses on low-impact behaviors, and that mention of the high-impact behaviors is almost non-existent in the mainstream media, government publications, school textbooks, etc.<ref name=Wynes-Nicholas-2017/><ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2017-05>{{cite journal |last1=Ceballos|first1=Gerardo|last2=Ehrlich|first2=Paul P |last3=Dirzo|first3=Rodolfo|date=23 May 2017|title=Biological annihilation via the ongoing sixth mass extinction signaled by vertebrate population losses and declines|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/07/05/1704949114.full|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|volume=114|issue=30|pages=E6089\u2013E6096|quote=Much less frequently mentioned are, however, the ultimate drivers of those immediate causes of biotic destruction, namely, human overpopulation and continued population growth, and overconsumption, especially by the rich.

For example, transportation energy usage, the number one user of petroleum fuels, could be significantly reduced through more compact and mixed use land development patterns, which in turn could be served by a greater variety of non-automotive based transportation choices.\n\n====Building design====\n{{Main|Sustainable architecture|Green building}}\n\nEmissions from [[house|housing]] are substantial,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.est.org.uk/myhome/climatechange/stats/homeenvironment/ |title=Energy Saving Trust: Home and the environment |publisher=[[Energy Saving Trust]] |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> and government-supported energy efficiency programmes can make a difference.<ref>{{cite news\n|last= Osborne\n|first= Hilary\n|title= Energy efficiency 'saves \u00a3350m a year'\n|newspaper= Guardian Unlimited\n|date= 2005-08-02\n|url= http://money.guardian.co.uk/utilities/story/0,11992,1541051,00.html?gusrc=ticker-103704\n|location=London}}</ref>\n\nNew buildings can be constructed using [[passive solar building design]], [[low-energy building]], or [[zero-energy building]] techniques, using [[renewable heat]] sources.

Consumption above basic needs would require countries to buy more emission rights. From this viewpoint, developing countries would need to be at least as well off under an emissions control regime as they would be outside the regime.\n*'''Proportionality and polluter-pays principle''': Proportionality reflects the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] principle that people should receive in proportion to what they put in, and pay in proportion to the damages they cause. This has a potential relationship with the \"polluter-pays principle\", which can be interpreted in a number of ways:\n**''Historical responsibilities'': this asserts that allocation of emission rights should be based on patterns of past emissions. Two-thirds of the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere at present is due to the past actions of developed countries (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;29).<ref name=goldemberg>{{cite book\n|year=1996\n|author=Goldemberg, J.\n|title=Introduction: scope of the assessment.

Ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population, as well as other, more complex measures, like the [[UNDP]]'s [[Human Development Index]].\n**''[[Willingness to pay]]'': with this approach, countries take on emission reductions based on their ability to pay along with how much they benefit{{cn|date=November 2019}} from reducing their emissions.\n\n====Specific proposals====\n*'''Ad hoc''': Lashof (1992) and Cline (1992) (referred to by Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;106),<ref name=banuri/> for example, suggested that allocations based partly on [[GNP]] could be a way of sharing the burdens of emission reductions. This is because GNP and economic activity are partially tied to carbon emissions.\n*'''Equal per capita entitlements''': this is the most widely cited method of distributing abatement costs, and is derived from egalitarianism (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&nbsp;106\u2013107). This approach can be divided into two categories. In the first category, emissions are allocated according to national population. In the second category, emissions are allocated in a way that attempts to account for historical (cumulative) emissions.\n*'''Status quo''': with this approach, historical emissions are ignored, and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;107). An analogy for this approach can be made with [[fishery|fisheries]], which is a common, limited resource. The analogy would be with the atmosphere, which can be viewed as an exhaustible [[natural resource]] (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;27).<ref name=goldemberg/> In [[international law]], one state recognized the long-established use of another state's use of the fisheries resource.

These can be targets set by international bodies or voluntary action by individuals or institutions. This is the most important, expensive and least appealing aspect of environmental governance.<ref name=\"Evans\">Evans. J (forthcoming 2012) Environmental Governance, Routledge, Oxon</ref>\n\n====Funding====\n{{main|Climate Finance}}\nFunding, such as the [[Green Climate Fund]], is often provided by nations, groups of nations and increasingly NGO and private sources. These funds are often channelled through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). This is an environmental funding mechanism in the World Bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues.<ref name=\"Evans\"/> The GEF was originally designed to tackle four main areas: biological diversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer depletion, to which [[land degradation]] and [[persistent organic pollutant]] were added. The GEF funds projects that are agreed to achieve global environmental benefits that are endorsed by governments and screened by one of the GEF's implementing agencies.<ref>Mee. L. D, Dublin. H.

The relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation. When information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed, context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier. Institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place, calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes. The Short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues. Statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made. Missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation.<ref name=\"IHDP\">Biesbroek. G.R, Termeer. C.J.A.M, Kabat.

One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM). The [[World Bank]]'s Prototype Carbon Fund<ref>[http://carbonfinance.org/pcf/ Prototype Carbon Fund] from the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit</ref> is a [[public private partnership]] that operates within the CDM.\n\nAn important point of contention, however, is how [[overseas development]] assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation.<ref name=ODI>Jessica Brown, Neil Bird and Liane Schalatek (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4931&title=climate-finance-additionality-definitions-implications Climate finance additionality: emerging definitions and their implications] [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> One of the outcomes of the UNFCC [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] was the [[Copenhagen Accord]], in which developed countries promised to provide US$30&nbsp;million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources.<ref name=ODI/> Yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the [[European Commission]] has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional, and researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have found four main understandings:<ref name=ODI/>\n# Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the [[Millennium Development Goals#Funding commitment|'0.7%' ODA target]];\n# Increase on previous year's [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;\n# Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and\n# Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.\nThe main point being that there is a conflict between the [[OECD]] states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important [[Millennium Development Goals]].<ref name=ODI/>\n\nHowever, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} of mitigation often argue that, the developing countries' drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet.\n\nIn an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies, [[UNEP]] and [[WTO]] urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the [[Doha Development Round|Doha trade round]] \"which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services\".<ref>[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31278&Cr=trade&Cr1=environment# Free trade can help combat global warming, finds UN report] UN News Centre, 26 June 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2019 week of climate action in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] result in a declaration in which leaders says that they will act to reduce emissions in the sectors of transportation, energy, urbanism, industry, forest conservation and land use and \"sent a message of solidarity with all the people of Brazil suffering the consequences of the [[Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|rainforest fires in the Amazon region]], underscoring that protecting the world's forests is a collective responsibility, that forests are vital for life and that they are a critical part of the solution to climate change\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 Key Messages for the UN Climate Action Summit |url=https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/LACCW%202019%20Messages%20for%20UN%20Climate%20Action%20Summit.pdf |website=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Latin American & Caribbean Climate Week Calls for Urgent, Ambitious Action |url=https://unfccc.int/news/latin-american-caribbean-climate-week-calls-for-urgent-ambitious-action |website=United Nations Climate Change |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Non-governmental approaches==\nWhile many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding, legislation and regulatory action, individuals and [[business action on climate change|businesses]] can also play a part in the mitigation effort.\n\n===Choices in personal actions and business operations===\nEnvironmental groups encourage [[individual and political action on climate change|individual action against global warming]], often aimed at the [[consumer]].

In most countries, marking or painting property without permission is considered by property owners and civic authorities as defacement and [[vandalism]], which is a punishable crime, citing the use of graffiti by street gangs to mark territory or to serve as an indicator of gang-related activities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/get_informed/content_basic_view/23471|title=Why Gang Graffiti Is Dangerous - Los Angeles Police Department|website=www.lapdonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref> Graffiti has become visualized as a growing urban \u2018problem\u2019 for many cities in industrialized nations, spreading from the [[New York City Subway nomenclature|New York City subway]] system in the early 1970s to the rest of the United States and Europe and other world regions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R.

He started out as a street graffiti artist chased by authorities, and later one of his paintings sold for over $100,000,000.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n[[File:Graffiti signature commemorating Union of Lublin 01.jpg|thumb|1569 scratched graffiti in the [[Chapel of the Holy Trinity, Lublin Castle|Holy Trinity Chapel]] in [[Lublin]], commemorating [[Union of Lublin]]]]\n\nBoth \"graffiti\" and its occasional singular form \"graffito\" are from the Italian word ''graffiato'' (\"scratched\"). \"Graffiti\" is applied in [[art history]] to works of art produced by scratching a design into a surface. A related term is \"[[sgraffito]]\",<ref name=grant/> which involves scratching through one layer of pigment to reveal another beneath it. This technique was primarily used by potters who would glaze their wares and then scratch a design into it. In ancient times graffiti were carved on walls with a sharp object, although sometimes [[chalk]] or [[coal]] were used. The word originates from Greek {{lang|el|\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}}\u2014''graphein''\u2014meaning \"to write\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/graffiti|title=graffiti {{!}} Origin and meaning of graffiti by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Graffitti, Castellania, Malta.jpeg|thumb|left|Figure graffito, similar to a relief, at the Castellania, in Valletta]]\n\nThe term ''graffiti'' referred to the [[inscription]]s, figure drawings, and such, found on the walls of ancient [[sepulchre]]s or ruins, as in the [[Catacombs of Rome]] or at [[Pompeii]]. Use of the word has evolved to include any graphics applied to surfaces in a manner that constitutes [[vandalism]].<ref>{{cite web|title=How Old Is Graffiti?|url=http://wonderopolis.org/wonder/how-old-is-graffiti/|website=Wonderopolis|accessdate=24 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe only known source of the [[Safaitic]] language, a form of proto-Arabic, is from graffiti: inscriptions scratched on to the surface of rocks and boulders in the predominantly basalt desert of southern [[Syria]], eastern [[Jordan]] and northern [[Saudi Arabia]]. Safaitic dates from the first century BC to the fourth century AD.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://krc2.orient.ox.ac.uk/aalc/index.php/en/safaitic-database-online|title=Ancient Arabia: Languages and Cultures - Safaitic Database Online|last=dan|website=krc2.orient.ox.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://krc.orient.ox.ac.uk/ociana/index.php/safaitic|title=The Online Corpus of the Inscriptions of Ancient North Arabia - Safaitic|last=dan|website=krc.orient.ox.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Modern-style graffiti ===\n\nThe first known example of \"modern style\"{{clarify|date=June 2018}} graffiti survives in the ancient Greek city of [[Ephesus]] (in modern-day [[Turkey]]). Local guides say it is an advertisement for [[prostitution]]. Located near a [[mosaic]] and stone walkway, the graffiti shows a handprint that vaguely resembles a heart, along with a footprint, a number, and a carved image of a woman's head.\n\nThe [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] carved graffiti on walls and monuments, examples of which also survive in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. Graffiti in the classical world had different connotations than they carry in today's society concerning content. Ancient graffiti displayed phrases of love declarations, political rhetoric, and simple words of thought, compared to today's popular messages of social and political ideals<ref name=ancel/>\nThe eruption of [[Vesuvius]] preserved graffiti in [[Pompeii]], which includes [[Latin]] curses, magic spells, declarations of love, alphabets, political slogans, and famous literary quotes, providing insight into ancient Roman street life. One inscription gives the address of a woman named Novellia Primigenia of Nuceria, a prostitute, apparently of great beauty, whose services were much in demand. Another shows a [[phallus]] accompanied by the text, ''mansueta tene'' (\"handle with care\").\n\nDisappointed love also found its way onto walls in antiquity:\n\n{{poemquote|\n''Quisquis amat. veniat. Veneri volo frangere costas''\n''fustibus et lumbos debilitare deae.''\n''Si potest illa mihi tenerum pertundere pectus''\n''quit ego non possim caput illae frangere fuste?''\n\nWhoever loves, go to hell.

Etched on the surface of the Mirror Wall, they contain pieces of prose, poetry, and commentary. The majority of these visitors appear to have been from the elite of society: royalty, officials, professions, and clergy. There were also soldiers, archers, and even some metalworkers. The topics range from love to satire, curses, wit, and lament. Many demonstrate a very high level of literacy and a deep appreciation of art and poetry.<ref name=ponnam/> Most of the graffiti refer to the frescoes of semi-nude females found there. One reads:\n\n{{poemquote|Wet with cool dew drops\nfragrant with perfume from the flowers\ncame the gentle breeze\njasmine and water lily\ndance in the spring sunshine\nside-long glances\nof the golden-hued ladies\nstab into my thoughts\nheaven itself cannot take my mind\nas it has been captivated by one lass\namong the five hundred I have seen here.<ref name=parana/>}}\n\nAmong the ancient political graffiti examples were [[Arab]] satirist poems. Yazid al-Himyari, an [[Umayyad]] [[Arab]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] poet, was most known for writing his political poetry on the walls between [[Sistan|Sajistan]] and [[Basra]], manifesting a strong hatred towards the [[Umayyad]] regime and its ''[[wali]]s'', and people used to read and circulate them very widely.<ref>\u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0631\u0648\u0651\u0629\u060c '''\u062a\u0631\u0627\u062b\u0646\u0627 \u0643\u064a\u0641 \u0646\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0647'''\u060c \u0645\u0624\u0633\u0633\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0628\u062d\u0627\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0628\u064a\u0631\u0648\u062a\u060c 1986{{clarify|date=October 2014}}</ref>{{clarify|date=October 2014}}\n\n=== Level of literacy often evident in graffiti ===\n\nHistoric forms of graffiti have helped gain understanding into the lifestyles and languages of past cultures. Errors in spelling and grammar in these graffiti offer insight into the degree of literacy in Roman times and provide clues on the pronunciation of spoken Latin. Examples are ''CIL'' IV, 7838: ''Vettium Firmum / aed''[ilem] ''quactiliar''[ii] {{sic}} ''rog''[ant]. Here, \"qu\" is pronounced \"co\". The 83 pieces of graffiti found at ''CIL'' IV, 4706-85 are evidence of the ability to read and write at levels of society where literacy might not be expected. The graffiti appear on a [[peristyle]] which was being remodeled at the time of the eruption of Vesuvius by the architect [[Crescens]]. The graffiti were left by both the foreman and his workers. The brothel at ''CIL'' VII, 12, 18\u201320 contains more than 120 pieces of graffiti, some of which were the work of the prostitutes and their clients. The [[gladiator]]ial academy at ''CIL'' IV, 4397 was scrawled with graffiti left by the gladiator Celadus Crescens (''Suspirium puellarum Celadus thraex'': \"Celadus the [[Thracians|Thracian]] makes the girls sigh.\")\n\nAnother piece from Pompeii, written on a tavern wall about the owner of the establishment and his questionable wine:\n\n{{poemquote|\nLandlord, may your lies malign\nBring destruction on your head!\nYou yourself drink unmixed wine,\nWater [do you] sell [to] your guests instead.<ref name=olmert/>}}\n\nIt was not only the Greeks and Romans who produced graffiti: the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] site of [[Tikal]] in [[Guatemala]] contains examples of [[ancient Maya graffiti]]. [[Viking]] graffiti survive in Rome and at [[Newgrange|Newgrange Mound]] in Ireland, and a [[Varangian]] scratched his name (Halvdan) in [[Runic alphabet|rune]]s on a [[banister]] in the [[Hagia Sophia]] at [[Constantinople]]. These early forms of graffiti have contributed to the understanding of lifestyles and languages of past cultures.\n\nGraffiti, known as Tacherons, were frequently scratched on Romanesque Scandinavian church walls.<ref name=green/>\nWhen [[Renaissance]] artists such as [[Pinturicchio]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], or [[Filippino Lippi]] descended into the ruins of Nero's [[Domus Aurea]], they carved or painted their names and returned to initiate the ''[[grottesche]]'' style of decoration.<ref name=\"archeology\"/><ref name=\"atlantic\"/>\n\nThere are also examples of graffiti occurring in American history, such as [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]], a national landmark along the [[Oregon Trail]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Independence Rock - California National Historic Trail (National Park Service)|url=https://www.nps.gov/cali/planyourvisit/site5.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=18 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nLater, French soldiers carved their names on monuments during the Napoleonic [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1798|campaign of Egypt]] in the 1790s.<ref name=JinxArtCrimes/> [[Lord Byron]]'s survives on one of the columns of the Temple of [[Poseidon]] at [[Cape Sounion]] in [[Attica]], Greece.<ref name=shanks/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Ancient graffiti\">\nRufus est caricature villa misteri Pompeii.jpg|Ancient [[Pompeii]] graffito [[caricature]] of a politician\n2487(Admiror paries).jpg|Ironic wall inscription commenting on boring graffiti\nJesus graffito.jpg|Satirical [[Alexamenos graffito]], possibly the earliest known [[representation of Jesus]]\nAncientgrafS.jpg|Graffiti, [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]]\nCrusader Graffiti in the Church of the holy supulchure Jerusalem Victor 2011 -1-21.jpg|Crusader graffiti in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre\nHagia-sofia-viking.jpg|[[Viking]] [[mercenary]] graffiti at the [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Istanbul, Turkey]]\nSigiriya-graffiti.jpg|Graffiti on the [[Sigiriya#Mirror wall|Mirror Wall]], [[Sigiriya]], [[Sri Lanka]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Contemporary graffiti ==\n\nContemporary graffiti style has been heavily influenced by [[hip hop culture]] <ref name=\"genius-paul-edwards-hiphopbook\">{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/Paul-edwards-is-graffiti-really-an-element-of-hip-hop-book-excerpt-annotated|title=Is Graffiti Really An Element Of Hip-Hop?

Graffiti have long appeared on building walls, in [[latrine]]s, railroad [[boxcar]]s, [[rapid transit|subways]], and bridges.\n\nThe oldest known example of modern graffiti are the [[Moniker (graffiti)|\"monikers\"]] found on traincars created by hobos and railworkers since the late 1800s. The Bozo Texino monikers were documented by filmmaker [[Bill Daniel (filmmaker)|Bill Daniel]] in his 2005 film, ''Who is Bozo Texino?''.<ref name=\"bozo-texino-walker\">{{cite web|url=https://walkerart.org/calendar/2010/who-is-bozo-texino|title=Who Is Bozo Texino?|date=22 July 2010|accessdate=23 August 2018|first=Bill|last=Daniel}}</ref><ref name=\"bozo-texino-film\">{{cite web|url=http://www.billdaniel.net/who-is-bozo-texino/|title=Who Is Bozo Texino?|date=2005|work=Who Is Bozo Texino?

In [[World War II]], an inscription on a wall at the fortress of [[Verdun]] was seen as an illustration of the US response twice in a generation to the wrongs of the Old World:<ref name=reagan/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/14/opinion/words-from-a-war.html|title=Words From a War|date=14 August 1985|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{poemquote|\nAustin White \u2013 Chicago, Ill \u2013 1918\nAustin White \u2013 Chicago, Ill \u2013 1945\nThis is the last time I want to write my name here.}}\n\nDuring World War II and for decades after, the phrase \"[[Kilroy was here]]\" with an accompanying illustration was widespread throughout the world, due to its use by American troops and ultimately filtering into American popular culture. Shortly after the death of [[Charlie Parker]] (nicknamed \"Yardbird\" or \"Bird\"), graffiti began appearing around New York with the words \"Bird Lives\".<ref name=russel /> The student protests and general strike of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] saw Paris bedecked in revolutionary, anarchistic, and situationist slogans such as ''L'ennui est contre-r\u00e9volutionnaire'' (\"Boredom is counterrevolutionary\") expressed in painted graffiti, [[poster]] art, and [[stencil]] art. At the time in the US, other political phrases (such as \"Free Huey\" about [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] [[Huey Newton]]) became briefly popular as graffiti in limited areas, only to be forgotten. A popular graffito of the early 1970s was \"Dick [[Richard Milhous Nixon|Nixon]] Before He Dicks You\", reflecting the hostility of the youth culture to that US president.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"World War II graffiti\">\nBundesarchiv Bild 101I-309-0816-20A, Italien, Soldat zeichnend.jpg|Soldier with tropical fantasy graffiti (1943\u20131944)\nGraffiti inside the ruins of the German Reichstag building.jpg|Soviet Army graffiti in the ruins of the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] in [[Berlin]] (1945)\nKilroy Was Here - Washington DC WWII Memorial - Jason Coyne.jpg|Permanent engraving of [[Kilroy was here|Kilroy]] on the [[National World War II Memorial|World War II Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Advent of aerosol paint ===\n\nRock and roll graffiti is a significant subgenre. A famous graffito of the twentieth century was the inscription in the London tube reading \"Clapton is God\" in a link to the guitarist [[Eric Clapton]]. The phrase was spray-painted by an admirer on a wall in an [[Islington]] station on the [[London Underground|Underground]] in the autumn of 1967. The graffito was captured in a photograph, in which a dog is [[Urine marking#Canidae|urinating on the wall]].\n\nGraffiti also became associated with the anti-establishment [[punk rock]] movement beginning in the 1970s. Bands such as [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and [[Crass]] (and their followers) widely [[stencil]]ed their names and logos, while many punk night clubs, squats, and hangouts are famous for their graffiti. In the late 1980s the upside down Martini glass that was the tag for punk band [[Missing Foundation]] was the most ubiquitous graffito in lower Manhattan{{According to whom|date=March 2019}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Early spray-painted graffiti\">\nNYC R36 1 subway car.png|[[New York City Subway]] trains were covered in graffiti (1973)\nGRAFFITI ON A WALL IN CHICAGO.

For many outside of New York, it was their first encounter with their art form. Fab{{nbsp}}5 Freddy's friendship with [[Debbie Harry]] influenced [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s single \"[[Rapture (Blondie song)|Rapture]]\" ([[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]], 1981), the video of which featured [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], and offered many their first glimpse of a depiction of elements of graffiti in hip hop culture. JaJaJa toured Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, and Holland with a large graffiti canvas as a backdrop.<ref name=chesh/> Charlie Ahearn's independently released fiction film ''[[Wild Style]]'' (Wild Style, 1983), the early [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary ''[[Style Wars]]'' (1983), hit songs such as \"[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]\" and \"[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]\" and their accompanying [[music video]]s (both 1982) contributed to a growing interest outside New York in all aspects of hip hop.<ref name=\"genius-paul-edwards-hiphopbook\" />\n\n''Style Wars'' depicted not only famous graffitists such as Skeme, [[DONDI|Dondi]], MinOne, and [[Zephyr (artist)|ZEPHYR]], but also reinforced graffiti's role within New York's emerging hip-hop culture by incorporating famous early break-dancing groups such as Rock Steady Crew into the film and featuring rap in the soundtrack. Although many officers of the New York City Police Department found this film to be controversial, Style Wars is still recognized as the most prolific film representation of what was going on within the young hip hop culture of the early 1980s.<ref name=labonte/> Fab{{nbsp}}5 Freddy and Futura 2000 took hip hop graffiti to Paris and London as part of the New York City Rap Tour in 1983.<ref name=hershk/> Hollywood also paid attention, consulting writers such as [[PHASE 2]] as it depicted the culture and gave it international exposure in movies such as ''[[Beat Street]]'' ([[Orion Pictures|Orion]], 1984).\n\n=== Stencil graffiti emerges ===\n\nThis period also saw the emergence of the new [[stencil graffiti]] genre. Some of the first examples were created in 1981 by graffitists [[Blek le Rat]] in Paris, in 1982 by [[Jef Aerosol]] in Tours (France);{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} by 1985 stencils had appeared in other cities including New York City, Sydney, and [[Melbourne]], where they were documented by American photographer Charles Gatewood and Australian photographer Rennie Ellis.<ref name=ellis/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Stencil graffiti\">\nFile:Political graffiti in Cancun, Mexico.jpg|thumb|Political graffiti in [[Cancun]], [[Mexico]] (2007)\nTankStencil.jpg|Modern [[stencil graffiti]], a very common style, in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada\nbanksy.on.the.thekla.arp.jpg|Stencil by [[Banksy]] on the waterline of [[Old Profanity Showboat (Thekla)|The Thekla]], an entertainment boat in central [[Bristol]]\nI-barc.JPG|Stencil in [[Barcelona]], Spain\nGraffiti in Tartu 03.JPG|Stencil graffito by [[Edward von L\u00f5ngus]] in [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]], that takes a popular children's book character and manipulates it to produce a social-critical work about the [[war on drugs]]\nGraffiti in Lisbon.jpg|Graffiti in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Graffiti as a memorial ===\n\nPeople often leave their traces in wet cement or concrete. This type of graffito often commemorates the mutual commitment of a couple, or simply records a person's presence at a particular moment. Often this type of graffito is dated and is left untouched for decades, offering a look into local historical minutiae.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Commercialization and entrance into mainstream pop culture ===\n\n{{Main|Commercial graffiti}}\n\nWith the popularity and legitimization of graffiti has come a level of commercialization. In 2001, computer giant [[IBM]] launched an advertising campaign in Chicago and San Francisco which involved people spray painting on sidewalks a [[peace symbol]], a [[Heart (symbol)|heart]], and a [[penguin]] ([[Linux]] [[mascot]]), to represent \"Peace, Love, and Linux.\" IBM paid Chicago and San Francisco collectively US$120,000 for punitive damages and clean-up costs.<ref name=guerilla/><ref name=wired/>\n\nIn 2005, a similar ad campaign was launched by [[Sony]] and executed by its advertising agency in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Miami, to market its handheld [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] gaming system. In [[PlayStation Portable#Controversial advertising campaigns|this campaign]], taking notice of the legal problems of the IBM campaign, Sony paid building owners for the rights to paint on their buildings \"a collection of dizzy-eyed urban kids playing with the PSP as if it were a skateboard, a paddle, or a rocking horse\".<ref name=wired/>\n\n=== Advocates ===\n\n[[Marc Ecko]], an urban clothing designer, has been an advocate of graffiti as an art form during this period, stating that \"Graffiti is without question the most powerful art movement in recent history and has been a driving inspiration throughout my career.\"<ref name=sohh/>\n\nGraffiti have become a common stepping stone for many members of both the [[art and design]] communities in North America and abroad. Within the United States graffitists such as Mike Giant, Pursue, Rime, Noah, and countless others have made careers in skateboard, apparel, and shoe design for companies such as DC Shoes, Adidas, Rebel8, Osiris, or Circa<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Meanwhile, there are many others such as DZINE, Daze, Blade, and The Mac who have made the switch to being gallery artists, often not even using their initial medium, spray paint.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Yarnbus.jpg|thumb|This bus has been [[yarn bombing|yarn bombed]] by a team of knitters. {{Deletable image-caption|date=May 2012}}]] -->\n\n=== Global developments ===\n==== South America ====\n\nTristan Manco wrote that Brazil \"boasts a unique and particularly rich, graffiti scene&nbsp;... [earning] it an international reputation as the place to go for artistic inspiration.\" Graffiti \"flourishes in every conceivable space in Brazil's cities.\" Artistic parallels \"are often drawn between the energy of S\u00e3o Paulo today and 1970s New York.\" The \"sprawling metropolis,\" of S\u00e3o Paulo has \"become the new shrine to graffiti;\" Manco alludes to \"poverty and unemployment&nbsp;... [and] the epic struggles and conditions of the country's marginalised peoples,\" and to \"Brazil's chronic poverty,\" as the main engines that \"have fuelled a vibrant graffiti culture.\" In world terms, Brazil has \"one of the most uneven distributions of income. Laws and taxes change frequently.\" Such factors, Manco argues, contribute to a very fluid society, riven with those economic divisions and social tensions that underpin and feed the \"folkloric vandalism and an urban sport for the disenfranchised,\" that is South American graffiti art.<ref name=manco7/>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:IMG 6754 3.jpg|thumb|Poetry graffiti in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]]] -->[[File:Graffiti in Tel Aviv, Israel.jpg|thumb|180px|A graffiti piece found in Tel Aviv by the artist DeDe]]\nProminent Brazilian graffitists include [[Os G\u00eameos]], Boleta, [[Francisco Rodrigues da Silva|Nunca]], Nina, Speto, Tikka, and T.Freak.<ref name=globo/> Their artistic success and involvement in commercial design ventures<ref name=nicek/> has highlighted divisions within the Brazilian graffiti community between adherents of the cruder transgressive form of ''picha\u00e7\u00e3o'' and the more conventionally artistic values of the practitioners of ''grafite''.<ref name=revela/>\n\n==== Middle East ====\n\nGraffiti in the [[Middle East]] is emerging slowly, with pockets of taggers operating in the various 'Emirates' of the [[United Arab Emirates]], in [[Israel]], and in [[Iran]]. The major Iranian newspaper ''[[Hamshahri]]'' has published two articles on illegal writers in the city with photographic coverage of Iranian artist [[A1one]]'s works on Tehran walls. Tokyo-based design magazine, ''PingMag'', has interviewed A1one and featured photographs of his work.<ref name=pinmag/> The [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] has become a site for graffiti, reminiscent in this sense of the [[Berlin Wall]]. Many graffitists in Israel come from other places around the globe, such as JUIF from Los Angeles and DEVIONE from London. The religious reference \"\u05e0 \u05e0\u05d7 \u05e0\u05d7\u05de \u05e0\u05d7\u05de\u05df \u05de\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05df\" (\"[[Na Nach Nachma Nachman Meuman]]\") is commonly seen in graffiti around Israel.\n\n==== Southeast Asia ====\n\nThere are also a large number of graffiti influences in [[Southeast Asia]]n countries that mostly come from modern [[Western culture]], such as Malaysia, where graffiti have long been a common sight in Malaysia's capital city, [[Kuala Lumpur]]. Since 2010, the country has begun hosting a street festival to encourage all generations and people from all walks of life to enjoy and encourage Malaysian street culture.<ref name=kharbar/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Graffiti around the world\">\nGrafiti, \u010cakovec (Croatia).2.jpg|Graffiti on a wall in [[\u010cakovec]], [[Croatia]]\nGraffiti in Budapest, Pestszentl\u0151rinc.jpg|Graffiti of the character [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] on a wall in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]\nMAAU-SP.jpg|Open Museum of Urban Art of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\nGraffiti in Ho Chi Minh City.JPG|Graffiti in [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[Vietnam]]\nTehranurbanartalone.jpg|Graffiti in [[Tehran, Iran]]\nMr. Wany's work-in-progress artwork for Kul Sign Festival.JPG|Graffiti art in [[Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia]]\nGraffiti in Upper Manhattan November 3, 2013.jpg|Graffiti on a retaining wall in [[Upper Manhattan]]\nGraffiti in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.jpg|Graffiti in [[Yogyakarta]], [[Indonesia]]\nGraffiti in Bangkok 12.jpg|Graffiti in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Characteristics of common graffiti ==\n\n{{See also|Graffiti terminology|Graffiti in the United States}}\n\n=== Methods and production ===\n\nThe modern-day graffitists can be found with an arsenal of various materials that allow for a successful production of a piece.<ref name=nicolas/> This includes such techniques as [[Scribing (graffiti)|scribing]]. However, [[spray paint]] in aerosol cans is the number one medium for graffiti. From this commodity comes different styles, technique, and abilities to form master works of graffiti. Spray paint can be found at hardware and art stores and comes in virtually every color.\n\n[[Stencil graffiti]] is created by cutting out shapes and designs in a stiff material (such as [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]] or subject [[File folder|folder]]s) to form an overall design or image. The stencil is then placed on the \"canvas\" gently and with quick, easy strokes of the aerosol can, the image begins to appear on the intended surface.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Graffiti making\">\nFile:Vlg shop.jpg|The first graffiti shop in Russia was opened in 1992 in [[Tver]]\nFile:Eurofestival graffiti 2.jpg|Graffiti application at Eurofestival in [[Turku]], Finland\nFile:Graffity in the making...(On a wall at Thrissur) CIMG9868.JPG|Graffiti application in India using natural pigments (mostly [[charcoal]], plant [[sap]]s, and dirt)\nFile:Graffity in the making...(On a wall at Thrissur) CIMG9873.jpg|Completed landscape scene, in [[Thrissur]], [[Kerala]], India\nFile:Leake Street TQ3079 352.JPG|A graffiti artist at work in London\n</gallery>\n\n=== Modern experimentation ===\n\n[[File:Knitted graffiti 1.jpg|thumb|right|Knitted graffiti in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]]]]\n[[File:Spiderweb Yarnbomb Installation by Stephen Duneier.JPG|thumbnail|Spiderweb Yarnbomb Installation by Stephen Duneier both hides and highlights previous graffiti.]]\n\nModern graffiti art often incorporates additional arts and technologies. For example, [[Graffiti Research Lab]] has encouraged the use of projected images and magnetic light-emitting diodes ([[LED art|throwies]]) as new media for graffitists. [[Yarnbombing]] is another recent form of graffiti. Yarnbombers occasionally target previous graffiti for modification, which had been avoided among the majority of graffitists.\n\n=== Tagging ===\n\n[[File:Tag by Spore.jpg|thumb|A tag in [[Dallas]], reading \"Spore\"]]\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\n[[File:Grafitti on Class 376 train at Cannon Street.jpg|thumb|A tagged {{BRC|376}} train at [[Cannon Street station]]]]\n\nSome of the most common styles of graffiti have their own names. A '''tag''' is the most basic writing of an artist's name; it is simply a [[handstyle]]. A graffiti writer's tag is his or her personalized signature. Tagging is often the example given when opponents of graffiti refer to any acts of handstyle graffiti writing (it is by far the most common form of graffiti). Tags can contain subtle and sometimes cryptic messages, and may incorporate the artist's crew initials or other letters.\n\nOne form of tagging, known as '''pissing''', involves taking a refillable fire-extinguisher and replacing the contents with paint, allowing for tags as high as approximately {{convert|20|ft|m}}. Aiming and keeping a handstyle steady in this form of tagging is very difficult, usually coming out wavy and sloppy.\n\nAnother form is the '''throw-up''', also known as a '''bombing''', which is normally painted very quickly with two or three colors, sacrificing aesthetics for speed. Throw-ups can also be outlined on a surface with one color. A '''piece''' is a more elaborate representation of the artist's name, incorporating more stylized letters, usually incorporating a much larger range of colors. This is more time-consuming and increases the likelihood of the artist getting caught. \n[[File: Graffiti under a bridge in Poland.jpg|thumb|Throw-ups and a piece under a railway bridge in [[Poland]].]]\n\nA '''blockbuster''' or '''roller''' is a large piece, almost always done in a block-shaped style, done simply to cover a large area solidly with two contrasting colors, sometimes with the whole purpose of blocking other writers from painting on the same wall. These are usually accomplished with extended paint rollers and gallons of cheap exterior paint.\n\nA more complex style is '''[[wildstyle]]''', a form of graffiti usually involving interlocking letters and connecting points. These pieces are often harder to read by non-graffitists as the letters merge into one another in an often-undecipherable manner.\n\nSome artists also use self-adhesive '''stickers''' as a quick way to do catch ups. While certain critics from within graffiti culture consider this lazy, stickers can be quite detailed in their own right and often, are used in conjunction with other materials. Sticker tags are commonly executed on blank postage stickers, as these can easily be acquired with no cost on the writer's part.\n\nMany graffitists believe that doing complex pieces involves too great an investment of time to justify the practice. Doing a piece can take (depending on experience and size) from 30 minutes to months on end, as was the case for [[Saber (artist)|Saber]] MSK while working on the world's largest graffiti piece on the LA river.\n\nAnother graffitists can go over a piece in a matter of minutes with a simple throw-up. This was exemplified by the writer \"CAP\" in the documentary ''[[Style Wars]]'', who, other writers complain, ruins pieces with his quick throw ups. This became known as '''capping''' and often is done when there is a \"beef\", or conflict between writers.\n\nA number of recent examples of graffiti make use of [[hashtags]].<ref>[http://news.fitzrovia.org.uk/2015/07/23/hashtag-on-the-pavement-connects-with-fitzrovias-past/] \"Hashtag on the pavement connects with Fitzrovia's past\", Fitzrovia News, 23 July 2015, Retrieved 17 January 2016</ref><ref>[http://massappeal.com/riskrock-graffiti-in-san-francisco/] \"#RISKROCK #GRAFFITI IN #SANFRANCISCO\", Mass Appeal, Retrieved 17 January 2016.</ref>\n{{wide image|Graffiti i bagg\u00e5rd i \u00e5rhus 2c.jpg|1300px|align-cap=center|Densely-tagged parking area in [[\u00c5rhus]], Denmark|center|}}\n\n== Uses ==\n\nTheories on the use of graffiti by [[avant-garde]] artists have a history dating back at least to the [[Asger Jorn]], who in 1962 painting declared in a graffiti-like gesture \"the avant-garde won't give up\".<ref>{{cite book | title=Expression as vandalism: Asger Jorn's \"Modifications\" | publisher=The University of Chicago Press | author=Karen Kurczynski | year=2008 | pages=293}}</ref>\n\nMany contemporary analysts and even art critics have begun to see artistic value in some graffiti and to recognize it as a form of [[public art]]. According to many art researchers, particularly in the Netherlands and in Los Angeles, that type of public art is, in fact an effective tool of social [[political emancipation|emancipation]] or, in the achievement of a political goal.<ref name=thimar/>\n\nIn times of conflict, such murals have offered a means of communication and self-expression for members of these socially, ethnically, or racially divided communities, and have proven themselves as effective tools in establishing dialog and thus, of addressing cleavages in the long run. The [[Berlin Wall]] was also extensively covered by graffiti reflecting social pressures relating to the oppressive [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule over the [[East Germany|GDR]].\n\nMany artists involved with graffiti are also concerned with the similar activity of [[stenciling]]. Essentially, this entails stenciling a print of one or more colors using spray-paint. Recognized while [[Art exhibition|exhibiting]] and publishing several of her coloured stencils and paintings portraying the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] and [[Urban area|urban Britain]] in the early 2000s, graffitists [[M.I.A. (artist)|Mathangi Arulpragasam, aka M.I.A.]], has also become known for integrating her imagery of political violence into her [[music videos]] for singles \"[[Galang (song)|Galang]]\" and \"[[Bucky Done Gun]]\", and her cover art. Stickers of her artwork also often appear around places such as London in [[Brick Lane]], stuck to lamp posts and street signs, she having become a muse for other graffitists and painters worldwide in cities including [[Seville]].\n\n=== Personal expression ===\n\nMany graffitists choose to protect their identities and remain anonymous or to hinder prosecution.\n\nWith the commercialization of graffiti (and [[hip hop]] in general), in most cases, even with legally painted \"graffiti\" art, graffitists tend to choose anonymity. This may be attributed to various reasons or a combination of reasons. Graffiti still remains the [[hip hop#Cultural pillars|one of four hip hop elements]] that is not considered \"performance art\" despite the image of the \"singing and dancing star\" that sells hip hop culture to the mainstream. Being a graphic form of art, it might also be said that many graffitists still fall in the category of the [[Extraversion and introversion#Introversion|introverted archetypal artist]].\n\n[[Banksy]] is one of the world's most notorious and popular street artists who continues to remain faceless in today's society.<ref name=banksy/> He is known for his political, anti-war stencil art mainly in [[Bristol, England]], but his work may be seen anywhere from Los Angeles to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. In the UK, Banksy is the most recognizable icon for this cultural artistic movement and keeps his identity a secret to avoid arrest. Much of Banksy's artwork may be seen around the streets of London and surrounding suburbs, although he has painted pictures throughout the world, including the Middle East, where he has painted on Israel's controversial [[West Bank]] barrier with satirical images of life on the other side. One depicted a hole in the wall with an idyllic beach, while another shows a mountain landscape on the other side. A number of [[Art exhibition|exhibitions]] also have taken place since 2000, and recent works of art have fetched vast sums of money. Banksy's art is a prime example of the classic controversy: vandalism vs. art. Art supporters endorse his work distributed in urban areas as pieces of art and some councils, such as Bristol and Islington, have officially protected them, while officials of other areas have deemed his work to be vandalism and have removed it.\n\n[[Pixnit]] is another artist who chooses to keep her identity from the general public.<ref name=shaer/> Her work focuses on beauty and design aspects of graffiti as opposed to Banksy's anti-government shock value. Her paintings are often of flower designs above shops and stores in her local urban area of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Some store owners endorse her work and encourage others to do similar work as well. \"One of the pieces was left up above Steve's Kitchen, because it looks pretty awesome\"- Erin Scott, the manager of [[New England Comics]] in [[Allston, Massachusetts]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Personal graffiti\">\nGraffiti at the Temple of Philae (XIII).jpg|Drawing at [[Temple of Philae]], Egypt depicting three men with rods, or staves.\n4091(Quisquis amat).jpg|Inscription in [[Pompeii]] lamenting a frustrated love, \"Whoever loves, let him flourish, let him perish who knows not love, let him perish twice over whoever forbids love.\"\nPost Apocalyptic Zombie Graffiti, Jan 2015.jpg|[[Post-apocalyptic]] despair\nMermaid Sliema.JPG|[[Mermaid]] in [[Sliema]], [[Malta]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Radical and political ===\n[[File:M2109 Iraq War Protest (Black Bloc Element).jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|[[Black bloc]] members spray graffiti on a wall during an [[Protests against the Iraq War#March 21, 2009|Iraq War Protest]] in Washington, D.C.]]\n\nGraffiti often has a reputation as part of a subculture that rebels against authority, although the considerations of the practitioners often diverge and can relate to a wide range of attitudes. It can express a political practice and can form just one tool in an array of resistance techniques. One early example includes the [[anarcho-punk]] band [[Crass]], who conducted a campaign of stenciling [[anti-war]], [[anarchism|anarchist]], [[feminism|feminist]], and [[consumerism|anti-consumerist]] messages throughout the [[London Underground]] system during the late 1970s and early 1980s.<ref name=souther/> In [[Amsterdam]] graffiti was a major part of the punk scene. The city was covered with names such as \"De Zoot\", \"Vendex\", and \"Dr Rat\".<ref name=stockho/> To document the graffiti a punk magazine was started that was called ''Gallery Anus''. So when hip hop came to Europe in the early 1980s there was already a vibrant graffiti culture.\n\nThe student protests and general strike of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] saw Paris bedecked in revolutionary, anarchistic, and situationist slogans such as ''L'ennui est contre-r\u00e9volutionnaire'' (\"Boredom is counterrevolutionary\") and ''Lisez moins, vivez plus'' (\"Read less, live more\"). While not exhaustive, the graffiti gave a sense of the 'millenarian' and rebellious spirit, tempered with a good deal of verbal wit, of the strikers.\n\n{{quote box|align=right|width=220px|quote=I think graffiti writing is a way of defining what our generation is like. Excuse the French, we're not a bunch of p---- artists. Traditionally artists have been considered soft and mellow people, a little bit kooky. Maybe we're a little bit more like pirates that way. We defend our territory, whatever space we steal to paint on, we defend it fiercely.|source=\u2014Sandra \"Lady Pink\" Fabara<ref name=chang/>}}\n\nThe developments of graffiti art which took place in art galleries and colleges as well as \"on the street\" or \"underground\", contributed to the resurfacing in the 1990s of a far more overtly politicized art form in the [[subvertising]], [[culture jamming]], or tactical media movements. These movements or styles tend to classify the artists by their relationship to their social and economic contexts, since, in most countries, graffiti art remains illegal in many forms except when using non-permanent paint. Since the 1990s with the rise of [[Street Art]], a growing number of artists are switching to non-permanent paints and non-traditional forms of painting<ref name=\"ziptopia-switch\">{{cite web|url=https://www.zipcar.com/ziptopia/city-living/temporary-street-art-changing-the-graffiti-game|title=Temporary Street Art That's Changing The Graffiti Game|work=Ziptopia|first=STEVEN|last=HARRINGTON |accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"huffpost-streetart\">{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/ron-english/street-art-its-not-meant-_b_5610496.html|title=Street Art: It's Not Meant to be Permanent|work=Huffington Post|first=Ron|last=English|date=6 Dec 2017|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref> for a variety of reasons\u2014but primarily because is it difficult for the police to apprehend them and for the courts to sentence or even convict a person for a protest that is as fleeting and less intrusive than marching in the streets. In some communities, such impermanent works survive longer than works created with permanent paints because the community views the work in the same vein as that of the civil protester who marches in the street\u2014such protest are impermanent, but effective nevertheless.\n\nIn some areas where a number of artists share the impermanence ideal, an informal competition develops: the length of time that a work escapes destruction is viewed as a measure of the respect the work garners in the community. A crude work that deserves little respect would be invariably removed immediately, while the most talented artists might have works last for days.\n\nContemporary practitioners, accordingly, have varied and often conflicting practices. Some individuals, such as [[Alexander Brener]], have used the medium to politicize other art forms, and have used the prison sentences enforced on them as a means of further protest.<ref name=\"voice\" />\nThe practices of anonymous groups and individuals also vary widely, and practitioners by no means always agree with each other's practices. For example, the anti-capitalist art group the [[Space Hijackers]] did a piece in 2004 about the contradiction between the capitalistic elements of Banksy and his use of political [[imagery]].<ref name=\"tanyabaxter-Gallery\">{{cite web|url=http://tanyabaxtercontemporary.com/banksy#!Banksy_Flying_Copper__screen_print_on_paper__100_x_70_cm|title= Banksy |work=Tanya Baxter Contemporary Gallery|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"haynes-banksy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.haynesfineart.com/artists/Banksy--|title= Banksy |work=Haynes Fine Art|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn top of the political aspect of graffiti as a [[Cultural movement|movement]], political groups and individuals may also use graffiti as a tool to spread their [[perspective (cognitive)|point of view]]. This practice, due to its illegality, has generally become favored by groups excluded from the political mainstream (e.g. [[far-left]] or [[far-right]] groups) who justify their activity by pointing out that they do not have the money \u2013 or sometimes the desire \u2013 to buy [[advertising]] to get their message across, and that a \"[[ruling class]]\" or \"establishment\" controls the mainstream press, systematically excluding the radical and alternative point of view. This type of graffiti can seem crude; for example [[Fascism|fascist]] supporters often scrawl [[swastika]]s and other [[Nazism|Nazi]] images.\n\nOne innovative form of graffiti that emerged in the UK in the 1970s was devised by the Money Liberation Front (MLF), essentially a loose affiliation of [[underground press]] writers such as the poet and playwright [[Heathcote Williams]] and magazine editor and playwright Jay Jeff Jones. They initiated the use of paper currency as a medium for [[counterculture]] propaganda, overprinting banknotes, usually with a [[John Bull]] printing set. Although short lived, the MLF was representative of London's [[Ladbroke Grove]] centered alternative and literary community of the period. The area was also a scene of considerable [[anti-establishment]] and humorous street graffiti, much of which is also produced by Williams.<ref name=history/> In 2009, following the elections in Iran, protesters (who regarded the electoral result as rigged) began to deface banknotes with slogans such as \"Death to the dictator\". In Colombia writing and drawing on banknotes has become increasingly popular, either to make political comments, for fun or as an artistic medium. The national government has run advertising campaigns in an attempt to discourage the practice. In the UK there have been signs of an MLF resurgence with a number of banknotes in circulation being over-marked with protest slogans such as \"Banks=Robbers\", relating to the perceived culpability of banks in the financial crisis.\n\nBoth sides of the conflict in [[Northern Ireland]] produce political graffiti. As well as slogans, Northern Irish political graffiti includes large wall paintings, referred to as ''[[Northern Irish murals|murals]]''. Along with the flying of flags and the painting of kerb stones, the murals serve a territorial purpose, often associated with gang use. Artists paint them mostly on house gables or on the ''[[Belfast Peace Lines|Peace Lines]]'', high walls that separate different communities.\n\nThe murals often develop over an extended period and tend to stylization, with a strong symbolic or [[iconographic]] content. [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist]] murals often refer to historical events dating from the war between [[James II of England|James II]] and [[William III of England|William III]] in the late seventeenth century, whereas [[Irish Republicanism|Republican]] murals usually refer to the more recent [[The Troubles|troubles]].\n\nTerritorial graffiti marks urban neighborhoods with tags and logos to differentiate certain groups from others. These images are meant to show outsiders a stern look at whose turf is whose. The subject matter of gang-related graffiti consists of cryptic [[symbols]] and [[initials]] strictly fashioned with unique [[calligraphies]]. Gang members use graffiti to designate membership throughout the gang, to differentiate rivals and associates and, most commonly, to mark borders which are both territorial and ideological.<ref name=ley/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Political graffiti around the world\">\nFile:Anti Iraqi war graffiti by street artist Sony Montana in Cancun, Mexico.jpg|thumb|Anti Iraqi war graffiti by street artist Sony Montana in [[Cancun]], [[Mexico]] (2007)\nNablus Graffiti Resistance Victor Grigas 2011-01-76.jpg|Wall in [[Nablus]], [[West Bank]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (2011)\nVote for Filip Filipovic.jpg|Wall in Sremska Street in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]], with the slogan \"Vote for [[Filip Filipovi\u0107 (politician)|Filip Filipovi\u0107]]\", who was the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|communist]] candidate for the [[mayor of Belgrade]] (1920)\nThe separation barrier which runs through Bethlehem.jpg|An interpretation of ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' on the separation barrier which runs through [[Bethlehem]]\nBerlinAnhalterBunker.jpg|WWII bunker near [[Anhalter Bahnhof]] ([[Berlin]]) with a graffiti inscription ''Wer Bunker baut, wirft Bomben'' (those who build bunkers, throw bombs)\nGates in the 'Peace Line'.jpg|Gates in a peace line in West Belfast, marking the boundary between [[Segregation in Northern Ireland|segregated communities in Northern Ireland]]\nAmsterdam Grafitti Freedom Lives When the State Dies.png|Graffiti on the train line leading to Central Station in Amsterdam\nRiia-002.JPG|\"Let's JOKK\" in [[Tartu]] refers to political scandal with the [[Estonian Reform Party]] (2012)\nMural painting celebrating Pol Pot in Sundsvall.jpg|Mural tribute to Cambodian revolutionary leader [[Pol Pot]] in [[Sundsvall]], Sweden (2007)\nMoscow Russia anti-Putin Graffiti R-EVOLUTION-2.jpg|\"R-evolution\" stencil [[Vladimir Putin|pro-Putin]] graffito in [[Moscow]], Russia (2012)\nEgyptian Anonymous - \u062b\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062d\u0641\u0627\u062f \u0647\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u062c\u0627\u062f.jpg|Egyptian stencil combining a [[Pharaoh|Pharaonic]] image with a [[V for Vendetta (film)|Guy Fawkes]] mask\nPieks\u00e4m\u00e4ki - Kekkos-graffiti IMG 0227 C.JPG|Stencil in [[Pieks\u00e4m\u00e4ki]] representing former president of Finland, [[Urho Kekkonen]], well known in Finnish popular culture\nOneWaytoPeace Donated By Matthew Staben DivineSnapshots.com Sept.19.2010.jpg|[[Peace symbol]] added to traffic sign\nKeep your rosaries graffiti.jpg|[[Feminist graffiti]] in [[A Coru\u00f1a]], Spain that reads in [[Galician language|Galician]]: \"Enough with rosaries in our ovaries\"\nAustralia steals Timor Oil.jpg|[[East Timor]]ese protest against Australian petroleum extraction\nGraffiti in Montclair.JPG|Graffiti as a method of expressing sexual orientation in [[Montclair, California]]\nKiss-EastSideGallery.jpg|Graffiti of two [[Second World|communist]] leaders [[Socialist fraternal kiss|kissing]], on the [[Berlin Wall]]\nBethlehem Wall Graffiti 1.jpg|Ironic graffiti in [[Bethlehem]]\nGraffiti Nale\u017cysz do stada?.JPG|This Polish graffiti asks, \"Do you belong to the herd?\"\nKeizer artwork.JPG|Protest stencil in [[Cairo, Egypt]] (2011)\nBerliner Mauer.jpg|[[Berlin Wall]]: \"Anyone who wants to keep the world as it is, does not want it to remain\"\nGeorgia (666).jpg|Graffiti of [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Adolf Hitler]] with sign [[Diarrhea]] above, [[Tbilisi]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== As advertising ===\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}\n\nGraffiti has been used as a means of advertising both legally and illegally.

In the UK, Covent Garden's [[Boxfresh]] used stencil images of a [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] revolutionary in the hopes that cross referencing would promote their store.\n\n[[Smirnoff]] hired artists to use [[reverse graffiti]] (the use of high pressure hoses to clean dirty surfaces to leave a clean image in the surrounding dirt) to increase awareness of their product.

It can then be understood only if one knows the relevant \"local code\" (social, historical, political, temporal, and spatial), which is seen as [[heteroglossia|heteroglot]] and thus a 'unique set of conditions' in a cultural context.<ref name=holqu/>\n:A spatial code for example, could be that there is a certain youth group in an area that is engaging heavily in racist activities. So, for residents (knowing the local code), a graffiti containing only the name or abbreviation of this gang already is a racist expression, reminding the offended people of their gang activities. Also a graffiti is in most cases, the [[herald]] of more serious criminal activity to come.<ref name=kelling/> A person who does not know these gang activities would not be able to recognize the meaning of this graffiti. Also if a tag of this youth group or gang is placed on a building occupied by asylum seekers, for example, its racist character is even stronger.\n\nBy making the graffiti less explicit (as adapted to social and legal constraints),<ref name=barker/> these drawings are less likely to be removed, but do not lose their threatening and offensive character.<ref name=lynn/>\n\nElsewhere, activists in Russia have used painted [[caricature]]s of local officials with their mouths as [[pothole]]s, to show their anger about the poor state of the roads.<ref>{{cite news |last=Schreck |first=Carl |date=2015-06-19 |title=Russian politicians mocked with guerrilla pothole portraits |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/19/russia-pothole-portraits-activists-banksy |website= New East Network |access-date=2015-09-24}}</ref> In [[Manchester, England]] a graffitists painted obscene images around potholes, which often resulted in their being repaired within 48 hours.<ref>{{cite news |date=2015-04-29 |title=Meet the man using penises to fill potholes |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/11570595/Meet-the-man-using-penises-to-fill-potholes.html |website= The Telegraph |access-date=2015-09-24}}</ref>\n\n== Decorative and high art ==\n\n{{Main|Street art}}\n[[File:JonesyLondon.jpg|thumb|upright|A bronze work by Jonesy on a wall in Brick Lane ([[London]]).

It displayed 22 works by New York graffitists, including [[Crash (graffiti artist)|Crash]], Daze, and [[Lady Pink]]. In an article about the exhibition in the magazine ''Time Out'', curator Charlotta Kotik said that she hoped the exhibition would cause viewers to rethink their assumptions about graffiti. [[Terrance Lindall]], an artist and executive director of the Williamsburg Art and Historic Center, said regarding graffiti and the exhibition:<ref name=tonyk/>\n<blockquote>\"Graffiti is revolutionary, in my opinion\", he says, \"and any revolution might be considered a crime. People who are oppressed or suppressed need an outlet, so they write on walls\u2014it's free.\"</blockquote>\n\nFrom the 1970s onwards, [[Burhan Dogancay]] photographed urban walls all over the world; these he then archived for use as sources of inspiration for his painterly works. The project today known as \"Walls of the World\" grew beyond even his own expectations and comprises about 30,000 individual images. It spans a period of 40 years across five continents and 114 countries. In 1982, photographs from this project comprised a one-man exhibition titled \"Les murs murmurent, ils crient, ils chantent{{nbsp}}...\" (The walls whisper, shout and sing{{nbsp}}...) at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in [[Paris]].\n\nIn Australia, art historians have judged some local graffiti of sufficient creative merit to rank them firmly within the arts.

Now some of his work is preserved officially.\n\nIn [[Taiwan]], the government has made some concessions to graffitists. Since 2005 they have been allowed to freely display their work along some sections of riverside retaining walls in designated \"Graffiti Zones\".<ref name=taitimes/> From 2007, Taipei's department of cultural affairs also began permitting graffiti on fences around major public construction sites. Department head Yong-ping Lee (\u674e\u6c38\u840d) stated, \"We will promote graffiti starting with the public sector, and then later in the private sector too. It's our goal to beautify the city with graffiti\". The government later helped organize a graffiti contest in [[Ximending]], a popular shopping district. graffitists caught working outside of these designated areas still face fines up to [[NT$]]6,000 under a department of environmental protection regulation.<ref name=taitimes2/> However, Taiwanese authorities can be relatively lenient, one veteran police officer stating anonymously, \"Unless someone complains about vandalism, we won't get involved. We don't go after it proactively.\"<ref name=reuters/>\n\nIn 1993, after several expensive cars in [[Singapore]] were spray-painted, the police arrested a student from the [[Singapore American School]], [[Michael P. Fay]], questioned him, and subsequently charged him with vandalism. Fay pleaded guilty to vandalizing a car in addition to stealing road signs. Under the 1966 [[Vandalism Act (Singapore)|Vandalism Act of Singapore]], originally passed to curb the spread of communist graffiti in Singapore, the court sentenced him to four months in jail, a fine of S$3,500 (US$2,233), and a [[caning]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran several editorials and op-eds that condemned the punishment and called on the American public to flood the Singaporean embassy with protests. Although the Singapore government received many calls for [[pardon|clemency]], Fay's caning took place in Singapore on 5 May 1994. Fay had originally received a sentence of six strokes of the cane, but the presiding [[president of Singapore]], [[Ong Teng Cheong]], agreed to reduce his caning sentence to four lashes.<ref name=nyt/>\n\nIn [[Republic of Korea|South Korea]], Park Jung-soo was fined two million [[South Korean won]] by the [[Seoul]] Central District Court for spray-painting a rat on posters of the [[G-20]] Summit a few days before the event in November 2011. Park alleged that the initial in \"G-20\" sounds like the Korean word for \"rat\", but Korean government prosecutors alleged that Park was making a derogatory statement about the president of South Korea, [[Lee Myung-bak]], the host of the summit. This case led to public outcry and debate on the lack of government tolerance and in support of freedom of expression. The court ruled that the painting, \"an ominous creature like a rat\" amounts to \"an organized criminal activity\" and upheld the fine while denying the prosecution's request for imprisonment for Park.<ref name=wsj/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Graffiti in Asia\">\nTaiwan 2009 HuaLien City Street Art in Poetic Form FRD 8395.jpg|Street art in poetic form in [[Hualien City]], [[Taiwan]]\nSpecial Graffiti Zone in Taipei.JPG|Sign designating a sanctioned graffiti zone in [[Taipei]]\nTsang graffiti.jpg|Street [[graffiti in Hong Kong]]\n201712 Graffiti on a building of Shentangqiao1.jpg|The Graffiti Piece \"Tante\" (by Chen Dongfan) on the surface wall of an old residential building in Hangzhou, Zhejiang\nGraffiti in Haikou near Evergreen Park - 01.JPG|In [[Haikou]], Hainan\n</gallery>\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n[[File:Graffiti removal berlin.jpg|thumb|upright|Graffiti removal in Berlin]]\n\nIn Europe, community cleaning squads have responded to graffiti, in some cases with reckless abandon, as when in 1992 in France a local Scout group, attempting to remove modern graffiti, damaged [https://web.archive.org/web/20171109194433/http://www.panoramio.com/photo/26895452 two prehistoric paintings] of [[bison]] in the [[Cave of Mayri\u00e8re sup\u00e9rieure]] near the French village of [[Bruniquel]] in [[Tarn-et-Garonne]], earning them the 1992 [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in [[archeology]].<ref name=improb/>\n\nIn September 2006, the European Parliament directed the European Commission to create urban environment policies to prevent and eliminate dirt, litter, graffiti, animal excrement, and excessive noise from domestic and vehicular music systems in European cities, along with other concerns over urban life.<ref name=europa/>\n\nThe [[Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003]] became Britain's latest anti-graffiti legislation. In August 2004, the [[Keep Britain Tidy]] campaign issued a press release calling for [[zero tolerance]] of graffiti and supporting proposals such as issuing \"on the spot\" [[Fine (penalty)|fine]]s to graffiti offenders and banning the sale of aerosol paint to anyone under the age of 16.<ref name=encams/> The press release also condemned the use of graffiti images in advertising and in [[music video]]s, arguing that real-world experience of graffiti stood far removed from its often-portrayed 'cool' or 'edgy' image.\n\nTo back the campaign, 123 [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s (including then [[Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]]), signed a charter which stated: \"Graffiti is not art, it's crime.

One early example is the \"Graffiti Tunnel\" located at the [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]] Campus of the [[University of Sydney]], which is available for use by any student at the university to tag, advertise, poster, and create \"art\". Advocates of this idea suggest that this discourages petty vandalism yet encourages artists to take their time and produce great art, without worry of being caught or arrested for vandalism or [[trespassing]].<ref name=warrin/><ref name=abc/> Others disagree with this approach, arguing that the presence of legal graffiti walls does not demonstrably reduce illegal graffiti elsewhere.<ref name=towno/> Some local government areas throughout Australia have introduced \"anti-graffiti squads\", who clean graffiti in the area, and such crews as BCW (Buffers Can't Win) have taken steps to keep one step ahead of local graffiti cleaners.\n\nMany state governments have banned the sale or possession of spray paint to those under the age of 18 (age of majority). However, a number of local governments in Victoria have taken steps to recognize the cultural heritage value of some examples of graffiti, such as prominent political graffiti. Tough new graffiti laws have been introduced in Australia with fines of up to A$26,000 and two years in prison.\n\n[[Melbourne]] is a prominent graffiti city of Australia with many of its lanes being tourist attractions, such as [[Hosier Lane, Melbourne|Hosier Lane]] in particular, a popular destination for photographers, wedding photography, and backdrops for corporate print advertising. The [[Lonely Planet]] travel guide cites Melbourne's street as a major attraction. All forms of graffiti, including [[sticker]] art, [[poster]], [[stencil]] art, and [[wheatpasting]], can be found in many places throughout the city. Prominent street art precincts include; [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]], [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], [[Northcote, Victoria|Northcote]], [[Brunswick, Victoria|Brunswick]], [[St Kilda, Victoria|St. Kilda]], and the CBD, where stencil and sticker art is prominent. As one moves farther away from the city, mostly along suburban train lines, graffiti tags become more prominent. Many international artists such as Banksy have left their work in Melbourne and in early 2008 a [[perspex]] screen was installed to prevent a Banksy stencil art piece from being destroyed, it has survived since 2003 through the respect of local street artists avoiding posting over it, although it has recently had paint tipped over it.<ref name=wato/>\n\n=== New Zealand ===\n\n[[File:Christchurch Stock Yards.jpg|thumb|Former Christchurch stock yards]]\n\nIn February 2008 [[Helen Clark]], the New Zealand prime minister at that time, announced a government crackdown on tagging and other forms of graffiti vandalism, describing it as a destructive crime representing an invasion of public and private property. New legislation subsequently adopted included a ban on the sale of paint spray cans to persons under 18 and increases in maximum fines for the offence from NZ$200 to NZ$2,000 or extended community service. The issue of tagging become a widely debated one following an incident in [[Auckland]] during January 2008 in which a middle-aged property owner stabbed one of two teenage taggers to death and was subsequently convicted of [[manslaughter]].\n\n=== United States ===\n\n[[Image:Elevator graffiti.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An elevator position indicator with scratch graffiti]]\n{{Main|Graffiti in the United States}}\n\n==== Tracker databases ====\n\nGraffiti databases have increased in the past decade because they allow vandalism incidents to be fully documented against an offender and help the police and prosecution charge and prosecute offenders for multiple counts of vandalism. They also provide law enforcement the ability to rapidly search for an offender's moniker or tag in a simple, effective, and comprehensive way. These systems can also help track costs of damage to city to help allocate an anti-graffiti budget. The theory is that when an offender is caught putting up graffiti, they are not just charged with one count of vandalism; they can be held accountable for all the other damage for which they are responsible. This has two main benefits for law enforcement. One, it sends a signal to the offenders that their vandalism is being tracked. Two, a city can seek restitution from offenders for all the damage that they have committed, not merely a single incident. These systems give law enforcement personnel real-time, street-level intelligence that allows them not only to focus on the worst graffiti offenders and their damage, but also to monitor potential gang violence that is associated with the graffiti.<ref name=crcp/>\n\n==== Gang injunctions ====\n\nMany restrictions of civil gang injunctions are designed to help address and protect the physical environment and limit graffiti. Provisions of gang injunctions include things such as restricting the possession of marker pens, spray paint cans, or other sharp objects capable of defacing private or public property; spray painting, or marking with marker pens, scratching, applying stickers, or otherwise applying graffiti on any public or private property, including, but not limited to the street, alley, residences, block walls, and fences, vehicles or any other real or personal property. Some injunctions contain wording that restricts damaging or vandalizing both public and private property, including but not limited to any vehicle, light fixture, door, fence, wall, gate, window, building, street sign, utility box, telephone box, tree, or power pole.<ref name=crcp2 />\n\n==== Hotlines and reward programs ====\n\nTo help address many of these issues, many local jurisdictions have set up graffiti abatement hotlines, where citizens can call in and report vandalism and have it removed. San Diego's hotline receives more than 5,000 calls per year, in addition to reporting the graffiti, callers can learn more about prevention. One of the complaints about these hotlines is the response time; there is often a lag time between a property owner calling about the graffiti and its removal. The length of delay should be a consideration for any jurisdiction planning on operating a hotline. Local jurisdictions must convince the callers that their complaint of vandalism will be a priority and cleaned off right away. If the jurisdiction does not have the resources to respond to complaints in a timely manner, the value of the hotline diminishes. Crews must be able to respond to individual service calls made to the graffiti hotline as well as focus on cleanup near schools, parks, and major intersections and transit routes to have the biggest impact. Some cities offer a reward for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of suspects for tagging or graffiti related vandalism.

In most countries, marking or painting property without permission is considered by property owners and civic authorities as defacement and [[vandalism]], which is a punishable crime, citing the use of graffiti by street gangs to mark territory or to serve as an indicator of gang-related activities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/get_informed/content_basic_view/23471|title=Why Gang Graffiti Is Dangerous - Los Angeles Police Department|website=www.lapdonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref> Graffiti has become visualized as a growing urban \u2018problem\u2019 for many cities in industrialized nations, spreading from the [[New York City Subway nomenclature|New York City subway]] system in the early 1970s to the rest of the United States and Europe and other world regions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R.

He started out as a street graffiti artist chased by authorities, and later one of his paintings sold for over $100,000,000.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n[[File:Graffiti signature commemorating Union of Lublin 01.jpg|thumb|1569 scratched graffiti in the [[Chapel of the Holy Trinity, Lublin Castle|Holy Trinity Chapel]] in [[Lublin]], commemorating [[Union of Lublin]]]]\n\nBoth \"graffiti\" and its occasional singular form \"graffito\" are from the Italian word ''graffiato'' (\"scratched\"). \"Graffiti\" is applied in [[art history]] to works of art produced by scratching a design into a surface. A related term is \"[[sgraffito]]\",<ref name=grant/> which involves scratching through one layer of pigment to reveal another beneath it. This technique was primarily used by potters who would glaze their wares and then scratch a design into it. In ancient times graffiti were carved on walls with a sharp object, although sometimes [[chalk]] or [[coal]] were used. The word originates from Greek {{lang|el|\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd}}\u2014''graphein''\u2014meaning \"to write\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/graffiti|title=graffiti {{!}} Origin and meaning of graffiti by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Graffitti, Castellania, Malta.jpeg|thumb|left|Figure graffito, similar to a relief, at the Castellania, in Valletta]]\n\nThe term ''graffiti'' referred to the [[inscription]]s, figure drawings, and such, found on the walls of ancient [[sepulchre]]s or ruins, as in the [[Catacombs of Rome]] or at [[Pompeii]]. Use of the word has evolved to include any graphics applied to surfaces in a manner that constitutes [[vandalism]].<ref>{{cite web|title=How Old Is Graffiti?|url=http://wonderopolis.org/wonder/how-old-is-graffiti/|website=Wonderopolis|accessdate=24 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe only known source of the [[Safaitic]] language, a form of proto-Arabic, is from graffiti: inscriptions scratched on to the surface of rocks and boulders in the predominantly basalt desert of southern [[Syria]], eastern [[Jordan]] and northern [[Saudi Arabia]].

Local guides say it is an advertisement for [[prostitution]]. Located near a [[mosaic]] and stone walkway, the graffiti shows a handprint that vaguely resembles a heart, along with a footprint, a number, and a carved image of a woman's head.\n\nThe [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] carved graffiti on walls and monuments, examples of which also survive in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. Graffiti in the classical world had different connotations than they carry in today's society concerning content. Ancient graffiti displayed phrases of love declarations, political rhetoric, and simple words of thought, compared to today's popular messages of social and political ideals<ref name=ancel/>\nThe eruption of [[Vesuvius]] preserved graffiti in [[Pompeii]], which includes [[Latin]] curses, magic spells, declarations of love, alphabets, political slogans, and famous literary quotes, providing insight into ancient Roman street life. One inscription gives the address of a woman named Novellia Primigenia of Nuceria, a prostitute, apparently of great beauty, whose services were much in demand. Another shows a [[phallus]] accompanied by the text, ''mansueta tene'' (\"handle with care\").\n\nDisappointed love also found its way onto walls in antiquity:\n\n{{poemquote|\n''Quisquis amat. veniat. Veneri volo frangere costas''\n''fustibus et lumbos debilitare deae.''\n''Si potest illa mihi tenerum pertundere pectus''\n''quit ego non possim caput illae frangere fuste?''\n\nWhoever loves, go to hell.

Etched on the surface of the Mirror Wall, they contain pieces of prose, poetry, and commentary. The majority of these visitors appear to have been from the elite of society: royalty, officials, professions, and clergy. There were also soldiers, archers, and even some metalworkers. The topics range from love to satire, curses, wit, and lament. Many demonstrate a very high level of literacy and a deep appreciation of art and poetry.<ref name=ponnam/> Most of the graffiti refer to the frescoes of semi-nude females found there. One reads:\n\n{{poemquote|Wet with cool dew drops\nfragrant with perfume from the flowers\ncame the gentle breeze\njasmine and water lily\ndance in the spring sunshine\nside-long glances\nof the golden-hued ladies\nstab into my thoughts\nheaven itself cannot take my mind\nas it has been captivated by one lass\namong the five hundred I have seen here.<ref name=parana/>}}\n\nAmong the ancient political graffiti examples were [[Arab]] satirist poems. Yazid al-Himyari, an [[Umayyad]] [[Arab]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] poet, was most known for writing his political poetry on the walls between [[Sistan|Sajistan]] and [[Basra]], manifesting a strong hatred towards the [[Umayyad]] regime and its ''[[wali]]s'', and people used to read and circulate them very widely.<ref>\u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u0631\u0648\u0651\u0629\u060c '''\u062a\u0631\u0627\u062b\u0646\u0627 \u0643\u064a\u0641 \u0646\u0639\u0631\u0641\u0647'''\u060c \u0645\u0624\u0633\u0633\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0628\u062d\u0627\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0628\u064a\u0631\u0648\u062a\u060c 1986{{clarify|date=October 2014}}</ref>{{clarify|date=October 2014}}\n\n=== Level of literacy often evident in graffiti ===\n\nHistoric forms of graffiti have helped gain understanding into the lifestyles and languages of past cultures. Errors in spelling and grammar in these graffiti offer insight into the degree of literacy in Roman times and provide clues on the pronunciation of spoken Latin. Examples are ''CIL'' IV, 7838: ''Vettium Firmum / aed''[ilem] ''quactiliar''[ii] {{sic}} ''rog''[ant]. Here, \"qu\" is pronounced \"co\". The 83 pieces of graffiti found at ''CIL'' IV, 4706-85 are evidence of the ability to read and write at levels of society where literacy might not be expected. The graffiti appear on a [[peristyle]] which was being remodeled at the time of the eruption of Vesuvius by the architect [[Crescens]]. The graffiti were left by both the foreman and his workers. The brothel at ''CIL'' VII, 12, 18\u201320 contains more than 120 pieces of graffiti, some of which were the work of the prostitutes and their clients. The [[gladiator]]ial academy at ''CIL'' IV, 4397 was scrawled with graffiti left by the gladiator Celadus Crescens (''Suspirium puellarum Celadus thraex'': \"Celadus the [[Thracians|Thracian]] makes the girls sigh.\")\n\nAnother piece from Pompeii, written on a tavern wall about the owner of the establishment and his questionable wine:\n\n{{poemquote|\nLandlord, may your lies malign\nBring destruction on your head!\nYou yourself drink unmixed wine,\nWater [do you] sell [to] your guests instead.<ref name=olmert/>}}\n\nIt was not only the Greeks and Romans who produced graffiti: the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] site of [[Tikal]] in [[Guatemala]] contains examples of [[ancient Maya graffiti]]. [[Viking]] graffiti survive in Rome and at [[Newgrange|Newgrange Mound]] in Ireland, and a [[Varangian]] scratched his name (Halvdan) in [[Runic alphabet|rune]]s on a [[banister]] in the [[Hagia Sophia]] at [[Constantinople]]. These early forms of graffiti have contributed to the understanding of lifestyles and languages of past cultures.\n\nGraffiti, known as Tacherons, were frequently scratched on Romanesque Scandinavian church walls.<ref name=green/>\nWhen [[Renaissance]] artists such as [[Pinturicchio]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], or [[Filippino Lippi]] descended into the ruins of Nero's [[Domus Aurea]], they carved or painted their names and returned to initiate the ''[[grottesche]]'' style of decoration.<ref name=\"archeology\"/><ref name=\"atlantic\"/>\n\nThere are also examples of graffiti occurring in American history, such as [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]], a national landmark along the [[Oregon Trail]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Independence Rock - California National Historic Trail (National Park Service)|url=https://www.nps.gov/cali/planyourvisit/site5.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=18 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nLater, French soldiers carved their names on monuments during the Napoleonic [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1798|campaign of Egypt]] in the 1790s.<ref name=JinxArtCrimes/> [[Lord Byron]]'s survives on one of the columns of the Temple of [[Poseidon]] at [[Cape Sounion]] in [[Attica]], Greece.<ref name=shanks/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Ancient graffiti\">\nRufus est caricature villa misteri Pompeii.jpg|Ancient [[Pompeii]] graffito [[caricature]] of a politician\n2487(Admiror paries).jpg|Ironic wall inscription commenting on boring graffiti\nJesus graffito.jpg|Satirical [[Alexamenos graffito]], possibly the earliest known [[representation of Jesus]]\nAncientgrafS.jpg|Graffiti, [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]]\nCrusader Graffiti in the Church of the holy supulchure Jerusalem Victor 2011 -1-21.jpg|Crusader graffiti in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre\nHagia-sofia-viking.jpg|[[Viking]] [[mercenary]] graffiti at the [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Istanbul, Turkey]]\nSigiriya-graffiti.jpg|Graffiti on the [[Sigiriya#Mirror wall|Mirror Wall]], [[Sigiriya]], [[Sri Lanka]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Contemporary graffiti ==\n\nContemporary graffiti style has been heavily influenced by [[hip hop culture]] <ref name=\"genius-paul-edwards-hiphopbook\">{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/Paul-edwards-is-graffiti-really-an-element-of-hip-hop-book-excerpt-annotated|title=Is Graffiti Really An Element Of Hip-Hop?

Graffiti have long appeared on building walls, in [[latrine]]s, railroad [[boxcar]]s, [[rapid transit|subways]], and bridges.\n\nThe oldest known example of modern graffiti are the [[Moniker (graffiti)|\"monikers\"]] found on traincars created by hobos and railworkers since the late 1800s. The Bozo Texino monikers were documented by filmmaker [[Bill Daniel (filmmaker)|Bill Daniel]] in his 2005 film, ''Who is Bozo Texino?''.<ref name=\"bozo-texino-walker\">{{cite web|url=https://walkerart.org/calendar/2010/who-is-bozo-texino|title=Who Is Bozo Texino?|date=22 July 2010|accessdate=23 August 2018|first=Bill|last=Daniel}}</ref><ref name=\"bozo-texino-film\">{{cite web|url=http://www.billdaniel.net/who-is-bozo-texino/|title=Who Is Bozo Texino?|date=2005|work=Who Is Bozo Texino?

In [[World War II]], an inscription on a wall at the fortress of [[Verdun]] was seen as an illustration of the US response twice in a generation to the wrongs of the Old World:<ref name=reagan/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/14/opinion/words-from-a-war.html|title=Words From a War|date=14 August 1985|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{poemquote|\nAustin White \u2013 Chicago, Ill \u2013 1918\nAustin White \u2013 Chicago, Ill \u2013 1945\nThis is the last time I want to write my name here.}}\n\nDuring World War II and for decades after, the phrase \"[[Kilroy was here]]\" with an accompanying illustration was widespread throughout the world, due to its use by American troops and ultimately filtering into American popular culture. Shortly after the death of [[Charlie Parker]] (nicknamed \"Yardbird\" or \"Bird\"), graffiti began appearing around New York with the words \"Bird Lives\".<ref name=russel /> The student protests and general strike of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] saw Paris bedecked in revolutionary, anarchistic, and situationist slogans such as ''L'ennui est contre-r\u00e9volutionnaire'' (\"Boredom is counterrevolutionary\") expressed in painted graffiti, [[poster]] art, and [[stencil]] art. At the time in the US, other political phrases (such as \"Free Huey\" about [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] [[Huey Newton]]) became briefly popular as graffiti in limited areas, only to be forgotten. A popular graffito of the early 1970s was \"Dick [[Richard Milhous Nixon|Nixon]] Before He Dicks You\", reflecting the hostility of the youth culture to that US president.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"World War II graffiti\">\nBundesarchiv Bild 101I-309-0816-20A, Italien, Soldat zeichnend.jpg|Soldier with tropical fantasy graffiti (1943\u20131944)\nGraffiti inside the ruins of the German Reichstag building.jpg|Soviet Army graffiti in the ruins of the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] in [[Berlin]] (1945)\nKilroy Was Here - Washington DC WWII Memorial - Jason Coyne.jpg|Permanent engraving of [[Kilroy was here|Kilroy]] on the [[National World War II Memorial|World War II Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Advent of aerosol paint ===\n\nRock and roll graffiti is a significant subgenre. A famous graffito of the twentieth century was the inscription in the London tube reading \"Clapton is God\" in a link to the guitarist [[Eric Clapton]]. The phrase was spray-painted by an admirer on a wall in an [[Islington]] station on the [[London Underground|Underground]] in the autumn of 1967. The graffito was captured in a photograph, in which a dog is [[Urine marking#Canidae|urinating on the wall]].\n\nGraffiti also became associated with the anti-establishment [[punk rock]] movement beginning in the 1970s. Bands such as [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and [[Crass]] (and their followers) widely [[stencil]]ed their names and logos, while many punk night clubs, squats, and hangouts are famous for their graffiti. In the late 1980s the upside down Martini glass that was the tag for punk band [[Missing Foundation]] was the most ubiquitous graffito in lower Manhattan{{According to whom|date=March 2019}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Early spray-painted graffiti\">\nNYC R36 1 subway car.png|[[New York City Subway]] trains were covered in graffiti (1973)\nGRAFFITI ON A WALL IN CHICAGO.

For many outside of New York, it was their first encounter with their art form. Fab{{nbsp}}5 Freddy's friendship with [[Debbie Harry]] influenced [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s single \"[[Rapture (Blondie song)|Rapture]]\" ([[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]], 1981), the video of which featured [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], and offered many their first glimpse of a depiction of elements of graffiti in hip hop culture. JaJaJa toured Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, and Holland with a large graffiti canvas as a backdrop.<ref name=chesh/> Charlie Ahearn's independently released fiction film ''[[Wild Style]]'' (Wild Style, 1983), the early [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary ''[[Style Wars]]'' (1983), hit songs such as \"[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]\" and \"[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]\" and their accompanying [[music video]]s (both 1982) contributed to a growing interest outside New York in all aspects of hip hop.<ref name=\"genius-paul-edwards-hiphopbook\" />\n\n''Style Wars'' depicted not only famous graffitists such as Skeme, [[DONDI|Dondi]], MinOne, and [[Zephyr (artist)|ZEPHYR]], but also reinforced graffiti's role within New York's emerging hip-hop culture by incorporating famous early break-dancing groups such as Rock Steady Crew into the film and featuring rap in the soundtrack. Although many officers of the New York City Police Department found this film to be controversial, Style Wars is still recognized as the most prolific film representation of what was going on within the young hip hop culture of the early 1980s.<ref name=labonte/> Fab{{nbsp}}5 Freddy and Futura 2000 took hip hop graffiti to Paris and London as part of the New York City Rap Tour in 1983.<ref name=hershk/> Hollywood also paid attention, consulting writers such as [[PHASE 2]] as it depicted the culture and gave it international exposure in movies such as ''[[Beat Street]]'' ([[Orion Pictures|Orion]], 1984).\n\n=== Stencil graffiti emerges ===\n\nThis period also saw the emergence of the new [[stencil graffiti]] genre. Some of the first examples were created in 1981 by graffitists [[Blek le Rat]] in Paris, in 1982 by [[Jef Aerosol]] in Tours (France);{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} by 1985 stencils had appeared in other cities including New York City, Sydney, and [[Melbourne]], where they were documented by American photographer Charles Gatewood and Australian photographer Rennie Ellis.<ref name=ellis/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Stencil graffiti\">\nTankStencil.jpg|Modern [[stencil graffiti]], a very common style, in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada\nbanksy.on.the.thekla.arp.jpg|Stencil by [[Banksy]] on the waterline of [[Old Profanity Showboat (Thekla)|The Thekla]], an entertainment boat in central [[Bristol]]\nI-barc.JPG|Stencil in [[Barcelona]], Spain\nGraffiti in Tartu 03.JPG|Stencil graffito by [[Edward von L\u00f5ngus]] in [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]], that takes a popular children's book character and manipulates it to produce a social-critical work about the [[war on drugs]]\nGraffiti in Lisbon.jpg|Graffiti in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Graffiti as a memorial ===\n\nPeople often leave their traces in wet cement or concrete. This type of graffito often commemorates the mutual commitment of a couple, or simply records a person's presence at a particular moment. Often this type of graffito is dated and is left untouched for decades, offering a look into local historical minutiae.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Commercialization and entrance into mainstream pop culture ===\n\n{{Main|Commercial graffiti}}\n\nWith the popularity and legitimization of graffiti has come a level of commercialization. In 2001, computer giant [[IBM]] launched an advertising campaign in Chicago and San Francisco which involved people spray painting on sidewalks a [[peace symbol]], a [[Heart (symbol)|heart]], and a [[penguin]] ([[Linux]] [[mascot]]), to represent \"Peace, Love, and Linux.\" IBM paid Chicago and San Francisco collectively US$120,000 for punitive damages and clean-up costs.<ref name=guerilla/><ref name=wired/>\n\nIn 2005, a similar ad campaign was launched by [[Sony]] and executed by its advertising agency in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Miami, to market its handheld [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] gaming system. In [[PlayStation Portable#Controversial advertising campaigns|this campaign]], taking notice of the legal problems of the IBM campaign, Sony paid building owners for the rights to paint on their buildings \"a collection of dizzy-eyed urban kids playing with the PSP as if it were a skateboard, a paddle, or a rocking horse\".<ref name=wired/>\n\n=== Advocates ===\n\n[[Marc Ecko]], an urban clothing designer, has been an advocate of graffiti as an art form during this period, stating that \"Graffiti is without question the most powerful art movement in recent history and has been a driving inspiration throughout my career.\"<ref name=sohh/>\n\nGraffiti have become a common stepping stone for many members of both the [[art and design]] communities in North America and abroad. Within the United States graffitists such as Mike Giant, Pursue, Rime, Noah, and countless others have made careers in skateboard, apparel, and shoe design for companies such as DC Shoes, Adidas, Rebel8, Osiris, or Circa<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Meanwhile, there are many others such as DZINE, Daze, Blade, and The Mac who have made the switch to being gallery artists, often not even using their initial medium, spray paint.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Yarnbus.jpg|thumb|This bus has been [[yarn bombing|yarn bombed]] by a team of knitters. {{Deletable image-caption|date=May 2012}}]] -->\n\n=== Global developments ===\n==== South America ====\n\nTristan Manco wrote that Brazil \"boasts a unique and particularly rich, graffiti scene&nbsp;... [earning] it an international reputation as the place to go for artistic inspiration.\" Graffiti \"flourishes in every conceivable space in Brazil's cities.\" Artistic parallels \"are often drawn between the energy of S\u00e3o Paulo today and 1970s New York.\" The \"sprawling metropolis,\" of S\u00e3o Paulo has \"become the new shrine to graffiti;\" Manco alludes to \"poverty and unemployment&nbsp;... [and] the epic struggles and conditions of the country's marginalised peoples,\" and to \"Brazil's chronic poverty,\" as the main engines that \"have fuelled a vibrant graffiti culture.\" In world terms, Brazil has \"one of the most uneven distributions of income. Laws and taxes change frequently.\" Such factors, Manco argues, contribute to a very fluid society, riven with those economic divisions and social tensions that underpin and feed the \"folkloric vandalism and an urban sport for the disenfranchised,\" that is South American graffiti art.<ref name=manco7/>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:IMG 6754 3.jpg|thumb|Poetry graffiti in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]]] -->[[File:Graffiti in Tel Aviv, Israel.jpg|thumb|180px|A graffiti piece found in Tel Aviv by the artist DeDe]]\nProminent Brazilian graffitists include [[Os G\u00eameos]], Boleta, [[Francisco Rodrigues da Silva|Nunca]], Nina, Speto, Tikka, and T.Freak.<ref name=globo/> Their artistic success and involvement in commercial design ventures<ref name=nicek/> has highlighted divisions within the Brazilian graffiti community between adherents of the cruder transgressive form of ''picha\u00e7\u00e3o'' and the more conventionally artistic values of the practitioners of ''grafite''.<ref name=revela/>\n\n==== Middle East ====\n\nGraffiti in the [[Middle East]] is emerging slowly, with pockets of taggers operating in the various 'Emirates' of the [[United Arab Emirates]], in [[Israel]], and in [[Iran]]. The major Iranian newspaper ''[[Hamshahri]]'' has published two articles on illegal writers in the city with photographic coverage of Iranian artist [[A1one]]'s works on Tehran walls. Tokyo-based design magazine, ''PingMag'', has interviewed A1one and featured photographs of his work.<ref name=pinmag/> The [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] has become a site for graffiti, reminiscent in this sense of the [[Berlin Wall]]. Many graffitists in Israel come from other places around the globe, such as JUIF from Los Angeles and DEVIONE from London. The religious reference \"\u05e0 \u05e0\u05d7 \u05e0\u05d7\u05de \u05e0\u05d7\u05de\u05df \u05de\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05df\" (\"[[Na Nach Nachma Nachman Meuman]]\") is commonly seen in graffiti around Israel.\n\n==== Southeast Asia ====\n\nThere are also a large number of graffiti influences in [[Southeast Asia]]n countries that mostly come from modern [[Western culture]], such as Malaysia, where graffiti have long been a common sight in Malaysia's capital city, [[Kuala Lumpur]]. Since 2010, the country has begun hosting a street festival to encourage all generations and people from all walks of life to enjoy and encourage Malaysian street culture.<ref name=kharbar/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Graffiti around the world\">\nGrafiti, \u010cakovec (Croatia).2.jpg|Graffiti on a wall in [[\u010cakovec]], [[Croatia]]\nGraffiti in Budapest, Pestszentl\u0151rinc.jpg|Graffiti of the character [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] on a wall in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]\nMAAU-SP.jpg|Open Museum of Urban Art of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\nGraffiti in Ho Chi Minh City.JPG|Graffiti in [[Ho Chi Minh City]], [[Vietnam]]\nTehranurbanartalone.jpg|Graffiti in [[Tehran, Iran]]\nMr. Wany's work-in-progress artwork for Kul Sign Festival.JPG|Graffiti art in [[Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia]]\nGraffiti in Upper Manhattan November 3, 2013.jpg|Graffiti on a retaining wall in [[Upper Manhattan]]\nGraffiti in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.jpg|Graffiti in [[Yogyakarta]], [[Indonesia]]\nGraffiti in Bangkok 12.jpg|Graffiti in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Characteristics of common graffiti ==\n\n{{See also|Graffiti terminology|Graffiti in the United States}}\n\n=== Methods and production ===\n\nThe modern-day graffitists can be found with an arsenal of various materials that allow for a successful production of a piece.<ref name=nicolas/> This includes such techniques as [[Scribing (graffiti)|scribing]]. However, [[spray paint]] in aerosol cans is the number one medium for graffiti. From this commodity comes different styles, technique, and abilities to form master works of graffiti. Spray paint can be found at hardware and art stores and comes in virtually every color.\n\n[[Stencil graffiti]] is created by cutting out shapes and designs in a stiff material (such as [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]] or subject [[File folder|folder]]s) to form an overall design or image. The stencil is then placed on the \"canvas\" gently and with quick, easy strokes of the aerosol can, the image begins to appear on the intended surface.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Graffiti making\">\nFile:Vlg shop.jpg|The first graffiti shop in Russia was opened in 1992 in [[Tver]]\nFile:Eurofestival graffiti 2.jpg|Graffiti application at Eurofestival in [[Turku]], Finland\nFile:Graffity in the making...(On a wall at Thrissur) CIMG9868.JPG|Graffiti application in India using natural pigments (mostly [[charcoal]], plant [[sap]]s, and dirt)\nFile:Graffity in the making...(On a wall at Thrissur) CIMG9873.jpg|Completed landscape scene, in [[Thrissur]], [[Kerala]], India\nFile:Leake Street TQ3079 352.JPG|A graffiti artist at work in London\n</gallery>\n\n=== Modern experimentation ===\n\n[[File:Knitted graffiti 1.jpg|thumb|right|Knitted graffiti in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]]]]\n[[File:Spiderweb Yarnbomb Installation by Stephen Duneier.JPG|thumbnail|Spiderweb Yarnbomb Installation by Stephen Duneier both hides and highlights previous graffiti.]]\n\nModern graffiti art often incorporates additional arts and technologies. For example, [[Graffiti Research Lab]] has encouraged the use of projected images and magnetic light-emitting diodes ([[LED art|throwies]]) as new media for graffitists. [[Yarnbombing]] is another recent form of graffiti. Yarnbombers occasionally target previous graffiti for modification, which had been avoided among the majority of graffitists.\n\n=== Tagging ===\n\n[[File:Tag by Spore.jpg|thumb|A tag in [[Dallas]], reading \"Spore\"]]\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\n[[File:Grafitti on Class 376 train at Cannon Street.jpg|thumb|A tagged {{BRC|376}} train at [[Cannon Street station]]]]\n\nSome of the most common styles of graffiti have their own names. A '''tag''' is the most basic writing of an artist's name; it is simply a [[handstyle]]. A graffiti writer's tag is his or her personalized signature. Tagging is often the example given when opponents of graffiti refer to any acts of handstyle graffiti writing (it is by far the most common form of graffiti). Tags can contain subtle and sometimes cryptic messages, and may incorporate the artist's crew initials or other letters.\n\nOne form of tagging, known as '''pissing''', involves taking a refillable fire-extinguisher and replacing the contents with paint, allowing for tags as high as approximately {{convert|20|ft|m}}. Aiming and keeping a handstyle steady in this form of tagging is very difficult, usually coming out wavy and sloppy.\n\nAnother form is the '''throw-up''', also known as a '''bombing''', which is normally painted very quickly with two or three colors, sacrificing aesthetics for speed. Throw-ups can also be outlined on a surface with one color. A '''piece''' is a more elaborate representation of the artist's name, incorporating more stylized letters, usually incorporating a much larger range of colors. This is more time-consuming and increases the likelihood of the artist getting caught. \n[[File: Graffiti under a bridge in Poland.jpg|thumb|Throw-ups and a piece under a railway bridge in [[Poland]].]]\n\nA '''blockbuster''' or '''roller''' is a large piece, almost always done in a block-shaped style, done simply to cover a large area solidly with two contrasting colors, sometimes with the whole purpose of blocking other writers from painting on the same wall. These are usually accomplished with extended paint rollers and gallons of cheap exterior paint.\n\nA more complex style is '''[[wildstyle]]''', a form of graffiti usually involving interlocking letters and connecting points. These pieces are often harder to read by non-graffitists as the letters merge into one another in an often-undecipherable manner.\n\nSome artists also use self-adhesive '''stickers''' as a quick way to do catch ups. While certain critics from within graffiti culture consider this lazy, stickers can be quite detailed in their own right and often, are used in conjunction with other materials. Sticker tags are commonly executed on blank postage stickers, as these can easily be acquired with no cost on the writer's part.\n\nMany graffitists believe that doing complex pieces involves too great an investment of time to justify the practice. Doing a piece can take (depending on experience and size) from 30 minutes to months on end, as was the case for [[Saber (artist)|Saber]] MSK while working on the world's largest graffiti piece on the LA river.\n\nAnother graffitists can go over a piece in a matter of minutes with a simple throw-up. This was exemplified by the writer \"CAP\" in the documentary ''[[Style Wars]]'', who, other writers complain, ruins pieces with his quick throw ups. This became known as '''capping''' and often is done when there is a \"beef\", or conflict between writers.\n\nA number of recent examples of graffiti make use of [[hashtags]].<ref>[http://news.fitzrovia.org.uk/2015/07/23/hashtag-on-the-pavement-connects-with-fitzrovias-past/] \"Hashtag on the pavement connects with Fitzrovia's past\", Fitzrovia News, 23 July 2015, Retrieved 17 January 2016</ref><ref>[http://massappeal.com/riskrock-graffiti-in-san-francisco/] \"#RISKROCK #GRAFFITI IN #SANFRANCISCO\", Mass Appeal, Retrieved 17 January 2016.</ref>\n{{wide image|Graffiti i bagg\u00e5rd i \u00e5rhus 2c.jpg|1300px|align-cap=center|Densely-tagged parking area in [[\u00c5rhus]], Denmark|center|}}\n\n== Uses ==\n\nTheories on the use of graffiti by [[avant-garde]] artists have a history dating back at least to the [[Asger Jorn]], who in 1962 painting declared in a graffiti-like gesture \"the avant-garde won't give up\".<ref>{{cite book | title=Expression as vandalism: Asger Jorn's \"Modifications\" | publisher=The University of Chicago Press | author=Karen Kurczynski | year=2008 | pages=293}}</ref>\n\nMany contemporary analysts and even art critics have begun to see artistic value in some graffiti and to recognize it as a form of [[public art]]. According to many art researchers, particularly in the Netherlands and in Los Angeles, that type of public art is, in fact an effective tool of social [[political emancipation|emancipation]] or, in the achievement of a political goal.<ref name=thimar/>\n\nIn times of conflict, such murals have offered a means of communication and self-expression for members of these socially, ethnically, or racially divided communities, and have proven themselves as effective tools in establishing dialog and thus, of addressing cleavages in the long run. The [[Berlin Wall]] was also extensively covered by graffiti reflecting social pressures relating to the oppressive [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule over the [[East Germany|GDR]].\n\nMany artists involved with graffiti are also concerned with the similar activity of [[stenciling]]. Essentially, this entails stenciling a print of one or more colors using spray-paint. Recognized while [[Art exhibition|exhibiting]] and publishing several of her coloured stencils and paintings portraying the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] and [[Urban area|urban Britain]] in the early 2000s, graffitists [[M.I.A. (artist)|Mathangi Arulpragasam, aka M.I.A.]], has also become known for integrating her imagery of political violence into her [[music videos]] for singles \"[[Galang (song)|Galang]]\" and \"[[Bucky Done Gun]]\", and her cover art. Stickers of her artwork also often appear around places such as London in [[Brick Lane]], stuck to lamp posts and street signs, she having become a muse for other graffitists and painters worldwide in cities including [[Seville]].\n\n=== Personal expression ===\n\nMany graffitists choose to protect their identities and remain anonymous or to hinder prosecution.\n\nWith the commercialization of graffiti (and [[hip hop]] in general), in most cases, even with legally painted \"graffiti\" art, graffitists tend to choose anonymity. This may be attributed to various reasons or a combination of reasons. Graffiti still remains the [[hip hop#Cultural pillars|one of four hip hop elements]] that is not considered \"performance art\" despite the image of the \"singing and dancing star\" that sells hip hop culture to the mainstream. Being a graphic form of art, it might also be said that many graffitists still fall in the category of the [[Extraversion and introversion#Introversion|introverted archetypal artist]].\n\n[[Banksy]] is one of the world's most notorious and popular street artists who continues to remain faceless in today's society.<ref name=banksy/> He is known for his political, anti-war stencil art mainly in [[Bristol, England]], but his work may be seen anywhere from Los Angeles to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. In the UK, Banksy is the most recognizable icon for this cultural artistic movement and keeps his identity a secret to avoid arrest. Much of Banksy's artwork may be seen around the streets of London and surrounding suburbs, although he has painted pictures throughout the world, including the Middle East, where he has painted on Israel's controversial [[West Bank]] barrier with satirical images of life on the other side. One depicted a hole in the wall with an idyllic beach, while another shows a mountain landscape on the other side. A number of [[Art exhibition|exhibitions]] also have taken place since 2000, and recent works of art have fetched vast sums of money. Banksy's art is a prime example of the classic controversy: vandalism vs. art. Art supporters endorse his work distributed in urban areas as pieces of art and some councils, such as Bristol and Islington, have officially protected them, while officials of other areas have deemed his work to be vandalism and have removed it.\n\n[[Pixnit]] is another artist who chooses to keep her identity from the general public.<ref name=shaer/> Her work focuses on beauty and design aspects of graffiti as opposed to Banksy's anti-government shock value. Her paintings are often of flower designs above shops and stores in her local urban area of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Some store owners endorse her work and encourage others to do similar work as well. \"One of the pieces was left up above Steve's Kitchen, because it looks pretty awesome\"- Erin Scott, the manager of [[New England Comics]] in [[Allston, Massachusetts]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Personal graffiti\">\nGraffiti at the Temple of Philae (XIII).jpg|Drawing at [[Temple of Philae]], Egypt depicting three men with rods, or staves.\n4091(Quisquis amat).jpg|Inscription in [[Pompeii]] lamenting a frustrated love, \"Whoever loves, let him flourish, let him perish who knows not love, let him perish twice over whoever forbids love.\"\nPost Apocalyptic Zombie Graffiti, Jan 2015.jpg|[[Post-apocalyptic]] despair\nMermaid Sliema.JPG|[[Mermaid]] in [[Sliema]], [[Malta]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Radical and political ===\n\n[[File:M2109 Iraq War Protest (Black Bloc Element).jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|[[Black bloc]] members spray graffiti on a wall during an [[Protests against the Iraq War#March 21, 2009|Iraq War Protest]] in Washington, D.C.]]\n\nGraffiti often has a reputation as part of a subculture that rebels against authority, although the considerations of the practitioners often diverge and can relate to a wide range of attitudes. It can express a political practice and can form just one tool in an array of resistance techniques. One early example includes the [[anarcho-punk]] band [[Crass]], who conducted a campaign of stenciling [[anti-war]], [[anarchism|anarchist]], [[feminism|feminist]], and [[consumerism|anti-consumerist]] messages throughout the [[London Underground]] system during the late 1970s and early 1980s.<ref name=souther/> In [[Amsterdam]] graffiti was a major part of the punk scene. The city was covered with names such as \"De Zoot\", \"Vendex\", and \"Dr Rat\".<ref name=stockho/> To document the graffiti a punk magazine was started that was called ''Gallery Anus''. So when hip hop came to Europe in the early 1980s there was already a vibrant graffiti culture.\n\nThe student protests and general strike of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] saw Paris bedecked in revolutionary, anarchistic, and situationist slogans such as ''L'ennui est contre-r\u00e9volutionnaire'' (\"Boredom is counterrevolutionary\") and ''Lisez moins, vivez plus'' (\"Read less, live more\"). While not exhaustive, the graffiti gave a sense of the 'millenarian' and rebellious spirit, tempered with a good deal of verbal wit, of the strikers.\n\n{{quote box|align=right|width=220px|quote=I think graffiti writing is a way of defining what our generation is like. Excuse the French, we're not a bunch of p---- artists. Traditionally artists have been considered soft and mellow people, a little bit kooky. Maybe we're a little bit more like pirates that way. We defend our territory, whatever space we steal to paint on, we defend it fiercely.|source=\u2014Sandra \"Lady Pink\" Fabara<ref name=chang/>}}\n\nThe developments of graffiti art which took place in art galleries and colleges as well as \"on the street\" or \"underground\", contributed to the resurfacing in the 1990s of a far more overtly politicized art form in the [[subvertising]], [[culture jamming]], or tactical media movements. These movements or styles tend to classify the artists by their relationship to their social and economic contexts, since, in most countries, graffiti art remains illegal in many forms except when using non-permanent paint. Since the 1990s with the rise of [[Street Art]], a growing number of artists are switching to non-permanent paints and non-traditional forms of painting<ref name=\"ziptopia-switch\">{{cite web|url=https://www.zipcar.com/ziptopia/city-living/temporary-street-art-changing-the-graffiti-game|title=Temporary Street Art That's Changing The Graffiti Game|work=Ziptopia|first=STEVEN|last=HARRINGTON |accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"huffpost-streetart\">{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/ron-english/street-art-its-not-meant-_b_5610496.html|title=Street Art: It's Not Meant to be Permanent|work=Huffington Post|first=Ron|last=English|date=6 Dec 2017|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref> for a variety of reasons\u2014but primarily because is it difficult for the police to apprehend them and for the courts to sentence or even convict a person for a protest that is as fleeting and less intrusive than marching in the streets. In some communities, such impermanent works survive longer than works created with permanent paints because the community views the work in the same vein as that of the civil protester who marches in the street\u2014such protest are impermanent, but effective nevertheless.\n\nIn some areas where a number of artists share the impermanence ideal, an informal competition develops: the length of time that a work escapes destruction is viewed as a measure of the respect the work garners in the community. A crude work that deserves little respect would be invariably removed immediately, while the most talented artists might have works last for days.\n\nContemporary practitioners, accordingly, have varied and often conflicting practices. Some individuals, such as [[Alexander Brener]], have used the medium to politicize other art forms, and have used the prison sentences enforced on them as a means of further protest.<ref name=\"voice\" />\nThe practices of anonymous groups and individuals also vary widely, and practitioners by no means always agree with each other's practices. For example, the anti-capitalist art group the [[Space Hijackers]] did a piece in 2004 about the contradiction between the capitalistic elements of Banksy and his use of political [[imagery]].<ref name=\"tanyabaxter-Gallery\">{{cite web|url=http://tanyabaxtercontemporary.com/banksy#!Banksy_Flying_Copper__screen_print_on_paper__100_x_70_cm|title= Banksy |work=Tanya Baxter Contemporary Gallery|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"haynes-banksy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.haynesfineart.com/artists/Banksy--|title= Banksy |work=Haynes Fine Art|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn top of the political aspect of graffiti as a [[Cultural movement|movement]], political groups and individuals may also use graffiti as a tool to spread their [[perspective (cognitive)|point of view]]. This practice, due to its illegality, has generally become favored by groups excluded from the political mainstream (e.g. [[far-left]] or [[far-right]] groups) who justify their activity by pointing out that they do not have the money \u2013 or sometimes the desire \u2013 to buy [[advertising]] to get their message across, and that a \"[[ruling class]]\" or \"establishment\" controls the mainstream press, systematically excluding the radical and alternative point of view. This type of graffiti can seem crude; for example [[Fascism|fascist]] supporters often scrawl [[swastika]]s and other [[Nazism|Nazi]] images.\n\nOne innovative form of graffiti that emerged in the UK in the 1970s was devised by the Money Liberation Front (MLF), essentially a loose affiliation of [[underground press]] writers such as the poet and playwright [[Heathcote Williams]] and magazine editor and playwright Jay Jeff Jones. They initiated the use of paper currency as a medium for [[counterculture]] propaganda, overprinting banknotes, usually with a [[John Bull]] printing set. Although short lived, the MLF was representative of London's [[Ladbroke Grove]] centered alternative and literary community of the period. The area was also a scene of considerable [[anti-establishment]] and humorous street graffiti, much of which is also produced by Williams.<ref name=history/> In 2009, following the elections in Iran, protesters (who regarded the electoral result as rigged) began to deface banknotes with slogans such as \"Death to the dictator\". In Colombia writing and drawing on banknotes has become increasingly popular, either to make political comments, for fun or as an artistic medium. The national government has run advertising campaigns in an attempt to discourage the practice. In the UK there have been signs of an MLF resurgence with a number of banknotes in circulation being over-marked with protest slogans such as \"Banks=Robbers\", relating to the perceived culpability of banks in the financial crisis.\n\nBoth sides of the conflict in [[Northern Ireland]] produce political graffiti. As well as slogans, Northern Irish political graffiti includes large wall paintings, referred to as ''[[Northern Irish murals|murals]]''. Along with the flying of flags and the painting of kerb stones, the murals serve a territorial purpose, often associated with gang use. Artists paint them mostly on house gables or on the ''[[Belfast Peace Lines|Peace Lines]]'', high walls that separate different communities.\n\nThe murals often develop over an extended period and tend to stylization, with a strong symbolic or [[iconographic]] content. [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist]] murals often refer to historical events dating from the war between [[James II of England|James II]] and [[William III of England|William III]] in the late seventeenth century, whereas [[Irish Republicanism|Republican]] murals usually refer to the more recent [[The Troubles|troubles]].\n\nTerritorial graffiti marks urban neighborhoods with tags and logos to differentiate certain groups from others. These images are meant to show outsiders a stern look at whose turf is whose. The subject matter of gang-related graffiti consists of cryptic [[symbols]] and [[initials]] strictly fashioned with unique [[calligraphies]].

[[The Bronx|Bronx]]-based [[TATS CRU]] has made a name for themselves doing legal advertising campaigns for companies such as [[Coca-Cola]], [[McDonald's]], [[Toyota]], and [[MTV]]. In the UK, Covent Garden's [[Boxfresh]] used stencil images of a [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] revolutionary in the hopes that cross referencing would promote their store.\n\n[[Smirnoff]] hired artists to use [[reverse graffiti]] (the use of high pressure hoses to clean dirty surfaces to leave a clean image in the surrounding dirt) to increase awareness of their product. [[Shepard Fairey]] rose to fame after his \"Andre the Giant Has a Posse\" sticker campaign, in which his art was plastered in cities throughout America.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Advertising graffiti\">\n1969(Lais felat).jpg|Ancient [[Pompeii]]an graffiti advertising by a [[pimp]]\nGrafitti as advertising in China 02.jpg|Graffiti as advertising in [[Haikou]], [[Hainan]] Province, China, which is an extremely common form of graffiti seen throughout the country\nWarszawa Stary Mokot\u00f3w graffiti on shop window.jpg|Graffiti as legal advertising on a grocer's shop window in [[Warsaw, Poland]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Offensive graffiti ===\n\n[[File:Stop graffitti.jpg|thumb|Gang symbol markings on public property, [[Millwood, Washington]]]]\n\nGraffiti may also be used as an offensive expression. This form of graffiti may be difficult to identify, as it is mostly removed by the local authority (as councils which have adopted strategies of criminalization also strive to remove graffiti quickly).<ref name=halsey/> Therefore, existing racist graffiti is mostly more subtle and at first sight, not easily recognized as \"racist\". It can then be understood only if one knows the relevant \"local code\" (social, historical, political, temporal, and spatial), which is seen as [[heteroglossia|heteroglot]] and thus a 'unique set of conditions' in a cultural context.<ref name=holqu/>\n:A spatial code for example, could be that there is a certain youth group in an area that is engaging heavily in racist activities. So, for residents (knowing the local code), a graffiti containing only the name or abbreviation of this gang already is a racist expression, reminding the offended people of their gang activities. Also a graffiti is in most cases, the [[herald]] of more serious criminal activity to come.<ref name=kelling/> A person who does not know these gang activities would not be able to recognize the meaning of this graffiti. Also if a tag of this youth group or gang is placed on a building occupied by asylum seekers, for example, its racist character is even stronger.\n\nBy making the graffiti less explicit (as adapted to social and legal constraints),<ref name=barker/> these drawings are less likely to be removed, but do not lose their threatening and offensive character.<ref name=lynn/>\n\nElsewhere, activists in Russia have used painted [[caricature]]s of local officials with their mouths as [[pothole]]s, to show their anger about the poor state of the roads.<ref>{{cite news |last=Schreck |first=Carl |date=2015-06-19 |title=Russian politicians mocked with guerrilla pothole portraits |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/19/russia-pothole-portraits-activists-banksy |website= New East Network |access-date=2015-09-24}}</ref> In [[Manchester, England]] a graffitists painted obscene images around potholes, which often resulted in their being repaired within 48 hours.<ref>{{cite news |date=2015-04-29 |title=Meet the man using penises to fill potholes |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/11570595/Meet-the-man-using-penises-to-fill-potholes.html |website= The Telegraph |access-date=2015-09-24}}</ref>\n\n== Decorative and high art ==\n\n{{Main|Street art}}\n[[File:JonesyLondon.jpg|thumb|upright|A bronze work by Jonesy on a wall in Brick Lane ([[London]]).

It displayed 22 works by New York graffitists, including [[Crash (graffiti artist)|Crash]], Daze, and [[Lady Pink]]. In an article about the exhibition in the magazine ''Time Out'', curator Charlotta Kotik said that she hoped the exhibition would cause viewers to rethink their assumptions about graffiti. [[Terrance Lindall]], an artist and executive director of the Williamsburg Art and Historic Center, said regarding graffiti and the exhibition:<ref name=tonyk/>\n<blockquote>\"Graffiti is revolutionary, in my opinion\", he says, \"and any revolution might be considered a crime. People who are oppressed or suppressed need an outlet, so they write on walls\u2014it's free.\"</blockquote>\n\nFrom the 1970s onwards, [[Burhan Dogancay]] photographed urban walls all over the world; these he then archived for use as sources of inspiration for his painterly works. The project today known as \"Walls of the World\" grew beyond even his own expectations and comprises about 30,000 individual images. It spans a period of 40 years across five continents and 114 countries. In 1982, photographs from this project comprised a one-man exhibition titled \"Les murs murmurent, ils crient, ils chantent{{nbsp}}...\" (The walls whisper, shout and sing{{nbsp}}...) at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in [[Paris]].\n\nIn Australia, art historians have judged some local graffiti of sufficient creative merit to rank them firmly within the arts. [[Oxford University Press]]'s art history text ''Australian Painting 1788\u20132000'' concludes with a long discussion of graffiti's key place within contemporary [[visual culture]], including the work of several Australian practitioners.<ref name=smithea/>\n\nBetween March and April 2009, 150 artists exhibited 300 pieces of graffiti at the [[Grand Palais]] in Paris \u2014 a clear acceptance of the art form into the French [[art world]].<ref name=rfi/><ref name=rohter/>\n\nFigurines by [[KAWS (artist)|KAWS]], featuring icons of pop culture, often with crossed-out eyes, run in limited editions and sell for thousands of dollars.<ref name=intmag/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Street art graffiti\">\nMiss Van y Ciou (aikijuanma).jpg|Graffiti by [[Miss Van]] and Ciou in [[Barcelona]]\nGraffiti Obelisco.jpg|Graffiti in [[Buenos Aires]], showing the [[El Obelisco|Obelisk]]\n2009 010 CES utka.JPG|''Return of the three funny types'' by Dutch graffiti artist [[Ces53]]\nGraffiti Hamburg No false move.JPG|Graffiti ''No false move'' in [[Hamburg]]\nElisabethmarkt Muenchen Graffiti 2.jpg|Decorative wall painting at Elisabethmarkt in [[Munich]]\nWarsaw-graffiti-face.jpg|Wall art in [[Warsaw]]\nOlindaGraffiti.jpg|This artwork makes use of existing windows in [[Olinda]], [[Pernambuco, Brazil]]\nZeichen der Zeit Hochhaus-Graffiti.jpg|This is said to be the tallest graffiti in the world, at [[Hamburg-Lohbr\u00fcgge]], Germany\nStreet art, Batumi.jpg|Graffiti in [[Batumi]], Georgia\nGraffiti in Sydney Mines, NS.png|Graffiti on an abandoned wall in [[Nova Scotia]]\nGraffiti (Budapest, Pestszentl\u0151rinc).jpg|Graffiti on a wall in [[Budapest]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Environmental effects ==\n\n[[Spray paint]] has many negative environmental effects.

Now some of his work is preserved officially.\n\nIn [[Taiwan]], the government has made some concessions to graffitists. Since 2005 they have been allowed to freely display their work along some sections of riverside retaining walls in designated \"Graffiti Zones\".<ref name=taitimes/> From 2007, Taipei's department of cultural affairs also began permitting graffiti on fences around major public construction sites. Department head Yong-ping Lee (\u674e\u6c38\u840d) stated, \"We will promote graffiti starting with the public sector, and then later in the private sector too. It's our goal to beautify the city with graffiti\". The government later helped organize a graffiti contest in [[Ximending]], a popular shopping district. graffitists caught working outside of these designated areas still face fines up to [[NT$]]6,000 under a department of environmental protection regulation.<ref name=taitimes2/> However, Taiwanese authorities can be relatively lenient, one veteran police officer stating anonymously, \"Unless someone complains about vandalism, we won't get involved. We don't go after it proactively.\"<ref name=reuters/>\n\nIn 1993, after several expensive cars in [[Singapore]] were spray-painted, the police arrested a student from the [[Singapore American School]], [[Michael P. Fay]], questioned him, and subsequently charged him with vandalism. Fay pleaded guilty to vandalizing a car in addition to stealing road signs. Under the 1966 [[Vandalism Act (Singapore)|Vandalism Act of Singapore]], originally passed to curb the spread of communist graffiti in Singapore, the court sentenced him to four months in jail, a fine of S$3,500 (US$2,233), and a [[caning]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran several editorials and op-eds that condemned the punishment and called on the American public to flood the Singaporean embassy with protests. Although the Singapore government received many calls for [[pardon|clemency]], Fay's caning took place in Singapore on 5 May 1994. Fay had originally received a sentence of six strokes of the cane, but the presiding [[president of Singapore]], [[Ong Teng Cheong]], agreed to reduce his caning sentence to four lashes.<ref name=nyt/>\n\nIn [[Republic of Korea|South Korea]], Park Jung-soo was fined two million [[South Korean won]] by the [[Seoul]] Central District Court for spray-painting a rat on posters of the [[G-20]] Summit a few days before the event in November 2011. Park alleged that the initial in \"G-20\" sounds like the Korean word for \"rat\", but Korean government prosecutors alleged that Park was making a derogatory statement about the president of South Korea, [[Lee Myung-bak]], the host of the summit. This case led to public outcry and debate on the lack of government tolerance and in support of freedom of expression. The court ruled that the painting, \"an ominous creature like a rat\" amounts to \"an organized criminal activity\" and upheld the fine while denying the prosecution's request for imprisonment for Park.<ref name=wsj/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Graffiti in Asia\">\nTaiwan 2009 HuaLien City Street Art in Poetic Form FRD 8395.jpg|Street art in poetic form in [[Hualien City]], [[Taiwan]]\nSpecial Graffiti Zone in Taipei.JPG|Sign designating a sanctioned graffiti zone in [[Taipei]]\nTsang graffiti.jpg|Street [[graffiti in Hong Kong]]\n201712 Graffiti on a building of Shentangqiao1.jpg|The Graffiti Piece \"Tante\" (by Chen Dongfan) on the surface wall of an old residential building in Hangzhou, Zhejiang\nGraffiti in Haikou near Evergreen Park - 01.JPG|In [[Haikou]], Hainan\n</gallery>\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n[[File:Graffiti removal berlin.jpg|thumb|upright|Graffiti removal in Berlin]]\n\nIn Europe, community cleaning squads have responded to graffiti, in some cases with reckless abandon, as when in 1992 in France a local Scout group, attempting to remove modern graffiti, damaged [https://web.archive.org/web/20171109194433/http://www.panoramio.com/photo/26895452 two prehistoric paintings] of [[bison]] in the [[Cave of Mayri\u00e8re sup\u00e9rieure]] near the French village of [[Bruniquel]] in [[Tarn-et-Garonne]], earning them the 1992 [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in [[archeology]].<ref name=improb/>\n\nIn September 2006, the European Parliament directed the European Commission to create urban environment policies to prevent and eliminate dirt, litter, graffiti, animal excrement, and excessive noise from domestic and vehicular music systems in European cities, along with other concerns over urban life.<ref name=europa/>\n\nThe [[Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003]] became Britain's latest anti-graffiti legislation. In August 2004, the [[Keep Britain Tidy]] campaign issued a press release calling for [[zero tolerance]] of graffiti and supporting proposals such as issuing \"on the spot\" [[Fine (penalty)|fine]]s to graffiti offenders and banning the sale of aerosol paint to anyone under the age of 16.<ref name=encams/> The press release also condemned the use of graffiti images in advertising and in [[music video]]s, arguing that real-world experience of graffiti stood far removed from its often-portrayed 'cool' or 'edgy' image.\n\nTo back the campaign, 123 [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s (including then [[Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]]), signed a charter which stated: \"Graffiti is not art, it's crime.

One early example is the \"Graffiti Tunnel\" located at the [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]] Campus of the [[University of Sydney]], which is available for use by any student at the university to tag, advertise, poster, and create \"art\". Advocates of this idea suggest that this discourages petty vandalism yet encourages artists to take their time and produce great art, without worry of being caught or arrested for vandalism or [[trespassing]].<ref name=warrin/><ref name=abc/> Others disagree with this approach, arguing that the presence of legal graffiti walls does not demonstrably reduce illegal graffiti elsewhere.<ref name=towno/> Some local government areas throughout Australia have introduced \"anti-graffiti squads\", who clean graffiti in the area, and such crews as BCW (Buffers Can't Win) have taken steps to keep one step ahead of local graffiti cleaners.\n\nMany state governments have banned the sale or possession of spray paint to those under the age of 18 (age of majority). However, a number of local governments in Victoria have taken steps to recognize the cultural heritage value of some examples of graffiti, such as prominent political graffiti. Tough new graffiti laws have been introduced in Australia with fines of up to A$26,000 and two years in prison.\n\n[[Melbourne]] is a prominent graffiti city of Australia with many of its lanes being tourist attractions, such as [[Hosier Lane, Melbourne|Hosier Lane]] in particular, a popular destination for photographers, wedding photography, and backdrops for corporate print advertising. The [[Lonely Planet]] travel guide cites Melbourne's street as a major attraction. All forms of graffiti, including [[sticker]] art, [[poster]], [[stencil]] art, and [[wheatpasting]], can be found in many places throughout the city. Prominent street art precincts include; [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]], [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], [[Northcote, Victoria|Northcote]], [[Brunswick, Victoria|Brunswick]], [[St Kilda, Victoria|St. Kilda]], and the CBD, where stencil and sticker art is prominent. As one moves farther away from the city, mostly along suburban train lines, graffiti tags become more prominent. Many international artists such as Banksy have left their work in Melbourne and in early 2008 a [[perspex]] screen was installed to prevent a Banksy stencil art piece from being destroyed, it has survived since 2003 through the respect of local street artists avoiding posting over it, although it has recently had paint tipped over it.<ref name=wato/>\n\n=== New Zealand ===\n\n[[File:Christchurch Stock Yards.jpg|thumb|Former Christchurch stock yards]]\n\nIn February 2008 [[Helen Clark]], the New Zealand prime minister at that time, announced a government crackdown on tagging and other forms of graffiti vandalism, describing it as a destructive crime representing an invasion of public and private property. New legislation subsequently adopted included a ban on the sale of paint spray cans to persons under 18 and increases in maximum fines for the offence from NZ$200 to NZ$2,000 or extended community service. The issue of tagging become a widely debated one following an incident in [[Auckland]] during January 2008 in which a middle-aged property owner stabbed one of two teenage taggers to death and was subsequently convicted of [[manslaughter]].\n\n=== United States ===\n\n[[Image:Elevator graffiti.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An elevator position indicator with scratch graffiti]]\n{{Main|Graffiti in the United States}}\n\n==== Tracker databases ====\n\nGraffiti databases have increased in the past decade because they allow vandalism incidents to be fully documented against an offender and help the police and prosecution charge and prosecute offenders for multiple counts of vandalism. They also provide law enforcement the ability to rapidly search for an offender's moniker or tag in a simple, effective, and comprehensive way. These systems can also help track costs of damage to city to help allocate an anti-graffiti budget. The theory is that when an offender is caught putting up graffiti, they are not just charged with one count of vandalism; they can be held accountable for all the other damage for which they are responsible. This has two main benefits for law enforcement. One, it sends a signal to the offenders that their vandalism is being tracked. Two, a city can seek restitution from offenders for all the damage that they have committed, not merely a single incident. These systems give law enforcement personnel real-time, street-level intelligence that allows them not only to focus on the worst graffiti offenders and their damage, but also to monitor potential gang violence that is associated with the graffiti.<ref name=crcp/>\n\n==== Gang injunctions ====\n\nMany restrictions of civil gang injunctions are designed to help address and protect the physical environment and limit graffiti. Provisions of gang injunctions include things such as restricting the possession of marker pens, spray paint cans, or other sharp objects capable of defacing private or public property; spray painting, or marking with marker pens, scratching, applying stickers, or otherwise applying graffiti on any public or private property, including, but not limited to the street, alley, residences, block walls, and fences, vehicles or any other real or personal property. Some injunctions contain wording that restricts damaging or vandalizing both public and private property, including but not limited to any vehicle, light fixture, door, fence, wall, gate, window, building, street sign, utility box, telephone box, tree, or power pole.<ref name=crcp2 />\n\n==== Hotlines and reward programs ====\n\nTo help address many of these issues, many local jurisdictions have set up graffiti abatement hotlines, where citizens can call in and report vandalism and have it removed. San Diego's hotline receives more than 5,000 calls per year, in addition to reporting the graffiti, callers can learn more about prevention. One of the complaints about these hotlines is the response time; there is often a lag time between a property owner calling about the graffiti and its removal. The length of delay should be a consideration for any jurisdiction planning on operating a hotline. Local jurisdictions must convince the callers that their complaint of vandalism will be a priority and cleaned off right away. If the jurisdiction does not have the resources to respond to complaints in a timely manner, the value of the hotline diminishes. Crews must be able to respond to individual service calls made to the graffiti hotline as well as focus on cleanup near schools, parks, and major intersections and transit routes to have the biggest impact. Some cities offer a reward for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of suspects for tagging or graffiti related vandalism. The amount of the reward is based on the information provided, and the action taken.<ref name=lawtec/>\n\n==== Search warrants ====\n\nWhen the police use search warrants in connection with a vandalism investigation they are often seeking judicial approval to look for items such as cans of spray paint and nozzles from other kinds of aerosol sprays, etching tools, or other sharp or pointed objects used to etch or scratch glass and other hard surfaces, such as permanent marking pens and markers or paint sticks; evidence of membership or affiliation with any gang or tagging crew, paraphernalia to include any reference to \"(tagger's name),\" and any drawings, writings, objects, or graffiti depicting taggers' names, initials, logos, monikers, slogans, or mention of tagging crew membership; any newspaper clippings relating details of or referring to any graffiti crime.<ref name=paladin/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Graffiti in the United States\">\nSUBWAY CAR - NARA - 554325.jpg|Rampant graffiti hampers visibility into and out of subway cars (1973)\nGraffiti Tunnel (2078441177).jpg|Graffiti-lined tunnel in [[San Francisco]]\nSmear Street Art1.jpg|Graffiti in [[Los Angeles]] (2006)\nLove your country, not government.jpg|Anti-governmental graffiti in [[Bolinas, California]]\nI'm a Man Mural in Memphis 2.jpg|Protest art in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Documentaries ==<!-- chronological !

He repeated the feat the following year, winning with a score of 8.5 of 9. He was being trained by [[Alexander Shakarov]] during this time.\n\nIn 1978, Kasparov participated in the [[Alexey Sokolsky|Sokolsky]] Memorial tournament in [[Minsk]]. He had been invited as an exception but took first place and became a [[chess master]]. Kasparov has repeatedly said that this event was a turning point in his life, and that it convinced him to choose chess as his career. \"I will remember the Sokolsky Memorial as long as I live\", he wrote. He has also said that after the victory, he thought he had a very good shot at the World Championship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chessclub.com/help/interview |title=ICC Help: interview |accessdate=11 August 2007 |publisher=Internet Chess Club}}</ref>\n\nHe first qualified for the [[USSR Chess Championship|Soviet Chess Championship]] at age 15 in 1978, the youngest ever player at that level. He won the 64-player Swiss system tournament at [[Daugavpils]] on tiebreak over [[Igor V. Ivanov]] to capture the sole qualifying place.\n\nKasparov rose quickly through the [[FIDE|World Chess Federation]] rankings. Starting with an oversight by the [[Russian Chess Federation]], he participated in a grandmaster tournament in [[Banja Luka]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (then part of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]), in 1979 while still unrated (he was a replacement for the Soviet [[Defection|defector]] [[Viktor Korchnoi]], who was originally invited but withdrew due to the threat of a boycott from the Soviets). Kasparov won this high-class tournament, emerging with a provisional rating of 2595, enough to catapult him to the top group of chess players (at the time, number 15 in the world).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olimpbase.org/Elo/Elo198001e.html|title=FIDE Rating List: January 1980|publisher=OlimpBase|accessdate=2 April 2011}}</ref> The next year, 1980, he won the [[World Junior Chess Championship]] in [[Dortmund]], West Germany.

His first win in a superclass-level international tournament was scored at [[Bugojno]], Yugoslavia in 1982. He earned a place in the 1982 Moscow [[Interzonal]] tournament, which he won, to qualify for the [[Candidates Tournament]].<ref name=\"chessmetrics\">[http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PlayerProfile.asp?Params=199510SSSSS3S062926000000111000000000000010100 Chessmetrics Player Profile: Garry Kasparov] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308054908/http://chessmetrics.com/cm/CM2/PlayerProfile.asp?Params=199510SSSSS3S062926000000111000000000000010100 |date=8 March 2012 }}</ref> At age 19, he was the youngest Candidate since Bobby Fischer, who was 15 when he qualified in 1958. At this stage, he was already the No. 2-rated player in the world, trailing only World Chess Champion Anatoly Karpov on the January 1983 list.\n\nKasparov's first (quarter-final) Candidates match was against [[Alexander Beliavsky]], whom he defeated 6\u20133 (four wins, one loss).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/8284$cix.htm |title=World Chess Championship 1982\u201384 Candidates Matches |accessdate=11 August 2007 |publisher=Mark Weeks' Chess Pages}}</ref> Politics threatened Kasparov's semi-final against [[Viktor Korchnoi]], which was scheduled to be played in [[Pasadena, California]]. Korchnoi had defected from the Soviet Union in 1976, and was at that time the strongest active non-Soviet player. Various political maneuvers prevented Kasparov from playing Korchnoi, and Kasparov forfeited the match. This was resolved by Korchnoi allowing the match to be replayed in London, along with the previously scheduled match between [[Vasily Smyslov]] and [[Zolt\u00e1n Ribli]]. The Kasparov-Korchnoi match was put together on short notice by [[Raymond Keene]]. Kasparov lost the first game but won the match 7\u20134 (four wins, one loss).\n\nIn January 1984, Kasparov became the [[List of FIDE chess world number ones|No. 1 ranked player]] in the world, with a FIDE rating of 2710. He became the youngest ever world No. 1, a record that lasted 12 years until being broken by [[Vladimir Kramnik]] in January 1996; the record is currently held by [[Magnus Carlsen]].\n\nLater in 1984, he won the Candidates' final 8\u00bd\u20134\u00bd (four wins, no losses) against the resurgent former world champion Vasily Smyslov, at [[Vilnius]], thus qualifying to play Anatoly Karpov for the World Championship. That year he joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU), as a member of which he was elected to the Central Committee of [[Komsomol]] in 1987.\n\n== 1984 World Championship ==\n{{Main|World Chess Championship 1984}}\nThe [[World Chess Championship 1984]] match between [[Anatoly Karpov]] and Garry Kasparov had many ups and downs, and a very controversial finish. Karpov started in very good form, and after nine games Kasparov was down 4\u20130 in a \"first to six wins\" match. Fellow players predicted he would be whitewashed 6\u20130 within 18 games.<ref name=\"Karpov1984\">[http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/84kk$$.htm 1984 Karpov \u2013 Kasparov Title Match Highlights] Mark Weeks' Chess Pages</ref>\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, there followed a series of 17 successive draws, some relatively short, and others drawn in unsettled positions. Kasparov lost game 27 (5\u20130), then fought back with another series of draws until game 32 (5\u20131), earning his first-ever win against the World Champion. Another 14 successive draws followed, through game 46; the previous record length for a world title match had been 34 games, the match of [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]] vs. [[Alexander Alekhine]] in 1927.\n\nKasparov won games 47 and 48 to bring the scores to 5\u20133 in Karpov's favour. Then the match was ended without result by [[Florencio Campomanes]], the President of the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des \u00c9checs]] (FIDE), and a new match was announced to start a few months later. The termination was controversial, as both players stated that they preferred the match to continue. Announcing his decision at a [[press conference]], Campomanes cited the health of the players, which had been strained by the length of the match.\n\nThe match became the first, and so far only, world championship match to be abandoned without result. Kasparov's relations with Campomanes and FIDE were greatly strained, and the feud between them finally came to a head in 1993 with Kasparov's complete break-away from FIDE.\n\n== World Champion ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2018}}<!--only first paragraph has citations-->\n[[File:Kasparov-1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kasparov after winning the FIDE World Championship title in 1985]]\nThe second Karpov-Kasparov match in 1985 was organized in [[Moscow]] as the best of 24 games where the first player to win 12\u00bd points would claim the World Champion title. The scores from the terminated match would not carry over; however, in the event of a 12\u201312 draw, the title would remain with Karpov. On 9 November 1985, Kasparov secured the title by a score of 13\u201311, winning the 24th game with Black, using a [[Sicilian defense]]. He was 22 years old at the time, making him the youngest ever World Champion,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/25/world/asia/25chess.html|title=Record Set for World's Youngest Chess Champion|author =Dylan Loeb McClain |newspaper= The New York Times |date=24 December 2010}}</ref> and breaking the record held by [[Mikhail Tal]] for over 20 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldchesshof.org/hall-of-fame/world-chess-hall-of-fame/mikhail-tal/|title=Mikhail Tal|publisher=[[World Chess Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=22 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206023152/http://worldchesshof.org/hall-of-fame/world-chess-hall-of-fame/mikhail-tal/|archive-date=6 February 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Kasparov's win as Black in the 16th game has been recognized as one of the all-time masterpieces in chess history.\n\nAs part of the arrangements following the aborted 1984 match, Karpov had been granted (in the event of his defeat) a right to rematch. Another match took place in 1986, hosted jointly in [[London]] and [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], with each city hosting 12 games. At one point in the match, Kasparov opened a three-point lead and looked well on his way to a decisive match victory. But Karpov fought back by winning three consecutive games to level the score late in the match. At this point, Kasparov dismissed one of his seconds, grandmaster [[Evgeny Vladimirov]], accusing him of selling his [[Chess opening|opening]] preparation to the Karpov team (as described in Kasparov's autobiography ''Unlimited Challenge'', chapter Stab in the Back). Kasparov scored one more win and kept his title by a final score of 12\u00bd\u201311\u00bd.\n\nA fourth match for the world title took place in 1987 in [[Seville]], as Karpov had qualified through the Candidates' Matches to again become the official challenger.  This match was very close, with neither player holding more than a one-point lead at any time during the contest. Kasparov was down one full point at the time of the final game, and needed a win to draw the match and retain his title. A long tense game ensued in which Karpov [[blunder (chess)|blundered]] away a [[Pawn (chess)|pawn]] just before the first [[time control]], and Kasparov eventually won a long ending. Kasparov retained his title as the match was drawn by a score of 12\u201312. (All this meant that Kasparov had played Karpov four times in the period 1984\u201387, a statistic unprecedented in chess. Matches organized by FIDE had taken place every three years since 1948, and only Botvinnik had a right to a rematch before Karpov.)\n\nA fifth match between Kasparov and Karpov was held in New York and [[Lyon]] in 1990, with each city hosting 12 games. Again, the result was a close one with Kasparov winning by a margin of 12\u00bd\u201311\u00bd. In their five world championship matches, Kasparov had 21 wins, 19 losses, and 104 draws in 144 games.\n\n== Break with and ejection from FIDE ==\n[[File:Kasparov-10.jpg|thumb|Kasparov and [[Viswanathan Anand]] in a publicity photo on top of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in New York,1995]]\nWith the World Champion title in hand, Kasparov began opposing FIDE. Beginning in 1986, he created the Grandmasters Association (GMA), an organization to represent professional chess players and give them more say in FIDE's activities. Kasparov assumed a leadership role. GMA's major achievement was in organizing a series of six World Cup tournaments for the world's top players. A somewhat uneasy relationship developed with FIDE, and a sort of truce was brokered by [[Bessel Kok]], a Dutch businessman.\n\nThis stand-off lasted until 1993, by which time a new challenger had qualified through the [[Candidates Tournament|Candidates]] cycle for Kasparov's next World Championship defense: [[Nigel Short]], a British grandmaster who had defeated Anatoly Karpov in a qualifying match, and then [[Jan Timman]] in the finals held in early 1993. After a confusing and compressed bidding process produced lower financial estimates than expected,<ref>''Nigel Short: Quest for the Crown'', by Cathy Forbes</ref> the world champion and his challenger decided to play outside FIDE's jurisdiction, under another organization created by Kasparov called the [[Professional Chess Association]] (PCA). At this point, a great fracture occurred in the lineage of the FIDE World Championship. In an interview in 2007, Kasparov called the break with FIDE the worst mistake of his career, as it hurt the game in the long run.<ref>[http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1120623 'My decision to break away from fide was a mistake'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318122600/http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1120623 |date=18 March 2009 }}, ''[[DNA (newspaper)|DNA]]'', 10 September 2007. Retrieved 11 September 2007.</ref>\n\nKasparov and Short were ejected from FIDE, and [[World Chess Championship 1993|played their well-sponsored match]] in London in 1993. Kasparov won convincingly by a score of 12\u00bd\u20137\u00bd. The match considerably raised the profile of chess in the UK, with an unprecedented level of coverage on [[Channel 4]]. Meanwhile, FIDE organized a World Championship match between [[Jan Timman]] (the defeated Candidates finalist) and former World Champion Karpov (a defeated Candidates semi-finalist), which Karpov won.\n[[File:Kasparov-44.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kasparov and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] in 2000]] \nFIDE removed Kasparov and Short from the FIDE rating lists. Until this happened, there was a parallel rating list presented by PCA which featured all world top players, regardless of their relation to FIDE. There were now two World Champions: PCA champion Kasparov, and FIDE champion Karpov. The title remained split for 13 years.\n\nKasparov defended his title in a [[PCA World Chess Championship 1995|1995 match]] against [[Viswanathan Anand]] at the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in New York City. Kasparov won the match by four wins to one, with thirteen draws. It was the last World Championship to be held under the auspices of the PCA, which collapsed when [[Intel]], one of its major backers, withdrew its sponsorship.\n\nKasparov tried to organize another World Championship match, under another organization, the World Chess Association (WCA) with [[Linares chess tournament|Linares]] organizer [[Luis Rentero]]. [[Alexei Shirov]] and [[Vladimir Kramnik]] played a candidates match to decide the challenger, which Shirov won in a surprising upset. But when Rentero admitted that the funds required and promised had never materialized, the WCA collapsed. This left Kasparov stranded, and yet another organization stepped in: BrainGames.com, headed by [[Raymond Keene]]. No match against Shirov was arranged, and talks with Anand collapsed, so a match was instead arranged against Kramnik.\n\nDuring this period, Kasparov was approached by [[Oakham School]] in the United Kingdom, at the time the only school in the country with a full-time chess coach,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/expateducation/4179931/Tradition-with-an-eye-on-the-future.html|title=Tradition with an eye on the future|date=6 November 2001|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=2 May 2015}}</ref> and developed an interest in the use of chess in education. In 1997, Kasparov supported a scholarship programme at the school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-19147262.html|title=Kasparov's master class to launch chess scholarship in Britain|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Kasparov also won the [[Marca Leyenda]] trophy that year.\n\n== Losing the title and aftermath ==\n[[File:Kasparov-11.jpg|thumb|Kasparov playing against [[Vladimir Kramnik]] in the Botvinnik Memorial match in Moscow, 2001]]\nThe Kasparov-Kramnik match took place in London during the latter half of 2000. Kramnik had been a student of Kasparov's at the famous Botvinnik/Kasparov chess school in Russia, and had served on Kasparov's team for the 1995 match against Viswanathan Anand.\n\nThe better-prepared Kramnik won game 2 against Kasparov's [[Gr\u00fcnfeld Defence]] and achieved winning positions in Games 4 and 6, although Kasparov held the draw in both games. Kasparov made a critical error in Game 10 with the [[Nimzo-Indian Defence]], which Kramnik exploited to win in 25 moves. As White, Kasparov could not crack the passive but solid [[Ruy Lopez#Berlin Defence|Berlin Defence in the Ruy Lopez]], and Kramnik successfully drew all his games as Black. Kramnik won the match 8\u00bd\u20136\u00bd. Kasparov became the first player to lose a world championship match without winning a game since [[Emanuel Lasker]]'s loss to [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]] in 1921.\n\nAfter losing the title, Kasparov won a series of major tournaments, and remained the top rated player in the world, ahead of both Kramnik and the FIDE World Champions. In 2001 he refused an invitation to the 2002 Dortmund [[Candidates Tournament]] for the Classical title, claiming his results had earned him a rematch with Kramnik.<ref>{{cite press release |title=BGN/Dortmund Event |publisher=This Week in Chess |date=6 September 2001 |url=http://www.chesscenter.com/twic/owenbrain.html |accessdate=11 August 2001}}</ref>\n\nKasparov and Karpov played a four-game match with rapid time controls over two days in December 2002 in New York City. Karpov surprised the experts and emerged victorious, winning two games and drawing one.<ref>[http://www.chessbase.com/newsprint.asp?newsid=661 Anatoly Karpov wins X3D Rapid Match] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019054119/http://www.chessbase.com/newsprint.asp?newsid=661 |date=19 October 2012 }}, ''ChessBase News'', 21 December 2002</ref>\n\nDue to Kasparov's continuing strong results, and status as world No. 1 in much of the public eye, he was included in the so-called \"Prague Agreement\", masterminded by [[Yasser Seirawan]] and intended to reunite the two World Championships. Kasparov was to play a match against the FIDE World Champion [[Ruslan Ponomariov]] in September 2003. But this match was called off after Ponomariov refused to sign his contract for it without reservation. In its place, there were plans for a match against [[Rustam Kasimdzhanov]], winner of the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2004]], to be held in January 2005 in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. These also fell through due to lack of funding. Plans to hold the match in Turkey instead came too late. Kasparov announced in January 2005 that he was tired of waiting for FIDE to organize a match and so had decided to stop all efforts to regain the World Championship title.\n\n== Retirement from chess ==\nAfter winning the prestigious [[Linares chess tournament|Linares tournament]] for the ninth time, Kasparov announced on 10 March 2005 that he would retire from serious competitive chess. He cited as the reason a lack of personal goals in the chess world (he commented when winning the [[Russian Chess Championship|Russian championship]] in 2004 that it had been the last major title he had never won outright) and expressed frustration at the failure to reunify the world championship.\n\nKasparov said he may play in some rapid chess events for fun, but intends to spend more time on his books, including both the ''My Great Predecessors'' series (see [[#Books and other writings|below]]) and a work on the links between decision-making in chess and in other areas of life, and will continue to involve himself in [[Politics of Russia|Russian politics]], which he views as \"headed down the wrong path\".\n\nKasparov has been married three times: to Masha, with whom he had a daughter before divorcing; to Yulia, with whom he had a son before their 2005 divorce; and to Daria (Dasha), with whom he has two children, a daughter born in 2006 and a son born in 2015.

The 202-page book analyzes the 1999 [[Kasparov versus the World]] game, and holds the record for the longest analysis devoted to a single chess game.<ref>Winter, Edward [http://chesshistory.com/winter/extra/records.html \"Chess Records\"] Chess Notes</ref>\n\n=== ''My Great Predecessors'' series ===\n{{Main|My Great Predecessors}}\nIn 2003, the first volume of his five-volume work ''Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors'' was published. This volume, which deals with the world chess champions [[Wilhelm Steinitz]], [[Emanuel Lasker]], [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]], [[Alexander Alekhine]], and some of their strong contemporaries, has received lavish praise from some reviewers (including [[Nigel Short]]), while attracting criticism from others for historical inaccuracies and analysis of games directly copied from unattributed sources. Through suggestions on the book's website, most of these shortcomings were corrected in following editions and translations. Despite this, the first volume won the [[British Chess Federation]]'s Book of the Year award in 2003. Volume two, covering [[Max Euwe]], Mikhail Botvinnik, Vasily Smyslov and [[Mikhail Tal]] appeared later in 2003. Volume three, covering [[Tigran Petrosian]] and Boris Spassky appeared in early 2004. In December 2004, Kasparov released volume four, which covers [[Samuel Reshevsky]], [[Miguel Najdorf]], and [[Bent Larsen]] (none of these three were World Champions), but focuses primarily on [[Bobby Fischer]]. The fifth volume, devoted to the chess careers of World Champion Anatoly Karpov and challenger Viktor Korchnoi, was published in March 2006.\n\n=== ''Modern Chess'' series ===\n{{Main|My Great Predecessors#Modern Chess}}\nHis book ''Revolution in the 70s'' (published in March 2007) covers \"the openings revolution of the 1970s\u20131980s\" and is the first book in a new series called \"Modern Chess Series\", which intends to cover his matches with Karpov and selected games. The book \"Revolution in the 70s\" concerns the revolution in opening theory that was witnessed in that decade. Such systems as the controversial (at the time) [[Hedgehog Defense|\"Hedgehog\"]] opening plan of passively developing the pieces no further than the first three ranks are examined in great detail. Kasparov also analyzes some of the most notable games played in that period. In a section at the end of the book, top opening theoreticians provide their own \"take\" on the progress made in opening theory in the 1980s.\n\n=== ''Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov'' series ===\n{{Main|My Great Predecessors#Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov}}\nKasparov is publishing three volumes of his games.\n\n===Winter Is Coming===\nIn October 2015, Kasparov published a book titled Winter Is Coming: Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped. The title is a reference to the HBO television series Game of Thrones. In the book, Kasparov writes about the need for an organization solely composed of democratic countries to replace the United Nations. In an interview, he called the United Nations a \"catwalk for dictators\".<ref name=\"Kristol\"/>\n\n===Historical revision===\n\nKasparov believes that the conventional history of civilization is radically incorrect. Specifically, he believes that the history of [[ancient civilizations]] is based on misdatings of events and achievements that actually occurred in the [[medieval period]].<ref name=\"taylorinterview\">{{cite web|url=https://timothytaylor.ca/garry-kasparov-interview-from-2001/|title=Garry Kasparov Interview (originally published in Saturday Night Online, 2001)|website=timothytaylor.ca ([[wp:newsblog]])|date=23 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"taylortime\">{{cite web|url=https://timothytaylor.ca/time-warp/|title=Time Warp (Originally published in Saturday Night Magazine)|website=timothytaylor.ca ([[wp:newsblog]])|date=31 August 2010}}</ref> He has cited several aspects of ancient history that he says are likely to be anachronisms.<ref name=\"ualberta\">{{cite web|url=https://www.math.ualberta.ca/pi/issue5/page05-08.pdf|title=Mathematics of the Past|author=Garry Kasparov|website=Pi in the Sky (magazine of the [[Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences]], Canada)}}</ref>\n\nKasparov has written in support of [[New Chronology (Fomenko)|New Chronology]] (Fomenko), although with some reservations.<ref>Winter, Edward [http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/newchronology.html \"Garry Kasparov and New Chronology\"] ''Chess Notes''</ref> In 2001, Kasparov expressed a desire to devote his time to promoting the New Chronology after his chess career. \"New Chronology is a great area for investing my intellect&nbsp;...

The answer is no, I never had that opportunity. But even though he saw me as a member of the evil chess establishment that he felt had robbed and cheated him, I am sorry I never had a chance to thank him personally for what he did for our sport.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1707222,00.html The Chessman], ''TIME'', 26 January 2008</ref>\n\nHe is the chief advisor for the book publisher [[Everyman Chess]].\n\nKasparov works closely with [[Mig Greengard]] and his comments can often be found on Greengard's blog (apparently no longer active).\n\nKasparov collaborated with [[Max Levchin]] and [[Peter Thiel]] on ''The Blueprint'', a book calling for a revival of world innovation, planned to release in March 2013 from W. W. Norton & Company. The book was never released, as the authors disagreed on its contents.<ref>[https://www.technologyreview.com/s/429690/why-we-cant-solve-big-problems/ Why We Can't Solve Big Problems], ''MIT Technology Review'', 24 October 2012.</ref>\n\nKasparov argued that Chess has become the Drosophila fruit fly of reasoning, in an editorial comment on Google's AlphaZero chess-playing system. \"I was pleased to see that AlphaZero had a dynamic, open style like my own,\" he wrote in late 2018.<ref>Garry Kasparov, \"Chess, a Drosophila of reasoning\".

He repeated the feat the following year, winning with a score of 8.5 of 9. He was being trained by [[Alexander Shakarov]] during this time.\n\nIn 1978, Kasparov participated in the [[Alexey Sokolsky|Sokolsky]] Memorial tournament in [[Minsk]]. He had been invited as an exception but took first place and became a [[chess master]]. Kasparov has repeatedly said that this event was a turning point in his life, and that it convinced him to choose chess as his career. \"I will remember the Sokolsky Memorial as long as I live\", he wrote. He has also said that after the victory, he thought he had a very good shot at the World Championship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chessclub.com/help/interview |title=ICC Help: interview |accessdate=11 August 2007 |publisher=Internet Chess Club}}</ref>\n\nHe first qualified for the [[USSR Chess Championship|Soviet Chess Championship]] at age 15 in 1978, the youngest ever player at that level. He won the 64-player Swiss system tournament at [[Daugavpils]] on tiebreak over [[Igor V. Ivanov]] to capture the sole qualifying place.\n\nKasparov rose quickly through the [[FIDE|World Chess Federation]] rankings. Starting with an oversight by the [[Russian Chess Federation]], he participated in a grandmaster tournament in [[Banja Luka]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (then part of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]), in 1979 while still unrated (he was a replacement for the Soviet [[Defection|defector]] [[Viktor Korchnoi]], who was originally invited but withdrew due to the threat of a boycott from the Soviets). Kasparov won this high-class tournament, emerging with a provisional rating of 2595, enough to catapult him to the top group of chess players (at the time, number 15 in the world).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olimpbase.org/Elo/Elo198001e.html|title=FIDE Rating List: January 1980|publisher=OlimpBase|accessdate=2 April 2011}}</ref> The next year, 1980, he won the [[World Junior Chess Championship]] in [[Dortmund]], West Germany.

At this stage, he was already the No. 2-rated player in the world, trailing only World Chess Champion Anatoly Karpov on the January 1983 list.\n\nKasparov's first (quarter-final) Candidates match was against [[Alexander Beliavsky]], whom he defeated 6\u20133 (four wins, one loss).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/8284$cix.htm |title=World Chess Championship 1982\u201384 Candidates Matches |accessdate=11 August 2007 |publisher=Mark Weeks' Chess Pages}}</ref> Politics threatened Kasparov's semi-final against [[Viktor Korchnoi]], which was scheduled to be played in [[Pasadena, California]]. Korchnoi had defected from the Soviet Union in 1976, and was at that time the strongest active non-Soviet player. Various political maneuvers prevented Kasparov from playing Korchnoi, and Kasparov forfeited the match. This was resolved by Korchnoi allowing the match to be replayed in London, along with the previously scheduled match between [[Vasily Smyslov]] and [[Zolt\u00e1n Ribli]]. The Kasparov-Korchnoi match was put together on short notice by [[Raymond Keene]]. Kasparov lost the first game but won the match 7\u20134 (four wins, one loss).\n\nIn January 1984, Kasparov became the [[List of FIDE chess world number ones|No. 1 ranked player]] in the world, with a FIDE rating of 2710. He became the youngest ever world No. 1, a record that lasted 12 years until being broken by [[Vladimir Kramnik]] in January 1996; the record is currently held by [[Magnus Carlsen]].\n\nLater in 1984, he won the Candidates' final 8\u00bd\u20134\u00bd (four wins, no losses) against the resurgent former world champion Vasily Smyslov, at [[Vilnius]], thus qualifying to play Anatoly Karpov for the World Championship. That year he joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU), as a member of which he was elected to the Central Committee of [[Komsomol]] in 1987.\n\n== 1984 World Championship ==\n{{Main|World Chess Championship 1984}}\nThe [[World Chess Championship 1984]] match between [[Anatoly Karpov]] and Garry Kasparov had many ups and downs, and a very controversial finish. Karpov started in very good form, and after nine games Kasparov was down 4\u20130 in a \"first to six wins\" match. Fellow players predicted he would be whitewashed 6\u20130 within 18 games.<ref name=\"Karpov1984\">[http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/84kk$$.htm 1984 Karpov \u2013 Kasparov Title Match Highlights] Mark Weeks' Chess Pages</ref>\n\nIn an unexpected turn of events, there followed a series of 17 successive draws, some relatively short, and others drawn in unsettled positions. Kasparov lost game 27 (5\u20130), then fought back with another series of draws until game 32 (5\u20131), earning his first-ever win against the World Champion. Another 14 successive draws followed, through game 46; the previous record length for a world title match had been 34 games, the match of [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]] vs. [[Alexander Alekhine]] in 1927.\n\nKasparov won games 47 and 48 to bring the scores to 5\u20133 in Karpov's favour. Then the match was ended without result by [[Florencio Campomanes]], the President of [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des \u00c9checs]] (FIDE), and a new match was announced to start a few months later. The termination was controversial, as both players stated that they preferred the match to continue. Announcing his decision at a [[press conference]], Campomanes cited the health of the players, which had been strained by the length of the match.\n\nThe match became the first, and so far only, world championship match to be abandoned without result. Kasparov's relations with Campomanes and FIDE were greatly strained, and the feud between them finally came to a head in 1993 with Kasparov's complete break-away from FIDE.\n\n== World Champion ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2018}}<!--only first paragraph has citations-->\n[[File:Kasparov-1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kasparov after winning the FIDE World Championship title in 1985]]\nThe second Karpov-Kasparov match in 1985 was organized in [[Moscow]] as the best of 24 games where the first player to win 12\u00bd points would claim the World Champion title. The scores from the terminated match would not carry over; however, in the event of a 12\u201312 draw, the title would remain with Karpov. On 9 November 1985, Kasparov secured the title by a score of 13\u201311, winning the 24th game with Black, using a [[Sicilian defense]]. He was 22 years old at the time, making him the youngest ever World Champion,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/25/world/asia/25chess.html|title=Record Set for World's Youngest Chess Champion|author =Dylan Loeb McClain |newspaper= The New York Times |date=24 December 2010}}</ref> and breaking the record held by [[Mikhail Tal]] for over 20 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldchesshof.org/hall-of-fame/world-chess-hall-of-fame/mikhail-tal/|title=Mikhail Tal|publisher=[[World Chess Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=22 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206023152/http://worldchesshof.org/hall-of-fame/world-chess-hall-of-fame/mikhail-tal/|archive-date=6 February 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Kasparov's win as Black in the 16th game has been recognized as one of the all-time masterpieces in chess history.\n\nAs part of the arrangements following the aborted 1984 match, Karpov had been granted (in the event of his defeat) a right to rematch. Another match took place in 1986, hosted jointly in [[London]] and [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], with each city hosting 12 games. At one point in the match, Kasparov opened a three-point lead and looked well on his way to a decisive match victory. But Karpov fought back by winning three consecutive games to level the score late in the match. At this point, Kasparov dismissed one of his seconds, grandmaster [[Evgeny Vladimirov]], accusing him of selling his [[Chess opening|opening]] preparation to the Karpov team (as described in Kasparov's autobiography ''Unlimited Challenge'', chapter Stab in the Back). Kasparov scored one more win and kept his title by a final score of 12\u00bd\u201311\u00bd.\n\nA fourth match for the world title took place in 1987 in [[Seville]], as Karpov had qualified through the Candidates' Matches to again become the official challenger.  This match was very close, with neither player holding more than a one-point lead at any time during the contest. Kasparov was down one full point at the time of the final game, and needed a win to draw the match and retain his title. A long tense game ensued in which Karpov [[blunder (chess)|blundered]] away a [[Pawn (chess)|pawn]] just before the first [[time control]], and Kasparov eventually won a long ending. Kasparov retained his title as the match was drawn by a score of 12\u201312. (All this meant that Kasparov had played Karpov four times in the period 1984\u201387, a statistic unprecedented in chess. Matches organized by FIDE had taken place every three years since 1948, and only Botvinnik had a right to a rematch before Karpov.)\n\nA fifth match between Kasparov and Karpov was held in New York and [[Lyon]] in 1990, with each city hosting 12 games. Again, the result was a close one with Kasparov winning by a margin of 12\u00bd\u201311\u00bd. In their five world championship matches, Kasparov had 21 wins, 19 losses, and 104 draws in 144 games.\n\n== Break with and ejection from FIDE ==\n[[File:Kasparov-10.jpg|thumb|Kasparov and [[Viswanathan Anand]] in a publicity photo on top of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in New York,1995]]\nWith the World Champion title in hand, Kasparov began opposing FIDE. Beginning in 1986, he created the Grandmasters Association (GMA), an organization to represent professional chess players and give them more say in FIDE's activities. Kasparov assumed a leadership role. GMA's major achievement was in organizing a series of six World Cup tournaments for the world's top players. A somewhat uneasy relationship developed with FIDE, and a sort of truce was brokered by [[Bessel Kok]], a Dutch businessman.\n\nThis stand-off lasted until 1993, by which time a new challenger had qualified through the [[Candidates Tournament|Candidates]] cycle for Kasparov's next World Championship defense: [[Nigel Short]], a British grandmaster who had defeated Anatoly Karpov in a qualifying match, and then [[Jan Timman]] in the finals held in early 1993. After a confusing and compressed bidding process produced lower financial estimates than expected,<ref>''Nigel Short: Quest for the Crown'', by Cathy Forbes</ref> the world champion and his challenger decided to play outside FIDE's jurisdiction, under another organization created by Kasparov called the [[Professional Chess Association]] (PCA). At this point, a great fracture occurred in the lineage of the FIDE World Championship. In an interview in 2007, Kasparov called the break with FIDE the worst mistake of his career, as it hurt the game in the long run.<ref>[http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1120623 'My decision to break away from fide was a mistake'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318122600/http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1120623 |date=18 March 2009 }}, ''[[DNA (newspaper)|DNA]]'', 10 September 2007. Retrieved 11 September 2007.</ref>\n\nKasparov and Short were ejected from FIDE, and [[World Chess Championship 1993|played their well-sponsored match]] in London in 1993. Kasparov won convincingly by a score of 12\u00bd\u20137\u00bd. The match considerably raised the profile of chess in the UK, with an unprecedented level of coverage on [[Channel 4]]. Meanwhile, FIDE organized a World Championship match between [[Jan Timman]] (the defeated Candidates finalist) and former World Champion Karpov (a defeated Candidates semi-finalist), which Karpov won.\n[[File:Kasparov-44.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kasparov and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] in 2000]] \nFIDE removed Kasparov and Short from the FIDE rating lists. Until this happened, there was a parallel rating list presented by PCA which featured all world top players, regardless of their relation to FIDE. There were now two World Champions: PCA champion Kasparov, and FIDE champion Karpov. The title remained split for 13 years.\n\nKasparov defended his title in a [[PCA World Chess Championship 1995|1995 match]] against [[Viswanathan Anand]] at the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] in New York City. Kasparov won the match by four wins to one, with thirteen draws. It was the last World Championship to be held under the auspices of the PCA, which collapsed when [[Intel]], one of its major backers, withdrew its sponsorship.\n\nKasparov tried to organize another World Championship match, under another organization, the World Chess Association (WCA) with [[Linares chess tournament|Linares]] organizer [[Luis Rentero]]. [[Alexei Shirov]] and [[Vladimir Kramnik]] played a candidates match to decide the challenger, which Shirov won in a surprising upset. But when Rentero admitted that the funds required and promised had never materialized, the WCA collapsed. This left Kasparov stranded, and yet another organization stepped in: BrainGames.com, headed by [[Raymond Keene]]. No match against Shirov was arranged, and talks with Anand collapsed, so a match was instead arranged against Kramnik.\n\nDuring this period, Kasparov was approached by [[Oakham School]] in the United Kingdom, at the time the only school in the country with a full-time chess coach,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/expateducation/4179931/Tradition-with-an-eye-on-the-future.html|title=Tradition with an eye on the future|date=6 November 2001|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=2 May 2015}}</ref> and developed an interest in the use of chess in education. In 1997, Kasparov supported a scholarship programme at the school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-19147262.html|title=Kasparov's master class to launch chess scholarship in Britain|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Kasparov also won the [[Marca Leyenda]] trophy that year.\n\n== Losing the title and aftermath ==\n[[File:Kasparov-11.jpg|thumb|Kasparov playing against [[Vladimir Kramnik]] in the Botvinnik Memorial match in Moscow, 2001]]\nThe Kasparov-Kramnik match took place in London during the latter half of 2000. Kramnik had been a student of Kasparov's at the famous Botvinnik/Kasparov chess school in Russia, and had served on Kasparov's team for the 1995 match against Viswanathan Anand.\n\nThe better-prepared Kramnik won game 2 against Kasparov's [[Gr\u00fcnfeld Defence]] and achieved winning positions in Games 4 and 6, although Kasparov held the draw in both games. Kasparov made a critical error in Game 10 with the [[Nimzo-Indian Defence]], which Kramnik exploited to win in 25 moves. As White, Kasparov could not crack the passive but solid [[Ruy Lopez#Berlin Defence|Berlin Defence in the Ruy Lopez]], and Kramnik successfully drew all his games as Black. Kramnik won the match 8\u00bd\u20136\u00bd. Kasparov became the first player to lose a world championship match without winning a game since [[Emanuel Lasker]]'s loss to [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]] in 1921.\n\nAfter losing the title, Kasparov won a series of major tournaments, and remained the top rated player in the world, ahead of both Kramnik and the FIDE World Champions. In 2001 he refused an invitation to the 2002 Dortmund [[Candidates Tournament]] for the Classical title, claiming his results had earned him a rematch with Kramnik.<ref>{{cite press release |title=BGN/Dortmund Event |publisher=This Week in Chess |date=6 September 2001 |url=http://www.chesscenter.com/twic/owenbrain.html |accessdate=11 August 2001}}</ref>\n\nKasparov and Karpov played a four-game match with rapid time controls over two days in December 2002 in New York City. Karpov surprised the experts and emerged victorious, winning two games and drawing one.<ref>[http://www.chessbase.com/newsprint.asp?newsid=661 Anatoly Karpov wins X3D Rapid Match] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019054119/http://www.chessbase.com/newsprint.asp?newsid=661 |date=19 October 2012 }}, ''ChessBase News'', 21 December 2002</ref>\n\nDue to Kasparov's continuing strong results, and status as world No. 1 in much of the public eye, he was included in the so-called \"Prague Agreement\", masterminded by [[Yasser Seirawan]] and intended to reunite the two World Championships. Kasparov was to play a match against the FIDE World Champion [[Ruslan Ponomariov]] in September 2003. But this match was called off after Ponomariov refused to sign his contract for it without reservation. In its place, there were plans for a match against [[Rustam Kasimdzhanov]], winner of the [[FIDE World Chess Championship 2004]], to be held in January 2005 in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. These also fell through due to lack of funding. Plans to hold the match in Turkey instead came too late. Kasparov announced in January 2005 that he was tired of waiting for FIDE to organize a match and so had decided to stop all efforts to regain the World Championship title.\n\n== Retirement from chess ==\nAfter winning the prestigious [[Linares chess tournament|Linares tournament]] for the ninth time, Kasparov announced on 10 March 2005 that he would retire from serious competitive chess. He cited as the reason a lack of personal goals in the chess world (he commented when winning the [[Russian Chess Championship|Russian championship]] in 2004 that it had been the last major title he had never won outright) and expressed frustration at the failure to reunify the world championship.\n\nKasparov said he may play in some rapid chess events for fun, but intends to spend more time on his books, including both the ''My Great Predecessors'' series (see [[#Books and other writings|below]]) and a work on the links between decision-making in chess and in other areas of life, and will continue to involve himself in [[Politics of Russia|Russian politics]], which he views as \"headed down the wrong path\".\n\nKasparov has been married three times: to Masha, with whom he had a daughter before divorcing; to Yulia, with whom he had a son before their 2005 divorce; and to Daria (Dasha), with whom he has two children, a daughter born in 2006 and a son born in 2015.

He published a controversial<ref>[http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/child.html Kasparov's Child of Change by Edward Winter] chesshistory.com</ref> autobiography when still in his early 20s, originally titled ''Child of Change'', later retitled ''Unlimited Challenge''. This book was subsequently updated several times after he became World Champion. Its content is mainly literary, with a small chess component of key unannotated games. He published an annotated games collection in 1985: ''Fighting Chess: My Games and Career''<ref>{{ISBN|0-7855-0863-5}}</ref> and this book has also been updated several times in further editions. He also wrote a book annotating the games from his [[World Chess Championship 1985]] victory, ''World Chess Championship Match: Moscow, 1985''.\n\nHe has annotated his own games extensively for the Yugoslav ''[[Chess Informant]]'' series and for other chess publications. In 1982, he co-authored ''Batsford Chess Openings'' with British grandmaster [[Raymond Keene]] and this book was an enormous seller. It was updated into a second edition in 1989. He also co-authored two opening books with his trainer Alexander Nikitin in the 1980s for British publisher [[Pavilion Books|Batsford]]\u2014on the [[Caro-Kann Defence#Classical / Capablanca Variation|Classical Variation of the Caro-Kann Defence]] and on the [[Sicilian Defence, Scheveningen Variation|Scheveningen Variation of the Sicilian Defence]]. Kasparov has also contributed extensively to the five-volume openings series ''Encyclopedia of Chess Openings''.\n\nIn 2000, Kasparov co-authored ''Kasparov Against the World: The Story of the Greatest Online Challenge''<ref>{{Cite book |isbn = 0-9704813-0-6|title = Kasparov Against the World: The Story of the Greatest Online Challenge|last1 = Kasparov|first1 = Garri Kimovich|last2 = King|first2 = Daniel|year = 2000}}</ref> with grandmaster [[Daniel J. King|Daniel King]]. The 202-page book analyzes the 1999 [[Kasparov versus the World]] game, and holds the record for the longest analysis devoted to a single chess game.<ref>Winter, Edward [http://chesshistory.com/winter/extra/records.html \"Chess Records\"] Chess Notes</ref>\n\n=== ''My Great Predecessors'' series ===\n{{Main|My Great Predecessors}}\nIn 2003, the first volume of his five-volume work ''Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors'' was published. This volume, which deals with the world chess champions [[Wilhelm Steinitz]], [[Emanuel Lasker]], [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]], [[Alexander Alekhine]], and some of their strong contemporaries, has received lavish praise from some reviewers (including [[Nigel Short]]), while attracting criticism from others for historical inaccuracies and analysis of games directly copied from unattributed sources. Through suggestions on the book's website, most of these shortcomings were corrected in following editions and translations. Despite this, the first volume won the [[British Chess Federation]]'s Book of the Year award in 2003. Volume two, covering [[Max Euwe]], Mikhail Botvinnik, Vasily Smyslov and [[Mikhail Tal]] appeared later in 2003. Volume three, covering [[Tigran Petrosian]] and Boris Spassky appeared in early 2004. In December 2004, Kasparov released volume four, which covers [[Samuel Reshevsky]], [[Miguel Najdorf]], and [[Bent Larsen]] (none of these three were World Champions), but focuses primarily on [[Bobby Fischer]]. The fifth volume, devoted to the chess careers of World Champion Anatoly Karpov and challenger Viktor Korchnoi, was published in March 2006.\n\n=== ''Modern Chess'' series ===\n{{Main|My Great Predecessors#Modern Chess}}\nHis book ''Revolution in the 70s'' (published in March 2007) covers \"the openings revolution of the 1970s\u20131980s\" and is the first book in a new series called \"Modern Chess Series\", which intends to cover his matches with Karpov and selected games. The book \"Revolution in the 70s\" concerns the revolution in opening theory that was witnessed in that decade. Such systems as the controversial (at the time) [[Hedgehog Defense|\"Hedgehog\"]] opening plan of passively developing the pieces no further than the first three ranks are examined in great detail. Kasparov also analyzes some of the most notable games played in that period. In a section at the end of the book, top opening theoreticians provide their own \"take\" on the progress made in opening theory in the 1980s.\n\n=== ''Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov'' series ===\n{{Main|My Great Predecessors#Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov}}\nKasparov is publishing three volumes of his games.\n\n===Winter Is Coming===\nIn October 2015, Kasparov published a book titled Winter Is Coming: Why Vladimir Putin and the Enemies of the Free World Must Be Stopped. The title is a reference to the HBO television series Game of Thrones. In the book, Kasparov writes about the need for an organization solely composed of democratic countries to replace the United Nations. In an interview, he called the United Nations a \"catwalk for dictators\".<ref name=\"Kristol\"/>\n\n===Historical revision===\n\nKasparov believes that the conventional history of civilization is radically incorrect. Specifically, he believes that the history of [[ancient civilizations]] is based on misdatings of events and achievements that actually occurred in the [[medieval period]].<ref name=\"taylorinterview\">{{cite web|url=https://timothytaylor.ca/garry-kasparov-interview-from-2001/|title=Garry Kasparov Interview (originally published in Saturday Night Online, 2001)|website=timothytaylor.ca ([[wp:newsblog]])|date=23 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"taylortime\">{{cite web|url=https://timothytaylor.ca/time-warp/|title=Time Warp (Originally published in Saturday Night Magazine)|website=timothytaylor.ca ([[wp:newsblog]])|date=31 August 2010}}</ref> He has cited several aspects of ancient history that he says are likely to be anachronisms.<ref name=\"ualberta\">{{cite web|url=https://www.math.ualberta.ca/pi/issue5/page05-08.pdf|title=Mathematics of the Past|author=Garry Kasparov|website=Pi in the Sky (magazine of the [[Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences]], Canada)}}</ref>\n\nKasparov has written in support of [[New Chronology (Fomenko)|New Chronology]] (Fomenko), although with some reservations.<ref>Winter, Edward [http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/newchronology.html \"Garry Kasparov and New Chronology\"] ''Chess Notes''</ref> In 2001, Kasparov expressed a desire to devote his time to promoting the New Chronology after his chess career. \"New Chronology is a great area for investing my intellect&nbsp;...

The answer is no, I never had that opportunity. But even though he saw me as a member of the evil chess establishment that he felt had robbed and cheated him, I am sorry I never had a chance to thank him personally for what he did for our sport.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1707222,00.html The Chessman], ''TIME'', 26 January 2008</ref>\n\nHe is the chief advisor for the book publisher [[Everyman Chess]].\n\nKasparov works closely with [[Mig Greengard]] and his comments can often be found on Greengard's blog (apparently no longer active).\n\nKasparov collaborated with [[Max Levchin]] and [[Peter Thiel]] on ''The Blueprint'', a book calling for a revival of world innovation, planned to release in March 2013 from W. W. Norton & Company. The book was never released, as the authors disagreed on its contents.<ref>[https://www.technologyreview.com/s/429690/why-we-cant-solve-big-problems/ Why We Can't Solve Big Problems], ''MIT Technology Review'', 24 October 2012.</ref>\n\nKasparov argued that Chess has become the Drosophila fruit fly of reasoning, in an editorial comment on Google's AlphaZero chess-playing system. \"I was pleased to see that AlphaZero had a dynamic, open style like my own,\" he wrote in late 2018.<ref>Garry Kasparov, \"Chess, a Drosophila of reasoning\".

His mother, Emma Karoline Johanna Geiese (1869\u20131904) died of [[diabetes]] while Hans-Georg was four years old, and he later noted that this may have had an effect on his decision to not pursue scientific studies. [[Jean Grondin]] describes Gadamer as finding in his mother \"a poetic and almost religious counterpart to the iron fist of his father\".{{sfn|Grondin|2003|p=21}} Gadamer did not serve during [[World War I]] for reasons of ill health{{sfn|Grondin|2003|p=45}} and similarly was exempted from serving during [[World War II]] due to [[polio]].{{sfn|Grondin|2003|p=46}}\n\nHe later studied classics and philosophy in the [[University of Breslau]]{{sfn|Grondin|2003|p=37}} under [[Richard H\u00f6nigswald]], but soon moved back to the University of Marburg to study with the [[Neo-Kantian]] philosophers [[Paul Natorp]] (his [[doctoral thesis]] advisor) and [[Nicolai Hartmann]]. He defended his [[dissertation]] ''The Essence of Pleasure in Plato's Dialogues'' ({{lang|de|Das Wesen der Lust nach den Platonischen Dialogen}}) in 1922.{{sfn|Cesare|2007|p=5\u20137}}\n\nShortly thereafter, Gadamer moved to [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg University]] and began studying with [[Martin Heidegger]], who was then a promising young scholar who had not yet received a professorship. He and Heidegger became close, and when Heidegger received a position at [[University of Marburg|Marburg]], Gadamer followed him there, where he became one of a group of students such as [[Leo Strauss]], [[Karl L\u00f6with]], and [[Hannah Arendt]]. It was Heidegger's influence that gave Gadamer's thought its distinctive cast and led him away from the earlier neo-Kantian influences of Natorp and Hartmann.

The debate was inconclusive, but marked the beginning of warm relations between the two men. It was Gadamer who secured Habermas's first professorship in the University of Heidelberg.\n\nIn 1968, Gadamer invited [[Tomonobu Imamichi]] for lectures at Heidelberg, but their relationship became very cool after Imamichi alleged that Heidegger had taken his concept of ''[[Dasein]]'' out of [[Okakura Kakuzo]]'s concept of ''das in-der-Welt-sein'' (to be in the [[being in the world]]) expressed in ''[[The Book of Tea]]'', which Imamichi's teacher had offered to Heidegger in 1919, after having followed lessons with him the year before.<ref name=\"Imamichi\">{{cite web |first=Tomonobu |last=Imamichi |title=In Search of Wisdom.

A last meeting between Gadamer and Derrida was held at the Stift of Heidelberg in July 2001, coordinated by Derrida's students Joseph Cohen and Raphael Zagury-Orly.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} This meeting marked, in many ways, a turn in their philosophical encounter. After Gadamer's death, Derrida called their failure to find common ground one of the worst debacles of his life and expressed, in the main obituary for Gadamer, his great personal and philosophical respect. [[Richard J. Bernstein]] said that \"[a] genuine dialogue between Gadamer and Derrida has never taken place.

Gadamer's goal was to uncover the nature of human understanding. In ''Truth and Method'', Gadamer argued that \"truth\" and \"method\" were at odds with one another. For Gadamer, \"the experience of art is exemplary in its provision of truths that are inaccessible by scientific methods, and this experience is projected to the whole domain of human sciences.\"<ref>Skorin-Kapov, Jadranka (2016), \"The Intertwining of Aesthetics and Ethics: Exceeding of Expectations, Ecstasy, Sublimity,\" Lexington Books, {{ISBN|978-1498524568}}</ref> He was critical of two approaches to the [[human science]]s (''[[Geisteswissenschaft]]en''). On the one hand, he was critical of modern approaches to humanities that modeled themselves on the natural sciences, which simply sought to \u201cobjectively\u201d observe and analyze texts and art. On the other hand, he took issue with the traditional German approaches to the humanities, represented for instance by [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] and [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], who believed that meaning, as an object, could be found within a text through a particular process that allowed for a connection with the author's thoughts that led to the creation of a text (Schleiermacher),{{sfn|Schleiermacher|Wojcik|Haas|1978|pp=5, 10}} or the situation that led to an expression of human inner life (Dilthey).{{sfn|Palmer|1969|p=98}}\n\nHowever, Gadamer argued meaning and understanding are not objects to be found through certain methods, but are inevitable phenomena.{{sfn|Palmer|1969|p=163}}  Hermeneutics is not a process in which an interpreter finds a particular meaning, but \u201ca philosophical effort to account for understanding as an ontological\u2014the ontological\u2014process of man.\u201d{{sfn|Palmer|1969|p=163}} Thus, Gadamer is not giving a prescriptive method on how to understand, but rather he is working to examine how understanding, whether of texts, artwork, or experience, is possible at all.  Gadamer intended ''Truth and Method'' to be a description of what we always do when we interpret things (even if we do not know it): \"My real concern was and is philosophic: not what we do or what we ought to do, but what happens to us over and above our wanting and doing\".<ref>Truth and Method 2nd ed. Sheed and Ward, London 1989 XXVIII</ref>\n\nAs a result of [[Martin Heidegger]]\u2019s temporal analysis of human existence, Gadamer argued that people have a so-called historically-effected [[consciousness]] (''wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewu\u00dftsein''), and that they are embedded in the particular history and culture that shaped them. However the historical consciousness is not an object over and against our existence, but \u201ca stream in which we move and participate, in every act of understanding.\u201d{{sfn|Palmer|1969|p=117}} Therefore, people do not come to any given thing without some form of preunderstanding established by this historical stream.  The tradition in which an interpreter stands establishes \"prejudices\" that affect how he or she will make interpretations. For Gadamer, these prejudices are not something that hinders our ability to make interpretations, but are both integral to the reality of being, and \u201care the basis of our being able to understand history at all.\u201d{{sfn|Palmer|1969|p=182}} Gadamer criticized Enlightenment thinkers for harboring a \"prejudice against prejudices\".{{sfn|Gonzales|2006|p=328}}\n\nFor Gadamer, interpreting a text involves a [[fusion of horizons]] (''Horizontverschmelzung'').  Both the text and the interpreter find themselves within a particular historical tradition, or \u201chorizon.\u201d  Each horizon is expressed through the medium of language, and both text and interpreter belong to and participate in history and language.  This \u201cbelongingness\u201d to language is the common ground between interpreter and text that makes understanding possible.  As an interpreter seeks to understand a text, a common horizon emerges.  This fusion of horizons does not mean the interpreter now fully understands some kind of objective meaning, but is \u201can event in which a world opens itself to him.\u201d{{sfn|Palmer|1969|p=209}} The result is a deeper understanding of the subject matter.\n\nGadamer further explains the hermeneutical experience as a dialogue.  To justify this, he uses [[Plato#The dialogues|Plato's dialogues]] as a model for how we are to engage with written texts.  To be in conversation, one must take seriously \u201cthe truth claim of the person with whom one is conversing.\u201d{{sfn|Gonzales|2006|pp=322\u2013323}} Further, each participant in the conversation relates to one another insofar as they belong to the common goal of understanding one another.{{sfn|Gonzales|2006|p=323}} Ultimately, for Gadamer, the most important dynamic of conversation as a model for the interpretation of a text is \u201cthe give-and-take of question and answer.\u201d{{sfn|Gonzales|2006|p=323}}  In other words, the interpretation of a given text will change depending on the questions the interpreter asks of the\ntext. The \"meaning\" emerges not as an object that lies in the text or in the interpreter, but rather an event that results from the interaction of the two.\n\n''Truth and Method'' was published twice in English, and the revised edition is now considered authoritative. The German-language edition of Gadamer's Collected Works includes a volume in which Gadamer elaborates his argument and discusses the critical response to the book. Finally, Gadamer's essay on [[Paul Celan|Celan]] (entitled \"Who Am I and Who Are You?\") has been considered by many\u2014including Heidegger and Gadamer himself\u2014as a \"second volume\" or continuation of the argument in ''Truth and Method''.\n\n====Contributions to communication ethics====\nGadamer's ''Truth and Method'' has become an authoritative work in the [[communication ethics]] field, spawning several prominent ethics theories and guidelines.  The most profound of these is the formulation of the dialogic coordinates, a standard set of prerequisite communication elements necessary for inciting dialogue.  Adhering to Gadamer's theories regarding bias, communicators can better initiate dialogic transaction, allowing biases to merge and promote mutual understanding and learning.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Communication Ethics Literacy: Dialogue and Difference Arnett, Harden Fritz & Bell, Los Angeles 2009</ref>\n\n===Other works===\nGadamer also added philosophical substance to the notion of human health. In ''The Enigma of Health'', Gadamer explored what it means to heal, as a patient and a provider. In this work the practice and art of medicine are thoroughly examined, as is the inevitability of any cure.<ref name=\"Dostal-intro\">{{Cite book|author=Robert J.

Indeed, while ''Truth and Method'' became central to his later career, much of Gadamer's early life centered around studying Greek thinkers, [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] specifically. In the Italian introduction to ''Truth and Method'', Gadamer said that his work on Greek philosophy was \"the best and most original part\" of his career.{{sfn|Cesare|2007|p=1}} His book ''Plato's Dialectical Ethics'' looks at the ''[[Philebus]]'' dialogue through the lens of [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and the philosophy of [[Martin Heidegger]].<ref name=\"Dostal-intro\" />\n\n==Prizes and awards==\n:1971: [[Pour le M\u00e9rite]] and the [[Reuchlin Prize]]\n:1972: [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany|Great Cross of Merit with Star of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]]\n:1979: [[Sigmund Freud Award]] for scientific prose and [[Hegel Prize]]\n:1986: [[Jaspers Prize]]\n:1990: Great Cross of Merit with Star and Sash of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany\n:1993: Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany\n:12 January 1996: appointed an honorary member of the [[Saxon Academy of Sciences]] in [[Leipzig]]\n;Honorary doctorates:\n:1995: [[University of Wroc\u0142aw]]\n:1996: [[University of Leipzig]]\n:1999: [[Philipps-University Marburg]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n;Primary\n*''[[Dialogue and Dialectic: Eight Hermeneutical Studies on Plato]]''.

His mother, Emma Karoline Johanna Geiese (1869\u20131904) died of [[diabetes]] while Hans-Georg was four years old, and he later noted that this may have had an effect on his decision to not pursue scientific studies. [[Jean Grondin]] describes Gadamer as finding in his mother \"a poetic and almost religious counterpart to the iron fist of his father\".{{sfn|Grondin|2003|p=21}} Gadamer did not serve during [[World War I]] for reasons of ill health{{sfn|Grondin|2003|p=45}} and similarly was exempted from serving during [[World War II]] due to [[polio]].{{sfn|Grondin|2003|p=46}}\n\nHe later studied classics and philosophy in the [[University of Breslau]]{{sfn|Grondin|2003|p=37}} under [[Richard H\u00f6nigswald]], but soon moved back to the University of Marburg to study with the [[Neo-Kantian]] philosophers [[Paul Natorp]] (his [[doctoral thesis]] advisor) and [[Nicolai Hartmann]].

He and Heidegger became close, and when Heidegger received a position at [[University of Marburg|Marburg]], Gadamer followed him there, where he became one of a group of students such as [[Leo Strauss]], [[Karl L\u00f6with]], and [[Hannah Arendt]]. It was Heidegger's influence that gave Gadamer's thought its distinctive cast and led him away from the earlier neo-Kantian influences of Natorp and Hartmann.

Gadamer did not join the Nazis, and he did not serve in the army because of the polio he had contracted in 1922.

The debate was inconclusive, but marked the beginning of warm relations between the two men. It was Gadamer who secured Habermas's first professorship in the University of Heidelberg.\n\nIn 1968, Gadamer invited [[Tomonobu Imamichi]] for lectures at Heidelberg, but their relationship became very cool after Imamichi alleged that Heidegger had taken his concept of ''[[Dasein]]'' out of [[Okakura Kakuzo]]'s concept of ''das in-der-Welt-sein'' (to be in the [[being in the world]]) expressed in ''[[The Book of Tea]]'', which Imamichi's teacher had offered to Heidegger in 1919, after having followed lessons with him the year before.<ref name=\"Imamichi\">{{cite web |first=Tomonobu |last=Imamichi |title=In Search of Wisdom.

A last meeting between Gadamer and Derrida was held at the Stift of Heidelberg in July 2001, coordinated by Derrida's students Joseph Cohen and Raphael Zagury-Orly.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} This meeting marked, in many ways, a turn in their philosophical encounter. After Gadamer's death, Derrida called their failure to find common ground one of the worst debacles of his life and expressed, in the main obituary for Gadamer, his great personal and philosophical respect. [[Richard J. Bernstein]] said that \"[a] genuine dialogue between Gadamer and Derrida has never taken place.

Gadamer's goal was to uncover the nature of human understanding. In ''Truth and Method'', Gadamer argued that \"truth\" and \"method\" were at odds with one another. For Gadamer, \"the experience of art is exemplary in its provision of truths that are inaccessible by scientific methods, and this experience is projected to the whole domain of human sciences.\"<ref>Skorin-Kapov, Jadranka (2016), \"The Intertwining of Aesthetics and Ethics: Exceeding of Expectations, Ecstasy, Sublimity,\" Lexington Books, {{ISBN|978-1498524568}}</ref> He was critical of two approaches to the [[human science]]s (''[[Geisteswissenschaft]]en''). On the one hand, he was critical of modern approaches to humanities that modeled themselves on the natural sciences, which simply sought to \u201cobjectively\u201d observe and analyze texts and art. On the other hand, he took issue with the traditional German approaches to the humanities, represented for instance by [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] and [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], who believed that meaning, as an object, could be found within a text through a particular process that allowed for a connection with the author's thoughts that led to the creation of a text (Schleiermacher),{{sfn|Schleiermacher|Wojcik|Haas|1978|pp=5, 10}} or the situation that led to an expression of human inner life (Dilthey).{{sfn|Palmer|1969|p=98}}\n\nHowever, Gadamer argued meaning and understanding are not objects to be found through certain methods, but are inevitable phenomena.{{sfn|Palmer|1969|p=163}}  Hermeneutics is not a process in which an interpreter finds a particular meaning, but \u201ca philosophical effort to account for understanding as an ontological\u2014the ontological\u2014process of man.\u201d{{sfn|Palmer|1969|p=163}} Thus, Gadamer is not giving a prescriptive method on how to understand, but rather he is working to examine how understanding, whether of texts, artwork, or experience, is possible at all.  Gadamer intended ''Truth and Method'' to be a description of what we always do when we interpret things (even if we do not know it): \"My real concern was and is philosophic: not what we do or what we ought to do, but what happens to us over and above our wanting and doing\".<ref>Truth and Method 2nd ed. Sheed and Ward, London 1989 XXVIII</ref>\n\nAs a result of [[Martin Heidegger]]\u2019s temporal analysis of human existence, Gadamer argued that people have a so-called historically-effected [[consciousness]] (''wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewu\u00dftsein''), and that they are embedded in the particular history and culture that shaped them. However the historical consciousness is not an object over and against our existence, but \u201ca stream in which we move and participate, in every act of understanding.\u201d{{sfn|Palmer|1969|p=117}} Therefore, people do not come to any given thing without some form of preunderstanding established by this historical stream.  The tradition in which an interpreter stands establishes \"prejudices\" that affect how he or she will make interpretations. For Gadamer, these prejudices are not something that hinders our ability to make interpretations, but are both integral to the reality of being, and \u201care the basis of our being able to understand history at all.\u201d{{sfn|Palmer|1969|p=182}} Gadamer criticized Enlightenment thinkers for harboring a \"prejudice against prejudices\".{{sfn|Gonzales|2006|p=328}}\n\nFor Gadamer, interpreting a text involves a [[fusion of horizons]] (''Horizontverschmelzung'').  Both the text and the interpreter find themselves within a particular historical tradition, or \u201chorizon.\u201d  Each horizon is expressed through the medium of language, and both text and interpreter belong to and participate in history and language.  This \u201cbelongingness\u201d to language is the common ground between interpreter and text that makes understanding possible.  As an interpreter seeks to understand a text, a common horizon emerges.  This fusion of horizons does not mean the interpreter now fully understands some kind of objective meaning, but is \u201can event in which a world opens itself to him.\u201d{{sfn|Palmer|1969|p=209}} The result is a deeper understanding of the subject matter.\n\nGadamer further explains the hermeneutical experience as a dialogue.  To justify this, he uses [[Plato#The dialogues|Plato's dialogues]] as a model for how we are to engage with written texts.  To be in conversation, one must take seriously \u201cthe truth claim of the person with whom one is conversing.\u201d{{sfn|Gonzales|2006|pp=322\u2013323}} Further, each participant in the conversation relates to one another insofar as they belong to the common goal of understanding one another.{{sfn|Gonzales|2006|p=323}} Ultimately, for Gadamer, the most important dynamic of conversation as a model for the interpretation of a text is \u201cthe give-and-take of question and answer.\u201d{{sfn|Gonzales|2006|p=323}}  In other words, the interpretation of a given text will change depending on the questions the interpreter asks of the\ntext. The \"meaning\" emerges not as an object that lies in the text or in the interpreter, but rather an event that results from the interaction of the two.\n\n''Truth and Method'' was published twice in English, and the revised edition is now considered authoritative. The German-language edition of Gadamer's Collected Works includes a volume in which Gadamer elaborates his argument and discusses the critical response to the book. Finally, Gadamer's essay on [[Paul Celan|Celan]] (entitled \"Who Am I and Who Are You?\") has been considered by many\u2014including Heidegger and Gadamer himself\u2014as a \"second volume\" or continuation of the argument in ''Truth and Method''.\n\n====Contributions to communication ethics====\nGadamer's ''Truth and Method'' has become an authoritative work in the [[communication ethics]] field, spawning several prominent ethics theories and guidelines.  The most profound of these is the formulation of the dialogic coordinates, a standard set of prerequisite communication elements necessary for inciting dialogue.  Adhering to Gadamer's theories regarding bias, communicators can better initiate dialogic transaction, allowing biases to merge and promote mutual understanding and learning.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Communication Ethics Literacy: Dialogue and Difference Arnett, Harden Fritz & Bell, Los Angeles 2009</ref>\n\n===Other works===\nGadamer also added philosophical substance to the notion of human health. In ''The Enigma of Health'', Gadamer explored what it means to heal, as a patient and a provider. In this work the practice and art of medicine are thoroughly examined, as is the inevitability of any cure.<ref name=\"Dostal-intro\">{{Cite book|author=Robert J. Dostal|chapter=Introduction|title=The Cambridge Companion to Gadamer|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521801931}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to his work in hermeneutics, Gadamer is also well known for a long list of publications on Greek philosophy. Indeed, while ''Truth and Method'' became central to his later career, much of Gadamer's early life centered around studying Greek thinkers, [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] specifically. In the Italian introduction to ''Truth and Method'', Gadamer said that his work on Greek philosophy was \"the best and most original part\" of his career.{{sfn|Cesare|2007|p=1}} His book ''Plato's Dialectical Ethics'' looks at the ''[[Philebus]]'' dialogue through the lens of [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and the philosophy of [[Martin Heidegger]].<ref name=\"Dostal-intro\" />\n\n==Prizes and awards==\n:1971: [[Pour le M\u00e9rite]] and the [[Reuchlin Prize]]\n:1972: [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany|Great Cross of Merit with Star of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]]\n:1979: [[Sigmund Freud Award]] for scientific prose and [[Hegel Prize]]\n:1986: [[Jaspers Prize]]\n:1990: Great Cross of Merit with Star and Sash of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany\n:1993: Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany\n:12 January 1996: appointed an honorary member of the [[Saxon Academy of Sciences]] in [[Leipzig]]\n;Honorary doctorates:\n:1995: [[University of Wroc\u0142aw]]\n:1996: [[University of Leipzig]]\n:1999: [[Philipps-University Marburg]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n;Primary\n*''[[Dialogue and Dialectic: Eight Hermeneutical Studies on Plato]]''.

Its capital is [[Kaduna]]. it is ranked 4<sup>th</sup> by land area and 3<sup>rd</sup> by population in Nigeria. The state capital [[Kaduna]] was  the former capital city of the British protectorate of [[Northern Nigeria]] region (1923-1966) after [[Zungeru]] (1903\u20131923) and [[Lokoja]] (1897\u20131903).\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word ''Kaduna'' is said to be a corruption of the Hausa word 'Kadduna' for \u201ccrocodiles<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Kaduna-Nigeria|title=Kaduna {{!}} Location, History, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref>\u201d Another version of the etymology of the name is a narrative linked to the [[Gbagyi language|Gbagyi]] word/name 'Odna' for a river.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of the Gbagyi Language|last=Shekwo|first=Joseph Amali|publisher=Centre for Adult Education and Extension Services, Ahmadu Bello University|year=1979|isbn=|location=Zaria|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIt is indicative that the name, Kaduna, was taken up by Lord [[Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard|Frederick Lugard]] and his colonial colleagues when they moved the capital of the then Northern Region from Zungeru to Kaduna city in 1916. This move of the colonial office to Kaduna city started in 1912-1918/20 with the initial effort having been made in 1902 from Jebba to Zungeru.\n\nAt the start of British colonial rule in northern Nigeria the people groups who live in the area became 'Northern Nigerians'- a construct which continues even today. By 1967 these people groups again were carved into 'North Central State'; this was the case until 1975 that 'Kaduna State' was formerly created by the then military leader, Gen. [[Murtala Mohammed]], with all distinct identities amalgamated into one state without a referendum. The state hence is the successor of the old [[Northern Region, Nigeria|Northern Region]] of Nigeria, which had its capital at Kaduna which is now the state capital to about 6.3 million people (Nigerian census figure, 2006).\n\nIn 1967, the old Northern Region was divided into six states in the north, leaving Kaduna as the capital of North-Central State, whose name was changed to Kaduna State in 1976. Meanwhile, Kaduna State was further divided in 1987, creating [[Katsina State]]. Under the governance of Kaduna are the ancient cities of [[Zaria]], [[Kafanchan]], and [[Nok]], the area where Africa's earliest civilization is recorded to have been excavated.

Its capital is [[Kaduna]]. it is ranked 4<sup>th</sup> by land area and 3<sup>rd</sup> by population in Nigeria. The state capital [[Kaduna]] was  the former capital city of the British protectorate of [[Northern Nigeria]] region (1923-1966) after [[Zungeru]] (1903\u20131923) and [[Lokoja]] (1897\u20131903).\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word ''Kaduna'' is said to be a corruption of the Hausa word 'Kadduna' for \u201ccrocodiles<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Kaduna-Nigeria|title=Kaduna {{!}} Location, History, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref>\u201d Another version of the etymology of the name is a narrative linked to the [[Gbagyi language|Gbagyi]] word/name 'Odna' for a river.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of the Gbagyi Language|last=Shekwo|first=Joseph Amali|publisher=Centre for Adult Education and Extension Services, Ahmadu Bello University|year=1979|isbn=|location=Zaria|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIt is indicative that the name, Kaduna, was taken up by Lord [[Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard|Frederick Lugard]] and his colonial colleagues when they moved the capital of the then Northern Region from Zungeru to Kaduna city in 1916. This move of the colonial office to Kaduna city started in 1912-1918/20 with the initial effort having been made in 1902 from Jebba to Zungeru.\n\nAt the start of British colonial rule in northern Nigeria the people groups who live in the area became 'Northern Nigerians'- a construct which continues even today. By 1967 these people groups again were carved into 'North Central State'; this was the case until 1975 that 'Kaduna State' was formerly created by the then military leader, Gen. [[Murtala Mohammed]], with all distinct identities amalgamated into one state without a referendum. The state hence is the successor of the old [[Northern Region, Nigeria|Northern Region]] of Nigeria, which had its capital at Kaduna which is now the state capital to about 6.3 million people (Nigerian census figure, 2006).\n\nIn 1967, the old Northern Region was divided into six states in the north, leaving Kaduna as the capital of North-Central State, whose name was changed to Kaduna State in 1976. Meanwhile, Kaduna State was further divided in 1987, creating [[Katsina State]]. Under the governance of Kaduna are the ancient cities of [[Zaria]], [[Kafanchan]], and [[Nok]], the area where Africa's earliest civilization is recorded to have been excavated. The most intriguing aspect of this area is that the colonial construction and its post-colonial successor called 'Nigeria' hardly documented the history or the method of how Kaduna state's people groups encompassed in these constructs define and identify themselves as such the people groups who populate the area have lived in near oblivion or obscurity as they often are thought of as [[Hausa people]].\n\n[[Zazzau]] is said to have been founded since 1536 and later was renamed after the prominent Queen Zaria known as Amina, the [[Hausa people]] of [[Zaria]] are said to be the old ancestral of the region.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Zaria-Nigeria|title=Zaria {{!}} Nigeria|newspaper=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=2016-11-05}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe state is located at the Northern part of Nigeria's High Plains.

Kaduna was substantially reduced in size when its northern half became Katsina state in 1987.  Now Kaduna is bordered by several states, which includes the states of Zamfara, Katsina, and Kano to the north; while Bauchi and Plateau to the east;  and Nassawara to the south; and Niger to the west.also, Abuja Federal Capital Territory also borders Kaduna state to the southwest. the state is bordered by seven states in counts as mentioned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Kaduna-state-Nigeria|title=Kaduna {{!}} state, Nigeria|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref> The state was ranked number four by total area of land and number three by population.The Kaduna River, is a tributary of  River Niger,  which flows roughly east to west through the centre of the state.
