Gogo would win his next two terms in 1979 and 1982 with increasing majorities achieving almost 70% of the popular vote.\n\nGogo would lose significant popularity upon re-election to his fourth term in 1986. He would fall from 70% the previous election to under half. He would hold his seat for a final term in 1989 when he took just over 45% of the popular vote. In his last term in office Premier [[Don Getty]] appointed Gogo as Minister of Advanced education He held that until 1992. Gogo retired from dissolution of the Assembly in 1993.\n\nThe 1993 election saw a hotly contested race between Progressive Conservative candidate [[Clint Dunford]] and Liberal candidate Michael Dietrich. Dunford won by a razor thin margin of just over 100 votes to hold the seat for his party and taking just over 41% of the popular vote.\n\nDunford was re-elected in 1997 winning a slightly higher plurality. After the election he was appointed to the provincial cabinet by Premier [[Ralph Klein]] as Minister of Advanced Education and Career Development. In 1999 he was shuffled to the Minister of Human Resources and Employment portfolio.\n\nDunford ran for his third term in 2001 increasing his plurality slightly taking 48% of the popular vote and kept his cabinet post. He ran for his fourth term in office in 2004 and fell to an all-time low holding his seat with just 39% of the popular vote. After that election he was shuffled to the Minister of Economic Development until 2006. Dunford retired from the legislature in 2008.\n\nThe fourth representative returned from the riding was Progressive Conservative candidate Greg Weadick who won his first term as MLA in [[Alberta general election, 2008|2008]], and was re-elected in [[Alberta general election, 2012|2012]], but was defeated in the [[2015 Alberta general election|2015 general election]] by [[Shannon Phillips]] of the [[Alberta New Democratic Party|NDP]]. In [[Alberta general election, 2019|2019]], Phillips held onto the riding with a reduced margin of victory over the second place finishing UCP candidate with just 45% of the popular vote.\n\n==Legislature results==\n\n===Elections in the 1970s===\n{{CANelec/top|AB|1971|Lethbridge-West|percent=yes}}\n{{CANelec|AB|Social Credit|[[Richard Gruenwald]]|4,169|54.93}}\n{{CANelec|AB|PC|R.J.

Prior to 1971 the city returned candidates from a number of different banners. The first representative returned in the election held that year was Social Credit candidate Richard Gruenwald who won the district with well over half of the popular vote.\n\nGruenwald would run for a second term in the 1975 election and would be defeated finishing a distant second place behind Progressive Conservative candidate [[John Gogo]] who took almost 60% of the popular vote. Gogo would win his next two terms in 1979 and 1982 with increasing majorities achieving almost 70% of the popular vote.\n\nGogo would lose significant popularity upon re-election to his fourth term in 1986. He would fall from 70% the previous election to under half. He would hold his seat for a final term in 1989 when he took just over 45% of the popular vote. In his last term in office Premier [[Don Getty]] appointed Gogo as Minister of Advanced education He held that until 1992. Gogo retired from dissolution of the Assembly in 1993.\n\nThe 1993 election saw a hotly contested race between Progressive Conservative candidate [[Clint Dunford]] and Liberal candidate Michael Dietrich. Dunford won by a razor thin margin of just over 100 votes to hold the seat for his party and taking just over 41% of the popular vote.\n\nDunford was re-elected in 1997 winning a slightly higher plurality. After the election he was appointed to the provincial cabinet by Premier [[Ralph Klein]] as Minister of Advanced Education and Career Development. In 1999 he was shuffled to the Minister of Human Resources and Employment portfolio.\n\nDunford ran for his third term in 2001 increasing his plurality slightly taking 48% of the popular vote and kept his cabinet post. He ran for his fourth term in office in 2004 and fell to an all-time low holding his seat with just 39% of the popular vote. After that election he was shuffled to the Minister of Economic Development until 2006. Dunford retired from the legislature in 2008.\n\nThe fourth representative returned from the riding was Progressive Conservative candidate Greg Weadick who won his first term as MLA in [[Alberta general election, 2008|2008]], and was re-elected in [[Alberta general election, 2012|2012]], but was defeated in the [[2015 Alberta general election|2015 general election]] by [[Shannon Phillips]] of the [[Alberta New Democratic Party|NDP]]. In [[Alberta general election, 2019|2019]], Phillips held onto the riding with a reduced margin of victory over the second place finishing UCP candidate with just 45% of the popular vote.\n\n==Legislature results==\n\n===Elections in the 1970s===\n{{CANelec/top|AB|1971|Lethbridge-West|percent=yes}}\n{{CANelec|AB|Social Credit|[[Richard Gruenwald]]|4,169|54.93}}\n{{CANelec|AB|PC|R.J.

His real name is Jayson Thompson, but decided to take on his mother's maiden name of 'Munly' instead. He has played a significant role in the development of the \"Denver Sound\", music that mixes elements of [[country music|country]], [[Gothic rock|gothic]], [[Folk music|folk]] and [[gospel music|gospel]]. He is a current member of [[Slim Cessna's Auto Club]], Munly & The Lupercalians, and Denver Broncos UK (DBUK). He was the leader of Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots from 2000 to 2006. \n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood & upbringing ===\n\nMunly was born and raised [[Quebec, Canada|Quebec, Canada]] in a \"stereotypical Catholic family\" with two parents and two siblings - one brother<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\">{{cite news |last1=Solomon |first1=Jon |title=Munly talks Slim Cessna's Auto Club's new album and seeing Billy Bragg for the first time |url=https://www.westword.com/music/munly-talks-slim-cessnas-auto-clubs-new-album-and-seeing-billy-bragg-for-the-first-time-5719289 |accessdate=23 March 2020 |work=Westword |date=December 27, 2012 |ref=Munly Acting Westword}}</ref> and one sister,<ref name=\"Outsight Radio\">{{cite news |title=Munly Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://archive.org/details/OutsightRadioHoursInterviews2000-2010/MunnScott.rm |accessdate=4 April 2020 |work=Outsight Radio Hours |issue=Episode #252 |publisher=Archive.org |date=October 26, 2004}}</ref> with whom he's had a fraught relationship (as implied in a 2004 interview). <ref name=\"Coolstreams\">{{cite web |title=CoolStreams Internet Radio - Jay Munly |url=http://musicsojourn.com/AR/Alt/page/m/MunlyJay.htm |website=musicsojourn.com |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nHe was a mild-mannered child growing up. In his own words:  \n\n''{{quote|\"I used to sneak the banjo out of its case and play it. I would get yelled at because that was about the worst thing I did.

He also spent time at his family's lakeside summer retreat in Ellsworth, Ohio.\n\n===Interest in ice hockey===\n\nTaking interest in [[ice hockey]] as a young man in Canada, Munly grew up a [[Montreal Canadiens]] fan.\n\nHe played hockey as a child in Canada and the U.S. before a related injury side-lined him. In a 2012 interview with [[Westword]], he says that his brother took him to the [[Bob Johnson]] ice hockey school to play. <ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\">{{cite news |last1=Solomon |first1=Jon |title=Munly talks Slim Cessna's Auto Club's new album and seeing Billy Bragg for the first time |url=https://www.westword.com/music/munly-talks-slim-cessnas-auto-clubs-new-album-and-seeing-billy-bragg-for-the-first-time-5719289 |accessdate=23 March 2020 |work=Westword |date=December 27, 2012 |ref=Munly Acting Westword}}</ref>\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from a hockey injury. He also had some familial ties: his father and grandfather owned and played banjos. His father also made a [[dulcimer]] for his mother as a gift, although she did not play it. <ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Songwriting, musical themes, and genres===\n\nMunly is the chief songwriter for both his solo endeavors and side projects. It is a role that he is happy to take on by himself, believing that a band's success is dependent on playing to individual strengths rather than collaboration with members on each part of the musical process.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\">{{cite news |last1=Baranauskas |first1=Sarah |title=DBUK |url=http://marqueemag.com/2019/07/dbuk/ |accessdate=4 April 2020 |work=Marquee Magazine |date=July 1, 2019 |ref=DBUK Marquee}}</ref>\n\nHe also admits that he can be \"selfish\" with his written material and serious about lyrical preservation.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\">{{cite news |last1=Solomon |first1=Jon |title=Munly talks Slim Cessna's Auto Club's new album and seeing Billy Bragg for the first time |url=https://www.westword.com/music/munly-talks-slim-cessnas-auto-clubs-new-album-and-seeing-billy-bragg-for-the-first-time-5719289 |accessdate=23 March 2020 |work=Westword |date=December 27, 2012 |ref=Munly Acting Westword}}</ref>\n\nHis music has ties to [[alt-country]] and [[Gothabilly|Gothic-Americana]]. Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist, but has worked with several musicians that are featured performers on his albums. However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic. <ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitates to call himself a \"singer-songwriter\":\n\n''{{quote|\"It's kind of rough being a solo artist. [...] If you're a male and you're from Boulder and you have a guitar, people automatically want to compare you to all that singer-songwriter crap. The papers are like, `Hmmm, the guy warming up?

''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002. Each of these albums were re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released as limited editions through Smooch Records in 2006. Only 1,000 copies of each were printed.\n\n===Slim Cessna's Auto Club===\n\nMunly joined Slim Cessna's Auto Club between 1998 and 1999 after being friends with Slim Cessna for a few years. This was during the time that Munly was recording ''Galvanized Yankee'' in New York. Part of the reason he agreed to join was that he liked how the band was operated by existing members. Since then, he has been the band's primary songwriter and shares frontman/vocalist duties with Cessna. ''Always Say Please and Thank You'' (2000) is the first SCAC album that Munly appears on. <ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref>\n\nThe song \"SCAC 101\" on ''Cipher'' (2008) is about how Munly came to join the band.\n\n===Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots===\n\nMunly and The Lee Lewis Harlots were active from 2000 to 2006. They were a six-piece [[alternative country]] band with mostly stringed instruments. The members were: Munly ([[vocals]], [[banjo]], [[guitar]]), Elin Palmer ([[violin]], [[nyckelharpa]], string arrangements), Frieda Stalheim (violin), Rebecca Vera ([[cello]]), Paul Bradley ([[upright bass]]), and Jeff Linsenmaier ([[drums]]). <ref name=\"MM Info\">{{cite web |title=Info |url=https://www.munlymunly.com/info.html |website=munly munly |accessdate=24 March 2020 |ref=MM Info}}</ref> Some members of the band have also contributed backing vocals, though it is not known exactly who.\n\nTheir only album, ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004), has received much critical acclaim. It was re-released on vinyl in 2013 with three additional tracks. Of the three, only one is a previously unreleased Harlots track: \"[[Rufus Wainwright]], I'm Coming After You\".\n\nIn July 2006, Munly and the Lee Lewis Harlots was voted the best band in [[Colorado]] by over 100 music experts in the [[Denver Post]] Underground Music Poll. <ref name=\"Munly Denver Post\">{{cite news |last1=Baca |first1=Ricardo |title=Munly takes No 1. in Post music poll |url=https://www.denverpost.com/2006/07/20/munly-takes-no-1-in-post-music-poll/ |accessdate=24 March 2020 |work=Denver Post |publisher=MediaNewsGroup, Inc. |date=July 20, 2006 |ref=Munly Denver Post}}</ref>\n\n===Munly & The Lupercalians===\n\nMunly is currently working on a multi-album set tentatively titled \"The Kinnery Of Lupercalia\", which will be about the fictional town of Lupercalia and the people who live there. \n\nThe first of the four albums, [[Petr & the Wulf]], was released in 2010.  The work is loosely based on the [[Peter and the Wolf]] composition by [[Sergei Prokofiev]].\n\nThe second, \"Kinnery of Lupercalia: The Undelivered Legion\" is expected to be released in the fall or winter of 2020, through the label SCAC UNINCORPORATED.\n\nThe current members are: Munly, Slim Cessna, Lord Dwight Pentacost, Rebecca Vera, and Andrew Warner.\n\n===Denver Broncos UK (DBUK)===\n\nDBUK is an experimental folk quartet composed of Auto Club members Munly ([[vocals]], [[guitar]]), Lord Dwight Pentacost (vocals, [[autoharp]], [[melodica]], [[banjo]], [[percussion]]), Slim Cessna (vocals, percussion, washtub drum), and Rebecca Vera (vocals, [[cello]], keys, percussion).\n\nThe band formed in 2006 with just Munly, Dwight, and Slim Cessna as members.<ref name=\"Munly Denver Post\">{{cite news |last1=Baca |first1=Ricardo |title=Munly takes No 1. in Post music poll |url=https://www.denverpost.com/2006/07/20/munly-takes-no-1-in-post-music-poll/ |accessdate=24 March 2020 |work=Denver Post |publisher=MediaNewsGroup, Inc. |date=July 20, 2006 |ref=Munly Denver Post}}</ref>\n\nThey have released two albums: ''Songs One Through Eight'' (2015) and ''Songs Nine Through Sixteen'' (2019).

His real name is Jayson Thompson, but decided to take on his mother's maiden name of 'Munly' instead. He has played a significant role in the development of the \"Denver Sound\", music that mixes elements of [[country music|country]], [[Gothic rock|gothic]], [[Folk music|folk]] and [[gospel music|gospel]]. He is a current member of [[Slim Cessna's Auto Club]], Munly & The Lupercalians, and Denver Broncos UK (DBUK). He was the leader of Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots from 2000 to 2006. \n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood & upbringing ===\n\nMunly was born and raised [[Quebec, Canada|Quebec, Canada]] in a \"stereotypical Catholic family\" with two parents and two siblings - one brother<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\">{{cite news |last1=Solomon |first1=Jon |title=Munly talks Slim Cessna's Auto Club's new album and seeing Billy Bragg for the first time |url=https://www.westword.com/music/munly-talks-slim-cessnas-auto-clubs-new-album-and-seeing-billy-bragg-for-the-first-time-5719289 |accessdate=23 March 2020 |work=Westword |date=December 27, 2012 |ref=Munly Acting Westword}}</ref> and one sister,<ref name=\"Outsight Radio\">{{cite news |title=Munly Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://archive.org/details/OutsightRadioHoursInterviews2000-2010/MunnScott.rm |accessdate=4 April 2020 |work=Outsight Radio Hours |issue=Episode #252 |publisher=Archive.org |date=October 26, 2004}}</ref> with whom he's had a fraught relationship (as implied in a 2004 interview). <ref name=\"Coolstreams\">{{cite web |title=CoolStreams Internet Radio - Jay Munly |url=http://musicsojourn.com/AR/Alt/page/m/MunlyJay.htm |website=musicsojourn.com |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nHe was a mild-mannered child growing up. In his own words:  \n\n''{{quote|\"I used to sneak the banjo out of its case and play it. I would get yelled at because that was about the worst thing I did.

He also spent time at his family's lakeside summer retreat in Ellsworth, Ohio.\n\n===Interest in ice hockey===\n\nTaking interest in [[ice hockey]] as a young man in Canada, Munly grew up a [[Montreal Canadiens]] fan.\n\nHe played hockey as a child in Canada and the U.S. before a related injury side-lined him. In a 2012 interview with [[Westword]], he says that his brother took him to the [[Bob Johnson]] ice hockey school to play. <ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\">{{cite news |last1=Solomon |first1=Jon |title=Munly talks Slim Cessna's Auto Club's new album and seeing Billy Bragg for the first time |url=https://www.westword.com/music/munly-talks-slim-cessnas-auto-clubs-new-album-and-seeing-billy-bragg-for-the-first-time-5719289 |accessdate=23 March 2020 |work=Westword |date=December 27, 2012 |ref=Munly Acting Westword}}</ref>\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from a hockey injury. He also had some familial ties: his father and grandfather owned and played banjos. His father also made a [[dulcimer]] for his mother as a gift, although she did not play it. <ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Songwriting, musical themes, and genres===\n\nMunly is the chief songwriter for both his solo endeavors and side projects.

Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist, but has worked with several musicians that are featured performers on his albums. However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic. <ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitates to call himself a \"singer-songwriter\":\n\n''{{quote|\"It's kind of rough being a solo artist.

''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002. Each of these albums were re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released as limited editions through Smooch Records in 2006. Only 1,000 copies of each were printed.\n\n===Slim Cessna's Auto Club===\n\nMunly joined Slim Cessna's Auto Club between 1998 and 1999 after being friends with Slim Cessna for a few years. This was during the time that Munly was recording ''Galvanized Yankee'' in New York. Part of the reason he agreed to join was that he liked how the band was operated by existing members. Since then, he has been the band's primary songwriter and shares frontman/vocalist duties with Cessna. ''Always Say Please and Thank You'' (2000) is the first SCAC album that Munly appears on. <ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref>\n\nThe song \"SCAC 101\" on ''Cipher'' (2008) is about how Munly came to join the band.\n\n===Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots===\n\nMunly and The Lee Lewis Harlots were active from 2000 to 2006. They were a six-piece [[alternative country]] band with mostly stringed instruments. The members were: Munly ([[vocals]], [[banjo]], [[guitar]]), Elin Palmer ([[violin]], [[nyckelharpa]], string arrangements), Frieda Stalheim (violin), Rebecca Vera ([[cello]]), Paul Bradley ([[upright bass]]), and Jeff Linsenmaier ([[drums]]). <ref name=\"MM Info\">{{cite web |title=Info |url=https://www.munlymunly.com/info.html |website=munly munly |accessdate=24 March 2020 |ref=MM Info}}</ref> Some members of the band have also contributed backing vocals, though it is not known exactly who.\n\nTheir only album, ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004), has received much critical acclaim. It was re-released on vinyl in 2013 with three additional tracks. Of the three, only one is a previously unreleased Harlots track: \"[[Rufus Wainwright]], I'm Coming After You\".\n\nIn July 2006, Munly and the Lee Lewis Harlots was voted the best band in [[Colorado]] by over 100 music experts in the [[Denver Post]] Underground Music Poll. <ref name=\"Munly Denver Post\">{{cite news |last1=Baca |first1=Ricardo |title=Munly takes No 1. in Post music poll |url=https://www.denverpost.com/2006/07/20/munly-takes-no-1-in-post-music-poll/ |accessdate=24 March 2020 |work=Denver Post |publisher=MediaNewsGroup, Inc. |date=July 20, 2006 |ref=Munly Denver Post}}</ref>\n\n===Munly & The Lupercalians===\n\nMunly is currently working on a multi-album set tentatively titled \"The Kinnery Of Lupercalia\", which will be about the fictional town of Lupercalia and the people who live there. \n\nThe first of the four albums, [[Petr & the Wulf]], was released in 2010.  The work is loosely based on the [[Peter and the Wolf]] composition by [[Sergei Prokofiev]].\n\nThe second, \"Kinnery of Lupercalia: The Undelivered Legion\" is expected to be released in the fall or winter of 2020, through the label SCAC UNINCORPORATED.\n\nThe current members are: Munly, Slim Cessna, Lord Dwight Pentacost, Rebecca Vera, and Andrew Warner.\n\n===Denver Broncos UK (DBUK)===\n\nDBUK is an experimental folk quartet composed of Auto Club members Munly ([[vocals]], [[guitar]]), Lord Dwight Pentacost (vocals, [[autoharp]], [[melodica]], [[banjo]], [[percussion]]), Slim Cessna (vocals, percussion, washtub drum), and Rebecca Vera (vocals, [[cello]], keys, percussion).\n\nThe band formed in 2006 with just Munly, Dwight, and Slim Cessna as members. \n\nThey have released two albums: ''Songs One Through Eight'' (2015) and ''Songs Nine Through Sixteen'' (2019). A vinyl was also released in 2018, combining the tracks on both albums: ''Songs One Through Sixteen''.\n\nThey also recorded a cover of \"Top Yourself\" by [[The Raconteurs]] for the album ''Rockin' Legends Pay Tribute to [[Jack White]]'' (2013).\n\n==Acting career==\n\nMunly went to college to pursue an acting degree for one semester before transferring to [[Columbia University]]. <ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\">{{cite news |last1=Solomon |first1=Jon |title=Munly talks Slim Cessna's Auto Club's new album and seeing Billy Bragg for the first time |url=https://www.westword.com/music/munly-talks-slim-cessnas-auto-clubs-new-album-and-seeing-billy-bragg-for-the-first-time-5719289 |accessdate=23 March 2020 |work=Westword |date=December 27, 2012 |ref=Munly Acting Westword}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Munly was personally contacted by [[Shooter Jennings]] to participate in his short film, [[The Other Life]], directed by [[Blake Judd]] in Kentucky. <ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\">{{cite news |last1=Solomon |first1=Jon |title=Munly talks Slim Cessna's Auto Club's new album and seeing Billy Bragg for the first time |url=https://www.westword.com/music/munly-talks-slim-cessnas-auto-clubs-new-album-and-seeing-billy-bragg-for-the-first-time-5719289 |accessdate=23 March 2020 |work=Westword |date=December 27, 2012 |ref=Munly Acting Westword}}</ref> He appears as a [[mortician]]. <ref name=\"Munly Acting IMDb\">{{cite web |title=Shooter Jennings' The Other Life (2013) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2616766/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_1 |website=IMDb |accessdate=23 March 2020 |ref=Munly Acting IMDb}}</ref>\n\nHe has also done voiceover work.
