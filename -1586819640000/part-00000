Although a landowner in rural [[Shropshire]], he made his fortune through more than 20 years' service to the [[City of London]]. MP for the City in five parliaments, he served as [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]] in 1554. He is celebrated as the author of one of the [[Books of authority]]. A prominent religious conservative, he founded a notable [[recusant]] dynasty. His surname is also rendered '''Brooke''', and occasionally '''Brook''', which are, for modern readers, better indicators of pronunciation.\n\n==Early life and education==\nRobert Broke was born by 1515:<ref name=broke>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/broke-robert-1515-58 The History of Parliament: Members 1509\u20131558 \u2013 BROKE, Robert (Author: Helen Miller)]</ref> his known Oxford admission date suggests the first decade of the century. He was the eldest son of\n:*'''Thomas Broke''' of [[Claverley]] in Shropshire.\n:*'''Margaret Grosvenor''', daughter of Humphrey Grosvenor of Farmcote, a hamlet to the south-east of Claverley.\nMost of early 16th century Shropshire was poor and underdeveloped sheep country, ruled by the [[Council of Wales and the Marches]]. Claverley was a large parish, dominated by the Gatacre family, whose seat was at its southern edge.\n\nBroke was admitted to study for a BA at Oxford university in 1521.<ref name=dnb>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Broke, Robert|volume=6}}</ref> As a very minor member of the [[landed gentry]], Broke needed to seek sources of income outside his own locality if he were to prosper, and he did so through London and the law. He studied at [[Strand Inn]], and from there was admitted to [[Middle Temple]] at some point between 1525 and 1528. He studied [[pleading]] with [[John Jenour]], a famous [[Prothonotary]] who influenced a whole generation of judges and [[jurist]]s.\n\n==Judicial career==\nBroke enjoyed considerable power as an official of the City of London before attaining high office in the last four years of his life. He was also the author of several important works on the law.\n\n===Offices held===\nBroke's judicial career began in 1536 when he was appointed [[Common Serjeant of London]] on the recommendation of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and the queen, [[Jane Seymour]]; how he gained such royal favour is unknown.<ref name=broke /> As Serjeant, Brooke attended court with the [[Lord Mayor of London]], as well as the [[Court of Aldermen]] and the [[Court of Common Council]], the City's main deliberative body. One of his tasks was to review, rewrite and put forward parliamentary [[Bill (law)|bill]]s proposed by the City. In 1540, Broke identified and returned a volume of the [[Letter-Books of the City of London]] that had been lost for some time. In January 1544 he was directed to intervene in the passage of two bills: one from the secondaries of the [[compter]], aiming to repeal the Act against untrue verdicts; another already put to the house that intended to prevent merchants buying steel and other goods, which Broke was told to forestall. In 1545 it was a bill to bring urban [[Sanctuary|sanctuaries]] under the control of borough and city authorities.\n\nAmong the legal officers, the Common Serjeant was second only to the [[Recorder of London]]. When this post became vacant in 1545, a letter from the king to the Aldermen once again proved decisive in securing it for Broke, and he took office on 12 November. On 17 November he was elected to parliament in place of his predecessor as Recorder, [[Roger Cholmley|Sir Roger Cholmley]]. On 19 November he was granted [[Freedom of the City of London]], a status tied to his membership of the [[Worshipful Company of Mercers]], the first in [[order of precedence]] of London's [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]].\n\nHolding these public offices did not prevent Broke pursuing private practice, and his signature is found on bills in chancery in the 1530s and 1540s. During this time he was also deputy chief steward for the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], and was created a [[Serjeant-at-law]] in 1552.\n\nOn 8 October 1554 he was appointed [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas]], probably a reward from [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]] for his performance as [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]]. He was knighted on 27 January 1555 by [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip]]. On 26 February, he presided over the trial of [[Charles Stourton, 8th Baron Stourton]],<ref name=dnb /> accused of murdering two men, William Hartgill and his son John. Stourton refused to plead and Broke threatened him with the punishment of being pressed to death. He then entered a plea of guilty and was executed on 16 March.\n\nBroke fell into conflict with the court's [[Puisne Justices]] when he appointed [[Thomas Gatacre]], his wife's brother, as Chief Prothonotary in 1557. The justices rejected him, and Broke's second choice, William Wheteley, was then allowed to take office despite judicial preference for another candidate.\n\n===Works===\nIn 1542 Broke became a [[bencher]] at the Middle Temple. As [[Reader (Inns of Court)|Autumn Reader]] that year, his subject was the 1540 Statute of Limitations; the reading circulated in manuscript and was subsequently printed in 1547. As Lent Reader in 1551, his subject was Pleas of the Crown, using chapter 18 of [[Magna Carta]] as the source: this also circulated in manuscript before being published in 1641, almost one hundred years after his death.<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3497 Oxford DNB: Broke, Sir Robert]</ref>\n\nBroke's most important work was ''La Graunde Abridgement'', a classified compendium of law as it then prevailed. Modelled on a work of the same name by [[Anthony Fitzherbert]], with which it is sometimes confused, it closely reflected Broke's own interests and experience.<ref name=broke /> A section is given over to the subject of London, great stress is placed on the role of parliament and it contains numerous cases in which Broke appeared. The book was not published until 1568, a decade after Broke's death, and was in [[Law French]], but it was an immediate success and came to be regarded as one of the [[Books of authority]] which courts can use as evidence of the law prevailing at the time. From it [[Richard Bellewe]] extracted important cases decided during the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI and Mary I and issued them as a separate compilation, soon rendered into English, and often cited as [[Brook's New Cases]]. This proved even more popular than the book from which it was extracted.\n\n==Political career==\nBroke served as a [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] for the [[City of London (elections to the Parliament of England)|City of London]] from 1545 until 1554, serving as [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]] of England in 1554.\n\n===Parliament of 1545===\nBroke was elected to the Parliament of 1545, the last of Henry VIII's reign, as a replacement for Sir Roger Cholmley. The parliament had been called as long ago as December 1544 and Cholmley was elected to Parliament on 19 January 1545. However, the opening of parliament was delayed until 23 November and Cholmley was appointed an [[Exchequer of Pleas#Barons|Exchequer Baron]] in the meantime, and so forced to relinquish both his post as Recorder and his parliamentary seat.<ref>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/cholmley-sir-roger-1495-1565 S.T.

The Recorder always resigned his seat when he left office: hence Broke's election was automatic. London was second only to the Crown as sponsor of legislation and solid legal acumen was in need at all times among its delegation to the House of Commons.\n\nBroke's colleagues in the 1545 parliament<ref name=london /> were [[Richard Gresham|Sir Richard Gresham]],<ref>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/gresham-sir-richard-1486-1549 S.T.

They were unsuccessful in getting their bill on sanctuaries through the House, but they were able to force a compromise over a bill intended to tighten up [[tithe]] collection from the citizens.<ref name=broke /> Such manoeuvring was typical of the concerns of London members in the [[Tudor period]].\n\n===Parliament of 1547===\n[[File:Sir Martin Bowes (1497-1566).jpg|thumb|Sir Martin Bowes, one of Broke's colleagues as MP for London.]]\nThe first Parliament of Edward VI lasted for most of the reign, and Broke was automatically returned to it. His aldermanic colleague was the goldsmith [[Martin Bowes|Sir Martin Bowes]],<ref name=london /> who had just served his term as Lord Mayor, having made so large a fortune at the [[Royal Mint]] that he was able easily to afford the \u00a310,000 to settle accounts when he and the other masters were found to have systematically debased the coinage.<ref>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/bowes-sir-martin-149697-1566 S.T. Bindoff (editor): The History of Parliament: Members 1509\u20131558 \u2013 BOWES, Sir Martin (Author: Helen Miller)]</ref> Bowes remained a London MP throughout Broke's term, apart from a short break in 1553. The first session of the parliament definitively abolished [[chantry|chantries]]. A major concern of the London members in the second and subsequent sessions of the parliament was to ensure that the City did not lose control of the wealth of the chantries within its boundaries to the king.<ref name=london /> Broke, who had been appointed commissioner for chantries in London, Westminster and Middlesex in 1546, during an earlier and abortive move toward abolition, must have had first-hand knowledge of the subject. The London members also wrestled with an Act to release [[Fee farm grant|fee farm]]s for three years to ensure that London got the best terms from it. Broke was told to work closely with one of the burgesses,<ref>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/bacon-thomas-1505-73-or-later S.T. Bindoff (editor): The History of Parliament: Members 1509\u20131558 \u2013 BACON, Thomas (Author: Helen Miller)]</ref> who had specialist knowledge of the subject. The other burgess, Thomas Curteys, was elected an alderman in 1551 \u2013 a move which he resisted to the point of imprisonment and which forced him to resign his seat in parliament.<ref>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/curteys-thomas-1502-59 S.T. Bindoff (editor): The History of Parliament: Members 1509\u20131558 \u2013 CURTEYS, Thomas (Author: Helen Miller)]</ref> In 1552 Broke was sent to lobby for further assurances from the Crown about lands recently purchased by the City.\n\nBroke was not limited to purely metropolitan concerns: as a skilled lawyer and draftsman, his talents were useful to the Crown and its ministers, and he was called upon by others if they thought his skills could benefit their cause. In 1549, he was given responsibility for a bill \"for preaching divers opinions.\" The third session of the parliament passed an Act to reform [[canon law]] and Broke was appointed to the commission set up for this purpose on 12 February 1552. In March 1552 he was one of those deputed to the redraft the [[Treason Act 1551]] to make it illegal to say that the king \"is an heretic, schismatic, infidel or usurper of the crown.\" He was one of those enlisted in 1549 by the supporters of [[Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland]], whose family had long held the [[High Sheriff of Westmorland|shrievalty of Westmorland]] by hereditary right: the supporters of his neighbour [[Thomas Wharton, 1st Baron Wharton]], were proposing to end the arrangement. He was also called in by [[John de Vere, 16th Earl of Oxford]] in 1552 to advise on legislation he was promoting to free himself of commitments made to [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]], the disgraced and executed former [[Lord Protector]].\n\n===Parliament of March 1553===\nBroke and Bowes were sent to the last parliament of Edward VI's reign, along with two burgesses: Curteys's replacement, John Blundell, and John Marshe \u2013 both Protestants and particularly long-serving MPs. The parliament met as the succession question loomed large and lasted for only the month of March 1553. However, the London delegation were initially more concerned with their campaign to get the use of fuel in London better regulated \u2013 in which they succeeded through the passage of an Act.\n\nHowever, Broke was soon given the question of the [[Maidstone (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidstone]] election to investigate, and this was perhaps a result of the succession crisis.<ref name=broke /> The town had been granted a [[charter]] of [[Municipal corporation|incorporation]] in 1549.<ref>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/constituencies/maidstone S.T. Bindoff (editor): The History of Parliament: Constituencies 1509\u20131558 \u2013 Maidstone (Author: N.M. Fuidge)]</ref> An election was called as soon as the parliament was summoned, but there was no reference to parliamentary representation in the charter. Broke was joined in his work by [[Richard Morgan (Tudor judge)|Richard Morgan]], a fellow judge and MP for [[Gloucester (UK Parliament constituency)|Gloucester]], as well as a fellow Catholic.<ref>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/morgan-richard-1510-56 S.T. Bindoff (editor): The History of Parliament: Members 1509\u20131558 \u2013 MORGAN, Richard (Author: P.S. Edwards)]</ref> They were enjoined by parliament to \"peruse the charter of Maidstone ... whether they may have burgesses in this House; and in the meantime the burgesses there to be absent out of this House till it be fully ordered.\" It was possible that supporters of [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland]] had used Maidstone's ambiguous status as a way of increasing parliamentary support for [[Lady Jane Grey]]'s succession, as the town was in the Protestant heartland of Kent. In fact, the [[lord of the manor]] was [[Thomas Wyatt the Younger|Thomas Wyatt]], the [[High Sheriff of Kent]] who made the return was [[John Guildford|Sir John Guildford]], a cousin of Dudley's wife, and one of the burgesses elected was a relative of both Dudley and Jane Grey. It is unclear what Broke and Morgan reported, or even if they delivered their report, but Maidstone was [[Disfranchisement|disfranchised]] and did not regain the right to parliamentary representation until it was granted by a new charter 1559.\n\n===Parliaments of Mary I===\nFor the parliament of October 1553 Bowes was temporarily replaced by [[Rowland Hill (MP)|Sir Rowland Hill]], a former Lord Mayor and a Protestant, making Broke the only Catholic MP from London. Despite this, and the momentous events of the summer, in which Dudley attempted to place Jane Grey on the throne and was defeated by a rebellion in favour of Mary, Edward's Catholic elder sister, the London delegation attended the parliament with an entirely commercial agenda. They toiled away at legislation to regulate London's physicians, [[Chandlery|chandlers]] in both wax and tallow, [[Tanning (leather)|leather tanners]] and [[Bowling|bowling alleys]], as well as a measure to deregulate the sale of wine.<ref name=london /> However, the Crown took initial steps to undo the [[English Reformation#Edward's Reformation|Edwardian Reformation]]. One of the key measures protecting it was the Treason Act, which Broke had helped to redraft. After a bill to repeal it had passed its [[second reading]], it was given to Broke to review and steer through its final stages.<ref name=broke />\n\nThe parliament of April 1554 had a much stronger commission to further the Marian [[Counter-Reformation]]: \"for corroboration of true religion, and touching the Queen's highness most noble marriage\" to Philip II of Spain. Broke attended with Bowes, Blundell and Marshe. At the assembly of the parliament Broke was elected speaker, probably with royal support. The parliament was dissolved after only a month. The Speaker's main task was to steer through a bill, dear to many members, to protect those who had profited from the [[Dissolution of the monasteries]] from ecclesiastical censure. This he did competently, although the bill was defeated in the [[House of Lords]]. The main measures proposed by the Crown, most importantly those relating to the Queen's marriage, were carried expeditiously. Broke's conduct as Speaker seems to have been the main factor influencing the Queen to open up opportunities within the [[judiciary]]. He was appointed Chief Justice of Common Pleas after the summoning of the next parliament but before it assembled. This forced him to resign the recordership, and thus his Commons seat.\n\n==Landowner==\n[[File:Madeley Court - geograph.org.uk - 173588.jpg|thumb|Madeley Court, the manor house built on the Madeley estate by Broke's descendants.

Broke bought the estate to settle on his second wife, Dorothy Gatacre.]]\nBroke's family had been decidedly minor landowners in and around Claverley. However, his career gave him the contacts and wealth to expand his holdings greatly. He was able to purchase land and rights expropriated through the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in the reign of Henry VIII and the abolition of [[chantry|chantries]] and [[College (canon law)|colleges]] in the reiign of Edward VI.\n\nMost important for Broke's family was the acquisition of the [[manor]] of [[Madeley, Shropshire]], which had been the closest [[demesne]] estate of [[Wenlock Priory]]. After passing back to the Crown in 1540 on the dissolution of the priory, it was purchased by Broke in 1544 and held as half a [[knight's fee]].<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18068#s1 Victoria County History: Shropshire, volume 11: Telford, chapter 13: Madeley \u2013 Manor and other estates, s.1]</ref> For two centuries [[Madeley Court|Madeley]] was to be the seat of the Brooke family, famous or notorious for their royalist plotting during the [[English civil war|Civil War]] and [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]].

Manners acquired it at the abolition of colleges and chantries and was now in a position to sell this former church property for ready cash. Broke settled Lapley on his second wife, Dorothy Gatacre, at their marriage and she obtained it on his death.<ref name=broke />\n\nBroke's family resided generally in Shropshire. He visited Shropshire periodically to meet family and friends, but most of the time lived in one of his London houses, at Carter Lane or in [[Putney]].\n\n==Religious beliefs==\nOpinions on Broke's religious beliefs differ only in degree. The History of Parliament says: \"There seems no doubt that Broke was a Catholic.\"<ref name=broke /> The 1904 [[Dictionary of National Biography]] volume quotes, without attribution, the description \"zealous Catholic,\"<ref name=dnb /> while The Victoria County history on his main manor echoes with the more disparaging \"zealous papist.\"<ref name=madeley /> In 1548, it was reported that Broke and Clement Smith, MP for [[Maldon (UK Parliament constituency)|Maldon]], smiled and laughed \"when they heard the priest at St. Gregory's by Paul's at his prayers at mass pray God to send the Council grace to turn from their erroneous opinions that they were in\", although the allegation was later withdrawn.<ref name=broke />\n\nBroke's religious conservatism was a persistent theme of his life. He had served as commissioner for heresies for London in 1541, when Henry VIII's final persecution of Protestants was launched. The commission to [[Edmund Bonner]], the [[Bishop of London]] is faithfully preserved in [[Foxe's Book of Martyrs]], with a list of the names of those whose oaths were to be taken, including notably Broke himself, Cholmley and Gresham.<ref>[http://www.johnfoxe.org/index.php?realm=text&gototype=modern&edition=1583&pageid=1226 John Foxe's The Acts and Monuments Online, 1583 edition, p.1226]</ref> However, in common with the Shropshire and Staffordshire gentry circle in which he moved, Broke showed no great sympathy for the power and wealth of the clergy. He worked to limit the power of the London clergy and later readily accepted lands expropriated from monasteries and chantries, using his power as Speaker to attempt to secure the purchases.\n\nBroke's attitude was generally strictly professional: he was willing to use his legal skills on behalf of employers or clients, irrespective of their religious inclinations or intentions, so it is never entirely safe to read his beliefs from his actions. Hence he worked on both the passage and the repeal of the 1551 Treason Act, which specifically forbade religious criticism of Edward VI. It was never likely that he would appear on the October 1553 Crown Office list of MPs as one of \"those which stood for the true religion,\" in this case, Protestant. Only 60 names are marked, although they include two colleagues, Blundell and Marshe.<ref>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/survey/appendix-xi-they-which-stood-true-religion-october-1553 S.T.

However, his tomb inscription says that he died on 6 September, while \"visiting his friends and country\". The discrepancy is small and it is possible he died in the night, with the precise moment unknown. He was buried in [[All Saints Church, Claverley|Claverley Church]].

Although a landowner in rural [[Shropshire]], he made his fortune through more than 20 years' service to the [[City of London]]. MP for the City in five parliaments, he served as [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]] in 1554. He is celebrated as the author of one of the [[Books of authority]]. A prominent religious conservative, he founded a notable [[recusant]] dynasty. His surname is also rendered '''Brooke''', and occasionally '''Brook''', which are, for modern readers, better indicators of pronunciation.\n\n==Early life and education==\nRobert Broke was born by 1515:<ref name=broke>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/broke-robert-1515-58 The History of Parliament: Members 1509\u20131558 \u2013 BROKE, Robert (Author: Helen Miller)]</ref> his known Oxford admission date suggests the first decade of the century. He was the eldest son of\n:*'''Thomas Broke''' of [[Claverley]] in Shropshire.\n:*'''Margaret Grosvenor''', daughter of Humphrey Grosvenor of Farmcote, a hamlet to the south-east of Claverley.\nMost of early 16th century Shropshire was poor and underdeveloped sheep country, ruled by the [[Council of Wales and the Marches]]. Claverley was a large parish, dominated by the Gatacre family, whose seat was at its southern edge.\n\nBroke was admitted to study for a BA at Oxford university in 1521.<ref name=dnb>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Broke, Robert|volume=6}}</ref> As a very minor member of the [[landed gentry]], Broke needed to seek sources of income outside his own locality if he were to prosper, and he did so through London and the law. He studied at [[Strand Inn]], and from there was admitted to [[Middle Temple]] at some point between 1525 and 1528. He studied [[pleading]] with [[John Jenour]], a famous [[Prothonotary]] who influenced a whole generation of judges and [[jurist]]s.\n\n==Judicial career==\nBroke enjoyed considerable power as an official of the City of London before attaining high office in the last four years of his life. He was also the author of several important works on the law.\n\n===Offices held===\nBroke's judicial career began in 1536 when he was appointed [[Common Serjeant of London]] on the recommendation of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and the queen, [[Jane Seymour]]; how he gained such royal favour is unknown.<ref name=broke /> As Serjeant, Brooke attended court with the [[Lord Mayor of London]], as well as the [[Court of Aldermen]] and the [[Court of Common Council]], the City's main deliberative body. One of his tasks was to review, rewrite and put forward parliamentary [[Bill (law)|bill]]s proposed by the City. In 1540, Broke identified and returned a volume of the [[Letter-Books of the City of London]] that had been lost for some time. In January 1544 he was directed to intervene in the passage of two bills: one from the secondaries of the [[compter]], aiming to repeal the Act against untrue verdicts; another already put to the house that intended to prevent merchants buying steel and other goods, which Broke was told to forestall. In 1545 it was a bill to bring urban [[Sanctuary|sanctuaries]] under the control of borough and city authorities.\n\nAmong the legal officers, the Common Serjeant was second only to the [[Recorder of London]]. When this post became vacant in 1545, a letter from the king to the Aldermen once again proved decisive in securing it for Broke, and he took office on 12 November. On 17 November he was elected to parliament in place of his predecessor as Recorder, [[Roger Cholmley|Sir Roger Cholmley]]. On 19 November he was granted [[Freedom of the City of London]], a status tied to his membership of the [[Worshipful Company of Mercers]], the first in [[order of precedence]] of London's [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]].\n\nHolding these public offices did not prevent Broke pursuing private practice, and his signature is found on bills in chancery in the 1530s and 1540s. During this time he was also deputy chief steward for the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], and was created a [[Serjeant-at-law]] in 1552.\n\nOn 8 October 1554 he was appointed [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas]], probably a reward from [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]] for his performance as [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]]. He was knighted on 27 January 1555 by [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip]]. On 26 February, he presided over the trial of [[Charles Stourton, 8th Baron Stourton]],<ref name=dnb /> accused of murdering two men, William Hartgill and his son John. Stourton refused to plead and Broke threatened him with the punishment of being pressed to death. He then entered a plea of guilty and was executed on 16 March.\n\nBroke fell into conflict with the court's [[Puisne Justices]] when he appointed [[Thomas Gatacre]], his wife's brother, as Chief Prothonotary in 1557. The justices rejected him, and Broke's second choice, William Wheteley, was then allowed to take office despite judicial preference for another candidate.\n\n===Works===\nIn 1542 Broke became a [[bencher]] at the Middle Temple. As [[Reader (Inns of Court)|Autumn Reader]] that year, his subject was the 1540 Statute of Limitations; the reading circulated in manuscript and was subsequently printed in 1547. As Lent Reader in 1551, his subject was Pleas of the Crown, using chapter 18 of [[Magna Carta]] as the source: this also circulated in manuscript before being published in 1641, almost one hundred years after his death.<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3497 Oxford DNB: Broke, Sir Robert]</ref>\n\nBroke's most important work was ''La Graunde Abridgement'', a classified compendium of law as it then prevailed. Modelled on a work of the same name by [[Anthony Fitzherbert]], with which it is sometimes confused, it closely reflected Broke's own interests and experience.<ref name=broke /> A section is given over to the subject of London, great stress is placed on the role of parliament and it contains numerous cases in which Broke appeared. The book was not published until 1568, a decade after Broke's death, and was in [[Law French]], but it was an immediate success and came to be regarded as one of the [[Books of authority]] which courts can use as evidence of the law prevailing at the time. From it [[Richard Bellewe]] extracted important cases decided during the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI and Mary I and issued them as a separate compilation, soon rendered into English, and often cited as [[Brook's New Cases]]. This proved even more popular than the book from which it was extracted.\n\n==Political career==\nBroke served as a [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] for the [[City of London (elections to the Parliament of England)|City of London]] from 1545 until 1554, serving as [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]] of England in 1554.\n\n===Parliament of 1545===\nBroke was elected to the Parliament of 1545, the last of Henry VIII's reign, as a replacement for Sir Roger Cholmley. The parliament had been called as long ago as December 1544 and Cholmley was elected to Parliament on 19 January 1545. However, the opening of parliament was delayed until 23 November and Cholmley was appointed an [[Exchequer of Pleas#Barons|Exchequer Baron]] in the mean time, and so forced to relinquish both his post as Recorder and his parliamentary seat.<ref>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/cholmley-sir-roger-1495-1565 S.T.

His aldermanic colleague was the goldsmith [[Martin Bowes|Sir Martin Bowes]],<ref name=london /> who had just served his term as Lord Mayor, having made so large a fortune at the [[Royal Mint]] that he was able easily to afford the \u00a310,000 to settle accounts when he and the other masters were found to have systematically debased the coinage.<ref>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/bowes-sir-martin-149697-1566 S.T.

The first session of the parliament definitively abolished [[chantry|chantries]]. A major concern of the London members in the second and subsequent sessions of the parliament was to ensure that the City did not lose control of the wealth of the chantries within its boundaries to the king.<ref name=london /> Broke, who had been appointed commissioner for chantries in London, Westminster and Middlesex in 1546, during an earlier and abortive move toward abolition, must have had first-hand knowledge of the subject. The London members also wrestled with an Act to release [[Fee farm grant|fee farm]]s for three years to ensure that London got the best terms from it. Broke was told to work closely with one of the burgesses,<ref>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/bacon-thomas-1505-73-or-later S.T. Bindoff (editor): The History of Parliament: Members 1509\u20131558 \u2013 BACON, Thomas (Author: Helen Miller)]</ref> who had specialist knowledge of the subject. The other burgess, Thomas Curteys, was elected an alderman in 1551 \u2013 a move which he resisted to the point of imprisonment and which forced him to resign his seat in parliament.<ref>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/curteys-thomas-1502-59 S.T. Bindoff (editor): The History of Parliament: Members 1509\u20131558 \u2013 CURTEYS, Thomas (Author: Helen Miller)]</ref> In 1552 Broke was sent to lobby for further assurances from the Crown about lands recently purchased by the City.\n\nBroke was not limited to purely metropolitan concerns: as a skilled lawyer and draftsman, his talents were useful to the Crown and its ministers, and he was called upon by others if they thought his skills could benefit their cause. In 1549, he was given responsibility for a bill \"for preaching divers opinions.\" The third session of the parliament passed an Act to reform [[canon law]] and Broke was appointed to the commission set up for this purpose on 12 February 1552. In March 1552 he was one of those deputed to the redraft the [[Treason Act 1551]] to make it illegal to say that the king \"is an heretic, schismatic, infidel or usurper of the crown.\" He was one of those enlisted in 1549 by the supporters of [[Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland]], whose family had long held the [[High Sheriff of Westmorland|shrievalty of Westmorland]] by hereditary right: the supporters of his neighbour [[Thomas Wharton, 1st Baron Wharton]], were proposing to end the arrangement. He was also called in by [[John de Vere, 16th Earl of Oxford]] in 1552 to advise on legislation he was promoting to free himself of commitments made to [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]], the disgraced and executed former [[Lord Protector]].\n\n===Parliament of March 1553===\nBroke and Bowes were sent to the last parliament of Edward VI's reign, along with two burgesses: Curteys's replacement, John Blundell, and John Marshe \u2013 both Protestants and particularly long-serving MPs. The parliament met as the succession question loomed large and lasted for only the month of March 1553. However, the London delegation were initially more concerned with their campaign to get the use of fuel in London better regulated \u2013 in which they succeeded through the passage of an Act.\n\nHowever, Broke was soon given the question of the [[Maidstone (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidstone]] election to investigate, and this was perhaps a result of the succession crisis.<ref name=broke /> The town had been granted a [[charter]] of [[Municipal corporation|incorporation]] in 1549.<ref>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/constituencies/maidstone S.T.

Fuidge)]</ref> An election was called as soon as the parliament was summoned, but there was no reference to parliamentary representation in the charter. Broke was joined in his work by [[Richard Morgan (Tudor judge)|Richard Morgan]], a fellow judge and MP for [[Gloucester (UK Parliament constituency)|Gloucester]], as well as a fellow Catholic.<ref>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/morgan-richard-1510-56 S.T. Bindoff (editor): The History of Parliament: Members 1509\u20131558 \u2013 MORGAN, Richard (Author: P.S. Edwards)]</ref> They were enjoined by parliament to \"peruse the charter of Maidstone ... whether they may have burgesses in this House; and in the meantime the burgesses there to be absent out of this House till it be fully ordered.\" It was possible that supporters of [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland]] had used Maidstone's ambiguous status as a way of increasing parliamentary support for [[Lady Jane Grey]]'s succession, as the town was in the Protestant heartland of Kent. In fact, the [[lord of the manor]] was [[Thomas Wyatt the Younger|Thomas Wyatt]], the [[High Sheriff of Kent]] who made the return was [[John Guildford|Sir John Guildford]], a cousin of Dudley's wife, and one of the burgesses elected was a relative of both Dudley and Jane Grey. It is unclear what Broke and Morgan reported, or even if they delivered their report, but Maidstone was [[Disfranchisement|disfranchised]] and did not regain the right to parliamentary representation until it was granted by a new charter 1559.\n\n===Parliaments of Mary I===\nFor the parliament of October 1553 Bowes was temporarily replaced by [[Rowland Hill (MP)|Sir Rowland Hill]], a former Lord Mayor and a Protestant, making Broke the only Catholic MP from London. Despite this, and the momentous events of the summer, in which Dudley attempted to place Jane Grey on the throne and was defeated by a rebellion in favour of Mary, Edward's Catholic elder sister, the London delegation attended the parliament with an entirely commercial agenda. They toiled away at legislation to regulate London's physicians, [[Chandlery|chandlers]] in both wax and tallow, [[Tanning (leather)|leather tanners]] and [[Bowling|bowling alleys]], as well as a measure to deregulate the sale of wine.<ref name=london /> However, the Crown took initial steps to undo the [[English Reformation#Edward's Reformation|Edwardian Reformation]]. One of the key measures protecting it was the Treason Act, which Broke had helped to redraft. After a bill to repeal it had passed its [[second reading]], it was given to Broke to review and steer through its final stages.<ref name=broke />\n\nThe parliament of April 1554 had a much stronger commission to further the Marian [[Counter-Reformation]]: \"for corroboration of true religion, and touching the Queen's highness most noble marriage\" to Philip II of Spain. Broke attended with Bowes, Blundell and Marshe. At the assembly of the parliament Broke was elected speaker, probably with royal support. The parliament was dissolved after only a month. The Speaker's main task was to steer through a bill, dear to many members, to protect those who had profited from the [[Dissolution of the monasteries]] from ecclesiastical censure. This he did competently, although the bill was defeated in the [[House of Lords]]. The main measures proposed by the Crown, most importantly those relating to the Queen's marriage, were carried expeditiously. Broke's conduct as Speaker seems to have been the main factor influencing the Queen to open up opportunities within the [[judiciary]]. He was appointed Chief Justice of Common Pleas after the summoning of the next parliament but before it assembled. This forced him to resign the recordership, and thus his Commons seat.\n\n==Landowner==\n[[File:Madeley Court - geograph.org.uk - 173588.jpg|thumb|Madeley Court, the manor house built on the Madeley estate by Broke's descendants.

Broke bought the estate to settle on his second wife, Dorothy Gatacre.]]\nBroke's family had been decidedly minor landowners in and around Claverley. However, his career gave him the contacts and wealth to expand his holdings greatly. He was able to purchase land and rights expropriated through the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in the reign of Henry VIII and the abolition of [[chantry|chantries]] and [[College (canon law)|colleges]] in the reiign of Edward VI.\n\nMost important for Broke's family was the acquisition of the [[manor]] of [[Madeley, Shropshire]], which had been the closest [[demesne]] estate of [[Wenlock Priory]]. After passing back to the Crown in 1540 on the dissolution of the priory, it was purchased by Broke in 1544 and held as half a [[knight's fee]].<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=18068#s1 Victoria County History: Shropshire, volume 11: Telford, chapter 13: Madeley \u2013 Manor and other estates, s.1]</ref> For two centuries [[Madeley Court|Madeley]] was to be the seat of the Brooke family, famous or notorious for their royalist plotting during the [[English civil war|Civil War]] and [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]].

Manners acquired it at the abolition of colleges and chantries and was now in a position to sell this former church property for ready cash. Broke settled Lapley on his second wife, Dorothy Gatacre, at their marriage and she obtained it on his death.<ref name=broke />\n\nBroke's family resided generally in Shropshire. He visited Shropshire periodically to meet family and friends, but most of the time lived in one of his London houses, at Carter Lane or in [[Putney]].\n\n==Religious beliefs==\nOpinions on Broke's religious beliefs differ only in degree. The History of Parliament says: \"There seems no doubt that Broke was a Catholic.\"<ref name=broke /> The 1904 [[Dictionary of National Biography]] volume quotes, without attribution, the description \"zealous Catholic,\"<ref name=dnb /> while The Victoria County history on his main manor echoes with the more disparaging \"zealous papist.\"<ref name=madeley /> In 1548, it was reported that Broke and Clement Smith, MP for [[Maldon (UK Parliament constituency)|Maldon]], smiled and laughed \"when they heard the priest at St. Gregory's by Paul's at his prayers at mass pray God to send the Council grace to turn from their erroneous opinions that they were in\", although the allegation was later withdrawn.<ref name=broke />\n\nBroke's religious conservatism was a persistent theme of his life. He had served as commissioner for heresies for London in 1541, when Henry VIII's final persecution of Protestants was launched. The commission to [[Edmund Bonner]], the [[Bishop of London]] is faithfully preserved in [[Foxe's Book of Martyrs]], with a list of the names of those whose oaths were to be taken, including notably Broke himself, Cholmley and Gresham.<ref>[http://www.johnfoxe.org/index.php?realm=text&gototype=modern&edition=1583&pageid=1226 John Foxe's The Acts and Monuments Online, 1583 edition, p.1226]</ref> However, in common with the Shropshire and Staffordshire gentry circle in which he moved, Broke showed no great sympathy for the power and wealth of the clergy. He worked to limit the power of the London clergy and later readily accepted lands expropriated from monasteries and chantries, using his power as Speaker to attempt to secure the purchases.\n\nBroke's attitude was generally strictly professional: he was willing to use his legal skills on behalf of employers or clients, irrespective of their religious inclinations or intentions, so it is never entirely safe to read his beliefs from his actions. Hence he worked on both the passage and the repeal of the 1551 Treason Act, which specifically forbade religious criticism of Edward VI. It was never likely that he would appear on the October 1553 Crown Office list of MPs as one of \"those which stood for the true religion,\" in this case, Protestant. Only 60 names are marked, although they include two colleagues, Blundell and Marshe.<ref>[http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/survey/appendix-xi-they-which-stood-true-religion-october-1553 S.T.

However, his tomb inscription says that he died on 6 September, while \"visiting his friends and country\". The discrepancy is small and it is possible he died in the night, with the precise moment unknown. He was buried in [[All Saints Church, Claverley|Claverley Church]].

The current lighthouse stands at the north end of [[Anastasia Island]] and was built between 1871 and 1874. The tower is the second lighthouse tower in St. Augustine, the first being lit officially by the American territorial government in May 1824 as Florida's first lighthouse. However, both the Spanish and the British governments<ref>http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/LAMP/Historical_Research/Turner%20El%20Escribano.pdf</ref> operated a major aid to navigation here including a series of wooden watch towers and beacons dating from 1565.<ref>http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/ourstories/LighthouseStory</ref>\n\nThe current lighthouse  tower, original first-order Fresnel Lens and the Light Station grounds are owned by the '''St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum, Inc.''', a not-for-profit maritime museum. The museum is open to the public 360 days a year. Admission fees support continued preservation of the lighthouse and five other historic structures. Admissions and museum memberships also fund programs in [[maritime archaeology]], traditional wooden boatbuilding, and maritime education. The non profit mission is to \"discover, preserve, present and keep alive the stories of the nation's oldest port<ref>http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/nha/Significance</ref> as symbolized by our working St. Augustine Lighthouse.\"\n\n==History==\n[[File:Staugustine1824.JPG|thumb|left|The St. Augustine lighthouse in 1824]]\n[[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] was the site of the first lighthouse established in Florida by the new, territorial, American Government in 1824. According to some archival records and maps, this \"official\" American lighthouse was placed on the site of an earlier watchtower built by the Spanish as early as the late 16th century.<ref>{{cite uscghist|FL|accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref> A map of St. Augustine made by [[Baptista Boazio]] in 1589, depicting Sir [[Francis Drake]]'s attack on the city, shows an early wooden watch tower near the Spanish structure, which was described as a \"beacon\" in Drake's account. By 1737, Spanish authorities built a more permanent tower from [[coquina]] taken from a nearby quarry on the island.  Archival records are inconclusive as to whether the Spanish used the coquina tower as a lighthouse, but it seems plausible, given the levels of maritime trade by that time. The structure was regularly referred to as a \"lighthouse\" in documents\u2014including ship's logs and nautical charts\u2014dating to the British Period beginning in 1763.\n\nIn 1783, the Spanish once again took control of St. Augustine, and once again the lighthouse was improved. Swiss-Canadian engineer and marine surveyor [[Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres]] marks a coquina \"Light House\" on [[Anastasia Island]] in his 1780 engraving, \"A Plan of the Harbour of St. Augustin\". [[Jacques-Nicolas Bellin]], Royal French Hydrographer, refers to the coquina tower as a \"Batise\" in Volume I of ''Petit Atlas Maritime''.  The accuracy of these scholars is debated still; DesBarres work includes some obvious errors, but Belline is considered highly qualified.  His work provides an important reference to St. Augustine's geography and landmarks in 1764.  Facing erosion and a changing coastline, the old tower crashed into the sea in 1880, but not before a new lighthouse was lit. Today, the tower ruins are a submerged archaeological site.\n\nEarly lamps in the first tower burned [[lard oil]]. Multiple lamps with silver reflectors were replaced by a fourth order [[Fresnel lens]] in 1855, greatly improving the lighthouse's range and eliminating some maintenance issues.\n\nAt the beginning of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], future mayor Paul Arnau, a local [[Menorca]]n harbor master, along with the lightkeeper, a woman named [[Maria Andreu|Maria Mestre de los Dolores Andreu]] (who, in this role, became the first Hispanic-American woman to serve in the Coast Guard),<ref name=\"Frank2013\">{{cite book|author=Lisa Tendrich Frank|title=An Encyclopedia of American Women at War: From the Home Front to the Battlefields|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drE50WEN1WUC&pg=PA685|year=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-443-6|page=685}}</ref> removed the lens from the old lighthouse and hid it, in order to block Union shipping lanes. The lens and clock works were recovered after Arnau was held captive on a ship off-shore and forced to reveal their location.\n\nBy 1870, [[erosion#Shoreline|beach erosion]] was threatening the first lighthouse. Construction on a new light tower began in 1871 during Florida's reconstruction period. In the meantime, a [[jetty]] of coquina and brush was built to protect the old tower.  A trolley track brought building supplies from the ships at the dock. The new tower was completed in 1874, and put into service with a new first order Fresnel lens. It was lit for the first time in October by keeper William Russell. Russell was the first lighthouse keeper in the new tower, and the only keeper to have worked both towers.\n\nFor 20 years, the site was manned by head-keeper [[William A. Harn]] of Philadelphia.  Major Harn was a Union war hero who had commanded his own battery at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].  With his wife, Kate Skillen Harn, of [[Maine]], he had six daughters. The family was known for serving lemonade out on the  porches of the keepers' house, which was constructed as a Victorian duplex during Harn's tenure.\n\nOn August 31, 1886, the [[Charleston earthquake]] caused the tower to \"sway violently\", according to the keeper's log, but there was no recorded damage.\n\nIn 1885, after many experiments with different types of oils, the lamp was converted from lard oil to [[kerosene]].\n\nDuring World War II, Coast Guard men and women trained in St. Augustine, and used the lighthouse as a lookout post for enemy ships and submarines which frequented the coastline.\n\nIn 1907, indoor plumbing reached the light station, followed by electricity in the keeper's quarters in 1925. The light itself was electrified in 1936, and automated in 1955. As the light was automated, positions for three keepers slowly dwindled down to two and then one.  No longer housing lighthouse families by the 1960s, the keepers' house was rented to local residents. Eventually it was declared surplus, and [[St. Johns County, Florida|St. Johns County]] bought it in 1970.  In that year the house suffered a devastating fire at the hands of an unknown arsonist.\n\n==Restoration==\nIn 1980, a small group of 15 women in the Junior Service League of St. Augustine (JSL) signed a 99-year lease with the county for the keeper's house and surrounding grounds and began a massive restoration project. Shortly after the JSL adopted the restoration, the League signed a 30-year lease with the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] to begin a restoration effort on the lighthouse tower itself. The lighthouse was subsequently placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1981 due to the efforts of local preservationist and author Karen Harvey.  \n\nThe antique lens was functional until it was damaged by rifle fire in 1986, and 19 of the prisms were broken. Lamplighter Hank Mears called the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to investigate this crime. As the lens continued to weaken, the Coast Guard considered removing it and replacing it with a more modern, airport beacon.  Again championed by the JSL, this plan was dismissed and the {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall lens was restored, with the help of retired Coast Guardsmen Joe Cocking and Nick Johnston. This was the first restoration of its kind in the nation. Cocking and Johnston continue to work with Museum staff and care for the lens. Volunteers from [[Northrop Grumman]] Corporation and [[Florida Power & Light]] clean and inspect the lens and works every week.\n\nToday, the St. Augustine Light Station consists of the {{convert|165|ft|adj=on}} 1874 tower, the 1876 Keepers' House, two summer kitchens added in 1886, a 1941 U.S. Coast Guard barracks and a 1936 garage that was home to a jeep repair facility during World War II. The site is also a [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] weather station.\n\n==St. Augustine Lighthouse and Maritime Museum==\n[[File:St Augustine lighthouse visitor center sign.jpg|thumb|right|Visitors' Center]]\n[[File:St. Augustine Lighthouse 3.JPG|thumb|right|View of the Keeper's House from the tower]]\n\nIn 1994, the Lighthouse Museum of St. Augustine opened full-time to the public.  A community-based board of trustees was created in 1998. The men and women of the volunteer board are charged with holding the site in trust for future generations.  In 2002, under the direction of current Executive Director Kathy Fleming, ownership of the tower and historic Fresnel lens was transferred from the U.S. Coast Guard through the [[General Services Administration]] and the [[National Park Service]] to the St. Augustine Lighthouse and Museum, Inc.  This was the first such transfer of a U.S. lighthouse to a non-profit organization. The Museum keeps the light burning as a private aid-to-navigation. In 2016 the museum changed its name to the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum.\n\nThe St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum aims to preserve local maritime history, keep alive the story of the nation's oldest port, and connect young people to [[marine science]]s.  The museum board and staff also work to help save other lighthouses in Florida and across the nation, coordinating efforts with several federal agencies and volunteer groups such as the Florida Lighthouse Association.  The Lighthouse employs close to 50 individuals, and is visited annually by over 200,000 people including 54,000 school-aged children.\n\nThe museum maintains an active [[archaeology|archaeological]] program (Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program, or LAMP) that researches maritime archaeological sites around St. Augustine and the [[First Coast]] region.  Staff archaeologists have discovered a number of historic shipwrecks and investigated many others, along with other maritime sites such as breakwaters, plantation wharf remains, and the nearby remains of St. Augustine's original lighthouse.  The museum also researches other aspects of maritime heritage including boat building and the history of the local and regional shrimping industry, and maintains a growing collection of [[World War II]] artifacts focusing on the history of the U.S. Coast Guard in St. Augustine.  The Keeper's house is used to display a series of exhibits related to these various aspects of St. Augustine's maritime history. The Lighthouse also hosts a volunteer-driven heritage boat building program, which has built a number of traditional wooden boats from various time periods in the port's history.\n\nIn early 2010, the First Light Maritime Society was established as the support organization for the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Museum and LAMP. The use of this fundraising organization was discontinued by the Lighthouse & Maritime Museum with its re-branding in 2016.\n\n===Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program (LAMP)===\nThe St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum, as part of its ongoing mission to discover, present, and keep alive the maritime history of America's oldest port, has funded [[maritime archaeology]] in St. Johns County waters since 1997.  In 1999, the Lighthouse formalized its research program, creating the Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program, Inc. (LAMP).  LAMP is one of the few research organizations in the nation employing full-time professional marine archaeologists and conservators that is not a part of a university or government entity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lampmaritime.com/LAMP/About_LAMP/LAMP_about |title=About LAMP |publisher=Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nLAMP's founding Director was William \"Billy Ray\" Morris, who oversaw archaeological research and educational programs until his departure in 2005.

The identities of both wrecks remain unknown, but the study of their remains has led to a greater understanding of the economic and technological evolution of St. Augustine at the dawn of modernity.

The current lighthouse stands at the north end of [[Anastasia Island]] and was built between 1871 and 1874. The tower is the second lighthouse tower in St. Augustine, the first being lit officially by the American territorial government in May 1824 as Florida's first lighthouse. However, both the Spanish and the British governments<ref>http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/LAMP/Historical_Research/Turner%20El%20Escribano.pdf</ref> operated a major aid to navigation here including a series of wooden watch towers and beacons dating from 1565.<ref>http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/ourstories/LighthouseStory</ref>\n\nThe current lighthouse  tower, original first-order Fresnel Lens and the Light Station grounds are owned by the '''St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum, Inc.''', a not-for-profit maritime museum. The museum is open to the public 360 days a year. Admission fees support continued preservation of the lighthouse and five other historic structures. Admissions and museum memberships also fund programs in [[maritime archaeology]], traditional wooden boatbuilding, and maritime education. The non profit mission is to \"discover, preserve, present and keep alive the stories of the nation's oldest port<ref>http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/nha/Significance</ref> as symbolized by our working St. Augustine Lighthouse.\"\n\n==History==\n[[File:Staugustine1824.JPG|thumb|left|The St. Augustine lighthouse in 1824]]\n[[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] was the site of the first lighthouse established in Florida by the new, territorial, American Government in 1824. According to some archival records and maps, this \"official\" American lighthouse was placed on the site of an earlier watchtower built by the Spanish as early as the late 16th century.<ref>{{cite uscghist|FL|accessdate=February 8, 2006}}</ref> A map of St. Augustine made by [[Baptista Boazio]] in 1589, depicting Sir [[Francis Drake]]'s attack on the city, shows an early wooden watch tower near the Spanish structure, which was described as a \"beacon\" in Drake's account. By 1737, Spanish authorities built a more permanent tower from [[coquina]] taken from a nearby quarry on the island.  Archival records are inconclusive as to whether the Spanish used the coquina tower as a lighthouse, but it seems plausible, given the levels of maritime trade by that time. The structure was regularly referred to as a \"lighthouse\" in documents\u2014including ship's logs and nautical charts\u2014dating to the British Period beginning in 1763.\n\nIn 1783, the Spanish once again took control of St. Augustine, and once again the lighthouse was improved. Swiss-Canadian engineer and marine surveyor [[Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres]] marks a coquina \"Light House\" on [[Anastasia Island]] in his 1780 engraving, \"A Plan of the Harbour of St. Augustin\". [[Jacques-Nicolas Bellin]], Royal French Hydrographer, refers to the coquina tower as a \"Batise\" in Volume I of ''Petit Atlas Maritime''.  The accuracy of these scholars is debated still; DesBarres work includes some obvious errors, but Belline is considered highly qualified.  His work provides an important reference to St. Augustine's geography and landmarks in 1764.  Facing erosion and a changing coastline, the old tower crashed into the sea in 1880, but not before a new lighthouse was lit. Today, the tower ruins are a submerged archaeological site.\n\nEarly lamps in the first tower burned [[lard oil]]. Multiple lamps with silver reflectors were replaced by a fourth order [[Fresnel lens]] in 1855, greatly improving the lighthouse's range and eliminating some maintenance issues.\n\nAt the beginning of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], future mayor Paul Arnau, a local [[Menorca]]n harbor master, along with the lightkeeper, a woman named [[Maria Andreu|Maria Mestre de los Dolores Andreu]] (who, in this role, became the first Hispanic-American woman to serve in the Coast Guard),<ref name=\"Frank2013\">{{cite book|author=Lisa Tendrich Frank|title=An Encyclopedia of American Women at War: From the Home Front to the Battlefields|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drE50WEN1WUC&pg=PA685|year=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-443-6|page=685}}</ref> removed the lens from the old lighthouse and hid it, in order to block Union shipping lanes. The lens and clock works were recovered after Arnau was held captive on a ship off-shore and forced to reveal their location.\n\nBy 1870, [[erosion#Shoreline|beach erosion]] was threatening the first lighthouse. Construction on a new light tower began in 1871 during Florida's reconstruction period. In the meantime, a [[jetty]] of coquina and brush was built to protect the old tower.  A trolley track brought building supplies from the ships at the dock. The new tower was completed in 1874, and put into service with a new first order Fresnel lens. It was lit for the first time in October by keeper William Russell. Russell was the first lighthouse keeper in the new tower, and the only keeper to have worked both towers.\n\nFor 20 years, the site was manned by head-keeper [[William A. Harn]] of Philadelphia.  Major Harn was a Union war hero who had commanded his own battery at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].  With his wife, Kate Skillen Harn, of [[Maine]], he had six daughters. The family was known for serving lemonade out on the  porches of the keepers' house, which was constructed as a Victorian duplex during Harn's tenure.\n\nOn August 31, 1886, the [[Charleston earthquake]] caused the tower to \"sway violently\", according to the keeper's log, but there was no recorded damage.\n\nIn 1885, after many experiments with different types of oils, the lamp was converted from lard oil to [[kerosene]].\n\nDuring World War II, Coast Guard men and women trained in St. Augustine, and used the lighthouse as a lookout post for enemy ships and submarines which frequented the coastline.\n\nIn 1907, indoor plumbing reached the light station, followed by electricity in the keeper's quarters in 1925. The light itself was electrified in 1936, and automated in 1955. As the light was automated, positions for three keepers slowly dwindled down to two and then one.  No longer housing lighthouse families by the 1960s, the keepers' house was rented to local residents. Eventually it was declared surplus, and [[St. Johns County, Florida|St. Johns County]] bought it in 1970.  In that year the house suffered a devastating fire at the hands of an unknown arsonist.\n\n==Restoration==\nIn 1980, a small group of 15 women in the Junior Service League of St. Augustine (JSL) signed a 99-year lease with the county for the keeper's house and surrounding grounds and began a massive restoration project. Shortly after the JSL adopted the restoration, the League signed a 30-year lease with the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] to begin a restoration effort on the lighthouse tower itself. The lighthouse was subsequently placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1981 due to the efforts of local preservationist and author Karen Harvey.  \n\nThe antique lens was functional until it was damaged by rifle fire in 1986, and 19 of the prisms were broken. Lamplighter Hank Mears called the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to investigate this crime. As the lens continued to weaken, the Coast Guard considered removing it and replacing it with a more modern, airport beacon.  Again championed by the JSL, this plan was dismissed and the {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall lens was restored, with the help of retired Coast Guardsmen Joe Cocking and Nick Johnston. This was the first restoration of its kind in the nation. Cocking and Johnston continue to work with Museum staff and care for the lens. Volunteers from [[Northrop Grumman]] Corporation and [[Florida Power & Light]] clean and inspect the lens and works every week.\n\nToday, the St. Augustine Light Station consists of the {{convert|165|ft|adj=on}} 1874 tower, the 1876 Keepers' House, two summer kitchens added in 1886, a 1941 U.S. Coast Guard barracks and a 1936 garage that was home to a jeep repair facility during World War II. The site is also a [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] weather station.\n\n==St. Augustine Lighthouse and Maritime Museum==\n[[File:St Augustine lighthouse visitor center sign.jpg|thumb|right|Visitors' Center]]\n[[File:St. Augustine Lighthouse 3.JPG|thumb|right|View of the Keeper's House from the tower]]\n\nIn 1994, the Lighthouse Museum of St. Augustine opened full-time to the public.  A community-based board of trustees was created in 1998. The men and women of the volunteer board are charged with holding the site in trust for future generations.  In 2002, under the direction of current Executive Director Kathy Fleming, ownership of the tower and historic Fresnel lens was transferred from the U.S. Coast Guard through the [[General Services Administration]] and the [[National Park Service]] to the St. Augustine Lighthouse and Museum, Inc.  This was the first such transfer of a U.S. lighthouse to a non-profit organization. The Museum keeps the light burning as a private aid-to-navigation. In 2016 the museum changed its name to the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum.\n\nThe St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum aims to preserve local maritime history, keep alive the story of the nation's oldest port, and connect young people to [[marine science]]s.  The museum board and staff also work to help save other lighthouses in Florida and across the nation, coordinating efforts with several federal agencies and volunteer groups such as the Florida Lighthouse Association.  The Lighthouse employs close to 50 individuals, and is visited annually by over 200,000 people including 54,000 school-aged children.\n\nThe museum maintains an active [[archaeology|archaeological]] program (Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program, or LAMP) that researches maritime archaeological sites around St. Augustine and the [[First Coast]] region.  Staff archaeologists have discovered a number of historic shipwrecks and investigated many others, along with other maritime sites such as breakwaters, plantation wharf remains, and the nearby remains of St. Augustine's original lighthouse.  The museum also researches other aspects of maritime heritage including boat building and the history of the local and regional shrimping industry, and maintains a growing collection of [[World War II]] artifacts focusing on the history of the U.S. Coast Guard in St. Augustine.  The Keeper's house is used to display a series of exhibits related to these various aspects of St. Augustine's maritime history. The Lighthouse also hosts a volunteer-driven heritage boat building program, which has built a number of traditional wooden boats from various time periods in the port's history.\n\nIn early 2010, the First Light Maritime Society was established as the support organization for the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Museum and LAMP. The use of this fundraising organization was discontinued by the Lighthouse & Maritime Museum with its re-branding in 2016.\n\n===Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program (LAMP)===\nThe St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum, as part of its ongoing mission to discover, present, and keep alive the maritime history of America's oldest port, has funded [[maritime archaeology]] in St. Johns County waters since 1997.  In 1999, the Lighthouse formalized its research program, creating the Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program, Inc. (LAMP).  LAMP is one of the few research organizations in the nation employing full-time professional marine archaeologists and conservators that is not a part of a university or government entity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lampmaritime.com/LAMP/About_LAMP/LAMP_about |title=About LAMP |publisher=Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nLAMP's founding Director was William \"Billy Ray\" Morris, who oversaw archaeological research and educational programs until his departure in 2005.

LAMP archaeologists, along with volunteer and student divers, have documented and recovered a wide range of well-preserved artifacts, including numerous iron and copper cauldrons, pewter spoons and plates, an iron tea kettle, ceramic and glass fragments, belt and shoe buckles, a brass candlestick, bricks, a flintlock [[Queen Anne pistol]], three [[Brown Bess]] muskets (two of which were loaded, one with [[buck and ball]]), thousands of lead shot, military buttons (including one from a Royal Provincial unit and one from the [[71st Regiment of Foot, Fraser's Highlanders]]), a cask of nails, tools and navigational equipment (including a sight from an [[octant (instrument)|octant]]), ship's hardware and rigging elements, the ship's lead deck pump, a bronze [[ship's bell]], a 4-pounder [[cannon]], and a 9-pounder [[carronade]], believed to be the second oldest in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/LAMP/Research/storm-wreck |title=Excavation of the Storm Wreck |publisher=Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Meide |first=Chuck |url=http://www.blogstaugustinelighthouse.org/blog/lamposts/lamp_archaeologists_raise_two.php |title=A Tale of Two Cannons |publisher=The Keeper's Blog |date=July 17, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Meide |first=Chuck |url=http://www.blogstaugustinelighthouse.org/blog/lamposts/lamp_divers_discover_four_cann.php |title=LAMP Divers Discover Four Cannon and the Ship's Bell |publisher=The Keeper's Blog |date=February 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Meide |first=Chuck |url=http://www.blogstaugustinelighthouse.org/blog/lamposts/great_press_coverage_for_cauld.php |title=Great Press Coverage for Cauldron Raising |publisher=The Keeper's Blog |date=July 15, 2010}}</ref><ref>A series of six papers on the excavation and analysis of the Storm Wreck are published in: Jordan, Brian; Nowak, Troy J.

This was the final British fleet to leave Charleston, and when it arrived between December 24 and 31, 1782, as many as sixteen vessels were lost on the sandbar in front of the St. Augustine inlet.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/LAMP/Research/Storm%20Wreck/the-loyalist-influx |title=Historical Background: St. Augustine, the American Revolution, and the Loyalist Influx |publisher=Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Meide |first=Chuck |url=http://www.blogstaugustinelighthouse.org/blog/lamposts/all_work_and_some_play_in_joll_1.php |title=All Work (and Some Play) in Jolly Olde England |publisher=The Keeper's Blog |date=February 5, 2013}}</ref> In 2015-2016 LAMP discovered three additional historic shipwrecks, and is currently excavating one of these that appears to date to the second half of the 18th century, the so-called \"Anniversary Wreck.\"\n\nLAMP has also excavated two historically significant 19th century wrecks: a wooden-hulled [[steamship]], and a centerboard [[schooner]].  The identities of both wrecks remain unknown, but the study of their remains has led to a greater understanding of the economic and technological evolution of St. Augustine at the dawn of modernity.  The latter shipwreck carried a cargo of cement in barrels which was probably intended for the city's late 19th century building boom, associated with industrialist entrepreneur [[Henry Flagler]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/LAMP/Research/the-centerboard-schooner-wreck |title=Centerboard Schooner Wreck |publisher=Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref>  In addition to these and other shipwrecks, LAMP has investigated a wide variety of archaeological sites in St. Augustine and the greater Florida [[First Coast]] region representing Florida's French, Spanish, British, and Early American periods.  These include British plantation landings, community boatyard foundations, ferry and steamboat landings, ballast dump sites, colonial wharves, and inundated terrestrial sites. Current work includes the implementation of the First Coast Maritime Archaeology Project, a comprehensive program of research and outreach focusing on the waters around St. Augustine and elsewhere in northeast Florida.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staugustinelighthouse.org/LAMP/Research/first-coast-maritime-archaeology-project |title=First Coast Maritime Archaeological Project |publisher=Lighthouse Archaeological Maritime Program |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref>  This project was partially funded from 2007-2009 and 2014-2019 by historic preservation grants awarded by the state of Florida.\n\n==Ghost stories==\n[[File:StAugustineLighthouse StairsLookingDown.jpg|thumb|right|Looking down the staircase of the lighthouse]]\nThe location is the subject of numerous ghost stories and supernatural legends, and the St. Augustine Lighthouse & Maritime Museum offers tickets for a number of \"Dark of the Moon\" ghost tours and ghost-themed private events to the public.

According to field theory, we account for the [[Coulomb]] (electrostatic) interaction between charged particles through the fact that charges produce around themselves an [[electric field]], which can be felt by other charges as a force. [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] directly addressed the subject of action-at-a-distance in chapter 23 of his ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'' in 1873.<ref>[[James Clerk Maxwell|Clerk Maxwell]] (1873) [https://archive.org/details/atreatiseonelec00maxwgoog A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism], pages 426\u2013438, link from [[Internet Archive]]</ref> He began by reviewing the explanation of [[Amp\u00e8re's force law|Amp\u00e8re's formula]] given by [[Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Weber]]. On page 437 he indicates the physicists' disgust with action at a distance. In 1845 Gauss wrote to Weber desiring \"action, not instantaneous, but propagated in time in a similar manner to that of light\". This aspiration was developed by Maxwell with the theory of an [[electromagnetic field]] described by [[Maxwell's equations]], which used the field to elegantly account for all electromagnetic interactions, as well as light (which, until then, had been seen as a completely unrelated phenomenon). In Maxwell's theory, the field is its own physical entity, carrying momenta and energy across space, and action-at-a-distance is only the apparent effect of local interactions of charges with their surrounding field.\n\nElectrodynamics was later described without fields (in [[Minkowski space]])  as the direct interaction of particles with [[Lightlike#Causal structure|lightlike]] separation vectors.{{Dubious|date=August 2015}} This resulted in the Fokker-Tetrode-Schwarzschild action integral. This kind of electrodynamic theory is often called \"direct interaction\" to distinguish it from field theories where action at a distance is mediated by a localized field (localized in the sense that its dynamics are determined by the nearby field parameters).<ref>Barut, A. O. \"Electrodynamics and Classical Theory of Fields and Particles\"</ref> This description of electrodynamics, in contrast with Maxwell's theory, explains apparent action at a distance not by postulating a mediating entity (the field) but by appealing to the natural geometry of special relativity.\n\nDirect interaction electrodynamics is explicitly symmetrical in time and avoids the infinite energy predicted in the field immediately surrounding point particles.  Feynman and Wheeler have shown that it can account for radiation and [[radiative damping]] (which had been considered strong evidence for the independent existence of the field). However, various proofs, beginning with that of [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]], have shown that direct interaction theories (under reasonable assumptions) do not admit [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] or [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formulations (these are the so-called [[No Interaction Theorems]]). Also significant is the measurement and theoretical description of the [[Lamb shift]]  which strongly suggests that charged particles interact with their own field.  Fields, because of these and other difficulties, have been elevated to the fundamental operators in [[Quantum Field Theory]] and [[Modern physics]] has thus largely abandoned direct interaction theory.\n\n==Gravity==\n{{Main article|Speed of gravity}}\n\n===Newton===\n[[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s classical theory of gravity offered no prospect of identifying any mediator of gravitational interaction. His theory assumed that gravitation acts instantaneously, regardless of distance. <!--Newton had shown mathematically that if the gravitational interaction is not instantaneous, [[angular momentum]] is not conserved,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} and--> [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s observations gave strong evidence that in planetary motion angular momentum is conserved. (The mathematical proof is valid only in the case of a [[Euclidean geometry]].) Gravity is also known as a force of attraction between two objects because of their mass.\n\nFrom a Newtonian perspective, action at a distance can be regarded as \"a phenomenon in which a change in intrinsic properties of one system induces a change in the intrinsic properties of a distant system, independently of the influence of any other systems on the distant system, and without there being a process that carries this influence contiguously in space and time\" (Berkovitz 2008).<ref name=\"sep-qm-action-distance\"/>\n\nA related question, raised by [[Ernst Mach]], was how rotating bodies know how much to bulge at the equator. This, it seems, requires an action-at-a-distance from distant matter, informing the rotating object about the state of the universe. Einstein coined the term [[Mach's principle]] for this question.\n\n{{quote|It is inconceivable that inanimate Matter should, without the Mediation of something else, which is not material, operate upon, and affect other matter without mutual Contact\u2026That Gravity should be innate, inherent and essential to Matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance thro' a Vacuum, without the Mediation of any thing else, by and through which their Action and Force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an Absurdity that I believe no Man who has in philosophical Matters a competent Faculty of thinking can ever fall into it.

But, in his speculative moments, Newton oscillated between accepting and rejecting direct remote action. Newton, according to Kochiras, claims that [[God]] is a virtual omnipresent, the force/agent must subsist in substance, and God is omnipresent substantially, resulting in a hidden premise, the principle of local action.\n\nEric Schliesser, in ''Newton\u2019s substance monism, distant action, and the nature of Newton\u2019s Empiricism''<ref>Eric Schliesser (2011) [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shpsa.2010.11.004 Newton\u2019s Substance Monism, Distant Action, and the Nature of Newton\u2019s Empiricism: Discussion of H. Kochiras \u2018Gravity and Newton\u2019s Substance Counting Problem], Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A 42 (1): 160\u201366</ref>, argued that Newton does not categorically refuse the idea that matter is active, and therefore accepted the possibility of a direct action at a distance.

''Journal of the History of Philosophy'' vol. 52.4 (2014): 675\u2013702.\n\n===Einstein===\nAccording to [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[special relativity]], ''instantaneous action at a distance'' violates the relativistic [[Speed of light#Upper limit on speeds|upper limit on speed]] of propagation of information. If one of the interacting objects were to suddenly be displaced from its position, the other object would feel its influence instantaneously, meaning information had been transmitted faster than the [[speed of light]].\n\nOne of the conditions that a relativistic theory of gravitation must meet is that gravity is mediated with a speed that does not exceed {{math|'''''c'''''}}, the speed of light in a vacuum. From the previous success of electrodynamics, it was foreseeable that the relativistic theory of gravitation would have to use the concept of a [[Field (physics)|field]], or something similar.\n\nThis has been achieved by Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]], in which gravitational interaction is mediated by deformation of space-time geometry. Matter warps the geometry of space-time, and these effects are\u2014as with electric and magnetic fields\u2014propagated at the speed of light. Thus, in the presence of matter, space-time becomes [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]], resolving the apparent conflict between Newton's proof of the conservation of angular momentum and Einstein's theory of [[special relativity]].\n\nMach's question regarding the bulging of rotating bodies is resolved because local space-time geometry is informing a rotating body about the rest of the universe. In Newton's theory of motion, space acts on objects, but is not acted upon. In Einstein's theory of motion, matter acts upon space-time geometry, deforming it; and space-time geometry acts upon matter, by affecting the behavior of [[geodesic]]s.\n\nAs a consequence, and unlike the classical theory, general relativity predicts that accelerating masses emit [[gravitational wave]]s, i.e. disturbances in the curvature of spacetime that propagate outward at lightspeed. Their existence (like [[Tests of general relativity|many other aspects of relativity]]) has been [[Gravitational wave#Detection|experimentally confirmed]] by astronomers\u2014most dramatically in the [[First observation of gravitational waves|direct detection of gravitational waves]] originating from a [[black hole merger]] when they passed through [[LIGO#Advanced LIGO|LIGO]] in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://news.mit.edu/2016/ligo-first-detection-gravitational-waves-0211 | title=Scientists make first direct detection of gravitational waves}}</ref>\n\n==Quantum mechanics==<!-- This section is linked from [[Time travel]] -->\n{{See also|Quantum nonlocality}}\nSince the early twentieth century, [[quantum mechanics]] has posed new challenges for the view that physical processes should obey [[Principle of locality|locality]]. Whether [[quantum entanglement]] counts as action-at-a-distance hinges on the nature of the [[wave function]] and [[decoherence]], issues over which there is still considerable debate among scientists and philosophers.\n\nOne important line of debate originated with Einstein, who challenged the idea that quantum mechanics offers a complete description of reality, along with [[Boris Podolsky]] and [[Nathan Rosen]]. They proposed a [[thought experiment]] involving an entangled pair of observables with non-commuting operators (e.g. position and momentum).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.47.777 |title=Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete? |year=1935 |last1=Einstein |first1=A. |last2=Podolsky |first2=B. |last3=Rosen |first3=N. |journal=Physical Review |volume=47 |issue=10 |pages=777\u2013780|bibcode = 1935PhRv...47..777E |url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/405662/files/PhysRev.47.777.pdf }}</ref>\n\nThis thought experiment, which came to be known as the [[EPR paradox]], hinges on the principle of locality. A common presentation of the paradox is as follows: two particles interact and fly off in opposite directions. Even when the particles are so far apart that any classical interaction would be impossible (see [[principle of locality]]), a measurement of one particle nonetheless determines the corresponding result of a measurement of the other.\n\nAfter the EPR paper, several scientists such as [[de Broglie]] studied [[hidden variable theory|local hidden variables theories]]. In the 1960s [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] derived an inequality that indicated a testable difference between the predictions of quantum mechanics and local [[hidden variable theory|hidden variables]] theories.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Bell | first=John S. | title=On the Problem of Hidden Variables in Quantum Mechanics | journal=Reviews of Modern Physics | publisher=American Physical Society (APS) | volume=38 | issue=3 | date=1966-07-01 | issn=0034-6861 | doi=10.1103/revmodphys.38.447 | pages=447\u2013452}}</ref>  To date, all [[Bell test experiments|experiments]] testing Bell-type inequalities in situations analogous to the EPR thought experiment have results consistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics, suggesting that local hidden variables theories can be ruled out. Whether or not this is interpreted as evidence for [[quantum nonlocality|nonlocality]] depends on one's [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]].\n\nNon-standard interpretations of quantum mechanics vary in their response to the EPR-type experiments. The [[Bohm interpretation]] gives an explanation based on nonlocal hidden variables for the correlations seen in entanglement. Many advocates of the [[many-worlds interpretation]] argue that it can explain these correlations in a way that does not require a violation of locality,<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Rubin |title=Locality in the Everett Interpretation of Heisenberg-Picture Quantum Mechanics |year=2001 |pages=301\u2013322 |volume=14 |journal=Found.

What happens in entanglement is that a measurement on one entangled particle yields a random result, then a later measurement on another particle in the same entangled (shared) quantum state must always yield a value correlated with the first measurement. Since no force, work, or information is communicated (the first measurement is random), the [[Speed of light#Upper limit on speeds|speed of light]] limit does not apply (see [[Quantum entanglement]] and [[Bell test experiments]]). In the standard [[Copenhagen interpretation]], as discussed above, entanglement demonstrates a genuine [[Quantum nonlocality|nonlocal effect]] of quantum mechanics, but does not communicate information, either quantum or classical.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dynamism (metaphysics)]]\n* [[Einstein's thought experiments]]\n* [[Interaction-free measurement]]\n* [[Quantum pseudo-telepathy]]\n* [[Quantum teleportation]]\n* [[Remote sensing]]\n* [[Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory]]\n\n==References==\n{{Free-content attribution\n\n| title = Newton\u2019s action at a distance \u2013 Different views\n\n| author = Nicolae Sfetcu\n\n| documentURL = https://www.setthings.com/en/newtons-action-at-a-distance-different-views/\n\n| license = CC-BY-SA\n\n}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Juan Yin and others (2013) [https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0614 Bounding the speed of \"Spooky Action at a Distance']\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Action At A Distance (Physics)}}\n[[Category:Interaction|Action at a distance]]\n", "text_old": "{{Distinguish|Action (physics)}}\n{{For|the anti-pattern in computer science|Action at a distance (computer programming)}}\n\nIn [[physics]], '''action at a distance''' is the concept that an object can be moved, changed, or otherwise affected without being physically touched (as in mechanical contact) by another object.

Fields, because of these and other difficulties, have been elevated to the fundamental operators in [[Quantum Field Theory]] and [[Modern physics]] has thus largely abandoned direct interaction theory.\n\n==Gravity==\n{{Main article|Speed of gravity}}\n\n===Newton===\n[[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s classical theory of gravity offered no prospect of identifying any mediator of gravitational interaction. His theory assumed that gravitation acts instantaneously, regardless of distance. <!--Newton had shown mathematically that if the gravitational interaction is not instantaneous, [[angular momentum]] is not conserved,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} and--> [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s observations gave strong evidence that in planetary motion angular momentum is conserved. (The mathematical proof is valid only in the case of a [[Euclidean geometry]].) Gravity is also known as a force of attraction between two objects because of their mass.\n\nFrom a Newtonian perspective, action at a distance can be regarded as \"a phenomenon in which a change in intrinsic properties of one system induces a change in the intrinsic properties of a distant system, independently of the influence of any other systems on the distant system, and without there being a process that carries this influence contiguously in space and time\" (Berkovitz 2008).<ref name=\"sep-qm-action-distance\"/>\n\nA related question, raised by [[Ernst Mach]], was how rotating bodies know how much to bulge at the equator. This, it seems, requires an action-at-a-distance from distant matter, informing the rotating object about the state of the universe. Einstein coined the term [[Mach's principle]] for this question.\n\n{{quote|It is inconceivable that inanimate Matter should, without the Mediation of something else, which is not material, operate upon, and affect other matter without mutual Contact\u2026That Gravity should be innate, inherent and essential to Matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance thro' a Vacuum, without the Mediation of any thing else, by and through which their Action and Force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an Absurdity that I believe no Man who has in philosophical Matters a competent Faculty of thinking can ever fall into it.

But, in his speculative moments, Newton oscillated between accepting and rejecting direct remote action. Newton, according to Kochiras, claims that [[God]] is a virtual omnipresent, the force/agent must subsist in substance, and God is omnipresent substantially, resulting in a hidden premise, the principle of local action.\n\nEric Schliesser, in ''Newton\u2019s substance monism, distant action, and the nature of Newton\u2019s Empiricism''<ref>Eric Schliesser (2011) [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shpsa.2010.11.004 Newton\u2019s Substance Monism, Distant Action, and the Nature of Newton\u2019s Empiricism: Discussion of H.

''Journal of the History of Philosophy'' vol. 52.4 (2014): 675\u2013702.\n\n===Einstein===\nAccording to [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[special relativity]], ''instantaneous action at a distance'' violates the relativistic [[Speed of light#Upper limit on speeds|upper limit on speed]] of propagation of information. If one of the interacting objects were to suddenly be displaced from its position, the other object would feel its influence instantaneously, meaning information had been transmitted faster than the [[speed of light]].\n\nOne of the conditions that a relativistic theory of gravitation must meet is that gravity is mediated with a speed that does not exceed {{math|'''''c'''''}}, the speed of light in a vacuum. From the previous success of electrodynamics, it was foreseeable that the relativistic theory of gravitation would have to use the concept of a [[Field (physics)|field]], or something similar.\n\nThis has been achieved by Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]], in which gravitational interaction is mediated by deformation of space-time geometry. Matter warps the geometry of space-time, and these effects are\u2014as with electric and magnetic fields\u2014propagated at the speed of light. Thus, in the presence of matter, space-time becomes [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]], resolving the apparent conflict between Newton's proof of the conservation of angular momentum and Einstein's theory of [[special relativity]].\n\nMach's question regarding the bulging of rotating bodies is resolved because local space-time geometry is informing a rotating body about the rest of the universe. In Newton's theory of motion, space acts on objects, but is not acted upon. In Einstein's theory of motion, matter acts upon space-time geometry, deforming it; and space-time geometry acts upon matter, by affecting the behavior of [[geodesic]]s.\n\nAs a consequence, and unlike the classical theory, general relativity predicts that accelerating masses emit [[gravitational wave]]s, i.e. disturbances in the curvature of spacetime that propagate outward at lightspeed. Their existence (like [[Tests of general relativity|many other aspects of relativity]]) has been [[Gravitational wave#Detection|experimentally confirmed]] by astronomers\u2014most dramatically in the [[First observation of gravitational waves|direct detection of gravitational waves]] originating from a [[black hole merger]] when they passed through [[LIGO#Advanced LIGO|LIGO]] in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://news.mit.edu/2016/ligo-first-detection-gravitational-waves-0211 | title=Scientists make first direct detection of gravitational waves}}</ref>\n\n==Quantum mechanics==<!-- This section is linked from [[Time travel]] -->\n{{See also|Quantum nonlocality}}\nSince the early twentieth century, [[quantum mechanics]] has posed new challenges for the view that physical processes should obey [[Principle of locality|locality]]. Whether [[quantum entanglement]] counts as action-at-a-distance hinges on the nature of the [[wave function]] and [[decoherence]], issues over which there is still considerable debate among scientists and philosophers.\n\nOne important line of debate originated with Einstein, who challenged the idea that quantum mechanics offers a complete description of reality, along with [[Boris Podolsky]] and [[Nathan Rosen]]. They proposed a [[thought experiment]] involving an entangled pair of observables with non-commuting operators (e.g. position and momentum).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.47.777 |title=Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete? |year=1935 |last1=Einstein |first1=A. |last2=Podolsky |first2=B. |last3=Rosen |first3=N. |journal=Physical Review |volume=47 |issue=10 |pages=777\u2013780|bibcode = 1935PhRv...47..777E |url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/405662/files/PhysRev.47.777.pdf }}</ref>\n\nThis thought experiment, which came to be known as the [[EPR paradox]], hinges on the principle of locality. A common presentation of the paradox is as follows: two particles interact and fly off in opposite directions. Even when the particles are so far apart that any classical interaction would be impossible (see [[principle of locality]]), a measurement of one particle nonetheless determines the corresponding result of a measurement of the other.\n\nAfter the EPR paper, several scientists such as [[de Broglie]] studied [[hidden variable theory|local hidden variables theories]]. In the 1960s [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] derived an inequality that indicated a testable difference between the predictions of quantum mechanics and local [[hidden variable theory|hidden variables]] theories.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Bell | first=John S. | title=On the Problem of Hidden Variables in Quantum Mechanics | journal=Reviews of Modern Physics | publisher=American Physical Society (APS) | volume=38 | issue=3 | date=1966-07-01 | issn=0034-6861 | doi=10.1103/revmodphys.38.447 | pages=447\u2013452}}</ref>  To date, all [[Bell test experiments|experiments]] testing Bell-type inequalities in situations analogous to the EPR thought experiment have results consistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics, suggesting that local hidden variables theories can be ruled out. Whether or not this is interpreted as evidence for [[quantum nonlocality|nonlocality]] depends on one's [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]].\n\nNon-standard interpretations of quantum mechanics vary in their response to the EPR-type experiments. The [[Bohm interpretation]] gives an explanation based on nonlocal hidden variables for the correlations seen in entanglement. Many advocates of the [[many-worlds interpretation]] argue that it can explain these correlations in a way that does not require a violation of locality,<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Rubin |title=Locality in the Everett Interpretation of Heisenberg-Picture Quantum Mechanics |year=2001 |pages=301\u2013322 |volume=14 |journal=Found.

What happens in entanglement is that a measurement on one entangled particle yields a random result, then a later measurement on another particle in the same entangled (shared) quantum state must always yield a value correlated with the first measurement. Since no force, work, or information is communicated (the first measurement is random), the [[Speed of light#Upper limit on speeds|speed of light]] limit does not apply (see [[Quantum entanglement]] and [[Bell test experiments]]). In the standard [[Copenhagen interpretation]], as discussed above, entanglement demonstrates a genuine [[Quantum nonlocality|nonlocal effect]] of quantum mechanics, but does not communicate information, either quantum or classical.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dynamism (metaphysics)]]\n* [[Einstein's thought experiments]]\n* [[Interaction-free measurement]]\n* [[Quantum pseudo-telepathy]]\n* [[Quantum teleportation]]\n* [[Remote sensing]]\n* [[Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory]]\n\n==References==\n{{Free-content attribution\n\n| title = Newton\u2019s action at a distance \u2013 Different views\n\n| author = Nicolae Sfetcu\n\n| documentURL = https://www.setthings.com/en/newtons-action-at-a-distance-different-views/\n\n| license = CC-BY-SA\n\n}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Juan Yin and others (2013) [https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0614 Bounding the speed of \"Spooky Action at a Distance']\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Action At A Distance (Physics)}}\n[[Category:Interaction|Action at a distance]]\n", "name_user": "Jaydavidmartin", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eElectricity and magnetism:comma adjustments", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance"}
