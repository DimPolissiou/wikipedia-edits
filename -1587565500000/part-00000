Medical organizations have more than 40 thousand devices for artificial lung ventilation, 124 devices for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

However, bed equipment varies from hospital to hospital. In terms of equipment \u2014 for example, CT and MRI devices \u2014 Russia is in 28th place with a dramatic gap from the leaders. [[Rosstat]] does not publish data on the number of places in intensive care units and equipment. In total, there are 1 million 172 thousand beds in Russian hospitals, according to Rosstat data for 2018. These include intensive care units. Intensive care bed means a bed equipped with a set of equipment for resuscitation and intensive care, including ventilators. The Institute of Phthisiopulmonology and infectious diseases of the Ministry of Health estimated the number of intensive care beds at just 12 thousand, which is three times less than the Ministry of Health's standard. The proekt.media website was able to find data on the number of intensive care beds in only 23 regions. Only Moscow, Kalmykia, Altai and Komi reached the standard of 3%. Other regions are significantly below the standard.<br/>Separate ventilators in hospitals should be more than intensive care beds. The number of ventilators in a region should be at least 1.5 times more than the number of intensive care beds. There are no official statistics on the number of ventilators. Federal authorities with the beginning of the epidemic conducted their own calculations: Deputy Prime Minister [[Tatyana Golikova]] said that Russia has 40 thousand ventilators. This is 3.4% of the total number of beds in Russia, and more than 12 thousand devices are missing from the standards of the Ministry of health.

showing the exponential growth of cases. The plots below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all y axes in order to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the

More than 55 thousand beds for infectious cases were deployed, including more than 12 thousand intensive care units and 396 observatories. 7.5 thousand Melzer boxes were prepared. Medical organizations have more than 40 thousand devices for artificial lung ventilation, 124 devices for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The government of the Russian Federation has allocated resources for the additional purchase of more than 500 devices, including 17 ECMO devices. Today, 6 thousand infectious diseases doctors and almost 2 thousand pulmonologists, more than 18 thousand nurses are ready to provide medical assistance.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://government.ru/news/39218/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200321055046/http://government.ru/news/39218/ |archive-date=21 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[OECD]], Russia ranks third in the number of beds per capita. However, bed equipment varies from hospital to hospital. In terms of equipment \u2014 for example, CT and MRI devices \u2014 Russia is in 28th place with a dramatic gap from the leaders. [[Rosstat]] does not publish data on the number of places in intensive care units and equipment. In total, there are 1 million 172 thousand beds in Russian hospitals, according to Rosstat data for 2018. These include intensive care units. Intensive care bed means a bed equipped with a set of equipment for resuscitation and intensive care, including ventilators. The Institute of Phthisiopulmonology and infectious diseases of the Ministry of Health estimated the number of intensive care beds at just 12 thousand, which is three times less than the Ministry of Health's standard. The proekt.media website was able to find data on the number of intensive care beds in only 23 regions. Only Moscow, Kalmykia, Altai and Komi reached the standard of 3%. Other regions are significantly below the standard.<br/>Separate ventilators in hospitals should be more than intensive care beds. The number of ventilators in a region should be at least 1.5 times more than the number of intensive care beds. There are no official statistics on the number of ventilators. Federal authorities with the beginning of the epidemic conducted their own calculations: Deputy Prime Minister [[Tatyana Golikova]] said that Russia has 40 thousand ventilators. This is 3.4% of the total number of beds in Russia, and more than 12 thousand devices are missing from the standards of the Ministry of health. This is a total deficit of 23%, but in some regions it is much larger. The website asks, can we be sure that all the devices included in the statistics are in working order? 58% of ventilators are more than 9 years old. Components may require more frequent replacement. For example, the oxygen sensor of the American model common in Russia, [[Puritan Bennett]], is subject to replacement every two years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.proekt.media/research/koronavirus-regiony/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200404095318/https://www.proekt.media/research/koronavirus-regiony/ |archive-date=4 April 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nData collected by the news website [[Meduza]] indicates that Russia's supply of ventilators is quite extensive: Even the number available per capita in some geographically peripheral regions, not to mention Moscow, significantly exceeds ventilator supplies in Western countries.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://meduza.io/en/feature/2020/03/21/the-ventilator-problem |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200326174233/https://meduza.io/en/feature/2020/03/21/the-ventilator-problem |archive-date=26 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n{{Collapse top}}\n{{Bar chart\n| title       = VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS\n| label_type  = REGION\n| data_type   = VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS\n| bar_width   = 50\n| width_units = em\n| data_max    = 57\n\n| label1   = \nKhanty-Mansi AO\n| data1    = \n56.8\n\n| label2   = \nSamara region\n| data2    = \n42.6\n\n| label3   = \nAmur region\n| data3    = \n42.5\n\n| label4   = \nMoscow (city)\n| data4    = \n40\n\n| label5   = \nKirov region\n| data5    = \n39.6\n\n| label6   = \nArkhangelsk region\n| data6    = \n38.4\n\n| label7   = \nSakha Republic (Yakutia)\n| data7    = \n37.2\n\n| label8   = \nSakhalin region\n| data8    = \n37.1\n\n| label9   = \nTomsk region\n| data9    = \n37.1\n\n| label10   = \nSt. Petersburg (city)\n| data10    = \n35.2\n\n| label11   = \nLipetsk region\n| data11    = \n35.1\n\n| label12   = \nSverdlovsk region\n| data12    = \n35\n\n| label13   = \nChuvash Republic (Chuvashia)\n| data13    = \n34.7\n\n| label14   = \nAltai Krai\n| data14    = \n34.6\n\n| label15   = \nRepublic of Crimea (status disputed)\n| data15    = \n34.3\n\n| label16   = \nRepublic of Karelia\n| data16    = \n32.5\n\n| label17   = \nYaroslavl region\n| data17    = \n31.5\n\n| label18   = \nVladimir region\n| data18    = \n31.4\n\n| label19   = \nTambov region\n| data19    = \n31.2\n| label20   = \nPenza region\n| data20    = \n30.7\n\n| label21   = \nMurmansk region\n| data21    = \n30.5\n\n| label22   = \nPskov region\n| data22    = \n30.3\n\n| label23   = \nRepublic of Tatarstan\n| data23    = \n28.2\n| label24   = \nOrenburg region\n| data24    = \n27.7\n\n| label25   = \n'''Russia'''\n| data25    = \n27.3\n\n| label26   = \nKemerovo region\n| data26    = \n27.3\n\n| label27   = \nRyazan region\n| data27    = \n27.1\n\n| label28   = \nIrkutsk region\n| data28    = \n26.5\n\n| label29   = \nRepublic of Bashkortostan (Bashkiria)\n| data29    = \n25.5\n\n| label30   = \nRepublic of Buryatia\n| data30    = \n24.9\n\n}}\n\n{{Bar chart\n| title       = VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS\n| label_type  = REGION\n| data_type   = VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS\n| bar_width   = 50\n| width_units = em\n| data_max    = 57\n\n| label1   = \nKrasnoyarsk Krai\n| data1    = \n24.6\n\n| label2   = \nChelyabinsk region\n| data2    = \n24.5\n\n| label3   = \nAstrakhan region\n| data3    = \n23.9\n\n| label4   = \nZabaikalsky Krai\n| data4    = \n22.8\n\n| label5   = \nSaratov region\n| data5    = \n22.1\n\n| label6   = \nVologda region\n| data6    = \n22.1\n\n| label7   = \nKursk region\n| data7    = \n21.9\n\n| label8   = \nOrel region\n| data8    = \n21.8\n\n| label9   = \nMari El Republic\n| data9    = \n20.9\n\n| label10   = \nNovosibirsk region\n| data10    = \n20.4\n\n| label11   = \nTula region\n| data11    = \n20.3\n\n| label12   = \nUdmurt Republic (Udmurtia)\n| data12    = \n20.2\n\n| label13   = \nPerm Krai\n| data13    = \n20\n\n| label14   = \nKostroma region\n| data14    = \n19.1\n\n| label15   = \n'''United States'''\n| data15    = \n18.8\n\n| label16   = \nKaliningrad region\n| data16    = \n18.8\n\n| label17   = \nOmsk region\n| data17    = \n18.7\n\n| label18   = \nIvanovo region\n| data18    = \n17.9\n\n| label19   = \nKrasnodar Krai\n| data19    = \n17.6\n\n| label20   = \nBelgorod region\n| data20    = \n16.8\n\n| label21   = \nRostov region\n| data21    = \n15.3\n\n| label22   = \nVoronezh region\n| data22    = \n15\n\n| label23   = \nLeningrad region\n| data23    = \n14.3\n\n| label24   = \n'''United Kingdom'''\n| data24    = \n12.9\n\n| label25   = \nSevastopol (city;

showing the exponential growth of cases. The plots below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all y axes in order to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the

Fair use is one of the [[limitations to copyright]] intended to balance the interests of copyright holders with the public interest in the wider distribution and use of creative works by allowing as a defense to copyright infringement claims certain limited uses that might otherwise be considered infringement.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Aufderheide|first1=Patricia|last2=Jaszi|first2=Peter|title=Reclaiming Fair Use: How to Put Balance Back in Copyright|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-03228-3|pages=10\u201311|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0OUcXGnexGYC|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref> Like \"[[fair dealing]]\" rights that exist in most countries with a British legal history, the fair use right is a general exception that applies to all different kinds of uses with all types of works and turns on a flexible proportionality test that examines the purpose of the use, the amount used, and the impact on the market of the original work. The innovation of the fair use right in US law is that it applies to a list of purposes that is preceded by the opening clause \"such as.\" This has allowed courts to apply it to technologies never envisioned in the original statute including Internet search, the VCR, and the reverse engineering of software.\n\n== History ==\nThe 1710 [[Statute of Anne]], an act of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], created copyright law to replace a system of private ordering enforced by the [[Stationers' Company]]. The Statute of Anne did not provide for legal unauthorized use of material protected by copyright. In ''[[Gyles v Wilcox]]'',<ref name=\"Gyles\">{{cite court|litigants=Gyles v Wilcox|vol=3|reporter=Atk|opinion=143;26 ER 489|court=Court of Chancery (England)|date=1740|url=http://copy.law.cam.ac.uk/cam/pdf/uk_1741_1.pdf}}</ref> the [[Court of Chancery]] established the doctrine of \"fair abridgement\", which permitted unauthorized abridgement of copyrighted works under certain circumstances. Over time, this doctrine evolved into the modern concepts of fair use and [[fair dealing]]. Fair use was a [[common law|common-law]] doctrine in the U.S. until it was incorporated into the [[United States Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act of 1976]], {{UnitedStatesCode|17|107}}.\n\nThe term \"fair use\" originated in the United States.<ref name=\"Folsom\">{{cite court |litigants=Folsom v.

A similar-sounding principle, [[fair dealing]], exists in some other [[common law]] jurisdictions but in fact it is more similar in principle to the enumerated exceptions found under civil law systems. [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] jurisdictions have other limitations and exceptions to copyright.\n\nIn response to perceived over-expansion of copyrights, several electronic civil liberties and free expression organizations began in the 1990s to add fair use cases to their dockets and concerns. These include the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (\"EFF\"), the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], the [[National Coalition Against Censorship]], the [[American Library Association]], numerous clinical programs at law schools, and others. The \"[[Lumen (website)|Chilling Effects]]\" archive was established in 2002 as a coalition of several law school clinics and the EFF to document the use of [[cease and desist]] letters. In 2006 [[Stanford University]] began an initiative called \"The [[Fair Use Project]]\" (FUP) to help artists, particularly filmmakers, fight lawsuits brought against them by large corporations.\n\n=== U.S. fair use factors{{anchor|Use rationale|17 USC \u00a7 107}}<!-- a considerable number of Wikipedia's copyright templates link to this section.--> ===\nExamples of fair use in [[United States copyright law]] include commentary, search engines, criticism, [[parody]], news reporting, research, and scholarship.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Netanei|first1=Neil Weinstock|title=Making Sense of Fair Use|journal=Lewis & Clark Law Review|date=2011|volume=15|issue=3|page=715|url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt5mh7w8hc/qt5mh7w8hc.pdf|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref> Fair use provides for the legal, unlicensed citation or incorporation of copyrighted material in another author's work under a four-factor [[Legal tests|test]].\n\nThe [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has traditionally characterized fair use as an [[affirmative defense]], but in ''[[Lenz v.

They were intended by Congress to restate, but not replace, the prior judge-made law. As Judge [[Pierre N. Leval]] has written, the statute does not \"define or explain [fair use's] contours or objectives.\" While it \"leav[es] open the possibility that other factors may bear on the question, the statute identifies none.\"<ref name=Leval /> That is, courts are entitled to consider other factors in addition to the four statutory factors.\n\n==== 1. Purpose and character of the use ====\nThe first factor is \"the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes.\" To justify the use as fair, one must demonstrate how it either advances knowledge or the progress of the arts through the addition of something new.\n\nIn the 1841 copyright case [[Folsom v. Marsh]], [[Joseph Story|Justice Joseph Story]] wrote:\n{{quote|\"[A] reviewer may fairly cite largely from the original work, if his design be really and truly to use the passages for the purposes of fair and reasonable criticism. On the other hand, it is as clear, that if he thus cites the most important parts of the work, with a view, not to criticise, but to supersede the use of the original work, and substitute the review for it, such a use will be deemed in law a [[piracy]].\"<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Harper & Row v.

In the 1994 decision ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music Inc]]'',<ref name=\"510 US 569\" /> the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] held that when the purpose of the use is transformative, this makes the first factor more likely to favor fair use.<ref name=Unbundling>{{cite journal|last1=Samuelson|first1=Pamela|title=Unbundling Fair Uses|journal=Fordham Law Review|date=2009|volume=77|url=http://fordhamlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/Vol_77/Samuelson2_Vol_77_Apr.pdf|accessdate=November 18, 2015}}</ref> Before the ''Campbell'' decision, federal Judge Pierre Leval argued that transformativeness is central to the fair use analysis in his 1990 article, [[Toward a Fair Use Standard]].<ref name=\"Leval\">{{cite journal|last=Leval|first=Pierre N.|year=1990|title=Toward a Fair Use Standard|journal=[[Harvard Law Review]]|volume=103|issue=5|pages=1105\u20131136|doi=10.2307/1341457|jstor=1341457}}</ref> ''[[Blanch v. Koons]]'' is another example of a fair use case that focused on transformativeness. In 2006, [[Jeff Koons]] used a photograph taken by commercial photographer [[Andrea Blanch]] in a collage painting.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Blanch v. Koons|vol=467 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=244 |court=2d Cir.|date=2006-10-26|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1374144.html|accessdate=2015-11-15}}</ref> Koons appropriated a central portion of an advertisement she had been commissioned to shoot for a magazine. Koons prevailed in part because his use was found transformative under the first fair use factor.\n\nThe ''Campbell'' case also addressed the subfactor mentioned in the quotation above, \"whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes.\" In an earlier case, ''[[Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.]]'', the Supreme Court had stated that \"every commercial use of copyrighted material is presumptively . . . unfair.\" In ''Campbell'', the court clarified that this is not a \"hard evidentiary presumption\" and that even the tendency that commercial purpose will \"weigh against a finding of fair use . . . will vary with the context.\" The ''Campbell'' court held that hip-hop group [[2 Live Crew]]'s parody of the song \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" was fair use, even though the parody was sold for profit. Thus, having a commercial purpose does not preclude a use from being found fair, even though it makes it less likely.<ref name=Reclaiming />\n\nLikewise, the noncommercial purpose of a use makes it more likely to be found a fair use, but it does not make it a fair use automatically.<ref name=Reclaiming>{{cite book|last1=Aufderheide|first1=Patricia|last2=Jaszi|first2=Peter|title=Reclaiming Fair Use: How to Put Balance Back in Copyright|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|chapter=Appendix D: Myths and Realities About Fair Use}}</ref> For instance, in ''[[L.A. Times v. Free Republic]]'', the court found that the noncommercial use of ''Los Angeles Times'' content by the Free Republic website was not fair use, since it allowed the public to obtain material at no cost that they would otherwise pay for. [[Richard Story]] similarly ruled in ''Code Revision Commission and State of Georgia v. [[Public.Resource.Org]], Inc.'' that despite the fact that it is a non-profit and didn't sell the work, the service profited from its unauthorized publication of the [[Official Code of Georgia Annotated]] because of \"the attention, recognition, and contributions\" it received in association with the work.<ref name=\"ars-georgiacopy\">{{cite web|title=If you publish Georgia's state laws, you'll get sued for copyright and lose|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/03/public-records-activist-violated-copyright-by-publishing-georgia-legal-code-online/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=March 30, 2017|date=2017-03-30}}</ref><ref>Judge Story's decision was reversed on appeal by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]], which did not consider the question of fair use. {{cite court | litigants=Code Revision Comm'n v.

Nature of the copyrighted work ====\n[[File:J. D. Salinger Signature.svg|thumb|alt=Signature of J.D. Salinger in 1950|The unpublished nature of [[J. D. Salinger]]'s letters was a key issue in the court's analysis of the second fair use factor in ''[[Salinger v. Random House]]''.]]\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court has ruled that the availability of copyright protection should not depend on the artistic quality or merit of a work, fair use analyses consider certain aspects of the work to be relevant, such as whether it is fictional or non-fictional.<ref>''[[Warner Bros. and J. K. Rowling v. RDR Books]]'', 575 F. Supp. 2d 513 (S.D.N.Y. 2008)</ref>\n\nTo prevent the private ownership of work that rightfully belongs in the public domain, [[idea-expression divide|facts and ideas are not protected by copyright]]\u2014only their particular expression or fixation merits such protection. On the other hand, the social usefulness of freely available information can weigh against the appropriateness of copyright for certain fixations. The [[Zapruder film]] of the [[assassination of President Kennedy]], for example, was purchased and copyrighted by ''Time'' magazine. Yet its copyright was not upheld, in the name of the public interest, when ''Time'' tried to [[enjoin]] the reproduction of stills from the film in a history book on the subject in ''Time Inc v. [[Bernard J. Geis|Bernard Geis]] Associates''.<ref>293 F. Supp. 130 (S.D.N.Y. 1968)</ref>\n\nIn the decisions of the [[Second Circuit]] in ''[[Salinger v. Random House]]''<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Salinger v. Random House, Inc. |vol=811 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=90 |pinpoint= |court=2d Cir. |date=1987 |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/811_F2d_90.htm |accessdate=2015-11-18 |quote=}}</ref> and in ''New Era Publications Int'l v. Henry Holt & Co'',<ref>''New Era Publications Int'l v. Henry Holt & Co'', 695 F. Supp. 1493 ([[S.D.N.Y.]] 1988)</ref> the aspect of whether the copied work has been previously published was considered crucial, assuming the right of the original author to control the circumstances of the publication of his work or preference not to publish at all. However, Judge Pierre N. Leval views this importation of certain aspects of France's ''droit moral d'artiste'' ([[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] of the artist) into American copyright law as \"bizarre and contradictory\" because it sometimes grants greater protection to works that were created for private purposes that have little to do with the public goals of copyright law, than to those works that copyright was initially conceived to protect.<ref name=\"Leval\" /> This is not to claim that unpublished works, or, more specifically, works not intended for publication, do not deserve legal protection, but that any such protection should come from laws about privacy, rather than laws about copyright. The statutory fair use provision was amended in response to these concerns by adding a final sentence: \"The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.\"\n\n==== 3. Amount and substantiality ====\n[[File:GoogleImageSearch.png|thumb|alt=Screenshot of Google Image Search results page|The Ninth Circuit has held that the use of thumbnails in image search engines is fair use.]]\nThe third factor assesses the amount and substantiality of the copyrighted work that has been used. In general, the less that is used in relation to the whole, the more likely the use will be considered fair.\n\nUsing most or all of a work does not bar a finding of fair use. It simply makes the third factor less favorable to the defendant. For instance, in ''Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.'' copying entire television programs for private viewing was upheld as fair use, at least when the copying is done for the purposes of [[time-shifting]]. In ''Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corporation'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] held that copying an entire photo to use as a [[thumbnail]] in online search results did not even weigh against fair use, \"if the secondary user only copies as much as is necessary for his or her intended use\".\n\nHowever, even the use of a small percentage of a work can make the third factor unfavorable to the defendant, because the \"substantiality\" of the portion used is considered in addition to the amount used. For instance, in ''[[Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises]]'',<ref name=Harper&Row>{{Ussc|name=Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises|471|539|1985}}</ref> the U.S. Supreme Court held that a news article's quotation of fewer than 400 words from [[Gerald Ford|President Ford]]'s 200,000-word memoir was sufficient to make the third fair use factor weigh against the defendants, because the portion taken was the \"heart of the work\". This use was ultimately found not to be fair.<ref name=Harper&Row />\n\n==== 4. Effect upon work's value ====\nThe fourth factor measures the effect that the allegedly infringing use has had on the copyright owner's ability to exploit his original work. The court not only investigates whether the defendant's specific use of the work has significantly harmed the copyright owner's market, but also whether such uses in general, if widespread, would harm the potential market of the original. The burden of proof here rests on the copyright owner, who must demonstrate the impact of the infringement on commercial use of the work.\n\nFor example, in ''Sony Corp v. Universal City Studios'',<ref name=Sony>{{ussc|name=Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.|link=|volume=464|page=417|pin=451|year=1984}}</ref> the copyright owner, [[Universal Studios|Universal]], failed to provide any empirical evidence that the use of [[Betamax]] had either reduced their viewership or negatively impacted their business. In ''Harper & Row,'' the case regarding President Ford's memoirs, the Supreme Court labeled the fourth factor \"the single most important element of fair use\" and it has enjoyed some level of primacy in fair use analyses ever since. Yet the Supreme Court's more recent announcement in ''Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music Inc''<ref name=\"510 US 569\">{{ussc|name=Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.|link=|volume=510|page=569|pin=|year=1994}}</ref> that \"all [four factors] are to be explored, and the results weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright\" has helped modulate this emphasis in interpretation.\n\nIn evaluating the fourth factor, courts often consider two kinds of harm to the potential market for the original work.\n* First, courts consider whether the use in question acts as a direct market [[substitute good|substitute]] for the original work. In ''Campbell'', the Supreme Court stated that \"when a commercial use amounts to mere duplication of the entirety of the original, it clearly supersedes the object of the original and serves as a market replacement for it, making it likely that cognizable market harm to the original will occur\". In one instance, a court ruled that this factor weighed against a defendant who had made unauthorized movie trailers for video retailers, since his trailers acted as direct substitutes for the copyright owner's official trailers.<ref name=VideoPipeline>{{cite court |litigants=Video Pipeline v. Buena Vista |vol=342 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=191 |pinpoint= |court=3d Cir. |date=2000-09-19 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11920632898766723981&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr |accessdate=2015-11-16 |quote=}}</ref>\n* Second, courts also consider whether potential market harm might exist beyond that of direct substitution, such as in the potential existence of a licensing market. This consideration has weighed against commercial copy shops that make copies of articles in course-packs for college students, when a market already existed for the [[licensing]] of course-pack copies.<ref name=PrincetonUP>{{cite court |litigants=Princeton University Press v. Michigan Document Services |vol=99 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1381 |pinpoint= |court=6th Cir. |date=1996 |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/99_F3d_1381.htm |accessdate=2015-11-16 |quote=}}''</ref>\n\nCourts recognize that certain kinds of market harm do not negate fair use, such as when a parody or negative review impairs the market of the original work. Copyright considerations may not shield a work against adverse criticism.\n\n==== Additional factors ====\nAs explained by Judge Leval, courts are permitted to include additional factors in their analysis.<ref name=Leval />\n\nOne such factor is acknowledgement of the copyrighted source. Giving the name of the photographer or author may help, but it does not automatically make a use fair. While [[plagiarism]] and copyright infringement are related matters, they are not identical. Plagiarism (using someone's words, ideas, images, etc. without acknowledgment) is a matter of professional ethics, while copyright is a matter of law, and protects exact expression, ''not'' ideas. One can plagiarize even a work that is not protected by copyright, for example by passing off a line from Shakespeare as one's own. Conversely, attribution prevents accusations of plagiarism, but it does not prevent infringement of copyright. For example, reprinting a copyrighted book without permission, while citing the original author, would be copyright infringement but not plagiarism.\n\n=== U.S. fair use procedure and practice ===\nThe U.S. Supreme Court described fair use as an [[affirmative defense]] in ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]''<ref name=\"510 US 569\" /> This means that in [[litigation]] on copyright infringement, the defendant bears the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of raising and proving]] that the use was fair and not an infringement. Thus, fair use need not even be raised as a defense unless the plaintiff first shows (or the defendant concedes) a \"[[prima facie]]\" case of copyright infringement. If the work was not copyrightable, the term had expired, or the defendant's work [[de minimis|borrowed only a small amount]], for instance, then the plaintiff cannot make out a ''prima facie'' case of infringement, and the defendant need not even raise the fair use defense. In addition, fair use is only one of many limitations, exceptions, and defenses to copyright infringement. Thus, a ''prima facie'' case can be defeated without relying on fair use. For instance, the [[Audio Home Recording Act]] establishes that it is legal, using certain technologies, to make copies of audio recordings for non-commercial personal use.<ref>See [[s:United States Code/Title 17/Chapter 10/Section 1008|USC October 17, 1008]], amended by the [[Audio Home Recording Act]].</ref>\n\nSome copyright owners claim infringement even in circumstances where the fair use defense would likely succeed, in hopes that the user will refrain from the use rather than spending resources in their defense. [[Strategic lawsuit against public participation]] (SLAPP) cases that allege copyright infringement, patent infringement, defamation, or libel may come into conflict with the defendant's right to [[freedom of speech]], and that possibility has prompted some jurisdictions to pass anti-SLAPP legislation that raises the plaintiff's burdens and risk.\n\nAlthough fair use ostensibly permits certain uses without liability, many content creators and publishers try to avoid a potential court battle by seeking a legally unnecessary license from copyright owners for ''any'' use of non-public domain material, even in situations where a fair use defense would likely succeed. The simple reason is that the license terms negotiated with the copyright owner may be much less expensive than defending against a copyright suit, or having the mere possibility of a lawsuit threaten the publication of a work in which a publisher has invested significant resources.\n\nFair use rights take precedence over the author's interest. Thus the copyright holder cannot use a non-binding disclaimer, or notification, to revoke the right of fair use on works. However, binding agreements such as contracts or licence agreements may take precedence over fair use rights.<ref>''Wall Data v. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Dept'' (9th Cir. May 17, 2006) ([http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2006/05/16/0356559.pdf PDF] at Ninth Circuit).</ref>\n\nThe practical effect of the fair use doctrine is that a number of conventional uses of copyrighted works are not considered infringing. For instance, quoting from a copyrighted work in order to criticize or comment upon it or teach students about it, is considered a fair use. Certain well-established uses cause few problems. A teacher who prints a few copies of a poem to illustrate a technique will have no problem on all four of the above factors (except possibly on amount and substantiality), but some cases are not so clear. All the factors are considered and balanced in each case: a book reviewer who quotes a paragraph as an example of the author's style will probably fall under fair use even though they may sell their review commercially; but a non-profit educational website that reproduces whole articles from technical magazines will probably be found to infringe if the publisher can demonstrate that the website affects the market for the magazine, even though the website itself is non-commercial.\n\nFair use is decided on a case by case basis, on the entirety of circumstances. The same act done by different means or for a different purpose can gain or lose fair use status. Even repeating an identical act at a different time can make a difference due to changing social, technological, or other surrounding circumstances.<ref name=Unbundling /><ref name=\"grand-upright\" />\n\n== Fair use in particular areas ==\n=== Computer code ===\nThe case ''[[Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.]]'' revolves around the use of [[application programming interface]]s (APIs) used to define functionality of the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programming language, created by [[Sun Microsystems]] and now owned by [[Oracle Corporation]]. [[Google]] used the APIs' definition and their [[structure, sequence and organization]] (SSO) in creating the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] to support the mobile device market. Oracle had sued Google in 2010 over both patent and copyright violations, but after two cycles, the case matter was narrowed down to whether Google's use of the definition and SSO of Oracle's Java APIs (determined to be copyrightable) was within fair use. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled against Google, stating that while Google could defend its use in the nature of the copyrighted work, its use was not transformative, and more significantly, it commercially harmed Oracle as they were also seeking entry to the mobile market. The case, should this ruling hold, could have a significant impact on developing products for [[interoperability]] using APIs, such as with many [[Open-source model|open source]] projects.\n\n=== Documentary films ===\nIn April 2006, the filmmakers of the ''[[Loose Change]]'' series were served with a lawsuit by [[Jules and G\u00e9d\u00e9on Naudet]] over the film's use of their footage, specifically footage of the firefighters discussing the collapse of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]].\nWith the help of an intellectual property lawyer, the creators of Loose Change successfully argued that a majority of the footage used was for historical purposes and was significantly transformed in the context of the film. They agreed to remove a few shots that were used as B-roll and served no purpose to the greater discussion. The case was settled and a potential multimillion-dollar lawsuit was avoided.\n\n''[[This Film Is Not Yet Rated]]'' also relied on fair use to feature several clips from copyrighted Hollywood productions. The director had originally planned to license these clips from their studio owners but discovered that studio licensing agreements would have prohibited him from using this material to criticize the entertainment industry. This prompted him to invoke the fair use doctrine, which permits limited use of copyrighted material to provide analysis and criticism of published works.\n\n=== File sharing ===\nIn 2009, fair use appeared as a defense in [[Trade group efforts against file sharing|lawsuits against filesharing]]. [[Charles Nesson]] argued that file-sharing qualifies as fair use in his defense of alleged filesharer [[Joel Tenenbaum]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Nate|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/05/harvard-prof-tells-judge-that-p2p-filesharing-is-fair-use.ars|title=Harvard prof tells judge that P2P filesharing is \"fair use\"|website=Ars Technica|date=2009-05-18|accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> [[Kiwi Camara]], defending alleged filesharer [[Jammie Thomas]], announced a similar defense.<ref>{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Nate|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/05/harvard-law-prof-helping-in-not-1-but-3-file-sharing-cases.ars|title=Lawyer: RIAA must pay back all \"$100M+\" it has allegedly collected|website=Ars Technica|date=2009-05-22|accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref>\nHowever, the Court in the case at bar rejected the idea that file-sharing is fair use.\n<ref>{{cite web|last=Engle|first=Eric|url=http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/copyright/sony-bmg-music-entertainment-et-al-v-tannenbaumbaum|title=Sony BMG Music Entertainment et al. v.

Arriba Soft Corp.]],'' provides and develops the relationship between [[thumbnails]], [[inline linking]] and fair use. In the lower District Court case on a motion for [[summary judgment]], Arriba Soft's use of thumbnail pictures and inline linking from Kelly's website in Arriba Soft's image [[Web search engine|search engine]] was found not to be fair use. That decision was appealed and contested by Internet rights activists such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], who argued that it was fair use.\n\nOn appeal, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] found in favor of the defendant, Arriba Soft. In reaching its decision, the court utilized the statutory four-factor analysis. First, it found the purpose of creating the thumbnail images as previews to be sufficiently transformative, noting that they were not meant to be viewed at high resolution as the original artwork was. Second, the photographs had already been published, diminishing the significance of their nature as creative works. Third, although normally making a \"full\" replication of a copyrighted work may appear to violate copyright, here it was found to be reasonable and necessary in light of the intended use. Lastly, the court found that the market for the original photographs would not be substantially diminished by the creation of the thumbnails. To the contrary, the thumbnail searches could increase the exposure of the originals. In looking at all these factors as a whole, the court found that the thumbnails were fair use and remanded the case to the lower court for trial after issuing a revised opinion on July 7, 2003. The remaining issues were resolved with a [[default judgment]] after Arriba Soft had experienced significant financial problems and failed to reach a negotiated settlement.\n\nIn August 2008, Judge [[Jeremy Fogel]] of the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|Northern District of California]] ruled in ''[[Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.]]'' that copyright holders cannot order a deletion of an online file without determining whether that posting reflected \"fair use\" of the copyrighted material. The case involved Stephanie Lenz, a writer and editor from [[Gallitzin, Pennsylvania]], who made a home video of her thirteen-month-old son dancing to Prince's song [[Let's Go Crazy]] and posted the video on [[YouTube]]. Four months later, [[Universal Music]], the owner of the copyright to the song, ordered YouTube to remove the video under the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]. Lenz notified YouTube immediately that her video was within the scope of fair use, and she demanded that it be restored.

Such insurance protects against errors and omissions made during the copyright clearance of material in the film. Before the ''Documentary Filmmakers' Statement of Best Practices in Fair Use'' was created in 2005, it was nearly impossible to obtain errors and omissions insurance for copyright clearance work that relied in part on fair use. This meant documentarians had either to obtain a license for the material or to cut it from their films. In many cases, it was impossible to license the material because the filmmaker sought to use it in a critical way. Soon after the best practices statement was released, all errors and omissions insurers in the U.S. shifted to begin offering routine fair use coverage.<ref name=Aufderheide>{{cite book|last1=Aufderheide|first1=Patricia|last2=Jaszi|first2=Peter|title=Reclaiming Fair Use: How to Put Balance Back in Copyright|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-03228-3}}</ref>\n\n=== Music sampling ===\n{{further|Legal issues surrounding music sampling}}\nBefore 1991, [[sampling (music)|sampling]] in certain genres of music was accepted practice and the copyright considerations were viewed as largely irrelevant.

Dimension Films |vol=230 |reporter=F.Supp.2d |opinion= |pinpoint=841 |court= |date= |url= |accessdate= |quote=}}</ref> This left the door open for the ''[[de minimis]]'' doctrine, for short or unrecognizable samples; such uses would not rise to the level of copyright infringement, because under the ''de minimis'' doctrine, \"the law does not care about trifles.\" However, 3 years later, the Sixth Circuit effectively eliminated the ''de minimis'' doctrine in the ''[[Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Dimension Films]]'' case, holding that artists must \"get a license or do not sample\".<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Bridgeport Music, Inc. v.

These fair use cases distinguish between parodies, which use a work in order to poke fun at or comment on the work itself and [[satire]], or comment on something else. Courts have been more willing to grant fair use protections to parodies than to satires, but the ultimate outcome in either circumstance will turn on the application of the four fair use factors.\n\nFor example, when [[Tom Forsythe]] appropriated [[Barbie]] dolls for his photography project \"Food Chain Barbie\" (depicting several copies of the doll naked and disheveled and about to be baked in an oven, blended in a food mixer, and the like), [[Mattel]] lost its copyright infringement lawsuit against him because his work effectively parodies Barbie and the values she represents.<ref name=\"Mattel\">{{cite court|litigants=Mattel Inc v.

Acuff-Rose Music Inc]]''<ref name=\"510 US 569\" /> the U.S. Supreme Court recognized parody as a potential fair use, even when done for profit. [[Roy Orbison]]'s publisher, [[Acuff-Rose Music]], had sued [[2 Live Crew]] in 1989 for their use of Orbison's \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" in a mocking rap version with altered lyrics. The Supreme Court viewed 2 Live Crew's version as a ridiculing commentary on the earlier work, and ruled that when the parody was itself the product rather than mere advertising, commercial nature did not bar the defense. The ''Campbell'' court also distinguished parodies from [[satire]], which they described as a broader social critique not intrinsically tied to ridicule of a specific work and so not deserving of the same use exceptions as parody because the satirist's ideas are capable of expression without the use of the other particular work.\n\nA number of appellate decisions have recognized that a parody may be a protected fair use, including the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second]] (''[[Leibovitz v. Paramount Pictures Corp.]]''); the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth]] (''Mattel v. Walking Mountain Productions''); and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh]] Circuits (''[[Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin Co.]]''). In the 2001 ''Suntrust Bank'' case, Suntrust Bank and the [[Margaret Mitchell]] estate unsuccessfully brought suit to halt the publication of ''[[The Wind Done Gone]]'', which reused many of the characters and situations from ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'' but told the events from the point of view of the enslaved people rather than the slaveholders. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh Circuit]], applying ''Campbell'', found that ''The Wind Done Gone'' was fair use and vacated the [[U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia|district court's]] injunction against its publication.\n\nCases in which a satirical use was found to be fair include ''Blanch v. Koons'' and ''Williams v. Columbia Broadcasting Systems''.<ref name=Unbundling />\n\n=== Text and data mining ===\nThe transformative nature of computer based analytical processes such as [[text mining]], [[web mining]] and [[data mining]] has led many to form the view that such uses would be protected under fair use. This view was substantiated by the rulings of Judge [[Denny Chin]] in ''[[Authors Guild, Inc. v. Google, Inc.]]'', a case involving mass digitisation of millions of books from research library collections. As part of the ruling that found the book digitisation project was fair use, the judge stated \"Google Books is also transformative in the sense that it has transformed book text into data for purposes of substantive research, including data mining and text mining in new areas\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rosati|first1=Eleonora|title=A Closer Look at the Google Books Library Project Decision|url=http://ipkitten.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/a-closer-look-at-google-books-library.html|accessdate=November 15, 2014|publisher=The IPKAT|date=November 17, 2013}}</ref><ref name=GoogleVictory>{{cite web|title=Google's Fair Use Victory|url=http://www.lawdownunder.com/google-books-project-covered-fair-use-doctrine/|website=Law Down Under|accessdate=November 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117031600/http://www.lawdownunder.com/google-books-project-covered-fair-use-doctrine/|archive-date=November 17, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nText and data mining was subject to further review in ''[[Authors Guild v.

Many countries have some reference to an exemption for educational use, though the extent of this exemption varies widely.\n\nSources differ on whether fair use is fully recognized by countries other than the United States. [[American University]]'s ''infojustice.org'' published a compilation of portions of over 40 nations' laws that explicitly mention fair use or fair dealing, and asserts that some of the fair dealing laws, such as Canada's, have evolved (such as through judicial precedents) to be quite close to those of the United States.

The innovation of the fair use right in US law is that it applies to a list of purposes that is preceded by the opening clause \"such as.\" This has allowed courts to apply it to technologies never envisioned in the original statute including Internet search, the VCR, and the reverse engineering of software.\n\n== History ==\nThe 1710 [[Statute of Anne]], an act of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], created copyright law to replace a system of private ordering enforced by the [[Stationers' Company]].

Over time, this doctrine evolved into the modern concepts of fair use and [[fair dealing]]. Fair use was a [[common law|common-law]] doctrine in the U.S. until it was incorporated into the [[United States Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act of 1976]], {{UnitedStatesCode|17|107}}.\n\nThe term \"fair use\" originated in the United States.<ref name=\"Folsom\">{{cite court |litigants=Folsom v.

A similar-sounding principle, [[fair dealing]], exists in some other [[common law]] jurisdictions but in fact it is more similar in principle to the enumerated exceptions found under civil law systems. [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] jurisdictions have other limitations and exceptions to copyright.\n\nIn response to perceived over-expansion of copyrights, several electronic civil liberties and free expression organizations began in the 1990s to add fair use cases to their dockets and concerns. These include the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (\"EFF\"), the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], the [[National Coalition Against Censorship]], the [[American Library Association]], numerous clinical programs at law schools, and others. The \"[[Lumen (website)|Chilling Effects]]\" archive was established in 2002 as a coalition of several law school clinics and the EFF to document the use of [[cease and desist]] letters.

On the other hand, it is as clear, that if he thus cites the most important parts of the work, with a view, not to criticize, but to supersede the use of the original work, and substitute the review for it, such a use will be deemed in law a piracy ...\n\nIn short, we must often ... look to the nature and objects of the selections made, the quantity and value of the materials used, and the degree in which the use may prejudice the sale, or diminish the profits, or supersede the objects, of the original work.\n}}\n\nThe statutory fair use factors quoted above come from the Copyright Act of 1976, which is codified at {{USC|17|107}}. They were intended by Congress to restate, but not replace, the prior judge-made law. As Judge [[Pierre N. Leval]] has written, the statute does not \"define or explain [fair use's] contours or objectives.\" While it \"leav[es] open the possibility that other factors may bear on the question, the statute identifies none.\"<ref name=Leval /> That is, courts are entitled to consider other factors in addition to the four statutory factors.\n\n==== 1. Purpose and character of the use ====\nThe first factor is \"the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes.\" To justify the use as fair, one must demonstrate how it either advances knowledge or the progress of the arts through the addition of something new.\n\nIn the 1841 copyright case [[Folsom v. Marsh]], [[Joseph Story|Justice Joseph Story]] wrote:\n{{quote|\"[A] reviewer may fairly cite largely from the original work, if his design be really and truly to use the passages for the purposes of fair and reasonable criticism. On the other hand, it is as clear, that if he thus cites the most important parts of the work, with a view, not to criticise, but to supersede the use of the original work, and substitute the review for it, such a use will be deemed in law a [[piracy]].\"<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Harper & Row v.

In the 1994 decision ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music Inc]]'',<ref name=\"510 US 569\" /> the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] held that when the purpose of the use is transformative, this makes the first factor more likely to favor fair use.<ref name=Unbundling>{{cite journal|last1=Samuelson|first1=Pamela|title=Unbundling Fair Uses|journal=Fordham Law Review|date=2009|volume=77|url=http://fordhamlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/Vol_77/Samuelson2_Vol_77_Apr.pdf|accessdate=November 18, 2015}}</ref> Before the ''Campbell'' decision, federal Judge Pierre Leval argued that transformativeness is central to the fair use analysis in his 1990 article, [[Toward a Fair Use Standard]].<ref name=\"Leval\">{{cite journal|last=Leval|first=Pierre N.|year=1990|title=Toward a Fair Use Standard|journal=[[Harvard Law Review]]|volume=103|issue=5|pages=1105\u20131136|doi=10.2307/1341457|jstor=1341457}}</ref> ''[[Blanch v. Koons]]'' is another example of a fair use case that focused on transformativeness. In 2006, [[Jeff Koons]] used a photograph taken by commercial photographer [[Andrea Blanch]] in a collage painting.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Blanch v. Koons|vol=467 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=244 |court=2d Cir.|date=2006-10-26|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1374144.html|accessdate=2015-11-15}}</ref> Koons appropriated a central portion of an advertisement she had been commissioned to shoot for a magazine. Koons prevailed in part because his use was found transformative under the first fair use factor.\n\nThe ''Campbell'' case also addressed the subfactor mentioned in the quotation above, \"whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes.\" In an earlier case, ''[[Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.]]'', the Supreme Court had stated that \"every commercial use of copyrighted material is presumptively . . . unfair.\" In ''Campbell'', the court clarified that this is not a \"hard evidentiary presumption\" and that even the tendency that commercial purpose will \"weigh against a finding of fair use . . . will vary with the context.\" The ''Campbell'' court held that hip-hop group [[2 Live Crew]]'s parody of the song \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" was fair use, even though the parody was sold for profit. Thus, having a commercial purpose does not preclude a use from being found fair, even though it makes it less likely.<ref name=Reclaiming />\n\nLikewise, the noncommercial purpose of a use makes it more likely to be found a fair use, but it does not make it a fair use automatically.<ref name=Reclaiming>{{cite book|last1=Aufderheide|first1=Patricia|last2=Jaszi|first2=Peter|title=Reclaiming Fair Use: How to Put Balance Back in Copyright|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|chapter=Appendix D: Myths and Realities About Fair Use}}</ref> For instance, in ''[[L.A. Times v. Free Republic]]'', the court found that the noncommercial use of ''Los Angeles Times'' content by the Free Republic website was not fair use, since it allowed the public to obtain material at no cost that they would otherwise pay for. [[Richard Story]] similarly ruled in ''Code Revision Commission and State of Georgia v. [[Public.Resource.Org]], Inc.'' that despite the fact that it is a non-profit and didn't sell the work, the service profited from its unauthorized publication of the [[Official Code of Georgia Annotated]] because of \"the attention, recognition, and contributions\" it received in association with the work.<ref name=\"ars-georgiacopy\">{{cite web|title=If you publish Georgia's state laws, you'll get sued for copyright and lose|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/03/public-records-activist-violated-copyright-by-publishing-georgia-legal-code-online/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=March 30, 2017|date=2017-03-30}}</ref><ref>Judge Story's decision was reversed on appeal by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]], which did not consider the question of fair use. {{cite court | litigants=Code Revision Comm'n v.

Nature of the copyrighted work ====\n[[File:J. D. Salinger Signature.svg|thumb|alt=Signature of J.D. Salinger in 1950|The unpublished nature of [[J. D. Salinger]]'s letters was a key issue in the court's analysis of the second fair use factor in ''[[Salinger v. Random House]]''.]]\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court has ruled that the availability of copyright protection should not depend on the artistic quality or merit of a work, fair use analyses consider certain aspects of the work to be relevant, such as whether it is fictional or non-fictional.<ref>''[[Warner Bros. and J. K. Rowling v. RDR Books]]'', 575 F. Supp. 2d 513 (S.D.N.Y. 2008)</ref>\n\nTo prevent the private ownership of work that rightfully belongs in the public domain, [[idea-expression divide|facts and ideas are not protected by copyright]]\u2014only their particular expression or fixation merits such protection. On the other hand, the social usefulness of freely available information can weigh against the appropriateness of copyright for certain fixations. The [[Zapruder film]] of the [[assassination of President Kennedy]], for example, was purchased and copyrighted by ''Time'' magazine. Yet its copyright was not upheld, in the name of the public interest, when ''Time'' tried to [[enjoin]] the reproduction of stills from the film in a history book on the subject in ''Time Inc v. [[Bernard J. Geis|Bernard Geis]] Associates''.<ref>293 F. Supp. 130 (S.D.N.Y. 1968)</ref>\n\nIn the decisions of the [[Second Circuit]] in ''[[Salinger v. Random House]]''<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Salinger v. Random House, Inc. |vol=811 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=90 |pinpoint= |court=2d Cir. |date=1987 |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/811_F2d_90.htm |accessdate=2015-11-18 |quote=}}</ref> and in ''New Era Publications Int'l v. Henry Holt & Co'',<ref>''New Era Publications Int'l v. Henry Holt & Co'', 695 F. Supp. 1493 ([[S.D.N.Y.]] 1988)</ref> the aspect of whether the copied work has been previously published was considered crucial, assuming the right of the original author to control the circumstances of the publication of his work or preference not to publish at all. However, Judge Pierre N. Leval views this importation of certain aspects of France's ''droit moral d'artiste'' ([[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] of the artist) into American copyright law as \"bizarre and contradictory\" because it sometimes grants greater protection to works that were created for private purposes that have little to do with the public goals of copyright law, than to those works that copyright was initially conceived to protect.<ref name=\"Leval\" /> This is not to claim that unpublished works, or, more specifically, works not intended for publication, do not deserve legal protection, but that any such protection should come from laws about privacy, rather than laws about copyright. The statutory fair use provision was amended in response to these concerns by adding a final sentence: \"The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.\"\n\n==== 3. Amount and substantiality ====\n[[File:GoogleImageSearch.png|thumb|alt=Screenshot of Google Image Search results page|The Ninth Circuit has held that the use of thumbnails in image search engines is fair use.]]\nThe third factor assesses the amount and substantiality of the copyrighted work that has been used. In general, the less that is used in relation to the whole, the more likely the use will be considered fair.\n\nUsing most or all of a work does not bar a finding of fair use. It simply makes the third factor less favorable to the defendant. For instance, in ''Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.'' copying entire television programs for private viewing was upheld as fair use, at least when the copying is done for the purposes of [[time-shifting]]. In ''Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corporation'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] held that copying an entire photo to use as a [[thumbnail]] in online search results did not even weigh against fair use, \"if the secondary user only copies as much as is necessary for his or her intended use\".\n\nHowever, even the use of a small percentage of a work can make the third factor unfavorable to the defendant, because the \"substantiality\" of the portion used is considered in addition to the amount used. For instance, in ''[[Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises]]'',<ref name=Harper&Row>{{Ussc|name=Harper & Row v. Nation Enterprises|471|539|1985}}</ref> the U.S. Supreme Court held that a news article's quotation of fewer than 400 words from [[Gerald Ford|President Ford]]'s 200,000-word memoir was sufficient to make the third fair use factor weigh against the defendants, because the portion taken was the \"heart of the work\". This use was ultimately found not to be fair.<ref name=Harper&Row />\n\n==== 4. Effect upon work's value ====\nThe fourth factor measures the effect that the allegedly infringing use has had on the copyright owner's ability to exploit his original work. The court not only investigates whether the defendant's specific use of the work has significantly harmed the copyright owner's market, but also whether such uses in general, if widespread, would harm the potential market of the original. The burden of proof here rests on the copyright owner, who must demonstrate the impact of the infringement on commercial use of the work.\n\nFor example, in ''Sony Corp v. Universal City Studios'',<ref name=Sony>{{ussc|name=Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.|link=|volume=464|page=417|pin=451|year=1984}}</ref> the copyright owner, [[Universal Studios|Universal]], failed to provide any empirical evidence that the use of [[Betamax]] had either reduced their viewership or negatively impacted their business. In ''Harper & Row,'' the case regarding President Ford's memoirs, the Supreme Court labeled the fourth factor \"the single most important element of fair use\" and it has enjoyed some level of primacy in fair use analyses ever since. Yet the Supreme Court's more recent announcement in ''Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music Inc''<ref name=\"510 US 569\">{{ussc|name=Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.|link=|volume=510|page=569|pin=|year=1994}}</ref> that \"all [four factors] are to be explored, and the results weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright\" has helped modulate this emphasis in interpretation.\n\nIn evaluating the fourth factor, courts often consider two kinds of harm to the potential market for the original work.\n* First, courts consider whether the use in question acts as a direct market [[substitute good|substitute]] for the original work. In ''Campbell'', the Supreme Court stated that \"when a commercial use amounts to mere duplication of the entirety of the original, it clearly supersedes the object of the original and serves as a market replacement for it, making it likely that cognizable market harm to the original will occur\". In one instance, a court ruled that this factor weighed against a defendant who had made unauthorized movie trailers for video retailers, since his trailers acted as direct substitutes for the copyright owner's official trailers.<ref name=VideoPipeline>{{cite court |litigants=Video Pipeline v. Buena Vista |vol=342 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=191 |pinpoint= |court=3d Cir. |date=2000-09-19 |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11920632898766723981&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr |accessdate=2015-11-16 |quote=}}</ref>\n* Second, courts also consider whether potential market harm might exist beyond that of direct substitution, such as in the potential existence of a licensing market. This consideration has weighed against commercial copy shops that make copies of articles in course-packs for college students, when a market already existed for the [[licensing]] of course-pack copies.<ref name=PrincetonUP>{{cite court |litigants=Princeton University Press v. Michigan Document Services |vol=99 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1381 |pinpoint= |court=6th Cir. |date=1996 |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/99_F3d_1381.htm |accessdate=2015-11-16 |quote=}}''</ref>\n\nCourts recognize that certain kinds of market harm do not negate fair use, such as when a parody or negative review impairs the market of the original work. Copyright considerations may not shield a work against adverse criticism.\n\n==== Additional factors ====\nAs explained by Judge Leval, courts are permitted to include additional factors in their analysis.<ref name=Leval />\n\nOne such factor is acknowledgement of the copyrighted source. Giving the name of the photographer or author may help, but it does not automatically make a use fair. While [[plagiarism]] and copyright infringement are related matters, they are not identical. Plagiarism (using someone's words, ideas, images, etc. without acknowledgment) is a matter of professional ethics, while copyright is a matter of law, and protects exact expression, ''not'' ideas. One can plagiarize even a work that is not protected by copyright, for example by passing off a line from Shakespeare as one's own. Conversely, attribution prevents accusations of plagiarism, but it does not prevent infringement of copyright. For example, reprinting a copyrighted book without permission, while citing the original author, would be copyright infringement but not plagiarism.\n\n=== U.S. fair use procedure and practice ===\nThe U.S. Supreme Court described fair use as an [[affirmative defense]] in ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]''<ref name=\"510 US 569\" /> This means that in [[litigation]] on copyright infringement, the defendant bears the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of raising and proving]] that the use was fair and not an infringement. Thus, fair use need not even be raised as a defense unless the plaintiff first shows (or the defendant concedes) a \"[[prima facie]]\" case of copyright infringement. If the work was not copyrightable, the term had expired, or the defendant's work [[de minimis|borrowed only a small amount]], for instance, then the plaintiff cannot make out a ''prima facie'' case of infringement, and the defendant need not even raise the fair use defense. In addition, fair use is only one of many limitations, exceptions, and defenses to copyright infringement. Thus, a ''prima facie'' case can be defeated without relying on fair use. For instance, the [[Audio Home Recording Act]] establishes that it is legal, using certain technologies, to make copies of audio recordings for non-commercial personal use.<ref>See [[s:United States Code/Title 17/Chapter 10/Section 1008|USC October 17, 1008]], amended by the [[Audio Home Recording Act]].</ref>\n\nSome copyright owners claim infringement even in circumstances where the fair use defense would likely succeed, in hopes that the user will refrain from the use rather than spending resources in their defense. [[Strategic lawsuit against public participation]] (SLAPP) cases that allege copyright infringement, patent infringement, defamation, or libel may come into conflict with the defendant's right to [[freedom of speech]], and that possibility has prompted some jurisdictions to pass anti-SLAPP legislation that raises the plaintiff's burdens and risk.\n\nAlthough fair use ostensibly permits certain uses without liability, many content creators and publishers try to avoid a potential court battle by seeking a legally unnecessary license from copyright owners for ''any'' use of non-public domain material, even in situations where a fair use defense would likely succeed. The simple reason is that the license terms negotiated with the copyright owner may be much less expensive than defending against a copyright suit, or having the mere possibility of a lawsuit threaten the publication of a work in which a publisher has invested significant resources.\n\nFair use rights take precedence over the author's interest. Thus the copyright holder cannot use a non-binding disclaimer, or notification, to revoke the right of fair use on works. However, binding agreements such as contracts or licence agreements may take precedence over fair use rights.<ref>''Wall Data v. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Dept'' (9th Cir. May 17, 2006) ([http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2006/05/16/0356559.pdf PDF] at Ninth Circuit).</ref>\n\nThe practical effect of the fair use doctrine is that a number of conventional uses of copyrighted works are not considered infringing. For instance, quoting from a copyrighted work in order to criticize or comment upon it or teach students about it, is considered a fair use. Certain well-established uses cause few problems. A teacher who prints a few copies of a poem to illustrate a technique will have no problem on all four of the above factors (except possibly on amount and substantiality), but some cases are not so clear. All the factors are considered and balanced in each case: a book reviewer who quotes a paragraph as an example of the author's style will probably fall under fair use even though they may sell their review commercially; but a non-profit educational website that reproduces whole articles from technical magazines will probably be found to infringe if the publisher can demonstrate that the website affects the market for the magazine, even though the website itself is non-commercial.\n\nFair use is decided on a case by case basis, on the entirety of circumstances. The same act done by different means or for a different purpose can gain or lose fair use status. Even repeating an identical act at a different time can make a difference due to changing social, technological, or other surrounding circumstances.<ref name=Unbundling /><ref name=\"grand-upright\" />\n\n== Fair use in particular areas ==\n=== Computer code ===\nThe case ''[[Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.]]'' revolves around the use of [[application programming interface]]s (APIs) used to define functionality of the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programming language, created by [[Sun Microsystems]] and now owned by [[Oracle Corporation]]. [[Google]] used the APIs' definition and their [[structure, sequence and organization]] (SSO) in creating the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] to support the mobile device market. Oracle had sued Google in 2010 over both patent and copyright violations, but after two cycles, the case matter was narrowed down to whether Google's use of the definition and SSO of Oracle's Java APIs (determined to be copyrightable) was within fair use. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled against Google, stating that while Google could defend its use in the nature of the copyrighted work, its use was not transformative, and more significantly, it commercially harmed Oracle as they were also seeking entry to the mobile market. The case, should this ruling hold, could have a significant impact on developing products for [[interoperability]] using APIs, such as with many [[Open-source model|open source]] projects.\n\n=== Documentary films ===\nIn April 2006, the filmmakers of the ''[[Loose Change]]'' series were served with a lawsuit by [[Jules and G\u00e9d\u00e9on Naudet]] over the film's use of their footage, specifically footage of the firefighters discussing the collapse of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]].\nWith the help of an intellectual property lawyer, the creators of Loose Change successfully argued that a majority of the footage used was for historical purposes and was significantly transformed in the context of the film. They agreed to remove a few shots that were used as B-roll and served no purpose to the greater discussion. The case was settled and a potential multimillion-dollar lawsuit was avoided.\n\n''[[This Film Is Not Yet Rated]]'' also relied on fair use to feature several clips from copyrighted Hollywood productions. The director had originally planned to license these clips from their studio owners but discovered that studio licensing agreements would have prohibited him from using this material to criticize the entertainment industry. This prompted him to invoke the fair use doctrine, which permits limited use of copyrighted material to provide analysis and criticism of published works.\n\n=== File sharing ===\nIn 2009, fair use appeared as a defense in [[Trade group efforts against file sharing|lawsuits against filesharing]]. [[Charles Nesson]] argued that file-sharing qualifies as fair use in his defense of alleged filesharer [[Joel Tenenbaum]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Nate|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/05/harvard-prof-tells-judge-that-p2p-filesharing-is-fair-use.ars|title=Harvard prof tells judge that P2P filesharing is \"fair use\"|website=Ars Technica|date=2009-05-18|accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> [[Kiwi Camara]], defending alleged filesharer [[Jammie Thomas]], announced a similar defense.<ref>{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Nate|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/05/harvard-law-prof-helping-in-not-1-but-3-file-sharing-cases.ars|title=Lawyer: RIAA must pay back all \"$100M+\" it has allegedly collected|website=Ars Technica|date=2009-05-22|accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref>\nHowever, the Court in the case at bar rejected the idea that file-sharing is fair use.\n<ref>{{cite web|last=Engle|first=Eric|url=http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/digest/copyright/sony-bmg-music-entertainment-et-al-v-tannenbaumbaum|title=Sony BMG Music Entertainment et al. v.

Arriba Soft Corp.]],'' provides and develops the relationship between [[thumbnails]], [[inline linking]] and fair use. In the lower District Court case on a motion for [[summary judgment]], Arriba Soft's use of thumbnail pictures and inline linking from Kelly's website in Arriba Soft's image [[Web search engine|search engine]] was found not to be fair use. That decision was appealed and contested by Internet rights activists such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], who argued that it was fair use.\n\nOn appeal, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] found in favor of the defendant, Arriba Soft. In reaching its decision, the court utilized the statutory four-factor analysis. First, it found the purpose of creating the thumbnail images as previews to be sufficiently transformative, noting that they were not meant to be viewed at high resolution as the original artwork was. Second, the photographs had already been published, diminishing the significance of their nature as creative works. Third, although normally making a \"full\" replication of a copyrighted work may appear to violate copyright, here it was found to be reasonable and necessary in light of the intended use. Lastly, the court found that the market for the original photographs would not be substantially diminished by the creation of the thumbnails. To the contrary, the thumbnail searches could increase the exposure of the originals. In looking at all these factors as a whole, the court found that the thumbnails were fair use and remanded the case to the lower court for trial after issuing a revised opinion on July 7, 2003. The remaining issues were resolved with a [[default judgment]] after Arriba Soft had experienced significant financial problems and failed to reach a negotiated settlement.\n\nIn August 2008, Judge [[Jeremy Fogel]] of the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|Northern District of California]] ruled in ''[[Lenz v. Universal Music Corp.]]'' that copyright holders cannot order a deletion of an online file without determining whether that posting reflected \"fair use\" of the copyrighted material. The case involved Stephanie Lenz, a writer and editor from [[Gallitzin, Pennsylvania]], who made a home video of her thirteen-month-old son dancing to Prince's song [[Let's Go Crazy]] and posted the video on [[YouTube]]. Four months later, [[Universal Music]], the owner of the copyright to the song, ordered YouTube to remove the video under the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]. Lenz notified YouTube immediately that her video was within the scope of fair use, and she demanded that it be restored. YouTube complied after six weeks, rather than the two weeks required by the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]. Lenz then sued Universal Music in California for her legal costs, claiming the music company had acted in bad faith by ordering removal of a video that represented fair use of the song.<ref>{{cite news|first=Bob|last=Egelko|title=Woman can sue over YouTube clip de-posting|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Woman-can-sue-over-YouTube-clip-de-posting-3199389.php|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=August 21, 2008|accessdate=2015-11-16}}</ref> On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that a copyright owner must affirmatively consider whether the complained of conduct constituted fair use before sending a takedown notice under the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], rather than waiting for the alleged infringer to assert fair use. 801 F.3d 1126 (9th Cir. 2015). \"Even if, as Universal urges, fair use is classified as an 'affirmative defense,' we hold\u2014for the purposes of the DMCA\u2014fair use is uniquely situated in copyright law so as to be treated differently than traditional affirmative defenses. We conclude that because 17 U.S.C. \u00a7&nbsp;107 created a type of non-infringing use, fair use is \"authorized by the law\" and a copyright holder must consider the existence of fair use before sending a takedown notification under \u00a7&nbsp;512(c).\"\n\nIn June 2011, Judge [[Philip Pro]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Nevada|District of Nevada]] ruled in ''[[Righthaven v. Hoehn]]'' that the posting of an entire editorial article from the [[Las Vegas Review Journal]] in a comment as part of an online discussion was unarguably fair use. Judge Pro noted that \"Noncommercial, nonprofit use is presumptively fair. ... Hoehn posted the Work as part of an online discussion. ... This purpose is consistent with comment, for which 17 U.S.C. \u00a7&nbsp;107 provides fair use protection. ... It is undisputed that Hoehn posted the entire work in his comment on the Website. ... wholesale copying does not preclude a finding of fair use. ... there is no genuine issue of material fact that Hoehn's use of the Work was fair and summary judgment is appropriate.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dmlp.org/sites/citmedialaw.org/files/2011-06-20-Order%20Granting%20Mot%20to%20Dismiss%20in%20Righthave%20v%20Hoehn%20Order.pdf|title=Righthaven v.

Such insurance protects against errors and omissions made during the copyright clearance of material in the film. Before the ''Documentary Filmmakers' Statement of Best Practices in Fair Use'' was created in 2005, it was nearly impossible to obtain errors and omissions insurance for copyright clearance work that relied in part on fair use. This meant documentarians had either to obtain a license for the material or to cut it from their films. In many cases, it was impossible to license the material because the filmmaker sought to use it in a critical way. Soon after the best practices statement was released, all errors and omissions insurers in the U.S. shifted to begin offering routine fair use coverage.<ref name=Aufderheide>{{cite book|last1=Aufderheide|first1=Patricia|last2=Jaszi|first2=Peter|title=Reclaiming Fair Use: How to Put Balance Back in Copyright|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-226-03228-3}}</ref>\n\n=== Music sampling ===\n{{further|Legal issues surrounding music sampling}}\nBefore 1991, [[sampling (music)|sampling]] in certain genres of music was accepted practice and the copyright considerations were viewed as largely irrelevant.

These fair use cases distinguish between parodies, which use a work in order to poke fun at or comment on the work itself and [[satire]], or comment on something else. Courts have been more willing to grant fair use protections to parodies than to satires, but the ultimate outcome in either circumstance will turn on the application of the four fair use factors.\n\nFor example, when [[Tom Forsythe]] appropriated [[Barbie]] dolls for his photography project \"Food Chain Barbie\" (depicting several copies of the doll naked and disheveled and about to be baked in an oven, blended in a food mixer, and the like), [[Mattel]] lost its copyright infringement lawsuit against him because his work effectively parodies Barbie and the values she represents.<ref name=\"Mattel\">{{cite court|litigants=Mattel Inc v.

Koons]]'', [[Jeff Koons]] tried to justify his appropriation of Art Rogers' photograph \"Puppies\" in his sculpture \"String of Puppies\" with the same parody defense.

This was insufficient to render the use fair.<ref name=\"Rogers\">{{cite court|litigants=Rogers v.

Acuff-Rose Music Inc]]''<ref name=\"510 US 569\" /> the U.S. Supreme Court recognized parody as a potential fair use, even when done for profit. [[Roy Orbison]]'s publisher, [[Acuff-Rose Music]], had sued [[2 Live Crew]] in 1989 for their use of Orbison's \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" in a mocking rap version with altered lyrics. The Supreme Court viewed 2 Live Crew's version as a ridiculing commentary on the earlier work, and ruled that when the parody was itself the product rather than mere advertising, commercial nature did not bar the defense. The ''Campbell'' court also distinguished parodies from [[satire]], which they described as a broader social critique not intrinsically tied to ridicule of a specific work and so not deserving of the same use exceptions as parody because the satirist's ideas are capable of expression without the use of the other particular work.\n\nA number of appellate decisions have recognized that a parody may be a protected fair use, including the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second]] (''[[Leibovitz v. Paramount Pictures Corp.]]''); the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth]] (''Mattel v. Walking Mountain Productions''); and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh]] Circuits (''[[Suntrust Bank v. Houghton Mifflin Co.]]''). In the 2001 ''Suntrust Bank'' case, Suntrust Bank and the [[Margaret Mitchell]] estate unsuccessfully brought suit to halt the publication of ''[[The Wind Done Gone]]'', which reused many of the characters and situations from ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'' but told the events from the point of view of the enslaved people rather than the slaveholders. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh Circuit]], applying ''Campbell'', found that ''The Wind Done Gone'' was fair use and vacated the [[U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia|district court's]] injunction against its publication.\n\nCases in which a satirical use was found to be fair include ''Blanch v. Koons'' and ''Williams v. Columbia Broadcasting Systems''.<ref name=Unbundling />\n\n=== Text and data mining ===\nThe transformative nature of computer based analytical processes such as [[text mining]], [[web mining]] and [[data mining]] has led many to form the view that such uses would be protected under fair use. This view was substantiated by the rulings of Judge [[Denny Chin]] in ''[[Authors Guild, Inc. v. Google, Inc.]]'', a case involving mass digitisation of millions of books from research library collections. As part of the ruling that found the book digitisation project was fair use, the judge stated \"Google Books is also transformative in the sense that it has transformed book text into data for purposes of substantive research, including data mining and text mining in new areas\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rosati|first1=Eleonora|title=A Closer Look at the Google Books Library Project Decision|url=http://ipkitten.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/a-closer-look-at-google-books-library.html|accessdate=November 15, 2014|publisher=The IPKAT|date=November 17, 2013}}</ref><ref name=GoogleVictory>{{cite web|title=Google's Fair Use Victory|url=http://www.lawdownunder.com/google-books-project-covered-fair-use-doctrine/|website=Law Down Under|accessdate=November 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117031600/http://www.lawdownunder.com/google-books-project-covered-fair-use-doctrine/|archive-date=November 17, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nText and data mining was subject to further review in ''[[Authors Guild v.

Some countries have the concept of [[fair dealing]] instead of fair use, while others use different systems of [[limitations and exceptions to copyright]]. Many countries have some reference to an exemption for educational use, though the extent of this exemption varies widely.\n\nSources differ on whether fair use is fully recognized by countries other than the United States. [[American University]]'s ''infojustice.org'' published a compilation of portions of over 40 nations' laws that explicitly mention fair use or fair dealing, and asserts that some of the fair dealing laws, such as Canada's, have evolved (such as through judicial precedents) to be quite close to those of the United States.
