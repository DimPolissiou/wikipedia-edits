First year of factory-installed air conditioning (air conditioning was installed by the dealer before 1968).\n*'''1969''': New grille design, new 302 Windsor V8 engine option.\n*'''1970''': Mid-cycle update with many detail changes including a completely new grille including wraparound front turn signals, exterior trim changes, and new side marker lights. \"Sport Custom\" trim replaces \"Custom Cab\", and \"Ranger XLT\" added as top trim level.\n\n===Argentina===\nA new engine choice to the local market is introduced in that year: the diesel engine, which was a [[Perkins_Engines|Perkins]] 3.3 L (203 cu in) l4 engine with 120&nbsp;hp SAE at 3,000 RPM.\nAlso, another change are the alternator, replacing the dynamo.\n\n===Mexico===\nThe new 335 cu in (5.4 L) V8 engine was introduced as a new engine option, only in medium duty trucks. This engine was designed by Mexican Ford engineers and was relative of the Windsor family and was based in the 351 and 302 ones, with a stronger crankshaft and elongated stroke. The 335 had a Holley 2-barrel carburetor and had an output of 200&nbsp;hp at 4,000 RPM.

With the exceptions of the [[semi-rigid airship|semi-rigid]] ''[[Roma (airship)|Roma]]'' and the [[Goodyear RS-1]], they were non-rigid [[blimp]]s. These airships were intended to perform search and patrol operations in support of coastal fortifications and border patrol. During the 1920s, the Army operated many more blimps than the [[U.S. Navy]]. They were also used because they were not seen as \"threats\".\n\n==History==\nThe history of American military aviation began during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], when the [[Union Army]] operated observation balloons.<ref>Hoeling, Mary. ''Thaddeus Lowe America's One-Man Air Corps'', New York. Julian Messner, Inc., 1937, p. 110</ref>  Later, a balloon was used by the US Army in [[Cuba]] during the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. These were ad-hoc and not part of an established branch of the Army. The use of [[observation balloon]]s continued after the end of [[World War I]]. The last use of observation balloons by the Army was during maneuvers conducted in Louisiana during September 1941.<ref>Shock, James R., U.S. Army Airships, 1908-1942, 2002, Atlantis Productions, Edgewater Florida, {{ISBN|0-9639743-9-4}}, page 168</ref> Balloons must either be tethered, or go where they are blown by the wind, but towards the end of the nineteenth century powered [[airship]]s, capable of being directed at the will of the pilot, were developed.\n\nIn 1908, the US Army experimented with its first powered aircraft, the [[Signal Corps Dirigible No. 1|SC-1]], or Signal Corps number 1.<ref>Jane, Fred T. ''Jane's All the World's Airships 1909'', Reprinted New York. Arco Publishing Company, Inc, 1969, p. 305. Library of Congress No. 69-14964</ref> It was a small [[non-rigid airship]] with a top speed under 20&nbsp;mph and an endurance of just over 2 hours. Following tests at [[Fort Myer]], the SC-1 was sent to [[Fort Omaha]], Nebraska, where the Signal Corps School was located. While the SC-1 was being tested at Fort Myer, the Signal Corps had built an [[airship hangar]] and a plant to produce hydrogen gas at [[Fort Omaha]]. Fort Omaha became, for a while, the first permanent military airfield in the United States. The SC-1 was scrapped in 1912, and the base at Fort Omaha closed in 1913.<ref>Shock, James R.

During World War I the Joint Airship Board assigned the US Navy the role of acquiring and developing rigid airships. This did not dissuade the Army from pursuing its own course. Colonel William Hensley flew as an observer on the return voyage of the British [[R33-class airship#R34|R34]] airship from [[Long Island, New York]] to the UK in the summer of 1919. Hensley was then sent on a confidential mission to contact the [[Zeppelin Luftschiffbau|Zeppelin Company]] to attempt to purchase the remaining undelivered wartime Zeppelin, the [[Dixmude (airship)|L&nbsp;72]]. The scheme probably originated with General [[Billy Mitchell (general)|\"Billy\" Mitchell]].<ref>Robinson 1973, p.186</ref>  Hensley visited the Zeppelin plant, inspected L&nbsp;72 and flew on the [[Zeppelin LZ 120 Bodensee|''Bodensee'']], a small passenger Zeppelin. The [[Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control|Inter-Allied Commission of Control]] ordered that L&nbsp;72 should be turned over to France. In November 1919 the US Army contracted with the Zeppelin corporation for construction of the [[USS Los Angeles (ZR-3)|LZ&nbsp;125]], which was to be larger than the [[R38 class airship]] which the USN had contracted to purchase from Britain as the ZR-2. This attempt to avoid the conditions set by the Joint Airship Board would have encountered legal problems as the US Senate refused to ratify the Allied Peace Treaty with Germany until October 1921.<ref>Schock, James R.

They were used for training, coastal patrol, and experimentation in the early 1920s. The Army purchased three British [[SST class blimp]]s from the British, which were operated out of [[Biggs Field]], Fort Bliss, and [[Brooks City-Base|Brooks Field]], both in Texas for purposes of border patrol between 1920 and 1923.<ref>Shock, James R.

The ''Roma'' was the largest airship ever operated by the Army. It was based at Langley Field. With a cruising speed of 50&nbsp;mph and a range of 7,000 miles, the ''Roma'' allowed the Army to consider transcontinental deployments, missions to [[Panama]], the fast transport of cargo and passengers, discovering threatening fleets far out at sea. The ''Roma'' was destroyed by fire in an accident near [[Norfolk, Virginia]] on 21 February 1922. The Roma tragedy led [[United States Congress|Congress]] to decree that all US airship operations would in the future use helium instead of hydrogen as the [[lifting gas]].<ref>Shock, James R.

While both the Germans and British had experimented with releasing fighters from rigid airships, it was the US Army that first flew an airplane from the ground and 'hooked' on to a trapeze suspended from an airship. Many tests involving a [[Verville-Sperry M-1 Messenger|Sperry Messenger airplane]] and [[TC-3]], a TC class blimp, were made in the mid-1920s. Eventually, the technology was assumed by the US Navy on the \"[[flying aircraft carrier]]s\", [[USS Akron (ZRS-4)]] and [[USS Macon (ZRS-5)]].<ref>Smith, Richard K.

In 1932, the Army contracted for two blimps significantly more capable than any in service, these were the TC-13 and TC-14. When Army Airship operations were terminated in 1937, a number of Army blimps were transferred to the USN, but only two, the  TC-13 and 14 were ever operated by the Navy.<ref>Shock, James R.

By 1935 Congress was trying to eliminate funding for the Army airships, and Chief of the Air Corps Major General [[Benjamin Foulois]], who himself had been a pilot of the SC-1, was recommending the program be terminated. In mid-1937, the Army's airship program was officially ended.\n\n===World War II===\nAs Congress refused to authorize expenditures for Army airships but did allow funding of observation balloons, the army resurrected the \"Motorized Observation Balloon\" concept abandoned in the 1920s.<ref>Shock, James R.

With the exceptions of the [[semi-rigid airship|semi-rigid]] ''[[Roma (airship)|Roma]]'' and the [[Goodyear RS-1]], they were non-rigid [[blimp]]s. These airships were intended to perform search and patrol operations in support of coastal fortifications and border patrol. During the 1920s, the Army operated many more blimps than the [[U.S. Navy]]. They were also used because they were not seen as \"threats\".\n\n==History==\nThe history of American military aviation began during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], when the [[Union Army]] operated observation balloons.<ref>Hoeling, Mary. ''Thaddeus Lowe America's One-Man Air Corps'', New York. Julian Messner, Inc., 1937, p. 110</ref>  Later, a balloon was used by the US Army in [[Cuba]] during the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. These were ad-hoc and not part of an established branch of the Army. The use of [[observation balloon]]s continued after the end of [[World War I]]. The last use of observation balloons by the Army was during maneuvers conducted in Louisiana during September 1941.<ref>Shock, James R., U.S. Army Airships, 1908-1942, 2002, Atlantis Productions, Edgewater Florida, {{ISBN|0-9639743-9-4}}, page 168</ref> Balloons must either be tethered, or go where they are blown by the wind, but towards the end of the nineteenth century powered [[airship]]s, capable of being directed at the will of the pilot, were developed.\n\nIn 1908, the US Army experimented with its first powered aircraft, the [[Signal Corps Dirigible No. 1|SC-1]], or Signal Corps number 1.<ref>Jane, Fred T. ''Jane's All the World's Airships 1909'', Reprinted New York. Arco Publishing Company, Inc, 1969, p. 305. Library of Congress No. 69-14964</ref> It was a small [[non-rigid airship]] with a top speed under 20&nbsp;mph and an endurance of just over 2 hours. Following tests at [[Fort Myer]], the SC-1 was sent to [[Fort Omaha]], Nebraska, where the Signal Corps School was located. While the SC-1 was being tested at Fort Myer, the Signal Corps had built an [[airship hangar]] and a plant to produce hydrogen gas at [[Fort Omaha]]. Fort Omaha became, for a while, the first permanent military airfield in the United States. The SC-1 was scrapped in 1912, and the base at Fort Omaha closed in 1913.<ref>Shock, James R.

Atlantis Productions, 2002, p. 20. {{ISBN|0-9639743-9-4}}</ref>\n\n===World War I===\nThe US Army operated French observation balloons during [[World War I]], but did not operate another airship until after the war ended. During World War I the Joint Airship Board assigned the US Navy the role of acquiring and developing rigid airships. This did not dissuade the Army from pursuing its own course. Colonel William Hensley flew as an observer on the return voyage of the British [[R33-class airship#R34|R34]] airship from [[Long Island, New York]] to the UK in the summer of 1919. Hensley was then sent on a confidential mission to contact the [[Zeppelin Luftschiffbau|Zeppelin Company]] to attempt to purchase the remaining undelivered wartime Zeppelin, the [[Dixmude (airship)|L&nbsp;72]]. The scheme probably originated with General [[Billy Mitchell (general)|\"Billy\" Mitchell]].<ref>Robinson 1973, p.186</ref>  Hensley visited the Zeppelin plant, inspected L&nbsp;72 and flew on the [[Zeppelin LZ 120 Bodensee|''Bodensee'']], a small passenger Zeppelin. The [[Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control|Inter-Allied Commission of Control]] ordered that L&nbsp;72 should be turned over to France. In November 1919 the US Army contracted with the Zeppelin corporation for construction of the [[USS Los Angeles (ZR-3)|LZ&nbsp;125]], which was to be larger than the [[R38 class airship]] which the USN had contracted to purchase from Britain as the ZR-2. This attempt to avoid the conditions set by the Joint Airship Board would have encountered legal problems as the US Senate refused to ratify the Allied Peace Treaty with Germany until October 1921.<ref>Schock, James R.

Plans were made for operating airships from both [[Fort Bliss]] and Brooks Field, in Texas<ref>Bilstein, Roger and Miller, Jay. ''Aviation in Texas'', Austin, Texas. Texas Monthly Press, Inc., 1985, p. 54. {{ISBN|978-0932012951}}</ref> and [[Langley Field]], Virginia. The first blimp operated by the Army was the A-4, which was operated primarily from Langley until transferred to the new Balloon and Airship School at [[Fort Scott, Illinois|Fort Scott]], Illinois. The Army operated several Navy [[C class blimp]]s and [[D class blimp]]s during the immediate post-World War I era.<ref>Shock, James R. ''US Army Airships 1908-1942'', Edgewater Florida. Atlantis Productions, 2002, p. 38. {{ISBN|0-9639743-9-4}}</ref>\n\nArmy blimps participated in the \"[[Billy Mitchell (general)|Mitchell]]\" bombing test in 1921. They were used for training, coastal patrol, and experimentation in the early 1920s. The Army purchased three British [[SST class blimp]]s from the British, which were operated out of [[Biggs Field]], Fort Bliss, and [[Brooks City-Base|Brooks Field]], both in Texas for purposes of border patrol between 1920 and 1923.<ref>Shock, James R.

The ''Roma'' was the largest airship ever operated by the Army. It was based at Langley Field. With a cruising speed of 50&nbsp;mph and a range of 7,000 miles, the ''Roma'' allowed the Army to consider transcontinental deployments, missions to [[Panama]], the fast transport of cargo and passengers, discovering threatening fleets far out at sea. The ''Roma'' was destroyed by fire in an accident near [[Norfolk, Virginia]] on 21 February 1922. The Roma tragedy led [[United States Congress|Congress]] to decree that all US airship operations would in the future use helium instead of hydrogen as the [[lifting gas]].<ref>Shock, James R.

While both the Germans and British had experimented with releasing fighters from rigid airships, it was the US Army which first flew an airplane from the ground and 'hooked' on to a trapeze suspended from an airship. Many tests involving a [[Verville-Sperry M-1 Messenger|Sperry Messenger airplane]] and [[TC-3]], a TC class blimp, were made in the mid-1920s. Eventually the technology was assumed by the US Navy on the \"[[flying aircraft carrier]]s\", [[USS Akron (ZRS-4)]] and [[USS Macon (ZRS-5)]].<ref>Smith, Richard K.

In 1932, the Army contracted for two blimps significantly more capable than any in service, these were the TC-13 and TC-14. When Army Airship operations were terminated in 1937, a number of Army blimps were transferred to the USN, but only two, the  TC-13 and 14 were ever operated by the Navy.<ref>Shock, James R.

By 1935 Congress was trying to eliminate funding for the Army airships, and Chief of the Air Corps Major General [[Benjamin Foulois]], who himself had been a pilot of the SC-1, was recommending the program be terminated. In mid-1937, the Army's airship program was officially ended.\n\n===World War II===\nAs Congress refused to authorize expenditures for Army airships but did allow funding of observation balloons, the army resurrected the \"Motorized Observation Balloon\" concept abandoned in the 1920s.<ref>Shock, James R.

He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008\u201309 he helped Barcelona achieve the first [[Treble (association football)|treble]] in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first [[2009 Ballon d'Or|Ballon d'Or]]. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning three consecutive Ballons d'Or, including an unprecedented fourth. During the [[2011\u201312 FC Barcelona season|2011\u201312 season]], he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as [[List of FC Barcelona records and statistics#Top goalscorers|Barcelona's all-time top scorer]]. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] (his perceived [[Messi\u2013Ronaldo rivalry|career rival]]), before regaining his best form during the [[2014\u201315 FC Barcelona season|2014\u201315 campaign]], becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in [[2015 FIFA Ballon d'Or|2015]]. Messi assumed the captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and in 2019 he secured a record [[2019 Ballon d'Or|sixth Ballon d'Or]].\n\nAn Argentine international, Messi is his country's [[Argentina national football team#Top goalscorers|all-time leading goalscorer]].

His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbler]] drew comparisons with his compatriot [[Diego Maradona]], who described Messi as his [[New Maradona|successor]]. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a [[FIFA World Cup]] during the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 edition]], and reached the final of the [[2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's [[Captain (association football)|captain]] from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], for which he won the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Ball|Golden Ball]], and the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica|2015]] and [[Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario|2016 Copas Am\u00e9rica]]. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], and a third-place finish at the [[2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica]].\n\nOne of the most famous athletes in the world, Messi has been sponsored by sportswear company [[Adidas]] since 2006 and has established himself as their leading brand endorser.

Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent ''La Albiceleste'' since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the [[Argentine Football Association]] organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in [[FIFA]].

He was subsequently included in the squad for the [[2005 South American U-20 Championship|South American Youth Championship]], held in Colombia in February 2005. As he lacked the stamina of his teammates, the result of his former growth hormone deficiency, he was used as a substitute in six of the nine games.

After helping the team defeat Egypt and Germany to progress past the group stage, Messi proved decisive in the knockout phase as he scored their equaliser against Colombia, provided a goal and an assist against title favourites Spain, and scored their opening goal against reigning champions Brazil. Ahead of the final, he was awarded the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup#Awards|Golden Ball]] as the best player of the tournament.

A prolific goalscorer and a creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for [[List of La Liga top scorers#All-time top scorers|most goals in La Liga]] (438), [[List of La Liga top scorers#Top scorers by season|a La Liga]] and European league season (50), [[List of La Liga hat-tricks|most hat-tricks in La Liga]] (36) and the [[List of UEFA Champions League hat-tricks|UEFA Champions League]] (8), and most [[Assist (football)|assists]] in La Liga (181) and the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] (12). He has scored over [[List of footballers with 500 or more goals|700 senior career goals]] for club and country.\n\nBorn and raised in central Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at age 13, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008\u201309 he helped Barcelona achieve the first [[Treble (association football)|treble]] in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first [[2009 Ballon d'Or|Ballon d'Or]]. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning three consecutive Ballons d'Or, including an unprecedented fourth. During the [[2011\u201312 FC Barcelona season|2011\u201312 season]], he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as [[List of FC Barcelona records and statistics#Top goalscorers|Barcelona's all-time top scorer]]. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] (his perceived [[Messi\u2013Ronaldo rivalry|career rival]]), before regaining his best form during the [[2014\u201315 FC Barcelona season|2014\u201315 campaign]], becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in [[2015 FIFA Ballon d'Or|2015]]. Messi assumed the captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and in 2019 he secured a record [[2019 Ballon d'Or|sixth Ballon d'Or]].\n\nAn Argentine international, Messi is his country's [[Argentina national football team#Top goalscorers|all-time leading goalscorer]]. At youth level, he won the [[2005 FIFA World Youth Championship]], finishing the tournament with both the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup#Awards|Golden Ball and Golden Shoe]], and an [[Olympic medal|Olympic gold medal]] at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics]]. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbler]] drew comparisons with his compatriot [[Diego Maradona]], who described Messi as his [[New Maradona|successor]]. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a [[FIFA World Cup]] during the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 edition]], and reached the final of the [[2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's [[Captain (association football)|captain]] from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], for which he won the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Ball|Golden Ball]], and the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica|2015]] and [[Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario|2016 Copas Am\u00e9rica]]. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], and a third-place finish at the [[2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica]].\n\nOne of the most famous athletes in the world, Messi has been sponsored by sportswear company [[Adidas]] since 2006 and has established himself as their leading brand endorser. According to ''[[France Football]]'', he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the [[Forbes' list of the world's highest-paid athletes|world's highest-paid athlete]] by ''[[Forbes]]'' in 2019. Messi was among [[Time 100|''Time'']]'s [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] in 2011 and 2012.

Messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent ''La Albiceleste'' since childhood. To further prevent Spain from taking him, the [[Argentine Football Association]] organised two under-20 friendlies in June 2004, against Paraguay and Uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an Argentina player in [[FIFA]].

He was subsequently included in the squad for the [[2005 South American U-20 Championship|South American Youth Championship]], held in Colombia in February 2005. As he lacked the stamina of his teammates, the result of his former growth hormone deficiency, he was used as a substitute in six of the nine games.

After helping the team defeat Egypt and Germany to progress past the group stage, Messi proved decisive in the knockout phase as he scored their equaliser against Colombia, provided a goal and an assist against title favourites Spain, and scored their opening goal against reigning champions Brazil. Ahead of the final, he was awarded the [[FIFA U-20 World Cup#Awards|Golden Ball]] as the best player of the tournament.

His professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, Jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, Rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. His mother and other brother, Mat\u00edas, manage his charitable organisation, the Leo Messi Foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in Rosario.{{sfn|Balagu\u00e9|2013|pp=31, 143, 570}}\n\nSince leaving for Spain at age 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of \"The Machine of '87\" at Newell's Old Boys. He currently lives in [[Castelldefels]], a village near Barcelona. Although considered a [[List of one-club men in association football|one-club man]], he has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell's embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son.<ref name=\"Here and Gone\" />{{sfn|Balagu\u00e9|2013|pp=576\u2013577}}<ref>{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Wright |title=After Just 72 Hours on the Planet, Thiago Messi Signs for Newell's Old Boys |publisher=ESPN FC |date=5 November 2012 |url=http://www.espnfc.com/blog/the-toe-poke/65/post/1850358/after-just-72-hours-on-the-planet-thiago-messi-signs-for-newells-old-boys |accessdate=25 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Philanthropy ===\nThroughout his career, Messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood.

A sequel to ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985), it is the third installment in the [[Rambo (franchise)|''Rambo'' franchise]], followed by ''[[Rambo (2008 film)|Rambo]]''. It was the last film to feature [[Richard Crenna]] as [[Sam Trautman|Colonel Sam Trautman]] before his death in 2003.\n\nThe film depicts fictional events during the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]]. In the film, Rambo sets out on a dangerous journey to [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] in order to rescue his former military commander and his longtime best friend Colonel Trautman from the hands of an extremely powerful and ruthless [[Soviet Army]] colonel who is bent on killing both Trautman and Rambo, as he helps lead the Soviet armed forces and their mission: Conquering Afghanistan.\n\n''Rambo III'' was released worldwide on May 25, 1988, and grossed $189 million at the box office. With a production budget of between $58 and $63 million, ''Rambo III'' was the most expensive film ever made at the time.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Plot summaries are usually between 400-700 words. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. -->\nThree years [[Rambo: First Blood Part II|after the events in Vietnam]], [[Colonel Sam Trautman]] visits his old friend and ally [[John Rambo]] in Thailand. He explains that he is putting together a mercenary team for a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-sponsored mission to supply the [[Mujahideen]] and other tribes as they try to repel the Soviet Army in [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]]. Despite being shown photos of civilians suffering at the hands of the Soviet military, Rambo refuses to join, as he is tired of fighting. Trautman proceeds anyway and is ambushed by enemy forces near the border, resulting in all of his men being killed. Trautman is captured and sent to a large mountain base to be interrogated by Soviet Colonel Zaysen and his henchman Sergeant Kourov.\n\nEmbassy official [[Robert Griggs]] informs Rambo of Col. Trautman's capture but refuses to approve a rescue mission for fear of drawing the United States into the war. Aware that Trautman will die otherwise, Rambo gets permission to undertake a solo rescue on the condition that he will be disavowed in the event of capture or death. Rambo immediately flies to [[Peshawar]], Pakistan, where he intends to convince arms dealer Mousa Ghani to bring him to [[Khost]], the town closest to the Soviet base where Trautman is held captive.\n\nThe [[Mujahideen]] in the village, led by chieftain Masoud, hesitate to help Rambo free Trautman. Meanwhile, a Soviet informant in Ghani's employ informs the Soviets, who send two attack helicopters to destroy the village. Though Rambo manages to destroy one of them with a turret, the rebels refuse to aid him any further. Aided only by Mousa and a young boy named Hamid, Rambo attacks the base and inflicts significant damage before being forced to retreat. Hamid, as well as Rambo, are wounded during the battle and Rambo sends him and Mousa away before resuming his infiltration.\n\nSkillfully evading base security, Rambo reaches Trautman just as he is about to be tortured with a [[flamethrower]]. He and Trautman rescue several other prisoners and hijack a [[Mil Mi-24|Hind]] [[Gunship|gunship helicopter]] to escape the base. The helicopter is damaged during takeoff and quickly crashes, forcing the escapees to flee across the sand on foot. An [[attack helicopter]] pursues Rambo and Trautman to a nearby cave, where Rambo destroys it with an explosive arrow. A furious Zaysen sends [[Spetsnaz]] commandos under Kourov to kill them, but they are quickly routed and killed.

But before the duo are overwhelmed, Masoud's Mujahideen forces attack the Soviets in a surprise cavalry charge. Despite being wounded, Rambo takes control of a tank and uses it to attack Zaysen's Hind gunship in a head-on battle with both vehicles firing high-calibre machine gun rounds, Rambo firing the tank's main gun and Zaysen unleashing volleys of the Hind's high explosive rockets and missiles. The final charge sees the two vehicles collide, but Rambo survives after firing the tank's main gun after colliding with Zaysen's Hind. At the end of the battle, Rambo and Trautman say goodbye to the Mujahideen and leave Afghanistan.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Rambo characters}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[John Rambo|John J.

A sequel to ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985), it is the third installment in the [[Rambo (franchise)|''Rambo'' franchise]], followed by ''[[Rambo (2008 film)|Rambo]]''. It was the last film to feature [[Richard Crenna]] as [[Sam Trautman|Colonel Sam Trautman]] before his death in 2003.\n\nThe film depicts fictional events during the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]]. In the film, Rambo sets out on a dangerous journey to [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] in order to rescue his former military commander and his longtime best friend Colonel Trautman from the hands of an extremely powerful and ruthless [[Soviet Army]] colonel who is bent on killing both Trautman and Rambo, as he helps lead the Soviet armed forces and their mission: Conquering Afghanistan.\n\n''Rambo III'' was released worldwide on May 25, 1988, and grossed $189 million at the box office. With a production budget of between $58 and $63 million, ''Rambo III'' was the most expensive film ever made at the time.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Plot summaries are usually between 400-700 words. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. -->\nThree years [[Rambo: First Blood Part II|after the events in Vietnam]], [[Colonel Sam Trautman]] visits his old friend and ally [[John Rambo]] in Thailand. He explains that he is putting together a mercenary team for a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-sponsored mission to supply the [[Mujahideen]] and other tribes as they try to repel the Soviet Army in [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]]. Despite being shown photos of civilians suffering at the hands of the Soviet military, Rambo refuses to join, as he is tired of fighting. Trautman proceeds anyway and is ambushed by enemy forces near the border, resulting in all of his men being killed. Trautman is captured and sent to a large mountain base to be interrogated by Soviet Colonel Zaysen and his henchman Sergeant Kourov.\n\nEmbassy official [[Robert Griggs]] informs Rambo of Col. Trautman's capture but refuses to approve a rescue mission for fear of drawing the United States into the war. Aware that Trautman will die otherwise, Rambo gets permission to undertake a solo rescue on the condition that he will be disavowed in the event of capture or death. Rambo immediately flies to [[Peshawar]], Pakistan, where he intends to convince arms dealer Mousa Ghani to bring him to [[Khost]], the town closest to the Soviet base where Trautman is held captive.\n\nThe [[Mujahideen]] in the village, led by chieftain Masoud, hesitate to help Rambo free Trautman. Meanwhile, a Soviet informant in Ghani's employ informs the Soviets, who send two attack helicopters to destroy the village. Though Rambo manages to destroy one of them with a turret, the rebels refuse to aid him any further. Aided only by Mousa and a young boy named Hamid, Rambo attacks the base and inflicts significant damage before being forced to retreat. Hamid, as well as Rambo, are wounded during the battle and Rambo sends him and Mousa away before resuming his infiltration.\n\nSkillfully evading base security, Rambo reaches Trautman just as he is about to be tortured with a [[flamethrower]]. He and Trautman rescue several other prisoners and hijack a [[Mil Mi-24|Hind]] [[Gunship|gunship helicopter]] to escape the base. The helicopter is damaged during takeoff and quickly crashes, forcing the escapees to flee across the sand on foot. An [[attack helicopter]] pursues Rambo and Trautman to a nearby cave, where Rambo destroys it with an explosive arrow. A furious Zaysen sends [[Spetsnaz]] commandos under Kourov to kill them, but they are quickly routed and killed. An injured Kourov attacks Rambo with his bare hands, but is overcome and killed.\n\nAs Rambo and Trautman make their way to the [[Durand Line|Pakistani border]], Zaysen and his forces surround them. But before the duo are overwhelmed, Masoud's Mujahideen forces attack the Soviets in a surprise cavalry charge. Despite being wounded, Rambo takes control of a tank and uses it to attack Zaysen's Hind gunship in a head-on battle with both vehicles firing high-calibre machine gun rounds, Rambo firing the tank's main gun and Zaysen unleashing volleys of the Hind's high explosive rockets and missiles. The final charge sees the two vehicles collide, but Rambo survives after firing the tank's main gun after colliding with Zaysen's Hind. At the end of the battle, Rambo and Trautman say goodbye to the Mujahideen and leave Afghanistan.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Rambo characters}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[John Rambo|John J.

As of 2010, the municipal area of Ipoh has a population of 657,892.<ref name=\"census 2010\">{{cite web|title=Population Distribution by Local Authority Areas and Mukims, 2010|url=http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/population/04Jadual_PBT_negeri/PBT_Perak.pdf|publisher=Department of Statistics Malaysia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227011347/http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/population/04Jadual_PBT_negeri/PBT_Perak.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2012 }}</ref> It ranks as the seventh most [[List of urban areas in Malaysia by population|populous urban centre]] in Malaysia (2010).<ref name=\"census 2010\" />\n\nThe following is based on Department of Statistics Malaysia 2010 census.<ref name=\"census 2010\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=3| Ethnic groups in Ipoh, 2010\n|-\n!

The sap of this plant is poisonous and was used by [[Orang Asli]] ([[indigenous peoples]] in [[Malay language|Malay]]) to coat the tips of the darts of their blowpipes for hunting.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Sultan Azlan Shah Airport.JPG|thumb|[[Sultan Azlan Shah Airport]]]]\n* Trunk roads: The old interstate [[Malaysia Federal Route 1|Route]] {{JKR|1}} connects Ipoh with other major towns and cities in peninsular Malaysia, for example to [[Alor Setar]], [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]] and [[Penang]] to the north and [[Tapah]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Seremban]] and even [[Johor Bahru]] in the south. Motorists from the east coast can use [[Malaysia Federal Route 4|highway]] {{JKR|4}} (from [[Gerik]]) in northern Perak or {{JKR|185}} (from [[Cameron Highlands]]).\n* Highway: The new [[North\u2013South Expressway (Malaysia)|North\u2013South Expressway]] {{MES-E|1}} is a faster and more efficient alternative to Route 1. However, certain towns like [[Kampar, Perak|Kampar]] can only be accessible via Route 1.\n* Train: [[Ipoh railway station|Ipoh's railway station]] is operated by [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu]] (KTM) and is in the Old Town (however, it does not have intra-city travel like in [[Kuala Lumpur]]). The railway only connects Ipoh with neighbouring towns and cities. The station is a stately building, referred to by locals as the 'Taj Mahal' of Ipoh. [[KTM Intercity]] began the Shuttle Train Service between [[Kuala Lumpur]] and Ipoh from 1 December 2008 while the modern [[Electric Train System]] (ETS) shuttle began from 12 August 2010 with average {{Convert|145|km/h|abbr=on}} speed, plying Ipoh-Seremban route, cut the travelling distance between Ipoh and [[Kuala Lumpur]] into 120&nbsp;minutes. There are 10 dedicated shuttle train services between these two cities daily which begins at 5&nbsp;am from both the stations. Travel time between the cities was expected to be reduced from three hours to two hours and fifteen minutes when the new set of EMU trains arrived in mid-2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cockatoo.com/malaysia/e-06pera/em-per27.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130119155613/http://www.cockatoo.com/malaysia/e-06pera/em-per27.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 January 2013 |title=Malaysia / Perak / The Ipoh Railway Station |publisher=Cockatoo.com |date=14 November 2011 |accessdate=10 December 2013 }}</ref>\n* Bus: The inter-city bus terminal is located at [[Amanjaya Integrated Bus Terminal]] in [[Bandar Meru Raya]], just north of the city.\n* Air:  the [[Sultan Azlan Shah Airport]] is the only airport in Ipoh. It is near [[Gunung Rapat]]. Domestic flights and international ones are available. [[Scoot]] and [[AirAsia]] provides daily flights out of Ipoh to [[Singapore]] [[Changi Airport]] while [[Batik Air Malaysia]] provides daily flights to [[Senai International Airport|Johor Bahru]].\nThere are also planned flights to Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand and China with talks of a new airport soon.\n\n==Education==\n{{Main|List of schools in Perak}}\n\nThis is a list of schools in Ipoh, Perak.\n*Sekolah Izzuddin Shah \n*[[Sekolah Tuanku Abdul Rahman]] \n*Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Tanjung Rambutan\n*Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Seri Puteri\n*Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan(T)ST.Philomena Convent, Ipoh\n*Sekolah Kebangsaan Dato Panglima'Kinta, Ipoh\n*Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (C) Yuk Choy, Ipoh\n*SMJK Yuk Choy, Ipoh\n*Tarcisian Convent School, Ipoh (TCS)\n*Anderson School, Ipoh\n*Anglo-Chinese School, Ipoh\n*[[St. Michael's Institution]], Ipoh\n*SMK Jalan Tasek, Ipoh \n*Methodist Girls Secondary School (MGS), Ipoh\n*Perak Girls Secondary School (PGS), Ipoh\n*[[SMK Main Convent]], Ipoh\n*Wesley Methodist School, Ipoh\n*Ipoh International School (Private)\n*Fairview International School, Ipoh\n*Perak Yuk Choy High School (Private) \n*Poi Lam High School (Private) \u6021\u4fdd\u57f9\u5357\u72ec\u7acb\u4e2d\u5b66 \n*Shen Jai High School, Ipoh \u6021\u4fdd\u6df1\u658b\u4e2d\u5b66\n*Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (TAMIL) Kerajaan, Sungai Pari, Ipoh\n*Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (TAMIL) Gunung Rapat, Ipoh\n*Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (TAMIL) Perak Sangeetha Sabha, Ipoh\n*SMK Rapat Setia, Ipoh\n*SMK Jalan Pasir Puteh, Ipoh\n*Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (C) Poi Lam, Ipoh\n*SMK Seri Keledang, Ipoh\n*SMK Menglembu, Ipoh\n*SMJK Poi Lam, Ipoh\n*Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (C) Sam Tet, Ipoh ({{zh|c=\u6021\u4fdd\u4e09\u5fb7\u5c0f\u5b66}})\n*[[SMJK Sam Tet]], Ipoh ({{zh|c=\u6021\u4fdd\u4e09\u5fb7\u4e2d\u5b66}})\n*SMK Dato Ahmad Said\n*Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan Ave Maria Convent, Ipoh ({{zh|c=\u6021\u4fdd\u5723\u6bcd\u739b\u5229\u4e9a\u5c0f\u5b66}})\n*SMJK Ave Maria Convent, Ipoh ({{zh|c=\u6021\u4fdd\u5723\u6bcd\u739b\u5229\u4e9a\u56fd\u6c11\u578b\u4e2d\u5b66}})\n*Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (C) Gunung Rapat, Ipoh\n*Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (C) Wan Hwa (1)\n*Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (C) Wan Hwa (2)\n*Sekolah Kebangsaan (ACS), Ipoh\n*Sekolah Kebangsaan (P) Methodist, Ipoh\n*Sekolah Kebangsaan Haji Mahmud Chemor, Ipoh\n*Sekolah Kebangsaan Kuala Pari, Ipoh\n*Sekolah Kebangsaan Jalan Pegoh\n*Sekolah Kebangsaan Jelapang\n*Sekolah Kebangsaan Marian Convent,Ipoh\n*Sekolah Kebangsaan Raja Ekram, Ipoh\n*SMK Raja Perempuan, Ipoh (RPS) Royal Princess School \"Cluster School\"\n*SRK Raja Perempuan, Ipoh (RPS) \n*Sekolah Kebangsaan Seri Ampang, Ipoh\n*Sekolah Kebangsaan St. Michael's Institution (1), Ipoh\n*Sekolah Kebangsaan St. Michael's Institution (2), Ipoh\n*Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (C) Chung Shan\n\n== Theme Parks ==\nThere are several theme parks in Ipoh, including the Sunway Lost World of Tambun <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sunwaylostworldoftambun.com/|title=Lost World of Tambun Ipoh|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> and Movies Animated Park Studios (MAPS).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mapsperak.com/|title=Movies Animation Park, Ipoh Official Website|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207000455/http://www.mapsperak.com/|archive-date=7 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\nFilm and Television:\n* [[Angie Cheong]]\n* [[Mimi Chu]]\n* [[Iqram Dinzly]]\n* [[Mamat Khalid]]\n* [[Peter Pek]]\n* [[Afdlin Shauki]]\n* [[Patrick Teoh]]\n* [[Michelle Yeoh]]\nMusic:\n* [[Guang Liang|Michael Wong]]\n* [[Jamal Abdillah]]\n* [[Shila Amzah]]\n* [[Ning Baizura]]\n* [[Francissca Peter]]\n* [[:ms:Sophia Liana|Sophia Liana]]\n* Sam Chin Neng of [[Fuying & Sam]]\nSports: (Badminton):\n* [[Koo Kien Keat]]\n* [[Choong Tan Fook]]\n* [[Lee Wan Wah]]\n* [[Cheah Soon Kit]]\n* [[Wong Pei Tty]]\n* [[Wong Mew Choo]]\nSports ([[Association football|Football]]):\n* [[Nazirul Naim]]\n* [[Chan Kok Heng]]\n* [[Muhamad Khalid Jamlus]]\nSports (Others):\n* [[Tony Underwood]] (Rugby)\n* [[Nur Suryani Mohd Taibi]] (Sports shooting)\n* [[Leong Mun Yee]] (Diving)\nBusiness:\n* [[David Ho Sue San]] of [[Hovid Berhad]] & Carotech Berhad,\n* [[Lee Loy Seng]] (founder of Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad),\n* Dr. [[Wong Jeh Shyan]] CEO of CommerceNet Singapore Limited,\n* [[Koon Yew Yin]] Founder of [[IJM Corporation Bhd]] and [[Gamuda Berhad]]\nPolitics:\n* [[Yeoh Ghim Seng]]\n* [[Yeoh Eng-kiong|Dr Yeoh Eng Kiong]]\n* [[S.

The sap of this plant is poisonous and was used by [[Orang Asli]] ([[indigenous peoples]] in [[Malay language|Malay]]) to coat the tips of the darts of their blowpipes for hunting.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Sultan Azlan Shah Airport.JPG|thumb|[[Sultan Azlan Shah Airport]]]]\n* Trunk roads: The old interstate [[Malaysia Federal Route 1|Route]] {{JKR|1}} connects Ipoh with other major towns and cities in peninsular Malaysia, for example to [[Alor Setar]], [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]] and [[Penang]] to the north and [[Tapah]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Seremban]] and even [[Johor Bahru]] in the south. Motorists from the east coast can use [[Malaysia Federal Route 4|highway]] {{JKR|4}} (from [[Gerik]]) in northern Perak or {{JKR|185}} (from [[Cameron Highlands]]).\n* Highway: The new [[North\u2013South Expressway (Malaysia)|North\u2013South Expressway]] {{MES-E|1}} is a faster and more efficient alternative to Route 1. However, certain towns like [[Kampar, Perak|Kampar]] can only be accessible via Route 1.\n* Train: [[Ipoh railway station|Ipoh's railway station]] is operated by [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu]] (KTM) and is in the Old Town (however, it does not have intra-city travel like in [[Kuala Lumpur]]). The railway only connects Ipoh with neighbouring towns and cities. The station is a stately building, referred to by locals as the 'Taj Mahal' of Ipoh. [[KTM Intercity]] began the Shuttle Train Service between [[Kuala Lumpur]] and Ipoh from 1 December 2008 while the modern [[Electric Train System]] (ETS) shuttle began from 12 August 2010 with average {{Convert|145|km/h|abbr=on}} speed, plying Ipoh-Seremban route, cut the travelling distance between Ipoh and [[Kuala Lumpur]] into 120&nbsp;minutes. There are 10 dedicated shuttle train services between these two cities daily which begins at 5&nbsp;am from both the stations. Travel time between the cities was expected to be reduced from three hours to two hours and fifteen minutes when the new set of EMU trains arrived in mid-2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cockatoo.com/malaysia/e-06pera/em-per27.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130119155613/http://www.cockatoo.com/malaysia/e-06pera/em-per27.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 January 2013 |title=Malaysia / Perak / The Ipoh Railway Station |publisher=Cockatoo.com |date=14 November 2011 |accessdate=10 December 2013 }}</ref>\n* Bus: The inter-city bus terminal is located at [[Amanjaya Integrated Bus Terminal]] in [[Bandar Meru Raya]], just north of the city.\n* Air:  the [[Sultan Azlan Shah Airport]] is the only airport in Ipoh.

[[Scoot]] and [[AirAsia]] provides daily flights out of Ipoh to [[Singapore]] [[Changi Airport]] while [[Batik Air Malaysia]] provides daily flights to [[Senai International Airport|Johor Bahru]].\nThere are also planned flights to Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand and China with talks of a new airport soon.\n\n==Education==\n{{Main|List of schools in Perak}}\n\nThis is a list of schools in Ipoh, Perak.\n*Sekolah Izzuddin Shah \n*[[Sekolah Tuanku Abdul Rahman]] \n*Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Tanjung Rambutan\n*Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Seri Puteri\n*Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan(T)ST.Philomena Convent, Ipoh\n*Sekolah Kebangsaan Dato Panglima'Kinta, Ipoh\n*Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (C) Yuk Choy, Ipoh\n*SMJK Yuk Choy, Ipoh\n*Tarcisian Convent School, Ipoh (TCS)\n*Anderson School, Ipoh\n*Anglo-Chinese School, Ipoh\n*[[St. Michael's Institution]], Ipoh\n*SMK Jalan Tasek, Ipoh \n*Methodist Girls Secondary School (MGS), Ipoh\n*Perak Girls Secondary School (PGS), Ipoh\n*[[SMK Main Convent]], Ipoh\n*Wesley Methodist School, Ipoh\n*Ipoh International School (Private)\n*Fairview International School, Ipoh\n*Perak Yuk Choy High School (Private) \n*Poi Lam High School (Private) \u6021\u4fdd\u57f9\u5357\u72ec\u7acb\u4e2d\u5b66 \n*Shen Jai High School, Ipoh \u6021\u4fdd\u6df1\u658b\u4e2d\u5b66\n*Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (TAMIL) Kerajaan, Sungai Pari, Ipoh\n*Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (TAMIL) Gunung Rapat, Ipoh\n*Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (TAMIL) Perak Sangeetha Sabha, Ipoh\n*SMK Rapat Setia, Ipoh\n*SMK Jalan Pasir Puteh, Ipoh\n*Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (C) Poi Lam, Ipoh\n*SMK Seri Keledang, Ipoh\n*SMK Menglembu, Ipoh\n*SMJK Poi Lam, Ipoh\n*Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (C) Sam Tet, Ipoh ({{zh|c=\u6021\u4fdd\u4e09\u5fb7\u5c0f\u5b66}})\n*[[SMJK Sam Tet]], Ipoh ({{zh|c=\u6021\u4fdd\u4e09\u5fb7\u4e2d\u5b66}})\n*SMK Dato Ahmad Said\n*Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan Ave Maria Convent, Ipoh ({{zh|c=\u6021\u4fdd\u5723\u6bcd\u739b\u5229\u4e9a\u5c0f\u5b66}})\n*SMJK Ave Maria Convent, Ipoh ({{zh|c=\u6021\u4fdd\u5723\u6bcd\u739b\u5229\u4e9a\u56fd\u6c11\u578b\u4e2d\u5b66}})\n*Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (C) Gunung Rapat, Ipoh\n*Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (C) Wan Hwa (1)\n*Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (C) Wan Hwa (2)\n*Sekolah Kebangsaan (ACS), Ipoh\n*Sekolah Kebangsaan (P) Methodist, Ipoh\n*Sekolah Kebangsaan Haji Mahmud Chemor, Ipoh\n*Sekolah Kebangsaan Kuala Pari, Ipoh\n*Sekolah Kebangsaan Jalan Pegoh\n*Sekolah Kebangsaan Jelapang\n*Sekolah Kebangsaan Marian Convent,Ipoh\n*Sekolah Kebangsaan Raja Ekram, Ipoh\n*SMK Raja Perempuan, Ipoh (RPS) Royal Princess School \"Cluster School\"\n*SRK Raja Perempuan, Ipoh (RPS) \n*Sekolah Kebangsaan Seri Ampang, Ipoh\n*Sekolah Kebangsaan St. Michael's Institution (1), Ipoh\n*Sekolah Kebangsaan St. Michael's Institution (2), Ipoh\n*Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan (C) Chung Shan\n\n== Theme Parks ==\nThere are several theme parks in Ipoh, including the Sunway Lost World of Tambun <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sunwaylostworldoftambun.com/|title=Lost World of Tambun Ipoh|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> and Movies Animated Park Studios (MAPS).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mapsperak.com/|title=Movies Animation Park, Ipoh Official Website|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207000455/http://www.mapsperak.com/|archive-date=7 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\nFilm and Television:\n* [[Angie Cheong]]\n* [[Mimi Chu]]\n* [[Iqram Dinzly]]\n* [[Mamat Khalid]]\n* [[Peter Pek]]\n* [[Afdlin Shauki]]\n* [[Patrick Teoh]]\n* [[Michelle Yeoh]]\nMusic:\n* [[Guang Liang|Michael Wong]]\n* [[Jamal Abdillah]]\n* [[Shila Amzah]]\n* [[Ning Baizura]]\n* [[Francissca Peter]]\n* [[:ms:Sophia Liana|Sophia Liana]]\n* Sam Chin Neng of [[Fuying & Sam]]\nSports: (Badminton):\n* [[Koo Kien Keat]]\n* [[Choong Tan Fook]]\n* [[Lee Wan Wah]]\n* [[Cheah Soon Kit]]\n* [[Wong Pei Tty]]\n* [[Wong Mew Choo]]\nSports ([[Association football|Football]]):\n* [[Nazirul Naim]]\n* [[Chan Kok Heng]]\n* [[Muhamad Khalid Jamlus]]\nSports (Others):\n* [[Tony Underwood]] (Rugby)\n* [[Nur Suryani Mohd Taibi]] (Sports shooting)\n* [[Leong Mun Yee]] (Diving)\nBusiness:\n* [[David Ho Sue San]] of [[Hovid Berhad]] & Carotech Berhad,\n* [[Lee Loy Seng]] (founder of Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad),\n* Dr. [[Wong Jeh Shyan]] CEO of CommerceNet Singapore Limited,\n* [[Koon Yew Yin]] Founder of [[IJM Corporation Bhd]] and [[Gamuda Berhad]]\nPolitics:\n* [[Yeoh Ghim Seng]]\n* [[Yeoh Eng-kiong|Dr Yeoh Eng Kiong]]\n* [[S.

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|5.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003.

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|5.6|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line''').
