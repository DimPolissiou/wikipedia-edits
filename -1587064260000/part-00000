The population density was 31.3 people per square mile (12.1/km\u00b2). There were 207 housing units at an average density of 8.2 per square&nbsp;mile (3.2/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the city was 15.03% [[Race (United States Census)|White]], 1.64% [[Race (United States Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 46.72% [[Race (United States Census)|Native American]], 26.77% [[Race (United States Census)|Asian]], 0.13% [[Race (United States Census)|Pacific Islander]], 5.93% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 3.79% from two or more races. 7.45% of the population were [[Race (United States Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Race (United States Census)|Latino]] of any race.\n\nThere were 170 households out of which 45.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 46.5% were married couples living together, 15.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31.2% were non-families. 25.3% of all households were made up of individuals and 2.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.90 and the average family size was 3.53.\n\nIn the city, the age distribution of the population shows 21.3% under the age of 18, 11.9% from 18 to 24, 41.0% from 25 to 44, 22.7% from 45 to 64, and 3.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females, there were 147.5 males.

Males had a median income of $30,714 versus $19,125 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $17,791. About 3.3% of families and 11.9% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 1.7% of those under age 18 and 27.3% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Economy==\nKing Cove, {{convert|600|nmi|km|sigfig=1}} SW of Anchorage at the end of the Alaska Peninsula, is home to PeterPan Seafoods' largest processing facility. [[King Crab]], [[Chionoecetes bairdi|bairdi]] and [[Chionoecetes|opilio tanner crab]], pollock, cod, salmon, halibut and [[Anoplopoma fimbria|black cod]] harvested in the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska are processed throughout the year. The plant, with origins back to the early 1900s, has the largest salmon canning capacity of any plant in Alaska. All five species of salmon are abundant in the waters near King Cove.\n\nSalmon remains a major part of the annual operation, but in recent years the plant has expanded and streamlined whitefish operations. The plant produces several product forms including pollock fillet block, [[shatterpack]] fillets, mince and [[surimi]]. Cod shatterpack fillets and salt cod are mainstays. At peak seasons, both winter and summer, nearly 500 employees staff the operation. King Cove's economy depends almost completely on the year-round commercial fishing and seafood processing industries. The PeterPan Seafoods' facility is one of the largest cannery operations under one roof in Alaska. 76 residents hold commercial fishing permits. Income is supplemented by subsistence activities.<ref>{{cite web |title= King Cove |work= PeterPan Seafoods, Inc. |url= http://www.ppsf.com/facilities/index.aspx }}</ref>\n\nThe community is served by [[King Cove Airport]], a state-owned public use airport with a gravel runway. A locally based FAA certificated Part 135 company called Eider Air [http://www.flyeiderair.com/about.html] provides on demand air-taxi service and charter operations to villagers and visitors.  Grant Aviation [https://www.flygrant.com/] also flys to King Cove, and has the contract for mail services.\n\nIt is also served by the [[Alaska Marine Highway]], the state-run ferry service which connects it with [[Cold Bay, Alaska|Cold Bay]] in the west and [[Sand Point, Alaska|Sand Point]] in the east.<ref>{{cite web|title=King Cove Alaska|url=http://www.dot.state.ak.us/amhs/comm/king_cove.shtml|website=Alaska Ferry Community Information|publisher=Alaska Department of Transportation|accessdate=21 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nA partially completed road between King Cove and [[Cold Bay]] is awaiting approval through the [[USDOI]]. This road would pass through the [[Izembek Wilderness]], causing irreparable damage to the preserve per governmental assessments according to a report generated by The Wilderness Society [https://wilderness.org/sites/default/files/Timeline%20-%20History%20of%20the%20Proposed%20Road%20Through%20Izembek%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge.pdf].  The previous negative decision by former [[USDOI]] director [[Sally Jewell]] is being reconsidered to include a land swap.  Proponents of the road state it would help local citizens in need of medical evacuation when airplanes can not land or take off from the local airport due to darkness or weather conditions. Opponents contend the road's main purpose is, as it always has been, to provide a link between King Cove and a nearby airport for commercial reasons. No evidence has been put forward to support a road would be safer in difficult weather condition than air transport. On 22 January 2018, Interior Secretary [[Ryan Zinke]] signed a land swap agreement to allow construction of the road.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Eilperin|first1=Juliet|title=Energy and Environment Zinke signs land-swap deal allowing road through Alaska\u2019s Izembek wilderness|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/01/22/zinke-to-sign-land-swap-deal-allowing-road-through-alaskas-izembek-wilderness/|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=Washington Post|date=22 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Healthcare==\n\nThe King Cove Community Health Clinic is run by the [[Eastern Aleutian Tribes]] and provides routine medical care, behavioral health, and emergency care services.  The clinic is open Monday through Friday during normal business hours, closed for all Alaskan and Federal holidays. After hours emergencies are handled by on-call practitioners.  There is an active local [[emergency medical services]] group who provide ambulance service.

[[King Crab]], [[Chionoecetes bairdi|bairdi]] and [[Chionoecetes|opilio tanner crab]], pollock, cod, salmon, halibut and [[Anoplopoma fimbria|black cod]] harvested in the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska are processed throughout the year. The plant, with origins back to the early 1900s, has the largest salmon canning capacity of any plant in Alaska. All five species of salmon are abundant in the waters near King Cove.\n\nSalmon remains a major part of the annual operation, but in recent years the plant has expanded and streamlined whitefish operations. The plant produces several product forms including pollock fillet block, [[shatterpack]] fillets, mince and [[surimi]]. Cod shatterpack fillets and salt cod are mainstays. At peak seasons, both winter and summer, nearly 500 employees staff the operation. King Cove's economy depends almost completely on the year-round commercial fishing and seafood processing industries. The PeterPan Seafoods' facility is one of the largest cannery operations under one roof in Alaska. 76 residents hold commercial fishing permits. Income is supplemented by subsistence activities.<ref>{{cite web |title= King Cove |work= PeterPan Seafoods, Inc. |url= http://www.ppsf.com/facilities/index.aspx }}</ref>\n\nThe community is served by [[King Cove Airport]], a state-owned public use airport with a gravel runway. A locally based FAA certificated Part 135 company called Eider Air [http://www.flyeiderair.com/about.html] provides on demand air-taxi service and charter operations to villagers and visitors.  Grant Aviation [https://www.flygrant.com/] also flys to King Cove, and has the contract for mail services.\n\nIt is also served by the [[Alaska Marine Highway]], the state-run ferry service which connects it with [[Cold Bay, Alaska|Cold Bay]] in the west and [[Sand Point, Alaska|Sand Point]] in the east.<ref>{{cite web|title=King Cove Alaska|url=http://www.dot.state.ak.us/amhs/comm/king_cove.shtml|website=Alaska Ferry Community Information|publisher=Alaska Department of Transportation|accessdate=21 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nA partially completed road between King Cove and [[Cold Bay]] is awaiting approval through the [[USDOI]]. This road would pass through the [[Izembek Wilderness]], causing irreparable damage to the preserve per governmental assessments according to a report generated by The Wilderness Society [https://wilderness.org/sites/default/files/Timeline%20-%20History%20of%20the%20Proposed%20Road%20Through%20Izembek%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge.pdf].  The previous negative decision by former [[USDOI]] director [[Sally Jewell]] is being reconsidered to include a land swap.  Proponents of the road state it would help local citizens in need of medical evacuation when airplanes can not land or take off from the local airport due to darkness or weather conditions. Opponents contend the road's main purpose is, as it always has been, to provide a link between King Cove and a nearby airport for commercial reasons. No evidence has been put forward to support a road would be safer in difficult weather condition than air transport. On 22 January 2018, Interior Secretary [[Ryan Zinke]] signed a land swap agreement to allow construction of the road.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Eilperin|first1=Juliet|title=Energy and Environment Zinke signs land-swap deal allowing road through Alaska\u2019s Izembek wilderness|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2018/01/22/zinke-to-sign-land-swap-deal-allowing-road-through-alaskas-izembek-wilderness/|accessdate=23 January 2018|work=Washington Post|date=22 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Healthcare==\n\nThe King Cove Community Health Clinic is run by the [[Eastern Aleutian Tribes]] and provides routine medical care, behavioral health, and emergency care services.

His family relocated to [[Hertfordshire]] where he then later attended [[Langleybury School]]. He captained the Hertfordshire Schools football team as a teenager.\n\n==Football career==\n'''Wealdstone'''\n\nJones' career in semi-professional football began in 1984, when he was 19 years old, at [[Conference Premier|Alliance Premier League]] side [[Wealdstone F.C.|Wealdstone]], who had spotted him playing for a local amateur side.<ref name=\"ATC\">{{cite book |last=Harman |first=John|title=Alliance to Conference |publisher=Tony Williams Publications |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-869833-52-7 }}</ref> A young addition to the experienced Wealdstone team which was the first ever side to achieve the non-league \"double\" in the 1984\u201385 season, he was a non-playing squad member at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in the 1985 [[FA Trophy]] final.

Jones became known to American audiences in the 2000 film remake of ''[[Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 film)|Gone in 60 Seconds]]'', in which he played \"Sphinx\". Although this was a major role with significant screen time, he only had one line of dialogue because his character was a silent, tough brawler.

Before 1973, Kahramanmara\u015f was named '''Mara\u015f'''. The city lies on a plain at the foot of the Ahir Da\u011f\u0131 (Ahir Mountain) and has a population of 1,112,634 as of 2017. The region is best known for its [[dondurma|distinctive ice cream]], and its production of [[salep]], a powder made from dried [[orchid]] tubers. It is connected by [[Kahramanmara\u015f Airport|air]] to [[\u0130stanbul]] and [[Ankara]].

Gurgum was vassal of [[Tabal]] until conquered by the [[Assyrian Empire]] in the 8th BC. It was known as Markasi during Assyrian rule. It was also ruled by [[Babylonians]], [[Persia|Persians]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Seleucids]] and Kingdom of [[Commagene]] before Roman rule.\n\nLater, the city-->\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Kmulucami1.JPG|The minaret of [[Kahramanmara\u015f Grand Mosque|Grand Mosque of Kahramanmaras]] (Kahramanmara\u015f Ulu Camii), one of the city's many historic mosques|left|thumb]]\nIn the early [[Iron Age]] (late 11th century BC to ca. 711 BC<ref>Bryce, Trevor (2012).

According to a 2010 ''[[Cumhuriyet]]'' article, the first ruins of Germanicia have already been unearthed in the Dulkadiro\u011fullar\u0131 quarters of the city.<ref>Cumhuriyet , 20 December 2010 p. 20</ref>\n\nIn 645, Germanicia was [[Siege of Germanicia|taken from the Byzantines]] by the [[Muslim]] [[Arabs]], to whom the city was known as Mar\u02bfash ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|\u0645\u0631\u0639\u0634}} {{IPA|[\u02c8mar\u0295a\u0283]}}, which is also the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] \u0721\u072a\u0725\u072b). Marash was an important [[Syriac Orthodox]] diocese; Mor [[Dionysius Bar Salibi]] (died 1171) was its bishop. Over the next three centuries, Marash belonged to the fortified Arab-Byzantine frontier zone (''[[Thughur]]'') and was used as a base for incursions into Byzantine-held [[Asia Minor]] by the Arabs. It was destroyed several times during the [[Arab-Byzantine Wars]]. It was rebuilt by the [[Umayyad]] caliph [[Muawiya I]] and was expanded ca. 800 by the [[Abbasid]] caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]]. The city was also controlled by the [[Tulunids]], [[Ikhshidid Dynasty|Ikhshidids]] and [[Hamdanid Dynasty|Hamdanids]] before the Byzantines, under [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nikephoros Phokas]], recovered it in 962.\n\nAfter the defeat of Emperor [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, [[Philaretos Brachamios]], a former Byzantine general, founded a principality centred on the city, which stretched from [[Antioch]] to [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]].\n\nGermanikeia was captured by [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]] in 1098, during the [[First Crusade]], and made part of the [[County of Edessa]], becoming an important center during Crusader rule. According to the Chronicle of [[Matthew of Edessa]], it was destroyed by an earthquake and 10,000 people were killed, which is probably an exaggeration. In 1100, it was captured by the [[Danishmends]], followed by the [[Seljuks]] in 1103. In 1107, Crusaders led by [[Tancred]] retook it with aid from [[Toros I]] of [[Lesser Armenia|Little Armenia]]. In 1135, the [[Danishmends]] besieged Germanikeia unsuccessfully, but captured it the next year. However, the Crusaders retook it in 1137.<ref>[http://www.k-maras.com/a_dos/t_gelisimi.htm Kahramanmara\u015f Tarihi Geli\u015fimi]</ref> [[Baldwin of Marash|Baldwin of Germanikeia]] died in a war in 1146, while trying recover Edessa [[Nur ad-Din Zangi]], which had taken the side of [[Joscelin II of Edessa]]. His successor [[Reynald of Germanikeia]] also died in the [[Battle of Inab]] against the [[Zengids]]. Sultan [[Mesud I]] of the [[Sultanate of Rum]] took the city in 1149.\n\nMarash was captured by the [[Zengids]] in 1151, but was recaptured by the Seljuks in 1152. Mara\u015f was recaptured by the [[Zengids]] in 1173 and was left to [[Mleh, Prince of Armenia|Mleh]], his collaborator. Marash passed to the Seljuks in 1174 and to the [[Ayyubids]] in 1182.\n\n[[File:DAVIS(1879) p145 MARASH, GIAUR DAGH MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE.jpg|320px|right|thumb|Panorama view (c1875)]]\n[[File:Trabzon Caddesi.jpg|thumb|320px|right|View along Trabzon Avenue (Trabzon Caddesi)]]\n\n[[Kaykhusraw I]], Sultan of Rum captured Marash in 1208. Seljuk rule lasted to 1258. In 1258, Mara\u015f was captured by the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]], following the war with the [[Ilkhanate]]. Served by an [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] Archbishop, it became for a very short period of time, the seat of the [[Catholicossate of the Great House of Cilicia]]. Marash was captured by [[Al-Ashraf Khalil]], Mamluk Sultan in 1292. But, it was recaptured by [[Hethum II, King of Armenia|Hethum II]], King of Cilician Armenia in 1299. Marash finally was taken by the Mamluks in 1304.\n\nMarash was ruled by Dulkadirs as vassals of the Mamluks from 1337\u20131515 before being annexed to the Ottoman Empire. In the early days of Ottoman rule (1525\u20136) there were 1,557 adult males (total population 7,500); at this time all the inhabitants were Muslims,<ref>Kupferschmidt, Uri M. (1987). ''The Supreme Muslim Council: Islam Under the British Mandate for Palestine''.

Marash was controlled by [[United Kingdom|British]] troops between 22 February 1919 and 30 October 1919, then by [[France|French]] troops after the [[Armistice of Mudros]].

Before 1973, Kahramanmara\u015f was named '''Mara\u015f'''. The city lies on a plain at the foot of the Ahir Da\u011f\u0131 (Ahir Mountain) and has a population of 1,112,634 as of 2017. The region is best known for its [[dondurma|distinctive ice cream]], and its production of [[salep]], a powder made from dried [[orchid]] tubers.

Gurgum was vassal of [[Tabal]] until conquered by the [[Assyrian Empire]] in the 8th BC. It was known as Markasi during Assyrian rule. It was also ruled by [[Babylonians]], [[Persia|Persians]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Seleucids]] and Kingdom of [[Commagene]] before Roman rule.\n\nLater, the city-->\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Kmulucami1.JPG|The minaret of [[Kahramanmara\u015f Grand Mosque|Grand Mosque of Kahramanmaras]] (Kahramanmara\u015f Ulu Camii), one of the city's many historic mosques|left|thumb]]\nIn the early [[Iron Age]] (late 11th century BC to ca. 711 BC<ref>Bryce, Trevor (2012).

According to a 2010 ''[[Cumhuriyet]]'' article, the first ruins of Germanicia have already been unearthed in the Dulkadiro\u011fullar\u0131 quarters of the city.<ref>Cumhuriyet , 20 December 2010 p. 20</ref>\n\nIn 645, Germanicia was [[Siege of Germanicia|taken from the Byzantines]] by the [[Muslim]] [[Arabs]], to whom the city was known as Mar\u02bfash ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|\u0645\u0631\u0639\u0634}} {{IPA|[\u02c8mar\u0295a\u0283]}}, which is also the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] \u0721\u072a\u0725\u072b). Marash was an important [[Syriac Orthodox]] diocese; Mor [[Dionysius Bar Salibi]] (died 1171) was its bishop. Over the next three centuries, Marash belonged to the fortified Arab-Byzantine frontier zone (''[[Thughur]]'') and was used as a base for incursions into Byzantine-held [[Asia Minor]] by the Arabs. It was destroyed several times during the [[Arab-Byzantine Wars]]. It was rebuilt by the [[Umayyad]] caliph [[Muawiya I]] and was expanded ca. 800 by the [[Abbasid]] caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]]. The city was also controlled by the [[Tulunids]], [[Ikhshidid Dynasty|Ikhshidids]] and [[Hamdanid Dynasty|Hamdanids]] before the Byzantines, under [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nikephoros Phokas]], recovered it in 962.\n\nAfter the defeat of Emperor [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, [[Philaretos Brachamios]], a former Byzantine general, founded a principality centred on the city, which stretched from [[Antioch]] to [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]].\n\nGermanikeia was captured by [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]] in 1098, during the [[First Crusade]], and made part of the [[County of Edessa]], becoming an important center during Crusader rule. According to the Chronicle of [[Matthew of Edessa]], it was destroyed by an earthquake and 10,000 people were killed, which is probably an exaggeration. In 1100, it was captured by the [[Danishmends]], followed by the [[Seljuks]] in 1103. In 1107, Crusaders led by [[Tancred]] retook it with aid from [[Toros I]] of [[Lesser Armenia|Little Armenia]]. In 1135, the [[Danishmends]] besieged Germanikeia unsuccessfully, but captured it the next year. However, the Crusaders retook it in 1137.<ref>[http://www.k-maras.com/a_dos/t_gelisimi.htm Kahramanmara\u015f Tarihi Geli\u015fimi]</ref> [[Baldwin of Marash|Baldwin of Germanikeia]] died in a war in 1146, while trying recover Edessa [[Nur ad-Din Zangi]], which had taken the side of [[Joscelin II of Edessa]]. His successor [[Reynald of Germanikeia]] also died in the [[Battle of Inab]] against the [[Zengids]]. Sultan [[Mesud I]] of the [[Sultanate of Rum]] took the city in 1149.\n\nMarash was captured by the [[Zengids]] in 1151, but was recaptured by the Seljuks in 1152. Mara\u015f was recaptured by the [[Zengids]] in 1173 and was left to [[Mleh, Prince of Armenia|Mleh]], his collaborator. Marash passed to the Seljuks in 1174 and to the [[Ayyubids]] in 1182.\n\n[[File:DAVIS(1879) p145 MARASH, GIAUR DAGH MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE.jpg|320px|right|thumb|Panorama view (c1875)]]\n[[File:Trabzon Caddesi.jpg|thumb|320px|right|View along Trabzon Avenue (Trabzon Caddesi)]]\n\n[[Kaykhusraw I]], Sultan of Rum captured Marash in 1208. Seljuk rule lasted to 1258. In 1258, Mara\u015f was captured by the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]], following the war with the [[Ilkhanate]]. Served by an [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] Archbishop, it became for a very short period of time, the seat of the [[Catholicossate of the Great House of Cilicia]]. Marash was captured by [[Al-Ashraf Khalil]], Mamluk Sultan in 1292. But, it was recaptured by [[Hethum II, King of Armenia|Hethum II]], King of Cilician Armenia in 1299. Marash finally was taken by the Mamluks in 1304.\n\nMarash was ruled by Dulkadirs as vassals of the Mamluks from 1337\u20131515 before being annexed to the Ottoman Empire. In the early days of Ottoman rule (1525\u20136) there were 1,557 adult males (total population 7,500); at this time all the inhabitants were Muslims,<ref>Kupferschmidt, Uri M. (1987). ''The Supreme Muslim Council: Islam Under the British Mandate for Palestine''.

Marash was controlled by [[United Kingdom|British]] troops between 22 February 1919 and 30 October 1919, then by [[France|French]] troops after the [[Armistice of Mudros]].

It is also difficult to recover the name of Oudewater. One explanation is that the name is a corruption of ''old [[water-meadow]]''. Oudewater was an important border city between [[Holland]] and [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]]. Oudewater (lit. \"Old water\") was of great strategic importance.\n\nThe town was granted [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] in 1265 by [[Hendrik van Vianden]], the [[Archdiocese of Utrecht (695\u20131580)|bishop of Utrecht]].\n\nOudewater took its place in the First Free States council in Dordrecht on 19 July 1572, Oudewater was one of the twelve cities taking part in the first free convention of the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] in [[Dordrecht]]. This was a meeting that laid down the origin of the State of the Netherlands, as we know it now, under the leadership of the House of Orange. This happened at the beginning of the [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568\u20131648) when the Netherlands were still part of the [[Spanish Empire]]. After a [[Siege of Oudewater (1575)|Siege of Oudewater]], the city was conquered by the Spanish on 7 August 1575, and most of its inhabitants were killed, including the family of famous Oudewater native and Protestant theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]] (1560-1609).\n\nIn the 16th and 17th century, Oudewater was an important producer of [[rope]]. In the surrounding area, [[hemp]] was cultivated. There still is a rope manufacturing plant and a rope museum in the town.\n\nOudewater is the setting for the 1975 novel ''Das Geheimnis des Baron Oudewater'' set in the 16th century, when the Netherlands was fighting for its independence from Spain. Written by the German author Alberta Rommel, it has been described as a romantic historical novel.\n\n== Geography ==\nOudewater is located at {{coords|52|1|N|4|52|E}} in the southwest of the province of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] in the center of the [[Netherlands]]. It is situated where the Linschoten river flows out in the [[Hollandse IJssel]].\n\nOudewater is bordered by the municipalities of [[Montfoort]] (in the northeast), [[Lopik]] (southeast), [[Krimpenerwaard]] (southwest), and [[Bodegraven-Reeuwijk]] (northwest).\n\nThe municipality of Oudewater consists of the following cities, towns, villages and/or districts: [[Hekendorp]], Oudewater, [[Papekop]], [[Snelrewaard]].\n\n== Buildings ==\n[[File:Oudewater-Waag.jpg|thumb|left|The [[weigh house]] in 2012]]\n\nOudewater is famous for the ''Heksen[[waag]]'' ([[Witchcraft|Witch]]es' [[Weighing scale|scales]]). This Weighing house, an official town building, became famous at the height of the [[Witch trials in the early modern period#Peak of the trials: 1580%E2%80%931630|European witch trials]] of the 16th century because people accused of [[witchcraft]] were offered a fair chance to prove their innocence as opposed to many other places where the scales were rigged. \n\nFrom all over Europe people made the journey to Oudewater to avoid prosecution. After the weighing, they received an official certificate proclaiming them not a witch. Nobody was ever found to be an actual witch in Oudewater, though the weighings were still a public spectacle. Certificates would state that \"the body weight is in proportion to its build.\" The reasoning behind this is the old belief that a witch has no soul and therefore weighs significantly less than an ordinary person; this distinction would supposedly allow the witch to fly on a broomstick. \n[[File:Oudewater, stadszicht met kerk2 2009-04-13 16.53.JPG|thumb|left|View to the town]]\nIn early modern times, when accusations of witchcraft could result in being burned at the stake, the town of Oudewater offered the accused a chance of proving their innocence. This can be seen as a sign of the growing power of the citizenry as a third force next to that of the church and nobility. Before witch hunts were sanctioned by the law and the church in their bid to break the power of local herb doctors and [[midwife]]s. By giving out these certificates the citizens of Oudewater, therefore were defying the church. \n\nThe Waag is still open as a tourist attraction, and official certificates are available. \n\nThe town hall dates from 1588 and features a stork's nest. Oudewater has a monumental protected city centre with more than 250 protected houses. The church, now [[Protestant]], dates from the 15th century. Its tower is from about 1300.

It is also difficult to recover the name of Oudewater. One explanation is that the name is a corruption of ''old [[water-meadow]]''. Oudewater was an important border city between [[Holland]] and [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]]. Oudewater (lit. \"Old water\") was of great strategic importance.\n\n[[File:Oudewater, stadszicht met kerk2 2009-04-13 16.53.JPG|thumb|left|View to the town]]\nThe town was granted [[City rights in the Netherlands|city rights]] in 1265 by [[Hendrik van Vianden]], the [[Archdiocese of Utrecht (695\u20131580)|bishop of Utrecht]].\n\nOudewater took its place in the First Free States council in Dordrecht on 19 July 1572, Oudewater was one of the twelve cities taking part in the first free convention of the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] in [[Dordrecht]]. This was a meeting that laid down the origin of the State of the Netherlands, as we know it now, under the leadership of the House of Orange. This happened at the beginning of the [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568\u20131648) when the Netherlands were still part of the [[Spanish Empire]]. After a [[Siege of Oudewater (1575)|Siege of Oudewater]], the city was conquered by the Spanish on 7 August 1575, and most of its inhabitants were killed, including the family of famous Oudewater native and Protestant theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]] (1560-1609).\n\nIn the 16th and 17th century, Oudewater was an important producer of [[rope]]. In the surrounding area, [[hemp]] was cultivated. There still is a rope manufacturing plant and a rope museum in the town.\n\nOudewater is the setting for the 1975 novel ''Das Geheimnis des Baron Oudewater'' set in the 16th century, when the Netherlands was fighting for its independence from Spain. Written by the German author Alberta Rommel, it has been described as a romantic historical novel.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Gem-Oudewater-OpenTopo.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Map of the municipality of Oudewater, June 2015]]\n\nOudewater is located at {{coords|52|1|N|4|52|E}} in the southwest of the province of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] in the center of the [[Netherlands]]. It is situated where the Linschoten river flows out in the [[Hollandse IJssel]].\n\nOudewater is bordered by the municipalities of [[Montfoort]] (in the northeast), [[Lopik]] (southeast), [[Krimpenerwaard]] (southwest), and [[Bodegraven-Reeuwijk]] (northwest).\n\nThe municipality of Oudewater consists of the following cities, towns, villages and/or districts: [[Hekendorp]], Oudewater, [[Papekop]], [[Snelrewaard]].\n\n== Buildings ==\n[[File:Oudewater-Waag.jpg|thumb|left|The [[weigh house]] in 2012]]\n\nOudewater is famous for the ''Heksen[[waag]]'' ([[Witchcraft|Witch]]es' [[Weighing scale|scales]]). This Weighing house, an official town building, became famous at the height of the [[Witch trials in the early modern period#Peak of the trials: 1580%E2%80%931630|European witch trials]] of the 16th century because people accused of [[witchcraft]] were offered a fair chance to prove their innocence as opposed to many other places where the scales were rigged. \n\nFrom all over Europe people made the journey to Oudewater to avoid prosecution. After the weighing, they received an official certificate proclaiming them not a witch. Nobody was ever found to be an actual witch in Oudewater, though the weighings were still a public spectacle. Certificates would state that \"the body weight is in proportion to its build.\" The reasoning behind this is the old belief that a witch has no soul and therefore weighs significantly less than an ordinary person; this distinction would supposedly allow the witch to fly on a broomstick. \n\nIn early modern times, when accusations of witchcraft could result in being burned at the stake, the town of Oudewater offered the accused a chance of proving their innocence. This can be seen as a sign of the growing power of the citizenry as a third force next to that of the church and nobility. Before witch hunts were sanctioned by the law and the church in their bid to break the power of local herb doctors and [[midwife]]s. By giving out these certificates the citizens of Oudewater, therefore were defying the church. \n\nThe Waag is still open as a tourist attraction, and official certificates are available. \n\nThe town hall dates from 1588 and features a stork's nest. Oudewater has a monumental protected city centre with more than 250 protected houses. The church, now [[Protestant]], dates from the 15th century. Its tower is from about 1300. During the religious wars, until the sacking of Oudewater, both [[Roman Catholic]]s and Protestants used this church. Thereafter Catholics were still tolerated (the Spanish occupiers being Catholic) but more in low profile.\n\n== Notable people ==\n[[File:Gerard David selfportrait in The Virgin among the Virgins.jpg|155px|thumb|Gerard David, self-portrait, 1509]]\n* [[Albert van Ouwater]] (ca.1410/1415 \u2013 1475) an early artist of [[Early Netherlandish painting]] working in the Northern Netherlands\n* [[Gerard David]] (ca.1460\u20131523) an [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish painter]] and manuscript illuminator, used brilliant colour\n* [[Rudolph Snellius]] (1546\u20131613) a Dutch linguist and mathematician, a political and intellectual force of the [[Dutch Golden Age]]\n* [[Jacobus Arminius]] (1560\u20131609) a Dutch theologian, formed [[Arminianism]] and the Dutch [[Remonstrant]] movement\n* [[Hendrikus Albertus Lorentz]] (1871\u20131944) a Dutch explorer in [[New Guinea]] and diplomat in [[South Africa]]\n* [[Jan Montyn]] (1924\u20132015) a Dutch artist, specialized in [[etching]]\n* [[Wim Klever]] (born 1930 in Snelrewaard) a Dutch scholar of the Jewish Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]]\n* [[Dirk de Ridder]] (born 1972) a sailor, competed at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]]\n\n==Image gallery==\n<gallery mode=packed>\nImage:Oudewater, stadszicht met kerk1 2009-04-13 16.41.JPG|Church near a canal\nFile:Oudewater, de Sint Franciskuskerk RM517464 foto5 2013-07-07 11.35.jpg|Church: Sint Franciskuskerk\nFile:KerkOudewater.JPG|St.-Micha\u00ebls kerk, Oudewater\nFile:Oudewater, straatzicht met voormalig stadhuis RM32083 foto2 2013-07-07 11.39.jpg|Former townhall in 2013\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.oudewater.nl/}}\n* [http://www.visit-oudewater.nl/ Tourist information]\n* [http://www.heksenwaag.nl/ Museum de Heksenwaag]\n* {{Wikivoyage-inline|Oudewater}}\n\n{{Geographic location\n | Centre    = Oudewater\n | North     = [[Montfoort]]\n | East      = [[Montfoort]]\n | South     = [[Lopik]]\n | Southwest = [[Krimpenerwaard]] ([[South Holland|ZH]])\n | Northwest = [[Bodegraven-Reeuwijk]] ([[South Holland|ZH]])\n}}\n{{Utrecht Province}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Oudewater| ]]\n[[Category:Municipalities of Utrecht (province)]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Utrecht (province)]]\n", "name_user": "ArbieP", "label": "safe", "comment": "moved topo map and another photo down", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oudewater"}
