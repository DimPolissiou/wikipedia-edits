The unit was upgraded to regimental size and renamed to Norrbottens regemente in 1892. The regiment had its training grounds at various places in Norrbotten, but was eventually garrisoned in Boden in 1907. A [[Ski warfare|skiing]] battalion was created in 1910, and in 1943 this ski battalion was split off from the regiment to later becoming The Army Ranger School and in 1975 as [[Lapland Ranger Regiment]].\n\nThe regiment merged with [[Norrbotten Armoured Battalion]] (P 5) in 1975 to form Norrbotten Regiment with Norrbotten Armoured Battalion, and the unit gained the designation I 19/P 5. For a short time in the 1990s, the unit was then merged with the wartime-organised [[Norrbotten Brigade]], designation MekB 19. In 2000, the unit was reorganised once again, and was redesignated back to its old designation I 19 despite being an armoured regiment, the name was also changed back to Norrbotten Regiment.\n\n== Organisation ==\n{{See also|V\u00e4sterbotten Regiment#Organisation}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-1-of-3}}\n;1841\n*[[Life company]]\n*Pite\u00e5 Company\n*Kalix Company\n*R\u00e5ne\u00e5 Company\n{{col-2-of-3}}\n;2000\n*[[Norrbotten Armoured Battalion]]\n*[[Norrland Artillery Battalion]]\n*[[Norrland Engineer Battalion]]\n*[[Norrland Air Defence Battalion]]\n*[[Norrland Signal Battalion]]\n{{col-3-of-3}}\n;2007\n*[[Norrbotten Armoured Battalion]]\n*[[Army Ranger Battalion (Sweden)|Army Ranger Battalion]]\n* Lappland Ranger Group\n* Norrbotten Group\n* V\u00e4sterbotten Group \n* Field Ranger Group\n* West Norrland Group\n* F\u00f6rsvarsmaktens vinterenhet (Armed Forces Winter Unit)\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Heraldry and traditions==\n\n===Colours, standards and guidons===\nThe Norrbotten Regiment presents one regimental colour, three battalion colours and two battalion standards:\n\n====Colour of Norrbotten Regiment====\nOn 31 August 1974, the regiment was presented with a new colour by His Majesty the King [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf VI Adolf]] in connection with the 350th anniversary of the regiment.

The unit was upgraded to regimental size and renamed to Norrbottens regemente in 1892. The regiment had its training grounds at various places in Norrbotten, but was eventually garrisoned in Boden in 1907. A [[Ski warfare|skiing]] battalion was created in 1910, and in 1943 this ski battalion was split off from the regiment to later becoming The Army Ranger School and in 1975 as [[Lapland Ranger Regiment]].\n\nThe regiment merged with [[Norrbotten Armoured Battalion]] (P 5) in 1975 to form Norrbotten Regiment with Norrbotten Armoured Battalion, and the unit gained the designation I 19/P 5. For a short time in the 1990s, the unit was then merged with the wartime-organised [[Norrbotten Brigade]], designation MekB 19. In 2000, the unit was reorganised once again, and was redesignated back to its old designation I 19 despite being an armoured regiment, the name was also changed back to Norrbotten Regiment.\n\n== Organisation ==\n{{See also|V\u00e4sterbotten Regiment#Organisation}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-1-of-3}}\n;1841\n*[[Life company]]\n*Pite\u00e5 Company\n*Kalix Company\n*R\u00e5ne\u00e5 Company\n{{col-2-of-3}}\n;2000\n*[[Norrbotten Armoured Battalion]]\n*[[Norrland Artillery Battalion]]\n*[[Norrland Engineer Battalion]]\n*[[Norrland Air Defence Battalion]]\n*[[Norrland Signal Battalion]]\n{{col-3-of-3}}\n;2007\n*[[Norrbotten Armoured Battalion]]\n*[[Army Ranger Battalion (Sweden)|Army Ranger Battalion]]\n* Lappland Ranger Group\n* Norrbotten Group\n* V\u00e4sterbotten Group \n* Field Ranger Group\n* West Norrland Group\n* F\u00f6rsvarsmaktens vinterenhet (Armed Forces Winter Unit)\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Heraldry and traditions==\n\n===Colours, standards and guidons===\nThe Norrbotten Regiment presents one regimental colour, three battalion colours and two battalion standards:\n\n====Colour of Norrbotten Regiment====\nOn 31 August 1974, the regiment was presented with a new colour by His Majesty the King [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf VI Adolf]] in connection with the 350th anniversary of the regiment.
