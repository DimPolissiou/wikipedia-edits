At that time, the party revolved around two political leaders such as [[Radu C\u00e2mpeanu]] and [[Mircea Ionescu-Quintus]], both former youth liberal leaders during the [[interwar period]] and after [[World War II]]. At the [[1990 Romanian general election|1990 general elections]], the PNL became the third largest party in Romania and its then leader, Radu C\u00e2mpeanu, finished second in the same year's presidential elections, with 10.6% of the cast votes, behind [[Ion Iliescu]].\n\nShortly afterwards, most notably alongside the [[Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party]] (PN\u021a-CD), but to a lesser extent also with other smaller center-right parties and NGOs, the PNL managed to form the [[Romanian Democratic Convention]] (CDR) in an effort to ensemble a stronger collective opposition and alternative governing body to then ruling [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN). However, prior to the [[1992 Romanian general election|1992 general elections]], C\u00e2mpeanu decided to withdraw the party from the CDR electoral alliance and instead compete as a stand-alone political force.\n\nUltimately, this proved to be a strategic error, as the party did not manage to surpass the needed electoral threshold for parliamentary presence and as such was forced to enter extra-parliamentary opposition for the period 1992\u20131996. This also resulted in several splinter factions leaving the main party, with some PNL groups opting to remain within the CDR while others still supporting C\u00e2mpeanu's side.\n\nNevertheless, after a change of leadership that saw Ionescu-Quintus as the new party leader elected in 1995, the PNL contested the [[1996 Romanian general election|1996 general election]] as part of the CDR.<ref name=\"RoseMunro2009\">{{cite book|author1=Richard Rose|author2=Neil Munro|title=Parties and Elections in New European Democracies|year=2009|publisher=ECPR Press|isbn=978-0-9558203-2-8|pages=215\u2013216}}</ref> The 1996 general elections represented the first peaceful transition of power in post-1989 Romania, with the PNL, PN\u021a-CD, [[Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]] (PD), and the [[Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania]] (UDMR) forming a grand coalition that pushed the PDSR (formerly the FSN) in opposition for the period 1996\u20132000. The presidency was also won by the CDR's common candidate, more specifically [[Emil Constantinescu]], who received support on behalf of all of the alliance's constituent parties (including the PNL political groups therein).\n\n=== 2000\u20132010: Opposition and second governing experiences ===\n\nBetween 1996 and 2000, because of the lack of political coherence within the parties of the governing CDR coalition and the multiple changes of cabinets that followed, the PNL decided once more to withdraw from the alliance just before the [[2000 Romanian general election|2000 general elections]] and, consequently, to compete alone instead. This time, the party managed to gain parliamentary presence but failed to form another centre-right government, finishing fourth in the legislative elections and third in the presidential election.\n\nTherefore, during the mid 2000s, the PNL joined forces with the PD in order to form the [[Justice and Truth Alliance]] (DA)<ref name=\"RoseMunro2009\"/> so as to compete in the [[2004 Romanian general election|2004 general election]] as an alternative to the then ruling PSD (formerly PDSR) government. The alliance managed to finish second by popular vote in the [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]], subsequently form a centre-right cabinet, and also win the presidency during the same year.\n\nUntil April 2007, the PNL was the largest member of the governing Justice and Truth Alliance, which enjoyed a parliamentary majority due to an alliance between the PNL, PD, the [[Conservative Party (Romania)|Conservative Party]] (PC) and the UDMR.<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Villy Tsakona|editor2=Diana Elena Popa|title=Studies in Political Humour: In Between Political Critique and Public Entertainment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uELvEqHybukC&pg=PA162|year=2011|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=90-272-0637-6|page=162}}</ref> In April 2007, then PNL prime minister [[C\u0103lin Popescu-T\u0103riceanu]], who was also the party leader, formed a minority government solely with the UDMR and the remainder PD ministers were reshuffled. This cause internal opposition within the party and led to a splinter group, the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Romania)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (PLD), eventually merging with the PD to form the [[Democratic Liberal Party (Romania)|Democratic Liberal Party]] (PDL).\n\nAfter the [[2008 Romanian legislative election|2008 legislative election]] the party placed third and entered official opposition, winning 19.74% seats in the Parliament, while the new grand coalition, formed by their former enlarged ally the democrat liberals (PDL) and the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD), had roughly 70%. At the [[2009 Romanian presidential election|2009 presidential election]] the National Liberal Party's then newly elected leader, [[Crin Antonescu]], finished third in the first round and the party

At that time, the party revolved around two political leaders such as [[Radu C\u00e2mpeanu]] and [[Mircea Ionescu-Quintus]], both former youth liberal leaders during the [[interwar period]] and after [[World War II]]. At the [[1990 Romanian general election|1990 general elections]], the PNL became the third largest party in Romania and its then leader, Radu C\u00e2mpeanu, finished second in the same year's presidential elections, with 10.6% of the cast votes, behind [[Ion Iliescu]].\n\nShortly afterwards, most notably alongside the [[Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party]] (PN\u021a-CD), but to a lesser extent also with other smaller center-right parties and NGOs, the PNL managed to form the [[Romanian Democratic Convention]] (CDR) in an effort to ensemble a stronger collective opposition and alternative governing body to then ruling [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] (FSN). However, prior to the [[1992 Romanian general election|1992 general elections]], C\u00e2mpeanu decided to withdraw the party from the CDR electoral alliance and instead compete as a stand-alone political force.\n\nUltimately, this proved to be a strategic error, as the party did not manage to surpass the needed electoral threshold for parliamentary presence and as such was forced to enter extra-parliamentary opposition for the period 1992\u20131996. This also resulted in several splinter factions leaving the main party, with some PNL groups opting to remain within the CDR while others still supporting C\u00e2mpeanu's side.\n\nNevertheless, after a change of leadership that saw Ionescu-Quintus as the new party leader elected in 1995, the PNL contested the [[1996 Romanian general election|1996 general election]] as part of the CDR.<ref name=\"RoseMunro2009\">{{cite book|author1=Richard Rose|author2=Neil Munro|title=Parties and Elections in New European Democracies|year=2009|publisher=ECPR Press|isbn=978-0-9558203-2-8|pages=215\u2013216}}</ref> The 1996 general elections represented the first peaceful transition of power in post-1989 Romania, with the PNL, PN\u021a-CD, [[Democratic Party (Romania)|Democratic Party]] (PD), and the [[Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania]] (UDMR) forming a grand coalition that pushed the PDSR (formerly the FSN) in opposition for the period 1996\u20132000. The presidency was also won by the CDR's common candidate, more specifically [[Emil Constantinescu]], who received support on behalf of all of the alliance's constituent parties (including the PNL political groups therein).\n\n=== 2000\u20132010: Opposition and second governing experiences ===\n\nBetween 1996 and 2000, because of the lack of political coherence within the parties of the governing CDR coalition and the multiple changes of cabinets that followed, the PNL decided once more to withdraw from the alliance just before the [[2000 Romanian general election|2000 general elections]] and, consequently, to compete alone instead. This time, the party managed to gain parliamentary presence but failed to form another centre-right government, finishing fourth in the legislative elections and third in the presidential election.\n\nTherefore, during the mid 2000s, the PNL joined forces with the PD in order to form the [[Justice and Truth Alliance]] (DA)<ref name=\"RoseMunro2009\"/> so as to compete in the [[2004 Romanian general election|2004 general election]] as an alternative to the then ruling PSD (formerly PDSR) government. The alliance managed to finish second by popular vote in the [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]], subsequently form a centre-right cabinet, and also win the presidency during the same year.\n\nUntil April 2007, the PNL was the largest member of the governing Justice and Truth Alliance, which enjoyed a parliamentary majority due to an alliance between the PNL, PD, the [[Conservative Party (Romania)|Conservative Party]] (PC) and the UDMR.<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Villy Tsakona|editor2=Diana Elena Popa|title=Studies in Political Humour: In Between Political Critique and Public Entertainment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uELvEqHybukC&pg=PA162|year=2011|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=90-272-0637-6|page=162}}</ref> In April 2007, then PNL prime minister [[C\u0103lin Popescu-T\u0103riceanu]], who was also the party leader, formed a minority government solely with the UDMR and the remainder PD ministers were reshuffled. This cause internal opposition within the party and led to a splinter group, the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Romania)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (PLD), eventually merging with the PD to form the [[Democratic Liberal Party (Romania)|Democratic Liberal Party]] (PDL).\n\nAfter the [[2008 Romanian legislative election|2008 legislative election]] the party placed third and entered official opposition, winning 19.74% seats in the Parliament, while the new grand coalition, formed by their former enlarged ally the democrat liberals (PDL) and the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD), had roughly 70%. At the [[2009 Romanian presidential election|2009 presidential election]] the National Liberal Party's then newly elected leader, [[Crin Antonescu]], finished third in the first round and the party

That for this End ... it will be necessary ... to erect a public Building or Buildings for the boarding of the youth & the Residence of the Professors.</blockquote>\n\nThe three petitioners were [[Ezra Stiles]], pastor of Newport's [[Clarke Street Meeting House|Second Congregational Church]] and future president of [[Yale University|Yale]]; [[William Ellery|William Ellery, Jr.]], future [[Signing of the United States Declaration of Independence|signer]] of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]; and [[Josias Lyndon]], future governor of the colony. Stiles and Ellery were co-authors of the Charter of the College two years later. The editor of Stiles's papers observes, \"This draft of a petition connects itself with other evidence of Dr. Stiles's project for a Collegiate Institution in Rhode Island, before the charter of what became Brown University.\"<ref>[[#Dexter|Dexter (1916)]], p. 25.</ref>\n\nThere is further documentary evidence that Stiles was making plans for a college in 1762. On January 20, Chauncey Whittelsey, pastor of the First Church of New Haven, answered a letter from Stiles:<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 13\u201314.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The week before last I sent you the Copy of Yale College Charter ... Should you make any Progress in the Affair of a Colledge, I should be glad to hear of it; I heartily wish you Success therein.</blockquote>\n\nThe Philadelphia Association of Baptist Churches also had an eye on Rhode Island, home of the mother church of their denomination: the [[First Baptist Church in America]], founded in Providence in 1638 by [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]]. The Baptists were as yet unrepresented among colonial colleges; the [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregationalists]] had [[Harvard]] and [[Yale]], the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] had the College of New Jersey (later [[Princeton University|Princeton]]), and the [[Church of England|Episcopalians]] had the [[College of William and Mary]] and King's College (later [[Columbia University|Columbia]]). Isaac Backus was the historian of the New England Baptists and an inaugural Trustee of Brown, writing in 1784. He described the October 1762 resolution taken at Philadelphia:<ref>Isaac Backus, ''A History of New-England'', 3 vols. (Boston, 1777\u201396), vol. 2, quoted in [[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], p. 8.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Philadelphia Association obtained such an acquaintance with our affairs, as to bring them to an apprehension that it was practicable and expedient to erect a college in the Colony of Rhode-Island, under the chief direction of the Baptists; ... Mr. [[James Manning (minister)|James Manning]], who took his first degree in New-Jersey college in September, 1762, was esteemed a suitable leader in this important work.</blockquote>\n\nManning arrived at [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] in July 1763 and was introduced to Stiles, who agreed to write the Charter for the College. Stiles's first draft was read to the [[Rhode Island General Assembly|General Assembly]] in August 1763 and rejected by Baptist members who worried that the College Board of Fellows would under-represent the Baptists. A revised Charter written by Stiles and Ellery was adopted by the Assembly on March 3, 1764.\n\nIn September 1764, the inaugural meeting of the College Corporation was held at Newport. Governor [[Stephen Hopkins (politician)|Stephen Hopkins]] was chosen chancellor, former and future governor [[Samuel Ward (American statesman)|Samuel Ward]] was vice chancellor, [[John Tillinghast]] treasurer, and [[Thomas Eyres]] secretary. The Charter stipulated that the Board of Trustees be composed of 22 Baptists, five [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], five Episcopalians, and four Congregationalists. Of the 12 Fellows, eight should be Baptists\u2014including the College president\u2014\"and the rest indifferently of any or all Denominations.\"<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 502\u2013503; the Charter and its drafts and associated documents are printed in [[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 493\u2013507; and in [[#Guild|Guild (1867)]], pp. 119\u2013146.</ref>\n\nThe Charter was not the grant of [[King George III]], as is sometimes supposed, but rather an Act of the colonial General Assembly. In two particulars, the Charter may be said to be a uniquely progressive document. First, other colleges had curricular strictures against opposing doctrines, while Brown's Charter asserted, \"Sectarian differences of opinions, shall not make any Part of the Public and Classical Instruction.\" Second, according to Brown University historian Walter Bronson, \"the instrument governing Brown University recognized more broadly and fundamentally than any other the principle of denominational cooperation.\"<ref name=\"Bronson, pp. 29-33\"/> The oft-repeated statement is inaccurate that Brown's Charter alone prohibited a religious test for College membership; other college charters were also liberal in that particular.\n\n[[File:Brown University 1792 engraving.jpg|thumb|right|[[University Hall (Brown University)|University Hall]] (right) and president's house, engraving 1792]]\n[[James Manning (minister)|James Manning]] was sworn in as the College's first president in 1765 and served until 1791.

When it merged with Brown in 1971, the Pembroke Campus was absorbed into the Brown campus. The Pembroke campus is centered on a quadrangle that fronts on Meeting Street, where a garden and monument\u2014with scale-model of the quadrangle in bronze\u2014compose the formal entry to the campus. The Pembroke campus is among the most pleasing spaces at Brown, with noteworthy examples of Victorian and Georgian architecture. The west side of the quadrangle comprises Pembroke Hall (1897), Smith-Buonanno Hall (1907, formerly Pembroke Gymnasium), and Metcalf Hall (1919); the east side comprises Alumnae Hall (1927) and Miller Hall (1910); the quadrangle culminates on the north with Andrews Hall (1947) and its terrace and garden. Pembroke Hall, originally a classroom building and library, now houses the Cogut Center for the Humanities.\n\n[[File:BrownUniversity-OrwigMusicBuilding.jpg|thumb|left|253x253px|The Orwig Music Library in the former Isaac Gifford Ladd house, built 1850, acquired in 1969 when Brown bought the buildings and grounds of [[Bryant University]] on the southeast edge of the Brown campus]]\nEast Campus, centered on Hope and Charlesfield streets, was originally the site of [[Bryant University]]. In 1969, as Bryant was preparing to move to Smithfield, Rhode Island, Brown bought their Providence campus for $5 million. This expanded the Brown campus by {{convert|10|acre|m2}} and 26 buildings, included several historic houses, notably the Isaac Gifford Ladd house, built 1850 (now Brown's Orwig Music Library), and the Robert Taft House, built 1895 (now King House). The area was named East Campus in 1971.\n\n[[Thayer Street]] runs through Brown's main campus, north to south, and is College Hill's reduced-scale counterpart to [[Harvard Square]] or Berkeley's [[Telegraph Avenue]]. Restaurants, cafes, bistros, taverns, pubs, bookstores, second-hand shops, and the like abound. Tourists, people-watchers, buskers, and students from Providence's six colleges make the scene. Half a mile south of campus is Thayer Street's hipper cousin, [[Wickenden Street]]. More picturesque and with older architecture, it features galleries, pubs, specialty shops, artist-supply stores, and a regionally famous coffee shop that doubles as a film set (for [[Woody Allen]] and others).\n\n[[Brown Stadium]], which was built in 1925 and is home to the football team, is located approximately a mile to the northeast of the main campus. Marston Boathouse, the home of the crew teams, lies on the Blackstone/Seekonk River, to the southeast of campus. Brown's Warren Alpert Medical School is situated in the historic [[Jewelry District (Providence)|Jewelry District of Providence]], near the medical campus of Brown's teaching hospitals, [[Rhode Island Hospital]], [[Women & Infants Hospital of Rhode Island|Women and Infants Hospital]], and Hasbro Children's Hospital. Other university research facilities in the Jewelry District include the Laboratories for Molecular Medicine.\n\nBrown's School of Public Health occupies a landmark modernist building overlooking Memorial Park on the Providence Riverwalk. Brown also owns {{convert|376|acre|km2|adj=on}} the [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)|Mount Hope Grant]] in Bristol, Rhode Island, an important [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and [[King Philip's War]] site. Brown's [[Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology]] Collection Research Center, particularly strong in Native American items, is located in the Mount Hope Grant.\n\n==Academics==\n===Presidents===\n[[File:Christina paxson.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|19th Brown president [[Christina Hull Paxson]], 2012 to present]]\n[[File:JonathanMaxcy.jpg|upright|thumb|left|160px|2nd Brown president, [[Jonathan Maxcy]], 1792\u20131802 was the first alum to serve as president]]\n[[File:Francis Wayland 4th President of Brown.jpg|thumb|left|160px|4th Brown president Francis Wayland, 1827\u20131855.

Brown and RISD students can cross-register at the two institutions, with Brown students permitted to take as many as four courses at RISD that count towards a Brown degree. The two institutions partner to provide various student-life services and the two student bodies compose a synergy in the College Hill cultural scene.\n\nAfter several years of discussion between the two institutions and several students pursuing dual degrees unofficially, Brown and RISD formally established a five-year dual degree program in 2007, with the first class matriculating in the fall of 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/2007-08/07-013.html|title=07-013 (Brown/RISD Joint Degree)|website=www.brown.edu|access-date=2018-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818025835/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/2007-08/07-013.html|archive-date=August 18, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> The Brown/RISD Dual Degree Program, among the most selective in the country, offered admission to 19 of the 707 applicants for the class entering in autumn 2018, an acceptance rate of 2.7 percent.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite web|url=https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/03/admission|title=News from Brown - With record applications, Brown admits 2,566 to Class of 2022|last=|first=|date=|website=www.brown.edu|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180504155559/https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/03/admission|archive-date=May 4, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It combines the complementary strengths of the two institutions, integrating studio art and design at RISD with the entire spectrum of Brown's departmental offerings. Students are admitted to the Dual Degree Program for a course lasting five years and culminating in both the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) or Bachelor of Science (Sc.B.) degree from Brown and the Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree from RISD. Prospective students must apply to the two schools separately and be accepted by separate admissions committees. Their application must then be approved by a third Brown/RISD joint committee.\n\nAdmitted students spend the first year in residence at RISD completing its first-year Experimental and Foundation Studies curriculum, while taking up to three Brown classes. The second year is spent in residence at Brown, during which students take mainly Brown courses while starting on their RISD major requirements. In the third, fourth, and fifth years, students can elect to live at either school or off-campus, and course distribution is determined by the requirements of each student's unique combination of Brown concentration and RISD major. Program participants are noted for their creative and original approach to cross-disciplinary opportunities, combining, for example, industrial design with engineering, or anatomical illustration with human biology, or philosophy with sculpture, or architecture with urban studies. An annual \"BRDD Exhibition\" is a well-publicized and heavily attended event, drawing interest and attendees from the wider world of industry, design, the media, and the fine arts.\n\n[[File:BrownUniversity-LymanHall.jpg|thumb|left|221x221px|Lyman Hall, built 1890\u201392, designed by [[Stone, Carpenter & Willson|Stone, Carpenter and Willson]] in [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] style, houses the Department of Theatre Arts and Performance Studies]]\n\n===Theatre and playwriting===\nBrown's theatre and playwriting programs are among the best-regarded in the country.

The undergraduate concentration (major) in literary arts offers courses in fiction, poetry, screenwriting, literary hypermedia, and translation. Graduate programs include the fiction and poetry MFA writing programs in the literary arts department, and the MFA playwriting program in the theatre arts and performance studies department. The non-fiction writing program is offered in the English department. Screenwriting and cinema narrativity courses are offered in the departments of literary arts and modern culture and media. The undergraduate writing proficiency requirement is supported by the Writing Center.\n\n===Author prizewinners===\nAlumni authors take their degrees across the spectrum of degree concentrations, but a gauge of the strength of writing at Brown is the number of major national writing prizes won.

Three Brown undergraduate concentrations (majors) are hosted by the Watson Institute\u2014Development Studies, International Relations, and Public Policy. Graduate programs offered at the Watson Institute include the Graduate Program in Development (Ph.D.) and the Public Policy Program (M.P.A). The Institute also offers Post Doctoral, professional development and global outreach programming. In support of these programs, the Institute houses various centers, including the Brazil Initiative, Brown-India Initiative, China Initiative, Middle East Studies center, The Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS) and the Taubman Center for Public Policy. In recent years, the most internationally cited product of the Watson Institute has been its [[Casualties of the Iraq War|Costs of War Project]], first released in 2011 and continuously updated. The Project comprises a team of economists, anthropologists, political scientists, legal experts, and physicians, and seeks to calculate the economic costs, human casualties, and impact on civil liberties of the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan since 2001.\n\n[[File:Slater_Hall,_Brown_University.jpg|thumb|left|240px|upright|Slater Hall, built 1879, designed by [[Stone, Carpenter & Willson|Stone and Carpenter]] in [[High Victorian Gothic|Ruskinian Gothic]] style.

In 1916, the departments of electrical, mechanical, and civil engineering were merged into a Division of Engineering, and in 2010 the division was elevated to a School of Engineering.\n\nEngineering at Brown is especially interdisciplinary. The School is organized without the traditional departments or boundaries found at most schools, and follows a model of connectivity between disciplines\u2014including biology, medicine, physics, chemistry, computer science, the humanities and the social sciences. The School practices an innovative clustering of faculties in which engineers team with non-engineers to bring a convergence of ideas.\n\n===IE Brown Executive MBA Dual Degree Program===\nSince 2009, Brown has developed an Executive MBA program in conjunction with one of the leading Business Schools in Europe; [[IE Business School]] in Madrid.

Examples of program houses are [[St. Anthony Hall]] (located in King House), Buxton International House, the Machado [[French language|French]]/[[Hispanic]]/Latinx House, Technology House, Harambee (African culture) House, Social Action House and [[Interfaith]] House.\n\nCurrently,{{When|date=May 2017}} there are three student cooperative houses at Brown.

The Pronouncing Society is mentioned in the diary of [[Solomon Drowne]], class of 1773, who was voted its president in 1771. It seems to have disappeared during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. We next hear of the Misokosmian Society, founded in 1794 and renamed the Philermenian Society in 1798. This was effectively a secret society with membership limited to 45. It met fortnightly to hear speeches and debate and thrived until the Civil War; in 1821 its library held 1594 volumes. In 1799, a chapter of the Philandrian Society, also secret, was established at the College. In 1806, the United Brothers was formed as an egalitarian alternative to the Philermenian Society. \"These two great rivals,\" says the university historian, \"divided the student body between them for many years, surviving into the days of President Sears. A tincture of political controversy sharpened their rivalry, the older society inclining to the aristocratic Federals, the younger to the Republicans, the democrats of that day. ... The students continuing to increase in number, they outran the constitutional limits of both societies, and a third, the Franklin Society, was established in 1824; it never had the vitality of the other two, however, and died after ten years.\"<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], p. 181.</ref> Other nineteenth century clubs and societies, too numerous to treat here, are described in Bronson's history of the university.<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 120, 147\u2013148, 180\u2013182, 239\u2013244, 348\u2013349 & 483\u2013484.</ref>\n\n[[File:BrownUniversity-Poster1914.jpg|thumb|right|160px|upright|The sesquicentennial poster]]\nThe Cammarian Club\u2014founded in 1893 and taking its name from the Latin for lobster, its members' favorite dinner food\u2014was at first a semi-secret society which \"tapped\" 15 seniors each year. In 1915, self-perpetuating membership gave way to popular election by the student body, and thenceforward the Club served as the ''de facto'' undergraduate student government. In 1971, unaccountably, it voted the name Cammarian Club out of existence, thereby amputating its tradition and longevity. The successor and present-day organization is the generically-named Undergraduate Council of Students.\n\n[[Societas Domi Pacificae]], known colloquially as \"Pacifica House,\" is a present-day, self-described secret society, which nonetheless publishes a website and an email address. It claims a continuous line of descent from the Franklin Society of 1824, citing a supposed intermediary \"Franklin Society\" traceable in the nineteenth century. But the intermediary turns out to be, on closer inspection, the well-known Providence Franklin Society, a civic organization unconnected to Brown whose origins and activity are well-documented. It was founded in 1821 by merchants William Grinnell and Joseph Balch, Jr., and chartered by the General Assembly in January 1823.<ref>Rhode Island Historical Society, \"Providence Franklin Society Records, 1826-1922,\" published online at [http://www.rihs.org/mssinv/Mss162.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924091221/http://www.rihs.org/mssinv/Mss162.htm |date=September 24, 2015 }}</ref> The \"Pacifica House\" account of this (conflated) Franklin Society cites published mentions of it in 1859, 1876, and 1883. But the first of these (Rhees 1859, see footnote ''infra'') is merely a sketch of the 1824 Brown organization; the second (Stockwell 1876) is a reference-book article on the Providence Franklin Society itself; and the third is the Providence Franklin Society's own publication, which the \"Pacifica House\" reference mis-ascribes to the \"Franklin Society,\" dropping the word \"Providence.\"<ref>The three cited items of \"evidence\" in Pacifica House publicity are William J. Rhees, ''Manual of Public Libraries, Institutions and Societies in the United States'' (Philadelphia, 1859), pp. 437-8; Thomas B. Stockwell, ''A History of Public Education in Rhode Island, from 1636 to 1876'' (Providence, 1876), p. 246; and Providence Franklin Society, ''Report on the Geology of Rhode Island'' (Providence, 1887, commissioned 1883), for which see, e.g., ''Bulletin of the United States Geological Survey'', no. 127 (Washington, 1896), p. 821)</ref>\n\n=== Student organizations ===\n{{See also|Category:Brown University organizations}}\nThere are over 300 registered student organizations on campus with diverse interests.

That for this End ... it will be necessary ... to erect a public Building or Buildings for the boarding of the youth & the Residence of the Professors.</blockquote>\n\nThe three petitioners were [[Ezra Stiles]], pastor of Newport's [[Clarke Street Meeting House|Second Congregational Church]] and future president of [[Yale University|Yale]]; [[William Ellery|William Ellery, Jr.]], future [[Signing of the United States Declaration of Independence|signer]] of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]; and [[Josias Lyndon]], future governor of the colony. Stiles and Ellery were co-authors of the Charter of the College two years later. The editor of Stiles's papers observes, \"This draft of a petition connects itself with other evidence of Dr. Stiles's project for a Collegiate Institution in Rhode Island, before the charter of what became Brown University.\"<ref>[[#Dexter|Dexter (1916)]], p. 25.</ref>\n\nThere is further documentary evidence that Stiles was making plans for a college in 1762. On January 20, Chauncey Whittelsey, pastor of the First Church of New Haven, answered a letter from Stiles:<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 13\u201314.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The week before last I sent you the Copy of Yale College Charter ... Should you make any Progress in the Affair of a Colledge, I should be glad to hear of it; I heartily wish you Success therein.</blockquote>\n\nThe Philadelphia Association of Baptist Churches also had an eye on Rhode Island, home of the mother church of their denomination: the [[First Baptist Church in America]], founded in Providence in 1638 by [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]]. The Baptists were as yet unrepresented among colonial colleges; the [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregationalists]] had [[Harvard]] and [[Yale]], the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] had the College of New Jersey (later [[Princeton University|Princeton]]), and the [[Church of England|Episcopalians]] had the [[College of William and Mary]] and King's College (later [[Columbia University|Columbia]]). Isaac Backus was the historian of the New England Baptists and an inaugural Trustee of Brown, writing in 1784. He described the October 1762 resolution taken at Philadelphia:<ref>Isaac Backus, ''A History of New-England'', 3 vols. (Boston, 1777\u201396), vol. 2, quoted in [[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], p. 8.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Philadelphia Association obtained such an acquaintance with our affairs, as to bring them to an apprehension that it was practicable and expedient to erect a college in the Colony of Rhode-Island, under the chief direction of the Baptists; ... Mr. [[James Manning (minister)|James Manning]], who took his first degree in New-Jersey college in September, 1762, was esteemed a suitable leader in this important work.</blockquote>\n\nManning arrived at [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] in July 1763 and was introduced to Stiles, who agreed to write the Charter for the College. Stiles's first draft was read to the [[Rhode Island General Assembly|General Assembly]] in August 1763 and rejected by Baptist members who worried that the College Board of Fellows would under-represent the Baptists. A revised Charter written by Stiles and Ellery was adopted by the Assembly on March 3, 1764.\n\nIn September 1764, the inaugural meeting of the College Corporation was held at Newport. Governor [[Stephen Hopkins (politician)|Stephen Hopkins]] was chosen chancellor, former and future governor [[Samuel Ward (American statesman)|Samuel Ward]] was vice chancellor, [[John Tillinghast]] treasurer, and [[Thomas Eyres]] secretary. The Charter stipulated that the Board of Trustees be composed of 22 Baptists, five [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]], five Episcopalians, and four Congregationalists. Of the 12 Fellows, eight should be Baptists\u2014including the College president\u2014\"and the rest indifferently of any or all Denominations.\"<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 502\u2013503; the Charter and its drafts and associated documents are printed in [[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 493\u2013507; and in [[#Guild|Guild (1867)]], pp. 119\u2013146.</ref>\n\nThe Charter was not the grant of [[King George III]], as is sometimes supposed, but rather an Act of the colonial General Assembly. In two particulars, the Charter may be said to be a uniquely progressive document. First, other colleges had curricular strictures against opposing doctrines, while Brown's Charter asserted, \"Sectarian differences of opinions, shall not make any Part of the Public and Classical Instruction.\" Second, according to Brown University historian Walter Bronson, \"the instrument governing Brown University recognized more broadly and fundamentally than any other the principle of denominational cooperation.\"<ref name=\"Bronson, pp. 29-33\"/> The oft-repeated statement is inaccurate that Brown's Charter alone prohibited a religious test for College membership; other college charters were also liberal in that particular.\n\n[[File:Brown University 1792 engraving.jpg|thumb|right|[[University Hall (Brown University)|University Hall]] (right) and president's house, engraving 1792]]\n[[James Manning (minister)|James Manning]] was sworn in as the College's first president in 1765 and served until 1791. In 1770, the College moved from [[Warren, Rhode Island]] to the crest of [[College Hill, Providence, Rhode Island|College Hill]] overlooking Providence. [[Solomon Drowne]], a freshman in the class of 1773, wrote in his diary on March 26, 1770:<ref>Quoted in [[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 54\u201355.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>This day the Committee for settling the spot for the College, met at the New-Brick School House, when it was determined it should be set on ye Hill opposite Mr. John Jenkes; up the Presbyterian Lane.</blockquote>\n\nPresbyterian Lane is the present College Street. The eight-acre site had been purchased in two parcels by the Corporation for \u00a3219, mainly from [[Moses Brown]] and [[John Brown (Rhode Island)|John Brown]], the parcels having \"formed a part of the original home lots of their ancestor, [[Chad Brown (minister)|Chad Brown]], and of George Rickard, who bought them from the Indians.\" [[University Hall (Brown University)|University Hall]] was known as \"The College Edifice\" until 1823; it was modelled on [[Nassau Hall]] at the College of New Jersey.

In fact, Brown University was named for Nicholas Brown, Jr.\u2014philanthropist, founder of the [[Providence Athenaeum]], co-founder of [[Butler Hospital]], and an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]].

The Pembroke campus is centered on a quadrangle that fronts on Meeting Street, where a garden and monument\u2014with scale-model of the quadrangle in bronze\u2014compose the formal entry to the campus. The Pembroke campus is among the most pleasing spaces at Brown, with noteworthy examples of Victorian and Georgian architecture. The west side of the quadrangle comprises Pembroke Hall (1897), Smith-Buonanno Hall (1907, formerly Pembroke Gymnasium), and Metcalf Hall (1919); the east side comprises Alumnae Hall (1927) and Miller Hall (1910); the quadrangle culminates on the north with Andrews Hall (1947) and its terrace and garden.

Restaurants, cafes, bistros, taverns, pubs, bookstores, second-hand shops, and the like abound. Tourists, people-watchers, buskers, and students from Providence's six colleges make the scene. Half a mile south of campus is Thayer Street's hipper cousin, [[Wickenden Street]]. More picturesque and with older architecture, it features galleries, pubs, specialty shops, artist-supply stores, and a regionally famous coffee shop that doubles as a film set (for [[Woody Allen]] and others).\n\n[[Brown Stadium]], which was built in 1925 and is home to the football team, is located approximately a mile to the northeast of the main campus.

Students are admitted to the Dual Degree Program for a course lasting five years and culminating in both the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) or Bachelor of Science (Sc.B.) degree from Brown and the Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree from RISD. Prospective students must apply to the two schools separately and be accepted by separate admissions committees. Their application must then be approved by a third Brown/RISD joint committee.\n\nAdmitted students spend the first year in residence at RISD completing its first-year Experimental and Foundation Studies curriculum, while taking up to three Brown classes. The second year is spent in residence at Brown, during which students take mainly Brown courses while starting on their RISD major requirements. In the third, fourth, and fifth years, students can elect to live at either school or off-campus, and course distribution is determined by the requirements of each student's unique combination of Brown concentration and RISD major. Program participants are noted for their creative and original approach to cross-disciplinary opportunities, combining, for example, industrial design with engineering, or anatomical illustration with human biology, or philosophy with sculpture, or architecture with urban studies.

It is one of only a handful of such departments in the United States. The curricular focus is on three principal areas: Egyptology (the study of the ancient languages, history, and culture of Egypt), Assyriology (the study of the ancient lands of present-day Iraq, Syria, and Turkey), and the history of the ancient exact sciences (astronomy, astrology, and mathematics). Many courses in the department are open to all Brown undergraduates without prerequisite, and include archaeology, languages, history, and Egyptian and Mesopotamian religions, literature, and science. Students concentrating (majoring) in the department choose a track of either Egyptology or Assyriology. Graduate level study comprises three tracks to the doctoral degree: Egyptology, Assyriology, or the History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity.\n\n[[File:BrownUniversity-WatsonInstitute.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Watson Institute for International Studies|Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs]], built 2000\u20132002, designed by [[Rafael Vi\u00f1oly]]]]\n\n=== The Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs ===\n{{Main|Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs}}\nThe Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs is a center for the study of global issues and public affairs and is one of the leading institutes of its type in the country.

The Pronouncing Society is mentioned in the diary of [[Solomon Drowne]], class of 1773, who was voted its president in 1771. It seems to have disappeared during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. We next hear of the Misokosmian Society, founded in 1794 and renamed the Philermenian Society in 1798. This was effectively a secret society with membership limited to 45. It met fortnightly to hear speeches and debate and thrived until the Civil War; in 1821 its library held 1594 volumes. In 1799, a chapter of the Philandrian Society, also secret, was established at the College. In 1806, the United Brothers was formed as an egalitarian alternative to the Philermenian Society. \"These two great rivals,\" says the university historian, \"divided the student body between them for many years, surviving into the days of President Sears. A tincture of political controversy sharpened their rivalry, the older society inclining to the aristocratic Federals, the younger to the Republicans, the democrats of that day. ... The students continuing to increase in number, they outran the constitutional limits of both societies, and a third, the Franklin Society, was established in 1824; it never had the vitality of the other two, however, and died after ten years.\"<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], p. 181.</ref> Other nineteenth century clubs and societies, too numerous to treat here, are described in Bronson's history of the university.<ref>[[#Bronson|Bronson (1914)]], pp. 120, 147\u2013148, 180\u2013182, 239\u2013244, 348\u2013349 & 483\u2013484.</ref>\n\n[[File:BrownUniversity-Poster1914.jpg|thumb|right|160px|upright|The sesquicentennial poster]]\nThe Cammarian Club\u2014founded in 1893 and taking its name from the Latin for lobster, its members' favorite dinner food\u2014was at first a semi-secret society which \"tapped\" 15 seniors each year. In 1915, self-perpetuating membership gave way to popular election by the student body, and thenceforward the Club served as the ''de facto'' undergraduate student government. In 1971, unaccountably, it voted the name Cammarian Club out of existence, thereby amputating its tradition and longevity. The successor and present-day organization is the generically-named Undergraduate Council of Students.\n\n[[Societas Domi Pacificae]], known colloquially as \"Pacifica House,\" is a present-day, self-described secret society, which nonetheless publishes a website and an email address. It claims a continuous line of descent from the Franklin Society of 1824, citing a supposed intermediary \"Franklin Society\" traceable in the nineteenth century. But the intermediary turns out to be, on closer inspection, the well-known Providence Franklin Society, a civic organization unconnected to Brown whose origins and activity are well-documented. It was founded in 1821 by merchants William Grinnell and Joseph Balch, Jr., and chartered by the General Assembly in January 1823.<ref>Rhode Island Historical Society, \"Providence Franklin Society Records, 1826-1922,\" published online at [http://www.rihs.org/mssinv/Mss162.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924091221/http://www.rihs.org/mssinv/Mss162.htm |date=September 24, 2015 }}</ref> The \"Pacifica House\" account of this (conflated) Franklin Society cites published mentions of it in 1859, 1876, and 1883. But the first of these (Rhees 1859, see footnote ''infra'') is merely a sketch of the 1824 Brown organization; the second (Stockwell 1876) is a reference-book article on the Providence Franklin Society itself; and the third is the Providence Franklin Society's own publication, which the \"Pacifica House\" reference mis-ascribes to the \"Franklin Society,\" dropping the word \"Providence.\"<ref>The three cited items of \"evidence\" in Pacifica House publicity are William J. Rhees, ''Manual of Public Libraries, Institutions and Societies in the United States'' (Philadelphia, 1859), pp. 437-8; Thomas B. Stockwell, ''A History of Public Education in Rhode Island, from 1636 to 1876'' (Providence, 1876), p. 246; and Providence Franklin Society, ''Report on the Geology of Rhode Island'' (Providence, 1887, commissioned 1883), for which see, e.g., ''Bulletin of the United States Geological Survey'', no. 127 (Washington, 1896), p. 821)</ref>\n\n=== Student organizations ===\n{{See also|Category:Brown University organizations}}\nThere are over 300 registered student organizations on campus with diverse interests.

The centers often act as sources of support as well as safe spaces for students to explore certain aspects of their identity. Additionally, the centers often provide physical spaces for students to study and have meetings. Although most centers are identity-focused, some provide academic support as well.\n\n[[File:BrownUniversity-PartridgeHall.jpg|thumb|left|The Brown Center for Students of Color]]\n\nThe [[Brown Center for Students of Color]] (BCSC) is a space that provides support for students [[People of color|of color]].

Studies looking at the morphology of sauropod necks have concluded that the neutral posture of ''diplodonculus'' neck was close to horizontal, rather than vertical, and scientists such as Kent Stevens have used this to argue that sauropods including ''diplodonculus'' did not raise their heads much above shoulder level.<ref name=\"stevens05\">{{cite book |vauthors=Stevens KA, Parrish JM |year=2005 |chapter=Neck Posture, Dentition and Feeding Strategies in Jurassic Sauropod Dinosaurs |editor=Carpenter, Kenneth |editor2=Tidswell, Virginia |title=Thunder Lizards: The Sauropodomorph Dinosaurs |pages=212\u2013232 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-34542-4}}</ref><ref name=\"Upchurch2000\">{{cite journal |last=Upchurch |first=P |title=Neck Posture of Sauropod Dinosaurs |journal=Science |volume=287 |page=547b |doi=10.1126/science.287.5453.547b |year=2000 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/287/5453/547b.pdf |accessdate=November 28, 2006 |issue=5453 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> A [[nuchal ligament]] may have held the neck in this position.<ref name=\"stevens05\"/> A 2009 study found that all [[tetrapod]]s appear to hold the base of their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture, and argued that the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from other animals. The study found faults with Stevens' assumptions regarding the potential range of motion in sauropod necks, and based on comparing skeletons to living animals the study also argued that soft tissues could have increased flexibility more than the bones alone suggest.

Studies looking at the morphology of sauropod necks have concluded that the neutral posture of ''diplodonculus'' neck was close to horizontal, rather than vertical, and scientists such as Kent Stevens have used this to argue that sauropods including ''diplodonculus'' did not raise their heads much above shoulder level.<ref name=\"stevens05\">{{cite book |vauthors=Stevens KA, Parrish JM |year=2005 |chapter=Neck Posture, Dentition and Feeding Strategies in Jurassic Sauropod Dinosaurs |editor=Carpenter, Kenneth |editor2=Tidswell, Virginia |title=Thunder Lizards: The Sauropodomorph Dinosaurs |pages=212\u2013232 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-34542-4}}</ref><ref name=\"Upchurch2000\">{{cite journal |last=Upchurch |first=P |title=Neck Posture of Sauropod Dinosaurs |journal=Science |volume=287 |page=547b |doi=10.1126/science.287.5453.547b |year=2000 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/287/5453/547b.pdf |accessdate=November 28, 2006 |issue=5453 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> A [[nuchal ligament]] may have held the neck in this position.<ref name=\"stevens05\"/> A 2009 study found that all [[tetrapod]]s appear to hold the base of their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture, and argued that the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from other animals. The study found faults with Stevens' assumptions regarding the potential range of motion in sauropod necks, and based on comparing skeletons to living animals the study also argued that soft tissues could have increased flexibility more than the bones alone suggest.

A 1992 [[Columbia University]] study of diplodocid neck structure indicated that the longest necks would have required a 1.6-ton heart \u2014 a tenth of the animal's body weight. The study proposed that animals like these would have had rudimentary auxiliary \"hearts\" in their necks, whose only purpose was to pump blood up to the next \"heart\".<ref name=\"UDB\"/> Some argue that the near-horizontal posture of the head and neck would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain, as it would not be elevated.<ref name=Stevens/>\n\n===Diet and feeding===\n[[File:Diplodocus longus Chicago.jpg|thumb|Cast of a diplodocid skull that may belong to a species of ''diplodonculus'' (CM 11161)]]\nDiplodocines have highly unusual teeth compared to other sauropods.

The documentary ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'' portrayed a mother ''diplodonculus'' using an [[ovipositor]] to lay eggs, but it was pure speculation on the part of the documentary author.<ref name=wwdinos/> For ''diplodonculus'' and other sauropods, the size of clutches and individual eggs were surprisingly small for such large animals. This appears to have been an adaptation to predation pressures, as large eggs would require greater incubation time and thus would be at greater risk.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Ruxton, Graeme D. |author2=Birchard, Geoffrey F. |author3=Deeming, D Charles |year=2014|title=Incubation time as an important influence on egg production and distribution into clutches for sauropod dinosaurs|journal=Paleobiology|volume=40|issue=3|pages=323\u2013330|doi=10.1666/13028}}</ref>\n\nBased on a number of bone [[histology]] studies, ''diplodonculus'', along with other sauropods, grew at a very fast rate, reaching [[sexual maturity]] at just over a decade, and continued to grow throughout their lives.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Sander, P.
