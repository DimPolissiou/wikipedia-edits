Through trading and conquest, Mycenaean civilization spread its influence from [[Mycenae]] to many parts of the Mediterranean region and Europe.  Mycenaean bronze double axes and other objects ([[Rillaton Barrow]], [[Pelynt]] Dagger) dating from the thirteenth century BC have been found in Ireland and in [[Wessex]] and [[Cornwall]] in England, proving at least indirect Greek contact with Ireland and Great Britain at the time.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/ancientgreeksint0000budi/page/53 <!-- quote=mycenaeans england wessex. --> The Ancient Greeks: An Introduction], Stephanie Lynn Budin, Oxford University press</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LTbc1GIAwcIC&pg=PA91&dq=mycenaeans&cd=2#v=onepage&q=mycenaeans&f=false The Celtic Encyclopedia]</ref><ref>The Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 13</ref><ref>Bryan Avery Feuer, ''Mycenaean civilization: an annotated bibliography through 2002'', McFarland & Co Inc, 2004</ref>\n\n==== Pytheas ====\nThe first known Greek to come to Britain was [[Pytheas]] ({{lang-el|\u03a0\u03c5\u03b8\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2}}) who lived in late 4th and early 3rd centuries BC.

They were from [[Constantinople]], the capital of Byzantium.<ref name=\"Stradioti\"/>\nIn 1445, the king of England, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] (1421\u20131471), granted the brothers permission to remain in London and to practise their trade of gold wire drawing. They made a costly type of thread in which thin strands of gold were intertwined with silk, and which was then used in expensive luxury fabrics and in sacerdotal vestments, a craft for which Constantinople had been famous in its heyday. Thanks to this royal grant, the brothers remained in London for many years.<ref name=\"Stradioti\"/> They lived first in the area of [[Cripplegate]], much of which is now covered by the [[Barbican Centre]], and later they moved to Broad Street, in what was then the [[Italians|Italian]] quarter of London. Andronikos, the elder, died in about 1472, but Alexios was still there in 1484, over forty years after his first arrival.<ref name=\"Stradioti\"/>\n\nThat set the pattern for Greek settlement over the next two hundred years.

A few individuals settled permanently, such as a native of [[Rhodes]] called Konstantinos Benetos, who was recorded as living in [[Clerkenwell]] between 1530 and 1578. These visitors, refugees and occasional long-term residents did not, as yet, constitute a community. They were too few, too obscure and too transitory, and above all they lacked the one thing that would have given them cohesion and a common identity: a church where they could practise their Orthodox faith.<ref name=\"Landulph Church\"/>\nNikodemos Metaxas, a printer by trade, worked in London for a time in the 1620s. Some came as refugees, seeking asylum or financial help as a result of misfortunes suffered under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. One of them was Gregorios Argyropoulos, the owner of an estate near [[Thessaloniki]].<ref name=\"Landulph Church\"/> When a [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]] soldier was accidentally killed on Argyropoulos' land, the Ottoman authorities held him responsible and forced him to flee overseas and eventually to London in 1633.

Numbers had also increased.<ref name=\"Landulph Church\"/> The expansion of Britain's overseas trade with the [[Levant]] brought many more merchant ships to the port of London, some of them crewed by Greeks. The time was therefore ripe to press for the establishment of a Greek Church.<ref name=\"Landulph Church\"/>\n\nIn 1676 about one hundred families from the islands of [[Samos]] and [[Melos]] under the bishop Joseph Georgarinis migrated to England. Assisted by Konstantinos Rhodokanakis they were welcomed by the then Duke of York who later became King James II. They were granted settlements in Crown Str, Soho, later renamed to \"Greek Str.\".\n\nThe first documented organised [[Greek Orthodox]] community was established in London in the 1670s, with the first Greek Orthodox Church in London being erected in 1677,<ref name=\"History of the Greek Orthodox Cathedral\">[http://www.stsophia.org.uk/stsophia.htm History of the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sophia (Divine Wisdom)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705195123/http://www.stsophia.org.uk/stsophia.htm |date=5 July 2008 }}. www.stsophia.org.uk/stsophia.htm.</ref> in [[Soho]], on the corner of [[Charing Cross Road]] and [[Greek Street]].

Through trading and conquest, Mycenaean civilization spread its influence from [[Mycenae]] to many parts of the Mediterranean region and Europe.  Mycenaean bronze double axes and other objects ([[Rillaton Barrow]], [[Pelynt]] Dagger) dating from the thirteenth century BC have been found in Ireland and in [[Wessex]] and [[Cornwall]] in England, proving at least indirect Greek contact with Ireland and Great Britain at the time.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/ancientgreeksint0000budi/page/53 <!-- quote=mycenaeans england wessex. --> The Ancient Greeks: An Introduction], Stephanie Lynn Budin, Oxford University press</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LTbc1GIAwcIC&pg=PA91&dq=mycenaeans&cd=2#v=onepage&q=mycenaeans&f=false The Celtic Encyclopedia]</ref><ref>The Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 13</ref><ref>Bryan Avery Feuer, ''Mycenaean civilization: an annotated bibliography through 2002'', McFarland & Co Inc, 2004</ref>\n\n==== Pytheas ====\nThe first known Greek to come to Britain was [[Pytheas]] ({{lang-el|\u03a0\u03c5\u03b8\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2}}) who lived in late 4th and early 3rd centuries BC.

They were from [[Constantinople]], the capital of Byzantium.<ref name=\"Stradioti\"/>\nIn 1445, the king of England, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] (1421\u20131471), granted the brothers permission to remain in London and to practise their trade of gold wire drawing. They made a costly type of thread in which thin strands of gold were intertwined with silk, and which was then used in expensive luxury fabrics and in sacerdotal vestments, a craft for which Constantinople had been famous in its heyday. Thanks to this royal grant, the brothers remained in London for many years.<ref name=\"Stradioti\"/> They lived first in the area of [[Cripplegate]], much of which is now covered by the [[Barbican Centre]], and later they moved to Broad Street, in what was then the [[Italians|Italian]] quarter of London. Andronikos, the elder, died in about 1472, but Alexios was still there in 1484, over forty years after his first arrival.<ref name=\"Stradioti\"/>\n\nThat set the pattern for Greek settlement over the next two hundred years.

A few individuals settled permanently, such as a native of [[Rhodes]] called Konstantinos Benetos, who was recorded as living in [[Clerkenwell]] between 1530 and 1578. These visitors, refugees and occasional long- term residents did not, as yet, constitute a community. They were too few, too obscure and too transitory, and above all they lacked the one thing that would have given them cohesion and a common identity: a church where they could practise their Orthodox faith.<ref name=\"Landulph Church\"/>\nNikodemos Metaxas, a printer by trade, worked in London for a time in the 1620s. Some came as refugees, seeking asylum or financial help as a result of misfortunes suffered under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. One of them was Gregorios Argyropoulos, the owner of an estate near [[Thessaloniki]].<ref name=\"Landulph Church\"/> When a [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]] soldier was accidentally killed on Argyropoulos' land, the Ottoman authorities held him responsible and forced him to flee overseas and eventually to London in 1633.

A number of Greeks now occupied prominent positions in London life. Constantinos Rodocanachi of [[Chios]] had become one of the physicians to King Charles II (163 I -I 685) (PI. 1).<ref name=\"Landulph Church\"/> Georgios Constantinos of [[Skopelos]] had established the Grecian coffeehouse in Devereux court, just off the [[Strand, London|Strand]], and he could count [[Sir Isaac Newton]] and other members of the [[Royal Society]] among his clientele. Numbers had also increased.<ref name=\"Landulph Church\"/> The expansion of Britain's overseas trade with the [[Levant]] brought many more merchant ships to the port of London, some of them crewed by Greeks. The time was therefore ripe to press for the establishment of a Greek Church.<ref name=\"Landulph Church\"/>\n\nIn 1676 about one hundred families from the islands of [[Samos]] and [[Melos]] under the bishop Joseph Georgarinis migrated to England. Assisted by Konstantinos Rhodokanakis they were welcomed by the then Duke of York who later became King James II.

He came from a family which produced three generations of eminent lawyers, with the  father, son and grandson each bearing the name Gerald FitzGibbon.\n\n==Background and early career==\nHe was the elder of the two sons of [[Gerald Fitzgibbon (author)|Gerald FitzGibbon]], QC, Master in Chancery, and his wife Ellen Patterson of [[Belfast]]; his younger brother Henry (died 1912) was a distinguished doctor.<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''The Judges in Ireland 1221\u20131921''  London John Murray 1926 Vol. 2 p.372</ref> The younger Gerald  was educated at [[Trinity College Dublin]], where he was [[List of Scholars of Trinity College Dublin|elected a Scholar]]. He retained deep feelings of affection and loyalty towards Trinity College throughout his life, and gave evidence on its behalf before a Royal Commission in 1906.<ref>David Fitzgerald, \"Gerald FitzGibbon\" ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', 1912 Supplement, p.30</ref>\n\nHe entered [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1857. He was called to the [[Bar Council of Ireland|Irish Bar]] in 1860 and to the [[Barristers in England and Wales|English Bar]] the following year. He went on the [[Munster]] Circuit, where he quickly acquired a large practice. He was a fine lawyer and an eloquent public  speaker. [[Maurice Healy (writer)|Maurice Healy]] recalled his \"beautiful voice\", which  was sometimes compared  to that of the great Russian singer [[Feodor Chaliapin]]: this, combined with a certain natural acting ability, made his arguments extraordinarily persuasive.\n\nHis  Courtroom victories included the [[libel]] action ''O'Keeffe v Cardinal Cullen'', an unprecedented legal victory by a [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|Catholic priest]] against [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Paul Cullen (cardinal)|Paul Cullen]] (although the verdict was reversed on appeal).<ref>(1873) I.R. 7 C.L. 319; the alleged libel was in fact a sentence of suspension.</ref>\n\nAnother  triumph  was in the disputed [[Will (law)|will]] case  of ''Bagot v Bagot'', where he appeared for Mrs. Alice Bagot (ne Verner), daughter of [[Sir William Verner, 2nd Baronet]] and Mary Pakenham, and  widow of Christopher  Nevile Bagot,  of Aughrane Castle,  [[Justice of the Peace]] for [[County Galway]]. Her husband had denied [[paternity (law)|paternity]] of her son, William,  and [[inheritance|disinherited]]  him in favour  \nof Christopher's brother John. Fitzgibbon's eloquence, in the teeth of formidable medical evidence on the paternity issue  produced by  John Bagot, who was  the [[beneficiary]]  under  his brother's will,  persuaded the jury that  Christopher Bagot was under a temporary mental delusion when he wrote his will, and that the child was his.<ref>''[[The Spectator]] Archive'' 25 May 1878</ref>\n\nHaving initially declined to take silk in 1868, he became [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1872.<ref>Fitzgerald p.30</ref> He was a Bencher of the [[King's Inns]], and his portrait hangs in the Dining Hall there.\n\nIn 1876 he became [[Law Adviser to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], and the following year he became [[Solicitor General for Ireland]].<ref>Ball p.372</ref>\n\n==Lord Justice of Appeal==\nIn 1878 he was appointed to the Bench as [[Lord Justice]] of the [[Court of Appeal in Ireland]], with the general approval of the  legal profession and the Press, who praised both his political moderation and his legal ability. He  served on that Court with immense distinction for more than thirty years.\n\n===Reputation===\nThe old Court of Appeal  has been  described as  probably the strongest judicial tribunal ever to exist in Ireland, due to the presence of such exceptional judges as Fitzgibbon himself, [[Hugh Holmes]], [[Christopher Palles]] and [[Edward Gibson, 1st Baron Ashbourne|Lord Ashbourne]].  While Palles is usually regarded as the greatest of the  Irish judges of his time, some contemporaries thought that FitzGibbon was at least his equal: it is noteworthy that when the [[House of Lords]] heard  appeals from  decisions where FitzGibbon had dissented, they almost always preferred his view to that of his colleagues.<ref>Fitzgerald p.30</ref>\n\nMaurice Healy believed that FitzGibbon as a judge fell short of true greatness due to a certain lack of judicial impartiality, in that if he had a strong sympathy for one party to the appeal, he always found a way of deciding  the case  in their favour.<ref>Maurice Healy, ''The Old Munster Circuit'' (1939), Mecier Press edition, pp. 260\u20131</ref> On the other hand, Healy thought that the courtesy with which he conducted every appeal, and the deep interest he took in the legal arguments, made appearing in front of him \"an intellectual treat\".<ref>Healy p.260</ref> Delaney praises Fitzgibbon  both for his profound erudition and his innate sense of justice.<ref>V.T.H. Delaney, ''Christopher Palles'',  Allen Figgis and Co Dublin (1960) p.138</ref> However he  agrees with Healy that FitzGibbon, like Lord Ashbourne, was a pragmatist, who would always try to find in favour of the party he believed to have justice on their side, even if the precedents  pointed  the other way. Palles and Holmes, by contrast, although they were no less anxious to do justice between the parties, went strictly by the precedents.<ref>Delaney p.158</ref>\n\n===''Quinn v Leathem''===\nFitzgibbon went regularly on [[assizes]], most often to Belfast. It was there in 1896 that he sat as the trial judge, with a jury, in the controversial case of ''[[Quinn v Leathem]]''.<ref>[1901] A.C 495</ref> The House of Lords subsequently found that for several members of a [[trade union]] to ask a businessman only to deal with customers who employ union labour amounts to a [[conspiracy (civil)|conspiracy]] to injure him, even though such a request, when made by an individual, had previously been found by the same tribunal in ''[[Allen v Flood]]''<ref>[1898] A.C. 1</ref> to be perfectly lawful. While the judgment on appeal aroused great indignation among trade unions, FitzGibbon, from the report of his summing up to the jury, seems to have stated the law (as it stood at the time) correctly.\n\n===Judicial style===\nHis judgments were written in a clear, sharp and decisive style, often with an abrupt opening sentence such as:  \"I doubt that the [Court of]  King's Bench can have been conscious of the consequences of its decision in this case\".<ref>''Antrim County Land, Building and Investment Co. v Stewart'' [1904] 2 I.R 357</ref>\n\nA good example of his judicial style can be found in  ''Aaron's Reefs v Twiss'',<ref>[1895] 2 1R 207</ref> where the Court of Appeal were divided on the question of whether certain statements in a company's [[prospectus (finance)|prospectus]] were simply \"optimistic\" or actually [[fraudulent]]. FitzGibbon found that there is no legal difference between a company which omits crucial facts from its prospectus and one which deliberately misrepresents the facts, remarking that:  \"if a company cannot be floated if the whole truth be disclosed by its prospectus, it cannot be honestly launched at all\". To the argument that the application of this standard of commercial honesty would be fatal to most company prospectuses, he observed drily: \"So much the better\".<ref>[1895] 2 IR 207, at 269</ref>\n\n==Political and social life==\nHe was a  Conservative in politics, and a close friend of [[Lord Randolph Churchill]];<ref>Roy Jenkins, ''Churchill''  Macmillan London 2001, p.13</ref> it was in a letter to FitzGibbon in 1886 that Churchill remarked that to effectively oppose the support of [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]  for  [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish Home Rule]], \"the [[Orange Order|Orange]] card would be the one to play\".<ref>Kenneth Ferguson, ''King's Inns Barristers 1868\u20132004'', Dublin 2005 p.48</ref> Yet FitzGibbon  was noted for his political moderation: he had a wide circle of friends of differing political views, and his daughter Anne married a close relative of Gladstone. His house, Kilrock,<ref>Kilrock House still exists and is now operated by the Health Services Executive.</ref> on the Hill of [[Howth]], was one of the centres of Dublin social life: here he entertained not only his legal colleagues, but many of the leading Irish and  British politicians of the day.<ref>Ferguson p.48</ref> His Christmas parties at Kilrock were for many years one of the high points of the Dublin  social calendar.<ref>Ball p.322</ref>\n\nHe was a man of great erudition, and had numerous interests outside the law. He was a devoted member of the [[Church of Ireland]], and spoke eloquently in 1904 of his confidence in the future of \"the Church which I love\".<ref>Ferguson p.47</ref> He was a member of the [[General Synod]] of the Church: he was called the most influential  Protestant laymen of his time, and was rewarded with a statue in St. Patrick's Cathedral.<ref>Ferguson p.47</ref> At the same time he was an active [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], and contributed much of his time and money to Masonic causes and charities.<ref>Fitzgerald p.31</ref>\n\nHe took a deep interest in  the future of Irish education, and  chaired a committee on educational endowments from 1885 to 1897. He gave evidence to the Royal Commission on the future of Trinity College Dublin, and the [[University of Dublin]] in 1906.<ref>Delaney p.23</ref> He strongly defended the University's policy on the admission of [[Irish Catholic|Catholics]], pointing out that Chief Baron Palles - one of his most distinguished colleagues on the Bench - was a Catholic graduate of the same University, and shared FitzGibbon's deep attachment to it.<ref>Delaney p.23</ref> He generously praised [[Clongowes Wood College]], Palles' old school, as an example of the best of Roman Catholic education.<ref>Delaney p.23</ref>\n\nHe was a member of both the [[Privy Council of Ireland]] and from 1900 of the [[British Privy Council]].<ref>Ball p.372</ref>\n\n==Death and tributes==\nHe died rather suddenly at Kilrock on 14 October 1909. The next day the [[Lord Chief Justice of England]] in open court paid tribute to \"that great judge, profound lawyer and man of wide and varied learning\". This is apparently the only time an Irish judge has been honoured in this way.<ref>Fitzgerald p.31</ref> ''[[The Times]]'' paid him an equally glowing tribute, describing him as a man whose gifts could have easily seen him rise to the top of the political rather than the judicial sphere.\n\nHe is buried in old [[St. Fintan's Cemetery, Sutton]], near the ruined church. His statue (picture above) stands in the North Aisle of [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin]].<ref>FitzGerald p.31</ref>\n\n==Family==\nHe married in 1864 Margaret Ann FitzGerald, daughter of [[Francis Alexander FitzGerald]], Baron of the [[Court of Exchequer (Ireland)|Court of Exchequer]] and his wife Janet Burton. They had seven children, including  [[Gerald Fitzgibbon]] the third, who represented the [[University of Dublin (constituency)|University of Dublin]] from 1921 to 1923 and served as a judge of the [[Supreme Court of Ireland]] from 1924 to 1938.<ref>Ball p.372</ref> Of his daughters Janet married General  [[William Shone (British Army officer)|Sir William Shone]], and Anne married John Gladstone, great-nephew of the  celebrated statesman.<ref>Ferguson p.48</ref> The family were members of the [[Church of Ireland]].\n\n==In literature==\nHe appears briefly in ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by [[James Joyce]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:FitzGibbon, Gerald}}\n[[Category:Irish Anglicans]]\n[[Category:1837 births]]\n[[Category:1909 deaths]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Trinity College Dublin]]\n[[Category:Burials at St. Fintan's Cemetery, Sutton]]\n[[Category:Lords Justice of Appeal for Ireland]]\n[[Category:Members of Lincoln's Inn]]\n[[Category:Members of the Privy Council of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Scholars of Trinity College Dublin]]\n[[Category:Solicitors-General for Ireland]]\n[[Category:19th-century Irish judges]]\n[[Category:19th-century Irish lawyers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Irish English|date=April 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2015}}\n{{Infobox officeholder\n| honorific-prefix = [[The Right Honourable]]\n| name = Gerald FitzGibbon\n| honorific-suffix = \n| image = Dublin St. Patrick's Cathedral North Aisle Statue of Gerald Fitzgibbon 2012 09 26.jpg\n| imagesize=\n| caption = FitzGibbon's statue in St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin.\n| order1 = [[Court of Appeal in Ireland|Lord Justice of the Irish Court of Appeal]]\n| term_start1 = 1878\n| term_end1 = 1909\n| monarch1 = [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]]\n| predecessor1 = [[Rickard Deasy]]\n| successor1 = [[Charles Robert Barry]]\n| order2 = [[Solicitor-General for Ireland]]\n| term_start2 = 3 March 1877\n| term_end2 = 1878\n| monarch2 = [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]]\n| predecessor2 = [[David Plunket, 1st Baron Rathmore|Hon.

Fitzgibbon's eloquence, in the teeth of formidable medical evidence on the paternity issue  produced by  John Bagot, who was  the [[beneficiary]]  under  his brother's will,  persuaded the jury that  Christopher Bagot was under a temporary mental delusion when he wrote his will, and that the child was his.<ref>''[[The Spectator]] Archive'' 25 May 1878</ref>\n\nHaving initially declined to take silk in 1868, he became [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1872.<ref>Fitzgerald p.30</ref> He was a Bencher of the [[King's Inns]], and his portrait hangs in the Dining Hall there.\n\nIn 1876 he became [[Law Adviser to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], and the following year he became [[Solicitor General for Ireland]].<ref>Ball p.372</ref>\n\n==Lord Justice of Appeal==\nIn 1878 he was appointed to the Bench as [[Lord Justice]] of the [[Court of Appeal in Ireland]], with the general approval of the  legal profession and the Press, who praised both his political moderation and his legal ability. He  served on that Court with immense distinction for more than thirty years.\n\n===Reputation===\nThe old Court of Appeal  has been  described as  probably the strongest judicial tribunal ever to exist in Ireland, due to the presence of such exceptional judges as Fitzgibbon himself, [[Hugh Holmes]], [[Christopher Palles]] and [[Edward Gibson, 1st Baron Ashbourne|Lord Ashbourne]].  While Palles is usually regarded as the greatest of the  Irish judges, some contemporaries thought that FitzGibbon was at least his equal: it is noteworthy that when the [[House of Lords]] heard  appeals from  decisions where FitzGibbon had dissented, they almost always preferred his view to that of his colleagues.<ref>Fitzgerald p.30</ref>\n\nMaurice Healy believed that FitzGibbon as a judge fell short of true greatness due to a certain lack of judicial impartiality, in that if he had a strong sympathy for one party to the appeal, he always found a way of deciding  the case  in their favour.<ref>Maurice Healy, ''The Old Munster Circuit'' (1939), Mecier Press edition, pp. 260\u20131</ref> On the other hand, Healy thought that the courtesy with which he conducted every appeal, and the deep interest he took in the legal arguments, made appearing in front of him \"an intellectual treat\".<ref>Healy p.260</ref> Delaney praises Fitzgibbon  both for his profound erudition and his innate sense of justice.<ref>V.T.H. Delaney, ''Christopher Palles'',  Allen Figgis and Co Dublin (1960) p.138</ref> However he  agrees with Healy that FitzGibbon, like Lord Ashbourne, was a pragmatist, who would always try to find in favour of the party he believed to have justice on their side, even if the precedents  pointed  the other way. Palles and Holmes, by contrast, although they were no less anxious to do justice between the parties, went strictly by the precedents.<ref>Delaney p.158</ref>\n\n===''Quinn v Leathem''===\nFitzgibbon went regularly on [[assizes]], most often to Belfast. It was there in 1896 that he sat as the trial judge, with a jury, in the controversial case of ''[[Quinn v Leathem]]''.<ref>[1901] A.C 495</ref> The House of Lords subsequently found that for several members of a [[trade union]] to ask a businessman only to deal with customers who employ union labour amounts to a [[conspiracy (civil)|conspiracy]] to injure him, even though such a request, when made by an individual, had previously been found by the same tribunal in ''[[Allen v Flood]]''<ref>[1898] A.C. 1</ref> to be perfectly lawful. While the judgment on appeal aroused great indignation among trade unions, FitzGibbon, from the report of his summing up to the jury, seems to have stated the law (as it stood at the time) correctly.\n\n===Judicial style===\nHis judgments were written in a clear, sharp and decisive style, often with an abrupt opening sentence such as:  \"I doubt that the [Court of]  King's Bench can have been conscious of the consequences of its decision in this case\".<ref>''Antrim County Land, Building and Investment Co. v Stewart'' [1904] 2 I.R 357</ref>\n\nA good example of his judicial style can be found in  ''Aaron's Reefs v Twiss'',<ref>[1895] 2 1R 207</ref> where the Court of Appeal were divided on the question of whether certain statements in a company's [[prospectus (finance)|prospectus]] were simply \"optimistic\" or actually [[fraudulent]]. FitzGibbon found that there is no legal difference between a company which omits crucial facts from its prospectus and one which deliberately misrepresents the facts, remarking that:  \"if a company cannot be floated if the whole truth be disclosed by its prospectus, it cannot be honestly launched at all\". To the argument that the application of this standard of commercial honesty would be fatal to most company prospectuses, he observed drily: \"So much the better\".<ref>[1895] 2 IR 207, at 269</ref>\n\n==Political and social life==\nHe was a  Conservative in politics, and a close friend of [[Lord Randolph Churchill]];<ref>Roy Jenkins, ''Churchill''  Macmillan London 2001, p.13</ref> it was in a letter to FitzGibbon in 1886 that Churchill remarked that to effectively oppose the support of [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]  for  [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish Home Rule]], \"the [[Orange Order|Orange]] card would be the one to play\".<ref>Kenneth Ferguson, ''King's Inns Barristers 1868\u20132004'', Dublin 2005 p.48</ref> Yet FitzGibbon  was noted for his political moderation: he had a wide circle of friends of differing political views, and his daughter Anne married a close relative of Gladstone. His house, Kilrock,<ref>Kilrock House still exists and is now operated by the Health Services Executive.</ref> on the Hill of [[Howth]], was one of the centres of Dublin social life: here he entertained not only his legal colleagues, but many of the leading Irish and  British politicians of the day.<ref>Ferguson p.48</ref> His Christmas parties at Kilrock were for many years one of the high points of the Dublin  social calendar.<ref>Ball p.322</ref>\n\nHe was a man of great erudition, and had numerous interests outside the law. He was a devoted member of the [[Church of Ireland]], and spoke eloquently in 1904 of his confidence in the future of \"the Church which I love\".<ref>Ferguson p.47</ref> He was a member of the [[General Synod]] of the Church: he was called the most influential  Protestant laymen of his time, and was rewarded with a statue in St. Patrick's Cathedral.<ref>Ferguson p.47</ref> At the same time he was an active [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], and contributed much of his time and money to Masonic causes and charities.<ref>Fitzgerald p.31</ref>\n\nHe took a deep interest in  the future of Irish education, and  chaired a committee on educational endowments from 1885 to 1897. He gave evidence to the Royal Commission on the future of Trinity College Dublin, and the [[University of Dublin]] in 1906.<ref>Delaney p.23</ref> He strongly defended the University's policy on the admission of [[Irish Catholic|Catholics]], pointing out that Chief Baron Palles - one of his most distinguished colleagues on the Bench - was a Catholic graduate of the same University, and shared FitzGibbon's deep attachment to it.<ref>Delaney p.23</ref> He generously praised [[Clongowes Wood College]], Palles' old school, as an example of the best of Roman Catholic education.<ref>Delaney p.23</ref>\n\nHe was a member of both the [[Privy Council of Ireland]] and from 1900 of the [[British Privy Council]].<ref>Ball p.372</ref>\n\n==Death and tributes==\nHe died rather suddenly at Kilrock on 14 October 1909. The next day the [[Lord Chief Justice of England]] in open court paid tribute to \"that great judge, profound lawyer and man of wide and varied learning\". This is apparently the only time an Irish judge has been honoured in this way.<ref>Fitzgerald p.31</ref> ''[[The Times]]'' paid him an equally glowing tribute, describing him as a man whose gifts could have easily seen him rise to the top of the political rather than the judicial sphere.\n\nHe is buried in old [[St. Fintan's Cemetery, Sutton]], near the ruined church. His statue (picture above) stands in the North Aisle of [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin]].<ref>FitzGerald p.31</ref>\n\n==Family==\nHe married in 1864 Margaret Ann FitzGerald, daughter of [[Francis Alexander FitzGerald]], Baron of the [[Court of Exchequer (Ireland)|Court of Exchequer]] and his wife Janet Burton. They had seven children, including  [[Gerald Fitzgibbon]] the third, who represented the [[University of Dublin (constituency)|University of Dublin]] from 1921 to 1923 and served as a judge of the [[Supreme Court of Ireland]] from 1924 to 1938.<ref>Ball p.372</ref> Of his daughters Janet married General  [[William Shone (British Army officer)|Sir William Shone]], and Anne married John Gladstone, great-nephew of the  celebrated statesman.<ref>Ferguson p.48</ref> The family were members of the [[Church of Ireland]].\n\n==In literature==\nHe appears briefly in ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by [[James Joyce]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:FitzGibbon, Gerald}}\n[[Category:Irish Anglicans]]\n[[Category:1837 births]]\n[[Category:1909 deaths]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Trinity College Dublin]]\n[[Category:Burials at St. Fintan's Cemetery, Sutton]]\n[[Category:Lords Justice of Appeal for Ireland]]\n[[Category:Members of Lincoln's Inn]]\n[[Category:Members of the Privy Council of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Scholars of Trinity College Dublin]]\n[[Category:Solicitors-General for Ireland]]\n[[Category:19th-century Irish judges]]\n[[Category:19th-century Irish lawyers]]\n", "name_user": "Chrisdoyleorwell", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReputation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_FitzGibbon_(judge,_born_1837)"}

The main section, between South Tottenham and Woodgrange Park, was built as the [[Tottenham and Forest Gate Railway]], a joint project between the [[Midland Railway]] and the [[London, Tilbury and Southend Railway]]. This opened on 9 July 1894, linking the Midland and Great Eastern joint line at South Tottenham and the Forest Gate and Barking line at Woodgrange Park. The section west of South Tottenham was built as the [[Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway]], which opened in 1868 but had not been commercially successful as a stand-alone railway.\n\n=== Predecessor routes ===\nAlthough the route between Upper Holloway and Woodgrange Park has been constant, several stations have been the ends of the line. {{rws|Kentish Town}}, {{rws|St Pancras}}, {{rws|Gospel Oak}} and [[Moorgate station|Moorgate]] (via St Pancras) have all been the western termini. [[East Ham tube station|East Ham]] was an alternative eastern terminus for some time. Some trains were extended beyond Barking to destinations such as [[Southend Central railway station|Southend]] and [[Tilbury Riverside railway station|Tilbury]]. There was a regular boat train service between St Pancras and Tilbury.\n\nA connection to Gospel Oak was added in 1888, but the routes via Kentish Town remained the primary ones and the Gospel Oak branch was abandoned in 1926. The connection to East Ham was abandoned in 1958.\n\nThe ''Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway'' section of the line had stations that were closed due to  proximity to other stations or for other reasons. These include [[Highgate Road railway station|Highgate Road]] (closed 1918), [[Junction Road railway station|Junction Road]] (closed 1943), [[Hornsey Road railway station|Hornsey Road]] (closed 1943) and [[St Ann's Road railway station|St Ann's Road]] (closed 1942).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abandonedstations.org.uk/Goblin.html |title=London's Abandoned Stations |publisher=Abandonedstations.org.uk |date= |accessdate=11 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe line was considered for closure to passengers in 1963 as part of the [[Beeching Axe]],<ref>{{cite report|url=http://joycewhitchurch.zxq.net/maps/lonmap.jpg|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320095819/http://joycewhitchurch.zxq.net/maps/lonmap.jpg|archivedate=20 March 2014|title=Map 9A, from The Reshaping of Britain's Railways|year=1963|publisher=[[British Railways Board]]}}</ref> but local users protested and formed an action group to prevent closure. Beeching's proposals for London were not implemented for the most part, and the line remained open. Even so, it was allowed to fall into a poor state of repair and reliability,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.citymetric.com/transport/london-overground-s-gospel-oak-barking-line-electric-dreams-do-come-true-3968|title=On London Overground\u2019s Gospel Oak to Barking line, electric dreams do come true|work=CityMetric|date=11 June 2018|accessdate=12 September 2018}}</ref> and by 1980 had been cut back to an hourly service between Kentish Town and Barking. The station canopies were gradually demolished, ticket offices closed and staff withdrawn from stations.\n\n=== Introduction of the present route ===\nThe situation began to improve in 1981 when electrification and upgrades to the line out of {{rws|St Pancras}} (later part of [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]]) displaced the line from Kentish Town. A new link to Gospel Oak was built and the hourly service from Kentish Town was replaced by the current route from Gospel Oak with two trains per hour. The service remained very unreliable due to the age of the trains, which were initially Class [[British Rail Class 115|115]] and [[British Rail Class 108|108]] units, replaced in the early 1990s{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} by class [[British Rail Class 117|117]] and [[British Rail Class 121|121]] units.\n\n=== Private operators ===\n[[File:02.06.07 Gospel Oak 150.129 (5944678016).jpg|thumb|left|A Silverlink Class 150 at Gospel Oak]]\nInitially part of [[British Rail]] [[Network SouthEast]], the line was [[Privatisation of British Rail|privatised]] in 1994, the track being owned by [[Railtrack]] (subsequently [[Network Rail]]) with the passenger service provided by the North London Railways franchise. This passed to [[National Express]] in 1997, which operated the line under the brand name [[Silverlink]] until November 2007. Under Silverlink, the [[slam door trains]] were replaced by [[British Rail Class 150|Class 150]] units in 2000, which improved reliability significantly. There were minor improvements in station facilities (such as CCTV and information points) but no major investment to upgrade the line and boost capacity, and the stations remained unstaffed.\n\n=== London Overground ===\n[[File:Wanstead Park stn signage.JPG|thumb|Early London Overground branded signage at Wanstead Park|left]]\nMany lines within London were running at full capacity, and as a consequence the line took on a new strategic significance as a by-pass, relieving load on other lines by allowing passengers to travel between north and east London directly.\n\nThe [[Railways Act 2005]] abolished the franchise and gave the operation of passenger services to [[Transport for London]] (TfL). In 2005, TfL started funding a small number of additional peak time and late evening services to relieve the worst overcrowding.\n\nTfL took full control in November 2007 introducing improved late night and weekend services, and staff, ticket machines and [[Oyster card|Oyster]] equipment at all stations. The frequency was increased to three trains per hour during morning and afternoon peaks and the line was included on the [[Tube map]] for the first time.\n\nThe line was closed throughout most of September 2008 for upgrade work carried out by [[Network Rail]]. Capacity was increased from six trains per hour to eight (four each for passenger and goods trains). By replacing the overbridges carrying Sussex Way and Albert Road, and lowering the track in some other locations, it was made possible for [[Loading gauge#Great Britain|W10 loading gauge goods trains]] to operate.

The ticket machines can be used to load credit onto Oyster cards. Passengers are required to buy tickets or touch in their Oyster/contactless cards, or else face a [[penalty fare]].\n\nOwing to the lack of ticket barriers and the difficulty of ticket verification when trains are crowded, the line has historically had a high level of [[fare avoidance]]. Under Silverlink most stations lacked any ticket purchasing facilities. In theory, passengers could purchase tickets from the conductors on the trains, but it was not always possible to do this.

The main section, between South Tottenham and Woodgrange Park, was built as the [[Tottenham and Forest Gate Railway]], a joint project between the [[Midland Railway]] and the [[London, Tilbury and Southend Railway]]. This opened on 9 July 1894, linking the Midland and Great Eastern joint line at South Tottenham and the Forest Gate and Barking line at Woodgrange Park. The section west of South Tottenham was built as the [[Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway]], which opened in 1868 but had not been commercially successful as a stand-alone railway.\n\n=== Predecessor routes ===\nAlthough the route between Upper Holloway and Woodgrange Park has been constant, several stations have been the ends of the line. {{rws|Kentish Town}}, {{rws|St Pancras}}, {{rws|Gospel Oak}} and [[Moorgate station|Moorgate]] (via St Pancras) have all been the western termini. [[East Ham tube station|East Ham]] was an alternative eastern terminus for some time. Some trains were extended beyond Barking to destinations such as [[Southend Central railway station|Southend]] and [[Tilbury Riverside railway station|Tilbury]]. There was a regular boat train service between St Pancras and Tilbury.\n\nA connection to Gospel Oak was added in 1888, but the routes via Kentish Town remained the primary ones and the Gospel Oak branch was abandoned in 1926. The connection to East Ham was abandoned in 1958.\n\nThe ''Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway'' section of the line had stations that were closed due to  proximity to other stations or for other reasons. These include [[Highgate Road railway station|Highgate Road]] (closed 1918), [[Junction Road railway station|Junction Road]] (closed 1943), [[Hornsey Road railway station|Hornsey Road]] (closed 1943) and [[St Ann's Road railway station|St Ann's Road]] (closed 1942).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abandonedstations.org.uk/Goblin.html |title=London's Abandoned Stations |publisher=Abandonedstations.org.uk |date= |accessdate=11 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe line was considered for closure to passengers in 1963 as part of the [[Beeching Axe]],<ref>{{cite report|url=http://joycewhitchurch.zxq.net/maps/lonmap.jpg|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320095819/http://joycewhitchurch.zxq.net/maps/lonmap.jpg|archivedate=20 March 2014|title=Map 9A, from The Reshaping of Britain's Railways|year=1963|publisher=[[British Railways Board]]}}</ref> but local users protested and formed an action group to prevent closure. Beeching's proposals for London were not implemented for the most part, and the line remained open. Even so, it was allowed to fall into a poor state of repair and reliability,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.citymetric.com/transport/london-overground-s-gospel-oak-barking-line-electric-dreams-do-come-true-3968|title=On London Overground\u2019s Gospel Oak to Barking line, electric dreams do come true|work=CityMetric|date=11 June 2018|accessdate=12 September 2018}}</ref> and by 1980 had been cut back to an hourly service between Kentish Town and Barking. The station canopies were gradually demolished, ticket offices closed and staff withdrawn from stations.\n\n=== Introduction of the present route ===\nThe situation began to improve in 1981 when electrification and upgrades to the line out of {{rws|St Pancras}} (later part of [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]]) displaced the line from Kentish Town. A new link to Gospel Oak was built and the hourly service from Kentish Town was replaced by the current route from Gospel Oak with two trains per hour. The service remained very unreliable due to the age of the trains, which were initially Class [[British Rail Class 115|115]] and [[British Rail Class 108|108]] units, replaced in the early 1990s{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} by class [[British Rail Class 117|117]] and [[British Rail Class 121|121]] units.\n\n=== Private operators ===\n[[File:02.06.07 Gospel Oak 150.129 (5944678016).jpg|thumb|left|A Silverlink Class 150 at Gospel Oak]]\nInitially part of [[British Rail]] [[Network SouthEast]], the line was [[Privatisation of British Rail|privatised]] in 1994, the track being owned by [[Railtrack]] (subsequently [[Network Rail]]) with the passenger service provided by the North London Railways franchise. This passed to [[National Express]] in 1997, which operated the line under the brand name [[Silverlink]] until November 2007. Under Silverlink, the [[slam door trains]] were replaced by [[British Rail Class 150|Class 150]] units in 2000, which improved reliability significantly. There were minor improvements in station facilities (such as CCTV and information points) but no major investment to upgrade the line and boost capacity, and the stations remained unstaffed.\n\n=== London Overground ===\n[[File:Wanstead Park stn signage.JPG|thumb|Early London Overground branded signage at Wanstead Park|left]]\nMany lines within London were running at full capacity, and as a consequence the line took on a new strategic significance as a by-pass, relieving load on other lines by allowing passengers to travel between north and east London directly.\n\nThe [[Railways Act 2005]] abolished the franchise and gave the operation of passenger services to [[Transport for London]] (TfL). In 2005, TfL started funding a small number of additional peak time and late evening services to relieve the worst overcrowding.\n\nTfL took full control in November 2007 introducing improved late night and weekend services, and staff, ticket machines and [[Oyster card|Oyster]] equipment at all stations. The frequency was increased to three trains per hour during morning and afternoon peaks and the line was included on the [[Tube map]] for the first time.\n\nThe line was closed throughout most of September 2008 for upgrade work carried out by [[Network Rail]]. Capacity was increased from six trains per hour to eight (four each for passenger and goods trains). By replacing the overbridges carrying Sussex Way and Albert Road, and lowering the track in some other locations, it was made possible for [[Loading gauge#Great Britain|W10 loading gauge goods trains]] to operate.

The ticket machines can be used to load credit onto Oyster cards. Passengers are required to buy tickets or touch in their Oyster/contactless cards, or else face a [[penalty fare]].\n\nOwing to the lack of ticket barriers and the difficulty of ticket verification when trains are crowded, the line has historically had a high level of [[fare avoidance]]. Under Silverlink most stations lacked any ticket purchasing facilities. In theory, passengers could purchase tickets from the conductors on the trains, but it was not always possible to do this.

The neighbourhood is positioned between [[Hampstead]] to the north-west, [[Dartmouth Park]] to the north-east, [[Kentish Town]] to the south-east, and [[Belsize Park]] to the south-west. Gospel Oak lies across the NW5 and NW3 postcodes and is served by [[Gospel Oak station]] on the [[London Overground]].\nThe North London Suburb, Gospel Oak, has many schools around it.\n\n==History==\nThe name Gospel Oak derives from a local [[oak tree]], under which parishioners gathered to hear regular [[gospel]] readings when the area was still rural. The oak of Gospel Oak marked the boundary between the parishes of Hampstead and St Pancras, and was said to be situated on the corner of Mansfield Road and Southampton Road. The oak vanished sometime in the 1800s and was last recorded on a map of the area in 1801.<ref name=\"kentishtowner.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kentishtowner.co.uk/2012/03/14/wednesday-picture-where-the-hell-is-the-gospel-oak |title=Wednesday Picture: Where the hell is the Gospel Oak? |publisher=Kentishtowner |date=14 March 2012 |accessdate=16 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere are reports that the founder of [[Methodism]] [[John Wesley]] preached from the oak,<ref>Weinreb, Ben & [[Hibbert, Christopher]] (1983), ''[[The London Encyclopaedia]]'', Macmillan, {{ISBN|0-333-57688-8}}</ref> with the 18th century farming population meeting there regularly. The small street named Wesleyan Place, off Highgate Road, was the original site of a very early Methodist chapel that was connected with the famous oak.<ref name=KentishStreets>Denford, Steven (2005), ''Streets of Kentish Town'', Camden History Society, {{ISBN|0-904491-62-5}}</ref>\n\nLocal resident [[Michael Palin]] attempted in 1998 to re-plant a new oak tree for Gospel Oak in Lismore Circus, but the tree has not survived.<ref name=\"kentishtowner.co.uk\"/>\n\nThe history of Gospel Oak can be traced as far back as the history of [[Hampstead]], which was documented in AD 986 by Ethelred the Unready to the Abbot of Westminster.<ref>Richardson, John (1985), Hampstead One Thousand, Historical Publications, {{ISBN|0 9503656 8 8}}</ref> Situated as it is in the southern part of [[Hampstead Heath]], the area was, in years past, referred to as nearby South End Green. When the now-lost great oak tree of Gospel Oak became famous as a preaching spot in the 1700s, the area was referred to as Gospel Oak, and the name continues today.\n\nThe neighbourhood began serious development in the mid-1800s when [[William Murray, 4th Earl of Mansfield and Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], [[Lord Southampton]] and [[Lord Lisburne]] were the local landowners. Plans were drawn up for elegant streets radiating from Lismore Circus but after two railway lines were extended across the area in the 1860s the first buildings were two- and three-story cottages, based around present-day Oak Village. The area was for many years rather remote from the rest of the wider Kentish Town development and streets were not fully completed and the housing stock was regarded as relatively sub-standard.<ref>Richardson, John (1997), ''Kentish Town Past'', Historical Publications, {{ISBN|0-948667-42-7}}</ref>\n\nDuring this early building period, there was a risk that [[Parliament Hill Fields]] (the southernmost part of Hampstead Heath, entered from the \u2018Gospel Oak Entrance\u2019 near [[Gospel Oak station]]) would be built over. In the 1840s, Lord Southampton's estate initially proposed building on the fields, but a campaign led to the fields being bought in 1889 by the Metropolitan Board of Works as an extension to the already protected Hampstead Heath.<ref>Richardson, John (1999), A History of Camden, Hampstead, Holborn & St Pancras, Historical Publications, {{ISBN|0-948667-58-3}}</ref> The fields now host [[Parliament Hill, London|Parliament Hill]] itself, the [[Parliament Hill Lido]], an athletics running track, a bandstand, caf\u00e9 and various children's play areas.\n\nOn the evening of 2 September 1861, an excursion train returning from [[Kew Gardens]] hit an empty train on the bridge next to Gospel Oak station. The engine left the line and plunged down the embankment, killing 14 and injuring 300.<ref name=Town>Colloms, Marianne and Weindling, Dick (2009), ''Camden Town and Kentish Town'', [[Tempus Publishing]], {{ISBN|978-0-7524 2922-9}}</ref>\n\nA curious story of Victorian Gospel Oak relates to a story that appeared in the local press of the time, called \"The Elephants of Gospel Oak\". In March 1884, Sangers Circus was booked to perform at Gospel Oak (presumably on Parliament Hill Fields). Four [[elephants]] were transported by train to Kentish Town but on leaving the train, two of the elephants bolted and ran up Fortess Road, knocking over a child, running further beyond [[Tufnell Park]] station and ending up falling into cellars in Pemberton Gardens. The other two elephants were then drafted to pull out the trapped elephants using ropes. All four elephants then paraded down the streets of [[Dartmouth Park]], accompanied by hundreds of onlookers, arriving back at Gospel Oak where the elephants performed to packed audiences.<ref name=Town/>\n\nLater development including the areas of the Mansfield Conservation area to the west of Gospel Oak station led to the neighbourhood becoming more respectable and solidly residential - although in 1909 when [[John Betjeman]]'s family moved to the more affluent [[Highgate]] they obviously felt that they were a cut above Gospel Oak:\n<blockquote>Here from my eyrie, as the sun went down,<br>I heard the old [[North London Railway|North London]] puff and shunt,<br>Glad that I did not live in Gospel Oak.<ref>Betjeman, John (1960). ''[[Summoned by Bells]]'', p 5.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBombing during the 1940s and [[post-war regeneration]] affected Gospel Oak considerably.

The neighbourhood is positioned between [[Hampstead]] to the north-west, [[Dartmouth Park]] to the north-east, [[Kentish Town]] to the south-east, and [[Belsize Park]] to the south-west. Gospel Oak lies across the NW5 and NW3 postcodes and is served by [[Gospel Oak station]] on the [[London Overground]].\nThe North London Suburb, Gospel Oak, has many schools around it.\n\n==History==\nThe name Gospel Oak derives from a local [[oak tree]], under which parishioners gathered to hear regular [[gospel]] readings when the area was still rural. The oak of Gospel Oak marked the boundary between the parishes of Hampstead and St Pancras, and was said to be situated on the corner of Mansfield Road and Southampton Road. The oak vanished sometime in the 1800s and was last recorded on a map of the area in 1801.<ref name=\"kentishtowner.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kentishtowner.co.uk/2012/03/14/wednesday-picture-where-the-hell-is-the-gospel-oak |title=Wednesday Picture: Where the hell is the Gospel Oak? |publisher=Kentishtowner |date=14 March 2012 |accessdate=16 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere are reports that the founder of [[Methodism]] [[John Wesley]] preached from the oak,<ref>Weinreb, Ben & [[Hibbert, Christopher]] (1983), ''[[The London Encyclopaedia]]'', Macmillan, {{ISBN|0-333-57688-8}}</ref> with the 18th century farming population meeting there regularly.

When the now-lost great oak tree of Gospel Oak became famous as a preaching spot in the 1700s, the area was referred to as Gospel Oak, and the name continues today.\n\nThe neighbourhood began serious development in the mid-1800s when [[William Murray, 4th Earl of Mansfield and Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], [[Lord Southampton]] and [[Lord Lisburne]] were the local landowners. Plans were drawn up for elegant streets radiating from Lismore Circus but after two railway lines were extended across the area in the 1860s the first buildings were two- and three-story cottages, based around present-day Oak Village. The area was for many years rather remote from the rest of the wider Kentish Town development and streets were not fully completed and the housing stock was regarded as relatively sub-standard.<ref>Richardson, John (1997), ''Kentish Town Past'', Historical Publications, {{ISBN|0-948667-42-7}}</ref>\n\nDuring this early building period, there was a risk that [[Parliament Hill Fields]] (the southernmost part of Hampstead Heath, entered from the \u2018Gospel Oak Entrance\u2019 near [[Gospel Oak station]]) would be built over. In the 1840s, Lord Southampton\u2019s estate initially proposed building on the fields, but a campaign led to the fields being bought in 1889 by the Metropolitan Board of Works as an extension to the already protected Hampstead Heath.<ref>Richardson, John (1999), A History of Camden, Hampstead, Holborn & St Pancras, Historical Publications, {{ISBN|0-948667-58-3}}</ref> The fields now host [[Parliament Hill, London|Parliament Hill]] itself, the [[Parliament Hill Lido]], an athletics running track, a bandstand, caf\u00e9 and various children\u2019s play areas.\n\nOn the evening of 2 September 1861, an excursion train returning from [[Kew Gardens]] hit an empty train on the bridge next to Gospel Oak station. The engine left the line and plunged down the embankment, killing 14 and injuring 300.<ref name=Town>Colloms, Marianne and Weindling, Dick (2009), ''Camden Town and Kentish Town'', [[Tempus Publishing]], {{ISBN|978-0-7524 2922-9}}</ref>\n\nA curious story of Victorian Gospel Oak relates to a story that appeared in the local press of the time, called \"The Elephants of Gospel Oak\". In March 1884, Sangers Circus was booked to perform at Gospel Oak (presumably on Parliament Hill Fields). Four [[elephants]] were transported by train to Kentish Town but on leaving the train, two of the elephants bolted and ran up Fortess Road, knocking over a child, running further beyond [[Tufnell Park]] station and ending up falling into cellars in Pemberton Gardens. The other two elephants were then drafted to pull out the trapped elephants using ropes. All four elephants then paraded down the streets of [[Dartmouth Park]], accompanied by hundreds of onlookers, arriving back at Gospel Oak where the elephants performed to packed audiences.<ref name=Town/>\n\nLater development including the areas of the Mansfield Conservation area to the west of Gospel Oak station led to the neighbourhood becoming more respectable and solidly residential - although in 1909 when [[John Betjeman]]'s family moved to the more affluent [[Highgate]] they obviously felt that they were a cut above Gospel Oak:\n<blockquote>Here from my eyrie, as the sun went down,<br>I heard the old [[North London Railway|North London]] puff and shunt,<br>Glad that I did not live in Gospel Oak.<ref>Betjeman, John (1960). ''[[Summoned by Bells]]'', p 5.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBombing during the 1940s and [[post-war regeneration]] affected Gospel Oak considerably. During [[World War Two]], the area around Gospel Oak station was bombed, and on the night of 16 November 1940, Mansfield Road School ([[Gospel Oak Primary School]] is now on this site) and other parts of Gospel Oak were bombed. The school was acting as a fire station at the time and 4 local residents died and many more injured.<ref>Whitehead, Jack (1999), ''The Growth of Camden Town: AD 1800-2000''.
