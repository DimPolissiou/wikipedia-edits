Individuals or groups strive to improve their well-being through active engagement by using plants and engaging in activities ranging from planting, growing and maintaining plants.\n\nHorticulture has been soothing man's senses as early as 2000 BC in Mesopotamia.

Gardens located within Christian hospices in the Middle Ages emphasized charity and hospitality. Monasteries ministering to the sick and the insane incorporated an arcaded courtyard where they could find the some shelter, sun, or shade in a human-scale, enclosed setting.<ref>Reuben M.

The 20th century ushered in the discovery of germ theory, advances in medical science theories, the biomedical model, and improved technology in the medical sciences.\n\nThe biomedical model, derived from Louis Pasteur's germ theory of disease, became the predominant conceptual model used by physicians in diagnosing disease. According to the biomedical model, health constitutes the freedom from disease, pain, or defect, thus making the normal human condition \"healthy\".<ref>George L.

This narrow focus rationalized and streamlined not only medical diagnosis but also medical processes.

Nature and gardens were relegated to the beautification of entrances; small \"pocket\" areas were used as focal points; sidewalks and even parking areas.\n\nIn response to the reductionistic scope of the biomedical model, several medical researchers and scientists such as George Engel strongly believed that \"\u2026a medical model must also take into account the patient, the social context in which he lives, and the complementary system devised by society to deal with the disruptive effects of illness, that is, the physical role and the health care system. This requires a biopsychosocial model.\"<ref>George L.

In 1984, Roger Ulrich conducted a ground-breaking study comparing the positive effect of views of natural scenery, i.e., trees, on the recovery of patients from surgery to patients in similar conditions who were exposed to a view of a brick wall. He was the first to use the standards of modern medical research\u2014strict experimental controls and quantified health outcomes\u2014to demonstrate that gazing at a garden can sometimes speed healing from surgery, infections and other ailments.  Ulrich showed that in comparison with the wall-view group, the patients with the tree-view had the following results: shorter post-operative hospital stays; fewer negative evaluative comments from nurses; took less medication, and slightly lower scores for minor post-surgical complications.<ref>Roger S.

This garden is unique because it is on a fifth floor balcony and has an elongated shape that is uncommon for a therapeutic dementia garden. Typically therapeutic dementia gardens are square or round and create easy walking paths that follow these shapes. This elongated garden is split up into three distinct areas with two entrances, one from the dining room / kitchen and the other from the activity room.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.healinglandscapes.org/pdf-library/Zeisel%20Treatment%20Effects.pdf|title=Treatment Effects of Healing Gardens for Alzheimer's: A Difficult Thing to Prove|last=Zeisel|first=John|date=2014}}</ref> Entrances are a very important part of dementia gardens. Because way finding abilities can be damaged by the disease clear way finding strategies must be put into place. Entrances have to be thoroughly considered when designing a therapeutic dementia garden. Having the entrances be extremely obvious is one of the ways this is executed. Entrances should be visible from all places in the garden and should be very obvious that they are an entrance or exit. Another strategy that this particular garden uses is the use of colour, with a path painted onto the ground. Each distinct area of the garden is a different colour and is connected with a very obvious walking path for the patients to follow. The three areas of the garden include: \u201ca covered front porch outside the kitchen; a park with circular benches between the two other areas and with no direct doorway inside; and a back yard with seating and a barbecue outside the second doorway.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />Therapeutic dementia gardens are used to reduce the symptoms of the disorder without the use of drugs.\n\n==In literature==\n* Design for Aging: Post-Occupancy Evaluations, American Institute of Architects\n* Healing Gardens: Therapeutic Benefits and Design Recommendations, [[Clare Cooper Marcus]] and Marni Barnes, Eds.\n* Healing Landscapes: Therapeutic Outdoor Environments, Martha Tyson\n* The Healing Landscape: Gardening for the Mind, Body, and Soul, Gay Search\n* Interaction by Design: Bringing People and Plants Together for Health and Well-Being, Candice Shoemaker, Ed.\n* Restorative Gardens: The Healing Landscape, Nancy Gerlach-Spriggs, Richard Enoch Kaufman, Sam Bass Warner Jr.\n* Therapeutic Landscapes: An Evidence-Based Approach to Designing Healing Gardens and Restorative Outdoor Spaces, Clare Cooper Marcus and Naomi Sachs\n* Therapeutic Gardens: Design for Healing Spaces, by Daniel Winterbottom and Amy Wagenfeld\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of garden types]]\n* [[Horticultural therapy]]\n* [[Alzheimer's disease]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=nature-that-nurtures ''How Hospital Gardens Help Patients Heal''] March 19, 2012\n* Therapeutic Landscapes Network, http://www.healinglandscapes.org\n* American Society of Landscape Architects, https://www.asla.org \n* American Horticultural Therapy Association, http://ahta.org\n\n{{Horticulture and gardening}}\n\n[[Category:Types of garden]]\n[[Category:Natural environment based therapies]]\n[[Category:Garden features]]\n[[Category:Types of health care facilities]]\n[[Category:Biophilia hypothesis]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Gardening.jpg|thumb|Gardening as therapy]]\nA '''therapeutic garden''' is an outdoor [[garden]] space that has been specifically designed to meet the physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs of the people using the garden as well as their caregivers, family members and friends.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Horowitz|first1=Sala|title=Therapeutic Gardens and Horticultural Therapy: Growing Roles in Health Care|journal=Alternative and Complementary Therapies|date=20 April 2012|volume=18|issue=2|pages=78\u201383|doi=10.1089/act.2012.18205}}</ref>\n\nTherapeutic gardens can be found in a variety of settings, including hospitals, skilled [[nursing homes]], [[assisted living residences]], [[continuing care retirement communities]], out-patient cancer centers, [[hospice]] residences, and other related healthcare and residential environments.

A balance is effectively struck between the public botanical garden where all visitors are welcome to stroll and the privacy and security that some visitors to the therapeutic garden would want and need. The garden is composed of three unique settings, each with a distinct character and level of activity: one for quiet contemplation; one for both individual exploration and teaching large groups; and one for horticultural therapy. The desire to create a sense of welcome and accommodation for all, regardless of ability, was a significant consideration in details and the selection of materials. The Elizabeth & Nona Evans Restorative Garden is designed by Dirtworks Landscape Architecture, PC, New York, NY.\n\nWarrior and Family Center Support Center Healing Garden: A Garden for Soldiers \u2013 Recipient of the 2015 Therapeutic Garden Design Award by the AHTA.<ref>American Horticultural Therapy Association, http://ahta.org/about/grants-and-awards</ref> The garden, located in San Antonio, Texas, at the Brooke Army Medical Center, is dedicated to soldiers and their families to assist and comfort them through their physical and emotional recovery.<ref>Clare Cooper Marcus, Naomi Sachs.

This garden is unique because it is on a fifth floor balcony and has an elongated shape that is uncommon for a therapeutic dementia garden. Typically therapeutic dementia gardens are square or round and create easy walking paths that follow these shapes. This elongated garden is split up into three distinct areas with two entrances, one from the dining room / kitchen and the other from the activity room<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.healinglandscapes.org/pdf-library/Zeisel%20Treatment%20Effects.pdf|title=Treatment Effects of Healing Gardens for Alzheimer's: A Difficult Thing to Prove|last=Zeisel|first=John|date=2014}}</ref>. Entrances are a very important part of dementia gardens. Because way finding abilities can be damaged by the disease clear way finding strategies must be put into place. Entrances have to be thoroughly considered when designing a therapeutic dementia garden. Having the entrances be extremely obvious is one of the ways this is executed. Entrances should be visible from all places in the garden and should be very obvious that they are an entrance or exit. Another strategy that this particular garden uses is the use of colour, with a path painted onto the ground. Each distinct area of the garden is a different colour and is connected with a very obvious walking path for the patients to follow. The three areas of the garden include: \u201ca covered front porch outside the kitchen; a park with circular benches between the two other areas and with no direct doorway inside; and a back yard with seating and a barbecue outside the second doorway.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />Therapeutic dementia gardens are used to reduce the symptoms of the disorder without the use of drugs.\n\n==In literature==\n* Design for Aging: Post-Occupancy Evaluations, American Institute of Architects\n* Healing Gardens: Therapeutic Benefits and Design Recommendations, [[Clare Cooper Marcus]] and Marni Barnes, Eds.\n* Healing Landscapes: Therapeutic Outdoor Environments, Martha Tyson\n* The Healing Landscape: Gardening for the Mind, Body, and Soul, Gay Search\n* Interaction by Design: Bringing People and Plants Together for Health and Well-Being, Candice Shoemaker, Ed.\n* Restorative Gardens: The Healing Landscape, Nancy Gerlach-Spriggs, Richard Enoch Kaufman, Sam Bass Warner Jr.\n* Therapeutic Landscapes: An Evidence-Based Approach to Designing Healing Gardens and Restorative Outdoor Spaces, Clare Cooper Marcus and Naomi Sachs\n* Therapeutic Gardens: Design for Healing Spaces, by Daniel Winterbottom and Amy Wagenfeld\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of garden types]]\n* [[Horticultural therapy]]\n* [[Alzheimer's disease]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=nature-that-nurtures ''How Hospital Gardens Help Patients Heal''] March 19, 2012\n* Therapeutic Landscapes Network, http://www.healinglandscapes.org\n* American Society of Landscape Architects, https://www.asla.org \n* American Horticultural Therapy Association, http://ahta.org\n\n{{Horticulture and gardening}}\n\n[[Category:Types of garden]]\n[[Category:Natural environment based therapies]]\n[[Category:Garden features]]\n[[Category:Types of health care facilities]]\n[[Category:Biophilia hypothesis]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_garden"}

To challenge the linear model, today's theories of technology point to the historical evidence that technological innovation often gives rise to new scientific fields, and emphasizes the important role that social networks and cultural values play in shaping technological artifacts.

It strives for impartiality in the description of human and nonhuman actors and the reintegration of the natural and social worlds. For example, Latour (1992)<ref>Latour, B. (1992). Where are the missing masses? The sociology of a few mundane artifacts. In Bijker, W., and Law, J., editors, Shaping Technology/Building Society. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA</ref> argues that instead of worrying whether we are anthropomorphizing technology, we should embrace it as inherently anthropomorphic: technology is made by humans, substitutes for the actions of humans, and shapes human action. What is important is the chain and gradients of actors' actions and competencies, and the degree to which we choose to have figurative representations. Key concepts include the '''inscription''' of beliefs, practices, relations into technology, which is then said to '''embody''' them. Key authors include [[Bruno Latour|Latour]] (1997)<ref>Latour, B. (1997). On Actor Network Theory: a few clarifications</ref> and Callon (1999).<ref>Callon, M. (1999). Some Elements of a Sociology of Translation: Domestication of the Scallops and the Fishermen of Saint Brieuc Bay. In Biagioli, M., editor, The Science Studies Reader, pages 67\u201383. Routledge, New York.</ref>\n*[[Structuration theory]] \u2013 defines structures as rules and resources organized as properties of social systems. The theory employs a recursive notion of actions constrained and enabled by structures which are produced and reproduced by that action. Consequently, in this theory technology is not rendered as an artifact, but instead examines how people, as they interact with technology in their ongoing practices, enact structures which shape their emergent and situated use of that technology. Key authors include DeSanctis and Poole (1990)<ref>Desanctis, G. and Poole, M. S. (1994). Capturing the complexity in advanced technology use: adaptive structuration theory.

Organization Science, 3(3):398-427.</ref>\n* [[Systems theory]] \u2013 considers the historical development of technology and media with an emphasis on inertia and heterogeneity, stressing the connections between the artifact being built and the social, economic, political and cultural factors surrounding it. Key concepts include [[reverse salient]]s when elements of a system lag in development with respect to others, differentiation, '''<u>[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11245-016-9365-4 operational closure], and [http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AUJlLegPhil/2010/4.pdf autopoietic autonomy.]</u>''' Key authors include [[Thomas P. Hughes]] (1992) and [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]] (2000).<ref>Luhmann, N. (2000). The reality of the mass media. Stanford, Stanford, CA.</ref>\n* [[Activity theory]] - considers an entire work/activity system (including teams, organizations, etc.) beyond just one actor or user. It accounts for the environment, history of the person, culture, role of the artifact, motivations, and complexity of real-life activity. One of the strengths of AT is that it bridges the gap between the individual subject and the social reality\u2014it studies both through the mediating activity. The unit of analysis in AT is the concept of object-oriented, collective and culturally mediated human activity, or activity system.\n\n=== Critical approaches ===\n\n[[Critical theory]] goes beyond a descriptive account of how things are, to examine why they have come to be that way, and how they might otherwise be. Critical theory asks whose interests are being served by the [[status quo]] and assesses the potential of future alternatives to better serve social justice. According to Geuss's<ref>Geuss, R. (1981) The Idea of a Critical Theory, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press.</ref> definition, \"a critical theory, then, is a reflective theory which gives agents a kind of knowledge inherently productive of enlightenment and emancipation' (1964). Marcuse argued that whilst matters of technology design are often presented as neutral technical choices, in fact, they manifest political or moral values. Critical theory is a form of archaeology that attempt to get beneath common-sense understandings in order to  reveal the power relationships and interests determining particular technological configuration and use. \n \nPerhaps the most developed contemporary critical theory of technology is contained in the works of [[Andrew Feenberg]] including 'Transforming Technology' (2002).\n\n* Values in Design - asks how do we ensure a place for values (alongside technical standards such as speed, efficiency, and reliability) as criteria by which we judge the quality and acceptability of information systems and new media. How do values such as privacy, autonomy, democracy, and social justice become integral to conception, design, and development, not merely retrofitted after completion? Key thinkers include [[Helen Nissenbaum]] (2001).<ref>Nissenbaum, H. (2001). How computer systems embody values. Computer, 34(3):120-118.</ref>\n\n=== Group Theories ===\nThere are also a number of technology related theories that address how (media) technology affects group processes. Broadly, these theories are concerned with the social effects of communication media. Some (e.g., media richness) are concerned with questions of media choice (i.e., when to use what medium effectively). Other theories (social presence, SIDE, media naturalness) are concerned with the consequences of those media choices (i.e., what are the social effects of using particular communication media).\n\n* [[Social presence theory]] (Short, et al., 1976<ref>Short, J. A., Williams, E., and Christie, B. (1976). The social psychology of telecommunications. John Wiley & Sons, New York.</ref>) is a seminal theory of the social effects of communication technology. Its main concern is with telephony and telephone conferencing (the research was sponsored by the British Post Office, now British Telecom). It argues that the social impact of a communication medium depend on the ''social presence'' it allows communicators to have. Social presence is defined as a property of the medium itself: the degree of acoustic, visual, and physical contact that it allows. The theory assumes that more contact will increase the key components of \"presence\": greater intimacy, immediacy, warmth and inter-personal rapport. As a consequence of social presence, social influence is expected to increase. In the case of communication technology, the assumption is that more text-based forms of interaction (e-mail, instant messaging) are less social, and therefore less conducive to social influence.\n* [[Media richness theory]] (Daft & Lengel, 1986)<ref>Daft, R. L. and Lengel, R. H. (1986). Organizational information requirements, media richness and structural design. Management Science, 32(5):554-571</ref> shares some characteristics with social presence theory. It posits that the amount of information communicated differs with respect to a medium's ''richness''. The theory assumes that resolving ambiguity and reducing uncertainty are the main goals of communication. Because communication media differ in the rate of understanding they can achieve in a specific time (with \"rich\" media carrying more information), they are not all capable of resolving uncertainty and ambiguity well. The more restricted the medium's capacity, the less uncertainty and equivocality it is able to manage. It follows that the richness of the media should be matched to the task so as to prevent over simplification or complication.\n* [[Media naturalness theory]] (Kock, 2001; 2004)<ref>Kock, N. (2001). The ape that used email: Understanding e-communication behavior through evolution theory. Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 5(3), 1-29.</ref><ref>Kock, N. (2004). The psychobiological model: Towards a new theory of computer-mediated communication based on Darwinian evolution. Organization Science, 15(3), 327-348.</ref> builds on human evolution ideas and has been proposed as an alternative to media richness theory. Media naturalness theory argues that since our Stone Age hominid ancestors have communicated primarily face-to-face, evolutionary pressures have led to the development of a brain that is consequently designed for that form of communication. Other forms of communication are too recent and unlikely to have posed evolutionary pressures that could have shaped our brain in their direction. Using communication media that suppress key elements found in face-to-face communication, as many electronic communication media do, thus ends up posing cognitive obstacles to communication. This is particularly the case in the context of complex tasks (e.g., business process redesign, new product development, online learning), because such tasks seem to require more intense communication over extended periods of time than simple tasks.\n* Media synchronicity theory (MST, Dennis & Valacich, 1999) redirects richness theory towards the ''synchronicity'' of the communication.\n* The [[social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE)]] (Postmes, Spears and Lea 1999<ref>Postmes, T., Spears, R., and Lea, M. (1999). Social identity, group norms, and deindividuation: Lessons from computer-mediated communication for social influence in the group. In N. Ellemers, R. Spears, B. D., editor, Social Identity: Context, Commitment, Content. Blackwell., Oxford.</ref>; Reicher, Spears and Postmes, 1995<ref>Reicher, S., Spears, R., & Postmes, T. (1995). A social identity model of deindividuation phenomena. In W. Stroebe & M. Hewstone (Eds.), European Review of Social Psychology (Vol. 6, pp. 161\u2013198). Chichester: Wiley.</ref>;Spears & Lea, 1994 <ref>Spears, R., & Lea, M. (1994). Panacea or panopticon? The hidden power in computer-mediated communication. Communication Research, 21, 427-459.</ref>) was developed as a response to the idea that anonymity and reduced presence made communication technology socially impoverished (or \"deindividuated\"). It provided an alternative explanation for these \"[[deindividuation]] effects\" based on theories of social identity (e.g., Turner et al., 1987<ref>Turner, J. C., Hogg, M. A., Oakes, P. J., Reicher, S., & Wetherell, M. S. (1987). Rediscovering the social group: A self-categorization theory. Oxford, England: Basil Blackwell.</ref>). The SIDE model distinguishes cognitive and strategic effects of a communication technology. Cognitive effects occur when communication technologies make \"salient\" particular aspects of personal or social identity. For example, certain technologies such as email may disguise characteristics of the sender that individually differentiate them (i.e., that convey aspects of their personal identity) and as a result more attention may be given to their social identity. The strategic effects are due to the possibilities, afforded by communication technology, to selectively communicate or enact particular aspects of identity, and disguise others. SIDE therefore sees the social and the technological as mutually determining, and the behavior associated with particular communication forms as the product or interaction of the two.\n* Time, interaction, and performance (TIP; McGrath, 1991)<ref>McGrath, J.E. (1991). Time, interaction, and performance (tip): A theory of groups. small group research. 22(2):147-174.</ref> theory describes work groups as time-based, multi-modal, and multi-functional social systems. Groups interact in one of the modes of inception, problem solving, conflict resolution, and execution. The three functions of a group are production (towards a goal), support (affective) and well-being (norms and roles).\n\n=== Other Stances ===\nAdditionally, many authors have posed technology so as to critique and or emphasize aspects of technology as addressed by the mainline theories. For example, [[Steve Woolgar]] (1991)<ref>Woolgar, S. (1991). The turn to technology in social studies of science. Science, Technology, & Human Values, 16(1):20-50.</ref> considers ''technology as text'' in order to critique the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]] as applied to technology and to distinguish between three responses to that notion: the instrumental response (interpretive flexibility), the interpretivist response (environmental/organizational influences), the reflexive response (a double hermeneutic). Pfaffenberger (1992)<ref>Pfaffenberger, B. (1992). Technological dramas. Science, Technology, & Human Values, 17(3):282-312.</ref> treats ''technology as drama'' to argue that a recursive structuring of technological artifacts and their social structure discursively regulate the technological construction of political power. A technological drama is a discourse of technological \"statements\" and \"counterstatements\" within the processes of technological regularization, adjustment, and reconstitution.\n\nAn important philosophical approach to technology has been taken by [[Bernard Stiegler]]<ref>Stiegler, B. (1998). Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus. Stanford: Stanford University Press.</ref>, whose work has been influenced by other philosophers and historians of technology including [[Gilbert Simondon]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Leroi-Gourhan]].\nIn the Schumpeterian and Neo-Schumpeterian theories technologies are critical factors of [[economic growth]] ([[Carlota Perez]]).<ref>Perez, Carlota (2009).Technological revolutions and techno-economic paradigms. Working Papers in Technology Governance and Economic Dynamics, Working Paper No. 20. (Norway and Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn)</ref>\n\n== Analytic theories ==\n\nFinally, there are theories of technology which are not defined or claimed by a proponent, but are used by authors in describing existing literature, in contrast to their own or as a review of the field.\n\nFor example, Markus and Robey (1988)<ref>Markus, M. and Robey, D. (1988). Information technology and organizational change: causal structure in theory and research. Management Science, 34:583-598.</ref> propose a general technology theory consisting of the causal structures of agency (technological, organizational, imperative, emergent), its structure (variance, process), and the level (micro, macro) of analysis.\n\nOrlikowski (1992)<ref>Orlikowski, W.J. (1992). The duality of technology: rethinking the concept of technology in organizations. Organization Science, 3(3):398-427.</ref> notes that previous conceptualizations of technology typically differ over scope (is technology more than hardware?) and role (is it an external objective force, the interpreted human action, or an impact moderated by humans?) and identifies three models:\n# '''Technological imperative:''' focuses on organizational characteristics which can be measured and permits some level of contingency\n# '''Strategic choice:''' focuses on how technology is influenced by the context and strategies of decision-makers and users\n# '''Technology as a trigger of structural change:''' views technology as a social object\n\n[[Gerardine DeSanctis|DeSanctis]] and Poole (1994) similarly write of three views of technology's effects: \n# '''Decision-making:''' the view of engineers associated with positivist, rational, systems rationalization, and deterministic approaches\n# '''Institutional school:''' technology is an opportunity for change, focuses on social evolution, social construction of meaning, interaction and historical processes, interpretive flexibility, and an interplay between technology and power\n# '''An integrated perspective (social technology):''' soft-line determinism, with joint social and technological optimization, structural symbolic interaction theory\n\nBimber (1998)<ref>Bimber, B. (1998). Three faces of technological determinism. In Smith, M. and Marx, L., editors, Does Technology Drive History? The Dilemma of Technological Determinism, pages 79\u2013100. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA.</ref> addresses the determinacy of technology effects by distinguishing between the:\n# '''Normative:''' an autonomous approach where technology is an important influence on history only where societies attached cultural and political meaning to it (e.g., the industrialization of society)\n# '''Nomological:''' a naturalistic approach wherein an inevitable technological order arises based on laws of nature (e.g., steam mill had to follow the hand mill). \n# '''''[[Unintended consequence]]s:''''' a fuzzy approach that is demonstrative that technology is contingent (e.g., a car is faster than a horse, but unbeknownst to its original creators become a significant source of pollution)\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Denis, A. and Valacich, J.

Routledge, New York.</ref>.\n*[[Structuration theory]] \u2013 defines structures as rules and resources organized as properties of social systems. The theory employs a recursive notion of actions constrained and enabled by structures which are produced and reproduced by that action. Consequently, in this theory technology is not rendered as an artifact, but instead examines how people, as they interact with technology in their ongoing practices, enact structures which shape their emergent and situated use of that technology.

Organization Science, 3(3):398-427.</ref>.\n* [[Systems theory]] \u2013 considers the historical development of technology and media with an emphasis on inertia and heterogeneity, stressing the connections between the artifact being built and the social, economic, political and cultural factors surrounding it. Key concepts include [[reverse salient]]s when elements of a system lag in development with respect to others, differentiation, '''<u>[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11245-016-9365-4 operational closure], and [http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/AUJlLegPhil/2010/4.pdf autopoietic autonomy.]</u>''' Key authors include [[Thomas P. Hughes]] (1992) and [[Niklas Luhmann|Luhmann]] (2000)<ref>Luhmann, N. (2000). The reality of the mass media. Stanford, Stanford, CA.</ref>.\n* [[Activity theory]] - considers an entire work/activity system (including teams, organizations, etc.) beyond just one actor or user. It accounts for the environment, history of the person, culture, role of the artifact, motivations, and complexity of real-life activity. One of the strengths of AT is that it bridges the gap between the individual subject and the social reality\u2014it studies both through the mediating activity. The unit of analysis in AT is the concept of object-oriented, collective and culturally mediated human activity, or activity system.\n\n=== Critical approaches ===\n\n[[Critical theory]] goes beyond a descriptive account of how things are, to examine why they have come to be that way, and how they might otherwise be. Critical theory asks whose interests are being served by the [[status quo]] and assesses the potential of future alternatives to better serve social justice. According to Geuss's<ref>Geuss, R. (1981) The Idea of a Critical Theory, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press.</ref> definition, \"a critical theory, then, is a reflective theory which gives agents a kind of knowledge inherently productive of enlightenment and emancipation' (1964). Marcuse argued that whilst matters of technology design are often presented as neutral technical choices, in fact, they manifest political or moral values. Critical theory is a form of archaeology that attempt to get beneath common-sense understandings in order to  reveal the power relationships and interests determining particular technological configuration and use. \n \nPerhaps the most developed contemporary critical theory of technology is contained in the works of [[Andrew Feenberg]] including 'Transforming Technology' (2002).\n\n* Values in Design - asks how do we ensure a place for values (alongside technical standards such as speed, efficiency, and reliability) as criteria by which we judge the quality and acceptability of information systems and new media. How do values such as privacy, autonomy, democracy, and social justice become integral to conception, design, and development, not merely retrofitted after completion? Key thinkers include [[Helen Nissenbaum]] (2001)<ref>Nissenbaum, H. (2001). How computer systems embody values. Computer, 34(3):120-118.</ref>.\n\n=== Group Theories ===\nThere are also a number of technology related theories that address how (media) technology affects group processes. Broadly, these theories are concerned with the social effects of communication media. Some (e.g., media richness) are concerned with questions of media choice (i.e., when to use what medium effectively). Other theories (social presence, SIDE, media naturalness) are concerned with the consequences of those media choices (i.e., what are the social effects of using particular communication media).\n\n* [[Social presence theory]] (Short, et al., 1976<ref>Short, J. A., Williams, E., and Christie, B. (1976). The social psychology of telecommunications. John Wiley & Sons, New York.</ref>) is a seminal theory of the social effects of communication technology. Its main concern is with telephony and telephone conferencing (the research was sponsored by the British Post Office, now British Telecom). It argues that the social impact of a communication medium depend on the ''social presence'' it allows communicators to have. Social presence is defined as a property of the medium itself: the degree of acoustic, visual, and physical contact that it allows. The theory assumes that more contact will increase the key components of \"presence\": greater intimacy, immediacy, warmth and inter-personal rapport. As a consequence of social presence, social influence is expected to increase. In the case of communication technology, the assumption is that more text-based forms of interaction (e-mail, instant messaging) are less social, and therefore less conducive to social influence.\n* [[Media richness theory]] (Daft & Lengel, 1986)<ref>Daft, R. L. and Lengel, R. H. (1986). Organizational information requirements, media richness and structural design. Management Science, 32(5):554-571</ref> shares some characteristics with social presence theory. It posits that the amount of information communicated differs with respect to a medium's ''richness''. The theory assumes that resolving ambiguity and reducing uncertainty are the main goals of communication. Because communication media differ in the rate of understanding they can achieve in a specific time (with \"rich\" media carrying more information), they are not all capable of resolving uncertainty and ambiguity well. The more restricted the medium's capacity, the less uncertainty and equivocality it is able to manage. It follows that the richness of the media should be matched to the task so as to prevent over simplification or complication.\n* [[Media naturalness theory]] (Kock, 2001; 2004)<ref>Kock, N. (2001). The ape that used email: Understanding e-communication behavior through evolution theory. Communications of the Association for Information Systems, 5(3), 1-29.</ref><ref>Kock, N. (2004). The psychobiological model: Towards a new theory of computer-mediated communication based on Darwinian evolution. Organization Science, 15(3), 327-348.</ref> builds on human evolution ideas and has been proposed as an alternative to media richness theory. Media naturalness theory argues that since our Stone Age hominid ancestors have communicated primarily face-to-face, evolutionary pressures have led to the development of a brain that is consequently designed for that form of communication. Other forms of communication are too recent and unlikely to have posed evolutionary pressures that could have shaped our brain in their direction. Using communication media that suppress key elements found in face-to-face communication, as many electronic communication media do, thus ends up posing cognitive obstacles to communication. This is particularly the case in the context of complex tasks (e.g., business process redesign, new product development, online learning), because such tasks seem to require more intense communication over extended periods of time than simple tasks.\n* Media synchronicity theory (MST, Dennis & Valacich, 1999) redirects richness theory towards the ''synchronicity'' of the communication.\n* The [[social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE)]] (Postmes, Spears and Lea 1999<ref>Postmes, T., Spears, R., and Lea, M. (1999). Social identity, group norms, and deindividuation: Lessons from computer-mediated communication for social influence in the group. In N. Ellemers, R. Spears, B. D., editor, Social Identity: Context, Commitment, Content. Blackwell., Oxford.</ref>; Reicher, Spears and Postmes, 1995<ref>Reicher, S., Spears, R., & Postmes, T. (1995). A social identity model of deindividuation phenomena. In W. Stroebe & M. Hewstone (Eds.), European Review of Social Psychology (Vol. 6, pp. 161\u2013198). Chichester: Wiley.</ref>;Spears & Lea, 1994 <ref>Spears, R., & Lea, M. (1994). Panacea or panopticon? The hidden power in computer-mediated communication. Communication Research, 21, 427-459.</ref>) was developed as a response to the idea that anonymity and reduced presence made communication technology socially impoverished (or \"deindividuated\"). It provided an alternative explanation for these \"[[deindividuation]] effects\" based on theories of social identity (e.g., Turner et al., 1987<ref>Turner, J. C., Hogg, M. A., Oakes, P. J., Reicher, S., & Wetherell, M. S. (1987). Rediscovering the social group: A self-categorization theory. Oxford, England: Basil Blackwell.</ref>). The SIDE model distinguishes cognitive and strategic effects of a communication technology. Cognitive effects occur when communication technologies make \"salient\" particular aspects of personal or social identity. For example, certain technologies such as email may disguise characteristics of the sender that individually differentiate them (i.e., that convey aspects of their personal identity) and as a result more attention may be given to their social identity. The strategic effects are due to the possibilities, afforded by communication technology, to selectively communicate or enact particular aspects of identity, and disguise others. SIDE therefore sees the social and the technological as mutually determining, and the behavior associated with particular communication forms as the product or interaction of the two.\n* Time, interaction, and performance (TIP; McGrath, 1991)<ref>McGrath, J.E. (1991). Time, interaction, and performance (tip): A theory of groups. small group research. 22(2):147-174.</ref> theory describes work groups as time-based, multi-modal, and multi-functional social systems. Groups interact in one of the modes of inception, problem solving, conflict resolution, and execution. The three functions of a group are production (towards a goal), support (affective) and well-being (norms and roles).\n\n=== Other Stances ===\nAdditionally, many authors have posed technology so as to critique and or emphasize aspects of technology as addressed by the mainline theories. For example, [[Steve Woolgar]] (1991)<ref>Woolgar, S. (1991). The turn to technology in social studies of science. Science, Technology, & Human Values, 16(1):20-50.</ref> considers ''technology as text'' in order to critique the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]] as applied to technology and to distinguish between three responses to that notion: the instrumental response (interpretive flexibility), the interpretivist response (environmental/organizational influences), the reflexive response (a double hermeneutic). Pfaffenberger (1992)<ref>Pfaffenberger, B. (1992). Technological dramas. Science, Technology, & Human Values, 17(3):282-312.</ref> treats ''technology as drama'' to argue that a recursive structuring of technological artifacts and their social structure discursively regulate the technological construction of political power. A technological drama is a discourse of technological \"statements\" and \"counterstatements\" within the processes of technological regularization, adjustment, and reconstitution.\n\nAn important philosophical approach to technology has been taken by [[Bernard Stiegler]]<ref>Stiegler, B. (1998). Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus. Stanford: Stanford University Press.</ref>, whose work has been influenced by other philosophers and historians of technology including [[Gilbert Simondon]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Leroi-Gourhan]].\nIn the Schumpeterian and Neo-Schumpeterian theories technologies are critical factors of [[economic growth]] ([[Carlota Perez]])<ref>Perez, Carlota (2009).Technological revolutions and techno-economic paradigms. Working Papers in Technology Governance and Economic Dynamics, Working Paper No. 20. (Norway and Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn)</ref>.\n\n== Analytic theories ==\n\nFinally, there are theories of technology which are not defined or claimed by a proponent, but are used by authors in describing existing literature, in contrast to their own or as a review of the field.\n\nFor example, Markus and Robey (1988)<ref>Markus, M. and Robey, D. (1988). Information technology and organizational change: causal structure in theory and research. Management Science, 34:583-598.</ref> propose a general technology theory consisting of the causal structures of agency (technological, organizational, imperative, emergent), its structure (variance, process), and the level (micro, macro) of analysis.\n\nOrlikowski (1992)<ref>Orlikowski, W.J. (1992). The duality of technology: rethinking the concept of technology in organizations. Organization Science, 3(3):398-427.</ref> notes that previous conceptualizations of technology typically differ over scope (is technology more than hardware?) and role (is it an external objective force, the interpreted human action, or an impact moderated by humans?) and identifies three models:\n# '''Technological imperative:''' focuses on organizational characteristics which can be measured and permits some level of contingency\n# '''Strategic choice:''' focuses on how technology is influenced by the context and strategies of decision-makers and users\n# '''Technology as a trigger of structural change:''' views technology as a social object\n\n[[Gerardine DeSanctis|DeSanctis]] and Poole (1994) similarly write of three views of technology's effects: \n# '''Decision-making:''' the view of engineers associated with positivist, rational, systems rationalization, and deterministic approaches\n# '''Institutional school:''' technology is an opportunity for change, focuses on social evolution, social construction of meaning, interaction and historical processes, interpretive flexibility, and an interplay between technology and power\n# '''An integrated perspective (social technology):''' soft-line determinism, with joint social and technological optimization, structural symbolic interaction theory\n\nBimber (1998)<ref>Bimber, B. (1998). Three faces of technological determinism. In Smith, M. and Marx, L., editors, Does Technology Drive History? The Dilemma of Technological Determinism, pages 79\u2013100. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA.</ref> addresses the determinacy of technology effects by distinguishing between the:\n# '''Normative:''' an autonomous approach where technology is an important influence on history only where societies attached cultural and political meaning to it (e.g., the industrialization of society)\n# '''Nomological:''' a naturalistic approach wherein an inevitable technological order arises based on laws of nature (e.g., steam mill had to follow the hand mill). \n# '''''[[Unintended consequence]]s:''''' a fuzzy approach that is demonstrative that technology is contingent (e.g., a car is faster than a horse, but unbeknownst to its original creators become a significant source of pollution)\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Denis, A. and Valacich, J.

He was a professional singer in his youth, and was introduced to [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]], in 1873. He took part in the first performance of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Parsifal]]'' at [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth]] in 1882. Reuss later became a newspaper correspondent, and travelled frequently as such to England, where he became a [[freemasonry|Mason]] at the Pilger Loge No. 238 of the [[United Grand Lodge of England]] in 1876.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/esoterica/reuss_t/reuss_t.html|title=Albert Karl Theodore Reuss|work=Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon |date=2 July 2014}}</ref> He also spent some time there as a journalist and as a [[music-hall]] singer under the stage name \"Charles Theodore.\"\n\nIn 1876, Reuss married a woman ten years his senior, Delphina Garbois from [[Dublin]], and moved to [[Munich]] in 1878. Their marriage was annulled, due to bigamy (Hergem\u00f6ller, 1998). They had a son, Albert Franz Theodor Reuss (1879\u20131958), a self-educated [[zoologist]] who lived in [[Berlin]] (Krecs\u00e1k and Bohle 2008).\n\n==Police spy==\nIn 1885, in England, Reuss joined the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]]. He had been quite involved as a [[librarian]] and labour secretary. On May 7, 1886 he was expelled as a police spy in the pay of the [[Prussian Secret Police]]. This took place in a sectarian atmosphere, with tensions between [[anarcho-communism|anarcho-communist]] [[Josef Peukert]] and the [[Bakunin]]ist [[Victor Dave]] where such accusations were often made without substance. However, this accusation came from the [[Belgian Labour Party|Belgian Social Democrats]], and was raised here by [[Henry Charles]]. Peukert and the [[Gruppe Autonomie]] published a rebuttal of these allegations which appeared in the ''Anarchist'', which also accused Dave of being a spy. However, in February 1887 Reuss used the unwitting Peukert to track down [[Johann Neve]], an arms smuggler, in Belgium, who was then arrested by the German police. .\n\n==Founds Ordo Templi Orientis==\nIn 1880, in [[Munich]], he participated in an attempt to revive [[Adam Weishaupt]]'s [[Illuminati|Bavarian Order of Illuminati]]. While in England, he became friends with [[William Wynn Westcott]], the Supreme Magus of the [[Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia]] and one of the founders of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]. Westcott provided Reuss with a charter dated July 26, 1901 for the [[Swedenborg Rite|Swedenborgian Rite]] of Masonry and a letter of authorization dated February 24, 1902 to found a High Council in Germania of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia. [[Papus|G\u00e9rard Encausse]] provided him with a charter dated June 24, 1901 designating him Special Inspector for the [[Martinist]] Order in Germany. In 1888, in Berlin, he joined with [[Leopold Engel]] of [[Dresden]], Max Rahn and August Weinholz in another effort to revive the Illuminati Order. In 1895, he began to discuss the formation of [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] with [[Carl Kellner (Ordo Templi Orientis)|Carl Kellner]].\n\nThe discussions between Reuss and Kellner did not lead to any positive results at the time, allegedly because Kellner disapproved of Reuss's connections with Engel. According to Reuss, upon his final separation with Engel in June 1902, Kellner contacted him and the two agreed to proceed with the establishment of the Oriental Templar Order by seeking authorizations to work the various rites of high-grade Masonry.\n\nThe French [[occultist]] and physician [[Papus|G\u00e9rard Encausse]] (perhaps better known by his pen-name Papus) was one such contact. Although not a member of a regular Masonic order, he had founded two occult fraternities: the [[Martinist]] group, l'Ordre des Sup\u00e9rieurs Inconnus and the [[Rosicrucian]] [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] Order of the Rose-Croix. In addition, he was a member of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], and a Bishop in a neo-Gnostic church, l'\u00c9glise Gnostique de France. Encausse provided Reuss with a charter dated June 24, 1901 designating him Special Inspector for the Martinist order in Germany. He also assisted Reuss in the formation of the O.T.O. Gnostic Catholic Church by proclaiming the E.G.C. a \"child\" of l'\u00c9glise Gnostique de France, which linked the E.G.C. to French neo-gnosticism.\n\nMeanwhile, Westcott assisted Reuss in contacting the English Masonic scholar, [[John Yarker]] (1833\u20131913). Along with his associates [[Franz Hartmann]] and Henry Klein, he activated the Masonic Rites of Memphis and Mizraim and a branch of the [[Scottish Rite]] in Germany with charters from Yarker. Reuss received letters-patent as a Sovereign Grand Inspector General 33\u00b0 of the Cernau Scottish Rite from Yarker dated September 24, 1902. On the same date, Yarker appears to have issued a warrant to Reuss, Franz Hartmann and Henry Klein to operate a Sovereign Sanctuary 33\u00b0-95\u00b0 of the Scottish, Memphis and Mizraim rites. The original document is not extant, but a transcript of this warrant was published in 1911 in Reuss's newsletter, [[The Oriflamme]], which commenced publication in 1902. Yarker issued a charter confirming Reuss's authority to operate said rites on July 1, 1904; and Reuss published a transcript of an additional confirming charter dated June 24, 1905. Reuss and Kellner together prepared a brief manifesto for their Order in 1903, which was published the next year in ''The Oriflamme''.\n\nWhen Carl Kellner died in 1905, the leadership of the Academia Masonica of O.T.O. fell upon Reuss's shoulders, and he incorporated all his other organizations under its banner, developing the three degrees of the Academia Masonica, available to Masons only, into a coherent, self-contained initiatory system, open to both men and women. He promulgated a constitution for this new, enlarged O.T.O. on June 21, 1906 in London (his place of residence since January 1906) and the next month proclaimed himself Outer Head of the Order (O.H.O.). That same year he published ''Lingham-Yoni'', which was a German translation of [[Hargrave Jennings]]'s work ''Phallism'', and issued a warrant to [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1861\u20131925, who was at the time the Secretary General of the German branch of the [[Theosophical Society]]), making him Deputy Grand Master of a subordinate O.T.O./Memphis/Mizraim Chapter and Grand Council called \"Mystica Aeterna\" in Berlin. Steiner went on to found the Anthroposophical Society in 1912, and ended his association with Reuss in 1914.\n\nOn June 24, 1908, Reuss attended Encausse's \"International Masonic and Spiritualist Conference\" in Paris. At this conference, Reuss raised Encausse to the X\u00b0 of the O.T.O.'s Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica and gave him a patent to establish a \"Supreme Grand Council General of the Unified Rites of Antient and Primitive Masonry for the Grand Orient of France and its Dependencies at Paris. \" He possibly received in return some position of authority in the \u00c9glise Catholique Gnostique. Reuss also appointed Dr. [[Arnold Krumm-Heller]] (Huiracocha, 1879\u20131949) as his official representative for Latin America.\n\n==Meets Aleister Crowley==\nWhile living in London, Reuss became acquainted with [[Aleister Crowley]]. In 1910, he made Crowley a VII\u00b0 of O.T.O. (because of Crowley's having been given the 33\u00b0 by Don Jesus Medina in an irregular Scottish Rite lodge in Mexico City), and in 1912, he conferred upon him the IX\u00b0 and appointed him National Grand Master General X\u00b0 for the O.T.O. in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland by charter dated June 1, 1912. Crowley's appointment included authority over an English language rite of the lower (Masonic) degrees of O.T.O. which was given the name [[Mysteria Mystica Maxima]], or M\u2234M\u2234M\u2234. In 1913, Crowley issued a Constitution for the M\u2234M\u2234M\u2234 and the Manifesto of the M\u2234M\u2234M\u2234, which he subsequently redrafted and issued as Liber LII (52), the ''Manifesto of the O.T.O.'' In 1913, Crowley wrote [[The Gnostic Mass|Liber XV]], the Gnostic Mass for Reuss's [[Gnostic Catholic Church]]. Crowley also dedicated his Mystery Play ''The Ship'' (1913) and a collection of poetry, ''The Giant's Thumb'' (1915) to Reuss. In 1913 he became Grand Master of the [[Rite of Memphis-Misra\u00efm]], a masonic group which previously included the revolutionaries [[Louis Blanc]] and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] amongst its ranks.\n\nIn 1914, at the outset of [[World War I]], Reuss left England and returned to Germany. He worked briefly for the [[Red Cross]] in Berlin, then, in 1916, moved to [[Basle, Switzerland]]. While there, he established an \"Anational Grand Lodge and Mystic Temple\" of O.T.O. and the [[Hermetic Brotherhood of Light]] at [[Monte Verit\u00e0]], a utopian commune near Ascona founded in 1900 by [[Henri Oedenkoven]] and [[Ida Hofmann]], which functioned as a center for the Progressive Underground. On January 22, 1917, Reuss published a manifesto for this Anational Grand Lodge, which was called \"Verit\u00e0 Mystica.\" On the same date, he published a ''Revised O.T.O. Constitution of 1917'' (based in a large part on Crowley's 1913 Constitution of the M.M.M.), with a \"Synopsis of Degrees\" and an abridgment of \"The Message of the Master Therion\" appended. Reuss held an \"Anational Congress for Organising the Reconstruction of Society on Practical Cooperative Lines\" at Monte Verit\u00e0 August 15\u201325, 1917. This Congress included readings of Crowley's poetry (on August 22) and a recitation of Crowley's Gnostic Mass (on August 24). On October 24, 1917, Reuss Chartered an O.T.O. Lodge, \"Libertas et Fraternitas\" in Z\u00fcrich. This Lodge later placed itself under the Masonic jurisdiction of the [[Grand Lodge Alpina of Switzerland]].\n\nIn 1918, Reuss published his German translation of Crowley's Gnostic Mass. In a note at the end of his translation of Liber XV, he referred to himself as, simultaneously, the Sovereign Patriarch and Primate of the Gnostic Catholic Church, and Gnostic Legate to Switzerland of the \u00c9glise Gnostique Universelle, acknowledging [[Jean Bricaud]] (1881\u20131934) as Sovereign Patriarch of that church. The issuance of this document can be viewed as the birth of the Thelemic E.G.C. as an independent organization under the umbrella of O.T.O., with Reuss as its first Patriarch.\n\nReuss was clearly impressed with [[Thelema]]. Crowley's Gnostic Mass, which Reuss translated into German and had recited at his Anational Congress at Monte Verit\u00e0, is an explicitly Thelemic ritual. In an undated letter to Crowley (received in 1917), Reuss reported excitedly that he had read ''The Message of the Master Therion'' to a gathering at Monte Verit\u00e0, and that he was translating [[The Book of the Law]] into German. He added, \"Let this news encourage you! We live in your Work!!!\"\n\n==After the First World War==\nReuss left Monte Verit\u00e0 some time before November 1918. On May 10, 1919, Reuss issued a \"Gauge of Amity\" document to [[Matthew McBlain Thomson]], founder of the ill-fated \"American Masonic Federation.\" On September 18, 1919, Reuss was reconsecrated by Bricaud, thus receiving the \"Antioch Succession,\" and re-appointed as \"Gnostic Legate\" to Switzerland for Bricaud's \u00c9glise Gnostique Universelle. In 1920, Oedenkoven and Hofmann abandoned Monte Verit\u00e0 in 1920 to establish a second colony in Brazil, and Reuss published a document titled ''The Program of Construction and the Guiding Principles of the Gnostic Neo-Christians: O.T.O.''\n\nOn July 17, 1920, he attended the Congress of the \"World Federation of Universal Freemasonry\" in [[Z\u00fcrich]], which lasted several days. Reuss, with Bricaud's support, advocated the adoption of the religion of Crowley's Gnostic Mass as the \"official religion for all members of the World Federation of Universal Freemasonry in possession of the 18\u00b0 of the Scottish Rite.\" Reuss's efforts in this regard were a failure, and he left the Congress after the first day. On May 10, 1921, Reuss issued X\u00b0 Charters to [[Charles Stansfeld Jones]] and [[Heinrich Tr\u00e4nker]] to serve as Grand Masters for the US and Germany, respectively. On July 30, 1921, Reuss issued another \"Gauge of Amity\" document, this time to [[Harvey Spencer Lewis|H. Spencer Lewis]], founder of [[Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis|A.M.O.R.C.]], the [[San Jose, California]] based [[Rosicrucian]] organization. Reuss returned to Germany in September 1921, settling in Munich.\n\n==Death and succession==\nThere is some reason to believe that Reuss suffered a stroke in the spring of 1920, but this is not entirely certain. Crowley wrote to W.T. Smith in March 1943: \"the late O.H.O., after his first stroke of paralysis, got into a panic about the work being carried on... He hastily issued honorary diplomas of the Seventh Degree to various people, some of whom had no right to anything at all and some of whom were only cheap crooks.\" Shortly after appointing him his Viceroy for Australia, Crowley appears to have corresponded with his friend [[Frank Bennett (occultist)|Frank (Allan) Bennett]] and discussed with him his doubts about Reuss's continuing ability to effectively govern the Order.\n\nIt would appear that Reuss discovered the correspondence; he wrote Crowley an angry, defensive response on November 9, 1921, in which he appeared to distance himself and O.T.O. from Thelema, which, as shown above, he had previously embraced. Crowley replied to Reuss's letter on November 23, 1921, and stated in his letter, \"It is my will to be O.H.O. and Frater Superior of the Order and avail myself of your abdication\u2014to proclaim myself as such.\" He signed the letter \"[[Baphomet]] O.H.O.\" Reuss's response is not extant, but Crowley recounts in his ''[[The Confessions of Aleister Crowley|Confessions]]'' that Reuss \"resigned the office [of O.H.O.] in 1922 in my favour.\"\n\nHowever, it does not appear that Crowley waited for Reuss's response to assume his duties. In a diary entry for November 27, 1921, Crowley wrote: \"I have proclaimed myself O.H.O. Frater Superior of the Order of Oriental Templars.\" Reuss died on October 28, 1923. In a letter to Heinrich Tr\u00e4nker dated February 14, 1925, Crowley stated the following: \"Reuss was very uncertain in temper, and in many ways unreliable. In his last years he seems to have completely lost his grip, even accusing ''The Book of the Law'' of communistic tendencies, than which no statement could be more absurd. Yet it seems that he must have been to some extent correctly led, on account of his having made the appointments of yourself and Frater Achad ([[Charles Stansfeld Jones]]), and designating me in his last letter as his successor.\" In a letter to Charles Stansfeld Jones dated Sun in [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]], Anno XX (Dec. 1924 - Jan. 1925), Crowley said, \"in the O.H.O.'s last letter to me he invited me to become his successor as O.H.O. and Frater Superior.\" Reuss's letter designating Crowley his successor as O.H.O. has not been found, but no credible documentation has surfaced which would indicate that Reuss ever designated any alternative successor.\n\n==Bibliography==\nReuss's writings include:\n*''The Matrimonial Question from an Anarchistic Point of View'' (1887);\n*''Die Mysterien der Illuminaten'' (1894);\n*''Geschichte des Illuminaten-Ordens'' (1896);\n*''Was muss man von der Freimauerei wissen?''

He was a professional singer in his youth, and was introduced to [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]], in 1873. He took part in the first performance of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Parsifal]]'' at [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus|Bayreuth]] in 1882. Reuss later became a newspaper correspondent, and travelled frequently as such to England, where he became a [[freemasonry|Mason]] at the Pilger Loge No. 238 of the [[United Grand Lodge of England]] in 1876<ref>{{cite news |url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/esoterica/reuss_t/reuss_t.html|title=Albert Karl Theodore Reuss|work=Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon |date=2 July 2014}}</ref>. He also spent some time there as a journalist and as a [[music-hall]] singer under the stage name \"Charles Theodore.\"\n\nIn 1876, Reuss married a woman ten years his senior, Delphina Garbois from [[Dublin]], and moved to [[Munich]] in 1878. Their marriage was annulled, due to bigamy (Hergem\u00f6ller, 1998). They had a son, Albert Franz Theodor Reuss (1879\u20131958), a self-educated [[zoologist]] who lived in [[Berlin]] (Krecs\u00e1k and Bohle 2008).\n\n==Police spy==\nIn 1885, in England, Reuss joined the [[Socialist League (UK, 1885)|Socialist League]]. He had been quite involved as a [[librarian]] and labour secretary. On May 7, 1886 he was expelled as a police spy in the pay of the [[Prussian Secret Police]]. This took place in a sectarian atmosphere, with tensions between [[anarcho-communism|anarcho-communist]] [[Josef Peukert]] and the [[Bakunin]]ist [[Victor Dave]] where such accusations were often made without substance. However, this accusation came from the [[Belgian Labour Party|Belgian Social Democrats]], and was raised here by [[Henry Charles]]. Peukert and the [[Gruppe Autonomie]] published a rebuttal of these allegations which appeared in the ''Anarchist'', which also accused Dave of being a spy. However, in February 1887 Reuss used the unwitting Peukert to track down [[Johann Neve]], an arms smuggler, in Belgium, who was then arrested by the German police. .\n\n==Founds Ordo Templi Orientis==\nIn 1880, in [[Munich]], he participated in an attempt to revive [[Adam Weishaupt]]'s [[Illuminati|Bavarian Order of Illuminati]]. While in England, he became friends with [[William Wynn Westcott]], the Supreme Magus of the [[Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia]] and one of the founders of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]. Westcott provided Reuss with a charter dated July 26, 1901 for the [[Swedenborg Rite|Swedenborgian Rite]] of Masonry and a letter of authorization dated February 24, 1902 to found a High Council in Germania of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia. [[Papus|G\u00e9rard Encausse]] provided him with a charter dated June 24, 1901 designating him Special Inspector for the [[Martinist]] Order in Germany. In 1888, in Berlin, he joined with [[Leopold Engel]] of [[Dresden]], Max Rahn and August Weinholz in another effort to revive the Illuminati Order. In 1895, he began to discuss the formation of [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] with [[Carl Kellner (Ordo Templi Orientis)|Carl Kellner]].\n\nThe discussions between Reuss and Kellner did not lead to any positive results at the time, allegedly because Kellner disapproved of Reuss's connections with Engel. According to Reuss, upon his final separation with Engel in June 1902, Kellner contacted him and the two agreed to proceed with the establishment of the Oriental Templar Order by seeking authorizations to work the various rites of high-grade Masonry.\n\nThe French [[occultist]] and physician [[Papus|G\u00e9rard Encausse]] (perhaps better known by his pen-name Papus) was one such contact. Although not a member of a regular Masonic order, he had founded two occult fraternities: the [[Martinist]] group, l'Ordre des Sup\u00e9rieurs Inconnus and the [[Rosicrucian]] [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] Order of the Rose-Croix. In addition, he was a member of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], and a Bishop in a neo-Gnostic church, l'\u00c9glise Gnostique de France. Encausse provided Reuss with a charter dated June 24, 1901 designating him Special Inspector for the Martinist order in Germany. He also assisted Reuss in the formation of the O.T.O. Gnostic Catholic Church by proclaiming the E.G.C. a \"child\" of l'\u00c9glise Gnostique de France, which linked the E.G.C. to French neo-gnosticism.\n\nMeanwhile, Westcott assisted Reuss in contacting the English Masonic scholar, [[John Yarker]] (1833\u20131913). Along with his associates [[Franz Hartmann]] and Henry Klein, he activated the Masonic Rites of Memphis and Mizraim and a branch of the [[Scottish Rite]] in Germany with charters from Yarker. Reuss received letters-patent as a Sovereign Grand Inspector General 33\u00b0 of the Cernau Scottish Rite from Yarker dated September 24, 1902. On the same date, Yarker appears to have issued a warrant to Reuss, Franz Hartmann and Henry Klein to operate a Sovereign Sanctuary 33\u00b0-95\u00b0 of the Scottish, Memphis and Mizraim rites. The original document is not extant, but a transcript of this warrant was published in 1911 in Reuss's newsletter, [[The Oriflamme]], which commenced publication in 1902. Yarker issued a charter confirming Reuss's authority to operate said rites on July 1, 1904; and Reuss published a transcript of an additional confirming charter dated June 24, 1905. Reuss and Kellner together prepared a brief manifesto for their Order in 1903, which was published the next year in ''The Oriflamme''.\n\nWhen Carl Kellner died in 1905, the leadership of the Academia Masonica of O.T.O. fell upon Reuss's shoulders, and he incorporated all his other organizations under its banner, developing the three degrees of the Academia Masonica, available to Masons only, into a coherent, self-contained initiatory system, open to both men and women. He promulgated a constitution for this new, enlarged O.T.O. on June 21, 1906 in London (his place of residence since January 1906) and the next month proclaimed himself Outer Head of the Order (O.H.O.). That same year he published ''Lingham-Yoni'', which was a German translation of [[Hargrave Jennings]]'s work ''Phallism'', and issued a warrant to [[Rudolf Steiner]] (1861\u20131925, who was at the time the Secretary General of the German branch of the [[Theosophical Society]]), making him Deputy Grand Master of a subordinate O.T.O./Memphis/Mizraim Chapter and Grand Council called \"Mystica Aeterna\" in Berlin. Steiner went on to found the Anthroposophical Society in 1912, and ended his association with Reuss in 1914.\n\nOn June 24, 1908, Reuss attended Encausse's \"International Masonic and Spiritualist Conference\" in Paris. At this conference, Reuss raised Encausse to the X\u00b0 of the O.T.O.'s Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica and gave him a patent to establish a \"Supreme Grand Council General of the Unified Rites of Antient and Primitive Masonry for the Grand Orient of France and its Dependencies at Paris. \" He possibly received in return some position of authority in the \u00c9glise Catholique Gnostique. Reuss also appointed Dr. [[Arnold Krumm-Heller]] (Huiracocha, 1879\u20131949) as his official representative for Latin America.\n\n==Meets Aleister Crowley==\nWhile living in London, Reuss became acquainted with [[Aleister Crowley]]. In 1910, he made Crowley a VII\u00b0 of O.T.O. (because of Crowley's having been given the 33\u00b0 by Don Jesus Medina in an irregular Scottish Rite lodge in Mexico City), and in 1912, he conferred upon him the IX\u00b0 and appointed him National Grand Master General X\u00b0 for the O.T.O. in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland by charter dated June 1, 1912. Crowley's appointment included authority over an English language rite of the lower (Masonic) degrees of O.T.O. which was given the name [[Mysteria Mystica Maxima]], or M\u2234M\u2234M\u2234. In 1913, Crowley issued a Constitution for the M\u2234M\u2234M\u2234 and the Manifesto of the M\u2234M\u2234M\u2234, which he subsequently redrafted and issued as Liber LII (52), the ''Manifesto of the O.T.O.'' In 1913, Crowley wrote [[The Gnostic Mass|Liber XV]], the Gnostic Mass for Reuss's [[Gnostic Catholic Church]]. Crowley also dedicated his Mystery Play ''The Ship'' (1913) and a collection of poetry, ''The Giant's Thumb'' (1915) to Reuss. In 1913 he became Grand Master of the [[Rite of Memphis-Misra\u00efm]], a masonic group which previously included the revolutionaries [[Louis Blanc]] and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] amongst its ranks.\n\nIn 1914, at the outset of [[World War I]], Reuss left England and returned to Germany. He worked briefly for the [[Red Cross]] in Berlin, then, in 1916, moved to [[Basle, Switzerland]]. While there, he established an \"Anational Grand Lodge and Mystic Temple\" of O.T.O. and the [[Hermetic Brotherhood of Light]] at [[Monte Verit\u00e0]], a utopian commune near Ascona founded in 1900 by [[Henri Oedenkoven]] and [[Ida Hofmann]], which functioned as a center for the Progressive Underground. On January 22, 1917, Reuss published a manifesto for this Anational Grand Lodge, which was called \"Verit\u00e0 Mystica.\" On the same date, he published a ''Revised O.T.O. Constitution of 1917'' (based in a large part on Crowley's 1913 Constitution of the M.M.M.), with a \"Synopsis of Degrees\" and an abridgment of \"The Message of the Master Therion\" appended. Reuss held an \"Anational Congress for Organising the Reconstruction of Society on Practical Cooperative Lines\" at Monte Verit\u00e0 August 15\u201325, 1917. This Congress included readings of Crowley's poetry (on August 22) and a recitation of Crowley's Gnostic Mass (on August 24). On October 24, 1917, Reuss Chartered an O.T.O. Lodge, \"Libertas et Fraternitas\" in Z\u00fcrich. This Lodge later placed itself under the Masonic jurisdiction of the [[Grand Lodge Alpina of Switzerland]].\n\nIn 1918, Reuss published his German translation of Crowley's Gnostic Mass. In a note at the end of his translation of Liber XV, he referred to himself as, simultaneously, the Sovereign Patriarch and Primate of the Gnostic Catholic Church, and Gnostic Legate to Switzerland of the \u00c9glise Gnostique Universelle, acknowledging [[Jean Bricaud]] (1881\u20131934) as Sovereign Patriarch of that church. The issuance of this document can be viewed as the birth of the Thelemic E.G.C. as an independent organization under the umbrella of O.T.O., with Reuss as its first Patriarch.\n\nReuss was clearly impressed with [[Thelema]]. Crowley's Gnostic Mass, which Reuss translated into German and had recited at his Anational Congress at Monte Verit\u00e0, is an explicitly Thelemic ritual. In an undated letter to Crowley (received in 1917), Reuss reported excitedly that he had read ''The Message of the Master Therion'' to a gathering at Monte Verit\u00e0, and that he was translating [[The Book of the Law]] into German. He added, \"Let this news encourage you! We live in your Work!!!\"\n\n==After the First World War==\nReuss left Monte Verit\u00e0 some time before November 1918. On May 10, 1919, Reuss issued a \"Gauge of Amity\" document to [[Matthew McBlain Thomson]], founder of the ill-fated \"American Masonic Federation.\" On September 18, 1919, Reuss was reconsecrated by Bricaud, thus receiving the \"Antioch Succession,\" and re-appointed as \"Gnostic Legate\" to Switzerland for Bricaud's \u00c9glise Gnostique Universelle. In 1920, Oedenkoven and Hofmann abandoned Monte Verit\u00e0 in 1920 to establish a second colony in Brazil, and Reuss published a document titled ''The Program of Construction and the Guiding Principles of the Gnostic Neo-Christians: O.T.O.''\n\nOn July 17, 1920, he attended the Congress of the \"World Federation of Universal Freemasonry\" in [[Z\u00fcrich]], which lasted several days. Reuss, with Bricaud's support, advocated the adoption of the religion of Crowley's Gnostic Mass as the \"official religion for all members of the World Federation of Universal Freemasonry in possession of the 18\u00b0 of the Scottish Rite.\" Reuss's efforts in this regard were a failure, and he left the Congress after the first day. On May 10, 1921, Reuss issued X\u00b0 Charters to [[Charles Stansfeld Jones]] and [[Heinrich Tr\u00e4nker]] to serve as Grand Masters for the US and Germany, respectively. On July 30, 1921, Reuss issued another \"Gauge of Amity\" document, this time to [[Harvey Spencer Lewis|H. Spencer Lewis]], founder of [[Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis|A.M.O.R.C.]], the [[San Jose, California]] based [[Rosicrucian]] organization. Reuss returned to Germany in September 1921, settling in Munich.\n\n==Death and succession==\nThere is some reason to believe that Reuss suffered a stroke in the spring of 1920, but this is not entirely certain. Crowley wrote to W.T. Smith in March 1943: \"the late O.H.O., after his first stroke of paralysis, got into a panic about the work being carried on... He hastily issued honorary diplomas of the Seventh Degree to various people, some of whom had no right to anything at all and some of whom were only cheap crooks.\" Shortly after appointing him his Viceroy for Australia, Crowley appears to have corresponded with his friend [[Frank Bennett (occultist)|Frank (Allan) Bennett]] and discussed with him his doubts about Reuss's continuing ability to effectively govern the Order.\n\nIt would appear that Reuss discovered the correspondence; he wrote Crowley an angry, defensive response on November 9, 1921, in which he appeared to distance himself and O.T.O. from Thelema, which, as shown above, he had previously embraced. Crowley replied to Reuss's letter on November 23, 1921, and stated in his letter, \"It is my will to be O.H.O. and Frater Superior of the Order and avail myself of your abdication\u2014to proclaim myself as such.\" He signed the letter \"[[Baphomet]] O.H.O.\" Reuss's response is not extant, but Crowley recounts in his ''[[The Confessions of Aleister Crowley|Confessions]]'' that Reuss \"resigned the office [of O.H.O.] in 1922 in my favour.\"\n\nHowever, it does not appear that Crowley waited for Reuss's response to assume his duties. In a diary entry for November 27, 1921, Crowley wrote: \"I have proclaimed myself O.H.O. Frater Superior of the Order of Oriental Templars.\" Reuss died on October 28, 1923. In a letter to Heinrich Tr\u00e4nker dated February 14, 1925, Crowley stated the following: \"Reuss was very uncertain in temper, and in many ways unreliable.

This flew in the face of the AAU and the International Olympic Committee, which greeted the ITA with outright hostility, clinging to the timeworn Olympic credo that track and field athletes should be unpaid amateurs. The AAU immediately banned all ITA athletes and officials from participating in AAU-sanctioned meets. Likewise, ITA athletes received lifetime bans from Olympic participation. The AAU also pressured television networks from broadcasting ITA events. In addition to Smith, a number of world-class track and field stars had joined the ITA, including [[Bob Seagren]], [[Lee Evans (sprinter)|Lee Evans]], [[Jim Ryun]], [[Brian Oldfield]], [[Kipchoge Keino|Kip Keino]], [[Ben Jipcho]] and [[Marty Liquori]].

This flew in the face of the AAU and the International Olympic Committee, which greeted the ITA with outright hostility, clinging to the timeworn Olympic credo that track and field athletes should be unpaid amateurs. The AAU immediately banned all ITA athletes and officials from participating in AAU-sanctioned meets. Likewise, ITA athletes received lifetime bans from Olympic participation. The AAU also pressured television networks from broadcasting ITA events. In addition to Smith, a number of world-class track and field stars had joined the ITA, including [[Bob Seagren]], [[Lee Evans (sprinter)|Lee Evans]], [[Jim Ryun]], [[Brian Oldfield]], [[Kipchoge Keino|Kip Keino]], [[Ben Jipcho]] and [[Marty Liquori]]. The ITA managed to stage over 51 meets during its existence, but its demise came shortly after the 1976 Montreal Olympics when most track and field athletes, intimidated by the AAU and the IOC, shied away from the ITA for fear of hurting their amateur status.<ref>{{Citation|title=International Track Association|date=2019-04-06|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Track_Association&oldid=891149850|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-04-13}}</ref>\n\n=== High School Coaching ===\nSmith retired from international racing in the mid-'70s and settled in [[Bishop, California|Bishop]], CA, where he taught school and was an assistant track coach in charge of the boys and girls distance runners at [[Bishop Union High School]].

The sport is known as the world's most powerful motorsport, due to the multi-engined modified tractor pullers.\n\nAll tractors in their respective classes pull a set weight in the drag (sled). When a tractor gets to the end of the 100 metre track, this is known as a \"full pull\". When more than one [[tractor]] completes the course, more weight is added to the drag (sled), and those competitors that moved past {{convert|300|ft|disp=flip}} will compete in a pull-off; the winner is the one who can pull the drag (sled) the farthest.\n\nThe drag (sled) is known as a ''weight transfer drag (sled)''. This means that, as it is pulled down the track, the weight is transferred (linked with gears to the drag\u2019s (sled) wheels) from over the rear axles and towards the front of the drag (sled). In front of the rear wheels, instead of front wheels, there is a \"pan\". This is essentially a metal plate, and as the weight moves toward it, the resistance between the pan and the ground builds. The farther the tractor pulls the drag (sled), the more difficult it gets.\n\nThe most powerful tractors, such as those in the heavy modified class in Europe, can produce over {{convert|12000|PS|disp=flip}}.\n\n{{anchor|History in the USA}}\n\n==History in the US==\nPrior to the invention of the tractor, when [[farm implement]]s were pulled by [[horse]]s, farmers would boast about the strength of their teams and seek to compare and contest in teams with one another to see who had the most powerful animals. In some cases, they compared horse teams pulling large loads over distance, such as a fully loaded hay [[cart]] or [[wagon]]. In other situations, a flat board or skid would have a horse or team of horses then hitched to it; weight would be added, usually in the form of rocks, and the driver would urge his horses to pull the load, with more weight added as competitors were eliminated; the animals pulling the most weight or for the greatest distance were judged the strongest. These events became the formalized sport of [[horse pulling]], which is still carried out today with [[draft horses]], specially bred to have high strength for pulling heavy loads. Today, fixed weights on drags (sled)  are dragged for a set distance and additional weight is added in successive rounds. While it is said that the term [[horsepower]] is derived from this event, the concept was developed earlier, in experiments and measurements performed by [[James Watt]] and [[Mason Worrell]].\n\nIt wasn't until 1929 that motorized vehicles were put to use in the first events at [[Vaughansville, Missouri]], and [[Bowling Green, Ohio]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe50s/machines_09.html|title=Tractor Pulling during the 1950s and 60s|website=livinghistoryfarm.org|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>. Although the sport was recognized then, it did not really become popular until the '50s and '60s. It was also realized, at that time, there were no uniform set of rules. The rules varied from [[U.S. state|state]] to state, [[County (United States)|county]] to county, and competitors never knew what standards to follow. This made the sport difficult for new entrants.\n\nIn 1969, representatives from eight states congregated to create a uniform book of rules to give the sport the much needed structure, and created the [[National Tractor Pullers Association]] (NTPA). The NTPA's early years were events that used standard farm vehicles, with the motto \"Pull on Sunday, plow on Monday\". Pulling remained basically the same through the '70s, with only stock and modified tractors. Stock tractors were commercially available tractors produced by manufacturers, and modified tractors were the basic tractor chassis with another non-tractor engine mounted on it.\n\nTractors remained single engine until two Ohio brothers, Carl and Paul Bosse, introduced the [[Transmission (mechanics)|crossbox]] which could allow multiple engines to be attached to a single [[driveshaft]]. Other innovators during this period included Bruce Hutcherson, with his triple Rodeck engine powered \"Makin Bacon Special\", Dave and Ralph Banter and their Chevrolet powered tractors, and the \"Mission Impossible\" tractors of Tim Engler, which at one point had up to seven [[supercharger|blown]] [[Methanol fuel|alcohol]] engines on board.\n\nSubsequently, modified tractors with four engines were common, while stock tractors tried to catch up by adding multiple large [[turbochargers]], along with [[intercooler]]s, but both retained the appearance of a [[tractor]]. Soon tractors became single-use machines that were not used on the farm, making the \"Pull on Sunday, plow on Monday\" motto obsolete.\n\nThroughout the '70s and '80s the modified division continued to thrill crowds by adding more engines, and soon the tractors lost their tractor appearance and turned into high 'spec' [[drag racing|dragster]]s. The limit was reached in 1988 when a tractor with seven engines was built. As well as [[piston engines]], [[Turboshaft|turbine engines]] (frequently mistakenly called \"[[Jet engine|jet engines]]\") appeared in 1974, with Gardner Stone's \"General\" Tractor a four-[[turboshaft]] unit hitting the hook in 1989.\n\nThe growing popularity of the sport caused the creation of a new [[four-wheel drive]] [[Division (sport)|division]] in 1976, which captured a large fan base. The engine sizes in these vehicles continued to increase, from {{convert|450|cuin|disp=flip}} up to {{convert|700|cuin|disp=flip}} and probably would have continued, but the NTPA limited it to {{convert|650|cuin|disp=flip}} [[naturally aspirated]] and no [[supercharger|blown engine]] in 1989. Today the 4-wheel drive division is one of the most popular with the success of trucks like the Holman Brothers \"4-Play\" Chevy and Bob Boden's \"Studley Studebaker\".\n\n===Two-wheel-drive (2WD) truck class===\nThe [[two-wheel drive]] (2WD) division was introduced in 1983.\n\nThe division imposes a weight-limit of {{convert|6200|lb|disp=flip}} on each competing truck, a maximum width of {{convert|8|ft|disp=flip}}, and a maximum distance of {{convert|15|ft||disp=flip}} from the centerline of the rear axle to the front of the vehicle (including weight racks and tow hook). (The length restriction allows for up to {{convert|10|in|disp=flip}} of cosmetic fiberglass, however.)\n\nAlcohol methane engines with up to eight cylinders are permitted, but diesel engines are not. Any wheelbase is permitted.\n\nThe National Tractor Pullers Association restricts engines to {{convert|575|cuin|disp=flip|abbr=on}} and two valves per cylinder. They permit tubular steel frames. The maximum tire size for the 2WD class is {{convert|18.4|x|16.1|in|disp=flip|abbr=on}}, with a maximum circumference of {{convert|143|in|disp=flip|abbr=on}} when mounted on an {{convert|18|in|adj=on|disp=flip}} rim and inflated to {{convert|28|psi|disp=flip}}. The ground patch is not to exceed {{convert|19|in|disp=flip}} on original tread.<ref>2010 Pulling Rules, National Tractor Pullers Association (NTPA), A division of World Pulling International, Inc. (WPI)</ref>\n\n===Super stock, pro-stock, and mini-modified===\nSuper Stock tractor Open class uses primarily methanol fuel (some are diesel versions). The Super Stock Open machines can generate over {{convert|6000|PS|disp=flip}} an {{convert|4000|lbfft|disp=flip}} of torque, with billet or re-cast engine blocks. Super Stock Open and Super Stock Diesel tractors may use up to four turbochargers in three stages. The Diesel super stock tractors generate close to {{convert|5000|PS|disp=flip}} and {{convert|6000|lbfft|disp=flip}} of torque and are allowed to compete in the Open class, which very rarely occurs anymore. However, a true Open (methanol fuel) tractor is not allowed to compete in the Diesel class.\n\nThere is light Super Stock class which is {{convert|6200|lb|disp=flip}} and the Heavy Super Stock Classes that are {{convert|8000|-|8250|lb|disp=flip}}.\n\nDiesel Pro Stock Tractors are limited to one turbocharger and diesel fuel is the only allowable source for power, in keeping with the 'spirit' of the original tractors. The maximum engine displacement is {{convert|680|cuin|disp=flip}}.  These engines can achieve around {{convert|3700|PS|disp=flip}} and {{convert|5500|lbfft|disp=flip}} of tourqe<ref>http://www.ntpapull.com/Gregg's%20Releases/St.%20Hyacinthe%202006.htm{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In recent years, new classes have been created to appeal to different groups of pullers. There is now a class called Limited Pro Stock that is limited to {{convert|640|cuin|abbr=on|disp=flip}} engine and {{convert|4.1|in|disp=flip}} turbocharger. This class typically pulls at {{convert|9300|-|9500|lb|disp=flip}} and is slightly restricted, as opposed to the Pro Stock class, which can run up to {{convert|680|cuin|abbr=on|disp=flip}} engine and an unrestricted size [[turbocharger]], along with intercoolers.\n\nThe latest addition to Pro Stocks is the Light Pro Stock Class that typically pulls {{convert|8300|-|8600|lb|disp=flip}} depending on location. These tractors are limited to {{convert|540|cuin|abbr=on|disp=flip}} engines but can run any size turbo. They are not allowed to run intercoolers, however these tractors are making an average of {{convert|2500|-|2800|PS|disp=flip}}. The light overall weight makes this a driver's class as significant skill is required to keep the tractor on the track.\n\nThe mini-modified class is a highly specialized and custom built tractor to be fitted with a naturally aspirated engine, at minimum. NTPA Minis are limited to {{convert|575|cuin|abbr=on|disp=flip}} (always an aftermarket V-8 engine block) and uses up to a 14-71 hi helix supercharger. With the driver, they weight only {{convert|2050|lb|disp=flip}}. Today's engine is capable of a minimum of {{convert|2500|PS|disp=flip}} on methanol or ethanol. Their reputation is known as the wildest ride in pulling, as naturally it is a very high horsepower to weight ratio. Whereas, their larger counterparts, the Modifieds, will weigh {{convert|6000|,|7500|and|8000|lb|disp=flip}}, utilizing the same engine that a Mini has, but, with multiple powerplants per custom built tractor chassis. Usually, a maximum of five engines is all that will make the {{convert|8000|lb|disp=flip}} weight limit.  [[Nitromethane]] and oxidizers were outlawed in 1976.\n\n== Antique Tractor Pulling ==\n[[File:3OliverTractors.jpg|thumb|Oliver Antique Tractor]]\nAntique tractor pulling is how tractor pulling first got started. As early as 1929, farmers began attaching their tractors to drags, and dragging it down a field to see who could pull it the furthest <ref name=\":1\" />. People who were event organizers at Bowling Green, Missouri and Vaughansville, Ohio found out farmers were doing this and that it drew spectators<ref name=\":1\" />. By 1950, county fairs across the country started featuring tractor pulls<ref name=\":1\" />. Spectators found it fascinating to see machines that would \u201cPull on Sunday, plow on Monday\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />. At first competitors would use a \u2018Human Drag\u2019, meaning a drag that was weighted by humans, different people would be added as the tractor made it down the track. However, organizers began to look at different ways to add weight to the drag, as spectators walking on the drag while moving proved to be a hazard <ref name=\":1\" />. In the late 60s, a weight-exchanging drag was created, the drag that was created was basically a flatbed truck trailer with wheels near the back and a drag at the front <ref name=\":1\" />. A mass that is moveable of up to 65,000 pounds or 29,000 kilograms, the mass starts at the back of the sled, slowly working its way up to the top as the drag moves down the track <ref name=\":1\" />. \n\nThe tractors are divided into different weight classes based on the tractor weight, the weight classes starting at 2500 and ending at 14000 pounds. The tractors could go in any class they choose, a lot of tractors will weight their tractors up, so they fit into the higher weighted classes. In order to be able to compete in Antique tractor pull competitions your tractor must have the original speed the tractor is supposed to have. Some pulling competitions will have a \u2018dyno\u2019 so you can \u2018dyno\u2019 your tractor, which means hooking up the PTO shaft on your tractor to the machine to test the horsepower. If your tractor shows it has more horse power than the original tractor is supposed to have, you get put into an alternate class called \u2018Modified Tractors\u2019. They do this to avoid the tractors that have been modified always winning, they want a fair competition.   \n\nMost antique tractors when pulling needs about 14-15 pounds in their tires, however it could be more or less depending on the rules of the competition you are entering. There is also a drawbar rule, it is to be a minimum of two square inches in total steel at any point, as well must be rigid in all directions.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.peitruckandtractorpull.com/rules|title=PEI Truck & Tractor Pull Championships|website=www.peitruckandtractorpull.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> The hitching device can be no more than 1 1/2 inch round stock (1 1/2 square), or less than 1 1/8 inch round stock (1 inch square), the hole has to be 3\"X3 3/4\"- inch diameter<ref name=\":2\" />. The drawbar on a tractor should be no shorter than 18 inches from the center of the rear axle to the point of the hitch<ref name=\":2\" />. All the weights that are on your tractor has to be non-moveable, they have to be safety secured to the tractor, bungee cords are not allowed to be used<ref name=\":2\" />. All drivers when pulling need to remain seated, if they get out of there seat they could face disqualification. However, all these rules can change depending on what competition you go too.    \n\n==History in Australia==\n\n[[File:Sheffield Tractor Pull.JPG|thumb|right|Tractor pull at [[Sheffield, Tasmania]]]]\nThe first Australian Tractor Pull was held at the Elmore Field Days (Victoria) in 1976. The following year saw Tractor Pulling begin in the Victorian rural town of [[Quambatook]].  It has developed over the years into a highly competitive and technical sport, where the difference between first and last place may be as small as one or two metres. Often the top tractors are separated by mere centimetres.\n \nThe Australian Tractor Pullers Association (ATPA) is a non-profit organisation that governs Tractor Pulling in Australia. Our events (Tractor Pulls) are held in conjunction with a promoter. This is often a local school, sporting, service or community club (for example; Apex, Rotary, Lions, Netball, Cricket, Football) who use the event as a fundraiser. Tractor Pulls are held in locations throughout Australia, predominantly in Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales. In the west the Western Australian Tractor Pullers Association (WATPA) runs events and is affiliated with the ATPA.\n \nThe ATPA is focused on actively promoting this spectacular sport and working with communities to not only establish a unique annual event, but more importantly to assist communities financially through the influx of spectators, sponsors and promotion.\n\nThe tractors are divided into classes and comply with either \"Limited\" or \"Open\" rules. The classes are Open Modified, Super Modified, Limited Modified, Open Mini Modified, Mini Modified, Pro Stock (diesel) and Two Wheel Drive Trucks. The distinction between classes is determined by the overall maximum weight, engine modifications, fuels and physical size.\n\nCompetition is open to both women and men, the only restriction being that competitors must at least hold a current Learner Driver\u2019s Permit. It sometimes comes down to members of the same family competing for the trophies.\n\nThe Junior Modified Pulling Association conducts an \"introductory\" class for 8- to 16-year-olds to develop driving, mechanical and competitive skills.  The Modified Mowers pull their own smaller version of the big sled.\n\n==Drag (Sled) pulling==\n[[File:Truck And Tractor Pull Sled 2011 Mackville Nationals.jpg|thumb|right|Sled]]\n[[File:Tractor Pull Full pull marker.jpg|thumb|left|Full Pull marker]]\nIn the early days two main techniques were used. Either a dead weight of fixed mass was dragged, or the step-on method was used, where people stood at fixed positions and stepped aboard as the drag passed.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Pulling 101 - NTPA Pull|url = http://www.ntpapull.com/pulling-101|website = www.ntpapull.com|accessdate = 2015-09-07}}</ref> Another rule which has now been dropped was that a speed limit should be observed because of injuries resulting from the increased speed at which they boarded. Today's tractors can achieve theoretical speeds over {{convert|125|mph|sigfig=1|disp=flip|abbr=on}}.\n\nToday's drags (sled) use a complex system of gears to move weights up to {{convert|65000|lb|disp=flip}}.

The sport is known as the world's most powerful motorsport, due to the multi-engined modified tractor pullers.\n\nAll tractors in their respective classes pull a set weight in the drag (sled). When a tractor gets to the end of the 100 metre track, this is known as a \"full pull\". When more than one [[tractor]] completes the course, more weight is added to the drag (sled), and those competitors that moved past {{convert|300|ft|disp=flip}} will compete in a pull-off; the winner is the one who can pull the drag (sled) the farthest.\n\nThe drag (sled) is known as a ''weight transfer drag (sled)''. This means that, as it is pulled down the track, the weight is transferred (linked with gears to the drag\u2019s (sled) wheels) from over the rear axles and towards the front of the drag (sled). In front of the rear wheels, instead of front wheels, there is a \"pan\". This is essentially a metal plate, and as the weight moves toward it, the resistance between the pan and the ground builds. The farther the tractor pulls the drag (sled), the more difficult it gets.\n\nThe most powerful tractors, such as those in the heavy modified class in Europe, can produce over {{convert|12000|PS|disp=flip}}.\n\n{{anchor|History in the USA}}\n\n==History in the US==\nPrior to the invention of the tractor, when [[farm implement]]s were pulled by [[horse]]s, farmers would boast about the strength of their teams and seek to compare and contest in teams with one another to see who had the most powerful animals. In some cases, they compared horse teams pulling large loads over distance, such as a fully loaded hay [[cart]] or [[wagon]]. In other situations, a flat board or skid would have a horse or team of horses then hitched to it; weight would be added, usually in the form of rocks, and the driver would urge his horses to pull the load, with more weight added as competitors were eliminated; the animals pulling the most weight or for the greatest distance were judged the strongest. These events became the formalized sport of [[horse pulling]], which is still carried out today with [[draft horses]], specially bred to have high strength for pulling heavy loads. Today, fixed weights on drags (sled)  are dragged for a set distance and additional weight is added in successive rounds. While it is said that the term [[horsepower]] is derived from this event, the concept was developed earlier, in experiments and measurements performed by [[James Watt]] and [[Mason Worrell]].\n\nIt wasn't until 1929 that motorized vehicles were put to use in the first events at [[Vaughansville, Missouri]], and [[Bowling Green, Ohio]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe50s/machines_09.html|title=Tractor Pulling during the 1950s and 60s|website=livinghistoryfarm.org|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>. Although the sport was recognized then, it did not really become popular until the '50s and '60s. It was also realized, at that time, there were no uniform set of rules. The rules varied from [[U.S. state|state]] to state, [[County (United States)|county]] to county, and competitors never knew what standards to follow. This made the sport difficult for new entrants.\n\nIn 1969, representatives from eight states congregated to create a uniform book of rules to give the sport the much needed structure, and created the [[National Tractor Pullers Association]] (NTPA). The NTPA's early years were events that used standard farm vehicles, with the motto \"Pull on Sunday, plow on Monday\". Pulling remained basically the same through the '70s, with only stock and modified tractors. Stock tractors were commercially available tractors produced by manufacturers, and modified tractors were the basic tractor chassis with another non-tractor engine mounted on it.\n\nTractors remained single engine until two Ohio brothers, Carl and Paul Bosse, introduced the [[Transmission (mechanics)|crossbox]] which could allow multiple engines to be attached to a single [[driveshaft]]. Other innovators during this period included Bruce Hutcherson, with his triple Rodeck engine powered \"Makin Bacon Special\", Dave and Ralph Banter and their Chevrolet powered tractors, and the \"Mission Impossible\" tractors of Tim Engler, which at one point had up to seven [[supercharger|blown]] [[Methanol fuel|alcohol]] engines on board.\n\nSubsequently, modified tractors with four engines were common, while stock tractors tried to catch up by adding multiple large [[turbochargers]], along with [[intercooler]]s, but both retained the appearance of a [[tractor]]. Soon tractors became single-use machines that were not used on the farm, making the \"Pull on Sunday, plow on Monday\" motto obsolete.\n\nThroughout the '70s and '80s the modified division continued to thrill crowds by adding more engines, and soon the tractors lost their tractor appearance and turned into high 'spec' [[drag racing|dragster]]s. The limit was reached in 1988 when a tractor with seven engines was built. As well as [[piston engines]], [[Turboshaft|turbine engines]] (frequently mistakenly called \"[[Jet engine|jet engines]]\") appeared in 1974, with Gardner Stone's \"General\" Tractor a four-[[turboshaft]] unit hitting the hook in 1989.\n\nThe growing popularity of the sport caused the creation of a new [[four-wheel drive]] [[Division (sport)|division]] in 1976, which captured a large fan base. The engine sizes in these vehicles continued to increase, from {{convert|450|cuin|disp=flip}} up to {{convert|700|cuin|disp=flip}} and probably would have continued, but the NTPA limited it to {{convert|650|cuin|disp=flip}} [[naturally aspirated]] and no [[supercharger|blown engine]] in 1989. Today the 4-wheel drive division is one of the most popular with the success of trucks like the Holman Brothers \"4-Play\" Chevy and Bob Boden's \"Studley Studebaker\".\n\n===Two-wheel-drive (2WD) truck class===\nThe [[two-wheel drive]] (2WD) division was introduced in 1983.\n\nThe division imposes a weight-limit of {{convert|6200|lb|disp=flip}} on each competing truck, a maximum width of {{convert|8|ft|disp=flip}}, and a maximum distance of {{convert|15|ft||disp=flip}} from the centerline of the rear axle to the front of the vehicle (including weight racks and tow hook). (The length restriction allows for up to {{convert|10|in|disp=flip}} of cosmetic fiberglass, however.)\n\nAlcohol methane engines with up to eight cylinders are permitted, but diesel engines are not. Any wheelbase is permitted.\n\nThe National Tractor Pullers Association restricts engines to {{convert|575|cuin|disp=flip|abbr=on}} and two valves per cylinder. They permit tubular steel frames. The maximum tire size for the 2WD class is {{convert|18.4|x|16.1|in|disp=flip|abbr=on}}, with a maximum circumference of {{convert|143|in|disp=flip|abbr=on}} when mounted on an {{convert|18|in|adj=on|disp=flip}} rim and inflated to {{convert|28|psi|disp=flip}}. The ground patch is not to exceed {{convert|19|in|disp=flip}} on original tread.<ref>2010 Pulling Rules, National Tractor Pullers Association (NTPA), A division of World Pulling International, Inc. (WPI)</ref>\n\n===Super stock, pro-stock, and mini-modified===\nSuper Stock tractor Open class uses primarily methanol fuel (some are diesel versions). The Super Stock Open machines can generate over {{convert|6000|PS|disp=flip}} an {{convert|4000|lbfft|disp=flip}} of torque, with billet or re-cast engine blocks. Super Stock Open and Super Stock Diesel tractors may use up to four turbochargers in three stages. The Diesel super stock tractors generate close to {{convert|5000|PS|disp=flip}} and {{convert|6000|lbfft|disp=flip}} of torque and are allowed to compete in the Open class, which very rarely occurs anymore. However, a true Open (methanol fuel) tractor is not allowed to compete in the Diesel class.\n\nThere is light Super Stock class which is {{convert|6200|lb|disp=flip}} and the Heavy Super Stock Classes that are {{convert|8000|-|8250|lb|disp=flip}}.\n\nDiesel Pro Stock Tractors are limited to one turbocharger and diesel fuel is the only allowable source for power, in keeping with the 'spirit' of the original tractors. The maximum engine displacement is {{convert|680|cuin|disp=flip}}.  These engines can achieve around {{convert|3700|PS|disp=flip}} and {{convert|5500|lbfft|disp=flip}} of tourqe<ref>http://www.ntpapull.com/Gregg's%20Releases/St.%20Hyacinthe%202006.htm{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In recent years, new classes have been created to appeal to different groups of pullers. There is now a class called Limited Pro Stock that is limited to {{convert|640|cuin|abbr=on|disp=flip}} engine and {{convert|4.1|in|disp=flip}} turbocharger. This class typically pulls at {{convert|9300|-|9500|lb|disp=flip}} and is slightly restricted, as opposed to the Pro Stock class, which can run up to {{convert|680|cuin|abbr=on|disp=flip}} engine and an unrestricted size [[turbocharger]], along with intercoolers.\n\nThe latest addition to Pro Stocks is the Light Pro Stock Class that typically pulls {{convert|8300|-|8600|lb|disp=flip}} depending on location. These tractors are limited to {{convert|540|cuin|abbr=on|disp=flip}} engines but can run any size turbo. They are not allowed to run intercoolers, however these tractors are making an average of {{convert|2500|-|2800|PS|disp=flip}}. The light overall weight makes this a driver's class as significant skill is required to keep the tractor on the track.\n\nThe mini-modified class is a highly specialized and custom built tractor to be fitted with a naturally aspirated engine, at minimum. NTPA Minis are limited to {{convert|575|cuin|abbr=on|disp=flip}} (always an aftermarket V-8 engine block) and uses up to a 14-71 hi helix supercharger. With the driver, they weight only {{convert|2050|lb|disp=flip}}. Today's engine is capable of a minimum of {{convert|2500|PS|disp=flip}} on methanol or ethanol. Their reputation is known as the wildest ride in pulling, as naturally it is a very high horsepower to weight ratio. Whereas, their larger counterparts, the Modifieds, will weigh {{convert|6000|,|7500|and|8000|lb|disp=flip}}, utilizing the same engine that a Mini has, but, with multiple powerplants per custom built tractor chassis. Usually, a maximum of five engines is all that will make the {{convert|8000|lb|disp=flip}} weight limit.  [[Nitromethane]] and oxidizers were outlawed in 1976.\n\n== Antique Tractor Pulling ==\n[[File:3OliverTractors.jpg|thumb|Oliver Antique Tractor]]\nAntique tractor pulling is how tractor pulling first got started. As early as 1929, farmers began attaching their tractors to drags, and dragging it down a field to see who could pull it the furthest <ref name=\":1\" />. People who were event organizers at Bowling Green, Missouri and Vaughansville, Ohio found out farmers were doing this and that it drew spectators<ref name=\":1\" />. By 1950, county fairs across the country started featuring tractor pulls<ref name=\":1\" />. Spectators found it fascinating to see machines that would \u201cPull on Sunday, plow on Monday\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />. At first competitors would use a \u2018Human Drag\u2019, meaning a drag that was weighted by humans, different people would be added as the tractor made it down the track. However, organizers began to look at different ways to add weight to the drag, as spectators walking on the drag while moving proved to be a hazard <ref name=\":1\" />. In the late 60s, a weight-exchanging drag was created, the drag that was created was basically a flatbed truck trailer with wheels near the back and a drag at the front <ref name=\":1\" />. A mass that is moveable of up to 65,000 pounds or 29,000 kilograms, the mass starts at the back of the sled, slowly working its way up to the top as the drag moves down the track <ref name=\":1\" />. \n\nThe tractors are divided into different weight classes based on the tractor weight, the weight classes starting at 2500 and ending at 14000 pounds. The tractors could go in any class they choose, a lot of tractors will weight their tractors up, so they fit into the higher weighted classes. In order to be able to compete in Antique tractor pull competitions your tractor must have the original speed the tractor is supposed to have. Some pulling competitions will have a \u2018dyno\u2019 so you can \u2018dyno\u2019 your tractor, which means hooking up the PTO shaft on your tractor to the machine to test the horsepower. If your tractor shows it has more horse power than the original tractor is supposed to have, you get put into an alternate class called \u2018Modified Tractors\u2019. They do this to avoid the tractors that have been modified always winning, they want a fair competition.   \n\nMost antique tractors when pulling needs about 14-15 pounds in their tires, however it could be more or less depending on the rules of the competition you are entering. There is also a drawbar rule, it is to be a minimum of two square inches in total steel at any point, as well must be rigid in all directions<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.peitruckandtractorpull.com/rules|title=PEI Truck & Tractor Pull Championships|website=www.peitruckandtractorpull.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>. The hitching device can be no more than 1 1/2 inch round stock (1 1/2 square), or less than 1 1/8 inch round stock (1 inch square), the hole has to be 3\"X3 3/4\"- inch diameter<ref name=\":2\" />. The drawbar on a tractor should be no shorter than 18 inches from the center of the rear axle to the point of the hitch<ref name=\":2\" />. All the weights that are on your tractor has to be non-moveable, they have to be safety secured to the tractor, bungee cords are not allowed to be used<ref name=\":2\" />. All drivers when pulling need to remain seated, if they get out of there seat they could face disqualification. However, all these rules can change depending on what competition you go too.    \n\n==History in Australia==\n\n[[File:Sheffield Tractor Pull.JPG|thumb|right|Tractor pull at [[Sheffield, Tasmania]]]]\nThe first Australian Tractor Pull was held at the Elmore Field Days (Victoria) in 1976. The following year saw Tractor Pulling begin in the Victorian rural town of [[Quambatook]].  It has developed over the years into a highly competitive and technical sport, where the difference between first and last place may be as small as one or two metres. Often the top tractors are separated by mere centimetres.\n \nThe Australian Tractor Pullers Association (ATPA) is a non-profit organisation that governs Tractor Pulling in Australia. Our events (Tractor Pulls) are held in conjunction with a promoter. This is often a local school, sporting, service or community club (for example; Apex, Rotary, Lions, Netball, Cricket, Football) who use the event as a fundraiser. Tractor Pulls are held in locations throughout Australia, predominantly in Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales. In the west the Western Australian Tractor Pullers Association (WATPA) runs events and is affiliated with the ATPA.\n \nThe ATPA is focused on actively promoting this spectacular sport and working with communities to not only establish a unique annual event, but more importantly to assist communities financially through the influx of spectators, sponsors and promotion.\n\nThe tractors are divided into classes and comply with either \"Limited\" or \"Open\" rules. The classes are Open Modified, Super Modified, Limited Modified, Open Mini Modified, Mini Modified, Pro Stock (diesel) and Two Wheel Drive Trucks. The distinction between classes is determined by the overall maximum weight, engine modifications, fuels and physical size.\n\nCompetition is open to both women and men, the only restriction being that competitors must at least hold a current Learner Driver\u2019s Permit. It sometimes comes down to members of the same family competing for the trophies.\n\nThe Junior Modified Pulling Association conducts an \"introductory\" class for 8- to 16-year-olds to develop driving, mechanical and competitive skills.  The Modified Mowers pull their own smaller version of the big sled.\n\n==Drag (Sled) pulling==\n[[File:Truck And Tractor Pull Sled 2011 Mackville Nationals.jpg|thumb|right|Sled]]\n[[File:Tractor Pull Full pull marker.jpg|thumb|left|Full Pull marker]]\nIn the early days two main techniques were used. Either a dead weight of fixed mass was dragged, or the step-on method was used, where people stood at fixed positions and stepped aboard as the drag passed.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Pulling 101 - NTPA Pull|url = http://www.ntpapull.com/pulling-101|website = www.ntpapull.com|accessdate = 2015-09-07}}</ref> Another rule which has now been dropped was that a speed limit should be observed because of injuries resulting from the increased speed at which they boarded. Today's tractors can achieve theoretical speeds over {{convert|125|mph|sigfig=1|disp=flip|abbr=on}}.\n\nToday's drags (sled) use a complex system of gears to move weights up to {{convert|65000|lb|disp=flip}}. Upon starting, all the weights are over the drag's (sled) rear axles, to give an effective weight of the drag plus zero. As the tractor travels the course, the weights are pushed forward off the drag's axles, pushing the front of the drag (sled) into the ground, synthetically creating a gain in weight until the tractor is no longer able to overcome the force of [[friction]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Most drags (sled) have grouser bars that act like teeth and dig into the soil to stop the sled.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Sled|url=http://lcata.com/facts.htm|publisher=Lake Country Antique Tractor Association|accessdate=27 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328055316/http://lcata.com/facts.htm|archivedate=28 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Engines ==\nApart from modified standard diesel tractors, a variety<ref>[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091222202001/http://www.kramp.com/info/index.php?id=2370 Four different tractors of a German team]</ref> of high power engines are used in tractor pulling, which started in the late 1970s.

In general, the operation of [[exchange symmetry|exchanging two identical particles]] may cause a global phase shift but cannot affect [[observables]].  Anyons are generally classified as ''abelian'' or ''non-abelian''.  Abelian anyons have been detected and play a major role in the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]].  Non-abelian anyons have not been definitively detected, although this is an active area of research.\n\n== Abelian anyons ==\nIn quantum mechanics, there can exist [[indistinguishable particles]]. Unlike in classical mechanics, where each particle is labeled by a distinct state vector <math>\\psi_i</math>, and different configurations of the set of <math>\\psi_i</math>s correspond to different many-body states, in quantum mechanics, the particles are identical, such that exchanging the states of two particles, i.e. <math>\\psi_i\\leftrightarrow\\psi_j</math>, does not lead to a measurably different many-body quantum state.\n\nFor example, a system with two indistinguishable particles, with particle 1 in state ''\u03c8''<sub>1</sub> and particle 2 in state ''\u03c8''<sub>2</sub>, has state (in [[Dirac notation]]) <math>\\left|\\psi_1\\psi_2\\right\\rangle</math>. Now suppose we exchange the states of the two particles, then the state of the system would be <math>\\left|\\psi_2\\psi_1\\right\\rangle</math>. These two states should not have a measurable difference, so they should be the same vector, up to a [[phase factor]]:\n\n:<math>\\left|\\psi_1\\psi_2\\right\\rangle = e^{i\\theta}\\left|\\psi_2\\psi_1\\right\\rangle.</math>\n\nIn space of [[three-dimensional space|three]] or more dimensions, [[elementary particles]] are either fermions or bosons, according to their [[Quantum statistics|statistical behaviour]]. Fermions obey [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]], while bosons obey [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]]. For bosons, the phase factor is <math>1</math>, and for fermions, it is <math>-1</math>. In particular, this is why fermions obey [[Pauli exclusion principle]]: If two fermions are in the same state, then we have\n\n:<math>\\left|\\psi\\psi\\right\\rangle = -\\left|\\psi\\psi\\right\\rangle.</math>\n\nThe state vector must be zero, which means it's not normalizable, thus unphysical.\n\nIn two-dimensional systems, however, [[quasiparticle]]s can be observed that obey statistics ranging continuously between Fermi\u2013Dirac and Bose\u2013Einstein statistics, as was first shown by [[Jon Magne Leinaas]] and [[Jan Myrheim]] of the [[University of Oslo]] in 1977.<ref>{{cite journal\n| title = On the theory of identical particles\n| journal = Il Nuovo Cimento B\n| volume = 37\n| issue = 1\n| pages = 1\u201323\n| last1 = Leinaas | first  = Jon Magne | authorlink1 = Jon Magne Leinaas\n| last2 = Myrheim | first2 = Jan       | authorlink2 = Jan Myrheim\n| url = http://www.ifi.unicamp.br/~cabrera/teaching/referencia.pdf\n| date = 11 January 1977\n| doi = 10.1007/BF02727953\n| bibcode = 1977NCimB..37....1L }}</ref> In the case of two particles this can be expressed as\n\n:<math>\\left|\\psi_1\\psi_2\\right\\rangle = e^{i\\theta}\\left|\\psi_2\\psi_1\\right\\rangle,</math>\n\nwhere <math>e^{i\\theta}</math> can be other values than just <math>-1</math> or <math>1</math>. It is important to note that there is a slight [[abuse of notation]] in this shorthand expression, as in reality this wave function can be and usually is multi-valued. This expression actually means that when particle 1 and particle 2 are interchanged in a process where each of them makes a counterclockwise half-revolution about the other, the two-particle system returns to its original quantum wave function except multiplied by the complex unit-norm phase factor {{nowrap|1=''e''<sup>''i\u03b8''</sup>}}. Conversely, a clockwise half-revolution results in multiplying the wave function by {{nowrap|1=''e''<sup>\u2212''i\u03b8''</sup>}}.

Unlike bosons and fermions, anyons have the peculiar property that when they are interchanged twice in the same way (e.g. if anyon 1 and anyon 2 were revolved counterclockwise by half revolution about each other to switch places, and then they were revolved counterclockwise by half revolution about each other again to go back to their original places), the wave function is not necessarily the same but rather generally multiplied by some complex phase (by {{nowrap|1=''e''<sup>2''i\u03b8''</sup>}} in this example).\n\nWe may also use {{nowrap|1=''\u03b8'' = 2''\u03c0&thinsp;s''}} with particle [[Spin (physics)#Spin and the Pauli exclusion principle|spin]] quantum number ''s'', with ''s'' being [[integer]] for bosons, [[half-integer]] for fermions, so that\n\n:<math>e^{i\\theta} = e^{2i \\pi s} = (-1)^{2s},</math> &nbsp; or &nbsp; <math>\\left|\\psi_1\\psi_2\\right\\rangle = (-1)^{2s}\\left|\\psi_2\\psi_1\\right\\rangle.</math>\n\nAt an edge, [[fractional quantum Hall effect]] anyons are confined to move in one space dimension. Mathematical models of one-dimensional anyons provide a base of the commutation relations shown above.\n\nIn a three-dimensional position space, the fermion and boson statistics operators (\u22121 and +1 respectively) are just 1-dimensional representations of the [[permutation group]] (''S<sub>N</sub>'' of ''N'' indistinguishable particles) acting on the space of wave functions. In the same way, in two-dimensional position space, the abelian anyonic statistics operators ({{nowrap|1=''e''<sup>''i\u03b8''</sup>}}) are just 1-dimensional representations of the [[Braid group#Representations|braid group]] (''B<sub>N</sub>'' of ''N'' indistinguishable particles) acting on the space of wave functions.

The mathematics developed by Leinaas and Myrheim proved to be useful to [[Bertrand Halperin]] at [[Harvard University]] in explaining aspects of it. Frank Wilczek, Dan Arovas, and [[Robert Schrieffer]] verified this statement in 1985 with an explicit calculation that predicted that particles existing in these systems are in fact anyons.\n\nIn 2005 a group of physicists at [[Stony Brook University]] constructed a quasiparticle [[interferometer]], detecting the patterns caused by interference of anyons, which were interpreted to suggest that anyons are real, rather than just a mathematical construct.<ref name=FractStat />  However, these experiments remain controversial and are not fully accepted by the community.\n\nWith developments in [[semiconductor]] technology meaning that the deposition of thin two-dimensional layers is possible \u2013 for example, in sheets of [[graphene]] \u2013 the long-term potential to use the properties of anyons in electronics is being explored.\n\n== Non-abelian anyons ==\n{{Unsolved|physics|Is [[topological order]] stable at non-zero [[temperature]]?}}\nIn 1988, [[J\u00fcrg Fr\u00f6hlich]] showed that it was valid under the [[spin\u2013statistics theorem]] for the particle exchange to be monoidal (non-abelian statistics).<ref>{{cite book |last=Fr\u00f6hlich |first=J\u00fcrg |chapter=Statistics of Fields, the Yang\u2013Baxter Equation, and the Theory of Knots and Links |title=Nonperturbative Quantum Field Theory |location=New York |publisher=Springer |year=1988 |pages=71\u2013100 |isbn=1-4612-8053-2 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4613-0729-7_4 }}</ref>  In particular, this can be achieved when the system exhibits some degeneracy, so that multiple distinct states of the system have the same configuration of particles.  Then an exchange of particles can contribute not just a phase change, but can send the system into a different state with the same particle configuration.  Particle exchange then corresponds to a linear transformation on this subspace of degenerate states.  When there is no degeneracy, this subspace is one-dimensional and so all such linear transformations commute (because they are just multiplications by a phase factor).  When there is degeneracy and this subspace has higher dimension, then these linear transformations need not commute (just as matrix multiplication does not).\n\n[[Greg Moore (physicist)|Gregory Moore]], [[Nicholas Read]], and [[Xiao-Gang Wen]] pointed out that non-Abelian statistics can be realized in the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]] (FQHE).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(91)90407-O |url=http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~gmoore/MooreReadNonabelions.pdf |title=Nonabelions in the fractional quantum hall effect |date=19 Aug 1991 |last1=Moore |first1=Gregory |authorlink1=Greg Moore (physicist) |last2=Read |first2=Nicholas |authorlink2=Nicholas Read |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=360 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=362\u2013396 |bibcode=1991NuPhB.360..362M }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Xiao-Gang |last=Wen |authorlink=Xiao-Gang Wen |title=Non-Abelian statistics in the fractional quantum Hall states |url=http://dao.mit.edu/~wen/pub/nab.pdf |journal=Phys.

The composite anyon is said to be the result of the [[fusion of anyons|fusion]] of its components.\n\nIf <math>N</math> identical abelian anyons each with individual statistics <math>\\alpha </math> (that is, the system picks up a phase <math> e^{i \\alpha} </math> when two individual anyons undergo adiabatic counterclockwise exchange) all fuse together, they together have statistics <math> N^2 \\alpha </math>. This can be seen by noting that upon counterclockwise rotation of two composite anyons about each other, there are <math> N^2 </math> pairs of individual anyons (one in the first composite anyon, one in the second composite anyon) that each contribute a phase <math> e^{i \\alpha} </math>. An analogous analysis applies to the fusion of non-identical abelian anyons. The statistics of the composite anyon is uniquely determined by the statistics of its components.\n\nNon-abelian anyons have more complicated fusion relations. As a rule, in a system with non-abelian anyons, there is a composite particle whose statistics label is not uniquely determined by the statistics labels of its components, but rather exists as a quantum superposition (this is completely analogous to how two fermions known to have spin 1/2 are together in quantum superposition of total spin 1 and 0). If the overall statistics of the fusion of all of several anyons is known, there is still ambiguity in the fusion of some subsets of those anyons, and each possibility is a unique quantum state. These multiple states provide a [[Hilbert space]] on which quantum computation can be done.<ref>{{cite journal |arxiv=0707.1889|author1=C. Nayak |author2=S.H. Simon |author3= A. Stern |author4=M.

For any <var>d</var>&nbsp;>&nbsp;2, the [[Lie group]]s [[orthogonal group|SO(<var>d</var>,1)]] (which generalizes the [[Lorentz group]]) and [[Poincar\u00e9 group|Poincar\u00e9(<var>d</var>,1)]] have '''Z'''<sub>2</sub> as their [[first homotopy group]]. Because the [[cyclic group]] '''Z'''<sub>2</sub> is composed of two elements, only two possibilities remain. (The details are more involved than that, but this is the crucial point.)\n\nThe situation changes in two dimensions. Here the first homotopy group of SO(2,1), and also Poincar\u00e9(2,1), is '''Z''' (infinite cyclic). This means that Spin(2,1) is not the [[universal covering group|universal cover]]: it is not [[simply connected]]. In detail, there are [[projective representation]]s of the [[generalized orthogonal group|special orthogonal group]] SO(2,1) which do not arise from [[linear representation]]s of SO(2,1), or of its [[Double covering group|double cover]], the [[spin group]] Spin(2,1). Anyons are evenly complementary representations of spin polarization by a charged particle.\n\nThis concept also applies to nonrelativistic systems. The relevant part here is that the spatial rotation group SO(2) has an infinite first homotopy group.\n\nThis fact is also related to the [[braid group]]s well known in [[knot theory]]. The relation can be understood when one considers the fact that in two dimensions the group of permutations of two particles is no longer the [[symmetric group]] ''S''<sub>2</sub> (with two elements) but rather the braid group ''B''<sub>2</sub> (with an infinite number of elements). The essential point is that one braid can wind around the other one, an operation that can be performed infinitely often, and clockwise as well as counterclockwise.\n\nA very different approach to the stability-decoherence problem in [[Quantum computer|quantum computing]] is to create a [[topological quantum computer]] with anyons, quasi-particles used as threads and relying on [[braid theory]] to form stable [[logic gate]]s.<ref>{{cite journal\n| title = Topological Quantum Computation\n| journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society\n| volume = 40\n| issue = 1\n| pages = 31\u201338\n| last = Freedman\n| first = Michael\n|author2=Alexei Kitaev |author3=Michael Larsen |author4=Zhenghan Wang\n | date = 20 October 2002\n| doi = 10.1090/S0273-0979-02-00964-3| arxiv = quant-ph/0101025}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Monroe |first= Don |url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/fundamentals/mg20026761.700-anyons-the-breakthrough-quantum-computing-needs.html |title=Anyons: The breakthrough quantum computing needs?

Anyons are generally classified as ''abelian'' or ''non-abelian''.  Abelian anyons have been detected and play a major role in the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]].  Non-abelian anyons have not been definitively detected, although this is an active area of research.\n\n== Abelian anyons ==\nIn quantum mechanics, there can exist [[indistinguishable particles]]. Unlike in classical mechanics, where each particle is labeled by a distinct state vector <math>\\psi_i</math>, and different configurations of the set of <math>\\psi_i</math>s correspond to different many-body states, in quantum mechanics, the particles are identical, such that exchanging the states of two particles, i.e. <math>\\psi_i\\leftrightarrow\\psi_j</math>, does not lead to a measurably different many-body quantum state.\n\nFor example, a system with two indistinguishable particles, with particle 1 in state ''\u03c8''<sub>1</sub> and particle 2 in state ''\u03c8''<sub>2</sub>, has state (in [[Dirac notation]]) <math>\\left|\\psi_1\\psi_2\\right\\rangle</math>. Now suppose we exchange the states of the two particles, then the state of the system would be <math>\\left|\\psi_2\\psi_1\\right\\rangle</math>. These two states should not have a measurable difference, so they should be the same vector, up to a [[phase factor]]:\n\n:<math>\\left|\\psi_1\\psi_2\\right\\rangle = e^{i\\theta}\\left|\\psi_2\\psi_1\\right\\rangle.</math>\n\nIn space of [[three-dimensional space|three]] or more dimensions, [[elementary particles]] are either fermions or bosons, according to their [[Quantum statistics|statistical behaviour]]. Fermions obey [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]], while bosons obey [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]]. For bosons, the phase factor is <math>1</math>, and for fermions, it is <math>-1</math>. In particular, this is why fermions obey [[Pauli exclusion principle]]: If two fermions are in the same state, then we have\n\n:<math>\\left|\\psi\\psi\\right\\rangle = -\\left|\\psi\\psi\\right\\rangle.</math>\n\nThe state vector must be zero, which means it's not normalizable, thus unphysical.\n\nIn two-dimensional systems, however, [[quasiparticle]]s can be observed that obey statistics ranging continuously between Fermi\u2013Dirac and Bose\u2013Einstein statistics, as was first shown by [[Jon Magne Leinaas]] and [[Jan Myrheim]] of the [[University of Oslo]] in 1977.<ref>{{cite journal\n| title = On the theory of identical particles\n| journal = Il Nuovo Cimento B\n| volume = 37\n| issue = 1\n| pages = 1\u201323\n| last1 = Leinaas | first  = Jon Magne | authorlink1 = Jon Magne Leinaas\n| last2 = Myrheim | first2 = Jan       | authorlink2 = Jan Myrheim\n| url = http://www.ifi.unicamp.br/~cabrera/teaching/referencia.pdf\n| date = 11 January 1977\n| doi = 10.1007/BF02727953\n| bibcode = 1977NCimB..37....1L }}</ref> In the case of two particles this can be expressed as\n\n:<math>\\left|\\psi_1\\psi_2\\right\\rangle = e^{i\\theta}\\left|\\psi_2\\psi_1\\right\\rangle,</math>\n\nwhere <math>e^{i\\theta}</math> can be other values than just <math>-1</math> or <math>1</math>. It is important to note that there is a slight [[abuse of notation]] in this shorthand expression, as in reality this wave function can be and usually is multi-valued. This expression actually means that when particle 1 and particle 2 are interchanged in a process where each of them makes a counterclockwise half-revolution about the other, the two-particle system returns to its original quantum wave function except multiplied by the complex unit-norm phase factor {{nowrap|1=''e''<sup>''i\u03b8''</sup>}}. Conversely, a clockwise half-revolution results in multiplying the wave function by {{nowrap|1=''e''<sup>\u2212''i\u03b8''</sup>}}. Such a theory obviously only makes sense in two-dimensions, where clockwise and counterclockwise are clearly defined directions.\n\nIn the case ''\u03b8''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''\u03c0'' we recover the Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics ({{nowrap|1=''e''<sup>''i\u03c0''</sup> = \u22121}}) and in the case {{nowrap|1=''\u03b8'' = 0}} (or {{nowrap|1=''\u03b8'' = 2''\u03c0''}}) the Bose\u2013Einstein statistics ({{nowrap|1=''e''<sup>2''\u03c0i''</sup> = 1}}). In between we have something different. [[Frank Wilczek]] coined the term \"anyon\"<ref>{{cite journal\n| title = Quantum Mechanics of Fractional-Spin Particles\n| journal = Physical Review Letters\n| volume = 49\n| issue = 14\n| pages = 957\u2013959\n| last = Wilczek | first = Frank | authorlink = Frank Wilczek\n| date = 4 October 1982\n| url = http://www.ifi.unicamp.br/~mtamash/f689_mecquant_i/prl49_957.pdf\n| doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.49.957\n| bibcode=1982PhRvL..49..957W}}</ref> to describe such particles, since they can have any phase when particles are interchanged. Unlike bosons and fermions, anyons have the peculiar property that when they are interchanged twice in the same way (e.g. if anyon 1 and anyon 2 were revolved counterclockwise by half revolution about each other to switch places, and then they were revolved counterclockwise by half revolution about each other again to go back to their original places), the wave function is not necessarily the same but rather generally multiplied by some complex phase (by {{nowrap|1=''e''<sup>2''i\u03b8''</sup>}} in this example).\n\nWe may also use {{nowrap|1=''\u03b8'' = 2''\u03c0&thinsp;s''}} with particle [[Spin (physics)#Spin and the Pauli exclusion principle|spin]] quantum number ''s'', with ''s'' being [[integer]] for bosons, [[half-integer]] for fermions, so that\n\n:<math>e^{i\\theta} = e^{2i \\pi s} = (-1)^{2s},</math> &nbsp; or &nbsp; <math>\\left|\\psi_1\\psi_2\\right\\rangle = (-1)^{2s}\\left|\\psi_2\\psi_1\\right\\rangle.</math>\n\nAt an edge, [[fractional quantum Hall effect]] anyons are confined to move in one space dimension. Mathematical models of one-dimensional anyons provide a base of the commutation relations shown above.\n\nIn a three-dimensional position space, the fermion and boson statistics operators (\u22121 and +1 respectively) are just 1-dimensional representations of the [[permutation group]] (''S<sub>N</sub>'' of ''N'' indistinguishable particles) acting on the space of wave functions. In the same way, in two-dimensional position space, the abelian anyonic statistics operators ({{nowrap|1=''e''<sup>''i\u03b8''</sup>}}) are just 1-dimensional representations of the [[Braid group#Representations|braid group]] (''B<sub>N</sub>'' of ''N'' indistinguishable particles) acting on the space of wave functions. Non-abelian anyonic statistics are higher-dimensional representations of the braid group. Anyonic statistics must not be confused with [[parastatistics]], which describes statistics of particles whose wavefunctions are higher-dimensional representations of the permutation group.<ref name=Khare2005>{{cite book |title=Fractional Statistics and Quantum Theory |last=Khare |first=Avinash |year=2005 |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=978-981-256-160-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rBi7zTpvjaAC&dq=Fractional+Statistics+and+Quantum+Theory |accessdate=May 1, 2011}}</ref>{{Rp|22}}\n\n=== Topological equivalence ===\nThe fact that the [[homotopy class]]es of paths (i.e. notion of [[equivalence principle|equivalence]] on [[braids]]) are relevant hints at a more subtle insight. It arises from the [[Feynman path integral]], in which all paths from an initial to final point in [[spacetime]] contribute with an appropriate [[phase factor]]. Recall that the [[Feynman path integral]] can be motivated from expanding the propagator using a method called time-slicing,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lancaster |first1=Tom |last2=Blundell |first2=Stephen J. |title=Quantum Field Theory for the Gifted Amateur |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-969932-1 |date=17 June 2014}}</ref> in which time is discretized.\n\nIn non-homotopic paths, one cannot get from any point at one time slice to any other point at the next time slice.

The mathematics developed by Leinaas and Myrheim proved to be useful to [[Bertrand Halperin]] at [[Harvard University]] in explaining aspects of it. Frank Wilczek, Dan Arovas, and [[Robert Schrieffer]] verified this statement in 1985 with an explicit calculation that predicted that particles existing in these systems are in fact anyons.\n\nIn 2005 a group of physicists at [[Stony Brook University]] constructed a quasiparticle [[interferometer]], detecting the patterns caused by interference of anyons, which were interpreted to suggest that anyons are real, rather than just a mathematical construct.<ref name=FractStat />  However, these experiments remain controversial and are not fully accepted by the community.\n\nWith developments in [[semiconductor]] technology meaning that the deposition of thin two-dimensional layers is possible \u2013 for example, in sheets of [[graphene]] \u2013 the long-term potential to use the properties of anyons in electronics is being explored.\n\n== Non-abelian anyons ==\n{{Unsolved|physics|Is [[topological order]] stable at non-zero [[temperature]]?}}\nIn 1988, [[J\u00fcrg Fr\u00f6hlich]] showed that it was valid under the [[spin\u2013statistics theorem]] for the particle exchange to be monoidal (non-abelian statistics).<ref>{{cite book |last=Fr\u00f6hlich |first=J\u00fcrg |chapter=Statistics of Fields, the Yang\u2013Baxter Equation, and the Theory of Knots and Links |title=Nonperturbative Quantum Field Theory |location=New York |publisher=Springer |year=1988 |pages=71\u2013100 |isbn=1-4612-8053-2 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4613-0729-7_4 }}</ref>  In particular, this can be achieved when the system exhibits some degeneracy, so that multiple distinct states of the system have the same configuration of particles.  Then an exchange of particles can contribute not just a phase change, but can send the system into a different state with the same particle configuration.  Particle exchange then corresponds to a linear transformation on this subspace of degenerate states.  When there is no degeneracy, this subspace is one-dimensional and so all such linear transformations commute (because they are just multiplications by a phase factor).  When there is degeneracy and this subspace has higher dimension, then these linear transformations need not commute (just as matrix multiplication does not).\n\n[[Greg Moore (physicist)|Gregory Moore]], [[Nicholas Read]], and [[Xiao-Gang Wen]] pointed out that non-Abelian statistics can be realized in the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]] (FQHE).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(91)90407-O |url=http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~gmoore/MooreReadNonabelions.pdf |title=Nonabelions in the fractional quantum hall effect |date=19 Aug 1991 |last1=Moore |first1=Gregory |authorlink1=Greg Moore (physicist) |last2=Read |first2=Nicholas |authorlink2=Nicholas Read |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=360 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=362\u2013396 |bibcode=1991NuPhB.360..362M }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Xiao-Gang |last=Wen |authorlink=Xiao-Gang Wen |title=Non-Abelian statistics in the fractional quantum Hall states |url=http://dao.mit.edu/~wen/pub/nab.pdf |journal=Phys.

The composite anyon is said to be the result of the [[fusion of anyons|fusion]] of its components.\n\nIf <math>N</math> identical abelian anyons each with individual statistics <math>\\alpha </math> (that is, the system picks up a phase <math> e^{i \\alpha} </math> when two individual anyons undergo adiabatic counterclockwise exchange) all fuse together, they together have statistics <math> N^2 \\alpha </math>. This can be seen by noting that upon counterclockwise rotation of two composite anyons about each other, there are <math> N^2 </math> pairs of individual anyons (one in the first composite anyon, one in the second composite anyon) that each contribute a phase <math> e^{i \\alpha} </math>. An analogous analysis applies to the fusion of non-identical abelian anyons. The statistics of the composite anyon is uniquely determined by the statistics of its components.\n\nNon-abelian anyons have more complicated fusion relations. As a rule, in a system with non-abelian anyons, there is a composite particle whose statistics label is not uniquely determined by the statistics labels of its components, but rather exists as a quantum superposition (this is completely analogous to how two fermions known to have spin 1/2 are together in quantum superposition of total spin 1 and 0). If the overall statistics of the fusion of all of several anyons is known, there is still ambiguity in the fusion of some subsets of those anyons, and each possibility is a unique quantum state. These multiple states provide a [[Hilbert space]] on which quantum computation can be done.<ref>{{cite journal |arxiv=0707.1889|author1=C. Nayak |author2=S.H. Simon |author3= A. Stern |author4=M.

For any <var>d</var>&nbsp;>&nbsp;2, the [[Lie group]]s [[orthogonal group|SO(<var>d</var>,1)]] (which generalizes the [[Lorentz group]]) and [[Poincar\u00e9 group|Poincar\u00e9(<var>d</var>,1)]] have '''Z'''<sub>2</sub> as their [[first homotopy group]]. Because the [[cyclic group]] '''Z'''<sub>2</sub> is composed of two elements, only two possibilities remain. (The details are more involved than that, but this is the crucial point.)\n\nThe situation changes in two dimensions. Here the first homotopy group of SO(2,1), and also Poincar\u00e9(2,1), is '''Z''' (infinite cyclic). This means that Spin(2,1) is not the [[universal covering group|universal cover]]: it is not [[simply connected]]. In detail, there are [[projective representation]]s of the [[generalized orthogonal group|special orthogonal group]] SO(2,1) which do not arise from [[linear representation]]s of SO(2,1), or of its [[Double covering group|double cover]], the [[spin group]] Spin(2,1). Anyons are evenly complementary representations of spin polarization by a charged particle.\n\nThis concept also applies to nonrelativistic systems. The relevant part here is that the spatial rotation group SO(2) has an infinite first homotopy group.\n\nThis fact is also related to the [[braid group]]s well known in [[knot theory]]. The relation can be understood when one considers the fact that in two dimensions the group of permutations of two particles is no longer the [[symmetric group]] ''S''<sub>2</sub> (with two elements) but rather the braid group ''B''<sub>2</sub> (with an infinite number of elements). The essential point is that one braid can wind around the other one, an operation that can be performed infinitely often, and clockwise as well as counterclockwise.\n\nA very different approach to the stability-decoherence problem in [[Quantum computer|quantum computing]] is to create a [[topological quantum computer]] with anyons, quasi-particles used as threads and relying on [[braid theory]] to form stable [[logic gate]]s.<ref>{{cite journal\n| title = Topological Quantum Computation\n| journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society\n| volume = 40\n| issue = 1\n| pages = 31\u201338\n| last = Freedman\n| first = Michael\n|author2=Alexei Kitaev |author3=Michael Larsen |author4=Zhenghan Wang\n | date = 20 October 2002\n| doi = 10.1090/S0273-0979-02-00964-3| arxiv = quant-ph/0101025}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Monroe |first= Don |url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/fundamentals/mg20026761.700-anyons-the-breakthrough-quantum-computing-needs.html |title=Anyons: The breakthrough quantum computing needs?

These four religious centres in [[Uttarakhand]] are represented by [[Badrinath]] (dedicated to Lord Vishnu), [[Kedarnath]](dedicated to Lord Shiva), [[Gangotri]] (the holy origin of river [[Ganga]])and [[Yamunotri]] (the holy origin of river [[Yamuna]]).\n\nThe Char Dham Yatra begins around the first to second week of May every year. These dates are announced in the national media. The base for the yatra is generally the [[Rishikesh]] town which has all the amenities available for pilgrims and tourists alike. Pilgrims and tourists generally book their journey through the local travel agents to all the four locations.\n\n===Badrinath===\n[[Badrinath]] is the abode of Lord Vishnu, who is called 'Badri Vishal', Badri the Big One. Legend has it that [[Badrinath]] was the abode of Lord Shiva, who used to reside there with his consort Parvati. Lord Vishnu happened to like the place and wished to reside there permanently, so He took the form of an infant and started crying inconsolably. Mother Parvati's heart melted and she picked up the infant Vishnu and started cradling Him. The crying of the infant, however, disturbed the meditation of Lord Shiva and unable to bear the crying He left for higher reaches of the Himalayas and made Kedarnath His home. Once Lord Shiva left, Mother Parvati too followed, which gave an opportunity to Lord Vishnu to take His original form and remain at Badrinath forever. The priests of Badrinath are from the southernmost part of [[India]], i.e. [[Kerala]]. This is according to the rules laid down by [[Adi Shankara]]. [[Badrinath]] remains out of bounds for pilgrims for 6 months a year, from October to May.\n\n===Kedarnath===\n[[Kedarnath]] is the abode of Lord Shiva. [[Kedarnath]] is one of the 12 Jyotirlingams of [[India]] and the only one in the [[Uttarakhand]]. While there is a motorable road to [[Badrinath]], [[Kedarnath]] could only be reached by foot. The 14&nbsp;km trek begins from [[Gaurikund]]. After the 2013 Himalayan floods, the trek currently is of more than 18&nbsp;km due to washing away of trekking paths.\n\n===Gangotri===\n[[Gangotri]] is the origin of the holy [[Ganga river|Ganga]]. [[Ganga River| Ganga]] is revered as a mother throughout [[India]]. According to the [[Hindu philosophy]], a place considered extremely holy if a river running through it flows in the northern direction. [[Gangotri]] is a place which is not only the origin of [[Ganga river| Ganga]] but also where [[Ganga river|Ganga]] flows in a northerly direction, hence the name [[Gangotri]]. The river Ganga flows out from the melting Gangotri glacier, which is at a distance of around 18&nbsp;km from the Gangotri town. Close to the temple is Bhagirath Shila, which according to the Hindu philosophy is the place where Bhagirath did penance for 5500 years to seek the blessings of Mother Ganga and requested her to descend to the Earth from her heavenly abode to cleanse the sins of his ancestors.\n\n===Yamunotri===\n[[Yamunotri]] is the origin of the holy river [[Yamuna]]. A temple dedicated to the holy river [[Yamuna]] is situated at the place. The actual origin of the river is the Yamunotri glacier further up into the Himalayas where very few pilgrims go due to the difficulty it entails. \n{{Panch Kedar}}\n{{kml}}\n\n==Panch Kedar==\n'''Panch Kedar''' ({{lang-sa|\u092a\u0902\u091a\u0915\u0947\u0926\u093e\u0930}}) refers to five [[Hindu temple]]s or holy places of the [[Shaivite]] sect dedicated to god [[Shiva]]. They are located in the [[Garhwal Division|Garhwal]] [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] region in [[Uttarakhand]], India.

The Pandavas defeated and killed their cousins \u2014 the [[Kauravas]] in the epic [[Kurukshetra war]]. They wished to atone for the sins of committing [[fratricide]] (''[[gotra]] [[hatya]]'') and [[Br\u0101hmanahatya]] (killing of [[Brahmin]]s \u2014 the priest class) during the war. Thus, they handed over the reins of their kingdom to their kin and left in search of the god [[Shiva]] and to seek his blessings. First, they went to the holy city of [[Varanasi]] (Kashi), believed to Shiva's favourite city and famous for its Shiva temple. But, Shiva wanted to avoid them as he was deeply incensed by the death and dishonesty at the Kurukshetra war and was, therefore, insensitive to Pandavas' prayers. Therefore, he assumed the form of a bull ([[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]]) and hid in the Garhwal region.\n\nNot finding Shiva in Varanasi, the Pandavas went to [[Garhwal Division|Garhwal]] [[Himalayas]]. [[Bhima]], the second of the five Pandava brothers, then standing astride two mountains started to look for Shiva. He saw a bull grazing near Guptakashi (\"hidden Kashi\" \u2014 the name derived from the hiding act of Shiva). Bhima immediately recognized the bull to be Shiva. Bhima caught hold of the bull by its tail and hind legs. But the bull-formed Shiva disappeared into the ground to later reappear in parts, with the hump raising in Kedarnath, the arms appearing in Tunganath, the nabhi (navel) and stomach surfacing in Madhyamaheshwar, the face showing up at Rudranath and the hair and the head appearing in Kalpeshwar. The Pandavas pleased with this reappearance in five different forms, built temples at the five places for venerating and worshipping Shiva. The Pandavas were thus freed from their sins. It is also believed that the fore portions of Shiva appeared at Pashupatinath, [[Kathmandu]] \u2014 the capital of [[Nepal]].<ref name=bisht/><ref name=travel>{{Cite web |url=http://traveluttarakhand.com/panchkedar.html#madhyamaheshwar#madhyamaheshwar |title= Panch Kedar Yatra |accessdate=5 July 2009}}</ref><ref name=ecology>{{Cite book |author= Kapoor.

On the way at Rudra Prayag, he met several beautiful damsels called [[Raga#R\u0101ga-R\u0101gini system|ragini]]s (musical notes) who were disfigured and the reason for such disfigurement was squarely attributed to Narada playing his Veena. Hearing this, Narada felt humbled and surrendered before Shiva and decided to devote himself to learning music as disciple of Shiva.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nAccording to another legend, the consort of Shiva - [[Dakshayani|Sati]] was reborn as [[Parvati]] as the daughter of Himalaya, after she self-immolated herself in protest of the insult of Shiva.

These four religious centres in [[Uttarakhand]] are represented by [[Badrinath]] (dedicated to Lord Vishnu), [[Kedarnath]](dedicated to Lord Shiva), [[Gangotri]] (the holy origin of river [[Ganga]])and [[Yamunotri]] (the holy origin of river [[Yamuna]]).\n\nThe Char Dham Yatra begins around the first to second week of May every year. These dates are announced in the national media. The base for the yatra is generally the [[Rishikesh]] town which has all the amenities available for pilgrims and tourists alike. Pilgrims and tourists generally book their journey through the local travel agents to all the four locations.\n\n===Badrinath===\n[[Badrinath]] is the abode of Lord Vishnu, who is called 'Badri Vishal', Badri the Big One. Legend has it that [[Badrinath]] was the abode of Lord Shiva, who used to reside there with his consort Parvati. Lord Vishnu happened to like the place and wished to reside there permanently, so He took the form of an infant and started crying inconsolably. Mother Parvati's heart melted and she picked up the infant Vishnu and started cradling Him. The crying of the infant, however, disturbed the meditation of Lord Shiva and unable to bear the crying He left for higher reaches of the Himalayas and made Kedarnath His home. Once Lord Shiva left, Mother Parvati too followed, which gave an opportunity to Lord Vishnu to take His original form and remain at Badrinath forever. The priests of Badrinath are from the southernmost part of [[India]], i.e. [[Kerala]]. This is according to the rules laid down by [[Adi Shankara]]. [[Badrinath]] remains out of bounds for pilgrims for 6 months a year, from October to May.\n\n===Kedarnath===\n[[Kedarnath]] is the abode of Lord Shiva. [[Kedarnath]] is one of the 12 Jyotirlingams of [[India]] and the only one in the [[Uttarakhand]]. While there is a motorable road to [[Badrinath]], [[Kedarnath]] could only be reached by foot. The 14&nbsp;km trek begins from [[Gaurikund]]. After the 2013 Himalayan floods, the trek currently is of more than 18&nbsp;km due to washing away of trekking paths.\n\n===Gangotri===\n[[Gangotri]] is the origin of the holy [[Ganga river|Ganga]]. [[Ganga River| Ganga]] is revered as a mother throughout [[India]]. According to the [[Hindu philosophy]], a place considered extremely holy if a river running through it flows in the northern direction. [[Gangotri]] is a place which is not only the origin of [[Ganga river| Ganga]] but also where [[Ganga river|Ganga]] flows in a northerly direction, hence the name [[Gangotri]]. The river Ganga flows out from the melting Gangotri glacier, which is at a distance of around 18&nbsp;km from the Gangotri town. Close to the temple is Bhagirath Shila, which according to the Hindu philosophy is the place where Bhagirath did penance for 5500 years to seek the blessings of Mother Ganga and requested her to descend to the Earth from her heavenly abode to cleanse the sins of his ancestors.\n\n===Yamunotri===\n[[Yamunotri]] is the origin of the holy river [[Yamuna]]. A temple dedicated to the holy river [[Yamuna]] is situated at the place. The actual origin of the river is the Yamunotri glacier further up into the Himalayas where very few pilgrims go due to the difficulty it entails. \n{{Panch Kedar}}\n{{kml}}\n\n==Panch Kedar==\n'''Panch Kedar''' ({{lang-sa|\u092a\u0902\u091a\u0915\u0947\u0926\u093e\u0930}}) refers to five [[Hindu temple]]s or holy places of the [[Shaivite]] sect dedicated to god [[Shiva]].

The Pandavas defeated and killed their cousins \u2014 the [[Kauravas]] in the epic [[Kurukshetra war]]. They wished to atone for the sins of committing [[fratricide]] (''[[gotra]] [[hatya]]'') and [[Br\u0101hmanahatya]] (killing of [[Brahmin]]s \u2014 the priest class) during the war. Thus, they handed over the reins of their kingdom to their kin and left in search of the god [[Shiva]] and to seek his blessings. First, they went to the holy city of [[Varanasi]] (Kashi), believed to Shiva's favourite city and famous for its Shiva temple. But, Shiva wanted to avoid them as he was deeply incensed by the death and dishonesty at the Kurukshetra war and was, therefore, insensitive to Pandavas' prayers. Therefore, he assumed the form of a bull ([[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]]) and hid in the Garhwal region.\n\nNot finding Shiva in Varanasi, the Pandavas went to [[Garhwal Division|Garhwal]] [[Himalayas]]. [[Bhima]], the second of the five Pandava brothers, then standing astride two mountains started to look for Shiva. He saw a bull grazing near Guptakashi (\"hidden Kashi\" \u2014 the name derived from the hiding act of Shiva). Bhima immediately recognized the bull to be Shiva. Bhima caught hold of the bull by its tail and hind legs. But the bull-formed Shiva disappeared into the ground to later reappear in parts, with the hump raising in Kedarnath, the arms appearing in Tunganath, the nabhi (navel) and stomach surfacing in Madhyamaheshwar, the face showing up at Rudranath and the hair and the head appearing in Kalpeshwar. The Pandavas pleased with this reappearance in five different forms, built temples at the five places for venerating and worshipping Shiva. The Pandavas were thus freed from their sins. It is also believed that the fore portions of Shiva appeared at Pashupatinath, [[Kathmandu]] \u2014 the capital of [[Nepal]].<ref name=bisht/><ref name=travel>{{Cite web |url=http://traveluttarakhand.com/panchkedar.html#madhyamaheshwar#madhyamaheshwar |title= Panch Kedar Yatra |accessdate=5 July 2009}}</ref><ref name=ecology>{{Cite book |author= Kapoor.

In spite of Himalaya's protests, Parvati performed rigorous penance to get the boon of becoming Shiva\u2019s wife in the new birth too.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nTemples dedicated to Rudranath (Shiva) and goddess [[Chamunda]] are located here.\n\n===Dev Prayag===\nDev Prayag {{nowrap|({{coord|30.1453|78.5977|type:landmark_region:IN|display=inline|format=dms|name=Dev Prayag}})}} is the confluence of the two holy rivers, the Bhagirathi - the chief stream of the Ganges and the Alaknanda. It is the first Prayag on the way to Badrinath. Beyond this confluence, the river is known as Ganges. The holiness of this place is considered equal to the famous [[Triveni sangam]] confluence at [[Allahabad]] where the Ganges, Yamuna and [[Saraswati river|Saraswati]] rivers merge.<ref name=vikas/>\n\nThe confluence of the Bhagirathi, which flows in rapids with strong currents meets a much calmer river in the Alaknanda and this has been vividly described by the British captain Raper as:<ref name=Foster>{{Cite book |last=Foster |first=Theodore |title=The London quarterly review, 1817 |work=Devprayag |page=409 |accessdate=9 August 2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XPIRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA404&dq=Haridwar&lr=&ei=h0h-Svv3BpqUkAT2jpSPCg#v=onepage&q=Haridwar&f=false |publisher=Theodore Foster |quote=digitized by New York Public Library |date=28 November 2007}}</ref>\n<blockquote>The contrast between the two rivers joining here is striking. The Bhaghirathi runs down a steep declivity with rapid force, roaring and foaming flowing over large fragments placed in its bed, while the placid, Alakananda, flowing, with a smooth, unruffled surface, gently winds round the point till,  meeting with her turbulent consort, she is forcibly hurried down, and unites her clamours with the blustering current.</blockquote>\n\n==Other attractions==\n\n===Rishikesh===\n[[File:Rishikesh view across bridge.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Rishikesh]] view and 13 stories Shiva temple across [[Lakshman Jhula]] bridge over the [[Ganges]].]]\n[[Rishikesh]] has been a magnet for spiritual seekers since the late 60's when [[The Beatles]] rocked up [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]'s ashram. Known as the \u2018Yoga Capital of the World\u2019 because of the large number of ashrams teaching meditation and yoga. The northern part of the main town is the hotspot for all the action where the Ganges forested hills form a conducive environment for all the meditation. The evening aarti also draws a lot of crowd.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/uttarakhand-uttaranchal/rishikesh |title=Rishikesh Travel Information and Travel Guide - India |publisher=Lonely Planet |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://uttarakhandtourism.gov.in/rishikesh.php |title=Rishikesh UTDB - India |publisher=Mussoorie Uttarakhand Tourism Development Board |accessdate=29 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Haridwar===\nHaridwar is an important city in the religious architecture of the country. The large number of people gathering on the bathing ghats on the holy Ganges river give the place a chaotic feel. There are a number of Hindu temples, ashrams and dharamshalas (pilgrims\u2019 rest houses) in the city. The city also serves as the entry point to the nearby [[Rajaji National Park]].<ref name=\"lonelyplanet1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/uttarakhand-uttaranchal/haridwar |title=Haridwar Travel Information and Travel Guide - India |publisher=Lonely Planet |accessdate=25 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://uttarakhandtourism.gov.in/haridwar.php |title=Mussoorie UTDB - India |publisher=Haridwar - Uttarakhand Tourism Development Board |accessdate=29 October 2012}}</ref>\n[[File:Har ki pauri panoramic view1.jpg|thumb|800px|center|<center>Panoramic view of [[Har ki Pauri]], Haridwar.</center>]]\n\n==Fairs and festivals==\n[[File:Third Shahi Snan in Hari Ki Pauri.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Pilgrims gather for the third ''Shahi Snan'' (\"royal bath\") at [[Har ki Pauri]] in [[Haridwar, Uttarakhand]] on 14 April 2010 during [[Haridwar Kumbh Mela]].]]\n[[Haridwar Kumbh Mela]] (fair) is a major tourist attraction to the state.
