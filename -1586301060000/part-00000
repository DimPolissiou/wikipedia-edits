The novel opens with a comic survey of Gunnar's [[family tree]], as his mother relates the tales of his family history to him and his sisters.  Gunnar in turn regales his classmates with the tales of his ancestors, one of whom Gunnar claims dodged the bullet that eventually killed [[Crispus Attucks]] in the [[Boston Massacre]]. Gunnar is a young boy growing up in affluent, predominantly white [[Santa Monica]], [[California]] with his mother and sisters.  His absent father is a sketch artist for the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] and rarely sees his children.  Gunnar's friends are white, and he spends his free time making enough mischief to gain him mild admonishments from the Santa Monica Shore Patrol. This was found to be true because Kenneth Rogers made it so.\n\nWhen Gunnar and his sisters tell their mother they do not want to attend an all-black summer camp because the children there \"are different from us,\" Ms. Kaufman immediately packs up a [[U-Haul]] and relocates her family to the West [[Los Angeles]] neighborhood of Hillside, a predominantly black community surrounded by a concrete wall that Gunnar describes as the [[ghetto]] (37).  In Hillside, the Kaufman children encounter an altogether different lifestyle than the one they were accustomed to in Santa Monica.  Gunnar learns \"the hard way that social norms in Santa Monica were unforgivable breaches of proper Hillside etiquette, and soon after arriving is beaten up by one of the area's local [[gang]]s, the \"Gun Totin' Hooligans\" (52).\n\nEnrolling in the local junior high, Gunnar is offered protection by an administrator who fears that Gunnar's unfamiliarity with Hillside social norms will make him an easy target for harassment.  However, Gunnar soon strikes up a friendship with Nicholas Scoby when he is paired with the \"thuggish boy\" in a reading of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'' (66).  Scoby is a prodigious [[basketball]] player, with a remarkable ability to make, without exception, every basket.  Soon after meeting Scoby, Gunnar stuns the local children when he unintentionally exhibits his own, heretofore unknown talent for basketball, dunking the ball into the basket in a pickup game.  His talent gains him respect within the Hillside community of youths.  Ironically, this unusual talent causes him to stick out enables him to fit into the social scene.  Around this time, Gunnar writes his first poem, \"Negro Misappropriation of Greek Mythology or, I know Niggers That'll Kick Hercules's Ass\" and spray paints the lines across the concrete wall surrounding Hillside.  Later, instructed by Scoby, Gunnar changes his hairstyle and attire in an effort to further conform to Hillside society.\n\nAs the years pass, Gunnar becomes incredibly popular, both for his talent on the basketball court and for his emerging poetic prowess.  However, he remains somewhat of an outcast in his clear lack of dancing talent and his unease with women.  His friends, Scoby and feared gang-member and assumed murderer Psycho Loco, dub Gunnar's awkward antics on the dance floor \"The White Boy Shuffle.\"  Because of Gunnar's apparent inability to talk to women, Psycho Loco secretly takes it upon himself to order Gunnar a [[mail order bride]] from [[Japan]], using a service called \"Hot Mamma-Sans of the Orient.\"  Throughout high school, Gunnar continues to write poetry, much of which, we later learn, is published in magazines.\n\nDuring his sixteenth summer, Gunnar aids in his friends' stealing a department store safe during the turmoil of the [[1992 Los Angeles Riots]].  We learn that Psycho Loco has planned to steal the safe for nine years in retribution for the department store's having moved a race-car set the young Psycho intended to steal on the day he was to steal it.  As Gunnar and his friends attempt to load the safe into a car, Gunnar's father and other policemen arrive.  Gunnar's father beats him with a [[Baton (law enforcement)|nightstick]], and Gunnar is hospitalized.  When he is released from the hospital, he learns that his friends have been unable to open the safe.  Gunnar turns the safe over, finding the combination on the bottom, and opens it.  Gunnar refuses to take any of the money, gold, and precious stones inside.  In the last two weeks of summer, Gunnar attends a program for the top 100 high school basketball talents in the country, of which Gunnar is number 100.  From camp, he sends his friends and family several [[e-mails]], which are documented in the novel.  From these e-mails, we learn that both of Gunnar's sisters are [[pregnant]] and have moved in with their father.  We also learn that Gunnar, despite his basketball talent, is not incredibly interested in the game itself.  He is constantly frustrated by his roommates' insistence on constantly talking about the game.  Gunnar notes that his roommates even use basketball terms to talk about women.\n\nIn return for his father not pressing charges against him and his friends for the safe incident, Gunnar agrees to attend an elite public high school in the [[San Fernando Valley]].  Gunnar travels an hour and a half to and from school on a bus.  His return to a predominantly white atmosphere is an easy one, and Gunnar notes that he \"meshed well\" (153).  However, he disdains the arrogance of several of the rich, white boys with whom his mother insists he spend time.\n\nIn his senior year, Gunnar begins receiving letters from the [[armed forces]] academies, [[Harvard University]], and [[Boston University]].  He visits a wealthy, African American Harvard graduate in his large home, which overlooks Hillside, realizing that years earlier he and his Hooligan friends had stolen a security sign out of the front lawn and destroyed the man's [[RV]].  Gunnar is disgusted by the man's superior attitude towards the residents of Hillside and decides he will never attend Harvard.  When a recruiter from BU arrives at his house, Gunnar decides to attend BU instead.\n\nBefore Gunnar leaves for college, it is revealed that Psycho Loco has indeed ordered Gunnar a wife from Japan when she arrives by [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] on Gunnar's 18th [[birthday]].  Yoshiko Katsu speaks little English but is an immediate hit with Gunnar's mother.  For their [[honeymoon]], Gunnar and Yoshiko drive to an [[amusement park]], listening to the radio and attempting to bridge the gap between their two mother tongues.\n\nMoving to [[Boston]], Gunnar attends one class at BU: Creative Writing 104.  When he tells the class his name, he is overwhelmed by a chorus of accolades as the students in the class recite his now famous poetry back to him and barrage him with questions.  Uncomfortable with the attention, Gunnar runs from the room, tearing off his clothes and walking home to his apartment.  At the insistence of his professor, who has followed him along with the members of the class, Gunnar agrees to publish a collection of his poetry.  The collection will become his book, ''Watermelanin''.\n\nIn Boston, Gunnar begins to face a degree of prejudice from other Black people for his marriage to the Japanese Yoshiko.  At the insistence of Scoby, who is attending BU, Gunnar attends several meetings of student activist clubs such as the citywide black student union and SWAPO, or the Whities Against Political Obsequeiousness, of which he is the only black member.  Waking simultaneously one night from dreams, Gunnar and Yoshiko realize that the latter is pregnant.  Gunnar begins traveling on a basketball team with Scoby.  He becomes increasingly depressed, and his only consolation are the boxes of Japanese literature sent to him on the road from Yoshiko.  In return, Gunnar writes her letters.  In these letters, he notes that Scoby \"is going insane\" (192).\n\nAfter basketball season ends, Gunnar\u2014now an even greater celebrity\u2014is asked by his publisher to speak at a rally protesting BU's decision to confer an honorary degree upon a corrupt African statesman.  Initially unsure of what to say to the crowd, Gunnar eventually tells the crowd that \"What we need is some new leaders.  Leaders who won't apostatize like cowards.  Some niggers who are ready to die!\" (200).  The frenzied crowd chants \"You! You! You!\" and Gunnar's place as \"Negro Demagogue\" is solidified.  From his speech, the media assumes that Gunnar is an advocate of freedom through suicide, and though Gunnar makes it clear that he means only his own suicide, many across America begin killing themselves and sending their \"death poems\" to Gunnar.  When asked when he plans to commit suicide, Gunnar replies \"When I'm good and goddamn ready\" (202).\n\nOne night, on the beach, a deeply unhappy and depressed Scoby asks Gunnar what the highest building in Boston is before leaving the beach.  The next morning Gunnar learns that Scoby has jumped from the roof of the BU law school, killing himself.  On the roof, Gunnar finds his friend's suicide note, containing his own death poem.\n\nGunnar and Yoshiko resolve to return to Hillside, but Gunnar is forced into hiding by an outstanding warrant for his arrest by the LAPD.  One night, on the beach with Psycho Loco and Yoshiko, Gunnar walks out into the ocean, realizes he could die if he swam out farther, and gives himself to the currents.  Hit with thoughts of his unborn child, he snaps out of a meditative state underwater and swims back to shore.  Gunnar and Yoshiko check into a motel, where the spend the remainder of the novel ostensibly hiding from the LAPD, occupying their time by having debates and reading death poems from Gunnar's fans.  However, one night, Gunnar walks to [[7-Eleven]] and is caught in a police helicopter's search light.  The light follows him home.  He and Yoshiko begin taking nighttime walks through Hillside, their way constantly lit by the helicopter.  Eventually, they are joined by other members of the community on their walks.\n\nWith Gunnar's mother acting as [[midwife]], Yoshiko gives birth to a girl, Naomi Katsu Kaufman, in a small pool in the local park.  The birth is attended by a large crowd and is guarded by the members of the Gun Totin' Hooligans.  As always, the LAPD helicopter hovers overhead.  It drops a box of cigars attached to a parachute when Yoshiko gives birth.  In what appears to be Gunnar's father's handwriting, a note is attached that reads, \"Congratulations from the Los Angeles Police Department.  Maybe this one will grow up with a respect for authority\" (219).\n\nAs the novel comes to a close, Gunnar begins holding weekly, outdoor open mics, reading his poetry to great crowds.  At one gathering, on the two-year anniversary of Scoby's suicide, Gunnar shocks the crowd by chopping off the smallest finger on his right hand with a kitchen knife.  His sacrifice \"cement[s] his status as savior of the blacks\" (223).  Elevating Gunnar to the status of cult figure, \"spiteful black folks\" travel in droves to Hillside, prompting the government to threaten the community with an ultimatum: \"rejoin the rest of America or celebrate Kwanza in hell\" (224).  Hillside residents respond by painting the roofs of the community with white targets.  The novel ends with Gunnar, still living in the [[motel]] with Yoshiko and Naomi, beginning to tell his daughter the same stories of his family tree told to him in his youth by his mother.  The first such tale is that of Gunnar's father.  The novel ends with his death poem, left in his LAPD locker before he kills himself by swallowing his own [[gun]].\n\n==Genre==\n''The White Boy Shuffle'' is a fictional satirical piece framed around the Black messiah, Gunnar Kaufman. The novel falls under the new genres of [[Trey Ellis|New Black Aesthetic]] and [[Mark Anthony Neal|Post Soul Aesthetic]] which are expanding the cultural representations of Blackness and giving legitimacy to new many possibilities of Black identity.\n\n==Location==\nSanta Monica, the place where Gunnar and his family resided at the start of the novel, was known as a predominantly white neighborhood. It was a community that fell over to gentrification, especially in the late 1990s/early 2000s. Santa Monica was a place for leisure as a home to a number of retail, dining and entertainment venues and a large beach, where Gunnar spent a lot of time with friends. It is a large tourist location, boasting its fun and sunny location.<ref>{{cite web |title=Santa Monica History Facts and Timeline |url=http://www.world-guides.com/north-america/usa/california/santa-monica/santa_monica_history.html |website=World Guides}}</ref>\n\nHillside, known in the novel as the ghetto, was where a majority of African American, Latinx and Asian populations lived. The community is well known for all the wrong reasons. Their criminal gangs, high crime rate and lower-class economic bracket lend themselves to the bad reputation Hillside has. Gunnar's mother moves the Kaufman family to Hillside after her children claim that they are not like other black kids. They pack up their bags and immediately move to get a more black experience, as the mother believes.\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Identity===\nGunnar is a [[cultural mulatto]] that frequently shifts between the white world and the Black world. Gunnar, like many of the cultural mulattos, is incapable of fitting in perfectly in either world. In the white world, he is very conscious of his blackness. And in the black world he is in constant unease trying to meet the expectations that are placed on him as messiah, basketball player, and representative. His mother relocates him and sisters so they can experience \u201ca bitter taste of her vaunted \u2018traditional black experience\u2019.\u201d He describes this shift living the black lifestyle like \u201cbeing in a never-ending log-rolling contest\u201d.\n\nIn the beginning of the book, Beatty presents the genealogy of the Kaufman family. The Kaufman family tree consists of many sellouts to Blackness including: Swen Kaufman, who ran back into slavery, Franz von, the loving seeing eye human to his slavemaster, and Gunnar's father, Rolf Kaufman, a criminal sketch artist that has passively accepted racism and mistreatment all his life. The genealogy places Gunnar as the next traitor in a long line of disappointment, yet he becomes the Messiah of the Black community. It is debatable whether he fits within his genealogy or breaks the tradition and becomes a true leader of the Black community, because he incites a mass suicide of the Black community and is apathetic towards his role as leader.\n\n===Sexuality===\n* '''Gunnar''' is a nerd, an avid reader and very intelligent and self-aware. He plays two roles, poet and basketball player. His intellectualism is revered because he uses his poetry for the Black community as the Gun Totin\u2019 Hooligans\u2019 resident poet. He gains further acceptance as a talented basketball player. The role as a basketball player validates his masculinity, although he cannot approach females and he has no aggressive or violent tendencies.\n* '''Psycho loco''' is Hillside's resident gang leader of the Gun Totin\u2019 Hooligans. They are aware of their performance of masculinity, and manipulate this expectation of them by cross-dressing for a surprise attack on a competing gang.\n\n==Analysis==\nAfrican American studies scholar [[Mark Anthony Neal]] has suggested that Beatty's protagonist, Gunnar Kaufman, is \"a reference to the Swedish [[ethnographer]] [[Gunnar Myrdal]], who chronicled black life in ''[[An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy]]''.<ref>{{Citation\n|last=Neal\n|first=Mark A.\n|title=Soul Babies: Black Popular Culture and the Post-Soul Aesthetic\n|publisher=Routledge\n|year=2002\n|isbn=0-415-92658-0\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sK5OTH1gRKAC\n|pages=134\u2013135}}</ref>\n\nPaul Beatty\u2019s protagonist Gunnar Kaufman embodies the progression that Martin Luther King Jr. envisioned with the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. He is an African American male who was raised in predominantly Caucasian environment without profound discrimination. Although the white community accepts him, he struggles to be accepting of his native African American community. Even after his mother moves his family to Hillside, a notorious California ghetto, he initially does not connect to the \u201cghetto\u201d lifestyle. He has notions of what life as an African American should be like, but he has yet to live it. Gunnar is a chameleon that slowly but surely fits into almost every environment he is placed in. When Gunnar moves from the predominant white Hillside to a predominantly Black neighborhood he slowly changes \"colors\" and begins to represent everything that is considered to be \"Black.\" However, it could just be Gunnar's environment that is shaping his personality and not his desire to conform. Gunnar did desire to be accepted in this new community but even if he did not desire to be accepted he was bound to retain some of the attributes of the people that were in his surroundings. Gunnar\u2019s friendship with these Black characters can be interpreted as the white person saying these are my \u201ccool Black friends.\u201d  Gunnar is no longer the \u201ccool Black\u201d friend he is the \u201cwhite person\u201d saying these are my \u201ccool Black friends.\u201d<ref>Beatty, Paul (1996), The White Boy Shuffle, Houghton Mifflin, {{ISBN|0-395-74280-3}}</ref> Through the help of Scoby and Psycho Loco, he begins to fit into the black aesthetic, but superficial conforming does not change his innate personality. When his father forces him to return to a predominantly white school, he naturally reverts to his true self, one that does not see skin color as a barrier.\n\nBeatty, writing [[Post Civil Rights Era African-American history|Post-Civil Rights Movement]] and during the [[Black Arts Movement]], creates a character that transcends racial barriers, as many African Americans at that time wished to do. He along with other activists redefined what it meant to be black. Beatty created a character that fit into a white community as equally well as a black community; he also marries and impregnates a Japanese woman. From Gunnar's encounter with the Harvard graduate, he learns that he is not interested in losing his true African American self to become a pretentious imposter. The African American community appoints him to the status of Negro Demagogue. They overlook the Caucasian environment that saturates the majority of his upbringing and his Japanese wife because at the end of the day, Gunnar is simply an African American male. This book proves that being raised in a ghetto or only having African American friends are not the only qualification that one must fill to be considered \u201cBlack.\u201d Anyone can represent the African American community, including well-spoken, well-educated black men and women. Paul Beatty's novel puts the foot in the door for a new Black being. It is a [http://wordsmith-lesson.blogspot.com/2010/10/new-black-aesthetic-conversation-with.html New Black Aesthetic].\n\n===Black exceptionality===\nThe theme of black exceptionality is explored in the characters of Gunnar and Scoby. Both Gunnar and Scoby represent [[The Talented Tenth|\"the talented tenth\"]], in that they escape Hillside and go on to higher education and promising futures. However, their successes are perceived differently by the white community. Scoby, the perfect Basketball player who is incapable of missing a basketball shot, is vilified and perceived as the pagan African demon with mystical powers. In contrast, Gunnar, a great player but not as good as Scoby, becomes \u201cwhite society\u2019s mercenary\u201d. He is accepted, tolerated, and claimed by whiteness, because of his lack of apparent blackness. Because Gunnar has never fulfilled the stereotypical \"black\" role, whites view him as less of a deviance from the hegemonic ideals. This is a larger commentary on where Blacks are allowed to be in the social hierarchy, and the limitations placed on their successes. Gunnar comments of the white community's treatment of Scoby saying \u201cthey would be a lot better off if they simply called Scoby a god and left it at that, it's no way they\u2019ll proclaim a skinny black man God\u201d.\n\nThis theme is also explored with regard to Gunnar's participation in both basketball and poetry. While Gunnar exceeds at both hobbies, he is especially invested in poetry. For him, playing basketball is not as inherently interesting as it is simply an activity that makes him popular, but poetry intrigued him before he really knew how to write it. In the book, Gunnar narrates, \"It occurred to me that maybe poems are like colds. Maybe I would feel a poem coming on. My chest would grow heavier, my eyes watery; my body temperature would fluctuate, and a ringing in my ears would herald the coming of a timeless verse (79).\" Through Gunnar's shifting interests, Beatty comments on the intersection between exceptionality and passion. While Gunnar is expected to be good at basketball to be a \"real\" black male, the satisfaction it brings him is only superficial and dependent on the gaze of others. Poetry, on the other hand, is a skill that Gunnar builds on his own and eventually becomes so famous that his magnum opus, ''Watermelanin'', becomes so famous that he unintentionally becomes a \"Leader of the Black Community\" (1). As a result, Gunnar's blackness is ironically validated and treated as exceptional on a large scale through his \"nerdy\" pursuit of poetry instead of through basketball, like he had originally imagined.\n\n===Latinidad===\n\nBased out of Los Angeles, Gunnar's stay in Hillside happens in the context of a predominantly Black but also Latino population. We are first introduced to the Latinos in Gunnar's proximity when he walks the halls of his new school and notices the change over time of the school's demographics. By the 1960s, in the context of the [[Civil Rights]] Movements and other subsequent community movements for [[self-determination]], \u201cThe faces of these graduating ninth-graders are dark and overwhelmingly Latino and black.\u201d <ref>Beatty, Paul (1996), The White Boy Shuffle, p. 60</ref> Gunnar walks down the hall and sees writing in Spanish\u2014\u201cKathleen y Flaco para siempre con alma\u201d sketched on the wall. (62) Later, his schools hosts the, \u201cYoung Black and Latino Men: Endangered Species\u2019 assembly.\u201d <ref>Beatty, Paul (1996), The White Boy Shuffle, p. 112</ref> Notably, the text also makes various references to Latino and [[Chicano]] communities in the LA area.\n\nBeatty is both playful and intentional about how he represents or pokes fun at Latinidad. For instance, he discusses the \u201cSan Borrachos Mountains\u201d (Holy Drunk Mts) that do not officially exist. Later, in his Spanish class, he puts Mexican [[Octavio Paz]] and California Chicano Frost in the same sentence, saying \u201cYo voy a escribir poemas como Octavio Paz y [[Kid Frost]]\u2026 Octavio Paz ere un poeta gordiflon y activista de Mexico\u2026 [Kid Frost] es un poetastro hip-hop de la viaja guardia, de la vieja escuela quien vivio en Pomona\u2026 de la old school.\u201d <ref>Beatty, Paul (1996), The White Boy Shuffle, p. 76</ref> To continue the literary allusions, Gunnar goes on to shut down the [[fetishization]] of Latino America\u2014\u201cGunnar wrote \u201cMachisma Hermeneutics \u2013 Hemingway and the Hacienda Gringolust, An Obsession with the Latino Male.\u201d <ref>Beatty, Paul (1996), The White Boy Shuffle, p. 156</ref> Similarly, Gunnar references the Farm Workers Movement and the Chicano Movement through the character of Manny\u2014\u201cManny was a tall curly-haired Chicano whose mission in life was to improve the posture of every hunchbacked laborer, swaybacked [sex worker], and stoop-shouldered hoodlum in the neighborhood.\u201d <ref>Beatty, Paul (1996), The White Boy Shuffle, p. 156</ref> We even get introduced to Psycho Loco's (Cuban) Old Abuela Gloria.<ref>Beatty, Paul (1996), The White Boy Shuffle, p. 138</ref> Finally, Beatty remains true to Chicano slang from the time period with words like \u201cpocho,\u201d \u201cfirme,\u201d and \u201ccuete.\u201d\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:White Boy Shuffle}}\n[[Category:1996 American novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Boston]]\n[[Category:Boston University]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Santa Monica, California]]\n[[Category:American bildungsromans]]\n[[Category:Houghton Mifflin books]]\n[[Category:1996 debut novels]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox book \n  | name           =  The White Boy Shuffle\n  | title_orig     =  \n  | translator     =  \n  | image          =  \n  | caption  =  \n  | author         =  [[Paul Beatty]]\n  | illustrator    =  \n  | cover_artist   =  \n  | country        =  \n  | subject        =  \n  | genre          =  [[Novel]]\n  | publisher      =  [[Houghton Mifflin]], [[Picador (imprint)|Picador]]\n  | release_date   =  1996\n  | media_type     =  Print\n  | pages          =  226\n  | isbn =  0-312-28019-X\n  | dewey= 813'.54 dc21\n| congress= PS3552.E19W45 1997\n| preceded_by    =  \n  | followed_by    =  \n}}\n'''''The White Boy Shuffle''''' is the 1996 first novel of poet [[Paul Beatty]].<ref>{{Citation\n|last=Beatty\n|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Beatty\n|title=The White Boy Shuffle\n|publisher=Houghton Mifflin\n|year=1996\n|isbn=0-395-74280-3\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V1BaAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> A satiric coming-of-age tale following the life of poet, basketball star, and self-described \u201cNegro Demagogue\u201d Gunnar Kaufman, it has been noted for its postmodern treatment of African American gender and sexuality in addition to race.\n\n==Plot summary==\nIn the book's prologue, the reader meets the narrator, Gunnar Kaufman, a prolific African-American poet whose astronomically successful book, ''Watermelanin'', has sold 126 million copies, elevating him to the status of \"Negro Demagogue.\"  The prologue asserts that what follows are Gunnar memoirs, \"the battlefield remains of a frightened deserter in the eternal war for civility\" (2).  The novel opens with a comic survey of Gunnar's [[family tree]], as his mother relates the tales of his family history to him and his sisters.  Gunnar in turn regales his classmates with the tales of his ancestors, one of whom Gunnar claims dodged the bullet that eventually killed [[Crispus Attucks]] in the [[Boston Massacre]]. Gunnar is a young boy growing up in affluent, predominantly white [[Santa Monica]], [[California]] with his mother and sisters.  His absent father is a sketch artist for the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] and rarely sees his children.  Gunnar's friends are white, and he spends his free time making enough mischief to gain him mild admonishments from the Santa Monica Shore Patrol. This was found to be true because Kenneth Rogers made it so.\n\nWhen Gunnar and his sisters tell their mother they do not want to attend an all-black summer camp because the children there \"are different from us,\" Ms. Kaufman immediately packs up a [[U-Haul]] and relocates her family to the West [[Los Angeles]] neighborhood of Hillside, a predominantly black community surrounded by a concrete wall that Gunnar describes as the [[ghetto]] (37).  In Hillside, the Kaufman children encounter an altogether different lifestyle than the one they were accustomed to in Santa Monica.  Gunnar learns \"the hard way that social norms in Santa Monica were unforgivable breaches of proper Hillside etiquette, and soon after arriving is beaten up by one of the area's local [[gang]]s, the \"Gun Totin' Hooligans\" (52).\n\nEnrolling in the local junior high, Gunnar is offered protection by an administrator who fears that Gunnar's unfamiliarity with Hillside social norms will make him an easy target for harassment.  However, Gunnar soon strikes up a friendship with Nicholas Scoby when he is paired with the \"thuggish boy\" in a reading of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'' (66).  Scoby is a prodigious [[basketball]] player, with a remarkable ability to make, without exception, every basket.  Soon after meeting Scoby, Gunnar stuns the local children when he unintentionally exhibits his own, heretofore unknown talent for basketball, dunking the ball into the basket in a pickup game.  His talent gains him respect within the Hillside community of youths.  Ironically, this unusual talent causes him to stick out enables him to fit into the social scene.  Around this time, Gunnar writes his first poem, \"Negro Misappropriation of Greek Mythology or, I know Niggers That'll Kick Hercules's Ass\" and spray paints the lines across the concrete wall surrounding Hillside.  Later, instructed by Scoby, Gunnar changes his hairstyle and attire in an effort to further conform to Hillside society.\n\nAs the years pass, Gunnar becomes incredibly popular, both for his talent on the basketball court and for his emerging poetic prowess.  However, he remains somewhat of an outcast in his clear lack of dancing talent and his unease with women.  His friends, Scoby and feared gang-member and assumed murderer Psycho Loco, dub Gunnar's awkward antics on the dance floor \"The White Boy Shuffle.\"  Because of Gunnar's apparent inability to talk to women, Psycho Loco secretly takes it upon himself to order Gunnar a [[mail order bride]] from [[Japan]], using a service called \"Hot Mamma-Sans of the Orient.\"  Throughout high school, Gunnar continues to write poetry, much of which, we later learn, is published in magazines.\n\nDuring his sixteenth summer, Gunnar aids in his friends' stealing a department store safe during the turmoil of the [[1992 Los Angeles Riots]].  We learn that Psycho Loco has planned to steal the safe for nine years in retribution for the department store's having moved a race-car set the young Psycho intended to steal on the day he was to steal it.  As Gunnar and his friends attempt to load the safe into a car, Gunnar's father and other policemen arrive.  Gunnar's father beats him with a [[Baton (law enforcement)|nightstick]], and Gunnar is hospitalized.  When he is released from the hospital, he learns that his friends have been unable to open the safe.  Gunnar turns the safe over, finding the combination on the bottom, and opens it.  Gunnar refuses to take any of the money, gold, and precious stones inside.  In the last two weeks of summer, Gunnar attends a program for the top 100 high school basketball talents in the country, of which Gunnar is number 100.  From camp, he sends his friends and family several [[e-mails]], which are documented in the novel.  From these e-mails, we learn that both of Gunnar's sisters are [[pregnant]] and have moved in with their father.  We also learn that Gunnar, despite his basketball talent, is not incredibly interested in the game itself.  He is constantly frustrated by his roommates' insistence on constantly talking about the game.  Gunnar notes that his roommates even use basketball terms to talk about women.\n\nIn return for his father not pressing charges against him and his friends for the safe incident, Gunnar agrees to attend an elite public high school in the [[San Fernando Valley]].  Gunnar travels an hour and a half to and from school on a bus.  His return to a predominantly white atmosphere is an easy one, and Gunnar notes that he \"meshed well\" (153).  However, he disdains the arrogance of several of the rich, white boys with whom his mother insists he spend time.\n\nIn his senior year, Gunnar begins receiving letters from the [[armed forces]] academies, [[Harvard University]], and [[Boston University]].  He visits a wealthy, African American Harvard graduate in his large home, which overlooks Hillside, realizing that years earlier he and his Hooligan friends had stolen a security sign out of the front lawn and destroyed the man's [[RV]].  Gunnar is disgusted by the man's superior attitude towards the residents of Hillside and decides he will never attend Harvard.  When a recruiter from BU arrives at his house, Gunnar decides to attend BU instead.\n\nBefore Gunnar leaves for college, it is revealed that Psycho Loco has indeed ordered Gunnar a wife from Japan when she arrives by [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] on Gunnar's 18th [[birthday]].  Yoshiko Katsu speaks little English but is an immediate hit with Gunnar's mother.  For their [[honeymoon]], Gunnar and Yoshiko drive to an [[amusement park]], listening to the radio and attempting to bridge the gap between their two mother tongues.\n\nMoving to [[Boston]], Gunnar attends one class at BU: Creative Writing 104.  When he tells the class his name, he is overwhelmed by a chorus of accolades as the students in the class recite his now famous poetry back to him and barrage him with questions.  Uncomfortable with the attention, Gunnar runs from the room, tearing off his clothes and walking home to his apartment.  At the insistence of his professor, who has followed him along with the members of the class, Gunnar agrees to publish a collection of his poetry.  The collection will become his book, ''Watermelanin''.\n\nIn Boston, Gunnar begins to face a degree of prejudice from other Black people for his marriage to the Japanese Yoshiko.  At the insistence of Scoby, who is attending BU, Gunnar attends several meetings of student activist clubs such as the citywide black student union and SWAPO, or the Whities Against Political Obsequeiousness, of which he is the only black member.  Waking simultaneously one night from dreams, Gunnar and Yoshiko realize that the latter is pregnant.  Gunnar begins traveling on a basketball team with Scoby.  He becomes increasingly depressed, and his only consolation are the boxes of Japanese literature sent to him on the road from Yoshiko.  In return, Gunnar writes her letters.  In these letters, he notes that Scoby \"is going insane\" (192).\n\nAfter basketball season ends, Gunnar\u2014now an even greater celebrity\u2014is asked by his publisher to speak at a rally protesting BU's decision to confer an honorary degree upon a corrupt African statesman.  Initially unsure of what to say to the crowd, Gunnar eventually tells the crowd that \"What we need is some new leaders.  Leaders who won't apostatize like cowards.  Some niggers who are ready to die!\" (200).  The frenzied crowd chants \"You! You! You!\" and Gunnar's place as \"Negro Demagogue\" is solidified.  From his speech, the media assumes that Gunnar is an advocate of freedom through suicide, and though Gunnar makes it clear that he means only his own suicide, many across America begin killing themselves and sending their \"death poems\" to Gunnar.  When asked when he plans to commit suicide, Gunnar replies \"When I'm good and goddamn ready\" (202).\n\nOne night, on the beach, a deeply unhappy and depressed Scoby asks Gunnar what the highest building in Boston is before leaving the beach.  The next morning Gunnar learns that Scoby has jumped from the roof of the BU law school, killing himself.  On the roof, Gunnar finds his friend's suicide note, containing his own death poem.\n\nGunnar and Yoshiko resolve to return to Hillside, but Gunnar is forced into hiding by an outstanding warrant for his arrest by the LAPD.  One night, on the beach with Psycho Loco and Yoshiko, Gunnar walks out into the ocean, realizes he could die if he swam out farther, and gives himself to the currents.  Hit with thoughts of his unborn child, he snaps out of a meditative state underwater and swims back to shore.  Gunnar and Yoshiko check into a motel, where the spend the remainder of the novel ostensibly hiding from the LAPD, occupying their time by having debates and reading death poems from Gunnar's fans.  However, one night, Gunnar walks to [[7-Eleven]] and is caught in a police helicopter's search light.  The light follows him home.  He and Yoshiko begin taking nighttime walks through Hillside, their way constantly lit by the helicopter.  Eventually, they are joined by other members of the community on their walks.\n\nWith Gunnar's mother acting as [[midwife]], Yoshiko gives birth to a girl, Naomi Katsu Kaufman, in a small pool in the local park.  The birth is attended by a large crowd and is guarded by the members of the Gun Totin' Hooligans.  As always, the LAPD helicopter hovers overhead.  It drops a box of cigars attached to a parachute when Yoshiko gives birth.  In what appears to be Gunnar's father's handwriting, a note is attached that reads, \"Congratulations from the Los Angeles Police Department.  Maybe this one will grow up with a respect for authority\" (219).\n\nAs the novel comes to a close, Gunnar begins holding weekly, outdoor open mics, reading his poetry to great crowds.  At one gathering, on the two-year anniversary of Scoby's suicide, Gunnar shocks the crowd by chopping off the smallest finger on his right hand with a kitchen knife.  His sacrifice \"cement[s] his status as savior of the blacks\" (223).  Elevating Gunnar to the status of cult figure, \"spiteful black folks\" travel in droves to Hillside, prompting the government to threaten the community with an ultimatum: \"rejoin the rest of America or celebrate Kwanza in hell\" (224).  Hillside residents respond by painting the roofs of the community with white targets.  The novel ends with Gunnar, still living in the [[motel]] with Yoshiko and Naomi, beginning to tell his daughter the same stories of his family tree told to him in his youth by his mother.  The first such tale is that of Gunnar's father.  The novel ends with his death poem, left in his LAPD locker before he kills himself by swallowing his own [[gun]].\n\n==Genre==\n''The White Boy Shuffle'' is a fictional satirical piece framed around the Black messiah, Gunnar Kaufman.

Beatty created a character that fit into a white community as equally well as a black community; he also marries and impregnates a Japanese woman. From Gunnar's encounter with the Harvard graduate, he learns that he is not interested in losing his true African American self to become a pretentious imposter. The African American community appoints him to the status of Negro Demagogue. They overlook the Caucasian environment that saturates the majority of his upbringing and his Japanese wife because at the end of the day, Gunnar is simply an African American male. This book proves that being raised in a ghetto or only having African American friends are not the only qualification that one must fill to be considered \u201cBlack.\u201d Anyone can represent the African American community, including well-spoken, well-educated black men and women. Paul Beatty's novel puts the foot in the door for a new Black being. It is a [http://wordsmith-lesson.blogspot.com/2010/10/new-black-aesthetic-conversation-with.html New Black Aesthetic].\n\n===Black exceptionality===\nThe theme of black exceptionality is explored in the characters of Gunnar and Scoby. Both Gunnar and Scoby represent [[The Talented Tenth|\"the talented tenth\"]], in that they escape Hillside and go on to higher education and promising futures. However, their successes are perceived differently by the white community. Scoby, the perfect Basketball player who is incapable of missing a basketball shot, is vilified and perceived as the pagan African demon with mystical powers. In contrast, Gunnar, a great player but not as good as Scoby, becomes \u201cwhite society\u2019s mercenary\u201d. He is accepted, tolerated, and claimed by whiteness, because of his lack of apparent blackness. Because Gunnar has never fulfilled the stereotypical \"black\" role, whites view him as less of a deviance from the hegemonic ideals. This is a larger commentary on where Blacks are allowed to be in the social hierarchy, and the limitations placed on their successes. Gunnar comments of the white community's treatment of Scoby saying \u201cthey would be a lot better off if they simply called Scoby a god and left it at that, it's no way they\u2019ll proclaim a skinny black man God\u201d.\n\nThis theme is also explored with regard to Gunnar's participation in both basketball and poetry. While Gunnar exceeds at both hobbies, he is especially invested in poetry. For him, playing basketball is not as inherently interesting as it is simply an activity that makes him popular, but poetry intrigued him before he really knew how to write it. In the book, Gunnar narrates, \"It occurred to me that maybe poems are like colds. Maybe I would feel a poem coming on. My chest would grow heavier, my eyes watery; my body temperature would fluctuate, and a ringing in my ears would herald the coming of a timeless verse (79).\" Through Gunnar's shifting interests, Beatty comments on the intersection between exceptionality and passion. While Gunnar is expected to be good at basketball to be a \"real\" black male, the satisfaction it brings him is only superficial and dependent on the gaze of others. Poetry, on the other hand, is a skill that Gunnar builds on his own and eventually becomes so famous that his magnum opus, ''Watermelanin'', becomes so famous that he unintentionally becomes a \"Leader of the Black Community\" (1). As a result, Gunnar's blackness is ironically validated and treated as exceptional on a large scale through his \"nerdy\" pursuit of poetry instead of through basketball, like he had originally imagined.\n\n===Latinidad===\n\nBased out of Los Angeles, Gunnar's stay in Hillside happens in the context of a predominantly Black but also Latino population. We are first introduced to the Latinos in Gunnar's proximity when he walks the halls of his new school and notices the change over time of the school's demographics. By the 1960s, in the context of the [[Civil Rights]] Movements and other subsequent community movements for [[self-determination]], \u201cThe faces of these graduating ninth-graders are dark and overwhelmingly Latino and black.\u201d <ref>Beatty, Paul (1996), The White Boy Shuffle, p. 60</ref> Gunnar walks down the hall and sees writing in Spanish\u2014\u201cKathleen y Flaco para siempre con alma\u201d sketched on the wall. (62) Later, his schools hosts the, \u201cYoung Black and Latino Men: Endangered Species\u2019 assembly.\u201d <ref>Beatty, Paul (1996), The White Boy Shuffle, p. 112</ref> Notably, the text also makes various references to Latino and [[Chicano]] communities in the LA area.\n\nBeatty is both playful and intentional about how he represents or pokes fun at Latinidad. For instance, he discusses the \u201cSan Borrachos Mountains\u201d (Holy Drunk Mts) that do not officially exist. Later, in his Spanish class, he puts Mexican [[Octavio Paz]] and California Chicano Frost in the same sentence, saying \u201cYo voy a escribir poemas como Octavio Paz y [[Kid Frost]]\u2026 Octavio Paz ere un poeta gordiflon y activista de Mexico\u2026 [Kid Frost] es un poetastro hip-hop de la viaja guardia, de la vieja escuela quien vivio en Pomona\u2026 de la old school.\u201d <ref>Beatty, Paul (1996), The White Boy Shuffle, p. 76</ref> To continue the literary allusions, Gunnar goes on to shut down the [[fetishization]] of Latino America\u2014\u201cGunnar wrote \u201cMachisma Hermeneutics \u2013 Hemingway and the Hacienda Gringolust, An Obsession with the Latino Male.\u201d <ref>Beatty, Paul (1996), The White Boy Shuffle, p. 156</ref> Similarly, Gunnar references the Farm Workers Movement and the Chicano Movement through the character of Manny\u2014\u201cManny was a tall curly-haired Chicano whose mission in life was to improve the posture of every hunchbacked laborer, swaybacked [sex worker], and stoop-shouldered hoodlum in the neighborhood.\u201d <ref>Beatty, Paul (1996), The White Boy Shuffle, p. 156</ref> We even get introduced to Psycho Loco's (Cuban) Old Abuela Gloria.<ref>Beatty, Paul (1996), The White Boy Shuffle, p. 138</ref> Finally, Beatty remains true to Chicano slang from the time period with words like \u201cpocho,\u201d \u201cfirme,\u201d and \u201ccuete.\u201d\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:White Boy Shuffle}}\n[[Category:1996 American novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Boston]]\n[[Category:Boston University]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Santa Monica, California]]\n[[Category:American bildungsromans]]\n[[Category:Houghton Mifflin books]]\n[[Category:1996 debut novels]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo/fmt (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Boy_Shuffle"}

The ages for professionals are up to 45 for men and 35 for women for three years service as commissioned and non-commissioned officers.\n \nAn official publication has revealed that almost one-quarter of Myanmar's new national budget will be allocated to defence. The Government Gazette reports that 1.8&nbsp;trillion kyat (about $2&nbsp;billion at free market rates of exchange), or 23.6 percent of the 2011 budget will go to defence.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9LMDOSO1.htm|title=Myanmar allocates 1/4 of new budget to military|date=1 March 2011|agency=[[Associated Press]]|access-date=9 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628213807/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9LMDOSO1.htm#|archive-date=28 June 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n \n==Brief history==\n \n=== Post Independence era ===\n[[File:Myanmar Army personnel at Naypyidaw reception.jpg|thumb|Myanmar Army Honour Guards saluting the arrival of Thai delegation in October 2010.]]\n \nAt the time of Myanmar's independence in 1948, the Tatmadaw was weak, small and disunited. Cracks appeared along the lines of ethnic background, political affiliation, organisational origin and different services. Its unity and operational efficiency was further weakened by the interference of civilians and politicians in military affairs, and the perception gap between the staff officers and field commanders. The most serious problem was the tension between ethnic [[Karen people|Karen]] Officers, coming from the British Burma Army and [[Bamar]] officers, coming from the [[Patriotic Burmese Forces]] (PBF).<ref name=\"DSHMRI Archives\">Defence Services Historical Museum and Research Institute (DSHMRI) Archives</ref>\n \nIn accordance with agreement reached at Kandy Conference in September 1945, the Tatmadaw was reorganised by incorporating the [[British Burma Army]] and the Patriotic Burmese Forces. The officer corps shared by ex-PBF officers and officers from British Burma Army and Army of Burma Reserve Organisation (ARBO). The British also decided to form what were known as \"Class Battalions\" based on ethnicity. There were a total of 15 rifle battalions at the time of independence and four of them were made up of former members of PBF.  All influential positions within the War Office and commands were manned with non-former PBF Officers. All services including military engineers, supply and transport, ordnance and medical services, Navy and Air Force were all commanded by former Officers from ABRO and British Burma Army.<ref name=\"DSHMRI Archives\"/>\n \n \n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Ethnic and Army Composition of Tatmadaw in 1948\n|-\n!

There were 337 [[infantry battalion]]s, including 266 [[light infantry]] battalions. Although the Myanmar Army's organisational structure was based upon the [[Regiment|regimental system]], the basic manoeuvre and fighting unit is the [[battalion]], known as ''Tat Yinn'' ({{my|(\u1010\u1015\u103a\u101b\u1004\u103a\u1038)}}) in Burmese.  This comprised a headquarters unit; five rifle companies ''Tat Khwe'' ({{my|(\u1010\u1015\u103a\u1001\u103d\u1032)}}) with three rifle platoons ''Tat Su'' ({{my|(\u1010\u1015\u103a\u1005\u102f)}}) each; an administration company with medical, transport, logistics and signals units; a heavy weapons company including [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]], machine gun and [[recoilless gun]] platoons.  Each [[battalion]] is commanded by a Lieutenant Colonel ''Du Ti Ya Bo Hmu Gyi or Du Bo Hmu Gyi'' with a Major (''bo hmu'') as 2IC (Second in Command), with a total establishment strength of 27 officers and 723 other ranks. Light infantry battalions in the Myanmar Army have much lower establishment strength of around 500; this often leads to these units being mistakenly identified by the observers and reporters as under strength infantry battalions.\n \nWith its significantly increased personnel numbers, weaponry and mobility, today's ''Tatmadaw Kyee'' ({{my|\u1010\u1015\u103a\u1019\u1010\u1031\u102c\u103a(\u1000\u103c\u100a\u103a\u1038)}}) is a formidable conventional defence force for the Union of Myanmar.  Troops ready for combat duty have at least doubled since 1988.  Logistics infrastructure and [[Artillery]] Fire Support has been greatly increased.  Its newly acquired military might was apparent in the Tatmadaw's dry season operations against [[Karen National Union]] (KNU) strongholds in [[Manerplaw]] and Kawmura.  Most of the casualties at these battles were the result of intense and heavy bombardment by the Tatmadaw Kyee.  The Tatmadaw Kyee is now much larger than it was before 1988, it is more mobile and has greatly improved armour, artillery and air defence inventories.  Its C3I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence) systems have been expanded and refined.  It is developing larger and more integrated, self-sustained formations to better coordinated action by different combat arms. The army may still have relatively modest weaponry compared to its larger neighbours, but it is now in a much better position to deter external aggression and respond to such a threat should it ever arise, although [[child soldiers]] may not perform very well in combating with enemies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HJ07Ae01.html |title=Myanmar's losing military strategy |date=7 October 2006 |work=[[Asia Times]] |accessdate=28 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513043428/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HJ07Ae01.html# |archive-date=13 May 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n \n===Expansion===\nThe first army [[division (military)|division]] to be formed after the 1988 military [[coup d'etat|coup]] was the 11th Light Infantry Division (LID) in December 1988 with [[Colonel]] Win Myint as commander of the division.  In March 1990, a new regional military command was opened in [[Monywa]] with [[Brigadier]] Kyaw Min as commander and named North-Western Regional Military Command.  A year later 101st LID was formed in [[Pakokku]] with Colonel Saw Tun as commander.  Two Regional Operations Commands (ROC) were formed in [[Myeik, Burma|Myeik]] and [[Loikaw]] to facilitate command and control.  They were commanded respectively by Brigadier Soe Tint and Brigadier Maung Kyi.  March 1995 saw a dramatic expansion of the Tatmadaw as it established 11 Military Operations Commands (MOC)s in that month.  MOC are similar to [[Mechanised Infantry]] Divisions in western armies, each with 10 regular infantry battalions (''Chay Hlyin Tatyin''), a headquarters, and organic support units including [[field artillery]] batteries.  Then in 1996, two new RMC were opened, Coastal Region RMC was opened in Myeik with Brigadier Sit Maung as commander and Triangle Region RMC in [[Kengtung]] with Brigadier [[Thein Sein]] as commander.  Three new ROCs were opened in [[Kalay]], [[Bhamo]] and [[Mongsat]].  In late 1998, two new MOCs were opened in Bokepyin and Mongsat.<ref>WP 342. [[Australian National University]]</ref>\n \nThe most significant expansion after the infantry in the army was in armour and artillery. Beginning in 1990, the Tatmadaw procured 18 [[Type 59 tank|T-69II]] [[Main battle tank]]s and 48 [[PT-76|T-63]] amphibious [[light tank]]s from China.  Further procurements were made, including several hundred [[Type 85 AFV|Type 85]] and [[WZ551|Type 92]] [[Armoured personnel carrier]]s (APC).  By the beginning of 1998, Tatmadaw had about 100+ T-69II Main battle tanks, a similar number of T-63 amphibious light tanks and several T-59D tanks.  These tanks and armoured personnel carriers were distributed into five armoured infantry battalions and five tank battalions and formed the first Armoured Division of the Tatmadaw under the name of 71st Armoured Operations Command with its headquarters in Pyawbwe.\n \n===Bureau of Special Operations (BSO)===\n[[File:MM MOD New.svg|thumb|Bureau of Special Operations|150px]]\n[[File:mm-rmc-map.jpg|thumb|Regional Military Commands (RMC)|200px]]\nBureau of Special Operations ({{my|\u1000\u102c\u1000\u103d\u101a\u103a\u101b\u1031\u1038\u100c\u102c\u1014 \u1005\u1005\u103a\u1006\u1004\u103a\u101b\u1031\u1038 \u1021\u1011\u1030\u1038\u1021\u1016\u103d\u1032\u1037}}) in Myanmar Army are high-level field units equivalent to [[Field Army]] in Western terms and consist of 2 or more Regional Military Commands (RMC) and commanded by a lieutenant-general and 6 staff officers.\n \nThe units were introduced under the [[General Staff|General Staff Office]] on 28 April 1978 and 1 June 1979. In early 1978, the then Chairman of BSPP General Ne Win visited the North Eastern Command Headquarters in Lashio to receive a briefing about [[Burmese Communist Party]] (BCP) [[insurgents]] and their [[military operations]].  He was accompanied by Brigadier General Tun Ye from Ministry of Defence. Brigadier General Tun Ye was the regional commander of Eastern Command for three years and before that he served in North Eastern Command areas as commander of Strategic Operation Command (SOC) and commander for Light Infantry Division for four years.  As BCP military operations were spread across three Regional Military Command (RMC) areas (Northern, Eastern and North Eastern), Brigadier General Tun Ye was the most informed commander about the BCP in Myanmar Army at the time.  At the briefing, General Ne Win was impressed by Brigadier General Tun Ye and realised that co-ordination among various Regional Military Commands (RMC) was necessary; thus, decided to form a bureau at the Ministry of Defence.\n \nOriginally, the bureau was for \"special operations\", wherever they were, that needed co-ordination among various Regional Military Commands (RMC).  Later, with introduction of another bureau, there was a division of command areas.  The BSO-1 was to oversee the operations under the Northern Command, North Eastern Command, the Eastern Command, and the North Western Command.  BSO-2 was to oversee operations under the South Eastern Command, South Western Command, Western Command and Central Command.\n \nInitially, the chief of the BSO had the rank of brigadier general.  The rank was upgraded to major general on 23 April 1979.  in 1990, it was further upgraded to lieutenant general.  Between 1995 and 2002, Chief of Staff (Army) jointly held the position of Chief of BSO.  However, in early 2002, two more BSO were added to the General Staff Office; therefore there were altogether four BSOs.  The fifth BSO was established in 2005 and the sixth in 2007.\n \nCurrently there are Six Bureaus of Special Operations in Myanmar order of Battle.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\">Defence Services Historical Museum and Research Institute</ref>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Until 1961, there were only two regional commands, they were supported by 13 Infantry brigades and an infantry division. In October 1961, new regional military commands were opened and leaving only two independent infantry brigades. In June 1963, the Naypyidaw Command was temporarily formed in [[Yangon]] with the deputy commander and some staff officers drawn from Central Command.  It was reorganised and renamed as Yangon Command on 1 June 1965.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \nA total of 337 infantry and light infantry battalions organised in Tactical Operations Commands, 37 independent field artillery regiments supported by affiliated support units including armoured [[reconnaissance]] and [[tank]] battalions.

It was renamed Bureau of Air Defence in the early 2000s (decade). In early 2000, Tatmadaw established Myanmar Integrated Air Defence System (MIADS) with help from Russia, [[Ukraine]] and China. It is a tri-service bureau with units from all three branches of Myanmar Armed Forces. All Air Defence assets except [[Anti-Aircraft Artillery]] within Tatmadaw arsenal are integrated into MIADS. AAA guns are mostly unguided and deploy to use in barrage-style firing against attacking aircraft. MIADS is directly answerable to Bureau of Air Defence under Ministry of Defence.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \nIn 2010, Myanmar Air Defence Command has completed installation of optical fibre communication network throughout the country. Those network are to be used for Air defence operations between Central Command HQ from capital & several air bases, early warning radar stations & mobile anti air craft missile & artillery units. After completion of fibre optic project & radar stations, MIADS (Myanmar Integrated Air Defence System) becomes the most advance AD system in the region.\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Each SOC transmitted data back to Intercept Operations Centers (IOC), which in turn controlled [[surface-to-air missile]] batteries and [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]/[[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] squadrons at various Air Bases. Each IOC was optimised to direct either SAMs or fighter/interceptor aircraft against incoming enemy aircraft or missile. Each IOC was connected to observer and early warning area reporting posts (RP) via military owned underground fibre optic cable network. There were about 100 [[radar|radar stations]] located at approximately 40 sites throughout the country. New Air Defence radars such as 1L117 radars, Galaxy Early Warning Radar and P series radars are installed in all radar stations.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \nEach Sector Operation Center (SOC) is commanded by a major general and it consists of one air defence division from Myanmar Army and one fighter-interceptor wing from [[Myanmar Air Force]]. Sometimes Air Defence [[Frigate]]s from Myanmar Navy also operate under the direct command of respective SOC.\n \nEach Air Defence division is commanded by a brigadier general and consists of three Air Defence Tactical Operations Command (TOC) and support units. One Medium Range Surface to Air Missile Tactical Operations Command (MRSAM-TOC), with three battalions equipped with [[Buk missile system|Buk M-1]] or [[2K12 Kub|Kub]] missile system is deployed in an Area Defence Belt role. One Short Range Air Defence Tactical Operations Command (SHORAD-TOC), with three battalions equipped with [[Tor M-1]] missile system is deployed in a Point Defence role for critical areas such as radar stations, fighter bases and SOC headquarters. One Electronic Reconnaissance Tactical Operations Command (EIR-TOC) with 6 to 8 radar and communication companies for early warnings and interdiction detection.\n \nEach fighter-interceptor wing commanded by a [[brigadier general]] and is composed of three Fighter squadrons of either [[MiG-29]] and [[Chengdu J-7|F-7M Airguardi]]Interceptors (ten aircraft per squadron) and their ground base support units.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It consisted HQ Burma Signals, Burma Signal Training Squadron (BSTS) and Burma Signals Squadron.  HQ Burma Signals was located within War Office.  BSTS based in Pyain Oo Lwin was formed with Operating Cipher Training Troop, Dispacth Rider Training Troop, Lineman Training Troop, Radio Mechanic Training Troop and Regimental Signals Training Troop.  BSS, based in Mingalardon, had nince sections: Administration Troop, Maintenance Troop, Operating Troop, Cipher Troop, Lineman and Dispatch Rider Troop, NBSD Signals Troop, SBSD Signals Troop, Mobile Brigade Signals Toop and Arakan Signals Toop.  The then Chief of Signal Staff Officer (CSO) was Lieutenant Colonel Saw Aung Din.  BSTS and BSS were later renamed No. 1 Signal Battalion and No.1 Signal Training Battalion.  In 1952, the Infantry Divisional Signals Regiment was formed and later renamed to No. 2 Signal Battalion.  HQ Burma Signals was reorganised and became Directorate Signal and the director was elevated to the rank of Colonel.  In 1956, No. 1 Signal Security Battalion was formed, followed by No. 3 Signal Battalion in November 1958 and No.4 Signal Battalion in October 1959.\n \nIn 1961, signal battalions were reorganised as No. 11 Signal Battalion under North Eastern Regional Military Command, No. 121 Signal Battalion under Eastern Command, No. 313 Signal Battalion under Central Command, No.414 Signal Battalion under South Western Command, and No. 515 Signal Battalion under South Eastern Command.  No.1 Signal Training Battalion was renamed Burma Signal Training Depot (Baho-Setthweye-Tat).\n \nBy 1988, Directorate of Signals command one training depot, eight signal battalions, one signal security battalion, one signal store depot and two signal workshops.  Signal Corps under Directorate of Signal further expanded during 1990 expansion and reorganisation of Myanmar Armed Forces.  By 2000, a signal battalion is attached to each Regional Military Command and signal companies are now attached to Light Infantry Divisions and Military Operations Commands.\n \nIn 2000, [[C4ISTAR|Command, Control and Communication]] system of Myanmar Army has been substantially upgraded by setting up the military [[fibre optic]] communication network managed by Directorate of Signal throughout the country. Since 2002 all Myanmar Army Regional Military Command HQs used its own telecommunication system. [[Satellite communication|Satellite communication links]] are also provided to forward-deployed infantry battalions. However, battle field communication systems are still poor. Infantry units are still using TRA 906 and PRM 4051 which were acquired from UK in the 1980s. Myanmar Army also uses the locally built TRA 906 Thura and Chinese XD-D6M radio sets. Frequency hopping handsets are fitted to all front line units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burmanet.org/news/2010/08/13/jane%E2%80%99s-intelligence-review-radio-active-%E2%80%93-desmond-ball-and-samuel-blythe/|title=Burmanet \" Jane's Intelligence Review: Radio active \u2013 Desmond Ball and Samuel Blythe|accessdate=29 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206031853/http://www.burmanet.org/news/2010/08/13/jane%E2%80%99s-intelligence-review-radio-active-%E2%80%93-desmond-ball-and-samuel-blythe/#|archive-date=6 December 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n \nBetween 2000 and 2005, Myanmar army bought 50 units of Brett 2050 Advanced Tech radio set from Aussie through third party from Singapore.

The highest rank in the Myanmar Army is Senior General, equivalent to [[Field Marshal]] position in Western Armies and is currently held by Min Aung Hlaing after being promoted from Vice-Senior General.\n \nIn 2011, following transition from military junta government to civilian parliamentary government, the Myanmar Army enacted a military draft for all citizens; all males from the age 18 to 35 and all females age between 18 and 27 years of age can be drafted into military service for two years as enlisted personnel in time of national emergency. The ages for professionals are up to 45 for men and 35 for women for three years service as commissioned and non-commissioned officers.\n \nAn official publication has revealed that almost one-quarter of Myanmar's new national budget will be allocated to defence. The Government Gazette reports that 1.8&nbsp;trillion kyat (about $2&nbsp;billion at free market rates of exchange), or 23.6 percent of the 2011 budget will go to defence.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9LMDOSO1.htm|title=Myanmar allocates 1/4 of new budget to military|date=1 March 2011|agency=[[Associated Press]]|access-date=9 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628213807/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9LMDOSO1.htm#|archive-date=28 June 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n \n==Brief history==\n \n=== Post Independence era ===\n[[File:Myanmar Army personnel at Naypyidaw reception.jpg|thumb|Myanmar Army Honour Guards saluting the arrival of Thai delegation in October 2010.]]\n \nAt the time of Myanmar's independence in 1948, the Tatmadaw was weak, small and disunited. Cracks appeared along the lines of ethnic background, political affiliation, organisational origin and different services. Its unity and operational efficiency was further weakened by the interference of civilians and politicians in military affairs, and the perception gap between the staff officers and field commanders. The most serious problem was the tension between ethnic [[Karen people|Karen]] Officers, coming from the British Burma Army and [[Bamar]] officers, coming from the [[Patriotic Burmese Forces]] (PBF).<ref name=\"DSHMRI Archives\">Defence Services Historical Museum and Research Institute (DSHMRI) Archives</ref>\n \nIn accordance with agreement reached at Kandy Conference in September 1945, the Tatmadaw was reorganised by incorporating the [[British Burma Army]] and the Patriotic Burmese Forces. The officer corps shared by ex-PBF officers and officers from British Burma Army and Army of Burma Reserve Organisation (ARBO). The British also decided to form what were known as \"Class Battalions\" based on ethnicity. There were a total of 15 rifle battalions at the time of independence and four of them were made up of former members of PBF.  All influential positions within the War Office and commands were manned with non-former PBF Officers. All services including military engineers, supply and transport, ordnance and medical services, Navy and Air Force were all commanded by former Officers from ABRO and British Burma Army.<ref name=\"DSHMRI Archives\"/>\n \n \n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Ethnic and Army Composition of Tatmadaw in 1948\n|-\n!

There were 337 [[infantry battalion]]s, including 266 [[light infantry]] battalions. Although the Myanmar Army's organisational structure was based upon the [[Regiment|regimental system]], the basic manoeuvre and fighting unit is the [[battalion]], known as ''Tat Yinn'' ({{my|(\u1010\u1015\u103a\u101b\u1004\u103a\u1038)}}) in Burmese.  This comprised a headquarters unit; five rifle companies ''Tat Khwe'' ({{my|(\u1010\u1015\u103a\u1001\u103d\u1032)}}) with three rifle platoons ''Tat Su'' ({{my|(\u1010\u1015\u103a\u1005\u102f)}}) each; an administration company with medical, transport, logistics and signals units; a heavy weapons company including [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]], machine gun and [[recoilless gun]] platoons.  Each [[battalion]] is commanded by a Lieutenant Colonel ''Du Ti Ya Bo Hmu Gyi or Du Bo Hmu Gyi'' with a Major (''bo hmu'') as 2IC (Second in Command), with a total establishment strength of 27 officers and 723 other ranks. Light infantry battalions in the Myanmar Army have much lower establishment strength of around 500; this often leads to these units being mistakenly identified by the observers and reporters as under strength infantry battalions.\n \nWith its significantly increased personnel numbers, weaponry and mobility, today's ''Tatmadaw Kyee'' ({{my|\u1010\u1015\u103a\u1019\u1010\u1031\u102c\u103a(\u1000\u103c\u100a\u103a\u1038)}}) is a formidable conventional defence force for the Union of Myanmar.  Troops ready for combat duty have at least doubled since 1988.  Logistics infrastructure and [[Artillery]] Fire Support has been greatly increased.  Its newly acquired military might was apparent in the Tatmadaw's dry season operations against [[Karen National Union]] (KNU) strongholds in [[Manerplaw]] and Kawmura.  Most of the casualties at these battles were the result of intense and heavy bombardment by the Tatmadaw Kyee.  The Tatmadaw Kyee is now much larger than it was before 1988, it is more mobile and has greatly improved armour, artillery and air defence inventories.  Its C3I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence) systems have been expanded and refined.  It is developing larger and more integrated, self-sustained formations to better coordinated action by different combat arms. The army may still have relatively modest weaponry compared to its larger neighbours, but it is now in a much better position to deter external aggression and respond to such a threat should it ever arise, although [[child soldiers]] may not perform very well in combating with enemies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HJ07Ae01.html |title=Myanmar's losing military strategy |date=7 October 2006 |work=[[Asia Times]] |accessdate=28 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513043428/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/HJ07Ae01.html# |archive-date=13 May 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n \n===Expansion===\nThe first army [[division (military)|division]] to be formed after the 1988 military [[coup d'etat|coup]] was the 11th Light Infantry Division (LID) in December 1988 with [[Colonel]] Win Myint as commander of the division.  In March 1990, a new regional military command was opened in [[Monywa]] with [[Brigadier]] Kyaw Min as commander and named North-Western Regional Military Command.  A year later 101st LID was formed in [[Pakokku]] with Colonel Saw Tun as commander.  Two Regional Operations Commands (ROC) were formed in [[Myeik, Burma|Myeik]] and [[Loikaw]] to facilitate command and control.  They were commanded respectively by Brigadier Soe Tint and Brigadier Maung Kyi.  March 1995 saw a dramatic expansion of the Tatmadaw as it established 11 Military Operations Commands (MOC)s in that month.  MOC are similar to [[Mechanised Infantry]] Divisions in western armies, each with 10 regular infantry battalions (''Chay Hlyin Tatyin''), a headquarters, and organic support units including [[field artillery]] batteries.  Then in 1996, two new RMC were opened, Coastal Region RMC was opened in Myeik with Brigadier Sit Maung as commander and Triangle Region RMC in [[Kengtung]] with Brigadier [[Thein Sein]] as commander.  Three new ROCs were opened in [[Kalay]], [[Bhamo]] and [[Mongsat]].  In late 1998, two new MOCs were opened in Bokepyin and Mongsat.<ref>WP 342. [[Australian National University]]</ref>\n \nThe most significant expansion after the infantry in the army was in armour and artillery. Beginning in 1990, the Tatmadaw procured 18 [[Type 59 tank|T-69II]] [[Main battle tank]]s and 48 [[PT-76|T-63]] amphibious [[light tank]]s from China.  Further procurements were made, including several hundred [[Type 85 AFV|Type 85]] and [[WZ551|Type 92]] [[Armoured personnel carrier]]s (APC).  By the beginning of 1998, Tatmadaw had about 100+ T-69II Main battle tanks, a similar number of T-63 amphibious light tanks and several T-59D tanks.  These tanks and armoured personnel carriers were distributed into five armoured infantry battalions and five tank battalions and formed the first Armoured Division of the Tatmadaw under the name of 71st Armoured Operations Command with its headquarters in Pyawbwe.\n \n===Bureau of Special Operations (BSO)===\n[[File:MM MOD New.svg|thumb|Bureau of Special Operations|150px]]\n[[File:mm-rmc-map.jpg|thumb|Regional Military Commands (RMC)|200px]]\nBureau of Special Operations ({{my|\u1000\u102c\u1000\u103d\u101a\u103a\u101b\u1031\u1038\u100c\u102c\u1014 \u1005\u1005\u103a\u1006\u1004\u103a\u101b\u1031\u1038 \u1021\u1011\u1030\u1038\u1021\u1016\u103d\u1032\u1037}}) in Myanmar Army are high-level field units equivalent to [[Field Army]] in Western terms and consist of 2 or more Regional Military Commands (RMC) and commanded by a lieutenant-general and 6 staff officers.\n \nThe units were introduced under the [[General Staff|General Staff Office]] on 28 April 1978 and 1 June 1979. In early 1978, the then Chairman of BSPP General Ne Win visited the North Eastern Command Headquarters in Lashio to receive a briefing about [[Burmese Communist Party]] (BCP) [[insurgents]] and their [[military operations]].  He was accompanied by Brigadier General Tun Ye from Ministry of Defence. Brigadier General Tun Ye was the regional commander of Eastern Command for three years and before that he served in North Eastern Command areas as commander of Strategic Operation Command (SOC) and commander for Light Infantry Division for four years.  As BCP military operations were spread across three Regional Military Command (RMC) areas (Northern, Eastern and North Eastern), Brigadier General Tun Ye was the most informed commander about the BCP in Myanmar Army at the time.  At the briefing, General Ne Win was impressed by Brigadier General Tun Ye and realised that co-ordination among various Regional Military Commands (RMC) was necessary; thus, decided to form a bureau at the Ministry of Defence.\n \nOriginally, the bureau was for \"special operations\", wherever they were, that needed co-ordination among various Regional Military Commands (RMC).  Later, with introduction of another bureau, there was a division of command areas.  The BSO-1 was to oversee the operations under the Northern Command, North Eastern Command, the Eastern Command, and the North Western Command.  BSO-2 was to oversee operations under the South Eastern Command, South Western Command, Western Command and Central Command.\n \nInitially, the chief of the BSO had the rank of brigadier general.  The rank was upgraded to major general on 23 April 1979.  in 1990, it was further upgraded to lieutenant general.  Between 1995 and 2002, Chief of Staff (Army) jointly held the position of Chief of BSO.  However, in early 2002, two more BSO were added to the General Staff Office; therefore there were altogether four BSOs.  The fifth BSO was established in 2005 and the sixth in 2007.\n \nCurrently there are Six Bureaus of Special Operations in Myanmar order of Battle.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\">Defence Services Historical Museum and Research Institute</ref>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Until 1961, there were only two regional commands, they were supported by 13 Infantry brigades and an infantry division. In October 1961, new regional military commands were opened and leaving only two independent infantry brigades. In June 1963, the Naypyidaw Command was temporarily formed in [[Yangon]] with the deputy commander and some staff officers drawn from Central Command.  It was reorganised and renamed as Yangon Command on 1 June 1965.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \nA total of 337 infantry and light infantry battalions organised in Tactical Operations Commands, 37 independent field artillery regiments supported by affiliated support units including armoured [[reconnaissance]] and [[tank]] battalions.

It was renamed Bureau of Air Defence in the early 2000s (decade). In early 2000, Tatmadaw established Myanmar Integrated Air Defence System (MIADS) with help from Russia, [[Ukraine]] and China. It is a tri-service bureau with units from all three branches of Myanmar Armed Forces. All Air Defence assets except [[Anti-Aircraft Artillery]] within Tatmadaw arsenal are integrated into MIADS. AAA guns are mostly unguided and deploy to use in barrage-style firing against attacking aircraft. MIADS is directly answerable to Bureau of Air Defence under Ministry of Defence.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \nIn 2010, Myanmar Air Defence Command has completed installation of optical fibre communication network throughout the country. Those network are to be used for Air defence operations between Central Command HQ from capital & several air bases, early warning radar stations & mobile anti air craft missile & artillery units. After completion of fibre optic project & radar stations, MIADS (Myanmar Integrated Air Defence System) becomes the most advance AD system in the region.\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Each SOC transmitted data back to Intercept Operations Centers (IOC), which in turn controlled [[surface-to-air missile]] batteries and [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]/[[Interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] squadrons at various Air Bases. Each IOC was optimised to direct either SAMs or fighter/interceptor aircraft against incoming enemy aircraft or missile. Each IOC was connected to observer and early warning area reporting posts (RP) via military owned underground fibre optic cable network. There were about 100 [[radar|radar stations]] located at approximately 40 sites throughout the country. New Air Defence radars such as 1L117 radars, Galaxy Early Warning Radar and P series radars are installed in all radar stations.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \nEach Sector Operation Center (SOC) is commanded by a major general and it consists of one air defence division from Myanmar Army and one fighter-interceptor wing from [[Myanmar Air Force]]. Sometimes Air Defence [[Frigate]]s from Myanmar Navy also operate under the direct command of respective SOC.\n \nEach Air Defence division is commanded by a brigadier general and consists of three Air Defence Tactical Operations Command (TOC) and support units. One Medium Range Surface to Air Missile Tactical Operations Command (MRSAM-TOC), with three battalions equipped with [[Buk missile system|Buk M-1]] or [[2K12 Kub|Kub]] missile system is deployed in an Area Defence Belt role. One Short Range Air Defence Tactical Operations Command (SHORAD-TOC), with three battalions equipped with [[Tor M-1]] missile system is deployed in a Point Defence role for critical areas such as radar stations, fighter bases and SOC headquarters. One Electronic Reconnaissance Tactical Operations Command (EIR-TOC) with 6 to 8 radar and communication companies for early warnings and interdiction detection.\n \nEach fighter-interceptor wing commanded by a [[brigadier general]] and is composed of three Fighter squadrons of either [[MiG-29]] and [[Chengdu J-7|F-7M Airguardi]]Interceptors (ten aircraft per squadron) and their ground base support units.<ref name=\"DSHMRI\"/>\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It consisted HQ Burma Signals, Burma Signal Training Squadron (BSTS) and Burma Signals Squadron.  HQ Burma Signals was located within War Office.  BSTS based in Pyain Oo Lwin was formed with Operating Cipher Training Troop, Dispacth Rider Training Troop, Lineman Training Troop, Radio Mechanic Training Troop and Regimental Signals Training Troop.  BSS, based in Mingalardon, had nince sections: Administration Troop, Maintenance Troop, Operating Troop, Cipher Troop, Lineman and Dispatch Rider Troop, NBSD Signals Troop, SBSD Signals Troop, Mobile Brigade Signals Toop and Arakan Signals Toop.  The then Chief of Signal Staff Officer (CSO) was Lieutenant Colonel Saw Aung Din.  BSTS and BSS were later renamed No. 1 Signal Battalion and No.1 Signal Training Battalion.  In 1952, the Infantry Divisional Signals Regiment was formed and later renamed to No. 2 Signal Battalion.  HQ Burma Signals was reorganised and became Directorate Signal and the director was elevated to the rank of Colonel.  In 1956, No. 1 Signal Security Battalion was formed, followed by No. 3 Signal Battalion in November 1958 and No.4 Signal Battalion in October 1959.\n \nIn 1961, signal battalions were reorganised as No. 11 Signal Battalion under North Eastern Regional Military Command, No. 121 Signal Battalion under Eastern Command, No. 313 Signal Battalion under Central Command, No.414 Signal Battalion under South Western Command, and No. 515 Signal Battalion under South Eastern Command.  No.1 Signal Training Battalion was renamed Burma Signal Training Depot (Baho-Setthweye-Tat).\n \nBy 1988, Directorate of Signals command one training depot, eight signal battalions, one signal security battalion, one signal store depot and two signal workshops.  Signal Corps under Directorate of Signal further expanded during 1990 expansion and reorganisation of Myanmar Armed Forces.  By 2000, a signal battalion is attached to each Regional Military Command and signal companies are now attached to Light Infantry Divisions and Military Operations Commands.\n \nIn 2000, [[C4ISTAR|Command, Control and Communication]] system of Myanmar Army has been substantially upgraded by setting up the military [[fibre optic]] communication network managed by Directorate of Signal throughout the country. Since 2002 all Myanmar Army Regional Military Command HQs used its own telecommunication system. [[Satellite communication|Satellite communication links]] are also provided to forward-deployed infantry battalions. However, battle field communication systems are still poor. Infantry units are still using TRA 906 and PRM 4051 which were acquired from UK in the 1980s. Myanmar Army also uses the locally built TRA 906 Thura and Chinese XD-D6M radio sets. Frequency hopping handsets are fitted to all front line units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burmanet.org/news/2010/08/13/jane%E2%80%99s-intelligence-review-radio-active-%E2%80%93-desmond-ball-and-samuel-blythe/|title=Burmanet \" Jane's Intelligence Review: Radio active \u2013 Desmond Ball and Samuel Blythe|accessdate=29 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206031853/http://www.burmanet.org/news/2010/08/13/jane%E2%80%99s-intelligence-review-radio-active-%E2%80%93-desmond-ball-and-samuel-blythe/#|archive-date=6 December 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n \nBetween 2000 and 2005, Myanmar army bought 50 units of Brett 2050 Advanced Tech radio set from Aussie through third party from Singapore.

Singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer [[Trent Reznor]] was the only permanent member of the band until the official addition of English musician [[Atticus Ross]] in 2016.\n\nReznor recorded the band's debut album, ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'' (1989), while working overnight as a janitor at a Cleveland recording studio. After feuding with the label [[TVT Records]] about promotion, Reznor signed with [[Interscope Records]] and released the EP [[Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)|''Broken'']] (1992). The following albums, ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'' (1994) and [[The Fragile (Nine Inch Nails album)|''The Fragile'']] (1999), were released to critical acclaim and commercial success.\n\nFollowing a hiatus, Nine Inch Nails resumed touring in 2005 and released their fourth album, ''[[With Teeth]]'' (2005). Following the release of [[Year Zero (album)|''Year Zero'']] (2007), Reznor left Interscope after a feud. Nine Inch Nails continued touring and independently released ''[[Ghosts I\u2013IV]]'' (2008) and [[The Slip (album)|''The Slip'']] (2008) before a second hiatus. Their eighth album, ''[[Hesitation Marks]]'' (2013), was followed by a trilogy consisting of the EPs ''[[Not the Actual Events]]'' (2016) and ''[[Add Violence]]'' (2017) and their ninth album ''[[Bad Witch]]'' (2018). In 2020, Nine Inch Nails released two further installments in the ''Ghosts'' series, ''[[Ghosts V: Together]]'' and ''[[Ghosts VI: Locusts]].''\n\nReznor and Ross typically assemble [[Nine Inch Nails live performances|a live band to perform with them]]. Not including sparodic band hiatuses, the band has varied over the decades, with the most recent lineup consisting of [[Robin Finck]] (initially joined in 1994), [[Alessandro Cortini]] (initially joined in 2005), and [[Ilan Rubin]] (initially joined in 2009). Nine Inch Nails concerts since 2005 often employ thematic visual elements, extensive use of special effects, and elaborate light shows; songs are often rearranged for performance, and elements of songs that are not scheduled to be performed in their entirety are occasionally assimilated into other songs.\n\nNine Inch Nails have sold over 20 million records and have been nominated for 13 [[Grammy Award]]s, winning for the songs [[Wish (Nine Inch Nails song)|\"Wish\"]] (1992) and \"[[Happiness in Slavery]]\" (1996). In 1997, [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] named Reznor one of the most influential people, and ''Spin'' has described him as \"the most vital artist in music\". In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed Nine Inch Nails at No. 94 on [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time]]. They were nominated for induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2014 (their first year of eligibility), nominated again in 2015, and are scheduled for induction in 2020.\n\n==History==\n===Formation (1988\u20131989)===\n[[File:Nine Inch Nails logo.svg|thumb|right|alt=The letters N, I, and a backwards N set in a strong typeface within a simple black border.|The band's logo, designed by Reznor and [[Gary Talpas]]]]\n\nIn 1987 in [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]], [[Trent Reznor]] played keyboards in the [[Exotic Birds]], a [[synthpop]] band managed by [[John Malm Jr.]]<ref name=\"NIN Spin 1996\">{{Cite magazine|last=Weisbard|first=Eric|date=February 1996|title=Sympathy for the Devil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=td2yO_T3DPEC&pg=PA34|publisher=Spin Media LLC|volume=11|issue=11|pages=34\u201342, 96|issn=0886-3032|accessdate=August 27, 2018|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|via=Google Books}}</ref>{{rp|38}} Reznor became friends with Malm,{{sfn|Huxley|1997|p=33}} who informally became his manager when he left to work on his own music.<ref>''Reznor v.

As Reznor explains in an interview with ''Convulsion Magazine'':\n\n<blockquote>There was a scene w[h]ere I was lying on the ground, appearing to be dead, in a ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]''-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it&nbsp;... the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere&nbsp;... the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.'

Reznor objected to the label's attempted interference with his intellectual property.<ref name = \"Shock\" /> Ultimately, Nine Inch Nails entered into a joint venture with Interscope Records in which Reznor forfeited a portion of his publishing rights to TVT Music in exchange for the freedom of having his own [[Nothing Records]] imprint.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|pp=81\u201382}} In 2005, Reznor sued his former friend and manager John Malm, co-founder of Nothing, for fraud, breach of contract and fiduciary duty, and other claims.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Court Holds Reznor/Malm Contract Not Unconscionable|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1413034/court-holds-reznormalm-contract-not-unconscionable|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=February 4, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613005155/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1413034/court-holds-reznormalm-contract-not-unconscionable|archivedate=June 13, 2015}}</ref> Their relationship was formally severed in a New York courtroom, with damages awarded to Reznor in excess of $3 million.<ref name = \"E!

Singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer [[Trent Reznor]] was the only permanent member of the band until the official addition of English musician [[Atticus Ross]] in 2016.\n\nReznor recorded the band's debut album, ''[[Pretty Hate Machine]]'' (1989), while working overnight as a janitor at a Cleveland recording studio. After feuding with the label [[TVT Records]] about promotion, Reznor signed with [[Interscope Records]] and released the EP [[Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)|''Broken'']] (1992). The following albums, ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'' (1994) and [[The Fragile (Nine Inch Nails album)|''The Fragile'']] (1999), were released to critical acclaim and commercial success.\n\nFollowing a hiatus, Nine Inch Nails resumed touring in 2005 and released their fourth album, ''[[With Teeth]]'' (2005). Following the release of [[Year Zero (album)|''Year Zero'']] (2007), Reznor left Interscope after a feud. Nine Inch Nails continued touring and independently released ''[[Ghosts I\u2013IV]]'' (2008) and [[The Slip (album)|''The Slip'']] (2008) before a second hiatus. Their eighth album, ''[[Hesitation Marks]]'' (2013), was followed by a trilogy consisting of the EPs ''[[Not the Actual Events]]'' (2016) and ''[[Add Violence]]'' (2017) and their ninth album ''[[Bad Witch]]'' (2018). In 2020, Nine Inch Nails released two further installments in the ''Ghosts'' series, ''[[Ghosts V: Together]]'' and ''[[Ghosts VI: Locusts]].''\n\nReznor and Ross typically assemble [[Nine Inch Nails live performances|a live band to perform with them]]. Not including sparodic band hiatuses, the band has varied over the decades, with the most recent lineup consisting of [[Robin Finck]] (initially joined in 1994), [[Alessandro Cortini]] (initially joined in 2005), and [[Ilan Rubin]] (initially joined in 2009). Nine Inch Nails concerts since 2005 often employ thematic visual elements, extensive use of special effects, and elaborate light shows; songs are often rearranged for performance, and elements of songs that are not scheduled to be performed in their entirety are occasionally assimilated into other songs.\n\nNine Inch Nails have sold over 20 million records and have been nominated for 13 [[Grammy Award]]s, winning for the songs [[Wish (Nine Inch Nails song)|\"Wish\"]] (1992) and \"[[Happiness in Slavery]]\" (1996). In 1997, [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] named Reznor one of the most influential people, and ''Spin'' has described him as \"the most vital artist in music\". In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed Nine Inch Nails at No. 94 on [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time]]. They were nominated for induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2014 (their first year of eligibility), nominated again in 2015, and are scheduled for induction in 2020.\n\n==History==\n===Formation (1988\u20131989)===\n[[File:Nine Inch Nails logo.svg|thumb|right|alt=The letters N, I, and a backwards N set in a strong typeface within a simple black border.|The band's logo, designed by Reznor and [[Gary Talpas]]]]\n\nIn 1987 in [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]], [[Trent Reznor]] played keyboards in the [[Exotic Birds]], a [[synthpop]] band managed by [[John Malm Jr.]]<ref name=\"NIN Spin 1996\">{{Cite magazine|last=Weisbard|first=Eric|date=February 1996|title=Sympathy for the Devil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=td2yO_T3DPEC&pg=PA34|publisher=Spin Media LLC|volume=11|issue=11|pages=34\u201342, 96|issn=0886-3032|accessdate=August 27, 2018|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|via=Google Books}}</ref>{{rp|38}} Reznor became friends with Malm,{{sfn|Huxley|1997|p=33}} who informally became his manager when he left to work on his own music.<ref>''Reznor v.

The original version of the \"Down in It\" video ended with the implication that Reznor's character had fallen off a building and died in the street.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|pp=47\u201348}} This footage attracted the attention of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. As Reznor explains in an interview with ''Convulsion Magazine'':\n\n<blockquote>There was a scene w[h]ere I was lying on the ground, appearing to be dead, in a ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]''-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it&nbsp;... the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere&nbsp;... the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.'

Reznor objected to the label's attempted interference with his intellectual property.<ref name = \"Shock\" /> Ultimately, Nine Inch Nails entered into a joint venture with Interscope Records in which Reznor forfeited a portion of his publishing rights to TVT Music in exchange for the freedom of having his own [[Nothing Records]] imprint.{{sfn|Huxley|1997|pp=81\u201382}} In 2005, Reznor sued his former friend and manager John Malm, co-founder of Nothing, for fraud, breach of contract and fiduciary duty, and other claims.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Court Holds Reznor/Malm Contract Not Unconscionable|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1413034/court-holds-reznormalm-contract-not-unconscionable|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=February 4, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613005155/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1413034/court-holds-reznormalm-contract-not-unconscionable|archivedate=June 13, 2015}}</ref> Their relationship was formally severed in a New York courtroom, with damages awarded to Reznor in excess of $3 million.<ref name = \"E!

The album followed the critically acclaimed compilation of their first three [[Extended play|EPs]] titled ''[[The Three E.P.'s]]'' (1998). With high anticipation for ''The Beta Band'', the band originally planned to record the album in four separate continents, but financial constraints slimmed the recording locations down; however, the album was still recorded in a variety of locations. The band approached creating the songs in a variety of ways, sometimes forming songs from single melodies, sometimes bringing together other strands of music, among other forms.\n\nThe album builds upon the experimental nature of their EPs, and is often seen as a particularly intricate, experimental and layered album, with a variety of different influences, sound effects, instrumentation and song structures. Based more-so around beat and rhythm than prior releases, the numerous different styles and influences incorporated into ''The Beta Band'' include [[psychedelia]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[blues music|blues]]. Vocalist [[Steve Mason (musician)|Steve Mason]] described his lyrics as fitting but without narrative interests. The band also recorded an [[ambient music|ambient]] bonus disc of two long compositions, but decided not to include the disc in the final release.\n\nUpon its release, the band made their dissatisfaction with the album public, infamously calling it \"fucking awful,\"<ref name=\"on-second\">{{cite web |url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_second_thought/the-beta-band-the-beta-band.htm |title=The Beta Band \u2013 The Beta Band \u2013 On Second Thought |work=[[Stylus Magazine]] |date=22 November 2005 |accessdate=8 November 2010 |last=Miller |first=Derek |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206104210/http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_second_thought/the-beta-band-the-beta-band.htm |archivedate=6 February 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> largely blaming time constraints. Upon its release, it reached number 18 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Critics were favourable towards the album, although many found the album particularly messy and disappointing after the EPs. In later years however, several critics have found the album to be underrated and have praised its ambitions.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1997 and 1998, Scottish-based The Beta Band recorded their first releases, three EPs, ''[[Champion Versions]]'', ''[[The Patty Patty Sound]]'' and ''[[Los Amigos del Beta Bandidos]]'', which were met with high critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web |last=Strong |first=Martin C. |authorlink=Martin C.

Robin Jones stated \"We never really had a master plan ... after we did a song, we turned around and tried to do exactly the opposite. The most exciting songs were the ones where we were making something out of nothing.\"<ref name=\"great-scots\">{{cite web|last1=Perry|first1=Jonathan|title=Great Scots, It's the Beta Band!|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/great-scots-its-the-beta-band-19990613|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=13 June 1999|accessdate=6 February 2017}}</ref> Describing his lyrics for the record, vocalist Steve Mason explained he typically just followed \"the rhythms of the songs, more like a percussionist,\" and mentioned that the songs \"don't really tell a story. It's just words that go in there. They mean something, but they don't mean\u2026anything.\"<ref name=\"Vanderloo\" /> Despite some critics believing some of the tracks to be pastiches, the band explained to writer Lydia Vanderloo that they were not \"really into pastiche or irony or anything,\" with Maclean commenting, \"Everything's very serious and honest, hopefully. We're not so scared that we hide behind the irony that a lot of folks seem to hide behind these days.\"<ref name=\"Vanderloo\" /> Mason later explained to Hedrickson about the creation of the songs:\n{{quote|\"Each song starts differently, really. Some times it's a sample or a drum beat. Sometimes it's lyrics or a melody or something like that. It's different every time. [...] 'The Hard One' is a good example because we did something in a way we've never tried before. We don't really have songs where its verse and chorus, but the song has two verses and two choruses. Just to make it a bit more interesting we split everything up. We treated each section like a separate song. So the first verse was like one song. The second verse wasn't a copy at all and we tried to treat the choruses that way as well. Then we combined the songs together to make one song.\"<ref name=\"Hendrickson\" />}}\n\n[[File:Chris Allison.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Chris Allison]] co-produced ''The Beta Band''.]]\nAccording to [[Steve Taylor (author)|Steve Taylor]] in ''The A to X of Alternative Music'', none of the songs were prepared before the band entered the studio, which is where they were \"determined to keep their manual looping techniques.\"<ref name=\"The A to X of Alternative Music\">{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Steve|title=The A to X of Alternative Music|date=27 September 2006|publisher=A&C Black|location=London|isbn=0826482171|page=32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPOsu8JOHO8C&pg=PA32&dq=the+beta+band+1999&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiCi5O3yvvRAhUFLcAKHUgQDFMQ6AEIMDAE#v=onepage&q=the%20beta%20band%201999&f=false}}</ref> The band's original intention for ''The Beta Band'' was for it to be a [[double album]] with each side of the LP recorded in a different continent, \"one in [[Tokyo]], one in [[Mexico]] and so on.\"<ref name=\"could-beta\"/> The band tried to plan this with their manager and Regal owner Miles Leonard, but ultimately Leonard dismissed the idea as impossible, \"it would have cost three-quarters of a million pounds or something and they would have lost the plot.\"<ref name=\"could-beta\"/>\n\nInstead, according to ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', the album was at least partly recorded in a small hut belonging to Maclean's grandfather in a remote northwest part of Scotland, where the group found themselves with no room to sleep as they filled the hut with an excessive amount of musical equipment and homemade instruments.<ref name=\"space-jam\">{{cite journal|last1=McLean|first1=Craig|title=Space Jammers|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=June 1999|volume=15|issue=6|pages=114|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xY9xO99TYMYC&pg=PA114&dq=spin+the+beta+band&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjZsp3qu_vRAhXEVhQKHW6hBPEQ6AEIHjAB#v=onepage&q=spin%20the%20beta%20band&f=false|accessdate=6 February 2017}}</ref> [[Sawmills Studio]], [[Rockfield Studios]] and Jacobs Studio were also recording locations for the album.<ref name=\"MojoCollection\" /> In a 1999 interview, Mclean clarified that separate sections of the albums were recorded in different places: \"Four songs here, four songs somewhere else.

Jones recalled: \"We liked some of what we recorded, but it's not really what we wanted it to be from start to finish. We felt the second part was lacking in direction.\"<ref name=\"great-scots\"/> Nonetheless, this decision came several weeks after the band's record label had already included the ambient disc with promotional copies of the album distributed to various people in the music industry.<ref name=\"great-scots\"/> Drummer Robin Jones felt the reason they dropped the disc was because they were rushed into constructing it in only four days, saying they intended it to be \"an ambient\u2026 sound-piece. It\u2019s really indulgent on our part, but I wanted to make it a musical story. In the same way ''[[Chill Out (KLF album)|Chill Out]]'' by [[The KLF]] is a story. So it sort of succeeds.

oddness retains its own peculiar allure.\"<ref name=\"regal-years\"/>\n\nDerek Miller of ''[[Stylus Magazine]]'' said that by the time the band split up in 2004, ''The Beta Band'' was widely considered to be \"unnecessarily difficult, a short side-step in the career of a remarkably talented band,\" but he felt the album had been long underrated and was due for re-evaluation, praising its unique sound and adding that it \"remains the broken-toothed step-child with a little bit of dander on the lip and a tangle of hair on its back, but Christ those eyes, so keen and full of mischief, forgive the ugly parts.\"<ref name=\"on-second\"/> ''Pitchfork'' founder Ryan Schreiber called ''The Beta Band'' \"the greatest acid-burnt full-length of the late 90s\", saying that although it \"took some getting used to, since half of its songs were, to put it gently, cracked,\" the \"densely layered electronic psychedelia\" songs proved the band as \"one of the few modern electronic-based bands capable of successfully splicing hundreds of self-created sources into huge, pastoral symphonies, grounded in both pop music and [[Salvador Dali|Dali]] [[surrealism]].\"<ref name=\"Schreiber\">{{cite

the official studio debut album of [[The Beta Band]], released in June 1999 by [[Regal Records (1914)|Regal Records]]. The album followed the critically acclaimed compilation of their first three [[Extended play|EPs]] titled ''[[The Three E.P.'s]]'' (1998). With high anticipation for ''The Beta Band'', the band originally planned to record the album in four separate continents, but financial constraints slimmed the recording locations down; however, the album was still recorded in a variety of locations. The band approached creating the songs in a variety of ways, sometimes forming songs from single melodies, sometimes bringing together other strands of music, among other forms.\n\nThe album builds upon the experimental nature of their EPs, and is often seen as a particularly intricate, experimental and layered album, with a variety of different influences, sound effects, instrumentation and song structures. Based more-so around beat and rhythm than prior releases, the numerous different styles and influences incorporated into ''The Beta Band'' include [[psychedelia]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[blues music|blues]]. Vocalist [[Steve Mason (musician)|Steve Mason]] described his lyrics as fitting but without narrative interests. The band also recorded an [[ambient music|ambient]] bonus disc of two long compositions, but decided not to include the disc in the final release.\n\nUpon its release, the band made their dissatisfaction with the album public, infamously calling it \"fucking awful,\"<ref name=\"on-second\">{{cite web |url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_second_thought/the-beta-band-the-beta-band.htm |title=The Beta Band \u2013 The Beta Band \u2013 On Second Thought |work=[[Stylus Magazine]] |date=22 November 2005 |accessdate=8 November 2010 |last=Miller |first=Derek |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206104210/http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/on_second_thought/the-beta-band-the-beta-band.htm |archivedate=6 February 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> largely blaming time constraints. Upon its release, it reached number 18 on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Critics were favourable towards the album, although many found the album particularly messy and disappointing after the EPs. In later years however, several critics have found the album to be underrated and have praised its ambitions.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1997 and 1998, Scottish-based The Beta Band recorded their first releases, three EPs, ''[[Champion Versions]]'', ''[[The Patty Patty Sound]]'' and ''[[Los Amigos del Beta Bandidos]]'', which were met with high critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web |last=Strong |first=Martin C. |authorlink=Martin C.

Robin Jones stated \"We never really had a master plan ... after we did a song, we turned around and tried to do exactly the opposite. The most exciting songs were the ones where we were making something out of nothing.\"<ref name=\"great-scots\">{{cite web|last1=Perry|first1=Jonathan|title=Great Scots, It's the Beta Band!|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/great-scots-its-the-beta-band-19990613|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=13 June 1999|accessdate=6 February 2017}}</ref> Describing his lyrics for the record, vocalist Steve Mason explained he typically just followed \"the rhythms of the songs, more like a percussionist,\" and mentioned that the songs \"don't really tell a story. It's just words that go in there. They mean something, but they don't mean\u2026anything.\"<ref name=\"Vanderloo\" /> Despite some critics believing some of the tracks to be pastiches, the band explained to writer Lydia Vanderloo that they were not \"really into pastiche or irony or anything,\" with Maclean commenting, \"Everything's very serious and honest, hopefully. We're not so scared that we hide behind the irony that a lot of folks seem to hide behind these days.\"<ref name=\"Vanderloo\" /> Mason later explained to Hedrickson about the creation of the songs:\n{{quote|\"Each song starts differently, really. Some times it's a sample or a drum beat. Sometimes it's lyrics or a melody or something like that. It's different every time. [...] 'The Hard One' is a good example because we did something in a way we've never tried before. We don't really have songs where its verse and chorus, but the song has two verses and two choruses. Just to make it a bit more interesting we split everything up. We treated each section like a separate song. So the first verse was like one song. The second verse wasn't a copy at all and we tried to treat the choruses that way as well. Then we combined the songs together to make one song.\"<ref name=\"Hendrickson\" />}}\n\n[[File:Chris Allison.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Chris Allison]] co-produced ''The Beta Band''.]]\nAccording to [[Steve Taylor (author)|Steve Taylor]] in ''The A to X of Alternative Music'', none of the songs were prepared before the band entered the studio, which is where they were \"determined to keep their manual looping techniques.\"<ref name=\"The A to X of Alternative Music\">{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Steve|title=The A to X of Alternative Music|date=27 September 2006|publisher=A&C Black|location=London|isbn=0826482171|page=32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KPOsu8JOHO8C&pg=PA32&dq=the+beta+band+1999&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiCi5O3yvvRAhUFLcAKHUgQDFMQ6AEIMDAE#v=onepage&q=the%20beta%20band%201999&f=false}}</ref> The band's original intention for ''The Beta Band'' was for it to be a [[double album]] with each side of the LP recorded in a different continent, \"one in [[Tokyo]], one in [[Mexico]] and so on.\"<ref name=\"could-beta\"/> The band tried to plan this with their manager and Regal owner Miles Leonard, but ultimately Leonard dismissed the idea as impossible, \"it would have cost three-quarters of a million pounds or something and they would have lost the plot.\"<ref name=\"could-beta\"/>\n\nInstead, according to ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', the album was at least partly recorded in a small hut belonging to Maclean's grandfather in a remote northwest part of Scotland, where the group found themselves with no room to sleep as they filled the hut with an excessive amount of musical equipment and homemade instruments.<ref name=\"space-jam\">{{cite journal|last1=McLean|first1=Craig|title=Space Jammers|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=June 1999|volume=15|issue=6|pages=114|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xY9xO99TYMYC&pg=PA114&dq=spin+the+beta+band&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjZsp3qu_vRAhXEVhQKHW6hBPEQ6AEIHjAB#v=onepage&q=spin%20the%20beta%20band&f=false|accessdate=6 February 2017}}</ref> [[Sawmills Studio]], [[Rockfield Studios]] and Jacobs Studio were also recording locations for the album.<ref name=\"MojoCollection\" /> In a 1999 interview, Mclean clarified that separate sections of the albums were recorded in different places: \"Four songs here, four songs somewhere else.

Beta Band'' as the group's most notorious release and felt it was the last known example of a \"group this strange\" signing to a major label and then using their new label to make even stranger music, especially when considering the abandoned ambient bonus disc. \"If the record violently vascillates between fascinating and frustrating on a song-by-song basis,\" he said, \"its over-arching

considered to be \"unnecessarily difficult, a short side-step in the career of a remarkably talented band,\" but he felt the album had been long underrated and was due for re-evaluation, praising its unique sound and adding that it \"remains the broken-toothed step-child with a little bit of dander on the lip and a tangle of hair on its back, but Christ those eyes, so keen and full of mischief,

\"took some getting used to, since half of its songs were, to put it gently, cracked,\" the \"densely layered electronic psychedelia\" songs proved the band as \"one of the few modern electronic-based
