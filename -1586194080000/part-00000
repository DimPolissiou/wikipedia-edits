They meet after two decades, now Krishna ([[Prasanna (actor)|Prasanna]]) and Ramya ([[Laila Mehdin|Laila]]) during a college cultural meet and again lock horns with each other. Fate brings them together in Chennai after a few years, again fighting with each other. Meanwhile, a series of events forces Krishna's close friend  Aravindh ([[Karthik Kumar]]) to come to India from the USA to get married. His parents arrange his wedding with Ramya. Ramya, who decides to marry to help her younger sister's love, displays herself as a passive character who accepts whatever the life partner feel is right. On the contrary, she is bold, active, independent and assertive in nature. Knowing this, Krishna tries hard to let her true character come out. However, Aravindh stalls the wedding plans and returns to the USA as he finds Ramya as a person who does not think on her own and not independent. Mistaking Krishna for influencing Aravindh, Ramya locks horns with him.\n\nMeanwhile, Ramya's sister elopes with her lover which causes her mother ([[Revathy]]) to end up in hospital and Krishna comes to the help of the family and eventually develops an affinity for Ramya which turns into romance. Enters Aravindh now with a decision to marry Ramya. The climax was expected after the closeness between Ramya and Krishna. In the end, at the airport when they both come to receive Aravindh they end up in each other's arms and Aravindh also approves of it.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Prasanna (actor)|Prasanna]] as Krishna\n*[[Laila Mehdin|Laila]] as Ramya\n*[[Karthik Kumar]] as Aravind\n*[[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]] as Ramani\n*[[Revathi]] as Maragatham\n*[[Devadarshini]] as Krishna's sister\n*[[Regina Cassandra]] as Latha, Ramya's sister\n*Srinivasa Moorthy as Shankar\n*[[Jagan]]\n*[[Sudha Kongara]] as Ramya's professor (cameo)\n*[[Andrea Jeremiah]] in a cameo appearance\n*[[Premji Amaran]] in a special appearance\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Kanda Naal Mudhal\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = [[Yuvan Shankar Raja]]\n| cover        = Kanda Naal Mudhal1.jpg\n| alt          = \n| released     = 17 October 2005\n| recorded     = 2005\n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = [[Film soundtrack|Feature film soundtrack]]\n| length       = 32:42\n| language     = [[Tamil language|Tamil]]\n| label        = Star Music\n| producer     = [[Yuvan Shankar Raja]]\n| prev_title   = [[Oru Kalluriyin Kathai]]\n| prev_year    = 2005\n| next_title   = [[Sandakozhi]]\n| next_year    = 2005\n}}\n\nThe soundtrack composed by [[Yuvan Shankar Raja]], features 6 tracks with lyrics written by [[Thamarai]].

Priya]], who had earlier assisted [[Mani Ratnam]]. Produced by [[Prakash Raj]] under the Duet Films banner, the film stars [[Prasanna (actor)|Prasanna]], [[Laila Mehdin|Laila]] and [[Karthik Kumar]] in the lead roles and [[Revathi Menon]], and [[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]] all play in other roles. The film's music was composed by [[Yuvan Shankar Raja]]. The film released on 18 November 2005 became a super hit in most areas raising business for the lead actors.\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie begins with two kids who fight with each other in a marriage hall. They meet after two decades, now Krishna ([[Prasanna (actor)|Prasanna]]) and Ramya ([[Laila Mehdin|Laila]]) during a college cultural meet and again lock horns with each other. Fate brings them together in Chennai after a few years, again fighting with each other. Meanwhile, a series of events forces Krishna's close friend  Aravindh ([[Karthik Kumar]]) to come to India from the USA to get married. His parents arrange his wedding with Ramya. Ramya, who decides to marry to help her younger sister's love, displays herself as a passive character who accepts whatever the life partner feel is right. On the contrary, she is bold, active, independent and assertive in nature. Knowing this, Krishna tries hard to let her true character come out. However, Aravindh stalls the wedding plans and returns to the USA as he finds Ramya as a person who does not think on her own and not independent. Mistaking Krishna for influencing Aravindh, Ramya locks horns with him.\n\nMeanwhile, Ramya's sister elopes with her lover which causes her mother ([[Revathy]]) to end up in hospital and Krishna comes to the help of the family and eventually develops an affinity for Ramya which turns into romance. Enters Aravindh now with a decision to marry Ramya. The climax was expected after the closeness between Ramya and Krishna. In the end, at the airport when they both come to receive Aravindh they end up in each other's arms and Aravindh also approves of it.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Prasanna (actor)|Prasanna]] as Krishna\n*[[Laila Mehdin|Laila]] as Ramya\n*[[Karthik Kumar]] as Aravind\n*[[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]] as Ramani\n*[[Revathi]] as Maragatham\n*[[Devadarshini]] as Krishna's sister\n*[[Regina Cassandra]] as Latha, Ramya's sister\n*Srinivasa Moorthy as Shankar\n*[[Jagan]]\n*[[Sudha Kongara]] as Ramya's professor (cameo)\n*[[Andrea Jeremiah]] in a cameo appearance\n*[[Premji Amaran]] in a special appearance\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Kanda Naal Mudhal\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = [[Yuvan Shankar Raja]]\n| cover        = Kanda Naal Mudhal1.jpg\n| alt          = \n| released     = 17 October 2005\n| recorded     = 2005\n| venue        = \n| studio       = \n| genre        = [[Film soundtrack|Feature film soundtrack]]\n| length       = 32:42\n| language     = [[Tamil language|Tamil]]\n| label        = Star Music\n| producer     = [[Yuvan Shankar Raja]]\n| prev_title   = [[Oru Kalluriyin Kathai]]\n| prev_year    = 2005\n| next_title   = [[Sandakozhi]]\n| next_year    = 2005\n}}\n\nThe soundtrack composed by [[Yuvan Shankar Raja]], features 6 tracks with lyrics written by [[Thamarai]].

Both teams possessed .670&nbsp;records and asserted to be the rightful pennant winners. At the league's annual winter meeting that December, nearly four months later, Nashville was declared the Southern League champion for 1895.\n\nThe team was [[manager (baseball)|managed]] by [[George Stallings]] and included other former and future [[Major League Baseball|major league]] players [[Frank Butler (outfielder)|Frank Butler]], [[Art Herman]], [[Lefty Marr]], [[Tom McCreery]], [[Sam Moran (baseball)|Sam Moran]], [[Bert Myers]], [[Jim Ritz]], and [[Mike Trost]].

They were located in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and played their home games at [[Athletic Park (Nashville)|Athletic Park]], later known as Sulphur Dell. The club won the Southern League pennant in their only season, becoming the city's first minor league baseball team to win a league championship.\n\nThe Nashvilles spent the majority of the season at or near the top of the league standings and held an above-.500 [[winning percentage]] on all but Opening Day. From August 15 to the season finale on September 3, the Seraphs won 20&nbsp;consecutive games, which propelled them from seven games out of first place to a tie with the [[Atlanta Crackers]] atop the standings. Both teams possessed .670&nbsp;records and asserted to be the rightful pennant winners. At the league's annual winter meeting that December, nearly four months later, Nashville was declared the Southern League champion for 1895.\n\nThe team was [[manager (baseball)|managed]] by [[George Stallings]] and included other former and future [[Major League Baseball|major league]] players [[Frank Butler (outfielder)|Frank Butler]], [[Art Herman]], [[Lefty Marr]], [[Tom McCreery]], [[Sam Moran (baseball)|Sam Moran]], [[Bert Myers]], [[Jim Ritz]], and [[Mike Trost]]. Butler and Moran were sold to the [[History of the New York Giants (baseball)|New York Giants]] and [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], respectively, during the season. Stallings and Moran, as well as George Cleve, played for the [[Nashville Tigers]], the city's previous club, in 1894. Marr also played for the [[Nashville Americans]], the city's first team, in 1885 and 1886.\n\n== History ==\n=== Formation ===\n\n[[File:ReadHouseChattanooga.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|A [[Southern

[[Allmusic]] concluded, \"''The native of Chester, PA (near Philadelphia) was 25 at the time, but this is such a mature, emotionally honest effort that one got the impression he'd done more living than usual during his 25 years. Ryan's voice is rough and has a very lived-in quality that proves most appropriate on such tales of loss, disappointment, and hurt as \"Watch Your Step,\" \"Chrome,\" and \"Lights of the Commodore Barry.\" There isn't a lot of hope or optimism here; Ryan obviously didn't hesitate to let some of his darker feelings flow when he went into the studio to record this album, which is as pessimistic as it is soulful, moving and personal.''\"<ref name=\"AllMusicBiography2\">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/may-day-mw0000027686 | title=AllMusic Review by Alex Henderson | publisher=[[All Music]] | accessdate=July 19, 2015 | author=Henderson, Alex}}</ref> A video was made for \"Guilty\".

Using [[Socio-Economic Panel|SOEP]] data, Dustmann finds that immigrants' duration of stay in [[Germany]], i.e. whether or not they immigrate permanently, affects the convergence of natives' and immigrants' earnings as permanent immigrants' tend to invest more into country-specific [[human capital]] and, under certain circumstances, immigrants with higher ability are more likely to immigrate permanently.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/jopoec/v6y1993i2p153-68.html Dustmann, C. (1993). Earnings Adjustment of Temporary Migrants. ''Journal of Population Economics'', 6(2), pp. 153-168.]</ref> As a consequence, Dustmann argues that governments need to clarify as early as possible whether permanent immigration is possible and under which conditions.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1344525?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Dustmann, C., Bentolila, S., Faini, R. (1996). Return migration: The European experience. ''Economic Policy'', 11(22), 213-250].</ref> In further work (partly with Oliver Kirchkamp), Dustmann finds that return migration is affected by the relative volatility of labour markets in host and home countries and migrants' precautionary savings,<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v52y1997i2p295-316.html Dustmann, C.

(2003). Return migration, wage differentials, and the optimal migration duration. ''European Economic Review'', 47(2), pp. 353-369.]</ref> Moreover, he and Kirchkamp observe that the majority of returnees from Germany to Turkey among [[Turkish Guest Workers]] remained economically active, typically as entrepreneurs.<ref name=\"ideas.repec.org\"/> With regard to the [[United Kingdom|UK]], Dustmann and [[Yoram Weiss]] explore how price differentials between the UK and migrants' home countries, migrants' preference to live in their home countries, and better opportunities to accumulate valuable human capital in the UK determine return migration.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/brjirl/v45y2007i2p236-256.html Dustmann, C., Weiss, Y. (2007). Return Migration: Theory and Empirical Evidence from the UK. ''British Journal of Industrial Relations'', 45(2), pp. 236-256.]</ref> Moreover, in research with Josep Mestres, Dustmann finds that changes in return plans are related to large changes in immigrants' remittances to their home countries.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v92y2010i1p62-70.html Dustmann, C., Mestres, J. (2010). Remittances and return migration. ''Journal of Development Economics'', 92(1), pp. 62-70.]</ref> Finally, along with Itzhak Fadlon, Weiss and Dustmann use a [[Roy model]] to explore the effect of return migration and skill-specific human capital accumulation on the [[brain drain]] in migrants' home countries, which may instead experience a \"brain gain\" if enough emigrants return after having strongly improved their skills abroad.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v95y2011i1p58-67.html Dustmann, C., Fadlon, I., Weiss, Y. (2011). Return migration, human capital accumulation, and the brain drain. ''Journal of Development Economics'', 95(1), pp. 58-67.]</ref>\n\n==== The effect of immigrants' host country language skills====\n\nA second major area of research in Dustmann's work on migration relates to the effect of immigrants' host country language proficiency. Among else, he finds that fluency in German among immigrants increases in education, is lower for the elderly and women, and is only improved by labour market participation in the case of speaking. He also finds that immigrants' fluency in both speaking and especially writing German is associated with higher earnings.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/jopoec/v7y1994i2p133-56.html Dustmann, C. (1994). Speaking Fluency, Writing Fluency and Earnings of Migrants. ''Journal of Population Economics'', 7(2), pp. 133-156.]</ref> In another study, Dustmann observes that immigrants' acquisition of speaking and writing fluency is mostly driven by their parents' education level, whereas living in areas with high concentrations of immigrants has only a moderately negative effect.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/quaeco/v37y1997isupplement1p245-262.html Dustmann, C. (1997). The effects of education, parental background and ethnic concentration on language. ''Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance'', 37(Supplement), pp. 245-262.]</ref> Furthermore, migrants' investments into language proficiency are shown to depend on whether migrants' intend to immigrate permanently or temporarily.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/scandj/v101y1999i2p297-314.html Dustmann, C. (1999). Temporary Migration, Human Capital, and Language Fluency of Migrants. ''Scandinavian Journal of Economics'', 101(2), pp. 297-314.]</ref> In work with [[Arthur van Soest]], Dustmann finds that the effect of language proficiency on immigrants' earnings was likely underestimated by earlier studies as the downward bias due to measurement errors in subjective language proficiency dominates the upward bias due to heterogeneity in terms of unobserved ability.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/restat/v83y2001i4p663-674.html Dustmann, C., van Soest, A. (2001). Language Fluency and Earnings: Estimation with Misclassified Language Indicators.

Language and the Earnings of Immigrants. ''ILR Review'', 55(3), pp. 473-492.]</ref> Finally, together with Francesca Fabbri, Dustmann documents that language acquisition and labour market performance vary widely across non-white immigrants in the UK based on their ethnic origins and that English proficiency significantly increases immigrants' likelihood of employment and earnings.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ecj/econjl/v113y2003i489p695-717.html Dustmann, C., Fabbri, F. (2003). Language proficiency and labour market performance of immigrants in the UK. ''Economic Journal'', 113(489), pp. 695-717.]</ref>\n\n==== Natives' attitudes towards immigration====\n\nTogether with [[Ian Preston]], Dustmann has analysed the attitudes of ethnic majorities towards [[ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]]. Among else, they find that earlier research in the UK likely overestimated the positive impact of local immigration on natives' attitudes towards immigrants because they omitted the tendency of xenophobic natives to move to locations with few migrants; instead, they find that, if anything, high concentrations of ethnic minorities likely exacerbated xenophobia in England.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ecj/econjl/v111y2001i470p353-73.html Dustmann, C., Preston, I. (2001). Attitudes to Ethnic Minorities, Ethnic Context and Location Decisions. ''Economic Journal'', 111(470), pp. 353-373.]</ref> With [[David Card]], they also find that xenophobic attitudes among European natives are mainly driven by concerns over how changes in the composition of the local population due to immigration may affect amenities from neighbourhoods, schools and workplaces, instead of concerns over wages and taxes, thus explaining why individuals with lower education tend to display more xenophobic attitudes, as they benefit relatively more from these public amenities than highly educated people.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jeurec/v10y2012i1p78-119.html Card, D., Dustmann, C., Preston, I. (2012). Immigration, Wages, and Compositional Amenities. ''Journal of the European Economic Association'', 10(1), pp. 78-119.]</ref> This dominance of welfare concerns over labour market concerns is also supported by earlier work on the UK, though racial and cultural prejudice also plays an important role there, if immigrants have a different ethnicity.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/bpj/bejeap/v7y2007i1n62.html Dustmann, C., Preston, I.P. (2007). Racial and Economic Factors in Attitudes to Immigration. ''B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis and Policy'', 7(1), pp. 1-41.]</ref>\n\n==== The effects of immigration on host countries and immigrants====\n\nA fourth area in Dustmann's research on migration studies the impact of immigration on domestic labour markets. Therein, together with Fabbri and Preston, Dustmann finds that while immigration in Britain ''overall'' doesn't appear to have an effect on British natives' employment, labour force participation, unemployment, and wages, immigration in fact likely decreased the employment of medium-skilled natives and increased that of high-skilled natives.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ecj/econjl/v115y2005i507pf324-f341.html Dustmann, C., Fabbri, F., Preston, I. (2005). The Impact of Immigration on the British Labour Market. ''Economic Journal'', 115(507), pp. 324-341.]</ref> In further work with [[Albrecht Glitz]] and [[Tommaso Frattini]], Dustmann studies how European countries' labour markets adjusted to recent immigration through changes in factor prices, output mix and production technology.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/oxford/v24y2008i3p478-495.html Dustmann, D., Glitz, A., Frattini, T. (2008). The labour market impact of immigration. ''Oxford Review of Economic Policy'', 24(3), pp. 478-495.]</ref> This research is further complemented by work with Glitz, [[Yann Algan]] and [[Alan Manning]] that compares the performance of first- and second-generation immigrants in [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in terms of education, earnings and employment,<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ecj/econjl/v120y2010i542pf4-f30.html Algan, Y. et al. (2010). The Economic Situation of First and Second-Generation Immigrants in France, Germany and the United Kingdom. ''Economic Journal'', 120(542), pp. 4-30.]</ref> as well as by research with Frattini and Gianandrea Lanzara which shows that even though second-generation immigrants tend to perform worse than natives in terms of education, immigration has a strongly positive on their education relative to that of their peers in their home country.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/ecpoli/v27y2012i69p143-185.html Dustmann, C., Frattini, T., Lanzara, G. (2012). Educational achievement of second-generation immigrants: an international comparison. ''Economic Policy'', 27(69), pp. 143-185.]</ref> More recently, Dustmann, Frattini and Caroline Halls have also analyzed the fiscal effects of immigration in the UK, finding that European immigrants in general and especially immigrants from post-2004 EU Member States have made consistently positive contributions to the UK's public finances between 1995 and 2011, though the opposite holds true for [[European Economic Area|non-EEA]] immigrants, in particular before 2000.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ifs/fistud/v31y2010i1p1-41.html Dustmann, C., Frattini, T., Halls, C.

''Economic Journal'', 124(580), pp. 593-643.]</ref> Finally, together with Frattini and Preston, Dustmann finds that immigrants' move to the UK generally results in a considerable downgrade of their position within the wage distribution, which then in turns depresses slightly wages among the bottom fifth of native workers but increases wages for the upper half.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/restud/v80y2013i1p145-173.html Dustmann, C., Frattini, T., Preston, I.P.

''Review of Economic Studies'', 80(1), pp. 145-173.]</ref>\n\n=== Other research in labour economics===\n\nIn parallel to his research on the economics of migration, Dustmann has also performed influential research on various other topics in labour economics, including wages, job benefits, education, and structural change:\n* Addressing the issue of [[endogeneity (econometrics)|endogeneity]] in education, experience and hours worked, Dustmann and van Soest find consistently positive private-public wage differentials in Germany;<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/eecrev/v42y1998i8p1417-1441.html Dustmann, C., van Soest, A.

Using [[Socio-Economic Panel|SOEP]] data, Dustmann finds that immigrants' duration of stay in [[Germany]], i.e. whether or not they immigrate permanently, affects the convergence of natives' and immigrants' earnings as permanent immigrants' tend to invest more into country-specific [[human capital]] and, under certain circumstances, immigrants with higher ability are more likely to immigrate permanently.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/jopoec/v6y1993i2p153-68.html Dustmann, C. (1993). Earnings Adjustment of Temporary Migrants. ''Journal of Population Economics'', 6(2), pp. 153-168.]</ref> As a consequence, Dustmann argues that governments need to clarify as early as possible whether permanent immigration is possible and under which conditions.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1344525?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Dustmann, C., Bentolila, S., Faini, R. (1996). Return migration: The European experience. ''Economic Policy'', 11(22), 213-250].</ref> In further work (partly with Oliver Kirchkamp), Dustmann finds that return migration is affected by the relative volatility of labour markets in host and home countries and migrants' precautionary savings,<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v52y1997i2p295-316.html Dustmann, C.

(2003). Return migration, wage differentials, and the optimal migration duration. ''European Economic Review'', 47(2), pp. 353-369.]</ref> Moreover, he and Kirchkamp observe that the majority of returnees from Germany to Turkey among [[Turkish Guest Workers]] remained economically active, typically as entrepreneurs.<ref name=\"ideas.repec.org\"/> With regard to the [[United Kingdom|UK]], Dustmann and [[Yoram Weiss]] explore how price differentials between the UK and migrants' home countries, migrants' preference to live in their home countries, and better opportunities to accumulate valuable human capital in the UK determine return migration.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/brjirl/v45y2007i2p236-256.html Dustmann, C., Weiss, Y. (2007). Return Migration: Theory and Empirical Evidence from the UK. ''British Journal of Industrial Relations'', 45(2), pp. 236-256.]</ref> Moreover, in research with Josep Mestres, Dustmann finds that changes in return plans are related to large changes in immigrants' remittances to their home countries.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/deveco/v92y2010i1p62-70.html Dustmann, C., Mestres, J. (2010). Remittances and return migration.

(2011). Return migration, human capital accumulation, and the brain drain. ''Journal of Development Economics'', 95(1), pp. 58-67.]</ref>\n\n==== The effect of immigrants' host country language skills====\n\nA second major area of research in Dustmann's work on migration relates to the effect of immigrants' host country language proficiency. Among else, he finds that fluency in German among immigrants increases in education, is lower for the elderly and women, and is only improved by labour market participation in the case of speaking. He also finds that immigrants' fluency in both speaking and especially writing German is associated with higher earnings.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/jopoec/v7y1994i2p133-56.html Dustmann, C. (1994). Speaking Fluency, Writing Fluency and Earnings of Migrants. ''Journal of Population Economics'', 7(2), pp. 133-156.]</ref> In another study, Dustmann observes that immigrants' acquisition of speaking and writing fluency is mostly driven by their parents' education level, whereas living in areas with high concentrations of immigrants has only a moderately negative effect.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/quaeco/v37y1997isupplement1p245-262.html Dustmann, C. (1997). The effects of education, parental background and ethnic concentration on language. ''Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance'', 37(Supplement), pp. 245-262.]</ref> Furthermore, migrants' investments into language proficiency are shown to depend on whether migrants' intend to immigrate permanently or temporarily.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/scandj/v101y1999i2p297-314.html Dustmann, C. (1999). Temporary Migration, Human Capital, and Language Fluency of Migrants. ''Scandinavian Journal of Economics'', 101(2), pp. 297-314.]</ref> In work with [[Arthur van Soest]], Dustmann finds that the effect of language proficiency on immigrants' earnings was likely underestimated by earlier studies as the downward bias due to measurement errors in subjective language proficiency dominates the upward bias due to heterogeneity in terms of unobserved ability.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/restat/v83y2001i4p663-674.html Dustmann, C., van Soest, A.

Language and the Earnings of Immigrants. ''ILR Review'', 55(3), pp. 473-492.]</ref> Finally, together with Francesca Fabbri, Dustmann documents that language acquisition and labour market performance vary widely across non-white immigrants in the UK based on their ethnic origins and that English proficiency significantly increases immigrants' likelihood of employment and earnings.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ecj/econjl/v113y2003i489p695-717.html Dustmann, C., Fabbri, F. (2003). Language proficiency and labour market performance of immigrants in the UK. ''Economic Journal'', 113(489), pp. 695-717.]</ref>\n\n==== Natives' attitudes towards immigration====\n\nTogether with [[Ian Preston]], Dustmann has analysed the attitudes of ethnic majorities towards [[ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]]. Among else, they find that earlier research in the UK likely overestimated the positive impact of local immigration on natives' attitudes towards immigrants because they omitted the tendency of xenophobic natives to move to locations with few migrants; instead, they find that, if anything, high concentrations of ethnic minorities likely exacerbated xenophobia in England.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ecj/econjl/v111y2001i470p353-73.html Dustmann, C., Preston, I. (2001). Attitudes to Ethnic Minorities, Ethnic Context and Location Decisions. ''Economic Journal'', 111(470), pp. 353-373.]</ref> With [[David Card]], they also find that xenophobic attitudes among European natives are mainly driven by concerns over how changes in the composition of the local population due to immigration may affect amenities from neighbourhoods, schools and workplaces, instead of concerns over wages and taxes, thus explaining why individuals with lower education tend to display more xenophobic attitudes, as they benefit relatively more from these public amenities than highly educated people.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jeurec/v10y2012i1p78-119.html Card, D., Dustmann, C., Preston, I. (2012). Immigration, Wages, and Compositional Amenities. ''Journal of the European Economic Association'', 10(1), pp. 78-119.]</ref> This dominance of welfare concerns over labour market concerns is also supported by earlier work on the UK, though racial and cultural prejudice also plays an important role there, if immigrants have a different ethnicity.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/bpj/bejeap/v7y2007i1n62.html Dustmann, C., Preston, I.P. (2007). Racial and Economic Factors in Attitudes to Immigration. ''B.E. Journal of Economic Analysis and Policy'', 7(1), pp. 1-41.]</ref>\n\n==== The effects of immigration on host countries and immigrants====\n\nA fourth area in Dustmann's research on migration studies the impact of immigration on domestic labour markets. Therein, together with Fabbri and Preston, Dustmann finds that while immigration in Britain ''overall'' doesn't appear to have an effect on British natives' employment, labour force participation, unemployment, and wages, immigration in fact likely decreased the employment of medium-skilled natives and increased that of high-skilled natives.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ecj/econjl/v115y2005i507pf324-f341.html Dustmann, C., Fabbri, F., Preston, I. (2005). The Impact of Immigration on the British Labour Market. ''Economic Journal'', 115(507), pp. 324-341.]</ref> In further work with [[Albrecht Glitz]] and [[Tommaso Frattini]], Dustmann studies how European countries' labour markets adjusted to recent immigration through changes in factor prices, output mix and production technology.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/oxford/v24y2008i3p478-495.html Dustmann, D., Glitz, A., Frattini, T. (2008). The labour market impact of immigration. ''Oxford Review of Economic Policy'', 24(3), pp. 478-495.]</ref> This research is further complemented by work with Glitz, [[Yann Algan]] and [[Alan Manning]] that compares the performance of first- and second-generation immigrants in [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in terms of education, earnings and employment,<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ecj/econjl/v120y2010i542pf4-f30.html Algan, Y. et al. (2010). The Economic Situation of First and Second-Generation Immigrants in France, Germany and the United Kingdom. ''Economic Journal'', 120(542), pp. 4-30.]</ref> as well as by research with Frattini and Gianandrea Lanzara which shows that even though second-generation immigrants tend to perform worse than natives in terms of education, immigration has a strongly positive on their education relative to that of their peers in their home country.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/ecpoli/v27y2012i69p143-185.html Dustmann, C., Frattini, T., Lanzara, G. (2012). Educational achievement of second-generation immigrants: an international comparison. ''Economic Policy'', 27(69), pp. 143-185.]</ref> More recently, Dustmann, Frattini and Caroline Halls have also analyzed the fiscal effects of immigration in the UK, finding that European immigrants in general and especially immigrants from post-2004 EU Member States have made consistently positive contributions to the UK's public finances between 1995 and 2011, though the opposite holds true for [[European Economic Area|non-EEA]] immigrants, in particular before 2000.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ifs/fistud/v31y2010i1p1-41.html Dustmann, C., Frattini, T., Halls, C.

''Economic Journal'', 124(580), pp. 593-643.]</ref> Finally, together with Frattini and Preston, Dustmann finds that immigrants' move to the UK generally results in a considerable downgrade of their position within the wage distribution, which then in turns depresses slightly wages among the bottom fifth of native workers but increases wages for the upper half.<ref>[https://ideas.repec.org/a/oup/restud/v80y2013i1p145-173.html Dustmann, C., Frattini, T., Preston, I.P.

In 1913, the provincial government appointed [[Frank Wesbrook]] as the university's first president, in anticipation of it opening in the near future. However, in 1914, the onset of [[World War I]] halted the construction at Point Grey. There would be no more construction for almost a decade.\n\nIn 1915, McGill University closed McGill University College. The provincial government changed the provincial university's name to the [[University of British Columbia]] and it opened to classes at the Fairview facilities recently vacated by McGill University. With the opening of UBC, Victoria College closed. A second Provincial Normal School was also opened in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] in 1915.  President Wesbrook died in 1918, and Leonard Klinck became UBC's second president.  UBC added the [[Nursing]] degree program in 1919.  This was the first such program in the [[British Empire]].  In 1920, the Anglican Theological College opened in downtown Vancouver.\n\nOn October 28, 1922, almost 1,200 students with floats, bands and banners marched through downtown Vancouver to the Point Grey campus. This was known as \"The Great Trek\". The students protested the inferior conditions and overcrowding of buildings at the Fairview campus. It also protested the still uncompleted construction at Point Grey. The student protest and [[News media|media]] attention spurred the government to provide funding to finish the construction and move UBC from Fairview to Point Grey.<ref name=\"Hives\"/>  The new Ryerson College took over the theological training curriculum at Columbian College in 1923. Columbian College continued to operate as a residential secondary school and general arts institution.  On September 22, 1925 the University of British Columbia opened its first classes at the new Point Grey campus.  This same year the Vancouver School of Art opened.  In 1927 Ryerson College (Methodists), Westminster Hall (Presbyterians) and the Congregationalists amalgamated to form the United Church seminary, named Union College.\n\n=== Mid 20th century (1930 \u2013 1961) ===\nThe [[Great Depression]] put a halt to any further plans for higher education. UBC came close to being shut down due to government cutbacks, but Professor [[Henry Angus]] helped prevent this.  In 1936, Columbian College was closed, yet in the same year; the [[Nanaimo]] Vocational School opens and starts providing vocational education.   The Extension Department (later called Continuing Studies) at UBC is established, enabling UBC to bring higher education to all parts of the province.\n\nWith the start of [[World War II]] in 1939, UBC's faculty, staff, and students dedicated themselves to the cause. In 1940, the [[Government of Canada]] established a military college in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[Royal Roads Military College]] to train officers for the [[Canadian Forces|Canada's armed forces]].\n\nAfter World War II, UBC's President [[Norman MacKenzie (politician)|Norman MacKenzie]] declared any returning veteran was guaranteed a space at UBC. As a result, student numbers tripled to over 9,000 by 1947 and UBC experienced a crunch in classroom space and a lack of faculty to teach the extra classes that were needed. In 1949, the Vancouver Vocational Institute opened.  By 1956, a new provincial Teacher Training Program was established at UBC, and the Victoria and Vancouver Normal Schools were closed.  In 1960, the British Columbia Vocational School opened under direct management of the provincial government.\n\n===MacDonald report and expansion of the public post-secondary system (1962 \u2013 1988)===\nIn 1962, John B. MacDonald recommended changes in the post-secondary system in British Columbia.<ref>[http://www.bccat.bc.ca/pubs/macdonaldreport.pdf ''Higher Education in British Columbia and a Plan for the Future'']</ref> A recommendation of the MacDonald report was the establishment of two-year community colleges offering programs in four fields of education: [[academic]] (university transfer); [[career]]/[[vocational education|technical]], to train students for specific employment with programs ranging in duration from a few weeks to two or more years; [[vocational]], offering short applied programs of a year or less; and adult basic education to prepare those without high school graduation for other post-secondary programs or for employment. The report marked the development of British Columbia's Post Secondary School System.  In the same year, King Edward Continuing Education Centre and the private Christian evangelical college, Trinity Junior College both open their doors.\n\nIn 1963, the provincial legislature passed an act to establish [[Simon Fraser University]]. The [[University of Victoria]] was established in 1963 and moved to the [[Gordon Head]] campus. Also, the legislature charted [[Notre Dame University College]] of [[Nelson, British Columbia|Nelson]] as a private, Catholic university.  The [[British Columbia Institute of Technology]] (BCIT) opened in 1964.  Simon Fraser University opened in 1965.  This same year saw the opening of the first college recommended by the MacDonald report; Vancouver City College. Vancouver City College was the first autonomous community college in BC, formed by amalgamating Vancouver Vocational Institute, Vancouver School of Art, and King Edward Continuing Education Centre.\n\nCommunity colleges around the province started opening between 1966 and 1975: [[Selkirk College]] opened in 1966 followed by [[Capilano College]], [[College of New Caledonia]], Okanagan Regional College, and Malaspina College in 1968.  [[Cariboo College]] and [[Douglas College]] were opened in 1970 followed by [[Camosun College]] in 1971, and East Kootenay Community College, [[North Island College]], [[Northern Lights College]], and Northwest Community College all opened in 1975.\n\nIn 1971, Union College and the Anglican Theological College joined to form the Vancouver School of Theology at UBC. Also in 1971, UBC became the first university in Canada to offer a program in Women's Studies for academic credit. Trinity Junior College was renamed Trinity Western College in 1972. The government established the Post-Secondary Articulation Coordinating Committee in 1974 to provide a means of determining whether post-secondary institutions could apply previous credit at another British Columbia institution toward completion of a program. This same year, Simon Fraser University (SFU) became the first university in Canada to have a female president with [[Pauline Jewett| Pauline Jewett's]] installment. Then in 1975, the provincial government passed the ''Royal Roads Military College Degrees Act'' enabling Royal Roads to grant degrees. In 1977, BCIT opened Sea Island Campus in [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]]<ref name=\"bcit.ca\">British Columbia Institute of Technology: About the Institute: History, (n.d) Retrieved June 25, 2008, from https://www.bcit.ca/about/history.shtml</ref> The year, 1978 saw the establishment of the Open Learning Institute, the Pacific Vocational Institute, the Justice Institute, the Pacific Marine Training Institute, and the [[Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design]] (ECIAD). In 1981, [[Kwantlen College]] formed as a separate institution from [[Douglas College]].  Then in 1983, the Nicola Valley Institute of Technology opened to address the low participation and success rates of First Nations students in higher education. 1984 saw the closure of the Notre Dame University of Nelson due to costs per student. In 1985, the Government of British Columbia supported a private member's bill that would change Trinity Western College to [[Trinity Western University]]. BCIT merged with the Pacific Vocational Institute in 1986.<ref name=\"bcit.ca\"/> In 1988, the [[Open Learning Agency]] was formed by combining the Open Learning Institute and the Knowledge Network.\n\n===Focus on transferability and the creation of university colleges (1989\u20132007)===\nThe [[British Columbia Council on Admissions and Transfer]] (BCCAT) was created in 1989 to address the concerns about mobility and transferability of program credit throughout British Columbia, especially with regards to university colleges and students wanting to transfer from their local colleges to provincial universities.  Between 1989 and 1995, four two-year community colleges became four-year degree-granting university-colleges:  [[University College of the Cariboo]], [[Malaspina University College]], [[University College of the Fraser Valley]], and [[Kwantlen University College]].  In 1993, [[Yukon College]] became a part of the BC credit transfer system.  This same year, Aboriginal peoples in British Columbia established Wilp Wilxo'oskwhl Nisga'a, a community driven, student focused aboriginal post-secondary institute.  In 1994, Vancouver Community College's Langara campus separated into an independent college, and it was renamed [[Langara College]].  Also in 1994, the [[University of Northern British Columbia]] opened, and the Pacific Marine Institute merged with BCIT.<ref name=\"bcit.ca\"/>  Two Aboriginal education institutes \u2014 the Nicola Valley Institute of Technology and the Institute of Indigenous Government \u2014 were designated as public post-secondary institutions in 1995.  That same year, the provincial government passed the ''College and Institute Act'' that provided university colleges, colleges, and institutes with authority to grant associate degrees, diplomas, and certificates.  Also, 1995 saw the closure of Royal Roads Military College; yet by 1996, [[Royal Roads University]] opened on the same campus.\n\nIn 1999, the Technical University of BC opened only to be shut down in 2002. Simon Fraser University assumed responsibility for the students and facilities of the former Technical University of BC and established its Surrey campus. Also in 2002, the Government of British Columbia passed the ''Degree Authorization Act'' that enabled private universities to grant BC degrees. The act also expanded degree-granting capacity for colleges (applied baccalaureates) and university-colleges and institutes (applied masters).\n\nThe University College of the Cariboo and the Open Learning Agency amalgamated in 2005 to become [[Thompson Rivers University]].  Also in 2005, Okanagan University College is split to become UBC's Okanagan campus and Okanagan College, and the British Columbia government approves new private degree programs at [[Sprott Shaw College]], [[University Canada West]], and Columbia Colleges. In 2006, Canada and British Columbia's first private sector, for-profit, university, University Canada West, opens in Victoria. Former University of Victoria president, [[David Strong]] is the first president of UCW.  A year later in 2007, Canada and British Columbia's first private, non-profit secular liberal arts and sciences university, [[Quest University Canada]], opens in [[Squamish, British Columbia|Squamish]]. Former UBC president, [[David Strangway]] is the first president of QUC.\n\n=== Creation of teaching universities (2008 \u2013 present) ===\nOn April 29, 2008, changes to the ''University Act'' established five new teaching universities: [[University of the Fraser Valley]] (formerly University College of the Fraser Valley), [[Kwantlen Polytechnic University]] (formerly Kwantlen College), [[Vancouver Island University]] (formerly Malaspina University College), [[Capilano University]] (formerly Capilano College), and [[Emily Carr University of Art and Design]] (formerly Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design).\n\n==Structure and Governance==\n[[File:University of Victoria, 29 sept 2007, 2.jpg|thumb|University of Victoria Engineering & Computer Science Building]]\n[[Image:Burnaby campus1.jpg|thumb|300px|Aerial view of Simon Fraser University at Burnaby, British Columbia]]\n\nThe provincial government is responsible for higher education in British Columbia. It enacts legislation regarding the establishment, management, and operation of post-secondary institutions. The government also provides leadership and support for post-secondary education.<ref name = \"nda\">British Columbia. Ministry of Advanced Education. (n.d.a). About the Ministry. Retrieved June 2, 2008, from http://www.aved.gov.bc.ca/organization/</ref>  As part of this support, the government manages the overall funding and program co-ordination for the public and private post-secondary education systems, as well as the provincial student financial aid programs for eligible students. In addition, it is responsible for intergovernmental issues, performance accountability, data management and analysis, and policy related to transitions within the post-secondary education system.\n\nTo maintain the quality and accreditation of higher education in British Columbia, the government passed legislation titled the ''Degree Authorization Act''<ref name='daa'>[http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/statreg/stat/D/02024_01.htm ''Degree Authorization Act''] (2002)</ref> that established criteria for when either a private or out-of-province public institution applies for consent to provide degree programs or use the word \"university\" in British Columbia, or new degree programs are proposed by British Columbia's current public post-secondary institutions.  A Degree Quality Assessment Board<ref>[http://www.aved.gov.bc.ca/degree-authorization/board/welcome.htm Degree Quality Assessment Board]</ref> established in 2002 works with the government on reviews and makes recommendations to the Minister on institution applications.\n\nHigher education institutions in British Columbia have particular mandates and serve specific community needs.  They are able to decide how to achieve their mandate and deal with the various levels of administrative details with regard to operations, faculty, staff, and students.\n\nResearch universities such as the [[University of British Columbia]] (Vancouver and Okanagan), [[University of Victoria]], [[Simon Fraser University]], and the [[University of Northern British Columbia]] operate under a [[bicameral]] structure  composed of a Board of Governors and a Senate.

The Council of Ministers of Education, Canada (CMEC), commissioned a report in 2002 that stated only 38% of Aboriginal students were found to finish high school, compared with 77% of non-Aboriginal students. The legacy of residential schools, of distrust or indifference to the school system, which is seen as antagonistic to their culture, and the lack of reflection of an Aboriginal perspective in the secondary system were all cited as factors in the poor performance and completion of Aboriginals in the secondary system which subsequently affects enrolment of Aboriginal peoples in post-secondary education.<ref name = \"CMEC-2002\">Council of Ministers of Education, Canada.

Globalization and modern technology has made it easier to obtain education in other countries, and governments are taking note when they consider their post-secondary student populations as a possible source of skilled workers to join the local economy.\n\nIn 1983, the BC Ministry of Advanced Education, Training and Technology established the International Education and Training Group (IETG), a forum for discussion between colleges, institutes and universities, and the ministries of Education and Advanced Education.  Five years later in 1988, the provincial government commissioned a study on international education issues.  The study reported that BC's institutions were uncoordinated in their internationalization efforts, were failing to present a professional image abroad, and that the province was not sufficiently proactive. In 1990, this led to the formation of the British Columbia Centre for International Education (BCCIE)\u2014the first such organization in Canada.\n\nThe total number of international students in British Columbia for the year of 2006 was 44,799, up from 23,011 in 1997.<ref>Canada.

There is no public subsidization, and international students pay a mostly full-tuition fee basis. Most international students obtain funding either through personal resources (e.g., family or savings), or obtain funding through the institution, such as entrance awards.  There are some government funds, but are usually open to nationals of developing countries only.   The [[Canadian Bureau for International Education]] lists some of those awards.<ref>http://www.destineducation.ca/intstdnt/awards_e.htm</ref>\n\nThe Off-Campus Work Permit Program for international students at public institutions was launched nationally as a formalized program on April 27, 2006. Prior to the introduction of this program, students were only allowed to work on the campus of the educational institution at which they were studying. Students who qualify for the program will be able to work up to 20 hours per week off-campus while classes are in session, full-time during summer and winter breaks, and over their reading weeks.\n\nIn April 2008, the Government of Canada's Minister of Citizenship and Immigration announced changes to work permits for international students who graduate from eligible programs at certain Canadian post-secondary institutions, making it easier to attract foreign students to Canada. For the first time, international students would be able to obtain an \"open work permit\" under the Post-Graduation Work Permit Program, with no restrictions on the type of employment and no requirement for a job offer. In addition, the duration of the work permit has been extended to three years across the country. Previously, the program only allowed international students to work for one or two years, depending on location. A minimum of one year of work experience  in managerial, professional or technical positions (i.e., at level 0, A or B under the National Occupational Classification system) will be necessary to apply to stay permanently through the Canadian Experience Class.<ref>Canada.

International students interested in studying in British Columbia can contact the international office at the institutions they are interested in.   In addition, the Government of Canada's Department of Citizenship and Immigration has information for international students about studying in Canada and applying for student visas.\n\n===Transferability of program credits===\n[[Image:Koerner-Lib-UBC.jpg|thumb|300px|Koerner Library at the University of British Columbia]]\n\nThe ability of students to transfer from one post-secondary institution to another without losing credit for coursework at a previous institution in British Columbia is enabled with the presence of the BC Council on Admissions and Transfer (BCCAT), a provincially funded agency that was created in 1989 to replace the Post-Secondary Articulation Coordinating Committee that had been established in 1974. BCCAT has a mandate to \"facilitate admission, articulation, and transfer arrangements among BC post-secondary institutions by encouraging them to develop policies and practices regarding the transferability of post-secondary credit courses so that credit granted at one institution can be applied toward credentials at other institutions.\" <ref>British Columbia Council on Admissions and Transfer.

For example, a college may deliver the first two years of an articulated degree program and a university may deliver the final two years and award the degree.  Private institutions have to be approved by the Degree Quality Assessment Board and have received the minister's consent to be accepted by BCCAT as a member of the BC Transfer System.  The BCCAT has a Private Degree-Granting Institutions Policy that outlines the requirements a private institution must comply with to be considered for membership in the agency.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of universities in Canada]]\n*[[List of colleges in Canada]]\n*[[List of business schools in Canada]]\n*[[List of law schools in Canada]]\n*[[List of Canadian universities by endowment]]\n*[[Higher education in Canada]]\n*[[List of colleges in British Columbia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bccampus.ca/ BCcampus]\n*[http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/reporting/glossary.php British Columbia Ministry of Education]\n*[http://www.educationplanner.bc.ca/glossary.cfm BC Council on Admissions and Transfer Education Planner]\n*[http://www.gov.bc.ca/almd/ BC Ministry of Advanced Education and Labour Market Development]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110706183830/http://www.isitt.ca/research/reports/higher-learning-and-the-labour-market-in-a-changing-world/ ''Higher Learning and the Labour Market in a Changing World: Environmental Scan for British Columbia'' (2008), by Benjamin Isitt]\n\n===Associations of higher education===\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080610094124/http://www.bccat.bc.ca/index.cfm British Columbia Council on Admissions and Transfer] (BCCAT)\n*[http://www.fpse.ca/ Federation of Post-Secondary Educators of BC]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080430202948/http://www.fnesc.bc.ca/iahla/ Indigenous Adult and Higher Learning Association]\n*[http://www.heitbc.ca/ HEITBC - Higher Education Information Technology BC]\n\n{{BC Uni}}\n{{Canada topic|Higher education in}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Higher Education In British Columbia}}\n[[Category:Education in British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Higher education in Canada|British Columbia]]\n", "text_old": "{{See also|List of colleges in British Columbia|List of universities in Canada#British Columbia}}\n{| border=\"0\" align=\"right\"\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | [[Image:British Columbia-map.png|thumb|1200px|center|Province of British Columbia]]\n|}\n\n'''Higher education in British Columbia''' is delivered by 25 publicly funded institutions that are composed of eleven [[universities]], eleven [[colleges]], and three [[institutes]].

In 1904 & 1905 McGill University received permission to improve and expand the University's course offerings in British Columbia. Two acts were passed to enable this; ''An Act Respecting McGill University,'' which gave McGill University permission to establish a University College in British Columbia for the higher education of [[men]] and [[women]], and ''An Act to Incorporate the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning of British Columbia,'' which established the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning of British Columbia. This institution would undertake the responsibility of establishing a college anywhere in British Columbia.<ref name = \"Humpries & Hunt\">Humphries, D., & Hunt, W. (1988).

In this same year, the provincial government made a second attempt to establish a provincial university. They succeeded with ''An Act to Establish and Incorporate a University for the Province of British Columbia''. It would be called the [[University of British Columbia]], and it would be located in the western part of [[Point Grey]]. However, plans to start construction on the campus for the new university had to be postponed due to lack of funding. Meanwhile, McGill University agreed to continue providing higher education through Victoria College.\n\n[[File:Craigdarroch ext 01.jpg|thumb|Former Home of the University of Victoria]]\n\nThe provincial government made amendments to the Public School Act in 1894 and 1896 to allow any Canadian university to affiliate with any of the [[high schools]] in British Columbia. The high schools could then be incorporated as colleges of these institutions. [[McGill University]] was the first to take advantage of this new amendment.<ref name = \"Hives\">Hives, C. (2006).

The high school curriculum was extended to include the first two years of Arts and part of the school become Vancouver College in 1899. McGill University controlled the curriculum, set and marked exams, and approved the hiring of instructors. Students were required to travel to McGill to complete their studies. The provincial government granted a lease for land at Point Grey to the Royal Institution.<ref name = \"Humpries & Hunt\"/> Construction started in 1911. In 1913, the provincial government appointed [[Frank Wesbrook]] as the university's first president, in anticipation of it opening in the near future. However, in 1914, the onset of [[World War I]] halted the construction at Point Grey. There would be no more construction for almost a decade.\n\nIn 1915, McGill University closed McGill University College. The provincial government changed the provincial university's name to the [[University of British Columbia]] and it opened to classes at the Fairview facilities recently vacated by McGill University. With the opening of UBC, Victoria College closed. A second Provincial Normal School was also opened in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] in 1915.  President Wesbrook died in 1918, and Leonard Klinck became UBC's second president.  UBC added the [[Nursing]] degree program in 1919.  This was the first such program in the [[British Empire]].  In 1920, the Anglican Theological College opened in downtown Vancouver.\n\nOn October 28, 1922, almost 1,200 students with floats, bands and banners marched through downtown Vancouver to the Point Grey campus. This was known as \"The Great Trek\". The students protested the inferior conditions and overcrowding of buildings at the Fairview campus. It also protested the still uncompleted construction at Point Grey. The student protest and [[News media|media]] attention spurred the government to provide funding to finish the construction and move UBC from Fairview to Point Grey.<ref name=\"Hives\"/>  The new Ryerson College took over the theological training curriculum at Columbian College in 1923. Columbian College continued to operate as a residential secondary school and general arts institution.  On September 22, 1925 the University of British Columbia opened its first classes at the new Point Grey campus.  This same year the Vancouver School of Art opened.  In 1927 Ryerson College (Methodists), Westminster Hall (Presbyterians) and the Congregationalists amalgamated to form the United Church seminary, named Union College.\n\n=== Mid 20th century (1930 \u2013 1961) ===\nThe [[Great Depression]] put a halt to any further plans for higher education. UBC came close to being shut down due to government cutbacks, but Professor [[Henry Angus]] helped prevent this.  In 1936, Columbian College was closed, yet in the same year; the [[Nanaimo]] Vocational School opens and starts providing vocational education.   The Extension Department (later called Continuing Studies) at UBC is established, enabling UBC to bring higher education to all parts of the province.\n\nWith the start of [[World War II]] in 1939, UBC's faculty, staff, and students dedicated themselves to the cause. In 1940, the [[Government of Canada]] established a military college in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[Royal Roads Military College]] to train officers for the [[Canadian Forces|Canada's armed forces]].\n\nAfter World War II, UBC's President [[Norman MacKenzie (politician)|Norman MacKenzie]] declared any returning veteran was guaranteed a space at UBC. As a result, student numbers tripled to over 9,000 by 1947 and UBC experienced a crunch in classroom space and a lack of faculty to teach the extra classes that were needed. In 1949, the Vancouver Vocational Institute opened.  By 1956, a new provincial Teacher Training Program was established at UBC, and the Victoria and Vancouver Normal Schools were closed.  In 1960, the British Columbia Vocational School opened under direct management of the provincial government.\n\n===MacDonald report and expansion of the public post-secondary system (1962 \u2013 1988)===\nIn 1962, John B. MacDonald recommended changes in the post-secondary system in British Columbia.<ref>[http://www.bccat.bc.ca/pubs/macdonaldreport.pdf ''Higher Education in British Columbia and a Plan for the Future'']</ref> A recommendation of the MacDonald report was the establishment of two-year community colleges offering programs in four fields of education: [[academic]] (university transfer); [[career]]/[[vocational education|technical]], to train students for specific employment with programs ranging in duration from a few weeks to two or more years; [[vocational]], offering short applied programs of a year or less; and adult basic education to prepare those without high school graduation for other post-secondary programs or for employment. The report marked the development of British Columbia's Post Secondary School System.  In the same year, King Edward Continuing Education Centre and the private Christian evangelical college, Trinity Junior College both open their doors.\n\nIn 1963, the provincial legislature passed an act to establish [[Simon Fraser University]]. The [[University of Victoria]] was established in 1963 and moved to the [[Gordon Head]] campus. Also, the legislature charted [[Notre Dame University College]] of [[Nelson, British Columbia|Nelson]] as a private, Catholic university.  The [[British Columbia Institute of Technology]] (BCIT) opened in 1964.  Simon Fraser University opened in 1965.  This same year saw the opening of the first college recommended by the MacDonald report; Vancouver City College. Vancouver City College was the first autonomous community college in BC, formed by amalgamating Vancouver Vocational Institute, Vancouver School of Art, and King Edward Continuing Education Centre.\n\nCommunity colleges around the province started opening between 1966 and 1975: [[Selkirk College]] opened in 1966 followed by [[Capilano College]], [[College of New Caledonia]], Okanagan Regional College, and Malaspina College in 1968.  [[Cariboo College]] and [[Douglas College]] were opened in 1970 followed by [[Camosun College]] in 1971, and East Kootenay Community College, [[North Island College]], [[Northern Lights College]], and Northwest Community College all opened in 1975.\n\nIn 1971, Union College and the Anglican Theological College joined to form the Vancouver School of Theology at UBC. Also in 1971, UBC became the first university in Canada to offer a program in Women's Studies for academic credit. Trinity Junior College was renamed Trinity Western College in 1972. The government established the Post-Secondary Articulation Coordinating Committee in 1974 to provide a means of determining whether post-secondary institutions could apply previous credit at another British Columbia institution toward completion of a program. This same year, Simon Fraser University (SFU) became the first university in Canada to have a female president with [[Pauline Jewett| Pauline Jewett's]] installment. Then in 1975, the provincial government passed the ''Royal Roads Military College Degrees Act'' enabling Royal Roads to grant degrees. In 1977, BCIT opened Sea Island Campus in [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]]<ref name=\"bcit.ca\">British Columbia Institute of Technology: About the Institute: History, (n.d) Retrieved June 25, 2008, from https://www.bcit.ca/about/history.shtml</ref> The year, 1978 saw the establishment of the Open Learning Institute, the Pacific Vocational Institute, the Justice Institute, the Pacific Marine Training Institute, and the [[Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design]] (ECIAD). In 1981, [[Kwantlen College]] formed as a separate institution from [[Douglas College]].  Then in 1983, the Nicola Valley Institute of Technology opened to address the low participation and success rates of First Nations students in higher education. 1984 saw the closure of the Notre Dame University of Nelson due to costs per student. In 1985, the Government of British Columbia supported a private member's bill that would change Trinity Western College to [[Trinity Western University]]. BCIT merged with the Pacific Vocational Institute in 1986.<ref name=\"bcit.ca\"/> In 1988, the [[Open Learning Agency]] was formed by combining the Open Learning Institute and the Knowledge Network.\n\n===Focus on transferability and the creation of university colleges (1989\u20132007)===\nThe [[British Columbia Council on Admissions and Transfer]] (BCCAT) was created in 1989 to address the concerns about mobility and transferability of program credit throughout British Columbia, especially with regards to university colleges and students wanting to transfer from their local colleges to provincial universities.  Between 1989 and 1995, four two-year community colleges became four-year degree-granting university-colleges:  [[University College of the Cariboo]], [[Malaspina University College]], [[University College of the Fraser Valley]], and [[Kwantlen University College]].  In 1993, [[Yukon College]] became a part of the BC credit transfer system.  This same year, Aboriginal peoples in British Columbia established Wilp Wilxo'oskwhl Nisga'a, a community driven, student focused aboriginal post-secondary institute.  In 1994, Vancouver Community College's Langara campus separated into an independent college, and it was renamed [[Langara College]].  Also in 1994, the [[University of Northern British Columbia]] opened, and the Pacific Marine Institute merged with BCIT.<ref name=\"bcit.ca\"/>  Two Aboriginal education institutes \u2014 the Nicola Valley Institute of Technology and the Institute of Indigenous Government \u2014 were designated as public post-secondary institutions in 1995.  That same year, the provincial government passed the ''College and Institute Act'' that provided university colleges, colleges, and institutes with authority to grant associate degrees, diplomas, and certificates.  Also, 1995 saw the closure of Royal Roads Military College; yet by 1996, [[Royal Roads University]] opened on the same campus.\n\nIn 1999, the Technical University of BC opened only to be shut down in 2002. Simon Fraser University assumed responsibility for the students and facilities of the former Technical University of BC and established its Surrey campus. Also in 2002, the Government of British Columbia passed the ''Degree Authorization Act'' that enabled private universities to grant BC degrees. The act also expanded degree-granting capacity for colleges (applied baccalaureates) and university-colleges and institutes (applied masters).\n\nThe University College of the Cariboo and the Open Learning Agency amalgamated in 2005 to become [[Thompson Rivers University]].  Also in 2005, Okanagan University College is split to become UBC's Okanagan campus and Okanagan College, and the British Columbia government approves new private degree programs at [[Sprott Shaw College]], [[University Canada West]], and Columbia Colleges. In 2006, Canada and British Columbia's first private sector, for-profit, university, University Canada West, opens in Victoria.

The Council of Ministers of Education, Canada (CMEC), commissioned a report in 2002 that stated only 38% of Aboriginal students were found to finish high school, compared with 77% of non-Aboriginal students. The legacy of residential schools, of distrust or indifference to the school system, which is seen as antagonistic to their culture, and the lack of reflection of an Aboriginal perspective in the secondary system were all cited as factors in the poor performance and completion of Aboriginals in the secondary system which subsequently affects enrolment of Aboriginal peoples in post-secondary education.<ref name = \"CMEC-2002\">Council of Ministers of Education, Canada.

Globalization and modern technology has made it easier to obtain education in other countries, and governments are taking note when they consider their post-secondary student populations as a possible source of skilled workers to join the local economy.\n\nIn 1983, the BC Ministry of Advanced Education, Training and Technology established the International Education and Training Group (IETG), a forum for discussion between colleges, institutes and universities, and the ministries of Education and Advanced Education.  Five years later in 1988, the provincial government commissioned a study on international education issues.  The study reported that BC's institutions were uncoordinated in their internationalization efforts, were failing to present a professional image abroad, and that the province was not sufficiently proactive. In 1990, this led to the formation of the British Columbia Centre for International Education (BCCIE)\u2014the first such organization in Canada.\n\nThe total number of international students in British Columbia for the year of 2006 was 44,799, up from 23,011 in 1997.<ref>Canada.

There is no public subsidization, and international students pay a mostly full-tuition fee basis. Most international students obtain funding either through personal resources (e.g., family or savings), or obtain funding through the institution, such as entrance awards.  There are some government funds, but are usually open to nationals of developing countries only.   The [[Canadian Bureau for International Education]] lists some of those awards.<ref>http://www.destineducation.ca/intstdnt/awards_e.htm</ref>\n\nThe Off-Campus Work Permit Program for international students at public institutions was launched nationally as a formalized program on April 27, 2006. Prior to the introduction of this program, students were only allowed to work on the campus of the educational institution at which they were studying. Students who qualify for the program will be able to work up to 20 hours per week off-campus while classes are in session, full-time during summer and winter breaks, and over their reading weeks.\n\nIn April 2008, the Government of Canada's Minister of Citizenship and Immigration announced changes to work permits for international students who graduate from eligible programs at certain Canadian post-secondary institutions, making it easier to attract foreign students to Canada. For the first time, international students would be able to obtain an \"open work permit\" under the Post-Graduation Work Permit Program, with no restrictions on the type of employment and no requirement for a job offer. In addition, the duration of the work permit has been extended to three years across the country. Previously, the program only allowed international students to work for one or two years, depending on location. A minimum of one year of work experience  in managerial, professional or technical positions (i.e., at level 0, A or B under the National Occupational Classification system) will be necessary to apply to stay permanently through the Canadian Experience Class.<ref>Canada.

Retrieved on July 27, 2008 from http://www.qp.gov.ab.ca/documents/Acts/P19P5.cfm</ref>\n\nThe booming Alberta economy led to significant investments in post-secondary institutions and policies. A series of new scholarships were introduced for all newborns in the province, and the existing Rutherford scholarships were expended. There were also heavy capital investments, with almost all the main campuses receiving funds for expansions, renovations, and upgrades. A new interest in P3 funding also fuelled this expansion. Many of the new facilities and faculty have made the [[University of Alberta]] one of the world's top research institutions,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} and boast the second-largest student body in Canada as of September, 2009.\n\nIn September, 2009, Calgary's [[Mount Royal University]] and Edmonton's [[MacEwan University|Grant MacEwan University]] became the province's fifth and sixth public universities, respectively. Formerly considered colleges, both institutions offer many of the degrees and facilities previously only available at the two larger universities.\n\nDespite recent high provincial spending, tuition costs remain a concern for many Alberta students. Many promised cuts have yet to be realized, and costs are expected to rise again in the 2010s. The recent worldwide economic downturn has also brought a huge number of unemployed people back to school, putting further pressures on the institutions.\n\n==Access==\n\n===Geographical===\nPost-Secondary institutions in Alberta have been established in response to geographic population growth. In the beginning, there was only one university in the province, but satellite campuses were established as the population in other parts of the province grew. Later, these satellite campuses became universities that met the educational needs of the province's growing urban centres. In the 1960s, colleges sprouted, enabling access to higher education in rural areas.\n\n===Transferability===\nImproving access is done not only through geography expansion but also by increasing transferability or articulation of courses and programs between post-secondary institutions. Historically, students completed programs at a single institution.  However, over time students have become increasingly mobile, attending more than one post-secondary institution throughout the course of their academic lives. The province has supported and encouraged this kind of student mobility by developing college programs that transfer to larger urban post-secondary institutions where degrees can be completed.\n\nInitially articulation between the post-secondary institutions was conducted on a course by course basis.  This approach proved to be laborious and inconsistent.  As a result, Alberta post-secondary institutions and the provincial government collaborated to establish the [[Alberta Council on Admissions and Transfer]] (ACAT) in 1974.\n\nThrough ACAT, post-secondary stakeholders work cooperatively to ensure a smooth transition and transferability of courses and programs within the post-secondary system. ACAT also promotes assessment and [[recognition of prior learning]] assessment to recognize experiences outside of formal course requirements.\n\n[[Image:Rutherford House University of Alberta Edmonton Alberta Canada 03.jpg|thumb|left|250px|West view of Rutherford House on the grounds of the University of Alberta, Edmonton]]\n\nThrough ACAT various types of transfer agreements exist.  In program articulation, students in colleges and technical institutes' programs can transfer to the first or second year of another institution's program.  Depending on whether the student is transferring after accumulating one year credits or two years credits, it is called a \"one plus one\" or \"two plus two\" transfer.<ref name=\"barrington\">Barrington Research Group, Inc (2005) ''Best Practices in Prior Learning Assessment Recognition (PLAR) Final Report'' Retrieved May 11, 2008, from http://www.acat.gov.ab.ca/pdfs/PLAR_Final_Report_May_11_2005.pdf</ref>\n\nCredit transfer between institutions considers transferability at an individual course level.  In some cases, a course may be considered the same at the sending institution as it is at the receiving institution (the course is a transfer course). In other cases, a course is considered sufficiently similar or meets discipline requirements even though there is not an equivalent course at the receiving institution (the course is considered transferable).<ref name=\"barrington\"/>\n\nIn addition to covering Alberta institutions, [[Aurora College]] in [[Northwest Territories]], and [[Nunavut Arctic College]] in [[Nunavut]] are covered by ACAT.<ref>{{cite web|title=ALIS - Post-Secondary Admissions & Transfers|url=http://alis.alberta.ca/ps/ep/aas/ta/admissions.html|work=Post-Secondary Admissions & Transfers|publisher=Alberta Learning Information Service|accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, ACAT and the [[BCCAT|British Columbia Council on Admissions and Transfer]] agreed to a protocol regarding transfers between Alberta and [[British Columbia]].  The purpose of the protocol is to ensure that any student who satisfactorily completes course work in either Alberta or British Columbia, and wishes to transfer to an institution in the other may do so.  This protocol is \"in lieu of formal articulation because it is unlikely that the volume of students transferring to institutions in the other province will justify the resources necessary to undertake a formal articulation on a course-to-course basis.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=British Columbia / Alberta Transfer System Protocol|url=http://www.bccat.ca/pubs/BC-ABprotocol.pdf|accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition - PLAR===\nMany Alberta post-secondary programs have Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition (PLAR).  PLAR recognizes learning can be obtained through means other than formal credit courses.<ref name=\"barrington\"/>\n\nPLAR was in place prior to the change in the post-secondary act and is available in a wide variety of courses and programs.  It continues to be a factor that aids in making post-secondary options accessible.<ref name=\"barrington\"/>\n\n===ApplyAlberta===\nIn 2005, Alberta created a single online application system for 21 publicly funded post-secondary institutions called [http://applyalberta.ca/ ApplyAlberta].  By 2008 all 26 publicly funded post-secondary institutions were participating.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alberta Post Secondary Application System|website=apas-society.ca |url = http://www.apas-society.ca/index.php|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref>  The initiative serves two purposes: to facilitate entry into the post-secondary system for students, and to track the number of qualified applications, withdrawals, and other data to improve departmental planning.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alberta Innovation and Advanced Education|url=http://eae.alberta.ca/post-secondary/campusalberta/partnerships.aspx#AA|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===eCampusAlberta===\n[http://www.ecampusalberta.ca/ eCampusAlberta] was a partnership of the 26 Alberta publicly funded post-secondary institutions that facilitated increased access to high quality online learning opportunities. The partnership allowed Alberta students living anywhere in the province to receive post-secondary education from any of the partnership's member institutions.  Students could use the [http://www.ecampusalberta.ca/ eCampusAlberta] website to learn about and register in courses and programs and to choose their lead and partner institutions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alberta Innovation and Advanced Education|url=http://eae.alberta.ca/post-secondary/campusalberta/partnerships.aspx#eCA|website=eCampusAlberta|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref>  eCampusAlberta ceased operation in March 2017; the impact on distance education enrollment is being assessed.\n\n===Dual Credit Policy===\nIn May 2013, the Albertan Progressive Conservative Party released a document commissioned by Alison Redford, Premier at the time, entitled Provincial Dual Credit Strategy: Call to Action. This short policy detailed the party's vision for dual credit opportunities as they related to high school students transitioning to higher education on a career path, and included two phases: \"From Vision to Action\" and \"From Implementation to Sustainability\".  Redford committed $11 million over three years to fund the development of this plan.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2011, the Alberta government funded dual credit pilot projects while, at the same time, individual school jurisdictions and post-secondary institutions negotiated separate non-government funded dual credit agreements. Through these dual credit opportunities, high school students participated in apprenticeship training and/or post-secondary, college or university courses while earning both high school and post-secondary credits for the same course.<ref name=\"albertadualcredit.ca\">{{cite web|title=Provincial Dual Credit Strategy: Call to Action|url=http://www.albertadualcredit.ca/sites/default/files/dc_strategy_ call_to_action.pdf|website=Alberta Education|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Dual Credit Strategy calls for an expansion of the network of partnerships between the government (school jurisdictions) and higher-education institutions, and provides an evolving database to a list of courses called \"pathways\" organized based on emerging with a particular designation or certification in the job market. A pathway is defined as \"a selection of courses providing students with opportunities to explore and acquire the attitudes, skills, knowledge, and values for a potential career.\"<ref name=\"albertadualcredit.ca\"/>  Comprehensive Community Institutions, which focus on trade certification, and technical/vocational studies, make up the majority of the partnerships.\n\nAs of June 2015, there are 60 pathways available to students.<ref>{{cite web|title=CTS Pathways|url=http://education.alberta.ca/media/8815976/cts%20pathways%20cred entials%20feb-2014.pdf|website=Alberta Education|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref>  The target students of this legislation, although available to all Albertan students, are explicitly listed as First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit students, those living in remote or rural communities, and students who are at risk of dropping out of high school.<ref name=\"albertadualcredit.ca\"/>\n\n===Future challenges and improving access===\nChanging demographics in Alberta are likely to have a profound effect on post-secondary education. The majority of the population growth in Alberta is its urban centres - Edmonton, Calgary, Red Deer and Lethbridge - while the proportion of people living in small towns and rural areas is declining. Institutions based in rural communities will likely have challenges meeting enrollment targets while institutions in urban centres will face pressure in having enough capacity.\n\nMeanwhile, although the number of people immigrating to Alberta has been increasing, persistent gaps between immigrant and non-immigrant Albertans' success in the labor market will impact the province's ability to attract and retain highly skilled individuals. Therefore, addressing the most challenging labor market barriers for new Canadians\u2014the lack of Canadian work experience, the lack of recognition for foreign credentials, and language barriers\u2014would support new Albertans and the province in meeting its current and future demographic, labour, and skill needs.<ref>Government of Alberta.

Retrieved from http://www.advancededucation.gov.ab.ca/post-secondary/policy/capr.aspx</ref>\n\nWith their Business Plan priorities, the [[Ministry of Advanced Education]] indicates that it is committed to increasing access to learning opportunities. One of their focuses is to target under-represented groups in post-secondary, most notably First Nations, Metis and Inuit learners. The [http://eae.alberta.ca/ministry/agencies/caadvisory/aac.aspx Access Advisory Council] is a body appointed by the Ministry of Advance Education and Technology to provide advice in relation to the operation and reporting of the Access to the Future Fund.\n\nFinally, the impact of dropping oil prices on the Alberta economy in spring 2015 will have significant impacts on Albertans' need to access higher education.  Workers may need to return to the classroom to upgrade their skills to remain competitive in a weaker economy.  Access to education at all levels remains a priority for Alberta as the province continues to invest in developing a strong knowledge-based economy rather than its historic heavy reliance on the natural resource industry.\n\n==Structure==\n\n===Public post-secondary institutional structure===\n[[Image:St Joes Edmonton UofA.JPG|thumb|right|250px|St. Joseph's College at the University of Alberta]]\n[[Image:Ucalgary.jpg|thumb|right|250px|University of Calgary]]\n\nAlberta's public post-secondary system is organized into six categories or institutional designations. Collectively, these institutions offer a comprehensive set of certificates, diplomas, applied degrees, bachelors, masters and doctoral programs.  Each public post-secondary institution has a mandate outlining the institution's direction in terms of programming, region and client group served.  An institution's mandate is one of the guidelines used when new credit programs are considered for approval by the [[Alberta Advanced Education and Technology|Ministry of Advanced Education]]. In 2007, the [[Ministry of Advanced Education]] developed a model that defines institutions according to their credentials, type and intensity of research activity, and geographic focus. The six categories or institutional designations are:<ref name=\"framework\"/>\n\n* 1. Comprehensive Academic and Research Institutions ([[Athabasca University]], [[University of Alberta]], [[University of Calgary]], [[University of Lethbridge]])\n* 2. Baccalaureate and Applied Studies Institutions ([[MacEwan University]], [[Mount Royal University]])\n* 3. Polytechnic Institutions (e.g., [[Northern Alberta Institute of Technology|NAIT]], [[Southern Alberta Institute of Technology|SAIT Polytechnic]])\n* 4. Comprehensive Community Institutions (e.g., [[Bow Valley College]],  [[Keyano College]], [[Lakeland College (Alberta)|Lakeland College]], [[Red Deer College]])\n* 5. Independent Academic Institutions (e.g., [[Ambrose University College]], [[King's University College (Edmonton)|The King's University College]])\n* 6. Specialized Arts and Culture Institutions (e.g., [[Alberta College of Art and Design]], [[Banff Centre|The Banff Centre]])\n\n===Research structure===\nWhen Alberta established its six sector advanced education system in 2007, it also clearly defined roles and responsibilities for three categories of research: pure, applied, and scholarly.\n \nPure research is defined as exploratory and primarily conducted by Comprehensive Academic and Research Institutions (CARI).  Applied research focuses on identification of solutions to specific areas, may involve third party engagement or funding, and is conducted by non- CARIs.  Lastly, scholarly research encourages faculty members at non-CARIs to engage in research that supplements their instructional mandate, possibly in collaboration with a CARI.<ref>{{cite web|title=Roles and Mandates Policy Framework for Albert's Publicly Funded Advanced Education System|url=http://eae.alberta.ca/post-secondary/policy/roles.aspx|website=Alberta Innovation and Advanced Education|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nWith the clarity of roles established in the post-secondary system, Alberta's universities, colleges and technical institutes focus their mandates to contribute to the overall success of Alberta's research and innovation system.  Provincial higher education research falls under the banner of [http://www.albertainnovates.ca/%20Alberta%20Innovates Alberta Innovates].\n\n===Provincial legislation===\nAlberta has produced various acts to deal with post-secondary education over the course of its history. These acts were passed to regulate the development of different types of educational institutions established over time (see chronology). Most recently, the [[Ministry of Advanced Education]] proclaimed the [http://www.qp.gov.ab.ca/documents/Acts/P19P5.cfm Post-secondary Learning Act] in 2004. This act is now the singular piece of legislation that takes the place of four previous acts (the universities, colleges, Banff Centre and technical institutes acts). The rationale for combining all these acts is to establish a framework to expand offerings of baccalaureate degrees beyond the universities and private degree granting university colleges. Public colleges and institutes under this act can grant degrees as well. Another reason for this move is: to promote better coordination between public post-secondary institutions; avoid duplication of functions; move toward a single seamless post-secondary system; and ensure efficient allocation of resources. The creation of Campus Alberta Quality Council as the body that examines proposals for new degrees is also part of the consolidated Post-secondary Learning Act.\n\n====Campus Alberta====\nIn 2002, Alberta Learning released [http://eae.alberta.ca/post-secondary/policy/capr.aspx Campus Alberta], a document about the province's post-secondary system. Campus Alberta contains a set of guiding principles intended on fostering high quality, flexible learning opportunities for Alberta citizens. This document triggered changes in the post-secondary system, particularly to the acts that governed the different educational institutions. Although the concept has since evolved, this document set parameters around the emerging notion of lifelong learning. The key factors that encourage lifelong learning are:\n\n* A global tendency towards a knowledge-based economy\n* Globalization of international markets and growing competitive pressures\n* Industry's need for an increasingly sophisticated and expanding workforce\n* The positive impact education has on the individual and society at large.\n\nCampus Alberta advocates for a learning system that is responsive and focused on the learner as well as innovative, collaborative, and accessible.  In terms of accessibility and collaboration, the report recognizes the importance of both formal and informal learning opportunities as a way of earning credits for post-secondary education and encourages more articulation between post-secondary entities.<ref>Alberta Learning.(2002).''Campus Alberta: A Policy Framework.''  Retrieved May 11, 2008 from http://www.advancededucation.gov.ab.ca/pubstats/CampusPolicy/CampusAlbertFramework.pdf</ref>\n\nNow, the Campus Alberta Planning Resource has become an annual profile of Alberta's advanced education system, published by [[Alberta Advanced Education and Technology]]. The latest [http://eae.alberta.ca/post-secondary/policy/capr.aspx Campus Alberta Planning Resource] was published in 2014. It provides a common source for data on demographics, enrollment, and economic factors that impact demand for post-secondary education and the capacity of post-secondary institutions to meet this demand. This helps to ensure that Campus Alberta can respond to the needs of learners, the economy, and society in all regions across the province.\n\n==Governance==\n\n===Ministry Advanced Education===\nThe public post-secondary system is overseen by the [[Ministry of Advanced Education]]. The ministry's role is to provide oversight and leadership, facilitate partnerships, and work with post-secondary stakeholders. Credit programs are approved and administered by Alberta Innovation and Advanced Education.\n\nThe Ministry of Advanced Education does not act in isolation but has a number of councils and boards to provide policies and guidelines. These include:\n*[http://www.acat.gov.ab.ca Alberta Council on Admissions and Transfer]\n*[http://www.advancededucation.gov.ab.ca/appren Alberta Apprenticeship and Industry Training Board]\n*[http://www.apas-society.ca/ Alberta Post-Secondary Application System]\n*[http://www.caqc.gov.ab.ca Campus Alberta Quality Council]\n*[http://www.alis.gov.ab.ca/studentsfinance/main.asp Students Finance Board]\n\n===Public post-secondary institutions===\nPublic post-secondary institutions in Alberta have a bicameral governance structure. According to the Post-secondary Learning Act, each institution is governed by an autonomous Board of Governors. This entity provides strategic direction, establishes program offerings, approves admissions requirements, and promotes the development of the communities served by the institution.<ref name=\"learningact\">Alberta's Queen Print (2008) ''Post-secondary Learning Act.''

(''See section: [[Higher education in Alberta#Publicly Funded Post-secondary Institutions|Publicly Funded Post-secondary Institutions]]'')  Although Alberta Advanced Education provides the majority of funding, post-secondary institutions raise additional funds by generating tuition and student fees; offering fee-based services; and offering non-credit and off-campus credit programming.<ref name=\"hauserman\"/> A third source of funding comes from donations, sponsored research funding from provincial and federal agencies and private industry, and investments.\n\nIn principle the funding of post-secondary education in Alberta is a responsibility shared by students, their families and society. In a context of rising student costs, the Alberta government has set in place policies in areas such as tuition fees and financial assistance to ensure adequate levels of access and affordability.<ref name=\"blueprint\"/>\n\n===Tuition fee policy===\nIn order to ensure a reasonable contribution by the students to the costs of post-secondary education, the Alberta government regulates the payment of tuition fees. The tuition fee policy introduced in 1990 and amended in 1995 ensures that this direct monetary contribution does not exceed 30% of the cost of their education.\nThis policy requires public post-secondary institutions to charge the same fee to all residents of Canada and to impose a surcharge of 100% to all foreign students. Although students now contribute proportionately more toward the costs of their post-secondary education than they did in 1994\u201395, societal contributions have also increased.<ref name=\"blueprint\"/>\n\n===Financial assistance===\nAlberta's student loan program is structured on the shared-cost principle. Loans are awarded on the basis of student need and parental contributions. Society contributes through loan forgiveness and servicing costs. Alberta's student financial assistance program has increased student loan levels as well as the number and value of non-repayable forms of financial assistance in a context marked by the rising cost of post-secondary education.<ref name=\"blueprint\"/>\n\n====Alberta Centennial Education Savings Plan====\nIn 2005 the Alberta Centennial Education Savings Plan (ACES) was created.

The research infrastructure includes not only physical resources, such as facilities and equipment, but also human resources, such as faculty and graduate students. In addition to the aforementioned mechanisms, a specific type of activity called sponsored research is supported externally by: a) federal research granting councils, b) non-profit, and c) industry sources. However, a significant proportion of this research is sponsored by provincial government sources as well.

Retrieved on July 27, 2008 from http://www.qp.gov.ab.ca/documents/Acts/P19P5.cfm</ref>\n\nThe booming Alberta economy led to significant investments in post-secondary institutions and policies. A series of new scholarships were introduced for all newborns in the province, and the existing Rutherford scholarships were expended. There were also heavy capital investments, with almost all the main campuses receiving funds for expansions, renovations, and upgrades. A new interest in P3 funding also fuelled this expansion. Many of the new facilities and faculty have made the [[University of Alberta]] one of the world's top research institutions,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} and boast the second-largest student body in Canada as of September, 2009.\n\nIn September, 2009, Calgary's [[Mount Royal University]] and Edmonton's [[MacEwan University|Grant MacEwan University]] became the province's fifth and sixth public universities, respectively. Formerly considered colleges, both institutions offer many of the degrees and facilities previously only available at the two larger universities.\n\nDespite recent high provincial spending, tuition costs remain a concern for many Alberta students. Many promised cuts have yet to be realized, and costs are expected to rise again in the 2010s. The recent worldwide economic downturn has also brought a huge number of unemployed people back to school, putting further pressures on the institutions.\n\n==Access==\n\n===Geographical===\nPost-Secondary institutions in Alberta have been established in response to geographic population growth. In the beginning, there was only one university in the province, but satellite campuses were established as the population in other parts of the province grew. Later, these satellite campuses became universities that met the educational needs of the province's growing urban centres. In the 1960s, colleges sprouted, enabling access to higher education in rural areas.\n\n===Transferability===\nImproving access is done not only through geography expansion but also by increasing transferability or articulation of courses and programs between post-secondary institutions. Historically, students completed programs at a single institution.  However, over time students have become increasingly mobile, attending more than one post-secondary institution throughout the course of their academic lives. The province has supported and encouraged this kind of student mobility by developing college programs that transfer to larger urban post-secondary institutions where degrees can be completed.\n\nInitially articulation between the post-secondary institutions was conducted on a course by course basis.  This approach proved to be laborious and inconsistent.  As a result, Alberta post-secondary institutions and the provincial government collaborated to establish the [[Alberta Council on Admissions and Transfer]] (ACAT) in 1974.\n\nThrough ACAT, post-secondary stakeholders work cooperatively to ensure a smooth transition and transferability of courses and programs within the post-secondary system. ACAT also promotes assessment and [[recognition of prior learning]] assessment to recognize experiences outside of formal course requirements.\n\n[[Image:Rutherford House University of Alberta Edmonton Alberta Canada 03.jpg|thumb|left|250px|West view of Rutherford House on the grounds of the University of Alberta, Edmonton]]\n\nThrough ACAT various types of transfer agreements exist.  In program articulation, students in colleges and technical institutes' programs can transfer to the first or second year of another institution's program.  Depending on whether the student is transferring after accumulating one year credits or two years credits, it is called a \"one plus one\" or \"two plus two\" transfer.<ref name=\"barrington\">Barrington Research Group, Inc (2005) ''Best Practices in Prior Learning Assessment Recognition (PLAR) Final Report'' Retrieved May 11, 2008, from http://www.acat.gov.ab.ca/pdfs/PLAR_Final_Report_May_11_2005.pdf</ref>\n\nCredit transfer between institutions considers transferability at an individual course level.  In some cases, a course may be considered the same at the sending institution as it is at the receiving institution (the course is a transfer course). In other cases, a course is considered sufficiently similar or meets discipline requirements even though there is not an equivalent course at the receiving institution (the course is considered transferable).<ref name=\"barrington\"/>\n\nIn addition to covering Alberta institutions, [[Aurora College]] in [[Northwest Territories]], and [[Nunavut Arctic College]] in [[Nunavut]] are covered by ACAT.<ref>{{cite web|title=ALIS - Post-Secondary Admissions & Transfers|url=http://alis.alberta.ca/ps/ep/aas/ta/admissions.html|work=Post-Secondary Admissions & Transfers|publisher=Alberta Learning Information Service|accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, ACAT and the [[BCCAT|British Columbia Council on Admissions and Transfer]] agreed to a protocol regarding transfers between Alberta and [[British Columbia]].  The purpose of the protocol is to ensure that any student who satisfactorily completes course work in either Alberta or British Columbia, and wishes to transfer to an institution in the other may do so.  This protocol is \"in lieu of formal articulation because it is unlikely that the volume of students transferring to institutions in the other province will justify the resources necessary to undertake a formal articulation on a course-to-course basis.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=British Columbia / Alberta Transfer System Protocol|url=http://www.bccat.ca/pubs/BC-ABprotocol.pdf|accessdate=28 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition - PLAR===\nMany Alberta post-secondary programs have Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition (PLAR).  PLAR recognizes learning can be obtained through means other than formal credit courses.<ref name=\"barrington\"/>\n\nPLAR was in place prior to the change in the post-secondary act and is available in a wide variety of courses and programs.

This short policy detailed the party's vision for dual credit opportunities as they related to high school students transitioning to higher education on a career path, and included two phases: \"From Vision to Action\" and \"From Implementation to Sustainability\".  Redford committed $11 million over three years to fund the development of this plan.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2011, the Alberta government funded dual credit pilot projects while, at the same time, individual school jurisdictions and post-secondary institutions negotiated separate non-government funded dual credit agreements. Through these dual credit opportunities, high school students participated in apprenticeship training and/or post-secondary, college or university courses while earning both high school and post-secondary credits for the same course.<ref name=\"albertadualcredit.ca\">{{cite web|title=Provincial Dual Credit Strategy: Call to Action|url=http://www.albertadualcredit.ca/sites/default/files/dc_strategy_ call_to_action.pdf|website=Alberta Education|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Dual Credit Strategy calls for an expansion of the network of partnerships between the government (school jurisdictions) and higher-education institutions, and provides an evolving database to a list of courses called \"pathways\" organized based on emerging with a particular designation or certification in the job market. A pathway is defined as \"a selection of courses providing students with opportunities to explore and acquire the attitudes, skills, knowledge, and values for a potential career.\"<ref name=\"albertadualcredit.ca\"/>  Comprehensive Community Institutions, which focus on trade certification, and technical/vocational studies, make up the majority of the partnerships.\n\nAs of June 2015, there are 60 pathways available to students.<ref>{{cite web|title=CTS Pathways|url=http://education.alberta.ca/media/8815976/cts%20pathways%20cred entials%20feb-2014.pdf|website=Alberta Education|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref>  The target students of this legislation, although available to all Albertan students, are explicitly listed as First Nations, M\u00e9tis and Inuit students, those living in remote or rural communities, and students who are at risk of dropping out of high school.<ref name=\"albertadualcredit.ca\"/>\n\n===Future challenges and improving access===\nChanging demographics in Alberta are likely to have a profound effect on post-secondary education. The majority of the population growth in Alberta is its urban centres - Edmonton, Calgary, Red Deer and Lethbridge - while the proportion of people living in small towns and rural areas is declining. Institutions based in rural communities will likely have challenges meeting enrollment targets while institutions in urban centres will face pressure in having enough capacity.\n\nMeanwhile, although the number of people immigrating to Alberta has been increasing, persistent gaps between immigrant and non-immigrant Albertans' success in the labor market will impact the province's ability to attract and retain highly skilled individuals. Therefore, addressing the most challenging labor market barriers for new Canadians\u2014the lack of Canadian work experience, the lack of recognition for foreign credentials, and language barriers\u2014would support new Albertans and the province in meeting its current and future demographic, labour, and skill needs.<ref>Government of Alberta.

One of their focuses is to target under-represented groups in post-secondary, most notably First Nations, Metis and Inuit learners. The [http://eae.alberta.ca/ministry/agencies/caadvisory/aac.aspx Access Advisory Council] is a body appointed by the Ministry of Advance Education and Technology to provide advice in relation to the operation and reporting of the Access to the Future Fund.\n\nFinally, the impact of dropping oil prices on the Alberta economy in spring 2015 will have significant impacts on Albertans' need to access higher education.  Workers may need to return to the classroom to upgrade their skills to remain competitive in a weaker economy.  Access to education at all levels remains a priority for Alberta as the province continues to invest in developing a strong knowledge-based economy rather than its historic heavy reliance on the natural resource industry.\n\n==Structure==\n\n===Public post-secondary institutional structure===\n[[Image:St Joes Edmonton UofA.JPG|thumb|right|250px|St. Joseph's College at the University of Alberta]]\n[[Image:Ucalgary.jpg|thumb|right|250px|University of Calgary]]\n\nAlberta's public post-secondary system is organized into six categories or institutional designations. Collectively, these institutions offer a comprehensive set of certificates, diplomas, applied degrees, bachelors, masters and doctoral programs.  Each public post-secondary institution has a mandate outlining the institution's direction in terms of programming, region and client group served.  An institution's mandate is one of the guidelines used when new credit programs are considered for approval by the [[Alberta Advanced Education and Technology|Ministry of Advanced Education]]. In 2007, the [[Ministry of Advanced Education]] developed a model that defines institutions according to their credentials, type and intensity of research activity, and geographic focus. The six categories or institutional designations are:<ref name=\"framework\"/>\n\n* 1. Comprehensive Academic and Research Institutions ([[Athabasca University]], [[University of Alberta]], [[University of Calgary]], [[University of Lethbridge]])\n* 2. Baccalaureate and Applied Studies Institutions ([[MacEwan University]], [[Mount Royal University]])\n* 3. Polytechnic Institutions (e.g., [[Northern Alberta Institute of Technology|NAIT]], [[Southern Alberta Institute of Technology|SAIT Polytechnic]])\n* 4. Comprehensive Community Institutions (e.g., [[Bow Valley College]],  [[Keyano College]], [[Lakeland College (Alberta)|Lakeland College]], [[Red Deer College]])\n* 5. Independent Academic Institutions (e.g., [[Ambrose University College]], [[King's University College (Edmonton)|The King's University College]])\n* 6. Specialized Arts and Culture Institutions (e.g., [[Alberta College of Art and Design]], [[Banff Centre|The Banff Centre]])\n\n===Research structure===\nWhen Alberta established its six sector advanced education system in 2007, it also clearly defined roles and responsibilities for three categories of research: pure, applied, and scholarly.\n \nPure research is defined as exploratory and primarily conducted by Comprehensive Academic and Research Institutions (CARI).  Applied research focuses on identification of solutions to specific areas, may involve third party engagement or funding, and is conducted by non- CARIs.  Lastly, scholarly research encourages faculty members at non-CARIs to engage in research that supplements their instructional mandate, possibly in collaboration with a CARI.<ref>{{cite web|title=Roles and Mandates Policy Framework for Albert's Publicly Funded Advanced Education System|url=http://eae.alberta.ca/post-secondary/policy/roles.aspx|website=Alberta Innovation and Advanced Education|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nWith the clarity of roles established in the post-secondary system, Alberta\u2019s universities, colleges and technical institutes focus their mandates to contribute to the overall success of Alberta\u2019s research and innovation system.  Provincial higher education research falls under the banner of [http://www.albertainnovates.ca/%20Alberta%20Innovates Alberta Innovates].\n\n===Provincial legislation===\nAlberta has produced various acts to deal with post-secondary education over the course of its history. These acts were passed to regulate the development of different types of educational institutions established over time (see chronology). Most recently, the [[Ministry of Advanced Education]] proclaimed the [http://www.qp.gov.ab.ca/documents/Acts/P19P5.cfm Post-secondary Learning Act] in 2004. This act is now the singular piece of legislation that takes the place of four previous acts (the universities, colleges, Banff Centre and technical institutes acts). The rationale for combining all these acts is to establish a framework to expand offerings of baccalaureate degrees beyond the universities and private degree granting university colleges. Public colleges and institutes under this act can grant degrees as well. Another reason for this move is: to promote better coordination between public post-secondary institutions; avoid duplication of functions; move toward a single seamless post-secondary system; and ensure efficient allocation of resources. The creation of Campus Alberta Quality Council as the body that examines proposals for new degrees is also part of the consolidated Post-secondary Learning Act.\n\n====Campus Alberta====\nIn 2002, Alberta Learning released [http://eae.alberta.ca/post-secondary/policy/capr.aspx Campus Alberta], a document about the province's post-secondary system. Campus Alberta contains a set of guiding principles intended on fostering high quality, flexible learning opportunities for Alberta citizens. This document triggered changes in the post-secondary system, particularly to the acts that governed the different educational institutions. Although the concept has since evolved, this document set parameters around the emerging notion of lifelong learning. The key factors that encourage lifelong learning are:\n\n* A global tendency towards a knowledge-based economy\n* Globalization of international markets and growing competitive pressures\n* Industry's need for an increasingly sophisticated and expanding workforce\n* The positive impact education has on the individual and society at large.\n\nCampus Alberta advocates for a learning system that is responsive and focused on the learner as well as innovative, collaborative, and accessible.  In terms of accessibility and collaboration, the report recognizes the importance of both formal and informal learning opportunities as a way of earning credits for post-secondary education and encourages more articulation between post-secondary entities.<ref>Alberta Learning.(2002).''Campus Alberta: A Policy Framework.''  Retrieved May 11, 2008 from http://www.advancededucation.gov.ab.ca/pubstats/CampusPolicy/CampusAlbertFramework.pdf</ref>\n\nNow, the Campus Alberta Planning Resource has become an annual profile of Alberta's advanced education system, published by [[Alberta Advanced Education and Technology]]. The latest [http://eae.alberta.ca/post-secondary/policy/capr.aspx Campus Alberta Planning Resource] was published in 2014. It provides a common source for data on demographics, enrollment, and economic factors that impact demand for post-secondary education and the capacity of post-secondary institutions to meet this demand. This helps to ensure that Campus Alberta can respond to the needs of learners, the economy, and society in all regions across the province.\n\n==Governance==\n\n===Ministry Advanced Education===\nThe public post-secondary system is overseen by the [[Ministry of Advanced Education]]. The ministry's role is to provide oversight and leadership, facilitate partnerships, and work with post-secondary stakeholders. Credit programs are approved and administered by Alberta Innovation and Advanced Education.\n\nThe Ministry of Advanced Education does not act in isolation but has a number of councils and boards to provide policies and guidelines. These include:\n*[http://www.acat.gov.ab.ca Alberta Council on Admissions and Transfer]\n*[http://www.advancededucation.gov.ab.ca/appren Alberta Apprenticeship and Industry Training Board]\n*[http://www.apas-society.ca/ Alberta Post-Secondary Application System]\n*[http://www.caqc.gov.ab.ca Campus Alberta Quality Council]\n*[http://www.alis.gov.ab.ca/studentsfinance/main.asp Students Finance Board]\n\n===Public post-secondary institutions===\nPublic post-secondary institutions in Alberta have a bicameral governance structure.

(''See section: [[Higher education in Alberta#Publicly Funded Post-secondary Institutions|Publicly Funded Post-secondary Institutions]]'')  Although Alberta Advanced Education provides the majority of funding, post-secondary institutions raise additional funds by generating tuition and student fees; offering fee-based services; and offering non-credit and off-campus credit programming.<ref name=\"hauserman\"/> A third source of funding comes from donations, sponsored research funding from provincial and federal agencies and private industry, and investments.\n\nIn principle the funding of post-secondary education in Alberta is a responsibility shared by students, their families and society. In a context of rising student costs, the Alberta government has set in place policies in areas such as tuition fees and financial assistance to ensure adequate levels of access and affordability.<ref name=\"blueprint\"/>\n\n===Tuition fee policy===\nIn order to ensure a reasonable contribution by the students to the costs of post-secondary education, the Alberta government regulates the payment of tuition fees. The tuition fee policy introduced in 1990 and amended in 1995 ensures that this direct monetary contribution does not exceed 30% of the cost of their education.\nThis policy requires public post-secondary institutions to charge the same fee to all residents of Canada and to impose a surcharge of 100% to all foreign students. Although students now contribute proportionately more toward the costs of their post-secondary education than they did in 1994-95, societal contributions have also increased.<ref name=\"blueprint\"/>\n\n===Financial assistance===\nAlberta's student loan program is structured on the shared-cost principle. Loans are awarded on the basis of student need and parental contributions. Society contributes through loan forgiveness and servicing costs.

The research infrastructure includes not only physical resources, such as facilities and equipment, but also human resources, such as faculty and graduate students.

Owing to the relevance of [[thermodynamics]] in much of [[science]] and [[technology]], its history is finely woven with the developments of [[classical mechanics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[magnetism]], and [[chemical kinetics]], to more distant applied fields such as [[meteorology]], [[information theory]], and [[biology]] ([[physiology]]), and to [[technology|technological]] developments such as the [[steam engine]], [[internal combustion engine]], [[cryogenics]] and [[electricity generation]]. The development of thermodynamics both drove and was driven by [[atomic theory]]. It also, albeit in a subtle manner, motivated new directions in [[probability]] and [[statistics]]; see, for example, the [[timeline of thermodynamics]].\n\n==History==\n===Contributions from antiquity===\nThe ancients viewed heat as that related to fire. In 3000 BC, the [[ancient Egypt]]ians viewed heat as related to origin mythologies.<ref name=\"Griffith\">{{cite journal | author = J. Gwyn Griffiths | year = 1955 | title = The Orders of Gods in Greece and Egypt (According to Herodotus) | journal = The Journal of Hellenic Studies | volume = 75 | pages = 21\u201323 | doi = 10.2307/629164 | jstor=629164}}</ref>  \nIn the [[western philosophy|Western philosophical]] tradition, after much debate about the primal element among earlier [[pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic philosopher]]s, [[Empedocles]] proposed a four-element theory, in which all substances derive from [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[water (classical element)|water]], [[air (classical element)|air]], and [[fire (classical element)|fire]]. The Empedoclean element of fire is perhaps the principal ancestor of later concepts such as [[phlogiston|phlogin]] and [[caloric theory|caloric]].  Around 500 BC, the [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Heraclitus]] became famous as the \"flux and fire\" philosopher for his proverbial utterance: \"All things are flowing.\" Heraclitus argued that the three [[classical elements|principal elements]] in nature were fire, earth, and water. \n[[File:Thermally Agitated Molecule.gif|266px|thumb|left|'''Heating''' a body, such as a segment of [[protein]] [[alpha helix]] (above), tends to cause its atoms to vibrate more, and to expand or change [[Phase (matter)|phase]], if heating is continued; an axiom of nature noted by [[Herman Boerhaave]] in the 1700s.]]\n\nIn the [[early modern period]], heat was thought to be a measurement of an invisible fluid, known as the ''[[caloric theory|caloric]]''.  Bodies were capable of holding a certain amount of this fluid, leading to the term ''heat capacity'', named and first investigated by [[Scotland|Scottish]] chemist [[Joseph Black]] in the 1750s.<ref name=\"Laider\">{{cite book\n |last= Laider|first= Keith J.\n |year=1993\n |title=The World of Physical Chemistry\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=01LRlPbH80cC&printsec=frontcover\n |publisher=Oxford University Press\n |isbn=978-0-19-855919-1\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, scientists abandoned the idea of a physical caloric, and instead understood [[heat]] as a manifestation of a system's [[internal energy]]. Today heat is the transfer of disordered thermal energy. Nevertheless, at least in English, the term ''heat capacity'' survives. In some other languages, the term ''thermal capacity'' is preferred, and it is also sometimes used in English.\n\n[[Atomism]] is a central part of today's relationship between thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Ancient thinkers such as  [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]], and later the [[Epicureans]], by advancing atomism, laid the foundations for the later [[atomic theory]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}. Until experimental proof of [[atoms]] was later provided in the 20th century, the atomic theory was driven largely by philosophical considerations and scientific intuition.\n\nThe 5th century BC Greek philosopher [[Parmenides]], in his only known work, a poem conventionally titled ''On Nature'', uses verbal reasoning to postulate that a void, essentially what is now known as a [[vacuum]], in nature could not occur. This view was supported by the arguments of [[Aristotle]], but was criticized by [[Leucippus]] and [[Hero of Alexandria]].  From antiquity to the Middle Ages various arguments were put forward to prove or disapprove the existence of a vacuum and several attempts were made to construct a vacuum but all proved unsuccessful.\n\nThe European scientists [[Cornelius Drebbel]], [[Robert Fludd]], [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Santorio Santorio]] in the 16th and 17th centuries were able to gauge the relative \"[[coldness]]\" or \"[[Temperature|hotness]]\" of air, using a rudimentary air [[thermometer]] (or [[thermoscope]]). This may have been influenced by an earlier device which could expand and contract the air constructed by [[Philo of Byzantium]] and [[Hero of Alexandria]].\n\nAround 1600, the English philosopher and scientist [[Francis Bacon]] surmised: \"Heat itself, its essence and quiddity is motion and nothing else.\"  In 1643, [[Galileo Galilei]], while generally accepting the 'sucking' explanation of ''horror vacui'' proposed by Aristotle, believed that nature's vacuum-abhorrence is limited.  Pumps operating in mines had already proven that nature would only fill a vacuum with water up to a height of ~30 feet.  Knowing this curious fact, Galileo encouraged his former pupil [[Evangelista Torricelli]] to investigate these supposed limitations.  Torricelli did not believe that vacuum-abhorrence (''[[Horror vacui (physics)|Horror vacui]]'') in the sense of Aristotle's 'sucking' perspective, was responsible for raising the water.  Rather, he reasoned, it was the result of the pressure  exerted on the liquid by the surrounding air.\n\nTo prove this theory, he filled a long glass tube (sealed at one end) with mercury and upended it into a dish also containing mercury.  Only a portion of the tube emptied (as shown adjacent); ~30&nbsp;inches of the liquid remained.  As the mercury emptied, and a partial [[vacuum]] was created at the top of the tube.  The gravitational force on the heavy element Mercury prevented it from filling the vacuum.\n\n=== Transition from chemistry to thermochemistry ===\n{{See also|History of chemistry}}\n[[File:Ice-calorimeter.jpg|150px|right|thumb|The world's first '''ice-calorimeter''', used in the winter of 1782\u201383, by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], to determine the heat evolved in various [[chemical change]]s; calculations which were based on [[Joseph Black]]'s prior discovery of [[latent heat]].  These experiments mark the foundation of [[thermochemistry]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}]]\n \nThe theory of phlogiston arose in the 17th century, late in the period of alchemy. Its replacement by [[caloric theory]] in the 18th century is one of the historical markers of the transition from alchemy to chemistry.  Phlogiston was a hypothetical substance that was presumed to be liberated from combustible substances during [[combustion|burning]], and from metals during the process of [[rusting]].  Caloric, like phlogiston, was also presumed to be the \"substance\" of heat that would flow from a hotter body to a cooler body, thus warming it.\n\nThe first substantial experimental challenges to caloric theory arose in [[Benjamin Thompson|Rumford]]'s 1798 work, when he showed that boring [[cast iron]] [[cannon]]s produced great amounts of heat which he ascribed to [[friction]], and his work was among the first to undermine the caloric theory. The development of the [[steam engine]] also focused attention on [[calorimetry]] and the amount of heat produced from different types of [[coal]]. The first quantitative research on the heat changes during chemical reactions was initiated by [[Lavoisier]] using an ice [[calorimeter]] following research by [[Joseph Black]] on the [[latent heat]] of water.\n\nMore quantitative studies by [[James Prescott Joule]] in 1843 onwards provided soundly reproducible phenomena, and helped to place the subject of thermodynamics on a solid footing. [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], for example, was still trying to explain Joule's observations within a caloric framework as late as 1850. The utility and explanatory power of [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]], however, soon started to displace caloric and it was largely obsolete by the end of the 19th century. [[Joseph Black]] and [[Lavoisier]] made important contributions in the precise measurement of heat changes using the [[calorimeter]], a subject which became known as [[thermochemistry]].\n\n=== Phenomenological thermodynamics ===\n[[File:Robert Boyle 0001.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Robert Boyle. 1627\u20131691]]\n*[[Boyle's law]] (1662)\n*[[Charles's law]] was first published by [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] in 1802, but he referenced unpublished work by [[Jacques Charles]] from around 1787. The relationship had been anticipated by the work of [[Guillaume Amontons]] in 1702.\n*[[Gay-Lussac's law]] (1802)\n\n===Birth of thermodynamics as a science===\nIrish physicist and chemist [[Robert Boyle]] in 1656, in coordination with English scientist [[Robert Hooke]], built an air pump. Using this pump, Boyle and Hooke noticed the pressure-volume correlation: P.V=constant. In that time, air was assumed to be a system of motionless particles, and not interpreted as a system of moving molecules. The concept of thermal motion came two centuries later.  Therefore, Boyle's publication in 1660 speaks about a mechanical concept: the air spring.<ref>New Experiments physico-mechanicall, Touching the Spring of the Air and its Effects (1660). [http://www.imss.fi.it/vuoto/eboyle.html]</ref> Later, after the invention of the thermometer, the property temperature could be quantified. This tool gave [[Gay-Lussac]] the opportunity to derive his law, which led shortly later to the [[ideal gas law]].  But, already before the establishment of the ideal gas law, an associate of Boyle's named [[Denis Papin]] built in 1679 a bone digester, which is a closed vessel with a tightly fitting lid that confines steam until a high pressure is generated.\n\nLater designs implemented a steam release valve to keep the machine from exploding.  By watching the valve rhythmically move up and down, Papin conceived of the idea of a piston and cylinder engine.  He did not however follow through with his design. Nevertheless, in 1697, based on Papin's designs, engineer [[Thomas Savery]] built the first engine. Although these early engines were crude and inefficient, they attracted the attention of the leading scientists of the time. One such scientist was [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]], the \"father of thermodynamics\", who in 1824 published ''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'', a discourse on heat, power, and engine efficiency.  This marks the start of thermodynamics as a modern science.\n\n[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A [[Watt steam engine]], the [[steam engine]] that propelled the Industrial Revolution in Britain and the world]]\n\nHence, prior to 1698 and the invention of the [[steam engine|Savery Engine]], horses were used to power pulleys, attached to buckets, which lifted water out of flooded salt mines in England. In the years to follow, more variations of steam engines were built, such as the [[Newcomen steam engine|Newcomen Engine]], and later the [[watt steam engine|Watt Engine]]. In time, these early engines would eventually be utilized in place of horses.  Thus, each engine began to be associated with a certain amount of \"horse power\" depending upon how many horses it had replaced. The main problem with these first engines was that they were slow and clumsy, converting less than 2% of the input [[fuel]] into useful work.  In other words, large quantities of coal (or wood) had to be burned to yield only a small fraction of work output.  Hence the need for a new science of engine [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] was born.\n\n[[File:Carnot2.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Sadi Carnot (1796\u20131832): the \"father\" of thermodynamics]]\nMost cite [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot's]] 1824 book ''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'' as the starting point for thermodynamics as a modern science.  Carnot defined \"motive power\" to be the expression of the ''useful effect'' that a motor is capable of producing.  Herein, Carnot introduced us to the first modern day definition of \"[[Mechanical work|work]]\": ''weight lifted through a height''.   The desire to understand, via formulation, this ''useful effect'' in relation to \"work\" is at the core of all modern day thermodynamics.\n\nIn 1843, [[James Joule]] experimentally found the [[mechanical equivalent of heat]]. In 1845, Joule reported his best-known experiment, involving the use of a falling weight to spin a paddle-wheel in a barrel of water, which allowed him to estimate a mechanical equivalent of heat of 819&nbsp;ft\u00b7lbf/Btu (4.41 J/cal). This led to the theory of [[conservation of energy]] and explained why heat can do work.\n\nIn 1850, the famed mathematical physicist [[Rudolf Clausius]] coined the term \"entropy\" (''das W\u00e4rmegewicht'', symbolized '''''S''''') to denote heat lost or turned into waste. (\"''W\u00e4rmegewicht''\" translates literally as \"heat-weight\"; the corresponding English term stems from the Greek ''\u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9'', \"I turn\".)\n\nThe name \"thermodynamics\", however, did not arrive until 1854, when the British mathematician and physicist [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (Lord Kelvin) coined the term ''thermo-dynamics'' in his paper ''On the Dynamical Theory of Heat''.<ref name=kelvin1854>{{cite journal |last=Thomson |first=W. |title=On the Dynamical Theory of Heat Part V.

Gibbs also originated the concept we now know as [[enthalpy]] '''''H''''', calling it \"a heat function for constant pressure\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Laidler|first1=Keith|authorlink=Keith J.

The first written scientific reflection on the microscopic nature of heat is probably to be found in a work by [[Mikhail Lomonosov]], in which he wrote:\n\n:\"(..) movement should not be denied based on the fact it is not seen. Who would deny that the leaves of trees move when rustled by a wind, despite it being unobservable from large distances? Just as in this case motion remains hidden due to perspective, it remains hidden in warm bodies due to the extremely small sizes of the moving particles. In both cases, the viewing angle is so small that neither the object nor their movement can be seen.\"\n\nDuring the same years, [[Daniel Bernoulli]] published his book ''Hydrodynamics'' (1738), in which he derived an equation for the pressure of a gas considering the collisions of its atoms with the walls of a container. He proves that this pressure is two thirds the average kinetic energy of the gas in a unit volume.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Bernoulli's ideas, however, made little impact on the dominant caloric culture. Bernoulli made a connection with [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s ''[[vis viva]]'' principle, an early formulation of the principle of [[conservation of energy]], and the two theories became intimately entwined throughout their history. Though Benjamin Thompson suggested that heat was a form of motion as a result of his experiments in 1798, no attempt was made to reconcile theoretical and experimental approaches, and it is unlikely that he was thinking of the ''vis viva'' principle.\n\n[[John Herapath]] later independently formulated a kinetic theory in 1820, but mistakenly associated temperature with [[momentum]] rather than ''vis viva'' or [[kinetic energy]]. His work ultimately failed [[peer review]] and was neglected. [[John James Waterston]] in 1843 provided a largely accurate account, again independently, but his work received the same reception, failing peer review even from someone as well-disposed to the kinetic principle as Davy.\n\nFurther progress in kinetic theory started only in the middle of the 19th century, with the works of [[Rudolf Clausius]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]], and [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]. In his 1857 work ''On the nature of the motion called heat'', Clausius for the first time clearly states that heat is the average kinetic energy of molecules. This interested Maxwell, who in 1859 derived the momentum distribution later named after him. Boltzmann subsequently generalized his distribution for the case of gases in external fields.\n\nBoltzmann is perhaps the most significant contributor to kinetic theory, as he introduced many of the fundamental concepts in the theory. Besides the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] mentioned above, he also associated the kinetic energy of particles with their [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]. The [[Boltzmann equation]] for the distribution function of a gas in non-equilibrium states is still the most effective equation for studying transport phenomena in gases and metals. By introducing the concept of [[Statistical mechanics|thermodynamic probability]] as the number of microstates corresponding to the current macrostate, he showed that its logarithm is proportional to entropy.\n\n== Branches of thermodynamics ==\nThe following list is a rough disciplinary outline of the major branches of thermodynamics and their time of inception:\n* [[Thermochemistry]] \u2013 1780s\n* [[Classical thermodynamics]] \u2013 1824\n* [[Chemical thermodynamics]] \u2013 1876\n* [[Statistical mechanics]] \u2013 c. 1880s\n* [[Equilibrium thermodynamics]]\n* Engineering thermodynamics\n* Chemical engineering thermodynamics \u2013 c. 1940s\n* [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics]] \u2013 1941\n* Small systems thermodynamics \u2013 1960s\n* [[Biological thermodynamics]] \u2013 1957\n* Ecosystem thermodynamics \u2013 1959\n* Relativistic thermodynamics \u2013 1965\n* [[Rational thermodynamics]] \u2013 1960s\n* [[Quantum thermodynamics]] \u2013 1968\n* [[Black hole thermodynamics]] \u2013 c. 1970s\n* Theory of [[critical phenomena]] and use of [[renormalization group]] theory in statistical physics \u2013 1966-1974\n* Geological thermodynamics \u2013 c. 1970s\n* Biological evolution thermodynamics \u2013 1978\n* Geochemical thermodynamics \u2013 c. 1980s\n* [[Atmospheric thermodynamics]] \u2013 c. 1980s\n* Natural systems thermodynamics \u2013 1990s\n* Supramolecular thermodynamics \u2013 1990s\n* Earthquake thermodynamics \u2013 2000\n* Drug-receptor thermodynamics \u2013 2001\n* Pharmaceutical systems thermodynamics \u2013 2002\n\nConcepts of thermodynamics have also been applied in other fields, for example:\n* [[Thermoeconomics]] \u2013 c. 1970s\n\n== Entropy and the second law ==\n{{Main|History of entropy}}\nEven though he was working with the caloric theory, [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] in 1824 suggested that some of the caloric available for generating useful work is lost in any real process. In March 1851, while grappling to come to terms with the work of [[James Prescott Joule]], [[Lord Kelvin]] started to speculate that there was an inevitable loss of useful heat in all processes. The idea was framed even more dramatically by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] in 1854, giving birth to the spectre of the [[heat death of the universe]].\n\nIn 1854, [[William John Macquorn Rankine]] started to make use in calculation of what he called his ''thermodynamic function''. This has subsequently been shown to be identical to the concept of [[entropy]] formulated by [[Rudolf Clausius]] in 1865. Clausius used the concept to develop his classic statement of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] the same year.\n\n== Heat transfer ==\n{{Main|Heat transfer}}\n\nThe phenomenon of [[heat conduction]] is immediately grasped in everyday life. In 1701, Sir [[Isaac Newton]] published his [[Heat transfer#Newton's law of cooling|law of cooling]]. However, in the 17th century, it came to be believed that all materials had an identical conductivity and that differences in sensation arose from their different [[heat capacity|heat capacities]].\n\nSuggestions that this might not be the case came from the new science of [[electricity]] in which it was easily apparent that some materials were good electrical conductors while others were effective insulators. [[Jan Ingen-Housz]] in 1785-9 made some of the earliest measurements, as did Benjamin Thompson during the same period.\n\nThe fact that warm air rises and the importance of the phenomenon to meteorology was first realised by [[Edmund Halley]] in 1686. Sir [[John Leslie (physicist)|John Leslie]] observed that the cooling effect of a stream of air increased with its speed, in 1804.\n\n[[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] distinguished heat transfer by [[thermal radiation]] (radiant heat) from that by convection and conduction in 1777. In 1791, [[Pierre Pr\u00e9vost]] showed that all bodies radiate heat, no matter how hot or cold they are. In 1804, Leslie observed that a matte black surface radiates heat more effectively than a polished surface, suggesting the importance of [[black-body radiation]]. Though it had become to be suspected even from Scheele's work, in 1831 [[Macedonio Melloni]] demonstrated that black-body radiation could be [[reflection (physics)|reflected]], [[refraction|refracted]] and [[polarisation (waves)|polarised]] in the same way as light.\n\n[[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s 1862 insight that both light and radiant heat were forms of [[electromagnetic wave]] led to the start of the [[quantitative property|quantitative]] analysis of thermal radiation. In 1879, [[Jo\u017eef Stefan]] observed that the total [[radiant flux]] from a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature and stated the [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law]]. The law was derived theoretically by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in 1884.\n\n==  Absolute Zero ==\nIn 1702 [[Guillaume Amontons]] introduced the concept of [[absolute zero]] based on observations of [[gas]]es. In 1810, Sir John Leslie froze water to ice artificially. The idea of absolute zero was generalised in 1848 by Lord Kelvin. In 1906, [[Walther Nernst]] stated the [[third law of thermodynamics]].\n\n==  Quantum Thermodynamics ==\nIn 1900 [[Max Planck]] found an accurate [[Planck's law|formula]] for the spectrum of black-body radiation.  Fitting new data required the introduction of a new constant, known as [[Planck's constant]], the fundamental constant of modern physics.  Looking at the radiation as coming from a cavity oscillator in thermal equilibrium, the formula suggested that energy in a cavity occurs only in multiples of frequency times the constant.  That is, it is quantized.  This avoided a divergence to which the theory would lead without the quantization.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Conservation of energy#Historical development|Conservation of energy: Historical development]]\n* [[History of Chemistry]]\n* [[History of Physics]]\n* [[Maxwell's thermodynamic surface]]\n* [[Timeline of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and random processes]]\n* [[Timeline of heat engine technology]]\n* [[Timeline of low-temperature technology]]\n* [[Timeline of thermodynamics]]\n* [[Vacuum]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book | author=Cardwell, D.S.L. | title=From Watt to Clausius: The Rise of Thermodynamics in the Early Industrial Age | publisher=Heinemann | location=London | year=1971 | isbn=978-0-435-54150-7}}\n* {{cite book |editor-last=Leff |editor-first=H.S. |editor-last2=Rex |editor-first2=A.F. | title=Maxwell's Demon: Entropy, Information and Computing | publisher=Adam Hilger | location=Bristol | year=1990 | isbn=978-0-7503-0057-5}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061002064913/http://history.hyperjeff.net/statmech History of Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics] \u2013 Timeline (1575 to 1980) @ Hyperjeff.net\n*[http://www.mhtl.uwaterloo.ca/courses/me354/history.html History of Thermodynamics] \u2013 University of Waterloo\n*[http://www.wolframscience.com/reference/notes/1019b Thermodynamic History Notes] \u2013 WolframScience.com\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060903071755/http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/courses/classes/E-115/Slides/A_Brief_History_of_Thermodynamics.pdf Brief History of Thermodynamics] \u2013 Berkeley [PDF]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061117114302/http://thermodynamicstudy.net/history.html History of Thermodynamics] \u2013 ThermodynamicStudy.net \n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060831062954/http://che.konyang.ac.kr/COURSE/thermo/history/therm_his.html Historical Background of Thermodynamics] \u2013 Carnegie-Mellon University \n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070701173528/http://www.nt.ntnu.no/users/haugwarb/Presentations/History%20of%20Thermodynamics/ History of Thermodynamics] \u2013 In Pictures\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Thermodynamics}}\n[[Category:History of thermodynamics| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Savery-engine.jpg|225px|right|thumb|The 1698 '''Savery Engine''' \u2013 the world's first commercially useful [[steam engine]]: built by [[Thomas Savery]]]]\n{{thermodynamics|cTopic=History and Culture}}\nThe '''history of thermodynamics''' is a fundamental strand in the [[history of physics]], the [[history of chemistry]], and the [[history of science]] in general. Owing to the relevance of [[thermodynamics]] in much of [[science]] and [[technology]], its history is finely woven with the developments of [[classical mechanics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[magnetism]], and [[chemical kinetics]], to more distant applied fields such as [[meteorology]], [[information theory]], and [[biology]] ([[physiology]]), and to [[technology|technological]] developments such as the [[steam engine]], [[internal combustion engine]], [[cryogenics]] and [[electricity generation]]. The development of thermodynamics both drove and was driven by [[atomic theory]]. It also, albeit in a subtle manner, motivated new directions in [[probability]] and [[statistics]]; see, for example, the [[timeline of thermodynamics]].\n\n==History==\n===Contributions from antiquity===\nThe ancients viewed heat as that related to fire. In 3000 BC, the [[ancient Egypt]]ians viewed heat as related to origin mythologies.<ref name=\"Griffith\">{{cite journal | author = J. Gwyn Griffiths | year = 1955 | title = The Orders of Gods in Greece and Egypt (According to Herodotus) | journal = The Journal of Hellenic Studies | volume = 75 | pages = 21\u201323 | doi = 10.2307/629164 | jstor=629164}}</ref>  \nIn the [[western philosophy|Western philosophical]] tradition, after much debate about the primal element among earlier [[pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic philosopher]]s, [[Empedocles]] proposed a four-element theory, in which all substances derive from [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[water (classical element)|water]], [[air (classical element)|air]], and [[fire (classical element)|fire]]. The Empedoclean element of fire is perhaps the principal ancestor of later concepts such as [[phlogiston|phlogin]] and [[caloric theory|caloric]].  Around 500 BC, the [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Heraclitus]] became famous as the \"flux and fire\" philosopher for his proverbial utterance: \"All things are flowing.\" Heraclitus argued that the three [[classical elements|principal elements]] in nature were fire, earth, and water. \n[[File:Thermally Agitated Molecule.gif|266px|thumb|left|'''Heating''' a body, such as a segment of [[protein]] [[alpha helix]] (above), tends to cause its atoms to vibrate more, and to expand or change [[Phase (matter)|phase]], if heating is continued; an axiom of nature noted by [[Herman Boerhaave]] in the 1700s.]]\n\nIn the [[early modern period]], heat was thought to be a measurement of an invisible fluid, known as the ''[[caloric theory|caloric]]''.  Bodies were capable of holding a certain amount of this fluid, leading to the term ''heat capacity'', named and first investigated by [[Scotland|Scottish]] chemist [[Joseph Black]] in the 1750s.<ref name=\"Laider\">{{cite book\n |last= Laider|first= Keith J.\n |year=1993\n |title=The World of Physical Chemistry\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=01LRlPbH80cC&printsec=frontcover\n |publisher=Oxford University Press\n |isbn=978-0-19-855919-1\n}}</ref>\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, scientists abandoned the idea of a physical caloric, and instead understood [[heat]] as a manifestation of a system's [[internal energy]]. Today heat is the transfer of disordered thermal energy. Nevertheless, at least in English, the term ''heat capacity'' survives. In some other languages, the term ''thermal capacity'' is preferred, and it is also sometimes used in English.\n\n[[Atomism]] is a central part of today's relationship between thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Ancient thinkers such as  [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]], and later the [[Epicureans]], by advancing atomism, laid the foundations for the later [[atomic theory]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}. Until experimental proof of [[atoms]] was later provided in the 20th century, the atomic theory was driven largely by philosophical considerations and scientific intuition.\n\nThe 5th century BC Greek philosopher [[Parmenides]], in his only known work, a poem conventionally titled ''On Nature'', uses verbal reasoning to postulate that a void, essentially what is now known as a [[vacuum]], in nature could not occur. This view was supported by the arguments of [[Aristotle]], but was criticized by [[Leucippus]] and [[Hero of Alexandria]].  From antiquity to the Middle Ages various arguments were put forward to prove or disapprove the existence of a vacuum and several attempts were made to construct a vacuum but all proved unsuccessful.\n\nThe European scientists [[Cornelius Drebbel]], [[Robert Fludd]], [[Galileo Galilei]] and [[Santorio Santorio]] in the 16th and 17th centuries were able to gauge the relative \"[[coldness]]\" or \"[[Temperature|hotness]]\" of air, using a rudimentary air [[thermometer]] (or [[thermoscope]]). This may have been influenced by an earlier device which could expand and contract the air constructed by [[Philo of Byzantium]] and [[Hero of Alexandria]].\n\nAround 1600, the English philosopher and scientist [[Francis Bacon]] surmised: \"Heat itself, its essence and quiddity is motion and nothing else.\"  In 1643, [[Galileo Galilei]], while generally accepting the 'sucking' explanation of ''horror vacui'' proposed by Aristotle, believed that nature's vacuum-abhorrence is limited.  Pumps operating in mines had already proven that nature would only fill a vacuum with water up to a height of ~30 feet.  Knowing this curious fact, Galileo encouraged his former pupil [[Evangelista Torricelli]] to investigate these supposed limitations.  Torricelli did not believe that vacuum-abhorrence (''[[Horror vacui (physics)|Horror vacui]]'') in the sense of Aristotle's 'sucking' perspective, was responsible for raising the water.  Rather, he reasoned, it was the result of the pressure  exerted on the liquid by the surrounding air.\n\nTo prove this theory, he filled a long glass tube (sealed at one end) with mercury and upended it into a dish also containing mercury.  Only a portion of the tube emptied (as shown adjacent); ~30&nbsp;inches of the liquid remained.  As the mercury emptied, and a partial [[vacuum]] was created at the top of the tube.  The gravitational force on the heavy element Mercury prevented it from filling the vacuum.\n\n=== Transition from chemistry to thermochemistry ===\n{{See also|History of chemistry}}\n[[File:Ice-calorimeter.jpg|150px|right|thumb|The world's first '''ice-calorimeter''', used in the winter of 1782-83, by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], to determine the heat evolved in various [[chemical change]]s; calculations which were based on [[Joseph Black]]'s prior discovery of [[latent heat]].  These experiments mark the foundation of [[thermochemistry]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}]]\n \nThe theory of phlogiston arose in the 17th century, late in the period of alchemy. Its replacement by [[caloric theory]] in the 18th century is one of the historical markers of the transition from alchemy to chemistry.  Phlogiston was a hypothetical substance that was presumed to be liberated from combustible substances during [[combustion|burning]], and from metals during the process of [[rusting]].  Caloric, like phlogiston, was also presumed to be the \"substance\" of heat that would flow from a hotter body to a cooler body, thus warming it.\n\nThe first substantial experimental challenges to caloric theory arose in [[Benjamin Thompson|Rumford]]'s 1798 work, when he showed that boring [[cast iron]] [[cannon]]s produced great amounts of heat which he ascribed to [[friction]], and his work was among the first to undermine the caloric theory. The development of the [[steam engine]] also focused attention on [[calorimetry]] and the amount of heat produced from different types of [[coal]]. The first quantitative research on the heat changes during chemical reactions was initiated by [[Lavoisier]] using an ice [[calorimeter]] following research by [[Joseph Black]] on the [[latent heat]] of water.\n\nMore quantitative studies by [[James Prescott Joule]] in 1843 onwards provided soundly reproducible phenomena, and helped to place the subject of thermodynamics on a solid footing. [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], for example, was still trying to explain Joule's observations within a caloric framework as late as 1850. The utility and explanatory power of [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]], however, soon started to displace caloric and it was largely obsolete by the end of the 19th century. [[Joseph Black]] and [[Lavoisier]] made important contributions in the precise measurement of heat changes using the [[calorimeter]], a subject which became known as [[thermochemistry]].\n\n=== Phenomenological thermodynamics ===\n[[File:Robert Boyle 0001.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Robert Boyle. 1627\u20131691]]\n*[[Boyle's law]] (1662)\n*[[Charles's law]] was first published by [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] in 1802, but he referenced unpublished work by [[Jacques Charles]] from around 1787. The relationship had been anticipated by the work of [[Guillaume Amontons]] in 1702.\n*[[Gay-Lussac's law]] (1802)\n\n===Birth of thermodynamics as a science===\nIrish physicist and chemist [[Robert Boyle]] in 1656, in coordination with English scientist [[Robert Hooke]], built an air pump. Using this pump, Boyle and Hooke noticed the pressure-volume correlation: P.V=constant. In that time, air was assumed to be a system of motionless particles, and not interpreted as a system of moving molecules. The concept of thermal motion came two centuries later.  Therefore, Boyle's publication in 1660 speaks about a mechanical concept: the air spring.<ref>New Experiments physico-mechanicall, Touching the Spring of the Air and its Effects (1660). [http://www.imss.fi.it/vuoto/eboyle.html]</ref> Later, after the invention of the thermometer, the property temperature could be quantified. This tool gave [[Gay-Lussac]] the opportunity to derive his law, which led shortly later to the [[ideal gas law]].  But, already before the establishment of the ideal gas law, an associate of Boyle's named [[Denis Papin]] built in 1679 a bone digester, which is a closed vessel with a tightly fitting lid that confines steam until a high pressure is generated.\n\nLater designs implemented a steam release valve to keep the machine from exploding.  By watching the valve rhythmically move up and down, Papin conceived of the idea of a piston and cylinder engine.  He did not however follow through with his design. Nevertheless, in 1697, based on Papin's designs, engineer [[Thomas Savery]] built the first engine. Although these early engines were crude and inefficient, they attracted the attention of the leading scientists of the time. One such scientist was [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]], the \"father of thermodynamics\", who in 1824 published ''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'', a discourse on heat, power, and engine efficiency.  This marks the start of thermodynamics as a modern science.\n\n[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A [[Watt steam engine]], the [[steam engine]] that propelled the Industrial Revolution in Britain and the world]]\n\nHence, prior to 1698 and the invention of the [[steam engine|Savery Engine]], horses were used to power pulleys, attached to buckets, which lifted water out of flooded salt mines in England. In the years to follow, more variations of steam engines were built, such as the [[Newcomen steam engine|Newcomen Engine]], and later the [[watt steam engine|Watt Engine]]. In time, these early engines would eventually be utilized in place of horses.  Thus, each engine began to be associated with a certain amount of \"horse power\" depending upon how many horses it had replaced. The main problem with these first engines was that they were slow and clumsy, converting less than 2% of the input [[fuel]] into useful work.  In other words, large quantities of coal (or wood) had to be burned to yield only a small fraction of work output.  Hence the need for a new science of engine [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] was born.\n\n[[File:Carnot2.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Sadi Carnot (1796\u20131832): the \"father\" of thermodynamics]]\nMost cite [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot's]] 1824 book ''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'' as the starting point for thermodynamics as a modern science.  Carnot defined \"motive power\" to be the expression of the ''useful effect'' that a motor is capable of producing.  Herein, Carnot introduced us to the first modern day definition of \"[[Mechanical work|work]]\": ''weight lifted through a height''.   The desire to understand, via formulation, this ''useful effect'' in relation to \"work\" is at the core of all modern day thermodynamics.\n\nIn 1843, [[James Joule]] experimentally found the [[mechanical equivalent of heat]]. In 1845, Joule reported his best-known experiment, involving the use of a falling weight to spin a paddle-wheel in a barrel of water, which allowed him to estimate a mechanical equivalent of heat of 819&nbsp;ft\u00b7lbf/Btu (4.41 J/cal). This led to the theory of [[conservation of energy]] and explained why heat can do work.\n\nIn 1850, the famed mathematical physicist [[Rudolf Clausius]] coined the term \"entropy\" (''das W\u00e4rmegewicht'', symbolized '''''S''''') to denote heat lost or turned into waste. (\"''W\u00e4rmegewicht''\" translates literally as \"heat-weight\"; the corresponding English term stems from the Greek ''\u03c4\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03c9'', \"I turn\".)\n\nThe name \"thermodynamics\", however, did not arrive until 1854, when the British mathematician and physicist [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (Lord Kelvin) coined the term ''thermo-dynamics'' in his paper ''On the Dynamical Theory of Heat''.<ref name=kelvin1854>{{cite journal |last=Thomson |first=W. |title=On the Dynamical Theory of Heat Part V.

Gibbs also originated the concept we now know as [[enthalpy]] '''''H''''', calling it \"a heat function for constant pressure\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Laidler|first1=Keith|authorlink=Keith J.

The first written scientific reflection on the microscopic nature of heat is probably to be found in a work by [[Mikhail Lomonosov]], in which he wrote:\n\n:\"(..) movement should not be denied based on the fact it is not seen. Who would deny that the leaves of trees move when rustled by a wind, despite it being unobservable from large distances? Just as in this case motion remains hidden due to perspective, it remains hidden in warm bodies due to the extremely small sizes of the moving particles. In both cases, the viewing angle is so small that neither the object nor their movement can be seen.\"\n\nDuring the same years, [[Daniel Bernoulli]] published his book ''Hydrodynamics'' (1738), in which he derived an equation for the pressure of a gas considering the collisions of its atoms with the walls of a container. He proves that this pressure is two thirds the average kinetic energy of the gas in a unit volume.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Bernoulli's ideas, however, made little impact on the dominant caloric culture. Bernoulli made a connection with [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s ''[[vis viva]]'' principle, an early formulation of the principle of [[conservation of energy]], and the two theories became intimately entwined throughout their history. Though Benjamin Thompson suggested that heat was a form of motion as a result of his experiments in 1798, no attempt was made to reconcile theoretical and experimental approaches, and it is unlikely that he was thinking of the ''vis viva'' principle.\n\n[[John Herapath]] later independently formulated a kinetic theory in 1820, but mistakenly associated temperature with [[momentum]] rather than ''vis viva'' or [[kinetic energy]]. His work ultimately failed [[peer review]] and was neglected. [[John James Waterston]] in 1843 provided a largely accurate account, again independently, but his work received the same reception, failing peer review even from someone as well-disposed to the kinetic principle as Davy.\n\nFurther progress in kinetic theory started only in the middle of the 19th century, with the works of [[Rudolf Clausius]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]], and [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]. In his 1857 work ''On the nature of the motion called heat'', Clausius for the first time clearly states that heat is the average kinetic energy of molecules. This interested Maxwell, who in 1859 derived the momentum distribution later named after him. Boltzmann subsequently generalized his distribution for the case of gases in external fields.\n\nBoltzmann is perhaps the most significant contributor to kinetic theory, as he introduced many of the fundamental concepts in the theory. Besides the [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] mentioned above, he also associated the kinetic energy of particles with their [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]. The [[Boltzmann equation]] for the distribution function of a gas in non-equilibrium states is still the most effective equation for studying transport phenomena in gases and metals. By introducing the concept of [[Statistical mechanics|thermodynamic probability]] as the number of microstates corresponding to the current macrostate, he showed that its logarithm is proportional to entropy.\n\n== Branches of thermodynamics ==\nThe following list is a rough disciplinary outline of the major branches of thermodynamics and their time of inception:\n* [[Thermochemistry]] \u2013 1780s\n* [[Classical thermodynamics]] \u2013 1824\n* [[Chemical thermodynamics]] \u2013 1876\n* [[Statistical mechanics]] \u2013 c. 1880s\n* [[Equilibrium thermodynamics]]\n* Engineering thermodynamics\n* Chemical engineering thermodynamics \u2013 c. 1940s\n* [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics]] \u2013 1941\n* Small systems thermodynamics \u2013 1960s\n* [[Biological thermodynamics]] \u2013 1957\n* Ecosystem thermodynamics \u2013 1959\n* Relativistic thermodynamics \u2013 1965\n* [[Rational thermodynamics]] \u2013 1960s\n* [[Quantum thermodynamics]] \u2013 1968\n* [[Black hole thermodynamics]] \u2013 c. 1970s\n* Theory of [[critical phenomena]] and use of [[renormalization group]] theory in statistical physics \u2013 1966-1974\n* Geological thermodynamics \u2013 c. 1970s\n* Biological evolution thermodynamics \u2013 1978\n* Geochemical thermodynamics \u2013 c. 1980s\n* [[Atmospheric thermodynamics]] \u2013 c. 1980s\n* Natural systems thermodynamics \u2013 1990s\n* Supramolecular thermodynamics \u2013 1990s\n* Earthquake thermodynamics \u2013 2000\n* Drug-receptor thermodynamics \u2013 2001\n* Pharmaceutical systems thermodynamics \u2013 2002\n\nConcepts of thermodynamics have also been applied in other fields, for example:\n* [[Thermoeconomics]] \u2013 c. 1970s\n\n== Entropy and the second law ==\n{{Main|History of entropy}}\nEven though he was working with the caloric theory, [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] in 1824 suggested that some of the caloric available for generating useful work is lost in any real process. In March 1851, while grappling to come to terms with the work of [[James Prescott Joule]], [[Lord Kelvin]] started to speculate that there was an inevitable loss of useful heat in all processes. The idea was framed even more dramatically by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] in 1854, giving birth to the spectre of the [[heat death of the universe]].\n\nIn 1854, [[William John Macquorn Rankine]] started to make use in calculation of what he called his ''thermodynamic function''. This has subsequently been shown to be identical to the concept of [[entropy]] formulated by [[Rudolf Clausius]] in 1865. Clausius used the concept to develop his classic statement of the [[second law of thermodynamics]] the same year.\n\n== Heat transfer ==\n{{Main|Heat transfer}}\n\nThe phenomenon of [[heat conduction]] is immediately grasped in everyday life. In 1701, Sir [[Isaac Newton]] published his [[Heat transfer#Newton's law of cooling|law of cooling]]. However, in the 17th century, it came to be believed that all materials had an identical conductivity and that differences in sensation arose from their different [[heat capacity|heat capacities]].\n\nSuggestions that this might not be the case came from the new science of [[electricity]] in which it was easily apparent that some materials were good electrical conductors while others were effective insulators. [[Jan Ingen-Housz]] in 1785-9 made some of the earliest measurements, as did Benjamin Thompson during the same period.\n\nThe fact that warm air rises and the importance of the phenomenon to meteorology was first realised by [[Edmund Halley]] in 1686. Sir [[John Leslie (physicist)|John Leslie]] observed that the cooling effect of a stream of air increased with its speed, in 1804.\n\n[[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] distinguished heat transfer by [[thermal radiation]] (radiant heat) from that by convection and conduction in 1777. In 1791, [[Pierre Pr\u00e9vost]] showed that all bodies radiate heat, no matter how hot or cold they are. In 1804, Leslie observed that a matte black surface radiates heat more effectively than a polished surface, suggesting the importance of [[black-body radiation]]. Though it had become to be suspected even from Scheele's work, in 1831 [[Macedonio Melloni]] demonstrated that black-body radiation could be [[reflection (physics)|reflected]], [[refraction|refracted]] and [[polarisation (waves)|polarised]] in the same way as light.\n\n[[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s 1862 insight that both light and radiant heat were forms of [[electromagnetic wave]] led to the start of the [[quantitative property|quantitative]] analysis of thermal radiation. In 1879, [[Jo\u017eef Stefan]] observed that the total [[radiant flux]] from a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature and stated the [[Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law]]. The law was derived theoretically by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in 1884.\n\n==  Absolute Zero ==\nIn 1702 [[Guillaume Amontons]] introduced the concept of [[absolute zero]] based on observations of [[gas]]es. In 1810, Sir John Leslie froze water to ice artificially. The idea of absolute zero was generalised in 1848 by Lord Kelvin. In 1906, [[Walther Nernst]] stated the [[third law of thermodynamics]].\n\n==  Quantum Thermodynamics ==\nIn 1900 [[Max Planck]] found an accurate [[Planck's law|formula]] for the spectrum of black body radiation.  Fitting new data required the introduction of a new constant, known as [[Planck's constant]], the fundamental constant of modern physics.  Looking at the radiation as coming from a cavity oscillator in thermal equilibrium, the formula suggested that energy in a cavity occurs only in multiples of frequency times the constant.  That is, it is quantized.  This avoided a divergence to which the theory would lead without the quantization.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Conservation of energy#Historical development|Conservation of energy: Historical development]]\n* [[History of Chemistry]]\n* [[History of Physics]]\n* [[Maxwell's thermodynamic surface]]\n* [[Timeline of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and random processes]]\n* [[Timeline of heat engine technology]]\n* [[Timeline of low-temperature technology]]\n* [[Timeline of thermodynamics]]\n* [[Vacuum]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book | author=Cardwell, D.S.L. | title=From Watt to Clausius: The Rise of Thermodynamics in the Early Industrial Age | publisher=Heinemann | location=London | year=1971 | isbn=978-0-435-54150-7}}\n* {{cite book |editor-last=Leff |editor-first=H.S. |editor-last2=Rex |editor-first2=A.F. | title=Maxwell's Demon: Entropy, Information and Computing | publisher=Adam Hilger | location=Bristol | year=1990 | isbn=978-0-7503-0057-5}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061002064913/http://history.hyperjeff.net/statmech History of Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics] \u2013 Timeline (1575 to 1980) @ Hyperjeff.net\n*[http://www.mhtl.uwaterloo.ca/courses/me354/history.html History of Thermodynamics] \u2013 University of Waterloo\n*[http://www.wolframscience.com/reference/notes/1019b Thermodynamic History Notes] \u2013 WolframScience.com\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060903071755/http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/courses/classes/E-115/Slides/A_Brief_History_of_Thermodynamics.pdf Brief History of Thermodynamics] \u2013 Berkeley [PDF]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061117114302/http://thermodynamicstudy.net/history.html History of Thermodynamics] \u2013 ThermodynamicStudy.net \n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060831062954/http://che.konyang.ac.kr/COURSE/thermo/history/therm_his.html Historical Background of Thermodynamics] \u2013 Carnegie-Mellon University \n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070701173528/http://www.nt.ntnu.no/users/haugwarb/Presentations/History%20of%20Thermodynamics/ History of Thermodynamics] \u2013 In Pictures\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Thermodynamics}}\n[[Category:History of thermodynamics| ]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: black body \u2192 black-body, 1782-83 \u2192 1782\u201383", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_thermodynamics"}
