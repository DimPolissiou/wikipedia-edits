Westview Press, Boulder, CO.</ref>\n\n=== Ethics ===\nMost agricultural professionals agree that there is a \"moral obligation to pursue [the] goal [of] sustainability.\"<ref name=\"Dundon2009\" /> The major debate comes from what system will provide a path to that goal because if an unsustainable method is used on a large scale it will have a massive negative effect on the environment and human population. \n\n==Factors affecting sustainability==\n[[File:Traditional ploughing - Karnataka.jpg|thumb|left |Traditional farming methods have a low [[carbon footprint]].]]\n\nPractices that can cause long-term damage to [[soil]] include excessive [[Tillage|tilling]] of the soil (leading to [[erosion]]) and [[irrigation]] without adequate drainage (leading to [[Soil salinity|salinization]]).\n\n[[File:Conservation farming 02.jpg |thumb |upright |Conservation farming in [[Zambia]]]]\n\nThe most important factors for a farming site are [[climate]], soil, [[nutrient]]s and [[water resources]]. Of the four, water and [[soil conservation]] are the most amenable to human intervention.\nWhen farmers grow and harvest crops, they remove some nutrients from the soil. Without replenishment, land suffers from [[nutrient depletion]] and becomes either unusable or suffers from reduced [[Crop yield|yields]]. Sustainable agriculture depends on replenishing the soil while minimizing the use or need of non-renewable resources, such as [[natural gas]] or mineral ores.\n\nA farm that is able to \"produce perpetually\", yet has negative effects on environmental quality elsewhere is not sustainable agriculture. An example of a case in which a global view may be warranted is application of [[fertilizer]] or [[manure]], which can improve productivity of a farm but can pollute nearby rivers and coastal waters ([[eutrophication]]). The other extreme can also be undesirable, as the problem of low crop yields due to exhaustion of nutrients in the soil has been related to [[rainforest]] destruction. In Asia, the specific amount of land needed for sustainable farming is about 12.5 acres which includes land for animal fodder, cereal production as cash crop and other food crops. In some cases, a small unit of aquaculture is included (AARI-1996).\n\n===Nutrients===\n====Nitrates====\nPossible sources of [[nitrate]]s that would, in principle, be available indefinitely, include:\n\n#recycling crop waste and [[livestock]] or treated [[humanure|human manure]]\n#growing [[legume]] crops and [[forage]]<nowiki/>s such as [[peanut]]s or [[alfalfa]] that form symbioses with [[nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] [[bacteria]] called [[rhizobia]]\n#industrial production of nitrogen by the [[Haber process]] uses hydrogen, which is currently derived from natural gas (but this hydrogen could instead be made by [[electrolysis]] of water using renewable electricity)\n#genetically engineering (non-legume) crops to form nitrogen-fixing symbioses or fix nitrogen without microbial symbionts.\n\nThe last option was proposed in the 1970s, but is only gradually becoming feasible.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.mongabay.com/bioenergy/2008/03/scientists-discover-genetics-of.html |title=Scientists discover genetics of nitrogen fixation in plants - potential implications for future agriculture |publisher=News.mongabay.com |date=2008-03-08 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref><ref>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, March 25, 2008 vol. 105 no. 12 4928\u20134932 [http://www.pnas.org/content/105/12/4928.full.pdf+html]</ref> Sustainable options for replacing other nutrient inputs such as phosphorus and potassium are more limited.\n\nOther options include [[shifting cultivation|long-term crop rotations]], returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands (returning lost nutrients) such as the [[flooding of the Nile]], the long-term use of [[biochar]], and use of crop and livestock [[landrace]]s that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests, drought, or lack of nutrients.

For irrigation systems to be sustainable, they require proper management (to avoid [[Soil salinity|salinization]]) and must not use more water from their source than is naturally replenishable. Otherwise, the water source effectively becomes a [[non-renewable resource]]. Improvements in water [[well drilling]] technology and [[submersible pump]]s, combined with the development of [[drip irrigation]] and low-pressure pivots, have made it possible to regularly achieve high crop yields in areas where reliance on rainfall alone had previously made successful agriculture unpredictable. However, this progress has come at a price. In many areas, such as the [[Ogallala Aquifer]], the water is being used faster than it can be replenished.\n\nAccording to the UC Davis Agricultural Sustainability Institute, several steps must be taken to develop drought-resistant farming systems even in \"normal\" years with average rainfall.

Sustainable intensification encompasses specific agriculture methods that increase production and at the same time help improve environmental outcomes. The desired outcomes of the farm are achieved without the need for more land cultivation or destruction of natural habitat; the system performance is upgraded with no net environmental cost. Sustainable Intensification has become a priority for the United Nations. Sustainable intensification differs from prior intensification methods by specifically placing importance on broader environmental outcomes. By the year 2018; it was predicted in 100 nations a combined total of 163 million farms used sustainable intensification. The amount of agricultural land covered by this is 453 million ha of land. That amount of land is equal to 29% of farms worldwide.<ref>Pretty. J. (November 23, 2018). Intensification for redesigned and sustainable agriculture systems; http://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6417/eaav0294/tab-pdf</ref> In light of concerns about [[food security]], [[human population]] growth and dwindling land suitable for agriculture, sustainable intensive farming practises are needed to maintain high [[crop yields]], while maintaining [[soil health]] and [[ecosystem services]]. The capacity for ecosystem services to be strong enough to allow a reduction in use of non-renewable inputs whilst maintaining or boosting yields has been the subject of much debate. Recent work in irrigated rice production system of east Asia has suggested that - in relation to pest management at least - promoting the ecosystem service of biological control using nectar plants can reduce the need for insecticides by 70% whilst delivering a 5% yield advantage compared with standard practice.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gurr |first1=Geoff M. |display-authors=etal |title=Multi-country evidence that crop diversification promotes ecological intensification of agriculture |journal=Nature Plants |date=2016 |volume=2 |issue=3 |page=16014 |doi=10.1038/nplants.2016.14 |pmid=27249349}}</ref>\n\n[[Vertical farming]] is a concept with the potential advantages of year-round production, isolation from pests and diseases, controllable resource recycling and reduced transportation costs.<ref name=Marks2014>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129524-100-vertical-farms-sprouting-all-over-the-world/ |title=Vertical farms sprouting all over the world |last=Marks |first=Paul |date=15 January 2014 |work=New Scientist|accessdate=8 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Water===\n[[Water efficiency]] can be improved by reducing the need for [[irrigation]] and using alternative methods.

Westview Press, Boulder, CO.</ref>\n\n=== Ethics ===\nMost agricultural professionals agree that there is a \"moral obligation to pursue [the] goal [of] sustainability.\"<ref name=\"Dundon2009\" /> The major debate comes from what system will provide a path to that goal because if an unsustainable method is used on a large scale it will have a massive negative effect on the environment and human population. \n\n==Factors affecting sustainability==\n[[File:Traditional ploughing - Karnataka.jpg|thumb|left |Traditional farming methods have a low [[carbon footprint]].]]\n\nPractices that can cause long-term damage to [[soil]] include excessive [[Tillage|tilling]] of the soil (leading to [[erosion]]) and [[irrigation]] without adequate drainage (leading to [[Soil salinity|salinization]]).\n\n[[File:Conservation farming 02.jpg |thumb |upright |Conservation farming in [[Zambia]]]]\n\nThe most important factors for a farming site are [[climate]], soil, [[nutrient]]s and [[water resources]]. Of the four, water and [[soil conservation]] are the most amenable to human intervention.\nWhen farmers grow and harvest crops, they remove some nutrients from the soil. Without replenishment, land suffers from [[nutrient depletion]] and becomes either unusable or suffers from reduced [[Crop yield|yields]]. Sustainable agriculture depends on replenishing the soil while minimizing the use or need of non-renewable resources, such as [[natural gas]] or mineral ores.\n\nA farm that is able to \"produce perpetually\", yet has negative effects on environmental quality elsewhere is not sustainable agriculture. An example of a case in which a global view may be warranted is application of [[fertilizer]] or [[manure]], which can improve productivity of a farm but can pollute nearby rivers and coastal waters ([[eutrophication]]). The other extreme can also be undesirable, as the problem of low crop yields due to exhaustion of nutrients in the soil has been related to [[rainforest]] destruction. In Asia, the specific amount of land needed for sustainable farming is about 12.5 acres which includes land for animal fodder, cereal production as cash crop and other food crops. In some cases, a small unit of aquaculture is included (AARI-1996).\n\n===Nutrients===\n====Nitrates====\nPossible sources of [[nitrate]]s that would, in principle, be available indefinitely, include:\n\n#recycling crop waste and [[livestock]] or treated [[humanure|human manure]]\n#growing [[legume]] crops and [[forage]]<nowiki/>s such as [[peanut]]s or [[alfalfa]] that form symbioses with [[nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] [[bacteria]] called [[rhizobia]]\n#industrial production of nitrogen by the [[Haber process]] uses hydrogen, which is currently derived from natural gas (but this hydrogen could instead be made by [[electrolysis]] of water using renewable electricity)\n#genetically engineering (non-legume) crops to form nitrogen-fixing symbioses or fix nitrogen without microbial symbionts.\n\nThe last option was proposed in the 1970s, but is only gradually becoming feasible.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.mongabay.com/bioenergy/2008/03/scientists-discover-genetics-of.html |title=Scientists discover genetics of nitrogen fixation in plants - potential implications for future agriculture |publisher=News.mongabay.com |date=2008-03-08 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref><ref>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, March 25, 2008 vol. 105 no. 12 4928\u20134932 [http://www.pnas.org/content/105/12/4928.full.pdf+html]</ref> Sustainable options for replacing other nutrient inputs such as phosphorus and potassium are more limited.\n\nOther options include [[shifting cultivation|long-term crop rotations]], returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands (returning lost nutrients) such as the [[flooding of the Nile]], the long-term use of [[biochar]], and use of crop and livestock [[landrace]]s that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests, drought, or lack of nutrients.

For irrigation systems to be sustainable, they require proper management (to avoid [[Soil salinity|salinization]]) and must not use more water from their source than is naturally replenishable. Otherwise, the water source effectively becomes a [[non-renewable resource]]. Improvements in water [[well drilling]] technology and [[submersible pump]]s, combined with the development of [[drip irrigation]] and low-pressure pivots, have made it possible to regularly achieve high crop yields in areas where reliance on rainfall alone had previously made successful agriculture unpredictable. However, this progress has come at a price. In many areas, such as the [[Ogallala Aquifer]], the water is being used faster than it can be replenished.\n\nAccording to the UC Davis Agricultural Sustainability Institute, several steps must be taken to develop drought-resistant farming systems even in \"normal\" years with average rainfall.

Sustainable intensification encompasses specific agriculture methods that increase production and at the same time help improve environmental outcomes. The desired outcomes of the farm are achieved without the need for more land cultivation or destruction of natural habitat; the system performance is upgraded with no net environmental cost. Sustainable Intensification has become a priority for the United Nations. Sustainable intensification differs from prior intensification methods by specifically placing importance on broader environmental outcomes. By the year 2018; it was predicted in 100 nations a combined total of 163 million farms used sustainable intensification. The amount of agricultural land covered by this is 453 million ha of land. That amount of land is equal to 29% of farms worldwide.<ref>Pretty. J. (November 23, 2018). Intensification for redesigned and sustainable agriculture systems; http://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6417/eaav0294/tab-pdf</ref> In light of concerns about [[food security]], [[human population]] growth and dwindling land suitable for agriculture, sustainable intensive farming practises are needed to maintain high [[crop yields]], while maintaining [[soil health]] and [[ecosystem services]]. The capacity for ecosystem services to be strong enough to allow a reduction in use of non-renewable inputs whilst maintaining or boosting yields has been the subject of much debate. Recent work in irrigated rice production system of east Asia has suggested that - in relation to pest management at least - promoting the ecosystem service of biological control using nectar plants can reduce the need for insecticides by 70% whilst delivering a 5% yield advantage compared with standard practice.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gurr |first1=Geoff M. |display-authors=etal |title=Multi-country evidence that crop diversification promotes ecological intensification of agriculture |journal=Nature Plants |date=2016 |volume=2 |issue=3 |page=16014 |doi=10.1038/nplants.2016.14 |pmid=27249349}}</ref>\n\n[[Vertical farming]] is a concept with the potential advantages of year-round production, isolation from pests and diseases, controllable resource recycling and reduced transportation costs.<ref name=Marks2014>{{Cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129524-100-vertical-farms-sprouting-all-over-the-world/ |title=Vertical farms sprouting all over the world |last=Marks |first=Paul |date=15 January 2014 |work=New Scientist|accessdate=8 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Water===\n[[Water efficiency]] can be improved by reducing the need for [[irrigation]] and using alternative methods.

In 2011, the Commission on Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change, as part of its recommendations for policy makers on achieving food security in the face of climate change, urged that sustainable agriculture must be integrated into national and international policy.<ref name=\"cgiar\">{{cite web |url=http://ccafs.cgiar.org/sites/default/files/assets/docs/climate_food_commission-spm-nov2011.pdf |title=Achieving food security in the face of climate change: Summary for policy makers from the Commission on Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change |publisher=CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) |date=November 2011}}</ref> The Commission stressed that increasing weather variability and climate shocks will negatively affect agricultural yields, necessitating early action to drive change in agricultural production systems towards increasing resilience.<ref name=cgiar/> It also called for dramatically increased investments in sustainable agriculture in the next decade, including in national research and development budgets, [[land rehabilitation]], economic incentives, and infrastructure improvement.<ref name=cgiar/>\n\nIn the United States, the federal USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service provides technical and financial assistance for those interested in pursuing natural resource conservation along with production agriculture.<ref name=\"nrcs\">{{cite web |author1=Ron Nichols |title=The sustainable solutions at our feet |url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/home/?cid=STELPRDB1251507 |publisher=National Resources Conservation Service, US Department of Agriculture |accessdate=29 October 2019 |date=2019}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most important projects to mitigate climate change with agriculture and adapting agriculture to climate change at the same time, was launched in 2019 by the \"Global EverGreening Alliance\". The initiative was announced in the [[2019 UN Climate Action Summit]]. One of the main methods is [[Agroforestry]]. Another important method is [[Conservation farming]]. One of the targets is to sequester carbon from the atmosphere. By 2050 the restored land should sequestrate 20 billion of carbon annually. The coalition wants, among other, to recover with trees a territory of 5.75 million square kilometres, achieve a health tree - grass balance on a territory of 6.5 million square kilometres and increase carbon capture in a territory of 5 million square kilometres.\n \t\nThe first phase is the \"Grand African Savannah Green Up\" project. Already millions families implemented these methods, and the average territory covered with trees in the farms in [[Sahel]] increased to 16%.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hoffner |first1=Erik |title=Grand African Savannah Green Up': Major $85 Million Project Announced to Scale up Agroforestry in Africa |url=https://www.ecowatch.com/agroforestry-africa-climate-summit-2641102482.html |accessdate=27 October 2019 |agency=Ecowatch |date=October 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Alliance work on the issue of sustainable agriculture since 2012<ref>{{cite web |title=ABOUT US |url=https://www.evergreening.org/alliance-overview/ |website=The Gloibal Evegreening Alliance |accessdate=4 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nAmong 63 farmers interviewed in [[Tasmania]] most accepted the notion climate change was happening, but just a small segment believed that it was human related. Few farmers thought that the issue of climate change was significant enough to diminish what was causing it. Some of the farmers were worried about how a suggested carbon dioxide reduction plan would affect the agricultural sector and were suspicious of numerous government related activities, seeing them as methods in which the government could punish producers.<ref>Fleming, A.

Some foresee a true sustainable [[steady state economy]] that may be very different from today's: greatly reduced energy usage, minimal [[ecological footprint]], fewer [[consumer packaged goods]], [[local purchasing]] with [[short food supply chains]], little [[processed foods]], more home and [[community garden]]s, etc.<ref>{{Cite book | editor-last=McKibben | editor-first=D. | title=The Post Carbon Reader: Managing the 21st Century Sustainability Crisis |publisher=Watershed Media | date=2010 | isbn=978-0-9709500-6-2}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Michael Carolan, a major barrier to the adoption of sustainable agriculture is its appearance of a lack of benefits.

Retrieved 27 August 2019.</ref> In late 2008 the building became the home for ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Observer]]' newspapers.\n\nKings Place houses the first new build public concert hall to be built in central London since the completion of the [[Barbican Centre|Barbican Centre concert hall]] in 1982 ([[Cadogan Hall]] and [[LSO St Luke's]] were adapted from old buildings in that period).\n\nIt has a range of facilities for performance, exhibition and education. The music, arts and restaurant areas are arranged around public spaces which form a central hub to the building. The arts facilities include free access to a range of commercial art galleries. Kings Place is home to [[Aurora Orchestra]] as its Resident Orchestra, and also regularly hosts a number of other Artistic Associates including the [[Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment]] and [[London Sinfonietta]].

Gifted with the performing and back of house spaces on a long lease for a peppercorn rent, KPMF aims to deliver a very rich and busy music programme financed by ticket sales and the hire of the Kings Place facilities for rehearsals, recordings and conferences.\n\nThe Charity works in partnership with music and arts organisations to offer a range of learning and participation activities to the local community and to the wider public. Activities began before the construction of the building finished and are growing steadily year by year. \n\nKPMF offers access to creative spaces and activities for both new and established audiences with affordable prices for all. The KMPF music programme is funded entirely by revenue from ticket sales and income generated through event and conference hire, and without reliance on public funding.\n\n==Location==\nKings Place sits on the east side of [[York Way]], 150 metres from [[London King's Cross railway station|King\u2019s Cross]]/[[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras]] train stations. On its eastern side the building overlooks [[Battlebridge Basin]] on the [[Regent's Canal]] which is also home to many residential boats and the [[London Canal Museum]].\n\n[[Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design|Central St Martins]], one of the art colleges within the [[University of the Arts London]], brought a major visual arts community into the area from mid-2011, when it moved into the nearby Argent\u2019s {{convert|67|acre|m2|adj=on}} [[King's Cross Central]] development.\n\n==Architectural philosophy==\nFollowing a limited architectural competition, [[Dixon Jones]] was appointed as the architect for Kings Place. The brief was for it to be a large building of far higher quality than the normal spec office development. The building was to be durable, not only in terms of quality of the build materials, but in its design. It had to be spatially generous and environmentally impeccable. Most importantly, it had to fit into a local urban architecture which is not uniform in scale.{{cn|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Features==\nThe building has wavy glass runs along the west-facing York Way frontage; this three-layered glass fa\u00e7ade is a free-standing transparent surface made up of hundreds of very slightly curved sheets of glass. As well as reducing heat gain from the afternoon sun and increasing wind resistance, the glass wall provides Kings Place with a distinctive facade.\n\n==Facilities==\n*Hall One \u2013 415-seat concert hall with fixed seating\n*Hall Two \u2013 flexible performance and rehearsal space (seats audience of 200 or 330 standing)\n*St Pancras Room \u2013 auditorium for speech, seating 100\n*Three rehearsal break-out spaces:\n**Limehouse Room\n**Wenlock Room\n**Horsfall Room\n*Recording and broadcasting facilities\n*General dressing rooms\n*Office space and headquarters for London Sinfonietta and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment\n*The Music Base \u2013 shared office space with desks for small music organisations\n*Pangolin London:\n**Sculpture gallery\n\n==Hall One==\nHall One, the main concert hall, is a separate structure within the building, it is a box that sits on rubber springs to give it complete acoustic separation from the rest of the building.\n\nIt is built to a regular geometry, a double cube,  that is considered most successful for small concert halls. Structural columns around the hall are set away from the walls to allow curtains to be drawn between the columns and the walls to modify the acoustics for speech or amplified music.\n\nIt won the \"Commercial and Public Access\" award and the overall \"Gold Award\" in the 2009 [[Wood Awards]].\n\n===Acoustics===\nThe architecture of Hall One emerged from a collaboration between Dixon Jones and Arup\u2019s acousticians. As part of the research that preceded the design, the developer, the architects, the engineers and the project manager visited Japan to look in detail at a dozen concert halls. The aim was to differentiate very precisely between a variety of modern concert halls and to examine what solution would best meet the requirements of Kings Place. Next a computer model of the proposed Kings Place auditorium was made. This was tested against computer models of the [[Concertgebouw]], the [[Wigmore Hall|Wigmore]] and several other halls. In this way it was possible to optimise the design for Hall One before construction began.\n===Oak veneer===\nThe oak veneer inside Hall One has come from the same 500-year-old German oak tree named ''Contessa''. After felling the wood was cut into 5-metre lengths and boiled at 80\u00b0C for one week, then sliced. The tree produced an acre of wood veneer. It has been used in Hall One to cover the panels, columns, roof coffers, the back of seats, and doors.\n\n==Food and drink==\nThe Rotunda Restaurant spans the area of the building facing Regent\u2019s Canal and Battlebridge Basin. The Rotunda Bar features a curved bar that mirrors the shape of the building. The Green & Fortune Caf\u00e9 is housed in the central atrium of the building on the ground floor level. Green & Fortune is responsible for all food, drink, and hospitality at Kings Place.\n\n==Offices==\nAll seven levels above ground at Kings Place are commercial office space. From some angles Kings Place can be seen as four joined but separate structures. This breaking down of the mass of the building was critical to the planners and has allowed light and a sense of openness to penetrate to basement level.\n\nThanks to a series of linking bridges, however, each of the upper floors is experienced by the office user as a very large contiguous plate.\n\nFor the office users no staircase was provided for general use so the only way to access above ground floors is via the lifts. This makes for inconvenience when the lifts break down and reduces the green impact of the building.  The two common staircases have been designed so as only to be available in case of fire.\n\n==Outreach programme==\nKings Place  promotes discovery of the arts in its surrounding boroughs of [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]] and [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]]. The Kings Place outreach programme works in three areas: Education, Community Engagement and Participation and Family. Music and arts organisations resident and performing at Kings Place offer educational classes, workshops, opportunities for participation in performances as well as family events. Past events and projects have included family drumming workshops and professional development sessions with the London Sinfonietta and their visiting musicians from the Ugandan Dance Academy and a visual arts project with local schools and the Visual Learning Foundation using the construction of the building as inspiration.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat}}\n* [http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/ Kings Place website]\n\n{{Coord|51|32|3.63|N|0|7|19.04|W|scale:1563_region:GB|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:2008 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Islington]]\n[[Category:Concert halls in London]]\n[[Category:The Guardian]]\n[[Category:Kings Cross, London]]\n[[Category:Music venues completed in 2008]]\n[[Category:Office buildings completed in 2008]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in the London Borough of Islington]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n{{Use British English|date=September 2013}}\n{{refimprove|date=October 2013}}\n{{Infobox Theatre\n| name        = Kings Place\n| image       = Kings Place from York Way in 2009.jpg\n| image_size  = 265px\n| caption     = Kings Place from [[York Way]]\n| address     = 90, [[York Way]]\n| city        = [[London]]\n| country     = \n| designation = Grade A Commercial\n| architect   = Dixon Jones\n| capacity    = Hall 1: 415 seats<br>Hall 2: 200 seats\n| type        = Classical / Contemporary music, Arts / Cultural venue, Spoken Word, commercial office space, restaurant\n| opened      = 2008\n| production  = \n| currentuse  = \n| website     = {{URL|http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/}}\n}}\n[[File:Kings Place concert hall terrace in 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|Kings Place concert hall terrace]]\n\n'''Kings Place''' is a building in [[London]]\u2019s [[Kings Cross, London|Kings Cross]] area, providing [[Music venue|music]] and [[visual arts]] venues combined with seven floors of office space.

After felling the wood was cut into 5-metre lengths and boiled at 80\u00b0C for one week, then sliced. The tree produced an acre of wood veneer. It has been used in Hall One to cover the panels, columns, roof coffers, the back of seats, and doors.\n\n==Food and drink==\nThe Rotunda Restaurant spans the area of the building facing Regent\u2019s Canal and Battlebridge Basin. The Rotunda Bar features a curved bar that mirrors the shape of the building. The Green & Fortune Caf\u00e9 is housed in the central atrium of the building on the ground floor level. Green & Fortune is responsible for all food, drink, and hospitality at Kings Place.\n\n==Offices==\nAll seven levels above ground at Kings Place are commercial office space. From some angles Kings Place can be seen as four joined but separate structures. This breaking down of the mass of the building was critical to the planners and has allowed light and a sense of openness to penetrate to basement level.\n\nThanks to a series of linking bridges, however, each of the upper floors is experienced by the office user as a very large contiguous plate.\n\nFor the office users no staircase was provided for general use so the only way to access above ground floors is via the lifts. This makes for inconvenience when the lifts break down and reduces the green impact of the building.  The two common staircases have been designed so as only to be available in case of fire.\n\n==Outreach programme==\nKings Place  promotes discovery of the arts in its surrounding boroughs of [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]] and [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]]. The Kings Place outreach programme works in three areas: Education, Community Engagement and Participation and Family. Music and arts organisations resident and performing at Kings Place offer educational classes, workshops, opportunities for participation in performances as well as family events. Past events and projects have included family drumming workshops and professional development sessions with the London Sinfonietta and their visiting musicians from the Ugandan Dance Academy and a visual arts project with local schools and the Visual Learning Foundation using the construction of the building as inspiration.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat}}\n* [http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/ Kings Place website]\n\n{{Coord|51|32|3.63|N|0|7|19.04|W|scale:1563_region:GB|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Islington]]\n[[Category:Concert halls in London]]\n[[Category:Kings Cross, London]]\n[[Category:Music venues completed in 2008]]\n[[Category:Office buildings completed in 2008]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in the London Borough of Islington]]\n[[Category:2008 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:The Guardian]]\n", "name_user": "Headhitter", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:Reordered cats", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_Place"}
