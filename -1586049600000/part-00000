Goofy is a tall, [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog who typically wears a [[turtle neck]] and [[vest]], with pants, shoes, white gloves, and a tall hat originally designed as a rumpled [[fedora]]. Goofy is a close friend of [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Donald Duck]]. He is normally characterized as extremely [[Accident-proneness|clumsy]] and somewhat [[Stupidity|dimwitted]], yet this interpretation is not always definitive; occasionally Goofy is shown as [[intuitive]], and clever, albeit in his own unique, eccentric way.\n\nGoofy debuted in [[animated cartoon]]s, starting in 1932 with ''[[Mickey's Revue]]'' as '''Dippy Dawg''', who is older than Goofy would come to be. Later the same year, he was re-imagined as a younger character, now called Goofy, in the short ''[[The Whoopee Party]]''. During the 1930s, he was used extensively as part of a comedy trio with [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and Donald. Starting in 1939, Goofy was given his own series of shorts that were popular in the 1940s and early 1950s. Two ''Goofy'' shorts were nominated for an Oscar: ''[[How to Play Football]]'' (1944) and ''[[Aquamania]]'' (1961). He also co-starred in a short series with Donald, including ''[[Polar Trappers]]'' (1938), where they first appeared without [[Mickey Mouse]]. Three more ''Goofy'' shorts were produced in the 1960s after which Goofy was only seen in television and [[Disney comics]]. He returned to theatrical animation in 1983 with ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''. His last theatrical appearance was ''[[How to Hook Up Your Home Theater]]'' in 2007. Goofy has also been featured in television, most extensively in ''[[Goof Troop]]'' (1992), ''[[Disney's House of Mouse|House of Mouse]]'' (2001\u20132003), ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'' (2006\u20132016), ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' (2013\u2013present), and ''[[Mickey Mouse: Mixed-Up Adventures|Mickey and the Roadster Racers]]'' (2017\u2013present).\n\nOriginally known as Dippy Dawg, the character is more commonly known simply as \"Goofy\", a name used in his short film series. In his 1950s cartoons, he usually played a character called '''George G. Geef'''. Sources from the ''Goof Troop'' continuity give the character's full name as '''G. G. \"Goofy\" Goof''',<ref>{{cite episode|title=Everything's Coming Up Goofy|series=Goof Troop|airdate=September 5, 1992|season=1 (Disney Afternoon)|number=1}}: Goofy's diploma, as read aloud by the How-to Narrator, refers to him by the formal name of \"Mr. G.

In many other sources, both animated and comics, the surname Goof continues to be used. In other 2000s-era comics, the character's full name has occasionally been given as '''Goofus D. Dawg'''.\n\n==Background==\nAccording to [[Pinto Colvig]], the original voice artist for the character, Goofy was inspired by a \"grinny, half-baked village nitwit\" from his hometown of [[Jacksonville, Oregon]], and he had previously used his mannerisms for a stage character he created named \"The Oregon Appleknocker\". After a discussion with [[Walt Disney]] and director [[Wilfred Jackson]], it was decided that this would be the basis for a new member of the expanding Mickey Mouse cast. Colvig would spend the next day in the recording studio acting out the new cartoon character in front of animator [[Tom Palmer (animator)|Tom Palmer]]. Based on Colvig's \"grotesque poses and expressions\", Palmer would sketch out what would become Goofy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Colvig, Pinto|year=2015|title=It's A Crazy Business: The Goofy Life of a Disney Legend|page=99|editors=Pierce, Todd James; Mclain, Bob|isbn=978-1-941500-49-1}}</ref> Animator [[Art Babbit]] is credited for developing his character. In a 1930s lecture, Babbitt described the character as: \"Think of the Goof as a composite of an everlasting optimist, a gullible [[Good Samaritan]], a half-wit, a shiftless, good-natured colored boy and a hick\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Walt Disney's Goofy: The Good Sport |last=O'Brien |first=Flora |authorlink= |year=1986 |publisher=HPBooks |location=Tucson |isbn=978-0-89586-414-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/waltdisneysgoofy0000unse_x4g6/page/18 18] |url=https://archive.org/details/waltdisneysgoofy0000unse_x4g6/page/18 }}</ref>\n\nIn the comics and his pre-1992 animated appearances, Goofy was usually single and childless.  Unlike Mickey and Donald, he didn't have a steady girlfriend.  The exception was the 1950s cartoons, in which Goofy played a character called George Geef who was married and at one point became the father of a kid named George Junior. In the ''[[Goof Troop]]'' series (1992\u20131993), however, Goofy was portrayed as a single father with a son named [[Max Goof|Max]], and the character of Max made further animated appearances until 2004. This marked a division between animation and comics, as the latter kept showing Goofy as a single childless character, excluding comics taking place in the ''Goof Troop'' continuity. After 2004, Max disappeared from animation, thus removing the division between the two media.

As such, he threatened constantly to terminate the series, but only continued it to provide [[make-work]] for his animators.<ref name=\"micechat\">{{cite web |url=http://micechat.com/forums/news/42925-disneytim-talks-walt-disney-historian-neal-gabler-micechat-news-team-10-29-06-a.html |title=Disneytim Talks with Walt Disney Historian Neal Gabler \u2013 MiceChat News Team, 10/29/06 |publisher=micechat.com |accessdate=July 11, 2014}}</ref> Animation historian [[Michael Barrier (historian)|Michael Barrier]] is skeptical of Gabler's claim, saying that his source did not correspond with what was written.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Commentary/Gabler/GablerErrata.htm |author= Barrier, Michael |date= December 2006 |title= 'Walt Disney's Errors and Ambiguities' |publisher= MichaelBarrier.com |accessdate= May 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Goofy Debut.PNG|left|thumb|250px|Goofy, anonymous in his debut cartoon, ''[[Mickey's Revue]]'' (1932).]]\n\nGoofy first appeared in ''[[Mickey's Revue]]'', first released on May 25, 1932. Directed by [[Wilfred Jackson]] this short movie features [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Minnie Mouse]], [[Horace Horsecollar]] and [[Clarabelle Cow]] performing another song and dance show. Mickey and his gang's animated shorts by this point routinely featured song and dance numbers. It begins as a typical Mickey cartoon of the time, but what would set this short apart from all that had come before was the appearance of a new character, whose behavior served as a running gag. Dippy Dawg, as he was named by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] artists (Frank Webb), was a member of the audience. He constantly irritated his fellow spectators by noisily crunching peanuts and laughing loudly, until two of those fellow spectators knocked him out with their mallets (and then did the same exact laugh as he did). This early version of Goofy had other differences with the later and more developed ones besides the name. He was an old man with a white beard, a puffy tail, and no trousers, shorts, or undergarments. But the short introduced Goofy's distinct laughter. This laughter was provided by [[Pinto Colvig]]. A considerably younger Dippy Dawg then appeared in ''[[The Whoopee Party]]'', first released on September 17, 1932, as a party guest and a friend of Mickey and his gang. Dippy Dawg made a total of four appearances in 1932 and two more in 1933, but most of them were mere [[Cameo appearance|cameos]].\n\nIn the Silly Symphonies cartoon ''[[The Grasshopper and the Ants (film)|The Grasshopper and the Ants]],'' the Grasshopper had an aloof character similar to Goofy and shared the same voice (Pinto Colvig) as the Goofy character.\n\nBy his seventh appearance, in ''[[Orphan's Benefit]]'' first released on August 11, 1934, he gained the new name \"Goofy\" and became a regular member of the gang along with two other new characters: [[Donald Duck]] and [[Clara Cluck]].\n\n===Trio years with Mickey and Donald===\n''[[Mickey's Service Station]]'' directed by [[Ben Sharpsteen]], first released on March 16, 1935, was the first of the classic \"Mickey, Donald, and Goofy\" comedy shorts. Those films had the trio trying to cooperate in performing a certain assignment given to them. Early on they became separated from each other. Then the short's focus started alternating between each of them facing the problems at hand, each in their own way and distinct style of comedy. The end of the short would reunite the three to share the fruits of their efforts, failure more often than success. ''[[Clock Cleaners]]'', first released on October 15, 1937, and ''[[Lonesome Ghosts]]'', first released on December 24, 1937, are usually considered the highlights of this series and animated classics.^_^\n\nProgressively during the series, Mickey's part diminished in favor of Donald, Goofy, and Pluto. The reason for this was simple: Between the easily frustrated Donald and Pluto and the always-living-in-a-world-of-his-own Goofy, Mickey\u2014who became progressively gentler and more laid-back\u2014seemed to act as the [[double act|straight man]] of the trio. The studio's artists found that it had become easier coming up with new gags for Goofy or Donald than Mickey, to a point that Mickey's role had become unnecessary. ''[[Polar Trappers]]'', first released on June 17, 1938, was the first film to feature Goofy and Donald as a duo. The short features the duo as partners and owners of \"Donald and Goofy Trapping Co.\" They have settled in the [[Arctic]] for an unspecified period of time, to capture live [[walrus]]es to bring back to civilization. Their food supplies consist of [[canning|canned]] [[bean]]s. The focus shifts between Goofy trying to set traps for walruses and Donald trying to catch [[penguin]]s to use as food&nbsp;\u2014 both with the same lack of success. Mickey would return in ''[[The Whalers]]'', first released on August 19, 1938, but this and also ''Tugboat Mickey'', released on April 26, 1940, would be the last two shorts to feature all three characters as a team.\n\n===Break off into solo series===\nGoofy next starred at his first solo cartoon ''[[Goofy and Wilbur]]'' directed by [[Dick Huemer]], first released on March 17, 1939. The short featured Goofy fishing with the help of Wilbur, his pet [[grasshopper]].\n\n===The ''How to...'' series===\n[[File:Disney drawing goofy.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Walt Disney|Disney]] drawing Goofy for a group of girls in Argentina, 1941.]]\nIn 1938, one year after his last session as the character, Colvig had a falling out with Disney and left the studio, leaving Goofy without a voice.<ref name=\"Hischak\"/> According to [[Leonard Maltin]], this is what caused the ''How to...'' cartoons of the 1940s in which Goofy had little dialogue, and a narrator (often John McLeish) was used (they would also reuse Colvig's voice in recording or hire a man named Danny Webb to imitate it). In the cartoons, Goofy would demonstrate clumsily but always determined and never frustrated, how to do everything from snow ski to sleeping, to football, to riding a horse. The Goofy ''How to...'' cartoons worked so well that they became a staple format, and are still used in current Goofy shorts, the most recent being the ''How to Hook Up Your Home Theater'', released theatrically in 2007.\n\nLater, starting with ''[[How to Play Baseball]]'' (1942), Goofy starred in a series of cartoons where ''every'' single character in the cartoon was a different version of Goofy. This took Goofy out of the role of just being a clumsy cartoon character and into an Everyman figure. Colvig returned to Disney in 1940 and resumed the voice of Goofy three years later.<ref name=\"Hischak\"/> Many of the Goofy cartoons were directed by [[Jack Kinney]].\n\n===[[World War II]]===\n{{expand section|date=November 2015}}\nDuring World War II Goofy was drafted and became the mascot emblem of the [[602nd Bombardment Squadron]] and the [[756th Air Refueling Squadron|756 Bombardment Squadron]] U.S. Air Corps.\n<gallery>\nFile:602d Bombardment Squadron - Emblem.png|<center>602d Bombardment Squadron emblem (approved 6 March 1944)<ref name=Maurer602BS>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons '', pp. 680-681</ref></center>\nFile:756th Bombardment Squadron - Emblem.png|<center>756th Bombardment Squadron emblem</center>\n</gallery>\n\n===The ''Everyman'' years===\n[[File:Geefgoof.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Goofy in his \"George Geef\" persona in {{nowrap|''Cold War''}} (1951).]]\n\nThe 1950s saw Goofy transformed into a family man going through the trials of everyday life, such as dieting, giving up smoking, and the problems of raising children. Walt Disney himself came up with this idea,<ref>Harry Tytle ''One Of \"Walt's Boys,\"'' (Mission Viejo, 1997) pg 86</ref> hoping it would put personality back into the character that he felt was lost when Goofy was merely a crowd of extras. Goofy is never called \"Goofy\" during this period. While every cartoon continued with the opening, \"''Walt Disney presents Goofy''\" before each cartoon's title, he was usually called \"George Geef\" in the cartoons' dialogue. When the stories featured Goofy as multiple characters, then he had numerous other names as well. In addition, the 1950s Goofy shorts gave Goofy a makeover. He was more intelligent, had smaller eyes with eyebrows, often his whole body was pale instead of just his face (while the rest was black), and sometimes had a normal voice. He even lacked his droopy ears, the external pair of teeth and white gloves in some shorts.\n\nAccording to animation historian Christopher P. Lehman, Disney had started casting Goofy as a [[suburb]]an [[everyman]] in the late 1940s. And with this role came changes in depiction. Goofy's facial stubble and his protruding teeth were removed to give him a more refined look.<ref name=\"Lehman\">Lehman (2007), p. 27-28</ref> His clothing changed from a [[casual attire|casual style]] to wearing [[business suits]]. He began to look more human and less dog-like, with his ears hidden in his hat.<ref name=\"Lehman\"/> By 1951, Goofy was portrayed as being married and having a son of his own. Neither the wife nor the son was portrayed as dog-like. The wife's face was never seen, but her form was human. The son lacked Goofy's dog-like ears.<ref name=\"Lehman\"/>\n\nLehman connects this depiction of the character to Disney's use of humor and animal characters to reinforce social [[conformity]]. He cites as an example ''[[Aquamania]]'' (1961), where everyman Goofy drives to the lake for a boat ride. During a scene depicting a [[Multiple-vehicle collision|pile-up accident]], every car involved has a boat hitched to its rear bumper. Goofy is portrayed as one of the numerous people who had the same idea about how to spend their day. Every contestant in the boat race also looks like Goofy.<ref name=\"Lehman\"/> Lehman does not think that Disney used these aspects of the film to poke fun at conformity. Instead, the studio apparently accepted conformity as a fundamental aspect of the [[society of the United States]].<ref name=\"Lehman\"/> ''Aquamania'' was released in the 1960s, but largely maintained and prolonged the [[status quo]] of the 1950s. The decade had changed but the Disney studio followed the same story formulas for theatrical animated shorts it had followed in the previous decade. And Lehman points that Disney received [[Normative social influence|social approval]] for it. ''Aquamania'' itself received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]].<ref name=\"Lehman\"/>\n\n===Later appearances===\nAfter the 1965 educational film ''Goofy's Freeway Troubles'', Goofy was mostly retired except for cameos, because of the fading popularity, and the death of the voice actor [[Pinto Colvig]]. Goofy had an act in the 1969 tour show, [[Disney on Parade]] with costar [[Herbie|Herbie the Love Bug]]. He only makes a brief appearance in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Amblin Entertainment|Amblin]]'s Academy Award-winning hit ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', in which the titular [[Roger Rabbit]] says of Goofy: \"Nobody takes a whollup like Goofy! What timing! What finesse! What a genius!\". However, he made a comeback in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' as the ghost of Jacob Marley. After that, he appeared in ''[[Sport Goofy in Soccermania]]'' which was originally intended to be released theatrically in 1984 but was aired as a 1987 TV special instead. His popularity then rose again. With Colvig dead, Goofy was then voiced with different voice actors until [[Bill Farmer]] became the official voice.\n\n[[File:Goofymoviemain.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Goofy (right) with his son [[Max Goof|Max]] (left) in ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' (1995)]] \nIn the 1990s, Goofy got his own TV series called ''[[Goof Troop]]''. In the show, Goofy lives with his son [[Max Goof|Max]] and his cat Waffles, and they live next door to [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]] and his family. ''Goof Troop'' eventually led to Goofy and Max starring in their own movies: ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' (in 1995) and ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]'' (in 2000); as well as starring in their own segments of ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'' (in 1999) and ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]'' (in 2004). While Goofy is clearly depicted as a single custodial parent in all of these appearances, by the end of ''An Extremely Goofy Movie'' he begins a romance with the character Sylvia Marpole, Max being grown and in college by this point.\n\nIn one episode of ''[[Bonkers (TV series)|Bonkers]]'', Goofy has an off-screen cameo whose distinctive laugh is \"stolen\" by a disgruntled toon. In another episode, both he and Pete cameo as actors who film cartoons at Wackytoon Studios. And in a third episode, Goofy cameos as part of a group of civilians held hostage in a bank robbery.\n\nGoofy returned to his traditional personality in ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' and appeared as a head waiter in ''[[House of Mouse]]'' (2001 to 2004). Goofy's son [[Max Goof|Max]] also appeared in ''House of Mouse'' as the nightclub's valet, so that Goofy juggled not only his conventional antics but also the father-role displayed in ''Goof Troop'' and its aforementioned related media. In both ''Mickey Mouse Works'' and ''House of Mouse'', Goofy also seemed to have a crush on [[Clarabelle Cow]], as he asks her on a date in the ''House of Mouse'' episode \"Super Goof\" and is stalked by the bovine in the [[Mickey Mouse Works]] cartoon \"How To Be a Spy\". Though Clarabelle was noted as [[Horace Horsecollar]]'s fianc\u00e9 in early decades, comics from the 1960s and 1970s and more recent cartoons like the aforementioned ''House of Mouse'' and ''Mickey Mouse Works'', as well as ''[[Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers]]'', imply some mutual affections between Goofy and Clarabelle; perhaps as an attempt for Disney to give Goofy a more mainstream girlfriend to match his two male co-stars.\n\nOn [[Disney's Toontown Online]], an interactive website for kids, Goofy previously ran his own neighborhood called Goofy Speedway until the close of Toontown. Goofy Speedway was a place where you could race cars and enter the Grand Prix, too. Tickets were exclusively spent on everything there, instead of the usual jellybean currency. The Grand Prix only came on \"Grand Prix Monday\" and \"Silly Saturday\". Goofy's Gag Shop was also found in almost every part of Toontown' except Cog HQs, Goofy Speedway, or Chip & Dale's Acorn Acres. At Goofy's Gag Shop, Toons could buy gags.\n\nGoofy also appears in the [[children's television series]], ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'', with his trademark attire and personality. Goofy appeared in ''[[The Lion King 1\u00bd]]''. Recently, Goofy starred in a new theatrical cartoon short called ''[[How to Hook Up Your Home Theater]]'', that premiered at the [[Ottawa International Animation Festival]]. The short received a positive review from animation historian [[Jerry Beck]]<ref name=\"cartoonbrew\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/events/report-from-ottawa |title=Report from Ottawa: Persepolis and Goofy &#124; Cartoon Brew |publisher=cartoonbrew.com |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204045016/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/events/report-from-ottawa |archivedate=December 4, 2008 }}</ref> and then had a wide release on December 21, 2007, in front of ''[[National Treasure: Book of Secrets]]'' and has aired on several occasions on the Disney Channel.\n\nIn 2011, Goofy appeared in a promotional webtoon advertising [[Disney Cruise Line]].<ref name=\"cartoonbrew2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/advertising/checkin-in-with-goofy.html|title=\"Checkin' In With Goofy\"  &#124; Cartoon Brew|publisher=cartoonbrew.com|accessdate=July 11, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215140838/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/advertising/checkin-in-with-goofy.html|archivedate=February 15, 2012}}</ref> He is also a main character on ''[[Mickey and the Roadster Racers]].''

In the early years, the other members of Mickey Mouse's gang considered him a meddler and a pest but eventually warmed up to him.\n\nThe [[Mickey Mouse (comic strip)|''Mickey Mouse'' comic strip]] drawn by [[Floyd Gottfredson]] was generally based on what was going on in the Mickey Mouse shorts at the time, but when Donald Duck's popularity led to Donald Duck gaining [[Donald Duck (comic strip)|his own newspaper strip]], Disney decided that he was no longer allowed to appear in Gottfredson's strips. Accordingly, Goofy remained alone as Mickey's sidekick, replacing [[Horace Horsecollar]] as Mickey's fellow adventurer and companion. Similarly in comics, the Mickey Mouse world with Goofy as Mickey's sidekick was usually very separate from the Donald Duck world and crossovers were rare.\nGoofy also has a characteristic habit of holding his hand in front of his mouth, a trademark that was introduced by [[Paul Murry]].\n\nA character called \"Glory-Bee\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://users.cwnet.com/xephyr/rich/dzone/hoozoo/glorybee.html |title=Glory-Bee |publisher=Users.cwnet.com |accessdate=2014-08-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313131713/http://users.cwnet.com/xephyr/rich/dzone/hoozoo/glorybee.html |archivedate=2015-03-13 }}</ref> was Goofy's girlfriend for some years.\n\nIn 1990, when Disney was publishing [[Disney Comics (publishing)|their own comics]], Goofy starred in ''[[Goofy Adventures]]'', that featured him starring in various parodies. Unfortunately, perhaps because of poor sales, ''Goofy Adventures'' was the first of the company's titles to be canceled by the Disney Comics Implosion, ending at its 17th issue.\n\n===Super Goof===\n{{Infobox comics character<!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| image         =\n| caption       =\n| character_name = Super Goof\n| real_name     = Goofy\n| publisher     = [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Co.]] (licenser)<br />[[Western Publishing]] (licensee)\n| debut='''First version''': \"The Phantom Blot meets Super Goof\" (''Walt Disney's The Phantom Blot'' #2, Feb. 1965)<br />'''Second version''': \"All's Well that Ends Awful\" (''[[Donald Duck (American comic book)|Donald Duck]]'' #102, July 1965)<br />'''Third and definitive version''': \"The Thief of Zanzipar\" (''Walt Disney Super Goof'' #1, Oct. 1965)\n| creators      = Del Connell (script, first two versions)<br />[[Bob Ogle]] (script, third and definitive version)<br />[[Paul Murry]] (art, all three versions)\n| alliances     = Super Gilbert\n| previous_alliances =\n| aliases      =\n| powers       = Can fly, has x-ray vision, invulnerability, super strength, super speed, superbreath, and other powers\n}}\n\n'''Super Goof''' is Goofy's [[superhero]] alter ego who gets his powers by eating super [[goobers]] (peanuts).

His attire was designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]].]]\n\nGoofy is the captain of the royal guard at Disney Castle in the [[Kingdom Hearts|''Kingdom Hearts'' video game series]]. Averse to using actual weapons, Goofy fights with a shield. Following a letter left by the missing king Mickey Mouse, Goofy and Donald, the court magician, meet [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]] and embark on a quest with him to find the King and Sora's missing friends. In the game series, Goofy still suffers from being the butt of comic relief, but also is the constant voice of optimism and, surprisingly, selectively perceptive, often noticing things others miss and keeping his cool when Sora and Donald lose it. Goofy's loyalty was also tested when Riku wielded the Keyblade thus, following the king's orders, he followed Riku instead. As Riku was about to attack Sora, Goofy used his shield to protect Sora; thus disobeying the king. When Sora, Donald, and Goofy enter the realm known as Timeless River, Goofy states that the world looks familiar; a reference to his cartoons done in the early to mid-1930s. At many times in the'' Kingdom Hearts'' series, Goofy is shown to still be his clumsy self, however, in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', he is very keen to details and has very accurate assumptions of certain things. For example, he was the first to figure out why [[Organization XIII]] was after the [[Beast (Disney character)|Beast]], and he was the first to see through [[Mulan (Disney character)|Fa Mulan]]'s disguise and discovery that Mulan was actually a woman dressed as a male soldier. There were even several instances where Goofy seemed to have more common sense than Sora and Donald, even saying they should \"look before we leap\" when Sora and Donald saw [[Mushu]]'s shadow resembling a dragon, that Sora had mistaken for a Heartless.\n\nGoofy reappears in the prequel, ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep]]'', in a relatively minor role, having accompanied Mickey (along with Donald) to Yen Sid's tower to watch Mickey's Mark of Mastery Exam. Upon realizing that Mickey has been abducted and taken to the Keyblade Graveyard by Master Xehanort in an attempt to lure Ventus out, Goofy and Donald prepare to venture out to rescue Mickey, but as they will obviously be no match for Master Xehanort, Ventus goes alone. Donald and Goofy later care for their King as he recuperates from his injuries.\n\n===In other video games===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}}{{Update section|date=March 2020}}\n\n*Goofy was the star of an early platformer, ''Matterhorn Screamer'' for the [[Apple II]] and [[Commodore 64]].\n\n* Goofy appears as the owner (or perhaps simply the cashier) of the \"Junk\" store in ''[[Donald Duck's Playground]]'', developed and published in the 1980s by Sierra On-Line for the Commodore 64, IBM PC, Apple II, Amiga, and Atari ST.\n\n* Goofy also starred in [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] action game ''[[Goof Troop (video game)|Goof Troop]]'' alongside his son [[Max Goof|Max]] and in ''[[Goofy's Hysterical History Tour]]'' for the [[Sega Genesis]] where he's ahead janitor and he must recover the missing pieces of some museum exhibits.\n\n* Goofy appears briefly in ''[[Quackshot]]'', a Genesis game that starred Donald Duck. Goofy is located within the ancient ruins in Mexico and gives Donald the red plunger (an upgrade to Donald's plunger gun allows the climbing of walls) and a strange note that solves a puzzle in Egypt later in the game.\n\n* He also was in the [[Nintendo GameCube]] and [[Game Boy Advance]] game ''[[Disney's Party]]'' as one of the playable characters.\n\n* Two games for kids were released: ''[[Goofy's Fun House]]'' for the [[PlayStation]] and ''Goofy's Railway Express'' for the [[Commodore 64]].\n\n* He also appears 2001 in ''[[Disney's Extremely Goofy Skateboarding]]'' for [[Personal computer|PC]].\n\n* Goofy is a playable character in ''[[Disney TH!NK Fast]]''.\n\n* Concept art for Goofy was made for his appearance in the 2009 & 2010 [[Wii]] game, ''[[Epic Mickey]]''. He appears as one of the \"buddies\" that the Mad Doctor creates for [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] to replicate the facade of Mickey Mouse's success. A variation of him seems to appear as a minor shopkeeper named Tiki Sam.\n\n* Goofy briefly appears in ''[[Disney's Magical Quest]]'' for Super NES, released in 1992.\n\n* As noted above, Goofy appears in Disney's online game ''[[Toontown Online]]''.\n\n* Goofy was also a playable character in ''[[Disney Golf]]'' for the PS2.\n\n* Goofy is one the eight playable racers in the [[GBA]] game ''Disney Kart: Circuit Tour''.\n\n==Voice actors==\n[[Pinto Colvig]] voiced Goofy for most of his classic appearances from 1932 (''[[Mickey's Revue]]'') to 1938 (''[[The Whalers]]'') when he had a fallout with Disney and left the company to work on other projects. He was later replaced by Danny Webb from 1939 to 1941.<ref name=Canemaker/> However, Colvig returned to Disney and resumed the role in 1944 (''How to Be a Sailor'') until shortly before his death in 1967.

Aside from those occasions, [[Bill Farmer]] has been voicing Goofy since 1987. While Pope was the sole voice credit for Goofy in ''Roger Rabbit'', Farmer actually provided some of Goofy's lines in the movie as well.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhpr84WzJLg 2011 Disneyana Fan Club Convention Highlight: Voice Panel]</ref> Farmer closely imitated Colvig for projects like ''[[The Prince and the Pauper (1990 film)|The Prince and the Pauper]]'' but began putting his own spin on the character in 1992's ''[[Goof Troop]]''. Farmer also inherited Colvig's other characters, like [[Pluto (Disney character)|Pluto]], [[Sleepy (character)|Sleepy]], and [[Practical Pig]].\n\n==Relatives==\n\n===Max Goof===\n{{Main|Max Goof}}\n\nMax Goof is Goofy's teenage son. He first appeared in the 1992 television series ''[[Goof Troop]]'' and stars in both the spin-off film ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' (1995) and its [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]] ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]'' (2000). He also features in the direct-to-video ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'' (1999), its sequel ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]'' (2004), and the 2001 TV series ''[[House of Mouse]]''. Max is a [[playable character]] on the [[Super NES]] video game ''[[Goof Troop]]'' (1993), the [[PlayStation 2]] video game ''Disney Golf'' (2002), and the [[Personal computer|PC]] video game ''[[Disney's Extremely Goofy Skateboarding]]'' (2001).\n\nMax is one of the few Disney characters aside from his best friend [[Pete Junior|P.J.]] and [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]], child or otherwise, who has actually aged in subsequent appearances. He was depicted as an eleven-year-old middle school student in ''[[Goof Troop]]'', then a high school student in ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'', and then a high school graduate teenager starting college in ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]''. In ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'', he is still a teenager but old enough to be employed as a [[valet parking|parking valet]].\n\n==Goofy holler==\nThe Goofy holler is a [[stock sound effect]] that is used frequently in [[Walt Disney]] cartoons and films. It is the cry Goofy makes when falling or being launched into the air, that can be transcribed as \"Yaaaaaaa-hoo-hoo-hoo-hooey!\" The holler was originally recorded by [[yodeling|yodeller]] [[Hannes Schroll|Hann\u00e8s Schroll]] for the 1941 short ''[[The Art of Skiing]]''. Some sources claim that Schrolle was not paid for the recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/chris_barry/archive/2007/05/04/splash-mountain-space-mountain-big-thunder-mountain-mount-disney.aspx |title=Barry, Chris |publisher=JimHillMedia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-17}}</ref> [[Bill Farmer]], the current voice of Goofy, demonstrated the \"Goofy Holler\" in the Disney Treasures DVD ''The Complete Goofy''. He also does this in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' games.\n\nThe holler is also used in films and cartoons in which Goofy does not appear, generally in situations that are particularly \"goofy\" (examples include ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'', ''[[Pete's Dragon (1977 film)|Pete's Dragon]]'', ''[[The Rescuers]]'', ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', ''[[Home on the Range (2004 film)|Home on the Range]]'', ''[[Enchanted (2007 film)|Enchanted]]'', and ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'').\n\nIn a ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' episode titled \"The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne\", the Joker performs the holler when the plane crashes toward a canyon.\n\nIn the \"Wacky Delly\" episode of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', the holler is heard at the end of the haphazardly made cartoon created by [[Rocko]], [[Heffer Wolfe]], and [[Filburt]] for Ralph Bighead.\n\nA version of the holler is used in a cutaway in the \"[[Dial Meg for Murder]]\" episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' when Goofy is cast into [[Hell]] for causing [[September 11 attacks|9/11]].\n\nThe term \"Goofy Holler\" was first created by a user of the [[Internet Movie Database]] and originated on the trivia page for ''[[A Goofy Movie]]''.

Goofy is a tall, [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog who typically wears a [[turtle neck]] and [[vest]], with pants, shoes, white gloves, and a tall hat originally designed as a rumpled [[fedora]]. Goofy is a close friend of [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Donald Duck]]. He is normally characterized as extremely [[Accident-proneness|clumsy]] and somewhat [[Stupidity|dimwitted]], yet this interpretation is not always definitive; occasionally Goofy is shown as [[intuitive]], and clever, albeit in his own unique, eccentric way.\n\nGoofy debuted in [[animated cartoon]]s, starting in 1932 with ''[[Mickey's Revue]]'' as '''Dippy Dawg''', who is older than Goofy would come to be. Later the same year, he was re-imagined as a younger character, now called Goofy, in the short ''[[The Whoopee Party]]''. During the 1930s, he was used extensively as part of a comedy trio with [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] and Donald. Starting in 1939, Goofy was given his own series of shorts that were popular in the 1940s and early 1950s. Two ''Goofy'' shorts were nominated for an Oscar: ''[[How to Play Football]]'' (1944) and ''[[Aquamania]]'' (1961). He also co-starred in a short series with Donald, including ''[[Polar Trappers]]'' (1938), where they first appeared without [[Mickey Mouse]]. Three more ''Goofy'' shorts were produced in the 1960s after which Goofy was only seen in television and [[Disney comics]]. He returned to theatrical animation in 1983 with ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]''. His last theatrical appearance was ''[[How to Hook Up Your Home Theater]]'' in 2007. Goofy has also been featured in television, most extensively in ''[[Goof Troop]]'' (1992), ''[[Disney's House of Mouse|House of Mouse]]'' (2001\u20132003), ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'' (2006\u20132016), ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' (2013\u2013present), and ''[[Mickey Mouse: Mixed-Up Adventures|Mickey and the Roadster Racers]]'' (2017\u2013present).\n\nOriginally known as Dippy Dawg, the character is more commonly known simply as \"Goofy\", a name used in his short film series. In his 1950s cartoons, he usually played a character called '''George G. Geef'''. Sources from the ''Goof Troop'' continuity give the character's full name as '''G. G. \"Goofy\" Goof''',<ref>{{cite episode|title=Everything's Coming Up Goofy|series=Goof Troop|airdate=September 5, 1992|season=1 (Disney Afternoon)|number=1}}: Goofy's diploma, as read aloud by the How-to Narrator, refers to him by the formal name of \"Mr. G.

In many other sources, both animated and comics, the surname Goof continues to be used. In other 2000s-era comics, the character's full name has occasionally been given as '''Goofus D. Dawg'''.\n\n==Background==\nAccording to [[Pinto Colvig]], the original voice artist for the character, Goofy was inspired by a \"grinny, half-baked village nitwit\" from his hometown of [[Jacksonville, Oregon]], and he had previously used his mannerisms for a stage character he created named \"The Oregon Appleknocker\". After a discussion with [[Walt Disney]] and director [[Wilfred Jackson]], it was decided that this would be the basis for a new member of the expanding Mickey Mouse cast. Colvig would spend the next day in the recording studio acting out the new cartoon character in front of animator [[Tom Palmer (animator)|Tom Palmer]]. Based on Colvig's \"grotesque poses and expressions\", Palmer would sketch out what would become Goofy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Colvig, Pinto|year=2015|title=It's A Crazy Business: The Goofy Life of a Disney Legend|page=99|editors=Pierce, Todd James; Mclain, Bob|isbn=978-1-941500-49-1}}</ref> Animator [[Art Babbit]] is credited for developing his character. In a 1930s lecture, Babbitt described the character as: \"Think of the Goof as a composite of an everlasting optimist, a gullible [[Good Samaritan]], a half-wit, a shiftless, good-natured colored boy and a hick\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Walt Disney's Goofy: The Good Sport |last=O'Brien |first=Flora |authorlink= |year=1986 |publisher=HPBooks |location=Tucson |isbn=978-0-89586-414-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/waltdisneysgoofy0000unse_x4g6/page/18 18] |url=https://archive.org/details/waltdisneysgoofy0000unse_x4g6/page/18 }}</ref>\n\nIn the comics and his pre-1992 animated appearances, Goofy was usually single and childless.  Unlike Mickey and Donald, he didn't have a steady girlfriend.  The exception was the 1950s cartoons, in which Goofy played a character called George Geef who was married and at one point became the father of a kid named George Junior. In the ''[[Goof Troop]]'' series (1992\u20131993), however, Goofy was portrayed as a single father with a son named [[Max Goof|Max]], and the character of Max made further animated appearances until 2004. This marked a division between animation and comics, as the latter kept showing Goofy as a single childless character, excluding comics taking place in the ''Goof Troop'' continuity. After 2004, Max disappeared from animation, thus removing the division between the two media. Goofy's wife was never shown, while George Geef's wife appeared\u2014[[Unseen character|but always with her face unseen]]\u2014in 1950s-produced cartoon shorts depicting the character as a \"family man\".<ref>Officially, Disney's Guest Services once declared there to be \"no definitive answer\" as to \"who Max's mother is and where \"Mrs. Goofy\" went\", leaving her fate up to unofficial speculation and presumption. {{cite web|url=http://home.disney.go.com/guestservices/faq?id=mnf12 |title=Disney FAQ: Who was the mother of Goofy's son Max? |publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]] |accessdate=2014-07-31 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810155058/http://home.disney.go.com/guestservices/faq?id=mnf12 |archivedate=2014-08-10 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Disneyland IMG 3970.jpg|thumb|right|Goofy's house at [[Disneyland]].]]\n\nIn the comics, Goofy usually appears as Mickey's sidekick, though he also is occasionally shown as a protagonist.<ref>[https://inducks.org/comp2.php?code=&keyw=&keywt=i&exactpg=&pg1=&pg2=&bro2=&bro3=&exactparts=&parts1=&parts2=&kind=nk&rowsperpage=0&columnsperpage=0&hero=&xapp=Goofy&univ=&xa2=&creat=&creat2=&plot=&plot2=&writ=&writ2=&art=&art2=&ink=&ink2=&excludeCZ=on&pub1=1900&pub2=&ser=&xref=&mref=&xrefd=&repabb=&repabbc=al&imgmode=0&vdesc2=on&vdesc=en&vus=on&sort1=s.firstpublicationdate Chronological list of Goofy's appearances in comics] according to the [[INDUCKS]] database.

As such, he threatened constantly to terminate the series, but only continued it to provide [[make-work]] for his animators.<ref name=\"micechat\">{{cite web |url=http://micechat.com/forums/news/42925-disneytim-talks-walt-disney-historian-neal-gabler-micechat-news-team-10-29-06-a.html |title=Disneytim Talks with Walt Disney Historian Neal Gabler \u2013 MiceChat News Team, 10/29/06 |publisher=micechat.com |accessdate=July 11, 2014}}</ref> Animation historian [[Michael Barrier (historian)|Michael Barrier]] is skeptical of Gabler's claim, saying that his source did not correspond with what was written.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.michaelbarrier.com/Commentary/Gabler/GablerErrata.htm |author= Barrier, Michael |date= December 2006 |title= 'Walt Disney's Errors and Ambiguities' |publisher= MichaelBarrier.com |accessdate= May 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Goofy Debut.PNG|left|thumb|250px|Goofy, anonymous in his debut cartoon, ''[[Mickey's Revue]]'' (1932).]]\n\nGoofy first appeared in ''[[Mickey's Revue]]'', first released on May 25, 1932. Directed by [[Wilfred Jackson]] this short movie features [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Minnie Mouse]], [[Horace Horsecollar]] and [[Clarabelle Cow]] performing another song and dance show. Mickey and his gang's animated shorts by this point routinely featured song and dance numbers. It begins as a typical Mickey cartoon of the time, but what would set this short apart from all that had come before was the appearance of a new character, whose behavior served as a running gag. Dippy Dawg, as he was named by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] artists (Frank Webb), was a member of the audience. He constantly irritated his fellow spectators by noisily crunching peanuts and laughing loudly, until two of those fellow spectators knocked him out with their mallets (and then did the same exact laugh as he did). This early version of Goofy had other differences with the later and more developed ones besides the name. He was an old man with a white beard, a puffy tail, and no trousers, shorts, or undergarments. But the short introduced Goofy's distinct laughter. This laughter was provided by [[Pinto Colvig]]. A considerably younger Dippy Dawg then appeared in ''[[The Whoopee Party]]'', first released on September 17, 1932, as a party guest and a friend of Mickey and his gang. Dippy Dawg made a total of four appearances in 1932 and two more in 1933, but most of them were mere [[Cameo appearance|cameos]].\n\nIn the Silly Symphonies cartoon ''[[The Grasshopper and the Ants (film)|The Grasshopper and the Ants]],'' the Grasshopper had an aloof character similar to Goofy and shared the same voice (Pinto Colvig) as the Goofy character.\n\nBy his seventh appearance, in ''[[Orphan's Benefit]]'' first released on August 11, 1934, he gained the new name \"Goofy\" and became a regular member of the gang along with two other new characters: [[Donald Duck]] and [[Clara Cluck]].\n\n===Trio years with Mickey and Donald===\n''[[Mickey's Service Station]]'' directed by [[Ben Sharpsteen]], first released on March 16, 1935, was the first of the classic \"Mickey, Donald, and Goofy\" comedy shorts. Those films had the trio trying to cooperate in performing a certain assignment given to them. Early on they became separated from each other. Then the short's focus started alternating between each of them facing the problems at hand, each in their own way and distinct style of comedy. The end of the short would reunite the three to share the fruits of their efforts, failure more often than success. ''[[Clock Cleaners]]'', first released on October 15, 1937, and ''[[Lonesome Ghosts]]'', first released on December 24, 1937, are usually considered the highlights of this series and animated classics.\n\nProgressively during the series, Mickey's part diminished in favor of Donald, Goofy, and Pluto. The reason for this was simple: Between the easily frustrated Donald and Pluto and the always-living-in-a-world-of-his-own Goofy, Mickey\u2014who became progressively gentler and more laid-back\u2014seemed to act as the [[double act|straight man]] of the trio. The studio's artists found that it had become easier coming up with new gags for Goofy or Donald than Mickey, to a point that Mickey's role had become unnecessary. ''[[Polar Trappers]]'', first released on June 17, 1938, was the first film to feature Goofy and Donald as a duo. The short features the duo as partners and owners of \"Donald and Goofy Trapping Co.\" They have settled in the [[Arctic]] for an unspecified period of time, to capture live [[walrus]]es to bring back to civilization. Their food supplies consist of [[canning|canned]] [[bean]]s. The focus shifts between Goofy trying to set traps for walruses and Donald trying to catch [[penguin]]s to use as food&nbsp;\u2014 both with the same lack of success. Mickey would return in ''[[The Whalers]]'', first released on August 19, 1938, but this and also ''Tugboat Mickey'', released on April 26, 1940, would be the last two shorts to feature all three characters as a team.\n\n===Break off into solo series===\nGoofy next starred at his first solo cartoon ''[[Goofy and Wilbur]]'' directed by [[Dick Huemer]], first released on March 17, 1939. The short featured Goofy fishing with the help of Wilbur, his pet [[grasshopper]].\n\n===The ''How to...'' series===\n[[File:Disney drawing goofy.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Walt Disney|Disney]] drawing Goofy for a group of girls in Argentina, 1941.]]\nIn 1938, one year after his last session as the character, Colvig had a falling out with Disney and left the studio, leaving Goofy without a voice.<ref name=\"Hischak\"/> According to [[Leonard Maltin]], this is what caused the ''How to...'' cartoons of the 1940s in which Goofy had little dialogue, and a narrator (often John McLeish) was used (they would also reuse Colvig's voice in recording or hire a man named Danny Webb to imitate it). In the cartoons, Goofy would demonstrate clumsily but always determined and never frustrated, how to do everything from snow ski to sleeping, to football, to riding a horse. The Goofy ''How to...'' cartoons worked so well that they became a staple format, and are still used in current Goofy shorts, the most recent being the ''How to Hook Up Your Home Theater'', released theatrically in 2007.\n\nLater, starting with ''[[How to Play Baseball]]'' (1942), Goofy starred in a series of cartoons where ''every'' single character in the cartoon was a different version of Goofy. This took Goofy out of the role of just being a clumsy cartoon character and into an Everyman figure. Colvig returned to Disney in 1940 and resumed the voice of Goofy three years later.<ref name=\"Hischak\"/> Many of the Goofy cartoons were directed by [[Jack Kinney]].\n\n===[[World War II]]===\n{{expand section|date=November 2015}}\nDuring World War II Goofy was drafted and became the mascot emblem of the [[602nd Bombardment Squadron]] and the [[756th Air Refueling Squadron|756 Bombardment Squadron]] U.S. Air Corps.\n<gallery>\nFile:602d Bombardment Squadron - Emblem.png|<center>602d Bombardment Squadron emblem (approved 6 March 1944)<ref name=Maurer602BS>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons '', pp. 680-681</ref></center>\nFile:756th Bombardment Squadron - Emblem.png|<center>756th Bombardment Squadron emblem</center>\n</gallery>\n\n===The ''Everyman'' years===\n[[File:Geefgoof.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Goofy in his \"George Geef\" persona in {{nowrap|''Cold War''}} (1951).]]\n\nThe 1950s saw Goofy transformed into a family man going through the trials of everyday life, such as dieting, giving up smoking, and the problems of raising children. Walt Disney himself came up with this idea,<ref>Harry Tytle ''One Of \"Walt's Boys,\"'' (Mission Viejo, 1997) pg 86</ref> hoping it would put personality back into the character that he felt was lost when Goofy was merely a crowd of extras. Goofy is never called \"Goofy\" during this period. While every cartoon continued with the opening, \"''Walt Disney presents Goofy''\" before each cartoon's title, he was usually called \"George Geef\" in the cartoons' dialogue. When the stories featured Goofy as multiple characters, then he had numerous other names as well. In addition, the 1950s Goofy shorts gave Goofy a makeover. He was more intelligent, had smaller eyes with eyebrows, often his whole body was pale instead of just his face (while the rest was black), and sometimes had a normal voice. He even lacked his droopy ears, the external pair of teeth and white gloves in some shorts.\n\nAccording to animation historian Christopher P. Lehman, Disney had started casting Goofy as a [[suburb]]an [[everyman]] in the late 1940s. And with this role came changes in depiction. Goofy's facial stubble and his protruding teeth were removed to give him a more refined look.<ref name=\"Lehman\">Lehman (2007), p. 27-28</ref> His clothing changed from a [[casual attire|casual style]] to wearing [[business suits]]. He began to look more human and less dog-like, with his ears hidden in his hat.<ref name=\"Lehman\"/> By 1951, Goofy was portrayed as being married and having a son of his own. Neither the wife nor the son was portrayed as dog-like. The wife's face was never seen, but her form was human. The son lacked Goofy's dog-like ears.<ref name=\"Lehman\"/>\n\nLehman connects this depiction of the character to Disney's use of humor and animal characters to reinforce social [[conformity]]. He cites as an example ''[[Aquamania]]'' (1961), where everyman Goofy drives to the lake for a boat ride. During a scene depicting a [[Multiple-vehicle collision|pile-up accident]], every car involved has a boat hitched to its rear bumper. Goofy is portrayed as one of the numerous people who had the same idea about how to spend their day. Every contestant in the boat race also looks like Goofy.<ref name=\"Lehman\"/> Lehman does not think that Disney used these aspects of the film to poke fun at conformity. Instead, the studio apparently accepted conformity as a fundamental aspect of the [[society of the United States]].<ref name=\"Lehman\"/> ''Aquamania'' was released in the 1960s, but largely maintained and prolonged the [[status quo]] of the 1950s. The decade had changed but the Disney studio followed the same story formulas for theatrical animated shorts it had followed in the previous decade. And Lehman points that Disney received [[Normative social influence|social approval]] for it. ''Aquamania'' itself received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]].<ref name=\"Lehman\"/>\n\n===Later appearances===\nAfter the 1965 educational film ''Goofy's Freeway Troubles'', Goofy was mostly retired except for cameos, because of the fading popularity, and the death of the voice actor [[Pinto Colvig]]. Goofy had an act in the 1969 tour show, [[Disney on Parade]] with costar [[Herbie|Herbie the Love Bug]]. He only makes a brief appearance in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]/[[Amblin Entertainment|Amblin]]'s Academy Award-winning hit ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', in which the titular [[Roger Rabbit]] says of Goofy: \"Nobody takes a whollup like Goofy! What timing! What finesse! What a genius!\". However, he made a comeback in ''[[Mickey's Christmas Carol]]'' as the ghost of Jacob Marley. After that, he appeared in ''[[Sport Goofy in Soccermania]]'' which was originally intended to be released theatrically in 1984 but was aired as a 1987 TV special instead. His popularity then rose again. With Colvig dead, Goofy was then voiced with different voice actors until [[Bill Farmer]] became the official voice.\n\n[[File:Goofymoviemain.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Goofy (right) with his son [[Max Goof|Max]] (left) in ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' (1995)]] \nIn the 1990s, Goofy got his own TV series called ''[[Goof Troop]]''. In the show, Goofy lives with his son [[Max Goof|Max]] and his cat Waffles, and they live next door to [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]] and his family. ''Goof Troop'' eventually led to Goofy and Max starring in their own movies: ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' (in 1995) and ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]'' (in 2000); as well as starring in their own segments of ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'' (in 1999) and ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]'' (in 2004). While Goofy is clearly depicted as a single custodial parent in all of these appearances, by the end of ''An Extremely Goofy Movie'' he begins a romance with the character Sylvia Marpole, Max being grown and in college by this point.\n\nIn one episode of ''[[Bonkers (TV series)|Bonkers]]'', Goofy has an off-screen cameo whose distinctive laugh is \"stolen\" by a disgruntled toon. In another episode, both he and Pete cameo as actors who film cartoons at Wackytoon Studios. And in a third episode, Goofy cameos as part of a group of civilians held hostage in a bank robbery.\n\nGoofy returned to his traditional personality in ''[[Mickey Mouse Works]]'' and appeared as a head waiter in ''[[House of Mouse]]'' (2001 to 2004). Goofy's son [[Max Goof|Max]] also appeared in ''House of Mouse'' as the nightclub's valet, so that Goofy juggled not only his conventional antics but also the father-role displayed in ''Goof Troop'' and its aforementioned related media. In both ''Mickey Mouse Works'' and ''House of Mouse'', Goofy also seemed to have a crush on [[Clarabelle Cow]], as he asks her on a date in the ''House of Mouse'' episode \"Super Goof\" and is stalked by the bovine in the [[Mickey Mouse Works]] cartoon \"How To Be a Spy\". Though Clarabelle was noted as [[Horace Horsecollar]]'s fianc\u00e9 in early decades, comics from the 1960s and 1970s and more recent cartoons like the aforementioned ''House of Mouse'' and ''Mickey Mouse Works'', as well as ''[[Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers]]'', imply some mutual affections between Goofy and Clarabelle; perhaps as an attempt for Disney to give Goofy a more mainstream girlfriend to match his two male co-stars.\n\nOn [[Disney's Toontown Online]], an interactive website for kids, Goofy previously ran his own neighborhood called Goofy Speedway until the close of Toontown. Goofy Speedway was a place where you could race cars and enter the Grand Prix, too. Tickets were exclusively spent on everything there, instead of the usual jellybean currency. The Grand Prix only came on \"Grand Prix Monday\" and \"Silly Saturday\". Goofy's Gag Shop was also found in almost every part of Toontown' except Cog HQs, Goofy Speedway, or Chip & Dale's Acorn Acres. At Goofy's Gag Shop, Toons could buy gags.\n\nGoofy also appears in the [[children's television series]], ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]]'', with his trademark attire and personality. Goofy appeared in ''[[The Lion King 1\u00bd]]''. Recently, Goofy starred in a new theatrical cartoon short called ''[[How to Hook Up Your Home Theater]]'', that premiered at the [[Ottawa International Animation Festival]]. The short received a positive review from animation historian [[Jerry Beck]]<ref name=\"cartoonbrew\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/events/report-from-ottawa |title=Report from Ottawa: Persepolis and Goofy &#124; Cartoon Brew |publisher=cartoonbrew.com |accessdate=July 11, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204045016/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/events/report-from-ottawa |archivedate=December 4, 2008 }}</ref> and then had a wide release on December 21, 2007, in front of ''[[National Treasure: Book of Secrets]]'' and has aired on several occasions on the Disney Channel.\n\nIn 2011, Goofy appeared in a promotional webtoon advertising [[Disney Cruise Line]].<ref name=\"cartoonbrew2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonbrew.com/advertising/checkin-in-with-goofy.html|title=\"Checkin' In With Goofy\"  &#124; Cartoon Brew|publisher=cartoonbrew.com|accessdate=July 11, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215140838/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/advertising/checkin-in-with-goofy.html|archivedate=February 15, 2012}}</ref> He is also a main character on ''[[Mickey and the Roadster Racers]].''

In the early years, the other members of Mickey Mouse's gang considered him a meddler and a pest but eventually warmed up to him.\n\nThe [[Mickey Mouse (comic strip)|''Mickey Mouse'' comic strip]] drawn by [[Floyd Gottfredson]] was generally based on what was going on in the Mickey Mouse shorts at the time, but when Donald Duck's popularity led to Donald Duck gaining [[Donald Duck (comic strip)|his own newspaper strip]], Disney decided that he was no longer allowed to appear in Gottfredson's strips. Accordingly, Goofy remained alone as Mickey's sidekick, replacing [[Horace Horsecollar]] as Mickey's fellow adventurer and companion. Similarly in comics, the Mickey Mouse world with Goofy as Mickey's sidekick was usually very separate from the Donald Duck world and crossovers were rare.\nGoofy also has a characteristic habit of holding his hand in front of his mouth, a trademark that was introduced by [[Paul Murry]].\n\nA character called \"Glory-Bee\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://users.cwnet.com/xephyr/rich/dzone/hoozoo/glorybee.html |title=Glory-Bee |publisher=Users.cwnet.com |accessdate=2014-08-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313131713/http://users.cwnet.com/xephyr/rich/dzone/hoozoo/glorybee.html |archivedate=2015-03-13 }}</ref> was Goofy's girlfriend for some years.\n\nIn 1990, when Disney was publishing [[Disney Comics (publishing)|their own comics]], Goofy starred in ''[[Goofy Adventures]]'', that featured him starring in various parodies. Unfortunately, perhaps because of poor sales, ''Goofy Adventures'' was the first of the company's titles to be canceled by the Disney Comics Implosion, ending at its 17th issue.\n\n===Super Goof===\n{{Infobox comics character<!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| image         =\n| caption       =\n| character_name = Super Goof\n| real_name     = Goofy\n| publisher     = [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Co.]] (licenser)<br />[[Western Publishing]] (licensee)\n| debut='''First version''': \"The Phantom Blot meets Super Goof\" (''Walt Disney's The Phantom Blot'' #2, Feb. 1965)<br />'''Second version''': \"All's Well that Ends Awful\" (''[[Donald Duck (American comic book)|Donald Duck]]'' #102, July 1965)<br />'''Third and definitive version''': \"The Thief of Zanzipar\" (''Walt Disney Super Goof'' #1, Oct. 1965)\n| creators      = Del Connell (script, first two versions)<br />[[Bob Ogle]] (script, third and definitive version)<br />[[Paul Murry]] (art, all three versions)\n| alliances     = Super Gilbert\n| previous_alliances =\n| aliases      =\n| powers       = Can fly, has x-ray vision, invulnerability, super strength, super speed, superbreath, and other powers\n}}\n\n'''Super Goof''' is Goofy's [[superhero]] alter ego who gets his powers by eating super [[goobers]] (peanuts).

In the Disney Channel ''[[Mickey Mouse (2013 TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' TV series, Goofy dresses as Super Goof for the half-hour Halloween special.\n\n==In video games==\n\n===''Kingdom Hearts'' series===\n[[File:Goofyll8.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Goofy, as he appears in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series. His attire was designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]].]]\n\nGoofy is the captain of the royal guard at Disney Castle in the [[Kingdom Hearts|''Kingdom Hearts'' video game series]]. Averse to using actual weapons, Goofy fights with a shield. Following a letter left by the missing king Mickey Mouse, Goofy and Donald, the court magician, meet [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]] and embark on a quest with him to find the King and Sora's missing friends. In the game series, Goofy still suffers from being the butt of comic relief, but also is the constant voice of optimism and, surprisingly, selectively perceptive, often noticing things others miss and keeping his cool when Sora and Donald lose it. Goofy's loyalty was also tested when Riku wielded the Keyblade thus, following the king's orders, he followed Riku instead. As Riku was about to attack Sora, Goofy used his shield to protect Sora; thus disobeying the king. When Sora, Donald, and Goofy enter the realm known as Timeless River, Goofy states that the world looks familiar; a reference to his cartoons done in the early to mid-1930s. At many times in the'' Kingdom Hearts'' series, Goofy is shown to still be his clumsy self, however, in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', he is very keen to details and has very accurate assumptions of certain things. For example, he was the first to figure out why [[Organization XIII]] was after the [[Beast (Disney character)|Beast]], and he was the first to see through [[Mulan (Disney character)|Fa Mulan]]'s disguise and discovery that Mulan was actually a woman dressed as a male soldier. There were even several instances where Goofy seemed to have more common sense than Sora and Donald, even saying they should \"look before we leap\" when Sora and Donald saw [[Mushu]]'s shadow resembling a dragon, that Sora had mistaken for a Heartless.\n\nGoofy reappears in the prequel, ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep]]'', in a relatively minor role, having accompanied Mickey (along with Donald) to Yen Sid's tower to watch Mickey's Mark of Mastery Exam. Upon realizing that Mickey has been abducted and taken to the Keyblade Graveyard by Master Xehanort in an attempt to lure Ventus out, Goofy and Donald prepare to venture out to rescue Mickey, but as they will obviously be no match for Master Xehanort, Ventus goes alone. Donald and Goofy later care for their King as he recuperates from his injuries.\n\n===In other video games===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}}{{Update section|date=March 2020}}\n\n*Goofy was the star of an early platformer, ''Matterhorn Screamer'' for the [[Apple II]] and [[Commodore 64]].\n\n* Goofy appears as the owner (or perhaps simply the cashier) of the \"Junk\" store in ''[[Donald Duck's Playground]]'', developed and published in the 1980s by Sierra On-Line for the Commodore 64, IBM PC, Apple II, Amiga, and Atari ST.\n\n* Goofy also starred in [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] action game ''[[Goof Troop (video game)|Goof Troop]]'' alongside his son [[Max Goof|Max]] and in ''[[Goofy's Hysterical History Tour]]'' for the [[Sega Genesis]] where he's ahead janitor and he must recover the missing pieces of some museum exhibits.\n\n* Goofy appears briefly in ''[[Quackshot]]'', a Genesis game that starred Donald Duck. Goofy is located within the ancient ruins in Mexico and gives Donald the red plunger (an upgrade to Donald's plunger gun allows the climbing of walls) and a strange note that solves a puzzle in Egypt later in the game.\n\n* He also was in the [[Nintendo GameCube]] and [[Game Boy Advance]] game ''[[Disney's Party]]'' as one of the playable characters.\n\n* Two games for kids were released: ''[[Goofy's Fun House]]'' for the [[PlayStation]] and ''Goofy's Railway Express'' for the [[Commodore 64]].\n\n* He also appears 2001 in ''[[Disney's Extremely Goofy Skateboarding]]'' for [[Personal computer|PC]].\n\n* Goofy is a playable character in ''[[Disney TH!NK Fast]]''.\n\n* Concept art for Goofy was made for his appearance in the 2009 & 2010 [[Wii]] game, ''[[Epic Mickey]]''. He appears as one of the \"buddies\" that the Mad Doctor creates for [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] to replicate the facade of Mickey Mouse's success. A variation of him seems to appear as a minor shopkeeper named Tiki Sam.\n\n* Goofy briefly appears in ''[[Disney's Magical Quest]]'' for Super NES, released in 1992.\n\n* As noted above, Goofy appears in Disney's online game ''[[Toontown Online]]''.\n\n* Goofy was also a playable character in ''[[Disney Golf]]'' for the PS2.\n\n* Goofy is one the eight playable racers in the [[GBA]] game ''Disney Kart: Circuit Tour''.\n\n==Voice actors==\n[[Pinto Colvig]] voiced Goofy for most of his classic appearances from 1932 (''[[Mickey's Revue]]'') to 1938 (''[[The Whalers]]'') when he had a fallout with Disney and left the company to work on other projects. He was later replaced by Danny Webb from 1939 to 1941.<ref name=Canemaker/> However, Colvig returned to Disney and resumed the role in 1944 (''How to Be a Sailor'') until shortly before his death in 1967. One of his last known performances as the character was for the [[Telephone Pavilion (Expo 67)|Telephone Pavilion]] at [[Expo 67]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5484336/the_akron_beacon_journal/|title=The Akron Beacon Journal, October 21, 1967|newspaper=The Akron Beacon Journal}}</ref> Many cartoons feature Goofy silent or have recycled dialogue from earlier shorts or have various different-sounding Goofys instead of the original. Colvig also gave Goofy a normal voice for four George Geef. [[Stuart Buchanan]] voiced Goofy in ''[[The Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air]]''. Bob Jackman took Colvig's place when he left the Disney Studios for unknown reasons and voiced Goofy in 1951 for a brief time.

[[Will Ryan]] did the voice for ''[[D-TV|DTV Valentine]]'' in 1986 and ''Down and Out with Donald Duck'' in 1987. [[Tony Pope]] voiced Goofy in the 1979 Disney album, ''[[Mickey Mouse Disco]]'' for the song, \"Watch out for Goofy\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mainstgazette.com/2007/11/growing-up-disney-mickey-mouse-disco.html|title=Growing Up Disney \u2013 Mickey Mouse Disco|website=www.mainstgazette.com}}</ref> He then voiced him in ''[[Sport Goofy in Soccermania]]'' in 1987 and ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' in 1988. Aside from those occasions, [[Bill Farmer]] has been voicing Goofy since 1987. While Pope was the sole voice credit for Goofy in ''Roger Rabbit'', Farmer actually provided some of Goofy's lines in the movie as well.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhpr84WzJLg 2011 Disneyana Fan Club Convention Highlight: Voice Panel]</ref> Farmer closely imitated Colvig for projects like ''[[The Prince and the Pauper (1990 film)|The Prince and the Pauper]]'' but began putting his own spin on the character in 1992's ''[[Goof Troop]]''. Farmer also inherited Colvig's other characters, like [[Pluto (Disney character)|Pluto]], [[Sleepy (character)|Sleepy]], and [[Practical Pig]].\n\n==Relatives==\n\n===Max Goof===\n{{Main|Max Goof}}\n\nMax Goof is Goofy's teenage son. He first appeared in the 1992 television series ''[[Goof Troop]]'' and stars in both the spin-off film ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' (1995) and its [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]] ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]'' (2000). He also features in the direct-to-video ''[[Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas]]'' (1999), its sequel ''[[Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas]]'' (2004), and the 2001 TV series ''[[House of Mouse]]''. Max is a [[playable character]] on the [[Super NES]] video game ''[[Goof Troop]]'' (1993), the [[PlayStation 2]] video game ''Disney Golf'' (2002), and the [[Personal computer|PC]] video game ''[[Disney's Extremely Goofy Skateboarding]]'' (2001).\n\nMax is one of the few Disney characters aside from his best friend [[Pete Junior|P.J.]] and [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]], child or otherwise, who has actually aged in subsequent appearances. He was depicted as an eleven-year-old middle school student in ''[[Goof Troop]]'', then a high school student in ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'', and then a high school graduate teenager starting college in ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]]''. In ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'', he is still a teenager but old enough to be employed as a [[valet parking|parking valet]].\n\n==Goofy holler==\nThe Goofy holler is a [[stock sound effect]] that is used frequently in [[Walt Disney]] cartoons and films. It is the cry Goofy makes when falling or being launched into the air, that can be transcribed as \"Yaaaaaaa-hoo-hoo-hoo-hooey!\" The holler was originally recorded by [[yodeling|yodeller]] [[Hannes Schroll|Hann\u00e8s Schroll]] for the 1941 short ''[[The Art of Skiing]]''. Some sources claim that Schrolle was not paid for the recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/chris_barry/archive/2007/05/04/splash-mountain-space-mountain-big-thunder-mountain-mount-disney.aspx |title=Barry, Chris |publisher=JimHillMedia.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-17}}</ref> [[Bill Farmer]], the current voice of Goofy, demonstrated the \"Goofy Holler\" in the Disney Treasures DVD ''The Complete Goofy''. He also does this in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' games.\n\nThe holler is also used in films and cartoons in which Goofy does not appear, generally in situations that are particularly \"goofy\" (examples include ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'', ''[[Pete's Dragon (1977 film)|Pete's Dragon]]'', ''[[The Rescuers]]'', ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', ''[[Home on the Range (2004 film)|Home on the Range]]'', ''[[Enchanted (2007 film)|Enchanted]]'', and ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'').\n\nIn a ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' episode titled \"The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne\", the Joker performs the holler when the plane crashes toward a canyon.\n\nIn the \"Wacky Delly\" episode of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', the holler is heard at the end of the haphazardly made cartoon created by [[Rocko]], [[Heffer Wolfe]], and [[Filburt]] for Ralph Bighead.\n\nA version of the holler is used in a cutaway in the \"[[Dial Meg for Murder]]\" episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' when Goofy is cast into [[Hell]] for causing [[September 11 attacks|9/11]].\n\nThe term \"Goofy Holler\" was first created by a user of the [[Internet Movie Database]] and originated on the trivia page for ''[[A Goofy Movie]]''.

Although it now lies inland, before the volcanic eruption of October 79 A.D., the structure occupied more than {{convert|250|m|ft}} of coastline along the [[Gulf of Naples]]. On the other sides it was surrounded by a closed garden, vineyards and woods. The villa had four levels beneath the main floor, arranged in terraces overlooking the sea.<ref name=\"herculaneum.ox.ac.uk\">http://www.herculaneum.ox.ac.uk/?q=De%20Simone</ref>It has recently been ascertained that the main floor was {{cvt|16|m|ft}} above sea level in antiquity.\n\n[[File:Escipi\u00f3n africano.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Bronze bust of [[Scipio Africanus]], mid 1st century BC, found in the Villa of the Papyri]]\nThe villa's layout is an expanded version of the traditional Campanian villa suburbana. One entered through the fauces and proceeded to the [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]], which functioned as an entrance hall and a means of communication with the various parts of the house. The entrance opened with a columned portico on the sea side.\n\nAfter passing through the [[tablinum]], one arrived at the first [[peristyle]], made up of ten columns on each side, with a swimming pool in the centre. In this area were found the bronze [[Herma|herm]] adapted from the [[Doryphorus]] of [[Polykleitos]]<nowiki/> and the herm of an [[Amazons|Amazon]] made by Apollonios son of Archias of Athens.<ref name=\"apollonius\">Stewart, Andrew. ''Greek Sculpture''. Yale University Press (1990).</ref> The large second peristyle could be reached by passing through a large tablinum in which, under a [[propylaeum]], was the archaic statue of [[Athena Promachos]]. A collection of bronze busts were in the interior of the tablinum. These included the head of [[Scipio Africanus]].<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\nThe living and reception quarters were grouped around the porticoes and terraces, giving occupants ample sunlight and a view of the countryside and sea. In the living quarters, bath installations were brought to light, and the library of rolled and carbonised papyri placed inside wooden ''capsae'', some of them on ordinary wooden shelves and around the walls and some on the two sides of a set of shelves in the middle of the room.<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\nThe grounds included a large area of covered and uncovered gardens for walks in the shade or in the warmth of the sun. The gardens included a gallery of busts, hermae and small marble and bronze statues. These were laid out between columns amid the open part of the garden and on the edges of the large swimming bath.<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\n==Works of art==\n[[File:Resting Hermes MAN Napoli Inv5625 n02.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Barker identified this sculpture as [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]].

They are also [[hydrophorai]] drawing water from a fountain.\n\n==Epicureanism and the library==\nThe owner of the house, perhaps Calpurnius Piso, established a library of a mainly philosophical character.

This philosophy taught that man is mortal, that the cosmos is the result of accident, that there is no providential god, and that the criteria of a good life are pleasure and temperance. Philodemus' connections with Piso brought him an opportunity to influence the young students of Greek literature and philosophy who gathered around him at [[Herculaneum]] and [[Naples]]. Much of his work was discovered in about a thousand [[Papyri from Herculaneum|papyrus rolls]] in the philosophical library recovered at Herculaneum. Although his prose work is detailed in the strung-out, non-periodic style typical of Hellenistic Greek prose before the revival of the Attic style after [[Cicero]], Philodemus surpassed the average literary standard to which most epicureans aspired. Philodemus succeeded in influencing the most learned and distinguished Romans of his age.

Architectural consultant Norman Neuerburg and the curator of Getty's antiquities, [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Frel]], worked closely with Getty and the architects to ensure the accuracy of the museum building's design .\n\nSince the Villa dei Papiri was unexcavated, Neuerburg based many of the villa's architectural and landscaping details on elements from other ancient Roman houses in the towns of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Stabiae.<ref name=\"getty\">''The Getty''. 2005.

The Malibu villa was renovated and reopened in 2006. The reconceived [[Getty Villa]], as it is now called, serves as an annex dedicated to the display of the museum's antiquities and as a center for the study of ancient art.\n\n==In modern literature==\nSeveral scenes in [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]' bestselling novel ''[[Pompeii (novel)|Pompeii]]'' are set in the Villa of the Papyri, just before the eruption engulfed it. The villa is mentioned as belonging to Roman aristocrat [[Pedius Cascus]] and his wife [[Rectina]]. ([[Pliny the Younger]] mentions Rectina, whom he calls the wife of Tascius, in Letter 16 of book VI of his ''[[Epistulae (Pliny)|Letters]]''.) At the start of the eruption Rectina prepares to have the library evacuated and sends urgent word to her old friend, [[Pliny the Elder]], who commands the [[Roman Navy]] at [[Misenum]] on the other side of the [[Bay of Naples]]. Pliny immediately sets out in a warship, and gets in sight of the villa, but the eruption prevents him from landing and taking off Rectina and her library&nbsp;\u2013 which is thus left for modern archaeologists to find.\n\n==Works of art==\n===Sculpture from the Villa===\nAccording to the 1908 publication ''Buried Herculaneum'' by Ethel Ross Barker, there were busts of Athene Gorgolopha, Archaistic Pallas, Archaic [[Apollo]], Head of an Amazon, Dionysus or Plato (?

Although it now lies inland, before the volcanic eruption of October 79 A.D., the structure occupied more than {{convert|250|m|ft}} of coastline along the [[Gulf of Naples]]. On the other sides it was surrounded by a closed garden, vineyards and woods. The villa had four levels beneath the main floor, arranged in terraces overlooking the sea.<ref name=\"herculaneum.ox.ac.uk\">http://www.herculaneum.ox.ac.uk/?q=De%20Simone</ref>It has recently been ascertained that the main floor was {{cvt|16|m|ft}} above sea level in antiquity.\n\n[[File:Escipi\u00f3n africano.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Bronze bust of [[Scipio Africanus]], mid 1st century BC, found in the Villa of the Papyri]]\nThe villa's layout is an expanded version of the traditional Campanian villa suburbana. One entered through the fauces and proceeded to the [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]], which functioned as an entrance hall and a means of communication with the various parts of the house. The entrance opened with a columned portico on the sea side.\n\nAfter passing through the [[tablinum]], one arrived at the first [[peristyle]], made up of ten columns on each side, with a swimming pool in the centre. In this area were found the bronze [[Herma|herm]] adapted from the [[Doryphorus]] of [[Polykleitos]]<nowiki/> and the herm of an [[Amazons|Amazon]] made by Apollonios son of Archias of Athens.<ref name=\"apollonius\">Stewart, Andrew. ''Greek Sculpture''. Yale University Press (1990).</ref> The large second peristyle could be reached by passing through a large tablinum in which, under a [[propylaeum]], was the archaic statue of [[Athena Promachos]]. A collection of bronze busts were in the interior of the tablinum. These included the head of [[Scipio Africanus]].<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\nThe living and reception quarters were grouped around the porticoes and terraces, giving occupants ample sunlight and a view of the countryside and sea. In the living quarters, bath installations were brought to light, and the library of rolled and carbonised papyri placed inside wooden ''capsae'', some of them on ordinary wooden shelves and around the walls and some on the two sides of a set of shelves in the middle of the room.<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\nThe grounds included a large area of covered and uncovered gardens for walks in the shade or in the warmth of the sun. The gardens included a gallery of busts, hermae and small marble and bronze statues.

It is believed that the library might have been collected and selected by Piso's family friend and client, the Epicurean [[Philodemus of G\u00e0dara]], although this conclusion is not certain.<ref name=\"oxford\" /><ref>See Erlend D. MacGillivray, \"The Popularity of Epicureanism in Late-Republic Roman Society\", ''The Ancient World'' XLIII (2012) 151\u2013172.</ref> Followers of [[Epicurus]] studied the teachings of this moral and natural philosopher. This philosophy taught that man is mortal, that the cosmos is the result of accident, that there is no providential god, and that the criteria of a good life are pleasure and temperance. Philodemus' connections with Piso brought him an opportunity to influence the young students of Greek literature and philosophy who gathered around him at [[Herculaneum]] and [[Naples]]. Much of his work was discovered in about a thousand [[Papyri from Herculaneum|papyrus rolls]] in the philosophical library recovered at Herculaneum. Although his prose work is detailed in the strung-out, non-periodic style typical of Hellenistic Greek prose before the revival of the Attic style after [[Cicero]], Philodemus surpassed the average literary standard to which most epicureans aspired.

The exact location of the villa was then lost for two centuries.<ref name=\"herculaneum.ox.ac.uk\"/> In the 1980s work on re-discovering the villa began by studying 18th century documentation on entrances to the tunnels and in 1986 the breakthrough was made through an ancient well. The backfill from some of the tunnels was cleared to allow re-exploration of the villa when it was found that the parts of the villa that survived the earlier excavations were still remarkable in quantity and quality.\n\nExcavation to expose part of the villa was done in the 1990s and revealed two previously undiscovered lower floors to the villa<ref name=\"herculaneum.ox.ac.uk\"/> with frescoes in situ. These were found along the southwest-facing terrace of about 4 metres height.

Paul Getty Museum==\nIn 1970, oil billionaire [[J. Paul Getty]] engaged the architectural firm of [[Robert E. Langdon Jr.|Langdon]] and [[Ernest C. Wilson Jr.|Wilson]] to create a replica of the Villa dei Papiri to serve as a museum where his collection of antiquities would be displayed. \n\nBased on Weber's plans published in ''[[Le Antichit\u00e0 di Ercolano]]'', the museum was built on Getty's Malibu ranch in 1972-74. Architectural consultant Norman Neuerburg and the curator of Getty's antiquities, [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Frel]], worked closely with Getty and the architects to ensure the accuracy of the museum building's design .\n\nSince the Villa dei Papiri was unexcavated, Neuerburg based many of the villa's architectural and landscaping details on elements from other ancient Roman houses in the towns of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Stabiae.<ref name=\"getty\">''The Getty''. 2005. J. Paul Getty Museum. 11 May 2007 http://www.getty.edu/visit/see_do/architecture.html.</ref>. For example, the mosaic fountain in the museum's garden peristyle replicates the one in the Nymphaeum of the House of the Large Fountain at Pompeii). \n\nIn 1997, the Getty Museum was relocated to the [[Getty Center]]. The Malibu villa was renovated and reopened in 2006. The reconceived [[Getty Villa]], as it is now called, serves as an annex dedicated to the display of the museum's antiquities and as a center for the study of ancient art.\n\n==In modern literature==\nSeveral scenes in [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]' bestselling novel ''[[Pompeii (novel)|Pompeii]]'' are set in the Villa of the Papyri, just before the eruption engulfed it. The villa is mentioned as belonging to Roman aristocrat [[Pedius Cascus]] and his wife [[Rectina]]. ([[Pliny the Younger]] mentions Rectina, whom he calls the wife of Tascius, in Letter 16 of book VI of his ''[[Epistulae (Pliny)|Letters]]''.) At the start of the eruption Rectina prepares to have the library evacuated and sends urgent word to her old friend, [[Pliny the Elder]], who commands the [[Roman Navy]] at [[Misenum]] on the other side of the [[Bay of Naples]]. Pliny immediately sets out in a warship, and gets in sight of the villa, but the eruption prevents him from landing and taking off Rectina and her library&nbsp;\u2013 which is thus left for modern archaeologists to find.\n\n==Works of art==\n===Sculpture from the Villa===\nAccording to the 1908 publication ''Buried Herculaneum'' by Ethel Ross Barker, there were busts of Athene Gorgolopha, Archaistic Pallas, Archaic [[Apollo]], Head of an Amazon, Dionysus or Plato (?
