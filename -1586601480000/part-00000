AB32 was authored by then-Speaker of the California Assembly [[Fabian Nunez]] (D-Los Angeles) and signed into law by Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] on September 27, 2006.\n\nOn June 1, 2005, Governor Schwarzenegger signed an executive order known as [[Executive Order S-3-05]]<ref>{{cite web|title=California Climate Change Executive Orders|url=http://www.climatechange.ca.gov/state/executive_orders.html|website=California Climate Change|accessdate=17 April 2016}}</ref> which established greenhouse gas emissions targets for the state. The executive order required the state to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions levels to 2000 levels by 2010, to 1990 levels by 2020, and to a level 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. However, to implement this measure, the [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB) needed authority from the legislature. The [[California State Legislature]] passed the Global Warming Solutions Act to address this issue and gave the CARB authority to implement the program.\n\nAB 32 requires the [[California Air Resources Board]] ([[CARB]] or ARB) to develop regulations and market mechanisms to reduce California's greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year of 2020, representing approximately a 30% reduction statewide,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/cc.htm|title=Climate Change|date=September 5, 2018|website=California Air Resources Board|access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref> with mandatory caps beginning in 2012 for significant emissions sources. The bill also allows the Governor to suspend the emissions caps for up to a year in case of emergency or significant economic harm.\n\nThe [[State of California]] leads the nation in energy efficiency standards and plays a lead role in [[environmental protection]], but is also the 12th largest emitter of carbon worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gov.ca.gov/index.php?/press-release/4111/ |title=Office of Governor Edmund G.

The scoping plan, approved by the ARB Board December 12, 2008, provides the outline for actions to reduce greenhouse gases in California. The approved scoping plan indicates how these emission reductions will be achieved from significant greenhouse gas sources via regulations, market mechanisms and other actions.\n# Identify the statewide level of greenhouse gas emissions in 1990 to serve as the emissions limit to be achieved by 2020. In December 2007, the Board approved the 2020 emission limit of 427 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gases, however this limit was later revised to 431 million metric tons using updated methods that had been outlined in the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]].<ref>\"1990 Level and Limit,\" California Air Resources Board, May 6, 2015. http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/inventory/1990level/1990level.htm</ref>\n# Adopt a regulation requiring the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. In December 2007, the Board adopted a regulation requiring the largest industrial sources to report and verify their greenhouse gas emissions. The reporting regulation serves as a solid foundation to determine greenhouse gas emissions and track future changes in emission levels. In 2011, the Board adopted the cap-and-trade regulation. The cap-and-trade program covers major sources of GHG emissions in the State such as refineries, power plants, industrial facilities, and transportation fuels. The cap-and-trade program includes an enforceable emissions cap that will decline over time. The State will distribute allowances, which are trad-able permits, equal to the emissions allowed under the cap. Sources under the cap will need to surrender allowances and offsets equal to their emissions at the end of each compliance period.\n# Identify and adopt regulations for discrete early actions that could be enforceable on or before January 1, 2010. The Board identified nine discrete early action measures including regulations affecting landfills, motor vehicle fuels, refrigerants in cars, tire pressure, port operations and other sources in 2007 that included ship electrification at ports and reduction of high GWP gases in consumer products.\n# Ensure early voluntary reductions receive appropriate credit in the implementation of AB 32\n# Convene an Environmental Justice Advisory Committee (EJAC) to advise the Board in developing the Scoping Plan and any other pertinent matter in implementing AB 32. The EJAC has met 12 times since early 2007, providing comments on the proposed early action measures and the development of the scoping plan, and submitted its comments and recommendations on the scoping plan in October 2008. ARB will continue to work with the EJAC as AB 32 is implemented.\n# Appoint an Economic and Technology Advancement Advisory Committee (ETAAC) to provide recommendations for technologies, research and greenhouse gas emission reduction measures<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/ab32/ab32.htm|title=Assembly Bill 32 - California Global Warming Solutions Act|author=California Air Resources Board|work=ca.gov}}</ref>(ETAAC). After a year-long public process, the ETAAC submitted a report of their recommendations to the Board in February 2008. The ETAAC also reviewed and provided comments on the scoping plan.\n\n==Timeline==\nAB 32 stipulates the following timeline:<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| By Jan 1, 2009 || ARB adopts plan indicating how emission reductions will be achieved from significant sources of GHGs via regulations, market mechanisms and other actions\n|-\n| During 2009 || ARB staff drafts rule language to implement its plan and holds a series of public workshop on each measure (including market mechanisms)\n|-\n| By Jan 1, 2010 || Early action measures take effect\n|-\n| During 2010 || ARB conducts series of rulemakings, after workshops and public hearings, to adopt GHG regulations including rules governing market mechanisms\n|-\n| By Jan 1, 2011 || ARB completes major rulemakings for reducing GHGs including market mechanisms.

The Scoping Plan was first considered by the Board in 2008 and must be updated every five years. ARB is currently in the process of updating the Scoping Plan.  Details regarding this update are outlined below.\n\n'''AB 32 Scoping Plan Update'''\n\nThe Scoping Plan Update (Update) builds upon the initial Scoping Plan with new strategies and recommendations.  The Update identifies opportunities to leverage existing and new funds to further drive GHG emission reductions through strategic planning and targeted low carbon investments.  The Update defines ARB's climate change priorities for the next five years and sets the groundwork to reach California's post-2020 climate goals set forth in Executive Orders S-3-05 and B-16-2012. The Update will highlight California's progress toward meeting the near-term 2020 GHG emission reduction goals defined in the initial Scoping Plan.  It will also evaluate how to align the State's longer-term GHG reduction strategies with other State policy priorities for water, waste, natural resources, clean energy, transportation, and land use.\n\n'''What are the key focus areas for the Update?'''\n\nARB plans to focus on six key topics areas for the post-2020 element. These include: (1) transportation, fuels, and infrastructure, (2) energy generation, transmission, and efficiency, (3) waste, (4) water, (5) agriculture, and (6) natural and working lands.\n\n'''What recent activity has occurred in 2013?'''\n\nIn June 2013, ARB held a kickoff public workshop in Sacramento to discuss the development of the Scoping Plan Update, public process, and overall schedule.   In July 2013, subsequent regional workshops were held in Diamond Bar; Fresno; and the Bay Area, which provided forums to discuss region-specific issues, concerns, and priorities.  In addition, ARB accepted and considered informal stakeholder comments from June 13, 2013 through August 5, 2013.  ARB also reconvened the Environmental Justice Advisory Committee to advise, and provide recommendations on the development of, this Update.  On October 1, 2013, ARB released a discussion draft of the Update to the AB 32 Scoping Plan for public review and comment.  On October 15, 2013, ARB held a public workshop and provided an update to the Board at the October 24, 2013 Board Hearing.  Extensive public comment and input was received at the October Board Hearing.  In addition, over 115 comment letters were submitted on the discussion draft.\n\n'''What activities are planned for 2014?'''\n\nIn late-January 2014, ARB plans to release the draft proposed Scoping Plan Update and Environmental Assessment.    In February 2014, ARB will have a Board meeting discussion that will include additional opportunities for stakeholder feedback and public comment.  In Spring 2014, ARB will hold a Board Hearing to consider the Final Scoping Plan Update and Environmental Assessment.\n\n'''What is the status of AB 32 implementation?'''\n\nThe California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32) has been implemented effectively with a suite of complementary strategies that serve as a model going forward.  California is on target for meeting the 2020 GHG emission reduction goal.  Many of the GHG reduction measures (e.g., Low Carbon Fuel Standard, Advanced Clean Car standards, and Cap-and-Trade) have been adopted over the last five years and implementation activities are ongoing.  California is getting real reductions to put us on track for reducing GHG emissions to achieve the AB 32 goal of getting back to 1990 levels by 2020.<ref name=\"arb.ca.gov\"/>\n\n==Cap-and-Trade==\nOn December 17, 2010 ARB adopted a cap-and-trade program to place an upper limit on statewide greenhouse gas emissions.  This is the first program of its kind on this scale in the United States, though in the northeastern United States, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative|(RGGI)]] works on a similar principle. Through the [[Western Climate Initiative]] (WCI), California is working to link its cap and trade system to other states. In October 2013, California officially linked its cap-and-trade program with Quebec Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife, and Parks.  The program had a soft start in 2012, with the first required compliance period starting in 2013. Emissions are to be reduced by two percent each year through 2015 and three percent each year from 2015 to 2020.  The rules apply first to utilities and large industrial plants, and in 2015 will begin to be applied to fuel distributors as well, eventually totaling 360 businesses at 600 locations throughout the State of California.  Free credits will be distributed to businesses to account for about 90 percent of overall emissions in their sector, but they must buy allowances   (credits) at auction, to account for additional emissions.  The auction format used will be single round, sealed bid auction. A preliminary auction was held August 30, 2012 with the first actual quarterly auction to take place November 14, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/capandtrade/auction/auction.htm|title=Quarterly Auction and Reserve Sale Information - Cap-and-Trade|work=ca.gov}}</ref>\n\n=== CARB Quarterly Auction Results ===\n\nAt the fifth CARB Quarterly Auction held on November 9, 2013, 16,614,526 2013 allowances were sold at a clearing price of $11.48 per allowance.

Compliance entities may also use a certain percentage of offset credits in the system.  Offsets credits are generated by projects that reduce emissions or act as sinks for green house gasses. Currently the Air Resources Board allows for different types of offset projects to generate offset credits: U.S. Forest and Urban Forest Project Resources, Livestock Projects (methane emission control), Ozone Depleting Substances Projects, and Urban Forest Projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/capandtrade/offsets/offsets.htm|title=Compliance Offset Program|author=California Air Resources Board|work=ca.gov}}</ref>\n\nOffset provisions in the cap and trade scheme are however controversial and have been challenged in court.

Briefly, the bill is about the labor unions who wants portion from cap and trade's  revenue to increasing wages for their workers, getting more jobs and increasing the number of union members that work in the industry that actually produce greenhouse gas emission. In this case, union labor will be fighting environmental groups supportive of AB 32 goals.

However,  California superior court has rejected the challenges to the state's cap-and-trade program, upholding a significant element of California's suite of programs to comply with AB 32 and to reduce the state's greenhouse gas emissions.\n-<ref>Cara Horowitz, \"California cap and trade survives industry tax challenge\" legal-planet.org 2013</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Global Warming|Weather}}\n*[[Climate change (general concept)|Climate Change]]\n*[[Kyoto Protocol]]\n*[[Regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act]]\n*[[Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008]]\n*[[Climate change in California]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060928031617/http://gov.ca.gov/index.php?%2Fpress-release%2F4111%2F Governor's press release]\n*[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/postquery?bill_number=ab_32&sess=0506&house=B&author=nunez Legal documentation]\n*[http://www.solutionsforglobalwarming.org California - Global Warming]\n*[http://www.climatechange.ca.gov/ California State Government Climate Change Portal]\n*[http://www.triplepundit.com/tag/ab32 AB32 News Coverage]\n*[http://www.carbonneutral.com/ Meeting AB 32 targets]\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.carbonneutral.com/knowledge-centre/company-blog/setting-free-the-bears-an-update-on-carbon-markets// |title=Update on carbon markets |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website= |access-date= |quote=}}\n*{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304114546/http://www.nrdc.org/globalWarming/f101.asp?gclid=CO7n2__YvLsCFWUV7Aodqm0Aog|title=What is Global Warming|date=2016-03-04|website=NRDC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304114546/http://www.nrdc.org/globalWarming/f101.asp?gclid=CO7n2__YvLsCFWUV7Aodqm0Aog|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=|access-date=2019-04-24}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.c2es.org/us-states-regions/action/california/ab32 |title=California Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32) |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=c2es.org |publisher=[[Center for Climate and Energy Solutions]] |access-date=September 29, 2016 |quote=}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.nrdc.org/globalwarming/ca/ca.asp |title=A Golden Opportunity: California's Solutions for Global Warming |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=June 19, 2007 |website=nrdc.org |publisher=[[Natural Resources Defense Council]] |access-date=September 29, 2016 |quote=}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.edf.org/climate/AB32 |title=California leads fight to curb climate change |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=edf.org |publisher=[[Environmental Defense Fund]] |access-date=September 29, 2016 |quote=}}\n* {{cite journal |url=https://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/llr/vol41/iss1/21 |title=California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006: Meaningfully Decreasing Greenhouse Gas Emissions or Merely a Set of Empty Promises |author=Cobo, Kimberly |date=September 1, 2007 |journal=Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review |volume=41 |issue=1 |accessdate=6 December 2018}}\n\n{{global warming}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Global Warming Solutions Act Of 2006}}\n[[Category:California statutes]]\n[[Category:Air pollution in California]]\n[[Category:Climate change policy in the United States]]\n[[Category:Energy policy of the United States]]\n[[Category:Environment of California]]\n[[Category:Politics of California]]\n[[Category:2006 in law]]\n[[Category:2006 in California]]\n[[Category:2006 in the environment]]\n[[Category:California Environmental Protection Agency|\u00a4]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{Short description|California state law}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date = March 2019}}\n{{Infobox U.S. State legislation\n| State = California\n| Full_name= Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006\n| Status= Passed\n| Introduced= April 3, 2006\n| Assembly_Voted= August 31, 2006\n| Senate_Voted= August 30, 2006\n| Signed = September 27, 2006\n| Sponsors = [[Fabian Nunez]]\n| Governor = [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]\n| Code = [[California Health and Safety Code]]\n| Section = 38500, 38501, 28510, 38530, etc.\n| Resolution = AB32 (2005-2006 Session)\n| Associated_bills = [http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB398 AB 398] (2017-2018 session; extends cap-and-trade until 2030), [http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB32 SB 32] (2015-2016 session; adds GHG reduction target of 40% below 1990 levels by 2030)\n| URL={{url|http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/docs/ab32text.pdf}}\n}}\nThe '''Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006''', or Assembly Bill (AB) 32, is a [[California]] State Law that fights [[global warming]] by establishing a comprehensive program to reduce [[greenhouse gas emissions]] from all sources throughout the state.  AB32 was authored by then-Speaker of the California Assembly [[Fabian Nunez]] (D-Los Angeles) and signed into law by Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] on September 27, 2006.\n\nOn June 1, 2005, Governor Schwarzenegger signed an executive order known as [[Executive Order S-3-05]]<ref>{{cite web|title=California Climate Change Executive Orders|url=http://www.climatechange.ca.gov/state/executive_orders.html|website=California Climate Change|accessdate=17 April 2016}}</ref> which established greenhouse gas emissions targets for the state. The executive order required the state to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions levels to 2000 levels by 2010, to 1990 levels by 2020, and to a level 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. However, to implement this measure, the [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB) needed authority from the legislature. The [[California State Legislature]] passed the Global Warming Solutions Act to address this issue and gave the CARB authority to implement the program.\n\nAB 32 requires the [[California Air Resources Board]] ([[CARB]] or ARB) to develop regulations and market mechanisms to reduce California's greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by the year of 2020, representing approximately a 30% reduction statewide,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/cc.htm|title=Climate Change|date=September 5, 2018|website=California Air Resources Board|access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref> with mandatory caps beginning in 2012 for significant emissions sources.

The scoping plan, approved by the ARB Board December 12, 2008, provides the outline for actions to reduce greenhouse gases in California. The approved scoping plan indicates how these emission reductions will be achieved from significant greenhouse gas sources via regulations, market mechanisms and other actions.\n# Identify the statewide level of greenhouse gas emissions in 1990 to serve as the emissions limit to be achieved by 2020. In December 2007, the Board approved the 2020 emission limit of 427 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gases, however this limit was later revised to 431 million metric tons using updated methods that had been outlined in the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]].<ref>\"1990 Level and Limit,\" California Air Resources Board, May 6, 2015. http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/inventory/1990level/1990level.htm</ref>\n# Adopt a regulation requiring the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. In December 2007, the Board adopted a regulation requiring the largest industrial sources to report and verify their greenhouse gas emissions. The reporting regulation serves as a solid foundation to determine greenhouse gas emissions and track future changes in emission levels. In 2011, the Board adopted the cap-and-trade regulation. The cap-and-trade program covers major sources of GHG emissions in the State such as refineries, power plants, industrial facilities, and transportation fuels. The cap-and-trade program includes an enforceable emissions cap that will decline over time. The State will distribute allowances, which are trad-able permits, equal to the emissions allowed under the cap. Sources under the cap will need to surrender allowances and offsets equal to their emissions at the end of each compliance period.\n# Identify and adopt regulations for discrete early actions that could be enforceable on or before January 1, 2010. The Board identified nine discrete early action measures including regulations affecting landfills, motor vehicle fuels, refrigerants in cars, tire pressure, port operations and other sources in 2007 that included ship electrification at ports and reduction of high GWP gases in consumer products.\n# Ensure early voluntary reductions receive appropriate credit in the implementation of AB 32\n# Convene an Environmental Justice Advisory Committee (EJAC) to advise the Board in developing the Scoping Plan and any other pertinent matter in implementing AB 32. The EJAC has met 12 times since early 2007, providing comments on the proposed early action measures and the development of the scoping plan, and submitted its comments and recommendations on the scoping plan in October 2008. ARB will continue to work with the EJAC as AB 32 is implemented.\n# Appoint an Economic and Technology Advancement Advisory Committee (ETAAC) to provide recommendations for technologies, research and greenhouse gas emission reduction measures<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/ab32/ab32.htm|title=Assembly Bill 32 - California Global Warming Solutions Act|author=California Air Resources Board|work=ca.gov}}</ref>(ETAAC). After a year-long public process, the ETAAC submitted a report of their recommendations to the Board in February 2008.

The Scoping Plan was first considered by the Board in 2008 and must be updated every five years. ARB is currently in the process of updating the Scoping Plan.  Details regarding this update are outlined below.\n\n'''AB 32 Scoping Plan Update'''\n\nThe Scoping Plan Update (Update) builds upon the initial Scoping Plan with new strategies and recommendations.  The Update identifies opportunities to leverage existing and new funds to further drive GHG emission reductions through strategic planning and targeted low carbon investments.  The Update defines ARB's climate change priorities for the next five years and sets the groundwork to reach California's post-2020 climate goals set forth in Executive Orders S-3-05 and B-16-2012. The Update will highlight California's progress toward meeting the near-term 2020 GHG emission reduction goals defined in the initial Scoping Plan.  It will also evaluate how to align the State's longer-term GHG reduction strategies with other State policy priorities for water, waste, natural resources, clean energy, transportation, and land use.\n\n'''What are the key focus areas for the Update?'''\n\nARB plans to focus on six key topics areas for the post-2020 element. These include: (1) transportation, fuels, and infrastructure, (2) energy generation, transmission, and efficiency, (3) waste, (4) water, (5) agriculture, and (6) natural and working lands.\n\n'''What recent activity has occurred in 2013?'''\n\nIn June 2013, ARB held a kickoff public workshop in Sacramento to discuss the development of the Scoping Plan Update, public process, and overall schedule.   In July 2013, subsequent regional workshops were held in Diamond Bar; Fresno; and the Bay Area, which provided forums to discuss region-specific issues, concerns, and priorities.  In addition, ARB accepted and considered informal stakeholder comments from June 13, 2013 through August 5, 2013.  ARB also reconvened the Environmental Justice Advisory Committee to advise, and provide recommendations on the development of, this Update.  On October 1, 2013, ARB released a discussion draft of the Update to the AB 32 Scoping Plan for public review and comment.  On October 15, 2013, ARB held a public workshop and provided an update to the Board at the October 24, 2013 Board Hearing.  Extensive public comment and input was received at the October Board Hearing.  In addition, over 115 comment letters were submitted on the discussion draft.\n\n'''What activities are planned for 2014?'''\n\nIn late-January 2014, ARB plans to release the draft proposed Scoping Plan Update and Environmental Assessment.    In February 2014, ARB will have a Board meeting discussion that will include additional opportunities for stakeholder feedback and public comment.  In Spring 2014, ARB will hold a Board Hearing to consider the Final Scoping Plan Update and Environmental Assessment.\n\n'''What is the status of AB 32 implementation?'''\n\nThe California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32) has been implemented effectively with a suite of complementary strategies that serve as a model going forward.  California is on target for meeting the 2020 GHG emission reduction goal.  Many of the GHG reduction measures (e.g., Low Carbon Fuel Standard, Advanced Clean Car standards, and Cap-and-Trade) have been adopted over the last five years and implementation activities are ongoing.  California is getting real reductions to put us on track for reducing GHG emissions to achieve the AB 32 goal of getting back to 1990 levels by 2020.<ref name=\"arb.ca.gov\"/>\n\n==Cap-and-Trade==\nOn December 17, 2010 ARB adopted a cap-and-trade program to place an upper limit on statewide greenhouse gas emissions.  This is the first program of its kind on this scale in the United States, though in the northeastern United States, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative|(RGGI)]] works on a similar principle. Through the [[Western Climate Initiative]] (WCI), California is working to link its cap and trade system to other states. In October 2013, California officially linked its cap-and-trade program with Quebec Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife, and Parks.  The program had a soft start in 2012, with the first required compliance period starting in 2013. Emissions are to be reduced by two percent each year through 2015 and three percent each year from 2015 to 2020.  The rules apply first to utilities and large industrial plants, and in 2015 will begin to be applied to fuel distributors as well, eventually totaling 360 businesses at 600 locations throughout the State of California.  Free credits will be distributed to businesses to account for about 90 percent of overall emissions in their sector, but they must buy allowances   (credits) at auction, to account for additional emissions.  The auction format used will be single round, sealed bid auction. A preliminary auction was held August 30, 2012 with the first actual quarterly auction to take place November 14, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/capandtrade/auction/auction.htm|title=Quarterly Auction and Reserve Sale Information - Cap-and-Trade|work=ca.gov}}</ref>\n\n=== CARB Quarterly Auction Results ===\n\nAt the fifth CARB Quarterly Auction held on November 9, 2013, 16,614,526 2013 allowances were sold at a clearing price of $11.48 per allowance.

Compliance entities may also use a certain percentage of offset credits in the system.  Offsets credits are generated by projects that reduce emissions or act as sinks for green house gasses. Currently the Air Resources Board allows for different types of offset projects to generate offset credits: U.S. Forest and Urban Forest Project Resources, Livestock Projects (methane emission control), Ozone Depleting Substances Projects, and Urban Forest Projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/capandtrade/offsets/offsets.htm|title=Compliance Offset Program|author=California Air Resources Board|work=ca.gov}}</ref>\n\nOffset provisions in the cap and trade scheme are however controversial and have been challenged in court.

Briefly, the bill is about the labor unions who wants portion from cap and trade's  revenue to increasing wages for their workers, getting more jobs and increasing the number of union members that work in the industry that actually produce greenhouse gas emission. In this case, union labor will be fighting environmental groups supportive of AB 32 goals.

The complaint was filed for Sacramento Superior Court and seeks to stop the auction and have the auction regulations declared invalid.  However,  California superior court has rejected the challenges to the state's cap-and-trade program, upholding a significant element of California's suite of programs to comply with AB 32 and to reduce the state's greenhouse gas emissions.\n-<ref>Cara Horowitz, \"California cap and trade survives industry tax challenge\" legal-planet.org 2013</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Global Warming|Weather}}\n*[[Climate Change]]\n*[[Kyoto Protocol]]\n*[[Regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act]]\n*[[Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008]]\n*[[Climate change in California]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060928031617/http://gov.ca.gov/index.php?%2Fpress-release%2F4111%2F Governor's press release]\n*[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/postquery?bill_number=ab_32&sess=0506&house=B&author=nunez Legal documentation]\n*[http://www.solutionsforglobalwarming.org California - Global Warming]\n*[http://www.climatechange.ca.gov/ California State Government Climate Change Portal]\n*[http://www.triplepundit.com/tag/ab32 AB32 News Coverage]\n*[http://www.carbonneutral.com/ Meeting AB 32 targets]\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.carbonneutral.com/knowledge-centre/company-blog/setting-free-the-bears-an-update-on-carbon-markets// |title=Update on carbon markets |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website= |access-date= |quote=}}\n*{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304114546/http://www.nrdc.org/globalWarming/f101.asp?gclid=CO7n2__YvLsCFWUV7Aodqm0Aog|title=What is Global Warming|date=2016-03-04|website=NRDC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304114546/http://www.nrdc.org/globalWarming/f101.asp?gclid=CO7n2__YvLsCFWUV7Aodqm0Aog|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=|access-date=2019-04-24}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.c2es.org/us-states-regions/action/california/ab32 |title=California Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32) |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=c2es.org |publisher=[[Center for Climate and Energy Solutions]] |access-date=September 29, 2016 |quote=}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.nrdc.org/globalwarming/ca/ca.asp |title=A Golden Opportunity: California's Solutions for Global Warming |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=June 19, 2007 |website=nrdc.org |publisher=[[Natural Resources Defense Council]] |access-date=September 29, 2016 |quote=}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.edf.org/climate/AB32 |title=California leads fight to curb climate change |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=edf.org |publisher=[[Environmental Defense Fund]] |access-date=September 29, 2016 |quote=}}\n* {{cite journal |url=https://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/llr/vol41/iss1/21 |title=California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006: Meaningfully Decreasing Greenhouse Gas Emissions or Merely a Set of Empty Promises |author=Cobo, Kimberly |date=September 1, 2007 |journal=Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review |volume=41 |issue=1 |accessdate=6 December 2018}}\n\n{{global warming}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Global Warming Solutions Act Of 2006}}\n[[Category:California statutes]]\n[[Category:Air pollution in California]]\n[[Category:Climate change policy in the United States]]\n[[Category:Energy policy of the United States]]\n[[Category:Environment of California]]\n[[Category:Politics of California]]\n[[Category:2006 in law]]\n[[Category:2006 in California]]\n[[Category:2006 in the environment]]\n[[Category:California Environmental Protection Agency|\u00a4]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:Global Warming\u2192Global warming,Climate Change\u2192Climate change (general concept)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Warming_Solutions_Act_of_2006"}

Polymorphism refers to the ability to overload the name of a function with multiple behaviors based on which object(s) are passed to it.

The object-oriented approach is an evolution of good design practices that go back to the very beginning of computer programming. Object-orientation is simply the logical extension of older techniques such as [[structured programming]] and [[abstract data types]]. An object is an abstract data type with the addition of [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] and [[inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]].\n\nRather than structure programs as code and data, an object-oriented system integrates the two using the concept of an \"object\". An object has state (data) and behavior (code). Objects can correspond to things found in the real world. So for example, a graphics program will have objects such as ''circle'', ''square'', ''menu''. An online shopping system will have objects such as ''shopping cart, customer, product''. The shopping system will support behaviors such as ''place order'', ''make payment'', and ''offer discount''. The objects are designed as class hierarchies. So for example with the shopping system there might be high level classes such as ''electronics product'', ''kitchen product'', and ''book''. There may be further refinements for example under ''electronic products'': ''CD Player, DVD player'', etc. These classes and subclasses correspond to sets and subsets in mathematical logic.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jacobsen|first=Ivar|title=Object Oriented Software Engineering|year=1992|publisher=Addison-Wesley ACM Press|isbn=0-201-54435-0|author2=Magnus Christerson|author3=Patrik Jonsson|author4=Gunnar Overgaard|url=https://archive.org/details/objectorientedso00jaco}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=What is an Object?|url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/object.html|work=oracle.com|publisher=Oracle Corporation|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Specialized objects==\nAn important concept for objects is the [[design pattern (computer science)|design pattern]].

Often the input and output streams are streams of characters, but these also may be streams of arbitrary objects. These are generally used in wrappers since they conceal the existing implementation with the abstraction required at the developer side.\n\n==Distributed objects==\n{{main|Distributed object}}\nThe object-oriented approach is not just a programming model. It can be used equally well as an [[interface description language|interface definition language]] for distributed systems. The objects in a distributed computing model tend to be larger grained, longer lasting, and more service-oriented than programming objects.\n\nA standard method to package distributed objects is via an Interface Definition Language (IDL). An IDL shields the client of all of the details of the distributed server object. Details such as which computer the object resides on, what [[programming language]] it uses, what [[operating system]], and other platform specific issues. The IDL is also usually part of a distributed environment that provides services such as transactions and persistence to all objects in a uniform manner. Two of the most popular standards for distributed objects are the [[Object Management Group]]'s [[CORBA]] standard and [[Microsoft]]'s DCOM.<ref>{{cite book|last=Orfali|first=Robert|title=The Essential Client/Server Survival Guide|year=1996|publisher=Wiley Computer Publishing|location=New York|isbn=0-471-15325-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/essentialclients00orfa/page/399 399\u2013403]|url=https://archive.org/details/essentialclients00orfa/page/399}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to distributed objects, a number of other extensions to the basic concept of an object have been proposed to enable distributed computing:\n*''Protocol objects'' are components of a [[protocol stack]] that enclose network communication within an object-oriented interface.\n*''[[Replication (computer science)|Replicated objects]]'' are groups of distributed objects (called ''replicas'') that run a distributed multi-party protocol to achieve high consistency between their internal states, and that respond to requests in a coordinated way. Examples include fault-tolerant [[CORBA]] objects.\n*''[[Live distributed object]]s'' (or simply ''[[live distributed object|live objects]]'')<ref>Ostrowski, K., Birman, K., Dolev, D., and Ahnn, J.

Others, such as ''replicated objects'' and ''live distributed objects'', are more non-standard, in that they abandon the usual case that an object resides in a single location at a time, and apply the concept to groups of entities (replicas) that might span across multiple locations, might have only weakly consistent state, and whose membership might dynamically change.\n\n==The Semantic Web==\nThe [[Semantic Web]] is essentially a distributed objects framework. Two key technologies in the Semantic Web are the [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL) and the [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF). RDF provides the capability to define basic objects\u2014names, properties, attributes, relations\u2014that are accessible via the Internet. OWL adds a richer object model, based on set theory, that provides additional modeling capabilities such as multiple inheritance.\n\nOWL objects are not like standard large grained [[distributed objects]] accessed via an Interface Definition Language. Such an approach would not be appropriate for the Internet because the Internet is constantly evolving and standardization on one set of interfaces is difficult to achieve. OWL objects tend to be similar to the kind of objects used to define application domain models in programming languages such as Java and [[C++]].\n\nHowever, there are important distinctions between OWL objects and traditional object-oriented programming objects. Traditional objects get compiled into static hierarchies usually with single inheritance, but OWL objects are dynamic. An OWL object can change its structure at run time and can become an instance of new or different classes.\n\nAnother critical difference is the way the model treats information that is currently not in the system. Programming objects and most database systems use the \"[[closed-world assumption]]\". If a fact is not known to the system that fact is assumed to be false. Semantic Web objects use the [[open-world assumption]], a statement is only considered false if there is actual relevant information that it is false, otherwise it is assumed to be unknown, neither true nor false.\n\nOWL objects are actually most like objects in artificial intelligence [[frame language]]s such as [[KL-ONE]] and Loom.\n\nThe following table contrasts traditional objects from Object-Oriented programming languages such as Java or C++ with Semantic Web Objects:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Berners-Lee|first=Tim|author2=James Hendler|author3=Ora Lassila|title=The Semantic Web A new form of Web content that is meaningful to computers will unleash a revolution of new possibilities|journal=Scientific American|date=May 17, 2001|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0501-34|volume=284|pages=34\u201343|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424071228/http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html|archivedate=April 24, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/BestPractices/SE/ODSD/|title=A Semantic Web Primer for Object-Oriented Software Developers|last1=Knublauch|first1=Holger|last2=Oberle|first2=Daniel|last3=Tetlow|first3=Phil|last4=Wallace|first4=Evan|publisher=[[W3C]]|date=2006-03-09|accessdate=2008-07-30}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
