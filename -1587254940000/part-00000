He was married to [[Andromache]], with whom he had an infant son, [[Scamandrius]] (whom the people of Troy called [[Astyanax]]).\n\nDuring the European Middle Ages, Hector figures as one of the [[Nine Worthies]] noted by [[Jacques de Longuyon]], known not only for his courage but also for his noble and courtly nature. Indeed, [[Homer]] places Hector as peace-loving, thoughtful as well as bold, a good son, husband and father, and without darker motives. [[James M. Redfield|James Redfield]] describes Hector as a \"martyr to loyalties, a witness to the things of this world, a hero ready to die for the precious imperfections of ordinary life.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=James M. |last=Redfield |title=Nature and Culture in the Iliad: The Tragedy of Hector |location=Durham |publisher=Duke University Press |date=1994 |page=ix}}</ref>\n\n==Mythology==\n\n===Greatest warrior of Troy===\n\n[[File:Hektor wirft Paris seine Weichlichkeit vor (Tischbein).jpg|thumb|250px|''Hector Admonishes Paris for His Softness and Exhorts Him to Go to War'' by [[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein|J. H. W. Tischbein]] (1751\u20131828)]]\n\nAccording to the ''[[Iliad]]'', Hector did not approve of war between the [[Greeks]] and the Trojans.\n\nFor ten years, the Achaeans besieged Troy and their allies in the east. Hector commanded the Trojan army, with a number of subordinates including [[Polydamas (Iliad)|Polydamas]], and his brothers [[Deiphobus]], [[Helenus]] and [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]. By all accounts, Hector was the best warrior the Trojans and their allies could field, and his fighting prowess was admired by Greeks and his own people alike.\n\n[[Diomedes]] and [[Odysseus]], when faced with his attack, described him as what [[Robert Fagles]] translated as an 'incredible dynamite' and a 'maniac'.\n\n====Duel with Protesilaus====\nIn the ''[[Iliad]]'', Hector's exploits in the war prior to the events of the book are recapitulated. He had fought the Greek champion [[Protesilaus]] in single combat at the start of the war and killed him. A prophecy had stated that the first Greek to land on Trojan soil would die. Thus, [[Protesilaus]], [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]], and [[Odysseus]] would not land. Finally, Odysseus threw his shield out and landed on that, and Protesilaus jumped next from his own ship. In the ensuing fight, Hector killed him, fulfilling the prophecy.\n\n[[File:Ajax and Hector exchange gifts.jpg|250px|thumb|Ajax and Hector exchange gifts ([[woodcut]] in [[Andrea Alciato|Andreas Alciatus]], ''Emblematum libellus'', 1591).]]\n\n====Duel with Ajax====\nAs described by Homer in the Iliad<ref>''Iliad'', VII 43\u2013305.</ref> at the advice of Hector\u2019s brother [[Helenus]] (who also was divinely inspired) and being told by him that he was not destined to die yet, Hector managed to get both armies seated and challenged any one of the Greek warriors to [[single combat]]. The [[Argives]] were initially reluctant to accept the challenge. However, after [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]]'s chiding, nine Greek [[hero]]es stepped up to the challenge and drew by lot to see who was to face Hector. [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] won and fought Hector. Hector was unable to pierce Ajax's famous shield, but Ajax crushed Hector's shield with a rock and stabbed through his armor with a spear, drawing blood, upon which the god Apollo intervened and the duel was ended as the sun was setting. Hector gave Ajax his sword, which Ajax later used to kill himself. Ajax gave Hector his girdle that Achilles later attached to his chariot to drag Hector's corpse around the walls of Troy.\n\nThe Greeks and the Trojans made a truce to bury the dead. In the early dawn the next day, the Greeks took advantage of the truce to build a wall and ditch around the ships while Zeus watched in the distance.<ref>''Iliad'', VII, 433 ''ff.''</ref>\n\n====Duel with Achilles====\nAnother mention of Hector's exploits in the early years of war was given in the [[Iliad]] in book IX. During the embassy to [[Achilles]], Odysseus, [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoenix]] and [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] all try to persuade Achilles to rejoin the fight. In his response, Achilles points out that while Hector was terrorizing the Greek forces now, and that while he himself had fought in their front lines, Hector had 'no wish' to take his force far beyond the walls and out from the Skiaian Gate and nearby oak tree. He then claims, 'There he stood up to me alone one day, and he barely escaped my onslaught.'\nAnother duel that took place, although Hector received help from [[Aeneas]] (his cousin<ref>https://www.britannica.com/topic/Aeneas</ref>) and Deiphobus, was when Hector rushed to try to save his brother Troilus from Achilles' hands. But he came too late and Troilus had already perished. All Hector could do was to take the lifeless body of Troilus while Achilles escaped after he fought his way through from the Trojans reinforcement.\n\n[[File:Hector Astyanax MN Jatta.jpg|thumb|250px|Hector's last visit with his wife, [[Andromache]], and infant son [[Astyanax]], startled by his father's helmet ([[Apulian vase painting|Apulian red-figure vase]], 370\u2013360 BC)]]\n\nIn the tenth year of the war, observing [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] avoiding combat with [[Menelaus]], Hector upbraids him with having brought trouble on his whole country and now refusing to fight. Paris therefore proposes [[single combat]] between himself and Menelaus, with [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] to go to the victor, ending the war.<ref>''Iliad'', III.</ref> The duel, however, leads to inconclusive results due to intervention by [[Aphrodite]] who leads Paris off the field. After [[Pandarus]]  wounds [[Menelaus]] with an arrow the fight begins again.\n\nThe Greeks attack and drive the Trojans back. Hector must now go out to lead a counter-attack. According to Homer<ref>Iliad, VI 390\u2013480</ref> his wife [[Andromache]], carrying in her arms her son [[Astyanax]], intercepts Hector at the gate, pleading with him not to go out for her sake as well as his son's. Hector knows that Troy and the house of Priam are doomed to fall and that the gloomy fate of his wife and infant son will be to die or go into slavery in a foreign land. With understanding, compassion, and tenderness he explains that he cannot personally refuse to fight, and comforts her with the idea that no one can take him until it is his time to go. The gleaming bronze helmet frightens Astyanax and makes him cry.<ref>This Trojan helmet was made famous by Denys L. Page in ''History and the Homeric Iliad'', Chapter VI, \"Some Mycenaean relics in the Iliad\", as the Greeks do not wear bronze helmets in the poem's [[Oral-formulaic composition|epic formulae]], but they did in the Homeric Age; therefore, scholar Denys L. Page concludes (on other evidence as well) that the bronze helmet of Hector descends in oral poetry from [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] times.</ref> Hector takes it off, embraces his wife and son, and for his sake prays aloud to [[Zeus]] that his son might be chief after him, become more glorious in battle than he, to bring home the blood of his enemies, and make his mother proud. Once he left for battle, those in the house began to mourn as they knew he would not return. Hector and Paris pass through the gate and rally the Trojans, raising havoc among the Greeks.\n\n===Trojan counter-attack===\nZeus [[Weighing of souls|weighs the fates]] of the two armies in the balance, and that of the Greeks sinks down. The Trojans press the Greeks into their camp over the ditch and wall and would have laid hands on the ships, but [[Agamemnon]] rallies the Greeks in person. The Trojans are driven off, night falls, and Hector resolves to take the camp and burn the ships the next day. The Trojans [[Bivouac shelter|bivouac]] in the field.\n{{quote|A thousand camp-fires gleamed upon the plain ....<ref>''Iliad'', VIII, 542 ''ff.''</ref>}}\n\nThe next day Agamemnon rallies the Greeks and drives the Trojans\n{{quote|like a herd of cows maddened with fright when a lion has attacked them ...<ref>''Iliad'', XI, 171 ''ff.''</ref>}}\nHector refrains from battle until Agamemnon leaves the field, wounded in the arm by a spear. Then Hector rallies the Trojans:\n{{quote|... like some fierce tempest that swoops down upon the sea ...|sign=|source=}}\n[[Diomedes]] and [[Odysseus]] hinder Hector and win the Greeks some time to retreat, but the Trojans sweep down upon the wall and rain blows upon it. The Greeks in the camp contest the gates to secure entrance for their fleeing warriors. The Trojans try to pull down the ramparts while the Greeks rain arrows upon them. Hector smashes open a gate with a large stone, clears the gate and calls on the Trojans to scale the wall, which they do, and\n{{quote|... all was uproar and confusion.<ref>''Iliad'', XII.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:THAM-Battle at the ships sarcophagus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Battle at the ships, on a [[Roman Empire|Roman-era]] [[sarcophagus]], 225\u2013250 AD]]\n\nThe battle rages inside the camp. Hector goes down, hit by a stone thrown by Ajax, but [[Apollo]] arrives from Olympus and infuses strength into \"the shepherd of the people\", who orders a chariot attack, with Apollo clearing the way. Many combats, deaths, boasts, threats, epithets, figures of speech, stories, lines of poetry and books of the Iliad later, Hector lays hold of [[Protesilaus]]' ship and calls for fire. The Trojans cannot bring it to him, as Ajax kills everyone who tries. Eventually, Hector breaks Ajax' spear with his sword, forcing him to give ground, and he sets the ship afire.<ref>''Iliad'', XV, end.</ref>\n\nThese events are all according to the will of the gods, who have decreed the fall of Troy, and therefore intend to tempt Achilles back into the war. [[Patroclus]], Achilles' closest companion, disguised in the armor of [[Achilles]], enters the combat leading the [[Myrmidons]] and the rest of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] to force a Trojan withdrawal. After Patroclus has routed the Trojan army, Hector, with the aid of [[Apollo]] and [[Euphorbus]], kills Patroclus, vaunting over him:\n{{quote|\"Wretch! Achilleus, great as he was, could do nothing to help you.\"<ref name=\"The Iliad, book XVI\">The Iliad, book XVI</ref>}}\nThe dying Patroclus foretells Hector's death:\n{{quote|\"You yourself are not one who shall live long, but now already death and powerful destiny are standing beside you, to go down under the hands of Aiakos' great son, Achilleus\"<ref name=\"The Iliad, book XVI\" />}}\n\n===Hector's last fight===\n\n{{quote|Alas! the gods have lured me on to my destruction. ... death is now indeed exceedingly near at hand and there is no way out of it \u2013 for so [[Zeus]] and his son [[Apollo]] the far-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been ever ready to protect me. My doom has come upon me; let me not then die ingloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do some great thing that shall be told among men hereafter.|cite=Spoken by Hector facing [[Achilles]], after a missed spear-throw; ''Iliad'', Book XXII, lines 299\u2013305}}\n\nHector strips the armor of Achilles off the fallen Patroclus and gives it to his men to take back to the city. Glaucus accuses Hector of cowardice for not challenging Ajax. Stung, Hector calls for the armor, puts it on, and uses it to rally the Trojans.  [[Zeus]] regards the donning of a hero's armor as an act of insolence by a fool about to die, but it makes Hector strong for now.<ref>''Iliad'', XVII</ref>\n\nThe next day, the enraged Achilles renounces the wrath that kept him out of action and routs the Trojans, forcing them back to the city. Hector chooses to remain outside the gates of Troy to face Achilles, partly because had he listened to Polydamas and retreated with his troops the previous night, Achilles would not have killed so many Trojans. When he sees Achilles, however, Hector is seized by fear and turns to flee. Achilles chases him around the city three times before Hector masters his fear and turns to face Achilles. But Athena, in the disguise of Hector's brother [[Deiphobus]], has deluded Hector. He requests from Achilles that the victor should return the other's body after the duel, (though Hector himself made it clear he planned to throw the body of Patroclus to the dogs) but Achilles refuses. Achilles hurls his spear at Hector, who dodges it, but Athena brings it back to Achilles' hands without Hector noticing. Hector then throws his own spear at Achilles; it hits his shield and does no injury. When Hector turns to face his supposed brother to retrieve another spear, he sees no one there. At that moment he realizes that he is doomed. Hector decides that he will go down fighting and that men will talk about his bravery in years to come. The desire to achieve ever-lasting honor was one of the most fierce for soldiers living in the timocratic (honor-based) society of the age.\n\n[[File:Triumph of Achilles in Corfu Achilleion.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Triumphant Achilles dragging Hector's lifeless body in [[Troy]]. (A [[fresco]] in the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]], [[Corfu]])]]\nHector pulls out his sword, now his only weapon, and charges. But Achilles grabbed his thrown spears that were delivered to him by the unseen Athena who wore the Hades helmet. Achilles then aimed his spear and pierced the collar bone section of Hector, the only part of the stolen Armor of Achilles that did not protect Hector. The wound was fatal yet allowed Hector to speak to Achilles. In his final moments, Hector begs Achilles for an honorable funeral, but Achilles replies that he will let the dogs and vultures devour Hector's flesh. (Throughout the Homeric poems, several references are made to dogs, vultures, and other creatures that devour the dead. It can be seen as another way of saying one will die.) Hector dies, prophesying that Achilles' death will follow soon:\n\n<blockquote>Be careful now; for I might be made into the gods' curse ... upon you, on that day when Paris and [[Phoibos]] Apollo...destroy you in the Skainan gates, for all your valor.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Iliad|last = Lattimore|first = Richmond|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-226-47049-8|location = |page = 467}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter his death, Achilles slits Hector's heels and passes the girdle that Ajax had given Hector through the slits. He then fastens the girdle to his chariot and drives his fallen enemy through the dust to the [[Danaan]] camp. For the next twelve days, Achilles mistreats the body, but it remains preserved from all injury by [[Apollo]] and [[Aphrodite]]. After these twelve days, the gods can no longer stand watching it and send down two messengers: [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], another messenger god, and Thetis, the mother of Achilles. Thetis has told Achilles to allow King Priam to come and take the body for ransom. Once King Priam has been notified that Achilles will allow him to claim the body, he goes to his strongroom to withdraw the ransom. The ransom King Priam offers includes twelve fine robes, twelve white mantles, several richly embroidered tunics, ten bars of yellow gold, a special gold cup, and several cauldrons. Priam himself goes to claim his son's body, and Hermes grants him safe passage by casting a charm that will make anyone who looks at him fall asleep.\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nThink of thy father, and this helpless face behold\nSee him in me, as helpless and as old!\nThough not so wretched: there he yields to me,\nThe first of men in sovereign misery!\nThus forced to kneel, thus groveling to embrace\nThe scourge and ruin of my realm and race;\nSuppliant my children\u2019s murderer to implore,\nAnd kiss those hands yet reeking with their gore!\n</poem>\n|cite=Spoken by [[Priam]] to [[Achilles]]; ''Iliad'', Book XXIV, [[Alexander Pope|Pope's]] translation}}\n\nAchilles, moved by Priam's actions and following his mother's orders sent by Zeus, returns Hector's body to Priam and promises him a truce of twelve days to allow the Trojans to perform funeral rites for Hector. Priam returns to Troy with the body of his son, and it is given full funeral honors. Even Helen mourns Hector, for he had always been kind to her and protected her from spite. The last lines of the ''Iliad'' are dedicated to Hector's funeral. Homer concludes by referring to the Trojan prince as the \"Breaker of Horses.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Pseudo-Apollodorus |title=[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]] |at=III, xii, 5\u20136; \"Epitome\" IV, 2}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', the dead Hector appears to Aeneas in a dream urging him to flee Troy.<ref>https://news.ku.edu/2015/05/22/were-some-dreams-ancient-roman-poetry-precursor-film</ref>\n\n==Historical references==\nThe most valuable historical evidence for the Battle of Troy are treaties and letters mentioned in [[Hittites|Hittite]] [[cuneiform]] [[Hittite texts#New Kingdom|texts]] of the same approximate era, which mention an unruly Western Anatolian warlord named ''[[Piyama-Radu]]'' (possibly Priam) and his successor ''[[Alaksandu]]'' (possibly Alexander, the nickname of [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]) both based in ''[[Wilusa]]'' (possibly [[Troy|Ilion/Ilios]]), as well as the god ''Apaliunas'' (possibly [[Apollo]]).\n\nOther such pieces of evidence are names of Trojan heroes in [[Linear B]] tablets. Twenty out of fifty-eight men's names also known from Homer, including {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udc01\ud800\udc12\ud800\udc35}}, ''E-ko-to'' (Hector),<ref>{{cite web |title=The Linear B word ''e-ko-to'' |website=Palaeolexicon: Word study tool for ancient languages |url= http://www.palaeolexicon.com/ShowWord.aspx?Id=16717}}</ref> are Trojan warriors and some, including Hector, are in a servile capacity.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=Michael|editor1-last=Ventris |editor2-first=John|editor2-last=Chadwick |title=Documents in Mycenaean Greek |edition=2nd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1973 |page=104 |isbn=978-0-521-08558-8}}</ref> No such conclusion that they are the offspring of Trojan captive women is warranted.

He was married to [[Andromache]], with whom he had an infant son, [[Scamandrius]] (whom the people of Troy called [[Astyanax]]).\n\nDuring the European Middle Ages, Hector figures as one of the [[Nine Worthies]] noted by [[Jacques de Longuyon]], known not only for his courage but also for his noble and courtly nature. Indeed, [[Homer]] places Hector as peace-loving, thoughtful as well as bold, a good son, husband and father, and without darker motives. [[James M. Redfield|James Redfield]] describes Hector as a \"martyr to loyalties, a witness to the things of this world, a hero ready to die for the precious imperfections of ordinary life.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=James M. |last=Redfield |title=Nature and Culture in the Iliad: The Tragedy of Hector |location=Durham |publisher=Duke University Press |date=1994 |page=ix}}</ref>\n\n==Mythology==\n\n===Greatest warrior of Troy===\n\n[[File:Hektor wirft Paris seine Weichlichkeit vor (Tischbein).jpg|thumb|250px|''Hector Admonishes Paris for His Softness and Exhorts Him to Go to War'' by [[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein|J. H. W. Tischbein]] (1751\u20131828)]]\n\nAccording to the ''[[Iliad]]'', Hector did not approve of war between the [[Greeks]] and the Trojans.\n\nFor ten years, the Achaeans besieged Troy and their allies in the east. Hector commanded the Trojan army, with a number of subordinates including [[Polydamas (Iliad)|Polydamas]], and his brothers [[Deiphobus]], [[Helenus]] and [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]. By all accounts, Hector was the best warrior the Trojans and their allies could field, and his fighting prowess was admired by Greeks and his own people alike.\n\n[[Diomedes]] and [[Odysseus]], when faced with his attack, described him as what [[Robert Fagles]] translated as an 'incredible dynamite' and a 'maniac'.\n\n====Duel with Protesilaus====\nIn the ''[[Iliad]]'', Hector's exploits in the war prior to the events of the book are recapitulated. He had fought the Greek champion [[Protesilaus]] in single combat at the start of the war and killed him. A prophecy had stated that the first Greek to land on Trojan soil would die. Thus, [[Protesilaus]], [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]], and [[Odysseus]] would not land. Finally, Odysseus threw his shield out and landed on that, and Protesilaus jumped next from his own ship. In the ensuing fight, Hector killed him, fulfilling the prophecy.\n\n[[File:Ajax and Hector exchange gifts.jpg|250px|thumb|Ajax and Hector exchange gifts ([[woodcut]] in [[Andrea Alciato|Andreas Alciatus]], ''Emblematum libellus'', 1591).]]\n\n====Duel with Ajax====\nAs described by Homer in the Iliad<ref>''Iliad'', VII 43\u2013305.</ref> at the advice of Hector\u2019s brother [[Helenus]] (who also was divinely inspired) and being told by him that he was not destined to die yet, Hector managed to get both armies seated and challenged any one of the Greek warriors to [[single combat]]. The [[Argives]] were initially reluctant to accept the challenge. However, after [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]]'s chiding, nine Greek [[hero]]es stepped up to the challenge and drew by lot to see who was to face Hector. [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] won and fought Hector. Hector was unable to pierce Ajax's famous shield, but Ajax crushed Hector's shield with a rock and stabbed through his armor with a spear, drawing blood, upon which the god Apollo intervened and the duel was ended as the sun was setting. Hector gave Ajax his sword, which Ajax later used to kill himself. Ajax gave Hector his girdle that Achilles later attached to his chariot to drag Hector's corpse around the walls of Troy.\n\nThe Greeks and the Trojans made a truce to bury the dead. In the early dawn the next day, the Greeks took advantage of the truce to build a wall and ditch around the ships while Zeus watched in the distance.<ref>''Iliad'', VII, 433 ''ff.''</ref>\n\n====Duel with Achilles====\nAnother mention of Hector's exploits in the early years of war was given in the [[Iliad]] in book IX. During the embassy to [[Achilles]], Odysseus, [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoenix]] and [[Ajax the Great|Ajax]] all try to persuade Achilles to rejoin the fight. In his response, Achilles points out that while Hector was terrorizing the Greek forces now, and that while he himself had fought in their front lines, Hector had 'no wish' to take his force far beyond the walls and out from the Skiaian Gate and nearby oak tree. He then claims, 'There he stood up to me alone one day, and he barely escaped my onslaught.'\nAnother duel that took place, although Hector received help from [[Aeneas]] (his cousin<ref>https://www.britannica.com/topic/Aeneas</ref>) and Deiphobus, was when Hector rushed to try to save his brother Troilus from Achilles' hands. But he came too late and Troilus had already perished. All Hector could do was to take the lifeless body of Troilus while Achilles escaped after he fought his way through from the Trojans reinforcement.\n\n[[File:Hector Astyanax MN Jatta.jpg|thumb|250px|Hector's last visit with his wife, [[Andromache]], and infant son [[Astyanax]], startled by his father's helmet ([[Apulian vase painting|Apulian red-figure vase]], 370\u2013360 BC)]]\n\nIn the tenth year of the war, observing [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] avoiding combat with [[Menelaus]], Hector upbraids him with having brought trouble on his whole country and now refusing to fight. Paris therefore proposes [[single combat]] between himself and Menelaus, with [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] to go to the victor, ending the war.<ref>''Iliad'', III.</ref> The duel, however, leads to inconclusive results due to intervention by [[Aphrodite]] who leads Paris off the field. After [[Pandarus]]  wounds [[Menelaus]] with an arrow the fight begins again.\n\nThe Greeks attack and drive the Trojans back. Hector must now go out to lead a counter-attack. According to Homer<ref>Iliad, VI 390\u2013480</ref> his wife [[Andromache]], carrying in her arms her son [[Astyanax]], intercepts Hector at the gate, pleading with him not to go out for her sake as well as his son's. Hector knows that Troy and the house of Priam are doomed to fall and that the gloomy fate of his wife and infant son will be to die or go into slavery in a foreign land. With understanding, compassion, and tenderness he explains that he cannot personally refuse to fight, and comforts her with the idea that no one can take him until it is his time to go. The gleaming bronze helmet frightens Astyanax and makes him cry.<ref>This Trojan helmet was made famous by Denys L. Page in ''History and the Homeric Iliad'', Chapter VI, \"Some Mycenaean relics in the Iliad\", as the Greeks do not wear bronze helmets in the poem's [[Oral-formulaic composition|epic formulae]], but they did in the Homeric Age; therefore, scholar Denys L. Page concludes (on other evidence as well) that the bronze helmet of Hector descends in oral poetry from [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] times.</ref> Hector takes it off, embraces his wife and son, and for his sake prays aloud to [[Zeus]] that his son might be chief after him, become more glorious in battle than he, to bring home the blood of his enemies, and make his mother proud. Once he left for battle, those in the house began to mourn as they knew he would not return. Hector and Paris pass through the gate and rally the Trojans, raising havoc among the Greeks.\n\n===Trojan counter-attack===\nZeus [[Weighing of souls|weighs the fates]] of the two armies in the balance, and that of the Greeks sinks down. The Trojans press the Greeks into their camp over the ditch and wall and would have laid hands on the ships, but [[Agamemnon]] rallies the Greeks in person. The Trojans are driven off, night falls, and Hector resolves to take the camp and burn the ships the next day. The Trojans bivouac in the field.\n{{quote|A thousand camp-fires gleamed upon the plain ....<ref>''Iliad'', VIII, 542 ''ff.''</ref>}}\n\nThe next day Agamemnon rallies the Greeks and drives the Trojans\n{{quote|like a herd of cows maddened with fright when a lion has attacked them ...<ref>''Iliad'', XI, 171 ''ff.''</ref>}}\nHector refrains from battle until Agamemnon leaves the field, wounded in the arm by a spear. Then Hector rallies the Trojans:\n{{quote|... like some fierce tempest that swoops down upon the sea ...|sign=|source=}}\n[[Diomedes]] and [[Odysseus]] hinder Hector and win the Greeks some time to retreat, but the Trojans sweep down upon the wall and rain blows upon it. The Greeks in the camp contest the gates to secure entrance for their fleeing warriors. The Trojans try to pull down the ramparts while the Greeks rain arrows upon them. Hector smashes open a gate with a large stone, clears the gate and calls on the Trojans to scale the wall, which they do, and\n{{quote|... all was uproar and confusion.<ref>''Iliad'', XII.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:THAM-Battle at the ships sarcophagus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Battle at the ships, on a [[Roman Empire|Roman-era]] [[sarcophagus]], 225\u2013250 AD]]\n\nThe battle rages inside the camp. Hector goes down, hit by a stone thrown by Ajax, but [[Apollo]] arrives from Olympus and infuses strength into \"the shepherd of the people\", who orders a chariot attack, with Apollo clearing the way. Many combats, deaths, boasts, threats, epithets, figures of speech, stories, lines of poetry and books of the Iliad later, Hector lays hold of [[Protesilaus]]' ship and calls for fire. The Trojans cannot bring it to him, as Ajax kills everyone who tries. Eventually, Hector breaks Ajax' spear with his sword, forcing him to give ground, and he sets the ship afire.<ref>''Iliad'', XV, end.</ref>\n\nThese events are all according to the will of the gods, who have decreed the fall of Troy, and therefore intend to tempt Achilles back into the war. [[Patroclus]], Achilles' closest companion, disguised in the armor of [[Achilles]], enters the combat leading the [[Myrmidons]] and the rest of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] to force a Trojan withdrawal. After Patroclus has routed the Trojan army, Hector, with the aid of [[Apollo]] and [[Euphorbus]], kills Patroclus, vaunting over him:\n{{quote|\"Wretch! Achilleus, great as he was, could do nothing to help you.\"<ref name=\"The Iliad, book XVI\">The Iliad, book XVI</ref>}}\nThe dying Patroclus foretells Hector's death:\n{{quote|\"You yourself are not one who shall live long, but now already death and powerful destiny are standing beside you, to go down under the hands of Aiakos' great son, Achilleus\"<ref name=\"The Iliad, book XVI\" />}}\n\n===Hector's last fight===\n\n{{quote|Alas! the gods have lured me on to my destruction. ... death is now indeed exceedingly near at hand and there is no way out of it \u2013 for so [[Zeus]] and his son [[Apollo]] the far-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been ever ready to protect me. My doom has come upon me; let me not then die ingloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do some great thing that shall be told among men hereafter.|cite=Spoken by Hector facing [[Achilles]], after a missed spear-throw; ''Iliad'', Book XXII, lines 299\u2013305}}\n\nHector strips the armor of Achilles off the fallen Patroclus and gives it to his men to take back to the city. Glaucus accuses Hector of cowardice for not challenging Ajax. Stung, Hector calls for the armor, puts it on, and uses it to rally the Trojans.  [[Zeus]] regards the donning of a hero's armor as an act of insolence by a fool about to die, but it makes Hector strong for now.<ref>''Iliad'', XVII</ref>\n\nThe next day, the enraged Achilles renounces the wrath that kept him out of action and routs the Trojans, forcing them back to the city. Hector chooses to remain outside the gates of Troy to face Achilles, partly because had he listened to Polydamas and retreated with his troops the previous night, Achilles would not have killed so many Trojans. When he sees Achilles, however, Hector is seized by fear and turns to flee. Achilles chases him around the city three times before Hector masters his fear and turns to face Achilles. But Athena, in the disguise of Hector's brother [[Deiphobus]], has deluded Hector. He requests from Achilles that the victor should return the other's body after the duel, (though Hector himself made it clear he planned to throw the body of Patroclus to the dogs) but Achilles refuses. Achilles hurls his spear at Hector, who dodges it, but Athena brings it back to Achilles' hands without Hector noticing. Hector then throws his own spear at Achilles; it hits his shield and does no injury. When Hector turns to face his supposed brother to retrieve another spear, he sees no one there. At that moment he realizes that he is doomed. Hector decides that he will go down fighting and that men will talk about his bravery in years to come. The desire to achieve ever-lasting honor was one of the most fierce for soldiers living in the timocratic (honor-based) society of the age.\n\n[[File:Triumph of Achilles in Corfu Achilleion.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Triumphant Achilles dragging Hector's lifeless body in [[Troy]]. (A [[fresco]] in the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]], [[Corfu]])]]\nHector pulls out his sword, now his only weapon, and charges. But Achilles grabbed his thrown spears that were delivered to him by the unseen Athena who wore the Hades helmet. Achilles then aimed his spear and pierced the collar bone section of Hector, the only part of the stolen Armor of Achilles that did not protect Hector. The wound was fatal yet allowed Hector to speak to Achilles. In his final moments, Hector begs Achilles for an honorable funeral, but Achilles replies that he will let the dogs and vultures devour Hector's flesh. (Throughout the Homeric poems, several references are made to dogs, vultures, and other creatures that devour the dead. It can be seen as another way of saying one will die.) Hector dies, prophesying that Achilles' death will follow soon:\n\n<blockquote>Be careful now; for I might be made into the gods' curse ... upon you, on that day when Paris and [[Phoibos]] Apollo...destroy you in the Skainan gates, for all your valor.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Iliad|last = Lattimore|first = Richmond|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-226-47049-8|location = |page = 467}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter his death, Achilles slits Hector's heels and passes the girdle that Ajax had given Hector through the slits. He then fastens the girdle to his chariot and drives his fallen enemy through the dust to the [[Danaan]] camp. For the next twelve days, Achilles mistreats the body, but it remains preserved from all injury by [[Apollo]] and [[Aphrodite]]. After these twelve days, the gods can no longer stand watching it and send down two messengers: [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], another messenger god, and Thetis, the mother of Achilles. Thetis has told Achilles to allow King Priam to come and take the body for ransom. Once King Priam has been notified that Achilles will allow him to claim the body, he goes to his strongroom to withdraw the ransom. The ransom King Priam offers includes twelve fine robes, twelve white mantles, several richly embroidered tunics, ten bars of yellow gold, a special gold cup, and several cauldrons. Priam himself goes to claim his son's body, and Hermes grants him safe passage by casting a charm that will make anyone who looks at him fall asleep.\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nThink of thy father, and this helpless face behold\nSee him in me, as helpless and as old!\nThough not so wretched: there he yields to me,\nThe first of men in sovereign misery!\nThus forced to kneel, thus groveling to embrace\nThe scourge and ruin of my realm and race;\nSuppliant my children\u2019s murderer to implore,\nAnd kiss those hands yet reeking with their gore!\n</poem>\n|cite=Spoken by [[Priam]] to [[Achilles]]; ''Iliad'', Book XXIV, [[Alexander Pope|Pope's]] translation}}\n\nAchilles, moved by Priam's actions and following his mother's orders sent by Zeus, returns Hector's body to Priam and promises him a truce of twelve days to allow the Trojans to perform funeral rites for Hector. Priam returns to Troy with the body of his son, and it is given full funeral honors. Even Helen mourns Hector, for he had always been kind to her and protected her from spite. The last lines of the ''Iliad'' are dedicated to Hector's funeral. Homer concludes by referring to the Trojan prince as the \"Breaker of Horses.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Pseudo-Apollodorus |title=[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]] |at=III, xii, 5\u20136; \"Epitome\" IV, 2}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', the dead Hector appears to Aeneas in a dream urging him to flee Troy.<ref>https://news.ku.edu/2015/05/22/were-some-dreams-ancient-roman-poetry-precursor-film</ref>\n\n==Historical references==\nThe most valuable historical evidence for the Battle of Troy are treaties and letters mentioned in [[Hittites|Hittite]] [[cuneiform]] [[Hittite texts#New Kingdom|texts]] of the same approximate era, which mention an unruly Western Anatolian warlord named ''[[Piyama-Radu]]'' (possibly Priam) and his successor ''[[Alaksandu]]'' (possibly Alexander, the nickname of [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]) both based in ''[[Wilusa]]'' (possibly [[Troy|Ilion/Ilios]]), as well as the god ''Apaliunas'' (possibly [[Apollo]]).\n\nOther such pieces of evidence are names of Trojan heroes in [[Linear B]] tablets.

He strained his vocal cords as a teenager while part of a local gospel group, leaving the distinctive gravelly voice that was his hallmark in his later years. As a young teen he was a part of a Missionary group called Soul Winners For Christ, which was created by his teen aged friend Jessie Jimerson Phillips, who would go on in later years to write Roberta Martin's last recorded song: (\"I Have Hope\"), the Missionary team also included young Richard D. Henton. The Missionary Team was headquartered at Greater Harvest Baptist Church in Chicago, where Louis H. Boddie was Pastor. The change in his voice led him to focus on his skills as a pianist and later as a composer and arranger. \n\n==Musical career==\n\n===The Gospelaires (The Early Years)===\nIn 1950, Cleveland joined the Gospelaires, a trio led by Norsalus McKissick and Bessie Folk. His arrangements modernized such traditional standards as \"(Give Me That) Old Time Religion\" and \"It's Me O Lord\". After the trio disbanded, an associate of the group, Roberta Martin, hired him as a composer and arranger. The song made brought Cleveland tremendous fame was his rendition of Peace Be Still. In the 60s, Cleveland's singing of that song was viewed as ever so majestic.\n\n===Albertina Walker & The Caravans===\nCleveland subsequently went to work with childhood friend [[Albertina Walker]], popularly referred to as the \"Queen of Gospel & Starmaker\" and founder of [[The Caravans]], as a composer, arranger, pianist, and occasional singer/narrator.<ref>[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-10-09/entertainment/ct-live-1009-albertina-walker-obit-20101009_1_bessie-griffin-inez-andrews-chicago-gospel-music-festival ''Chicago Tribune'', October 9, 2010]</ref>  The Caravans also became the launching pad for today's Gospel legends, who are also former members along with Cleveland such as [[Shirley Caesar]] (known as the 1st Lady of Gospel), [[Cassietta George]] (who co-wrote some of the groups best hits), Delores Washington, Josephine Howard (Mother to R&B artist, [[Miki Howard]]), [[Inez Andrews]] (who's song Mary Don't You Weep became a staple in the industry), [[Dorothy Norwood]] (known as Gospel's Greatest Story Teller), James Herndon, [[Loleatta Holloway]] (who became a legendary Dance recording artist in the late 70's), and many others. In November 1954, Albertina provided James the opportunity to do his very first recording. By staying out of the studio for a while, she convinced [[States Records]] to allow him to record with her group. He continued to record with The Caravans until States closed down in 1957.<ref name=\"states\">The United and States Labels Part II http://campber.people.clemson.edu/unitedstates2.html Accessed August 12, 2009.</ref>\nBONUS NOTE: Cleveland would later reunite with Albertina in the late 70's with 2 album releases; \"Reunion\" released in 1977, and the iconic classic \"Please Be Patient With Me\" released in 1979 with the Trinity All Nations Choir of Chicago (This album earned Albertina her 1st Gold Record).\n\nThroughout this period, he recorded with other groups like The Gospel All-Stars and The Gospel Chimes, mixing pop ballad influences with traditional shouting.\n\nIn 1959, he recorded a version of [[Ray Charles]]' hit, \"Hallelujah I Love Her So\", as a solo artist. \n\nBy 1960 Cleveland, who had incorporated blues riffs and what Heilbut described as \u201csheer funkiness\u201d in his work, had become associated with a new tenor in gospel music. He became known by more than just the professionals within gospel music with his version of [[The Soul Stirrers|the Soul Stirrers]]' song, \"The Love of God\", backed by the Voices of Tabernacle from [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. The success and sensation of the song's recording led to a record contract with an historic label that would change his life forever.\n\n===Savoy Records, Inc.===\nJames Cleveland signed with the historic jazz label [[Savoy Records]] in 1962, going on to release a huge catalog of soul gospel recordings from that year until his death in 1991, many of which were recorded in a live concert setting. The LIVE concert recording staple started with [[Reverend Lawrence Roberts]], pastor of the First Baptist Church in Nutley, NJ (Home of the famous [[Angelic Choir]]). Rev. Roberts liked the idea of capturing worship in song LIVE on a recording where the listeners can feel and become of a part of the service. Working with Savoy's Executive Producer [[Fred Mendelsohn]], Cleveland and the Angelic Choir of Nutley released two albums before recording the iconic masterpiece, Peace Be Still, in September 1963, which sold thousands of copies at that time and garnered his 1st Gold Album. \"Peace Be Still\" also stayed on the Billboard charts for at least 15 years after its release.\n\n=== The Cleveland Singers ===\nRev. Cleveland moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], to become Minister of Music at Grace Memorial Church of God in Christ where he attained even greater popularity working with keyboardist [[Billy Preston]] and the Angelic Choir of [[Nutley, New Jersey|Nutley]], [[New Jersey]]. He would then return to touring with the newly organized James Cleveland Singers which included Odessa McCastle, Georgia White, Eugene Bryant, and Billy Preston, among others.\n\nIn 1964, Cleveland re-organized The James Cleveland Singers which included Odessa McCastle, Roger Roberts, and [[Gene Viale]] (who became the 1st Latin American to integrate Soul Gospel, and sing with the Cleveland Singers).\n\nIn 1965, Cleveland added Clyde Brown and Charles Barnett to his group which by then was traveling extensively throughout the United States and abroad into the late 1960s, performing in all major venues. This collaboration produced such recordings as \"Heaven That Will Be Good Enough For Me\", \"Two Wings\", and \"The Lord Is Blessing Me Right Now\".\n\nOther singers were added in later years, such as Marva Hines and the renowned soprano soloist, [[Cleo Kennedy]] who were mainstays until his death in 1991.\n\n=== The Southern California Community Choir ===\nCleveland capitalized on his success by founding his own choir, the [[Southern California Community Choir]]. After being nominated numerous times in previous years, James won his 1st Grammy Award with the Southern California Community Choir in 1975 for his 1974 Album release 'In The Ghetto\".  He recorded several albums with SCC between the years of 1970 - 1990. Their most successful albums were the 1979 Grammy nominated release, \"Its A New Day\" (featuring the industry's signature staple, \"God Is\"), there 1981 release, \"Where Is Your Faith\" among many others. His final Grammy Award was received as a posthumous award after his passing in 1991 for his final album with SCC entiltled, 'Having Church\", which features Cleveland's iconic rendition of 1 of [[Tramaine Hawkins]]' signatures, \"What Shall I Do?\", written and composed by Rev. [[Quincy Fielding]].\n\n=== Cornerstone Institutional Baptist Church ===\nIn November of 1970, Rev. Cleveland founded his own ministry and church, Cornerstone Institutional Baptist Church in Los Angeles, California, which grew from ten to thousands of members throughout the remainder of his life. His 1st album with the church choir, dubbed The Voices of Cornerstone, was released in 1980 which featured a wonderful rendition by Cleveland of \"Jesus, Lover of My Soul\" and the title album track, \"A Praying Spirit\" (written by Elbernita \"Twinkie\" Clark and recorded by [[The Clark Sisters]]). The church choir's 2nd album, My Expectations, was released in 1981 with moderate acclaim. By the time of his death, church membership totaled over 7,000.\n\n=== James Cleveland presents... ===\nFrom the 1970s until 1990, Cleveland would bring together a number of artists to back him on appearances and records. He also continued to introduce, appear and record with some of the most notable gospel choirs and independent artists of the time; many of whom became legends in their own right, such as: The [[Donald Vails]] Choraleers (Detroit), The Harold Smith Majestics (whom he recorded the classic \"Lord, Help Me To Hold Out), The Los Angeles Gospel Messengers (the last choir to record with Cleveland before he passed), New Jerusalem Baptist Church Choir (Flint, Michigan), Henry Jackson, The Craig Brothers, The Salem Inspirational Choir (from Omaha, Nebraska with whom he recorded the iconic staple \"I Don't Feel Noways Tired\"), Rev.

L. Franklin]], father of the Queen of Soul, [[Aretha Franklin]], was pastor. In 1972, James collaborated with Aretha on her historic Grammy-winning and multi-million selling album ''[[Amazing_Grace_(Aretha_Franklin_album)|Amazing Grace]]'', which is known as the Greatest Gospel Album of All Time''.''

This historic recording was also filmed by director  [[Sydney Pollack]] for possible documentary release, but due to a technical issue of not using a [[clapperboard]] to synchronize the audio with the video, the film was unusable, and was left shelved for the next 47 years.<ref name=\"Grieving2019\"/> Before he died, Pollack authorized producer Alan Elliott to try to complete the film.<ref name=\"Grieving2019\"/> Unaware of the synchronization problem, Elliot mortgaged his own house to buy the [[film negative]] from [[Warner Brothers]], but was able to use modern technology to bring audio and video together.<ref name=\"Grieving2019\"/> The completed documentary was finally released in April 2019 playing in select theaters across the United States, beginning with a premier at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church.<ref name=\"Grieving2019\"/>\n\n=== GOSPEL - The Motion Picture ===\nThe historic documentary film \"Gospel\", released in 1983 features James Cleveland for the 1st time on Motion Picture screen, along with the Southern California Community Choir, [[Walter Hawkins]] & the Family, The [[Mighty Clouds of Joy]], Shirley Caesar, and The Clark Sisters. The film was directed by David Leivick and Frederick A. Ritzenberg. Excerpts from the film soundtrack was released on Savoy Records and became a top seller, with Rev. Cleveland having the majority feature on side 2 of the album.\n\n==Gospel Music Workshop of America==\nIn 1968, Cleveland taught others how to achieve the modern gospel sound and preserve the industry's rich legacy through his annual workshop convention entitled, The [[Gospel Music Workshop of America]] (or, the GMWA), an organization that he co-founded with Dr. Albertina Walker and which now has over 150 chapters with 30,000 members. The GMWA has featured and produced the likes of [[Donald Vails]], [[Issac Douglas]], [[Myrna Summers]], Sara Jordan Powell, [[Daryl Coley]], [[John P. Kee]], [[Kirk Franklin]], [[Kurt Carr]], [[Donald Lawrence]] and [[Yolanda Adams]] just to name a few. The purpose of the workshop was to bring together singers from all over the country in order to perpetuate the art of gospel music. The workshops eventually attracted thousands of adherents and laid the groundwork for the popularity of gospel music.  The last album Cleveland recorded with the GMWA was their 1990 release from the previous year's annual convention in New Orleans, which features\n\n== Gospel Renditions of Pop Songs ==\nThroughout his recording career, Rev. Cleveland started a trend and was famously known for taking some of the greatest Pop, R&B and Soul songs, and transforming them into Gospel anthems. Out of all the mainstream pop songs he rearranged for Gospel audiences, his most memorable are his classic rendition of [[Gladys Knight & The Pips]] \"The Best Thing That Ever Happened To Me\" which he changed to \"Jesus Is The Best Thing That Ever Happened To Me.\" This rendition earned him a Grammy nomination when it was released in 1975 as his 1st recording with the legendary Charles Fold Singers of Cincinnati, Ohio. Another memorable Gospel rendition was of Pop music icon [[Barry Manilow]]'s \"I Write The Songs\", which he recorded on his 1977 Grammy winning album, \"LIVE At Carnegie Hall.\"  His last song rendition he presented was legendary [[Whitney Houston]]'s classic, \"Didn't We Almost Have It All\", known as \"Aren't You Glad You Know The Lord\", which Cleveland recorded with the Northern & Southern California Choirs of the GMWA in 1990 on the album \"Breathe On Me\" featuring Daryl Coley and current Savoy Records Executive Producer, Rev. [[Milton Biggham]].\n\n== King James Records ==\nFrom 1985 - 1988, Rev.

Dorsey]] was minister of music and [[Roberta Martin]] was pianist for the choir. He strained his vocal cords as a teenager while part of a local gospel group, leaving the distinctive gravelly voice that was his hallmark in his later years. As a young teen he was a part of a Missionary group called Soul Winners For Christ, which was created by his teen aged friend Jessie Jimerson Phillips, who would go on in later years to write Roberta Martin's last recorded song: (\"I Have Hope\"), the Missionary team also included young Richard D. Henton. The Missionary Team was headquartered at Greater Harvest Baptist Church in Chicago, where Louis H. Boddie was Pastor. The change in his voice led him to focus on his skills as a pianist and later as a composer and arranger. \n\n==Musical career==\n\n===The Gospelaires (The Early Years)===\nIn 1950, Cleveland joined the Gospelaires, a trio led by Norsalus McKissick and Bessie Folk. His arrangements modernized such traditional standards as \"(Give Me That) Old Time Religion\" and \"It's Me O Lord\". After the trio disbanded, an associate of the group, Roberta Martin, hired him as a composer and arranger. The song made brought Cleveland tremendous fame was his rendition of Peace Be Still. In the 60s, Cleveland's singing of that song was viewed as ever so majestic.\n\n===Albertina Walker & The Caravans===\nCleveland subsequently went to work with childhood friend [[Albertina Walker]], popularly referred to as the \"Queen of Gospel & Starmaker\" and founder of [[The Caravans]], as a composer, arranger, pianist, and occasional singer/narrator.<ref>[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-10-09/entertainment/ct-live-1009-albertina-walker-obit-20101009_1_bessie-griffin-inez-andrews-chicago-gospel-music-festival ''Chicago Tribune'', October 9, 2010]</ref>  The Caravans also became the launching pad for today's Gospel legends, who are also former members along with Cleveland such as [[Shirley Caesar]] (known as the 1st Lady of Gospel), [[Cassietta George]] (who co-wrote some of the groups best hits), Delores Washington, Josephine Howard (Mother to R&B artist, [[Miki Howard]]), [[Inez Andrews]] (who's song Mary Don't You Weep became a staple in the industry), [[Dorothy Norwood]] (known as Gospel's Greatest Story Teller), James Herndon, [[Loleatta Holloway]] (who became a legendary Dance recording artist in the late 70's), and many others. In November 1954, Albertina provided James the opportunity to do his very first recording. By staying out of the studio for a while, she convinced [[States Records]] to allow him to record with her group. He continued to record with The Caravans until States closed down in 1957.<ref name=\"states\">The United and States Labels Part II http://campber.people.clemson.edu/unitedstates2.html Accessed August 12, 2009.</ref>\nBONUS NOTE: Cleveland would later reunite with Albertina in the late 70's with 2 album releases; \"Reunion\" released in 1977, and the iconic classic \"Please Be Patient With Me\" released in 1979 with the Trinity All Nations Choir of Chicago (This album earned Albertina her 1st Gold Record).\n\nThroughout this period, he recorded with other groups like The Gospel All-Stars and The Gospel Chimes, mixing pop ballad influences with traditional shouting.\n\nIn 1959, he recorded a version of [[Ray Charles]]' hit, \"Hallelujah I Love Her So\", as a solo artist. \n\nBy 1960 Cleveland, who had incorporated blues riffs and what Heilbut described as \u201csheer funkiness\u201d in his work, had become associated with a new tenor in gospel music. He became known by more than just the professionals within gospel music with his version of [[The Soul Stirrers|the Soul Stirrers]]' song, \"The Love of God\", backed by the Voices of Tabernacle from [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. The success and sensation of the song's recording led to a record contract with an historic label that would change his life forever.\n\n===Savoy Records, Inc.===\nJames Cleveland signed with the historic jazz label [[Savoy Records]] in 1962, going on to release a huge catalog of soul gospel recordings from that year until his death in 1991, many of which were recorded in a live concert setting. The LIVE concert recording staple started with [[Reverend Lawrence Roberts]], pastor of the First Baptist Church in Nutley, NJ (Home of the famous [[Angelic Choir]]). Rev. Roberts liked the idea of capturing worship in song LIVE on a recording where the listeners can feel and become of a part of the service. Working with Savoy's Executive Producer [[Fred Mendelsohn]], Cleveland and the Angelic Choir of Nutley released two albums before recording the iconic masterpiece, Peace Be Still, in September 1963, which sold thousands of copies at that time and garnered his 1st Gold Album. \"Peace Be Still\" also stayed on the Billboard charts for at least 15 years after its release.\n\n=== The Cleveland Singers ===\nRev. Cleveland moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], to become Minister of Music at Grace Memorial Church of God in Christ where he attained even greater popularity working with keyboardist [[Billy Preston]] and the Angelic Choir of [[Nutley, New Jersey|Nutley]], [[New Jersey]]. He would then return to touring with the newly organized James Cleveland Singers which included Odessa McCastle, Georgia White, Eugene Bryant, and Billy Preston, among others.\n\nIn 1964, Cleveland re-organized The James Cleveland Singers which included Odessa McCastle, Roger Roberts, and [[Gene Viale]] (who became the 1st Latin American to integrate Soul Gospel, and sing with the Cleveland Singers).\n\nIn 1965, Cleveland added Clyde Brown and Charles Barnett to his group which by then was traveling extensively throughout the United States and abroad into the late 1960s, performing in all major venues. This collaboration produced such recordings as \"Heaven That Will Be Good Enough For Me\", \"Two Wings\", and \"The Lord Is Blessing Me Right Now\".\n\nOther singers were added in later years, such as Marva Hines and the renowned soprano soloist, [[Cleo Kennedy]] who were mainstays until his death in 1991.\n\n=== The Southern California Community Choir ===\nCleveland capitalized on his success by founding his own choir, the [[Southern California Community Choir]]. After being nominated numerous times in previous years, James won his 1st Grammy Award with the Southern California Community Choir in 1975 for his 1974 Album release 'In The Ghetto\".  He recorded several albums with SCC between the years of 1970 - 1990. Their most successful albums were the 1979 Grammy nominated release, \"Its A New Day\" (featuring the industry's signature staple, \"God Is\"), there 1981 release, \"Where Is Your Faith\" among many others. His final Grammy Award was received as a posthumous award after his passing in 1991 for his final album with SCC entiltled, 'Having Church\", which features Cleveland's iconic rendition of 1 of [[Tramaine Hawkins]]' signatures, \"What Shall I Do?\", written and composed by Rev. [[Quincy Fielding]].\n\n=== Cornerstone Institutional Baptist Church ===\nIn November of 1970, Rev. Cleveland founded his own ministry and church, Cornerstone Institutional Baptist Church in Los Angeles, California, which grew from ten to thousands of members throughout the remainder of his life. His 1st album with the church choir, dubbed The Voices of Cornerstone, was released in 1980 which featured a wonderful rendition by Cleveland of \"Jesus, Lover of My Soul\" and the title album track, \"A Praying Spirit\" (written by Elbernita \"Twinkie\" Clark and recorded by [[The Clark Sisters]]). The church choir's 2nd album, My Expectations, was released in 1981 with moderate acclaim. By the time of his death, church membership totaled over 7,000.\n\n=== James Cleveland presents... ===\nFrom the 1970s until 1990, Cleveland would bring together a number of artists to back him on appearances and records. He also continued to introduce, appear and record with some of the most notable gospel choirs and independent artists of the time; many of whom became legends in their own right, such as: The [[Donald Vails]] Choraleers (Detroit), The Harold Smith Majestics (whom he recorded the classic \"Lord, Help Me To Hold Out), The Los Angeles Gospel Messengers (the last choir to record with Cleveland before he passed), New Jerusalem Baptist Church Choir (Flint, Michigan), Henry Jackson, The Craig Brothers, The Salem Inspirational Choir (from Omaha, Nebraska with whom he recorded the iconic staple \"I Don't Feel Noways Tired\"), Rev. [[Richard \"Mr. Clean\" White]], Bishop [[Albert Jamison]] & the Triboro Mass Choir, Rev. Issac Whittmon, Marva Hines, Debbie Austin, The Fourth of May, Quentella Caldwell, [[Sara Jordan Powell]], The Philadelphia Mass Choir, The Houston Mass Choir, The [[New Jersey Mass Choir]], and the award winning [[Charles Fold Singers]] ( from Cincinnati, Ohio with whom Cleveland recorded 5 Albums with, including the Grammy winning 1979 release, \"Make Me An Instrument\"). \n\nAdditionally, he himself backed other acts, contributing to the recordings of such well known artists as [[Aretha Franklin]], Ray Charles and [[Elton John]] just to name a few. \n\n=== Aretha Franklin's Amazing Grace ===\nCleveland also moved to Detroit in the 1960s to take a position as music director at the famed New Bethel Baptist Church where the legendary Reverend [[C. L. Franklin]], father of the Queen of Soul, [[Aretha Franklin]], was pastor. In 1972, James collaborated with Aretha on her historic Grammy-winning and multi-million selling album ''[[Amazing_Grace_(Aretha_Franklin_album)|Amazing Grace]]'', which is known as the Greatest Gospel Album of All Time''.''

This historic recording was also filmed by director  [[Sydney Pollack]] for possible documentary release, but due to a technical issue of not using a [[clapperboard]] to synchronize the audio with the video, the film was unusable, and was left shelved for the next 47 years.<ref name=\"Grieving2019\"/> Before he died, Pollack authorized producer Alan Elliott to try to complete the film.<ref name=\"Grieving2019\"/> Unaware of the synchronization problem, Elliot mortgaged his own house to buy the [[film negative]] from [[Warner Brothers]], but was able to use modern technology to bring audio and video together.<ref name=\"Grieving2019\"/> The completed documentary was finally released in April 2019 playing in select theaters across the United States, beginning with a premier at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church.<ref name=\"Grieving2019\"/>\n\n=== GOSPEL - The Motion Picture ===\nThe historic documentary film \"Gospel\", released in 1983 features James Cleveland for the 1st time on Motion Picture screen, along with the Southern California Community Choir, [[Walter Hawkins]] & the Family, The [[Mighty Clouds of Joy]], Shirley Caesar, and The Clark Sisters. The film was directed by David Leivick and Frederick A. Ritzenberg. Excerpts from the film soundtrack was released on Savoy Records and became a top seller, with Rev. Cleveland having the majority feature on side 2 of the album.\n\n==Gospel Music Workshop of America==\nIn 1968, Cleveland taught others how to achieve the modern gospel sound and preserve the industry's rich legacy through his annual workshop convention entitled, The [[Gospel Music Workshop of America]] (or, the GMWA), an organization that he co-founded with Dr. Albertina Walker and which now has over 150 chapters with 30,000 members. The GMWA has featured and produced the likes of [[Donald Vails]], [[Issac Douglas]], [[Myrna Summers]], Sara Jordan Powell, [[Daryl Coley]], [[John P. Kee]], [[Kirk Franklin]], [[Kurt Carr]], [[Donald Lawrence]] and [[Yolanda Adams]] just to name a few. The purpose of the workshop was to bring together singers from all over the country in order to perpetuate the art of gospel music. The workshops eventually attracted thousands of adherents and laid the groundwork for the popularity of gospel music.  The last album Cleveland recorded with the GMWA was their 1990 release from the previous year's annual convention in New Orleans, which features\n\n== Gospel Renditions of Pop Songs ==\nThroughout his recording career, Rev. Cleveland started a trend and was famously known for taking some of the greatest Pop, R&B and Soul songs, and transforming them into Gospel anthems. Out of all the mainstream pop songs he rearranged for Gospel audiences, his most memorable are his classic rendition of [[Gladys Knight & The Pips]] \"The Best Thing That Ever Happened To Me\" which he changed to \"Jesus Is The Best Thing That Ever Happened To Me.\" This rendition earned him a Grammy nomination when it was released in 1975 as his 1st recording with the legendary Charles Fold Singers of Cincinnati, Ohio. Another memorable Gospel rendition was of Pop music icon [[Barry Manilow]]'s \"I Write The Songs\", which he recorded on his 1977 Grammy winning album, \"LIVE At Carnegie Hall.\"  His last song rendition he presented was legendary [[Whitney Houston]]'s classic, \"Didn't We Almost Have It All\", known as \"Aren't You Glad You Know The Lord\", which Cleveland recorded with the Northern & Southern California Choirs of the GMWA in 1990 on the album \"Breathe On Me\" featuring Daryl Coley and current Savoy Records Executive Producer, Rev. [[Milton Biggham]].\n\n== King James Records ==\nFrom 1985 - 1988, Rev. Cleveland launched his own independent record label, King James Records, which was manufactured and distributed by Detroit's own Sound of Gospel/Nine Records, Inc. Under his label, He released 3 albums with the GMWA, 1 Solo Release, Billy Preston's 1st Gospel album, 2 albums with the Los Angeles Gospel Messengers (which includes their 1st most popular release, Praise 88), 1 album with his iconic Southern California Community Choir, and a resurgence of his James Cleveland presents series, which brought back The Craig Brothers, The Fourth of May and introduced The Harmonizing Four.  Cleveland's record label folded after the closing of his distributor, [[Sound of Gospel]] Records.\n\n==Death==\nOn February 9, 1991, James Cleveland died in [[Culver City, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citylimits.org/content/articles/viewarticle.cfm?article_id=2927|title=The Moving Spirit|date=May 2003|publisher=City Limits Magazine|author=Malcolm Venable|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928091304/http://www.citylimits.org/content/articles/viewarticle.cfm?article_id=2927|archivedate=2007-09-28}}</ref> He was 59.

It was released on April 17, 2020, Apple's first release since ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'' in 2012. Apple began recording the album in 2015, producing and performing it alongside Amy Aileen Wood, [[Sebastian Steinberg]] and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]]. It features a percussive sound, and lyrically explores \"not being afraid to speak\".  The album received universal critical acclaim upon its release, becoming the first album in review aggregator [[Metacritic]]'s history to receive a weighted average score of 100 upon its initial release.\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2012, Apple began conceptualising a new album, considering a [[concept album]] based on her home in [[Venice Beach]] or the [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] in Utah.\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members [[Sebastian Steinberg]], Amy Aileen Wood and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"VultureProfile\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.html|title=Allow Fiona Apple to Reintroduce Herself|last=Handler|first=Rachel|date=April 17, 2020|website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref> They began writing and rehearsing in Apple's [[Venice Beach]] home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success. A few months later, after returning to Venice Beach, they began making progress, with Apple recording long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects. Apple's vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'', explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released \"a million years ago\" and was hoping to put it out in 2020. She also admitted to being reclusive due to ongoing recording sessions at her Venice Beach house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/fiona-apple-is-still-calling-bullshit.html|title=Fiona Apple Is Still Calling Bullshit|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=September 25, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2020, she played the mixes to her band members, whose positive response brought Apple back on track.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> In an interview that month, she said that the album process was in its final stages, with the only things left being \"artwork and stuff\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-soon/|title=Fiona Apple says new album will \"be done soon\"|last=Bacior|first=Robin|website=Consequence of Sound|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-updates.html|title=15 Minutes With Fiona Apple|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=Vulture|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> On March 9, 2020, she revealed that she had finished recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fiona-apple-reveals-her-new-album-is-finished-2622233|title=Fiona Apple reveals her new album is finished|last=Langford|first=Jackson|website=[[NME]]|date=March 9, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\nThe album's sound is percussive and raw. Songs feature looped sections, and sudden tempo changes. Apple's long-time bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]] compared the album to Apple's 2012 song \"Hot Knife\", describing it as \"very raw and unslick\". Lyrically, Apple identified its main theme as \"not being afraid to speak\". She also explores her complex social relationships with other women.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\n==Release==\nOn March 16, 2020, Apple announced the album and its title in an extensive ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' profile.

is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter [[Fiona Apple]]. It was released on April 17, 2020, Apple's first release since ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'' in 2012. Apple began recording the album in 2015, producing and performing it alongside Amy Aileen Wood, [[Sebastian Steinberg]] and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]]. It features a percussive sound, and lyrically explores \"not being afraid to speak\".  The album received universal critical acclaim upon its release, becoming the first album in review aggregator [[Metacritic]]'s history to receive a weighted average score of 100 upon its initial release.\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2012, Apple began conceptualising a new album, considering a [[concept album]] based on her home in [[Venice Beach]] or the [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] in Utah.\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members [[Sebastian Steinberg]], Amy Aileen Wood and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"VultureProfile\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.html|title=Allow Fiona Apple to Reintroduce Herself|last=Handler|first=Rachel|date=April 17, 2020|website=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref> They began writing and rehearsing in Apple's [[Venice Beach]] home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success. A few months later, after returning to Venice Beach, they began making progress, with Apple recording long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects. Apple's vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'', explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released \"a million years ago\" and was hoping to put it out in 2020. She also admitted to being reclusive due to ongoing recording sessions at her Venice Beach house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/fiona-apple-is-still-calling-bullshit.html|title=Fiona Apple Is Still Calling Bullshit|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=September 25, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2020, she played the mixes to her band members, whose positive response brought Apple back on track.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> In an interview that month, she said that the album process was in its final stages, with the only things left being \"artwork and stuff\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-soon/|title=Fiona Apple says new album will \"be done soon\"|last=Bacior|first=Robin|website=Consequence of Sound|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-updates.html|title=15 Minutes With Fiona Apple|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=Vulture|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> On March 9, 2020, she revealed that she had finished recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fiona-apple-reveals-her-new-album-is-finished-2622233|title=Fiona Apple reveals her new album is finished|last=Langford|first=Jackson|website=[[NME]]|date=March 9, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\nThe album's sound is percussive and raw. Songs feature looped sections, and sudden tempo changes. Apple's long-time bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]] compared the album to Apple's 2012 song \"Hot Knife\", describing it as \"very raw and unslick\". Lyrically, Apple identified its main theme as \"not being afraid to speak\". She also explores her complex social relationships with other women.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\n==Release==\nOn March 16, 2020, Apple announced the album and its title in an extensive ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' profile. The title, ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'', is a quote from the British-Irish crime drama television series ''[[The Fall (TV series)|The Fall]]'', where the protagonist, a sex-crimes investigator portrayed by [[Gillian Anderson]], recites the phrase while investigating a crime scene where a woman was tortured.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> The next month, she announced that the album was set to be released digitally on April 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/fiona-apple-releasing-new-album-fetch-the-bolt-cutters-this-month/|title=Fiona Apple Releasing New Album ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'' This Month|last=Minsker|first=Evan|date=April 1, 2020|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| AOTY = 95/100<ref name=\"aoty\">{{cite web |title=Fiona Apple - Fetch the Bolt Cutters - Reviews |url=https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/224348-fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.php |publisher=Album of The Year |accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| ADM = 9.1/10<ref name=\"adm\">{{cite web |title=Fetch The Bolt Cutters by Fiona Apple reviews|url=http://www.anydecentmusic.com/review/11368/Fiona-Apple-Fetch-The-Bolt-Cutters.aspx |publisher=[[AnyDecentMusic?]] |accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| MC = 100/100<ref name=\"MC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/fetch-the-bolt-cutters/fiona-apple|title=Fetch the Bolt Cutters by Fiona Apple Reviews and Tracks|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[The A.V.

He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

[[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E.

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"Good Company\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR2V]] on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986).\n\nIn 1984, [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).\n\n====Amplifiers and effects====\n[[File:VOX AC30 Twin.jpg|thumb|The [[Vox AC30]] amplifier]]\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = I've never heard a guitar sound so loud!

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com|access-date=12 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016064332/http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|archive-date=16 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"Hammer to Fall\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano.

songwriter, producer and astrophysicist. He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

May's contributions increased, although more in terms of arranging than actual writing in most cases. He did some of the arrangement for the heavy solo on the [[Innuendo (song)|title track]].

An earlier version of the band had been loosely formed for 19&nbsp;October 1991, when May took part in the Guitar Legends guitar festival in [[Seville]], Spain. The line-up for his performance was May on vocals and lead guitar, [[Cozy Powell]] on drums and percussion, [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]] and [[Rick Wakeman]] on keyboards, and [[Maggie Ryder]], [[Miriam Stockley]] and [[Chris Thompson (English musician)|Chris Thompson]] on backing vocals.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://jazzbluesrock.online/2018/12/guitar-legends-expo-92-sevilla/ |title=Guitar Legends \u2013 Expo \u201992 Sevilla |website=jazzbluesrock.online |url-status=live |access-date=9 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190929111419/http://jazzbluesrock.online/2018/12/guitar-legends-expo-92-sevilla/ |archive-date=29 September 2019 }}</ref> The original line-up was May on vocals and lead guitar, Powell on drums and percussion, [[Michael Casswell]] on guitar, [[Neil Murray (British musician)|Neil Murray]] on bass, and Ryder, Stockley and Thompson on backing vocals. This version of the band was together only during the South American support tour (supporting [[The B-52's]] and [[Joe Cocker]]) on five dates.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lemieux|first1=Patrick|title=The Queen Chronology|date=2018|publisher=Lulu|page=137|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards, May made significant changes, feeling the group never quite gelled. May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The backing vocalists, Ryder, Stockley and Thompson, were replaced by [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23&nbsp;February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928215832/http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|archive-date=28 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The tour included dates in North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan. After the tour ended on 18&nbsp;December 1993, May returned to the studio with fellow surviving Queen band members Roger Taylor and [[John Deacon]] to work on tracks that became ''Made in Heaven'', the final Queen studio album.<ref name=\"Buckley\">Buckley, Peter (2003). \"The Rough Guide to Rock\". p.837.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled ''Retro Rock Special'' was attached to some pressings of the ''Another World'' album.  The Conway character was retired at the end of the tour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/brian-may-guide-queen-guitarists-eccentricities-obessions/|first=Adam|last=White|title=From badgers to flamboyant alter egos: a guide to the strange obsessions of Queen's Brian May|date=19 July 2017|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=4 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171121165845/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/brian-may-guide-queen-guitarists-eccentricities-obessions/|archive-date=21 November 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\nIn May 1999, May recorded lead guitars for the Guns N' Roses song \"Catcher in the Rye\" on ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'', however, his performance was removed from the album by the time it was released in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/07/brian-may-chinese-democracy|title=Brian May dropped from Guns N' Roses album|last=Anthony|first=James|date=7 November 2008|website=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=4 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180625022027/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/07/brian-may-chinese-democracy|archive-date=25 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132010===\n[[File:Queen 2005 1010016.JPG|thumb|May performing in Frankfurt in 2005.]]\nFrom his last solo release in 1998, May has been performing as a solo artist, as part of an ensemble, and infrequently as Queen with Roger Taylor.

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"Good Company\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

On a couple of videos, he also used some different electric guitars: a Stratocaster copy on \"Play the Game\" (1980) and a [[Washburn RR-V Tour Series|Washburn RR2V]] on \"Princes of the Universe\" (1986).\n\nIn 1984, [[Guild Guitar Company|Guild]] released the first official Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the headstock (May's original one has a sixpence).\n\n====Amplifiers and effects====\n[[File:VOX AC30 Twin.jpg|thumb|The [[Vox AC30]] amplifier]]\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = I've never heard a guitar sound so loud!

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com|access-date=12 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016064332/http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|archive-date=16 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"Hammer to Fall\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano.

Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album).

From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].

E.g. government spending, basic living expenses, and private investing. See Friedman/Meiselman (1963)</ref> claiming moreover that \"[t]he results [of the tests] are strikingly one-sided\".<ref name=original/> They used the following [[reduced form]], [[least squares]] [[regression equation]] to compare the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policies; in effect, to compare [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] and [[monetarist]] theories:\n\n::<math>C_t = \\alpha + VM_t + KA_t</math> (1)\n\nwhere C is induced private consumption, \u03b1 is a [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]], V represents [[money velocity]], M is approximately [[M2 (economics)|M2]], K represents an expenditure-multiplier, A is autonomous expenditures, and ''t'' represents time. Friedman and Meiselman found that, whether using annual data from 1897 to 1958 or quarterly data from 1946 to 1958, and whether using only real, contemporaneous data, or experimenting with various [[Response time (technology)|time lag]]s, [[private consumption]] was not [[statistically significant]]ly affected by discretionary [[fiscal policy]], but was by [[monetary policy]]. They stated that their monetary variables were \"highly [[correlated]]\" with consumption, whereas fiscal policy variables were not.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Debate==\nThe Friedman/Meiselman 1963 paper was addressed with numerous articles, where counter-arguments were made: The model was erroneously specified because important and statistically relevant variables were omitted; the data used were not actually coincident with the theory behind them; there was no correction for the \"[[thermostat]] effect\"<ref group=note>The \"[[thermostat]] effect\" denotes the occasion when discretionary fiscal policy is used because spending and output are down, just as a thermostat senses the house temperature and raises the [[Heating|heat]] so that the temperature is maintained at the desired level. See Bias (2014)</ref> so that even if fiscal policy is effective it will seem to have a neutral or even negative relationship with spending rather than the positive effect it is theorized to have; and that the results were time-specific.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Hester claims bias===\nIn 1964, Donald D. Hester criticized<ref name=hester>Hester (1964)</ref> the F/M paper for \"[[bias]]\" against a \"Keynesian\" outcome. For that purpose, Hester argued that government deficits are endogenously determined, and not exogenously, and thus no single-equation approach could properly capture government spending\nand deficits, while the same principle applies for short-run private investment. Also, Hester\nemphasized that the actual data should have been empirically tested in [[Linear differential equation|first-differential]] form so as to extricate the trends of both explanatory variables, and thus demonstrate only the endogenously generated economic growth. Hester stated that, when he tried \"improved\" data and empirical methods, \u201cthe autonomous expenditure theory outperformed the [[quantity theory of money|quantity theory [of money]]],\u201d i.e. Keynesian economics win over monetarist economics.<ref name=hester/>\n\n===Friedman/Meiselman respond===\nIn a paper published in 1964,<ref name=respond>Friedman/Meiselman (1964)</ref> Friedman and Meiselman conceded that Hester\u2019s suggestion of using first differences was correct and that it is a better method for their single-equation approach. But they insisted that their interpretations of income and autonomous expenditures are\nrelevant, rejecting Hester\u2019s misgivings. They claimed that Hester\u2019s use of [[correlation coefficient]]s with his newly defined autonomous expenditures constituted an \"unsound argument,\"and summarized as follows: \n<blockquote>We remain of the opinion that there is a striking division among students of economic affairs about the role of money in determining the course of economic events. One view is that the quantity of money matters little; the other, that it is a key factor in understanding, and even more, controlling economic change. Our paper tried to present some evidence relevant to deciding between these views. The kind of evidence we gave is not the only kind that is relevant and may not be the most important or significant. And, of course, much other evidence is available from other work by us and by many others. This other evidence needs to be added to and brought to bear on the main issue that divides economists into two groups. Hester does not quarrel with the relevance of our evidence but with the particular form of the income-expenditure theory we use. [Hester's] criticism of our procedure rests primarily on a misunderstanding of the theoretical basis of our approach. He offers neither theoretical argument nor empirical evidence in support of his alternative formulation. Hence his criticism is largely beside the point. That is unfortunate. We badly need work on these problems that will clarify the issues involved. We can ill afford to waste the energy, interest, and ability that Hester displays in his paper on frivolous quibbling.<ref name=respond/></blockquote>\n\n===Ando and Modigliani: both policies affect outcome ===\n[[Albert Ando]] and [[Franco Modigliani]], in a paper published in 1965,<ref name=modi>Ando/Modigliani (1965)</ref> disputed the findings presented in the 1963 Friedman/Meiselman work. Ando and Modigliani claimed that \n<blockquote>[The Friedman/Meiselman 1963 work] has shortcomings in procedures that if repaired change the result, but, moreover, the single-equation approach coupled with the equally single, independent variable\napproach and the corresponding correlations cannot shed light on macro-policy.<ref name=modi/></blockquote>\nThey argued that the consumption function<ref group=note>Friedman, in 1957, had written on the subject of the consumption function a book (Friedman (1957)) that he later stated he considered his \"most important professional contribution\". See Taylor (2001)</ref> was not correctly specified within the F/M use of autonomous expenditures and claimed that the variable that Friedman and Meiselman had derived was actually [[saving]] and not autonomous expenditures. They also observed that the data used in the 1963 paper would need to be modified by including corporate [[retained earnings]], [[transfer payment]]s made by the government to foreigners, and \u201cwage accruals over disbursement.\u201d<ref name=modi/>\n\nAndo and Modigliani objected to the use of an ordinary, [[least squares]] equation because of the induced influence on the independent variable by the dependent variable<ref group=note>Meaning that the independent variable is not really independent</ref> and offered their own [[mathematical model|model]], which ostensibly removed the independent part from the induced part.\n\nAndo and Modigliani criticized the Friedman/Meiselman paper for omitting to determine exogenous and endogenous components to monetary policy in the same manner as economists do with fiscal policy. Instead, Ando and Modigliani, rather than using a standard money-supply variable, introduced M*, which is meant to represent what the money stock would be if [[high powered money]] were \"fully utilized\", thus introducing a \"high-usage variable.\"<ref group=note>This is somewhat akin to a high-[[employment]] fiscal variable. See Bias (2014)</ref> The purpose was to show that money is not [[exogenous]]ly determined: people can choose to hold money in different amounts and levels of [[liquidity]] as situations warrant, while lenders don't need to lend out all of their excess reserves if they so desire - which constitutes a standard Keynesian concept. Moreover, Ando and Modigliani found that the [[standard error|error]] [[variance]] in predicting output<ref group=note>\"NNP\" in the paper, i.e. [[Net National Product]]</ref> was \"much higher\" when using money than any of the fiscal variables and labeled the F & M respective results \"spurious.\"\n\nThey concluded that Friedman and Meiselman\u2019s results were biased in favor of monetary policy, and that, if both policy variables were to be given a balanced approach, the end result would be that both policies would have real and statistically significant effects on the economy. Indeed, in the opening statement of their paper, they state that the \"number of basic shortcomings in [the Friedman/Meiselman] procedure...make the results of their elaborate battery of tests essentially worthless.\"<ref name=modi/> Economists Michael DePrano and Thomas Mayer published<ref name=deprano>DePrano/Mayer (1965)</ref> a critique of the F & M paper that was generally in line with the criticisms leveled by A & M.<ref name=FM1965/>\n\n===FM respond to AM===\nIn 1965, Friedman and Mieselman responded<ref name=FM1965>Friedman/Meiselman (1965)</ref> to the criticism leveled at their 1963 paper, particularly by Ando and Modigliani. They claimed that although one could indeed object to their autonomous-expenditure variable, any of the alternatives that had been put forward by others were equally objectionable. Additionally, Friedman and Meiselman defended their use of their consumption function and explained why it is, in their view, the right method to use. And they pointed out that, unlike them, Ando and Modigliani used nominal data rather than real data and, therefore, the empirical results put forward by A & M could not be correctly comparable to their own.\n\nFriedman and Mieselman agreed in theory with A & M that the term M* is a valid means to determine the exogenous versus the endogenous nature of the policy variable but still disagreed with the actual A & M methodology to determine M*. As to the consumption variance, they maintained that \"of the total variance of consumption for the 25 years, 88 per cent is accounted for by the differences between the means for the two subperiods.\"<ref name=FM1965/>\n\nFinally, they claimed complete lack of bias in their research and the empirical processes and claimed that even if they had built a [[Mathematical model|model]] that seemed to favor monetary policy over fiscal policy, that was because the theory comes out that way. They concluded as follows:\n<blockquote>None of the calculations made by our critics for supposedly the same purpose is correct because they omit some components of income for the income-expenditure calculations, set the two theories different tasks, or use lengthy periods combining two different sub-periods. We have made some of the\ncorrect calculations for one of the alternative concepts of autonomous expenditures (Ando and Modigliani\u2019s). Though less clear-cut, the results are in the same direction as those from our original calculations. Hence, we are left with no reason to change our earlier conclusion that \u201cso far as these data go [and, we may now add, those adduced by Ando and Modigliani, DePrano and Mayer, and Hester]<ref group=note>Text inside brackets in the original</ref> the widespread belief that the investment multiplier is stabler than the monetary velocity is an invalid generalization from the experience of three or four years. It holds for neither later nor earlier years\u201d.<ref name=FM1965/></blockquote>\n\n===The St. Louis equation===\nIn 1968, [[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis]] economists Leonall C. Andersen and Jerry L. Jordan published a study<ref name=andy>Andersen/Jordan (1968)</ref> that fully supported the Friedman and Meiselman single-equation approach but expanded it in response to the criticisms of the 1963 paper.  They offered their own  economic output model, in which where all variables are in [[Linear differential equation|first-differential]] form as denoted by \u2206, as follows:\n\n<math>\\Delta Y_t=\\alpha + \\sum_{i=0}^{4}m_i\\Delta M_{{t-1}} + \\sum_{i=0}^{4}e_i\\Delta E_{{t-1}} + \\sum_{i=0}^{4}z_i\\Delta Z_{{t-1}}</math> (2)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]]; Y is nominal domestic spending; M represents [[monetary policy]] defined by the [[monetary base]]; E represents variously high-[[employment]]\nexpenditures, high-employment receipts, or high-employment surplus; and Z represents a catch-all variable defined as \u201ca variable summarizing all other forces that influence total spending.\u201d Those forces include [[weather]], [[international trade]], preferences, [[technology]], resources, [[infrastructure]], [[war]], etc.{{cn|date=November 2019}} In their math, they used an [[Distributed lag#Finite distributed lags|Almon lag]] technique with 4th-degree [[polynomial]]s and a 4-period time lag.<ref group=note>As denoted by the figure '4' atop the sum sign <math>\\Sigma</math></ref> They concluded that, just as Friedman and Meiselman had found, monetary policy seemed to affect whatever measure was used for spending; but fiscal policy did not.<ref name=andy/>\n\n===De Leeuw and Kalchbrenner: endogenous vs. exogenous===\nIn 1969, Frank DeLeeuw,and J. Kalchbrenner, also St. Louis Fed economists, published an article<ref name=del>DeLeeuw/Kalchbrenner (1969)</ref> that criticized \"severely\"{{cn|date=November 2019}} the Andersen/Jordan study and [[mathematical model|modeling]]. They argued that [[exogenous variable|exogenous]] fiscal policy cannot be properly\nmeasured by using any of the fiscal policy definitions presented by their colleagues, nor can any single-equation approach bring into relief the particular influences of such a policy variable. There exist no ways, they claimed, to separate the [[endogenous variable|endogenous]]- from the exogenous-policy effects because those effects are effectively lost in the complex workings of an entire economy. They pointed out, in particular, that the tax and monetary-base variables are impossibly entangled with the endogeneity-exogeneity problem and claimed that the Andersen/Jordan  method leaves out the influences introduced by [[inflation]].\n\nThe main argument by De Leeuw and Kalchbrenne was that [[causality]] cannot be demonstrated by the single-equation approach, and the direction of causation is impossible to establish, i.e. [[GNP]] could be driving  is fiscal spending rather than the other way around. After making a \"clear improvement\"<ref name=del/> on the Andersen/Jordan model (using high employment receipts adjusted for inflation as the fiscal variable and two different versions of the monetary base), and re-running the \"St. Louis equation\" on the basis of data from 1952 to 1968, they proclaimed that, according to their findings, fiscal expenditures were statistically significant, positively correlated<ref group=note>It was commented that, of course, correlation does not necessarily imply causation. E.g. Gramlich (1971)</ref> to changes in GNP in the long run - as was also true for changes in monetary policy.\n\n===Other arguments===\nIn 1971, [[William L. Silber]]<ref name=silber>Silber (1971)</ref> posited that the researchers were altering their equations to fit into whatever their ideological worldviews were theorizing, which was the reason he gave his paper a \"highly political\"{{cn|date=November 2019}} title. He  questioned the validity of the overall methodology behind the \"St. Louis equation\" approach, after running it in various time periods that were deemed to have the same underlying structural form, and finding that some periods appeared to show fiscal policy as quite significant while others did not.\n\nIn 1971, [[Edward Gramlich]] reviewed<ref name=gram1971>Gramlich (1971)</ref> the \u201cradio debate\" up to that point and compared the multiplier and elasticity estimates for monetary and fiscal policies among the \nseveral different models and the non-single equation models. As he stated, all the models, except the Ando/Modigliani ones, showed monetary policy to have a [[money multiplier|multiplier]] above 1, and in every case to be larger than the [[fiscal multiplier]]. His study, which included a model \"improving\" the St  Louis equation, supported the view that monetary policy is strongly correlated with spending but also found that fiscal policy is correlated as well.\n\nIn 1972, Stephen M. Goldfeld, Alan S. Blinder, John Kareken and William Poole, in their study,<ref name=gold/> criticized the Andersen/Jordan approach as [[econometric]]ally unsound. They argued that, without a reaction function, one cannot determine the nature of the \u201cexogenous\u201d from the \"endogenous\u201d, and that,  if the rules or [[automatic stabilizers]] are done to counter-cyclical perfection, then the [[correlation]]s do not show up with the  statistical significance we would expect. Their paper concludes that the single-equation approach used to empirically determine the comparative efficiency of monetary and fiscal policies is \"without merit.\"<ref name=gold>Goldfeld/Blinder/Kareken/Poole (1972)</ref>\n\nIn 1973, William Poole and Elinda B. F. Kornblith found<ref name=poole>Poole/Kornblith (1973)</ref> that all the models tended to \"underpredict,\" and attempted to provide hypotheses for that result. Their conclusion was that the \u201cdecision [about which models were correct or supported monetary or fiscal policies] must still be rated a draw.\u201d<ref name=poole/> In 1975, J. W. Elliot conducted an empirical analysis and pointed out the difficulty of comparing the regression coefficients as \u201cmultipliers\u201d since their corresponding variables are money, which is a [[Stock and flow|stock]], and fiscal spending, which is a [[Stock and flow|flow]]. He concluded that, irrespective of technique, his results supported the Andersen/Jordan results.\n\n===Ando and Modigliani return===\nIn 1974, at a conference held at [[Brown University]], Ando and Modigliani presented a paper where they recreated an analysis of a simulated economy using the Andersen/Jordan method, which, they concluded, was  biased in favor of monetary policy. Their work was published in 1976.<ref>Ando/Modigliani (1976)</ref>\n\n===Keith Carlson vs. Benjamin Friedman===\nIn 1977, [[Benjamin M. Friedman|Benjamin Friedman]] found that, using the Andersen/Jordan model but extending the data set out to the 2nd quarter of 1976, fiscal policy was now statistically significant in the determination of expenditures -although serious [[heteroscedasticity]] problems had appeared. He also found that, if he used data starting at the 1st quarter of 1960, the results were even more favorable to discretionary fiscal policy, reiterating the existence in the Andersen/Jordan model of an inherent coefficient bias. Ultimately, he concluded that the St Louis equation methodology was \"not salvageable.\"<ref>Friedman, B. (1977)</ref>\n\nIn response, Keith Carlson, in 1978, made an  empirical modification to the original Andersen/Jordan\nmodel, whereby instead of using a [[differential equation|first-difference approach]], he posited that a rate-of-change approach eliminated the [[heteroscedasticity]] problems discovered by B. Friedman. Carlson\u2019s model is as follows:\n\n<math>\\dot{Y}_t=\\alpha + \\sum_{i=0}^{4}m_i \\dot{M}_{{t-1}} + \\sum_{i=0}^{4}e_i\\ \\dot{E}_{{t-1}} </math> (3)\n\nwhere the variables are the same as in the Andersen/Jordan model but the dots over the terms denote ''growth rates'' for the respective variables. Carlson determined that his model once again supported the original conclusion of [[Statistical significance|significant]] monetary-policy effects and insignificant fiscal-policy effects.\n\n==Outcome==\nNumerous papers have appeared{{cn|date=November 2019}} in the literature, dating from the 1963 original work<ref name=original/> until the 2010s. In 2011, Stefan Belliveau attempted to sum up the debate down to three\n\u201cinterpretations\u201d:<ref name=bel>Belliveau (2011)</ref> [[Real business-cycle theory]] says that neither fiscal nor monetary policy is very effective, essentially rejecting state activism; Keynesian theory suggests that government expenditures can influence economic output while monetary policy is not as effective; and monetarist theory says that monetary policy is effective while fiscal policy is not. To settle the matter, \nBelliveau attempted to salvage the Andersen/Jordan equation by including Gross Value Added by Sector as his output-dependent variable, considering it necessary to look at these data if policymakers are attempting to stabilize economic fluctuations.{{cn|date=November 2019}} Using annual data from 1956 to 2007, Belliveau found empirical support, as claimed, that both monetary and fiscal policy seem to help stabilize an economy,  and considers the use of both policies in the United States as being \"reasonable\" during and after the [[Great Recession]].<ref name=bel/>\n\nMilton Friedman, in a 2000s interview, maintained that \"the debate was over\" and that \"everyone agrees fundamentally\" with the notion of monetary-policy supremacy.<ref name=taylor>Taylor (2001)</ref> He stated that he still had \"far more extreme views about the unimportance of fiscal policy for the aggregate economy than the [economist] profession does.\"<ref name=taylor/> In 2000, a survey of 298 members of the [[American Economic Association]] found that while 84 percent generally agreed with the statement \"Fiscal policy has a significant stimulative impact on a less than fully employed economy\", 71 percent also generally agreed with the statement \"Management of the business cycle should be left to the Federal Reserve; activist fiscal policy should be avoided.\"<ref name=\"Fuller & Geide-Stevenson 2003\" /> In 2011, a follow-up survey of 568 AEA members found that the previous consensus about the latter proposition had dissolved and was by then roughly evenly disputed.<ref name=\"Fuller & Geide-Stevenson 2011\" /> Some [[Heterodox economics|heterodox economists]] (most notably [[Post-Keynesian economics|Post-Keynesians]]) reject in their entirety old and new arguments in favor of monetary policy.<ref>E.g. Mitchell (2016)</ref> As observed by Peter Bias<ref group=note>Dept of Business and Economics at [[Florida Southern College]]</ref> in a 2014 retrospective of the debate, it all \"points to the importance of clearly defining precise, objective functions or theories, and using the appropriate variables and methodologies to empirically test those theories.\"{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Monetarism]]\n*[[Keynesianism]]\n*[[Post-Keynesian economics]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|group=note|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Andersen, Leonall C. & Jerry L Jordan (1968) \u201c[https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/review/68/11/Monetary_Nov1968.pdf Monetary and fiscal actions: a test of their relative importance in economic stabilization]\u201d, ''[[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis]] Review'', 1968, vol.50, pp.&nbsp;11\u201324\n*[[Albert Ando|Ando, Albert]] & [[Franco Modigliani]] (1965) \"The relative stability of monetary velocity and the investment multiplier\", ''[[The American Economic Review]]'', 55.4, pp.&nbsp;693\u2013728\n*[[Albert Ando|Ando, Albert]] & [[Franco Modigliani]] (1976) \"Impacts of fiscal actions on aggregate income and the monetarist controversy: theory and evidence\", ''Monetarism'', North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1976, pp.&nbsp;17\u201342\n*Batten, Dallas S. & Daniel L.

E.g. government spending, basic living expenses, and private investing. See Friedman/Meiselman (1963)</ref> claiming moreover that \"[t]he results [of the tests] are strikingly one-sided\".<ref name=original/> They used the following [[reduced form]], [[least squares]] [[regression equation]] to compare the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policies; in effect, to compare [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] and [[monetarist]] theories:\n\n::<math>C_t = \\alpha + VM_t + KA_t</math> (1)\n\nwhere C is induced private consumption, \u03b1 is a [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]], V represents [[money velocity]], M is approximately [[M2 (economics)|M2]], K represents an expenditure-multiplier, A is autonomous expenditures, and ''t'' represents time. Friedman and Meiselman found that, whether using annual data from 1897 to 1958 or quarterly data from 1946 to 1958, and whether using only real, contemporaneous data, or experimenting with various [[Response time (technology)|time lag]]s, [[private consumption]] was not [[statistically significant]]ly affected by discretionary [[fiscal policy]], but was by [[monetary policy]]. They stated that their monetary variables were \"highly [[correlated]]\" with consumption, whereas fiscal policy variables were not.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Debate==\nThe Friedman/Meiselman 1963 paper was addressed with numerous articles, where counter-arguments were made: The model was erroneously specified because important and statistically relevant variables were omitted; the data used were not actually coincident with the theory behind them; there was no correction for the \"[[thermostat]] effect\"<ref group=note>The \"[[thermostat]] effect\" denotes the occasion when discretionary fiscal policy is used because spending and output are down, just as a thermostat senses the house temperature and raises the [[Heating|heat]] so that the temperature is maintained at the desired level. See Bias (2014)</ref> so that even if fiscal policy is effective it will seem to have a neutral or even negative relationship with spending rather than the positive effect it is theorized to have; and that the results were time-specific.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Hester claims bias===\nIn 1964, Donald D. Hester criticized<ref name=hester>Hester (1964)</ref> the F/M paper for \"[[bias]]\" against a \"Keynesian\" outcome. For that purpose, Hester argued that government deficits are endogenously determined, and not exogenously, and thus no single-equation approach could properly capture government spending\nand deficits, while the same principle applies for short-run private investment. Also, Hester\nemphasized that the actual data should have been empirically tested in [[Linear differential equation|first-differential]] form so as to extricate the trends of both explanatory variables, and thus demonstrate only the endogenously generated economic growth. Hester stated that, when he tried \"improved\" data and empirical methods, \u201cthe autonomous expenditure theory outperformed the [[quantity theory of money|quantity theory [of money]]],\u201d i.e. Keynesian economics win over monetarist economics.<ref name=hester/>\n\n===Friedman/Meiselman respond===\nIn a paper published in 1964,<ref name=respond>Friedman/Meiselman (1964)</ref> Friedman and Meiselman conceded that Hester\u2019s suggestion of using first differences was correct and that it is a better method for their single-equation approach. But they insisted that their interpretations of income and autonomous expenditures are\nrelevant, rejecting Hester\u2019s misgivings. They claimed that Hester\u2019s use of [[correlation coefficient]]s with his newly defined autonomous expenditures constituted an \"unsound argument,\"and summarized as follows: \n<blockquote>We remain of the opinion that there is a striking division among students of economic affairs about the role of money in determining the course of economic events. One view is that the quantity of money matters little; the other, that it is a key factor in understanding, and even more, controlling economic change. Our paper tried to present some evidence relevant to deciding between these views. The kind of evidence we gave is not the only kind that is relevant and may not be the most important or significant. And, of course, much other evidence is available from other work by us and by many others. This other evidence needs to be added to and brought to bear on the main issue that divides economists into two groups. Hester does not quarrel with the relevance of our evidence but with the particular form of the income-expenditure theory we use. [Hester's] criticism of our procedure rests primarily on a misunderstanding of the theoretical basis of our approach. He offers neither theoretical argument nor empirical evidence in support of his alternative formulation. Hence his criticism is largely beside the point. That is unfortunate. We badly need work on these problems that will clarify the issues involved. We can ill afford to waste the energy, interest, and ability that Hester displays in his paper on frivolous quibbling.<ref name=respond/></blockquote>\n\n===Ando and Modigliani: both policies affect outcome ===\n[[Albert Ando]] and [[Franco Modigliani]], in a paper published in 1965,<ref name=modi>Ando/Modigliani (1965)</ref> disputed the findings presented in the 1963 Friedman/Meiselman work. Ando and Modigliani claimed that \n<blockquote>[The Friedman/Meiselman 1963 work] has shortcomings in procedures that if repaired change the result, but, moreover, the single-equation approach coupled with the equally single, independent variable\napproach and the corresponding correlations cannot shed light on macro-policy.<ref name=modi/></blockquote>\nThey argued that the consumption function<ref group=note>Friedman, in 1957, had written on the subject of the consumption function a book (Friedman (1957)) that he later stated he considered his \"most important professional contribution\". See Taylor (2001)</ref> was not correctly specified within the F/M use of autonomous expenditures and claimed that the variable that Friedman and Meiselman had derived was actually [[saving]] and not autonomous expenditures. They also observed that the data used in the 1963 paper would need to be modified by including corporate [[retained earnings]], [[transfer payment]]s made by the government to foreigners, and \u201cwage accruals over disbursement.\u201d<ref name=modi/>\n\nAndo and Modigliani objected to the use of an ordinary, [[least squares]] equation because of the induced influence on the independent variable by the dependent variable<ref group=note>Meaning that the independent variable is not really independent</ref> and offered their own [[mathematical model|model]], which ostensibly removed the independent part from the induced part.\n\nAndo and Modigliani criticized the Friedman/Meiselman paper for omitting to determine exogenous and endogenous components to monetary policy in the same manner as economists do with fiscal policy. Instead, Ando and Modigliani, rather than using a standard money-supply variable, introduced M*, which is meant to represent what the money stock would be if [[high powered money]] were \"fully utilized\", thus introducing a \"high-usage variable.\"<ref group=note>This is somewhat akin to a high-[[employment]] fiscal variable. See Bias (2014)</ref> The purpose was to show that money is not [[exogenous]]ly determined: people can choose to hold money in different amounts and levels of [[liquidity]] as situations warrant, while lenders don't need to lend out all of their excess reserves if they so desire - which constitutes a standard Keynesian concept. Moreover, Ando and Modigliani found that the [[standard error|error]] [[variance]] in predicting output<ref group=note>\"NNP\" in the paper, i.e. [[Net National Product]]</ref> was \"much higher\" when using money than any of the fiscal variables and labeled the F & M respective results \"spurious.\"\n\nThey concluded that Friedman and Meiselman\u2019s results were biased in favor of monetary policy, and that, if both policy variables were to be given a balanced approach, the end result would be that both policies would have real and statistically significant effects on the economy. Indeed, in the opening statement of their paper, they state that the \"number of basic shortcomings in [the Friedman/Meiselman] procedure...make the results of their elaborate battery of tests essentially worthless.\"<ref name=modi/> Economists Michael DePrano and Thomas Mayer published<ref name=deprano>DePrano/Mayer (1965)</ref> a critique of the F & M paper that was generally in line with the criticisms leveled by A & M.<ref name=FM1965/>\n\n===FM respond to AM===\nIn 1965, Friedman and Mieselman responded<ref name=FM1965>Friedman/Meiselman (1965)</ref> to the criticism leveled at their 1963 paper, particularly by Ando and Modigliani. They claimed that although one could indeed object to their autonomous-expenditure variable, any of the alternatives that had been put forward by others were equally objectionable. Additionally, Friedman and Meiselman defended their use of their consumption function and explained why it is, in their view, the right method to use. And they pointed out that, unlike them, Ando and Modigliani used nominal data rather than real data and, therefore, the empirical results put forward by A & M could not be correctly comparable to their own.\n\nFriedman and Mieselman agreed in theory with A & M that the term M* is a valid means to determine the exogenous versus the endogenous nature of the policy variable but still disagreed with the actual A & M methodology to determine M*. As to the consumption variance, they maintained that \"of the total variance of consumption for the 25 years, 88 per cent is accounted for by the differences between the means for the two subperiods.\"<ref name=FM1965/>\n\nFinally, they claimed complete lack of bias in their research and the empirical processes and claimed that even if they had built a [[Mathematical model|model]] that seemed to favor monetary policy over fiscal policy, that was because the theory comes out that way. They concluded as follows:\n<blockquote>None of the calculations made by our critics for supposedly the same purpose is correct because they omit some components of income for the income-expenditure calculations, set the two theories different tasks, or use lengthy periods combining two different sub-periods. We have made some of the\ncorrect calculations for one of the alternative concepts of autonomous expenditures (Ando and Modigliani\u2019s). Though less clear-cut, the results are in the same direction as those from our original calculations. Hence, we are left with no reason to change our earlier conclusion that \u201cso far as these data go [and, we may now add, those adduced by Ando and Modigliani, DePrano and Mayer, and Hester]<ref group=note>Text inside brackets in the original</ref> the widespread belief that the investment multiplier is stabler than the monetary velocity is an invalid generalization from the experience of three or four years. It holds for neither later nor earlier years\u201d.<ref name=FM1965/></blockquote>\n\n===The St. Louis equation===\nIn 1968, [[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis]] economists Leonall C. Andersen and Jerry L. Jordan published a study<ref name=andy>Andersen/Jordan (1968)</ref> that fully supported the Friedman and Meiselman single-equation approach but expanded it in response to the criticisms of the 1963 paper.  They offered their own  economic output model, in which where all variables are in [[Linear differential equation|first-differential]] form as denoted by \u2206, as follows:\n\n<math>\\Delta Y_t=\\alpha + \\sum_{i=0}^{4}m_i\\Delta M_{{t-1}} + \\sum_{i=0}^{4}e_i\\Delta E_{{t-1}} + \\sum_{i=0}^{4}z_i\\Delta Z_{{t-1}}</math> (2)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]]; Y is nominal domestic spending; M represents [[monetary policy]] defined by the [[monetary base]]; E represents variously high-[[employment]]\nexpenditures, high-employment receipts, or high-employment surplus; and Z represents a catch-all variable defined as \u201ca variable summarizing all other forces that influence total spending.\u201d Those forces include [[weather]], [[international trade]], preferences, [[technology]], resources, [[infrastructure]], [[war]], etc.{{cn|date=November 2019}} In their math, they used an [[Distributed lag#Finite distributed lags|Almon lag]] technique with 4th-degree [[polynomial]]s and a 4-period time lag.<ref group=note>As denoted by the figure '4' atop the sum sign <math>\\Sigma</math></ref> They concluded that, just as Friedman and Meiselman had found, monetary policy seemed to affect whatever measure was used for spending; but fiscal policy did not.<ref name=andy/>\n\n===De Leeuw and Kalchbrenner: endogenous vs. exogenous===\nIn 1969, Frank DeLeeuw,and J. Kalchbrenner, also St. Louis Fed economists, published an article<ref name=del>DeLeeuw/Kalchbrenner (1969)</ref> that criticized \"severely\"{{cn|date=November 2019}} the Andersen/Jordan study and [[mathematical model|modeling]]. They argued that [[exogenous variable|exogenous]] fiscal policy cannot be properly\nmeasured by using any of the fiscal policy definitions presented by their colleagues, nor can any single-equation approach bring into relief the particular influences of such a policy variable. There exist no ways, they claimed, to separate the [[endogenous variable|endogenous]]- from the exogenous-policy effects because those effects are effectively lost in the complex workings of an entire economy. They pointed out, in particular, that the tax and monetary-base variables are impossibly entangled with the endogeneity-exogeneity problem and claimed that the Andersen/Jordan  method leaves out the influences introduced by [[inflation]].\n\nThe main argument by De Leeuw and Kalchbrenne was that [[causality]] cannot be demonstrated by the single-equation approach, and the direction of causation is impossible to establish, i.e. [[GNP]] could be driving  is fiscal spending rather than the other way around. After making a \"clear improvement\"<ref name=del/> on the Andersen/Jordan model (using high employment receipts adjusted for inflation as the fiscal variable and two different versions of the monetary base), and re-running the \"St. Louis equation\" on the basis of data from 1952 to 1968, they proclaimed that, according to their findings, fiscal expenditures were statistically significant, positively correlated<ref group=note>It was commented that, of course, correlation does not necessarily imply causation. E.g. Gramlich (1971)</ref> to changes in GNP in the long run - as was also true for changes in monetary policy.\n\n===Other arguments===\nIn 1971, [[William L. Silber]]<ref name=silber>Silber (1971)</ref> posited that the researchers were altering their equations to fit into whatever their ideological worldviews were theorizing, which was the reason he gave his paper a \"highly political\"{{cn|date=November 2019}} title. He  questioned the validity of the overall methodology behind the \"St. Louis equation\" approach, after running it in various time periods that were deemed to have the same underlying structural form, and finding that some periods appeared to show fiscal policy as quite significant while others did not.\n\nIn 1971, [[Edward Gramlich]] reviewed<ref name=gram1971>Gramlich (1971)</ref> the \u201cradio debate\" up to that point and compared the multiplier and elasticity estimates for monetary and fiscal policies among the \nseveral different models and the non-single equation models. As he stated, all the models, except the Ando/Modigliani ones, showed monetary policy to have a [[money multiplier|multiplier]] above 1, and in every case to be larger than the [[fiscal multiplier]]. His study, which included a model \"improving\" the St  Louis equation, supported the view that monetary policy is strongly correlated with spending but also found that fiscal policy is correlated as well.\n\nIn 1972, Stephen M. Goldfeld, Alan S. Blinder, John Kareken and William Poole, in their study,<ref name=gold/> criticized the Andersen/Jordan approach as [[econometric]]ally unsound. They argued that, without a reaction function, one cannot determine the nature of the \u201cexogenous\u201d from the \"endogenous\u201d, and that,  if the rules or [[automatic stabilizers]] are done to counter-cyclical perfection, then the [[correlation]]s do not show up with the  statistical significance we would expect. Their paper concludes that the single-equation approach used to empirically determine the comparative efficiency of monetary and fiscal policies is \"without merit.\"<ref name=gold>Goldfeld/Blinder/Kareken/Poole (1972)</ref>\n\nIn 1973, William Poole and Elinda B. F. Kornblith found<ref name=poole>Poole/Kornblith (1973)</ref> that all the models tended to \"underpredict,\" and attempted to provide hypotheses for that result. Their conclusion was that the \u201cdecision [about which models were correct or supported monetary or fiscal policies] must still be rated a draw.\u201d<ref name=poole/> In 1975, J. W. Elliot conducted an empirical analysis and pointed out the difficulty of comparing the regression coefficients as \u201cmultipliers\u201d since their corresponding variables are money, which is a [[Stock and flow|stock]], and fiscal spending, which is a [[Stock and flow|flow]]. He concluded that, irrespective of technique, his results supported the Andersen/Jordan results.\n\n===Ando and Modigliani return===\nIn 1974, at a conference held at [[Brown University]], Ando and Modigliani presented a paper where they recreated an analysis of a simulated economy using the Andersen/Jordan method, which, they concluded, was  biased in favor of monetary policy. Their work was published in 1976.<ref>Ando/Modigliani (1976)</ref>\n\n===Keith Carlson vs. Benjamin Friedman===\nIn 1977, [[Benjamin M. Friedman|Benjamin Friedman]] found that, using the Andersen/Jordan model but extending the data set out to the 2nd quarter of 1976, fiscal policy was now statistically significant in the determination of expenditures -although serious [[heteroscedasticity]] problems had appeared. He also found that, if he used data starting at the 1st quarter of 1960, the results were even more favorable to discretionary fiscal policy, reiterating the existence in the Andersen/Jordan model of an inherent coefficient bias. Ultimately, he concluded that the St Louis equation methodology was \"not salvageable.\"<ref>Friedman, B. (1977)</ref>\n\nIn response, Keith Carlson, in 1978, made an  empirical modification to the original Andersen/Jordan\nmodel, whereby instead of using a [[differential equation|first-difference approach]], he posited that a rate-of-change approach eliminated the [[heteroscedasticity]] problems discovered by B. Friedman. Carlson\u2019s model is as follows:\n\n<math>\\dot{Y}_t=\\alpha + \\sum_{i=0}^{4}m_i \\dot{M}_{{t-1}} + \\sum_{i=0}^{4}e_i\\ \\dot{E}_{{t-1}} </math> (3)\n\nwhere the variables are the same as in the Andersen/Jordan model but the dots over the terms denote ''growth rates'' for the respective variables. Carlson determined that his model once again supported the original conclusion of [[Statistical significance|significant]] monetary-policy effects and insignificant fiscal-policy effects.\n\n==Outcome==\nNumerous papers have appeared{{cn|date=November 2019}} in the literature, dating from the 1963 original work<ref name=original/> until the 2010s. In 2011, Stefan Belliveau attempted to sum up the debate down to three\n\u201cinterpretations\u201d:<ref name=bel>Belliveau (2011)</ref> [[Real business-cycle theory]] says that neither fiscal nor monetary policy is very effective, essentially rejecting state activism; Keynesian theory suggests that government expenditures can influence economic output while monetary policy is not as effective; and monetarist theory says that monetary policy is effective while fiscal policy is not. To settle the matter, \nBelliveau attempted to salvage the Andersen/Jordan equation by including Gross Value Added by Sector as his output-dependent variable, considering it necessary to look at these data if policymakers are attempting to stabilize economic fluctuations.{{cn|date=November 2019}} Using annual data from 1956 to 2007, Belliveau found empirical support, as claimed, that both monetary and fiscal policy seem to help stabilize an economy,  and considers the use of both policies in the United States as being \"reasonable\" during and after the [[Great Recession]].<ref name=bel/>\n\nMilton Friedman, in a 2000s interview, maintained that \"the debate was over\" and that \"everyone agrees fundamentally\" with the notion of monetary-policy supremacy.<ref name=taylor>Taylor (2001)</ref> He stated that he still had \"far more extreme views about the unimportance of fiscal policy for the aggregate economy than the [economist] profession does.\"<ref name=taylor/> In 2000, a survey of 298 members of the [[American Economic Association]] found that while 84 percent generally agreed with the statement \"Fiscal policy has a significant stimulative impact on a less than fully employed economy\", 71 percent also generally agreed with the statement \"Management of the business cycle should be left to the Federal Reserve; activist fiscal policy should be avoided.\"<ref name=\"Fuller & Geide-Stevenson 2003\" /> In 2011, a follow-up survey of 568 AEA members found that the previous consensus about the latter proposition had dissolved and was by then roughly evenly disputed.<ref name=\"Fuller & Geide-Stevenson 2011\" /> Some [[Heterodox economics|heterodox economists]] (most notably [[Post-Keynesian economics|Post-Keynesians]]) reject in their entirety old and new arguments in favor of monetary policy.<ref>E.g. Mitchell (2016)</ref> As observed by Peter Bias<ref group=note>Dept of Business and Economics at [[Florida Southern College]]</ref> in a 2014 retrospective of the debate, it all \"points to the importance of clearly defining precise, objective functions or theories, and using the appropriate variables and methodologies to empirically test those theories.\"{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Monetarism]]\n*[[Keynesianism]]\n*[[Post-Keynesian economics]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|group=note|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Andersen, Leonall C. & Jerry L Jordan (1968) \u201c[https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/review/68/11/Monetary_Nov1968.pdf Monetary and fiscal actions: a test of their relative importance in economic stabilization]\u201d, ''[[Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis]] Review'', 1968, vol.50, pp.&nbsp;11\u201324\n*[[Albert Ando|Ando, Albert]] & [[Franco Modigliani]] (1965) \"The relative stability of monetary velocity and the investment multiplier\", ''[[The American Economic Review]]'', 55.4, pp.&nbsp;693\u2013728\n*[[Albert Ando|Ando, Albert]] & [[Franco Modigliani]] (1976) \"Impacts of fiscal actions on aggregate income and the monetarist controversy: theory and evidence\", ''Monetarism'', North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1976, pp.&nbsp;17\u201342\n*Batten, Dallas S. & Daniel L.
