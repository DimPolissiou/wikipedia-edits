He attended [[Lake Forest College]] and [[Northwestern University]], but his interest was always in show business. While at Northwestern, he invested $750 in the Broadway musical ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'' starring [[Tallulah Bankhead]]. Though the show was not a hit, he had also invested $1,250 in 1967's ''[[The Happiest Millionaire]],'' which gave him the success he needed to leave school and embark upon a career in entertainment.\n\nIn Chicago in the 1960s, he opened the Civic Theater and financed ''[[The World of Carl Sandburg]]'' starring [[Bette Davis]] and [[Gary Merrill]], as well as [[Eva Le Gallienne]] in ''[[Mary Stuart (play)|Mary Stuart]],'' directed by Sir [[Tyrone Guthrie]], and [[Tennessee Williams]]'s ''Garden District'', featuring [[Cathleen Nesbitt]] and [[Diana Barrymore]]. Carr worked behind the scenes at ''[[Playboy]]'' with [[Hugh Hefner]] and was a co-creator of the ''Playboy Penthouse'' television series, which in turn launched the [[Playboy Club]]s.\n\nThrough the years, he became known as a great planner of promotional events and parties. One such event, a black-tie affair for [[Truman Capote]], took place in an abandoned Los Angeles jail.<ref name=Y>{{cite web|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/allan-carr-rise-fall-hollywood-hedonist-014130665.html|title=Allan Carr: The rise and fall of a Hollywood hedonist|author=Taggart, Frankie|date=May 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Management career==\nIn 1966, Carr founded the talent agency Allan Carr Enterprises, managing the actors [[Tony Curtis]], [[Peter Sellers]],<ref name=Y/> [[Rosalind Russell]], [[Dyan Cannon]], [[Melina Mercouri]], and [[Marlo Thomas]].  Some of the other entertainment figures whose careers he managed were [[Ann-Margret]], a string of whose television specials he also produced: [[Nancy Walker]], [[Marvin Hamlisch]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Peggy Lee]], [[Cass Elliot]],<ref name=Y/> [[Paul Anka]], [[The Four Seasons (band)|Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons]], [[George Maharis]] and [[Herb Alpert|Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass]].\n\nCarr is also credited for having discovered numerous celebrities, including some such, who also became his clients, as [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Mark Hamill]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]],<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/96824/Allan-Carr Allan Carr \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Steve Guttenberg]]<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/01/arts/allan-carr-62-the-producer-of-grease-and-la-cage.html|work=The New York Times|title=Allan Carr, 62, the Producer Of 'Grease' and 'La Cage'|date=July 1, 1999|accessdate=April 23, 2010}}</ref> and [[Lisa Hartman Black|Lisa Hartman]].<ref name=autogenerated1/>\n\n==''Grease'' and Broadway success==\nProducer [[Robert Stigwood]] hired him in 1975 as marketing and promotion consultant, with his first project being for the [[Tommy (1975 film)|film version]] of the [[rock opera]] ''[[The Who's Tommy|Tommy]]''.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The film was a hit and he expanded his involvement for his next film, re-editing and overdubbing a low-budget foreign film about a real-life disaster. The result was ''Survive!'' (The disaster in question was also described in Piers Paul Read's book ''Alive.'') The surprise box office success of ''Survive!'' in 1976 made Carr a wealthy man and gave him clout at [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\nIn 1977, Stigwood asked him to produce the ad campaign for ''[[Saturday Night Fever]],'' and he turned the film's premiere into a star-studded television special. It worked so well that Stigwood gave him ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978). Carr not only helmed the ad campaign and produced the premiere party and television special for ''Grease,'' but also co-produced the film for six million dollars, casting his then client [[Olivia Newton-John]].<ref name=Y/> It became the highest-grossing film of the year, and one of the highest-grossing films up until that time, at just under $100 million. The film was nominated for five [[Golden Globe Awards]] and won two [[People's Choice Awards]], for Best Picture and Best Musical Picture. That year he even appeared in a role on the final season of the [[Angie Dickinson]] television series ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]''. Stigwood and Carr would work on several other films, including 1978 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winner ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''.\n\nThe following year, 1979, he produced the [[Village People]] film musical ''[[Can't Stop the Music|Can't Stop The Music]],''<ref name=Y/> a production which, while campy, steered clear of addressing the band members' presumed homosexuality in the script. Again he orchestrated a lavish series of premieres and a television special that co-starred his friends Hefner and [[Cher]]. But the film was released in 1980, after the crash of the disco craze, and as a result, it was a major flop.<ref name=Y/> Because of this, Carr \"won\" the first annual [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture]] in 1981. Undaunted, he went on to produce ''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982) which, while nowhere near the hit of its predecessor, was not the financial loss that ''Can't Stop The Music'' had been.\n\nWhen Carr was in Paris for the premiere of ''Grease,'' a friend took him to see a play about a gay couple, ''[[La Cage aux Folles (play)|La Cage aux Folles]].'' By this time in his career, Carr was ready to face the gay theme head on. Returning to Broadway he produced [[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|a musical version]] of the 1973 play,<ref name=Y/> which had since been made into a French film, and would later be remade as an American film called ''[[The Birdcage]].'' With a book by [[Harvey Fierstein]] and music and lyrics by [[Jerry Herman]], the show opened in 1983 and was a huge success, running for five years and 1,761 performances.  Nominated in 1984 for eight [[Drama Desk Award]]s and eight [[Tony Award]]s, the show won three Drama Desks and an impressive six Tonys, including a \"Best Musical\" win for Carr.\n\n==Snow White and the Academy Awards==\nCarr's reputation for hosting expensive and lavish parties and creating spectacular production numbers led [[AMPAS]]  to hire him to produce the [[61st Academy Awards]] and create the show based on his promise that he would turn it around from the dry, dull show it had been in previous years. It was inspired by ''[[Beach Blanket Babylon]]'', the musical revue show featuring [[Snow White]] at Hollywood after the dwarves during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AyU_EbgFlc Bruce Vilanch on \"The 1989 Oscars\" with Rob Lowe and Snow White - FoundationINTERVIEWS on YouTube]</ref> Promising \"the antithesis of tacky,\" and despite the best Nielson ratings in five years, it proved to be a career disaster for Allan, culminating in the infamous pairing of Snow White (played by Eileen Bowman) and [[Rob Lowe]] singing a parody of \"[[Proud Mary]].\"<ref name=Y/> Before that, when Snow White first entered the theater from the rear, she seemed to surprise and even put-off the movie stars she was singing to, using a high-pitched imitation (bordering on parody) of the Disney cartoon. During the main number, before Rob Lowe's entrance, a crooning Merv Griffin introduced a procession of once famous Hollywood stars ranging from Alice Faye to Roy Rogers and Dale Evans to Vincent Price, which seemed more forced than natural as the elders were practically guided across the stage by male dancers (some dressed as chairs and tables). Also, there was no host that year. Instead, actors and actresses traded off, ranging from Tom Selleck (who opened) to Bob Hope and Lucille Ball (the latter died three weeks later). His no host theme was centered on \"compadres, costars, couples and companions,\" and his no host theme wouldn't be repeated until the Oscars of 2019.\n\nThe telecast also included a production number featuring what was introduced as \"The Stars of Tomorrow\" doing a number entitled \"I Wanna Be An Oscar Winner\" with all the participants being actors and actresses ranging from the age group of late teens to mid-20s (including Corey Feldman doing a Michael Jackson impression; Christian Slater sword fighting with Tyrone Power Jr.; Chad Lowe shouting \"I am a Thespian\"; Tracy Nelson ballet dancing; Patrick Dempsey tap dancing along the central set stairwell).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAQ9Taunh7w The Stars of Tomorrow: 1989 Oscars]</ref> Due largely to the show's opening number, and despite the shows stellar Nielson ratings, the show became a laughing-stock and went down in history as one of the worst moments in awards show and television history.  [[The Walt Disney Company]] sued for allegedly illegal use of Snow White's image.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/looking-back-oscars-biggest-goof-21211 Looking back at Oscar's biggest goof|Hollywood Reporter]</ref> Meanwhile, Gregory Peck (a personal friend of Carr's) and a number of actors wrote and signed a letter of protest, demanding there never be a show like that again; Peck, in fact, threatened to return his past Oscar if it was ever repeated, which it wasn't. \n\nCarr's reputation in Hollywood never fully recovered from this setback, although his decision to change the award announcement from \"And the winner is...\" to \"And the Oscar goes to...\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT7g5pWzOyw Why the 1989 Oscars Are the Worst Ever - Metaflix on YouTube]</ref> became the norm for awards shows in general, not just for the Oscars. Carr also first hired comedian [[Bruce Vilanch]] as head comedy writer of the show, a job Vilanch still held as of 2015 (Vilanch was redeemed the following year since his old friend Billy Crystal hosted for his first of many times: with Vilanch as his head writer).\n\n==Later work==\nThat same year Carr helmed the project ''[[Goya: A Life in Song]]'' with [[Freddie Gershon]] and [[Sony Music|CBS Records]], a concept album and, later, an off-Broadway musical theater production written by [[Maury Yeston]] (''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]'') and featuring [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]] as artist [[Francisco Goya]].  Still in development for a full Broadway production, the music has been recorded by Domingo with [[Dionne Warwick]] in English and [[Gloria Estefan]] in Spanish, and a version of the duet \"[[Till I Loved You (song)|Till I Loved You]]\" was a top 40 single for [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Don Johnson]].\n\nCarr continued his work in theater, sponsoring the 1995 [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] productions of ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' and ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]'s [[Kennedy Center]] and Broadway's [[Gershwin Theatre]]<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-jun-30-mn-51594-story.html Allan Carr; Producer of 'Grease' and 'La Cage aux Folles' - Los Angeles Times]</ref>, earning 10 Tony nominations between them including one more for Carr.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-allan-carr-1105920.html Obituary: Allan Carr|The Independent]</ref>\nCarr had returned to [[Paramount Pictures]] to handle the re-release of ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' in 1998, which included producing a [[VH1]] television special of the twentieth anniversary Hollywood \"premiere\" screening and party, and special edition re-releases of the video, DVD, and soundtrack album.\n\n==Production career==\nCarr was a film producer for numerous movies, including:\n*''[[The First Time (1969 film)|The First Time]]'' (1969)\n*''[[C.C. and Company]]'' (1970)\n*''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Can't Stop the Music]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Where the Boys Are '84]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Cloak & Dagger (1984 film)|Cloak & Dagger]]'' (1984)\n\n==Personal life and death==\nCarr died on June 29, 1999, in [[Beverly Hills, California]] from [[liver cancer]].<ref name=Y/> At the time of his death, he split his time between his homes in Beverly Hills and [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], and was working on bringing [[Ken Ludwig]]'s Tony-winning comedy ''[[Lend Me a Tenor]]'' to Australia and the UK, and was preparing a new Broadway show, ''The New Musical Adventures of Tom Sawyer''.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\nHis ashes were scattered at sea by Ann-Margret, Roger Smith and Martin Menard in front of his former Diamond Head estate on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2017 a documentary about Carr's life was released entitled ''[[The Fabulous Allan Carr]]''.

The group consisted of vocalist [[Morrissey]], guitarist [[Johnny Marr]], bassist [[Andy Rourke]], and drummer [[Mike Joyce (musician)|Mike Joyce]]. Critics have called them one of the most important bands to emerge from the British [[independent music]] scene of the 1980s. In 2012, all of their studio albums and one of their compilation albums appeared on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].\n\nBased on the songwriting partnership of Morrissey and Marr, the Smiths' focus on a guitar, bass, and drum sound, and their fusion of 1960s rock and [[post-punk]], were a rejection of the [[synthesiser]]-based [[dance-pop]] of the time. Marr's [[Rickenbacker]] guitar work had a [[jangle pop]] sound reminiscent of [[Roger McGuinn]] of [[the Byrds]].<ref name=\"Marr_Byrds\">{{cite web|last=Rosen|first=Steven|title=Johnny Marr on Fender Signature Guitar: 'It Was Such A Privilege'|work=UltimateGuitar.com (interview)|accessdate=5 May 2014|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506000635/http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/johnny_marr_on_fender_signature_guitar_it_was_such_a_privilege.html}}</ref> Morrissey's complex, literate lyrics combined themes about ordinary people with mordant humour.\n\nThe Smiths signed to the independent record label [[Rough Trade Records]]. They have also released several compilations and non-album singles. Several Smiths singles reached the top 20 of the [[UK Singles Chart]] and all of their studio albums reached the top five of the [[UK Albums Chart]], including the number-one album ''[[Meat Is Murder]]'' (1985). They also achieved mainstream success in Europe with ''[[The Queen Is Dead]]'' (1986) and ''[[Strangeways, Here We Come]]'' (1987) which both entered into the top twenty of the [[European Albums Chart]].<ref>{{cite magazine | title =European Hot 100 Albums Chart  |magazine=Music & Media |date=26 July 1986| url = https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/80s/1986/M&M-1986-07-26.pdf|accessdate = 14 Oct 2019|page=26}}<br />{{cite magazine | title =European Hot 100 Albums Chart  |magazine=Music & Media |date=31 October 1987| url = https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/80s/1987/M&M-1987-10-31.pdf|accessdate = 14 Oct 2019|page=26}}</ref> Their posthumous live album ''[[Rank (album)|Rank]]'' (1988) reached the top 10 in Europe.<ref name=rank>{{cite magazine | title =European Hot 100 Albums Chart  |magazine=Music & Media |date=24 September 1988| url = https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/80s/1988/M&M-1988-09-24.pdf|accessdate = 14 Oct 2019|page=26}}</ref> The band won a significant following and remain [[Cult following|cult favourites]].

Morrissey provided the lyrics for \"Don't Blow Your Own Horn\", the first song that they worked on; however, they decided against retaining the song, with Marr commenting that \"neither of us liked it very much\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=17}} The next song that they worked on was \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\", which again was based on lyrics produced by Morrissey. Marr included a tempo which was based on the [[Patti Smith]] song \"Kimberly\", and they recorded it on Marr's TEAC three-track cassette recorder. The third track that the duo worked on was \"[[Suffer Little Children]]\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=18}} Alongside these original compositions, Morrissey suggested that the band produce a cover of \"I Want a Boy for My Birthday\", a song by the 1960s American girl band [[the Cookies]]; although he had never heard of the song before, Marr agreed, enjoying the subversive element of having a male vocalist sing it, and the song was recorded on his TEAC machine.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=22}}\n\nBy the end of the summer of 1982 Morrissey had chosen the band name \"the Smiths\",{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=34|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2p=20}} later informing an interviewer that \"it was the most ordinary name and I thought it was time that the ordinary folk of the world showed their faces\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=20}} Around the time of the band's formation, Morrissey decided that he would be publicly known only by his surname,{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=34|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2p=42}} with Marr referring to him as \"Mozzer\" or \"Moz\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=21}} In 1983 he forbade those around him from using the name \"Steven\", which he despised.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=21}}\n\nAfter remaining with the band for several rehearsals, Pomfret departed acrimoniously.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=19}} He was replaced by the bass player Dale Hibbert, who worked at Manchester's Decibel Studios, where Marr had met him while recording Freak Party's demo.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=20}} It was through Hibbert that the Smiths were able to record their first demo at Decibel, doing so one night in August 1982.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=23}} Aided by drummer [[Simon Wolstencroft]], whom Marr had worked with in Freak Party, the band recorded both \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\" and \"Suffer Little Children\".{{sfn|Goddard|2003|pp=23\u201324}} Wolstencroft was not interested in joining the band, so auditions were held to find a permanent drummer, which resulted in [[Mike Joyce (musician)|Mike Joyce]] joining them; he later revealed that he was under the influence of [[magic mushrooms]] during his audition performance.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=25\u201326}} Meanwhile, Morrissey took the demo recording to [[Factory Records]], but Factory's [[Tony Wilson]] wasn't interested.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=26\u201327}}\n\nIn October 1982 the Smiths gave their first public performance as a support act for [[Blue Rondo \u00e0 la Turk (band)|Blue Rondo \u00e0 la Turk]] during a student music and fashion show, \"An Evening of Pure Pleasure\", at Manchester's [[The Ritz (Manchester)|The Ritz]] venue.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1pp=34, 35|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2p=27}} During the performance, they played both their own compositions and \"I Want a Boy for My Birthday\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=28}} Morrissey had organised the gig's aesthetic; the band came onstage to [[Klaus Nomi]]'s version of [[Henry Purcell]]'s \"The Cold Song\" playing through the venue's sound system before his friend James Maker stepped onstage to introduce the band.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=27\u201329}} Maker remained onstage during the performance, relating that \"I was given a pair of maracas \u2013 an optional extra \u2013 and carte blanche. There were no instructions \u2013 I think it was generally accepted I would ''improvise''... I was there to drink red wine, make extraneous hand gestures and keep well within the tight, chalked circle that Morrissey had drawn around me.\"{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=28\u201329}} Hibbert however was unhappy with what he perceived as the band's gay aesthetic; in turn, Morrissey and Marr were unhappy with his bass playing, so he was removed from the band and replaced by Marr's old school friend [[Andy Rourke]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=36|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2pp=27\u201330}} Hibbert however denies that he had any issue with the band being perceived as a 'gay' band, and was unsure as to the reasons why he was asked to leave the band.<ref>{{cite book| last= Hibbert| first= D |year= 2015| title= Boy Interrupted.

Present at the gig was [[John Walters (broadcaster)|John Walters]], the producer of [[John Peel]]'s [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] show; interested, he invited the band to record a session for the program. Peel expressed the view that \"I was impressed because unlike most bands... you couldn't immediately tell what records they'd been listening to. That's fairly unusual, very rare indeed... It was that aspect of the Smiths that I found most impressive.\"{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=43}} Following this radio exposure, the band gained their first interviews, in music magazines ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]''.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=43}}\n\nThe Smiths then agreed to sign a record contract with Rough Trade, with Travis travelling up to Manchester to meet the band at their Crazy Face rehearsal space; there they signed the contract.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=46\u201347}} Only Morrissey and Marr signed it on behalf of the band, and there was no discussion at the time regarding how the band's earnings would be divided up, something that would lead to the eventual argument over royalties which resulted in the 1996 High Court case.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=47}} To produce the band's first album, Travis brought in [[Troy Tate]] of [[the Teardrop Explodes]], and under Tate's supervision the band recorded their first album, provisionally titled ''The Hand That Rocks the Cradle'', at the Elephant Studios in [[Wapping]], [[East London]].{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=47\u201350}} Rough Trade were unhappy with the album that the band produced and Troy's production of it, ordering the band to redo it with a new producer, [[John Porter (musician)|John Porter]].{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=50\u201351}}\n\nThe band soon generated controversy when [[Gary Bushell]] of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' tabloid alleged that their B-side \"Handsome Devil\" was an endorsement of [[paedophilia]].{{sfnm|1a1=Simpson|1y=2004|1p=108|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2pp=35\u201336}} The band denied this, with Morrissey stating that the song \"has nothing to do with children, and certainly nothing to do with child molesting\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=37}}\n\nThe follow-up singles \"[[This Charming Man]]\" and \"[[What Difference Does It Make?]]\" fared better when they reached numbers 25 and 12 respectively on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"guinness book\">{{Cite book|last=Roberts|first=David (ed.)|title=British Hit Singles & Albums|publisher=[[HIT Entertainment]]|year=2006|edition=19th|pages=509\u2013510|isbn=1-904994-10-5|title-link=Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums}}</ref> Aided by praise from the music press and a series of studio sessions for Peel and [[David Jensen]] at [[BBC Radio 1]], the Smiths began to acquire a dedicated fan base.\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=\"The Smiths brought realism to their romance, and tempered their angst with the lightest of touches.

This album was more strident and political than its predecessor, including the pro-vegetarian title track (Morrissey forbade the rest of the group from being photographed eating meat), the light-hearted republicanism of \"Nowhere Fast\", and the anti-[[corporal punishment]] \"The Headmaster Ritual\" and \"Barbarism Begins at Home\". The band had also grown more diverse musically, with Marr adding rockabilly riffs to \"Rusholme Ruffians\" and Rourke playing a funk bass solo on \"Barbarism Begins at Home\". The album was preceded by the re-release of the B-side \"[[How Soon Is Now?]]\" as a single, and although that song was not on the original [[Phonograph record|LP]], it has been added to subsequent releases. ''Meat Is Murder'' was the band's only album (barring compilations) to reach number one in the UK charts.<ref name=album/> In 2003, the album was ranked number 295 on ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 500 albums of all time|url=http://www.archer2000.net/sbs/awardsrs500.html|accessdate=26 April 2013|publisher=Rolling Stone LLC/Archer & Valerie Productions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102200719/http://www.archer2000.net/sbs/awardsrs500.html|archive-date=2 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMorrissey brought a political stance to many of his interviews, courting further controversy.

A legal dispute with Rough Trade had delayed the album by almost seven months (it had been completed in November 1985), and Marr was beginning to feel the stress of the band's exhausting touring and recording schedule. He later told ''NME'', \"'Worse for wear' wasn't the half of it: I was extremely ill. By the time the tour actually finished it was all getting a little bit&nbsp;... dangerous.

Gannon stayed in the band, switching to rhythm guitar. This five-piece recorded the singles \"[[Panic (The Smiths song)|Panic]]\" and \"[[Ask (song)|Ask]]\" (the latter with [[Kirsty MacColl]] on backing vocals) which reached numbers 11 and 14 respectively on the UK Singles Chart,<ref name=single/> and toured the UK.\n\nAn arrest on drug possession charges almost led to Rourke being replaced by [[Guy Pratt]] for the band's North American tour later that year, until the bassist's work visa came through just before departure. While the shows were successful, heavy drinking and drug use by crew and band members other than Morrissey took a toll on the group,{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} along with ineffective management and lingering disputes with Rough Trade,{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} whom the band was seriously considering leaving for [[EMI]], and [[Sire Records]], their American label,<ref name=\"The Smiths: The Queen Is Dead\"/> who Morrissey felt did not do enough to promote the Smiths{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}.

Johnny Marr was exhausted and took a break from the band in June 1987, which he felt was negatively perceived by his bandmates. In July, Marr left the group because he erroneously thought an ''NME'' article entitled \"Smiths to Split\" was planted by Morrissey.<ref name=\"Johnny Rogan 1992 pp. 281-282\">Johnny Rogan, ''Morrissey and Marr: The Severed Alliance'' (London: Omnibus, 1992), pp.&nbsp;281\u2013282.</ref> That article, written by [[Danny Kelly (journalist)|Danny Kelly]], alleged that Morrissey disliked Marr working with other musicians, and that Marr and Morrissey's personal relationship had reached breaking point.

The breakdown in the relationship has been primarily attributed to Morrissey's irritation by Marr's work with other artists and Marr growing frustrated by Morrissey's musical inflexibility. Marr particularly hated Morrissey's obsession with covering 1960s pop artists such as [[Twinkle (singer)|Twinkle]] and [[Cilla Black]]. Marr recalled in 1992, \"That was the last straw, really.

The resulting album, ''[[Viva Hate]]'' (a reference to the end of the Smiths), was released in March 1988, reaching number one in the UK charts.

The group consisted of vocalist [[Morrissey]], guitarist [[Johnny Marr]], bassist [[Andy Rourke]], and drummer [[Mike Joyce (musician)|Mike Joyce]]. Critics have called them one of the most important bands to emerge from the British [[independent music]] scene of the 1980s. In 2012, all of their studio albums and one of their compilation albums appeared on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].\n\nBased on the songwriting partnership of Morrissey and Marr, the Smiths' focus on a guitar, bass, and drum sound, and their fusion of 1960s rock and [[post-punk]], were a rejection of the [[synthesiser]]-based [[dance-pop]] of the time. Marr's [[Rickenbacker]] guitar work had a [[jangle pop]] sound reminiscent of [[Roger McGuinn]] of [[the Byrds]].<ref name=\"Marr_Byrds\">{{cite web|last=Rosen|first=Steven|title=Johnny Marr on Fender Signature Guitar: 'It Was Such A Privilege'|work=UltimateGuitar.com (interview)|accessdate=5 May 2014|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506000635/http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/johnny_marr_on_fender_signature_guitar_it_was_such_a_privilege.html}}</ref> Morrissey's complex, literate lyrics combined themes about ordinary people with mordant humour.\n\nThe Smiths signed to the independent record label [[Rough Trade Records]]. They have also released several compilations and non-album singles. Several Smiths singles reached the top 20 of the [[UK Singles Chart]] and all of their studio albums reached the top five of the [[UK Albums Chart]], including the number-one album ''[[Meat Is Murder]]'' (1985). They also achieved mainstream success in Europe with ''[[The Queen Is Dead]]'' (1986) and ''[[Strangeways, Here We Come]]'' (1987) which both entered into the top twenty of the [[European Albums Chart]].<ref>{{cite magazine | title =European Hot 100 Albums Chart  |magazine=Music & Media |date=26 July 1986| url = https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/80s/1986/M&M-1986-07-26.pdf|accessdate = 14 Oct 2019|page=26}}<br />{{cite magazine | title =European Hot 100 Albums Chart  |magazine=Music & Media |date=31 October 1987| url = https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/80s/1987/M&M-1987-10-31.pdf|accessdate = 14 Oct 2019|page=26}}</ref> Their posthumous live album ''[[Rank (album)|Rank]]'' (1988) reached the top 10 in Europe.<ref name=rank>{{cite magazine | title =European Hot 100 Albums Chart  |magazine=Music & Media |date=24 September 1988| url = https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/80s/1988/M&M-1988-09-24.pdf|accessdate = 14 Oct 2019|page=26}}</ref> The band won a significant following and remain [[Cult following|cult favourites]].

Morrissey provided the lyrics for \"Don't Blow Your Own Horn\", the first song that they worked on; however, they decided against retaining the song, with Marr commenting that \"neither of us liked it very much\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=17}} The next song that they worked on was \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\", which again was based on lyrics produced by Morrissey. Marr included a tempo which was based on the [[Patti Smith]] song \"Kimberly\", and they recorded it on Marr's TEAC three-track cassette recorder. The third track that the duo worked on was \"[[Suffer Little Children]]\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=18}} Alongside these original compositions, Morrissey suggested that the band produce a cover of \"I Want a Boy for My Birthday\", a song by the 1960s American girl band [[the Cookies]]; although he had never heard of the song before, Marr agreed, enjoying the subversive element of having a male vocalist sing it, and the song was recorded on his TEAC machine.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=22}}\n\nBy the end of the summer of 1982 Morrissey had chosen the band name \"the Smiths\",{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=34|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2p=20}} later informing an interviewer that \"it was the most ordinary name and I thought it was time that the ordinary folk of the world showed their faces\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=20}} Around the time of the band's formation, Morrissey decided that he would be publicly known only by his surname,{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=34|2a1=Simpson|2y=2004|2p=42}} with Marr referring to him as \"Mozzer\" or \"Moz\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=21}} In 1983 he forbade those around him from using the name \"Steven\", which he despised.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=21}}\n\nAfter remaining with the band for several rehearsals, Pomfret departed acrimoniously.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=19}} He was replaced by the bass player Dale Hibbert, who worked at Manchester's Decibel Studios, where Marr had met him while recording Freak Party's demo.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=20}} It was through Hibbert that the Smiths were able to record their first demo at Decibel, doing so one night in August 1982.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=23}} Aided by drummer [[Simon Wolstencroft]], whom Marr had worked with in Freak Party, the band recorded both \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle\" and \"Suffer Little Children\".{{sfn|Goddard|2003|pp=23\u201324}} Wolstencroft was not interested in joining the band, so auditions were held to find a permanent drummer, which resulted in [[Mike Joyce (musician)|Mike Joyce]] joining them; he later revealed that he was under the influence of [[magic mushrooms]] during his audition performance.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=25\u201326}} Meanwhile, Morrissey took the demo recording to [[Factory Records]], but Factory's [[Tony Wilson]] wasn't interested.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=26\u201327}}\n\nIn October 1982 the Smiths gave their first public performance as a support act for [[Blue Rondo \u00e0 la Turk (band)|Blue Rondo \u00e0 la Turk]] during a student music and fashion show, \"An Evening of Pure Pleasure\", at Manchester's [[The Ritz (Manchester)|The Ritz]] venue.{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1pp=34, 35|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2p=27}} During the performance, they played both their own compositions and \"I Want a Boy for My Birthday\".{{sfn|Goddard|2006|p=28}} Morrissey had organised the gig's aesthetic; the band came onstage to [[Klaus Nomi]]'s version of [[Henry Purcell]]'s \"The Cold Song\" playing through the venue's sound system before his friend James Maker stepped onstage to introduce the band.{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=27\u201329}} Maker remained onstage during the performance, relating that \"I was given a pair of maracas \u2013 an optional extra \u2013 and carte blanche. There were no instructions \u2013 I think it was generally accepted I would ''improvise''... I was there to drink red wine, make extraneous hand gestures and keep well within the tight, chalked circle that Morrissey had drawn around me.\"{{sfn|Goddard|2006|pp=28\u201329}} Hibbert however was unhappy with what he perceived as the band's gay aesthetic; in turn, Morrissey and Marr were unhappy with his bass playing, so he was removed from the band and replaced by Marr's old school friend [[Andy Rourke]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bret|1y=2004|1p=36|2a1=Goddard|2y=2006|2pp=27\u201330}} Hibbert however denies that he had any issue with the band being perceived as a 'gay' band, and was unsure as to the reasons why he was asked to leave the band.<ref>{{cite book| last= Hibbert| first= D |year= 2015| title= Boy Interrupted.

This collected singles, B-sides and the versions of songs that had been recorded throughout the previous year for the Peel and Jensen shows.\n\n===''Meat Is Murder''===\nEarly in 1985 the band released their second album, ''[[Meat Is Murder]]''. This album was more strident and political than its predecessor, including the pro-vegetarian title track (Morrissey forbade the rest of the group from being photographed eating meat), the light-hearted republicanism of \"Nowhere Fast\", and the anti-[[corporal punishment]] \"The Headmaster Ritual\" and \"Barbarism Begins at Home\". The band had also grown more diverse musically, with Marr adding rockabilly riffs to \"Rusholme Ruffians\" and Rourke playing a funk bass solo on \"Barbarism Begins at Home\". The album was preceded by the re-release of the B-side \"[[How Soon Is Now?]]\" as a single, and although that song was not on the original [[Phonograph record|LP]], it has been added to subsequent releases. ''Meat Is Murder'' was the band's only album (barring compilations) to reach number one in the UK charts.<ref name=album/> In 2003, the album was ranked number 295 on ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 500 albums of all time|url=http://www.archer2000.net/sbs/awardsrs500.html|accessdate=26 April 2013|publisher=Rolling Stone LLC/Archer & Valerie Productions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102200719/http://www.archer2000.net/sbs/awardsrs500.html|archive-date=2 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMorrissey brought a political stance to many of his interviews, courting further controversy. Among his targets were the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]], the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarchy]], and the famine relief project [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]]. Morrissey famously quipped of the last, \"One can have great concern for the people of [[Ethiopia]], but it's another thing to inflict daily torture on the people of England\"<ref>{{cite web| date=18 November 2004 | title=Band Aid vs. Morrissey&nbsp;... | format=http | work=Overyourhead.co.uk | url=http://www.overyourhead.co.uk/2004/11/band-aid-vs.html | accessdate =22 April 2007}}</ref> (\"torture\" being a reference to the music that resulted from the project).

A legal dispute with Rough Trade had delayed the album by almost seven months (it had been completed in November 1985), and Marr was beginning to feel the stress of the band's exhausting touring and recording schedule. He later told ''NME'', \"'Worse for wear' wasn't the half of it: I was extremely ill. By the time the tour actually finished it was all getting a little bit&nbsp;... dangerous.

The breakdown in the relationship has been primarily attributed to Morrissey's irritation by Marr's work with other artists and Marr growing frustrated by Morrissey's musical inflexibility. Marr particularly hated Morrissey's obsession with covering 1960s pop artists such as [[Twinkle (singer)|Twinkle]] and [[Cilla Black]]. Marr recalled in 1992, \"That was the last straw, really.

The covers of singles rarely featured any text other than the band name, and the band itself did not appear on the cover of any UK release. (Morrissey did, however, appear on an alternative cover for \"What Difference Does It Make?\", mimicking the pose of the original subject, British actor [[Terence Stamp]], after the latter objected to his picture being used.) The choice of cover subjects reflected Morrissey's interest in cult film stars (Stamp, [[Alain Delon]], [[Jean Marais]], [[Andy Warhol|Warhol]] prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Joe Dallesandro]], [[James Dean]]); figures from sixties British popular culture ([[Viv Nicholson]], [[Pat Phoenix]], [[Yootha Joyce]], [[Shelagh Delaney]]); and anonymous images from old films and magazines.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/under_the_covers/the-smiths.htm\n| title = The Smiths.

This contrasted with the exotic high-fashion image cultivated by [[New Romantic]] pop groups such as [[Spandau Ballet]] and [[Duran Duran]] and highlighted in magazines such as ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'' and ''[[i-D]]''. In 1986, when the Smiths performed on the British music programme ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]'', Morrissey wore a fake hearing-aid to support a hearing-impaired fan who was ashamed of using one,<ref>Johnny Rogan, ''Morrissey and Marr: The Severed Alliance'' (London: Omnibus, 1992).</ref> and also frequently wore thick-rimmed [[National Health Service]]-style glasses. Morrissey also would often wave gladioli flowers onstage.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe Smiths have been widely influential. Ian Youngs of [[BBC News]] has described them as \"the band that inspired deeper devotion than any British group since [[the Beatles]]\".<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21323467 | title= Johnny Marr on The Smiths and going solo | first=Ian | last=Youngs | work=BBC News | date=17 February 2013 | accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref> Marr's guitar playing \"was a huge building block for more Manchester legends that followed the Smiths\", including [[the Stone Roses]], whose guitarist [[John Squire]] has said Marr was an influence.<ref>Stephen Dowling, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3005033.stm \"The Smiths: The Influential Alliance,\"] BBC News, 13 May 2003.

The Boston Globe</ref>\n\n''[[Q magazine|Q]]'' magazine's [[Simon Goddard]] argued in 2007 that the Smiths were \"the one truly vital voice of the '80s\" and \"the most influential British guitar group of the decade\". He continued: \"As the first indie outsiders to achieve mainstream success on their own terms (their second album proper, 1985's Meat Is Murder, made Number 1 in the UK), they elevated rock's standard four-piece formula to new heights of magic and poetry. Their legacy can be traced down through the Stone Roses, Oasis and [[the Libertines]] to today's crop of artful young guitar bands.\"<ref>Simon Goddard, \"The Last Rites\", ''Q'', No.&nbsp;250, May 2007.</ref>\n\n''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' magazine's [[Simon Reynolds]] wrote of the band: \"Once upon a time, a band from the North came with a sound so fresh and vigorous it took the nation by storm. The sound was rock, but crucially it was pop, too: concise, punchy, melodic, shiny without being 'plastic'. The singer was a true original, delivering a blend of sensitivity and strength, defiance and tenderness, via a regionally inflected voice. The young man's lips spilled forth words that were realistic without being dour, full of sly humour and beautifully observed detail. Most recognised their debut album as a landmark, an instant classic.\"<ref>Simon Reynolds, ''Uncut'', No.&nbsp;120, May 2007.</ref>\n\nThe \"[[Britpop]] movement pre-empted by the Stone Roses and spearheaded by groups like Oasis, [[Suede (band)|Suede]] and [[Blur (band)|Blur]] drew heavily from Morrissey's portrayal of and nostalgia for a bleak urban England of the past.\"<ref>Chloe Veltman, [http://www.believermag.com/exclusives/?read=article_veltman \"The Passion of the Morrissey\",] ''The Believer''.

It is centered on both sides of [[Lenin's Mausoleum]], initially built in wood in 1924 and rebuilt in [[granite]] in 1929\u20131930. After the last mass burial made in 1921, funerals on Red Square were usually conducted as [[state funeral|state ceremonies]] and reserved as the last honor for notable politicians, military leaders, cosmonauts, and scientists. In 1925\u20131927 burials in the ground were stopped; funerals were now conducted as burials of [[cremated|cremated ash]] in the [[Kremlin wall]] itself. Burials in the ground only resumed with [[Mikhail Kalinin]]'s funeral in 1946. The practice of burying dignitaries at Red Square ended with the funeral of [[Konstantin Chernenko]] in March 1985. The Kremlin Wall Necropolis was designated a protected landmark in 1974.\n\n==The site==\n[[File:Moscow Kremlin, Moat by Nikolskaya tower, 1800.jpg|thumb|240px|right|As recently as in 1800, the site of Necropolis was a boggy [[moat]] spanned with stone bridges.]]\n{{main|Red Square}}\nThe eastern segment of the Kremlin wall, and Red Square behind it, emerged on its present site in the 15th century, during the reign of [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]];<ref>Schmidt, p. 13</ref> the wall and the square were separated with a wide defensive [[moat]] filled with water diverted from the [[Neglinnaya River]]. The moat was lined with a secondary fortress wall, and spanned by three bridges connecting the Kremlin to the [[posad]]. From 1707\u20131708 [[Peter the Great]], expecting a [[Great Northern War|Swedish incursion]] deep into the Russian mainland, restored the moat around the Kremlin, cleared Red Square and built earthen fortifications around [[Nikolskaya tower|Nikolskaya]] and [[Spasskaya tower|Spasskaya]] [[Kremlin towers|towers]]. From 1776\u20131787 [[Matvey Kazakov]] built the [[Kremlin Senate]] that today provides a backdrop for the present-day Necropolis.<ref name=S61>Schmidt, p. 61</ref>\n\nThroughout the 18th century the unused, neglected fortifications deteriorated and were not properly repaired until the 1801 [[coronation]] of [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]].

On 22 September 593 inmates were released; the rest were left behind bars until the [[October Revolution]]. The released soldiers, collectively called ''Dvintsy'', stayed in the city as a cohesive unit, based in [[Zamoskvorechye District]] and openly hostile to the ruling [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]]. Immediately after the October Revolution in Saint Petersburg, ''Dvintsy'' became the strike force of the [[Bolshevik]]s in Moscow. Late at night of 27\u201328 October a detachment of around two hundred men marching north to [[Tverskaya Street]] confronted the loyalist forces near the [[State Historical Museum]] on the [[Red Square]]. In the fighting 70 of the ''Dvintsy'', including their company commander Sapunov, were killed at the barricades.\n\nOn the following day the loyalists, led by Colonel [[Konstantin Ryabtsev]], succeeded in taking over the Kremlin. They gunned down the surrendered Red soldiers at the [[Kremlin Arsenal]] wall. More were killed as the Bolsheviks stormed the Kremlin, finally taking control on the night of 2\u20133 November. Street fighting settled down after having claimed nearly a thousand lives,<ref>Colton, p.85</ref> and on 4 November the new Bolshevik administration decreed their dead would be buried at Red Square next to the [[Kremlin Wall]], where indeed most of them were killed.\n\n<blockquote>\nVoices reached us across the immense place, and the sound of picks and shovels. We crossed over. Mountains of dirt and rock were piled high near the base of the wall.

In the first years of the Soviet regime, the honor of being buried on Red Square was extended to ordinary soldiers, victims of the Civil War, and Moscow militia men killed in clashes with anti-Bolsheviks (March\u2013April 1918). In January 1918, the [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guards]] buried the victims of a terrorist bombing in [[Dorogomilovo District|Dorogomilovo]]. In the same January [[White Movement|White Guards]] fired on a pro-Bolshevik street rally; the eight victims were also buried under the Kremlin wall.<ref name=KV>{{cite web | url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=365934&print=true | title=Sidel-sidel, utrom prosnulis... | year=2003 | publisher=[[Kommersant]] Vlast, N. 7 (510), February 24, 2003 | language=Russian | author=Zhirnov, Yevgeny }}</ref>\n\nThe largest single burial occurred in 1919. On 25 September [[anarchism|anarchists]] led by former [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|socialist revolutionary]] [[Donat Cherepanov]], set off an explosion in a Communist Party school building in [[Leontyevsky Lane]] when Moscow party chief [[Vladimir Zagorsky]] was speaking to students. Twelve people, including Zagorsky, were killed and buried in a mass grave on Red Square. Another unusual incident was a railway crash of 24 July 1921. The [[Aerowagon]], an experimental high-speed railcar fitted with an [[aircraft engine]] and [[propeller]] traction, was not yet tested properly. On the day of the crash it successfully delivered a group of Soviet and foreign communists led by [[Fyodor Sergeyev]] to the [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] [[colliery|collieries]]; on the return route to Moscow the ''aerowagon'' derailed at high speed, killing 7 of the 22 people on board, including its inventor [[Valerian Abakovsky]]. This was the last mass burial in the ground of Red Square.\n\n[[Yakov Sverdlov]], who died in 1919 allegedly from the [[Spanish flu]], was buried in an individual grave near the Senate tower. Later it became the first of twelve individual graves of top-ranking Soviet leaders (see [[#Individual tombs|Individual tombs]] section). Sverdlov was followed by [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]], [[Inessa Armand]], [[Viktor Nogin]] and other notable Bolsheviks and their foreign allies.

The procedure for dealing with human remains in an urn was still unfamiliar at the time, and Vladimirov's urn was carried to his grave in an ordinary coffin. Between 1925 and the opening of the [[Donskoye Cemetery]] crematorium in October 1927,<ref name=M370/> interments in the wall and burials in the ground coexisted together; the former was preferred for foreign dignitaries of the [[Comintern]] ([[Jen\u0151 Landler]], [[Bill Haywood]],<ref name=B43HALF>Half of Haywood's ashes is buried in Moscow, another in Chicago \u2013 Brooke, p. 43</ref> [[Arthur MacManus]], [[Charles Ruthenberg]])<ref name=KV/> while the latter was granted only to top Party executives ([[Mikhail Frunze]], [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]], [[Nariman Narimanov]] and [[Pyotr Voykov]]).\n\nInitially, the bodies of the deceased were [[Lying in state|laid in state]] in the Kremlin's halls, but with tightening of security in the late 1920s the official farewell station was relocated to the [[House of the Unions]]' \"Pillar Hall\" on [[Okhotny Ryad (street)|Okhotny Ryad]] (where Lenin lay in state in 1924) and remained there until the end of the Soviet state.<ref name=KV/> Burials initially took place to the north from the Senate tower, switching to the south side in 1934 and returning to the north side in 1977 (with a few exceptions). Interments in the wall were strictly individual; spouses and children of those interred in the wall had to be buried elsewhere. There were only three instances of group burials: the three-man crew of the [[Osoaviakhim-1]] [[high-altitude balloon]] in 1934, the crew of a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15UTI]] crash in 1968 ([[Yuri Gagarin|Gagarin]] and [[Vladimir Seryogin|Seryogin]]), and the three-man crew of the [[Soyuz 11]] spacecraft in 1971.

Brezhnev overruled Suslov's decision at least once, voting to bury [[Semyon Budenny]] in an individual grave.<ref name=KV/> There were also at least two known cases when groups of professionals pressed the government to extend special honors to their deceased colleagues:\n* In June 1962, following the death of [[Army General]] [[Andrey Khrulyov]], a group of [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|marshals]] pressed the Politburo to bury Khrulyov in the Kremlin wall. Normally, generals of his rank were not entitled to this honor; Khrushchev was known to dislike Khrulyov and suggested burying him at the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]]. The military prevailed, and Khrulyov was buried on Red Square.<ref name=KV/>\n* In January 1970 the official decision to bury [[Pavel Belyayev]] at the Novodevichy Cemetery, already made public through newspapers, was confronted by fellow cosmonauts [[Valentina Tereshkova]], [[Alexei Leonov]], and [[Vladimir Shatalov]] who insisted that Belyaev deserved a place in the Kremlin wall like [[Yuri Gagarin]]. According to [[Nikolai Kamanin]]'s diaries, the cosmonauts, Shatalov in particular, pressed the issue despite knowing that the decision was made by Brezhnev and [[Alexei Kosygin]] and that the funeral commission would not dare to challenge it.<ref>Kamanin, January 11, 1970</ref> Belyaev was buried as planned at the Novodevichy.

It is centered on both sides of [[Lenin's Mausoleum]], initially built in wood in 1924 and rebuilt in [[granite]] in 1929\u20131930. After the last mass burial made in 1921, funerals on Red Square were usually conducted as [[state funeral|state ceremonies]] and reserved as the last honor for notable politicians, military leaders, cosmonauts, and scientists. In 1925\u20131927 burials in the ground were stopped; funerals were now conducted as burials of [[cremated|cremated ash]] in the [[Kremlin wall]] itself. Burials in the ground only resumed with [[Mikhail Kalinin]]'s funeral in 1946. The practice of burying dignitaries at Red Square ended with the funeral of [[Konstantin Chernenko]] in March 1985.

Mass grave on Red Square]]\nIn July 1917, hundreds of soldiers of the Russian Northern Front were arrested for mutiny and desertion and locked up in [[Daugavpils]] (then Dvinsk) fortress. Later, 869 Dvinsk inmates were transported to Moscow. Here, the jailed soldiers launched a [[hunger strike]]; public support for them threatened to develop into a citywide riot. On 22 September 593 inmates were released; the rest were left behind bars until the [[October Revolution]]. The released soldiers, collectively called ''Dvintsy'', stayed in the city as a cohesive unit, based in [[Zamoskvorechye District]] and openly hostile to the ruling [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]]. Immediately after the October Revolution in Saint Petersburg, ''Dvintsy'' became the strike force of the [[Bolshevik]]s in Moscow. Late at night of 27\u201328 October a detachment of around two hundred men marching north to [[Tverskaya Street]] confronted the loyalist forces near the [[State Historical Museum]] on the [[Red Square]]. In the fighting 70 of the ''Dvintsy'', including their company commander Sapunov, were killed at the barricades.\n\nOn the following day the loyalists, led by Colonel [[Konstantin Ryabtsev]], succeeded in taking over the Kremlin. They gunned down the surrendered Red soldiers at the [[Kremlin Arsenal]] wall. More were killed as the Bolsheviks stormed the Kremlin, finally taking control on the night of 2\u20133 November. Street fighting settled down after having claimed nearly a thousand lives,<ref>Colton, p.85</ref> and on 4 November the new Bolshevik administration decreed their dead would be buried at Red Square next to the [[Kremlin Wall]], where indeed most of them were killed.\n\n<blockquote>\nVoices reached us across the immense place, and the sound of picks and shovels. We crossed over. Mountains of dirt and rock were piled high near the base of the wall. Climbing these we looked down into two massive pits, ten or fifteen feet deep and fifty yards long, where hundreds of soldiers and workers were digging in the light of huge fires.

On 25 September [[anarchism|anarchists]] led by former [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|socialist revolutionary]] [[Donat Cherepanov]], set off an explosion in a Communist Party school building in [[Leontyevsky Lane]] when Moscow party chief [[Vladimir Zagorsky]] was speaking to students. Twelve people, including Zagorsky, were killed and buried in a mass grave on Red Square. Another unusual incident was a railway crash of 24 July 1921. The [[Aerowagon]], an experimental high-speed railcar fitted with an [[aircraft engine]] and [[propeller]] traction, was not yet tested properly. On the day of the crash it successfully delivered a group of Soviet and foreign communists led by [[Fyodor Sergeyev]] to the [[Tula, Russia|Tula]] [[colliery|collieries]]; on the return route to Moscow the ''aerowagon'' derailed at high speed, killing 7 of the 22 people on board, including its inventor [[Valerian Abakovsky]].

Sverdlov was followed by [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed]], [[Inessa Armand]], [[Viktor Nogin]] and other notable Bolsheviks and their foreign allies.

The procedure for dealing with human remains in an urn was still unfamiliar at the time, and Vladimirov's urn was carried to his grave in an ordinary coffin. Between 1925 and the opening of the [[Donskoye Cemetery]] crematorium in October 1927,<ref name=M370/> interments in the wall and burials in the ground coexisted together; the former was preferred for foreign dignitaries of the [[Comintern]] ([[Jen\u0151 Landler]], [[Bill Haywood]],<ref name=B43HALF>Half of Haywood's ashes is buried in Moscow, another in Chicago \u2013 Brooke, p. 43</ref> [[Arthur MacManus]], [[Charles Ruthenberg]])<ref name=KV/> while the latter was granted only to top Party executives ([[Mikhail Frunze]], [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]], [[Nariman Narimanov]] and [[Pyotr Voykov]]).\n\nInitially, the bodies of the deceased were [[Lying in state|laid in state]] in the Kremlin's halls, but with tightening of security in the late 1920s the official farewell station was relocated to the [[House of the Unions]]' \"Pillar Hall\" on [[Okhotny Ryad (street)|Okhotny Ryad]] (where Lenin lay in state in 1924) and remained there until the end of the Soviet state.<ref name=KV/> Burials initially took place to the north from the Senate tower, switching to the south side in 1934 and returning to the north side in 1977 (with a few exceptions). Interments in the wall were strictly individual; spouses and children of those interred in the wall had to be buried elsewhere. There were only three instances of group burials: the three-man crew of the [[Osoaviakhim-1]] [[high-altitude balloon]] in 1934, the crew of a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15UTI]] crash in 1968 ([[Yuri Gagarin|Gagarin]] and [[Vladimir Seryogin|Seryogin]]), and the three-man crew of the [[Soyuz 11]] spacecraft in 1971.

When members of the Politburo were not available immediately, [[Mikhail Suslov]] had the first call. Brezhnev overruled Suslov's decision at least once, voting to bury [[Semyon Budenny]] in an individual grave.<ref name=KV/> There were also at least two known cases when groups of professionals pressed the government to extend special honors to their deceased colleagues:\n* In June 1962, following the death of [[Army General]] [[Andrey Khrulyov]], a group of [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|marshals]] pressed the Politburo to bury Khrulyov in the Kremlin wall. Normally, generals of his rank were not entitled to this honor; Khrushchev was known to dislike Khrulyov and suggested burying him at the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]]. The military prevailed, and Khrulyov was buried on Red Square.<ref name=KV/>\n* In January 1970 the official decision to bury [[Pavel Belyayev]] at the Novodevichy Cemetery, already made public through newspapers, was confronted by fellow cosmonauts [[Valentina Tereshkova]], [[Alexei Leonov]], and [[Vladimir Shatalov]] who insisted that Belyaev deserved a place in the Kremlin wall like [[Yuri Gagarin]]. According to [[Nikolai Kamanin]]'s diaries, the cosmonauts, Shatalov in particular, pressed the issue despite knowing that the decision was made by Brezhnev and [[Alexei Kosygin]] and that the funeral commission would not dare to challenge it.<ref>Kamanin, January 11, 1970</ref> Belyaev was buried as planned at the Novodevichy. According to an alternative version of events, the choice of Novodevichy was decided by his widow's will before the official decision was published.<ref>Burgess et al., p. 181</ref>\n\nOn 26 April 1967, Cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov was given a [[state funeral]] in Moscow, and his ashes were interred in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis at Red Square. Komarov was posthumously awarded the Order of Lenin, once more, and also the order of Hero of the Soviet Union.
