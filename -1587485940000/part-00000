Widely considered as the most important filmmaker of his generation, he pioneered the feature-length movie and many enduring cinematic techniques, such as the [[close-up]].\n\nHis film ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915) broke box-office records, but also attracted much controversy, as it depicted [[African Americans]] in a negative light and glorified the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916) was made as an answer to his critics. Several of Griffith's later films were also successful, including ''[[Broken Blossoms]]'' (1919), ''[[Way Down East]]'' (1920) and ''[[Orphans of the Storm]]'' (1921), but the high costs he incurred for production and promotion often led to commercial failure. He had made roughly 500 films by the time of his final feature, ''[[The Struggle (1931 film)|The Struggle]]'' (1931).\n\nTogether with [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Mary Pickford]] and [[Douglas Fairbanks]] he founded [[United Artists]], enabling them to control their own interests, rather than depending on commercial studios. Griffith was also a founder member of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:GriffithDW.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Griffith {{circa|1907}}]]\n\nGriffith was born on a farm in [[Oldham County, Kentucky]], the son of Jacob Wark \"Roaring Jake\" Griffith,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gildasattic.com/dwgriffith.html|title=D.W.

His father died when he was 10, and the family struggled with poverty.\n\nWhen Griffith was 14, his mother abandoned the farm and moved the family to Louisville, Kentucky; there she opened a boarding house, which failed shortly afterward. Griffith then left high school to help support the family, taking a job in a dry goods store and later in a bookstore. He began his creative career as an actor in touring companies. Meanwhile, he was learning how to become a playwright, but had little success\u2014only one of his plays was accepted for a performance.<ref name=\"DWPlay\">{{cite web|url=https://spartacus-educational.com/USAgriffith.htm|title=D.W.

Widely considered as the most important filmmaker of his generation, he pioneered the feature-length movie and many enduring cinematic techniques, such as the [[close-up]].\n\nHis film ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915) broke box-office records, but also attracted much controversy, as it depicted [[African Americans]] in a negative light and glorified the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916) was made as an answer to his critics. Several of Griffith's later films were also successful, including ''[[Broken Blossoms]]'' (1919), ''[[Way Down East]]'' (1920) and ''[[Orphans of the Storm]]'' (1921), but the high costs he incurred for production and promotion often led to commercial failure. He had made roughly 500 films by the time of his final feature, ''[[The Struggle (1931 film)|The Struggle]]'' (1931).\n\nTogether with [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Mary Pickford]] and [[Douglas Fairbanks]] he founded [[United Artists]], enabling them to control their own interests, rather than depending on commercial studios. Griffith was also a founder member of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:GriffithDW.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Griffith {{circa|1907}}]]\n\nGriffith was born on a farm in [[Oldham County, Kentucky]], the son of Jacob Wark \"Roaring Jake\" Griffith,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gildasattic.com/dwgriffith.html|title=D.W.

His father died when he was 10, and the family struggled with poverty.\n\nWhen Griffith was 14, his mother abandoned the farm and moved the family to Louisville, Kentucky; there she opened a boarding house, which failed shortly afterward. Griffith then left high school to help support the family, taking a job in a dry goods store and later in a bookstore. He began his creative career as an actor in touring companies. Meanwhile, he was learning how to become a playwright, but had little success\u2014only one of his plays was accepted for a performance.<ref name=\"DWPlay\">{{cite web|url=https://spartacus-educational.com/USAgriffith.htm|title=D.W.

While some of his later films did well at the box office, commercial success often eluded him. Griffith features from this period include ''Broken Blossoms'' (1919), ''[[Way Down East]]'' (1920), ''Orphans of the Storm'' (1921), ''[[Dream Street (film)|Dream Street]]'' (1921), ''[[One Exciting Night]]'' (1922) and ''[[America (1924 film)|America]]'' (1924).

Neither was successful, and after ''The Struggle'' he never made another film.\n\nIn 1936, director [[Woody Van Dyke]], who had worked as Griffith's apprentice on ''Intolerance'', asked Griffith to help him shoot the famous earthquake sequence for ''[[San Francisco (1936 film)|San Francisco]]'', but did not give him any film credit. Starring [[Clark Gable]], [[Jeanette MacDonald]] and [[Spencer Tracy]], it was the top-grossing film of the year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biggest Box Office Hits of 1936|url=http://www.ultimatemovierankings.com/biggest-box-office-hits-of-1936/|website=Ultimate movie rankings|accessdate=14 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1939, the producer [[Hal Roach]] hired Griffith to produce ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]'' (1939) and ''[[One Million B.C.]]'' (1940).

This would make the film the final production in which Griffith was actively involved. However, cast members' accounts recall Griffith directing only the [[screen test]]s and costume tests. When Roach advertised the film in late 1939 with Griffith listed as producer, the latter asked that his name be removed.<ref>Ward, p. 110.</ref>\n\nAlthough mostly forgotten by movie-goers of the time Griffith was held in awe by many in the film industry. In the mid-1930s he was given a special Oscar by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In 1946 he made an impromptu visit to the film location of [[David O. Selznick]]'s epic western ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'', where some of his veteran actors, Lillian Gish, [[Lionel Barrymore]] and [[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]], were cast members. Gish and Barrymore found their old mentor's presence distracting and became self-conscious.

Her career as an artist began when she was a [[teenager]]. She specifically sought out enrollment at [[Washington Irving High School (New York City)|Washington Irving High School]] for Girls as they offered an art [[major]].<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 13\"/> After graduating, she attended the Women's Art School of [[Cooper Union]] on a scholarship.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara pg. 14\">Rose. 1983. pg. 14</ref> There, she completed the [[course work]] required for a [[teaching certificate]] in art.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 13\"/> Krasner pursued yet more art education at the [[National Academy of Design]] in 1928, completing her course load there in 1932.\n\nBy attending a technical art school, Krasner was able to gain an extensive and thorough artistic education as illustrated through her knowledge of the techniques of the [[Old Masters]].<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 15\">Rose. 1983. pg. 15</ref> She also became highly skilled in portraying anatomically correct figures.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 16\">Rose. 1983. pg. 16</ref> There are relatively few works that survive from this time period apart from a few [[self-portrait]]s and [[still life]]s since most of the works were burned in a fire. One image that still exists from this period is her \"Self Portrait\" painted in 1930, now at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. She submitted it to the National Academy in order to enroll in a certain class, but the judges could not believe that the young artist produced a self-portrait [[en plein air]].<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 15\"/> In it, Krasner depicts herself with a defiant expression surrounded by nature.

She was very affected by [[post-impressionism]] and grew critical of the academic notions of style she had learned at the National Academy. In the 1930s, she began studying [[modern art]] through learning the components of [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]], technique, and theory.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 16\"/> She began taking classes from [[Hans Hofmann]] in 1937, which modernized her approach to the nude and [[still life]].<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 18\"/> He emphasized the two-dimensional nature of the [[picture plane]] and usage of color to create spatial illusion that was not representative of reality through his lessons.<ref>Rose. 1983, pg. 22</ref> Throughout her classes with Hofmann, Krasner worked in an advanced style of [[cubism]], also known as neo-cubism. During the class, a human [[nude]] or a still life setting would be the model from which Krasner and other students would have to work. She typically created charcoal drawings of the human models and oil on paper color studies of the still life settings.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 26\">Rose, 1983. pg. 26</ref> She typically illustrated female nudes in a cubist manner with tension achieved through the fragmentation of forms and the opposition of light and dark colors.

He said, 'This is so good, you would never know it was done by a woman\". She also received praise from  [[Piet Mondrian]] who once told her \"You have a very strong inner rhythm; you must never lose it.\"\n\n==Early career==\nKrasner supported herself as a waitress during her studies but it eventually became too difficult due to the [[Great Depression]].<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 33\">Rose, 1983. pg. 33</ref> In order to continue provide for herself, she joined the [[Works Progress Administration]]'s [[Federal Art Project]] in 1935, working in the mural division as an assistant to Max Spivak.<ref name=\"Rose. 1981. pg. 5\">Rose, Barbara. \"Krasner|Pollock: A Working Relationship\". New York: Grey Art Gallery and Study Center, 1981. pg. 5</ref> Her job was to enlarge other artists' designs for large-scaled public [[mural]]s. As murals were created to be easily understood and appreciated by the general public, however, the abstract art Krasner produced was undesirable. While happy to be employed, she was dissatisfied since she did not like working with [[figurative art|figurative]] images created by other artists.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 33\"/> Throughout the late 1930s and early 1940s, she created [[gouache]] sketches in the hopes of one day creating an [[abstract art|abstract]] mural.<ref>Rose, 1983. pg. 34</ref> As soon as one of her proposals for a mural was approved for the [[WNYC]] radio station, the Works Progress Administration turned into [[Works Progress Administration#Termination|War Services]] and all art had to be created for [[war propaganda]].<ref name=\"Rose. 1981. pg. 5\"/> Krasner continued working for War Services by creating collages for the war effort which were displayed in the windows of nineteen department stores in [[Brooklyn]] and [[Manhattan]].<ref>Rose, 1983. pg. 45</ref><ref name=\"Hobbs, Robert 1993. pg. 32\">Hobbs, 1993. pg. 32</ref> She was intensively involved with the [[Artists Union]] during her employment with the WPA but was one of the first to quit when she realized the communists were taking it over.<ref name=\"Rose. 1981. pg. 5\"/> However, by being part of this organization, she was able to meet more artists in the city and enlarge her network.<ref>Kleeblatt, Norman L., and Stephen Brown. ''From the Margins: Lee Krasner|Norman Lewis, 1945 - 1952''. New York: Jewish Museum, 2014. pg. 15</ref>\n\nAfter she quit, she joined in 1940 the [[American Abstract Artists]]. While a member, she typically exhibited cubist still life in a black-gridded [[cloisonne]] style which were highly [[impasto]]ed and [[Action painting|gestural]].<ref>Rose, 1983. pg. 40</ref> She met future abstract expressionists [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Clyfford Still]], and [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]] through this organization.<ref>Tucker, Marcia. \"Lee Krasner: Large Paintings\". New York: Whitney Museum of American Art, 1973.</ref> She lost interest in their usage of [[hard-edge]] geometric style after her relationship with [[Jackson Pollock]] began.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1981. pg. 5\"/>\n\n==Career==\nKrasner is identified as an [[abstract expressionist]] due to her abstract, gestural, and expressive works in painting, collage painting, charcoal drawing, and occasionally mosaics. She would often cut apart her own drawings and paintings to create her collage paintings. She also commonly revised or completely destroyed an entire series of works due to her critical nature; as a result, her surviving body of work is relatively small. Her [[catalogue raisonn\u00e9]], published in 1995 by [[Abrams Books|Abrams]], lists 599 known pieces.\n\nHer changeable nature is reflected throughout her work, which has led critics and scholars to have different conclusions about her and her oeuvre.<ref name=\"Hobbs, Robert 1993. pg. 7\">Hobbs. 1993. pg. 7</ref> Krasner's style often alternates between classic structure and [[baroque]] action, open form and hard-edge shape, and bright color and [[monochrome]] palette. Throughout her career, she refused to adopt a singular, recognizable style and instead embraced change through varying the mood, subject matter, texture, materials, and compositions of her work often.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara pg. 14\" /><ref>Hobbs. 1993. pg. 95</ref> By changing her work style often, she differed from other abstract expressionists since many of them adopted unchanging identities and modes of depiction.<ref>Hobbs, Robert. \"Lee Krasner's Skepticism and Her Emergent Postmodernism\", Woman's Art Journal, Vol. 28, No.2, (Fall-Winter 2008): 3 \u2013 10. JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 3</ref> Despite these intense variations, her works can typically be recognized through their gestural style, texture, rhythm, and depiction of organic imagery.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara pg. 14\" /> Krasner's interest in the self, nature, and modern life are themes which commonly surface in her works.<ref name=\"Hobbs, Robert 1993. pg. 7\"/> She was often reluctant to discuss the [[iconography]] of her work and instead emphasized the importance of her [[biography]] since she claimed her art was formed through her individual personality and her emotional state.<ref>Tucker. 1973. pg. 12</ref>\n\n=== Early 1940s ===\nThroughout the first half of the 1940s, Krasner struggled with creating art that satisfied her critical nature. She was highly affected by seeing Pollock's work for the first time in 1942, causing her to reject Hofmann's cubist style which required working from a human or still life model. She called the work produced during this frustrating time her \"grey slab paintings.\" She would create these paintings by working on a canvas for months, overpainting, scraping or rubbing paint off, and adding more pigment until the canvas was nearly monochrome from so much paint buildup. She eventually would destroy these works, which is the reason there is only one painting that exists from this time period.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1981. pg. 5\">Rose. 1983. pg. 50</ref> Krasner's extensive knowledge of [[cubism]] was the source of her creative problem since she needed her work to be more expressive and gestural to be considered contemporary and relevant.<ref>Rose, 1981. pg. 6</ref> In the fall of 1945, Krasner destroyed many of her cubist works she created during her studies with Hofmann, although the majority of paintings created from 1938 to 1943 survived this reevaluation.<ref>Rose. 1981. pg. 4</ref>\n\n===''Little Images:'' 1946\u20131949===\n\nBeginning in 1946, Krasner began working on her ''Little Image'' series. Commonly categorized as mosaic, webbed, or [[hieroglyph]]s depending on the style of the image,<ref name=\"Hobbs, Robert 1993. pg.40\">Hobbs. 1993. pg.40</ref> these types of paintings, totalling around 40, she created until 1949.<ref>Kleeblatt and Brown. 2014. pg. 68</ref> The mosaic images were created through the thick buildup of paint while her webbed paintings were made through a drip technique in which the paintbrush was always close to the surface of the canvas.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 59\">Rose. 1983. pg. 59</ref> Since Krasner used a drip technique, many critics believed upon seeing this work for the first time that she was reinterpreting Pollock's chaotic paint splatters.<ref>Cheim, John. \"Lee Krasner: Paintings from 1965 to 1970\".

She tried out and rejected many new styles and eventually destroyed most of the work she made in the early 1950s.<ref>Rose. 1983. pg. 62</ref> There is evidence that she began experimenting with automatic painting and created black-and-white, hybridized, monstrous figures on large canvases in 1950.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 68\">Rose. 1983. pg. 68</ref> These were the paintings that [[Betty Parsons]] saw when she visited The Springs that summer, causing the gallerist to offer Krasner a show in the fall.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 68\"/> Between the summer and the fall, Krasner again had shifted her style to [[color field painting]] and destroyed the figurative automatic paintings she made. The Betty Parsons show was Krasner's first solo exhibition since 1945.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 70\">Rose. 1983. pg. 70</ref> After the exhibition, Krasner used the color field paintings to make her collage paintings.\n\n===Early collage images: 1951\u20131955===\n\nBy 1951, Krasner had started her first series of collage paintings. To create these them, Krasner pasted cut-and-torn shapes onto all but two of the large-scale color field paintings she created for the Betty Parsons exhibition in 1951.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 75\">Rose. 1983. pg. 75</ref> This period marks the time when the artist stopped working on an easel since she created these works by lying the support on the floor.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 82\">Rose. 1983. pg. 82</ref> To make these images, she would pin the separate pieces to a canvas and modify the composition until she was satisfied. She then would paste the fragments on the canvas and add color with a brush when desired.<ref>Rose. 1983. pg. 83</ref> Most of the collage paintings she created recall plant or organic forms but do not completely resemble a living organism.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 93\">Rose. 1983. pg. 93</ref> By using many different materials, she was able to create texture and prevent the image from being entirely flat.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 75\"/> The act of tearing and cutting elements for the collage embodies Krasner's expression since these acts are aggressive.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 79\">Rose. 1983. pg. 79</ref> She explored contrasts of light and dark colors, hard and soft lines, organic and geometric shapes, and structure and improvisation through this work.<ref>Haxall, Daniel. \"Collage and the Nature of Order: Lee Krasner's Pastoral Vision\", ''Woman's Art Journal,'' Vol. 28, No. 2 (Fall-Winter 2008): 20-27. JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 21</ref> These collage paintings represent Krasner's turn away from [[Nonobjective art|nonobjective]] abstraction. From this period onwards, she created metaphorical and content-laden art which alludes to organic figures or landscapes.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 82\"/>\n\nFrom 1951 to 1953, most of her works were made from ripped drawings completed in black ink or wash in a figurative manner. By ripping the paper instead of cutting it, the edges of the figures are much more soft in comparison to the geometric and hard-edged shapes in her previous works.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 79\"/> From 1953 to 1954, she created smaller-sized collage paintings that were composed of fragments of undesired works.<ref>Rose, 1983. pg. 80</ref> Some of the discarded works she used were splatter paintings completed by Pollock. Many scholars have expressed different interpretations about why she used her partner's unwanted canvases. Some assert that she simultaneously demonstrated her admiration for his art while also recontextualizing his aggressive physicality through manipulating his images into a collage form.<ref name=\"Hobbs, Robert 1993. pg. 7\"/><ref>Landau, Ellen G. \"Channeling Desire: Lee Krasner's Collages of the Early 1950s\", ''Woman's Art Journal,'' Vol. 18, No. 2 (Autumn, 1997 \u2013 Winter, 1998): 27 \u2013 30. JSTOR.

JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 22</ref> By 1955, she made collage paintings on a larger scale and varied the material she used for the support, using either [[masonite]], wood, or canvas.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 82\"/> These works were first exhibited by Eleanor Ward at the [[Stable Gallery]] in 1955 in New York City, but they received little public acclaim apart from a good review from [[Clement Greenberg]].<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 93\"/><ref>Haxall, Fall-Winter 2008: 20-27. JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 20</ref>\n\n===''Earth Green Series:'' 1956\u20131959===\n\nDuring the summer of 1956, Krasner started her ''Earth Green Series.'' While she started making this work before Pollock's death, they are considered to reflect her feelings of anger, guilt, pain, and loss she experienced about their relationship before and after he died.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 100\">Rose, 1983. pg. 100</ref> The intense emotion she felt during this time caused her art to develop along more liberated lines of her self-expression and pushed the boundaries of conventional, developed concepts of art.<ref>Rose, 1983. pg. 97</ref> Through these large-scale action paintings, Krasner depicts hybridized figures that are made up of organic plant-like forms and anatomical parts, which often allude to both male and female body parts.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 100\"/> These forms dominate the canvas, causing it to be crowded and densely-packed with bursting and bulging shapes. The pain she experienced during this period is illustrated through the principal usage of [[flesh tone]]s with blood-red accents in the figures which suggest wounds. The paint drips on her canvas show her speed and willingness to relinquish absolute control, both necessary for portraying her emotions.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 104\">Rose, 1983. pg. 104</ref>\n\nBy 1957, Krasner continued to create figurative abstract forms in her work, but they suggest more floral elements rather than anatomical. She used brighter colors which were more vibrant and commonly contrasted other colors in the composition. She also would dilute paint or use a dry brush to make the colors more transparent.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 108\">Rose. 1983. pg. 108</ref>\n\nIn 1958, Krasner was [[Commission (art)|commissioned]] to create two abstract murals for an office building on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. She created two collage [[maquettes]] which depicted floral motifs for two entryways of the building. These murals were later destroyed in a fire.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 117\">Rose, 1983. pg. 117</ref>\n\n===''Umber Series:'' 1959\u20131961===\n\nKrasner's ''Umber Series'' paintings were created during a time when the artist was suffering from [[insomnia]]. Since she was working during the night, she had to paint with [[artificial light]] rather than [[daylight]], causing her palette to shift from bright, vibrant hues to dull, monochrome colors.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 126\">Rose. 1983. pg. 126</ref> She also was still dealing with the death of Pollock and the recent death of her mother, which led her to use an aggressive style when creating these images.<ref>Hobbs. 1993. pg. 73</ref> These mural-sized [[action painting]]s contrast dark and light severely since white, grays, black, and brown are the predominant colors used.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 122\">Rose. 1983. pg. 122</ref> Evidence of her animated brushwork can be seen through the drips and splatters of paint on the canvas. There is no central spot for the viewer to focus on in these works, making the composition highly dynamic and rhythmic.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 122\"/> To paint on such a large scale, Krasner would tack the canvas to a wall.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 126\"/> These images no longer implied organic forms but instead are often interpreted as violent and turbulent landscapes.<ref>Rose. 1983. pg. 125</ref>\n\n===''Primary Series:'' 1960s===\n\nBy 1962, she begins using bright colors and allude to floral and plant-like shapes.<ref>Cheim, John. \"Lee Krasner: Paintings from 1965 to 1970\". New York: Robert Miller, 1991. pg. 21</ref> These works are compositionally similar to her monochrome images due to their large size and rhythmic nature with no central focal point.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 130\">Rose. 1983. pg. 130</ref> Their palettes often contrast with one another and allude to tropical landscapes or plants.<ref>Strassfield, Christina Mossaides. \"Lee Krasner: The Nature of the Body-- Works from 1933 to 1984\". East Hampton: Guild Hall Museum, 1995. pg. 12</ref> She continued working in this style until she suffered an [[aneurysm]], fell, and broke her right wrist in 1963.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 130\"/><ref>Hobbs. 1993. pg. 75</ref> Since she still wanted to work, she began painting with her left hand. To overcome working with her non-dominant hand, she often would directly apply paint from a tube to the canvas rather than using a brush, causing there to be large patches of white canvas on the surfaces of the images. The gesture and the physicality of these works is more restrained.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 130\"/>\n\nAfter recovering from her broken arm, Krasner began working on bright and decorative allover painting which are less aggressive than her ''Earth Green'' and Umber Series paintings. Often, these images recall [[calligraphy]] or floral ornamentation not blatantly related to Krasner's known emotional state.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 132\">Rose. 1983. pg. 132</ref>  Floral or calligraphic shapes dominate the canvas, connecting variable brushwork into a single pattern.<ref>Rose. 1983. pg. 134</ref>\n\nBy the second half of the 1960s, critics began reassessing Krasner's role in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] as a painter and critic who greatly influenced Pollock and Greenberg.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 10\">Rose. 1983. pg. 10</ref><ref>Tucker. 1973. pg. 7</ref><ref name=\"Cheim, 1991. pg. 9\">Cheim. 1991. pg. 9</ref> Prior to this, her status as an artist was typically overlooked by critics and scholars due to her relationship with Pollock.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 10\"/> Since he served as such a large figure in the abstract expressionist movement, it is still often difficult for scholars to discuss her work without mentioning Pollock in some capacity.<ref>Cheim. 1991. pg. 2</ref> This reevaluation is reflected in her first retrospective exhibition of her paintings which was held in London at the [[Whitechapel Gallery]] in 1965. This exhibition was more well-received by critics in comparison to her previous shows in New York.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 10\"/><ref name=\"Cheim, 1991. pg. 9\"/>\n\nIn 1969, Krasner mostly concentrated on creating works on paper with [[gouache]]. These works were named either ''Earth, Water, Seed,'' or ''Hieroglyphics'' and often looked similar to a [[Rorschach test]]. Some scholars claim that these images were a critique of Greenberg's theory about the importance of the two-dimensional nature of the canvas.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 139\">Rose. 1983. pg. 139</ref>\n\n===Late career===\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, the painter's work was significantly influenced by [[postmodern art]] and emphasized the inherent problems of art as a form of communication.<ref>Hobbs, 1993. pg. 11</ref>\n\nStarting in 1970, Krasner began making large horizontal paintings made up of hard-edge lines and a palette of a few bright colors that contrasted one another.<ref>Rose, 1983. pg. 150</ref> She painted in this style until about 1973. Three years later, she started working on her second series of collage images. She began working on these after cleaning out her studio and discovered some charcoal drawings mostly of figure studies that she completed from 1937 to 1940. After saving a few, Krasner decided to use the rest in a new series of collages. In this work, the black and gray shapes of the figure studies are juxtaposed against the blank canvas or the addition of brightly colored paint.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 139\"/> The hard-edged shapes of the cut drawings are reconstructed into [[curvilinear]] shapes that recall floral patterns. Texture is induced through the contrast of the smooth paper and rough canvas.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 153\">Rose, 1983. pg. 153</ref> Since the figure studies are cut up and rearranged without consideration of their original intention or message, the differences between the old drawings and new structures are highly exaggerated.<ref>Hobbs, Robert. \"Lee Krasner's Skepticism and Her Emergent Postmodernism\", ''Woman's Art Journal,'' Vol. 28, No.2, (Fall-Winter 2008): 3 \u2013 10.

Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 8</ref> All of the collages' titles from this series are different [[verb tense]]s interpreted as a critique of Greenberg's and [[Michael Fried]]'s insistence on the presentness of modern art.<ref>Hobbs, Fall-Winter 2008: 3 \u2013 10. JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 7</ref> This series was very well received by a large audience when they were exhibited in 1977 at the [[Pace Gallery]]. It is also considered a statement about how artists need to reexamine and rework their style in order to stay relevant as they grow older.<ref name=\"Hobbs, Robert 1993. pg. 88\">Hobbs, 1993. pg. 88</ref>\n\n===Krasner and Pollock's mutual influence on one another===\nAlthough many people believe that Krasner stopped working in the 1940s in order to nurture Pollock's home life and career, she never in fact stopped creating art.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara pg. 14\"/> While their relationship developed, she shifted her focus from her own to Pollock's art in order to help him gain more recognition due to the fact that she believed that he had \"much more to give with his art than she had with hers\".<ref>Engelmann, Ines Janet. \"Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner\". Prestel, 2007. pg. 8</ref>\n\nThroughout her career, Krasner went through periods of struggle where she would experiment with new styles that would satisfy her means for expression and harshly critique, revise, or destroy the work she would produce. Because of this self-criticism, there are periods of time where little to none of her work exists, specifically the late 1940s and early 1950s.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara pg. 14\"/>\n\nKrasner and Pollock both had an immense effect on each other's artistic styles and careers. Since Krasner had learned from Hans Hofmann while Pollock received training from [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], each took different approaches to their work. Krasner learned from Hofmann the importance of the abstracting from nature and emphasizing the flat nature of the canvas while Pollock's training highlighted the importance of complex design from automatic drawing. Krasner's extensive knowledge of modern art helped Pollock since she brought him up to date with what contemporary art should be. He was therefore able to make works that were more organized and cosmopolitan. Additionally, Krasner was responsible for introducing Pollock to many artists, collectors, and critics who appreciated abstract art such as [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Peggy Guggenheim]], and [[Clement Greenberg]]. Pollock helped Krasner become less restrained when making her work. He inspired her to stop painting from human and still life models in order to free her interior emotions and become more spontaneous and gestural through her work.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1981. pg. 6\">Rose, 1981. pg. 6.</ref>\n\nKrasner struggled with the public's reception of her identity, both as a woman and as Pollock's wife. When they both exhibited in a show called \"Artists: Man and Wife\" in 1949, an ''[[ARTnews]]'' reviewer stated: \"There is a tendency among some of these wives to 'tidy up' their husband's styles. Lee Krasner (Mrs. Jackson Pollock) takes her husband's paint and enamels and changes his unrestrained, sweeping lines into neat little squares and triangles.\"<ref>Wagner, Winter 1989: 42 \u2013 57. JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 44</ref> Even after the rise of [[feminism]] in the 1960s and 1970s, Krasner's artistic career was always put into relation to Pollock since remarks made about her work often commented on how she had become a successful artist by moving out of Pollock's shadow.<ref>Wagner, Winter 1989: 42 \u2013 57. JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 45</ref> In articles about her work, Pollock is continually referred to. Krasner is still sometimes referred to as \"Action Widow\", a term coined in 1972 by art critic [[B. H. Friedman]] who accused the female surviving partners of Abstract Expressionist artists of artistic dependence on their male partners.<ref>{{Cite book|title=50 women artists you should know|last=Christiane.|first=Weidemann|date=2008|publisher=Prestel|others=Larass, Petra., Klier, Melanie, 1970-|isbn=9783791339566|location=Munich|oclc=195744889|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/50womenartistsyo0000weid}}</ref> Typically in the 1940s and 1950s, Krasner also would not sign works at all, sign with the genderless initials \"L.K.\", or blend her signature into the painting in order to not emphasize her status as a woman and as a wife to another painter.<ref>Wagner, Winter 1989: 42 \u2013 57.

She had been suffering from [[arthritis]].\n\nSix months after her death, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] ([[MoMA]]) in [[New York City]] held a [[retrospective]] exhibition of her work. A review in the ''[[New York Times]]'' noted that it \"clearly defines Krasner's place in the New York School\" and that she \"is a major, independent artist of the pioneer Abstract Expressionist generation, whose stirring work ranks high among that produced here in the last half-century.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/21/arts/art-lee-krasner-finds-her-place-in-retrospective-ar-modern.html|title=Art: Lee Krasner Finds Her Place in Retrospective Ar Modern|first=Grace|last=Glueck|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 21, 1984}}</ref> As of 2008, Krasner is one of only four women artists to have had a retrospective show at this institution.

She is also one of the few female artists to have had a retrospective show at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].\n\nAs a result of misogyny in the art world and her much smaller artistic output, Krasner's talent was overshadowed by her relationship with [[Jackson Pollock]] for many years. Although there was cross-pollination between their styles, Krasner\u2019s training, influenced by [[George Bridgman]] and [[Hans Hofmann]], was the more formalized, especially in the depiction of [[human anatomy]], and this enriched Pollock\u2019s more intuitive and unstructured output.\n\n\n==Early life==\nKrasner was born as ''' Lena Krassner''' (outside the family she was known as '''Lenore Krasner''') on October 27, 1908 in [[Brooklyn, New York]].<ref>Brenson, Michael.

Her career as an artist began when she was a [[teenager]]. She specifically sought out enrollment at [[Washington Irving High School (New York City)|Washington Irving High School]] for Girls as they offered an art [[major]].<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 13\"/> After graduating, she attended the Women's Art School of [[Cooper Union]] on a scholarship.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara pg. 14\">Rose. 1983. pg. 14</ref> There, she completed the [[course work]] required for a [[teaching certificate]] in art.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 13\"/> Krasner pursued yet more art education at the [[National Academy of Design]] in 1928, completing her course load there in 1932.\n\nBy attending a technical art school, Krasner was able to gain an extensive and thorough artistic education as illustrated through her knowledge of the techniques of the [[Old Masters]].<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 15\">Rose. 1983. pg. 15</ref> She also became highly skilled in portraying anatomically correct figures.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 16\">Rose. 1983. pg. 16</ref> There are relatively few works that survive from this time period apart from a few [[self-portrait]]s and [[still life]]s since most of the works were burned in a fire. One image that still exists from this period is her \"Self Portrait\" painted in 1930, now at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. She submitted it to the National Academy in order to enroll in a certain class, but the judges could not believe that the young artist produced a self-portrait [[en plein air]].<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 15\"/> In it, Krasner depicts herself with a defiant expression surrounded by nature.

She was very affected by [[post-impressionism]] and grew critical of the academic notions of style she had learned at the National Academy. In the 1930s, she began studying [[modern art]] through learning the components of [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]], technique, and theory.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 16\"/> She began taking classes from [[Hans Hofmann]] in 1937, which modernized her approach to the nude and [[still life]].<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 18\"/> He emphasized the two-dimensional nature of the [[picture plane]] and usage of color to create spatial illusion that was not representative of reality through his lessons.<ref>Rose. 1983, pg. 22</ref> Throughout her classes with Hofmann, Krasner worked in an advanced style of [[cubism]], also known as neo-cubism. During the class, a human [[nude]] or a still life setting would be the model from which Krasner and other students would have to work. She typically created charcoal drawings of the human models and oil on paper color studies of the still life settings.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 26\">Rose, 1983. pg. 26</ref> She typically illustrated female nudes in a cubist manner with tension achieved through the fragmentation of forms and the opposition of light and dark colors. The still lifes illustrated her interest in [[fauvism]] since she suspended brightly colored [[pigment]] on white backgrounds.<ref name=\"Hobbs, Robert 1993. pg. 24\">Hobbs, Robert. ''Lee Krasner''. New York: Abbeville Press, 1993. pg. 24</ref>\n\nHans Hofmann \"was very negative\" his former student said \"but one day he stood before my easel and he gave me the first praise I had ever received as an artist from him. He said, 'This is so good, you would never know it was done by a woman\". She also received praise from  [[Piet Mondrian]] who once told her \"You have a very strong inner rhythm; you must never lose it.\"\n\n==Early career==\nKrasner supported herself as a waitress during her studies but it eventually became too difficult due to the [[Great Depression]].<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 33\">Rose, 1983. pg. 33</ref> In order to continue provide for herself, she joined the [[Works Progress Administration]]'s [[Federal Art Project]] in 1935, working in the mural division as an assistant to Max Spivak.<ref name=\"Rose. 1981. pg. 5\">Rose, Barbara. \"Krasner|Pollock: A Working Relationship\". New York: Grey Art Gallery and Study Center, 1981. pg. 5</ref> Her job was to enlarge other artists' designs for large-scaled public [[mural]]s. As murals were created to be easily understood and appreciated by the general public, however, the abstract art Krasner produced was undesirable. While happy to be employed, she was dissatisfied since she did not like working with [[figurative art|figurative]] images created by other artists.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 33\"/> Throughout the late 1930s and early 1940s, she created [[gouache]] sketches in the hopes of one day creating an [[abstract art|abstract]] mural.<ref>Rose, 1983. pg. 34</ref> As soon as one of her proposals for a mural was approved for the [[WNYC]] radio station, the Works Progress Administration turned into [[Works Progress Administration#Termination|War Services]] and all art had to be created for [[war propaganda]].<ref name=\"Rose. 1981. pg. 5\"/> Krasner continued working for War Services by creating collages for the war effort which were displayed in the windows of nineteen department stores in [[Brooklyn]] and [[Manhattan]].<ref>Rose, 1983. pg. 45</ref><ref name=\"Hobbs, Robert 1993. pg. 32\">Hobbs, 1993. pg. 32</ref> She was intensively involved with the [[Artists Union]] during her employment with the WPA but was one of the first to quit when she realized the communists were taking it over.<ref name=\"Rose. 1981. pg. 5\"/> However, by being part of this organization, she was able to meet more artists in the city and enlarge her network.<ref>Kleeblatt, Norman L., and Stephen Brown. ''From the Margins: Lee Krasner|Norman Lewis, 1945 - 1952''. New York: Jewish Museum, 2014. pg. 15</ref>\n\nAfter she quit, she joined in 1940 the [[American Abstract Artists]]. While a member, she typically exhibited cubist still life in a black-gridded [[cloisonne]] style which were highly [[impasto]]ed and [[Action painting|gestural]].<ref>Rose, 1983. pg. 40</ref> She met future abstract expressionists [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Clyfford Still]], and [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]] through this organization.<ref>Tucker, Marcia. \"Lee Krasner: Large Paintings\". New York: Whitney Museum of American Art, 1973.</ref> She lost interest in their usage of [[hard-edge]] geometric style after her relationship with [[Jackson Pollock]] began.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1981. pg. 5\"/>\n\n==Career==\nKrasner is identified as an [[abstract expressionist]] due to her abstract, gestural, and expressive works in painting, collage painting, charcoal drawing, and occasionally mosaics. She would often cut apart her own drawings and paintings to create her collage paintings. She also commonly revised or completely destroyed an entire series of works due to her critical nature; as a result, her surviving body of work is relatively small. Her [[catalogue raisonn\u00e9]], published in 1995 by [[Abrams Books|Abrams]], lists 599 known pieces.\n\nHer changeable nature is reflected throughout her work, which has led critics and scholars to have different conclusions about her and her oeuvre.<ref name=\"Hobbs, Robert 1993. pg. 7\">Hobbs. 1993. pg. 7</ref> Krasner's style often alternates between classic structure and [[baroque]] action, open form and hard-edge shape, and bright color and [[monochrome]] palette. Throughout her career, she refused to adopt a singular, recognizable style and instead embraced change through varying the mood, subject matter, texture, materials, and compositions of her work often.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara pg. 14\" /><ref>Hobbs. 1993. pg. 95</ref> By changing her work style often, she differed from other abstract expressionists since many of them adopted unchanging identities and modes of depiction.<ref>Hobbs, Robert. \"Lee Krasner's Skepticism and Her Emergent Postmodernism\", Woman's Art Journal, Vol. 28, No.2, (Fall-Winter 2008): 3 \u2013 10. JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 3</ref> Despite these intense variations, her works can typically be recognized through their gestural style, texture, rhythm, and depiction of organic imagery.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara pg. 14\" /> Krasner's interest in the self, nature, and modern life are themes which commonly surface in her works.<ref name=\"Hobbs, Robert 1993. pg. 7\"/> She was often reluctant to discuss the [[iconography]] of her work and instead emphasized the importance of her [[biography]] since she claimed her art was formed through her individual personality and her emotional state.<ref>Tucker. 1973. pg. 12</ref>\n\n=== Early 1940s ===\nThroughout the first half of the 1940s, Krasner struggled with creating art that satisfied her critical nature. She was highly affected by seeing Pollock's work for the first time in 1942, causing her to reject Hofmann's cubist style which required working from a human or still life model. She called the work produced during this frustrating time her \"grey slab paintings.\" She would create these paintings by working on a canvas for months, overpainting, scraping or rubbing paint off, and adding more pigment until the canvas was nearly monochrome from so much paint buildup. She eventually would destroy these works, which is the reason there is only one painting that exists from this time period.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1981. pg. 5\">Rose. 1983. pg. 50</ref> Krasner's extensive knowledge of [[cubism]] was the source of her creative problem since she needed her work to be more expressive and gestural to be considered contemporary and relevant.<ref>Rose, 1981. pg. 6</ref> In the fall of 1945, Krasner destroyed many of her cubist works she created during her studies with Hofmann, although the majority of paintings created from 1938 to 1943 survived this reevaluation.<ref>Rose. 1981. pg. 4</ref>\n\n===''Little Images:'' 1946\u20131949===\n\nBeginning in 1946, Krasner began working on her ''Little Image'' series. Commonly categorized as mosaic, webbed, or [[hieroglyph]]s depending on the style of the image,<ref name=\"Hobbs, Robert 1993. pg.40\">Hobbs. 1993. pg.40</ref> these types of paintings, totalling around 40, she created until 1949.<ref>Kleeblatt and Brown. 2014. pg. 68</ref> The mosaic images were created through the thick buildup of paint while her webbed paintings were made through a drip technique in which the paintbrush was always close to the surface of the canvas.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 59\">Rose. 1983. pg. 59</ref> Since Krasner used a drip technique, many critics believed upon seeing this work for the first time that she was reinterpreting Pollock's chaotic paint splatters.<ref>Cheim, John. \"Lee Krasner: Paintings from 1965 to 1970\".

She tried out and rejected many new styles and eventually destroyed most of the work she made in the early 1950s.<ref>Rose. 1983. pg. 62</ref> There is evidence that she began experimenting with automatic painting and created black-and-white, hybridized, monstrous figures on large canvases in 1950.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 68\">Rose. 1983. pg. 68</ref> These were the paintings that [[Betty Parsons]] saw when she visited The Springs that summer, causing the gallerist to offer Krasner a show in the fall.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 68\"/> Between the summer and the fall, Krasner again had shifted her style to [[color field painting]] and destroyed the figurative automatic paintings she made. The Betty Parsons show was Krasner's first solo exhibition since 1945.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 70\">Rose. 1983. pg. 70</ref> After the exhibition, Krasner used the color field paintings to make her collage paintings.\n\n===Early collage images: 1951\u20131955===\n\nBy 1951, Krasner had started her first series of collage paintings. To create these them, Krasner pasted cut-and-torn shapes onto all but two of the large-scale color field paintings she created for the Betty Parsons exhibition in 1951.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 75\">Rose. 1983. pg. 75</ref> This period marks the time when the artist stopped working on an easel since she created these works by lying the support on the floor.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 82\">Rose. 1983. pg. 82</ref> To make these images, she would pin the separate pieces to a canvas and modify the composition until she was satisfied. She then would paste the fragments on the canvas and add color with a brush when desired.<ref>Rose. 1983. pg. 83</ref> Most of the collage paintings she created recall plant or organic forms but do not completely resemble a living organism.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 93\">Rose. 1983. pg. 93</ref> By using many different materials, she was able to create texture and prevent the image from being entirely flat.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 75\"/> The act of tearing and cutting elements for the collage embodies Krasner's expression since these acts are aggressive.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 79\">Rose. 1983. pg. 79</ref> She explored contrasts of light and dark colors, hard and soft lines, organic and geometric shapes, and structure and improvisation through this work.<ref>Haxall, Daniel. \"Collage and the Nature of Order: Lee Krasner's Pastoral Vision\", ''Woman's Art Journal,'' Vol. 28, No. 2 (Fall-Winter 2008): 20-27. JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 21</ref> These collage paintings represent Krasner's turn away from [[Nonobjective art|nonobjective]] abstraction. From this period onwards, she created metaphorical and content-laden art which alludes to organic figures or landscapes.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 82\"/>\n\nFrom 1951 to 1953, most of her works were made from ripped drawings completed in black ink or wash in a figurative manner. By ripping the paper instead of cutting it, the edges of the figures are much more soft in comparison to the geometric and hard-edged shapes in her previous works.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 79\"/> From 1953 to 1954, she created smaller-sized collage paintings that were composed of fragments of undesired works.<ref>Rose, 1983. pg. 80</ref> Some of the discarded works she used were splatter paintings completed by Pollock. Many scholars have expressed different interpretations about why she used her partner's unwanted canvases. Some assert that she simultaneously demonstrated her admiration for his art while also recontextualizing his aggressive physicality through manipulating his images into a collage form.<ref name=\"Hobbs, Robert 1993. pg. 7\"/><ref>Landau, Ellen G. \"Channeling Desire: Lee Krasner's Collages of the Early 1950s\", ''Woman's Art Journal,'' Vol. 18, No. 2 (Autumn, 1997 \u2013 Winter, 1998): 27 \u2013 30. JSTOR.

JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 22</ref> By 1955, she made collage paintings on a larger scale and varied the material she used for the support, using either [[masonite]], wood, or canvas.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 82\"/> These works were first exhibited by Eleanor Ward at the [[Stable Gallery]] in 1955 in New York City, but they received little public acclaim apart from a good review from [[Clement Greenberg]].<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 93\"/><ref>Haxall, Fall-Winter 2008: 20-27. JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 20</ref>\n\n===''Earth Green Series:'' 1956\u20131959===\n\nDuring the summer of 1956, Krasner started her ''Earth Green Series.'' While she started making this work before Pollock's death, they are considered to reflect her feelings of anger, guilt, pain, and loss she experienced about their relationship before and after he died.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 100\">Rose, 1983. pg. 100</ref> The intense emotion she felt during this time caused her art to develop along more liberated lines of her self-expression and pushed the boundaries of conventional, developed concepts of art.<ref>Rose, 1983. pg. 97</ref> Through these large-scale action paintings, Krasner depicts hybridized figures that are made up of organic plant-like forms and anatomical parts, which often allude to both male and female body parts.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 100\"/> These forms dominate the canvas, causing it to be crowded and densely-packed with bursting and bulging shapes. The pain she experienced during this period is illustrated through the principal usage of [[flesh tone]]s with blood-red accents in the figures which suggest wounds. The paint drips on her canvas show her speed and willingness to relinquish absolute control, both necessary for portraying her emotions.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 104\">Rose, 1983. pg. 104</ref>\n\nBy 1957, Krasner continued to create figurative abstract forms in her work, but they suggest more floral elements rather than anatomical. She used brighter colors which were more vibrant and commonly contrasted other colors in the composition. She also would dilute paint or use a dry brush to make the colors more transparent.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 108\">Rose. 1983. pg. 108</ref>\n\nIn 1958, Krasner was [[Commission (art)|commissioned]] to create two abstract murals for an office building on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. She created two collage [[maquettes]] which depicted floral motifs for two entryways of the building. These murals were later destroyed in a fire.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 117\">Rose, 1983. pg. 117</ref>\n\n===''Umber Series:'' 1959\u20131961===\n\nKrasner's ''Umber Series'' paintings were created during a time when the artist was suffering from [[insomnia]]. Since she was working during the night, she had to paint with [[artificial light]] rather than [[daylight]], causing her palette to shift from bright, vibrant hues to dull, monochrome colors.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 126\">Rose. 1983. pg. 126</ref> She also was still dealing with the death of Pollock and the recent death of her mother, which led her to use an aggressive style when creating these images.<ref>Hobbs. 1993. pg. 73</ref> These mural-sized [[action painting]]s contrast dark and light severely since white, grays, black, and brown are the predominant colors used.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 122\">Rose. 1983. pg. 122</ref> Evidence of her animated brushwork can be seen through the drips and splatters of paint on the canvas. There is no central spot for the viewer to focus on in these works, making the composition highly dynamic and rhythmic.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 122\"/> To paint on such a large scale, Krasner would tack the canvas to a wall.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 126\"/> These images no longer implied organic forms but instead are often interpreted as violent and turbulent landscapes.<ref>Rose. 1983. pg. 125</ref>\n\n===''Primary Series:'' 1960s===\n\nBy 1962, she begins using bright colors and allude to floral and plant-like shapes.<ref>Cheim, John. \"Lee Krasner: Paintings from 1965 to 1970\". New York: Robert Miller, 1991. pg. 21</ref> These works are compositionally similar to her monochrome images due to their large size and rhythmic nature with no central focal point.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 130\">Rose. 1983. pg. 130</ref> Their palettes often contrast with one another and allude to tropical landscapes or plants.<ref>Strassfield, Christina Mossaides. \"Lee Krasner: The Nature of the Body-- Works from 1933 to 1984\". East Hampton: Guild Hall Museum, 1995. pg. 12</ref> She continued working in this style until she suffered an [[aneurysm]], fell, and broke her right wrist in 1963.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 130\"/><ref>Hobbs. 1993. pg. 75</ref> Since she still wanted to work, she began painting with her left hand. To overcome working with her non-dominant hand, she often would directly apply paint from a tube to the canvas rather than using a brush, causing there to be large patches of white canvas on the surfaces of the images. The gesture and the physicality of these works is more restrained.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 130\"/>\n\nAfter recovering from her broken arm, Krasner began working on bright and decorative allover painting which are less aggressive than her ''Earth Green'' and Umber Series paintings. Often, these images recall [[calligraphy]] or floral ornamentation not blatantly related to Krasner's known emotional state.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 132\">Rose. 1983. pg. 132</ref>  Floral or calligraphic shapes dominate the canvas, connecting variable brushwork into a single pattern.<ref>Rose. 1983. pg. 134</ref>\n\nBy the second half of the 1960s, critics began reassessing Krasner's role in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] as a painter and critic who greatly influenced Pollock and Greenberg.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 10\">Rose. 1983. pg. 10</ref><ref>Tucker. 1973. pg. 7</ref><ref name=\"Cheim, 1991. pg. 9\">Cheim. 1991. pg. 9</ref> Prior to this, her status as an artist was typically overlooked by critics and scholars due to her relationship with Pollock.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 10\"/> Since he served as such a large figure in the abstract expressionist movement, it is still often difficult for scholars to discuss her work without mentioning Pollock in some capacity.<ref>Cheim. 1991. pg. 2</ref> This reevaluation is reflected in her first retrospective exhibition of her paintings which was held in London at the [[Whitechapel Gallery]] in 1965. This exhibition was more well-received by critics in comparison to her previous shows in New York.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 10\"/><ref name=\"Cheim, 1991. pg. 9\"/>\n\nIn 1969, Krasner mostly concentrated on creating works on paper with [[gouache]]. These works were named either ''Earth, Water, Seed,'' or ''Hieroglyphics'' and often looked similar to a [[Rorschach test]]. Some scholars claim that these images were a critique of Greenberg's theory about the importance of the two-dimensional nature of the canvas.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 139\">Rose. 1983. pg. 139</ref>\n\n===Late career===\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, the painter's work was significantly influenced by [[postmodern art]] and emphasized the inherent problems of art as a form of communication.<ref>Hobbs, 1993. pg. 11</ref>\n\nStarting in 1970, Krasner began making large horizontal paintings made up of hard-edge lines and a palette of a few bright colors that contrasted one another.<ref>Rose, 1983. pg. 150</ref> She painted in this style until about 1973. Three years later, she started working on her second series of collage images. She began working on these after cleaning out her studio and discovered some charcoal drawings mostly of figure studies that she completed from 1937 to 1940. After saving a few, Krasner decided to use the rest in a new series of collages. In this work, the black and gray shapes of the figure studies are juxtaposed against the blank canvas or the addition of brightly colored paint.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 139\"/> The hard-edged shapes of the cut drawings are reconstructed into [[curvilinear]] shapes that recall floral patterns. Texture is induced through the contrast of the smooth paper and rough canvas.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1983. pg. 153\">Rose, 1983. pg. 153</ref> Since the figure studies are cut up and rearranged without consideration of their original intention or message, the differences between the old drawings and new structures are highly exaggerated.<ref>Hobbs, Robert. \"Lee Krasner's Skepticism and Her Emergent Postmodernism\", ''Woman's Art Journal,'' Vol. 28, No.2, (Fall-Winter 2008): 3 \u2013 10.

Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 8</ref> All of the collages' titles from this series are different [[verb tense]]s interpreted as a critique of Greenberg's and [[Michael Fried]]'s insistence on the presentness of modern art.<ref>Hobbs, Fall-Winter 2008: 3 \u2013 10. JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 7</ref> This series was very well received by a large audience when they were exhibited in 1977 at the [[Pace Gallery]]. It is also considered a statement about how artists need to reexamine and rework their style in order to stay relevant as they grow older.<ref name=\"Hobbs, Robert 1993. pg. 88\">Hobbs, 1993. pg. 88</ref>\n\n===Krasner and Pollock's mutual influence on one another===\nAlthough many people believe that Krasner stopped working in the 1940s in order to nurture Pollock's home life and career, she never in fact stopped creating art.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara pg. 14\"/> While their relationship developed, she shifted her focus from her own to Pollock's art in order to help him gain more recognition due to the fact that she believed that he had \"much more to give with his art than she had with hers\".<ref>Engelmann, Ines Janet. \"Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner\". Prestel, 2007. pg. 8</ref>\n\nThroughout her career, Krasner went through periods of struggle where she would experiment with new styles that would satisfy her means for expression and harshly critique, revise, or destroy the work she would produce. Because of this self-criticism, there are periods of time where little to none of her work exists, specifically the late 1940s and early 1950s.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara pg. 14\"/>\n\nKrasner and Pollock both had an immense effect on each other's artistic styles and careers. Since Krasner had learned from Hans Hofmann while Pollock received training from [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], each took different approaches to their work. Krasner learned from Hofmann the importance of the abstracting from nature and emphasizing the flat nature of the canvas while Pollock's training highlighted the importance of complex design from automatic drawing. Krasner's extensive knowledge of modern art helped Pollock since she brought him up to date with what contemporary art should be. He was therefore able to make works that were more organized and cosmopolitan. Additionally, Krasner was responsible for introducing Pollock to many artists, collectors, and critics who appreciated abstract art such as [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Peggy Guggenheim]], and [[Clement Greenberg]]. Pollock helped Krasner become less restrained when making her work. He inspired her to stop painting from human and still life models in order to free her interior emotions and become more spontaneous and gestural through her work.<ref name=\"Rose, Barbara 1981. pg. 6\">Rose, 1981. pg. 6.</ref>\n\nKrasner struggled with the public's reception of her identity, both as a woman and as Pollock's wife. When they both exhibited in a show called \"Artists: Man and Wife\" in 1949, an ''[[ARTnews]]'' reviewer stated: \"There is a tendency among some of these wives to 'tidy up' their husband's styles. Lee Krasner (Mrs. Jackson Pollock) takes her husband's paint and enamels and changes his unrestrained, sweeping lines into neat little squares and triangles.\"<ref>Wagner, Winter 1989: 42 \u2013 57. JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 44</ref> Even after the rise of [[feminism]] in the 1960s and 1970s, Krasner's artistic career was always put into relation to Pollock since remarks made about her work often commented on how she had become a successful artist by moving out of Pollock's shadow.<ref>Wagner, Winter 1989: 42 \u2013 57. JSTOR. Web. 17 March 2015. pg. 45</ref> In articles about her work, Pollock is continually referred to. Krasner is still sometimes referred to as \"Action Widow\", a term coined in 1972 by art critic [[B. H.

In [[John Updike]]'s novel ''Seek My Face'' (2002), a significant portion of the main character's life is based on Krasner's.\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Relationship with Jackson Pollock===\nKrasner and [[Jackson Pollock]] established a relationship in 1942 after they both exhibited at the McMillen Gallery. She was intrigued by his work and the fact she did not know who he was even though she knew many abstract painters in New York. She went to his apartment to meet him.<ref name=\"Hobbs, Robert 1993. pg. 32\"/><ref>Rose, 1983. pg. 48.</ref> By 1945, they moved to The Springs on the outskirts of [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]].

The surroundings of the projected image have to be relatively dark for the image to be clear, so many historical camera obscura experiments were performed in dark rooms.\n\nThe term \"camera obscura\" coryxkenshin also refers to constructions or devices that make use of the principle within a box, tent, or room. Camera Obscura with a lens in the opening have been used since the second half of the 16th century and became popular as an aid for drawing and painting. The camera obscura box was developed further into the [[Camera|photographic camera]] in the first half of the 19th century when camera obscura boxes were used to expose light-sensitive materials to the projected image.\n\nThe camera obscura was used as a means to study eclipses without the risk of damaging the eyes by looking into the sun directly. As a drawing aid, the camera obscura allowed tracing the projected image to produce a highly accurate representation, especially appreciated as an easy way to achieve a proper [[graphical perspective]].\n\nBefore the term \"camera obscura\" was first used in 1604, many others are attested: \"cubiculum obscurum\", \"cubiculum tenebricosum\", \"conclave obscurum\" and \"locus obscurus\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Optic projection, principles, installation, and use of the magic lantern, projection microscope, reflecting lantern, moving picture machine|publisher=Comstock Publishing Company|year=1914|last=Phelps Gage|first=Henry|url=https://archive.org/details/opticprojection01gagegoog|quote=obscurum cubiculum.}}</ref>\n\nA camera obscura device without a lens but with a very small hole is sometimes referred to as a \"[[pinhole camera]]\", although this more often refers to simple (home-made) lens-less cameras in which photographic film or photographic paper is used.\n\n==Physical explanation==\nRays of light travel in straight lines and change when they are reflected and partly absorbed by an object, retaining information about the color and brightness of the surface of that object. Lit objects reflect rays of light in all directions. A small enough opening in a screen only lets through rays that travel directly from different points in the scene on the other side, and these rays form an image of that scene when they are collected on a surface opposite from the opening.\n\nThe [[human eye]] (as well as those of other animals including pokemon birds, fish, reptiles etc.) works much like a camera obscura with an opening ([[pupil]]), a biconvex [[lens (anatomy)|lens]] and a surface where the image is formed ([[retina]]).\n\n==Technology==\n[[Image:Camera obscura box.jpg|left|thumb|A diagram of a camera obscura with an upright projected image at the top.]]\nA camera obscura device consists of a box, tent, or room with a small hole in one side. Light from an external scene passes through the hole and strikes a surface inside, where the scene is reproduced, inverted, (thus upside-down) and reversed (left to right), but with color and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] preserved.\n\nIn order to produce a reasonably clear projected image, the aperture has to be about 1/100th the distance to the screen, or less.\n\nAs the pinhole is made smaller, the image gets sharper, but the projected image becomes dimmer. With too small a pinhole, however, the sharpness worsens, due to [[diffraction]].\n\nIn practice, camera obscuras use a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] rather than a pinhole (as in a [[pinhole camera]]) because it allows a larger [[F-number|aperture]], giving a usable brightness while maintaining focus.\n\nIf the image is caught on a semi-transparent screen, it can be viewed from the back so that it is no longer reversed (but still upside-down).\n\nUsing mirrors it is possible to project a right-side-up image. The projection can also be diverted onto a horizontal surface (e.g., a table). The 18th-century overhead version in tents used mirrors inside a kind of periscope on the top of the tent .\n\nThe box-type camera obscura often has an angled mirror projecting an upright image onto [[tracing paper]] placed on the glass top. Although the image is viewed from the back, it is now reversed by the mirror.\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistory to 500 BCE: Possible inspiration for prehistoric art and possible use in religious ceremonies, gnomons===\nThere are theories that occurrences of camera obscura effects (through tiny holes in tents or in screens of animal hide) inspired [[paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s. Distortions in the shapes of animals in many paleolithic cave artworks might be inspired by distortions seen when the surface on which an image was projected was not straight or not in the right angle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paleo-camera.com/paleolithic/ |title=Paleolithic |publisher=paleo-camera |accessdate=2 May 2017}}</ref>\nIt is also suggested that camera obscura projections could have played a role in [[Neolithic]] structures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paleo-camera.com/neolithic/ |title=Neolithic |publisher=paleo-camera |accessdate=2 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jennifer Ouellette |url=https://gizmodo.com/did-prehistoric-people-watch-the-stars-through-this-6-0-1782759791 |title=deadspin-quote-carrot-aligned-w-bgr-2 |website=Gizmodo |date=29 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Osservazione del solstizio 21.06.12, fi, 20.JPG|thumb|The gnomon projection on the floor of [[Florence Cathedral]] during the solstice on 21 June 2012]]\nPerforated [[gnomon]]s projecting a pinhole image of the sun were described in the Chinese [[Zhoubi Suanjing]] writings (1046 BCE\u2013256 BCE with material added until circa 220 CE).<ref>{{cite publication|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CyssAQAAIAAJ&q=%22pierced+gnomon%22&dq=%22pierced+gnomon%22|title=The Asiatic Review|year=1969|last1=Boulger|first1=Demetrius Charles}}</ref> The location of the bright circle can be measured to tell the time of day and year.

These writings explain how the image in a \"collecting-point\" or \"treasure house\"<ref group=\"note\">In the ''Mozi'' passage, a camera obscura is described as a \"collecting-point\" or \"treasure house\" ([[wikt:\u5eab|\u5eab]]); the 18th-century scholar Bi Yuan ([[:zh:\u7562\u6c85|\u7562\u6c85]]) suggested this was a misprint for \"screen\" ([[wikt:\u3893|\u3893]]).</ref> is inverted by an intersecting point (a pinhole) that collects the (rays of) light. Light coming from the foot of an illuminated person would partly be hidden below (i.e., strike below the pinhole) and partly form the top part of the image. Rays from the head would partly be hidden above (i.e., strike above the pinhole) and partly form the lower part of the image. This is a remarkably early correct description of the camera obscura; there are no other examples known that are dated before the 11th century.<ref name=needham4/>\n\nThe Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384\u2013322 BCE), or possibly a follower of his ideas, touched upon the subject in the work ''[[Problems (Aristotle)|Problems]] \u2013 Book XV'', asking: {{quote|Why is it that when the sun passes through quadri-laterals, as for instance in wickerwork, it does not produce a figure rectangular in shape but circular?|sign=|source=}} and further on: {{quote|\"Why is it that an eclipse of the sun, if one looks at it through a sieve or through leaves, such as a plane-tree or other broadleaved tree, or if one joins the fingers of one hand over the fingers of the other, the rays are crescent-shaped where they reach the earth? Is it for the same reason as that when light shines through a rectangular peep-hole, it appears circular in the form of a cone?\"}}\n\nMany philosophers and scientists of the Western world would ponder this question before it became accepted that the circular and crescent-shapes described in this \"problem\" were actually pinhole image projections of the sun. Although a projected image will have the shape of the aperture when the light source, aperture and projection plane are close together, the projected image will have the shape of the light source when they are further apart.\n\nIn his book ''[[Euclid's Optics|Optics]]'' (circa 300 BCE, surviving in later manuscripts from around 1000 CE), Euclid proposed mathematical descriptions of vision with \"lines drawn directly from the eye pass through a space of great extent\" and \"the form of the space included in our vision is a cone, with its apex in the eye and its base at the limits of our vision.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=http://philomatica.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Optics-of-Euclid.pdf|title=Optics of Euclid}}</ref> Later versions of the text, like [[Ignazio Danti]]'s 1573 annotated translation, would add a description of the camera obscura principle to demonstrate Euclid's ideas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonnerweb.de/bilder/pinhole/sonnentaler/sonnentaler.htm|language=german|title=Kleine Geschichte der Lochkamera oder Camera Obscura}}</ref>\n\n===500 to 1000: Earliest experiments, study of light===\n[[File:555 anthemius of tralles - light-diagram.jpg|thumb|Anthemius of Tralles' diagram of light-rays reflected with plane mirror through hole (B)]]\nIn the 6th century, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine-Greek]] mathematician and architect [[Anthemius of Tralles]] (most famous as a co-architect of the [[Hagia Sophia]]), experimented with effects related to the camera obscura.<ref name=\"Crombie1990\">G.

But if its image is collected (''shu'')(like a belt being tightened) through a small hole in a window, then the shadow moves in the direction opposite of that of the bird.[...] This is the same principle as the burning-mirror. Such a mirror has a concave surface, and reflects a finger to give an upright image if the object is very near, but if the finger moves farther and farther away it reaches a point where the image disappears and after that the image appears inverted. Thus the point where the image disappears is like the pinhole of the window. So also the oar is fixed at the rowlock somewhere at its middle part, constituting, when it is moved, a sort of 'waist' and the handle of the oar is always in the position inverse to the end (which is in the water).\"}}\n\nShen Kuo also responded to a statement of [[Duan Chengshi]] in ''[[Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang]]'' written in about 840 that the inverted image of a [[Chinese pagoda]] tower beside a seashore, was inverted because it was reflected by the sea: \"This is nonsense.

When a foot soldier would stand in front of the camera, a twelve-person army of soldiers making the same movements would be projected.\n\nFrench mathematician, [[Minim (religious order)|Minim friar]], and painter of [[Anamorphosis|anamorphic art]] [[Jean Fran\u00e7ois Niceron|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Nic\u00e9ron]] (1613\u20131646) wrote about the camera obscura with convex lenses. He explained how the camera obscura could be used by painters to achieve perfect perspective in their work. He also complained how charlatans abused the camera obscura to fool witless spectators and make them believe that the projections were magic or occult science.

A description of what was most likely such a show in 1656 in France, was penned by the poet [[Jean Loret]]. The Parisian society were presented with upside-down images of palaces, ballet dancing and battling with swords. The performance was silent and Loret was surprised that all the movements made no sound. Loret felt somewhat frustrated that he did not know the secret that made this spectacle possible. There are several clues that this was a camera obscura show, rather than a very early magic lantern show, especially in the upside-down image and the energetic movements.<ref>http://www.magiclantern.org.uk/new-magic-lantern-journal/pdfs/4008787a.pdf</ref>\n\nGerman Jesuit scientist [[Gaspar Schott]] heard from a traveler about a small camera obscura device he had seen in Spain, which one could carry under one arm and could be hidden under a coat. He then constructed his own sliding box camera obscura, which could focus by sliding a wooden box part fitted inside another wooden box part. He wrote about this in his 1657 ''Magia universalis natur\u00e6 et artis'' (volume 1 \u2013 book 4 \"Magia Optica\" pages 199\u2013201).\n\nBy 1659 the [[magic lantern]] was introduced and partly replaced the camera obscura as a projection device, while the camera obscura mostly remained popular as a drawing aid. The magic lantern can be seen as a development of the (box-type) camera obscura device.\n\nThe 17th century [[Dutch Masters]], such as [[Johannes Vermeer]], were known for their magnificent attention to detail. It has been widely speculated that they made use of the camera obscura,<ref name=\":0\" /> but the extent of their use by artists at this period remains a matter of fierce contention, recently revived by the [[Hockney\u2013Falco thesis]].<ref name=Snyder/>\n\n[[File:1676 Johann Sturm - Camerae Obscurae Portatilis.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a portable camera obscura device from Johann Sturm's ''Collegium experimentale, sive curiosum'' (1676)]]\nGerman philosopher [[Johann Sturm]] published an illustrated article about the construction of a portable camera obscura box with a 45\u00b0 mirror and an oiled paper screen in his book ''Collegium experimentale: sive curiosum'' (1676).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbMWAAAAQAAJ|title=Collegium experimentale, sive curiosum|first=Johann|last=Sturm|year=1676|language=Latin|pages=161\u2013163}}</ref>\n\n[[Johann Zahn]]'s ''Oculus Artificialis Teledioptricus Sive Telescopium'', published in 1685, contains many descriptions, diagrams, illustrations and sketches of both the camera obscura and the [[magic lantern]].

The surroundings of the projected image have to be relatively dark for the image to be clear, so many historical camera obscura experiments were performed in dark rooms.\n\nThe term \"camera obscura\" also refers to constructions or devices that make use of the principle within a box, tent, or room. Camera obscuras with a lens in the opening have been used since the second half of the 16th century and became popular as an aid for drawing and painting. The camera obscura box was developed further into the [[Camera|photographic camera]] in the first half of the 19th century when camera obscura boxes were used to expose light-sensitive materials to the projected image.\n\nThe camera obscura was used as a means to study eclipses without the risk of damaging the eyes by looking into the sun directly. As a drawing aid, the camera obscura allowed tracing the projected image to produce a highly accurate representation, especially appreciated as an easy way to achieve a proper [[graphical perspective]].\n\nBefore the term \"camera obscura\" was first used in 1604, many others are attested: \"cubiculum obscurum\", \"cubiculum tenebricosum\", \"conclave obscurum\" and \"locus obscurus\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Optic projection, principles, installation, and use of the magic lantern, projection microscope, reflecting lantern, moving picture machine|publisher=Comstock Publishing Company|year=1914|last=Phelps Gage|first=Henry|url=https://archive.org/details/opticprojection01gagegoog|quote=obscurum cubiculum.}}</ref>\n\nA camera obscura device without a lens but with a very small hole is sometimes referred to as a \"[[pinhole camera]]\", although this more often refers to simple (home-made) lens-less cameras in which photographic film or photographic paper is used.\n\n==Physical explanation==\nRays of light travel in straight lines and change when they are reflected and partly absorbed by an object, retaining information about the color and brightness of the surface of that object. Lit objects reflect rays of light in all directions. A small enough opening in a screen only lets through rays that travel directly from different points in the scene on the other side, and these rays form an image of that scene when they are collected on a surface opposite from the opening.\n\nThe [[human eye]] (as well as those of other animals including birds, fish, reptiles etc.) works much like a camera obscura with an opening ([[pupil]]), a biconvex [[lens (anatomy)|lens]] and a surface where the image is formed ([[retina]]).\n\n==Technology==\n[[Image:Camera obscura box.jpg|left|thumb|A diagram of a camera obscura with an upright projected image at the top.]]\nA camera obscura device consists of a box, tent, or room with a small hole in one side. Light from an external scene passes through the hole and strikes a surface inside, where the scene is reproduced, inverted, (thus upside-down) and reversed (left to right), but with color and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] preserved.\n\nIn order to produce a reasonably clear projected image, the aperture has to be about 1/100th the distance to the screen, or less.\n\nAs the pinhole is made smaller, the image gets sharper, but the projected image becomes dimmer. With too small a pinhole, however, the sharpness worsens, due to [[diffraction]].\n\nIn practice, camera obscuras use a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] rather than a pinhole (as in a [[pinhole camera]]) because it allows a larger [[F-number|aperture]], giving a usable brightness while maintaining focus.\n\nIf the image is caught on a semi-transparent screen, it can be viewed from the back so that it is no longer reversed (but still upside-down).\n\nUsing mirrors it is possible to project a right-side-up image. The projection can also be diverted onto a horizontal surface (e.g., a table).

These writings explain how the image in a \"collecting-point\" or \"treasure house\"<ref group=\"note\">In the ''Mozi'' passage, a camera obscura is described as a \"collecting-point\" or \"treasure house\" ([[wikt:\u5eab|\u5eab]]); the 18th-century scholar Bi Yuan ([[:zh:\u7562\u6c85|\u7562\u6c85]]) suggested this was a misprint for \"screen\" ([[wikt:\u3893|\u3893]]).</ref> is inverted by an intersecting point (a pinhole) that collects the (rays of) light. Light coming from the foot of an illuminated person would partly be hidden below (i.e., strike below the pinhole) and partly form the top part of the image. Rays from the head would partly be hidden above (i.e., strike above the pinhole) and partly form the lower part of the image. This is a remarkably early correct description of the camera obscura; there are no other examples known that are dated before the 11th century.<ref name=needham4/>\n\nThe Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384\u2013322 BCE), or possibly a follower of his ideas, touched upon the subject in the work ''[[Problems (Aristotle)|Problems]] \u2013 Book XV'', asking: {{quote|Why is it that when the sun passes through quadri-laterals, as for instance in wickerwork, it does not produce a figure rectangular in shape but circular?|sign=|source=}} and further on: {{quote|\"Why is it that an eclipse of the sun, if one looks at it through a sieve or through leaves, such as a plane-tree or other broadleaved tree, or if one joins the fingers of one hand over the fingers of the other, the rays are crescent-shaped where they reach the earth? Is it for the same reason as that when light shines through a rectangular peep-hole, it appears circular in the form of a cone?\"}}\n\nMany philosophers and scientists of the Western world would ponder this question before it became accepted that the circular and crescent-shapes described in this \"problem\" were actually pinhole image projections of the sun. Although a projected image will have the shape of the aperture when the light source, aperture and projection plane are close together, the projected image will have the shape of the light source when they are further apart.\n\nIn his book ''[[Euclid's Optics|Optics]]'' (circa 300 BCE, surviving in later manuscripts from around 1000 CE), Euclid proposed mathematical descriptions of vision with \"lines drawn directly from the eye pass through a space of great extent\" and \"the form of the space included in our vision is a cone, with its apex in the eye and its base at the limits of our vision.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=http://philomatica.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Optics-of-Euclid.pdf|title=Optics of Euclid}}</ref> Later versions of the text, like [[Ignazio Danti]]'s 1573 annotated translation, would add a description of the camera obscura principle to demonstrate Euclid's ideas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonnerweb.de/bilder/pinhole/sonnentaler/sonnentaler.htm|language=german|title=Kleine Geschichte der Lochkamera oder Camera Obscura}}</ref>\n\n===500 to 1000: Earliest experiments, study of light===\n[[File:555 anthemius of tralles - light-diagram.jpg|thumb|Anthemius of Tralles' diagram of light-rays reflected with plane mirror through hole (B)]]\nIn the 6th century, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine-Greek]] mathematician and architect [[Anthemius of Tralles]] (most famous as a co-architect of the [[Hagia Sophia]]), experimented with effects related to the camera obscura.<ref name=\"Crombie1990\">G.

Port Said's twin city is [[Port Fuad]], which lies on the eastern bank of the canal. The two cities coexist, to the extent that there is hardly any town centre in Port Fuad. The cities are connected by free [[Ferry|ferries]] running all through the day, and together they form a [[metropolitan area]] with over a million residents that extends both on the African and the Asian sides of the Suez Canal.  The only other metropolitan area in the world that also spans two continents is [[Istanbul]].\n\nPort Said acted as a [[global city]] since its establishment and flourished particularly during the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth century when it was inhabited by various nationalities and religions. Most of them were from Mediterranean countries, and they coexisted in tolerance, forming a [[wikt:cosmopolitan|cosmopolitan]] community. Referring to this fact [[Rudyard Kipling]] once said \"If you truly wish to find someone you have known and who travels, there are two points on the globe you have but to sit and wait, sooner or later your man will come there: the docks of [[London]] and Port Said\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Port-Sa\u00efd : Architectures XIXe-XXe si\u00e8cles</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Etymology}}\n\n==Name==\nThe name of Port Said first appeared in 1855. It was chosen by an International committee composed of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], [[Second French Empire|France]], the [[Russian Empire]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[Spain]] and [[Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont|Piedmont]]. It is a compound name which composed of two parts: [[Port]] (marine harbour) and [[Sa'id of Egypt|Said]] (the name of the ruler of Egypt at that time), who granted [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] the concession to dig the Suez Canal{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}. \n\nUrbanized residents pronounce the first syllable following [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ({{IPA-arz|bo\u027e.s\u00e6\u02c8\u0295i\u02d0d, po\u027e.s\u00e6\u02c8\u0295i\u02d0d|IPA}}); unurbanized residents pronounce it {{IPA-arz|b\u0254rsa\u02c8\u0295\u025b\u02d1d|}}.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Port Said}}\n[[File:PORT-SA\u00cfD -- De Lesseps monument (n.d.) - front - TIMEA.jpg|thumb|right|Ferdinand de Lesseps monument on the tourist jetty]]\n[[File:Port-Said.

The first problem encountered was the difficulty  for ships to drop anchor nearby. Luckily, a single rocky outcrop flush with the shoreline was discovered a few hundred meters away. Equipped with a wooden wharf, it served as a mooring berth for the boats. Soon after, a wooden [[jetty]] was built, connecting the departure islet, as it quickly became known, to the beach. This rock could be considered the heart of the developing city, and it was on this highly symbolic site, forty years later, that a monument to de Lesseps was erected.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThere were no local resources here. Everything Port Said needed had to be imported: wood, stone, supplies, machinery, equipment, housing, food and even water. Giant water storage containers were erected to supply fresh water until the [[Sweet Water Canal]] could be completed. One of the most pressing problems was the lack of stone. Early buildings were often imported in kit form and made great use of wood. A newly developed technique was used to construct the jetties called conglomerate concrete or \"Beton Coignet\", which was named after its inventor [[Francois Coignet]]. Artificial blocks of concrete were sunk into the sea to be the foundations of the jetties. Still more innovative was the use of the same concrete for the [[lighthouse of Port Said]], the only original building still standing in Port Said.\nIn 1859 the first 150 laborers camped in tents around a wooden shed. A year later, the number of inhabitants had risen to 2000 \u2014 with the European contingent housed in wooden bungalows imported from northern Europe. By 1869, when the canal opened, the permanent population had reached 10,000. The European district, clustered around the waterfront, was separated from the Arab district, Gemalia, {{convert|400|m|ft|sp=us}} to the west, by a wide strip of sandy beach where a tongue of [[Lake Manzala]] reached towards the sea. This inlet soon dried out and was replaced by buildings, over time there was no division between the European and Arab quarters.\n\n[[File:Map of Port Said (Baedeker, 1914).jpg|thumb|left|French map of Port Said, ca. 1914]]\nAt the start of the twentieth century, two things happened to change Port Said: in 1902, Egyptian cotton from [[Mataria]] started to be exported via Port Said; and in 1904 a standard gauge railway opened to [[Cairo]]. The result was to attract a large commercial community and to raise its social status. In particular a sizable Greek community grew up. In 1907, the quickly growing city had about 50,000 inhabitants, among whom were 11,000 Europeans \"of all nations\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Baedeker|first1=Karl|title=Indien.

Port Fouad was designed by the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]]. The houses follow the French model. The new city was founded in December 1926.\n\nSince its foundation people of all nationalities and religions had been moving to the city and each community brought in its own customs, cuisine, religion and architecture. By the late 1920s the population numbered over 100,000 people. In the 1930s for example there were elegant public buildings designed by Italian architects. The old Arab Quarter was swallowed up into the thriving city.<ref name=\"myportsaid.info\">{{cite web |url=http://www.myportsaid.info/Brief%20History%20of%20PS.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721225230/http://www.myportsaid.info/Brief%20History%20of%20PS.html |archivedate=2011-07-21 }}</ref> Port Said by now was a thriving, bustling international port with a multi-national population: Jewish merchants, Egyptian shopkeepers, Greek photographers, Italian architects, Swiss hoteliers, Maltese administrators, Scottish engineers, French bankers and diplomats from all around the world. All lived and worked alongside the large local Egyptian community. And always passing through were international travelers to and from Africa, India and the Far East. Intermarriage between French, Italian and Maltese was particularly common, resulting in a local Latin and Catholic community like those of Alexandria and Cairo. French was the common language of the European and non-Arab population, and often the first language of children born to parents from different communities. Italian was also widely spoken and was the mother tongue of part of the Maltese community, since the ancestors of the latter had come to Egypt before the Anglicization of Malta in the 1920s. Multilingualism was a characteristic of the foreign population of Port Said, with most people continuing to speak community languages as well as the common French.\n\n[[File:Admiralty Chart No 234 Port Said, Published 1966.jpg|thumb|left|Admiralty Chart of Port Said, Published 1966]]\nSince its establishment Port Said played a significant role in Egyptian history. The British entered Egypt through the city in 1882, starting their occupation of Egypt. In 1936 a treaty was signed between the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Egypt called the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]]. It stipulated the British pledge to withdraw all their troops from Egypt, except those necessary to protect the Suez Canal and its surroundings. Following [[World War II]], Egypt denounced the Treaty of 1936, leading to skirmishes with British troops guarding the Canal in 1951.\n\nThe [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]] occurred. Then in 1956, President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] nationalised the Suez Canal Company. The nationalisation escalated tension with Britain and France, who colluded with Israel to invade Egypt, the invasion known in Egypt as the tripartite aggression or the [[Suez Crisis]]. The main battles occurred in Port Said, which played a historic role in the Suez Crisis. The withdrawal of the last soldier of foreign troops was on the 23rd of December 1956.<ref>{{cite news|title=On This Day: 1956: Jubilation as allied troops leave Suez|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/23/newsid_3294000/3294305.stm|accessdate=18 October 2016|agency=BBC|date=December 23, 1956|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226115923/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/23/newsid_3294000/3294305.stm|archive-date=26 December 2007|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Since then, this day was chosen as Port Said's national day. It is widely celebrated annually in Port Said. The French-speaking European community had begun to emigrate to Europe, Australia, South Africa and elsewhere in 1946 and most of the remainder left Egypt in the wake of the Suez Crisis, paralleling the contemporary exodus of French-speaking Europeans from Tunisia.\n\nAfter the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, also called the [[Six-Day War]], the Suez Canal was closed by an Egyptian blockade until 5 June 1975, and the residents of Port Said were evacuated by the Egyptian government to prepare for the [[Yom Kippur War]] (1973).\nThe city was re-inhabited after the war and the reopening of the Canal. In 1976, Port Said was declared a duty-free port, attracting people from all over Egypt. Now the population of the city is 603,787.\n\n==Economy==\n\nPort Said has been ranked the second among the Egyptian cities according to the [[Human Development Index]] in 2009 and 2010,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rosaonline.net/Daily/News.asp?id=36636 |title=Consejos para la vida - |accessdate=23 December 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002181958/http://www.rosaonline.net/Daily/News.asp?id=36636 |archivedate=2 October 2011 }}</ref> the economic base of the city is [[fishing]] and industries, like [[chemicals]], [[processed food]], and [[cigarettes]].

Port Said's twin city is [[Port Fuad]], which lies on the eastern bank of the canal. The two cities coexist, to the extent that there is hardly any town centre in Port Fuad. The cities are connected by free [[Ferry|ferries]] running all through the day, and together they form a [[metropolitan area]] with over a million residents that extends both on the African and the Asian sides of the Suez Canal.  The only other metropolitan area in the world that also spans two continents is [[Istanbul]].\n\nPort Said acted as a [[global city]] since its establishment and flourished particularly during the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth century when it was inhabited by various nationalities and religions. Most of them were from Mediterranean countries, and they coexisted in tolerance, forming a [[wikt:cosmopolitan|cosmopolitan]] community. Referring to this fact [[Rudyard Kipling]] once said \"If you truly wish to find someone you have known and who travels, there are two points on the globe you have but to sit and wait, sooner or later your man will come there: the docks of [[London]] and Port Said\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Port-Sa\u00efd : Architectures XIXe-XXe si\u00e8cles</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Etymology}}\n\n==Name==\nThe name of Port Said first appeared in 1855. It was chosen by an International committee composed of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], [[Second French Empire|France]], the [[Russian Empire]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[Spain]] and [[Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont|Piedmont]]. It is a compound name which composed of two parts: [[Port]] (marine harbour) and [[Sa'id of Egypt|Said]] (the name of the ruler of Egypt at that time), who granted [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] the concession to dig the Suez Canal{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}. \n\nUrbanized residents pronounce the first syllable following [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ({{IPA-arz|bo\u027e.s\u00e6\u02c8\u0295i\u02d0d, po\u027e.s\u00e6\u02c8\u0295i\u02d0d|IPA}}); unurbanized residents pronounce it {{IPA-arz|b\u0254rsa\u02c8\u0295\u025b\u02d1d|}}.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Port Said}}\n[[File:PORT-SA\u00cfD -- De Lesseps monument (n.d.) - front - TIMEA.jpg|thumb|right|Ferdinand de Lesseps monument on the tourist jetty]]\n[[File:Port-Said.

The first problem encountered was the difficulty  for ships to drop anchor nearby. Luckily, a single rocky outcrop flush with the shoreline was discovered a few hundred meters away. Equipped with a wooden wharf, it served as a mooring berth for the boats. Soon after, a wooden [[jetty]] was built, connecting the departure islet, as it quickly became known, to the beach. This rock could be considered the heart of the developing city, and it was on this highly symbolic site, forty years later, that a monument to de Lesseps was erected.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThere were no local resources here. Everything Port Said needed had to be imported: wood, stone, supplies, machinery, equipment, housing, food and even water. Giant water storage containers were erected to supply fresh water until the [[Sweet Water Canal]] could be completed. One of the most pressing problems was the lack of stone. Early buildings were often imported in kit form and made great use of wood. A newly developed technique was used to construct the jetties called conglomerate concrete or \"Beton Coignet\", which was named after its inventor [[Francois Coignet]]. Artificial blocks of concrete were sunk into the sea to be the foundations of the jetties. Still more innovative was the use of the same concrete for the [[lighthouse of Port Said]], the only original building still standing in Port Said.\nIn 1859 the first 150 laborers camped in tents around a wooden shed. A year later, the number of inhabitants had risen to 2000 \u2014 with the European contingent housed in wooden bungalows imported from northern Europe. By 1869, when the canal opened, the permanent population had reached 10,000. The European district, clustered around the waterfront, was separated from the Arab district, Gemalia, {{convert|400|m|ft|sp=us}} to the west, by a wide strip of sandy beach where a tongue of [[Lake Manzala]] reached towards the sea. This inlet soon dried out and was replaced by buildings, over time there was no division between the European and Arab quarters.\n\n[[File:Map of Port Said (Baedeker, 1914).jpg|thumb|left|French map of Port Said, ca. 1914]]\nAt the start of the twentieth century, two things happened to change Port Said: in 1902, Egyptian cotton from [[Mataria]] started to be exported via Port Said; and in 1904 a standard gauge railway opened to [[Cairo]]. The result was to attract a large commercial community and to raise its social status. In particular a sizable Greek community grew up. In 1907, the quickly growing city had about 50,000 inhabitants, among whom were 11,000 Europeans \"of all nations\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Baedeker|first1=Karl|title=Indien.

Port Fouad was designed by the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]]. The houses follow the French model. The new city was founded in December 1926.\n\nSince its foundation people of all nationalities and religions had been moving to the city and each community brought in its own customs, cuisine, religion and architecture. By the late 1920s the population numbered over 100,000 people. In the 1930s for example there were elegant public buildings designed by Italian architects. The old Arab Quarter was swallowed up into the thriving city.<ref name=\"myportsaid.info\">{{cite web |url=http://www.myportsaid.info/Brief%20History%20of%20PS.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721225230/http://www.myportsaid.info/Brief%20History%20of%20PS.html |archivedate=2011-07-21 }}</ref> Port Said by now was a thriving, bustling international port with a multi-national population: Jewish merchants, Egyptian shopkeepers, Greek photographers, Italian architects, Swiss hoteliers, Maltese administrators, Scottish engineers, French bankers and diplomats from all around the world. All lived and worked alongside the large local Egyptian community. And always passing through were international travelers to and from Africa, India and the Far East. Intermarriage between French, Italian and Maltese was particularly common, resulting in a local Latin and Catholic community like those of Alexandria and Cairo. French was the common language of the European and non-Arab population, and often the first language of children born to parents from different communities. Italian was also widely spoken and was the mother tongue of part of the Maltese community, since the ancestors of the latter had come to Egypt before the Anglicization of Malta in the 1920s. Multilingualism was a characteristic of the foreign population of Port Said, with most people continuing to speak community languages as well as the common French.\n\n[[File:Admiralty Chart No 234 Port Said, Published 1966.jpg|thumb|left|Admiralty Chart of Port Said, Published 1966]]\nSince its establishment Port Said played a significant role in Egyptian history. The British entered Egypt through the city in 1882, starting their occupation of Egypt. In 1936 a treaty was signed between the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Egypt called the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]]. It stipulated the British pledge to withdraw all their troops from Egypt, except those necessary to protect the Suez Canal and its surroundings. Following [[World War II]], Egypt denounced the Treaty of 1936, leading to skirmishes with British troops guarding the Canal in 1951.\n\nThe [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]] occurred. Then in 1956, President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] nationalised the Suez Canal Company. The nationalisation escalated tension with Britain and France, who colluded with Israel to invade Egypt, the invasion known in Egypt as the tripartite aggression or the [[Suez Crisis]]. The main battles occurred in Port Said, which played a historic role in the Suez Crisis. The withdrawal of the last soldier of foreign troops was on the 23rd of December 1956.<ref>{{cite news|title=On This Day: 1956: Jubilation as allied troops leave Suez|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/23/newsid_3294000/3294305.stm|accessdate=18 October 2016|agency=BBC|date=December 23, 1956|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226115923/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/23/newsid_3294000/3294305.stm|archive-date=26 December 2007|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Since then, this day was chosen as Port Said's national day. It is widely celebrated annually in Port Said. The French-speaking European community had begun to emigrate to Europe, Australia, South Africa and elsewhere in 1946 and most of the remainder left Egypt in the wake of the Suez Crisis, paralleling the contemporary exodus of French-speaking Europeans from Tunisia.\n\nAfter the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, also called the [[Six-Day War]], the Suez Canal was closed by an Egyptian blockade until 5 June 1975, and the residents of Port Said were evacuated by the Egyptian government to prepare for the [[Yom Kippur War]] (1973).\nThe city was re-inhabited after the war and the reopening of the Canal. In 1976, Port Said was declared a duty-free port, attracting people from all over Egypt. Now the population of the city is 603,787.\n\n==Economy==\n\nPort Said has been ranked the second among the Egyptian cities according to the [[Human Development Index]] in 2009 and 2010,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rosaonline.net/Daily/News.asp?id=36636 |title=Consejos para la vida - |accessdate=23 December 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002181958/http://www.rosaonline.net/Daily/News.asp?id=36636 |archivedate=2 October 2011 }}</ref> the economic base of the city is [[fishing]] and industries, like [[chemicals]], [[processed food]], and [[cigarettes]]. Port Said is also an important harbour for exports of Egyptian products like [[cotton]] and [[rice]], but also a fueling station for ships that pass through the Suez Canal.
