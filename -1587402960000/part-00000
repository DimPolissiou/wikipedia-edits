Romance languages that use this letter include [[Catalan alphabet|Catalan]], [[French alphabet|French]], [[Friulian alphabet|Friulian]], [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]], [[Occitan alphabet|Occitan]], and [[Portuguese alphabet|Portuguese]] as a variant of the letter ''[[C]]''. It is also occasionally used in [[Crimean Tatar alphabet|Crimean Tatar]] and in [[Tajik alphabet|Tajik]] (when written in the Latin script) to represent the {{IPAslink|d\u0361\u0292}} sound. It is often retained in the spelling of [[loanword]]s from any of these languages in [[English language|English]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and other Latin script spelled languages.\n\nIt was first used for the sound of the [[voiceless alveolar affricate]] {{IPAslink|t\u0361s}} in [[Old Spanish language|Old Spanish]] and stems from the [[Visigothic script|Visigothic form of the letter ''z'']] (''\ua762''). The [[phoneme]] originated in [[Vulgar Latin]] from the [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] of the plosives {{IPAslink|t}} and {{IPAslink|k}} in some conditions. Later, {{IPA|/t\u0361s/}} changed into {{IPAslink|s}} in many [[Romance language]]s and dialects. Spanish has not used the symbol since an [[orthographic reform]] in the 18th century (which replaced ''\u00e7'' with the now-devoiced ''z''), but it was adopted for writing other languages.\n\nIn the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], {{IPAslink|\u00e7}} represents the [[voiceless palatal fricative]].\n\n==Usage as a letter variant in various languages==\n[[File:Visigothic Z-C cedille.svg|thumb|200px|right|Evolution from Visigoth Z to lallalalaa\nAllalamodern \u00c7.]]\nIn many languages, {{angbr|\u00e7}} represents the \"soft\" sound {{IPAslink|s}} where a {{angbr|c}} would normally represent the \"hard\" sound {{IPAslink|k}}. These include:\n*[[Catalan language|Catalan]]. Known as ''ce trencada'' ('broken C') in this language, where it can be used before {{angbr|a}}, {{angbr|o}}, {{angbr|u}} or at the end of a word. Some examples of words with {{angbr|\u00e7}} are ''amena\u00e7a'' ('menace'), ''tor\u00e7at'' ('twisted'), ''xori\u00e7o'' ('chorizo'), ''for\u00e7ut'' ('strong'), ''dol\u00e7'' ('sweet') and ''ca\u00e7a'' ('hunting'). A well-known word with this character is ''Bar\u00e7a'', a common Catalan clipping of [[FC Barcelona|Futbol Club Barcelona]].\n*[[French language|French]] (''c\u00e9 c\u00e9dille''): ''fran\u00e7ais'' ('French'), ''gar\u00e7on'' ('boy'), ''fa\u00e7ade'' ('frontage'), ''grin\u00e7ant'' ('squeaking'), ''le\u00e7on'' ('lesson'), ''re\u00e7u'' ('received' [past participle]). French does not use the character at the end of a word but it can occur at the beginning of a word (e.g., ''\u00e7a'', 'that').<ref name=\":0\">The [[Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise]] online [http://atilf.atilf.fr/academie9.htm dictionary] also gives ''\u00e7\u00e0'' and ''[[:fr:Sho\u00fbdra|\u00e7\u00fbdra]]''.</ref>\n*[[Occitan language|Occitan]] (''ce cedilha''): ''tor\u00e7ut'' ('twisted'), ''\u00e7\u00f2'' ('this'), ''\u00e7a que la'' ('nevertheless'), ''bra\u00e7'' ('arm'), ''br\u00e8\u00e7'' ('cradle'), ''vora\u00e7'' ('voracious'). It can occur at the beginning of a word.\n*[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (''c\u00ea-cedilha'' or ''c\u00ea cedilhado''): it is used before {{angbr|a}}, {{angbr|o}}, {{angbr|u}}: ''ta\u00e7a'' ('cup'), ''bra\u00e7o'' ('arm'), ''a\u00e7\u00facar'' ('sugar'). Modern Portuguese does not use the character at the beginning or at the end of a word (the nickname for ''Concei\u00e7\u00e3o'' is ''S\u00e3o'', not ''\u00c7\u00e3o''). According to a Portuguese grammar written in 1550, the letter \u00e7 had the sound of /dz/ around that time.

Romance languages that use this letter include [[Catalan alphabet|Catalan]], [[French alphabet|French]], [[Friulian alphabet|Friulian]], [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]], [[Occitan alphabet|Occitan]], and [[Portuguese alphabet|Portuguese]] as a variant of the letter ''[[C]]''. It is also occasionally used in [[Crimean Tatar alphabet|Crimean Tatar]] and in [[Tajik alphabet|Tajik]] (when written in the Latin script) to represent the {{IPAslink|d\u0361\u0292}} sound. It is often retained in the spelling of [[loanword]]s from any of these languages in [[English language|English]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and other Latin script spelled languages.\n\nIt was first used for the sound of the [[voiceless alveolar affricate]] {{IPAslink|t\u0361s}} in [[Old Spanish language|Old Spanish]] and stems from the [[Visigothic script|Visigothic form of the letter ''z'']] (''\ua762''). The [[phoneme]] originated in [[Vulgar Latin]] from the [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] of the plosives {{IPAslink|t}} and {{IPAslink|k}} in some conditions. Later, {{IPA|/t\u0361s/}} changed into {{IPAslink|s}} in many [[Romance language]]s and dialects. Spanish has not used the symbol since an [[orthographic reform]] in the 18th century (which replaced ''\u00e7'' with the now-devoiced ''z''), but it was adopted for writing other languages.\n\nIn the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], {{IPAslink|\u00e7}} represents the [[voiceless palatal fricative]].\n\n==Usage as a letter variant in various languages==\n[[File:Visigothic Z-C cedille.svg|thumb|200px|right|Evolution from Visigoth Z to modern \u00c7.]]\nIn many languages, {{angbr|\u00e7}} represents the \"soft\" sound {{IPAslink|s}} where a {{angbr|c}} would normally represent the \"hard\" sound {{IPAslink|k}}. These include:\n*[[Catalan language|Catalan]]. Known as ''ce trencada'' ('broken C') in this language, where it can be used before {{angbr|a}}, {{angbr|o}}, {{angbr|u}} or at the end of a word.

The park contains examples of most of Zimbabwe\u2019s plains game species, including zebra, giraffe, kudu, impala, tsessebe, bushbuck and warthog. The campus is surrounded by an electric fence (a reminder of the [[Rhodesian Bush War|bush war]] of pre-1980).

It was opened by the [[Governor General]] of the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]], [[John Jestyn Llewellin, 1st Baron Llewellin|Lord Llewellin]], on Saturday 10 April 1954. Much has changed since then but the college has some remains of its founding days.\n\nThe original motto was ''Arduus ad Solem''. The newer Motto is: Sic Itur Ad Astra\nThe school motto comes from the words of Publius Vergilius Marote (70-19BC) a classical Roman poet who wrote: \u201cnova virtute, puer; sic itur ad astra\u201d which translates: Look to your new-found courage, young man, for that is the way to the stars.\n\nIn the beginning the boys were divided into three colour groups for sport, Whites, Blues and Khakis. Later, the houses were named A,B,C and D and in April 1956, Sir [[Robert Clarkson Tredgold]], Chairman of the Board of Governors, announced that the houses were to be renamed Hervey, Oates, Tredgold and Founders. Founders was so named to commemorate the Founders of the School; Tredgold after Sir [[Robert Clarkson Tredgold]], who was also Chief Justice of Southern Rhodesia; Oates after [[Frank Oates]], explorer and naturalist who travelled extensively in southern central Africa in the 19th century; and Hervey after Hubert Hervey, adventurer, gentleman and soldier, who was killed in the 2nd Matabele war, and who was buried in the [[Matopos]].<ref name=SRRSS>{{citation|editor=[[I.P.

Although the vast majority of students are Zimbabwean, others attend from neighbouring countries ([[Zambia]], [[Botswana]]). Some [[scholarships]] are available to deserving students whose particular financial circumstances do not allow for the payment of school fees.\n\n==The house system==\nThe school is based on a '''[[house system]]''' that is divided into six [[House system|Houses]]; Founders, Hervey, Oates, Tredgold, George Grey and Chubb, each comprising the full range of year groups. Each house has a [[housemaster]] in charge who lives nearby. Each housemaster has a house Tutor and two assistant tutors, as well as other members of staff, who assist in duties.\n<ref name=\"Falcon Old Boys\">{{cite web |url=http://www.falconoldboys.com/index.php/about/the-college/ |title=Falcon Old Boys |website= Falcon Old Boys |publisher= Falcon College Old Boys |accessdate= 7 November 2015 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Falcon College Website\">{{cite web |url=http://www.falconcollege.com/house-tutors// |title=Falcon College  |website= Falcon College  |publisher= Falcon College |accessdate= 7 November 2015 }}</ref>\n \nBoys can either go home, or (with parental permission) to friends or relatives on two Fixture Frees which last from break time on a Friday to dinner time on the following Monday.

The college's graduates include a British member of parliament, surgeons and doctors, leaders of industry and commerce, soldiers and educators.\n\nThe college has 40&nbsp;km\u00b2 of Matabeleland bush, 10&nbsp;km\u00b2 approximately is game fenced and houses [[Quiet Waters]] game park. The park contains examples of most of Zimbabwe\u2019s plains game species, including zebra, giraffe, kudu, impala, tsessebe, bushbuck and warthog. The campus is surrounded by an electric fence (a reminder of the [[Rhodesian Bush War|bush war]] of pre-1980). An air strip is nearby.\n\nThe school's motto is ''Sic itur ad astra'' and the school badge is a representation of a [[Lanner Falcon]] designed by the wife of a former Headmaster.\n\nFalcon College was ranked as one of the Top 10 High Schools in Zimbabwe in 2014.<ref name=\"Top 10 High Schools in Zimbabwe\">{{cite web |author = DarrylYV8 |url= http://youthvillage.co.zw/2014/10/top-10-high-schools-in-zimbabwe/|title= Top 10 High Schools in Zimbabwe |date= 9 October 2014 |website= Youth Village Zimbabwe |publisher= Youth Village Zimbabwe |accessdate= 5 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nFalcon College is a member of the [[Association of Trust Schools]] (ATS) and the Headmaster is a member of the [[Conference of Heads of Independent Schools in Zimbabwe]] (CHISZ).<ref name=\"ATS Directory\">{{cite web |url= http://www.atschisz.co.zw/schools-directory/wpbdp_category/senior/ |title= ATS CHISZ Senior \u00bb \u00bb Schools Directory |website= ATS CHISZ |publisher=ATS CHISZ |access-date= 13 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2015 Falcon became a coeducational school accepting girls in January 2016.\n\n== Historical background ==\n\nOriginally [[Bushtick Mine]], and with 36 boys and a handful of staff, the college was founded on Wednesday 3 February 1954. It was opened by the [[Governor General]] of the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]], [[John Jestyn Llewellin, 1st Baron Llewellin|Lord Llewellin]], on Saturday 10 April 1954. Much has changed since then but the college has some remains of its founding days.\n\nThe original motto was ''Arduus ad Solem''. The newer Motto is: Sic Itur Ad Astra\nThe school motto comes from the words of Publius Vergilius Marote (70-19BC) a classical Roman poet who wrote: \u201cnova virtute, puer; sic itur ad astra\u201d which translates: Look to your new-found courage, young man, for that is the way to the stars.\n\nIn the beginning the boys were divided into three colour groups for sport, Whites, Blues and Khakis. Later, the houses were named A,B,C and D and in April 1956, Sir [[Robert Clarkson Tredgold]], Chairman of the Board of Governors, announced that the houses were to be renamed Hervey, Oates, Tredgold and Founders. Founders was so named to commemorate the Founders of the School; Tredgold after Sir [[Robert Clarkson Tredgold]], who was also Chief Justice of Southern Rhodesia; Oates after [[Frank Oates]], explorer and naturalist who travelled extensively in southern central Africa in the 19th century; and Hervey after Hubert Hervey, adventurer, gentleman and soldier, who was killed in the 2nd Matabele war, and who was buried in the [[Matopos]].<ref name=SRRSS>{{citation|editor=[[I.P.

Although the vast majority of students are Zimbabwean, others attend from neighbouring countries ([[Zambia]], [[Botswana]]). Some [[scholarships]] are available to deserving students whose particular financial circumstances do not allow for the payment of school fees.\n\n==The house system==\nThe school is based on a '''[[house system]]''' that is divided into six [[House system|Houses]]; Founders, Hervey, Oates, Tredgold, George Grey and Chubb, each comprising the full range of year groups. Each house has a [[housemaster]] in charge who lives nearby. Each housemaster has a house Tutor and two assistant tutors, as well as other members of staff, who assist in duties.\n<ref name=\"Falcon Old Boys\">{{cite web |url=http://www.falconoldboys.com/index.php/about/the-college/ |title=Falcon Old Boys |website= Falcon Old Boys |publisher= Falcon College Old Boys |accessdate= 7 November 2015 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Falcon College Website\">{{cite web |url=http://www.falconcollege.com/house-tutors// |title=Falcon College  |website= Falcon College  |publisher= Falcon College |accessdate= 7 November 2015 }}</ref>\n \nBoys can either go home, or (with parental permission) to friends or relatives on two Fixture Frees which last from break time on a Friday to dinner time on the following Monday.
