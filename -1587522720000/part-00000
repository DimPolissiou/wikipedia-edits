By the 1870s, the community numbered around 1,000 and looked to build a permanent synagogue for the first time in Scotland as the converted synagogue in George Street (opened 1878) was full. This decision to build the synagogue was decided by the Special General Meeting in October 1875 and the site at the corner of Garnet Street and Hill Street was decided by a majority of votes as the location for the new Synagogue. It was believed that this location was popular because many of the Jewish community were moving to the West of the city, especially many of the leading figures of the community such as Benjamin and Michael Simons.<ref>Collins, K (1990). Second City Jewry: Jews of Glasgow in the Age of Expansion 1790-1919, pg 38</ref> Archive records show that money began coming in through donations to help fund the building of the Synagogue on 24 November 1875. The foundation stone was set by Benjamin Simons two years later in March. Benjamin Simon was one of the trustees. The finished synagogue was officially opened on 9 September 1879 with Rabbi Hermann Adler consecrating the opening. The first service was also held on this date.<ref>Collins, K (1990).

The King remarried to [[Lilian, Princess of R\u00e9thy|Mary Lilian Baels]] in 1941, an unpopular union that produced three more children: [[Prince Alexandre of Belgium|Prince Alexandre]], [[Princess Marie-Christine of Belgium|Princess Marie-Christine]] and [[Princess Marie-Esm\u00e9ralda of Belgium|Princess Marie-Esm\u00e9ralda]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], on 10 May 1940, at the time when Belgium was being [[Battle of Belgium|invaded]], Prince Albert, his elder sister [[Princess Jos\u00e9phine Charlotte of Belgium|Princess Jos\u00e9phine-Charlotte]] and his elder brother [[Baudouin of Belgium|Prince Baudouin]], left the country for [[France during World War II|France]] and later [[Spain during World War II|Spain]]. The Prince and the Princess returned to Belgium on 2 August 1940. They continued their studies until 1944, either at [[Laeken]], or at the [[Royal Castle of Ciergnon|Castle of Ciergnon]] in [[the Ardennes]]. In June 1944, at the time of the [[Operation Overlord|Allied landings]], King Leopold, his wife Princess Lilian and the royal children were deported by the Germans to [[Hirschstein]], Germany, and later to [[Strobl]], Austria, where they were liberated by the American Army on 7 May 1945. Owing to the political situation in Belgium, King Leopold and his family moved to the villa \"Le Reposoir\" in [[Pregny-Chamb\u00e9sy|Pregny]], Switzerland, when they left Austria in October 1945 and stayed until July 1950. During that time, Prince Albert would continue his education in a secondary school in [[Geneva]]. King Leopold III, accompanied by Prince Baudouin and Prince Albert, returned to Belgium on 22 July 1950.<ref name=\"King Albert II\"/>\n\n== Marriage and family ==\n[[File:George and Laura Bush, King Albert II and Queen Paola of Belgium.jpg|thumb|King Albert II and Queen Paola with US President [[George W.

reigned as [[King of the Belgians]], from 1993 until his [[abdication]] in 2013.\n\nKing Albert II is the son of [[King Leopold III]] and [[Queen Astrid]], born princess of Sweden. He is the younger brother of Grand Duchess [[Princess Jos\u00e9phine-Charlotte of Belgium|Jos\u00e9phine-Charlotte]] of Luxembourg and [[Baudouin of Belgium|King Baudouin]], whom he succeeded upon Baudouin's death in 1993. He is currently the last living child of Leopold III and Astrid. He married Donna Paola Ruffo di Calabria (now [[Queen Paola]]), with whom he had three children. Albert's eldest son, [[Philippe of Belgium|Philippe]], is the current King of the Belgians.\n\nOn 3 July 2013, King Albert II attended a midday session of the [[Cabinet of Belgium|Belgian cabinet]]. He then announced that, on 21 July, [[Belgian National Day]], he would abdicate the throne for health reasons. He was succeeded by his son [[Philippe of Belgium|Philippe]] on 21 July 2013. Albert II was the fourth monarch to abdicate in 2013, following [[Pope Benedict XVI]], [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands]], and [[Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani|Emir Hamad bin Khalifa of Qatar]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite news|author=Matthew Price |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23167525 |title=Belgium's King Albert II announces abdication |date=3 July 2013|work=BBC News }}</ref> In so doing, he was also the second Belgian monarch to abdicate, following his father [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold III]] who abdicated in 1951, albeit under very different circumstances.\n\n== Early life ==\nPrince Albert was born in [[Ch\u00e2teau du Stuyvenberg|Stuyvenberg Castle]], [[Brussels]], as the second son and youngest child of [[Leopold III of Belgium|King Leopold III]] and his first wife, Princess [[Astrid of Sweden]]. He was second in line to the throne at birth, and was given the title [[Prince of Li\u00e8ge]]. Queen Astrid died in a car accident on 29 August 1935, in which King Leopold was lightly injured but survived. The King remarried to [[Lilian, Princess of R\u00e9thy|Mary Lilian Baels]] in 1941, an unpopular union that produced three more children: [[Prince Alexandre of Belgium|Prince Alexandre]], [[Princess Marie-Christine of Belgium|Princess Marie-Christine]] and [[Princess Marie-Esm\u00e9ralda of Belgium|Princess Marie-Esm\u00e9ralda]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], on 10 May 1940, at the time when Belgium was being [[Battle of Belgium|invaded]], Prince Albert, his elder sister [[Princess Jos\u00e9phine Charlotte of Belgium|Princess Jos\u00e9phine-Charlotte]] and his elder brother [[Baudouin of Belgium|Prince Baudouin]], left the country for [[France during World War II|France]] and later [[Spain during World War II|Spain]]. The Prince and the Princess returned to Belgium on 2 August 1940. They continued their studies until 1944, either at [[Laeken]], or at the [[Royal Castle of Ciergnon|Castle of Ciergnon]] in [[the Ardennes]]. In June 1944, at the time of the [[Operation Overlord|Allied landings]], King Leopold, his wife Princess Lilian and the royal children were deported by the Germans to [[Hirschstein]], Germany, and later to [[Strobl]], Austria, where they were liberated by the American Army on 7 May 1945. Owing to the political situation in Belgium, King Leopold and his family moved to the villa \"Le Reposoir\" in [[Pregny-Chamb\u00e9sy|Pregny]], Switzerland, when they left Austria in October 1945 and stayed until July 1950. During that time, Prince Albert would continue his education in a secondary school in [[Geneva]]. King Leopold III, accompanied by Prince Baudouin and Prince Albert, returned to Belgium on 22 July 1950.<ref name=\"King Albert II\"/>\n\n== Marriage and family ==\n[[File:George and Laura Bush, King Albert II and Queen Paola of Belgium.jpg|thumb|King Albert II and Queen Paola with US President [[George W.

At a reception at the Belgian Embassy, he met Italian Donna [[Paola Ruffo di Calabria]]. Prince Albert proposed marriage to her, to which she accepted. Two months after their meeting, the prince introduced his future wife to his family, and four months later to the press. The couple married on 2 July 1959 and have three children, two sons and a daughter, twelve grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

It was a twin [[turboprop]] configuration, and carried two crew members in side-by-side seating. The Mohawk was intended to operate from short, unimproved runways in support of [[United States Army]] maneuver forces.\n\n==Development==\n{{Listen\n| image       = [[File:Crystal Project video camera.png|50px]]\n| help        = no\n| filename    = Overview of OV-1 Mohawk-1960.ogv\n| title       = Overview of the OV-1 Mohawk (1960)\n}}\nThe Mohawk began as a joint Army-Marine program through the then-Navy [[Bureau of Aeronautics]] (BuAer), for an observation/attack plane that would outperform the [[Cessna O-1 Bird Dog|Cessna L-19 Bird Dog]]. In June 1956, the Army issued Type Specification TS145, which called for the development and procurement of a two-seat, twin turboprop aircraft designed to operate from small, unimproved fields under all weather conditions. It would be faster, with greater firepower, and heavier armour than the Bird Dog, which had proved vulnerable during the [[Korean War]]. The Mohawk's mission would include observation, [[Artillery observer|artillery spotting]], air control, emergency resupply, naval target spotting, liaison, and radiological monitoring. The Navy specified that the aircraft must be capable of operating from small \"jeep\" [[Escort carrier|escort class carriers]] (CVEs). The DoD selected Grumman Aircraft Corporation's G-134 design as the winner of the competition in 1957. Marine requirements contributed an unusual feature to the design. As originally proposed, the OF-1 could be fitted with water skis that would allow the aircraft to land at sea and taxi to island beaches at 20 knots. Since the Marines were authorized to operate fixed-wing aircraft in the [[close air support]] (CAS) role, the mockup also featured underwing pylons for rockets, bombs, and other stores.\n\nThe Air Force did not like the armament capability of the Mohawk and tried to get it removed. The Marines did not want the sophisticated sensors the Army wanted, so when their Navy sponsors opted to buy a fleet oil tanker, they dropped from the program. The Army continued with armed Mohawks and developed cargo pods that could be dropped from underwing hard points to resupply troops in emergencies.\n\n{{Listen\n| image       = [[File:Crystal Project video camera.png|50px]]\n| help        = no\n| filename    = Overview of SLAR on OV-1D Mohawk.ogv\n| title       = The OV-1 Mohawk's SLAR capabilities\n}}\nThe radar imaging capability of the Mohawk was to prove a significant advance in both peace and war. The [[Side looking airborne radar|Side-Looking Airborne Radar]] (SLAR) could look through foliage and map terrain, presenting the observer with a film image of the earth below only minutes after the area was scanned. In military operations, the image was split in two parts, one showing fixed terrain features, the other spotting moving targets.\n\nThe prototype (''YAO-1AF'') first flew on April 14, 1959. The OV-1 entered production in October 1959.\n\nIn mid-1961, the first Mohawks to serve with U.S. forces overseas were delivered to the [[United States Army Europe|7th Army]] at [[Coleman Army Airfield|Sandhofen Airfield]] near Mannheim, Germany. Before its formal acceptance, the camera-carrying AO-1AF was flown by Ralph Donnell on a tour of 29 European airfields to display it to the U.S. Army field commanders and potential European customers. In addition to their Vietnam and European service, SLAR-equipped Mohawks began operational missions in 1963 patrolling the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]]. Germany and France showed early interest in the Mohawk, and Grumman actually signed a license production agreement with the French manufacturer [[Breguet Aviation]] in exchange for American rights to the [[Breguet Atlantic|Atlantic]] maritime patrol aircraft.\n\nThe very nature of the joint Army/Marine program had forced design compromises, such as [[ejection seat]]s,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ejectionsite.com/ov1seats.htm |title = The Ejection Site: OV-1 Mohawk Ejection Seats}}</ref> that made the aircraft expensive and, sometimes, an openly resisted item in Army budgets. Orders for the OV-1 stopped in Fiscal 1964, and the controversy in the Pentagon over the armed Mohawk peaked with a 1965 directive that prohibited the Army from operating armed fixed-wing aircraft (See the [[Johnson-McConnell agreement of 1966]]). Operational success in Vietnam led to additional Mohawk orders in 1966, and by 1968, five surveillance companies were operating in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe last of the Mohawk versions to enter production was the OV-1D with more powerful [[Lycoming T53|T53-701]] engines, improved avionics, and interchangeable mission pallets that made it possible to switch the aircraft from infrared to SLAR configuration in about an hour. The first four OV-1Ds were prototypes converted from earlier production airframes, and the first flew in 1969. These were followed by 37 new-build aircraft, the last of which was delivered in December 1970.\n\n[[File:OV-1 Mohawk proposed variants diagrams.png|thumb|Proposed variants of the OV-1]]\nOver the years, the mission and the aircraft underwent many changes and roughly 380 were built over all variants. Mohawk variants included the JOV-1 [armed reconnaissance], OV-1A, [visual and photographic], OV-1B [visual, photographic, and side-looking radar (SLAR) pod], the OV-1C [visual, photographic, and infrared], and the OV-1D (SLAR pod and bigger wings), OV-1E [enlarged fuselage for more sensor operators or cargo], EV-1E [special [[Signals intelligence#ELINT|electronic intelligence]] installation] and RV-1E [advanced ELINT reconnaissance]. A four-engined Model 134E with [[tiltwing]]s and tail [[ducted fan]] for control for [[VTOL]] was proposed to the Army but not built. Model 134R was a tandem cockpit version offered to meet the [[North American Rockwell OV-10 Bronco#Light Armed Reconnaissance Aircraft|Light Armed Reconnaissance Aircraft]] (LARA) requirement, but the NA300 was chosen instead becoming the [[North American Rockwell OV-10 Bronco|OV-10]].\n\n==Operational history==\n{{expand section|date=August 2015}}\n\n=== United States Army ===\nThe U.S. Army flew the OV-1 operationally in the [[Vietnam War]], with sixty-five lost to accidents, ground fire, and one shot down by a North Vietnamese fighter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/the-ov-1-mohawk-remembered-firsthand-piloting-the-mohawk-in-vietnam/|title=The OV-1 Mohawk Remembered Firsthand: Piloting the Mohawk in Vietnam|publisher=Defense Media Network|date=24 September 2013|accessdate=15 December 2015}}</ref> The Army also used the aircraft during [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]].\n\nStarting in 1972, the [[Army National Guard]] (ARNG) began to receive the Mohawk, with the ARNG eventually operating thirteen OV-1Bs, twenty-four OV-1Cs, and sixteen OV-1Ds serving with three aviation units in Georgia and Oregon.  The Oregon Army National Guard Unit operating the Mohawk was located at [[McNary Field]] in Oregon, initially as the 1042nd Military Intelligence Company (Aerial Surveillance), then reflagged as the 641st Military Intelligence Battalion (CEWI)(Aerial Exploitation).\n\nU.S. Army OV-1s were retired from Europe in 1992, from Korea in September 1996, and finally in the United States in 1996, superseded by newer systems, newer aircraft, and the evolution of [[reconnaissance satellite]]s. The OV-1 was primarily replaced by the EO-5C, a militarized version of the [[de Havilland Canada Dash 7]] turboprop airliner equipped with a SLAR system, until the U.S. Air Force's [[Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS]] (Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System) aircraft became fully operational.\n\nAs of 2011, [[Alliant Techsystems]] partnered with the Broadbay Group and Mohawk Technologies of Florida in a venture to return an armed, modernized version of the OV-1D to operational use as a [[counter-insurgency aircraft]].  A demonstrator was equipped with a [[Forward looking infrared|FLIR]] Star Safire turret and a ventral, trainable [[M230 chain gun]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Defense Technology International Magazine |date=April 2011 |volume=5 |issue=4) |page=40 |publisher=McGraw-Hill/DTI |location=Washington, D.C. |issn=1935-6269}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://defensetech.org/2010/10/28/old-school-coin-planes-keep-coming-back/ |first=John |last=Reed |title=Old School COIN Planes Keep Coming Back |work=Defensetech |date=2010-10-28}}</ref>\n\n=== Argentine Army ===\n{{expand section|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe [[Argentine Army Aviation]] received twenty-three OV-1 in the 1990s.

Due to the Key West Agreement, the Army wanted to keep the shootdown a secret in fears that it would allow the USAF to yank its Mohawks from the inventory.  Lee's kill was finally formally recognized by the Army in 2007.  The Mohawk would serve until 1996, when it was formally retired from the US Army\u2019s inventory.<ref>https://warisboring.com/the-armys-only-air-to-air-kill-since-wwii-was-done-with-a-50-cal-in-vietnam/</ref>\n\nOn November 1, 2019 at 13:15, a Grumman OV-1D Mohawk operated by Mohawk Airshows crashed at Witham Field (SUA, KSUA), Stuart, Florida, during the Stuart Air Show.

It was a twin [[turboprop]] configuration, and carried two crew members in side-by-side seating. The Mohawk was intended to operate from short, unimproved runways in support of [[United States Army]] maneuver forces.\n\n==Development==\n{{Listen\n| image       = [[File:Crystal Project video camera.png|50px]]\n| help        = no\n| filename    = Overview of OV-1 Mohawk-1960.ogv\n| title       = Overview of the OV-1 Mohawk (1960)\n}}\nThe Mohawk began as a joint Army-Marine program through the then-Navy [[Bureau of Aeronautics]] (BuAer), for an observation/attack plane that would outperform the [[Cessna O-1 Bird Dog|Cessna L-19 Bird Dog]]. In June 1956, the Army issued Type Specification TS145, which called for the development and procurement of a two-seat, twin turboprop aircraft designed to operate from small, unimproved fields under all weather conditions. It would be faster, with greater firepower, and heavier armour than the Bird Dog, which had proved vulnerable during the [[Korean War]]. The Mohawk's mission would include observation, [[Artillery observer|artillery spotting]], air control, emergency resupply, naval target spotting, liaison, and radiological monitoring. The Navy specified that the aircraft must be capable of operating from small \"jeep\" [[Escort carrier|escort class carriers]] (CVEs). The DoD selected Grumman Aircraft Corporation's G-134 design as the winner of the competition in 1957. Marine requirements contributed an unusual feature to the design. As originally proposed, the OF-1 could be fitted with water skis that would allow the aircraft to land at sea and taxi to island beaches at 20 knots. Since the Marines were authorized to operate fixed-wing aircraft in the [[close air support]] (CAS) role, the mockup also featured underwing pylons for rockets, bombs, and other stores.\n\nThe Air Force did not like the armament capability of the Mohawk and tried to get it removed. The Marines did not want the sophisticated sensors the Army wanted, so when their Navy sponsors opted to buy a fleet oil tanker, they dropped from the program. The Army continued with armed Mohawks and developed cargo pods that could be dropped from underwing hard points to resupply troops in emergencies.\n\n{{Listen\n| image       = [[File:Crystal Project video camera.png|50px]]\n| help        = no\n| filename    = Overview of SLAR on OV-1D Mohawk.ogv\n| title       = The OV-1 Mohawk's SLAR capabilities\n}}\nThe radar imaging capability of the Mohawk was to prove a significant advance in both peace and war. The [[Side looking airborne radar|Side-Looking Airborne Radar]] (SLAR) could look through foliage and map terrain, presenting the observer with a film image of the earth below only minutes after the area was scanned. In military operations, the image was split in two parts, one showing fixed terrain features, the other spotting moving targets.\n\nThe prototype (''YAO-1AF'') first flew on April 14, 1959. The OV-1 entered production in October 1959.\n\nIn mid-1961, the first Mohawks to serve with U.S. forces overseas were delivered to the [[United States Army Europe|7th Army]] at [[Coleman Army Airfield|Sandhofen Airfield]] near Mannheim, Germany. Before its formal acceptance, the camera-carrying AO-1AF was flown by Ralph Donnell on a tour of 29 European airfields to display it to the U.S. Army field commanders and potential European customers. In addition to their Vietnam and European service, SLAR-equipped Mohawks began operational missions in 1963 patrolling the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]]. Germany and France showed early interest in the Mohawk, and Grumman actually signed a license production agreement with the French manufacturer [[Breguet Aviation]] in exchange for American rights to the [[Breguet Atlantic|Atlantic]] maritime patrol aircraft.\n\nThe very nature of the joint Army/Marine program had forced design compromises, such as [[ejection seat]]s,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ejectionsite.com/ov1seats.htm |title = The Ejection Site: OV-1 Mohawk Ejection Seats}}</ref> that made the aircraft expensive and, sometimes, an openly resisted item in Army budgets. Orders for the OV-1 stopped in Fiscal 1964, and the controversy in the Pentagon over the armed Mohawk peaked with a 1965 directive that prohibited the Army from operating armed fixed-wing aircraft (See the [[Johnson-McConnell agreement of 1966]]). Operational success in Vietnam led to additional Mohawk orders in 1966, and by 1968, five surveillance companies were operating in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe last of the Mohawk versions to enter production was the OV-1D with more powerful [[Lycoming T53|T53-701]] engines, improved avionics, and interchangeable mission pallets that made it possible to switch the aircraft from infrared to SLAR configuration in about an hour. The first four OV-1Ds were prototypes converted from earlier production airframes, and the first flew in 1969. These were followed by 37 new-build aircraft, the last of which was delivered in December 1970.\n\n[[File:OV-1 Mohawk proposed variants diagrams.png|thumb|Proposed variants of the OV-1]]\nOver the years, the mission and the aircraft underwent many changes and roughly 380 were built over all variants. Mohawk variants included the JOV-1 [armed reconnaissance], OV-1A, [visual and photographic], OV-1B [visual, photographic, and side-looking radar (SLAR) pod], the OV-1C [visual, photographic, and infrared], and the OV-1D (SLAR pod and bigger wings), OV-1E [enlarged fuselage for more sensor operators or cargo], EV-1E [special [[Signals intelligence#ELINT|electronic intelligence]] installation] and RV-1E [advanced ELINT reconnaissance]. A four-engined Model 134E with [[tiltwing]]s and tail [[ducted fan]] for control for [[VTOL]] was proposed to the Army but not built. Model 134R was a tandem cockpit version offered to meet the [[North American Rockwell OV-10 Bronco#Light Armed Reconnaissance Aircraft|Light Armed Reconnaissance Aircraft]] (LARA) requirement, but the NA300 was chosen instead becoming the [[North American Rockwell OV-10 Bronco|OV-10]].\n\n==Operational history==\n{{expand section|date=August 2015}}\n\n=== United States Army ===\nThe U.S. Army flew the OV-1 operationally in the [[Vietnam War]], with sixty-five lost to accidents, ground fire, and one shot down by a North Vietnamese fighter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/the-ov-1-mohawk-remembered-firsthand-piloting-the-mohawk-in-vietnam/|title=The OV-1 Mohawk Remembered Firsthand: Piloting the Mohawk in Vietnam|publisher=Defense Media Network|date=24 September 2013|accessdate=15 December 2015}}</ref> The Army also used the aircraft during [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]].\n\nStarting in 1972, the [[Army National Guard]] (ARNG) began to receive the Mohawk, with the ARNG eventually operating thirteen OV-1Bs, twenty-four OV-1Cs, and sixteen OV-1Ds serving with three aviation units in Georgia and Oregon.  The Oregon Army National Guard Unit operating the Mohawk was located at [[McNary Field]] in Oregon, initially as the 1042nd Military Intelligence Company (Aerial Surveillance), then reflagged as the 641st Military Intelligence Battalion (CEWI)(Aerial Exploitation).\n\nU.S. Army OV-1s were retired from Europe in 1992, from Korea in September 1996, and finally in the United States in 1996, superseded by newer systems, newer aircraft, and the evolution of [[reconnaissance satellite]]s. The OV-1 was primarily replaced by the EO-5C, a militarized version of the [[de Havilland Canada Dash 7]] turboprop airliner equipped with a SLAR system, until the U.S. Air Force's [[Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS]] (Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System) aircraft became fully operational.\n\nAs of 2011, [[Alliant Techsystems]] partnered with the Broadbay Group and Mohawk Technologies of Florida in a venture to return an armed, modernized version of the OV-1D to operational use as a [[counter-insurgency aircraft]].  A demonstrator was equipped with a [[Forward looking infrared|FLIR]] Star Safire turret and a ventral, trainable [[M230 chain gun]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Defense Technology International Magazine |date=April 2011 |volume=5 |issue=4) |page=40 |publisher=McGraw-Hill/DTI |location=Washington, D.C. |issn=1935-6269}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://defensetech.org/2010/10/28/old-school-coin-planes-keep-coming-back/ |first=John |last=Reed |title=Old School COIN Planes Keep Coming Back |work=Defensetech |date=2010-10-28}}</ref>\n\n=== Argentine Army ===\n{{expand section|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe [[Argentine Army Aviation]] received twenty-three OV-1 in the 1990s.
