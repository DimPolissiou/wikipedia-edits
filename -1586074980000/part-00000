It follows students at an elite secondary school and their friends. The series stars [[Mar\u00eda Pedraza]], [[Itzan Escamilla]], [[Miguel Bernardeau]], [[Miguel Herr\u00e1n]], [[Jaime Lorente]], [[\u00c1lvaro Rico]], [[Ar\u00f3n Piper]], [[Mina El Hammani]], [[Ester Exp\u00f3sito]], Omar Ayuso, and [[Danna Paola]]. [[Jorge L\u00f3pez (actor)|Jorge L\u00f3pez]], Claudia Salas and [[Georgina Amor\u00f3s]] joined in season 2, and Sergio Momo and Le\u00efti S\u00e8ne, in season 3. Many of the cast previously featured in other Netflix works produced or distributed through its Spain and Latin America body.\n\n''Elite'' explores concepts associated with teen dramas, but also features more progressive issues and other sides to its [[clich\u00e9]]s. These include many diverse sexual themes. Structurally, the series employs a flash-forward plot.\n\n==Premise==\n{{improve|reason=This section could be made into a plot section, rather than the vague premise from pre-release sources|date=April 2020}}\n===Season 1===\nAfter their school collapses, three [[working class]] friends\u2014Samuel ([[Itzan Escamilla]]), Nadia ([[Mina El Hammani]]) and Christian ([[Miguel Herr\u00e1n]])\u2014are given scholarships to Las Encinas, the most exclusive private school in Spain, where the [[elite]] send their kids to study. The scholarships are sponsored by the construction company at fault for the collapse.\n\nAt Las Encinas, the three are initially ostracized by the wealthy students. However, Samuel soon befriends the rebellious Marina ([[Mar\u00eda Pedraza]]), whose corrupt father controls the construction company. At the same time, Nadia becomes close to Marina's charismatic but arrogant brother, Guzm\u00e1n ([[Miguel Bernardeau]]). Guzm\u00e1n's girlfriend, Lu ([[Danna Paola]]), dares him to take Nadia's virginity. Meanwhile, Christian becomes involved in a polyamorous relationship with aristocratic couple Polo ([[\u00c1lvaro Rico]]) and Carla ([[Ester Exp\u00f3sito]]).\n\nOutside Las Encinas, Nadia's [[coming out|closeted]] brother Omar (Omar Ayuso) secretly sells drugs to make enough money to get away from his conservative parents. He soon befriends the son of Las Encinas' principal, Ander (Ar\u00f3n Piper), who is also Guzm\u00e1n and Polo's best friend. Omar and Ander begin a secret relationship. Marina and Samuel begin to date but she also begins an affair with Nano ([[Jaime Lorente]]), Samuel's elder brother who is fresh out of prison and has debts to pay.\n\nAs the school year progresses, their lives intertwine in a clash of lifestyles, resentments, envy, and sexual attraction.\n\nThrough a series of flash-forward scenes of police interrogations, the audience is shown stories of the character's relationships that somehow lead to a murder.\n\n===Season 2===\nAfter the revelation of the murder, the second season deals with these relationships and flash forward scenes are shown to find out about the disappearance of a student and how it is linked to the plot of getting the murderer to pay their price.\n\nChristian's guilty conscience overtakes him as he seeks to confess to the police the circumstances of Marina's death. However, on his way to the police, he is involved in a motorcycle accident where Carla's father pays for his medical treatment to be taken place in Switzerland, eliminating him as a possible witness to the murder.\n\nThree new students Valerio, Rebeka, and Cayetana join the school where each of them have their own dark secrets. They befriend the students in their class where Rebeka forms a close bond with Samuel, Nadia and Omar, while Valerio tries to break up Lu and Guzman, and Cayetana befriends Lu while expressing a romantic interest in Polo. \n\nNadia takes her relationship to the next level with Guzman, where she struggles with her values while staying true to her feelings. Guzman starts taking drugs under the influence of Valerio in order to numb the pain over Marina's death. Omar gets kicked out of his home where he seeks shelter with Ander who is keeping a dark secret of a friend's. Carla and Samuel get involved, however Samuel has an ulterior motive as he suspects Carla to be involved in Marina's death. Nano is imprisoned as he does not have the money to post bail, causing Samuel to partake in illegal activities for Rebeka's mother. Polo attempts suicide to clear his conscience, but eventually learns to live happily, while deteriorating Ander's mental health. Lu decides to expose someone's dirty secret. Guzman suspects that Marina was killed by someone in his inner circle. \n\nThe season is shown through flashbacks where each student is interrogated by the inspector concerning the disappearance of Samuel. It is eventually revealed that the disappearance was staged in order to elicit a confession from the murderers concerning Marina's death.\n\n===Season 3===\nWith the shocking revelation and the breaking tension between students in light of the exposed culprit behind Marina's murder, only one question remains. Will there be another incoming tragedy at Las Encinas?<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://usnewsbox.com/netflix-elite-season-3-release-date-cast-plot-and-much-more-1138 |title=Netflix \u201cElite\u201d Season 3: Release Date, Cast, Plot, And Much More |last=Amazingmanjeet |first=Deepika |date=17 March 2020 |website=US News Box|language=en |url-status=live |access-date=17 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n====Introduced in season one====\n* [[Mar\u00eda Pedraza]] as Marina Nunier Osuna, Guzm\u00e1n's sister and love interest of Nano and Samuel.<ref name=\"characters\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.formulatv.com/series/elite/reparto/ |title=Personajes \u00c9lite.

(genre)|thriller]] [[teen drama]] [[web television]] series created for [[Netflix]] by Carlos Montero and Dar\u00edo Madrona. It follows students at an elite secondary school and their friends. The series stars [[Mar\u00eda Pedraza]], [[Itzan Escamilla]], [[Miguel Bernardeau]], [[Miguel Herr\u00e1n]], [[Jaime Lorente]], [[\u00c1lvaro Rico]], [[Ar\u00f3n Piper]], [[Mina El Hammani]], [[Ester Exp\u00f3sito]], Omar Ayuso, and [[Danna Paola]]. [[Jorge L\u00f3pez (actor)|Jorge L\u00f3pez]], Claudia Salas and [[Georgina Amor\u00f3s]] joined in season 2, and Sergio Momo and Le\u00efti S\u00e8ne, in season 3. Many of the cast previously featured in other Netflix works produced or distributed through its Spain and Latin America body.\n\n''Elite'' explores concepts associated with teen dramas, but also features more progressive issues and other sides to its [[clich\u00e9]]s. These include many diverse sexual themes. Structurally, the series employs a flash-forward plot.\n\n==Premise==\n{{improve|reason=This section could be made into a plot section, rather than the vague premise from pre-release sources|date=April 2020}}\n===Season 1===\nAfter their school collapses, three [[working class]] friends\u2014Samuel ([[Itzan Escamilla]]), Nadia ([[Mina El Hammani]]) and Christian ([[Miguel Herr\u00e1n]])\u2014are given scholarships to Las Encinas, the most exclusive private school in Spain, where the [[elite]] send their kids to study. The scholarships are sponsored by the construction company at fault for the collapse.\n\nAt Las Encinas, the three are initially ostracized by the wealthy students. However, Samuel soon befriends the rebellious Marina ([[Mar\u00eda Pedraza]]), whose corrupt father controls the construction company. At the same time, Nadia becomes close to Marina's charismatic but arrogant brother, Guzm\u00e1n ([[Miguel Bernardeau]]). Guzm\u00e1n's girlfriend, Lu ([[Danna Paola]]), dares him to take Nadia's virginity. Meanwhile, Christian becomes involved in a polyamorous relationship with aristocratic couple Polo ([[\u00c1lvaro Rico]]) and Carla ([[Ester Exp\u00f3sito]]).\n\nOutside Las Encinas, Nadia's [[coming out|closeted]] brother Omar (Omar Ayuso) secretly sells drugs to make enough money to get away from his conservative parents. He soon befriends the son of Las Encinas' principal, Ander (Ar\u00f3n Piper), who is also Guzm\u00e1n and Polo's best friend. Omar and Ander begin a secret relationship. Marina and Samuel begin to date but she also begins an affair with Nano ([[Jaime Lorente]]), Samuel's elder brother who is fresh out of prison and has debts to pay.\n\nAs the school year progresses, their lives intertwine in a clash of lifestyles, resentments, envy, and sexual attraction.\n\nThrough a series of flash-forward scenes of police interrogations, the audience is shown stories of the character's relationships that somehow lead to a murder.\n\n===Season 2===\nAfter the revelation of the murder, the second season deals with these relationships and flash forward scenes are shown to find out about the disappearance of a student and how it is linked to the plot of getting the murderer to pay their price.\n\nChristian's guilty conscience overtakes him as he seeks to confess to the police the circumstances of Marina's death. However, on his way to the police, he is involved in a motorcycle accident where Carla's father pays for his medical treatment to be taken place in Switzerland, eliminating him as a possible witness to the murder.\n\nThree new students Valerio, Rebeka, and Cayetana join the school where each of them have their own dark secrets. They befriend the students in their class where Rebeka forms a close bond with Samuel, Nadia and Omar, while Valerio tries to break up Lu and Guzman, and Cayetana befriends Lu while expressing a romantic interest in Polo. \n\nNadia takes her relationship to the next level with Guzman, where she struggles with her values while staying true to her feelings. Guzman starts taking drugs under the influence of Valerio in order to numb the pain over Marina's death. Omar gets kicked out of his home where he seeks shelter with Ander who is keeping a dark secret of a friend's. Carla and Samuel get involved, however Samuel has an ulterior motive as he suspects Carla to be involved in Marina's death. Nano is imprisoned as he does not have the money to post bail, causing Samuel to partake in illegal activities for Rebeka's mother. Polo attempts suicide to clear his conscience, but eventually learns to live happily, while deteriorating Ander's mental health. Lu decides to expose someone's dirty secret. Guzman suspects that Marina was killed by someone in his inner circle. \n\nThe season is shown through flashbacks where each student is interrogated by the inspector concerning the disappearance of Samuel. It is eventually revealed that the disappearance was staged in order to elicit a confession from the murderers concerning Marina's death.\n\n===Season 3===\nWith the shocking revelation and the breaking tension between students in light of the exposed culprit behind Marina's murder, only one question remains. Will there be another incoming tragedy at Las Encinas?<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://usnewsbox.com/netflix-elite-season-3-release-date-cast-plot-and-much-more-1138 |title=Netflix \u201cElite\u201d Season 3: Release Date, Cast, Plot, And Much More |last=Amazingmanjeet |first=Deepika |date=17 March 2020 |website=US News Box|language=en |url-status=live |access-date=17 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n====Introduced in season one====\n* [[Mar\u00eda Pedraza]] as Marina Nunier Osuna, Guzm\u00e1n's sister and love interest of Nano and Samuel.<ref name=\"characters\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.formulatv.com/series/elite/reparto/ |title=Personajes \u00c9lite.
