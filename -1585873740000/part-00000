During his reign, the Sumerian empire was attacked repeatedly by [[Amorite]]s. As faith in Ibbi-Sin's leadership failed, [[Elam]] declared its independence and began to raid as well.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Thorkild |last=Jacobsen |title=The reign of Ibb\u012b-Suen |journal=Journal of Cuneiform Studies |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=36-47 |year=1953}}</ref>\n\nIbbi-Sin ordered fortifications built at the important cities of <!-- this is not the same link as Ur III --> [[Ur]] and [[Nippur]], but these efforts were not enough to stop the raids or keep the empire unified. Cities throughout Ibbi-Sin's empire fell away from a king who could not protect them, notably [[Isin]] under the Amorite ruler [[Ishbi-Erra]]. Ibbi-Sin was, by the end of his kingship, left with only the city of [[Ur]]. In 1940&nbsp;BCE, the Elamites, along with \"tribesmen from the region of [[Shimashki]] in the Zagros Mountains\"<ref>Stiebing, p. 79</ref> sacked Ur and took Ibbi-Sin captive; he was taken to the city of Elam where he was imprisoned and, at an unknown date, died.\n\n==The success of the Amorite invasion==\nThe Amorites were considered a backward people by Mesopotamian standards; Ibbi-Sin's 17th&nbsp;year was officially named \"Year the Amorites, the powerful south wind who, from the remote past, have not known cities, submitted to Ibbi-Sin the king of Ur.\" However, despite his father Shu-Sin having built a \"wall of Martu\" across Mesopotamia against Amorite incursions, these were penetrated early in Ibbi-Sin's reign.\n\nScholars have suggested that, by the reign of Ibbi-Sin, the empire was already in decline due to long-term drought \u2013 in fact, the same drought that helped to take down the [[Akkadian Empire]] c.&nbsp;2193&nbsp;BCE may have been responsible for the fall of Ur&nbsp;III.\n\n<blockquote>Studies of [[Persian Gulf]] sediments indicate that the stream flow of the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] was very low around 2100\u20132000&nbsp;BCE.

During his reign, the Sumerian empire was attacked repeatedly by [[Amorite]]s. As faith in Ibbi-Sin's leadership failed, [[Elam]] declared its independence and began to raid as well.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Thorkild |last=Jacobsen |title=The reign of Ibb\u012b-Suen |journal=Journal of Cuneiform Studies |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=36-47 |year=1953}}</ref>\n\nIbbi-Sin ordered fortifications built at the important cities of <!-- this is not the same link as Ur III --> [[Ur]] and [[Nippur]], but these efforts were not enough to stop the raids or keep the empire unified. Cities throughout Ibbi-Sin's empire fell away from a king who could not protect them, notably [[Isin]] under the Amorite ruler [[Ishbi-Erra]]. Ibbi-Sin was, by the end of his kingship, left with only the city of [[Ur]]. In 1940&nbsp;BCE, the Elamites, along with \"tribesmen from the region of [[Shimashki]] in the Zagros Mountains\"<ref>Stiebing, p. 79</ref> sacked Ur and took Ibbi-Sin captive; he was taken to the city of Elam where he was imprisoned and, at an unknown date, died.\n\n==The success of the Amorite invasion==\nThe Amorites were considered a backward people by Mesopotamian standards; Ibbi-Sin's 17th&nbsp;year was officially named \"Year the Amorites, the powerful south wind who, from the remote past, have not known cities, submitted to Ibbi-Sin the king of Ur.\" However, despite his father Shu-Sin having built a \"wall of Martu\" across Mesopotamia against Amorite incursions, these were penetrated early in Ibbi-Sin's reign.\n\nScholars have suggested that, by the reign of Ibbi-Sin, the empire was already in decline due to long-term drought \u2013 in fact, the same drought that helped to take down the [[Akkadian Empire]] c.&nbsp;2193&nbsp;BCE may have been responsible for the fall of Ur&nbsp;III.\n\n<blockquote>Studies of [[Persian Gulf]] sediments indicate that the stream flow of the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] was very low around 2100\u20132000&nbsp;BCE.

The experiment was a success, and all the Andean condors were recaptured and re-released in South America.<ref name=\"USFW\"/> California condors were released in 1991 and 1992 in California at ([[Big Sur]], [[Pinnacles National Park]] and [[Bitter Creek National Wildlife Refuge]]) and in 1996 at the [[Vermilion Cliffs]] release site in Arizona near the Grand Canyon.<ref name=\"BirdLife\"/> The Fish and Wildlife Service designated the Arizona condors as an ''experimental, nonessential'' animal so they would not affect land regulations or development as ranchers were concerned they could be charged with an offense if any birds were injured on their property after the release.<ref name=\"NYT 1996-12-10\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/10/science/majestic-species-fate-may-ride-on-wings-of-6-freed-condors.html|title=Majestic Species' Fate May Ride on Wings Of 6 Freed Condors|last=Kopytoff|first=Verne G.|date=1996-12-10|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Though the birth rate remains low in the wild, their numbers are increasing steadily through regular releases of captive-reared adolescents.<ref name=USAToday>{{cite news |title=Condor population reaches 100 in California |author=Weise, Elizabeth |newspaper=USA Today |date=October 7, 2010 |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2010/10/california-california-condor-population-reaches-100/1 |access-date=October 7, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bitter Creek National Wildlife Refuge, California, USA -sign-18Aug2010.jpg|thumb|left|A USFWS sign at [[Bitter Creek National Wildlife Refuge]], California, USA]]\n\n\n===Obstacles to recovery===\nIn modern times, a wide variety of causes have contributed to the condor's decline.

Although other [[#Evolutionary history|fossil members]] are known, it is the only surviving member of the [[genus]] ''Gymnogyps''. The species is listed by the [[IUCN]] as critically endangered.\n\nThe [[plumage]] is black with patches of white on the underside of the wings; the head is largely bald, with skin color ranging from gray on young birds to yellow and bright orange on breeding adults. Its {{convert|3.0|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[wingspan]] is the widest of any North American bird, and its weight of up to {{convert|12|kg|lb|abbr=on}} nearly equals that of the [[trumpeter swan]], the heaviest among native North American bird species.

They cause too much confusion.-->\n==Greg Heffley==\n{{Main article|Greg Heffley}}\n\n'''Gregory \"Greg\" Heffley''' is 12 years old in the first novel. Greg's actions can be antagonistic at times, including terrorizing kids, trying to steal money from a church collection basket,  lying in confession, picking on other students, playing pranks on his best friend, selling falsely advertised \"fitness water,\" and praying for bad stuff to happen to others.He also is a very bad friend. However, he also demonstrates a degree of kindness in some of his actions. He helps his brother with his homework, gets his friend a date for a dance, and forgives his friends. Greg is portrayed by [[Zachary Gordon]] in the first three films, and [[Jason Drucker]] in the fourth film.\n\n==Rowley Jefferson==\n'''Rowley Jefferson''' is Greg's best friend. In the first book, Rowley is an antagonist in Greg's point of view while technically in a [[third-person view]], Greg is the antagonist and Rowley is the protagonist. At the end of ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Third Wheel]]'', Rowley begins dating Abigail Brown, a girl who was originally Greg's date for the [[Valentine's Day]] dance. This plot continues in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Hard Luck]]'', where he ditches Greg for his new girlfriend Abigail. At the end of the book, the couple break up and he becomes friends with Greg again.\n\nRowley has what Greg considers strange interests for his age and gender, such as liking a singer for \"six-year-old girls\" named Joshie and action figures Greg believes are for younger kids. Rowley is also the owner of the [[comic strip]] ''Zoo Wee Mama.''<ref name=\"first book\">{{cite book\n|last= Kinney\n|first= Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|series= ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]''\n|publisher= [[Amulet Books]]\n|year= 2007\n|isbn= 0-8109-9313-9}}</ref>\nRowley claims that Greg had nothing to do with the comic strip in the first book, a rare antagonistic move from him. In the movie series, Rowley is portrayed by [[Robert Capron]] (the first 3 movies) and Owen Asztalos (The Long Haul).\n\n==Frank Heffley==\n'''Frank Heffley''' is Greg's overreactive but well-meaning father. He is interested in U.S. history, and his replica of a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battlefield is a plot point in the series.<ref name=\"second book\">{{cite book\n|last=Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules]]\n|series=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year=2008\n|isbn=\n}}</ref> Frank is edgy around Rowley,<ref name=\"second book\" /> does not appreciate Greg's skill at [[video games]], loathes [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]],<ref name=\"first book\"/> and [[adolescent]]s.<ref name=\"third book\">{{cite book\n|last=Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw]]\n|series=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year=2009\n|isbn= 0-8109-7068-6\n}}</ref> He tries to toughen Greg up and threatens to send him to a [[military academy]] in ''The Last Straw'', although ultimately this does not come to fruition, much to Greg's relief.<ref name=\"third book\" /> However, Greg and Frank grow together in ''Dog Days'', despite a brief period when Frank does not speak to Greg after almost getting arrested.\n\nFrank is addicted to junk food; in ''The Last Straw'', he makes a New Year's Resolution to go on a strict diet, but Greg later catches him in the garage eating brownies.\n\nFrank is portrayed by [[Steve Zahn]] in the first three films of the ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid film series]]''. In ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]]'', he is played by [[Tom Everett Scott]].\n\n==Susan Heffley==\n'''Susan Heffley''' (known as '''Ann Heffley''' in the online version) is the mother of Manny, Gregory, and Rodrick. She is known for being overprotective and spoiling Manny. Gregory is embarrassed often because of her\nIn the first three films, Susan is portrayed by [[Rachael Harris]] and [[Alicia Silverstone]] in the fourth film.\n\n==Manny Heffley==\n'''Manny Heffley''' is Greg's and Rodrick's younger brother, and the youngest of the Heffley family.\nHe is a spoiled kindergardener who is constantly doted on by his mother being than he is early childhood. He makes a great number of demands and throws huge temper tandrums if they are not fulfilled. Among Manny's most well known characteristics are his refusal to be toilet trained and his complete inability to remain in [[Preschool|nursery school]]. He frequently damages Greg's property and uses his age as an excuse for doing so. Whenever they go on vacations, Manny ends up ruining and gets away with it. The excesive coddling he receives from his parents infuriates Greg. He also takes advantage of his overindulgence. It is often implied that his father, Frank is frustrated with babying Manny, especially when it comes to potty training and making his son give up his pacifier. It is revealed in the Third Wheel that Manny has imaginary friends, whom he blames for hus misbehavior. Despite being just a kindergardener and just spoiled attitude,Manny shows signs of actually possessing more intelligence than he appears to have. He surprises his family by his ability to speak Spanish in \"The Long Haul\", but plays this to his advantage by persuading a group of Spanish-Speakers to retrieve their pet pig. He is his grandmother's favorite grandchild, although she denies this. In the three movies based on the first four books, Manny is portrayed by Connor and Owen Fielding. In the movie, \"[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]], Manny also gets a pet pig in \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid:The Long Haul\". He is portrayed by Wyatt and Dylan Walters.  \n\n==Rodrick Heffley==\n'''Rodrick Heffley''' is Greg's lazy and aggressive older brother. He is the drummer in a garage band called \"L\u00f6ded Diper\" (loaded diaper), noted for their substandard [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] concerts and limited musical abilities. Rodrick is not an exception to Frank's notorious distrust of all teenagers. \n\nRodrick is infamous for his stereotypical rebellious nature, feigning illness in ''Rodrick Rules'' so as to be allowed to remain at home to throw a chaotic house party during his parents' absence, only for the evidence to appear in newly developed photographs that are quickly discovered by the boys' parents. He bullies Greg a lot and pulls awful pranks that ruins Greg's and his family's life. Rodrick also possesses incompetent tendencies, as his school assignments are notoriously crude and inadequate. Rodrick also makes numerous idiotic mistakes, such as believing a mini-safe is a microwave and cinnamon bun dough which had exploded all over the car was his brains. His spelling abilities are also poor, and he devotes a lot of time to tormenting Greg. In the books, Rodrick owns and drives a white [[van]], which sports his band's name written in large black letters, on either side of it and lacks any back seats, the reason being that Rodrick needs room for his band equipment. In the movie series, the van is revealed to be a 1996 [[Chevrolet Astro]] [[All-wheel drive|AWD]] van, which also sports a diaper's pin drawn on the rear doors. In ''Rodrick Rules'', Greg is haunted by the fact that Rodrick knows about his most mortifying experience during the summertime. This haunts him when he returns to school. However, his fears are quickly eased after the story becomes distorted to Greg's advantage due to it being passed around by so many people, temporarily boosting his popularity. By the end of the film adaptation of Rodrick Rules, he is much closer to Greg, and his actions to him becomes much less aggressive. This is also shown in the film adaptation of Dog Days when Rodrick thanks Greg for getting him a gig at Heather Hills' Sweet 16. In the first three films in the film series based on the books, Rodrick is played by [[Devon Bostick]]. In the fourth film, ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]]'', Rodrick is played by Charlie Wright.\n\n==Greg's extended family ==\n\n===Gramma===\nGramma is Susan's mother and Greg's maternal grandmother. Gramma is known to drive a car like the Heffleys'. Greg often calls her to his home as a way to avoid his dad's scoldings, since his dad will not do this when she is around. Her favorite grandchild is Manny, although she denies and lies about this.\n\n===  Grandpa Heffley===\nGrandpa is Greg's unpredictable paternal grandfather, who is asked to babysit Rodrick and his brother in ''Rodrick Rules''. He lives in a retirement home called Leisure Towers and enjoys playing games such as \"Gutbusters\" and \"Rummy\", which the two boys find boring. He never watches any real shows on the television; instead he constantly has his television tuned to the [[CCTV]] in the retirement home lobby, which he spends his time watching. In ''Old School'', he moves out of Leisure Towers because the rent is too high and moves in with the Heffleys. Grandpa has a girlfriend named Darlene in the ''Hard Luck'' and broke up with her in ''Old School.'' Grandpa dates online. Grandpa eventually accumulates a large number of girlfriends online, culminating in him accidentally inviting all of them over and throwing a party with them. Greg is his favorite. Grandpa is known for preparing what he calls \"Watercress Salad\", a disgusting dish consisting of cold green beans and cucumbers floating in vinegar. Greg hates Watercress Salad, and Rodrick is aware of this, so he pretends that Greg loves it and puts a large helping onto his plate. It's stated that Grandpa never spent much time with Frank when he was a boy, and they seem to have a poor relationship. Grandpa once accidentally ran over Frank's [[dog]] with his [[car]] and lied to him about it before telling him, expecting a laugh, and constantly criticizes Frank during his stay at the Heffleys' house. He has not been seen since ''Double Down,'' implying that he possibly moved out.\n\n===Joe Heffley===\nJoe Heffley is Frank's brother and Greg's uncle. Frank has a sibling rivalry with Joe due to his actions. When Manny started potty training, Uncle Joe told him to watch out for the \"potty monster\", causing him to fear using the bathroom, forcing Frank to change his diapers for a longer time. Uncle Joe's children call their uncle \"Aunt Fwank\", which Frank swears he told them to do on purpose. Susan thinks it's cute, though. In ''Dog Days'', Greg mentions that he tried to make Uncle Joe convince Frank to get a dog, but that did not work out. He also mentions that Joe's dog, Killer ate most of his birthday cake.\n\n===Joe Heffley's Wife===\nJoe Heffley's wife is a dark-haired woman and Greg's aunt. She appears rarely in the books.\n\n===Joe Heffley's Children===\nJoe Heffley has at least 3 children, who all appear to be a bit older than Manny, and are Greg's cousins. They all call Frank \"Aunt Fwank.\"\n\n===Great-Uncle Charlie===\nCharlie is Nana's brother and Greg's great uncle. He is also Greg's \"secret weapon\" at Christmas, as he asks him to buy him presents that his parents have forbidden him from receiving. However, this backfires as he is usually given the wrong thing. Charlie is a [[bachelor]] and spends his spare money well. Greg says he wants to follow in his footsteps. In ''The Last Straw'', Charlie got Greg a laundry hoop, hinting that he is tired of being Greg's secret weapon at Christmas, as the events that transpired meant that Greg effectively got a chore for Christmas.\n\n===Uncle Cecil===\nCecil is the boys' Step-Cousin Once Removed but is only 3 or 4 years old. He sits at the grown-ups table at family gatherings because Greg's Great Aunt Marcie adopted him and since he's her son, he's allowed to sit at the grown-ups' table. He only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Loretta (n\u00e9e Heffley)===\nLoretta is Greg's great-aunt and the sister of Grandpa, Arthur and Reba. She got a thank you note for some pants she gave Greg at Christmas. She appeared mainly in ''Rodrick Rules'' at the [[Thanksgiving]] dinner. She also appeared a couple of times in the ''Do It Yourself Book'' and ''The Ugly Truth.'' It is implied that Greg and Rodrick dislike her, as they fight over who has to greet her first when she visits.\n\n===Aunt Veronica===\nAunt Veronica is Greg's aunt and Susan's sister. Greg states that she has never been seen in person since he was 3 or 4 years old, probably because being with the family in person really stresses her out, but calls her family members on video chat. When Greg was sitting on the toilet playing games on his new phone (which was actually a hand-me-down from his mother), she accidentally started a video chat with him. This startled him, leading to him dropping the phone into the toilet.. She appears in ''Hard Luck'' multiple times \u2013 often in person \u2013 but on other occasions by video conference on a tablet and the used phone that Susan gave to Greg.\n\n===Terrence===\nTerrence is Frank's second cousin. It is implied that Greg thinks he is stupid. This was suggested when he was explaining that when Terrence was his age, he looked exactly like him, which is true.<ref name=\"fifth book\">{{cite book\n|last= Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Ugly Truth]]\n|series= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year= 2010\n|isbn=\n}}</ref>\n\n===Gammie Heffley===\nGammie is Greg's great-grandmother, and the unofficial head of the Heffley family. She only appears in ''The Ugly Truth'', as a minor character. She also has [[Lego]] building bricks that Susan bought so that her kids had something to do at her house. Gammie is a trickster and knows a lot because of \"experience\". When someone in the family is about 12 or 13 years old she gives them ''The Talk'', which is about how kids should not be hurrying to grow up.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/>\nGammie loves having visitors for dinner. One day she bought a scratch ticket, and matched up two pictures and told all her family members that she had won a lot of money. Everyone was in a big rush to visit her. When they all arrived Frank told Gammie that to win, she had to match up three pictures. When she found this out, she did not really care. She pulled a roast right out of the oven, and Greg figures she got what she really wanted anyway. Gammie is the mother of Grandpa, Arthur, Reba, and Loretta Heffley.\n\nGammie is briefly mentioned by Greg in ''Cabin Fever'' when he says she gave a miniature carousel that held spoons from all over the world to Greg's family five or six years before.\n\n===Reba (n\u00e9e Heffley)===\nReba was Greg's great-aunt. Gammie forgot to give her an invitation at Christmas, but she came anyway. She only appeared in ''The Ugly Truth''. She is stubborn. She and Loretta are identical twins. Reba was the sister of Grandpa, Loretta, and Arthur Heffley.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> In ''Wrecking Ball,'' it was revealed that she died in her sleep, and Greg's family attended someone else's funeral instead of hers by mistake. Greg forgot about Reba at first, until Susan reminded him that she used to send him angry letters for forgetting to send her thank-you notes for his birthday money.\n\n===Gary Heffley===\nGarrison \"Gary\" Heffley is Greg's uncle and has been married four times. In ''The Ugly Truth'' it is revealed that all of his wives divorced him as soon as they found out about his financial situation and job. In ''The Third Wheel'' he comes to live with Greg's family after he discovers his job selling shirts in Boston was a ripoff. Later in the book he is chosen to be the DJ at Greg's [[Valentine's Day]] dance.\n\n====First wife: Linda====\nReason for divorce: Job unappealing for her (Gary was working as a mascot at children's parties).\n\n====Second wife: Charlene====\nReason for divorce: Financial miscommunication (He had $45 in his bank account instead of $45,000, and she didn't find out until their wedding, when it was time to pay the band.)\n\n====Third wife: Lydia====\nReason for divorce: Unknown, possibly because of a tattoo that used to read \"Lydia\" (and was later modified to read \"I am not in love with Lydia anymore\").\n\n====Fourth wife: Sonja====\nLikely reason for divorce: He was only engaged to her by accident when a plane with a banner saying \"MARRY ME SONJA\" flew over the baseball game where he was going to break up with her because he wanted to start dating her sister. Apparently, there was another Sonja at the baseball stadium. Before Gary could say anything, Sonja turned around and said \"YES, YES!\" When they divorced, it was after their wedding when Gary's friend included the story in his speech.<ref name=\"fifth book\" />\n\n===Aunt Dorothy===\nDorothy is Greg's great aunt who always kisses him on the lips. Greg's mom, Susan, says it is rude to wipe off the kisses Dorothy gives him. She is overweight and sometimes passes gas loudly.\n\nShe appears on the \"Have You Ever\" page in the ''Do-It-Yourself Book'' when Greg asks: \"Have you ever been kissed full on the lips by a relative who's older than seventy?\" This probably means she is older than 70 years old, and that she is actually his great-aunt.\n\n===Arthur Heffley===\nArthur Heffley is Greg's great-uncle. He only speaks in grunts or makes random sounds. He never has an actual conversation with anybody, but sometimes Greg tries to respond to him just in case he is trying to communicate. Arthur is the brother of Reba, Grandpa, and Loretta Heffley.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/>\n\n===Great Uncle Bruce===\nGreat Uncle Bruce is Greg's deceased great-uncle. He is a character who is mentioned in ''Cabin Fever'' and ''The Third Wheel.'' Greg is presented with a rather luxurious [[blanket]] as a Christmas gift, only to be repelled by it upon learning that it had formerly belonged to Great Uncle Bruce before his death. In ''The Third Wheel'', Greg uses Great Uncle Bruce's old cologne on Valentine's Day, which ends up attracting some old ladies.\n\n===Byron Heffley===\nByron is Frank's cousin whom Greg is not excited to see<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> because at Gammie's last family meeting, he was sent out to get milk, but hit a pothole halfway home, and got a flat tire. Greg had to get him. He needed supplies, so Greg returned to Gammie's. Because of his muddy shoes, the ladies needed to warn him because he was about to track mud into the house. Unfortunately, he forgot about Byron's tire, and he was not happy when he got to Gammie's.\n\nHe only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Nana Heffley===\nNot much is known about Nana. She is Greg, Rodrick, and Manny's paternal grandmother, mother to Frank, Joe and Gary, and Mother-in-law to Susan. She is Grandpa's wife. It is revealed in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Double Down|Double Down]]'' that she died when Greg was younger and it makes him uncomfortable to think she is \"watching\" him from heaven.\n\nHer first appearance was in ''Double Down'' (and possibly her only appearance).<ref>{{cite book\n\n|last= Kenney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever]]\n|series= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year= 2011\n|isbn=\n}}</ref>\n\n===Aunt Cakey===\nAunt Cakey is Susan's oldest sister and does not like kids. She used to have a dog. Susan never trusts her to babysit Greg.\n\nShe only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Aunt Audra===\nAunt Audra is one of Susan's sisters. She believes in crystal balls and took Greg along with her to see her fortuneteller a few times. Susan thinks Audra is wasting her money. The fortuneteller also told Audra that Meemaw's ring was inside a photo album. It turned out the fortuneteller did not mean it literally.\n\n===Aunt Gretchen===\nAunt Gretchen is Susan's youngest sister. She has two out-of-control twin sons, Malvin and Malcolm. Aunt Gretchen has at least thirty pets. In ''Hard Luck'', her rabbit (which everyone thought was a male but was actually female) has a litter of bunnies, angering Frank. \n\n===Malvin and Malcolm===\nMalvin and Malcolm are Gretchen's two sons. They are out-of-control kids. Once, they played throw and catch with a strong sharp piece of concrete. Malvin had to go to the emergency room to get stitches in his forehead. Malcolm is the wilder. He once got hold of Frank's shaving kit and shaved himself. He also called the police to report Greg's family for running out of ketchup. This results in Frank angrily making them leave.\n\n===Meemaw and Peepaw===\nMeemaw and Peepaw are the parents of Gramma and her two sisters and are the  maternal grandparents of Susan. Their first appearance was in ''Hard Luck''. Peepaw is portrayed as old and batty. Meemaw is dead, while Peepaw is still alive. Meemaw was in charge of putting prizes in the Easter eggs and wore a diamond ring, which was extremely valuable because it had been in her family for three generations. Before she died, she accidentally put her ring in an Easter egg that was found by Greg at the end of the book.\n\nMeemaw appears in [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|the film adaption of ''The Long Haul'']] played by Mimi Gould. Meemaw's birthday results in Susan's \"great Heffley road trip\".\n\n===Gramma's sisters===\nGramma's sisters are the great-aunts of Rodrick, Greg, and Manny. They are the aunt's of Susan Heffley and her sisters.\n\n===Lawrence===\nLawrence is Greg's first cousin once removed who is always traveling, and therefore is unable to make it to family events. He only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Chester \"Remus\" Heffley===\nChester Heffley was Greg's great-grandfather and Gammie Heffley's husband. It was revealed that he died in ''The Ugly Truth''. Greg referred to him as Remus in ''The Do it Yourself Book''.\n\n===Georgia===\nGeorgia is Greg's second cousin who has an extremely loose tooth that she does not want to pull out. She only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Benjy===\nBenjy is Greg's third cousin. He can read chapter books and speak in full sentences. However, he still isn't potty trained. He only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Tony and Patricia===\nTony is Greg's second cousin once removed and Patricia is his wife. They are the parents of Benjy.\n\n===Uncle Larry===\nUncle Larry is supposedly Greg's uncle. Greg is not sure if he is an actual relative, and he thinks someone invited him to a family gathering at some point and that he has been coming ever since. When Audra's fortune teller told her Meemaw's ring was in a photo album, Larry helped realize that the ring was in a plastic egg. This was proved to be true, as it was found in a plastic egg by Greg later on.\n\n===Martina===\nMartina is Susan's cousin who smashed her collarbone at a buffet in Las Vegas, and ended up suing the hotel.\n\n===Gerald===\nGerald is Susan's cousin who lives in California. He lived with Greg's family a few months after Greg was born.\n\n==Rowley's family==\n\n===Robert Jefferson===\n<!--His first name is revealed to be Robert in Dog Days, but since Mrs. Jefferson's first name has not been revealed yet, we should currently keep this as \"Mr. Jefferson\" to keep the balance.-->\nMr. Jefferson is Rowley's father, and is far more shrill than Mr. Heffley. He is extremely rude and paranoid, and does not accept any criticism from anyone of himself or his property. He is the strictest father in the series so far. He will not let Rowley play any video game with the slightest bit of violence or fighting in it, as he thinks doing this could change Rowley into a different person. Mr. Jefferson dislikes Greg, whom he thinks is a \"bad influence\" on his son. It is also shown that Mr. Jefferson had a close bond with Rowley.\n\nHe shows little interest in sports until ''Dog Days'', where he is found playing [[tennis]] with Rowley and [[golf]] with a caddy.\n\nIn ''Dog Days'', it is revealed that Mr. Jefferson's first name is Robert. When Susan emailed him because of the note Greg sent her, it had Mr. Jefferson's first name on it.\n\nIn \"Old School\", he is stuck chaperoning the group of extra kids (which includes Rowley and Greg), much to Greg's dismay. Later, Rowley adds poison ivy to a fire started by him and he has problems breathing on the next morning, which means he and Rowley (Who had spots on his body) would be going back home.\n\nIn the film series, Mr. Jefferson has not spoken until the third film, implying that he is a man of a few words.\n\n===Linda Jefferson===\nMrs. Jefferson is Rowley's mother. She often seems to be concerned about Rowley such as the time he broke his big toe after Greg put one of his dad's dumbbells under a pillow that Rowley kept kicking at Greg's sleepover.<ref name=\"first book\"/> She also had Greg apologize to her for what he did to Rowley. Despite this, Mrs. Jefferson always enjoys Greg's company with Rowley. Although Mrs. Jefferson loves Greg, she does not let him come over because her husband dislikes him. In day 24 of the online version, it is revealed that her first name is Linda from Greg's ''The Boy Whose Family Thinks He's a DOG'' comic.\n\nIn the first film, Rowley's mother is portrayed by [[Kaye Capron]]. In ''Dog Days'', she is portrayed by Bronwen Smith.\n\n===Rowley's Grandpa===\nRowley's 90-year-old maternal grandfather only appears in ''Rodrick Rules''. It is his birthday and he asks for a chocolate cake for his next birthday.\n\n===Bampy Jefferson===\nBampy is Rowley's Paternal Grandfather who first appears in Diary Of an Awesome Friendly Kid and is revealed to be deceased. He owned a log cabin which is now owned by his son.\n===Rowley's uncle===\nRowley's Uncle who lives in China.\n===Rowley's cousins===\nRowley's Cousin's who Rowley brings to his birthday parties.\n\n==Other characters==\n\n===Fregley===\nFregley is Greg's firm and impeccably graspable acquaintance and neighbor noted for his unexplained lot of odd or disgusting eccentricities. He has been known to perplex others with his behavior, and does not have any known friends. Greg has been forced to hang around with Fregley on several occasions, to his chagrin or aggravation. It has been mentioned that Fregley is prohibited from eating [[sugar]] by his parents, and the consumption of it in large quantities will send him into hysterical, uncontrollable frenzies. In the film adaptations of the books, Fregley is played by [[Grayson Russell]].\n\n===Preston Mudd===\nPreston Mudd is one of Greg's classmates. He is said to have been the best player in the basketball unit of gym class during sixth grade at Westmore Middle School. Unfortunately, when his name was displayed as \"P. Mudd\", this led to his classmates making fun of him, calling him \"Pee Mud\".\n\n===Christopher Brownfield===\nChristopher Brownfield is one of Greg's friends and is shown to have been a great mosquito magnet while hanging out with Greg in the summer. However, Greg does not see him as a close friend because he is \"not a school-year friend\". Later in \"The Ugly Truth\", he is on Greg's team for a game and hides behind a soda machine after the teachers threaten to call all of their parents.\n\n===Tyson Sanders===\nTyson Sanders is a friend of Greg who appears in \"The Ugly Truth\". He is mentioned at the beginning along with Christopher when Greg is considering new best friends, and mentions that although Tyson is nice and into the same video games as Greg, he is turned off by the fact Tyson pulls his pants all the way down when using the urinal. When they play a game of \"[[Guess Who?]]\", the team take a picture of Tyson's bent arm, which gets them disqualified as the chaperones think the picture is of his buttocks. However, the misunderstanding is later cleared up after a mole near Tyson's elbow is matched to one shown in the picture.\n\n===Holly Hills===\nHolly Hills is one of Greg's classmates; an older girl who primarily serves as Greg's unrequited romantic interest and also Heather Hills' younger sister. She is the youngest daughter of Mr. Hills and Mrs. Hills. A minor character, she earns a prominent role in ''The Last Straw'' as the object of Greg's most recent infatuation. He is continuously motivated to impress her to no avail. Virtually oblivious to Greg's existence or identity (Greg stops trying to impress her after she mistakes him for Fregley), she appears to take an interest in Rowley's sweetness, judging by an enthusiastic message which she had signed in his yearbook (as opposed to the note that she had written for the envious Greg). She seldom appears afterwards. Greg's interest in her is seemingly damaged by events such as this and he starts showing an interest in other girls, including Holly's older sister Heather.\n\nWhereas her personality is hardly explored in the books, Holly's role was increased in film adaptions, debuting in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules'' as a newcomer to Greg's school with whom he is instantly besotted. She is depicted as being friendly and good-natured. The relationship she shares with Greg and Rowley is emphasized and exaggerated in the film portrayals, to the extent it can be assumed that the feelings Greg has for her may be mutual. She reappears in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days.''\n\nHolly seems to enjoy the boys' companionship, and shows gratitude for Rodrick Heffley's unintentional blunders that wind up destroying the undeserving Heather's birthday party. The party ends with Holly slipping her hand into Greg's, implying that she likes him as well, and she, Greg and Rowley had a pool party not long after.\n\nHolly is portrayed by [[Peyton List (actress, born 1998)|Peyton R. List]].\n\n===Chirag Gupta===\nChirag Gupta is one of Greg's schoolmates and a minor character in the books. He is characterized by his short stature. Although he and Greg are well-acquainted and generally amiable to one another, Greg started the \"Invisible Chirag\" prank in ''Rodrick Rules''. During the summer the Gupta family were to move away but an unexplained alteration in their plans changed this. As a result, Chirag's classmates teasingly ignore his existence or presence for days on end, which aggravates and shocks him. Though Chirag has apparently forgiven Greg and his fellow schoolmates for concocting the prank, it is mentioned in one book that he takes advantage of his family's non-observance of the Christmas holiday, and no obligation to behave for [[Santa Claus]], to pick on Greg.\n\nIn the movie adaptions, Chirag's role is enhanced and he is a close friend of Greg and Rowley. He also plays a considerably more prominent role in these films, appearing in adaptions of books in which he is absent or hardly mentioned. He is depicted as being Indian-American. He is portrayed by [[Karan Brar]].\n\n===Patty Farrell===\n'''Patty Farrell''' is a minor character who shares an intense rivalry with Greg, which is showcased on a few occasions. It is implied she is a hardworking but sanctimonious and domineering student. She earns Greg's animosity after she suggests a map of the United States displayed in the classroom be covered during a geography quiz. Greg had planned to cheat using the map and this causes great difficulties for him, and makes him agitated. Motivated by his lust for revenge, he volunteers to play a tree in the school's upcoming production of \"[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]\"after viewing the movie adaption for the first time. He believes the role entails having to bombard the character of Dorothy Gale (whom Patty would be portraying in the play) with [[apple]]s, only to learn that this scene was deleted for the school production. He winds up re-enacting this scene, despite the script, sending his parents into a rage. She has yet to play quite as significant a role in the book series again. She has become something of a minor recurring character whose appearances are rare.\n\nIn the film adaptions of the books, Patty's role is enhanced slightly. She is depicted as being monstrously demanding. Her parents are involved with the school board in this portrayal. The motivation given for her hatred of Greg is his recital of an offensive playground chant poking fun at her that sent her bursting into tears in elementary school. She appears in the film adaptations of all three films ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'', ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid; Rodrick Rules'' and ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days''. Alterations made to the books include her talent for both wrestling and playing [[tennis]]. She snatches any opportunity to assault Greg somehow while engaged in either sport with him. She is played by [[Laine MacNeil]].\n\n===Heather  Hills===\nHeather Hills is the attractive elder sister of Holly Hills, with whom Rodrick is infatuated. A minor character in the books, but the main antagonist in the third film, Heather is only featured in several books as the object of Greg's unrequited infatuation. However, she seems oblivious to this. A student attending Westmore High School with Rodrick, she has had several minor occupations throughout the course of the books, during each of which Rodrick fecklessly attempts to grab her attention or to impress her.\n\nLittle insight into her personality is provided in the book series. Similar to her younger sister, Holly, Heather's personality and role is further enhanced in the only film adaption in which she has appeared, ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days.'' In a modification of the events of the books, she is depicted as the oldest daughter of the Hills family. She is spoiled, obnoxious, rude, ignorant, selfish, conceited, ungrateful, unforgiving, cold-hearted, demanding, mistreating her family and acquaintances. Lovelorn, Rodrick Heffley and his band are hired to perform at Heather's ostentatious upcoming [[sweet sixteen (birthday)|sixteenth birthday party]], and, in an attempt to earn her admiration, Rodrick winds up messing up the celebration and decorations during a boisterous, and substandard performance of [[Justin Bieber]]'s \"[[Baby (Justin Bieber song)|Baby]]\", which makes Heather very upset and the party ends in disaster. She is portrayed by [[Melissa Roxburgh]].\n\n===Albert Sandy===\nAlbert Sandy is a minor character, who talks often about rumors he has heard. The validity of his statements are unconfirmed. One of the statements which was not confirmed by Greg was when Albert told him that \"it was medically impossible for a girl to fart\". Some make no sense, for example, he said a man got decapitated when he sneezed.\n\nAlbert has appeared in ''The Last Straw,'' ''The Ugly Truth,'' ''Old School,'' ''Double Down,'' ''The Meltdown,'' and ''Wrecking Ball.''\n\n===Mr. Ira===\nOnly appearing in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'', Mr. Ira is a teacher at Greg's school who is on the school newspaper staff, and enlists a replacement comic strip for the newspaper. He was made fun of in a comic strip entitled Dumb Teachers, and later bowdlerised Greg's Creighton the Cretin comic. He does not do the same with Rowley's Zoo-Wee Mama strip, much to Greg's chagrin.\n\n===The Snellas===\nFirst appearing in ''The Last Straw'', The Snellas are a family that lives in the Heffleys' neighborhood. They have a lot of children, all of whom are male, with names beginning with the letter S. Five of the children's names are revealed, and they are (from oldest to youngest): Shawn, Shane, Sam, Scott, and Seth. In ''The Last Straw'', it is revealed that each Snella child has a half birthday party at which the adults perform funny stunts, to attempt to make the babies laugh. According to Greg, however, no baby has laughed once.\n\nMr. Snella then sends the videos to ''America's Funniest Families'', a spoof and parody of ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', and has never won anything (though after Greg is filmed wearing ''Wonder Woman'' underwear hanging off a tree with his trousers below his ankles at the end of ''The Last Straw'', the footage is sent, and it is never explained if Mr. Snella won with it).\n\nTheir most recent appearance was in ''The Ugly Truth'', when they move to another house because of a strange smell they cannot get rid of in their home. The smell was [[deviled eggs]], which Greg hates and threw into one of their plant pots when he was having dinner at their house. Despite trying to find the cause of the smell, the Snellas cannot figure it out and eventually just move. Greg feels guilty when he sees that they are taking the plant pot with them, but he resolves to try to find a way to sneak deviled eggs into Fregley's house.\n\n===Scotty Douglas===\nScotty is a first grader from Rowley's karate class. In ''Rodrick Rules'', Scotty was going to do a magic act in the Talent Show with Rowley as his assistant. But after Greg breaks Rowley's big toe, he has to fill in for Rowley. Greg complains about being a magician's assistant to Scotty, but Susan tells Scotty's mother that Greg would be happy to replace Rowley.\n\nScotty has a remarkably similar appearance to Greg's comic character, Creighton The Cretin, except Creighton's eyes are wide open and Scotty's eyes are beady just like all the other characters that do not wear glasses. In ''The Ugly Truth'', he becomes the new Peachy Breeze kid, yet cannot say the slogan right.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> Between ''Rodrick Rules'' and ''The Ugly Truth'' it appears that Scotty has two siblings - an unnamed baby sister and an older brother. In ''The Third Wheel,'' when Greg and Rowley become private investigators Greg looks through the window at his house to find him playing one of Greg's video games with Rowley.\n\nHe appeared in the film adaptation of Rodrick Rules, with only a few lines. He is portrayed by Jakob Davies.\n\n===Mr. Underwood ===\nMr. Underwood is Greg's Phys Ed coach. In the film series, he is named Coach Malone. He is portrayed by [[Andrew McNee]].\n\n===Bill Walter===\nBill Walter is a 35-year-old high school drop out, guitarist and professional singer, who has a rude attitude towards everyone he meets. Rodrick idolizes him and his lifestyle. In the novel ''Rodrick Rules'', he was voted \"Most Likely to Be a Rock Star\" which influenced Rodrick to persuade him to join the band. Frank Heffley strongly dislikes Bill because he disapproves of his lifestyle, and is afraid Rodrick will follow in his footsteps. In the movie version of ''Rodrick Rules'' he is portrayed by [[Fran Kranz]] and is an antagonist. He agrees to join Rodrick's rock band ''Loded Diper'' and later attempts to kick him out for an unknown reason. After performing the song ''Exploded Diper'', Rodrick retaliates and kicks him out. In the book Greg describes him as unemployed and still living with his parents. Also, in ''Rodrick Rules'' Bill appears to be a slob, as he \"slorks\" pot roast.\n\n===Dr. Salazar Kagan===\nDr. Kagan, Frank's dentist, makes his debut in ''The Ugly Truth''. Frank takes Greg to Dr. Kagan instead of his usual dentist, a pretty woman named Rachel on whom Greg has a crush. Greg bites Dr. Kagan's finger when his teeth are being checked. In what Greg believes to be an act of revenge, Dr. Kagan tells Frank that Greg needs headgear to correct his overbite. Greg says Dr. Kagan is scary and evil and that he never fools around. He has sharp metal tools and never smiles. The billboards for Dr. Kagan's dental practice make Greg freak out every time he sees one of them on the highway.\n\nDr. Kagan later makes a cameo in Double Down, in a scene where Greg describes how a Spineticklers book has made going to the dentist an even more frightening experience for him.\n\n===Lenwood Heath===\nLenwood Heath only appears in ''The Last Straw''. He is a rebellious teenager, who was Greg's father's arch-enemy for about three months before he was sent to military academy. This resulted in him becoming a fine young man who works at the movie theater. In the ''Dog Days'' film, he is portrayed by Tom Stevens, and is seen working as a lifeguard at the community pool the Heffleys go to.\n\n===Taylor Pringle===\nTaylor Pringle is a minor character who only appears in the films, ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules'' and ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days'' and does not appear in the books. She is a very rude little girl, and is first seen at the end of the opening scene in ''Rodrick Rules'' in which during her [[birthday party]] at the [[roller rink]], Rodrick embarrasses Greg, prompting Greg to try and tackle him, but he misses and lands in Taylor's [[birthday cake]], destroying it. As a result of this, Taylor gets angry and she and her friends begin beating up Greg as the intro begins. Later in the film, during church, when Rodrick intentionally pulls down the sweater around Greg's waist to reveal the chocolate stain on Greg's pants, Taylor points it out to everyone, mistaking it for poop. Then, in ''Dog Days'', when Greg attempts to impress Holly by jumping off the [[high diving|high]] [[diving platform|diving board]], he becomes nervous, due to it being very high above the water. Taylor then comes up behind Greg and states that he is talking to himself, due to being scared. When Greg gives Taylor a brush-off that he is not scared and that she would not understand since she is \"just a little kid\", she pressures him to jump. When Greg jumps, he loses his [[swimsuit]] on the board, and Taylor chucks it onto a nearby fence to get back at Greg for brushing her off. As a result, Greg is forced to borrow a girl's swimsuit that reads ''Holly'' on it until he goes to the fence to retrieve his own swimsuit, and as he does so, he gets taunted by Patty. Taylor is portrayed by [[Dalila Bela]].\n\n===Jordan Jury===\nOnly appearing in ''The Ugly Truth'', Jordan Jury is the popular boy in the grade above Greg, who's known for always throwing huge parties that have little to no adult supervision. Greg is amazed when he discovers that he has been given a textbook that used to belong to him. Jordan invites Greg and Rowley to his latest party, but Greg cannot not go because of his Uncle Gary's fourth wedding. But at the end of the book, Greg discovers that it's actually a good thing he didn't go to the party as it would seem. The only reason Jordan invited the kids in Greg and Rowley's grade to his party was to basically use them as servants.\n\n===Angie Steadman===\nAngie Steadman only appears as an additional character in the ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' film. She is in seventh grade, has a pink streak of hair, works for the school newspaper, and hates middle school. In the film, Greg and Rowley meet her under the bleachers during a game of \"Gladiator\". She gets along with Rowley, but starts a rocky relationship with Greg after he egotistically declines her offer to join the school newspaper. Greg later tells the whole school he ate the cheese instead of Rowley and she compliments and accepts him when she sees that Greg is learning the errors of his ways. In the film, she is portrayed by [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]].\n\n===Pete Hosey===\nPete Hosey is the leader of the teenagers who attacked Greg and Rowley on [[Halloween]]. He is an antagonist in the first film. He is unnamed in the first book and he is replaced by Herbie Reamer in the online version. After hassling Greg and Rowley on Halloween, Greg yells that he will call the cops, and they chase him to Greg's grandmother's house. In the book, Greg and Rowley sneak back home, but in the movie, they try to intimidate Pete and his friends with a weed hacker, before Pete scratches his car and they are chased into the woods. In both the book and the movie, the teens hold a vendetta against Greg and Rowley. Near the end they corner them on the school field and decide to force them to eat the moldy cheese. Rowley is forced to eat the cheese, but Greg avoids it by saying he's lactose intolerant. In the movie they are chased off by the coach.\n\n===The Warrens===\nAlthough his family is vaguely referenced in the books, the Warren's are what got Frank thinking of making Greg more manly. In the books, Mr. Warren is Frank's boss. Frank is deeply jealous of the Warrens. In stark contrast to Greg, the Warrens' children are shown to be athletic and sporty. In the third film, Stan, the father of the family, is shown to be a neighbor of the Heffleys. He had a minor childhood rivalry with Frank, that they appear to have gotten over as adults. In the movie, Mr. Warren is the troop master of the Wilderness Explorers, and invites everyone over for an Independence Day party. They only appear in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw]]''.\n\n===The Beardos===\nOnly appearing in ''The Long Haul'', the Beardos are the main antagonists of the book. They are a couple with three sons. The Heffleys indirectly met them during their road trip, though only Greg knows who they are. Their first encounter is at a motel, where Greg angrily berates one of the Beardo children, who then tells his father on him, causing Greg to fear running into them again. Greg and his family are convinced that the Beardos have stolen their luggage and belongings at a place they both attended called \"Soak Central.\" They try to track them down though it was revealed at the end that Greg actually had the key to their locker in Soak Central, and that he got the number in the lottery . Their belongings were actually there. The family's real surname is unknown, as Greg himself does not who they are. It is likely he dubbed them this because of the patriarch's noticeably long beard.\n\nIn the film adaption of ''The Long Haul'', Mr. and Mrs. Beardo are portrayed by [[Chris Coppola]] and Kimberli Lincoln, and have a daughter named Brandi and two sons named Brandon and Brent. The Beardos are depicted as much more malicious, with Mr. Beardo chasing Greg around through the carnival to get revenge.\n\n===Chris=== \nChris is a friend of Rodrick and the [[bassist]] in Loded Diper.\n\n===Joshie===\nJoshie is a singer who is famous in Europe and is Rowley's favorite singer and idol. Greg believes that Joshie is for six-year-old girls, but Rowley ignores him, saying that Greg is jealous because he was the one who \"discovered\" Joshie. However, despite Rowley's opinion, Joshie appears to be a singer that is mainly idolized by females.\n\n===Maddox Selsam===\nMaddox Selsam is a boy who lives in the middle of the woods. He is not allowed to have any screen time, and does not have a TV at his house. He enjoys playing with his Legos and practicing his violin. He met Greg in ''Double Down'' when he found Greg's balloon for the Balloon Brigade at his school.\n==Pets==\n\n===Dogs===\n====Sweetie====\nSweetie is a dog that first appeared in ''Dog Days''. Greg's dad buys him after discovering that his father lied about accidentally killing his childhood dog, Nutty. Sweetie wreaks havoc in the Heffley household and is given to Gramma at the end of the book. Sweetie undergoes drastic weight gain at Gramma's house because he is fed lots of table scraps. Eventually Gramma dresses him up like a little human. Greg and Rodrick like playing with him by going up behind him and making flatulence sounds. He will then sniff his rear end until he goes to sleep.\n\n====Nutty====\nNutty is Frank's old dog which he had when he was around Greg's age. Grandpa accidentally ran over and killed Nutty with his station wagon when he backed out of the driveway. Grandpa covered the truth by saying that Nutty ran away to a butterfly farm. Frank is very angry when he finds out the truth during a Father's Day brunch.\n\n====Killer====\nKiller is Joe Heffley's [[Rottweiler]]-type pet dog. In ''Dog Days'', he wreaks havoc by eating most of Greg's birthday cake, leaving Greg not wanting to eat it.\n\n====Rudy====\nRudy was Aunt Cakey's dog. He was usually oblivious to what was going on around him, opting to stare straight ahead doing nothing. It is not known how Rudy died.\n\n====Henry====\nHenry is Gramma's dog who died around the time of the dog days of summer.\n\n====Rebel====\nRebel is a [[Rottweiler]] that used to chase Greg and Rowley on their way to school before his owner installed an electric fence around the front yard. He only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Fish===\n====Greg's Fish====\nIn ''Dog Days'', Greg buys an angel fish from a pet store. He also buys a journal to log the actions of his fish but later realizes he can not put much in it. Greg's fish was later made to share a tank with Rodrick's fish, who ate it while Greg and his family were at the water park on [[Father's Day]].\n\n====Rodrick's Fish====\nRodrick's fish is a [[piranha]]-type fish that was picked out the fish at a pet store in ''Dog Days,'' because it was described as aggressive. Due to Rodrick's neglect at cleaning the tank it was made to share a tank with Greg's fish, which it ate. The fish has not appeared since ''Dog Days,'' with no further mention of its eventual fate.\n\n===Other Pets===\n====Aunt Gretchen's pets====\nAunt Gretchen has about thirty pets that the Heffleys pet-sit in ''Hard Luck'', while she is on vacation. Her pets include three dogs, two cats, a mouse, a parakeet, a turtle, a snake, a lizard, and a litter of bunnies that her rabbit gave birth to while Gretchen was away (despite the fact that the rabbit was actually male).\n\n====Squirm====\nSquirm was an inchworm Greg found and took care of when he was nine. It was stood on and squashed by Manny when he began learning how to walk.\n\n====The Pig====\nThe Heffleys\u2019 pet pig has appeared in all books except ''The Getaway'' since ''The Long Haul'', in which Manny Heffley won it at a country fair for correctly guessing the weight of a hog. To the annoyance of Greg, the pig exhibits extraordinary intelligence and gains human characteristics. One running gag is that despite not having opposable thumbs, the pig opens objects such as soda cans. In ''The Meltdown'' the Pig throws a tantrum for being excluded from the trip to Isla de Corales in ''The Getaway''. Frank sends it to obedience school, only for the Pig to escape on its second day there. The Pig is never found by the Heffleys despite numerous missing posters, and the pig's fate is left unclear.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Diary of a Wimpy Kid}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Diary of a Wimpy Kid}}\n[[Category:Lists of literary characters]]\n[[Category:Diary of a Wimpy Kid (series)]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{in-universe |date= April 2012}}\n{{primary sources|date=July 2015}}\n}}\n{{Use American English|date=August 2015}}\n\nThis is a list of characters in [[Jeff Kinney (author)|Jeff Kinney]]'s ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]'' graphic novel series, as well as in the film adaptations of the [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film)|first]],<ref name=\"MDN\">{{cite news|url=http://www.milforddailynews.com/news/x2118273676/Nothing-Wimpy-about-local-authors-success |title=Nothing 'Wimpy' about local author's success |last=McCarron |first=Heather |date=October 12, 2009 |publisher=[[Milford Daily News]] |accessdate=October 20, 2009}}</ref> [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules (film)|second]],<ref name=\"Moviefone\">[http://blog.moviefone.com/2010/05/12/diary-of-a-wimpy-kid-rodrick-rules-release-date-march-25-2011 'Diary of a Wimpy Kid' Sequel to Bow Next March] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325214154/http://blog.moviefone.com/2010/05/12/diary-of-a-wimpy-kid-rodrick-rules-release-date-march-25-2011 |date=2012-03-25 }}.

They cause too much confusion.-->\n==Greg Heffley==\n{{Main article|Greg Heffley}}\n\n'''Gregory \"Greg\" Heffley''' is 12 years old in the first novel. Greg's actions can be antagonistic at times, including terrorizing kids, trying to steal money from a church collection basket,  lying in confession, picking on other students, playing pranks on his best friend, selling falsely advertised \"fitness water,\" and praying for bad stuff to happen to others.He also is a very bad friend. However, he also demonstrates a degree of kindness in some of his actions. He helps his brother with his homework, gets his friend a date for a dance, and forgives his friends. Greg is portrayed by [[Zachary Gordon]] in the first three films, and [[Jason Drucker]] in the fourth film.\n\n==Rowley Jefferson==\n'''Rowley Jefferson''' is Greg's best friend. In the first book, Rowley is an antagonist in Greg's point of view while technically in a [[third-person view]], Greg is the antagonist and Rowley is the protagonist. At the end of ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Third Wheel]]'', Rowley begins dating Abigail Brown, a girl who was originally Greg's date for the [[Valentine's Day]] dance. This plot continues in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Hard Luck]]'', where he ditches Greg for his new girlfriend Abigail. At the end of the book, the couple break up and he becomes friends with Greg again.\n\nRowley has what Greg considers strange interests for his age and gender, such as liking a singer for \"six-year-old girls\" named Joshie and action figures Greg believes are for younger kids. Rowley is also the owner of the [[comic strip]] ''Zoo Wee Mama.''<ref name=\"first book\">{{cite book\n|last= Kinney\n|first= Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|series= ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]''\n|publisher= [[Amulet Books]]\n|year= 2007\n|isbn= 0-8109-9313-9}}</ref>\nRowley claims that Greg had nothing to do with the comic strip in the first book, a rare antagonistic move from him. In the movie series, Rowley is portrayed by [[Robert Capron]] (the first 3 movies) and Owen Asztalos (The Long Haul).\n\n==Frank Heffley==\n'''Frank Heffley''' is Greg's overreactive but well-meaning father. He is interested in U.S. history, and his replica of a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battlefield is a plot point in the series.<ref name=\"second book\">{{cite book\n|last=Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules]]\n|series=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year=2008\n|isbn=\n}}</ref> Frank is edgy around Rowley,<ref name=\"second book\" /> does not appreciate Greg's skill at [[video games]], loathes [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]],<ref name=\"first book\"/> and [[adolescent]]s.<ref name=\"third book\">{{cite book\n|last=Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw]]\n|series=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year=2009\n|isbn= 0-8109-7068-6\n}}</ref> He tries to toughen Greg up and threatens to send him to a [[military academy]] in ''The Last Straw'', although ultimately this does not come to fruition, much to Greg's relief.<ref name=\"third book\" /> However, Greg and Frank grow together in ''Dog Days'', despite a brief period when Frank does not speak to Greg after almost getting arrested.\n\nFrank is addicted to junk food; in ''The Last Straw'', he makes a New Year's Resolution to go on a strict diet, but Greg later catches him in the garage eating brownies.\n\nFrank is portrayed by [[Steve Zahn]] in the first three films of the ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid film series]]''. In ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]]'', he is played by [[Tom Everett Scott]].\n\n==Susan Heffley==\nSusan Heffley (known as Ann Heffley in the online version) is the mother of Manny, Gregory, and Rodrick. She is known for being overprotective and spoiling Manny. Gregory is embarrassed often because of her\nIn the first three films, Susan is portrayed by [[Rachael Harris]] and [[Alicia Silverstone]] in the fourth film.\n\n==Manny Heffley==\nManny Heffley is Greg's and Rodrick's younger brother, and the youngest of the Heffley family.\nHe is a spoiled kindergardener who is constantly doted on by his mother being than he is early childhood. He makes a great number of demands and throws huge temper tandrums if they are not fulfilled. Among Manny's most well known characteristics are his refusal to be toilet trained and his complete inability to remain in [[Preschool|nursery school]]. He frequently damages Greg's property and uses his age as an excuse for doing so. Whenever they go on vacations, Manny ends up ruining and gets away with it. The excesive coddling he receives from his parents infuriates Greg. He also takes advantage of his overindulgence. It is often implied that his father, Frank is frustrated with babying Manny, especially when it comes to potty training and making his son give up his pacifier. It is revealed in the Third Wheel that Manny has imaginary friends, whom he blames for hus misbehavior. Despite being just a kindergardener and just spoiled attitude,Manny shows signs of actually possessing more intelligence than he appears to have. He surprises his family by his ability to speak Spanish in \"The Long Haul\", but plays this to his advantage by persuading a group of Spanish-Speakers to retrieve their pet pig. He is his grandmother's favorite grandchild, although she denies this. In the three movies based on the first four books, Manny is portrayed by Connor and Owen Fielding. In the movie, \"[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]], Manny also gets a pet pig in \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid:The Long Haul\". He is portrayed by Wyatt and Dylan Walters.  \n\n==Rodrick Heffley==\n'''Rodrick Heffley''' is Greg's lazy and aggressive older brother. He is the drummer in a garage band called \"L\u00f6ded Diper\" (loaded diaper), noted for their substandard [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] concerts and limited musical abilities. Rodrick is not an exception to Frank's notorious distrust of all teenagers. \n\nRodrick is infamous for his stereotypical rebellious nature, feigning illness in ''Rodrick Rules'' so as to be allowed to remain at home to throw a chaotic house party during his parents' absence, only for the evidence to appear in newly developed photographs that are quickly discovered by the boys' parents. He bullies Greg a lot and pulls awful pranks that ruins Greg's and his family's life. Rodrick also possesses incompetent tendencies, as his school assignments are notoriously crude and inadequate. Rodrick also makes numerous idiotic mistakes, such as believing a mini-safe is a microwave and cinnamon bun dough which had exploded all over the car was his brains. His spelling abilities are also poor, and he devotes a lot of time to tormenting Greg. In the books, Rodrick owns and drives a white [[van]], which sports his band's name written in large black letters, on either side of it and lacks any back seats, the reason being that Rodrick needs room for his band equipment. In the movie series, the van is revealed to be a 1996 [[Chevrolet Astro]] [[All-wheel drive|AWD]] van, which also sports a diaper's pin drawn on the rear doors. In ''Rodrick Rules'', Greg is haunted by the fact that Rodrick knows about his most mortifying experience during the summertime. This haunts him when he returns to school. However, his fears are quickly eased after the story becomes distorted to Greg's advantage due to it being passed around by so many people, temporarily boosting his popularity. By the end of the film adaptation of Rodrick Rules, he is much closer to Greg, and his actions to him becomes much less aggressive. This is also shown in the film adaptation of Dog Days when Rodrick thanks Greg for getting him a gig at Heather Hills' Sweet 16. In the first three films in the film series based on the books, Rodrick is played by [[Devon Bostick]]. In the fourth film, ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]]'', Rodrick is played by Charlie Wright.\n\n==Greg's extended family ==\n\n===Gramma===\nGramma is Susan's mother and Greg's maternal grandmother. Gramma is known to drive a car like the Heffleys'. Greg often calls her to his home as a way to avoid his dad's scoldings, since his dad will not do this when she is around. Her favorite grandchild is Manny, although she denies and lies about this.\n\n===  Grandpa Heffley===\nGrandpa is Greg's unpredictable paternal grandfather, who is asked to babysit Rodrick and his brother in ''Rodrick Rules''. He lives in a retirement home called Leisure Towers and enjoys playing games such as \"Gutbusters\" and \"Rummy\", which the two boys find boring. He never watches any real shows on the television; instead he constantly has his television tuned to the [[CCTV]] in the retirement home lobby, which he spends his time watching. In ''Old School'', he moves out of Leisure Towers because the rent is too high and moves in with the Heffleys. Grandpa has a girlfriend named Darlene in the ''Hard Luck'' and broke up with her in ''Old School.'' Grandpa dates online. Grandpa eventually accumulates a large number of girlfriends online, culminating in him accidentally inviting all of them over and throwing a party with them. Greg is his favorite. Grandpa is known for preparing what he calls \"Watercress Salad\", a disgusting dish consisting of cold green beans and cucumbers floating in vinegar. Greg hates Watercress Salad, and Rodrick is aware of this, so he pretends that Greg loves it and puts a large helping onto his plate. It's stated that Grandpa never spent much time with Frank when he was a boy, and they seem to have a poor relationship. Grandpa once accidentally ran over Frank's [[dog]] with his [[car]] and lied to him about it before telling him, expecting a laugh, and constantly criticizes Frank during his stay at the Heffleys' house. He has not been seen since ''Double Down,'' implying that he possibly moved out.\n\n===Joe Heffley===\nJoe Heffley is Frank's brother and Greg's uncle. Frank has a sibling rivalry with Joe due to his actions. When Manny started potty training, Uncle Joe told him to watch out for the \"potty monster\", causing him to fear using the bathroom, forcing Frank to change his diapers for a longer time. Uncle Joe's children call their uncle \"Aunt Fwank\", which Frank swears he told them to do on purpose. Susan thinks it's cute, though. In ''Dog Days'', Greg mentions that he tried to make Uncle Joe convince Frank to get a dog, but that did not work out. He also mentions that Joe's dog, Killer ate most of his birthday cake.\n\n===Joe Heffley's Wife===\nJoe Heffley's wife is a dark-haired woman and Greg's aunt. She appears rarely in the books.\n\n===Joe Heffley's Children===\nJoe Heffley has at least 3 children, who all appear to be a bit older than Manny, and are Greg's cousins. They all call Frank \"Aunt Fwank.\"\n\n===Great-Uncle Charlie===\nCharlie is Nana's brother and Greg's great uncle. He is also Greg's \"secret weapon\" at Christmas, as he asks him to buy him presents that his parents have forbidden him from receiving. However, this backfires as he is usually given the wrong thing. Charlie is a [[bachelor]] and spends his spare money well. Greg says he wants to follow in his footsteps. In ''The Last Straw'', Charlie got Greg a laundry hoop, hinting that he is tired of being Greg's secret weapon at Christmas, as the events that transpired meant that Greg effectively got a chore for Christmas.\n\n===Uncle Cecil===\nCecil is the boys' Step-Cousin Once Removed but is only 3 or 4 years old. He sits at the grown-ups table at family gatherings because Greg's Great Aunt Marcie adopted him and since he's her son, he's allowed to sit at the grown-ups' table. He only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Loretta (n\u00e9e Heffley)===\nLoretta is Greg's great-aunt and the sister of Grandpa, Arthur and Reba. She got a thank you note for some pants she gave Greg at Christmas. She appeared mainly in ''Rodrick Rules'' at the [[Thanksgiving]] dinner. She also appeared a couple of times in the ''Do It Yourself Book'' and ''The Ugly Truth.'' It is implied that Greg and Rodrick dislike her, as they fight over who has to greet her first when she visits.\n\n===Aunt Veronica===\nAunt Veronica is Greg's aunt and Susan's sister. Greg states that she has never been seen in person since he was 3 or 4 years old, probably because being with the family in person really stresses her out, but calls her family members on video chat. When Greg was sitting on the toilet playing games on his new phone (which was actually a hand-me-down from his mother), she accidentally started a video chat with him. This startled him, leading to him dropping the phone into the toilet.. She appears in ''Hard Luck'' multiple times \u2013 often in person \u2013 but on other occasions by video conference on a tablet and the used phone that Susan gave to Greg.\n\n===Terrence===\nTerrence is Frank's second cousin. It is implied that Greg thinks he is stupid. This was suggested when he was explaining that when Terrence was his age, he looked exactly like him, which is true.<ref name=\"fifth book\">{{cite book\n|last= Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Ugly Truth]]\n|series= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year= 2010\n|isbn=\n}}</ref>\n\n===Gammie Heffley===\nGammie is Greg's great-grandmother, and the unofficial head of the Heffley family. She only appears in ''The Ugly Truth'', as a minor character. She also has [[Lego]] building bricks that Susan bought so that her kids had something to do at her house. Gammie is a trickster and knows a lot because of \"experience\". When someone in the family is about 12 or 13 years old she gives them ''The Talk'', which is about how kids should not be hurrying to grow up.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/>\nGammie loves having visitors for dinner. One day she bought a scratch ticket, and matched up two pictures and told all her family members that she had won a lot of money. Everyone was in a big rush to visit her. When they all arrived Frank told Gammie that to win, she had to match up three pictures. When she found this out, she did not really care. She pulled a roast right out of the oven, and Greg figures she got what she really wanted anyway. Gammie is the mother of Grandpa, Arthur, Reba, and Loretta Heffley.\n\nGammie is briefly mentioned by Greg in ''Cabin Fever'' when he says she gave a miniature carousel that held spoons from all over the world to Greg's family five or six years before.\n\n===Reba (n\u00e9e Heffley)===\nReba was Greg's great-aunt. Gammie forgot to give her an invitation at Christmas, but she came anyway. She only appeared in ''The Ugly Truth''. She is stubborn. She and Loretta are identical twins. Reba was the sister of Grandpa, Loretta, and Arthur Heffley.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> In ''Wrecking Ball,'' it was revealed that she died in her sleep, and Greg's family attended someone else's funeral instead of hers by mistake. Greg forgot about Reba at first, until Susan reminded him that she used to send him angry letters for forgetting to send her thank-you notes for his birthday money.\n\n===Gary Heffley===\nGarrison \"Gary\" Heffley is Greg's uncle and has been married four times. In ''The Ugly Truth'' it is revealed that all of his wives divorced him as soon as they found out about his financial situation and job. In ''The Third Wheel'' he comes to live with Greg's family after he discovers his job selling shirts in Boston was a ripoff. Later in the book he is chosen to be the DJ at Greg's [[Valentine's Day]] dance.\n\n====First wife: Linda====\nReason for divorce: Job unappealing for her (Gary was working as a mascot at children's parties).\n\n====Second wife: Charlene====\nReason for divorce: Financial miscommunication (He had $45 in his bank account instead of $45,000, and she didn't find out until their wedding, when it was time to pay the band.)\n\n====Third wife: Lydia====\nReason for divorce: Unknown, possibly because of a tattoo that used to read \"Lydia\" (and was later modified to read \"I am not in love with Lydia anymore\").\n\n====Fourth wife: Sonja====\nLikely reason for divorce: He was only engaged to her by accident when a plane with a banner saying \"MARRY ME SONJA\" flew over the baseball game where he was going to break up with her because he wanted to start dating her sister. Apparently, there was another Sonja at the baseball stadium. Before Gary could say anything, Sonja turned around and said \"YES, YES!\" When they divorced, it was after their wedding when Gary's friend included the story in his speech.<ref name=\"fifth book\" />\n\n===Aunt Dorothy===\nDorothy is Greg's great aunt who always kisses him on the lips. Greg's mom, Susan, says it is rude to wipe off the kisses Dorothy gives him. She is overweight and sometimes passes gas loudly.\n\nShe appears on the \"Have You Ever\" page in the ''Do-It-Yourself Book'' when Greg asks: \"Have you ever been kissed full on the lips by a relative who's older than seventy?\" This probably means she is older than 70 years old, and that she is actually his great-aunt.\n\n===Arthur Heffley===\nArthur Heffley is Greg's great-uncle. He only speaks in grunts or makes random sounds. He never has an actual conversation with anybody, but sometimes Greg tries to respond to him just in case he is trying to communicate. Arthur is the brother of Reba, Grandpa, and Loretta Heffley.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/>\n\n===Great Uncle Bruce===\nGreat Uncle Bruce is Greg's deceased great-uncle. He is a character who is mentioned in ''Cabin Fever'' and ''The Third Wheel.'' Greg is presented with a rather luxurious [[blanket]] as a Christmas gift, only to be repelled by it upon learning that it had formerly belonged to Great Uncle Bruce before his death. In ''The Third Wheel'', Greg uses Great Uncle Bruce's old cologne on Valentine's Day, which ends up attracting some old ladies.\n\n===Byron Heffley===\nByron is Frank's cousin whom Greg is not excited to see<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> because at Gammie's last family meeting, he was sent out to get milk, but hit a pothole halfway home, and got a flat tire. Greg had to get him. He needed supplies, so Greg returned to Gammie's. Because of his muddy shoes, the ladies needed to warn him because he was about to track mud into the house. Unfortunately, he forgot about Byron's tire, and he was not happy when he got to Gammie's.\n\nHe only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Nana Heffley===\nNot much is known about Nana. She is Greg, Rodrick, and Manny's paternal grandmother, mother to Frank, Joe and Gary, and Mother-in-law to Susan. She is Grandpa's wife. It is revealed in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Double Down|Double Down]]'' that she died when Greg was younger and it makes him uncomfortable to think she is \"watching\" him from heaven.\n\nHer first appearance was in ''Double Down'' (and possibly her only appearance).<ref>{{cite book\n\n|last= Kenney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever]]\n|series= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year= 2011\n|isbn=\n}}</ref>\n\n===Aunt Cakey===\nAunt Cakey is Susan's oldest sister and does not like kids. She used to have a dog. Susan never trusts her to babysit Greg.\n\nShe only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Aunt Audra===\nAunt Audra is one of Susan's sisters. She believes in crystal balls and took Greg along with her to see her fortuneteller a few times. Susan thinks Audra is wasting her money. The fortuneteller also told Audra that Meemaw's ring was inside a photo album. It turned out the fortuneteller did not mean it literally.\n\n===Aunt Gretchen===\nAunt Gretchen is Susan's youngest sister. She has two out-of-control twin sons, Malvin and Malcolm. Aunt Gretchen has at least thirty pets. In ''Hard Luck'', her rabbit (which everyone thought was a male but was actually female) has a litter of bunnies, angering Frank. \n\n===Malvin and Malcolm===\nMalvin and Malcolm are Gretchen's two sons. They are out-of-control kids. Once, they played throw and catch with a strong sharp piece of concrete. Malvin had to go to the emergency room to get stitches in his forehead. Malcolm is the wilder. He once got hold of Frank's shaving kit and shaved himself. He also called the police to report Greg's family for running out of ketchup. This results in Frank angrily making them leave.\n\n===Meemaw and Peepaw===\nMeemaw and Peepaw are the parents of Gramma and her two sisters and are the  maternal grandparents of Susan. Their first appearance was in ''Hard Luck''. Peepaw is portrayed as old and batty. Meemaw is dead, while Peepaw is still alive. Meemaw was in charge of putting prizes in the Easter eggs and wore a diamond ring, which was extremely valuable because it had been in her family for three generations. Before she died, she accidentally put her ring in an Easter egg that was found by Greg at the end of the book.\n\nMeemaw appears in [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|the film adaption of ''The Long Haul'']] played by Mimi Gould. Meemaw's birthday results in Susan's \"great Heffley road trip\".\n\n===Gramma's sisters===\nGramma's sisters are the great-aunts of Rodrick, Greg, and Manny. They are the aunt's of Susan Heffley and her sisters.\n\n===Lawrence===\nLawrence is Greg's first cousin once removed who is always traveling, and therefore is unable to make it to family events. He only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Chester \"Remus\" Heffley===\nChester Heffley was Greg's great-grandfather and Gammie Heffley's husband. It was revealed that he died in ''The Ugly Truth''. Greg referred to him as Remus in ''The Do it Yourself Book''.\n\n===Georgia===\nGeorgia is Greg's second cousin who has an extremely loose tooth that she does not want to pull out. She only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Benjy===\nBenjy is Greg's third cousin. He can read chapter books and speak in full sentences. However, he still isn't potty trained. He only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Tony and Patricia===\nTony is Greg's second cousin once removed and Patricia is his wife. They are the parents of Benjy.\n\n===Uncle Larry===\nUncle Larry is supposedly Greg's uncle. Greg is not sure if he is an actual relative, and he thinks someone invited him to a family gathering at some point and that he has been coming ever since. When Audra's fortune teller told her Meemaw's ring was in a photo album, Larry helped realize that the ring was in a plastic egg. This was proved to be true, as it was found in a plastic egg by Greg later on.\n\n===Martina===\nMartina is Susan's cousin who smashed her collarbone at a buffet in Las Vegas, and ended up suing the hotel.\n\n===Gerald===\nGerald is Susan's cousin who lives in California. He lived with Greg's family a few months after Greg was born.\n\n==Rowley's family==\n\n===Robert Jefferson===\n<!--His first name is revealed to be Robert in Dog Days, but since Mrs. Jefferson's first name has not been revealed yet, we should currently keep this as \"Mr. Jefferson\" to keep the balance.-->\nMr. Jefferson is Rowley's father, and is far more shrill than Mr. Heffley. He is extremely rude and paranoid, and does not accept any criticism from anyone of himself or his property. He is the strictest father in the series so far. He will not let Rowley play any video game with the slightest bit of violence or fighting in it, as he thinks doing this could change Rowley into a different person. Mr. Jefferson dislikes Greg, whom he thinks is a \"bad influence\" on his son. It is also shown that Mr. Jefferson had a close bond with Rowley.\n\nHe shows little interest in sports until ''Dog Days'', where he is found playing [[tennis]] with Rowley and [[golf]] with a caddy.\n\nIn ''Dog Days'', it is revealed that Mr. Jefferson's first name is Robert. When Susan emailed him because of the note Greg sent her, it had Mr. Jefferson's first name on it.\n\nIn \"Old School\", he is stuck chaperoning the group of extra kids (which includes Rowley and Greg), much to Greg's dismay. Later, Rowley adds poison ivy to a fire started by him and he has problems breathing on the next morning, which means he and Rowley (Who had spots on his body) would be going back home.\n\nIn the film series, Mr. Jefferson has not spoken until the third film, implying that he is a man of a few words.\n\n===Linda Jefferson===\nMrs. Jefferson is Rowley's mother. She often seems to be concerned about Rowley such as the time he broke his big toe after Greg put one of his dad's dumbbells under a pillow that Rowley kept kicking at Greg's sleepover.<ref name=\"first book\"/> She also had Greg apologize to her for what he did to Rowley. Despite this, Mrs. Jefferson always enjoys Greg's company with Rowley. Although Mrs. Jefferson loves Greg, she does not let him come over because her husband dislikes him. In day 24 of the online version, it is revealed that her first name is Linda from Greg's ''The Boy Whose Family Thinks He's a DOG'' comic.\n\nIn the first film, Rowley's mother is portrayed by [[Kaye Capron]]. In ''Dog Days'', she is portrayed by Bronwen Smith.\n\n===Rowley's Grandpa===\nRowley's 90-year-old maternal grandfather only appears in ''Rodrick Rules''. It is his birthday and he asks for a chocolate cake for his next birthday.\n\n===Bampy Jefferson===\nBampy is Rowley's Paternal Grandfather who first appears in Diary Of an Awesome Friendly Kid and is revealed to be deceased. He owned a log cabin which is now owned by his son.\n===Rowley's uncle===\nRowley's Uncle who lives in China.\n===Rowley's cousins===\nRowley's Cousin's who Rowley brings to his birthday parties.\n\n==Other characters==\n\n===Fregley===\nFregley is Greg's firm and impeccably graspable acquaintance and neighbor noted for his unexplained lot of odd or disgusting eccentricities. He has been known to perplex others with his behavior, and does not have any known friends. Greg has been forced to hang around with Fregley on several occasions, to his chagrin or aggravation. It has been mentioned that Fregley is prohibited from eating [[sugar]] by his parents, and the consumption of it in large quantities will send him into hysterical, uncontrollable frenzies. In the film adaptations of the books, Fregley is played by [[Grayson Russell]].\n\n===Preston Mudd===\nPreston Mudd is one of Greg's classmates. He is said to have been the best player in the basketball unit of gym class during sixth grade at Westmore Middle School. Unfortunately, when his name was displayed as \"P. Mudd\", this led to his classmates making fun of him, calling him \"Pee Mud\".\n\n===Christopher Brownfield===\nChristopher Brownfield is one of Greg's friends and is shown to have been a great mosquito magnet while hanging out with Greg in the summer. However, Greg does not see him as a close friend because he is \"not a school-year friend\". Later in \"The Ugly Truth\", he is on Greg's team for a game and hides behind a soda machine after the teachers threaten to call all of their parents.\n\n===Tyson Sanders===\nTyson Sanders is a friend of Greg who appears in \"The Ugly Truth\". He is mentioned at the beginning along with Christopher when Greg is considering new best friends, and mentions that although Tyson is nice and into the same video games as Greg, he is turned off by the fact Tyson pulls his pants all the way down when using the urinal. When they play a game of \"[[Guess Who?]]\", the team take a picture of Tyson's bent arm, which gets them disqualified as the chaperones think the picture is of his buttocks. However, the misunderstanding is later cleared up after a mole near Tyson's elbow is matched to one shown in the picture.\n\n===Holly Hills===\nHolly Hills is one of Greg's classmates; an older girl who primarily serves as Greg's unrequited romantic interest and also Heather Hills' younger sister. She is the youngest daughter of Mr. Hills and Mrs. Hills. A minor character, she earns a prominent role in ''The Last Straw'' as the object of Greg's most recent infatuation. He is continuously motivated to impress her to no avail. Virtually oblivious to Greg's existence or identity (Greg stops trying to impress her after she mistakes him for Fregley), she appears to take an interest in Rowley's sweetness, judging by an enthusiastic message which she had signed in his yearbook (as opposed to the note that she had written for the envious Greg). She seldom appears afterwards. Greg's interest in her is seemingly damaged by events such as this and he starts showing an interest in other girls, including Holly's older sister Heather.\n\nWhereas her personality is hardly explored in the books, Holly's role was increased in film adaptions, debuting in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules'' as a newcomer to Greg's school with whom he is instantly besotted. She is depicted as being friendly and good-natured. The relationship she shares with Greg and Rowley is emphasized and exaggerated in the film portrayals, to the extent it can be assumed that the feelings Greg has for her may be mutual. She reappears in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days.''\n\nHolly seems to enjoy the boys' companionship, and shows gratitude for Rodrick Heffley's unintentional blunders that wind up destroying the undeserving Heather's birthday party. The party ends with Holly slipping her hand into Greg's, implying that she likes him as well, and she, Greg and Rowley had a pool party not long after.\n\nHolly is portrayed by [[Peyton List (actress, born 1998)|Peyton R. List]].\n\n===Chirag Gupta===\nChirag Gupta is one of Greg's schoolmates and a minor character in the books. He is characterized by his short stature. Although he and Greg are well-acquainted and generally amiable to one another, Greg started the \"Invisible Chirag\" prank in ''Rodrick Rules''. During the summer the Gupta family were to move away but an unexplained alteration in their plans changed this. As a result, Chirag's classmates teasingly ignore his existence or presence for days on end, which aggravates and shocks him. Though Chirag has apparently forgiven Greg and his fellow schoolmates for concocting the prank, it is mentioned in one book that he takes advantage of his family's non-observance of the Christmas holiday, and no obligation to behave for [[Santa Claus]], to pick on Greg.\n\nIn the movie adaptions, Chirag's role is enhanced and he is a close friend of Greg and Rowley. He also plays a considerably more prominent role in these films, appearing in adaptions of books in which he is absent or hardly mentioned. He is depicted as being Indian-American. He is portrayed by [[Karan Brar]].\n\n===Patty Farrell===\n'''Patty Farrell''' is a minor character who shares an intense rivalry with Greg, which is showcased on a few occasions. It is implied she is a hardworking but sanctimonious and domineering student. She earns Greg's animosity after she suggests a map of the United States displayed in the classroom be covered during a geography quiz. Greg had planned to cheat using the map and this causes great difficulties for him, and makes him agitated. Motivated by his lust for revenge, he volunteers to play a tree in the school's upcoming production of \"[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]\"after viewing the movie adaption for the first time. He believes the role entails having to bombard the character of Dorothy Gale (whom Patty would be portraying in the play) with [[apple]]s, only to learn that this scene was deleted for the school production. He winds up re-enacting this scene, despite the script, sending his parents into a rage. She has yet to play quite as significant a role in the book series again. She has become something of a minor recurring character whose appearances are rare.\n\nIn the film adaptions of the books, Patty's role is enhanced slightly. She is depicted as being monstrously demanding. Her parents are involved with the school board in this portrayal. The motivation given for her hatred of Greg is his recital of an offensive playground chant poking fun at her that sent her bursting into tears in elementary school. She appears in the film adaptations of all three films ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'', ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid; Rodrick Rules'' and ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days''. Alterations made to the books include her talent for both wrestling and playing [[tennis]]. She snatches any opportunity to assault Greg somehow while engaged in either sport with him. She is played by [[Laine MacNeil]].\n\n===Heather  Hills===\nHeather Hills is the attractive elder sister of Holly Hills, with whom Rodrick is infatuated. A minor character in the books, but the main antagonist in the third film, Heather is only featured in several books as the object of Greg's unrequited infatuation. However, she seems oblivious to this. A student attending Westmore High School with Rodrick, she has had several minor occupations throughout the course of the books, during each of which Rodrick fecklessly attempts to grab her attention or to impress her.\n\nLittle insight into her personality is provided in the book series. Similar to her younger sister, Holly, Heather's personality and role is further enhanced in the only film adaption in which she has appeared, ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days.'' In a modification of the events of the books, she is depicted as the oldest daughter of the Hills family. She is spoiled, obnoxious, rude, ignorant, selfish, conceited, ungrateful, unforgiving, cold-hearted, demanding, mistreating her family and acquaintances. Lovelorn, Rodrick Heffley and his band are hired to perform at Heather's ostentatious upcoming [[sweet sixteen (birthday)|sixteenth birthday party]], and, in an attempt to earn her admiration, Rodrick winds up messing up the celebration and decorations during a boisterous, and substandard performance of [[Justin Bieber]]'s \"[[Baby (Justin Bieber song)|Baby]]\", which makes Heather very upset and the party ends in disaster. She is portrayed by [[Melissa Roxburgh]].\n\n===Albert Sandy===\nAlbert Sandy is a minor character, who talks often about rumors he has heard. The validity of his statements are unconfirmed. One of the statements which was not confirmed by Greg was when Albert told him that \"it was medically impossible for a girl to fart\". Some make no sense, for example, he said a man got decapitated when he sneezed.\n\nAlbert has appeared in ''The Last Straw,'' ''The Ugly Truth,'' ''Old School,'' ''Double Down,'' ''The Meltdown,'' and ''Wrecking Ball.''\n\n===Mr. Ira===\nOnly appearing in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'', Mr. Ira is a teacher at Greg's school who is on the school newspaper staff, and enlists a replacement comic strip for the newspaper. He was made fun of in a comic strip entitled Dumb Teachers, and later bowdlerised Greg's Creighton the Cretin comic. He does not do the same with Rowley's Zoo-Wee Mama strip, much to Greg's chagrin.\n\n===The Snellas===\nFirst appearing in ''The Last Straw'', The Snellas are a family that lives in the Heffleys' neighborhood. They have a lot of children, all of whom are male, with names beginning with the letter S. Five of the children's names are revealed, and they are (from oldest to youngest): Shawn, Shane, Sam, Scott, and Seth. In ''The Last Straw'', it is revealed that each Snella child has a half birthday party at which the adults perform funny stunts, to attempt to make the babies laugh. According to Greg, however, no baby has laughed once.\n\nMr. Snella then sends the videos to ''America's Funniest Families'', a spoof and parody of ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', and has never won anything (though after Greg is filmed wearing ''Wonder Woman'' underwear hanging off a tree with his trousers below his ankles at the end of ''The Last Straw'', the footage is sent, and it is never explained if Mr. Snella won with it).\n\nTheir most recent appearance was in ''The Ugly Truth'', when they move to another house because of a strange smell they cannot get rid of in their home. The smell was [[deviled eggs]], which Greg hates and threw into one of their plant pots when he was having dinner at their house. Despite trying to find the cause of the smell, the Snellas cannot figure it out and eventually just move. Greg feels guilty when he sees that they are taking the plant pot with them, but he resolves to try to find a way to sneak deviled eggs into Fregley's house.\n\n===Scotty Douglas===\nScotty is a first grader from Rowley's karate class. In ''Rodrick Rules'', Scotty was going to do a magic act in the Talent Show with Rowley as his assistant. But after Greg breaks Rowley's big toe, he has to fill in for Rowley. Greg complains about being a magician's assistant to Scotty, but Susan tells Scotty's mother that Greg would be happy to replace Rowley.\n\nScotty has a remarkably similar appearance to Greg's comic character, Creighton The Cretin, except Creighton's eyes are wide open and Scotty's eyes are beady just like all the other characters that do not wear glasses. In ''The Ugly Truth'', he becomes the new Peachy Breeze kid, yet cannot say the slogan right.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> Between ''Rodrick Rules'' and ''The Ugly Truth'' it appears that Scotty has two siblings - an unnamed baby sister and an older brother. In ''The Third Wheel,'' when Greg and Rowley become private investigators Greg looks through the window at his house to find him playing one of Greg's video games with Rowley.\n\nHe appeared in the film adaptation of Rodrick Rules, with only a few lines. He is portrayed by Jakob Davies.\n\n===Mr. Underwood ===\nMr. Underwood is Greg's Phys Ed coach. In the film series, he is named Coach Malone. He is portrayed by [[Andrew McNee]].\n\n===Bill Walter===\nBill Walter is a 35-year-old high school drop out, guitarist and professional singer, who has a rude attitude towards everyone he meets. Rodrick idolizes him and his lifestyle. In the novel ''Rodrick Rules'', he was voted \"Most Likely to Be a Rock Star\" which influenced Rodrick to persuade him to join the band. Frank Heffley strongly dislikes Bill because he disapproves of his lifestyle, and is afraid Rodrick will follow in his footsteps. In the movie version of ''Rodrick Rules'' he is portrayed by [[Fran Kranz]] and is an antagonist. He agrees to join Rodrick's rock band ''Loded Diper'' and later attempts to kick him out for an unknown reason. After performing the song ''Exploded Diper'', Rodrick retaliates and kicks him out. In the book Greg describes him as unemployed and still living with his parents. Also, in ''Rodrick Rules'' Bill appears to be a slob, as he \"slorks\" pot roast.\n\n===Dr. Salazar Kagan===\nDr. Kagan, Frank's dentist, makes his debut in ''The Ugly Truth''. Frank takes Greg to Dr. Kagan instead of his usual dentist, a pretty woman named Rachel on whom Greg has a crush. Greg bites Dr. Kagan's finger when his teeth are being checked. In what Greg believes to be an act of revenge, Dr. Kagan tells Frank that Greg needs headgear to correct his overbite. Greg says Dr. Kagan is scary and evil and that he never fools around. He has sharp metal tools and never smiles. The billboards for Dr. Kagan's dental practice make Greg freak out every time he sees one of them on the highway.\n\nDr. Kagan later makes a cameo in Double Down, in a scene where Greg describes how a Spineticklers book has made going to the dentist an even more frightening experience for him.\n\n===Lenwood Heath===\nLenwood Heath only appears in ''The Last Straw''. He is a rebellious teenager, who was Greg's father's arch-enemy for about three months before he was sent to military academy. This resulted in him becoming a fine young man who works at the movie theater. In the ''Dog Days'' film, he is portrayed by Tom Stevens, and is seen working as a lifeguard at the community pool the Heffleys go to.\n\n===Taylor Pringle===\nTaylor Pringle is a minor character who only appears in the films, ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules'' and ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days'' and does not appear in the books. She is a very rude little girl, and is first seen at the end of the opening scene in ''Rodrick Rules'' in which during her [[birthday party]] at the [[roller rink]], Rodrick embarrasses Greg, prompting Greg to try and tackle him, but he misses and lands in Taylor's [[birthday cake]], destroying it. As a result of this, Taylor gets angry and she and her friends begin beating up Greg as the intro begins. Later in the film, during church, when Rodrick intentionally pulls down the sweater around Greg's waist to reveal the chocolate stain on Greg's pants, Taylor points it out to everyone, mistaking it for poop. Then, in ''Dog Days'', when Greg attempts to impress Holly by jumping off the [[high diving|high]] [[diving platform|diving board]], he becomes nervous, due to it being very high above the water. Taylor then comes up behind Greg and states that he is talking to himself, due to being scared. When Greg gives Taylor a brush-off that he is not scared and that she would not understand since she is \"just a little kid\", she pressures him to jump. When Greg jumps, he loses his [[swimsuit]] on the board, and Taylor chucks it onto a nearby fence to get back at Greg for brushing her off. As a result, Greg is forced to borrow a girl's swimsuit that reads ''Holly'' on it until he goes to the fence to retrieve his own swimsuit, and as he does so, he gets taunted by Patty. Taylor is portrayed by [[Dalila Bela]].\n\n===Jordan Jury===\nOnly appearing in ''The Ugly Truth'', Jordan Jury is the popular boy in the grade above Greg, who's known for always throwing huge parties that have little to no adult supervision. Greg is amazed when he discovers that he has been given a textbook that used to belong to him. Jordan invites Greg and Rowley to his latest party, but Greg cannot not go because of his Uncle Gary's fourth wedding. But at the end of the book, Greg discovers that it's actually a good thing he didn't go to the party as it would seem. The only reason Jordan invited the kids in Greg and Rowley's grade to his party was to basically use them as servants.\n\n===Angie Steadman===\nAngie Steadman only appears as an additional character in the ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' film. She is in seventh grade, has a pink streak of hair, works for the school newspaper, and hates middle school. In the film, Greg and Rowley meet her under the bleachers during a game of \"Gladiator\". She gets along with Rowley, but starts a rocky relationship with Greg after he egotistically declines her offer to join the school newspaper. Greg later tells the whole school he ate the cheese instead of Rowley and she compliments and accepts him when she sees that Greg is learning the errors of his ways. In the film, she is portrayed by [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]].\n\n===Pete Hosey===\nPete Hosey is the leader of the teenagers who attacked Greg and Rowley on [[Halloween]]. He is an antagonist in the first film. He is unnamed in the first book and he is replaced by Herbie Reamer in the online version. After hassling Greg and Rowley on Halloween, Greg yells that he will call the cops, and they chase him to Greg's grandmother's house. In the book, Greg and Rowley sneak back home, but in the movie, they try to intimidate Pete and his friends with a weed hacker, before Pete scratches his car and they are chased into the woods. In both the book and the movie, the teens hold a vendetta against Greg and Rowley. Near the end they corner them on the school field and decide to force them to eat the moldy cheese. Rowley is forced to eat the cheese, but Greg avoids it by saying he's lactose intolerant. In the movie they are chased off by the coach.\n\n===The Warrens===\nAlthough his family is vaguely referenced in the books, the Warren's are what got Frank thinking of making Greg more manly. In the books, Mr. Warren is Frank's boss. Frank is deeply jealous of the Warrens. In stark contrast to Greg, the Warrens' children are shown to be athletic and sporty. In the third film, Stan, the father of the family, is shown to be a neighbor of the Heffleys. He had a minor childhood rivalry with Frank, that they appear to have gotten over as adults. In the movie, Mr. Warren is the troop master of the Wilderness Explorers, and invites everyone over for an Independence Day party. They only appear in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw]]''.\n\n===The Beardos===\nOnly appearing in ''The Long Haul'', the Beardos are the main antagonists of the book. They are a couple with three sons. The Heffleys indirectly met them during their road trip, though only Greg knows who they are. Their first encounter is at a motel, where Greg angrily berates one of the Beardo children, who then tells his father on him, causing Greg to fear running into them again. Greg and his family are convinced that the Beardos have stolen their luggage and belongings at a place they both attended called \"Soak Central.\" They try to track them down though it was revealed at the end that Greg actually had the key to their locker in Soak Central, and that he got the number in the lottery . Their belongings were actually there. The family's real surname is unknown, as Greg himself does not who they are. It is likely he dubbed them this because of the patriarch's noticeably long beard.\n\nIn the film adaption of ''The Long Haul'', Mr. and Mrs. Beardo are portrayed by [[Chris Coppola]] and Kimberli Lincoln, and have a daughter named Brandi and two sons named Brandon and Brent. The Beardos are depicted as much more malicious, with Mr. Beardo chasing Greg around through the carnival to get revenge.\n\n===Chris=== \nChris is a friend of Rodrick and the [[bassist]] in Loded Diper.\n\n===Joshie===\nJoshie is a singer who is famous in Europe and is Rowley's favorite singer and idol. Greg believes that Joshie is for six-year-old girls, but Rowley ignores him, saying that Greg is jealous because he was the one who \"discovered\" Joshie. However, despite Rowley's opinion, Joshie appears to be a singer that is mainly idolized by females.\n\n===Maddox Selsam===\nMaddox Selsam is a boy who lives in the middle of the woods. He is not allowed to have any screen time, and does not have a TV at his house. He enjoys playing with his Legos and practicing his violin. He met Greg in ''Double Down'' when he found Greg's balloon for the Balloon Brigade at his school.\n==Pets==\n\n===Dogs===\n====Sweetie====\nSweetie is a dog that first appeared in ''Dog Days''. Greg's dad buys him after discovering that his father lied about accidentally killing his childhood dog, Nutty. Sweetie wreaks havoc in the Heffley household and is given to Gramma at the end of the book. Sweetie undergoes drastic weight gain at Gramma's house because he is fed lots of table scraps. Eventually Gramma dresses him up like a little human. Greg and Rodrick like playing with him by going up behind him and making flatulence sounds. He will then sniff his rear end until he goes to sleep.\n\n====Nutty====\nNutty is Frank's old dog which he had when he was around Greg's age. Grandpa accidentally ran over and killed Nutty with his station wagon when he backed out of the driveway. Grandpa covered the truth by saying that Nutty ran away to a butterfly farm. Frank is very angry when he finds out the truth during a Father's Day brunch.\n\n====Killer====\nKiller is Joe Heffley's [[Rottweiler]]-type pet dog. In ''Dog Days'', he wreaks havoc by eating most of Greg's birthday cake, leaving Greg not wanting to eat it.\n\n====Rudy====\nRudy was Aunt Cakey's dog. He was usually oblivious to what was going on around him, opting to stare straight ahead doing nothing. It is not known how Rudy died.\n\n====Henry====\nHenry is Gramma's dog who died around the time of the dog days of summer.\n\n====Rebel====\nRebel is a [[Rottweiler]] that used to chase Greg and Rowley on their way to school before his owner installed an electric fence around the front yard. He only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Fish===\n====Greg's Fish====\nIn ''Dog Days'', Greg buys an angel fish from a pet store. He also buys a journal to log the actions of his fish but later realizes he can not put much in it. Greg's fish was later made to share a tank with Rodrick's fish, who ate it while Greg and his family were at the water park on [[Father's Day]].\n\n====Rodrick's Fish====\nRodrick's fish is a [[piranha]]-type fish that was picked out the fish at a pet store in ''Dog Days,'' because it was described as aggressive. Due to Rodrick's neglect at cleaning the tank it was made to share a tank with Greg's fish, which it ate. The fish has not appeared since ''Dog Days,'' with no further mention of its eventual fate.\n\n===Other Pets===\n====Aunt Gretchen's pets====\nAunt Gretchen has about thirty pets that the Heffleys pet-sit in ''Hard Luck'', while she is on vacation. Her pets include three dogs, two cats, a mouse, a parakeet, a turtle, a snake, a lizard, and a litter of bunnies that her rabbit gave birth to while Gretchen was away (despite the fact that the rabbit was actually male).\n\n====Squirm====\nSquirm was an inchworm Greg found and took care of when he was nine. It was stood on and squashed by Manny when he began learning how to walk.\n\n====The Pig====\nThe Heffleys\u2019 pet pig has appeared in all books except ''The Getaway'' since ''The Long Haul'', in which Manny Heffley won it at a country fair for correctly guessing the weight of a hog. To the annoyance of Greg, the pig exhibits extraordinary intelligence and gains human characteristics. One running gag is that despite not having opposable thumbs, the pig opens objects such as soda cans. In ''The Meltdown'' the Pig throws a tantrum for being excluded from the trip to Isla de Corales in ''The Getaway''. Frank sends it to obedience school, only for the Pig to escape on its second day there. The Pig is never found by the Heffleys despite numerous missing posters, and the pig's fate is left unclear.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Diary of a Wimpy Kid}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Diary of a Wimpy Kid}}\n[[Category:Lists of literary characters]]\n[[Category:Diary of a Wimpy Kid (series)]]\n", "name_user": "Pittstone", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eManny Heffley", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Diary_of_a_Wimpy_Kid_characters"}
