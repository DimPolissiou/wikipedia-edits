The Marian Days offer opportunities for [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Reconciliation]] and prayer. There is also times of benediction and workshop for young families, the youth, the Virgin Mary, Vocation, and much more. Mass is celebrated by many bishops, priests, and other religious brothers and sisters.\n\nPilgrims turn the surrounding area into a large campground, as many nearby residents allow pilgrims to erect tents on their lawns. The pilgrims that come earlier to set up tents are expected to stay there or risk losing their tent spots. On Wednesday before the event begins, the brothers and priests of the congregation hold a Mass and procession in honor of Saint Joseph, who is the patron of the Marian Days. Although the celebrations are centered on liturgy, they also feature a number of other events. Dioceses with large Vietnamese populations set up large tents to sell traditional [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnamese food]]. Proceeds go to the parishes, orphanages, or a diocese in Vietnam such as [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Phu Cuong|Ph\u00fa C\u01b0\u1eddng]].

The opening Mass on Thursday is in celebration of the Blessed Sacrament, which is when the event is officially opened, (by the local diocesan bishop; if the bishop is not present, this role is given to the director.) Following the Mass is a Eucharistic Procession around Our Lady of Peace Memorial Garden. The Friday Pontifical Mass is in honor of the 117 Vietnamese Martyr Saints. The Solemn Procession of the statue of Our Lady of F\u00e1tima begins on Saturday.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAt the end of the procession in honor of Our Lady of Fatima, two long firecrackers are lit, followed by the release of numerous balloons of all colors tied to two flags, one of blue and white, the Virgin Mary's colors, and the other of the South Vietnamese flag before that half of the country fell to communism. There also happens to be more balloons that are released afterward. This can be interpreted as symbolically going to the Blessed Virgin Mary. After the procession, the Pontifical Mass is celebrated in honor of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. These two celebrations are the central point of Marian Days every year. On Sunday, the closing Pontifical Mass is celebrated. Before Mass ends, the director for that year's Marian Days announces when the next Marian Days are, and then he officially closes Marian Days.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Roman Catholicism in Vietnam]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{in lang|vi}}<!--Vietnamese--> [http://dongcong.net/ Chi D\u00f2ng \u0110\u1ed3ng C\u00f4ng Hoa K\u1ef3]&nbsp;\u2013 organizer website\n*{{in lang|vi}}<!--Vietnamese--> [http://dongcong.net/NTM/NTM2012/7-4-12/07-04-2012.htm 2012]&nbsp;\u2013 event history\n<!-- *{{in lang|vi}} [http://dongcong.net/Indexntm05.htm Ng\u00e0y Th\u00e1nh M\u1eabu 2005]\u00a0\u2013 2005 event website -->\n*[http://www.carthagepd.org/citizens-academy/marian-days/ Marian Days \u2013 Carthage Police Department]\n\n[[Category:Catholic Church in the United States]]\n[[Category:Catholic Church in Vietnam]]\n[[Category:Vietnamese-American history]]\n[[Category:Overseas Vietnamese religious buildings and structures]]\n[[Category:Asian-American culture in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Marian shrines]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Jasper County, Missouri]]\n[[Category:Catholic Mariology]]\n[[Category:Recurring events established in 1978]]\n[[Category:Festivals in Missouri]]\n[[Category:1978 establishments in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Vietnamese-American culture in Missouri]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|Vietnamese American annual pilgrimage|Marian holy days of the liturgical year|Marian feast days}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2011}}\n{{Infobox recurring event\n| native_name  = Ng\u00e0y Th\u00e1nh M\u1eabu\n| logo         = <!--INCLUDE \"[[File:Filename]]\" when entering file name-->\n| logo_caption =\n| image        = Marian Days 2007 - Carthage Missouri 03.jpg\n| imagesize    = frameless\n| caption      = Entrance to the 2007 Marian Days.\n| begins       = 1st Thursday of August\n| ends         = Following Sunday\n| frequency    = Annual\n| location     = [[Carthage, Missouri]], United&nbsp;States\n| coordinates = {{coord|37.1565|-94.3095|type:event|display=inline,title}}\n| years_active = 42\n| first        = 1978\n| last         = {{as of|2019|lc=on|alt=August 1\u20134, 2019}}\n| next         = {{as of|2020|lc=on|alt=August 5-8, 2021}}\n| participants = 60,000\u2013120,000<ref name=\"KOAM Garcia\">{{cite news|title=Marian Days event in Carthage shows impressive turnout|first=Angela|last=Garcia|location=Pittsburg, Kansas|publisher=[[KOAM-TV]]|date=August 5, 2011|accessdate=August 10, 2011|url=http://www.koamtv.com/story/15218956/marian-days-event-in-carthage-shows-impressive-turnout|quote=Around 60,000 Vietnamese Roman Catholics travel to the campus of the Congregation of Mother of the Co-Redemptrix at this time of year.}}</ref>\n| genre        = Religious, cultural\n| budget       = \n| patron       = [[Congregation of the Mother of the Redeemer]]\n| website      = {{URL|http://dongcong.us/}}\n{{URL|http://dongcong.net/}}\n| footnotes    = \n}}\n\n[[File:\u0110\u1ea1i H\u1ed9i Th\u00e1nh M\u1eabu, l\u1ec5 b\u1ebf m\u1ea1c.jpg|thumb|right|Pilgrims beginning to leave after the closing Mass of the 28th Marian Days celebration.]]\n\nThe '''Marian Days''' ({{lang-vi|\u0110\u1ea1i H\u1ed9i Th\u00e1nh M\u1eabu}}, officially ''c\u00e1c Ng\u00e0y Th\u00e1nh M\u1eabu''<ref name=\"Th\u00e1nh M\u1eabu\">Using a title for the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] in Vietnamese Catholicism, [[:vi:Th\u00e1nh M\u1eabu|also used]] for female deities in various other Vietnamese religions.</ref>) is the main festival and [[pilgrimage]] for [[Vietnamese American]] Roman Catholics.

The Marian Days offer opportunities for [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Reconciliation]] and prayer. There is also times of benediction and workshop for young families, the youth, the Virgin Mary, Vocation, and much more. Mass is celebrated by many bishops, priests, and other religious brothers and sisters.\n\nPilgrims turn the surrounding area into a large campground, as many nearby residents allow pilgrims to erect tents on their lawns. The pilgrims that come earlier to set up tents are expected to stay there or risk losing their tent spots. On Wednesday before the event begins, the brothers and priests of the congregation hold a Mass and procession in honor of Saint Joseph, who is the patron of the Marian Days. Although the celebrations are centered on liturgy, they also feature a number of other events. Dioceses with large Vietnamese populations set up large tents to sell traditional [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnamese food]]. Proceeds go to the parishes, orphanages, or a diocese in Vietnam such as [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Phu Cuong|Ph\u00fa C\u01b0\u1eddng]].

The opening Mass on Thursday is in celebration of the Blessed Sacrament, which is when the event is officially opened, (by the local diocesan bishop; if the bishop is not present, this role is given to the director.) Following the Mass is a Eucharistic Procession around Our Lady of Peace Memorial Garden. The Friday Pontifical Mass is in honor of the 117 Vietnamese Martyr Saints. The Solemn Procession of the statue of Our Lady of F\u00e1tima begins on Saturday.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAt the end of the procession in honor of Our Lady of Fatima, two long firecrackers are lit, followed by the release of numerous balloons of all colors tied to two flags, one of blue and white, the Virgin Mary's colors, and the other of the South Vietnamese flag before that half of the country fell to communism. There also happens to be more balloons that are released afterward. This can be interpreted as symbolically going to the Blessed Virgin Mary. After the procession, the Pontifical Mass is celebrated in honor of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. These two celebrations are the central point of Marian Days every year. On Sunday, the closing Pontifical Mass is celebrated. Before Mass ends, the director for that year's Marian Days announces when the next Marian Days are, and then he officially closes Marian Days.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Roman Catholicism in Vietnam]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{in lang|vi}}<!--Vietnamese--> [http://dongcong.net/ Chi D\u00f2ng \u0110\u1ed3ng C\u00f4ng Hoa K\u1ef3]&nbsp;\u2013 organizer website\n*{{in lang|vi}}<!--Vietnamese--> [http://dongcong.net/NTM/NTM2012/7-4-12/07-04-2012.htm 2012]&nbsp;\u2013 event history\n<!-- *{{in lang|vi}} [http://dongcong.net/Indexntm05.htm Ng\u00e0y Th\u00e1nh M\u1eabu 2005]\u00a0\u2013 2005 event website -->\n*[http://www.carthagepd.org/citizens-academy/marian-days/ Marian Days \u2013 Carthage Police Department]\n\n[[Category:Catholic Church in the United States]]\n[[Category:Catholic Church in Vietnam]]\n[[Category:Vietnamese-American history]]\n[[Category:Overseas Vietnamese religious buildings and structures]]\n[[Category:Asian-American culture in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Marian shrines]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Jasper County, Missouri]]\n[[Category:Catholic Mariology]]\n[[Category:Recurring events established in 1978]]\n[[Category:Festivals in Missouri]]\n[[Category:1978 establishments in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Vietnamese-American culture in Missouri]]\n", "name_user": "Cooltravis778", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_Days"}

Centered around guitarist/lead vocalist [[Doug Martsch]], the only permanent member, Built to Spill has has released eight full-length albums since its incarnation. \n\n==History==\nFormer [[Treepeople]] guitarist/vocalist [[Doug Martsch]] formed Built to Spill in 1992 with [[Brett Netson]] and [[Ralf Youtz]] as the band's original members. In an interview with [[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'']], Martsch stated that he intended to change the band's lineup for every album, himself being the only permanent member.  After the band's first album, ''[[Ultimate Alternative Wavers]]'', was released in 1993, Netson and Youtz were replaced by [[Brett Nelson]] and Andy Capps for 1994's ''[[There's Nothing Wrong with Love]]''.  A [[compilation album]] called ''[[The Normal Years]]'' followed, which included recordings by both lineups. ''[[Built to Spill Caustic Resin]]'', an EP that features Martsch with the members of [[Caustic Resin]], was released in 1995. Between recording albums in 1995, the band gained exposure by playing on the [[Lollapalooza]] tour. Also in 1995, the band collaborated on the song \"Still Flat\" for the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Bothered]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\nMartsch signed Built to Spill to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1995. Unlike many artists signed to major labels, the deal the band brokered with Warner Bros. allowed it to retain a large degree of creative control over future albums. Built to Spill produced its first major label release in 1997 with ''[[Perfect from Now On]]''. By this time, the band consisted of Martsch, Nelson, Netson, and Scott Plouf. ''Perfect from Now On'' was met with critical success and caused Built to Spill to become one of the United States' most recognizable indie rock bands. Before releasing another album, Martsch made Nelson and Plouf permanent members of the band. In 1999, the band released ''[[Keep It Like a Secret]]'' to continued critical success and for the first time, significant commercial success. ''[[Built to Spill Live|Live]]'' was released in 2000, and the band's fifth studio album, ''[[Ancient Melodies of the Future]]'', was released in 2001.\n\nIn 2002, Martsch released ''[[Now You Know (Doug Martsch album)|Now You Know]]'', a solo album with both [[blues]] and [[folk music|folk]] elements.  He performed numerous solo concerts in support of the album. Built to Spill was on hiatus for most of this period.\n[[Image:Built2spill.jpg|thumb|left|[[Doug Martsch]] performing with the band at [[Primavera Sound Festival]].]]\nWarner Bros.

Its sixth studio album, ''[[You in Reverse]]'', was recorded in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] in 2004 but was not released until April 11, 2006. The band's official lineup for the album was Martsch, Nelson, Plouf, and [[Jim Roth (musician)|Jim Roth]], who was formerly only a touring guitarist. [[Brett Netson]] provided guitar work on several songs and later rejoined the band as a full-time member.\n\nAfter the release of ''You in Reverse'', Built to Spill continued touring almost non-stop. In March 2006, Martsch suffered a detached [[retina]], which required surgery.

Centered around guitarist/lead vocalist [[Doug Martsch]], the only permanent member, Built to Spill has has released eight full-length albums since its incarnation. \n\n==History==\nFormer [[Treepeople]] guitarist/vocalist [[Doug Martsch]] formed Built to Spill in 1992 with [[Brett Netson]] and [[Ralf Youtz]] as the band's original members. In an interview with [[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'']], Martsch stated that he intended to change the band's lineup for every album, himself being the only permanent member.  After the band's first album, ''[[Ultimate Alternative Wavers]]'', was released in 1993, Netson and Youtz were replaced by [[Brett Nelson]] and Andy Capps for 1994's ''[[There's Nothing Wrong with Love]]''.  A [[compilation album]] called ''[[The Normal Years]]'' followed, which included recordings by both lineups. ''[[Built to Spill Caustic Resin]]'', an EP that features Martsch with the members of [[Caustic Resin]], was released in 1995. Between recording albums in 1995, the band gained exposure by playing on the [[Lollapalooza]] tour. Also in 1995, the band collaborated on the song \"Still Flat\" for the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Bothered]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\nMartsch signed Built to Spill to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1995. Unlike many artists signed to major labels, the deal the band brokered with Warner Bros. allowed it to retain a large degree of creative control over future albums. Built to Spill produced its first major label release in 1997 with ''[[Perfect from Now On]]''. By this time, the band consisted of Martsch, Nelson, Netson, and Scott Plouf. ''Perfect from Now On'' was met with critical success and caused Built to Spill to become one of the United States' most recognizable indie rock bands. Before releasing another album, Martsch made Nelson and Plouf permanent members of the band. In 1999, the band released ''[[Keep It Like a Secret]]'' to continued critical success and for the first time, significant commercial success. ''[[Built to Spill Live|Live]]'' was released in 2000, and the band's fifth studio album, ''[[Ancient Melodies of the Future]]'', was released in 2001.\n\nIn 2002, Martsch released ''[[Now You Know (Doug Martsch album)|Now You Know]]'', a solo album with both [[blues]] and [[folk music|folk]] elements.  He performed numerous solo concerts in support of the album. Built to Spill was on hiatus for most of this period.\n[[Image:Built2spill.jpg|thumb|left|[[Doug Martsch]] performing with the band at [[Primavera Sound Festival]].]]\nWarner Bros.

Its sixth studio album, ''[[You in Reverse]]'', was recorded in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] in 2004 but was not released until April 11, 2006. The band's official lineup for the album was Martsch, Nelson, Plouf, and [[Jim Roth (musician)|Jim Roth]], who was formerly only a touring guitarist. [[Brett Netson]] provided guitar work on several songs and later rejoined the band as a full-time member.\n\nAfter the release of ''You in Reverse'', Built to Spill continued touring almost non-stop. In March 2006, Martsch suffered a detached [[retina]], which required surgery.

Its vast interior was largely opened up by the construction of three east-west railway lines that connected the interior of the State to the eastern coastal towns of [[Brisbane]], [[Rockhampton, Queensland|Rockhampton]] and [[Townsville, Queensland|Townsville]].  The trunk lines were the [[Main Line railway|Main Line]] and [[Western railway line, Queensland|Western Line]] from Brisbane to [[Roma, Queensland|Roma]] and [[Charleville, Queensland|Charleville]] (completed in 1888), the Central West line from Rockhampton to [[Emerald, Queensland|Emerald]] and [[Longreach, Queensland|Longreach]] (completed in 1892), and the [[Great Northern Railway (Queensland)|Great Northern Line]] from Townsville to [[Charters Towers, Queensland|Charters Towers]] and [[Hughenden, Queensland|Hughenden]] (completed in 1887).  But those termini were still some 500 kilometres from Queensland\u2019s western border.\n\nIt was later decided that each of the routes should each be extended to the south-west.  In the case of the Western Line an extension to [[Cunnamulla, Queensland|Cunnamulla]] was opened in 1898.  The Central West Line was extended from [[Jericho, Queensland|Jericho]] south-west to [[Blackall, Queensland|Blackall]] and opened in 1908 whilst a further extension to [[Yaraka, Queensland|Yaraka]] opened in 1917.  Also in 1917 the Quilpie Line was opened from Westgate (south of Charleville) due west to [[Quilpie, Queensland|Quilpie]].  The last two extensions were part of the [[Great Western Railway, Queensland|Great Western Railway]] proposal.\n\n===Competing interests===\nA proposal to extend the [[Great Northern Railway (Queensland)|Great Northern Line]] from Hughenden south-west to Winton was opposed by Rockhampton interests who presumably lobbied for an extension from Longreach north-west to Winton.  But the south-west route prevailed and construction approval was granted in 1895.<ref>Kerr, J. 'Triumph of Narrow Gauge', Boolarong Publications, 1990</ref>  Although it was to be an extension of the Great Northern Railway it appears that the line beyond Hughenden was later renamed the Winton Branch because of extensions due west of Hughenden to Richmond were completed in 1904, to [[Cloncurry, Queensland|Cloncurry]] in 1908, to [[Duchess, Queensland|Duchess]] in 1912 and to [[Mount Isa]] in 1929.  The Great Northern Railway then stretched nearly 1,000 kilometres.\n\n===Connection to Rockhampton===\nIn 1928 and some thirty years after the Hughenden to Winton project, the Central West line was extended from Longreach to Winton thereby connecting two of the original trunk lines.\n\n==Construction==\nThe Winton Branch was 212 kilometres in length and constructed in three stages of 62, 67 and 83 kilometres.  The first stage to Stamford via [[Warianna, Queensland|Warianna]] siding opened on 13 December 1897.<ref>Quinlan, H. & Newland, J. 'Australian Railway Routes 1854-2000'  ARHS NSW Division 2000</ref>  The next stage took the line to [[Corfield, Queensland|Corfield]] (previously called [[Manuka, Queensland|Manuka]]) on 15 October 1898.  Stops were established along the way at [[Chinbi, Queensland|Chinbi]] and [[Tarvano, Queensland|Tarvano]].  The last stage opened to Winton on 5 July 1899 with tiny stops at [[Olio, Queensland|Olio]], [[Lana, Queensland|Lana]], [[Prubi, Queensland|Prubi]], [[Oondooroo, Queensland|Oondooroo]] and [[Rangelands, Queensland|Rangelands]].\n\nThe branch not only allowed passengers to travel between Winton and Townsville in a day (albeit a 17-hour journey) but it also facilitated a rapid expansion of the wool industry in the Winton area.  A mail train ran three times a week and a goods train ran to Hughenden.  Services were later reduced to one per week.\n\n===Decline===\nAs was the case with many of Queensland\u2019s railways, freight traffic steadily declined to the point that the Winton Branch became uneconomical to maintain.  Last patronised in the mid 1990s, the branch closed in 2008.  In 2012 it was reported that some 8,500 tonnes of track, 320,000 sleepers and 1.3 million dog spikes were removed and resold or recycled.\n\nThe Hughenden to Winton Road that largely runs parallel to the old track has been sealed so as to provide an alternative route to the North Queensland coast when the [[Capricorn Highway|Capricorn]] and [[Flinders Highway, Queensland|Flinders]] Highways leading to Rockhampton and Townville are cut by floodwaters.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Travelling post office, Queensland]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.qhatlas.com.au/map/extent-queensland-railway-network-1925/ 1925 map of the Queensland railway system]\n{{Railway lines in Queensland |state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Closed railway lines in Queensland]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox rail line\n| box_width        = \n| name             = Hughenden-Winton railway line\n| other_name       = \n| native_name      = \n| native_name_lang = \n| color            = \n| logo             =  \n| logo_width       = \n| logo_alt         = \n| image            = Dia 0384.jpg\n| image_width      = \n| image_alt        = \n| caption          = QR loco 1600 hauling the Winton-Hughenden mixed train crosses 1645, September 1989.

Kraft sold its ice cream brands to [[Unilever]] in 1993, while retaining the rights to the name for yogurt products.<ref name=History />\n\n==Ice cream==\nPrior to 2006,<ref name=\"Tara Gum\" /> Breyers was known for producing [[ice cream]] with a small number of [[Natural foods|all-natural]] ingredients. \n\nIn recent years, as part of [[cost reduction|cost-cutting]] measures since their move from [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]], to Unilever's U.S. headquarters in [[Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey]],<ref name=\"Green Bay\" /> Unilever has reformulated many of its flavors with nontraditional, additive ingredients, significantly changing the taste and texture of their desserts as a result.<ref name=\"Tara Gum\" /> Following similar practices by several of their competitors, and to the consternation of many former customers,<ref name=\"Tara Gum\" /> Breyers' list of ingredients has expanded to include thickeners, low-cost sweeteners, food coloring and low-cost additives \u2014 including natural additives such as [[tara gum]]<ref name=\"Natural Vanilla\" /> and [[Locust bean gum|carob bean gum]];<ref name=\"Creamy Vanilla\" /> artificial additives such as [[maltodextrin]] and [[propylene glycol]];<ref name=\"Oreo Cookies\" /> and common artificially separated and extracted ingredients such as [[corn syrup]], [[whey]], and others.<ref name=\"Creamy Vanilla\" /><ref name=\"Oreo Cookies\" />  An ingredient list for Breyers Frozen Dairy Dessert may now include up to forty ingredients:\n\n{{quote|Ingredients: milk, skim milk, sugar, corn syrup, cream, maltodextrin, whey, cellulose gel, mono & diglycerides, guar gum, cellulose gum, natural flavor, carob bean gum, carrageenan. caramel swirl: sugar, water, corn syrup, [[high fructose corn syrup]], non fat milk solids, butter, salt, molasses, pectin, soy lecithin, sodium citrate, natural flavor, lactic acid, potassium sorbate. waffle cone pieces: fudge coating (sugar, coconut oil, cocoa powder, nonfat milk powder, whole milk powder, anhydrous milkfat, soy lecithin, vanilla), waffle cones (unenriched wheat flour, sugar, corn starch, palm and/or soybean oil, bamboo fiber, soy lecithin, natural flavor, soy flour, salt), natural flavor.}}\n\nOne result of these cost-cutting practices has been that many of Breyers' products no longer contain enough milk and cream to meet labeling requirements for ice cream, and are now labeled \"Frozen Dairy Dessert\" in the United States<ref name=\"Frozen Dairy Dessert\" /> and \"Frozen Dessert\" in Canada.<ref name=Canada /><ref name=Canada2 />\n\nFor several decades over 30% of Breyers products, including most of its products sold in the [[northeastern U.S.]], were produced in a large plant outside [[Boston]], in [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]], [[Massachusetts]]. As part of cost-cutting by Unilever, the plant was closed in March 2011.<ref name=Framingham />\n\n==Marketing==\nIn the 1980s, when Breyers produced all-natural ice cream, the company ran a television advertising campaign in [[North America]] featuring a child who attempted to read an ingredients list from another ice cream brand and experienced extreme difficulty pronouncing several listed artificial additives. The child then turned to the Breyers list and quickly rattled off the four ingredients on the label of their vanilla ice cream: [[milk]], [[cream]], [[sugar]], and [[vanilla]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Confusion with Dreyer's==\nIn the [[Western U.S.]] and [[Texas]],<ref name=IceCream /> Breyers ice cream is sometimes confused with [[Dreyer's]] ice cream.{{cn|date=September 2014}}  Henry Breyer founded ''Breyers'' in 1908 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], while  William Dreyer and Joseph Edy co-founded Edy's Grand Ice Cream in 1928 in [[Oakland, California]].

As part of cost-cutting by Unilever, the plant was closed in March 2011.<ref name=Framingham />\n\n==Marketing==\nIn the 1980s, when Breyers produced all-natural ice cream, the company ran a television advertising campaign in [[North America]] featuring a child who attempted to read an ingredients list from another ice cream brand and experienced extreme difficulty pronouncing several listed artificial additives. The child then turned to the Breyers list and quickly rattled off the four ingredients on the label of their vanilla ice cream: [[milk]], [[cream]], [[sugar]], and [[vanilla]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Confusion with Dreyer's==\nIn the [[Western U.S.]] and [[Texas]],<ref name=IceCream /> Breyers ice cream is sometimes confused with [[Dreyer's]] ice cream.{{cn|date=September 2014}}  Henry Breyer founded ''Breyers'' in 1908 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], while  William Dreyer and Joseph Edy co-founded Edy's Grand Ice Cream in 1928 in [[Oakland, California]].

In order to protect the region from the depredations of the Takeda, the Nagano family kept his death a secret until his heir could settle into power. The Takeda attacked in 1566, and were held off for a time, with the young heir, [[Nagano Narimori]], and famous swordsman [[Kamiizumi Hidetsuna]], leading the defense.

After a period of intense hand-to-hand fighting, [[Minowa Castle]]'s lord, [[Nagano Narimori]], was killed, and the castle fell.\n\nSome years before, [[Nagano Narimasa]], lord of Minowa castle and faithful retainer to the Uesugi, died; in order to protect the region from the depredations of the Takeda, the Nagano family kept his death a secret until his heir could settle into power. The Takeda attacked in 1566, and were held off for a time, with the young heir, Nagano Narimori, and famous swordsman [[Kamiizumi Hidetsuna]], leading the defence. Intense hand-to-hand fighting eventually led to Hidetsuna leading a bold charge from the castle, which was initially successful. However, Narimori was killed soon afterwards, and the defence fell apart.\n\n==References==\n*Turnbull, Stephen (1998). 'The Samurai Sourcebook'.
