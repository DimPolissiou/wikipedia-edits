In Paraguay, Guarani shares joint official status with Spanish. In Colombia, the languages of the country's ethnic groups are constitutionally recognized as official languages in their territories; more than 60 such aboriginal languages exist today. In Ecuador, Spanish, [[Northern Quechua]] and [[Shuar]] are official for intercultural relations. In Peru, Quechua, Aymara, and other indigenous languages are co-official in the areas where they are predominant. There are many other languages once spoken in South America that are extinct today (such as the [[extinct languages of the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River basin]]).\n\nIn Brazil, there are around 135 indigenous languages confirmed. The regions with the most speakers are northern and southern Brazil, where there is a larger concentration of native people.

and [[Mapudungun]] in small pockets of southern Chile and Argentina.\n\nIn Bolivia, Quechua, Aymara, and Tupi Guarani are co-official alongside Spanish. In Paraguay, Guarani shares joint official status with Spanish. In Colombia, the languages of the country's ethnic groups are constitutionally recognized as official languages in their territories; more than 60 such aboriginal languages exist today. In Ecuador, Spanish, [[Northern Quechua]] and [[Shuar]] are official for intercultural relations. In Peru, Quechua, Aymara, and other indigenous languages are co-official in the areas where they are predominant. There are many other languages once spoken in South America that are extinct today (such as the [[extinct languages of the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River basin]]).\n\nIn Brazil, there are around 135 indigenous languages confirmed. The regions with the most speakers are northern and southern Brazil, where there is a larger concentration of native people.

In the year 2000, after years of neglecting and ignoring the other languages present in Morocco, the Charter for Educational Reform recognized them and the necessity for them.<ref name=\"Deroche\"/>\n\nUntil then the [[Berber languages|Tamazight]] languages were marginalized in the modern society and the number of monolingual speakers decreased. In recent years, the Berber culture has been gaining strength and some developments promise that these languages will not die (Berber is the generic name for the Berber languages. The term Berber is not used nor known by the speakers of these languages).<ref name=\"Marley\" />\n\n[[Arabic]], on the other hand, has been perceived as a prestigious language in Morocco for over a millennium. However, there are very distinctive varieties of Arabic used, not all equally prestigious, which are [[Modern Standard Arabic|MSA]] (Modern Standard Arabic), the written form used in schools and \u2018[[Dialectal Arabic]]\u2019, the non-standardized spoken form. The difference between the two forms in terms of grammar, [[phonology]] and vocabulary is so great, it can be considered as [[diglossia]]. MSA is practically foreign to Moroccan schoolchildren, and this creates problems with reading and writing,  consequently leading to a high level of [[Literacy|illiteracy]] in Morocco.<ref name=\"Marley\" />\n\nThe [[French language|French]] language is also dominant in Morocco, especially in education and administration, therefore was initially learned by an elite and later on was learned by a great number of Moroccans for use in domains such as finance, science, technology and media. That is despite the government decision to implement a language policy of ignoring French after gaining independence, for the sake of creating a monolingual country.<ref name=\"Marley\" />\n\nFrom its independence until the year 2000, Morocco opted for Arabization as a policy, in an attempt of replacing French with Arabic. By the end of the 1980s, Arabic was the dominant language in education, although French was still in use in many important domains. The goals of Arabization were not met, in [[Linguistics|linguistic]] terms, therefore a change was needed.<ref name=\"Marley\" />\n\nIn 2000 the Charter of Educational Reform introduced a drastic change in language policy. From then on, Morocco has adopted a clear perpetual educational language policy with three main cores: improving and reinforcing the teaching of Arabic, using a variety of languages, such as English and French in teaching the fields of technology and science and acceptance of Tamazight. The state of Morocco still sees Arabic (MSA) as its national language, but acknowledges that not all Moroccans are Arabic speakers and that Arabization did not succeed in the area of science and technology. The aims of the Charter seem to have been met faster than expected, probably since the conditions of the Charter started to be implemented immediately. Nowadays the different minority languages are acknowledged in Morocco although Arabic still is the dominant one and is being promoted by the government.<ref name=\"Marley\">{{Citation|last=|first=|title=From Monolingualism to Multilingualism: Recent Changes in Moroccan Language Policy|date=2005|url=http://www.lingref.com/isb/4/117ISB4.PDF|work=ISB4: Proceedings of the 4th International Symposium on Bilingualism|volume=|pages=1487\u20131500|editor-last=James Cohen|place=Somerville, MA|publisher=Cascadilla Press|access-date=30 April 2017|editor2-last=Kara T.

Population shifts in location and number, effects of urbanization and education in other languages, etc., make estimates difficult. In 1952 A. Basset (LLB.4) estimated the number of Berberophones at 5,500,000. Between 1968 and 1978 estimates ranged from eight to thirteen million (as reported by Galand, LELB 56, pp.&nbsp;107, 123\u201325); Voegelin and Voegelin (1977, p.&nbsp;297) call eight million a conservative estimate. In 1980, S. Chaker estimated that the Berberophone populations of Kabylie and the three Moroccan groups numbered more than one million each; and that in Algeria, 3,650,000, or one out of five Algerians, speak a Berber language (Chaker 1984, pp.&nbsp;8-)\n\nIn 1952, Andr\u00e9 Basset (\"La langue berb\u00e8re\", Handbook of African Languages, Part I, Oxford) estimated that a \"small majority\" of Morocco's population spoke Berber. The 1960 census estimated that 34% of Moroccans spoke Berber, including bi-, tri-, and quadrilinguals. In 2000, [[Karl Prasse]] cited \"more than half\" in an interview conducted by Brahim Karada at Tawalt.com. According to the Ethnologue (by deduction from its Moroccan Arabic figures), the Berber-speaking population is estimated at 65% (1991 and 1995). However, the figures it gives for individual languages only add up to 7.5 million, or about 57%. Most of these are accounted for by three dialects: \n:Riff: 4.5 million (1991)\n:Shilha: 7 million (1998)\n:Central Morocco Tamazight: 7 million (1998)\nThis nomenclature is common in linguistic publications, but is significantly complicated by local usage: thus Shilha is sub-divided into Shilha of the Dra valley, Tasusit (the language of the Souss) and several other (mountain) dialects. Moreover, linguistic boundaries are blurred, such that certain dialects cannot accurately be described as either Central Morocco Tamazight (spoken in the Central and eastern Atlas area) or Shilha. The differences among all Moroccan dialects are not too pronounced: public radio news are broadcast using the various dialects; each journalist speaks his or her own dialect with the result that understanding is not obstructed, though most southern Berbers find that understanding Riff requires some getting used to.\n\n==French==\n[[File:Maroc arabe fran\u00e7ais.png|thumbnail|French and Arabic (MSA) coexist in Moroccan administration and business.]]\n{{main|French language in Morocco}}\nWithin Morocco, French, one of the country's two [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] languages,<ref name=Rouchdy71/> is often used for business, diplomacy, and government;<ref name=\"CIA\">{{Citation |title=Morroco |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mo.html Morocco |work=[[CIA World Factbook]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BOX97UlY?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mo.html |quote=French (often the language of business, government, and diplomacy) |access-date=13 October 2012 |archive-date=13 October 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> and serves as a [[lingua franca]].<ref>\"[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/bitter-fruit-where-donegals-jobs-went-421166.html Bitter Fruit: where Donegal's jobs went].\" ''[[Irish Independent]]''.

In the year 2000, after years of neglecting and ignoring the other languages present in Morocco, the Charter for Educational Reform recognized them and the necessity for them.<ref name=\"Deroche\"/>\n\nUntil then the [[Berber languages|Tamazight]] languages were marginalized in the modern society and the number of monolingual speakers decreased. In recent years, the Berber culture has been gaining strength and some developments promise that these languages will not die (Berber is the generic name for the Berber languages. The term Berber is not used nor known by the speakers of these languages).<ref name=\"Marley\" />\n\n[[Arabic]], on the other hand, has been perceived as a prestigious language in Morocco for over a millennium. However, there are very distinctive varieties of Arabic used, not all equally prestigious, which are [[Modern Standard Arabic|MSA]] (Modern Standard Arabic), the written form used in schools and \u2018[[Dialectal Arabic]]\u2019, the non-standardized spoken form. The difference between the two forms in terms of grammar, [[phonology]] and vocabulary is so great, it can be considered as [[diglossia]]. MSA is practically foreign to Moroccan schoolchildren, and this creates problems with reading and writing,  consequently leading to a high level of [[Literacy|illiteracy]] in Morocco.<ref name=\"Marley\" />\n\nThe [[French language|French]] language is also dominant in Morocco, especially in education and administration, therefore was initially learned by an elite and later on was learned by a great number of Moroccans for use in domains such as finance, science, technology and media. That is despite the government decision to implement a language policy of ignoring French after gaining independence, for the sake of creating a monolingual country.<ref name=\"Marley\" />\n\nFrom its independence until the year 2000, Morocco opted for Arabization as a policy, in an attempt of replacing French with Arabic. By the end of the 1980s, Arabic was the dominant language in education, although French was still in use in many important domains. The goals of Arabization were not met, in [[Linguistics|linguistic]] terms, therefore a change was needed.<ref name=\"Marley\" />\n\nIn 2000 the Charter of Educational Reform introduced a drastic change in language policy. From then on, Morocco has adopted a clear perpetual educational language policy with three main cores: improving and reinforcing the teaching of Arabic, using a variety of languages, such as English and French in teaching the fields of technology and science and acceptance of Tamazight. The state of Morocco still sees Arabic (MSA) as its national language, but acknowledges that not all Moroccans are Arabic speakers and that Arabization did not succeed in the area of science and technology. The aims of the Charter seem to have been met faster than expected, probably since the conditions of the Charter started to be implemented immediately. Nowadays the different minority languages are acknowledged in Morocco although Arabic still is the dominant one and is being promoted by the government.<ref name=\"Marley\">{{Citation|last=|first=|title=From Monolingualism to Multilingualism: Recent Changes in Moroccan Language Policy|date=2005|url=http://www.lingref.com/isb/4/117ISB4.PDF|work=ISB4: Proceedings of the 4th International Symposium on Bilingualism|volume=|pages=1487\u20131500|editor-last=James Cohen|place=Somerville, MA|publisher=Cascadilla Press|access-date=30 April 2017|editor2-last=Kara T.

The country shows a marked difference in urban and rural dialects. This is due to the history of settlement.

Then, in the 13th century, [[Bedouin]] tribes swept through many of the unsettled areas, spreading with them their distinct Arabic dialect in the non-urbanized areas and leaving speakers of Berber in isolated areas in the more mountainous regions.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n=== Modern Standard and Classical Arabic===\nMoroccans learn Standard Arabic as a language.

Population shifts in location and number, effects of urbanization and education in other languages, etc., make estimates difficult. In 1952 A. Basset (LLB.4) estimated the number of Berberophones at 5,500,000. Between 1968 and 1978 estimates ranged from eight to thirteen million (as reported by Galand, LELB 56, pp.&nbsp;107, 123\u201325); Voegelin and Voegelin (1977, p.&nbsp;297) call eight million a conservative estimate. In 1980, S. Chaker estimated that the Berberophone populations of Kabylie and the three Moroccan groups numbered more than one million each; and that in Algeria, 3,650,000, or one out of five Algerians, speak a Berber language (Chaker 1984, pp.&nbsp;8-)\n\nIn 1952, Andr\u00e9 Basset (\"La langue berb\u00e8re\", Handbook of African Languages, Part I, Oxford) estimated that a \"small majority\" of Morocco's population spoke Berber. The 1960 census estimated that 34% of Moroccans spoke Berber, including bi-, tri-, and quadrilinguals. In 2000, [[Karl Prasse]] cited \"more than half\" in an interview conducted by Brahim Karada at Tawalt.com. According to the Ethnologue (by deduction from its Moroccan Arabic figures), the Berber-speaking population is estimated at 65% (1991 and 1995). However, the figures it gives for individual languages only add up to 7.5 million, or about 57%. Most of these are accounted for by three dialects: \n:Riff: 4.5 million (1991)\n:Shilha: 7 million (1998)\n:Central Morocco Tamazight: 7 million (1998)\nThis nomenclature is common in linguistic publications, but is significantly complicated by local usage: thus Shilha is sub-divided into Shilha of the Dra valley, Tasusit (the language of the Souss) and several other (mountain) dialects. Moreover, linguistic boundaries are blurred, such that certain dialects cannot accurately be described as either Central Morocco Tamazight (spoken in the Central and eastern Atlas area) or Shilha. The differences among all Moroccan dialects are not too pronounced: public radio news are broadcast using the various dialects; each journalist speaks his or her own dialect with the result that understanding is not obstructed, though most southern Berbers find that understanding Riff requires some getting used to.\n\n==French==\n[[File:Maroc arabe fran\u00e7ais.png|thumbnail|French and Arabic (MSA) coexist in Moroccan administration and business.]]\n{{main|French language in Morocco}}\nWithin Morocco, French, one of the country's two [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] languages,<ref name=Rouchdy71/> is often used for business, diplomacy, and government;<ref name=\"CIA\">{{Citation |title=Morroco |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mo.html Morocco |work=[[CIA World Factbook]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BOX97UlY?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mo.html |quote=French (often the language of business, government, and diplomacy) |access-date=13 October 2012 |archive-date=13 October 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> and serves as a [[lingua franca]].<ref>\"[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/bitter-fruit-where-donegals-jobs-went-421166.html Bitter Fruit: where Donegal's jobs went].\" ''[[Irish Independent]]''.

The '''auditory ventral stream''' pathway is responsible for sound recognition, and is accordingly known as the auditory 'what' pathway. The '''auditory dorsal stream''' in both humans and non-human primates is responsible for [[sound localization]], and is accordingly known as the auditory 'where' pathway.

In accordance with this model, words are perceived via a specialized word reception center ([[Wernicke's area]]) that is located in the left [[temporoparietal junction]]. This region then projects to a word production center ([[Broca's area]]) that is located in the left [[inferior frontal gyrus]]. Because almost all language input was thought to funnel via Wernicke's area and all language output to funnel via Broca's area, it became extremely difficult to identify the basic properties of each region.

Neuroanatomical evidence suggests that the ADS is equipped with descending connections from the IFG to the pSTG that relay information about motor activity (i.e., corollary discharges) in the vocal apparatus (mouth, tongue, vocal folds). This feedback marks the sound perceived during speech production as self-produced and can be used to adjust the vocal apparatus to increase the similarity between the perceived and emitted calls. Evidence for descending connections from the IFG to the pSTG has been offered by a study that electrically stimulated the IFG during surgical operations and reported the spread of activation to the pSTG-pSTS-Spt region<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Matsumoto R, Nair DR, LaPresto E, Najm I, Bingaman W, Shibasaki H, L\u00fcders HO | title = Functional connectivity in the human language system: a cortico-cortical evoked potential study | journal = Brain | volume = 127 | issue = Pt 10 | pages = 2316\u201330 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15269116 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awh246 | doi-access = free }}</ref> A study<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kimura D, Watson N | title = The relation between oral movement control and speech | journal = Brain and Language | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 565\u201390 | date = November 1989 | pmid = 2479446 | doi = 10.1016/0093-934x(89)90112-0 }}</ref> that compared the ability of aphasic patients with frontal, parietal or temporal lobe damage to quickly and repeatedly articulate a string of syllables reported that damage to the frontal lobe interfered with the articulation of both identical syllabic strings (\"Bababa\") and non-identical syllabic strings (\"Badaga\"), whereas patients with temporal or parietal lobe damage only exhibited impairment when articulating non-identical syllabic strings. Because the patients with temporal and parietal lobe damage were capable of repeating the syllabic string in the first task, their speech perception and production appears to be relatively preserved, and their deficit in the second task is therefore due to impaired monitoring.

The roles of sound localization and integration of sound location with voices and auditory objects is interpreted as evidence that the origin of speech is the exchange of contact calls (calls used to report location in cases of separation) between mothers and offspring. The role of the ADS in the perception and production of intonations is interpreted as evidence that speech began by modifying the contact calls with intonations, possibly for distinguishing alarm contact calls from safe contact calls. The role of the ADS in encoding the names of objects (phonological long-term memory) is interpreted as evidence of gradual transition from modifying calls with intonations to complete vocal control. The role of the ADS in the integration of lip movements with phonemes and in speech repetition is interpreted as evidence that spoken words were learned by infants mimicking their parents' vocalizations, initially by imitating their lip movements. The role of the ADS in phonological working memory is interpreted as evidence that the words learned through mimicry remained active in the ADS even when not spoken. This resulted with individuals capable of rehearsing a list of vocalizations, which enabled the production of words with several syllables. Further developments in the ADS enabled the rehearsal of lists of words, which provided the infra-structure for communicating with sentences.\n\n== Sign language in the brain ==\nNeuroscientific research has provided a scientific understanding of how [[Sign language in the brain|sign language is processed in the brain]]. There are over 135 discrete sign languages around the world- making use of different accents formed by separate areas of a country.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/what-sign-language-teaches-us-about-the-brain-29628|title=What sign language teaches us about the brain|last=Suri|first=Sana|website=The Conversation|language=en|access-date=2019-10-07}}</ref>\n\nBy resorting to lesion analyses and neuroimaging, neuroscientists have discovered that whether it be spoken or sign language, human brains process language in general, in a similar manner regarding which area of the brain is being used. <ref name=\":0\" />Lesion analyses are used to examine the consequences of damage to specific brain regions involved in language while neuroimaging explore regions that are engaged in the processing of language.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nPrevious hypotheses have been made that damage to Broca's area or Wernicke\u2019s area does not affect sign language being perceived; however, it is not the case. Studies have shown that damage to these areas are similar in results in spoken language where sign errors are present and/or repeated. <ref name=\":0\" />In both types of languages, they are affected by damage to the left hemisphere of the brain rather than the right -usually dealing with the arts.\n\nThere are obvious patterns for utilizing and processing language. In sign language, Broca\u2019s area is activated while processing sign language employs Wernicke\u2019s area similar to that of spoken language <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThere have been other hypotheses about the lateralization of the two hemispheres. Specifically, the right hemisphere was thought to contribute to the overall communication of a language globally whereas the left hemisphere would be dominant in generating the language locally.<ref name=\":1\">Scientific American.

Irregular words are those in which no such correspondence exists. Nonwords are those that exhibit the expected orthography of regular words but do not carry meaning, such as [[Nonce word|nonce words]] and [[onomatopoeia]].<ref name=\"Norton_2007\" />\n\nAn issue in the cognitive and neurological study of reading and spelling in English is whether a single-route or dual-route model best describes how literate speakers are able to read and write all three categories of English words according to accepted standards of orthographic correctness. Single-route models posit that lexical memory is used to store all spellings of words for retrieval in a single process. Dual-route models posit that lexical memory is employed to process irregular and high-frequency regular words, while low-frequency regular words and nonwords are processed using a sub-lexical set of phonological rules.<ref name=\"Norton_2007\" />\n\nThe single-route model for reading has found support in computer modelling studies, which suggest that readers identify words by their orthographic similarities to phonologically alike words.<ref name=\"Norton_2007\" /> However, cognitive and lesion studies lean towards the dual-route model. Cognitive spelling studies on children and adults suggest that spellers employ phonological rules in spelling regular words and nonwords, while lexical memory is accessed to spell irregular words and high-frequency words of all types.<ref name=\"Norton_2007\" /> Similarly, lesion studies indicate that lexical memory is used to store irregular words and certain regular words, while phonological rules are used to spell nonwords.<ref name=\"Norton_2007\" />\n\nMore recently, neuroimaging studies using [[positron emission tomography]] and [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] have suggested a balanced model in which the reading of all word types begins in the [[visual word form area]], but subsequently branches off into different routes depending upon whether or not access to lexical memory or semantic information is needed (which would be expected with irregular words under a dual-route model).<ref name=\"Norton_2007\" /> A 2007 fMRI study found that subjects asked to produce regular words in a spelling task exhibited greater activation in the left posterior [[Superior temporal gyrus|STG]], an area used for phonological processing, while the spelling of irregular words produced greater activation of areas used for lexical memory and semantic processing, such as the left [[Inferior frontal gyrus|IFG]] and left [[Supramarginal gyrus|SMG]] and both hemispheres of the [[Middle temporal gyrus|MTG]].<ref name=\"Norton_2007\" /> Spelling nonwords was found to access members of both pathways, such as the left STG and bilateral MTG and [[Inferior temporal gyrus|ITG]].<ref name=\"Norton_2007\" /> Significantly, it was found that spelling induces activation in areas such as the left [[fusiform gyrus]] and left SMG that are also important in reading, suggesting that a similar pathway is used for both reading and writing.<ref name=\"Norton_2007\" />\n\nFar less information exists on the cognition and neurology of non-alphabetic and non-English scripts. Every language has a [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] and a [[Phonology|phonological]] component, either of which can be recorded by a [[writing system]]. Scripts recording words and morphemes are considered [[Logogram|logographic]], while those recording phonological segments, such as [[Syllabary|syllabaries]] and [[Alphabet|alphabets]], are phonographic.<ref name=\"Treiman_2007\" /> Most systems combine the two and have both logographic and phonographic characters.<ref name=\"Treiman_2007\" />\n\nIn terms of complexity, writing systems can be characterized as \u201ctransparent\u201d or \u201copaque\u201d and as \u201cshallow\u201d or \u201cdeep.\u201d A \u201ctransparent\u201d system exhibits an obvious correspondence between grapheme and sound, while in an \u201copaque\u201d system this relationship is less obvious. The terms \u201cshallow\u201d and \u201cdeep\u201d refer to the extent that a system\u2019s orthography represents morphemes as opposed to phonological segments.<ref name=\"Treiman_2007\" /> Systems that record larger morphosyntactic or phonological segments, such as logographic systems and syllabaries put greater demand on the memory of users.<ref name=\"Treiman_2007\" /> It would thus be expected that an opaque or deep writing system would put greater demand on areas of the brain used for lexical memory than would a system with transparent or shallow orthography.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col |colwidth=27em}}\n*[[Sign language]]\n*[[Phonology]]\n*[[Auditory processing disorder]]\n*[[Brodmann area]]\n*[[Cognitive science]]\n*[[Developmental verbal dyspraxia]]\n*[[FOXP2]]\n*[[Language disorder]]\n*[[Neurobiology]]\n*[[Neurolinguistics]]\n*[[Neuropsychology]]\n*[[Neuroscience]]\n*[[Origin of language]]\n*[[Visual word form area]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Neurolinguistics]]\n[[Category:Psycholinguistics]]\n[[Category:Neuroscience]]\n[[Category:Language acquisition]]\n[[Category:Speech codecs]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Language processing|the processing of language by computers|Natural language processing}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Primary sources|date=October 2018|article}}\n{{update|date=October 2018}}\n}}\n[[File:Neurolinguistics.png|alt=|thumb|'''Dual stream connectivity between the auditory cortex and frontal lobe of monkeys and humans.'''

In accordance with this model, words are perceived via a specialized word reception center ([[Wernicke's area]]) that is located in the left [[temporoparietal junction]]. This region then projects to a word production center ([[Broca's area]]) that is located in the left [[inferior frontal gyrus]]. Because almost all language input was thought to funnel via Wernicke's area and all language output to funnel via Broca's area, it became extremely difficult to identify the basic properties of each region.

Neuroanatomical evidence suggests that the ADS is equipped with descending connections from the IFG to the pSTG that relay information about motor activity (i.e., corollary discharges) in the vocal apparatus (mouth, tongue, vocal folds). This feedback marks the sound perceived during speech production as self-produced and can be used to adjust the vocal apparatus to increase the similarity between the perceived and emitted calls. Evidence for descending connections from the IFG to the pSTG has been offered by a study that electrically stimulated the IFG during surgical operations and reported the spread of activation to the pSTG-pSTS-Spt region<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Matsumoto R, Nair DR, LaPresto E, Najm I, Bingaman W, Shibasaki H, L\u00fcders HO | title = Functional connectivity in the human language system: a cortico-cortical evoked potential study | journal = Brain | volume = 127 | issue = Pt 10 | pages = 2316\u201330 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15269116 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awh246 | doi-access = free }}</ref> A study<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kimura D, Watson N | title = The relation between oral movement control and speech | journal = Brain and Language | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 565\u201390 | date = November 1989 | pmid = 2479446 | doi = 10.1016/0093-934x(89)90112-0 }}</ref> that compared the ability of aphasic patients with frontal, parietal or temporal lobe damage to quickly and repeatedly articulate a string of syllables reported that damage to the frontal lobe interfered with the articulation of both identical syllabic strings (\"Bababa\") and non-identical syllabic strings (\"Badaga\"), whereas patients with temporal or parietal lobe damage only exhibited impairment when articulating non-identical syllabic strings. Because the patients with temporal and parietal lobe damage were capable of repeating the syllabic string in the first task, their speech perception and production appears to be relatively preserved, and their deficit in the second task is therefore due to impaired monitoring.

The roles of sound localization and integration of sound location with voices and auditory objects is interpreted as evidence that the origin of speech is the exchange of contact calls (calls used to report location in cases of separation) between mothers and offspring. The role of the ADS in the perception and production of intonations is interpreted as evidence that speech began by modifying the contact calls with intonations, possibly for distinguishing alarm contact calls from safe contact calls. The role of the ADS in encoding the names of objects (phonological long-term memory) is interpreted as evidence of gradual transition from modifying calls with intonations to complete vocal control. The role of the ADS in the integration of lip movements with phonemes and in speech repetition is interpreted as evidence that spoken words were learned by infants mimicking their parents' vocalizations, initially by imitating their lip movements. The role of the ADS in phonological working memory is interpreted as evidence that the words learned through mimicry remained active in the ADS even when not spoken. This resulted with individuals capable of rehearsing a list of vocalizations, which enabled the production of words with several syllables. Further developments in the ADS enabled the rehearsal of lists of words, which provided the infra-structure for communicating with sentences.\n\n== Sign language in the brain ==\nNeuroscientific research has provided a scientific understanding of how [[Sign language in the brain|sign language is processed in the brain]]. There are over 135 discrete sign languages around the world- making use of different accents formed by separate areas of a country.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/what-sign-language-teaches-us-about-the-brain-29628|title=What sign language teaches us about the brain|last=Suri|first=Sana|website=The Conversation|language=en|access-date=2019-10-07}}</ref>\n\nBy resorting to lesion analyses and neuroimaging, neuroscientists have discovered that whether it be spoken or sign language, human brains process language in general, in a similar manner regarding which area of the brain is being used. <ref name=\":0\" />Lesion analyses are used to examine the consequences of damage to specific brain regions involved in language while neuroimaging explore regions that are engaged in the processing of language.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nPrevious hypotheses have been made that damage to Broca's area or Wernicke\u2019s area does not affect sign language being perceived; however, it is not the case. Studies have shown that damage to these areas are similar in results in spoken language where sign errors are present and/or repeated. <ref name=\":0\" />In both types of languages, they are affected by damage to the left hemisphere of the brain rather than the right -usually dealing with the arts.\n\nThere are obvious patterns for utilizing and processing language. In sign language, Broca\u2019s area is activated while processing sign language employs Wernicke\u2019s area similar to that of spoken language <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThere have been other hypotheses about the lateralization of the two hemispheres. Specifically, the right hemisphere was thought to contribute to the overall communication of a language globally whereas the left hemisphere would be dominant in generating the language locally<ref name=\":1\">Scientific American.

LHD signers, on the other hand, had similar results to those of hearing patients. Furthermore, other studies have emphasized that sign language is present bilaterally but will need to continue researching to reach a conclusion<ref name=\":1\" />. \n\n== Writing in the brain ==\n\nThere is a comparatively small body of research on the neurology of reading and writing.<ref name=\"Norton_2007\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Norton ES, Kovelman I, Petitto LA | title = Are There Separate Neural Systems for Spelling?

Irregular words are those in which no such correspondence exists. Nonwords are those that exhibit the expected orthography of regular words but do not carry meaning, such as [[Nonce word|nonce words]] and [[onomatopoeia]].<ref name=\"Norton_2007\" />\n\nAn issue in the cognitive and neurological study of reading and spelling in English is whether a single-route or dual-route model best describes how literate speakers are able to read and write all three categories of English words according to accepted standards of orthographic correctness. Single-route models posit that lexical memory is used to store all spellings of words for retrieval in a single process. Dual-route models posit that lexical memory is employed to process irregular and high-frequency regular words, while low-frequency regular words and nonwords are processed using a sub-lexical set of phonological rules.<ref name=\"Norton_2007\" />\n\nThe single-route model for reading has found support in computer modelling studies, which suggest that readers identify words by their orthographic similarities to phonologically alike words.<ref name=\"Norton_2007\" /> However, cognitive and lesion studies lean towards the dual-route model. Cognitive spelling studies on children and adults suggest that spellers employ phonological rules in spelling regular words and nonwords, while lexical memory is accessed to spell irregular words and high-frequency words of all types.<ref name=\"Norton_2007\" /> Similarly, lesion studies indicate that lexical memory is used to store irregular words and certain regular words, while phonological rules are used to spell nonwords.<ref name=\"Norton_2007\" />\n\nMore recently, neuroimaging studies using [[positron emission tomography]] and [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] have suggested a balanced model in which the reading of all word types begins in the [[visual word form area]], but subsequently branches off into different routes depending upon whether or not access to lexical memory or semantic information is needed (which would be expected with irregular words under a dual-route model).<ref name=\"Norton_2007\" /> A 2007 fMRI study found that subjects asked to produce regular words in a spelling task exhibited greater activation in the left posterior [[Superior temporal gyrus|STG]], an area used for phonological processing, while the spelling of irregular words produced greater activation of areas used for lexical memory and semantic processing, such as the left [[Inferior frontal gyrus|IFG]] and left [[Supramarginal gyrus|SMG]] and both hemispheres of the [[Middle temporal gyrus|MTG]].<ref name=\"Norton_2007\" /> Spelling nonwords was found to access members of both pathways, such as the left STG and bilateral MTG and [[Inferior temporal gyrus|ITG]].<ref name=\"Norton_2007\" /> Significantly, it was found that spelling induces activation in areas such as the left [[fusiform gyrus]] and left SMG that are also important in reading, suggesting that a similar pathway is used for both reading and writing.<ref name=\"Norton_2007\" />\n\nFar less information exists on the cognition and neurology of non-alphabetic and non-English scripts. Every language has a [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] and a [[Phonology|phonological]] component, either of which can be recorded by a [[writing system]]. Scripts recording words and morphemes are considered [[Logogram|logographic]], while those recording phonological segments, such as [[Syllabary|syllabaries]] and [[Alphabet|alphabets]], are phonographic.<ref name=\"Treiman_2007\" /> Most systems combine the two and have both logographic and phonographic characters.<ref name=\"Treiman_2007\" />\n\nIn terms of complexity, writing systems can be characterized as \u201ctransparent\u201d or \u201copaque\u201d and as \u201cshallow\u201d or \u201cdeep.\u201d A \u201ctransparent\u201d system exhibits an obvious correspondence between grapheme and sound, while in an \u201copaque\u201d system this relationship is less obvious. The terms \u201cshallow\u201d and \u201cdeep\u201d refer to the extent that a system\u2019s orthography represents morphemes as opposed to phonological segments.<ref name=\"Treiman_2007\" /> Systems that record larger morphosyntactic or phonological segments, such as logographic systems and syllabaries put greater demand on the memory of users.<ref name=\"Treiman_2007\" /> It would thus be expected that an opaque or deep writing system would put greater demand on areas of the brain used for lexical memory than would a system with transparent or shallow orthography.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col |colwidth=27em}}\n*[[Sign language]]\n*[[Phonology]]\n*[[Auditory processing disorder]]\n*[[Brodmann area]]\n*[[Cognitive science]]\n*[[Developmental verbal dyspraxia]]\n*[[FOXP2]]\n*[[Language disorder]]\n*[[Neurobiology]]\n*[[Neurolinguistics]]\n*[[Neuropsychology]]\n*[[Neuroscience]]\n*[[Origin of language]]\n*[[Visual word form area]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Neurolinguistics]]\n[[Category:Psycholinguistics]]\n[[Category:Neuroscience]]\n[[Category:Language acquisition]]\n[[Category:Speech codecs]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_processing_in_the_brain"}
