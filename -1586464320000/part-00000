{"title_page": "Vijja", "text_new": "{{for|the concept of knowledge|Vidya (Knowledge)}}\n{{short description|8th or 9th century Sanskrit poet from India}}\n'''Vijja''', also known as '''Vidya''' or '''Vijjaka''', was an 8th or 9th century [[Sanskrit]] poet from present-day India. Her verses appear in the major medieval Sanskrit anthologies.\n\n== Names and identification ==\n\nVijja ([[IAST]]: Vijj\u0101) is known by several alternative names. Vidyakara's anthology calls her Vidy\u0101, while ''[[Sharngadhara-paddhati]]'' uses the [[Prakrit]] form Vijjak\u0101. Vallabhadeva's anthology also calls her Vijjak\u0101, although some of its manuscripts use the variations Vijj\u0101ka or Vijjik\u0101.{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1994|p=421}}\n\n=== Identification with Vijayanka or Vijaya ===\n\nA verse, attributed to [[Rajashekhara (Sanskrit poet)|Rajashekhara]] in Jalhana's ''[[Suktimuktavali]]'', states:{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1994|p=421}}\n\n{{poemquote\n|text=That Vijayanka, the [[Karnata Kingdom|Karnata]] woman, conquers like [[Sarasvati]]\nWho next to [[Kalidasa]] was a part having ''[[vidarbha|vaidarbha]]'' speeches\n|sign=Rajashekhara{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1994|p=421}}\n}}\n\nSome modern writers have identified this Vijayanka (literally \"having the mark of victory\") with the Vidya or Vijja (literally \"knowledge\" or \"science\") mentioned in several Sanskrit anthologies.{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1994|p=421}} This person is also identified with [[Vijaya-Bhattarika|Vijaya]] (r. c. 650-655 CE) of the [[Chalukya dynasty]] that ruled the Karnata region in southern India.{{sfn|M. B. Padma|1993|p=167}}\n\nOne of the verses attributed to Vijja compares her to the goddess of learning, [[Sarasvati]], and states that she had a dark complexion unlike the goddess. This verse also mentions the famous poet [[Da\u1e47\u1e0din]] (a native of southern India), calling him wrong for describing Sarasvati as \"all-white\" in his invocation to the goddess at the beginning of ''Kavyalakshana''.{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1994|pp=421-422}}{{sfn|Supriya Banik Pal|2010|p=152}}\n\n{{poemquote\n|text=Not knowing me, Vijjaka, dark as the petal of a [[nymphaea caerulea|blue water lily]],\nDandin has vainly declared that Sarasvati is 'all white'.\n|sign=Vijjaka (Vijja)\n|source=quoted in Sharngadhara's ''Paddhati''{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1994|p=421}}\n}}\n\nJalhana's ''[[Suktimuktavali]]'' contains a variation of this verse, beginning with \"Not knowing her, Vijj\u0101k\u0101, dark as petal...\"; Jalhana attributes the verse to an anonymous poet.{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1994|p=422}} The verse may be considered as evidence supporting Vijja's connections to [[South India]], but there is no concrete proof she was same as Pulakeshin's daughter-in-law Vijaya.{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1994|pp=421-422}} In fact, such an identification results in chronological improbabilities: the poetess whose works mention the 8th century poet Dandin could not have been the 7th century royal Vijaya, unless she lived until the end of the century, and deigned to notice a verse by a much younger author.{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1994|p=422}}{{sfn|M. B. Padma|1993|p=167}}\n\nDhanadeva, a writer who praises Vijja as a talented poetess, also mentions a poetess called Vijayanka (Vijaya), who excelled in the ''[[Vidarbha|Vaidarbhi]]'' style. Dhanadeva's writings do not clarify if these two women poets are the same person.{{sfn|Mohan Lal|1992|p=4573}}\n\n=== Identification as the author of ''Kaumudi Mahotsava'' ===\n\nThe Sanskrit play ''[[Kaumudi-Mahotsava]]'' is known from a single manuscript discovered in [[Kerala]]. The manuscript was partially damaged by worms, and had a hole at the place that appears to state the beginning of the author's name in the prologue. The visible part of the author's name can be read as (\"-kay\u0101\"); the ending syllable suggests that this is a feminine name. Scholar Manavalli Ramakrishna Kavi (1866-1957) saw the remains of what he believed to be \"ja\", and read the name as \"jakay\u0101\", although Indologist [[A. K. Warder]] finds this reading doubtful.{{sfn|A. K.

However, Warder notes that the word could have been another name, such as \"Morikay\u0101\".

Her verses appear in the major medieval Sanskrit anthologies.\n\n== Names and identification ==\n\nVijja ([[IAST]]: Vijj\u0101) is known by several alternative names. Vidyakara's anthology calls her Vidy\u0101, while ''[[Sharngadhara-paddhati]]'' uses the [[Prakrit]] form Vijjak\u0101. Vallabhadeva's anthology also calls her Vijjak\u0101, although some of its manuscripts use the variations Vijj\u0101ka or Vijjik\u0101.{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1994|p=421}}\n\n=== Identification with Vijayanka or Vijaya ===\n\nA verse, attributed to [[Rajashekhara (Sanskrit poet)|Rajashekhara]] in Jalhana's ''[[Suktimuktavali]]'', states:{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1994|p=421}}\n\n{{poemquote\n|text=That Vijayanka, the [[Karnata Kingdom|Karnata]] woman, conquers like [[Sarasvati]]\nWho next to [[Kalidasa]] was a part having ''[[vidarbha|vaidarbha]]'' speeches\n|sign=Rajashekhara{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1994|p=421}}\n}}\n\nSome modern writers have identified this Vijayanka (literally \"having the mark of victory\") with the Vidya or Vijja (literally \"knowledge\" or \"science\") mentioned in several Sanskrit anthologies.{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1994|p=421}} This person is also identified with [[Vijaya-Bhattarika|Vijaya]] (r. c. 650-655 CE) of the [[Chalukya dynasty]] that ruled the Karnata region in southern India.{{sfn|M. B. Padma|1993|p=167}}\n\nOne of the verses attributed to Vijja compares her to the goddess of learning, [[Sarasvati]], and states that she had a dark complexion unlike the goddess. This verse also mentions the famous poet [[Da\u1e47\u1e0din]] (a native of southern India), calling him wrong for describing Sarasvati as \"all-white\" in his invocation to the goddess at the beginning of ''Kavyalakshana''.{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1994|pp=421-422}}{{sfn|Supriya Banik Pal|2010|p=152}}\n\n{{poemquote\n|text=Not knowing me, Vijjaka, dark as the petal of a [[nymphaea caerulea|blue water lily]],\nDandin has vainly declared that Sarasvati is 'all white'.\n|sign=Vijjaka (Vijja)\n|source=quoted in Sharngadhara's ''Paddhati''{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1994|p=421}}\n}}\n\nJalhana's ''[[Suktimuktavali]]'' contains a variation of this verse, beginning with \"Not knowing her, Vijj\u0101k\u0101, dark as petal...\"; Jalhana attributes the verse to an anonymous poet.{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1994|p=422}} The verse may be considered as evidence supporting Vijja's connections to [[South India]], but there is no concrete proof she was same as Pulakeshin's daughter-in-law Vijaya.{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1994|pp=421-422}} In fact, such an identification results in chronological improbabilities: the poetess whose works mention the 8th century poet Dandin could not have been the 7th century royal Vijaya, unless she lived until the end of the century, and deigned to notice a verse by a much younger author.{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1994|p=422}}{{sfn|M. B. Padma|1993|p=167}}\n\nDhanadeva, a writer who praises Vijja as a talented poetess, also mentions a poetess called Vijayanka (Vijaya), who excelled in the ''[[Vidarbha|Vaidarbhi]]'' style. Dhanadeva's writings do not clarify if these two women poets are the same person.{{sfn|Mohan Lal|1992|p=4573}}\n\n=== Identification as the author of ''Kaumudi Mahotsava'' ===\n\nThe Sanskrit play ''[[Kaumudi-Mahotsava]]'' is known from a single manuscript discovered in [[Kerala]]. The manuscript was partially damaged by worms, and had a hole at the place that appears to state the beginning of the author's name in the prologue. The visible part of the author's name can be read as (\"-kay\u0101\"); the ending syllable suggests that this is a feminine name. Scholar Manavalli Ramakrishna Kavi (1866-1957) saw the remains of what he believed to be \"ja\", and read the name as \"jakay\u0101\", although Indologist [[A. K. Warder]] finds this reading doubtful.{{sfn|A. K. Warder|1994|p=427}}\n\nBased on Kavi's reading and the space occupied by the hole, some scholars have theorized that the author was \"Vijjakay\u0101\", identifying her with Vijja. However, Warder notes that the word could have been another name, such as \"Morikay\u0101\". Alternatively, the broken word may not be a name at all: it is possible that the sentence containing it states that \"the play was composed with a sub-plot pat\u0101kay\u0101\".{{sfn|A. K.

He then helds posts at G\u00f6ttingen (1888) and Gie\u00dfen (1891), before becoming ''Professor f\u00fcr Altgermanistik'' (professor of Ancient Germanic studies) at the [[University of Gothenburg]]. From 1900 until his retirement in 1925, he was [[Professor ordinarius]] for English studies at [[Universit\u00e4t Kiel]]. He then became an emeritus professor, but from 1927 to 1935 he was also a guest professor at [[Universit\u00e4t Frankfurt]].\n\nHolthausen was involved in research and teaching in the entire Germanic-speaking region around the North and Baltic Seas, though his research focus was in Old English and Old Icelandic literature.\n\n== Key works ==\n* ''[https://archive.org/details/studienzurthidre00holt/page/n4 Studien zur Thidrekssaga]'' (Halle a.

She made it past the first three obstacles, including the Giant Ring and the Silk Slider, before she fell attempting the Jumping Spider, where her full extension was simply too short to hold the position.\n\n=== Subsequent seasons ===\nIn the [[American Ninja Warrior (season 7)|2015 Houston Qualifying round (season 7)]], Catanzaro failed to complete the course after falling on the cargo crossing. She was given a wild card spot in Vegas and she failed due to a mistimed trampoline jump at the Propeller Bar at Stage 1 of The Finals on September 7. By this time the pressure she felt to live up to her broadcast reputation as ''Ninja'''s greatest female competitor was reportedly showing and she was tearful in the post-run interview.\n\nIn 2016, Catanzaro was invited to compete in the 32nd competition of the original Japanese version of ANW, ''[[Sasuke (TV series)|Sasuke]]''. Catanzaro performed well, completing 8 of the stage 1 obstacles before timing out on the final obstacle, the Lumberjack Climb. Since the course's renewal and increased difficulty, Catanzaro set the record for the furthest a female athlete has gone and the closest a female athlete has gotten to completing stage 1 since the 2nd competition (until 2017 when Jessie Graff completed stage 1 and became the first woman ever to complete stage 2.)\n\nIn the [[American Ninja Warrior (season 8)|2016 Oklahoma City Qualifying round (season 8)]], Catanzaro failed to complete the course after falling on an early obstacle, the Log Runner, on June 20; however, she was again given a Wild Card spot in Las Vegas. In the Las Vegas National Finals, Stage 1, she fell on the second obstacle.\n\nIn December 2016 Catanzaro co-hosted as a broadcaster the ''Team Ninja Warrior College Madness'' series of shows.\n\nIn 2017, Catanzaro competed in [[American Ninja Warrior (season 9)|''American Ninja Warrior'' season 9]] in the San Antonio city qualifier and finals. In the former she failed on the fourth obstacle, but did well enough to qualify for city finals under the show's new rules. In that latter run she had her best performance since 2014, making it past the Sky Hooks and the fifth obstacle to get the now-higher Warped Wall, which she failed to surmount. Nonetheless she qualified for the national finals. At the national finals, she failed on Stage 1 at the Double Dipper.\n\nIn 2017, Catanzaro announced her retirement from American Ninja Warrior, with [[American Ninja Warrior (season 9)|season 9]] being her last.<ref>{{cite episode |series= American Ninja Warrior |season= 9 |title= Denver City Finals |airdate= August 28, 2017 |network= NBC }}</ref>\n\n== Professional wrestling career ==\n===WWE===\n====NXT (2017\u2013present)====\nOn January 4, 2017, Catanzaro received a tryout with [[WWE]] at their [[WWE Performance Center]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxsports.com/wwe/story/ninja-warrior-star-kacy-catanzaro-saints-lb-work-wwe-010817|title='Ninja Warrior' star Kacy Catanzaro, Saints LB work out for WWE {{!}} FOX Sports|date=January 8, 2017|work=FOX Sports|access-date=August 16, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> It was announced on August 27 during the [[Mae Young Classic]] that Catanzaro had been signed to a contract with WWE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/111944/two-new-wwe-signings-announced-during-mae-young-classic.html?p=1|title=TWO NEW WWE SIGNINGS ANNOUNCED DURING MAE YOUNG CLASSIC - PWInsider.com|website=PWInsider|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}</ref> On January 18, 2018, WWE officially announced Catanzaro had reported to the [[WWE Performance Center]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwenxt/article/kacy-catanzaro-reports-to-wwe-performance-center|title=\"American Ninja Warrior\" alum Kacy Catanzaro reports to the WWE Performance Center|first=Benigno|last=Anthony|date=January 18, 2018|accessdate=January 24, 2018|website=WWE}}</ref> She made her in-ring debut at a [[WWE NXT|NXT]] [[live event]] on April 19, in [[Sanford, Florida]], in a losing effort to Reina Gonz\u00e1lez.<ref name=\"debut\">[https://www.f4wonline.com/wwe-results/nxt-sanford-fl-live-results-kacy-catanzaro-makes-her-debut-256116 NXT Sanford, FL, live results: Kacy Catanzaro makes her debut]</ref>\n\nCatanzaro continued to make appearances during 2018, both in house shows and on NXT television; she wrestles as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] and takes inspiration from WWE's [[Alexa Bliss]]'s slogan \"Five Feet of Fury\", making reference to Catanzaro's own diminutive size.<ref name = insider>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvinsider.com/692678/kacy-catanzaro-interview-american-ninja-warrior-wwe/|title=Kacy Catanzaro on Making the Jump from 'American Ninja Warrior' to WWE|work=TV Insider|date=May 30, 2018|accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref> The 2nd episode of the [[Mae Young Classic]] aired on September 12, Catanzaro made her televised debut in a winning effort against Reina Gonzalez in the first round match.

Later in 2014, Catanzaro competed in the Dallas finals of ''American Ninja Warrior''.

She made it past the first three obstacles, including the Giant Ring and the Silk Slider, before she fell attempting the Jumping Spider, where her full extension was simply too short to hold the position.\n\n=== Subsequent seasons ===\nIn the [[American Ninja Warrior (season 7)|2015 Houston Qualifying round (season 7)]], Catanzaro failed to complete the course after falling on the cargo crossing. She was given a wild card spot in Vegas and she failed due to a mistimed trampoline jump at the Propeller Bar at Stage 1 of The Finals on September 7. By this time the pressure she felt to live up to her broadcast reputation as ''Ninja'''s greatest female competitor was reportedly showing and she was tearful in the post-run interview.\n\nIn 2016, Catanzaro was invited to compete in the 32nd competition of the original Japanese version of ANW, ''[[Sasuke (TV series)|Sasuke]]''. Catanzaro performed well, completing 8 of the stage 1 obstacles before timing out on the final obstacle, the Lumberjack Climb. Since the course's renewal and increased difficulty, Catanzaro set the record for the furthest a female athlete has gone and the closest a female athlete has gotten to completing stage 1 since the 2nd competition (until 2017 when Jessie Graff completed stage 1 and became the first woman ever to complete stage 2.)\n\nIn the [[American Ninja Warrior (season 8)|2016 Oklahoma City Qualifying round (season 8)]], Catanzaro failed to complete the course after falling on an early obstacle, the Log Runner, on June 20; however, she was again given a Wild Card spot in Las Vegas. In the Las Vegas National Finals, Stage 1, she fell on the second obstacle.\n\nIn December 2016 Catanzaro co-hosted as a broadcaster the ''Team Ninja Warrior College Madness'' series of shows.\n\nIn 2017, Catanzaro competed in [[American Ninja Warrior (season 9)|''American Ninja Warrior'' season 9]] in the San Antonio city qualifier and finals. In the former she failed on the fourth obstacle, but did well enough to qualify for city finals under the show's new rules. In that latter run she had her best performance since 2014, making it past the Sky Hooks and the fifth obstacle to get the now-higher Warped Wall, which she failed to surmount. Nonetheless she qualified for the national finals. At the national finals, she failed on Stage 1 at the Double Dipper.\n\nIn 2017, Catanzaro announced her retirement from American Ninja Warrior, with [[American Ninja Warrior (season 9)|season 9]] being her last.<ref>{{cite episode |series= American Ninja Warrior |season= 9 |title= Denver City Finals |airdate= August 28, 2017 |network= NBC }}</ref>\n\n== Professional wrestling career ==\n===WWE===\n====NXT (2017\u2013present)====\nOn January 4, 2017, Catanzaro received a tryout with [[WWE]] at their [[WWE Performance Center]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxsports.com/wwe/story/ninja-warrior-star-kacy-catanzaro-saints-lb-work-wwe-010817|title='Ninja Warrior' star Kacy Catanzaro, Saints LB work out for WWE {{!}} FOX Sports|date=January 8, 2017|work=FOX Sports|access-date=August 16, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> It was announced on August 27 during the [[Mae Young Classic]] that Catanzaro had been signed to a contract with WWE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/111944/two-new-wwe-signings-announced-during-mae-young-classic.html?p=1|title=TWO NEW WWE SIGNINGS ANNOUNCED DURING MAE YOUNG CLASSIC - PWInsider.com|website=PWInsider|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}</ref> On January 18, 2018, WWE officially announced Catanzaro had reported to the [[WWE Performance Center]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwenxt/article/kacy-catanzaro-reports-to-wwe-performance-center|title=\"American Ninja Warrior\" alum Kacy Catanzaro reports to the WWE Performance Center|first=Benigno|last=Anthony|date=January 18, 2018|accessdate=January 24, 2018|website=WWE}}</ref> She made her in-ring debut at a [[WWE NXT|NXT]] [[live event]] on April 19, in [[Sanford, Florida]], in a losing effort to Reina Gonz\u00e1lez.<ref name=\"debut\">[https://www.f4wonline.com/wwe-results/nxt-sanford-fl-live-results-kacy-catanzaro-makes-her-debut-256116 NXT Sanford, FL, live results: Kacy Catanzaro makes her debut]</ref>\n\nCatanzaro continued to make appearances during 2018, both in house shows and on NXT television; she wrestles as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] and takes inspiration from WWE's [[Alexa Bliss]]'s slogan \"Five Feet of Fury\", making reference to Catanzaro's own diminutive size.<ref name = insider>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvinsider.com/692678/kacy-catanzaro-interview-american-ninja-warrior-wwe/|title=Kacy Catanzaro on Making the Jump from 'American Ninja Warrior' to WWE|work=TV Insider|date=May 30, 2018|accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref> The 2nd episode of the [[Mae Young Classic]] aired on September 12, Catanzaro made her televised debut in a winning effort against Reina Gonzalez in the first round match.

The \"old\" part of the nickname is a pun on Juventus which means \"youth\" in Latin. It was derived from the age of the Juventus star players towards the middle of the 1930s. The \"lady\" part of the nickname is how fans of the club affectionately referred to it before the 1930s. The club is also nicknamed ''la Fidanzata d'Italia'' (the Girlfriend of Italy), because over the years it has received a high level of support from [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]] immigrant workers (particularly from [[Naples]] and [[Palermo]]), who arrived in Turin to work for FIAT since the 1930s. Other nicknames include; ''[La] Madama'' ([[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]] for: Madam), ''i bianconeri'' (the black-and-whites), ''le zebre'' (the zebras){{efn|The zebra is Juventus' official mascot because the black and white vertical stripes in its present home jersey and emblem remembered the zebra's stripes.}} in reference to Juventus' colours. ''I gobbi'' (the hunchbacks) is the nickname that is used to define Juventus supporters, but is also used sometimes for team's players. The most widely accepted origin of ''gobbi'' dates to the fifties, when the ''bianconeri'' wore a large jersey. When players ran on the field, the jersey, which had a laced opening at the chest, generated a bulge over the back (a sort of parachute effect), making the players look hunchbacked.<ref>{{cite news|first=Paolo|last=Granzotto|title=Juve, la Signora \"gobba\" che ci prova|newspaper=Il Giornale|date=16 June 2006|url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/juve-signora-gobba-che-ci-prova.html|accessdate=21 December 2012|language=Italian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115183036/http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/juve-signora-gobba-che-ci-prova.html|archivedate=15 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe official anthem of Juventus is ''Juve (storia di un grande amore)'', or ''Juve (story of a great love)'' in English, written by Alessandra Torre and Claudio Guidetti, in the version of the singer and musician [[Paolo Belli]] composed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|language=Italian|url=http://www.rockol.it/biografia/Paolo-Belli|title=Paolo Belli: biografia e discografia|year=2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415185937/http://www.rockol.it/biografia/Paolo-Belli|archivedate=15 April 2013}}</ref> In 2016, a documentary film called ''Black and White Stripes: The Juventus Story'' was produced by the [[La Villa brothers]] about Juventus.<ref>{{cite news|author=Daniele Solavaggione|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2016/09/30/multimedia/sport/calcio/qui-juve/arriva-bianconeri-juventus-story-dal-al-ottobre-in-sale-italiane-8Q4RmRE6mgXqb9iV6MQEyL/pagina.html|title=Arriva \"Bianconeri \u2013 Juventus Story\"|newspaper=La Stampa|date=30 September 2016|language=Italian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220033345/http://www.lastampa.it/2016/09/30/multimedia/sport/calcio/qui-juve/arriva-bianconeri-juventus-story-dal-al-ottobre-in-sale-italiane-8Q4RmRE6mgXqb9iV6MQEyL/pagina.html|archivedate=20 February 2018}}</ref> On 16 February 2018, the first three episodes of a [[docu-series]] called ''[[First Team: Juventus]]'', which followed the club throughout the [[2017\u201318 Juventus F.C. season|season]], by spending time with the players behind the scenes both on and off the field, was released on [[Netflix]]; the other three episodes were released on 6 July 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2018/first-team--juventus-fc-coming-to-netflix-on-february-16-.php|publisher=juventus.com|date=22 January 2018|title=First Team: Juventus FC coming to Netflix on February 16!|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123072704/http://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2018/first-team--juventus-fc-coming-to-netflix-on-february-16-.php|archivedate=23 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Stadiums ==\n{{Infobox venue\n|stadium_name=Juventus Stadium\n|nickname=\n|image=Juventus v Real Madrid, Champions League, Stadium, Turin, 2013.jpg\n|image_size = 245px\n|location=Corso Gaetano Scirea,<br>10151 Turin, Italy\n|broke_ground=1 March 2009\n|opened=8 September 2011\n|renovated=\n|owner=Juventus F.C.\n|operator=Juventus F.C.\n|cost=\u20ac155,000,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://footballspa.gazzetta.it/2015/08/07/limmobiliare-juve-dopo-lo-stadio-ecco-la-continassa/?refresh_ce-cp|title=L\u2019immobiliare Juve: dopo lo stadio ecco la Continassa|publisher=Gazzetta dello Sport|date=7 August 2015|accessdate=20 August 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309114149/http://footballspa.gazzetta.it/2015/08/07/limmobiliare-juve-dopo-lo-stadio-ecco-la-continassa/?refresh_ce-cp|archivedate=9 March 2016}}</ref>\n|architect=Hernando Suarez,<br>Gino Zavanella,<br>Giorgetto Giugiaro\n|tenants=\n|seating_capacity=41,507 seated\n}}\n{{main|Juventus Stadium|Stadio Olimpico di Torino|Stadio delle Alpi|Stadio di Corso Marsiglia|Stadio Motovelodromo Umberto I}}\nAfter the first two years (1897 and 1898), during which Juventus played in the Parco del Valentino and Parco Cittadella, their matches were held in the Piazza d'Armi Stadium until 1908, except in 1905 (the first year of the ''scudetto'') and in 1906, years in which it played at the [[Stadio Motovelodromo Umberto I|Corso Re Umberto]].\n\nFrom 1909 to 1922, Juventus played their internal competitions at Corso Sebastopoli Camp before moving the following year to Corso Marsiglia Camp, where they remained until 1933, winning four league titles.

The \"old\" part of the nickname is a pun on Juventus which means \"youth\" in Latin. It was derived from the age of the Juventus star players towards the middle of the 1930s. The \"lady\" part of the nickname is how fans of the club affectionately referred to it before the 1930s. The club is also nicknamed ''la Fidanzata d'Italia'' (the Girlfriend of Italy), because over the years it has received a high level of support from [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]] immigrant workers (particularly from [[Naples]] and [[Palermo]]), who arrived in Turin to work for FIAT since the 1930s. Other nicknames include; ''[La] Madama'' ([[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]] for: Madam), ''i bianconeri'' (the black-and-whites), ''le zebre'' (the zebras){{efn|The zebra is Juventus' official mascot because the black and white vertical stripes in its present home jersey and emblem remembered the zebra's stripes.}} in reference to Juventus' colours. ''I gobbi'' (the hunchbacks) is the nickname that is used to define Juventus supporters, but is also used sometimes for team's players. The most widely accepted origin of ''gobbi'' dates to the fifties, when the ''bianconeri'' wore a large jersey. When players ran on the field, the jersey, which had a laced opening at the chest, generated a bulge over the back (a sort of parachute effect), making the players look hunchbacked.<ref>{{cite news|first=Paolo|last=Granzotto|title=Juve, la Signora \"gobba\" che ci prova|newspaper=Il Giornale|date=16 June 2006|url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/juve-signora-gobba-che-ci-prova.html|accessdate=21 December 2012|language=Italian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115183036/http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/juve-signora-gobba-che-ci-prova.html|archivedate=15 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe official anthem of Juventus is ''Juve (storia di un grande amore)'', or ''Juve (story of a great love)'' in English, written by Alessandra Torre and Claudio Guidetti, in the version of the singer and musician [[Paolo Belli]] composed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|language=Italian|url=http://www.rockol.it/biografia/Paolo-Belli|title=Paolo Belli: biografia e discografia|year=2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415185937/http://www.rockol.it/biografia/Paolo-Belli|archivedate=15 April 2013}}</ref> In 2016, a documentary film called ''Black and White Stripes: The Juventus Story'' was produced by the [[La Villa brothers]] about Juventus.<ref>{{cite news|author=Daniele Solavaggione|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2016/09/30/multimedia/sport/calcio/qui-juve/arriva-bianconeri-juventus-story-dal-al-ottobre-in-sale-italiane-8Q4RmRE6mgXqb9iV6MQEyL/pagina.html|title=Arriva \"Bianconeri \u2013 Juventus Story\"|newspaper=La Stampa|date=30 September 2016|language=Italian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220033345/http://www.lastampa.it/2016/09/30/multimedia/sport/calcio/qui-juve/arriva-bianconeri-juventus-story-dal-al-ottobre-in-sale-italiane-8Q4RmRE6mgXqb9iV6MQEyL/pagina.html|archivedate=20 February 2018}}</ref> On 16 February 2018, the first three episodes of a [[docu-series]] called ''[[First Team: Juventus]]'', which followed the club throughout the [[2017\u201318 Juventus F.C. season|season]], by spending time with the players behind the scenes both on and off the field, was released on [[Netflix]]; the other three episodes were released on 6 July 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2018/first-team--juventus-fc-coming-to-netflix-on-february-16-.php|publisher=juventus.com|date=22 January 2018|title=First Team: Juventus FC coming to Netflix on February 16!|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123072704/http://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2018/first-team--juventus-fc-coming-to-netflix-on-february-16-.php|archivedate=23 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Stadiums ==\n{{Infobox venue\n|stadium_name=Juventus Stadium\n|nickname=\n|image=Juventus v Real Madrid, Champions League, Stadium, Turin, 2013.jpg\n|image_size = 245px\n|location=Corso Gaetano Scirea,<br>10151 Turin, Italy\n|broke_ground=1 March 2009\n|opened=8 September 2011\n|renovated=\n|owner=Juventus F.C.\n|operator=Juventus F.C.\n|cost=\u20ac155,000,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://footballspa.gazzetta.it/2015/08/07/limmobiliare-juve-dopo-lo-stadio-ecco-la-continassa/?refresh_ce-cp|title=L\u2019immobiliare Juve: dopo lo stadio ecco la Continassa|publisher=Gazzetta dello Sport|date=7 August 2015|accessdate=20 August 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309114149/http://footballspa.gazzetta.it/2015/08/07/limmobiliare-juve-dopo-lo-stadio-ecco-la-continassa/?refresh_ce-cp|archivedate=9 March 2016}}</ref>\n|architect=Hernando Suarez,<br>Gino Zavanella,<br>Giorgetto Giugiaro\n|tenants=\n|seating_capacity=41,507 seated\n}}\n{{main|Juventus Stadium|Stadio Olimpico di Torino|Stadio delle Alpi|Stadio di Corso Marsiglia|Stadio Motovelodromo Umberto I}}\nAfter the first two years (1897 and 1898), during which Juventus played in the Parco del Valentino and Parco Cittadella, their matches were held in the Piazza d'Armi Stadium until 1908, except in 1905 (the first year of the ''scudetto'') and in 1906, years in which it played at the [[Stadio Motovelodromo Umberto I|Corso Re Umberto]].\n\nFrom 1909 to 1922, Juventus played their internal competitions at Corso Sebastopoli Camp before moving the following year to Corso Marsiglia Camp, where they remained until 1933, winning four league titles.

He started a successful drugstore in [[Bussum]]. In 1933, Reeskamp and his large family moved from their home above the drugstore to a detached house in [[Naarden]]. A devout Protestant, his faith was important to him throughout his life.\n\n==Resistance==\nBefore the war (1939) he was practically already part of the resistance, tailing Germany-sympathizers in the area together with his eldest son, Gerard Reeskamp. Reeskamp already distributed pamphlets before the war to warn people of the imminent danger. Immediately after the invasion in May 1940, he organized a resistance group in Het Gooi, nearby Amsterdam. His eldest son Gerard together with the later famous resistance fighter Theo Dobbe were members of this group. The group stole chests of ammunition and trotyl from the fortifications at Naarden, which were later used by Dobbe for bombings in Amsterdam. Several months later, the group was betrayed and arrested, but father and son Reeskamp managed to escape. As he was wanted by the [[Sicherheitsdienst|Sicherheitsdienst (SD)]], Reeskamp was forced to leave his family and drugstore in Naarden behind in 1940, and seek refuge in Sneek, the birthplace of his wife Sjoukje. He came into contact with Sybrand Marinus van Haersma Buma, the mayor of Wymbritseradeel. Through his contacts, Reeskamp was able to foment resistance in the province of Friesland. In the area of Sneek (Scharnegoutum) he founded one of the first Frisian 'knokploegen' (fighting squads). He was asked to help during large operations elsewhere in the province, most notably during the assault on the Leeuwarden prison. Because of his resistance activities, the Germans wrote him down for several death sentences. A bounty of 10.000 guilders was put on his head, whether dead or alive. In 1944, Reeskamp was appointed District Operation Leader of the sabotage teams in southwestern Friesland. In his resistance, Gerard Reeskamp was supported by his wife Sjoukje Reeskamp-Wielinga. In 1943, she was held in captivity together with her children for several months and was interrogated, but she did not give away her husband's whereabouts. In 1943, Sjoukje took two Jewish children into her home. For this, she received the [[Yad Vashem]] award in 1988, requested by her [[Hidden Children]].\n\n==Overview of resistance activities==\n===Propaganda activities===\n\u2022\tfrom his drugstore, flyers were distributed which warned the people of the dangers of the German occupation (1939) and which were intended to increase the moral resilience of his compatriots\n\u2022\the raised money to print propaganda reading material such as Vrij Nederland and De Oranjekrant. These were subsequently brought to the existing resistance groups by him personally (1941). These activities were an important reason for the SD to hunt him down\n\n===Paramilitary activities===\n\u2022\the stole chests of ammunition and trotyl from the guarded arms deposits in the fortified garrison at Naarden (June 1940)\n\u2022\the made incendiary bombs out of phosphorus and gunpowder, with which the ammunition deposits in Soesterberg were destroyed (1940)\n\u2022\tshortly before he was transported to Kamp Amersfoort, he managed to escape from the guarded Binnengasthuis in Amsterdam (December 1942)\n\u2022\the took charge of the cover squad during the successful raid on the Leeuwarden Penitentiary Facility; 52 resistance members were freed during the raid (8 December 1944)\n\u2022\the took charge during two raids on the Sneek police station, during which 20 resistance members were freed\n\u2022\tas a commander, he organized reception and transport of airdrops with weapons in southwest Friesland (1944-1945)\n\u2022\the bombed an train transporting ammunition in Bozum (December 1944)\n\u2022\the disarmed the German soldiers at gunpoint, on the day Sneek was liberated (15 April 1945)\n\n===Helped construct resistance in Friesland===\n\u2022\thelped construct reading groups in the whole of Friesland, which often developed into resistance groups later on.\n\n===Activities regarding refugees and other victims===\n\u2022\the raided distribution offices in Wommels (23 Oct. 1942), Bolsward, Rauwerd and Mantgum for ration coupons and identification cards\n\u2022\tin Bolsward, he destroyed the address list containing potential candidates for forced labour in Germany\n\u2022\the raided the population register in Rauwerd for blank identity cards\n\u2022\the raided ten cheese factories in Friesland\n\u2022\the shipped food supplies to Amsterdam. Agent Akkerman testified to no less than 200 food aid packages, which had arrived during the Dutch famine of 1944\n\u2022\the robbed dozens of livestock traders who did not want to donate money to the resistance and the refugees\n\n==After the liberation==\nImmediately after the war, Reeskamp was lauded for his courage and boundless effort. He received a recommendation by general Dwight D. Eisenhower on behalf of the Allied Expeditionary Force, for the courage he had displayed. But the last robbery of a livestock trader on 16 January 1945 proved fatal. Reeskamp, who had joined the resistance organization Binnenlandse Strijdkrachten ('Internal Forces') by the end of 1944, robbed livestock traders at the request of Haitze Wiersma, commander of the Frisian branch of the National Organization for Aiding Refugees, in order to finance the resistance, which was constantly plagued by money troubles. Money was direly needed to feed the refugees. During his assignment, two members of his group made a failed robbery-attempt on a rich livestock trader. When he resisted, one of the group members panicked and shot the trader in the head with the pistol he had lent from Reeskamp. The livestock trader was left behind in the snow, and died of pneumonia a few weeks later. Detective Aukema found one of the bullets and held on to it for one and a half years. As Ad van Liempt indicates in his book 'De Drogist', Aukema jr. was a police officer who collaborated with the Germans during the war. According to Van Liempt, this was no coincidence since his father was one of the most notorious Jew-hunters in Amsterdam. For one and a half years Aukema jr. was suspended, awaiting his reprimand. After his suspension was over in 1947, he fanatically committed himself to prosecuting his old wartime enemy Gerard Reeskamp. The bullet he had kept for so long turned out to be crucial for his purposes.\n\n==Trial==\nReeskamp was tried as a soldier for his part in the death of the rich livestock trader, since he had joined the Binnenlandse Strijdkrachten by the end of 1944, which was later incorporated into the military regime. It would cost him dearly. The passionate hearing officer C.H. Beekhuis, active during the war as a lawyer in Leeuwarden, after an initial sentence of 2 years imprisonment, appealed and demanded 6 years imprisonment. 'De Drogist' states that according to Beekhuis, who was completely unaware of any resistance work, the resistance was to have an unblemished record in history. The Supreme Military Court sentenced Reeskamp to 4 years in prison. It was not taken into account that the purpose of that fatal robbery in the war was aiding the refugees. It was not the only remarkable legal aspect of this case. Only after 7 months of imprisonment a lawyer was assigned to Reeskamp. During the trials, his lawyer made little effort in his defense. Witnesses for his defense were not summoned.\n\n==In culture==\nAd van Liempt wrote in his book 'De Drogist' that he did not intend to rehabilitate Reeskamp, but that he did attempt to unearth the truth and that he attempted to ascertain to the best of his abilities what Reeskamp had done in the war and what had happened to him afterwards. Many readers have stated on the biographical website that they cannot help seeing the book as a reparation for a courageous and successful resistance fighter.\n\nA play about his life was created and staged in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pier21.nl/page/actueel/skaad/|title=Skaad 2020 {{!}} Pier21|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=nl|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>\n\n==A remarkable resistance fighter==\nVarious aspects give Reeskamp a special place in the Dutch resistance history. First of all, his anti-NSB activities before the war (1939) are a testament to his foresight, while his resistance activities during May 1940 are proof of his strong vigor. He was one of the very first resistance fighters in the Netherlands, Loe de Jong writes in his multivolume work on World War II. In a letter, De Jong calls Reeskamp one of the first and more important resistance fighters of the Netherlands. A second remarkable aspect of Reeskamp his nature is that he performed his resistance activities as humanely as possible, always attempting to minimize civilian casualties, as the book 'De Drogist' also indicates. The multiple propaganda actions he made to strengthen the moral resilience of his compatriots also stand out. As for the post-war chapter of his story, the first question which comes to mind is why it was possible for the Leeuwarden legal system and police to dispose themselves so easily of an outlaw who had evaded the Germans successfully for years. He is the only resistance fighter who was sentenced and imprisoned after the war for an act of resistance other than assassination. The many hundreds of assassinations carried out by the resistance, even those committed after the war was over, have never led to prosecution.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*Ad van Liempt, De drogist: Hoe een verzetsheld na de oorlog in ongenade viel, Amsterdam 2013.

He started a successful drugstore in [[Bussum]]. In 1933, Reeskamp and his large family moved from their home above the drugstore to a detached house in [[Naarden]]. A devout Protestant, his faith was important to him throughout his life.\n\n==Resistance==\nBefore the war (1939) he was practically already part of the resistance, tailing Germany-sympathizers in the area together with his eldest son, Gerard Reeskamp. Reeskamp already distributed pamphlets before the war to warn people of the imminent danger. Immediately after the invasion in May 1940, he organized a resistance group in Het Gooi, nearby Amsterdam. His eldest son Gerard together with the later famous resistance fighter Theo Dobbe were members of this group. The group stole chests of ammunition and trotyl from the fortifications at Naarden, which were later used by Dobbe for bombings in Amsterdam. Several months later, the group was betrayed and arrested, but father and son Reeskamp managed to escape. As he was wanted by the [[Sicherheitsdienst|Sicherheitsdienst (SD)]], Reeskamp was forced to leave his family and drugstore in Naarden behind in 1940, and seek refuge in Sneek, the birthplace of his wife Sjoukje. He came into contact with Sybrand Marinus van Haersma Buma, the mayor of Wymbritseradeel. Through his contacts, Reeskamp was able to foment resistance in the province of Friesland. In the area of Sneek (Scharnegoutum) he founded one of the first Frisian 'knokploegen' (fighting squads). He was asked to help during large operations elsewhere in the province, most notably during the assault on the Leeuwarden prison. Because of his resistance activities, the Germans wrote him down for several death sentences. A bounty of 10.000 guilders was put on his head, whether dead or alive. In 1944, Reeskamp was appointed District Operation Leader of the sabotage teams in southwestern Friesland. In his resistance, Gerard Reeskamp was supported by his wife Sjoukje Reeskamp-Wielinga. In 1943, she was held in captivity together with her children for several months and was interrogated, but she did not give away her husband's whereabouts. In 1943, Sjoukje took two Jewish children into her home. For this, she received the [[Yad Vashem]] award in 1988, requested by her [[Hidden Children]].\n\n==Overview of resistance activities==\n===Propaganda activities===\n\u2022\tfrom his drugstore, flyers were distributed which warned the people of the dangers of the German occupation (1939) and which were intended to increase the moral resilience of his compatriots\n\u2022\the raised money to print propaganda reading material such as Vrij Nederland and De Oranjekrant.

In Thailand, Krasue is believed to be a cursed individual (usually a female) who engaged in various sins and fraudulent conducts during her previous life. After she dies, her sins causes her to be reborn as a ''phuti'' ({{lang-th|\u0e20\u0e39\u0e15\u0e34}}) that has to live off wasted, uncooked or rotten food. In recent time, the Thai entertainment industry has fictionalized the origin of Krasue as a cursed ancient Khmer princess, as in ''[[Demonic Beauty]]'' (2002). This depiction is, however, merely an attempt to put a royal touch or to reinvent a mythical beginning to a well-known story of an essentially folk origin, for strictly entertainment and commercial purpose. One critic notes that the director of ''Demonic Beauty'' probably just wanted to depict \"Krasue\" as an evil and an alien demon, originating from the witchcraft and black magic of a foreign (i.e. Cambodian's) pagan culture, which is ultimately subdued and defeated by the more-enlightened [[Buddhist culture]] of Thailand.''<ref>[http://kyotoreview.org/issue-14/tamnan-krasue-constructing-a-khmer-ghost-for-a-thai-film/ Tamnan Krasue]</ref>\n\nThere are other oral traditions that say that this spirit was formerly a rich lady that had a length of black gauze or ribbon tied around the head and neck as protection from the sunshine. This woman was then possessed by an evil spirit and was cursed to become a Krasue. Other popular legends claim that origin of the spirit may have been a woman trying to learn [[black magic]] that made a mistake or used the wrong [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]] so that her head and body became separated. [[Buddhist views on sin|Past sins]] are also related to the transmission of the Krasue curse; women who aborted or killed someone in a previous life will become a Krasue as punishment. Other folk stories talk about a person being cursed to become a Krasue after having consumed food and drink contaminated with a krasue's [[saliva]] or flesh. Popular imagination also claims that the transformation into a Krasue is largely restricted to the relatives of women practicing [[witchcraft]] ''\"Mae Mot\"'' (\u0e41\u0e21\u0e48\u0e21\u0e14) or ''\"Yai Mot\"'' (\u0e22\u0e32\u0e22\u0e21\u0e14), especially their daughters or granddaughters. Often women acting strange in a community are suspected of becoming nightly a Krasue by other members of the village.<ref>[http://loy9.com/en/yeaydul/ Yeay Duol]</ref>\n\n===Description in Thai folklore===\nThe Krasue is under a [[curse]] that makes it ever hungry and always active in the night when it goes out hunting to satisfy its [[gluttony]], seeking blood to drink or raw flesh to devour. It may attack cattle or chicken in the darkness, drinking their blood and eating their internal organs.<ref>[http://taliesinttlg.blogspot.com/2011/06/honourable-mention-ghost-and-master-boh.html Honourable Mention: The Ghost and Master Boh]</ref> It may also prey on pieces of cattle, such as [[water buffalo]] that have died of other causes during the night. If blood is not available the Krasue may eat [[feces]] or [[carrion]].<ref name=\"blogspot1\">[http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_lkyLYGrOd5U/TDnIzUEtWII/AAAAAAAAABU/3Dixe_s_Ins/s400/%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B7%E0%B8%AD3.bmp Krasue feeding]</ref> Clothes left outside would be found soiled with blood and excrement in the morning, allegedly after she had wiped her mouth. Therefore, villagers would not leave clothes hanging to dry outside during the night hours.\n\nThe Krasue also preys on pregnant women in their homes just before or after the [[Birth in Thailand|childbirth]]. It hovers around the house of the pregnant woman uttering sharp cries to instil fear. It uses an elongated proboscis-like tongue<ref>[http://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k247/AMFrank/KRASUE/snapshot20061023170035.jpg Krasue tongue]</ref><ref>[http://i137.photobucket.com/albums/q217/Taliesin_ttlg/krasue/krasue_tongue.jpg Krasue tongue extended]</ref> to reach the [[fetus]] or its [[placenta]] within the womb. This habit, among other unmentionable things that this spirit does, is believed to be the cause of many diseases affecting women mainly in rural areas during their pregnancy. In some cases it may catch the unborn child and use its sharp teeth to devour it.\nIn order to protect pregnant women from becoming victims before delivery, their relatives place thorny branches around the house. This improvised thorny fence discourages the ''Krasue'' from coming to suck the blood and causing other suffering to the pregnant lady within the house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.budinst.gov.kh/?q=node/180|title=\u179c\u17b7\u1792\u17b8\u179f\u1798\u17d2\u179a\u17b6\u179b\u1780\u17bc\u1793: |accessdate=12 October 2008|publisher=Buddhist Institute}}</ref>\nAfter delivery, the woman's relatives must take the cut placenta far away for burial to hide it from the Krasue. There is the belief that if the placenta is buried deep enough the spirit can not find it.\n<ref name=\"blogspot1\"/>\n\nThe Krasue hides the headless body from which it originates in a quiet place because it needs to join it before daybreak,<ref>[http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_lkyLYGrOd5U/TDnDAU-RklI/AAAAAAAAABM/jFO3SYlj3Dg/s400/%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B7%E0%B8%AD2.bmp Krasue emerging from its body]</ref> living like a normal person during the day, although having a sleepy look.<ref>[http://kkaiki0710.cocolog-nifty.com/blog/2012/03/post-9b42.html Fullmoon Devil]</ref> To crush the still headless body of the krasue is fatal to the spirit. The flying head will return after hunting but rejoin with the wrong body which will lead it to suffer torment until death. If the top part of the body fails to find the lower half before daybreak it will die in terrible pain. The Krasue will also die if its intestines get cut off or if its body disappears or gets hidden by someone. Some folk beliefs hold that the creature can be destroyed by burning it. The main foes of the Krasue are mobs of angry villagers carrying [[torch]]es and [[machete]]s. They may catch the Krasue and kill it or watch where she goes before dawn and destroy her body.\n\nThere is a legend said that the people who are wounded should be aware of the Krasue because it can smell the blood and will come to eat the blood at night when people fall asleep. However, there are ways to prevent the Krasue from coming inside the house. House-owners usually build spiky fences or grow spiky bamboo to protect themselves from the Krasue. Krasue is scared of spiky things because its intestine might get stuck and it could not escape.<ref>3. tumnandd. \u0e1c\u0e35\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d \u0e19\u0e31\u0e01\u0e25\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22\u0e32\u0e21\u0e23\u0e31\u0e15\u0e15\u0e34\u0e01\u0e32\u0e25. tamnandd.com.

The Krasue appears near one side of the factory wall adjacent to the field. When a smartphone's camera was used to take a shot of the CCTV footage in order to zoom at it closer, an old woman living alone in that area was seen in the image. Local people insist that they see strange lights and hear strange sounds at night for about a year. However, when the old woman seen in the image died, sightings of the Krasue reportedly stopped. Asst. Prof. Dr. Chawan Koopipat, an expert in photography and video technology from [[Chulalongkorn University]] checked the CCTV footage and determined that it was not edited. According to the professor, the Krasue in the CCTV footage probably was a result of the lighting, which has movement on the upper part and reflecting on the bottom wet and damp area of the land that was not farmed giving the illusion of a Krasue.<ref name=\"\u0e22\u0e39\u0e17\u0e39\u0e1b\"/>\n* Strange red lights floating up the paddy fields in the area of [[Phachi District]], [[Ayutthaya Province]], near Wat Tako were sighted in mid-June 2014 and was believed to be from a Krasue. Soon after, hundreds of teenagers (in some nights ranging to thousands) flocked in the area reportedly to prove the truth. This has caused damage to this field. The landlord insists that there are no Krasue here and the lights seen were actually a floating lantern bird chaser.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma8aLhCVOpc|title=\u0e1b\u0e32\u0e01\u0e42\u0e1b\u0e49\u0e07 - \u0e27\u0e31\u0e22\u0e23\u0e38\u0e48\u0e19\u0e19\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e22 \u0e41\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e25\u0e48\u0e32\u0e14\u0e27\u0e07\u0e44\u0e1f\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e14\u0e42\u0e1c\u0e25\u0e48\u0e01\u0e25\u0e32\u0e07\u0e17\u0e38\u0e48\u0e07\u0e19\u0e32 \u0e40\u0e0a\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d 1/2|date=23 June 2014|accessdate=19 August 2017|language=thai|website=[[Channel 8 (Thailand)|Channel 8]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyzOyN4mqxA|title=\u0e1b\u0e32\u0e01\u0e42\u0e1b\u0e49\u0e07 - \u0e27\u0e31\u0e22\u0e23\u0e38\u0e48\u0e19\u0e19\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e22 \u0e41\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e25\u0e48\u0e32\u0e14\u0e27\u0e07\u0e44\u0e1f\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e14\u0e42\u0e1c\u0e25\u0e48\u0e01\u0e25\u0e32\u0e07\u0e17\u0e38\u0e48\u0e07\u0e19\u0e32 \u0e40\u0e0a\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d 2/2|date=23 June 2014|accessdate=19 August 2017|language=thai|website=Channel 8}}</ref>\n* In September 2015, one image was shared on online social networks allegedly shot at Ban Phai village, in the area of [[Chae Hom District]], [[Lampang Province]], depicting a Krasue that has guts and internal organs trapped with thorny branches.

However, according to Associate Professor Dr. Sirintornthep Towprayoon, an energy researcher from [[King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi]], the hypothesis that the Krasue is actually burning methane gas particles is impossible because not enough methane is emitted from rotten organic matter to be able to cause an ignition and that even if the methane gas particles did ignited, the burning would be confined to the surface of the organic, flammable matter and will not lead to floating flames that allegedly give the illusion of the Krasue.\nAn anatomical interpretation is that when the head is pulled off from the human body, other organs such as the intestines, heart, and lungs will not come together with the head.<ref name=\"\u0e22\u0e39\u0e17\u0e39\u0e1b\">{{cite web|title=\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e2d\u0e49\u0e2d : \u0e17\u0e49\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e2a\u0e39\u0e08\u0e19\u0e4c\u0e15\u0e33\u0e19\u0e32\u0e19\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d|website=\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e2d\u0e49\u0e2d|url=http://video.sanook.com/player/398603/|language=Thai|date=17 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\nCountries where the Krasue tale is popular have adapted it to film.<ref>[http://tracker.zaerc.com/torrents-details.php?id=8238 Krasue movies]</ref> Several [[Cinema of Thailand|Thai films]] depict this spirit, including 1973 movie ''[[Krasue Sao]]'' (Ghosts of Guts Eater), {{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e27}} with [[Sombat Metanee]], which features a fight between two Krasues,<ref>[http://diedangerdiediekill.blogspot.com/2011/06/ghost-of-guts-eater-thailand-1973.html Ghosts of Guts Eater (Thailand 1973)]</ref> ''[[Itthirit Nam Man Phrai]]'' {{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e17\u0e18\u0e34\u0e24\u0e17\u0e18\u0e34\u0e4c\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e32\u0e22}} made in 1984, with [[Tanid Pongmanoon]] and [[Praew Mardmarud]],<ref>[http://tonpalm.tarad.com/shop/t/tonpalm/img-lib/spd_2011031393404_b.jpg Itthirith Nam Man Phrai (Thailand 1984)]</ref> ''[[Krasue Kat Pop]]'' {{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e31\u0e14\u0e1b\u0e2d\u0e1a}} (1990) with [[Bin Bunluerit]] and [[Trirak Rakkarndee]],<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24V4743fiw8 Krasue Kat Pop (Thailand 1990)]</ref> ''[[Krasue Krahailueat]]'' (Bloodthirsty Krasue), {{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e22\u0e40\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e14}}, made in 1995 with [[Thida Teerarat]],<ref>[http://www.thaifilm.com/imgUpload/reply773761_0.jpg Krasue Krahailueat (Thailand 1995)]</ref> [[Demonic Beauty|''Tamnan Krasue'']] {{lang-th|\u0e15\u0e33\u0e19\u0e32\u0e19\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d}} (Demonic Beauty) released in 2002, ''[[Krasue Valentine]]'' (2006) by [[Yuthlert Sippapak]], ''Krasue'' (The Gluttonous Fear) {{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d}} made in 2007, with [[Jedsada Roongsakorn]] and [[Sirintorn Parnsamutr]],<ref>[http://vcddvd88.com/imgs/cd/fear2.jpg The Gluttonous Fear (Thailand 2007)]</ref> ''[[Krasue Fat Pop]]'' {{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1f\u0e31\u0e14\u0e1b\u0e2d\u0e1a}} (2009) with [[Chutima Naiyana]], in which Krasue fights against [[Phi Pop]],<ref>[http://doopap.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/e0b881e0b8a3e0b8b0e0b8aae0b8b7e0b8ade0b89fe0b8b1e0b894e0b89be0b8ade0b89a.jpg?w=592 Krasue Phat Pop (Thailand 2009)]</ref> and ''[[Fullmoon Devil]]'' (2011) {{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d}} by [[Komson Thripong]].

However, the inception of this demon is likely to be based on a folk lore. In Thailand, Krasue is believed to be a cursed individual (usually a female) who engaged in various sins and fraudulent conducts during her previous life. After she dies, her sins causes her to be reborn as a ''phuti'' ({{lang-th|\u0e20\u0e39\u0e15\u0e34}}) that has to live off wasted, uncooked or rotten food. In recent time, the Thai entertainment industry has fictionalized the origin of Krasue as a cursed ancient Khmer princess, as in [[Demonic Beauty]]'' (2002). ''This depiction is, however, merely an attempt to put a royal touch or to reinvent a mythical beginning to a well-known story of an essentially folk origin, for strictly entertainment and commercial purpose. One critic notes that the director of ''Demonic Beauty'' probably just wanted to depict \"Krasue\" as an evil and an alien demon, originating from the witchcraft and black magic of a foreign (i.e. Cambodian's) pagan culture, which is ultimately subdued and defeated by the more-enlightened [[Buddhist culture]] of Thailand.''<ref>[http://kyotoreview.org/issue-14/tamnan-krasue-constructing-a-khmer-ghost-for-a-thai-film/ Tamnan Krasue]</ref>\n\nThere are other oral traditions that say that this spirit was formerly a rich lady that had a length of black gauze or ribbon tied around the head and neck as protection from the sunshine. This woman was then possessed by an evil spirit and was cursed to become a Krasue. Other popular legends claim that origin of the spirit may have been a woman trying to learn [[black magic]] that made a mistake or used the wrong [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]] so that her head and body became separated. [[Buddhist views on sin|Past sins]] are also related to the transmission of the Krasue curse; women who aborted or killed someone in a previous life will become a Krasue as punishment. Other folk stories talk about a person being cursed to become a Krasue after having consumed food and drink contaminated with a krasue's [[saliva]] or flesh. Popular imagination also claims that the transformation into a Krasue is largely restricted to the relatives of women practicing [[witchcraft]] ''\"Mae Mot\"'' (\u0e41\u0e21\u0e48\u0e21\u0e14) or ''\"Yai Mot\"'' (\u0e22\u0e32\u0e22\u0e21\u0e14), especially their daughters or granddaughters. Often women acting strange in a community are suspected of becoming nightly a Krasue by other members of the village.<ref>[http://loy9.com/en/yeaydul/ Yeay Duol]</ref>\n\n===Description in Thai folklore===\nThe Krasue is under a [[curse]] that makes it ever hungry and always active in the night when it goes out hunting to satisfy its [[gluttony]], seeking blood to drink or raw flesh to devour. It may attack cattle or chicken in the darkness, drinking their blood and eating their internal organs.<ref>[http://taliesinttlg.blogspot.com/2011/06/honourable-mention-ghost-and-master-boh.html Honourable Mention: The Ghost and Master Boh]</ref> It may also prey on pieces of cattle, such as [[water buffalo]] that have died of other causes during the night. If blood is not available the Krasue may eat [[feces]] or [[carrion]].<ref name=\"blogspot1\">[http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_lkyLYGrOd5U/TDnIzUEtWII/AAAAAAAAABU/3Dixe_s_Ins/s400/%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B7%E0%B8%AD3.bmp Krasue feeding]</ref> Clothes left outside would be found soiled with blood and excrement in the morning, allegedly after she had wiped her mouth. Therefore, villagers would not leave clothes hanging to dry outside during the night hours.\n\nThe Krasue also preys on pregnant women in their homes just before or after the [[Birth in Thailand|childbirth]]. It hovers around the house of the pregnant woman uttering sharp cries to instil fear. It uses an elongated proboscis-like tongue<ref>[http://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k247/AMFrank/KRASUE/snapshot20061023170035.jpg Krasue tongue]</ref><ref>[http://i137.photobucket.com/albums/q217/Taliesin_ttlg/krasue/krasue_tongue.jpg Krasue tongue extended]</ref> to reach the [[fetus]] or its [[placenta]] within the womb. This habit, among other unmentionable things that this spirit does, is believed to be the cause of many diseases affecting women mainly in rural areas during their pregnancy. In some cases it may catch the unborn child and use its sharp teeth to devour it.\nIn order to protect pregnant women from becoming victims before delivery, their relatives place thorny branches around the house. This improvised thorny fence discourages the ''Krasue'' from coming to suck the blood and causing other suffering to the pregnant lady within the house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.budinst.gov.kh/?q=node/180|title=\u179c\u17b7\u1792\u17b8\u179f\u1798\u17d2\u179a\u17b6\u179b\u1780\u17bc\u1793: |accessdate=12 October 2008|publisher=Buddhist Institute}}</ref>\nAfter delivery, the woman's relatives must take the cut placenta far away for burial to hide it from the Krasue. There is the belief that if the placenta is buried deep enough the spirit can not find it.\n<ref name=\"blogspot1\"/>\n\nThe Krasue hides the headless body from which it originates in a quiet place because it needs to join it before daybreak,<ref>[http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_lkyLYGrOd5U/TDnDAU-RklI/AAAAAAAAABM/jFO3SYlj3Dg/s400/%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B7%E0%B8%AD2.bmp Krasue emerging from its body]</ref> living like a normal person during the day, although having a sleepy look.<ref>[http://kkaiki0710.cocolog-nifty.com/blog/2012/03/post-9b42.html Fullmoon Devil]</ref> To crush the still headless body of the krasue is fatal to the spirit. The flying head will return after hunting but rejoin with the wrong body which will lead it to suffer torment until death. If the top part of the body fails to find the lower half before daybreak it will die in terrible pain. The Krasue will also die if its intestines get cut off or if its body disappears or gets hidden by someone. Some folk beliefs hold that the creature can be destroyed by burning it. The main foes of the Krasue are mobs of angry villagers carrying [[torch]]es and [[machete]]s. They may catch the Krasue and kill it or watch where she goes before dawn and destroy her body.\n\nThere is a legend said that the people who are wounded should be aware of the Krasue because it can smell the blood and will come to eat the blood at night when people fall asleep. However, there are ways to prevent the Krasue from coming inside the house. House-owners usually build spiky fences or grow spiky bamboo to protect themselves from the Krasue. Krasue is scared of spiky things because its intestine might get stuck and it could not escape.<ref>3. tumnandd. \u0e1c\u0e35\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d \u0e19\u0e31\u0e01\u0e25\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22\u0e32\u0e21\u0e23\u0e31\u0e15\u0e15\u0e34\u0e01\u0e32\u0e25. tamnandd.com.

The Krasue appears near one side of the factory wall adjacent to the field. When a smartphone's camera was used to take a shot of the CCTV footage in order to zoom at it closer, an old woman living alone in that area was seen in the image. Local people insist that they see strange lights and hear strange sounds at night for about a year. However, when the old woman seen in the image died, sightings of the Krasue reportedly stopped. Asst. Prof. Dr. Chawan Koopipat, an expert in photography and video technology from [[Chulalongkorn University]] checked the CCTV footage and determined that it was not edited. According to the professor, the Krasue in the CCTV footage probably was a result of the lighting, which has movement on the upper part and reflecting on the bottom wet and damp area of the land that was not farmed giving the illusion of a Krasue.<ref name=\"\u0e22\u0e39\u0e17\u0e39\u0e1b\"/>\n* Strange red lights floating up the paddy fields in the area of [[Phachi District]], [[Ayutthaya Province]], near Wat Tako were sighted in mid-June 2014 and was believed to be from a Krasue.

[interv.] Sorayutt Sututsanajinda. 21 January 2013.</ref>\n\n==Scientific explanation==\nA possible scientific explanation is that Krasue sightings are caused by blazing flames from methane gas particles emitted from rotten organic matters such as found in farms and fields, where Krasue sightings are commonly reported. However, according to Associate Professor Dr. Sirintornthep Towprayoon, an energy researcher from [[King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi]], the hypothesis that the Krasue is actually burning methane gas particles is impossible because not enough methane is emitted from rotten organic matter to be able to cause an ignition and that even if the methane gas particles did ignited, the burning would be confined to the surface of the organic, flammable matter and will not lead to floating flames that allegedly give the illusion of the Krasue.\nAn anatomical interpretation is that when the head is pulled off from the human body, other organs such as the intestines, heart, and lungs will not come together with the head.<ref name=\"\u0e22\u0e39\u0e17\u0e39\u0e1b\">{{cite web|title=\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e2d\u0e49\u0e2d : \u0e17\u0e49\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e2a\u0e39\u0e08\u0e19\u0e4c\u0e15\u0e33\u0e19\u0e32\u0e19\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d|website=\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e2d\u0e49\u0e2d|url=http://video.sanook.com/player/398603/|language=Thai|date=17 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\nCountries where the Krasue tale is popular have adapted it to film.<ref>[http://tracker.zaerc.com/torrents-details.php?id=8238 Krasue movies]</ref> Several [[Cinema of Thailand|Thai films]] depict this spirit, including 1973 movie ''[[Krasue Sao]]'' (Ghosts of Guts Eater), {{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e27}} with [[Sombat Metanee]], which features a fight between two Krasues,<ref>[http://diedangerdiediekill.blogspot.com/2011/06/ghost-of-guts-eater-thailand-1973.html Ghosts of Guts Eater (Thailand 1973)]</ref> ''[[Itthirit Nam Man Phrai]]'' {{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e17\u0e18\u0e34\u0e24\u0e17\u0e18\u0e34\u0e4c\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e32\u0e22}} made in 1984, with [[Tanid Pongmanoon]] and [[Praew Mardmarud]],<ref>[http://tonpalm.tarad.com/shop/t/tonpalm/img-lib/spd_2011031393404_b.jpg Itthirith Nam Man Phrai (Thailand 1984)]</ref> ''[[Krasue Kat Pop]]'' {{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e31\u0e14\u0e1b\u0e2d\u0e1a}} (1990) with [[Bin Bunluerit]] and [[Trirak Rakkarndee]],<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24V4743fiw8 Krasue Kat Pop (Thailand 1990)]</ref> ''[[Krasue Krahailueat]]'' (Bloodthirsty Krasue), {{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e22\u0e40\u0e25\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e14}}, made in 1995 with [[Thida Teerarat]],<ref>[http://www.thaifilm.com/imgUpload/reply773761_0.jpg Krasue Krahailueat (Thailand 1995)]</ref> [[Demonic Beauty|''Tamnan Krasue'']] {{lang-th|\u0e15\u0e33\u0e19\u0e32\u0e19\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d}} (Demonic Beauty) released in 2002, ''[[Krasue Valentine]]'' (2006) by [[Yuthlert Sippapak]], ''Krasue'' (The Gluttonous Fear) {{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d}} made in 2007, with [[Jedsada Roongsakorn]] and [[Sirintorn Parnsamutr]],<ref>[http://vcddvd88.com/imgs/cd/fear2.jpg The Gluttonous Fear (Thailand 2007)]</ref> ''[[Krasue Fat Pop]]'' {{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1f\u0e31\u0e14\u0e1b\u0e2d\u0e1a}} (2009) with [[Chutima Naiyana]], in which Krasue fights against [[Phi Pop]],<ref>[http://doopap.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/e0b881e0b8a3e0b8b0e0b8aae0b8b7e0b8ade0b89fe0b8b1e0b894e0b89be0b8ade0b89a.jpg?w=592 Krasue Phat Pop (Thailand 2009)]</ref> and ''[[Fullmoon Devil]]'' (2011) {{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d}} by [[Komson Thripong]].
