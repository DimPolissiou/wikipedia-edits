After a brief discussion, [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] is nominated by just his best friend Neil Goldman. At home, Chris announces the news to [[Lois Griffin|Lois]], [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], to Lois' concern. The next day, Chris unexpectedly wins the election, much to the surprise of Lois, Brian, and Stewie, who had come to console him after he lost.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Drunken Clam, [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] leaves for a moment to go to the bathroom. [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], Joe, and [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] head out, leaving Cleveland to pay the bill for the boys. Cleveland complains to Jerome, and they bond over more drinks. Later, Cleveland ditches his friends to hang out with Jerome, surprising them. Wanting to get Cleveland back, they decide to try and win him back through antics such as dancing foolishly on his lawn. All of these efforts are met with failure as Cleveland continues to spend time with Jerome.\n\nAt home, Lois and Peter give Chris plenty of respect and congratulations for his success, causing him to act like a King. [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] however is skeptical about the votes, saying that they are part of an elaborate prank by the popular students, on account of the high school's liking of \"making unpopular kids look stupid\". Brian and Stewie go to the school to clarify this. They attempt to disguise themselves and sneak in, but Brian gets distracted by two attractive teen girls and is subsequently thrown out of the school. At night, they see a news story about Chris, 'a big guy with a heart of dreams', becoming homecoming king, and realize after hearing his interviewed classmates responses that he was elected because they pitied him upon knowing of his \"records\". When Chris comes home he continues to believe he is a King of high importance and power, much to Stewie and Brian's irritation. The next day, an exasperated Brian reveals the truth to a skeptical Chris.\n\nAfter Peter, Joe, and Quagmire unsuccessfully attempt a third method to get Cleveland back, they address the idea that Cleveland may be hanging out with Jerome because they're both black people. They head to the Brown house dressed like famous black people to win Cleveland back, but he reveals that he is still angry about the unsettled bar tab he was stuck with and feels Jerome is a better friend. That night, Cleveland tells Jerome of the guys' theory and learns that there's some truth behind it, as Jerome personally considers Cleveland boring but feels a connection to him because of their shared race nonetheless.\n\nBrian and Stewie attend the homecoming dance after Stewie realizes that they were a little too harsh on him and should support him anyway. Principal Shepherd introduces Chris as the prom king. However, when Chris steps up to give another bizarre speech, his classmates give sympathetic comments. And when Principal Shepard introduces the Homecoming Queen, which turns out to be a memorial to a girl who died in a car accident, it dawns on him that they merely elected him because they thought he was mentally challenged just like his father and wanted him to feel good about himself. Outside the school, Chris reconciles with Stewie and Brian, having learned from the experience that he doesn't need pity, just support from his family and friends.\n\nAfter reuniting and patching things up with his friends at the Griffins' house, Cleveland plays ''[[Double Dribble (video game)|Double Dribble]]'' with Peter, where they score on each other by taking advantage of a glitch.

It first aired, on [[BBC Two]], on 28 February 2017. The episode was written by the programme's creators, [[Steve Pemberton]] and [[Reece Shearsmith]], and directed by [[Guillem Morales]]. \"The Riddle of the Sphinx\", which is set in [[Cambridge]], stars [[Alexandra Roach]] as Nina, a young woman seeking answers to the ''[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]'' [[cryptic crossword]], Pemberton as Professor Nigel Squires, who [[pseudonymously]] sets the crossword using the name [[the Sphinx|''Sphinx'']], and Shearsmith as Dr Jacob Tyler, another Cambridge academic. The story begins with Nina surreptitiously entering Squires's rooms on a stormy night and being discovered; this leads to Squires teaching her how to decipher clues in cryptic crosswords.\n\nThe plot of \"The Riddle of the Sphinx\" revolves around the clues and answers to a particular crossword puzzle. The idea to focus an episode on crosswords came from Pemberton; he had long been a fan of cryptic crosswords, but particular inspiration came from ''Two Girls, One on Each Knee: The Puzzling, Playful World of the Crossword'', a non-fiction book by [[Alan Connor]]. The crossword featured in \"The Riddle of the Sphinx\" was set by Pemberton, and was published in ''[[The Guardian]]'' on the day the episode aired, credited to \"Sphinx\". This crossword contains multiple ninas\u2014hidden messages or words. Along with many of the crossword's answers, one nina is integral to the episode's plot. A second was introduced accidentally, and then incorporated into the episode. A third nina is an ''Inside No. 9'' [[in-joke]].\n\nInfluences for \"The Riddle of the Sphinx\", which emphasises [[gothic fiction|gothicism]] over [[comedy]], include [[Anthony Shaffer (writer)|Anthony Shaffer]]'s 1970 play ''[[Sleuth (play)|Sleuth]]'', the work of [[Anton Chekhov]], and the 1989 film ''[[The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover]]''. Critics responded extremely positively to the episode, lauding its writing and the precise attention to detail in the production. Commentators noted that the episode was very dark, and probably the cleverest episode of ''Inside No. 9'' to date. Roach's performance was praised, as was the direction of Morales.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Reece Shearsmith.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A smiling man in a black shirt|[[Reece Shearsmith]] ''(pictured, 2003)'' co-wrote \"The Riddle of the Sphinx\" and stars as Dr Jacob Tyler]]\nThe third series of ''[[Inside No. 9]]'' was announced in October 2015, and heavily publicised in January 2016, at which time [[Alexandra Roach]] was named as a guest star in the series.<ref>{{cite news|title=Inside No. 9 gets a third series|publisher=[[RadioTimes.com]]|accessdate=19 March 2017|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-10-21/inside-no-9-gets-a-third-series|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224200732/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-10-21/inside-no-9-gets-a-third-series|archivedate=24 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Dowell, Ben|date=20 January 2016|title=Keeley Hawes and Jessica Raine to star in the new series of Inside No. 9|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-01-20/keeley-hawes-and-jessica-raine-to-star-in-the-new-series-of-inside-no-9|publisher=[[RadioTimes.com]]|accessdate=19 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224200742/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-01-20/keeley-hawes-and-jessica-raine-to-star-in-the-new-series-of-inside-no-9|archivedate=24 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Travis, Ben|date=20 January 2016|title=Inside No 9: Keeley Hawes, Philip Glenister, and Morgana Robinson confirmed as Series 3 starts shooting|newspaper=[[Evening Standard]]|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/inside-no-9-keeley-hawes-philip-glenister-and-morgana-robinson-confirmed-as-series-3-starts-shooting-a3160831.html|accessdate=19 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327025629/http://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/inside-no-9-keeley-hawes-philip-glenister-and-morgana-robinson-confirmed-as-series-3-starts-shooting-a3160831.html|archivedate=27 March 2017}}</ref> The series began with the Christmas special \"[[The Devil of Christmas]]\" (December 2016) and continued with \"[[The Bill (Inside No. 9)|The Bill]]\" (February 2017), the latter of which was the first of a run of five episodes, of which \"The Riddle of the Sphinx\" was the second.<ref>{{cite news|author=Doran, Sarah|date=27 December 2016|title=When is the next series of Inside No. 9 on TV?|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-12-27/when-is-the-next-series-of-inside-no-9-on-tv|publisher=[[RadioTimes.com]]|accessdate=19 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418162603/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-12-27/when-is-the-next-series-of-inside-no-9-on-tv|archivedate=18 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Newall, Sally|date=27 December 2016|title=TV review: The Real Marigold On Tour and Inside No.9: The Devil of Christmas|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/real-marigold-on-tour-inside-number-nine-bbc2-a7495626.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=13 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308163959/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/real-marigold-on-tour-inside-number-nine-bbc2-a7495626.html|archivedate=8 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Holland, Luke|date=21 February 2017|title=Tuesday\u2019s best TV \u2013 The Drug Trial: Emergency at the Hospital, Inside No 9; Inside No 9|publisher=[[theguardian.com]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/21/tuesdays-best-tv-the-drug-trial-emergency-at-the-hospital-inside-no-9|accessdate=8 April 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407001403/https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/21/tuesdays-best-tv-the-drug-trial-emergency-at-the-hospital-inside-no-9|archivedate=7 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=7 worth staying in for|newspaper=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|date=18 February 2017|page=31}}</ref> The episode was first aired on 28 February 2017.

Most of the episode was filmed in [[Langleybury]], a country house in [[Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire]], which had previous been used for the ''Inside No. 9'' episodes \"[[The Harrowing (Inside No. 9)|The Harrowing]]\" and \"[[S\u00e9ance Time]]\", as well as the house of Oscar Lomax in the Shearsmith and Pemberton television series ''[[Psychoville]]''. The [[Establishing shot|opening exterior shot]] was filmed in a [[quad (architecture)|court]] of [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]].<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> The idea to set the episode during a storm, which gave it a [[gothic fiction|gothic]] quality, was Morales's. For Shearsmith and Pemberton, this was an example of an advantage to having a third party direct episodes, in contrast to \"[[Cold Comfort (Inside No. 9)|Cold Comfort]]\" and \"[[Nana's Party]]\" from the second series, which they had directed themselves.<ref name=\"Mellor interview\"/> Close-up shots of the crossword and the blackboard were filmed later, some on the set of \"[[Private View (Inside No. 9)|Private View]]\", which introduced potential [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] problems.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> The episode was filmed after two days' rehearsals. The script was 32 pages in length, resulting in a first cut that was 38 minutes long. The BBC permitted the final version to be a little longer than the half hour typical of ''Inside No. 9'', but the production team still needed to lose several minutes in the edit.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> The final run-time for the episode is 31 minutes and 35 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inside No.9 [Season 3, The Riddle of the Sphinx]|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/inside-no9-video-15|publisher=[[British Board of Film Classification]]|accessdate=18 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319011213/http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/inside-no9-video-15|archivedate=19 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n\"The Riddle of the Sphinx\" was characterised by Pemberton as a [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] in the style of [[Anthony Shaffer (writer)|Anthony Shaffer]]'s 1970 play ''[[Sleuth (play)|Sleuth]]'',<ref name=\"Empire\"/> while Shearsmith identified the episode as particularly theatrical, in the style of ''Sleuth'' and [[Ira Levin]]'s 1978 play ''[[Deathtrap (play)|Deathtrap]]''.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> BBC executives, according to Shearsmith, saw the episode as a cross between ''Sleuth'' and [[Willy Russell]]'s 1980 play ''[[Educating Rita]]'' that read as if it had been authored by [[psychopathy|psychopaths]].<ref name=\"Empire\"/> The [[executive producer]] [[Jon Plowman]] suggested that the first half of the episode plays out like a [[radio play]]. The word-play and tea-drinking in this part of the episode are, in the writers' opinion, very English; the episode then changes character. Civilisation is \"stripped away\", resulting in the episode having the elements of a [[Greek tragedy]].<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> A further inspiration was the 1989 film ''[[The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover]]''; at the end of the episode, Squires faces a situation that mirrors one faced by [[Michael Gambon]]'s Albert Spica.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/>\n\nAn initial idea for the plot saw only two characters, but a third, for the writers, introduced a compelling dynamic; keeping the cast small also served to keep production costs relatively low.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> The episode stars Roach as Nina, Pemberton as Professor Nigel Squires\u2014whose name is a reference to the crossword setter [[Roger Squires]]<ref name=\"Commentary\"/>\u2014and Shearsmith as Dr Jacob Tyler.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Inside No.9 \u2013 The Riddle Of The Sphinx|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2017/09/inside-no-9|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 April 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319011214/http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2017/09/inside-no-9|archivedate=19 March 2018}}</ref> Roach and Shearsmith had previously collaborated on the television programme ''[[Hunderby]]''.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> Roach said in an interview before the episode's airing that she is drawn to darker scripts; she said that she loves ''Inside No. 9'', describing the episodes as \"very gruesome, psychological thrillers, [which] always have great twists\".<ref name=\"Monks\"/> She described Nina as highly [[naivete|naive]].<ref name=\"Monks\">{{Cite news|author=Monks, Rebecca|date=24 January 2017|title=Alexandra Roach on No Offence, male dominated TV and Inside No. 9|url=https://inews.co.uk/essentials/culture/television/alexandra-roach-no-offence-male-dominated-tv-inside-no9/|publisher=[[inews.co.uk]]|accessdate=7 May 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170505230047/https://inews.co.uk/essentials/culture/television/alexandra-roach-no-offence-male-dominated-tv-inside-no9/|archivedate=5 May 2017}}</ref> Two [[body double|doubles]] were used in the episode in place of Roach.

Subsequently, he received a copy of Connor's book.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> Reading ''Two Girls, One on Each Knee'' led Pemberton to ask whether one could \"dramatize doing a crossword, which is so un-dramatic?\"<ref name=\"Commentary\"/><ref name=\"BCG interview\"/><ref name=\"sadists\"/> Pemberton explained that he and Shearsmith relish the challenge set by writing limitations, such as basing an episode around a crossword. Such constraints, he felt, encourage them to produce their best work.<ref name=\"Mellor interview\"/>\n\nWith assistance from Connor, Pemberton compiled the crossword around which the episode revolves.<ref name=\"Connor\"/> Connor was credited as the episode's \"Crossword consultant\"; further assistance was provided by [[Hugh Stephenson]], crossword editor for ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> The puzzle contains a range of themed entries and ninas\u2014hidden words or messages\u2014making it a particularly challenging crossword for a first-time designer. Pemberton began with ''ISWAPPEDCUPS'', the key nina, and two of the long themed words (''PUFFERFISH'' and ''ASPHYXIATION''). He then experimented with remaining clues, and was able to include ''MYSTERYGUEST'', ''KNOWITALL'', ''UNDERSLIP'' and ''NEUN''. The episode's second nina was created accidentally and seen at the last minute; by introducing a middle name for Pemberton's character, the writers were able to make it a part of the plot.<ref name=\"Connor\"/> At least one of the clues used in the episode\u2014Squires's improvised \"I teach wild creature without hospital building\", resulting in ''ARCHITECTURE''\u2014was not a good one. This was acknowledged by Squires in the episode, but was kept in as it reflected Squires's view of his own actions.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/>\n\nPemberton hoped that \"The Riddle of the Sphinx\" would work as a mini-tutorial for cryptic crosswords. Shearsmith, meanwhile, had never attempted a cryptic crossword before working on the episode, but has subsequently started completing them.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> Nonetheless, Pemberton acknowledged that not everyone enjoys crosswords, hence \"I always hated cryptic crosswords. Why can't people just say what they mean instead of trying to trick you all the time?\" from Shearsmith's Tyler.<ref name=\"Connor\"/> In an interview with Connor, published after \"The Riddle of the Sphinx\" had aired, Pemberton explored the ways in which writing for ''Inside No. 9'' was like writing for a cryptic crossword; in both cases, misdirection is key and utterly arbitrary choices or happenings can serve as important inspirations.<ref name=\"Connor\"/>\n\nIn the [[Audio commentary|DVD commentary]] for the episode, Shearsmith and Pemberton expressed a hope that Pemberton's crossword could be published before the episode's airing, so that viewers would be able to watch the episode having unknowingly already completed the crossword around which it revolves.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> Pemberton's crossword was published in ''The Guardian'' on the same day that the episode aired, credited to \"Sphinx\";<ref name=\"Connor\"/> for one critic, this explained and justified the answer ''MYSTERYGUEST''.<ref name=\"Wallaston\"/> The collaboration between ''Inside No. 9'' and ''The Guardian'' drew inspiration from the collaboration between ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'' for \"[[Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words]]\" in 2008. Pemberton dedicated the crossword, which was his first in print, to the late [[Kenny Ireland]]. The two of them had completed the ''Guardian'' crossword daily while filming together for the television comedy ''[[Benidorm (TV series)|Benidorm]]''.<ref name=\"Connor\"/> Allowing a one-off contribution from a non-regular setter was deeply unusual for ''The Guardian'', whose crosswords are normally produced by one of about 25 regular setters.<ref>{{cite news|title=On setters and setting|publisher=[[theguardian.com]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2017/apr/30/on-setters-and-setting|date=30 April 2017|accessdate=14 March 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213032001/https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2017/apr/30/on-setters-and-setting|archivedate=13 February 2018}}</ref> Pemberton, again writing as ''Sphinx'', went on to publish a further cryptic crossword in ''The Guardian'' in 2018, during the airing of the fourth series of ''Inside No. 9''.

He is holding a gun, but it is not loaded. Nina's boyfriend Simon is a fan of cryptic crosswords, but she is never able to help him. She has come to the rooms of Squires\u2014a [[classicist]] who sets crosswords for ''[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]'' as ''the Sphinx''\u2014to seek the answers to the next day's crossword. Squires sets about to teach Nina: \"I teach wild creature without hospital building\" results in ''ARCHITECTURE'', which Simon studies. They turn to the clues for the next day, beginning to fill a large grid. Squires uses the name of the [[Sphinx]] because she would asphyxiate and consume those who failed to answer her riddle: she was, he says, \"devious and deadly\". Squires makes tea, as Nina looks to his trophies. A picture of Squires with his late wife draws her attention, and they discuss the cut-throat world of competitive crosswording. Nina has answered ''DOWNANDOUT'' and ''WRAP''; Squires answers ''DESI'' and helps with ''TRENT''. Squires asks about Simon, but catches Nina in a lie; her excuse is that she only wants to learn. Together, they deduce ''SWAMPLANDS'', meaning \"bog\". Nina, though, suggests that it should be ''bogs'', otherwise Squires would be cheating. Suddenly spluttering, Squires takes a seat, as Nina begins on the next clue. She now displays clear proficiency, answering ''ASPHYXIATION''.\n\nSquires drops his cup, as Nina continues to fill in the crossword, including ''[[Mr. Sowerberry|SOWERBERRY]]'' and ''KNOWITALL''. Squires is apparently paralysed in his chair, watching. Nina is a [[marine biologist]], and has acquired [[tetrodotoxin]] from a [[pufferfish]], which causes [[paralysis]] and [[asphyxiation]]. Simon was actually Nina's brother, and is visible on the photo of Squires and his wife. Simon had reached a crosswording final only to be beaten by Squires after the latter challenged that a ''u'' looked more like a ''v''. Depressed by the defeat, Simon had killed himself. Squires, to Nina's shock, is unharmed. He leaps up to fill out ''NEUN'' and ''ASPS'', revealing the nina ''ISWAPPEDCUPS'' within the crossword. As Nina induces vomiting, Squires makes a phone call. He had been warned by Dr Jacob Tyler, an old friend and Nina's [[Supervisor#Academia|supervisor]]. Squires places Nina\u2014for whom paralysis is setting in\u2014on a chair, and goes back to the crossword, filling out ''UNDERSLIP''; asking about the underwear young women wear, he slides his hand up Nina's skirt and kisses her on the mouth.\n\nNina is left alone until Tyler enters. He tells Charlotte\u2014\"Nina\"\u2014to hang on, before turning to the crossword. With Squires, he works out ''MYSTERYGUEST''. Tyler reveals that he has no antidote for Charlotte, and will not call the emergency services. Instead, he wants Squires to eat Charlotte, as the Sphinx would. Tyler tells Squires that he cannot call the police, as the crossword displays [[premeditation]]: the ''KNOWITALL'' received a ''MYSTERYGUEST'' at number ''NEUN'', resulting in ''ASPHYXIATION''. Tyler reveals ''PUFFERFISH'', predicting, with reference to crossword answers, that a ''DOWN AND OUT'' will find Charlotte wrapped in her ''UNDERSLIP'' in ''SWAMPLANDS'', incriminating Squires. This is, Tyler says, his revenge.\n\nTyler cuts from Charlotte's buttocks, frying a strip of her flesh on a stove. Squires tells of how he began an affair with Monica, Tyler's wife and mother of his twin children, destroying Tyler's career. Tyler hands Squires the flesh; he eats, fearing Charlotte will die. Tyler reveals that he hates cryptic crosswords, and how his son entered the Cambridge Crossword Competition, attempting to beat his mother's new husband: Squires. Squires realises that Charlotte is Tyler's daughter. Charlotte and Tyler sought revenge on Squires, but Tyler changed plans so Squires would include clues in the crossword. However, Simon's [[autopsy]]\u2014Tyler explains\u2014revealed that Simon and Charlotte were actually Squires's children, meaning Monica and Squires's relationship began earlier than he previously thought. Charlotte is past saving, and Tyler places a bullet on Squires's desk, reminding Squires of the principle of [[Chekhov's gun]]. Squires confirms that his middle name is ''Hector'' as he weeps over Charlotte, and Tyler circles something on the crossword. Charlotte is dead, and Squires loads the gun, placing it in his mouth. Blood splatters over the crossword and a second nina: ''RIPNHS''.\n\n==Analysis==\n[[File:Inside No 9 crossword ninas revealed.jpg|frame|alt=A completed crossword puzzle|Sphinx's completed crossword as it appeared on [[theguardian.com]] with the three ninas highlighted: ''ISWAPPEDCUPS'' (red), ''RIPNHS'' (blue) and ''ONELEPUS'' (yellow)]]\n\"The Riddle of the Sphinx\" is less comedic than many episodes of ''Inside No. 9'',<ref name=\"Mulkern\"/> drawing upon [[gothic horror|gothic]] themes.<ref name=\"Mellor interview\"/><ref name=\"Chortle\"/><ref name=\"sadists\"/> Several critics identified ''Sleuth''\u2014\"a grandfather of sorts\" to ''Inside No. 9''\u2014as a key influence.<ref name=\"Mellor\"/><ref name=\"Mulkern\"/><ref name=\"Dessau\"/> [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', the 1973 horror film ''[[Theatre of Blood]]'', and the work of [[Anton Chekhov]] were also identified as possible influences.<ref name=\"Dessau\"/> Chekhov and his work are referenced in the episode; [[Chekhov's gun]] is referred to in the closing seconds, while Squires identifies the gun in the episode as from a production of ''[[The Seagull]]'', which was authored by Chekhov. This play, like \"The Riddle of Sphinx\", features a character named Nina and a gunshot suicide.<ref name=\"Mellor\"/> Mark Butler, writing for [[inews.co.uk]], noted the references to [[Greek tragedy]], arguing that the episode \"followed a long tradition of [[grotesque]] dramatic reveals\".<ref name=\"Butler\"/>\n\n''[[Al Hirschfeld#Nina|Nina]]'', as well as being the name of a character in the episode, is a name given by cruciverbalists\u2014crossword enthusiasts\u2014to hidden messages in crosswords, such as Squires's ''ISWAPPEDCUPS''.<ref name=\"Mellor\"/><ref name=\"Connor\"/> The character of Nina is reminiscent of [[Eliza Doolittle]], with Squires acting as Henry Higgins.

It first aired, on [[BBC Two]], on 28 February 2017. The episode was written by the programme's creators, [[Steve Pemberton]] and [[Reece Shearsmith]], and directed by [[Guillem Morales]]. \"The Riddle of the Sphinx\", which is set in [[Cambridge]], stars [[Alexandra Roach]] as Nina, a young woman seeking answers to the ''[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]'' [[cryptic crossword]], Pemberton as Professor Nigel Squires, who [[pseudonymously]] sets the crossword using the name [[the Sphinx|''Sphinx'']], and Shearsmith as Dr Jacob Tyler, another Cambridge academic. The story begins with Nina surreptitiously entering Squires's rooms on a stormy night and being discovered; this leads to Squires teaching her how to decipher clues in cryptic crosswords.\n\nThe plot of \"The Riddle of the Sphinx\" revolves around the clues and answers to a particular crossword puzzle. The idea to focus an episode on crosswords came from Pemberton; he had long been a fan of cryptic crosswords, but particular inspiration came from ''Two Girls, One on Each Knee: The Puzzling, Playful World of the Crossword'', a non-fiction book by [[Alan Connor]]. The crossword featured in \"The Riddle of the Sphinx\" was set by Pemberton, and was published in ''[[The Guardian]]'' on the day the episode aired, credited to \"Sphinx\". This crossword contains multiple ninas\u2014hidden messages or words. Along with many of the crossword's answers, one nina is integral to the episode's plot. A second was introduced accidentally, and then incorporated into the episode. A third nina is an ''Inside No. 9'' [[in-joke]].\n\nInfluences for \"The Riddle of the Sphinx\", which emphasises [[gothic fiction|gothicism]] over [[comedy]], include [[Anthony Shaffer (writer)|Anthony Shaffer]]'s 1970 play ''[[Sleuth (play)|Sleuth]]'', the work of [[Anton Chekhov]], and the 1989 film ''[[The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover]]''. Critics responded extremely positively to the episode, lauding its writing and the precise attention to detail in the production. Commentators noted that the episode was very dark, and probably the cleverest episode of ''Inside No. 9'' to date. Roach's performance was praised, as was the direction of Morales.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Reece Shearsmith.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A smiling man in a black shirt|[[Reece Shearsmith]] ''(pictured, 2003)'' co-wrote \"The Riddle of the Sphinx\" and stars as Dr Jacob Tyler]]\nThe third series of ''[[Inside No. 9]]'' was announced in October 2015, and heavily publicised in January 2016, at which time [[Alexandra Roach]] was named as a guest star in the series.<ref>{{cite news|title=Inside No. 9 gets a third series|publisher=[[RadioTimes.com]]|accessdate=19 March 2017|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-10-21/inside-no-9-gets-a-third-series|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224200732/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-10-21/inside-no-9-gets-a-third-series|archivedate=24 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Dowell, Ben|date=20 January 2016|title=Keeley Hawes and Jessica Raine to star in the new series of Inside No. 9|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-01-20/keeley-hawes-and-jessica-raine-to-star-in-the-new-series-of-inside-no-9|publisher=[[RadioTimes.com]]|accessdate=19 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224200742/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-01-20/keeley-hawes-and-jessica-raine-to-star-in-the-new-series-of-inside-no-9|archivedate=24 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Travis, Ben|date=20 January 2016|title=Inside No 9: Keeley Hawes, Philip Glenister, and Morgana Robinson confirmed as Series 3 starts shooting|newspaper=[[Evening Standard]]|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/inside-no-9-keeley-hawes-philip-glenister-and-morgana-robinson-confirmed-as-series-3-starts-shooting-a3160831.html|accessdate=19 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327025629/http://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/inside-no-9-keeley-hawes-philip-glenister-and-morgana-robinson-confirmed-as-series-3-starts-shooting-a3160831.html|archivedate=27 March 2017}}</ref> The series began with the Christmas special \"[[The Devil of Christmas]]\" (December 2016) and continued with \"[[The Bill (Inside No. 9)|The Bill]]\" (February 2017), the latter of which was the first of a run of five episodes, of which \"The Riddle of the Sphinx\" was the second.<ref>{{cite news|author=Doran, Sarah|date=27 December 2016|title=When is the next series of Inside No. 9 on TV?|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-12-27/when-is-the-next-series-of-inside-no-9-on-tv|publisher=[[RadioTimes.com]]|accessdate=19 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418162603/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-12-27/when-is-the-next-series-of-inside-no-9-on-tv|archivedate=18 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Newall, Sally|date=27 December 2016|title=TV review: The Real Marigold On Tour and Inside No.9: The Devil of Christmas|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/real-marigold-on-tour-inside-number-nine-bbc2-a7495626.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=13 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308163959/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/real-marigold-on-tour-inside-number-nine-bbc2-a7495626.html|archivedate=8 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Holland, Luke|date=21 February 2017|title=Tuesday\u2019s best TV \u2013 The Drug Trial: Emergency at the Hospital, Inside No 9; Inside No 9|publisher=[[theguardian.com]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/21/tuesdays-best-tv-the-drug-trial-emergency-at-the-hospital-inside-no-9|accessdate=8 April 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407001403/https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/21/tuesdays-best-tv-the-drug-trial-emergency-at-the-hospital-inside-no-9|archivedate=7 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=7 worth staying in for|newspaper=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|date=18 February 2017|page=31}}</ref> The episode was first aired on 28 February 2017.

Most of the episode was filmed in [[Langleybury]], a country house in [[Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire]], which had previous been used for the ''Inside No. 9'' episodes \"[[The Harrowing (Inside No. 9)|The Harrowing]]\" and \"[[S\u00e9ance Time]]\", as well as the house of Oscar Lomax in the Shearsmith and Pemberton television series ''[[Psychoville]]''. The [[Establishing shot|opening exterior shot]] was filmed in a [[quad (architecture)|court]] of [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]].<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> The idea to set the episode during a storm, which gave it a [[gothic fiction|gothic]] quality, was Morales's. For Shearsmith and Pemberton, this was an example of an advantage to having a third party direct episodes, in contrast to \"[[Cold Comfort (Inside No. 9)|Cold Comfort]]\" and \"[[Nana's Party]]\" from the second series, which they had directed themselves.<Ref name=\"Mellor interview\"/> Close-up shots of the crossword and the blackboard were filmed later, some on the set of \"[[Private View (Inside No. 9)|Private View]]\", which introduced potential [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] problems.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> The episode was filmed after two days' rehearsals. The script was 32 pages in length, resulting in a first cut that was 38 minutes long. The BBC permitted the final version to be a little longer than the half hour typical of ''Inside No. 9'', but the production team still needed to lose several minutes in the edit.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> The final run-time for the episode is 31 minutes and 35 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inside No.9 [Season 3, The Riddle of the Sphinx]|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/inside-no9-video-15|publisher=[[British Board of Film Classification]]|accessdate=18 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319011213/http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/inside-no9-video-15|archivedate=19 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n\"The Riddle of the Sphinx\" was characterised by Pemberton as a [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] in the style of [[Anthony Shaffer (writer)|Anthony Shaffer]]'s 1970 play ''[[Sleuth (play)|Sleuth]]'',<ref name=\"Empire\"/> while Shearsmith identified the episode as particularly theatrical, in the style of ''Sleuth'' and [[Ira Levin]]'s 1978 play ''[[Deathtrap (play)|Deathtrap]]''.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> BBC executives, according to Shearsmith, saw the episode as a cross between ''Sleuth'' and [[Willy Russell]]'s 1980 play ''[[Educating Rita]]'' that read as if it had been authored by [[psychopathy|psychopaths]].<ref name=\"Empire\"/> The [[executive producer]] [[Jon Plowman]] suggested that the first half of the episode plays out like a [[radio play]]. The word-play and tea-drinking in this part of the episode are, in the writers' opinion, very English; the episode then changes character. Civilisation is \"stripped away\", resulting in the episode having the elements of a [[Greek tragedy]].<Ref name=\"Commentary\"/> A further inspiration was the 1989 film ''[[The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover]]''; at the end of the episode, Squires faces a situation that mirrors one faced by [[Michael Gambon]]'s Albert Spica.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/>\n\nAn initial idea for the plot saw only two characters, but a third, for the writers, introduced a compelling dynamic; keeping the cast small also served to keep production costs relatively low.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> The episode stars Roach as Nina, Pemberton as Professor Nigel Squires\u2014whose name is a reference to the crossword setter [[Roger Squires]]<ref name=\"Commentary\"/>\u2014and Shearsmith as Dr Jacob Tyler.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Inside No.9 \u2013 The Riddle Of The Sphinx|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2017/09/inside-no-9|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 April 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319011214/http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2017/09/inside-no-9|archivedate=19 March 2018}}</ref> Roach and Shearsmith had previously collaborated on the television programme ''[[Hunderby]]''.<Ref name=\"Commentary\"/> Roach said in an interview before the episode's airing that she is drawn to darker scripts; she said that she loves ''Inside No. 9'', describing the episodes as \"very gruesome, psychological thrillers, [which] always have great twists\".<ref name=\"Monks\"/> She described Nina as highly [[naivete|naive]].<ref name=\"Monks\">{{Cite news|author=Monks, Rebecca|date=24 January 2017|title=Alexandra Roach on No Offence, male dominated TV and Inside No. 9|url=https://inews.co.uk/essentials/culture/television/alexandra-roach-no-offence-male-dominated-tv-inside-no9/|publisher=[[inews.co.uk]]|accessdate=7 May 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170505230047/https://inews.co.uk/essentials/culture/television/alexandra-roach-no-offence-male-dominated-tv-inside-no9/|archivedate=5 May 2017}}</ref> Two [[body double|doubles]] were used in the episode in place of Roach.

Subsequently, he received a copy of Connor's book.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> Reading ''Two Girls, One on Each Knee'' led Pemberton to ask whether one could \"dramatize doing a crossword, which is so un-dramatic?\"<ref name=\"Commentary\"/><ref name=\"BCG interview\"/><ref name=\"sadists\"/> Pemberton explained that he and Shearsmith relish the challenge set by writing limitations, such as basing an episode around a crossword. Such constraints, he felt, encourage them to produce their best work.<ref name=\"Mellor interview\"/>\n\nWith assistance from Connor, Pemberton compiled the crossword around which the episode revolves.<ref name=\"Connor\"/> Connor was credited as the episode's \"Crossword consultant\"; further assistance was provided by [[Hugh Stephenson]], crossword editor for ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> The puzzle contains a range of themed entries and ninas\u2014hidden words or messages\u2014making it a particularly challenging crossword for a first-time designer. Pemberton began with ''ISWAPPEDCUPS'', the key nina, and two of the long themed words (''PUFFERFISH'' and ''ASPHYXIATION''). He then experimented with remaining clues, and was able to include ''MYSTERYGUEST'', ''KNOWITALL'', ''UNDERSLIP'' and ''NEUN''. The episode's second nina was created accidentally and seen at the last minute; by introducing a middle name for Pemberton's character, the writers were able to make it a part of the plot.<ref name=\"Connor\"/> At least one of the clues used in the episode\u2014Squires's improvised \"I teach wild creature without hospital building\", resulting in ''ARCHITECTURE''\u2014was not a good one. This was acknowledged by Squires in the episode, but was kept in as it reflected Squires's view of his own actions.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/>\n\nPemberton hoped that \"The Riddle of the Sphinx\" would work as a mini-tutorial for cryptic crosswords. Shearsmith, meanwhile, had never attempted a cryptic crossword before working on the episode, but has subsequently started completing them.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> Nonetheless, Pemberton acknowledged that not everyone enjoys crosswords, hence \"I always hated cryptic crosswords. Why can't people just say what they mean instead of trying to trick you all the time?\" from Shearsmith's Tyler.<ref name=\"Connor\"/> In an interview with Connor, published after \"The Riddle of the Sphinx\" had aired, Pemberton explored the ways in which writing for ''Inside No. 9'' was like writing for a cryptic crossword; in both cases, misdirection is key and utterly arbitrary choices or happenings can serve as important inspirations.<ref name=\"Connor\"/>\n\nIn the [[Audio commentary|DVD commentary]] for the episode, Shearsmith and Pemberton expressed a hope that Pemberton's crossword could be published before the episode's airing, so that viewers would be able to watch the episode having unknowingly already completed the crossword around which it revolves.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> Pemberton's crossword was published in ''The Guardian'' on the same day that the episode aired, credited to \"Sphinx\";<ref name=\"Connor\"/> for one critic, this explained and justified the answer ''MYSTERYGUEST''.<ref name=\"Wallaston\"/> The collaboration between ''Inside No. 9'' and ''The Guardian'' drew inspiration from the collaboration between ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'' for \"[[Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words]]\" in 2008. Pemberton dedicated the crossword, which was his first in print, to the late [[Kenny Ireland]]. The two of them had completed the ''Guardian'' crossword daily while filming together for the television comedy ''[[Benidorm (TV series)|Benidorm]]''.<ref name=\"Connor\"/> Allowing a one-off contribution from a non-regular setter was deeply unusual for ''The Guardian'', whose crosswords are normally produced by one of about 25 regular setters.<ref>{{cite news|title=On setters and setting|publisher=[[theguardian.com]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2017/apr/30/on-setters-and-setting|date=30 April 2017|accessdate=14 March 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213032001/https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2017/apr/30/on-setters-and-setting|archivedate=13 February 2018}}</ref> Pemberton, again writing as ''Sphinx'', went on to publish a further cryptic crossword in ''The Guardian'' in 2018, during the airing of the fourth series of ''Inside No. 9''.

He is holding a gun, but it is not loaded. Nina's boyfriend Simon is a fan of cryptic crosswords, but she is never able to help him. She has come to the rooms of Squires\u2014a [[classicist]] who sets crosswords for ''[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]'' as ''the Sphinx''\u2014to seek the answers to the next day's crossword. Squires sets about to teach Nina: \"I teach wild creature without hospital building\" results in ''ARCHITECTURE'', which Simon studies. They turn to the clues for the next day, beginning to fill a large grid. Squires uses the name of the [[Sphinx]] because she would asphyxiate and consume those who failed to answer her riddle: she was, he says, \"devious and deadly\". Squires makes tea, as Nina looks to his trophies. A picture of Squires with his late wife draws her attention, and they discuss the cut-throat world of competitive crosswording. Nina has answered ''DOWNANDOUT'' and ''WRAP''; Squires answers ''DESI'' and helps with ''TRENT''. Squires asks about Simon, but catches Nina in a lie; her excuse is that she only wants to learn. Together, they deduce ''SWAMPLANDS'', meaning \"bog\". Nina, though, suggests that it should be ''bogs'', otherwise Squires would be cheating. Suddenly spluttering, Squires takes a seat, as Nina begins on the next clue. She now displays clear proficiency, answering ''ASPHYXIATION''.\n\nSquires drops his cup, as Nina continues to fill in the crossword, including ''[[Mr. Sowerberry|SOWERBERRY]]'' and ''KNOWITALL''. Squires is apparently paralysed in his chair, watching. Nina is a [[marine biologist]], and has acquired [[tetrodotoxin]] from a [[pufferfish]], which causes [[paralysis]] and [[asphyxiation]]. Simon was actually Nina's brother, and is visible on the photo of Squires and his wife. Simon had reached a crosswording final only to be beaten by Squires after the latter challenged that a ''u'' looked more like a ''v''. Depressed by the defeat, Simon had killed himself. Squires, to Nina's shock, is unharmed. He leaps up to fill out ''NEUN'' and ''ASPS'', revealing the nina ''ISWAPPEDCUPS'' within the crossword. As Nina induces vomiting, Squires makes a phone call. He had been warned by Dr Jacob Tyler, an old friend and Nina's [[Supervisor#Academia|supervisor]]. Squires places Nina\u2014for whom paralysis is setting in\u2014on a chair, and goes back to the crossword, filling out ''UNDERSLIP''; asking about the underwear young women wear, he slides his hand up Nina's skirt and kisses her on the mouth.\n\nNina is left alone until Tyler enters. He tells Charlotte\u2014\"Nina\"\u2014to hang on, before turning to the crossword. With Squires, he works out ''MYSTERYGUEST''. Tyler reveals that he has no antidote for Charlotte, and will not call the emergency services. Instead, he wants Squires to eat Charlotte, as the Sphinx would. Tyler tells Squires that he cannot call the police, as the crossword displays [[premeditation]]: the ''KNOWITALL'' received a ''MYSTERYGUEST'' at number ''NEUN'', resulting in ''ASPHYXIATION''. Tyler reveals ''PUFFERFISH'', predicting, with reference to crossword answers, that a ''DOWN AND OUT'' will find Charlotte wrapped in her ''UNDERSLIP'' in ''SWAMPLANDS'', incriminating Squires. This is, Tyler says, his revenge.\n\nTyler cuts from Charlotte's buttocks, frying a strip of her flesh on a stove. Squires tells of how he began an affair with Monica, Tyler's wife and mother of his twin children, destroying Tyler's career. Tyler hands Squires the flesh; he eats, fearing Charlotte will die. Tyler reveals that he hates cryptic crosswords, and how his son entered the Cambridge Crossword Competition, attempting to beat his mother's new husband: Squires. Squires realises that Charlotte is Tyler's daughter. Charlotte and Tyler sought revenge on Squires, but Tyler changed plans so Squires would include clues in the crossword. However, Simon's [[autopsy]]\u2014Tyler explains\u2014revealed that Simon and Charlotte were actually Squires's children, meaning Monica and Squires's relationship began earlier than he previously thought. Charlotte is past saving, and Tyler places a bullet on Squires's desk, reminding Squires of the principle of [[Chekhov's gun]]. Squires confirms that his middle name is ''Hector'' as he weeps over Charlotte, and Tyler circles something on the crossword. Charlotte is dead, and Squires loads the gun, placing it in his mouth. Blood splatters over the crossword and a second nina: ''RIPNHS''.\n\n==Analysis==\n[[File:Inside No 9 crossword ninas revealed.jpg|frame|alt=A completed crossword puzzle|Sphinx's completed crossword as it appeared on [[theguardian.com]] with the three ninas highlighted: ''ISWAPPEDCUPS'' (red), ''RIPNHS'' (blue) and ''ONELEPUS'' (yellow)]]\n\"The Riddle of the Sphinx\" is less comedic than many episodes of ''Inside No. 9'',<ref name=\"Mulkern\"/> drawing upon [[gothic horror|gothic]] themes.<ref name=\"Mellor interview\"/><ref name=\"Chortle\"/><ref name=\"sadists\"/> Several critics identified ''Sleuth''\u2014\"a grandfather of sorts\" to ''Inside No. 9''\u2014as a key influence.<ref name=\"Mellor\"/><ref name=\"Mulkern\"/><ref name=\"Dessau\"/> [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', the 1973 horror film ''[[Theatre of Blood]]'', and the work of [[Anton Chekhov]] were also identified as possible influences.<ref name=\"Dessau\"/> Chekhov and his work are referenced in the episode; [[Chekhov's gun]] is referred to in the closing seconds, while Squires identifies the gun in the episode as from a production of ''[[The Seagull]]'', which was authored by Chekhov. This play, like \"The Riddle of Sphinx\", features a character named Nina and a gunshot suicide.<ref name=\"Mellor\"/> Mark Butler, writing for [[inews.co.uk]], noted the references to [[Greek tragedy]], arguing that the episode \"followed a long tradition of [[grotesque]] dramatic reveals\".<ref name=\"Butler\"/>\n\n''[[Al Hirschfeld#Nina|Nina]]'', as well as being the name of a character in the episode, is a name given by cruciverbalists\u2014crossword enthusiasts\u2014to hidden messages in crosswords, such as Squires's ''ISWAPPEDCUPS''.<ref name=\"Mellor\"/><ref name=\"Connor\"/> The character of Nina is reminiscent of [[Eliza Doolittle]], with Squires acting as Henry Higgins. The episode explicitly references [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]]'s play ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'', from which these characters originate, while Squires's language echoes that of Higgins in ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', the [[Musical film|musical]] adaptation of the play.<ref name=\"Mellor\"/>\n\n===Ninas===\nButler and the comedy critic [[Bruce Dessau]] suggested that the crossword answers may contain a hidden political message.<ref name=\"Dessau\"/><ref name=\"Butler\"/> On the episode's audio commentary, Shearsmith denied that the nina ''RIPNHS'' should be read as a political statement, namely \"[[Rest In Peace]] [[National Health Service]]\".<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> Similarly, in his interview with Connor, Pemberton noted that \"most people\" think that the nina is political, but that it was an accidental introduction, and only woven into the plot once the crossword had been completed.<ref name=\"Connor\"/> The political commentator [[Kerry-Anne Mendoza]] reached out to the BBC for comment on the apparent political message; a BBC spokesperson clarified that \"NHS are the initials of the professor in question who takes his own life\", and subsequently that the apparent political message was \"genuinely a complete coincidence\".<ref name=\"Mendoza\">{{cite news|author=[[Kerry-Anne Mendoza|Mendoza, Kerry-Anne]]|date=2 March 2017|title=The BBC denies sending a subtle \u2018F*ck You\u2019 to the government on air this week|publisher=[[The Canary (website)|The Canary]]|url=https://www.thecanary.co/2017/03/02/bbc-denies-sending-subtle-fck-you-government-onair-this-week-images/|access-date=23 April 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303173222/http://www.thecanary.co/2017/03/02/bbc-denies-sending-subtle-fck-you-government-onair-this-week-images/|archivedate=2017-03-03}}</ref>\n\nEvery episode of ''Inside No. 9'' features an ornamental hare somewhere on-screen.<ref name=\"Den hare\">{{Cite news|author=Mellor, Louisa|date=14 February 2017|title=Inside No. 9: did you spot this hidden detail in every episode?|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/inside-no-9/47261/inside-no-9-did-you-spot-this-hidden-detail-in-every-episode|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|accessdate=29 April 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170505115240/http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/inside-no-9/47261/inside-no-9-did-you-spot-this-hidden-detail-in-every-episode|archivedate=5 May 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"BCG\">{{cite web|title=Find the Inside No. 9 hare|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/inside_no_9/special/find_the_inside_no_9_hare/|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|accessdate=29 April 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170603014010/https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/inside_no_9/special/find_the_inside_no_9_hare/|archivedate=3 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"DS\">{{cite web|author=Jeffery, Morgan|date=15 February 2017|title=Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton reveal 9 secrets from Inside No. 9|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/feature/a821260/inside-no-9-series-3-reece-shearsmith-steve-pemberton-interview/|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=29 April 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511131155/http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/feature/a821260/inside-no-9-series-3-reece-shearsmith-steve-pemberton-interview/|archivedate=11 May 2017}}</ref> According to Pemberton, \"Because each episode is so wildly different there was nothing really linking them other than the fact they were all inside a Number Nine, I just thought it would be nice to have an object that you could hide and just have there on every set.\"<ref name=\"Den hare\"/> There is no particular significance to the hare itself.<ref name=\"BCG\"/><ref name=\"DS\"/> The hare is visible, though not clearly, in \"The Riddle of the Sphinx\" on a table in Squires's fireplace.<ref name=\"BCG\"/><ref name=\"Commentary\"/> There is also a \"second\" hare;

The camera follows Squires' gun to his desk drawer and we're kept aware of its presence thanks to Nina and Squires' \"If I\u2019d shot you, here in the dark/With an empty gun? Good luck\" exchange. Nina is shown drinking from the poisoned cup one of two times she admiringly calls Squires \"devious\" (a hint at her true feelings about him) and once again when she emphasises the word \"plan\". While Squires is telling the story of the Sphinx and she seems to be gazing at the statue of it, she's actually looking at the photograph of her brother on display directly below.<ref

It was erected in ca. 1170 as an endowment of Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja, dedicated to St. George; it is known as the \"Tracts of St. George\", often incorrectly as \"Pillars of St. George\". The monastery is exceptional not only for its position and significance it had according to medieval chronicles and manuscripts, but also for its particular architecture. It was named after the church dedicated to St George and its two former bell towers, two high towers \u2013 pillars (old Slavic language- stolp, stub). Namely, according to Stefan the First-Crowned, Nemanja had built this church to commemorate his gratitude to St. George for saving him from dungeons-caves where he was put by his brothers.\n\nThe monastery complex consisted of church of Saint George, dining-room, refectory, water tanks and walls around entry tower. The architecture of the Saint George Pillars Monastery is very characteristic representing unique synthesis of two medieval construction concepts, Byzantine in the East and Roman in the West. Monastery  is a building with  a set of  architectural and construction  innovation  in that period, among  which there are  two remarkable towers, lateral vestibules, cupola with elliptic basis, irregular shape of altar area, as well as specific arrangement of  the central  dome space of the church. Single-aisle temple with the altar consisting of three apses, naos and narthex, in its external appearance reflects the spirit of Roman construction. The combination of Byzantine spatial arrangement and Roman architecture resulted in original symbiosis that has been the ground for special architectural style. The entry tower, after the additional construction of apses in the east side in 1282-83, had been turned into chapel that king Dragutin designed for his tomb. The inside of the chapel is covered by frescos with historical content and portraits of the Nemanjics. The frescoes of this Monastery, rendered in the best tradition of the Comnenus style and skillfully adapted to the architecture of the temple, which is especially pronounced in the all-embracing cupola, have particular value. The most impressive is the picture of Saint George on the horse, which is above the main entrance in the church. Beside this very distinctive one are frescoes of four Serbian state councils where important decisions related to the Serbian history were made. A small building has been erected in front of the monastery and it is used as a museum for the protection and exhibition of the most important fragments from church and other structures, where some have been fully composed and reconstructed. As a part of the entity Stari Ras with Sopocani, Saint George Pillars Monastery has been on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 1979 and it is on the Transromanica Route.\n\n==Burials==\n[[Image:\u0110ur\u0111evi stupovi, 2008.jpg|thumb|200px|The monastery in 2008]]\n*[[Stefan Dragutin of Serbia]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|\u0110ur\u0111evi stupovi}}\n*[[Monuments of Culture of Exceptional Importance (Serbia)|Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance]]\n*[[Tourism in Serbia]]\n\n{{World Heritage Sites in Serbia}}\n{{Cultural Heritage of Exceptional Importance}}\n{{Serbian Orthodox Church}}\n\n{{Coord|43|09|56|N|20|29|48|E|source:srwiki_region:RS|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Durdevi Stupovi}}\n[[Category:Cultural Monuments of Exceptional Importance (Serbia)]]\n[[Category:Architecture of Serbia]]\n[[Category:Novi Pazar]]\n[[Category:Serbian Orthodox monasteries in Serbia]]\n[[Category:Christian monasteries established in the 12th century]]\n[[Category:12th-century Serbian Orthodox church buildings]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Serbia]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Serbia]]\n[[Category:12th-century establishments in Serbia]]\n[[Category:World Heritage Sites in Serbia]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the monastery in Serbia|the monastery in Montenegro|\u0110ur\u0111evi Stupovi, Montenegro}}\n{{unreferenced|date=December 2015}}\n{{Infobox religious building\n|building_name=\u0110ur\u0111evi Stupovi\n|image=Manastir \u0110ur\u0111evi Stupovi.jpg\n|caption=\n|location=[[Ras, Serbia|Ras]], ([[Novi Pazar]])\n|geo=\n|religious_affiliation=[[Serbian Orthodox Church]]\n|district=\n|consecration_year=\n|status=\n|leadership=\n|website=\n|architect=[[Stefan Nemanja]]\n|architecture_type=[[Byzantine]]\n|architecture_style=[[Byzantine]]\n|facade_direction=\n|year_completed=1166\n|construction_cost=\n|capacity=\n|length=\n|width=\n|width_nave=\n|height_max=\n|dome_quantity= 1\n|dome_height_outer=\n|dome_height_inner=\n|dome_dia_outer=\n|dome_dia_inner=\n|minaret_quantity=\n|minaret_height=\n|spire_quantity=\n|spire_height=\n|materials= Stone\n| designation1 = WHS\n| designation1_offname = [[Stari Ras]]\n| designation1_date = 1979 (3rd)\n| designation1_type = Cultural\n| designation1_criteria = i, iii\n| designation1_number = [https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/96 96]\n| designation1_free1name = Region\n| designation1_free1value = [[List of World Heritage Sites in Europe|Europe and North America]]\n}}\n\n'''\u0110ur\u0111evi Stupovi''' ({{lang-sr|{{lang|sr-Cyrl|\u0402\u0443\u0440\u0452\u0435\u0432\u0438 \u0421\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0438}} / {{lang|sr-Latn|\u0110ur\u0111evi stupovi}}|lit=Tracts of [St.] George}}) is a [[Serbian Orthodox]] [[monastery]] located in the vicinity of today's city of [[Novi Pazar]], in the [[Ra\u0161ka (region)|Ra\u0161ka]] region of [[Serbia]].\n\nThe monastery is located near Novi Pazar, on the top of a prominent elevation covered with woods.

A wet [[wikt:compress#English-folded cloth|compress]] was applied, then a nightcap, then further bandaging to secure these dressings.

It was written by [[Stephen Thompson (writer)|Stephen Thompson]] and stars [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as [[List of Sherlock characters#Sherlock Holmes|Sherlock Holmes]], [[Martin Freeman]] as [[List of Sherlock characters#Dr. John Watson|Dr John Watson]], and [[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]] as [[List of Sherlock characters#Jim Moriarty|Jim Moriarty]]. The episode deals with Moriarty's attempt to undermine the public's view of Sherlock and drive him to suicide. The episode was first broadcast on [[BBC One]] and BBC One HD on 15 January 2012. It attracted 9.78 million viewers, and critical reaction to the episode was positive. After the episode was aired, there was also much online and media speculation, which focused on Sherlock's death.\n\nInspired by \"[[The Final Problem]]\" by [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], the episode follows Moriarty's plot to discredit and kill Sherlock Holmes, also heavily using elements from the film ''[[The Woman in Green]]''. The title alludes to the [[Reichenbach Falls]], the location where Holmes and Moriarty supposedly fall to their deaths in the original story. Some sequences in the episode that are set at the [[Tower of London]] were filmed at [[Cardiff Castle]]. Other locations used include Newport Cemetery, [[Tredegar House]] and [[Cardiff City Hall]], as well as other areas around Cardiff including Broadway and [[Cardiff Bay]].<ref name=\"Wales Online 2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/showbiz/2012/01/17/sherlock-cult-following-to-boost-tourism-in-south-wales-91466-30136052/3/ |title=Sherlock cult following to boost tourism in South Wales |date=17 January 2012 |work=Wales Online |accessdate=17 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please do not add further plot detail, if anything make more concise. -->\nJohn Watson is in his first meeting with his therapist after eighteen months. Struggling to explain his visit, he eventually chokes out the words, \"My best friend, Sherlock Holmes, is dead.\" The episode flashes back to three months earlier, with Sherlock receiving plaudits and gifts from various people for whom he has solved cases, along with much unwanted media attention, especially for his recovery of a [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] painting of Reichenbach Falls.\n\nMeanwhile, [[List of Sherlock characters#Jim Moriarty|Moriarty]] proceeds to break into the case [[Tower of London#Crown Jewels|where]] the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels]] are kept, while simultaneously opening the vault at the [[Bank of England]] and unlocking all the cells at [[Pentonville (HM Prison)|Pentonville Prison]] via his mobile phone. Before smashing the Crown Jewels' case, he writes the words \"Get Sherlock\" on the outside, to be seen by the security cameras. He then allows himself to be caught by the police wearing the jewels and sitting on the throne.\n\nSherlock is called to testify at Moriarty's trial, where he explains that Moriarty is a criminal mastermind. Moriarty has threatened the jurors with the deaths of their families into voting 'not guilty.'  After being acquitted, Moriarty visits Sherlock and, after explaining that his break-in was a publicity stunt to show powerful potential clients what he is capable of, tells him, \"I owe you a fall\". Meanwhile, John is summoned to see [[List of Sherlock characters#Mycroft Holmes|Mycroft]], who explains that some professional assassins have moved into flats on Baker Street and asks him to watch out for Sherlock.\n\nSherlock and John investigate the kidnapping of the children of the British Ambassador to the U.S., Rufus Bruhl, part of a plot by Moriarty to make others suspect that Sherlock has been staging all his cases himself. He has traumatised the girl so she is terrified of Sherlock when seeing him, causing Sergeant Donovan to suspect Sherlock. A reluctant Lestrade is forced to arrest Sherlock, but Sherlock escapes with John handcuffed to him as his 'hostage'. They realise Moriarty's \"Get Sherlock\" has convinced the criminal underworld that Moriarty has given Sherlock the computer code he used to pull off his triple heist, a code that can bypass all security systems.\n\nSherlock and John break into the house of a journalist, Kitty Riley, poised to publish an expos\u00e9 on Sherlock. There, they find that Moriarty has created a fake identity, Richard Brook (or Rich Brook, \"reicher Bach\" in German), an actor whom Sherlock supposedly paid to pose as a master criminal. Now a wanted man with his media image on the verge of plummeting, Sherlock launches a final gambit. Leaving John, Sherlock contacts [[Molly Hooper]], a pathologist at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]], where he confesses that contrary to what she herself believes, she does matter to him, and that he's always trusted her. There he reveals his vulnerability to Molly, confirming her earlier \"deduction\" that he was \"not okay\", that he's going to die and asks her if she's willing to help, telling her that he \"needs her\". John goes to the [[Diogenes Club]] to question Mycroft and learns that Mycroft divulged Sherlock's personal information during interrogations of Moriarty. Meanwhile, Sherlock deduces that the anti-security program was encoded in the tapping of Moriarty's fingers during his earlier visit.\n\nJohn finds Sherlock at the St. Bartholomew's lab but leaves after hearing [[List of Sherlock characters#Mrs. Hudson|Mrs. Hudson]] has been shot. Sherlock texts Moriarty, who meets him on the roof of the hospital to resolve what the criminal calls their \"final problem\". Sherlock claims that, with the code, he can erase Richard Brook electronically. Moriarty reveals that there is no code, he just bribed security men, and that Sherlock must commit [[suicide]] or Moriarty's assassins will kill John, Mrs. Hudson, and Lestrade. Sherlock realises that Moriarty has a fail-safe and can call the killings off. Sherlock then convinces Moriarty that he is willing to do anything to make him activate the fail-safe; after acknowledging that he and Sherlock are alike, Moriarty tells Sherlock \"As long as I am alive, you can save your friends,\" then commits suicide by shooting himself in the mouth, thereby denying Sherlock knowledge of the abort codes and the ability to prove that Moriarty does exist.\n[[File:Barts.jpg|thumb|right|St Bartholomew's Hospital]]\nWith no way to use the fail-safe, Sherlock calls John, who is rushing back from 221B Baker Street after realising the report about Mrs. Hudson was a ruse. Claiming that he was always a fake and explaining this last phone call is his \"[[Suicide note|note]]\", Sherlock swan-dives off the roof of St. Bartholomew as John looks on terrified from the street, thereby ensuring that Moriarty's true identity dies with him. After being knocked to the ground by a cyclist, John stumbles over to watch, grief-stricken, as Sherlock's bloody body is carried away by hospital staff.\n\nThe episode returns to John's therapy session, where he is unable to open up. Mycroft is shown reading the tabloid newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' with a front-page headline \"Suicide of Fake Genius.\" Later, John visits Sherlock's grave with Mrs. Hudson. There, he reaffirms his faith in Sherlock and begs him not to be dead. As he walks away, Sherlock looks on from the shadows, out of John's sight, before also walking away.\n\n==Sources==\n[[File:BigReichenbach.JPG|thumb|\"The Great Fall of the Reichenbach, in the Valley of Hasle, Switzerland\" (1804, watercolour on paper) by J.M.W.

The memes included recurring phrases such as \"I fight John Watson's war\", \"Moriarty was real\" and, most prominently, \"I believe in Sherlock Holmes\", amongst others, the latter of which was used in-universe in \"[[The Empty Hearse]]\".

The episode was written by series creators [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]], and directed by [[Jeremy Podeswa]].\n\nThe lifeless body of [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]] is discovered by Ser [[Davos Seaworth]] and loyal members of the Night's Watch protect it; [[Melisandre]] has begun to lose her faith in the Lord of Light; [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Theon Greyjoy]] flee Winterfell, [[Ellaria Sand]] and the Sand Snakes seize control of Dorne; [[Jaime Lannister]] returns to King's Landing with the body of his dead daughter; and [[Daenerys Targaryen]] is taken prisoner by the khalasar of Khal Moro.\n\n\"The Red Woman\" was positively received by critics who found the episode to be a satisfactory launching point for the season, and praising the scenes involving Sansa and Brienne, as well as the closing reveal with Melisandre, although the Dorne storyline was criticized once again for feeling too abrupt and deviating greatly from the books. For filming of the episode's closing reveal, the director used similar technique to the body double of Cersei Lannister in the previous episode. The episode title is an allusion to the epithet used to describe the Red Priestess Melisandre. In the United States, the episode premiere achieved a viewership of 7.94 million in its initial broadcast, and a same-day total including the streaming services HBO Go and HBO Now of 10.7 million viewers, a record for the series.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=May 2019}}<!--\"Too long\" means over 400 words per MOS:TVPLOT. Therefore do NOT remove tag until episode is under 400 words.-->\n\n===In the North===\nAt Winterfell, [[Ramsay Bolton]] mourns the death of Myranda, but commands that her corpse be fed to his hounds. [[Roose Bolton]] warns him that, despite their victory, they could be facing the wrath of the Lannisters in the future and therefore must secure the loyalty of the North's other nobles. Roose blames Ramsay for losing [[Sansa Stark]], who, as a child of [[Eddard Stark]], could have been used as a figurehead for the North. Roose implies that he will disinherit Ramsay if he cannot retrieve her and if Roose's unborn child is a son.\n\nMeanwhile, Sansa and [[Theon Greyjoy]] flee through the nearby forests, and are rescued from a squad of Bolton soldiers by [[Brienne of Tarth]] and [[Podrick Payne]], who kill the soldiers. Brienne again offers to pledge her loyalty to Sansa, who accepts.\n\n===In Dorne===\n[[Doran Martell]] receives news of [[Myrcella Baratheon]]'s death and is aghast, but he and [[Areo Hotah]] are immediately murdered by [[Ellaria Sand]] and [[Tyene Sand]], while the palace guards look on passively. Ellaria states that his people have become dissatisfied with Doran's inaction against the Lannisters. As Doran dies, he pleads for his son Trystane's life, but Ellaria vows that \"weak men\" will never rule Dorne again.\n\n===In King's Landing===\n[[Jaime Lannister]] arrives in King's Landing bearing Myrcella's body, and returns to [[Cersei Lannister]]. Cersei recounts [[The Wars to Come|Maggy the Frog's prophecy]] that all her children would die before her. Jaime promises that they will have revenge against all who have wronged the Lannisters, heightening the importance of his and Cersei's staying close.\n\nAcross the city, [[Margaery Tyrell]], who is still held captive by the Faith Militant, converses with the [[High Sparrow]], but he refuses to give her information about her brother Loras.\n\n[[Obara Sand|Obara]] and [[Nymeria Sand]] infiltrate Trystane's ship and declare their intent to kill him. When he attempts to defend himself from Nymeria, he is stabbed through the back of the head by Obara.\n\n===In Meereen===\n[[Tyrion Lannister]] and [[Varys]] walk through the streets, now deserted due to [[Daenerys Targaryen]]' absence and fear of the Sons of the Harpy. Tyrion observes that Daenerys' enemies are growing, including former slaves and former masters. Varys promises that his spies will find the leader of the Sons of the Harpy. The two discover that someone has set fire to all of the ships in Meereen's harbor, and Tyrion realizes that Daenerys' forces will be unable to sail to Westeros.\n\n===In the Dothraki Sea===\n[[Daario Naharis]] and [[Jorah Mormont]] continue to trace Daenerys' location. Jorah takes a moment to observe his worsening greyscale. They discover her ring in the middle of thousands of hoof-prints, deducing that she has been taken by the Dothraki.\n\nDaenerys is presented to Khal Moro, who has taken her prisoner. Daenerys explains that she was [[Khal Drogo]]'s wife and asks Moro to escort her back to Meereen, but he refuses, as widows of khals must live out their lives in Vaes Dothrak, the Dothraki's sacred city.\n\n===In Braavos===\n[[Arya Stark]], now blinded, is sent to beg on the streets. [[The Waif]] appears and forces Arya to duel her using a wooden staff. Arya fails because of her blindness, and the Waif promises that she will return the following day.\n\n===At the Wall===\nFollowing the murder of [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]], his direwolf Ghost begins to howl, attracting the attention of [[Davos Seaworth]], [[Eddison Tollett]], and a few other loyalists, who take Jon's body into a store-room. [[Melisandre]] briefly visits and is troubled, as she had experienced a vision in the flames of Jon fighting at Winterfell. The loyalists lock themselves in from the mutineers, while Edd sneaks out of Castle Black to get assistance from the Wildlings.\n\nSer [[Alliser Thorne]] convenes the Night's Watch and takes responsibility for Jon's murder. Several brothers accuse Thorne and his co-conspirators of treason, but Thorne wins them over by citing Jon's actions and stating that he would have destroyed the Night's Watch by letting in the Wildlings. Thorne and the other mutineers then surround the store-room and threaten to attack if they don't surrender by nightfall.\n\nMelisandre, who has been sullen following Stannis' defeat and Jon's death, goes to sleep in her bedroom. As she undresses, she removes her ruby necklace, which proves to be enchanted, as she is revealed to have a physical body many years older<!--- refs, which follow this note, range from 100 to 400 to 800, so use a non-precise term to make the basic point that she is way older than her normal appearance would suggest ---><ref name=EWOld/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://ew.com/tv/2019/04/29/game-of-thrones-melisandre-carice-van-houten-battle-interview/ |title=Melisandre actress Carice van Houten on that Game of Thrones Winterfell battle |first=James |last=Hibberd |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=April 29, 2019 |access-date=April 30, 2019}}</ref> than she normally appears.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing===\n[[File:D.

For io9, [[Charlie Jane Anders]] called it \"the absolute worst\" part of the episode, and criticized the Dorne storyline in general for giving Doran Martell \"a grand total of ten minutes' screentime\" before suddenly killing him off, given that he is alive in the novels and his major subplot from the books - that he was simply ''feigning'' a desire for peace while planning to betray the Lannisters - was not introduced at all before his departure.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160817123724/http://io9.gizmodo.com/im-starting-to-think-the-greatest-hero-in-game-of-thron-1772823166 |archivedate=August 17, 2016 |url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/im-starting-to-think-the-greatest-hero-in-game-of-thron-1772823166|title=I'm Starting to Think the Greatest Hero in Game of Thrones Is Brienne of Tarth |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |last=Jane Anders |first=Charlie |date=April 25, 2016 |accessdate=August 18, 2016}}</ref> Alan Sepinwall from [[HitFix]] also disliked the Dorne scenes and summarized, \"I'll settle for not needing to audibly groan every time the story returns to Dorne, frankly.\"<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160817123724/http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-game-of-thrones-sets-the-season-6-table-with-the-red-woman |archivedate=August 17, 2016 |url=http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-game-of-thrones-sets-the-season-6-table-with-the-red-woman |title=Review: 'Game of Thrones' sets the season 6 table with 'The Red Woman' |work=[[HitFix]] |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |date=April 24, 2016 |accessdate=August 18, 2016}}</ref> For [[Vulture.com|Vulture]], Nate Jones wrote an op-ed piece specifically criticizing the Dorne storyline in seasons five and six, culminating in the changes in the season six premiere, which it felt to be bizarre and illogical - purely relying on shock value when the characters' actions don't make sense upon closer analysis. Jones was also critical of how it was altering the female characters in Dorne, saying that they were changed from the novels to be \"the kind of violent, scantily clad women that emerge when creators want to pay lip service to feminism, but don't have the time or inclination to create actual three-dimensional female characters.\"<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160817123724/http://www.vulture.com/2016/04/game-of-thrones-dorne-plot-whats-going-on.html |archivedate=August 17, 2016 |url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/04/game-of-thrones-dorne-plot-whats-going-on.html |title=What\u2019s Wrong With Game of Thrones\u2019 Dorne Plot? |work=[[Vulture.com]] |last=Jones |first=Nate |date=April 24, 2016 |accessdate=August 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquotepar|Game_of_Thrones/Season_6#The_Red_Woman_.5B6.01.5D|The Red Woman}}\n* [http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/episodes/6/51-the-red-woman/index.html \"The Red Woman\"] at [[HBO.com]]\n* {{IMDb episode|3658014|The Red Woman}}\n* {{tv.com episode|game-of-thrones/the-red-woman-3368393/|The Red Woman}}\n\n{{Game of Thrones episodes|6}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Red Woman, The}}\n[[Category:2016 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Game of Thrones (season 6) episodes]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by David Benioff and D.B.

The episode was written by series creators [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]], and directed by [[Jeremy Podeswa]].\n\nThe lifeless body of [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]] is discovered by Ser [[Davos Seaworth]] and loyal members of the Night's Watch protect it; [[Melisandre]] has begun to lose her faith in the Lord of Light; [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Theon Greyjoy]] flee Winterfell, [[Ellaria Sand]] and the Sand Snakes seize control of Dorne; [[Jaime Lannister]] returns to King's Landing with the body of his dead daughter; and [[Daenerys Targaryen]] is taken prisoner by the khalasar of Khal Moro.\n\n\"The Red Woman\" was positively received by critics who found the episode to be a satisfactory launching point for the season, and praising the scenes involving Sansa and Brienne, as well as the closing reveal with Melisandre, although the Dorne storyline was criticized once again for feeling too abrupt and deviating greatly from the books. For filming of the episode's closing reveal, the director used similar technique to the body double of Cersei Lannister in the previous episode. The episode title is an allusion to the epithet used to describe the Red Priestess Melisandre. In the United States, the episode premiere achieved a viewership of 7.94 million in its initial broadcast, and a same-day total including the streaming services HBO Go and HBO Now of 10.7 million viewers, a record for the series.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=May 2019}}<!--\"Too long\" means over 400 words per MOS:TVPLOT. Therefore do NOT remove tag until episode is under 400 words.-->\n\n===In the North===\nAt Winterfell, [[Ramsay Bolton]] mourns the death of Myranda, but commands that her corpse be fed to his hounds. [[Roose Bolton]] warns him that, despite their victory, they could be facing the wrath of the Lannisters in the future and therefore must secure the loyalty of the North's other nobles. Roose blames Ramsay for losing [[Sansa Stark]], who, as a child of [[Eddard Stark]], could have been used as a figurehead for the North. Roose implies that he will disinherit Ramsay if he cannot retrieve her and if Roose's unborn child is a son.\n\nMeanwhile, Sansa and [[Theon Greyjoy]] flee through the nearby forests, and are rescued from a squad of Bolton soldiers by [[Brienne of Tarth]] and [[Podrick Payne]], who kill the soldiers. Brienne again offers to pledge her loyalty to Sansa, who accepts.\n\n===In Dorne===\n[[Doran Martell]] receives news of [[Myrcella Baratheon]]'s death and is aghast, but he and [[Areo Hotah]] are immediately murdered by [[Ellaria Sand]] and [[Tyene Sand]], while the palace guards look on passively. Ellaria states that his people have become dissatisfied with Doran's inaction against the Lannisters. As Doran dies, he pleads for his son Trystane's life, but Ellaria vows that \"weak men\" will never rule Dorne again.\n\n===In King's Landing===\n[[Jaime Lannister]] arrives in King's Landing bearing Myrcella's body, and returns to [[Cersei Lannister]]. Cersei recounts [[The Wars to Come|Maggy the Frog's prophecy]] that all her children would die before her. Jaime promises that they will have revenge against all who have wronged the Lannisters, heightening the importance of his and Cersei's staying close.\n\nAcross the city, [[Margaery Tyrell]], who is still held captive by the Faith Militant, converses with the [[High Sparrow]], but he refuses to give her information about her brother Loras.\n\n[[Obara Sand|Obara]] and [[Nymeria Sand]] infiltrate Trystane's ship and declare their intent to kill him. When he attempts to defend himself from Nymeria, he is stabbed through the back of the head by Obara.\n\n===In Meereen===\n[[Tyrion Lannister]] and [[Varys]] walk through the streets, now deserted due to [[Daenerys Targaryen]]' absence and fear of the Sons of the Harpy. Tyrion observes that Daenerys' enemies are growing, including former slaves and former masters. Varys promises that his spies will find the leader of the Sons of the Harpy. The two discover that someone has set fire to all of the ships in Meereen's harbor, and Tyrion realizes that Daenerys' forces will be unable to sail to Westeros.\n\n===In the Dothraki Sea===\n[[Daario Naharis]] and [[Jorah Mormont]] continue to trace Daenerys' location. Jorah takes a moment to observe his worsening greyscale. They discover her ring in the middle of thousands of hoof-prints, deducing that she has been taken by the Dothraki.\n\nDaenerys is presented to Khal Moro, who has taken her prisoner. Daenerys explains that she was [[Khal Drogo]]'s wife and asks Moro to escort her back to Meereen, but he refuses, as widows of khals must live out their lives in Vaes Dothrak, the Dothraki's sacred city.\n\n===In Braavos===\n[[Arya Stark]], now blinded, is sent to beg on the streets. [[The Waif]] appears and forces Arya to duel her using a wooden staff. Arya fails because of her blindness, and the Waif promises that she will return the following day.\n\n===At the Wall===\nFollowing the murder of [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]], his direwolf Ghost begins to howl, attracting the attention of [[Davos Seaworth]], [[Eddison Tollett]], and a few other loyalists, who take Jon's body into a store-room. [[Melisandre]] briefly visits and is troubled, as she had experienced a vision in the flames of Jon fighting at Winterfell. The loyalists lock themselves in from the mutineers, while Edd sneaks out of Castle Black to get assistance from the Wildlings.\n\nSer [[Alliser Thorne]] convenes the Night's Watch and takes responsibility for Jon's murder. Several brothers accuse Thorne and his co-conspirators of treason, but Thorne wins them over by citing Jon's actions and stating that he would have destroyed the Night's Watch by letting in the Wildlings. Thorne and the other mutineers then surround the store-room and threaten to attack if they don't surrender by nightfall.\n\nMelisandre, who has been sullen following Stannis' defeat and Jon's death, goes to sleep in her bedroom. As she undresses, she removes her ruby necklace, which proves to be enchanted, as she is revealed to have a physical body many years older<!--- refs, which follow this note, range from 100 to 400 to 800, so use a non-precise term to make the basic point that she is way older than her normal appearance would suggest ---><ref name=EWOld/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://ew.com/tv/2019/04/29/game-of-thrones-melisandre-carice-van-houten-battle-interview/ |title=Melisandre actress Carice van Houten on that Game of Thrones Winterfell battle |first=James |last=Hibberd |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=April 29, 2019 |access-date=April 30, 2019}}</ref> than she normally appears.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing===\n[[File:D.

The episode was written by executive producers [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]], and directed by [[David Nutter]]. It aired on {{Start date|2013|6|2}}.\n\nThe episode is centered on the wedding of Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey, one of the most memorable events of the book series, commonly called \"The Red Wedding\", during which [[Robb Stark]] and his banner-men are massacred. Other storylines include Bran Stark's group's having to separate, [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]]'s loyalties being tested, and [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s plotting her invasion of the city of Yunkai. The title is a song belonging to the Lannister family, whose lyrics foreshadow the Red Wedding and which is played by the band at the wedding right before the slaughter begins.\n\nThis episode earned Benioff and Weiss a nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series]].<ref>[http://www.emmys.com/nominations/2013/Outstanding%20Writing%20for%20a%20Drama%20Series Official nominees for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2013/06/03/game-of-thrones-the-rains-of-castamere-review|title=Game of Thrones: \"The Rains of Castamere\" Review|last=Fowler|first=By Matt|website=IGN|access-date=June 4, 2016}}</ref> This episode marks the final appearance of [[Richard Madden]] ([[Robb Stark]]), [[Oona Chaplin]] ([[Talisa Stark]]), and [[Michelle Fairley]] ([[Catelyn Stark]]).\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Beyond the Wall===\nSam and Gilly continue their march south. Sam tells Gilly he plans for them to cross the Wall using the entrance at the Nightfort, an abandoned castle along the Wall.\n\n===In the North===\nBran and his group take shelter in an abandoned mill. They see a horse breeder captured by Jon's wildling group. [[Hodor]], scared, begins yelling, which threatens to give away their location to the wildlings. Bran uses his warg abilities to enter Hodor's mind and knocks him out. [[List of A Song of Ice and Fire characters|Orell]] tells Jon to kill the old man to prove his loyalty, but Jon is unable to kill him and [[Ygritte]] kills him. [[Tormund Giantsbane|Tormund]] realizes that Jon is not loyal to them and orders his men to kill Jon. Bran enters Summer's mind and helps Jon to defeat Tormund's men and Orell. Jon steals a horse and escapes. Bran asks Rickon to leave for Last Hearth, the home of the Umber family.\n\n===In Yunkai===\nDaario, Jorah and Grey Worm enter the city and kill Yunkai's slave soldiers. They tell Daenerys that she is now in control of the city.\n\n===At the Twins===\nRobb Stark's army arrive at the Twins. Robb apologizes to [[Walder Frey]] and his daughters. [[Sandor Clegane]], travelling to the Twins with [[Arya Stark]], steals a cart of food. After [[Edmure Tully|Edmure]] marries [[Roslin Frey|Roslin]], Frey calls for the bedding ceremony and the couple are taken to their chamber. Talisa tells Robb that she wants to name their son Eddard. A Lannister song called \"The Rains of Castamere\" begins to play, and  Catelyn realizes that the Starks have been betrayed by [[Roose Bolton]]. Frey orders his men to attack, leading to the deaths of many of the Starks including Robb, Talisa, and Catelyn. Arya and Sandor arrive and, despite being turned away by the guards, Arya sneaks in.  She witnesses the killing of the Stark soldiers and Robb's direwolf before being rescued by Sandor.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing===\n\"The Rains of Castamere\" was written by executive producers [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]], based on [[George R. R. Martin]]'s original work from his novel ''[[A Storm of Swords]]''. The episode adapts content from chapters 41 to 43 and 50 to 53 (Bran III, Jon V, Daenerys IV, Catelyn VI, Arya X, Catelyn VII, and Arya XI).<ref name=\"westeros\">{{cite web|url=http://www.westeros.org/GoT/Episodes/Entry/The_Rains_of_Castamere/Book_Spoilers/|title=EP309:The Rains of Castamere|publisher=Westeros.org|first=Elio|last=Garcia|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe episode includes one of the most important plot turns of the series: the betrayal and assassination of the Stark forces during a marriage ceremony in what came to be known as the \"Red Wedding\". The event culminates in Roose Bolton delivering Jaime Lannister's message from \"[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair#At Harrenhal|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]\", before killing Robb.

He explained that he always tries to put himself in the skin of his characters when writing from their perspective, and develops bonds with them.

The title is a song belonging to the Lannister family, whose lyrics foreshadow the Red Wedding and which is played by the band at the wedding right before the slaughter begins.\n\nThis episode earned Benioff and Weiss a nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series]].<ref>[http://www.emmys.com/nominations/2013/Outstanding%20Writing%20for%20a%20Drama%20Series Official nominees for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2013/06/03/game-of-thrones-the-rains-of-castamere-review|title=Game of Thrones: \"The Rains of Castamere\" Review|last=Fowler|first=By Matt|website=IGN|access-date=June 4, 2016}}</ref> This episode marks the final appearance of [[Richard Madden]] ([[Robb Stark]]), [[Oona Chaplin]] ([[Talisa Stark]]), and [[Michelle Fairley]] ([[Catelyn Stark]]).\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Beyond the Wall===\nSam and Gilly continue their march south. Sam tells Gilly he plans for them to cross the Wall using the entrance at the Nightfort, an abandoned castle along the Wall.\n\n===In the North===\nBran and his group take shelter in an abandoned mill. They see a horse breeder captured by Jon's wildling group. [[Hodor]], scared, begins yelling, which threatens to give away their location to the wildlings. Bran uses his warg abilities to enter Hodor's mind and knocks him out. [[List of A Song of Ice and Fire characters|Orell]] tells Jon to kill the old man to prove his loyalty, but Jon is unable to kill him and [[Ygritte]] kills him. [[Tormund Giantsbane|Tormund]] realizes that Jon is not loyal to them and orders his men to kill Jon. Bran enters Summer's mind and helps Jon to defeat Tormund's men and Orell. Jon steals a horse and escapes. Bran asks Rickon to leave for Last Hearth, the home of the Umber family.\n\n===In Yunkai===\nDaario, Jorah and Grey Worm enter the city and kill Yunkai's slave soldiers. They tell Daenerys that she is now in control of the city.\n\n===At the Twins===\nRobb Stark's army arrive at the Twins. Robb apologizes to [[Walder Frey]] and his daughters. [[Sandor Clegane]], travelling to the Twins with [[Arya Stark]], steals a cart of food. After [[Edmure Tully|Edmure]] marries [[Roslin Frey|Roslin]], Frey calls for the bedding ceremony and the couple are taken to their chamber. Talisa tells Robb that she wants to name their son Eddard. A Lannister song called \"The Rains of Castamere\" begins to play, and  Catelyn realizes that the Starks have been betrayed by [[Roose Bolton]]. Frey orders his men to attack, leading to the deaths of many of the Starks including Robb, Talisa, and Catelyn. Arya and Sandor arrive and, despite being turned away by the guards, Arya sneaks in.  She witnesses the killing of the Stark soldiers and Robb's direwolf before being rescued by Sandor. \n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing===\n\"The Rains of Castamere\" was written by executive producers [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]], based on [[George R. R. Martin]]'s original work from his novel ''[[A Storm of Swords]]''. The episode adapts content from chapters 41 to 43 and 50 to 53 (Bran III, Jon V, Daenerys IV, Catelyn VI, Arya X, Catelyn VII, and Arya XI).<ref name=\"westeros\">{{cite web|url=http://www.westeros.org/GoT/Episodes/Entry/The_Rains_of_Castamere/Book_Spoilers/|title=EP309:The Rains of Castamere|publisher=Westeros.org|first=Elio|last=Garcia|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe episode includes one of the most important plot turns of the series: the betrayal and assassination of the Stark forces during a marriage ceremony in what came to be known as the \"Red Wedding\". The event culminates in Roose Bolton delivering Jaime Lannister's message from \"[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair#At Harrenhal|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]\", before killing Robb. This tragic turn of events had a profound impact on Benioff and Weiss in their first read of the novels and it was the scene that convinced them to attempt to obtain the rights for a television series.<ref name=\"EW\">{{cite news|last=Hibberd|first=James|title='Game of Thrones' showrunners on season 2, splitting Book 3 and their hope for a 70-hour epic|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/03/30/game-of-thrones-showrunners-season-2/2/|accessdate=May 5, 2013|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|quote=Oh, my God, we\u2019ve got to get this.

He explained that he always tries to put himself in the skin of his characters when writing from their perspective, and develops bonds with them.

{"title_page": "Nicholas St Lawrence, 9th Baron Howth", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n'''Nicholas St. Lawrence, 9th Baron Howth''' (c.1550\u20131607) was a leading member of the [[Anglo-Irish]] nobility in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Despite openly professing his [[Roman Catholic]] faith, he enjoyed the trust of [[Elizabeth I]] and of  successive Lord Deputies of Ireland, and was even forgiven by the English  Crown  for signing a petition against the [[Penal Laws]].\n\n== Early life ==\nHe was the eldest surviving son of [[Christopher St Lawrence, 8th Baron Howth (d. 1589)|Christopher, 8th Baron Howth]] and his first wife Elizabeth Plunket  of [[Beaulieu House and Gardens, Co. Louth|Beaulieu House]], [[ County Louth]]. His date of birth is often given as 1555, but  was probably some years earlier: Elrington Ball states that he was well into middle age when his father died,<ref name=eball>Ball, F. Elrington ''History of Dublin'' 6 Volumes Alexander Thoms and Co. Dublin 1902\u20131920</ref> and in 1605 he was described as being \"too old to be likely  to live long\".\n\nHis early life cannot have been   happy, as  his father was notorious for his cruelty to his wife and children. In 1577 Nicholas's teenage sister Jane died after being severely beaten by their father, and his mother was so ill-treated   that the [[Court of Castle Chamber]] (the Irish equivalen of. [[Star Chamber]])  granted her a [[judicial separation]].  Lord Howth  was fined  for his cruelty to his wife and daughter,  and briefly imprisoned.<ref>Crawford, Jon G. ''A Star Chamber Court in Ireland- the Court of Castle Chamber'' 1571\u20131641 Four Courts Press Dublin 2006</ref>\n\nAccording to a well-known legend [[Granuaile]], the celebrated Pirate Queen of Galway in about 1575 arrived unannounced at [[Howth Castle]] for dinner, only to find the gates barred; in retaliation for the discourtesy she took the youthful heir [[hostage]] until the family apologised. Elrington Ball suggests  that the story may be  partly  based on fact<ref name=eball/>- but if the heir was a child  at the relevant time this probably    refers  to Nicholas' eldest son Christopher, not  to Nicholas himself. \n\n[[Image:Howth Castle.jpg|thumb|Howth Castle]]\n\nIn the 1580s he lived  at Platten in [[County Meath|Meath]],  where his wife had inherited some  property. He was [[knighted]] in 1588 and succeeded his father as baron the following year.\n\n== Political career ==\nIn Elrington Ball's view Lord Howth \"was devoted to the interests of [[the Pale]] and did not always find it easy to reconcile that with the requirements of Government. \"<ref name=eball/>  This was especially  true  after it became public knowledge that he practiced the Roman Catholic faith.  \n\nHis initial relations with the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], [[William FitzWilliam (Lord Deputy)|Sir William FitzWilliam]], were friendly, and he was appointed guardian of the Pale in the Deputy's absence. Shortly afterwards relations between the two men cooled when Nicholas became involved in the long and bitter [[feud]] between the Nugent and Dillon families family, headed by [[Christopher Nugent|Christopher, Baron Delvin]] on the one hand and Sir [[Robert Dillon (judge)|Robert Dillon]], the [[Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas]] on the other. The Nugent family pursued Dillon relentlessly with charges of [[corruption]] for several years until he was eventually cleared  of any wrongdoing in 1593, and Lord Howth was closely associated with the attack.<ref name=\"DNB\">{{cite DNB|last=Dunlop|first=Robert|wstitle=St. Lawrence, Nicholas|volume=50}}</ref> His motives are unclear; Lord Delvin claimed that Howth had been injured in some way by the Lord  Deputy, but Howth himself proclaimed his trust in him. More likely he was influenced by his second wife's father, Sir [[Nicholas White]], another bitter enemy of Dillon. This would explain his loss of favour with the Crown, since White's loyalty was deeply suspect, and he eventually died a prisoner in the [[Tower of London]].\n\nHowth in time was restored to favour and enjoyed friendly relations with the new  Lord Deputy, [[William Russell, 1st Baron Russell of Thornhaugh|Lord Russell]], whom he entertained at Howth Castle on his arrival in Ireland. The following year he accompanied Russell on his campaign against the O'Byrnes of [[Wicklow]] and the  Lord Deputy wrote that Howth deserved some words of thanks from the Queen.<ref name=\"DNB\"/> In 1598 he was praised highly for being one of the few nobles of [[the Pale]] to render useful assistance to Sir [[Henry Bagenal]] in his campaign against [[Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone|Hugh O'Neill]], although he later complained of the depredations of Bagenal's soldiers in the Pale.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nIn 1600 he was again the first of the leaders of the Pale to entertain a new Lord Deputy, [[Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy]], who formed a very high opinion of him and appointed him to act as Deputy in his absence.\nIn 1601 he went to London to discuss Irish affairs: the Queen who had already met and been impressed by Howth's  eldest son Christopher, also formed a high opinion of Howth himself.<ref name=eball/> On his return he was appointed to the [[Privy Council of Ireland]].\n\n== Religious conflict ==\nHowth's first wife Margaret was a daughter of Sir [[Christopher Barnewall]] of Turvey, who while outwardly conforming to the [[Church of Ireland]], had privately adhered to the Roman Catholic faith. Christopher's son [[Patrick Barnewall (died 1622)|Patrick Barnewall]] emerged in the early 1600s as spokesman for the Catholic nobility. Although they had been on bad terms  in the 1590s when they were engaged in a [[lawsuit]], he and Howth later became friendly and Howth, like Barnewall, openly professed his Catholic faith. In December 1605 he was one of the signatories to a petition that the [[Penal Laws]] should be modified, rather than extended.<ref name=\"DNB\"/> This was a risky step to take,  particularly just after the discovery of the [[Gunpowder Plot]], and Barnewall was sent to the [[Tower of London]] as a result, but Howth was left in peace. He enjoyed the confidence of yet another Deputy, Sir [[Arthur Chichester]], who was said to openly dispute with him the rival merits of the two faiths (this is rather surprising in view of Chichester's  vigorous enforcement of the [[Penal Laws]]). Possibly to forestall any action against Howth, Chichester wrote that he was old and would probably not live long.<ref name=eball/> This  prediction proved to be correct: Howth died in May 1607 and was buried in Howth Abbey.\n\n== Family ==\nBy his first wife Margaret (died 1576),   fifth daughter of Sir [[Christopher Barnewall]] of Turvey  and  his wife Marion Sherle,  he had three children:\n*[[Christopher St Lawrence, 10th Baron Howth]]\n*Thomas, who served with the [[Spanish army]]  in the [[Netherlands]]\n*Mary, who married William Eustace of [[Castlemartin House and Estate|Castlemartin]].\n\nBy his second wife Mary White, daughter of Sir [[Nicholas White]], [[Master of the Rolls in Ireland]]  and his second  wife  Miss Brereton of Kilcrow, County Meath,  he  had six further children:\n*Richard\n*Almeric\n*Edward\n*Margaret, who married firstly Jenico Preston, 5th [[Viscount Gormanston]] and secondly [[Luke Plunkett, 1st Earl of Fingall]]\n*Eleanor\n*Alison (see below).\n\n===Alison Luttrell===\nHis daughter Alison St Lawrence  married, as  his second wife, Thomas Luttrell of [[Luttrellstown Castle]],  [[Irish House of Commons|MP]]  for [[Dublin County (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Dublin County]],   in 1616.

The episode was written by series co-creators [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]], and directed by [[Mark Mylod]].\n\nAt Dragonstone, [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]] and [[Davos Seaworth]] meet with [[Daenerys Targaryen]], from whom Jon asks for aid in defeating the White Walkers, but Daenerys iterates her desire to take the Iron Throne instead. In King's Landing, [[Euron Greyjoy]] returns bearing gifts to [[Cersei Lannister]], in the form of [[Ellaria Sand]] and [[Tyene Sand]]. At the Citadel, [[Samwell Tarly]] and Archmaester Ebrose examine a now healed [[Jorah Mormont]]. In Winterfell, [[Sansa Stark]] is reunited with her brother [[Bran Stark]]. At Casterly Rock, the Unsullied infiltrate and capture the castle, but Euron's Iron Fleet arrives, and begins destroying their ships, leaving them stranded. Meanwhile, [[Jaime Lannister]] leads the Lannister army to take Highgarden.\n\nThe title of the episode refers to Cersei Lannister exacting vengeance, her own way of justice, on both the Sand Snakes and Olenna Tyrell. \"The Queen's Justice\" received positive reviews from critics, who considered the long-awaited meeting between Daenerys and Jon, the agonizing fates of Ellaria and Tyene Sand, Sansa and Bran's reunion, the bait-and-switch scene concerning Casterly Rock and Highgarden, and the final fates of Olenna Tyrell and Ellaria Sand as highlights of the episode. In the United States, it [[Nielsen ratings|achieved a viewership]] of 9.25 million in its initial broadcast. It was also [[Diana Rigg]]'s pick to support her nomination at the [[70th Primetime Emmy Awards]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Guest Actress]].\n\n\"The Queen's Justice\" marked the final appearances of [[Diana Rigg]] (Olenna Tyrell), [[Rosabell Laurenti Sellers]] (Tyene Sand) and [[Indira Varma]] (Ellaria Sand).\n\n==Plot==\n===On Dragonstone===\nJon and Davos arrive at Dragonstone with their soldiers and meet with Daenerys. Jon and Daenerys agree she is not responsible for her father's crimes, but Daenerys denies Jon's assertion he should not be held by his ancestors' oath to hers. Jon explains the threat of the White Walkers and wights, but Daenerys wants to claim the Iron Throne before considering other threats. Jon is forced to remain at Dragonstone.\n\nVarys asks Melisandre why she hides from Jon; she admits they parted on bad terms due to her mistakes. She plans to return to Volantis, and Varys warns that her life is in danger if she ever returns to Westeros, but she predicts that both of them will die in Westeros.\n\nSpeaking with Jon, Tyrion concedes that Jon's willingness to meet with Daenerys has convinced him that the White Walkers are real. Tyrion explains that Daenerys' followers are loyal because Daenerys dedicates herself to protecting others from threats she understands. Tyrion relays Jon's request to mine dragonglass on Dragonstone; Daenerys accepts Tyrion's recommendation to agree as a gesture of goodwill.\n\n===In the Narrow Sea===\nOne of the few remaining ships of Yara's fleet rescue Theon. The Ironborn disbelieve his claim that he tried to rescue Yara from Euron.\n\n===In King's Landing===\nEuron parades his captives Ellaria, Tyene, and Yara through abusive crowds in the streets of King's Landing. He presents the Sands as his gift to Cersei, and they are bound and gagged in the dungeon. Cersei kisses Tyene with the same poison Ellaria used to kill Myrcella, and tells Ellaria she will be kept alive to watch her daughter die and decompose.\n\nTycho Nestoris of the Iron Bank comes to collect repayment of the Lannisters' loans. Cersei denigrates Daenerys as a possible investment, and secures a [[fortnight]] to pay the debt.\n\n===At Winterfell===\nSansa competently manages Winterfell, preparing it as an emergency refuge for all Northerners. Littlefinger counsels Sansa to \"fight every battle\" mentally. Bran and Meera arrive, and Sansa is reunited with her brother. In the Godswood, Sansa is confused by Bran's revelation that he is the Three-Eyed Raven, and troubled by his specific knowledge of her suffering (\"[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken#in Winterfell|Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]\").\n\n===In Oldtown===\nArchmaester Ebrose proclaims that Jorah is healed of greyscale and releases him. Jorah plans to return to Daenerys. Sam admits that he administered the forbidden treatment; Ebrose praises his skill, but punishes his disobedience with an assignment to copy a large number of old documents.\n\n===At Casterly Rock===\n[[Grey Worm]] and the Unsullied infiltrate Casterly Rock via its sewers, which Tyrion designed. They capture the castle, finding far fewer defenders than expected. Meanwhile, the Iron Fleet arrives and destroys Daenerys' ships, stranding the Unsullied.\n\n===At Highgarden===\nJaime, Randyll, and their armies take Highgarden, having abandoned Casterly Rock to trick Daenerys into committing the Unsullied to a strategically useless position. Jaime grants Olenna the mercy of a quick and painless death by poison, over Cersei's original plans to execute her. After drinking the poison, Olenna confesses to murdering Joffrey and asks Jaime to tell Cersei. Incensed, Jaime leaves Olenna to die alone.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:D. B.

The episode featured the return of [[Mark Gatiss]] as Tycho Nestoris, who was last seen in season 5's \"[[The Dance of Dragons]]\".\n\n[[Kit Harington]] spoke about the scene he shot with [[Peter Dinklage]] in Spain, saying \"It was a beautiful location with 50 mph winds and I was wearing a cape next to a cliff\u2014There was a danger of me being blown off!

The shackles were felt-lined but tight, and Varma and Sellers ended up \"bruised and battered\" due to the physical intensity of their acting. Varma had to be cut from the shackles at the end of the day.<ref name=\"EW-worst-nightmare\"/>\n\n==Analysis==\nD. B. Weiss talked about the return of Bran to Winterfell, saying \"One of the things we loved about Game of Thrones from the very first book is it's not a world where magic is the primary driver of the story, it's a world where human psychology and behavior and desire are drivers of the story. We try very hard to make sure it stays that way because that's a lot more relatable to the vast majority of the audience than magic powers\u2014as much fun as those are. So with Bran, ideally you want to use him in a way that adds to the story and enriches the story and not in a way that's a magic bullet to conveniently deal with things that you haven't come up with a better way to deal with. So it was a balancing act to account for who Bran is now without letting that overtake the story.\"<ref name=\"issac_ew_interview\">{{cite web |url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/07/30/game-of-thrones-bran-stark-reunion/|title=Game of Thrones actor on that surprise 'Queen's Justice' reunion|first=James|last=Hibberd|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=July 30, 2017|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Isaac Hempstead Wright]] explained how the magical conversion has altered the characters personality, saying \"It's like imagining you have all of space and time in your head\u2014Bran is existing in thousands of planes of existence at any one time. So it's quite difficult for Bran to have any kind of semblance of personality anymore because he's really like a giant computer\". He went on to add that \"Bran really at this stage is not the Three-Eyed Raven. He's got the title but hasn't had thousands of years of sitting in a cave looking through time.

The episode was written by series co-creators [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]], and directed by [[Mark Mylod]].\n\nAt Dragonstone, [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]] and [[Davos Seaworth]] meet with [[Daenerys Targaryen]], from whom Jon asks for aid in defeating the White Walkers, but Daenerys iterates her desire to take the Iron Throne instead. In King's Landing, [[Euron Greyjoy]] returns bearing gifts to [[Cersei Lannister]], in the form of [[Ellaria Sand]] and [[Tyene Sand]]. At the Citadel, [[Samwell Tarly]] and Archmaester Ebrose examine a now healed [[Jorah Mormont]]. In Winterfell, [[Sansa Stark]] is reunited with her brother [[Bran Stark]]. At Casterly Rock, the Unsullied infiltrate and capture the castle, but Euron's Iron Fleet arrives, and begins destroying their ships, leaving them stranded. Meanwhile, [[Jaime Lannister]] leads the Lannister army to take Highgarden.\n\nThe title of the episode refers to Cersei Lannister exacting vengeance, her own way of justice, on both the Sand Snakes and Olenna Tyrell. \"The Queen's Justice\" received positive reviews from critics, who considered the long-awaited meeting between Daenerys and Jon, the agonizing fates of Ellaria and Tyene Sand, Sansa and Bran's reunion, the bait-and-switch scene concerning Casterly Rock and Highgarden, and the final fates of Olenna Tyrell and Ellaria Sand as highlights of the episode. In the United States, it [[Nielsen ratings|achieved a viewership]] of 9.25 million in its initial broadcast. It was also [[Diana Rigg]]'s pick to support her nomination at the [[70th Primetime Emmy Awards]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Guest Actress]].\n\n\"The Queen's Justice\" marked the final appearances of [[Diana Rigg]] (Olenna Tyrell), [[Rosabell Laurenti Sellers]] (Tyene Sand) and [[Indira Varma]] (Ellaria Sand).\n\n==Plot==\n===On Dragonstone===\nJon and Davos arrive at Dragonstone with their soldiers and meet with Daenerys. Jon and Daenerys agree she is not responsible for her father's crimes, but Daenerys denies Jon's assertion he should not be held by his ancestors' oath to hers. Jon explains the threat of the White Walkers and wights, but Daenerys wants to claim the Iron Throne before considering other threats. Jon is forced to remain at Dragonstone.\n\nVarys asks Melisandre why she hides from Jon; she admits they parted on bad terms due to her mistakes. She plans to return to Volantis, and Varys warns that her life is in danger if she ever returns to Westeros, but she predicts that both of them will die in Westeros.\n\nSpeaking with Jon, Tyrion concedes that Jon's willingness to meet with Daenerys has convinced him that the White Walkers are real. Tyrion explains that Daenerys' followers are loyal because Daenerys dedicates herself to protecting others from threats she understands. Tyrion relays Jon's request to mine dragonglass on Dragonstone; Daenerys accepts Tyrion's recommendation to agree as a gesture of goodwill.\n\n===In the Narrow Sea===\nOne of the few remaining ships of Yara's fleet rescue Theon. The Ironborn disbelieve his claim that he tried to rescue Yara from Euron.\n\n===In King's Landing===\nEuron parades his captives Ellaria, Tyene, and Yara through abusive crowds in the streets of King's Landing. He presents the Sands as his gift to Cersei, and they are bound and gagged in the dungeon. Cersei kisses Tyene with the same poison Ellaria used to kill Myrcella, and tells Ellaria she will be kept alive to watch her daughter die and decompose.\n\nTycho Nestoris of the Iron Bank comes to collect repayment of the Lannisters' loans. Cersei denigrates Daenerys as a possible investment, and secures a [[fortnight]] to pay the debt.\n\n===At Winterfell===\nSansa competently manages Winterfell, preparing it as an emergency refuge for all Northerners. Littlefinger counsels Sansa to \"fight every battle\" mentally. Bran and Meera arrive, and Sansa is reunited with her brother. In the Godswood, Sansa is confused by Bran's revelation that he is the Three-Eyed Raven, and troubled by his specific knowledge of her suffering (\"[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken#in Winterfell|Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]\").\n\n===In Oldtown===\nArchmaester Ebrose proclaims that Jorah is healed of greyscale and releases him. Jorah plans to return to Daenerys. Sam admits that he administered the forbidden treatment; Ebrose praises his skill, but punishes his disobedience with an assignment to copy a large number of old documents.\n\n===At Casterly Rock===\n[[Grey Worm]] and the Unsullied infiltrate Casterly Rock via its sewers, which Tyrion designed. They capture the castle, finding far fewer defenders than expected. Meanwhile, the Iron Fleet arrives and destroys Daenerys' ships, stranding the Unsullied.\n\n===At Highgarden===\nJaime, Randyll, and their armies take Highgarden, having abandoned Casterly Rock to trick Daenerys into committing the Unsullied to a strategically useless position. Jaime grants Olenna the mercy of a quick and painless death by poison, over Cersei's original plans to execute her. After drinking the poison, Olenna confesses to murdering Joffrey and asks Jaime to tell Cersei. Incensed, Jaime leaves Olenna to die alone.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:D. B.

The episode featured the return of [[Mark Gatiss]] as Tycho Nestoris, who was last seen in season 5's \"[[The Dance of Dragons]]\".\n\n[[Kit Harington]] spoke about the scene he shot with [[Peter Dinklage]] in Spain, saying \"It was a beautiful location with 50 mph winds and I was wearing a cape next to a cliff\u2014There was a danger of me being blown off! I'm not sure it's the way I would have wanted to go.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/07/30/game-of-thrones-jon-daenerys-meet/|title=Game of Thrones stars discuss their first on-screen meeting|first=James|last=Hibberd|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=July 30, 2017|accessdate=July 31, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIndira Varma and Rosabell Laurenti Sellers's last scene was technically difficult for the actresses, because they were shackled. The shackles were felt-lined but tight, and Varma and Sellers ended up \"bruised and battered\" due to the physical intensity of their acting. Varma had to be cut from the shackles at the end of the day.<ref name=\"EW-worst-nightmare\"/>\n\n==Analysis==\nD. B. Weiss talked about the return of Bran to Winterfell, saying \"One of the things we loved about Game of Thrones from the very first book is it's not a world where magic is the primary driver of the story, it's a world where human psychology and behavior and desire are drivers of the story. We try very hard to make sure it stays that way because that's a lot more relatable to the vast majority of the audience than magic powers\u2014as much fun as those are. So with Bran, ideally you want to use him in a way that adds to the story and enriches the story and not in a way that's a magic bullet to conveniently deal with things that you haven't come up with a better way to deal with. So it was a balancing act to account for who Bran is now without letting that overtake the story.\"<ref name=\"issac_ew_interview\">{{cite web |url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/07/30/game-of-thrones-bran-stark-reunion/|title=Game of Thrones actor on that surprise 'Queen's Justice' reunion|first=James|last=Hibberd|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=July 30, 2017|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Isaac Hempstead Wright]] explained how the magical conversion has altered the characters personality, saying \"It's like imagining you have all of space and time in your head\u2014Bran is existing in thousands of planes of existence at any one time. So it's quite difficult for Bran to have any kind of semblance of personality anymore because he's really like a giant computer\". He went on to add that \"Bran really at this stage is not the Three-Eyed Raven. He's got the title but hasn't had thousands of years of sitting in a cave looking through time.
