The [[market cross]] is on Market Place.\n\nThe manor of Huddersfield was owned by the [[de Lacy family]] until 1322, at which it reverted to royal ownership. In 1599, William Ramsden bought the manor, and the [[Ramsden baronets|Ramsden family]] continued to own the manor, which came to be known as the Ramsden Estate, until 1920.

When the West Riding County Council was formed in 1889, Huddersfield became a [[county borough]], exempt from county council control.\n\nIn 1920, the Corporation bought the Ramsden Estate from the Ramsden family, that had owned much of the town since 1599, for the sum of \u00a31.3&nbsp;million. As a result, the town became known for a time as 'the town that bought itself'.

Historically the town produced woollen textiles. This area of business, along with the chemical and engineering industries that emerged to support the manufacture of textiles, was the basis of the town's nineteenth and early twentieth century prosperity. The number of people who work in textiles has declined greatly, but the surviving companies produce large quantities of [[Woolen|woollen]] products with little labour. The town is home to textile, chemical and engineering companies, including Brook Motors Ltd founded by Ernest Brook in 1904. Against conventional wisdom, he started making [[alternating current]] electric motors, and he did this in one room with two assistants and starting capital of just \u00a3300. On its 50th anniversary in 1954 it employed more than 2,000 people and, with Ernest's sons Frank and Jack in charge, was the largest exclusive producer of AC motors in the world, and had a turnover of \u00a34,500,000. That same year Brook Motors Ltd operated 10 factories in Huddersfield, its biggest being Empress Works on St Thomas's Road, and opened one at Barugh Green, Barnsley.

It is in place to reduce [[urban sprawl]], prevent the towns in the [[West Yorkshire Urban Area]] conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage [[brownfield]] reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas, and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.<ref name=\"belt1\">{{cite web|title=Green Belt review|url=https://www.kirklees.gov.uk/beta/planning-policy/pdf/submission-documents/SD19_Kirklees_Local_Plan_Green_Belt_Review_April_2017.pdf/|website=www.kirklees.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe green belt surrounds the Huddersfield built-up area, separating towns and villages throughout the borough. Larger outlying communities such as Upper Hopton, Grange Moor, Highburton, [[Farnley Tyas]], Netherton, [[Honley]], [[Outlane]], [[Slaithwaite]], Wellhouse are also exempt from the green belt area. However, nearby smaller villages, hamlets and rural areas such as Thurgory, [[Gawthorpe, Kirklees|Gawthorpe Green]], Bog Green, Upper Heaton, [[Wilberlee]], [[South Crosland]], Rushfield Bridge, and Bank End are 'washed over' by the designation. Much semi-rural land on the fringes is also included.

Its professional football team, [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.]] play in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] after 2 seasons in the [[Premier League]]. In 1926, the club became the first in England to win three successive league titles, a feat only three other clubs have matched.\n\nThe town was the birthplace of rugby league, and is home to the [[Huddersfield Giants]] who play in the [[Super League]], the top division in Europe. The town is home to [[Huddersfield Underbank Rangers]] rugby league club, who play in the Rugby League Conference.\n[[Huddersfield Rugby Union Football Club]] play in the [[National Division Three North]], [[Huddersfield Y.M.C.A. RUFC]] who play in [[North 1 East]] and [[Huddersfield Rams Aussie Rules]] club. The main sporting arena is [[John Smith's Stadium]], home to both the football team and rugby league side. Also within the town boundaries is [[Emley A.F.C.]] who were formed when the original [[Wakefield FC|Emley FC]] left for Wakefield.\n\n===Rugby football===\nRugby was first played in the town in 1848 and the Huddersfield Athletic Club, the direct progenitors of [[Huddersfield Giants]], formed in 1864, played its first rugby game in 1866. It was in Huddersfield on 29 August 1895 that 22 northern clubs met in the [[George Hotel, Huddersfield|George Hotel]] and voted to [[Secession|secede]] from the [[Rugby Football Union]] and set up the 'Northern Rugby Football Union' which became the [[Rugby Football League]] in 1922. The [[Rugby League Heritage Centre]] was in the basement of the George Hotel before the hotel closed in 2013.\n\nFollowing the split of 1895, Huddersfield became a focus for rugby league and is represented by Huddersfield Giants in the Super League. [[Huddersfield Giants]], the town's rugby league club, has won the [[Rugby Football League Championship]] seven times, most recently in 1961\u201362, and the [[Challenge Cup]] six times, the last time in 1952\u201353.\n\n[[Underbank Rangers]] based in [[Holmfirth]] are the most prominent amateur club in the town, formed in 1884, and launched the careers of many professional players including [[Harold Wagstaff]], [[Paul Dixon (rugby league)|Paul Dixon]] and [[Eorl Crabtree]] who all served the Huddersfield club.\n\nAfter 1895 rugby was played exclusively under the auspices of the Northern Rugby Football Union until 1909 when Huddersfield Old Boys were formed to play under [[rugby union]] rules, playing nomadically at five grounds until buying farmland at [[Waterloo, Huddersfield|Waterloo]] in 1919 and, in 1946, renaming the club [[Huddersfield Rugby Union Football Club|Huddersfield RUFC]]. In 1969 the club was at the forefront of a revolution in English rugby when it became the first club in the country to organise mini and junior rugby teams. The innovation spread and almost every club in the country has a thriving junior section providing a production-line of home-grown talent. Junior players at Huddersfield number over 200. In 1997 the Waterloo junior grounds were sold and the {{convert|26|acre|km2|adj=on}} former [[Bass Brewery]] site at [[Huddersfield R.U.F.C.#Lockwood Park|Lockwood Park]] was purchased for its replacement. With the assistance of a \u00a32&nbsp;million grant from [[Sport England]], the club has transformed it into a major sports complex, conference centre and business park.\n\n===Association football===\n[[Huddersfield Town F.C.]] is the town's senior association football team, founded in 1908, and currently playing in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]].\nIn 1921\u201322 Huddersfield won the [[FA Cup]] and between 1923 and 1926 became the first club to win the [[Football League First Division|League Championship]] three times in a row, an achievement matched only by three other teams. After several decades in lower divisions, Huddersfield Town FC returned to top flight football in 2017 when the club entered the Premier League for the first time. The club left its ground at [[Leeds Road, Huddersfield|Leeds Road]] in 1994 and now shares the [[John Smith's Stadium]] with the Huddersfield Giants rugby league team.\n\nNotable ex-players include Scottish international [[Denis Law]], [[Ray Wilson (English footballer)|Ray Wilson]], a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] winner with [[England national football team|England]] in 1966 and [[Trevor Cherry]], England international.\n[[Herbert Chapman]], [[Bill Shankly]], [[Neil Warnock]] and [[Steve Bruce]] are notable former Huddersfield Town managers.\n\nThere are also 3 semi professional clubs within the town, [[Emley A.F.C.|Emley]], [[Shelley Community F.C.|Shelley]] and [[Golcar United F.C.|Golcar Utd]] who, in 2019/20 all competed in the [[2019\u201320 North West Counties Football League|North West Counties League]] Division One North, until the league was abandoned in March 2020 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]], all 3 clubs were [[2019\u201320 North West Counties Football League#Division One North|well placed]] and looking at promotion to the Premier Division\n\n===Other sports===\n[[Huddersfield Rams Aussie Rules]] is an Australian rules football team, formed in 2008.

The oldest pub is the Parish (formerly the Fleece Inn), the pub has been trading since 1720.\n\n==Education==\nAs well as primary and secondary schools, which cover compulsory and [[sixth form]] education for the town's population, Huddersfield has two [[sixth form college]]s: [[Huddersfield New College]] at [[Salendine Nook]] and [[Greenhead College]] west of the town centre. [[Huddersfield Grammar School]] is the only independent school for secondary education up to age 16. The town has a [[further education]] college, [[Kirklees College]] formed following the merger of Dewsbury College and Huddersfield Technical College. Its one establishment of higher education is the [[University of Huddersfield]], whose chancellor until 2019 was [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|the Duke of York]]. The actor [[Patrick Stewart]] from [[Mirfield]] is emeritus chancellor.\n\n==Health==\n[[File:HuddersfieldRoyalInfirmary.jpg|thumb|right|[[Huddersfield Royal Infirmary]].]]\n[[Huddersfield Royal Infirmary]] is situated in [[Lindley, West Yorkshire|Lindley]]. Medical services are split between there and the [[Calderdale Royal Hospital]] at [[Salterhebble]], near [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]]. [[Kirkwood Hospice]] provides care for the [[terminal illness|terminally ill]], and is dependent on donations and charitable gifts. Princess Royal Hospital provided [[maternity]] facilities until the risks of not being able to get an ambulance to [[Emergency department|A&E]] in the event of complications were judged to outweigh the benefits of specialist service provision. It now functions as a day clinic, [[family planning]] consultation centre and [[Sexual health clinic|GUM Clinic]]. A decision to move most maternity services provided by the Calderdale & Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust to the Calderdale Royal Hospital ended the provision in 2007, despite strong local opposition. The campaign was led by [[Save Huddersfield NHS]] which elected a councillor, Dr Jackie Grunsell in the Crosland Moor ward.  In January 2016 plans were announced to close the A&E department of Huddersfield Royal Infirmary and have all emergency cases go to Calderdale Royal instead.

This gave the regiment the right to march through the town with 'flags flying, bands playing and bayonets fixed'. Many of the town and district's male residents had served in the regiment during its long history. This right to march was technically lost when the County Borough itself was merged with Dewsbury to form Kirklees Metropolitan Borough Council though, unofficially, continued as on 25 March 1979, Kirklees Metropolitan Borough Council gave the Freedom of Kirklees to the 3rd battalion of the Yorkshire Volunteers. The 3rd Battalion was the Duke of Wellington's [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] unit.\n\n[[File:Yorkshire Regiment, Freedom of Huddersfield(RLH)2008-10-25.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Conferring the Freedom of Huddersfield on the [[Yorkshire Regiment]] 25 October 2008]]\nWhen the 'Dukes' were amalgamated with the [[Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire]] and the [[The Green Howards|Green Howards]]' to form the [[Yorkshire Regiment]] on 6 June 2006. The right to march was finally ended as the award did not give the right, for the freedom to march, to be passed on to any heirs or successors. The majority of the Yorkshire Regiment is now composed of soldiers from the north and eastern areas of Yorkshire. The Yorkshire Regiment requested the right to march to be transferred to them. However, the County Borough no longer exists and so there was no authority to do so. The 'Freedom' given by Kirklees to the 3rd battalion of the Yorkshire Volunteers did not permit any transfer to heirs or successors and effectively that freedom also ceased when the battalion was amalgamated into the [[East and West Riding Regiment]]. The East and West Riding Regiment ceased to exist on 6 June 2006, having been merged into the Yorkshire Regiment as its 4th Battalion. Kirklees Metropolitan Borough Council, as successors to the Huddersfield Borough Council, amended the original 'Freedom' and transferred the 'Freedom' to the Yorkshire Regiment, at a Freedom parade on 25 October 2008.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{See also|Category: People from Huddersfield}}\n\nA number of national and internationally famous people originate from Huddersfield.

The borough comprised the parishes of Almondbury, Dalton, Huddersfield, Lindley-cum-Quarmby and Lockwood. When the West Riding County Council was formed in 1889, Huddersfield became a [[county borough]], exempt from county council control.\n\nIn 1920, the Corporation bought the Ramsden Estate from the Ramsden family, that had owned much of the town since 1599, for the sum of \u00a31.3&nbsp;million. As a result, the town became known for a time as 'the town that bought itself'. To this day, much of the freehold of the town belongs to the local authority.<ref name=hudhist/>\n\nHuddersfield expanded in 1937, assimilating parts of the [[Golcar]], [[Linthwaite]], and [[South Crosland]] urban districts.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10166937&c_id=10001043\n |title=Huddersfield MB/CB West Riding through time &#124; Administrative history of Local Government District: hierarchies, boundaries\n |publisher=Visionofbritain.org.uk\n |accessdate=9 October 2008\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205230529/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10166937&c_id=10001043\n |archivedate=5 December 2007\n}}</ref> The county borough was abolished in 1974 and its former area was combined with that of other districts to form the Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees in West Yorkshire.\n\nAttempts by the council to gain support for [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] were rejected by the population in an unofficial referendum held by the ''[[Huddersfield Daily Examiner]]''.

The current Member of Parliament (MP) for the [[Huddersfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Huddersfield constituency]] is [[Barry Sheerman]], a [[Labour Co-operative]] member.\n\nAccording to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001]] the population of the Huddersfield urban sub-area of the [[West Yorkshire Urban Area]] was 146,234, and the population of the former area of the county borough was 121,620. The wider South Kirklees area had a population of 216,011.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Industry==\nHuddersfield is a manufacturing town, despite the university being the largest employer. Historically the town produced woollen textiles. This area of business, along with the chemical and engineering industries that emerged to support the manufacture of textiles, was the basis of the town's nineteenth and early twentieth century prosperity. The number of people who work in textiles has declined greatly, but the surviving companies produce large quantities of [[Woolen|woollen]] products with little labour. The town is home to textile, chemical and engineering companies, including Brook Motors Ltd founded by Ernest Brook in 1904. Against conventional wisdom, he started making [[alternating current]] electric motors, and he did this in one room with two assistants and starting capital of just \u00a3300. On its 50th anniversary in 1954 it employed more than 2,000 people and, with Ernest's sons Frank and Jack in charge, was the largest exclusive producer of AC motors in the world, and had a turnover of \u00a34,500,000. That same year Brook Motors Ltd operated 10 factories in Huddersfield, its biggest being Empress Works on St Thomas's Road, and opened one at Barugh Green, Barnsley. Other local manufacturers are [[Cummins|Cummins Turbo Technologies]], founded in 1952 as Holset by Messrs.

Its professional football team, [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.]] play in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] after 2 seasons in the [[Premier League]]. In 1926, the club became the first in England to win three successive league titles, a feat only three other clubs have matched.\n\nThe town was the birthplace of rugby league, and is home to the [[Huddersfield Giants]] who play in the [[Super League]], the top division in Europe.

It was in Huddersfield on 29 August 1895 that 22 northern clubs met in the [[George Hotel, Huddersfield|George Hotel]] and voted to [[Secession|secede]] from the [[Rugby Football Union]] and set up the 'Northern Rugby Football Union' which became the [[Rugby Football League]] in 1922. The [[Rugby League Heritage Centre]] was in the basement of the George Hotel before the hotel closed in 2013.\n\nFollowing the split of 1895, Huddersfield became a focus for rugby league and is represented by Huddersfield Giants in the Super League.

In 1969 the club was at the forefront of a revolution in English rugby when it became the first club in the country to organise mini and junior rugby teams. The innovation spread and almost every club in the country has a thriving junior section providing a production-line of home-grown talent. Junior players at Huddersfield number over 200. In 1997 the Waterloo junior grounds were sold and the {{convert|26|acre|km2|adj=on}} former [[Bass Brewery]] site at [[Huddersfield_R.U.F.C.#Lockwood_Park|Lockwood Park]] was purchased for its replacement.

After several decades in lower divisions, Huddersfield Town FC returned to top flight football in 2017 when the club entered the Premier League for the first time.

The festival is organised like a pub crawl, moving between venues to experience different tastes of culture.  Its first year running was 2016 - which had 10 live music acts, an exhibition and some live art, doing it all on a shoestring budget.  \n  \nTheir aim is to put on an all day journey through town, visiting some of the finest music venues in Huddersfield.  The first few venues are completely free in but to join the evening events organisers ask for a small contribution to pay the artists.\n    \nThe organisers say they started this festival because they LOVE LIVE MUSIC.  They believe the Huddersfield Music Scene needs some nourishment and they want audiences to be rewarded for being excellent.  All year and every year the audiences of Huddersfield show love, respect and kindness to their performing musicians thus, deserve to have this festival in their town. \n\n==Present day==\n\n===Shopping===\nHuddersfield has a large and diverse retail shopping area, enclosed within the town's ring road, compared with other towns of its size. There are three shopping areas: [[Kingsgate Shopping Centre|Kingsgate]], The Packhorse Precinct and The Piazza Centre. The Piazza offers an outdoor shopping mall near the public library, with a grassed area, used for relaxation and events throughout the year such as entertainment, international markets and iceskating in winter. Through the adjacent Market Arcade is a covered market hall, which has listed building status, due in part to its distinctive roof formed by [[Hyperbola|hyperbolic]] [[paraboloid]]s. It is adjacent to the town hall and public library. An open market is located next to [[Tesco]], on the opposite side of the town centre.\n\nThe town centre is home to several national high street retailers and chain stores including [[Clinton Cards]], [[GAME (retailer)|GAME]], [[House of Fraser]], [[JD Sports]], [[Sports Direct]] (formerly JJB), [[W H Smith]]s and [[Wilko (retailer)|Wilko]]; up until January 2008, it also had a [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]]. Fast food outlets include [[KFC]], [[McDonald's]], [[Pizza Hut]], [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], [[Wimpy Bar|Wimpy]] and [[Nando's]]. High street clothing and fashion retail outlets such as, [[Marks & Spencer]], [[River Island]], [[Topman]] and [[Next (clothing)|Next]]. There are three major supermarket outlets located in the town centre, and alongside the ring road: two [[Sainsbury's]] and one Tesco. In 2014 a small [[Morrisons]] store opened in the town centre located in the building previously occupied by [[Burger King]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/west-yorkshire-news/huddersfield-burger-king-closes-make-6176592/ |newspaper=The Huddersfield Daily Examiner |title=Huddersfield Burger King closes to make way for Morrisons store |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224101647/http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/west-yorkshire-news/huddersfield-burger-king-closes-make-6176592 |archivedate=24 December 2013 }}</ref> Shortly after opening the Morrisons closed and the space was taken by a Foot Asylum.  There are also a variety of small specialist and independent shops, many located in the three-storey Victorian shopping arcade, Byram Arcade, situated on Westgate.\n\nHowever over the last decade many shops have closed down causing a general decline of the town centre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/news/business/high-street-chains-left-huddersfield-15691605|title=High street chains that have left our town centre in last 10 years|last=Himelfield|first=Dave|date=2019-01-17|website=huddersfieldexaminer|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref> Most notability the closure of [[British Home Stores|British Home Stores (BHS)]] in 2016 left a large shopping unit empty in The Piazza Centre.

Kelly Rowlands also holds the 2003 Line Dancing championship Record.\n\nThe [[John Smith's Stadium]], (formerly the Galpharm Stadium and Alfred McAlpine Stadium), is a multi-use sports stadium with a gym, swimming pool, spa and offers sporting classes. The stadium is home to Huddersfield Giants and Huddersfield Town football team. Adjacent the stadium is an [[Odeon Cinemas|Odeon cinema]] (formerly UCI).\n\nThere are many pubs, restaurants and night clubs, one of which, [[Tokyo Industries|Tokyo]], which closed in 2019, occupies the former Huddersfield [[County Court]], a 19th-century [[Grade II listed building]]. The oldest pub is the Parish (formerly the Fleece Inn), the pub has been trading since 1720.\n\n==Education==\nAs well as primary and secondary schools, which cover compulsory and [[sixth form]] education for the town's population, Huddersfield has two [[sixth form college]]s: [[Huddersfield New College]] at [[Salendine Nook]] and [[Greenhead College]] west of the town centre. [[Huddersfield Grammar School]] is the only independent school for secondary education up to age 16. The town has a [[further education]] college, [[Kirklees College]] formed following the merger of Dewsbury College and Huddersfield Technical College. Its one establishment of higher education is the [[University of Huddersfield]], whose chancellor until 2019 was [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|the Duke of York]]. The actor [[Patrick Stewart]] from [[Mirfield]] is emeritus chancellor.\n\n==Health==\n[[File:HuddersfieldRoyalInfirmary.jpg|thumb|right|[[Huddersfield Royal Infirmary]].]]\n[[Huddersfield Royal Infirmary]] is situated in [[Lindley, West Yorkshire|Lindley]]. Medical services are split between there and the [[Calderdale Royal Hospital]] at [[Salterhebble]], near [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]]. [[Kirkwood Hospice]] provides care for the [[terminal illness|terminally ill]], and is dependent on donations and charitable gifts. Princess Royal Hospital provided [[maternity]] facilities until the risks of not being able to get an ambulance to [[Emergency department|A&E]] in the event of complications were judged to outweigh the benefits of specialist service provision. It now functions as a day clinic, [[family planning]] consultation centre and [[Sexual health clinic|GUM Clinic]]. A decision to move most maternity services provided by the Calderdale & Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust to the Calderdale Royal Hospital ended the provision in 2007, despite strong local opposition. The campaign was led by [[Save Huddersfield NHS]] which elected a councillor, Dr Jackie Grunsell in the Crosland Moor ward.  In January 2016 plans were announced to close the A&E department of Huddersfield Royal Infirmary and have all emergency cases go to Calderdale Royal instead. This sparked uproar in local communities as it would mean journeys from some areas of over 40 minutes to and from the hospital assuming that the main road into Halifax was not congested, as it frequently is.<ref>{{cite news|title=RECAP: Huddersfield Royal Infirmary set to be demolished as part of A&E closure plan|url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/recap-huddersfield-royal-infirmary-set-10739008|work=The Huddersfield Examiner|date=15 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe former [[St Luke's Hospital, Huddersfield|St. Luke's Hospital]] in [[Crosland Moor]] mostly provided [[geriatric]] and [[psychiatric]] care.

This gave the regiment the right to march through the town with 'flags flying, bands playing and bayonets fixed'. Many of the town and district's male residents had served in the regiment during its long history. This right to march was technically lost when the County Borough itself was merged with Dewsbury to form Kirklees Metropolitan Borough Council though, unofficially, continued as on 25 March 1979, Kirklees Metropolitan Borough Council gave the Freedom of Kirklees to the 3rd battalion of the Yorkshire Volunteers. The 3rd Battalion was the Duke of Wellington's [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] unit.\n\n[[File:Yorkshire Regiment, Freedom of Huddersfield(RLH)2008-10-25.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Conferring the Freedom of Huddersfield on the [[Yorkshire Regiment]] 25 October 2008]]\nWhen the 'Dukes' were amalgamated with the [[Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire]] and the [[The Green Howards|Green Howards]]' to form the [[Yorkshire Regiment]] on 6 June 2006. The right to march was finally ended as the award did not give the right, for the freedom to march, to be passed on to any heirs or successors. The majority of the Yorkshire Regiment is now composed of soldiers from the north and eastern areas of Yorkshire. The Yorkshire Regiment requested the right to march to be transferred to them. However, the County Borough no longer exists and so there was no authority to do so. The 'Freedom' given by Kirklees to the 3rd battalion of the Yorkshire Volunteers did not permit any transfer to heirs or successors and effectively that freedom also ceased when the battalion was amalgamated into the [[East and West Riding Regiment]]. The East and West Riding Regiment ceased to exist on 6 June 2006, having been merged into the Yorkshire Regiment as its 4th Battalion. Kirklees Metropolitan Borough Council, as successors to the Huddersfield Borough Council, amended the original 'Freedom' and transferred the 'Freedom' to the Yorkshire Regiment, at a Freedom parade on 25 October 2008.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{See also|Category: People from Huddersfield}}\n\nA number of national and internationally famous people originate from Huddersfield.
