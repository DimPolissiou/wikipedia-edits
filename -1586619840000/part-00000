It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]]. The local pronunciation is ''Dorrahasson''.\n\n==Geography==\n\nDerrycassan is bounded on the north by [[Kilnavert]] and [[Corran, County Cavan|Corran]] townlands, on the  west by [[Camagh]],  [[Sruhagh]] and [[Gorteen, Templeport]] townlands, on the south by Derryniggin in [[County Leitrim]] and [[Burren (townland)|Burren]] townland and on the east by [[Coologe]] and [[Toberlyan]] townlands. Its chief geographical features are [[Coologe]] Lake, Derrycassan Lake and [[Camagh]] Lough. Derrycassan is traversed by a public road and several rural lanes. The townland covers 498 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nThe earliest surviving mention of the townland name is ''Doire Cas\u00e1in'', which appears in an interesting list of the rents  due to the McGovern Chief, [[Maghnus 'Ruadh' M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in]] about 1400 A.D.<ref>{{Citation |author= L.

The introduction to the translation translates as\n{{Quote|This book was written A.D. 1487, and in the same year died O'Reilly, to wit, Turlough, son of John; and in the same year were slain the sons of O'Rourke, to wit, Tiernan and Brian Roe, to wit, Tiernan was slain by the sons of MacDermot and by Muintir-Eolais in treachery, and Brian by a son of O'Rourke, to wit, by Owen, son of Felim, son of Donough, son of Tiernan; and in the same year was slain Tiernan Duv, son of Donough Blind-eye Tiernan by O'Donnell, to wit, by Hugh Roe O'Donnell; and in the same year was demolished the castle of O'Rourke, to wit, Felim, son of Donough by O'Donnell and by the sons of O'Rourke; and in the same year the fortress of Lough Oughter was taken possession of by the race of Donnell Ban O'Reilly.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]]. The local pronunciation is ''Dorrahasson''.\n\n==Geography==\n\nDerrycassan is bounded on the north by [[Kilnavert]] and [[Corran, County Cavan|Corran]] townlands, on the  west by [[Camagh]],  [[Sruhagh]] and [[Gorteen, Templeport]] townlands, on the south by Derryniggin in [[County Leitrim]] and [[Burren (townland)|Burren]] townland and on the east by [[Coologe]] and [[Toberlyan]] townlands. Its chief geographical features are [[Coologe]] Lake, Derrycassan Lake and [[Camagh]] Lough. Derrycassan is traversed by a public road and several rural lanes. The townland covers 498 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nThe earliest surviving mention of the townland name is ''Doire Cas\u00e1in'', which appears in an interesting list of the rents  due to the McGovern Chief, [[Maghnus 'Ruadh' M\u00e1g Samhradh\u00e1in]] about 1400 A.D.<ref>{{Citation |author= L.

It follows a [[primatology|primatologist]] who must team up with George, an albino [[gorilla]] who turns into a raging creature of enormous size as a result of a rogue experiment, to stop two other mutated animals that include a [[wolf]] named Ralph and a [[crocodile]] named Lizzie, from destroying [[Chicago]].

Dr. Kerry Atkins, the lone surviving crew member, is ordered by Energyne CEO Claire Wyden to retrieve canisters containing a pathogen. Atkins flees in the escape pod when the station implodes, but it disintegrates upon re-entry, killing her and leaving a trail of debris across the United States. One canister is swallowed by an [[American crocodile]] in the [[Everglades]], and another lands in a [[Wyoming]] forest where a [[wolf]] is exposed to the pathogen.\n\n[[Primatology|Primatologist]] Davis Okoye, a former [[Special Forces (United States Army)|US Army Special Forces]] soldier and member of an anti-poaching unit, works at the San Diego Wildlife Sanctuary. He has befriended a rare [[Albinism|albino]] [[western lowland gorilla]] named George, having saved it from the poachers who killed his mother, and communicates with George using [[sign language]]. One of the canisters crash-lands in George's habitat, and George is exposed to the pathogen.\n\nAs George grows considerably larger and more aggressive, Davis is contacted by genetic engineer Dr. Kate Caldwell, who explains that the pathogen was developed by Energyne to rewrite genes on a massive scale. She had hoped to advance [[CRISPR]] research as a potential cure for diseases, but discovered Energyne's plans to use it as a biological weapon, and was fired and falsely sent to prison, resulting in the death of her terminally ill brother. George escapes from captivity and goes on a rampage at the preserve. He is calmed, but George is captured by a government team led by Agent Harvey Russell and put on an airplane. Meanwhile, Claire and her brother Brett oversee a mercenary team's attempt to capture the mutated wolf, Ralph, which ends in failure and the slaughter of the entire team.\n\nClaire, hoping to capture Ralph and use George to kill Kate, uses a massive transmitter atop the [[Willis Tower]] to lure the animals \u2013 engineered to respond aggressively to a certain radio frequency \u2013 to [[Chicago]], unconcerned about the massive risk to civilian lives this poses. George reacts violently to the sound and crashes the plane, though Davis, Kate, and Russell parachute to safety. George survives the crash and joins Ralph as they make their way to Chicago, and Davis and Kate are aided by Russell in stealing a military helicopter in pursuit.\n\nThey arrive to find George and Ralph tearing through the city as the military struggles to contain them. The situation worsens when the mutated crocodile, Lizzie, joins George and Ralph. Planning to steal a counter-serum to turn the mutated animals back to normal, Davis and Kate infiltrate Energyne headquarters at the Willis Tower and take several vials of the serum, but are caught by Claire and Brett. Claire reveals that the serum only eliminates the animals' enhanced aggressiveness rather than revert them to their normal size, and shoots Davis, but he survives. When George climbs to the top of the tower, Claire orders Davis to distract it while she attempts to escape with Kate at gunpoint. Kate slips a vial into Claire's handbag and pushes her toward George, who eats Claire along with the serum, killing her and returning it to his normal personality. Below, Russell takes incriminating evidence from Brett, who is crushed to death by falling debris. As the damaged tower topples, Davis and Kate survive by crash-landing a helicopter on Federal Plaza.\n\nDavis stays in the city to help George defeat the other two monsters, while Kate and Russell rush to prevent the military from deploying a [[GBU-43/B MOAB|MOAB]] against the creatures. George fights Ralph, whom Davis tricks into flying into Lizzie's jaws, decapitating the wolf. Lizzie chases Davis, but George intervenes in time for Davis to incapacitate the crocodile with grenades. However, Lizzie survives and overpowers George, who is impaled by rebar. Davis distracts Lizzie using a fallen Apache helicopter, but is nearly killed before George stabs Lizzie through the eye with the same rebar, killing it. With the threat neutralized, the airstrike is aborted. In the aftermath, George and Davis, joined by Kate and Russell, help clear the city of debris and rescue civilians.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Humans===\n<!--- Cast per tombstone closing credits, \u201cAnd\u201d credit (Morgan) after the two leads, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] as Davis Okoye, a former [[US Army Special Forces]] soldier as well as [[primatologist]] and head of an anti-[[poaching]] unit.<ref name=\"JohnsonRampage\"/>\n* [[Naomie Harris]] as Dr. Kate Caldwell, a disgraced genetic engineer who teams up with Okoye.<ref>{{cite news |title=Naomie Harris stuns in Gucci alongside Dwayne Johnson at Rampage premiere |url=https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/movies/naomie-harris-stuns-in-gucci-alongside-dwayne-johnson-at-rampage-premiere-36798554.html |date=April 14, 2008 |access-date=April 14, 2018 |author=Press Association Reporter |newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]}}</ref>\n* [[Malin \u00c5kerman]] as Claire Wyden, the CEO of Energyne responsible for the infection and mutation of George, Ralph, and Lizzie with the mutagenic serum for Project: Rampage.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/rampage-interview-jeffrey-dean-morgan-malin-ackerman-rampage-watchmen/ |title=Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Malin Akerman & Naomie Harris on \u2018Rampage\u2019 and HBO\u2019s \u2018Watchmen\u2019 Series |last=Foutch |first=Haleigh |date=April 13, 2018 |access-date=April 14, 2018 |work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex Media]]}}</ref>\n* [[Jake Lacy]] as Brett Wyden, Claire's dimwit brother.\n* [[Joe Manganiello]] as Burke, the leader of a private military group.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://movieweb.com/rampage-movie-2018-set-photo-joe-manganiello-costume/ |title=Joe Manganiello Reveals His Monster-Fighting Rampage Costume |last=Gallagher |first=Brian |date=May 24, 2017 |access-date=April 14, 2018 |work=[[MovieWeb]] |publisher=Watchr Media}}</ref>\n* [[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]] as Harvey Russell, a government agent who works for the \"[[CIA|Other Government Agency]]\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Alexander |first=Bryan |title='Rampage' star Jeffrey Dean Morgan gets emotional about loss, love and baby girl George |url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/04/11/rampage-walking-dead-jeffrey-dean-morgan-emotional-baby-girl-george/501876002/ |date=12 April 2018 |access-date=22 May 2018 |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]]}}</ref>\n* [[P.

Up to 15,000 photographs were taken with 3D scanners, while motion cameras covered downtown Chicago. As reference for the building destruction, the artists studied both the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] [[September 11 attacks|attacks]] and implosions of buildings affected by the [[2016 Kaikoura earthquake]] in Weta's hometown of [[Wellington]]. One of the more challenging aspects for Weta was figuring out how the weight and mass of the monsters would affect the city environment and destruction.<ref>{{cite|url=http://vfxvoice.com/weta-digital-gives-weight-to-the-giant-monsters-of-rampage/ |title=Weta Digital Gives Weight to the Giant Monsters of Rampage|last=Failes|first=Ian|date=May 2, 2018|work=VFXVoice.com|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\nGiven Weta had plenty of experience creating animated apes in ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' and ''[[Rise of the Planet of the Apes]]'' and its sequels ''[[Dawn of the Planet of the Apes|Dawn]]'' and ''[[War for the Planet of the Apes|War]]'', it helped the studio create George \"in a much shorter time than it may have 10 years ago,\" according to Winquist. Motion capture coach [[Terry Notary]] even took a break from ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', which was also filmed in Atlanta, to help Jason Liles in his performance as George. On the other hand, the lack of motion capture for Ralph and Lizzie let the animators go loose with how these monsters were portrayed, such as \"a wolf that has porcupine spines and wings\".<ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/film/103218438/rampage-postearthquake-demolition-inspires-the-rocks-latest-actioner |title=Rampage: Post-earthquake demolition inspires The Rock's latest actioner|last=McDonald |first=Dani|date=April 20, 2018|work=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|publisher=Stuff|accessdate=April 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOther VFX companies like [[Hydraulx]], [[Scanline VFX]] and UPP contributed to the film.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=January 1, 2019|title=RAMPAGE - The Art of VFXThe Art of VFX|url=https://www.artofvfx.com/rampage/|website=www.artofvfx.com}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Rampage (soundtrack)}}\nThe music was composed by [[Andrew Lockington]].

The film stars [[Dwayne Johnson]], [[Naomie Harris]], [[Malin \u00c5kerman]], [[Jake Lacy]], [[Joe Manganiello]], and [[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]]. It follows a [[primatology|primatologist]] who must team up with George, an albino [[gorilla]] who turns into a raging creature of enormous size as a result of a rogue experiment, to stop two other mutated animals that include a [[wolf]] named Ralph and a [[crocodile]] named Lizzie, from destroying [[Chicago]].\n\nThe film is the third collaboration between Peyton and Johnson, following ''[[Journey 2: The Mysterious Island]]'' (2012) and ''[[San Andreas (film)|San Andreas]]'' (2015). Even though their company is uncredited, ''Rampage'' also marked the final released Warner Bros. film to be financed by [[Access Industries|Access Entertainment]]/[[RatPac-Dune Entertainment]] as the studio had ended their partnership with the company due to sexual harassment allegations against RatPac-Dune owner [[Brett Ratner]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/brett-ratner-warners-cofinancing-deal-ends-1202750809/|title=Warners Bros.

The film was released in the United States on April 13, 2018, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], in 2D, [[RealD 3D]] and [[IMAX]].

Dr. Kerry Atkins, the lone surviving crew member, is ordered by Energyne CEO Claire Wyden to retrieve canisters containing a pathogen. Atkins flees in the escape pod when the station implodes, but it disintegrates upon re-entry, killing her and leaving a trail of debris across the United States. One canister is swallowed by an [[American crocodile]] in the [[Everglades]], and another lands in a [[Wyoming]] forest where a [[wolf]] is exposed to the pathogen.\n\n[[Primatology|Primatologist]] Davis Okoye, a former [[Special Forces (United States Army)|US Army Special Forces]] soldier and member of an anti-poaching unit, works at the San Diego Wildlife Sanctuary. He has befriended a rare [[Albinism|albino]] [[western lowland gorilla]] named George, having saved it from the poachers who killed his mother, and communicates with George using [[sign language]]. One of the canisters crash-lands in George's habitat, and George is exposed to the pathogen.\n\nAs George grows considerably larger and more aggressive, Davis is contacted by genetic engineer Dr. Kate Caldwell, who explains that the pathogen was developed by Energyne to rewrite genes on a massive scale. She had hoped to advance [[CRISPR]] research as a potential cure for diseases, but discovered Energyne's plans to use it as a biological weapon, and was fired and falsely sent to prison, resulting in the death of her terminally ill brother. George escapes from captivity and goes on a rampage at the preserve. He is calmed, but George is captured by a government team led by Agent Harvey Russell and put on an airplane. Meanwhile, Claire and her brother Brett oversee a mercenary team's attempt to capture the mutated wolf, Ralph, which ends in failure and the slaughter of the entire team.\n\nClaire, hoping to capture Ralph and use George to kill Kate, uses a massive transmitter atop the [[Willis Tower]] to lure the animals \u2013 engineered to respond aggressively to a certain radio frequency \u2013 to [[Chicago]], unconcerned about the massive risk to civilian lives this poses. George reacts violently to the sound and crashes the plane, though Davis, Kate, and Russell parachute to safety. George survives the crash and joins Ralph as they make their way to Chicago, and Davis and Kate are aided by Russell in stealing a military helicopter in pursuit.\n\nThey arrive to find George and Ralph tearing through the city as the military struggles to contain them. The situation worsens when the mutated crocodile, Lizzie, joins George and Ralph. Planning to steal a counter-serum to turn the mutated animals back to normal, Davis and Kate infiltrate Energyne headquarters at the Willis Tower and take several vials of the serum, but are caught by Claire and Brett. Claire reveals that the serum only eliminates the animals' enhanced aggressiveness rather than revert them to their normal size, and shoots Davis, but he survives. When George climbs to the top of the tower, Claire orders Davis to distract it while she attempts to escape with Kate at gunpoint. Kate slips a vial into Claire's handbag and pushes her toward George, who eats Claire along with the serum, killing her and returning it to his normal personality. Below, Russell takes incriminating evidence from Brett, who is crushed to death by falling debris. As the damaged tower topples, Davis and Kate survive by crash-landing a helicopter on Federal Plaza.\n\nDavis stays in the city to help George defeat the other two monsters, while Kate and Russell rush to prevent the military from deploying a [[GBU-43/B MOAB|MOAB]] against the creatures. George fights Ralph, whom Davis tricks into flying into Lizzie's jaws, decapitating the wolf. Lizzie chases Davis, but George intervenes in time for Davis to incapacitate the crocodile with grenades. However, Lizzie survives and overpowers George, who is impaled by rebar. Davis distracts Lizzie using a fallen Apache helicopter, but is nearly killed before George stabs Lizzie through the eye with the same rebar, killing it. With the threat neutralized, the airstrike is aborted. In the aftermath, George and Davis, joined by Kate and Russell, help clear the city of debris and rescue civilians.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Humans===\n<!--- Cast per tombstone closing credits, \u201cAnd\u201d credit (Morgan) after the two leads, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Dwayne Johnson]] as Davis Okoye, a former [[US Army Special Forces]] soldier as well as [[primatologist]] and head of an anti-[[poaching]] unit.<ref name=\"JohnsonRampage\"/>\n* [[Naomie Harris]] as Dr. Kate Caldwell, a disgraced genetic engineer who teams up with Okoye.<ref>{{cite news |title=Naomie Harris stuns in Gucci alongside Dwayne Johnson at Rampage premiere |url=https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/movies/naomie-harris-stuns-in-gucci-alongside-dwayne-johnson-at-rampage-premiere-36798554.html |date=April 14, 2008 |access-date=April 14, 2018 |author=Press Association Reporter |newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]}}</ref>\n* [[Malin \u00c5kerman]] as Claire Wyden, the CEO of Energyne responsible for the infection and mutation of George, Ralph, and Lizzie with the mutagenic serum for Project: Rampage.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/rampage-interview-jeffrey-dean-morgan-malin-ackerman-rampage-watchmen/ |title=Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Malin Akerman & Naomie Harris on \u2018Rampage\u2019 and HBO\u2019s \u2018Watchmen\u2019 Series |last=Foutch |first=Haleigh |date=April 13, 2018 |access-date=April 14, 2018 |work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex Media]]}}</ref>\n* [[Jake Lacy]] as Brett Wyden, Claire's dimwit brother.\n* [[Joe Manganiello]] as Burke, the leader of a private military group.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://movieweb.com/rampage-movie-2018-set-photo-joe-manganiello-costume/ |title=Joe Manganiello Reveals His Monster-Fighting Rampage Costume |last=Gallagher |first=Brian |date=May 24, 2017 |access-date=April 14, 2018 |work=[[MovieWeb]] |publisher=Watchr Media}}</ref>\n* [[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]] as Harvey Russell, a government agent who works for the \"[[CIA|Other Government Agency]]\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Alexander |first=Bryan |title='Rampage' star Jeffrey Dean Morgan gets emotional about loss, love and baby girl George |url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/04/11/rampage-walking-dead-jeffrey-dean-morgan-emotional-baby-girl-george/501876002/ |date=12 April 2018 |access-date=22 May 2018 |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |publisher=[[Gannett Company]]}}</ref>\n* [[P.

Up to 15,000 photographs were taken with 3D scanners, while motion cameras covered downtown Chicago. As reference for the building destruction, the artists studied both the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] [[September 11 attacks|attacks]] and implosions of buildings affected by the [[2016 Kaikoura earthquake]] in Weta's hometown of [[Wellington]]. One of the more challenging aspects for Weta was figuring out how the weight and mass of the monsters would affect the city environment and destruction.<ref>{{cite|url=http://vfxvoice.com/weta-digital-gives-weight-to-the-giant-monsters-of-rampage/ |title=Weta Digital Gives Weight to the Giant Monsters of Rampage|last=Failes|first=Ian|date=May 2, 2018|work=VFXVoice.com|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\nGiven Weta had plenty of experience creating animated apes in ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' and ''[[Rise of the Planet of the Apes]]'' and its sequels ''[[Dawn of the Planet of the Apes|Dawn]]'' and ''[[War for the Planet of the Apes|War]]'', it helped the studio create George \"in a much shorter time than it may have 10 years ago,\" according to Winquist. Motion capture coach [[Terry Notary]] even took a break from ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', which was also filmed in Atlanta, to help Jason Liles in his performance as George. On the other hand, the lack of motion capture for Ralph and Lizzie let the animators go loose with how these monsters were portrayed, such as \"a wolf that has porcupine spines and wings\".<ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/film/103218438/rampage-postearthquake-demolition-inspires-the-rocks-latest-actioner |title=Rampage: Post-earthquake demolition inspires The Rock's latest actioner|last=McDonald |first=Dani|date=April 20, 2018|work=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|publisher=Stuff|accessdate=April 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOther VFX companies like [[Hydraulx]], [[Scanline VFX]] and UPP contributed to the film.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=January 1, 2019|title=RAMPAGE - The Art of VFXThe Art of VFX|url=https://www.artofvfx.com/rampage/|website=www.artofvfx.com}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Rampage (soundtrack)}}\nThe music was composed by [[Andrew Lockington]].

Such flares last about twice as long as those from the main mission antennas (MMA), because the so-called \"mirror angle\" for the solar panels is twice that for the MMAs.

Attaway's own family was part of this population shift from South to North when he was a child.\n\nHis novel follows the Moss brothers as they escape the inequality of [[sharecropping]] in the South only to encounter inequality in the [[Steel mill|mills]] of the North. Their story illustrates the tragedy and hardships many Black Americans faced during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. ''Blood on the Forge'' touches on themes such as the destruction of nature, the emptiness and hunger that the working characters experience, the complications of the individual in a depersonalized world, and the myth of the [[American Dream]].\n\n== Background ==\n\nDuring his childhood in the 1910s, author William Attaway traveled with his family from the segregated south of [[Mississippi]] to the northern city of [[Chicago, Illinois]]; in doing so his family became part of what would be known as the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]].<ref>Bader, Philipo.

After their mule dragged their mother to her death, Big Mat killed the animal in a fit of rage. Now without a mule, the brothers are unable to work their land, and are likely to starve. The landowner, Mr. Johnston, agrees to give the brothers another mule.\n\nWhen Big Mat goes to Mr. Johnston's riding boss to collect the mule he had been promised, the riding boss refuses to give him the mule, and makes a racist comment about the departed Mrs. Moss. Big Mat's anger again overcomes him and he attacks and possibly kills the riding boss. Earlier that day, Chinatown and Melody are visited by a white man on horseback who gives them a ten-dollar bill, promising much more if the brothers leave that night on a train that would take them North, to work. When Big Mat returns that evening and Melody and Chinatown tell him what the stranger said, Big Mat decides that he and his brothers will head North that very evening.\n\n;Part Two\nPart Two, the shortest of the novel, chronicles the inhumane conditions of the train in which the Moss brothers are shipped north to [[Pennsylvania]].\n\n;Part Three\nThe Moss brothers arrive at a mill town near Pittsburgh, where they get work in the steel mill and live together in a bunkhouse with the other workers of the mill. On their time off, Chinatown and Melody go to a Mexican madam named Sugar Mama, where they meet her niece Anna, whom Melody becomes infatuated with.\n\nChinatown and Melody convince Big Mat to come with them to a [[dog fighting|dog fight]]. When Anna rushes into the ring to prevent the death of one of the dogs, she is hit by the dog's owner. Big Mat responds by punching the man, which leads to a riot. After the fight breaks up, Anna rushes up to Big Mat and kisses him before running away again.\n\nBig Mat takes Anna away from Sugar Mamma and sets up house with her in a small shack. Melody brings a letter from Big Mat's wife Hattie to the shack only to find Anna there alone. When he tells Anna about the letter she tries to snatch it from him; the two wrestle over the letter. The struggle culminates in Melody raping Anna.\n\nThere is a catastrophic accident at the mill that kills 14 men and blinds Chinatown. After this tragedy, the [[labor union]] becomes very active and gains many new members. The atmosphere of the town becomes increasingly hostile as the foreign mill workers come to resent the African American workers, who are the only group that refuse to join the union.\n\nBig Mat is recruited by the sheriff, who is impressed with Big Mat's strength, to be a deputy and help combat the growing union. Once deputized, Mat is told that he is a boss in the town; after a lifetime of oppression, this new feeling of authority goes to Big Mat's head like fresh whiskey.\n\nMelody decides to cheer Chinatown up after his accident by taking him to visit some [[prostitute]]s. Once at the brothel, Melody finds out that Anna has been working there. Melody returns home and tries to convince Anna to run away with him. When Big Mat overhears them, he once again is overpowered by his rage and beats Anna with his brass-studded belt.\n\nLater that night Big Mat, along with the sheriff and his deputies, raid the union headquarters. In the midst of the action, Big Mat is repeatedly hit on the back of the head with a [[pickaxe handle]] by a young [[Slavs|Slavic]] union member. Big Mat is killed by the blows.\n\nThe book ends with Melody and Chinatown leaving the mill town as they take a train to Pittsburgh, where they plan to rebuild their lives.\n\n==Genre==\n\n=== Proletarian literature ===\n\n''Blood on the Forge'' is an example of [[proletarian literature]], a genre whose works usually represented the years surrounding the [[Great Depression]]. The experience of the characters in the novel mirror the class struggles during the Great Migration, specifically the hardships of African American workers during this period. The Moss brothers are realistically depicted as \"emerging black proletariat.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Foley|first=Barbara|title=Writing Up the Working Class: The Proletarian Novel in the U.S.|url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~bfoley/files/proletariannovel.htm|publisher=S.A.M.A.R. Magazine|accessdate=2011-10-26|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609144915/http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~bfoley/files/proletariannovel.htm|archivedate=June 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Migration narrative ===\n\nAttaway's novel is also a [[migrant literature|migration narrative]], as it traces the journey of African American brothers from Southern farm life to the industrial North. Lawrence R. Rodgers states that there are four kinds of migration narratives, the Early Migration Novel, the Harlem Renaissance, the Fugitive Migration Novel, and finally the Communal Migrant Novel, which is post-Depression.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite journal |journal = African American Review |volume= 34 |issue= 3 |date=Autumn 2000 |title= Review |first=Farah Jasmine |last=Griffin |pages=531\u2013533 |jstor=2901397 |doi=10.2307/2901397}}</ref> ''Blood on the Forge'' would be considered an Early Migration Novel, as it takes place during the early 20th century and because of its industrial subject matter. Rodgers explains that Harlem Renaissance works do not discuss the actual migration, only what came of it, and in her review of Rodgers' ''Canaan Bound: The African-American Great Migration Novel'', Farrah Jasmine Griffin states, \"If the Harlem Renaissance writers failed to make the most of the migration novel form, the generation that followed\u2014fueled by the depression economy, personal deprivation, and a strong sense of displacement\u2014put migration at the center, not the periphery, of its artistic imagination.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In particular, Chicago writers such as Attaway were responding to the failures of Harlem Renaissance writers to express the first wave of African American migration.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nOne important aspect of the migration narrative is its emphasis on the differences between the traditional (or folk) and the modern. Migration narratives typically include references to ancestors and strangers, with ancestors being linked to the South and strangers to the North. In ''Blood on the Forge,'' the immigrants the Moss brothers work with in the mills would be considered strangers.<ref name=\"google1\">Griffin, Farah Jasmine (1995). \n[https://books.google.com/books?id=5bX-oS1XAXUC&pg=PA3&cad=4#v=onepage&q&f=false ''\"Who set you flowin'?\": the African-American migration narrative''], p. 3. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-508896-4}}.</ref> Ancestors are also linked with [[folklore]] and tradition, such as music and food. Melody tries to keep the brother's heritage alive with his guitar. Each brother experiences his own shift from the folk to the industrial that is characteristic of the Great Migration. Melody changes the way he plays the guitar from slicking the chords, as he did at home, to picking them. Chinatown loses his eyes in an accidental explosion in the mills, forcing him to adapt to the industrial world as a [[visual impairment|blind]] man. Big Mat is the last one to leave behind his tradition. While at home he lashed out in anger against his oppressors, such as the riding boss, in the North Big Mat joins the oppressor as he becomes a deputy, using his anger to break his fellow workers' strike. Edward E. Waldron describes him as becoming \"as destructive as the exploding furnace\".<ref name=\"deathofblues\"/>\n\n==Style==\n\n=== Form of the migration narrative ===\nIn her book, ''Who Set You Flowin'?: The African American Migration Narrative'', Farah Jasmine Griffin explains that the migration narrative is a dominant form in [[African American culture]]. Griffin cites Lawrence Rodgers as the first to identify migration with the emergence of a new genre: the Great Migration Novel. This type of work that ''Blood on the Forge'' is associated with has a specific narrative form. In relation to the dominant white society, all migrants are strangers: foreigners driven by persecution to wander in search of a new home. In Attaway's novel, the mill workers all fall under this category. The Moss brothers work with foreign immigrants as well as other Southern migrants like themselves. Within the context of the African American community, the stranger is that figure who possesses no connections to the community. As they migrate to the industrial North, the Moss brothers leave their home and traditions, and start over in a place where they have no connections.<ref name=\"google1\"/>\n\nGriffin describes four moments that occur in migration narratives. Not all migration narratives have all four, and they need not occur in this order. 1) An event that propels action north. In ''Blood on the Forge'', this event is the opportunity for new jobs and a better life. 2) Presentation of the initial confrontation within the urban landscape. The first confrontation the Moss brothers have is when they get off the train and arrive in the city for their new job. As they do this, they meet immigrants and are confronted with the diversity and entirely different atmosphere of the urban landscape. 3) Illustration of attempt to negotiate. The bulk of the novel is the brothers trying to adapt to their new lifestyle. 4) Vision of possibilities or limitations of the North. We see both limitations and possibilities of the North in this novel. At the end as Melody and Chinatown leave for a new opportunity in a new city, there is a sense of possibility for a better situation than the previous one. Limitations of the North can be seen in several instances throughout the story. Chinatown loses his eyes in a fatal explosion in the mills, and Big Mat loses his life trying to gain respect.<ref name=\"google1\"/>\n\n==Characters==\n\n=== Major characters ===\n\n==== Big Mat ====\nBig Mat is the eldest of the three Moss brothers. In Part One of Attaway's novel he is employed as a sharecropper on Mr. Johnston's farm in Kentucky. Of the three brothers Big Mat's most notable attributes are his physical size/strength, his rage, and his constant need to be a provider for his family. After the brothers migrate to Pennsylvania Big Mat focuses his energies on doing well at his new job, and scrupulously saves his money so that he might bring his wife Hattie North. Eventually his resolve breaks and Big Mat enters into a relationship with the prostitute Anna. Mat continues to use his physical strength as a weapon against others until his death during the raid of the Union Headquarters.  According to  Phillip H. Vaughan's article \"From Pastoralism to Industrial Antipathy in William Attaway's ''Blood on the Forge''\" Attaway uses Big Mat's character to represents \"the plodding strength and endurance of all Southern Negroes under their particular color-caste system\".<ref name=\"mythofpastoral\">{{cite journal |title=From Pastoralism to Industrial Antipathy in William Attaway's Blood on the Forge |last=Vaughan |first=Philip H.  |journal=Phylon |volume= 36 |issue= 4 |pages=422\u2013425 |year=1975 |jstor=274641|doi=10.2307/274641 }}</ref>\n\nEdward E.

Chinatown resists sharecropping work, instead enjoying a lazy and carefree lifestyle on the Kentucky farm. Chinatown focuses on his own needs before those of the family, using his money on frivolous items such as a gold tooth. After leaving the farm, Chinatown, succumbing to the temptations offered by city life in Pennsylvania, becomes fascinated with drinking, gambling, and hiring prostitutes. Midway through the novel, Chinatown is left blind after an accident at the steel mill and is forced out of work and into the care of Big Mat and Melody. Phillip H. Vaughan argues that Chinatown's \"lazy, happy-go-lucky attitude reflects in part a psychological response to the subjugated position of the Negroes\" following the abolition of slavery.<ref name=\"mythofpastoral\"/>\n\nEdward E. Waldron claims that Chinatown's main concern in life is to make himself unique, to be noticed as special; his gold tooth provides relief for this concern, and \"looking at the tooth shining back at him from his mirror image gives Chinatown a real sense of being somebody.<ref name=\"deathofblues\"/> \" Stacy I. Morgan claims that the tooth represents Chinatown's \"fragile sense of self-esteem,\" and that he \"fixes on the gold tooth as a way of struggling to affirm his individuality and humanity in the face of a socioeconomic system that would otherwise reduce him to a faceless sharecropper.<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\">{{cite journal  |journal = College English|volume = 63|issue = 6|pages = 712\u2013740|date = July 2001|title=Migration, Material Culture, and Identity in William Attaway's \"Blood on the Forge\" and Harriette Arnow's \"The Dollmaker\" |first=Stacy I. |last=Morgan |jstor=1350099|doi = 10.2307/1350099}}</ref>\n\n==== Melody Moss ====\nMelody, like Chinatown, is a younger half-sibling to  Big Mat. Melody's most prominent characteristic is his love for music, which is expressed through his guitar playing. Once the brothers migrate to Pennsylvania, Melody is forced to work in the steel mills alongside his brothers; this harsh new way of life alienates Melody from his guitar, and he ceases to play. Melody develops feelings for Anna, despite her relationship with Big Mat, and tries to convince her to run away with him. According to Vaughan, Melody's blues singing \"recreates and sustains the pastoral myth... and an existence characterized by images of hunger, barrenness, and drudgery\".<ref name=\"mythofpastoral\"/>\n\n=== Minor characters ===\n\n==== Hattie ====\nHattie is Big Mat's wife. When the Moss Brothers travel North, Hattie is left behind pregnant. Big Mat receives a letter from Hattie saying that she fell and lost the baby.\n\n==== Sugar Mama ====\nSugar Mama is a prostitute from \"Mex Town.\"\n\n==== Anna ====\nAnna is fourteen or fifteen years old and Sugar Mama's niece. Sugar Mama sent for Anna from New Mexico, thinking she would bring more business. At first, Anna tries to sleep with Melody, but when Big Mat defends Anna after an owner at the dog fight hits her, she becomes infatuated with Big Mat. Anna moves into a shack with Big Mat, where she endures his beatings.\n\n==== Smothers ====\nSmothers is a crippled laborer. In an article published in [[Modern Fiction Studies|''MFS Modern Fiction Studies'']], John Claborn claims that Smothers is \"a prophetic spokesman for the earth's pain.\"<ref name=\"claborn\"/> Claborn notes that Smother's legs have been mutilated in a violent steel mill incident, and claims that \"Smothers's shrill prophecies are the product of wisdom gained through suffering, of a heightened sense of what the ground feels as it is mined, smelted, and made into steel.<ref name=\"claborn\"/> \"\n\nAfter Smothers dies in a mill accident, his co-workers memorialize him by turning the steel scraps from the accident into watch fobs, wearing these around their necks for luck.<ref name=\"claborn\"/>\n\n==== Mr. Johnston ====\nThe Moss brothers sharecrop on Mr. Johnson's land in Kentucky. Mr. Johnston had stopped giving the family food credit after Big Mat killed the mule Mr. Johnston had lent them, and claims the Moss family's share of the crop for the next two years to pay for the loss of the animal. However, Mr. Johnston wants to prevent the brothers from leaving to work in the North, so he tells Big Mat that he will give the Moss' a mule so that they can continue to work their land, and offers Melody and Chinatown work doing odd jobs around his farm.\n\n==== Riding Boss ====\nBig Mat identifies the Kentucky riding boss as the son of a poor white sharecropper. When Big Mat goes to get the mule he was promised by Mr. Johnston, the riding boss, eager to exert his power, insults and whips Big Mat. Big Mat loses his temper and attacks the riding boss, prompting the brothers' departure to the north.\n\n==== Bo ====\nBo is the \"boss of stove gang\" who catches Chinatown and Melody staring at the woman with the \"rotted\" breast. Bo points Chinatown and Melody in the right direction of the bunkhouse.\n\n==== Mike ====\nMike is an Italian open-hearth worker who helps the brothers learn the ropes around the mill.\n\n==== O'Casey ====\nO'Casey is the diminutive pit boss in charge of the brothers' group at the mill.\n\n==== Zanski ====\nZanski is an old, Slavic laborer who works with the brothers in the pit and works at the lunch car with his granddaughter, Rosie. He's eventually fired from the mills.\n\n==== Rosie ====\nRosie is Zanski's granddaughter who waitresses at the lunch car. Later in the novel it is revealed that she also works as a prostitute.\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Nature===\nThere is something very timely in Attaway's implicit warning against the industry of the North, as [[Edward Margolies]] suggests in his introduction to the 1969 edition of the novel: possibly he [Attaway] saw his worst fears realized in the rapid spread industrial wastelands and the consequent plight of urban Negroes. From one point of view Attaway's feelings about the sanctity of nature now seem almost quaint in an age of cybernetics.<ref name=\"KP\">{{cite journal|last=Klotman|first=Phyllis|title=An Examination of Whiteness in Blood on the Forge|journal=CLA|year=1972|volume=15|pages=459\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Moss brothers idealize nature, looking back on their homeland of Kentucky with a certain [[pastoral]] fondness.<ref name=\"mythofpastoral\"/> Although the nature of the South is idealized, in both the North and the South nature is dying.<ref name=\"mythofpastoral\"/> In the South, Attaway highlights the overworked land, Big Mat's barren wife Hattie, the family\u2019s extreme hunger, and the drudgery of plowing all day with no reward.<ref name=\"mythofpastoral\"/> Likewise, the urban landscape of the North is also painted as dismal and dying.<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentityp422-425\">{{cite journal |jstor=274641 |title=Migration, Material Culture, and Identity in William Attaway's \"Blood on the Forge\" and Harriette Arnow's \"The Dollmaker\" |journal=Phylon |last=Morgan |first=Stacy I. |date=July 2001 |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=422\u2013425}}</ref>  In the North, Attaway shows the defilement of natural landscape, evident \"in the pollution of the 'dirty-as-a-catfish-hole river with a beautiful name: the [[Monongahela River|Monongahela]],\" as well as the \"'mountains of red ore, yellow limestone, and black coke,' that line the river banks.\"<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/>\n\nAttaway's use of \"mules\" in both the South and North, in different contexts, highlights the Moss brothers' \"unfamiliarity of the artifacts of industrial technology\" as well as the similarities between the two places.\"<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/> \"Mule\" refers both to the animal in the South, and the \"small engines that hauled steel along the river front\" in the Northern mills.\"<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/> The mules, though in the South a part of nature and the pastoral nostalgia felt by the Moss brothers, essentially serve the same function as the mules of the mills; both types of mules perform a mechanized, repetitive task. Stacy I. Morgan argues that Attaway calls attention to the mechanical mules not only to contrast with the animals of sharecropping, but to call attention to the mule's prominence within African American history and folklore.<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/>  Morgan also claims that Attaway \"indirectly evokes America's unfulfilled promises of enfranchisement ('[[40 acres and a mule|forty acres and a mule]]') as well as the long-standing identification of African American men with the mule as a creature that stubbornly endures despite being much abused as a beast of burden.\"<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/>\n\nAttaway exposes the danger of destroying nature through the voice of the mill worker Smothers, who repeatedly warns his fellow workers of the destructive power of the machines. Though the workers seem to see Smothers' prophecies as merely \"half-mad, shrill rants,\" Claborn argues that \"Attaway goes out of his way to invest [Smothers] with a strange dignity and characterize him as a Tiresian speaker of truth.<ref name=\"claborn\"/> \" Smothers sees that destruction of nature \"can lead to can lead to industrial accidents, understood as the land avenging itself against humans.<ref name=\"claborn\"/> \"\n\n===Hunger===\n\nAttaway depicts how African American sharecroppers were forcibly deprived of many of life's necessities.<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/> In Kentucky, the Moss brothers had to use newspapers attached to the wall in order to provide a bit of [[thermal insulation|insulation]], and they are so hungry that they chose to smoke or chew tobacco in an attempt to suppress their appetites.<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/> One way that they deal with this hunger is through music, and the novel opens with Melody playing the \"hungry blues\" on his guitar, which he hopes will distract his family members from their empty stomachs.<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/>\n\nMetaphorically, the Moss brothers are also \"hungry\" for other possessions, those that would not satisfy their physical hunger but rather that part of themselves that desired for a comfortable, leisurely life. This hunger is expressed by the brothers through their \"wishing game,\" where Melody and Chinatown fantasize about their ideal day. When the game is played in the South this idyllic day takes place in the city, where the brothers imagine that they are dressed in fine clothes, gamble all day, and eat and drink their favorite things. Once they migrate to the Northern city, this fantasy day takes place back home in the country.<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/> They experience this emotional, [[existentialism|existential]] hunger in both locations. Stacy I. Morgan argues that they desire things that remain \"ever out of reach,\" which shows that \"the existential dimension of Attaway's hunger metaphor arises precisely out of this perpetually deferred set of desires.\"<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/>\n\n==== North vs South ====\nIn an article published by [[African American Review|''Negro American Literature Forum'']], Edward E. Waldron claims that Attaway depicts an intricate examination of the \"death of the blues\", or the death of folk culture,<ref name=\"deathofblues\"/> with the Moss brothers' move from the South to the North. The changes in Melody and Chinatown reflect the overall changes that southern blacks experienced in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], as they have to leave their folk ways behind in order to survive their new, \"industrially-oriented environment.\"<ref name=\"deathofblues\"/>\n\nStacy I. Morgan also alludes to the ways in which the brothers' mind-set has shifted upon migrating to the North. Their vastly increased income in the North allows them new opportunities and multiple ways to spend their new capital, emphasizing instant gratification \"<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/>\n\nMorgan also notes that the Moss brothers' fear in the train scene, during which their inability to see each other fills each brother with a terrifying sense of isolation, may be Attway's way of highlighting an issue that confronted many who moved during the Great Migration: the \"absence of material links to the family, community, and lifeways of former homes, which w[as] frequently demanded by the circumstances of the migration journey northward\u2014a journey that, for many African Americans, did necessarily commence under cover of night.<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/> \" Morgan asserts that with the absence of these links to their former selves, it was especially difficult for the migrants to retain any former cultural identity in their new homes.<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/>\n\n==== Mechanization ====\nEdward E. Waldron claims that ''Blood on the Forge'' is a story of \"man's changing nature in the face of ever-increasing mechanization.\"<ref name=\"deathofblues\"/>  Stacy I. Morgan states that the physical injuries experienced in the mills are extreme examples of the larger process going on: the \"transforming [of] workers' sense of time and of their own bodies.\"<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/> Phyllis R. Klotman looks at the ways in which the three brothers bodies became tools, a part of machine: \"Chinatown is blinded in an accident which eats up the lives of fourteen men; Melody\u2019s hand is smashed so that he is no longer able to play the guitar; Big Mat is killed during the strike which he has become as unwitting tool the bosses wield against the white workers,\" suggesting that \"the three brothers are systematically unmanned by the dehumanizing process of forging steel.\"\nOne of the tragic outcomes in the novel, according to Klotman, is the loss of continuity in the lives of men who are almost human sacrifices to the industrial Moloch created by an unseen hand grasping for profits.<ref name=\"KP\"/>\n\nBy wearing scraps of the steel that killed Smothers, John Claborn argues that the workers \"give the steel a ritual value that escapes the logic of exchange value; these scraps open up a space for resistance, insofar as they signify the workers' communal bonding.\"<ref name=\"claborn\"/> With this act, Attaway may signify a \"shift in the workers' consciousness,\" as \"the narration itself seems to gain a heightened awareness of the connection between steel and the ground.\"<ref name=\"claborn\"/> In addition, Claborn feels that \"Smothers is ritually sacrificed for the sake of more direct commentary on steel production as a globally interdependent process.\"<ref name=\"claborn\"/> As Attaway wrote, \"The nearness of a farmer to his farm was easily understood. But no man was close to steel. It was shipped across endless tracks to all the world.\"\n\nClaborn claims that Big Mat embodies the link between mechanic and racial violence.<ref name=\"claborn\"/> Once he is deputized, given power by the white law enforcement, and charged to \"suppress the white workers,\" he \"relishes the terror he inspires.\"<ref name=\"claborn\"/> Claborn notes that, \"once the strike begins and the furnaces start to cool down because there are not enough workers to keep them burning, Big Mat single-handedly tries to keep the machines functioning,\" and claims that this \"impossible effort\" shows that \"Big Mat has himself become a machine.\"<ref name=\"claborn\"/> \"Only as he dies [\u2026] does Big Mat glimpse the reality that, in siding with the mill owners and in becoming a machine, he has become an agent of oppression.\"<ref name=\"claborn\"/>\n\n==== Myth of the American Dream and the working class ====\nAttaway's novel depicts how industrial technology dehumanizes working class laborers, alienates workers from the products of their labors, and also highlights how capitalism moved towards mechanized standardization and away from individualized artistry and craftsmanship.<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/>\n\nThe character Anna in particular illustrates another aspect of the American myth, according to Stacy I. Morgan, as Anna dreams of becoming \"like the Americanos.\"<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/> However, Morgan writes, Anna attempts to move up in class by wearing shiny heels and an elaborate gown, and thereby \"misapprehends the complexity of American class identity by reducing it to material cultural signs.\"<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/> Eventually, her dress becomes filthy from being dragged in the mud, and Anna must wear it \"pinned like a diaper between her legs,\" which Morgan claims illustrates how that \"the icon intended as a symbol of maturity and class status\" becomes a symbol of \"Anna's childishness.\"<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/> In addition, Morgan notes that Anna is \"tragically pathetic,\" forbidden by Big Mat to go out in public, the space \"for which such ostentatious apparel is designed.\"<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/>\n\n==Critical reception==\nAttaway's novels were not a major attraction to critics at their time of publication. Although Attaway's novels were received well, they have not been as critically acclaimed as other novels written during the 1940s, including ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (Steinbeck, 1939) and ''[[Native Son]]'' (Wright, 1941) which have both maintained an exceptional reputation for radical novels written during the Great Depression.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Applegate|first=Ed|title=American naturalistic and realistic novelists: a biographical dictionary|journal=Negro American Literature Forum|volume=10|issue=2|pages=58\u201360|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002|year=1976|jstor=3041207}}</ref> Attaway did not continue writing novels after ''Blood on the Forge'', but instead went on to successfully write and produce songs, music and screenplays.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jacobs|first=Nancy|title=Mississippi Writers and Musicians|url=http://www.mswritersandmusicians.com/writers/william-attaway.html|accessdate=2011-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Conder|first=John|title=The City in African American Literature|year=1995|location=books|pages=110\u20131137}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blood on the Forge}}\n[[Category:1941 American novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Pittsburgh]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in the 1920s]]\n[[Category:African-American novels]]\n[[Category:Doubleday, Doran books]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2012}}\n{{Infobox book | <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->\n| name         = Blood on the Forge\n| title_orig   =\n| translator   =\n| image        = bloodontheforgecover.jpg\n| caption      = First edition cover\n| author       = [[William Attaway]]\n| cover_artist =\n| country      = United States\n| language     = English\n| series       =\n| genre        = Novel,  [[Proletarian literature]]\n| publisher    = [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday, Doran]]\n| release_date = 1941\n| media_type   = Print (hardback)\n| pages        = 279\n| isbn         =\n| oclc         = 5284808\n| preceded_by  = Let Me Breathe Thunder\n| followed_by  =\n}}\n\n'''''Blood on the Forge''''' is a migration novel by the African-American writer [[William Attaway]] set in the steel valley of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], during 1919, a time when vast numbers of Black Americans moved northward. Attaway's own family was part of this population shift from South to North when he was a child.\n\nHis novel follows the Moss brothers as they escape the inequality of [[sharecropping]] in the South only to encounter inequality in the [[Steel mill|mills]] of the North. Their story illustrates the tragedy and hardships many Black Americans faced during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. ''Blood on the Forge'' touches on themes such as the destruction of nature, the emptiness and hunger that the working characters experience, the complications of the individual in a depersonalized world, and the myth of the [[American Dream]].\n\n== Background ==\n\nDuring his childhood in the 1910s, author William Attaway traveled with his family from the segregated south of [[Mississippi]] to the northern city of [[Chicago, Illinois]]; in doing so his family became part of what would be known as the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]].<ref>Bader, Philipo.

After their mule dragged their mother to her death, Big Mat killed the animal in a fit of rage. Now without a mule, the brothers are unable to work their land, and are likely to starve. The landowner, Mr. Johnston, agrees to give the brothers another mule.\n\nWhen Big Mat goes to Mr. Johnston's riding boss to collect the mule he had been promised, the riding boss refuses to give him the mule, and makes a racist comment about the departed Mrs. Moss. Big Mat's anger again overcomes him and he attacks and possibly kills the riding boss. Earlier that day, Chinatown and Melody are visited by a white man on horseback who gives them a ten-dollar bill, promising much more if the brothers leave that night on a train that would take them North, to work. When Big Mat returns that evening and Melody and Chinatown tell him what the stranger said, Big Mat decides that he and his brothers will head North that very evening.\n\n;Part Two\nPart Two, the shortest of the novel, chronicles the inhumane conditions of the train in which the Moss brothers are shipped north to [[Pennsylvania]].\n\n;Part Three\nThe Moss brothers arrive at a mill town near Pittsburgh, where they get work in the steel mill and live together in a bunkhouse with the other workers of the mill. On their time off, Chinatown and Melody go to a Mexican madam named Sugar Mama, where they meet her niece Anna, whom Melody becomes infatuated with.\n\nChinatown and Melody convince Big Mat to come with them to a [[dog fighting|dog fight]]. When Anna rushes into the ring to prevent the death of one of the dogs, she is hit by the dog's owner. Big Mat responds by punching the man, which leads to a riot. After the fight breaks up, Anna rushes up to Big Mat and kisses him before running away again.\n\nBig Mat takes Anna away from Sugar Mamma and sets up house with her in a small shack. Melody brings a letter from Big Mat's wife Hattie to the shack only to find Anna there alone. When he tells Anna about the letter she tries to snatch it from him; the two wrestle over the letter. The struggle culminates in Melody raping Anna.\n\nThere is a catastrophic accident at the mill that kills 14 men and blinds Chinatown. After this tragedy, the [[labor union]] becomes very active and gains many new members. The atmosphere of the town becomes increasingly hostile as the foreign mill workers come to resent the African American workers, who are the only group that refuse to join the union.\n\nBig Mat is recruited by the sheriff, who is impressed with Big Mat's strength, to be a deputy and help combat the growing union. Once deputized, Mat is told that he is a boss in the town; after a lifetime of oppression, this new feeling of authority goes to Big Mat's head like fresh whiskey.\n\nMelody decides to cheer Chinatown up after his accident by taking him to visit some [[prostitute]]s. Once at the brothel, Melody finds out that Anna has been working there. Melody returns home and tries to convince Anna to run away with him. When Big Mat overhears them, he once again is overpowered by his rage and beats Anna with his brass-studded belt.\n\nLater that night Big Mat, along with the sheriff and his deputies, raid the union headquarters. In the midst of the action, Big Mat is repeatedly hit on the back of the head with a [[pickaxe handle]] by a young [[Slavs|Slavic]] union member. Big Mat is killed by the blows.\n\nThe book ends with Melody and Chinatown leaving the mill town as they take a train to Pittsburgh, where they plan to rebuild their lives.\n\n==Genre==\n\n=== Proletarian literature ===\n\n''Blood on the Forge'' is an example of [[proletarian literature]], a genre whose works usually represented the years surrounding the [[Great Depression]]. The experience of the characters in the novel mirror the class struggles during the Great Migration, specifically the hardships of African American workers during this period. The Moss brothers are realistically depicted as \"emerging black proletariat.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Foley|first=Barbara|title=Writing Up the Working Class: The Proletarian Novel in the U.S.|url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~bfoley/files/proletariannovel.htm|publisher=S.A.M.A.R.

Lawrence R. Rodgers states that there are four kinds of migration narratives, the Early Migration Novel, the Harlem Renaissance, the Fugitive Migration Novel, and finally the Communal Migrant Novel, which is post-Depression.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite journal |journal = African American Review |volume= 34 |issue= 3 |date=Autumn 2000 |title= Review |first=Farah Jasmine |last=Griffin |pages=531\u2013533 |jstor=2901397 |doi=10.2307/2901397}}</ref> ''Blood on the Forge'' would be considered an Early Migration Novel, as it takes place during the early 20th century and because of its industrial subject matter. Rodgers explains that Harlem Renaissance works do not discuss the actual migration, only what came of it, and in her review of Rodgers' ''Canaan Bound: The African-American Great Migration Novel'', Farrah Jasmine Griffin states, \"If the Harlem Renaissance writers failed to make the most of the migration novel form, the generation that followed\u2014fueled by the depression economy, personal deprivation, and a strong sense of displacement\u2014put migration at the center, not the periphery, of its artistic imagination.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In particular, Chicago writers such as Attaway were responding to the failures of Harlem Renaissance writers to express the first wave of African American migration.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nOne important aspect of the migration narrative is its emphasis on the differences between the traditional (or folk) and the modern. Migration narratives typically include references to ancestors and strangers, with ancestors being linked to the South and strangers to the North. In ''Blood on the Forge,'' the immigrants the Moss brothers work with in the mills would be considered strangers.<ref name=\"google1\">Griffin, Farah Jasmine (1995). \n[https://books.google.com/books?id=5bX-oS1XAXUC&pg=PA3&cad=4#v=onepage&q&f=false ''\"Who set you flowin'?\": the African-American migration narrative''], p. 3. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-508896-4}}.</ref> Ancestors are also linked with [[folklore]] and tradition, such as music and food. Melody tries to keep the brother's heritage alive with his guitar. Each brother experiences his own shift from the folk to the industrial that is characteristic of the Great Migration. Melody changes the way he plays the guitar from slicking the chords, as he did at home, to picking them. Chinatown loses his eyes in an accidental explosion in the mills, forcing him to adapt to the industrial world as a [[visual impairment|blind]] man. Big Mat is the last one to leave behind his tradition. While at home he lashed out in anger against his oppressors, such as the riding boss, in the North Big Mat joins the oppressor as he becomes a deputy, using his anger to break his fellow workers' strike. Edward E. Waldron describes him as becoming \"as destructive as the exploding furnace\".<ref name=\"deathofblues\"/>\n\n==Style==\n\n=== Form of the migration narrative ===\nIn her book, ''Who Set You Flowin'?: The African American Migration Narrative'', Farah Jasmine Griffin explains that the migration narrative is a dominant form in [[African American culture]]. Griffin cites Lawrence Rodgers as the first to identify migration with the emergence of a new genre: the Great Migration Novel. This type of work that ''Blood on the Forge'' is associated with has a specific narrative form. In relation to the dominant white society, all migrants are strangers: foreigners driven by persecution to wander in search of a new home. In Attaway's novel, the mill workers all fall under this category. The Moss brothers work with foreign immigrants as well as other Southern migrants like themselves. Within the context of the African American community, the stranger is that figure who possesses no connections to the community. As they migrate to the industrial North, the Moss brothers leave their home and traditions, and start over in a place where they have no connections.<ref name=\"google1\"/>\n\nGriffin describes four moments that occur in migration narratives. Not all migration narratives have all four, and they need not occur in this order. 1) An event that propels action north. In ''Blood on the Forge'', this event is the opportunity for new jobs and a better life. 2) Presentation of the initial confrontation within the urban landscape. The first confrontation the Moss brothers have is when they get off the train and arrive in the city for their new job. As they do this, they meet immigrants and are confronted with the diversity and entirely different atmosphere of the urban landscape. 3) Illustration of attempt to negotiate. The bulk of the novel is the brothers trying to adapt to their new lifestyle. 4) Vision of possibilities or limitations of the North. We see both limitations and possibilities of the North in this novel. At the end as Melody and Chinatown leave for a new opportunity in a new city, there is a sense of possibility for a better situation than the previous one. Limitations of the North can be seen in several instances throughout the story. Chinatown loses his eyes in a fatal explosion in the mills, and Big Mat loses his life trying to gain respect.<ref name=\"google1\"/>\n\n==Characters==\n\n=== Major characters ===\n\n==== Big Mat ====\nBig Mat is the eldest of the three Moss brothers. In Part One of Attaway's novel he is employed as a sharecropper on Mr. Johnston's farm in Kentucky. Of the three brothers Big Mat's most notable attributes are his physical size/strength, his rage, and his constant need to be a provider for his family. After the brothers migrate to Pennsylvania Big Mat focuses his energies on doing well at his new job, and scrupulously saves his money so that he might bring his wife Hattie North. Eventually his resolve breaks and Big Mat enters into a relationship with the prostitute Anna. Mat continues to use his physical strength as a weapon against others until his death during the raid of the Union Headquarters.  According to  Phillip H. Vaughan's article \"From Pastoralism to Industrial Antipathy in William Attaway's ''Blood on the Forge''\" Attaway uses Big Mat's character to represents \"the plodding strength and endurance of all Southern Negroes under their particular color-caste system\".<ref name=\"mythofpastoral\">{{cite journal |title=From Pastoralism to Industrial Antipathy in William Attaway's Blood on the Forge |last=Vaughan |first=Philip H.  |journal=Phylon |volume= 36 |issue= 4 |pages=422\u2013425 |year=1975 |jstor=274641|doi=10.2307/274641 }}</ref>\n\nEdward E.

Chinatown resists sharecropping work, instead enjoying a lazy and carefree lifestyle on the Kentucky farm. Chinatown focuses on his own needs before those of the family, using his money on frivolous items such as a gold tooth. After leaving the farm, Chinatown, succumbing to the temptations offered by city life in Pennsylvania, becomes fascinated with drinking, gambling, and hiring prostitutes. Midway through the novel, Chinatown is left blind after an accident at the steel mill and is forced out of work and into the care of Big Mat and Melody. Phillip H. Vaughan argues that Chinatown's \"lazy, happy-go-lucky attitude reflects in part a psychological response to the subjugated position of the Negroes\" following the abolition of slavery.<ref name=\"mythofpastoral\"/>\n\nEdward E. Waldron claims that Chinatown's main concern in life is to make himself unique, to be noticed as special; his gold tooth provides relief for this concern, and \"looking at the tooth shining back at him from his mirror image gives Chinatown a real sense of being somebody.<ref name=\"deathofblues\"/> \" Stacy I. Morgan claims that the tooth represents Chinatown's \"fragile sense of self-esteem,\" and that he \"fixes on the gold tooth as a way of struggling to affirm his individuality and humanity in the face of a socioeconomic system that would otherwise reduce him to a faceless sharecropper.<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\">{{cite journal  |journal = College English|volume = 63|issue = 6|pages = 712\u2013740|date = July 2001|title=Migration, Material Culture, and Identity in William Attaway's \"Blood on the Forge\" and Harriette Arnow's \"The Dollmaker\" |first=Stacy I. |last=Morgan |jstor=1350099|doi = 10.2307/1350099}}</ref>\n\n==== Melody Moss ====\nMelody, like Chinatown, is a younger half-sibling to  Big Mat. Melody's most prominent characteristic is his love for music, which is expressed through his guitar playing. Once the brothers migrate to Pennsylvania, Melody is forced to work in the steel mills alongside his brothers; this harsh new way of life alienates Melody from his guitar, and he ceases to play. Melody develops feelings for Anna, despite her relationship with Big Mat, and tries to convince her to run away with him. According to Vaughan, Melody's blues singing \"recreates and sustains the pastoral myth... and an existence characterized by images of hunger, barrenness, and drudgery\".<ref name=\"mythofpastoral\"/>\n\n=== Minor characters ===\n\n==== Hattie ====\nHattie is Big Mat's wife. When the Moss Brothers travel North, Hattie is left behind pregnant. Big Mat receives a letter from Hattie saying that she fell and lost the baby.\n\n==== Sugar Mama ====\nSugar Mama is a prostitute from \"Mex Town.\"\n\n==== Anna ====\nAnna is fourteen or fifteen years old and Sugar Mama's niece. Sugar Mama sent for Anna from New Mexico, thinking she would bring more business. At first, Anna tries to sleep with Melody, but when Big Mat defends Anna after an owner at the dog fight hits her, she becomes infatuated with Big Mat. Anna moves into a shack with Big Mat, where she endures his beatings.\n\n==== Smothers ====\nSmothers is a crippled laborer. In an article published in [[Modern Fiction Studies|''MFS Modern Fiction Studies'']], John Claborn claims that Smothers is \"a prophetic spokesman for the earth's pain.\"<ref name=\"claborn\"/> Claborn notes that Smother's legs have been mutilated in a violent steel mill incident, and claims that \"Smothers's shrill prophecies are the product of wisdom gained through suffering, of a heightened sense of what the ground feels as it is mined, smelted, and made into steel.<ref name=\"claborn\"/> \"\n\nAfter Smothers dies in a mill accident, his co-workers memorialize him by turning the steel scraps from the accident into watch fobs, wearing these around their necks for luck.<ref name=\"claborn\"/>\n\n==== Mr. Johnston ====\nThe Moss brothers sharecrop on Mr. Johnson's land in Kentucky. Mr. Johnston had stopped giving the family food credit after Big Mat killed the mule Mr. Johnston had lent them, and claims the Moss family's share of the crop for the next two years to pay for the loss of the animal. However, Mr. Johnston wants to prevent the brothers from leaving to work in the North, so he tells Big Mat that he will give the Moss' a mule so that they can continue to work their land, and offers Melody and Chinatown work doing odd jobs around his farm.\n\n==== Riding Boss ====\nBig Mat identifies the Kentucky riding boss as the son of a poor white sharecropper. When Big Mat goes to get the mule he was promised by Mr. Johnston, the riding boss, eager to exert his power, insults and whips Big Mat. Big Mat loses his temper and attacks the riding boss, prompting the brothers' departure to the north.\n\n==== Bo ====\nBo is the \"boss of stove gang\" who catches Chinatown and Melody staring at the woman with the \"rotted\" breast. Bo points Chinatown and Melody in the right direction of the bunkhouse.\n\n==== Mike ====\nMike is an Italian open-hearth worker who helps the brothers learn the ropes around the mill.\n\n==== O'Casey ====\nO'Casey is the diminutive pit boss in charge of the brothers' group at the mill.\n\n==== Zanski ====\nZanski is an old, Slavic laborer who works with the brothers in the pit and works at the lunch car with his granddaughter, Rosie. He's eventually fired from the mills.\n\n==== Rosie ====\nRosie is Zanski's granddaughter who waitresses at the lunch car. Later in the novel it is revealed that she also works as a prostitute.\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Nature===\nThere is something very timely in Attaway's implicit warning against the industry of the North, as [[Edward Margolies]] suggests in his introduction to the 1969 edition of the novel: possibly he [Attaway] saw his worst fears realized in the rapid spread industrial wastelands and the consequent plight of urban Negroes. From one point of view Attaway's feelings about the sanctity of nature now seem almost quaint in an age of cybernetics.<ref name=\"KP\">{{cite journal|last=Klotman|first=Phyllis|title=An Examination of Whiteness in Blood on the Forge|journal=CLA|year=1972|volume=15|pages=459\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Moss brothers idealize nature, looking back on their homeland of Kentucky with a certain [[pastoral]] fondness.<ref name=\"mythofpastoral\"/> Although the nature of the South is idealized, in both the North and the South nature is dying.<ref name=\"mythofpastoral\"/> In the South, Attaway highlights the overworked land, Big Mat's barren wife Hattie, the family\u2019s extreme hunger, and the drudgery of plowing all day with no reward.<ref name=\"mythofpastoral\"/> Likewise, the urban landscape of the North is also painted as dismal and dying.<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentityp422-425\">{{cite journal |jstor=274641 |title=Migration, Material Culture, and Identity in William Attaway's \"Blood on the Forge\" and Harriette Arnow's \"The Dollmaker\" |journal=Phylon |last=Morgan |first=Stacy I. |date=July 2001 |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=422\u2013425}}</ref>  In the North, Attaway shows the defilement of natural landscape, evident \"in the pollution of the 'dirty-as-a-catfish-hole river with a beautiful name: the [[Monongahela River|Monongahela]],\" as well as the \"'mountains of red ore, yellow limestone, and black coke,' that line the river banks.\"<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/>\n\nAttaway's use of \"mules\" in both the South and North, in different contexts, highlights the Moss brothers' \"unfamiliarity of the artifacts of industrial technology\" as well as the similarities between the two places.\"<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/> \"Mule\" refers both to the animal in the South, and the \"small engines that hauled steel along the river front\" in the Northern mills.\"<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/> The mules, though in the South a part of nature and the pastoral nostalgia felt by the Moss brothers, essentially serve the same function as the mules of the mills; both types of mules perform a mechanized, repetitive task. Stacy I. Morgan argues that Attaway calls attention to the mechanical mules not only to contrast with the animals of sharecropping, but to call attention to the mule's prominence within African American history and folklore.<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/>  Morgan also claims that Attaway \"indirectly evokes America's unfulfilled promises of enfranchisement ('[[40 acres and a mule|forty acres and a mule]]') as well as the long-standing identification of African American men with the mule as a creature that stubbornly endures despite being much abused as a beast of burden.\"<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/>\n\nAttaway exposes the danger of destroying nature through the voice of the mill worker Smothers, who repeatedly warns his fellow workers of the destructive power of the machines. Though the workers seem to see Smothers' prophecies as merely \"half-mad, shrill rants,\" Claborn argues that \"Attaway goes out of his way to invest [Smothers] with a strange dignity and characterize him as a Tiresian speaker of truth.<ref name=\"claborn\"/> \" Smothers sees that destruction of nature \"can lead to can lead to industrial accidents, understood as the land avenging itself against humans.<ref name=\"claborn\"/> \"\n\n===Hunger===\n\nAttaway depicts how African American sharecroppers were forcibly deprived of many of life's necessities.<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/> In Kentucky, the Moss brothers had to use newspapers attached to the wall in order to provide a bit of [[thermal insulation|insulation]], and they are so hungry that they chose to smoke or chew tobacco in an attempt to suppress their appetites.<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/> One way that they deal with this hunger is through music, and the novel opens with Melody playing the \"hungry blues\" on his guitar, which he hopes will distract his family members from their empty stomachs.<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/>\n\nMetaphorically, the Moss brothers are also \"hungry\" for other possessions, those that would not satisfy their physical hunger but rather that part of themselves that desired for a comfortable, leisurely life. This hunger is expressed by the brothers through their \"wishing game,\" where Melody and Chinatown fantasize about their ideal day. When the game is played in the South this idyllic day takes place in the city, where the brothers imagine that they are dressed in fine clothes, gamble all day, and eat and drink their favorite things. Once they migrate to the Northern city, this fantasy day takes place back home in the country.<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/> They experience this emotional, [[existentialism|existential]] hunger in both locations. Stacy I. Morgan argues that they desire things that remain \"ever out of reach,\" which shows that \"the existential dimension of Attaway's hunger metaphor arises precisely out of this perpetually deferred set of desires.\"<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/>\n\n==== North vs South ====\nIn an article published by [[African American Review|''Negro American Literature Forum'']], Edward E. Waldron claims that Attaway depicts an intricate examination of the \"death of the blues\", or the death of folk culture,<ref name=\"deathofblues\"/> with the Moss brothers' move from the South to the North. The changes in Melody and Chinatown reflect the overall changes that southern blacks experienced in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], as they have to leave their folk ways behind in order to survive their new, \"industrially-oriented environment.\"<ref name=\"deathofblues\"/>\n\nStacy I. Morgan also alludes to the ways in which the brothers' mind-set has shifted upon migrating to the North. Their vastly increased income in the North allows them new opportunities and multiple ways to spend their new capital, emphasizing instant gratification \"<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/>\n\nMorgan also notes that the Moss brothers' fear in the train scene, during which their inability to see each other fills each brother with a terrifying sense of isolation, may be Attway's way of highlighting an issue that confronted many who moved during the Great Migration: the \"absence of material links to the family, community, and lifeways of former homes, which w[as] frequently demanded by the circumstances of the migration journey northward\u2014a journey that, for many African Americans, did necessarily commence under cover of night.<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/> \" Morgan asserts that with the absence of these links to their former selves, it was especially difficult for the migrants to retain any former cultural identity in their new homes.<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/>\n\n==== Mechanization ====\nEdward E. Waldron claims that ''Blood on the Forge'' is a story of \"man's changing nature in the face of ever-increasing mechanization.\"<ref name=\"deathofblues\"/>  Stacy I. Morgan states that the physical injuries experienced in the mills are extreme examples of the larger process going on: the \"transforming [of] workers' sense of time and of their own bodies.\"<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/> Phyllis R. Klotman looks at the ways in which the three brothers bodies became tools, a part of machine: \"Chinatown is blinded in an accident which eats up the lives of fourteen men; Melody\u2019s hand is smashed so that he is no longer able to play the guitar; Big Mat is killed during the strike which he has become as unwitting tool the bosses wield against the white workers,\" suggesting that \"the three brothers are systematically unmanned by the dehumanizing process of forging steel.\"\nOne of the tragic outcomes in the novel, according to Klotman, is the loss of continuity in the lives of men who are almost human sacrifices to the industrial Moloch created by an unseen hand grasping for profits.<ref name=\"KP\"/>\n\nBy wearing scraps of the steel that killed Smothers, John Claborn argues that the workers \"give the steel a ritual value that escapes the logic of exchange value; these scraps open up a space for resistance, insofar as they signify the workers' communal bonding.\"<ref name=\"claborn\"/> With this act, Attaway may signify a \"shift in the workers' consciousness,\" as \"the narration itself seems to gain a heightened awareness of the connection between steel and the ground.\"<ref name=\"claborn\"/> In addition, Claborn feels that \"Smothers is ritually sacrificed for the sake of more direct commentary on steel production as a globally interdependent process.\"<ref name=\"claborn\"/> As Attaway wrote, \"The nearness of a farmer to his farm was easily understood. But no man was close to steel. It was shipped across endless tracks to all the world.\"\n\nClaborn claims that Big Mat embodies the link between mechanic and racial violence.<ref name=\"claborn\"/> Once he is deputized, given power by the white law enforcement, and charged to \"suppress the white workers,\" he \"relishes the terror he inspires.\"<ref name=\"claborn\"/> Claborn notes that, \"once the strike begins and the furnaces start to cool down because there are not enough workers to keep them burning, Big Mat single-handedly tries to keep the machines functioning,\" and claims that this \"impossible effort\" shows that \"Big Mat has himself become a machine.\"<ref name=\"claborn\"/> \"Only as he dies [\u2026] does Big Mat glimpse the reality that, in siding with the mill owners and in becoming a machine, he has become an agent of oppression.\"<ref name=\"claborn\"/>\n\n==== Myth of the American Dream and the working class ====\nAttaway's novel depicts how industrial technology dehumanizes working class laborers, alienates workers from the products of their labors, and also highlights how capitalism moved towards mechanized standardization and away from individualized artistry and craftsmanship.<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/>\n\nThe character Anna in particular illustrates another aspect of the American myth, according to Stacy I. Morgan, as Anna dreams of becoming \"like the Americanos.\"<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/> However, Morgan writes, Anna attempts to move up in class by wearing shiny heels and an elaborate gown, and thereby \"misapprehends the complexity of American class identity by reducing it to material cultural signs.\"<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/> Eventually, her dress becomes filthy from being dragged in the mud, and Anna must wear it \"pinned like a diaper between her legs,\" which Morgan claims illustrates how that \"the icon intended as a symbol of maturity and class status\" becomes a symbol of \"Anna's childishness.\"<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/> In addition, Morgan notes that Anna is \"tragically pathetic,\" forbidden by Big Mat to go out in public, the space \"for which such ostentatious apparel is designed.\"<ref name=\"migrationmaterialcultureidentity\"/>\n\n==Critical reception==\nAttaway's novels were not a major attraction to critics at their time of publication. Although Attaway's novels were received well, they have not been as critically acclaimed as other novels written during the 1940s, including ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (Steinbeck, 1939) and ''[[Native Son]]'' (Wright, 1941) which have both maintained an exceptional reputation for radical novels written during the Great Depression.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Applegate|first=Ed|title=American naturalistic and realistic novelists: a biographical dictionary|journal=Negro American Literature Forum|volume=10|issue=2|pages=58\u201360|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002|year=1976|jstor=3041207}}</ref> Attaway did not continue writing novels after ''Blood on the Forge'', but instead went on to successfully write and produce songs, music and screenplays.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jacobs|first=Nancy|title=Mississippi Writers and Musicians|url=http://www.mswritersandmusicians.com/writers/william-attaway.html|accessdate=2011-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Conder|first=John|title=The City in African American Literature|year=1995|location=books|pages=110\u20131137}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blood on the Forge}}\n[[Category:1941 American novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Pittsburgh]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in the 1920s]]\n[[Category:African-American novels]]\n[[Category:Doubleday, Doran books]]\n", "name_user": "Dawnseeker2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "link maintenance", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_on_the_Forge"}

The victims were five children\u2014Pauline Reade, John Kilbride, Keith Bennett, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans\u2014aged between 10 and 17, at least four of whom were [[Sexual assault|sexually assaulted]].  Two of the victims were discovered in graves dug on [[Saddleworth Moor]]; a third grave was discovered there in 1987, more than twenty years after Brady and Hindley's trial.  Bennett's body is also thought to be buried there, but despite repeated searches it remains undiscovered.\n\nThe pair were charged only in the deaths of Kilbride, Downey and Evans, and received life sentences.  The investigation was reopened in 1985, after Brady was reported as having confessed to the murders of Reade and Bennett.  After confessing to these additional murders, Brady and Hindley were taken separately to Saddleworth Moor to assist in the search for the graves.\n\nCharacterised by the press as \"the most evil woman in Britain\",<ref>{{cite news|title=Hindley: I wish I'd been hanged|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/661139.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|date=29 February 2000 |access-date=11 August 2009}}</ref>  Hindley made several appeals against her life sentence, claiming she was a reformed woman and no longer a danger to society, but was never released.  She died in 2002, aged 60.  Brady was diagnosed as a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]] in 1985 and confined in the high-security [[Ashworth Hospital]].  He made it clear that he never wished to be released, and repeatedly asked to be allowed to die.  He died in 2017, at Ashworth, aged 79.\n\nThe murders were the result of what Malcolm MacCulloch, professor of [[forensic psychiatry]] at [[Cardiff University]], called a \"concatenation of circumstances\".{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=294|ps=none}}  The trial judge, Mr Justice [[Fenton Atkinson]], described Brady and Hindley in his closing remarks as \"two sadistic killers of the utmost depravity\".{{sfnp|Carmichael|2003|p=2|ps=none}} Their crimes were the subject of extensive worldwide media coverage.\n\n==Murders==\n[[File:Yeoman hey and dovestones from hollin brown knoll.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Saddleworth Moor]], viewed from Hollin Brown Knoll.  The bodies of three of the victims were found in this area.|alt=Rolling hills covered in grass]]\n\n===Pauline Reade===\n\nOn 12 July 1963, Brady told Hindley that he wanted to commit a \"perfect murder\".  After work he instructed her to drive a borrowed van around while he followed on his motorcycle; when he spotted a likely victim he would flash his headlight.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=82\u201385|ps=none}}\n\nDriving down Gorton Lane, Brady saw a young girl and signalled Hindley, who did not stop because she recognised the girl as an 8-year-old neighbour of her mother.{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=112|ps=none}}  Sometime after 7:30 pm,{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=43|ps=none}} on Froxmer Street, Brady signalled Hindley to stop for 16-year-old Pauline Reade, a schoolmate of Myra's sister Maureen on her way to a dance; Hindley offered Reade a lift.  At various times Hindley gave conflicting statements about the extent to which she, versus Brady, was responsible for Reade being selected as their first victim,{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=110\u201313|ps=none}} but said she felt that there would be less attention given to the disappearance of a teenager than to a missing 8-year-old.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=83|ps=none}}\n\nOnce Reade was in the van, Hindley asked her help in searching Saddleworth Moor for an expensive lost glove; Reade agreed and they drove there.  When Brady arrived on his motorcycle, Hindley told Reade he would be helping in the search.  Hindley later claimed that she waited in the van while Brady took Reade onto the moor.  Brady returned alone after about 30 minutes, and took Hindley to the spot where Reade lay dying; Reade's clothes were in disarray and she had been nearly decapitated{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=114\u201316|ps=none}} by two cuts to the throat, including a four-inch incision across her voice box \"inflicted with considerable force\" and into which the collar of her coat and a throat chain had been pushed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19880413&id=vThAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=N1kMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4902,3144112|title=Coroner commends police after Moors verdict|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] \u2013 Google News Archive Search|date=13 April 1988|access-date=17 October 2016|mode=cs2}}</ref>  When Hindley asked Brady whether he had raped Reade, Brady replied, \"Of course I did.\"  Hindley stayed with Reade while Brady retrieved a spade he had hidden nearby on a previous visit, then returned to the van while Brady buried Reade.  In Brady's account, Hindley was not only present for the attack, but participated in the sexual assault.{{sfnp|Lee|2010|p=115\u201316|ps=none}}\n\n===John Kilbride===\nIn the early evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], Brady and Hindley offered 12-year-old John Kilbride a lift home, saying his parents might worry that he was out so late; they also promised him a bottle of sherry.  Once Kilbride was inside Hindley's hired [[Ford Anglia]] car, Brady said they would have to make a detour to their home for the sherry.  En route he suggested another detour, this time to search for a glove Hindley had lost on the moor.{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=130\u2013135|ps=none}}  When they reached the moor Brady took Kilbride with him while Hindley waited in the car; Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and tried to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before strangling him with a shoelace or string.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=90\u201392|ps=none}}\n\n===Keith Bennett===\n[[File:Keith bennett.jpg|right|upright=0.55|thumb|alt=Head and shoulders monochrome photograph of a smiling short-haired young boy wearing spectacles.|Keith Bennett]]\n\nEarly in the evening of 16 June 1964, Hindley asked twelve-year-old Keith Bennett, who was on his way to his grandmother's house in [[Longsight]], Manchester,{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=144\u2013146|ps=none}} for help in loading some boxes into her [[Mini#Variants|Mini Pick-up]], after which she said she would drive him home.  Brady was in the back of the van.  She drove to a [[rest area#United Kingdom|lay-by]] on Saddleworth Moor and Brady went off with Bennett, supposedly looking for a lost glove.  After about 30&nbsp;minutes Brady returned alone, carrying a spade that he had hidden there earlier, and, in response to Hindley's questions, said that he had sexually assaulted Bennett and strangled him with a piece of string.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=95\u201396|ps=none}}\n\n===Lesley Ann Downey===\nBrady and Hindley visited a fairground on 26 December 1964 and noticed that 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey was apparently alone.  They approached her and deliberately dropped some shopping they were carrying, then asked her help in taking the packages to their car, and then to their home.  At the house Downey was undressed, gagged, and forced to pose for photographs before being raped and killed, perhaps strangled with a piece of string.  Hindley later maintained that she went to fill a bath for Downey and found her dead when she returned; Brady claimed that Hindley killed Downey.  The following morning Brady and Hindley drove Downey's body to Saddleworth Moor,{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=106|ps=none}} and buried her{{mdashb}}naked with her clothes at her feet{{mdashb}}in a shallow grave.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=34|ps=none}}\n\n===Edward Evans===\n[[File:16 wardle brook avenue.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A roadside view of several 20th-century British houses.

After a few minutes Brady reappeared in the company of 17-year-old Edward Evans, an apprentice engineer who lived in [[Ardwick]], to whom he introduced Hindley as his sister.  They drove to Brady and Hindley's home at 16 Wardle Brook Avenue, [[Hattersley]], [[Cheshire]], where they relaxed over a bottle of wine.\n\nAt some point Brady sent Hindley to fetch David Smith, the husband of Hindley's younger sister Maureen.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=184\u2013186|ps=none}} The Hindley family had not approved of Maureen's marriage to Smith, who had several criminal convictions, including [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm|actual bodily harm]] and housebreaking, the first of which, wounding with intent, occurred when he was 11.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=22|ps=none}}  Throughout the previous year Brady had been cultivating a friendship with Smith, who had become \"in awe\" of Brady, something that increasingly worried Hindley, as she felt it compromised their safety.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=183\u2013184|ps=none}}\n\nHindley returned with Smith and told him to wait outside for her signal, a flashing light.  When the signal came, Smith knocked on the door and was met by Brady, who asked if he had come for \"the miniature wine bottles\",{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=184\u2013186|ps=none}} and left him in the kitchen saying that he was going to collect the wine.  Smith later told the police:\n\n{{Quote| I waited about a minute or two then suddenly I heard a hell of a scream; it sounded like a woman, really high-pitched.

When she denied that she had a husband or that a man was in the house, Talbot identified himself. Hindley led him into the living room, where Brady was lying on a divan, writing to his employer about his ankle injury.{{sfnp|Benfield|1968|p=151}} Talbot explained that he was investigating \"an act of violence involving guns\" that was reported to have taken place the previous evening.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=120\u2013121|ps=none}}\n\nHindley denied there had been any violence, and allowed police to look around the house.

In the letter, Johnson was sympathetic to Hindley over the criticism surrounding her first visit. Hindley, who had not replied to the first letter, responded by thanking Johnson for both letters, explaining that her decision not to reply to the first resulted from the negative publicity that surrounded it. She claimed that, had Johnson written to her 14&nbsp;years earlier, she would have confessed and helped the police. She also paid tribute to Topping, and thanked Johnson for her sincerity.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=268\u2013269|ps=none}}  Hindley made her second visit to the moor in March 1987.

Amidst strong media interest [[Lord Longford]] pleaded for her release, writing that continuing her detention to satisfy \"mob emotion\" was not right. Fisher persuaded Hindley to release a public statement, which touched on her reasons for denying her guilt previously, her religious experiences in prison, and the letter from Johnson.

Stewart had little support, and after a few months was forced to give her son into the care of Mary and John Sloan, a local couple with four children of their own. Brady took their name, and became known as Ian Sloan. His mother continued to visit him throughout his childhood.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=17\u201319|ps=none}}  Various authors have stated that he [[zoosadism|tortured animals]], although Brady objected to such accusations.{{sfnp|Cowley|2011|p=28|ps=none}}  Aged nine, he visited [[Loch Lomond]] with his family, where he reportedly discovered an affinity for the outdoors, and a few months later the family moved to a new [[council house]] on an [[overspill estate]] at [[Pollok]].  He was accepted for [[Shawlands Academy]], a school for above-average pupils.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=19\u201320|ps=none}}\n\nAt Shawlands his behaviour worsened; as a teenager he twice appeared before a juvenile court for housebreaking. He left the academy aged 15, and took a job as a tea boy at a [[Harland and Wolff]] shipyard in [[Govan]]. Nine months later, he began working as a butcher's messenger boy. He had a girlfriend, Evelyn Grant, but their relationship ended when he threatened her with a [[flick knife]] after she visited a dance with another boy. He again appeared before the court, this time with nine charges against him,{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=20\u201321|ps=none}} and shortly before his 17th birthday he was placed on probation, on condition that he live with his mother.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=24|ps=none}} By then, she had moved to Manchester and married an Irish fruit merchant named Patrick Brady; Patrick Brady got Ian a job as a fruit porter at Smithfield Market, and Ian took Patrick Brady's surname.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=122|ps=none}}\n\nWithin a year of moving to Manchester, Brady was caught with a sack full of lead seals he had stolen and was trying to smuggle out of the market.

He was regarded by his colleagues as a quiet, punctual, but short-tempered young man. He read books including ''Teach Yourself German'' and ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', as well as works on [[Nazi]] atrocities.

Her parents, Nellie and Bob Hindley (the latter an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]]), beat her regularly when she was a young child.  The family house was in a poor condition and Hindley was forced to sleep in a single bed next to her parents' double.  Their living situation deteriorated further when Hindley's sister, Maureen, was born in August 1946, and about a year later Hindley, then 5, was sent to live with a grandmother nearby.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=39\u201346|ps=none}}\n\nHindley's father had served with the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] and had been stationed in North Africa, Cyprus and Italy during the [[Second World War]].{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=38|ps=none}}  He had been known in the army as a \"hard man\" and he expected his daughter to be equally tough; he taught her to fight and insisted that she \"stick up for herself\".  When Hindley was 8, a local boy scratched her cheeks, drawing blood.  She burst into tears and ran to her father, who threatened to \"leather\" her if she did not retaliate; Hindley found the boy and knocked him down with a series of punches.  As she wrote later, \"at eight years old I'd scored my first victory\".{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=49\u201350|ps=none}}\nMalcolm MacCulloch, professor of [[forensic psychiatry]] at [[Cardiff University]], has written that Hindley's \"<!--The -->relationship with her father brutalised her&nbsp;...

In 1957, he invited her to go swimming with friends at a local disused reservoir, but Hindley instead went out with another friend; Higgins drowned in the reservoir. Hindley{{mdashb}}a good swimmer{{mdashb}}was deeply upset and blamed herself. She collected for a wreath, and his funeral at [[Gorton Monastery|St Francis's Monastery]] in Gorton Lane\u2014where Hindley had been baptised a Catholic in 1942\u2014had a lasting effect on her.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=7|ps=none}} Hindley's mother had agreed to her father's insistence that Hindley be [[Baptism|baptised]] a Catholic, but only on the condition that she not be sent to a Catholic school; her mother believed that \"all the monks taught was [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|the catechism]]\".{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=36|ps=none}} Hindley was increasingly drawn to the Catholic Church after she started at Ryder Brow Secondary Modern, and began taking instruction for formal reception into the Church soon after Higgins's funeral. She took the [[confirmation]] name of Veronica<!--Staff page 80 gives the name Therese-->, and received her first [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|communion]] in November 1958.\n\nHindley's first job was as a junior clerk at a local electrical engineering firm.

Hindley befriended George Clitheroe, the President of the Cheadle Rifle Club, and on several occasions visited two local shooting ranges. Clitheroe, although puzzled by her interest, arranged for her to buy a .22 rifle from a gun merchant in Manchester. She also asked to join a pistol club, but she was a poor shot and allegedly often bad-tempered, so Clitheroe told her that she was unsuitable; she did though manage to purchase a [[Webley & Scott|Webley]] .45 and a [[Smith & Wesson]] .38 from other members of the club.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=37\u201340|ps=none}} Brady and Hindley's plans for robbery came to nothing, but they became interested in photography. Brady already owned a [[Brownie (camera)|Box Brownie]], which he used to take photographs of Hindley and her dog, Puppet, but he upgraded to a more sophisticated model, and also purchased lights and [[darkroom]] equipment. The pair took photographs of each other that, for the time, would have been considered explicit.

Police found no one who had seen Reade before her disappearance, and although the 15-year-old Smith was questioned by police, he was cleared of any involvement in her death.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=41\u201345|ps=none}}  Their next victim, Kilbride, was killed on 23 November 1963.

The two talked about society, the distribution of wealth, and the possibility of robbing a bank.  The young Smith was similarly impressed by Brady, who throughout the day had paid for his food and wine.  The trip to the Lake District was the first of many outings.

The victims were five children\u2014Pauline Reade, John Kilbride, Keith Bennett, Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans\u2014aged between 10 and 17, at least four of whom were [[Sexual assault|sexually assaulted]].  Two of the victims were discovered in graves dug on [[Saddleworth Moor]]; a third grave was discovered there in 1987, more than twenty years after Brady and Hindley's trial.  Bennett's body is also thought to be buried there, but despite repeated searches it remains undiscovered.\n\nThe pair were charged only in the deaths of Kilbride, Downey and Evans, and received life sentences.  The investigation was reopened in 1985, after Brady was reported as having confessed to the murders of Reade and Bennett.  After confessing to these additional murders, Brady and Hindley were taken separately to Saddleworth Moor to assist in the search for the graves.\n\nCharacterised by the press as \"the most evil woman in Britain\",<ref>{{cite news|title=Hindley: I wish I'd been hanged|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/661139.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|date=29 February 2000 |access-date=11 August 2009}}</ref>  Hindley made several appeals against her life sentence, claiming she was a reformed woman and no longer a danger to society, but was never released.  She died in 2002, aged 60.  Brady was diagnosed as a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]] in 1985 and confined in the high-security [[Ashworth Hospital]].  He made it clear that he never wished to be released, and repeatedly asked to be allowed to die.  He died in 2017, at Ashworth, aged 79.\n\nThe murders were the result of what Malcolm MacCulloch, professor of [[forensic psychiatry]] at [[Cardiff University]], called a \"concatenation of circumstances\".{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=294|ps=none}}  The trial judge, Mr Justice [[Fenton Atkinson]], described Brady and Hindley in his closing remarks as \"two sadistic killers of the utmost depravity\".{{sfnp|Carmichael|2003|p=2|ps=none}} Their crimes were the subject of extensive worldwide media coverage.\n\n==Murders==\n[[File:Yeoman hey and dovestones from hollin brown knoll.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Saddleworth Moor]], viewed from Hollin Brown Knoll.  The bodies of three of the victims were found in this area.|alt=Rolling hills covered in grass]]\n\n===Pauline Reade===\n\nOn 12 July 1963, Brady told Hindley that he wanted to commit a \"perfect murder\".  After work he instructed her to drive a borrowed van around while he followed on his motorcycle; when he spotted a likely victim he would flash his headlight.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=82\u201385|ps=none}}\n\nDriving down Gorton Lane, Brady saw a young girl and signalled Hindley, who did not stop because she recognised the girl as an 8-year-old neighbour of her mother.{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=112|ps=none}}  Sometime after 7:30 pm,{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=43|ps=none}} on Froxmer Street, Brady signalled Hindley to stop for 16-year-old Pauline Reade, a schoolmate of Myra's sister Maureen on her way to a dance; Hindley offered Reade a lift.  At various times Hindley gave conflicting statements about the extent to which she, versus Brady, was responsible for Reade being selected as their first victim,{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=110\u201313|ps=none}} but said she felt that there would be less attention given to the disappearance of a teenager than to a missing 8-year-old.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=83|ps=none}}\n\nOnce Reade was in the van, Hindley asked her help in searching Saddleworth Moor for an expensive lost glove; Reade agreed and they drove there.  When Brady arrived on his motorcycle, Hindley told Reade he would be helping in the search.  Hindley later claimed that she waited in the van while Brady took Reade onto the moor.  Brady returned alone after about 30 minutes, and took Hindley to the spot where Reade lay dying; Reade's clothes were in disarray and she had been nearly decapitated{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=114\u201316|ps=none}} by two cuts to the throat, including a four-inch incision across her voice box \"inflicted with considerable force\" and into which the collar of her coat and a throat chain had been pushed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19880413&id=vThAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=N1kMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4902,3144112|title=Coroner commends police after Moors verdict|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] \u2013 Google News Archive Search|date=13 April 1988|access-date=17 October 2016|mode=cs2}}</ref>  When Hindley asked Brady whether he had raped Reade, Brady replied, \"Of course I did.\"  Hindley stayed with Reade while Brady retrieved a spade he had hidden nearby on a previous visit, then returned to the van while Brady buried Reade.  In Brady's account, Hindley was not only present for the attack, but participated in the sexual assault.{{sfnp|Lee|2010|p=115\u201316|ps=none}}\n\n===John Kilbride===\nIn the early evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], Brady and Hindley offered 12-year-old John Kilbride a lift home, saying his parents might worry that he was out so late; they also promised him a bottle of sherry.  Once Kilbride was inside Hindley's hired [[Ford Anglia]] car, Brady said they would have to make a detour to their home for the sherry.  En route he suggested another detour, this time to search for a glove Hindley had lost on the moor.{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=130\u2013135|ps=none}}  When they reached the moor Brady took Kilbride with him while Hindley waited in the car; Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and tried to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before strangling him with a shoelace or string.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=90\u201392|ps=none}}\n\n===Keith Bennett===\n[[File:Keith bennett.jpg|right|upright=0.55|thumb|alt=Head and shoulders monochrome photograph of a smiling short-haired young boy wearing spectacles.|Keith Bennett]]\n\nEarly in the evening of 16 June 1964, Hindley asked twelve-year-old Keith Bennett, who was on his way to his grandmother's house in [[Longsight]], Manchester,{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=144\u2013146|ps=none}} for help in loading some boxes into her [[Mini#Variants|Mini Pick-up]], after which she said she would drive him home.  Brady was in the back of the van.  She drove to a [[rest area#United Kingdom|lay-by]] on Saddleworth Moor and Brady went off with Bennett, supposedly looking for a lost glove.  After about 30&nbsp;minutes Brady returned alone, carrying a spade that he had hidden there earlier, and, in response to Hindley's questions, said that he had sexually assaulted Bennett and strangled him with a piece of string.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=95\u201396|ps=none}}\n\n===Lesley Ann Downey===\nBrady and Hindley visited a fairground on 26 December 1964 and noticed that 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey was apparently alone.  They approached her and deliberately dropped some shopping they were carrying, then asked her help in taking the packages to their car, and then to their home.  At the house Downey was undressed, gagged, and forced to pose for photographs before being raped and killed, perhaps strangled with a piece of string.  Hindley later maintained that she went to fill a bath for Downey and found her dead when she returned; Brady claimed that Hindley killed Downey.  The following morning Brady and Hindley drove Downey's body to Saddleworth Moor,{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=106|ps=none}} and buried her{{mdashb}}naked with her clothes at her feet{{mdashb}}in a shallow grave.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=34|ps=none}}\n\n===Edward Evans===\n[[File:16 wardle brook avenue.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A roadside view of several 20th-century British houses.

Manchester City Council decided in 1987 to demolish the house.]]\n\nOn the evening of 6 October 1965, Hindley drove Brady to [[Manchester Central railway station]], where she waited outside in the car whilst he selected a victim.  After a few minutes Brady reappeared in the company of 17-year-old Edward Evans, an apprentice engineer who lived in [[Ardwick]], to whom he introduced Hindley as his sister.  They drove to Brady and Hindley's home at 16 Wardle Brook Avenue, [[Hattersley]], [[Cheshire]], where they relaxed over a bottle of wine.\n\nAt some point Brady sent Hindley to fetch David Smith, the husband of Hindley's younger sister Maureen.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=184\u2013186|ps=none}} The Hindley family had not approved of Maureen's marriage to Smith, who had several criminal convictions, including [[Assault occasioning actual bodily harm|actual bodily harm]] and housebreaking, the first of which, wounding with intent, occurred when he was 11.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=22|ps=none}}  Throughout the previous year Brady had been cultivating a friendship with Smith, who had become \"in awe\" of Brady, something that increasingly worried Hindley, as she felt it compromised their safety.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=183\u2013184|ps=none}}\n\nHindley returned with Smith and told him to wait outside for her signal, a flashing light.  When the signal came, Smith knocked on the door and was met by Brady, who asked if he had come for \"the miniature wine bottles\",{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=184\u2013186|ps=none}} and left him in the kitchen saying that he was going to collect the wine.  Smith later told the police:\n\n{{Quote| I waited about a minute or two then suddenly I heard a hell of a scream; it sounded like a woman, really high-pitched.  Then the screams carried on, one after another really loud.  Then I heard Myra shout, \"Dave, help him,\" very loud.  When I ran in I just stood inside the living room and I saw a young lad.  He was lying with his head and shoulders on the couch and his legs were on the floor.  He was facing upwards.  Ian was standing over him, facing him, with his legs on either side of the young lad's legs.  The lad was still screaming&nbsp;... Ian had a hatchet in his hand&nbsp;... he was holding it above his head and he hit the lad on the left side of his head with the hatchet. I heard the blow, it was a terrible hard blow, it sounded horrible.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=78|ps=none}}}}\n\nSmith then watched Brady throttle Evans with a length of electrical cord.{{sfnp|Williams|1992|p=266|ps=none}}  Brady sprained his ankle in the struggle, and Evans's body was too heavy for Smith to carry to the car on his own, so they wrapped it in plastic sheeting and put it in the spare bedroom.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=186|ps=none}}\n\n==Arrest==\nSmith agreed to return the following morning with his baby\u2019s [[baby transport|pram]], for use in transporting Evans\u2019s body to the car before disposing of it on the moors. He arrived home around 3{{nbsp}}am and asked his wife to make a cup of tea, which he drank before vomiting and telling her what he had witnessed. At 6:10{{nbsp}}am, having waited for daylight and armed himself with a screwdriver and bread knife{{snd}}in case Brady was planning to intercept him{{snd}}Smith called police from a [[phone booth]] on the estate. He was picked up by a police car from the booth and taken to Hyde police station, where he told officers what he had witnessed in the night.{{sfnp|Benfield|1968|pp=150\u20131|ps=none}}\n\nSuperintendent Bob Talbot of the [[Stalybridge]] police division went to 16&nbsp;Wardle Brook Avenue, accompanied by a detective sergeant. Wearing a bread deliveryman's overall on top of his uniform, he asked Myra Hindley at the back door if her husband was home. When she denied that she had a husband or that a man was in the house, Talbot identified himself. Hindley led him into the living room, where Brady was lying on a divan, writing to his employer about his ankle injury.{{sfnp|Benfield|1968|p=151}} Talbot explained that he was investigating \"an act of violence involving guns\" that was reported to have taken place the previous evening.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=120\u2013121|ps=none}}\n\nHindley denied there had been any violence, and allowed police to look around the house.  When police asked for the key to the locked spare bedroom, Hindley said it was at her workplace; but after police offered to take her to retrieve it, Brady told her to hand it over.  When police returned to the living room they arrested Brady on suspicion of murder.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=120\u2013121|ps=none}}  As Brady was getting dressed, he said \"Eddie and I had a row and the situation got out of hand.\"{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=85|ps=none}}\n\n==Initial investigation==\nThough Hindley was not initially arrested, she demanded to go with Brady to the police station, taking her dog.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=193\u2013194|ps=none}}  She refused to make any statement about Evans's death beyond claiming it had been an accident, and was allowed to go home on the condition that she return the next day.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=122\u2013124|ps=none}} Over the next four days Hindley visited her employer and asked to be dismissed so that she would be eligible for [[unemployment benefits]].  On one of these occasions, Hindley found an envelope belonging to Brady which she burned in an ashtray; she claimed she did not open it but believed it contained plans for bank robberies. On 11 October, she too was arrested and taken into custody, being charged as an [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]] to the murder of Edward Evans and was remanded at [[Risley (HM Prison)|Risley]].{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=122\u2013124|ps=none}}\n\nPolice searching the house at Wardle Brook Avenue found an old exercise book with the name \"John Kilbride\", which made them suspect that Brady and Hindley had been involved in the disappearances of other youngsters.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=33|ps=none}} Brady told police that he and Evans had fought, but insisted that he and Smith had murdered Evans and that Hindley had \"only done what she had been told\".{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=122|ps=none}} Smith said that Brady had asked him to return anything incriminating, such as \"dodgy books\", which Brady then packed into suitcases; he had no idea what else the suitcases contained or where they might be, though he mentioned that Brady \"had a thing about railway stations\". A search of left-luggage offices turned up the suitcases at [[Manchester Central railway station]] on 15 October;{{sfnp|Lee|2010|pp=234\u2013235|ps=none}} the claim ticket was later found in Hindley's prayer book.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=107|ps=none}}\n\nInside one of the cases were\u2014among an assortment of costumes, notes, photographs and negatives\u2014nine pornographic photographs taken of Lesley Ann Downey, naked and with a scarf tied across her mouth, and a 16-minute audiotape recording of a girl screaming and pleading for help.{{sfnp|Goodman|1973|p=28|ps=none}}{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=35|ps=none}} Downey's mother later confirmed that the recording, too, was of her daughter.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|pp=35\u201336|ps=none}}\n\nOfficers making inquiries at neighbouring houses spoke to 12-year-old Pat Hodges, who had on several occasions been taken to [[Saddleworth Moor]] by Brady and Hindley, and was able to point out their favourite sites along the [[A635 road]].{{sfnp|Goodman|1973|p=27|ps=none}} Police immediately began to search the area, and on 16 October found an arm bone protruding from the peat, which was presumed at first to be Kilbride's, but which the next day was identified as that of Lesley Ann Downey, whose body was still visually identifiable; her mother was able to identify the clothing which had also been buried in the grave.<ref name=\"Times ears covered\">{{cite news |title=Two women at 'bodies on moors' trial cover their ears |newspaper=[[The Times]] |url=https://gdc.gale.com/gdc/artemis/NewspapersDetailsPage/NewspapersDetailsWindow?documentId=GALE%7CCS151743131 |publisher=Times Digital Archive |date=27 April 1966 |page=9 |issue=56616 |access-date=12 September 2019 |mode=cs2 |url-access=subscription |mode=cs2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Myra at John Kilbride's grave.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|alt=A crouched blonde woman in thick jacket, trousers, and boots, holding a small dog.|In this photograph taken by Brady in November 1963, Hindley crouches over John Kilbride's grave on Saddleworth Moor with her dog, Puppet.]]\n\nAlso among the photographs in the suitcase were a number of scenes of the moors. Smith had told police that Brady had boasted of \"photographic proof\" of multiple murders, and officers, struck by Brady's decision to remove the apparently innocent landscapes from the house, appealed to locals for assistance finding locations to match the photographs. On 21 October they found the \"badly decomposed\" body of Kilbride, which had to be identified by clothing.{{sfnp|Goodman|1973|p=28-29|ps=none}} That same day, already being held for the murder of Evans, Brady and Hindley appeared at Hyde Magistrates' Court charged with Downey's murder.

He read books including ''Teach Yourself German'' and ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', as well as works on [[Nazi]] atrocities.

Her parents, Nellie and Bob Hindley (the latter an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]]), beat her regularly when she was a young child.  The family house was in a poor condition and Hindley was forced to sleep in a single bed next to her parents' double.  Their living situation deteriorated further when Hindley's sister, Maureen, was born in August 1946, and about a year later Hindley, then 5, was sent to live with a grandmother nearby.{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=39\u201346|ps=none}}\n\nHindley's father had served with the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] and had been stationed in North Africa, Cyprus and Italy during the [[Second World War]].{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=38|ps=none}}  He had been known in the army as a \"hard man\" and he expected his daughter to be equally tough; he taught her to fight and insisted that she \"stick up for herself\".  When Hindley was 8, a local boy scratched her cheeks, drawing blood.  She burst into tears and ran to her father, who threatened to \"leather\" her if she did not retaliate; Hindley found the boy and knocked him down with a series of punches.  As she wrote later, \"at eight years old I'd scored my first victory\".{{sfnp|Staff|2007|pp=49\u201350|ps=none}}\nMalcolm MacCulloch, professor of [[forensic psychiatry]] at [[Cardiff University]], has written that Hindley's \"<!--The -->relationship with her father brutalised her&nbsp;...

In 1957, he invited her to go swimming with friends at a local disused reservoir, but Hindley instead went out with another friend; Higgins drowned in the reservoir. Hindley{{mdashb}}a good swimmer{{mdashb}}was deeply upset and blamed herself. She collected for a wreath, and his funeral at [[Gorton Monastery|St Francis's Monastery]] in Gorton Lane\u2014where Hindley had been baptised a Catholic in 1942\u2014had a lasting effect on her.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=7|ps=none}} Hindley's mother had agreed to her father's insistence that Hindley be [[Baptism|baptised]] a Catholic, but only on the condition that she not be sent to a Catholic school; her mother believed that \"all the monks taught was [[Catechism of the Catholic Church|the catechism]]\".{{sfnp|Staff|2007|p=36|ps=none}} Hindley was increasingly drawn to the Catholic Church after she started at Ryder Brow Secondary Modern, and began taking instruction for formal reception into the Church soon after Higgins's funeral. She took the [[confirmation]] name of Veronica<!--Staff page 80 gives the name Therese-->, and received her first [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|communion]] in November 1958.\n\nHindley's first job was as a junior clerk at a local electrical engineering firm.

Hindley befriended George Clitheroe, the President of the Cheadle Rifle Club, and on several occasions visited two local shooting ranges. Clitheroe, although puzzled by her interest, arranged for her to buy a .22 rifle from a gun merchant in Manchester. She also asked to join a pistol club, but she was a poor shot and allegedly often bad-tempered, so Clitheroe told her that she was unsuitable; she did though manage to purchase a [[Webley & Scott|Webley]] .45 and a [[Smith & Wesson]] .38 from other members of the club.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=37\u201340|ps=none}} Brady and Hindley's plans for robbery came to nothing, but they became interested in photography. Brady already owned a [[Brownie (camera)|Box Brownie]], which he used to take photographs of Hindley and her dog, Puppet, but he upgraded to a more sophisticated model, and also purchased lights and [[darkroom]] equipment. The pair took photographs of each other that, for the time, would have been considered explicit.

The story tells a fictionalised account of the [[Leopold and Loeb]] case, two young men from well-to-do families who attempt to commit the perfect murder of a 12-year-old boy, and escape the [[death penalty]] because of their age.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=80|ps=none}}\n\nBy June 1963, Brady had moved in with Hindley at her grandmother's house in Bannock Street, and on 12 July 1963, the two murdered their first victim, Reade, who had attended school with Hindley's younger sister, Maureen, and had also been in a short relationship with David Smith, a local boy with three criminal convictions for minor crimes.  Police found no one who had seen Reade before her disappearance, and although the 15-year-old Smith was questioned by police, he was cleared of any involvement in her death.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=41\u201345|ps=none}}  Their next victim, Kilbride, was killed on 23 November 1963.  A huge search was undertaken, with over 700&nbsp;statements taken, and 500&nbsp;\"missing\" posters printed.  Eight days after he failed to return home, 2,000&nbsp;volunteers scoured waste ground and derelict buildings.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=46\u201347|ps=none}}\n\nHindley hired a vehicle a week after Kilbride went missing, and again on 21 December 1963, apparently to make sure the burial sites had not been disturbed.  In February 1964, she bought a second-hand [[Austin Motor Company|Austin Traveller]], but soon after traded it for a [[Mini]] van.  Bennett disappeared on 16 June 1964.  His stepfather, Jimmy Johnson, became a suspect; in the two years following Bennett's disappearance, Johnson was taken for questioning on four occasions.  Detectives searched under the floorboards of the Johnsons' house, and on discovering that the houses in the row were connected, extended the search to the entire street.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=50\u201355|ps=none}}\n\n[[File:David and maureen smith nee hindley.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A young man and woman, in 1960s fashion, stand for a monochrome photograph.

The newlyweds moved into Smith's father's house.  The next day, Brady suggested that the four take a day-trip to [[Windermere]].  This was the first time Brady and Smith had met properly, and Brady was apparently impressed by Smith's demeanour.  The two talked about society, the distribution of wealth, and the possibility of robbing a bank.  The young Smith was similarly impressed by Brady, who throughout the day had paid for his food and wine.  The trip to the Lake District was the first of many outings.  Hindley was apparently jealous of their relationship, but became closer to her sister.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=56\u201358|ps=none}}\n\nIn 1964, Hindley, her grandmother, and Brady were rehoused as part of the post-war slum clearances in Manchester, to 16&nbsp;Wardle Brook Avenue in the new overspill estate of Hattersley.  Brady and Hindley became friendly with Patricia Hodges, an 11-year-old girl who lived at 12&nbsp;Wardle Brook Avenue.  Hodges accompanied the two on their trips to [[Saddleworth Moor]] to collect [[peat]], something that many householders on the new estate did to improve the soil in their gardens, which were full of clay and builder's rubble.{{sfnp|Topping|1989|p=137|ps=none}}  She remained unharmed; living only a few doors away, her disappearance would have been easily solved.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|pp=62\u201365|ps=none}}\n\nEarly on [[Boxing Day]] 1964, Hindley left her grandmother at a relative's house and refused to allow her back to Wardle Brook Avenue that night.{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=65|ps=none}}  On the same day, Downey disappeared from a [[funfair]] in [[Ancoats]].{{sfnp|Ritchie|1988|p=67|ps=none}}  Despite a huge search, she was not found.
