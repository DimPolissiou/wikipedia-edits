It was intended to be a romantic allegorical account of Maximilian's own participation in a series of [[Tournament (medieval)|jousting tournaments]] in the guise of the tale's eponymous hero, Freydal. In the story, Freydal takes part in the tournaments to prove that he is worthy to marry a princess, who is a fictionalised representation of Maximilian's late wife, [[Mary of Burgundy]].\n\nThe text was never completed, although a manuscript draft is held by the [[Austrian National Library]]. 256 [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature paintings]] to accompany the text were created by court painters, and 255 are preserved in an [[illuminated manuscript]] \u2018tournament book\u2019 held by the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]]. These miniatures vividly record the different types of jousts that were popular at the time as well as the [[Masquerade ball|court masquerades]], or \u2018mummeries\u2019, that took place at the end of the day after each tournament. It is the most extensive visual record of late medieval tournaments and court masquerades that exists.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Portrait of Maximilian I - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], 1519.]]\n[[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and his father [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] were part of what was to become a long line of [[Holy Roman Emperors]] from the [[House of Habsburg]]. Maximilian was elected [[King of the Romans]] in 1486; upon his father's death in 1493 he succeeded to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=303}}</ref>\n\nDuring his reign, Maximilian commissioned a number of [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars and artists to assist him in completing a series of projects, in different art forms, intended to immortalize his life and deeds and those of his Habsburg ancestors.<ref name=\"Watanabe-O'Kelly94\">{{harvnb| Watanabe-O'Kelly|2000|p=94}}</ref> He referred to these projects as ''Gedechtnus'' (\"memorial\"),<ref name=\"Kleinschmidt162\">{{harvnb|Kleinschmidt|2008|p=162}}</ref> and included a series of stylised autobiographical works: ''Freydal'', the prose romance ''[[Weisskunig]]'', and the poem ''[[Theuerdank]]''.<ref name=\"Watanabe-O'Kelly94\"/>\n\n''Freydal'' and ''Theuerdank'' are closely linked and together give an allegorical account of the events leading to Maximilian's marriage to [[Mary of Burgundy]] in 1477.<ref name=moma120>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=120}}</ref> Mary died five years later, in 1482.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=300}}</ref> In ''Freydal'', which is partly a tribute to Mary,<ref name=\"Clephan 1995 88\">{{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=88}}</ref> the eponymous hero pursues his fair lady by [[jousting]] in [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]].<ref name=Freeman>{{harvnb|Freeman|2019}}</ref> ''Theuerdank'' is effectively a sequel in which the hero overcomes dangers on the journey to his wedding.<ref name=moma120/> ''Freydal'' has a comedic tone which contrasts with ''Theuerdank'', which has more of the character of a tragedy.<ref name=McLaren/>\n\nThe theme of ''Freydal'' reflects Maximilian's lifelong enthusiasm for jousting.

The narrative ends with Freydal setting out to search for her, and ''Theuerdank'' then takes up the subsequent story.<ref name=moma121/>\n\nThe work reflects Maximilian's vanity, as exemplified by a poem which forms part of the draft text:<ref name=\"Clephan 1995 88\"/>{{Quotation|This did the gallant Freydal<br>In knightly deeds of fame<br>Thus rendering illustrious<br>The glories of his name.<br>His virtues and his goodness<br>Are manifest to all;<br>His many glorious triumphs<br>At tilt, at masks and ball...<br>His like will ne\u2019er be seen again.<ref>translation {{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=88, note 1}}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, the tournaments described are based on encounters Maximilian actually had.

This results in a spectacular splintering of the lances. In the ''Scharfrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields) the shield is shown loosely fixed to the rider's breastplate, the aim being to dislodge it. In contrast, the objective of the ''Antzogenrennen'' is to unseat the opponent and his shield is fixed to his armour.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Feldrennen'' (or ''Kampfrennen'') jousts replicate skirmishes in war and the riders wear battlefield armour. The rarest type of joust depicted is the ''Kr\u00f6nlrennen'' where one rider wears the armour of a joust of peace but wields the lance of a joust of war and the other rider  has the opposite combination.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nOne of the most spectacular jousts depicted is the ''Bundrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields without [[bevors]])<ref name=moma121/> and its variation, ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' (joust of war with flying and exploding shields).<ref name=moma125>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=125}}</ref> In the ''Bundrennen'', the shield is held in place on the rider's breastplate with a complicated spring mechanism and when it is struck in the right place by the opponent it is ejected high into the air.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' increases the spectacle by attaching multiple triangular platelets to the shield which, when the shield is ejected, come loose and explode into the air like a firework display.<ref name=moma125/> Maximilian claimed to have invented this type of joust.<ref name=Freeman/> \n[[File:Freydal 05.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|Foot combat between Freydal and Claude de Vaudry (''Freydal'' ms. fol. 39, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref name=moma120/>]]\nIn each of the tournaments, the participants are shown engaging in a foot combat.

Not only is it the largest surviving tournament book, it is also an unparalleled pictorial source of jousting from the late medieval period.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|pp=120-121}}</ref> It is the only one to depict spectacular falls.<ref name=Freeman/> In addition to illustrating the jousts themselves, it represents a remarkable catalogue of the weaponry used during tournaments<ref name=Freeman/> and is the most extensive record of mummery, the early court masquerade, that exists.<ref name=moma122/> The manuscript has been recognised in [[UNESCO]]\u2019s [[Memory of the World Programme]].<ref>{{harvnb|Taschen Catalogue}}</ref>\n\nHowever, ''Freydal'' was intended to be not only an artistic work but also political propaganda.<ref>{{harvnb|Barber|1974|p=298}}</ref> As part of what he called his \u2018memorial projects\u2019 or ''Gedechtnus'', Maximilian I used literary and visual works such as ''Freydal'' to model and enhance his public image. His aim was to make up for his actual powerlessness and lack of centralised control over his own realms by presenting himself and his exploits as superior to any others.<ref name=muller>{{harv| M\u00fcller|2003|pp=307-308}}</ref> As the historian [[Jan-Dirk M\u00fcller]] ([[:de:Jan-Dirk M\u00fcller |de]]) has said, the extent to which Maximilian employed this strategy meant that his court

It was intended to be a romantic allegorical account of Maximilian's own participation in a series of [[Tournament (medieval)|jousting tournaments]] in the guise of the tale's eponymous hero, Freydal. In the story, Freydal takes part in the tournaments to prove that he is worthy to marry a princess, who is a fictionalised representation of Maximilian's late wife, [[Mary of Burgundy]].\n\nThe text was never completed, although a manuscript draft is held by the [[Austrian National Library]]. 256 [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature paintings]] to accompany the text were created by court painters, and 255 are preserved in an [[illuminated manuscript]] \u2018tournament book\u2019 held by the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]]. These miniatures vividly record the different types of jousts that were popular at the time as well as the [[Masquerade ball|court masquerades]], or \u2018mummeries\u2019, that took place at the end of the day after each tournament. It is the most extensive visual record of late medieval tournaments and court masquerades that exists.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Portrait of Maximilian I - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], 1519.]]\n[[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and his father [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] were part of what was to become a long line of [[Holy Roman Emperors]] from the [[House of Habsburg]]. Maximilian was elected [[King of the Romans]] in 1486; upon his father's death in 1493 he succeeded to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=303}}</ref>\n\nDuring his reign, Maximilian commissioned a number of [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars and artists to assist him in completing a series of projects, in different art forms, intended to immortalize his life and deeds and those of his Habsburg ancestors.<ref name=\"Watanabe-O'Kelly94\">{{harvnb| Watanabe-O'Kelly|2000|p=94}}</ref> He referred to these projects as ''Gedechtnus'' (\"memorial\"),<ref name=\"Kleinschmidt162\">{{harvnb|Kleinschmidt|2008|p=162}}</ref> and included a series of stylised autobiographical works: ''Freydal'', the prose romance ''[[Weisskunig]]'', and the poem ''[[Theuerdank]]''.<ref name=\"Watanabe-O'Kelly94\"/>\n\n''Freydal'' and ''Theuerdank'' are closely linked and together give an allegorical account of the events leading to Maximilian's marriage to [[Mary of Burgundy]] in 1477.<ref name=moma120>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=120}}</ref> Mary died five years later, in 1482.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=300}}</ref> In ''Freydal'', which is partly a tribute to Mary,<ref name=\"Clephan 1995 88\">{{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=88}}</ref> the eponymous hero pursues his fair lady by [[jousting]] in [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]].<ref name=Freeman>{{harvnb|Freeman|2019}}</ref> ''Theuerdank'' is effectively a sequel in which the hero overcomes dangers on the journey to his wedding.<ref name=moma120/> ''Freydal'' has a comedic tone which contrasts with ''Theuerdank'', which has more of the character of a tragedy.<ref name=McLaren/>\n\nThe theme of ''Freydal'' reflects Maximilian's lifelong enthusiasm for jousting. He attended his first tournament at the age of 14 and was captivated by its traditions and spectacle.<ref name=Freeman/> He staged many tournaments, including those to celebrate his wedding to Mary of Burgundy in 1477, his coronation as King of the Romans in 1486 and on the occasion of the [[First Congress of Vienna]] in 1515.<ref name=Freeman/> Maximilian was himself a participant in tournaments from 1485 until 1511, when he was in his 50s.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2017|pp=104\u2013105}}</ref> His affinity for jousting contributed to his [[soubriquet]] the \u201clast knight\u201d.<ref name=Freeman/>\n[[File:Freydal fol164.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|Post-tournament festivities: grotesque-style dancers or mummers dance a [[moresca]] while Freydal, in a mask and holding torches, looks on (''Freydal'' ms. fol.164, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref name=Locke123/>]]\n\n==Creation and history==\nMaximilian appears to have begun planning ''Freydal'' in 1502.<ref name=moma123>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=123}}</ref> The name ''Freydal'' was derived from ''Freyd-alb'', meaning \"white joyful young man\".<ref>{{harvnb|Strobl|1913|p=4}}</ref> In that year, he instructed his court taylor, Martin Trummer \"to have drawn in a book all those costumes as yet seen in mummeries organised by his majesty\".<ref name=moma123/> A \u201cmummery\u201d was a late medieval courtly [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]] or costumed dance.<ref name=moma122>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=122}}</ref>\n\nThis developed into the commissioning of planning sketches for the entire work, created over the next ten years.<ref name=moma123/> They were drawn in pen on [[laid paper]], using brown and black ink with watercolour over black chalk and leadpoint.<ref name=moma123/> A collection of 203 of these are housed in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|pp=120, 123}}</ref> A small number of additional drawings are held at the [[British Museum]] and the [[Vatican Library]].<ref name=moma123/>\n\nMaximilian took a leading part in the creation of the work.<ref name=Clephan87>{{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=87}}</ref> His instructions on the subjects to be illustrated as well as corrections, in his own hand, of some of the proofs have survived.

The narrative ends with Freydal setting out to search for her, and ''Theuerdank'' then takes up the subsequent story.<ref name=moma121/>\n\nThe work reflects Maximilian's vanity, as exemplified by a poem which forms part of the draft text:<ref name=\"Clephan 1995 88\"/>{{Quotation|This did the gallant Freydal<br>In knightly deeds of fame<br>Thus rendering illustrious<br>The glories of his name.<br>His virtues and his goodness<br>Are manifest to all;<br>His many glorious triumphs<br>At tilt, at masks and ball...<br>His like will ne\u2019er be seen again.<ref>translation {{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=88, note 1}}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, the tournaments described are based on encounters Maximilian actually had.

This results in a spectacular splintering of the lances. In the ''Scharfrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields) the shield is shown loosely fixed to the rider's breastplate, the aim being to dislodge it. In contrast, the objective of the ''Antzogenrennen'' is to unseat the opponent and his shield is fixed to his armour.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Feldrennen'' (or ''Kampfrennen'') jousts replicate skirmishes in war and the riders wear battlefield armour. The rarest type of joust depicted is the ''Kr\u00f6nlrennen'' where one rider wears the armour of a joust of peace but wields the lance of a joust of war and the other rider  has the opposite combination.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nOne of the most spectacular jousts depicted is the ''Bundrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields without [[bevors]])<ref name=moma121/> and its variation, ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' (joust of war with flying and exploding shields).<ref name=moma125>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=125}}</ref> In the ''Bundrennen'', the shield is held in place on the rider's breastplate with a complicated spring mechanism and when it is struck in the right place by the opponent it is ejected high into the air.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' increases the spectacle by attaching multiple triangular platelets to the shield which, when the shield is ejected, come loose and explode into the air like a firework display.<ref name=moma125/> Maximilian claimed to have invented this type of joust.<ref name=Freeman/> \n[[File:Freydal 05.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|Foot combat between Freydal and Claude de Vaudry (''Freydal'' ms. fol. 39, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref name=moma120/>]]\nIn each of the tournaments, the participants are shown engaging in a foot combat. A variety of weapons are used, including [[Mace (bludgeon)|iron clubs]] (''Eisenkolben''), [[Flail (weapon)|flails]] (''Drischel''), swords (''Turnierschwert'')<ref name=krause179>{{harvnb|Krause|2014|p=179}}</ref> and daggers.<ref name=krause181>{{harvnb|Krause|2014|p=181}}</ref> The ''[[Melee (tournament)|m\u00eal\u00e9e]]'' is also shown in the manuscript.<ref name=Clephan87/>\n\nAfter each of the sixty-four tournaments is a scene depicting a [[moresca]] (a pantomime dance) or other post-tournament festivities with male courtiers, including the knights who had competed in the tournament, dressing up to dance in a variety of exotic costumes.<ref name=Locke121/> Known as \u2018mummeries\u2019, these were a regular feature of the evening entertainment after tournaments.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nThe male courtiers in the mummeries in the manuscript dress up, amongst other things, in costumes based on nationality or ethnicity, for example [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]], [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] or [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] costume, or as animals such as [[apes]] and creatures with bird's heads.<ref name=Locke121/> In one masquerade illustrated, the male participants engage in [[cross-dressing]] and wear women's gowns.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nIn each scene, all the men are dressed in the same costume and normally wear a mask.

Not only is it the largest surviving tournament book, it is also an unparalleled pictorial source of jousting from the late medieval period.<ref>{{harv|Terjanian|2019|pp=120-121}}</ref> It is the only one to depict spectacular falls.<ref name=Freeman/> In addition to illustrating the jousts themselves, it represents a remarkable catalogue of the weaponry used during tournaments<ref name=Freeman/> and is the most extensive record of mummery, the early court masquerade, that exists.<ref name=moma122/> The manuscript has been recognised in [[UNESCO]]\u2019s [[Memory of the World Programme]].<ref>{{harv|Taschen Catalogue}}</ref>\n\nHowever, ''Freydal'' was intended to be not only an artistic work but also political propaganda.<ref>{{harvnb|Barber|1974|p=298}}</ref> As part of what he called his \u2018memorial projects\u2019 or ''Gedechtnus'', Maximilian I used literary and visual works such as ''Freydal'' to model and enhance his public image. His aim was to make up for his actual powerlessness and lack of centralised control over his own realms by presenting himself and his exploits as superior to any others.<ref name=muller>{{harv| M\u00fcller|2003|pp=307-308}}</ref> As the historian [[Jan-Dirk M\u00fcller]] ([[:de:Jan-Dirk M\u00fcller |de]]) has said, the extent to which Maximilian employed this strategy meant that his court

The platforms occupy the sidewalks of Southwest Yamhill and Morrison streets between Broadway and 6th Avenue in [[downtown Portland]], and are the 21st and 7th stops eastbound on the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]], respectively. They are situated directly west of the [[Portland Transit Mall]] at [[Pioneer Courthouse Square]]; these stations, along with the [[Pioneer Courthouse/Southwest 6th and Pioneer Place/Southwest 5th stations]] that are served by the [[MAX Green Line|Green]], [[MAX Orange Line|Orange]], and [[MAX Yellow Line|Yellow]] lines, mark the only point in the MAX system where passengers can transfer to any of the five existing lines.\n\nThe Pioneer Square stations are among the 27 original stations built as part of the Banfield light rail project. They opened along with the inaugural service of MAX on September 5, 1986. In September 2001, the Red Line began serving the stations, connecting downtown to [[Portland International Airport]]. From 2004 to 2009, the Pioneer Square stations were also served by the Yellow Line, which connected them to the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Expo Center]], until that line's realignment to the transit mall in August 2009.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Pioneer Courthouse Square}}\n\nThe Portland city block presently known as [[Pioneer Courthouse Square]] had previously been occupied by various structures, including a school, a hotel, and a parking garage. In March 1856, a proclamation combined Portland's two competing school districts and created School District No. 1, which built the city's first permanent public school at this location.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/central-school/#.XnI3dKhKhhE |title=Central School |publisher=[[Oregon Historical Society]] |date=March 17, 2018 |access-date=March 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930101129/https://www.oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/central-school/ |archive-date=March 18, 2020}}</ref> The school, which came to be referred to as Central School, opened on May 7, 1858.<ref>{{cite news |last=Killen |first=John |title=Throwback Thursday: Portland public schools, started in 1850s, took awhile to catch on |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=June 11, 2015 |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/history/2015/06/throwback_thursday_portland_pu.html |access-date=March 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200318151006/https://www.oregonlive.com/history/2015/06/throwback_thursday_portland_pu.html |archive-date=March 18, 2020}}</ref> With the arrival of the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] to Portland in 1883, [[Henry Villard]] purchased the site of Central School for $75,000 and began building a first class hotel. The ensuing [[Panic of 1884]] halted construction for five years due to the collapse of Villard's finances, leaving only a stone foundation that locals referred to as \"Villard's Ruins\". Construction resumed with the help of George B.

Oregon]], United States, served by [[TriMet]] as part of its [[MAX Light Rail]] system. The platforms occupy the sidewalks of Southwest Yamhill and Morrison streets between Broadway and 6th Avenue in [[downtown Portland]], and are the 21st and 7th stops eastbound on the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]], respectively. They are situated directly west of the [[Portland Transit Mall]] at [[Pioneer Courthouse Square]]; these stations, along with the [[Pioneer Courthouse/Southwest 6th and Pioneer Place/Southwest 5th stations]] that are served by the [[MAX Green Line|Green]], [[MAX Orange Line|Orange]], and [[MAX Yellow Line|Yellow]] lines, mark the only point in the MAX system where passengers can transfer to any of the five existing lines.\n\nThe Pioneer Square stations are among the 27 original stations built as part of the Banfield light rail project. They opened along with the inaugural service of MAX on September 5, 1986. In September 2001, the Red Line began serving the stations, connecting downtown to [[Portland International Airport]]. From 2004 to 2009, the Pioneer Square stations were also served by the Yellow Line, which connected them to the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Expo Center]], until that line's realignment to the transit mall in August 2009.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Pioneer Courthouse Square}}\n\nThe Portland city block presently known as [[Pioneer Courthouse Square]] had previously been occupied by various structures, including a school, a hotel, and a parking garage. In March 1856, a proclamation combined Portland's two competing school districts and created School District No. 1, which built the city's first permanent public school at this location.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/central-school/#.XnI3dKhKhhE |title=Central School |publisher=[[Oregon Historical Society]] |date=March 17, 2018 |access-date=March 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930101129/https://www.oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/central-school/ |archive-date=March 18, 2020}}</ref> The school, which came to be referred to as Central School, opened on May 7, 1858.<ref>{{cite news |last=Killen |first=John |title=Throwback Thursday: Portland public schools, started in 1850s, took awhile to catch on |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=June 11, 2015 |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/history/2015/06/throwback_thursday_portland_pu.html |access-date=March 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200318151006/https://www.oregonlive.com/history/2015/06/throwback_thursday_portland_pu.html |archive-date=March 18, 2020}}</ref> With the arrival of the [[Northern Pacific Railway]] to Portland in 1883, [[Henry Villard]] purchased the site of Central School for $75,000 and began building a first class hotel. The ensuing [[Panic of 1884]] halted construction for five years due to the collapse of Villard's finances, leaving only a stone foundation that locals referred to as \"Villard's Ruins\". Construction resumed with the help of George B. Markle and other local investors and the [[Portland Hotel]] opened on April 7, 1890.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--no by line; staff writer(s)--> |title=The Portland Hotel: Once the place to see and be seen |date=April 2, 2011 |newspaper=The Oregonian |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/O/2011/04/the_portland_hotel_once_the_pl.html |access-date=March 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1981, TriMet published a conceptual design report of the Banfield light rail project for the City of Portland that proposed a pair of light rail stations with platforms along the north end south ends of the planned Pioneer Courthouse Square.<ref name=\"Conceptual Design\">{{cite report |author=Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon |title=Banfield Light Rail Project: Conceptual Design Information for the City of Portland |url=https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&context=oscdl_trimet |publisher=TriMet Collection |volume=9 |date=November 1, 1981 |access-date=July 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928184313/http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&context=oscdl_trimet |archivedate=September 28, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{rp|37\u201338}}\n\n==Station details==\n{|table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=70 rowspan=3 valign=top|'''Sidewalk{{br}}platform'''\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=100 rowspan=2 valign=top| '''Westbound'''\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=530| \u2190 {{TMTC bullet|blue|size=5}} '''[[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]]''' towards {{stn|Hatfield Government Center}} <small>([[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue]])</small>\n|-\n| \u2190 {{TMTC bullet|red|size=5}} '''[[MAX Red Line|Red Line]]''' towards [[Beaverton Transit Center]] <small>([[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue]])</small>\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|<small>[[Side platform]], doors will open on the left</small>\n|-\n|colspan=3 align=center| [[Pioneer Courthouse Square]]\n|-\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" rowspan=3 valign=top|'''Sidewalk{{br}}platform'''\n|style=\"border-top:solid 1px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|{{small|[[Side platform]], doors will open on the left}}\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" rowspan=2 valign=top| '''Eastbound'''\n| <span style=\"color:white\">\u2192</span> {{TMTC bullet|blue|size=5}} '''[[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]]''' towards {{stn|Cleveland Avenue}} <small>([[Yamhill District and Morrison/Southwest 3rd Avenue stations|Yamhill District]])</small> \u2192\n|-\n|style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"| <span style=\"color:white\">\u2192</span> {{TMTC bullet|red|size=5}} '''[[MAX Red Line|Red Line]]''' towards {{stn|Portland International Airport}} <small>([[Yamhill District and Morrison/Southwest 3rd Avenue stations|Yamhill District]])</small> \u2192\n|}\n\nPioneer Courthouse Square hosts many popular events year round.

Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats (such as the small, spotted cats in the [[genus]] ''[[Leopardus]]'') in its external appearance. In fact, the jaguarundi shows several features seen in [[mustelid]]s (such as [[otter]]s and [[weasel]]s)\u2014it has an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the [[domestic cat]], the jaguarundi reaches nearly {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014gray and red.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. The jaguarundi is an efficient climber, but typically prefers hunting on ground. It feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. While they are fairly common in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, jaguarundis may have gone [[extinct]] in the US. The [[IUCN]] lists the jaguarundi as [[Least Concern]], but populations are in decline in many parts of its range due to loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] of their habitat and persecution for killing poultry.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe common name \"jaguarundi\" ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) comes from the [[Guarani language|Old Guarani]] word ''yaguarundi'', similar to the [[Old Tupi]] word ''yawaum'di''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=A.B.H. |year=1986 |title=Novo Dicion\u00e1rio da L\u00edngua Portuguesa|language=Portuguese |trans-title=New Dictionary of the Portuguese Language |edition=2nd|place=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Nova Fronteira |page=980}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|jaguarundi|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> In some [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries, the jaguarundi is also called ''gato colorado'', ''gato moro'', ''le\u00f3n brenero'', ''leoncillo'' and ''tigrillo''.<ref name=iucn/> It is also called ''eyra'', ''gato-mourisco'', ''gato-preto'', ''gato-vermelho'' and ''maracaj\u00e1-preto'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Miranda |first1=E.E. |last2=Gambarini |first2=A. |title=Natureza, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Cultura: Ensaio sobre a Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Homem com a Natureza no Brasil |trans-title=Nature, Conservation and Culture: Essay on the Relationship between Man and Nature in Brazil |date=2003 |publisher=Metalivros |location=S\u00e3o Paulo |isbn=9788585371470 |page=113 |language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Nowell |editor1-first=K. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |editor3-last=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |title=Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |date=1996 |publisher=IUCN |location=Gland |isbn=978-2-8317-0045-8 |page=146}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Felis yagouarundi'' was the [[scientific name]] used by [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] in 1803 who described two [[zoological specimen|specimen]]s from Central America, including one from [[French Guiana]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, \u00c9. |authorlink=\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire |year=1803 |title=Catalogue des Mammif\u00e8res du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |trans-title=Catalogue of Mammals of the National Museum of Natural History| language=French |location=Paris |publisher=Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |page=124 |chapter=Le chat yagouarundi.

The jaguarundi has a broad vocal repertoire; 13 different calls have been recorded including chattering, purring, screaming, a 'wah-wah' call, whistling, yapping and a peculiar bird-like chirp.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, who simply play with it till the mother ingests it; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=Nowak/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe jaguarundi inhabits a wide variety of habitats\u2014from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s.

[[felidae|cat]] native to the Americas. Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats (such as the small, spotted cats in the [[genus]] ''[[Leopardus]]'') in its external appearance. In fact, the jaguarundi shows several features seen in [[mustelid]]s (such as [[otter]]s and [[weasel]]s)\u2014it has an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the [[domestic cat]], the jaguarundi stands {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014gray and red.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. The jaguarundi is an efficient climber, but typically prefers hunting on ground. It feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. While they are fairly common in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, jaguarundis may have gone [[extinct]] in the US. The [[IUCN]] lists the jaguarundi as [[Least Concern]], but populations are in decline in many parts of its range due to loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] of their habitat and persecution for killing poultry.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe common name \"jaguarundi\" ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) comes from the [[Guarani language|Old Guarani]] word ''yaguarundi'', similar to the [[Old Tupi]] word ''yawaum'di''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=A.B.H. |year=1986 |title=Novo Dicion\u00e1rio da L\u00edngua Portuguesa|language=Portuguese |trans-title=New Dictionary of the Portuguese Language |edition=2nd|place=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Nova Fronteira |page=980}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|jaguarundi|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> In some [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries, the jaguarundi is also called ''gato colorado'', ''gato moro'', ''le\u00f3n brenero'', ''leoncillo'' and ''tigrillo''.<ref name=iucn/> It is also called ''eyra'', ''gato-mourisco'', ''gato-preto'', ''gato-vermelho'' and ''maracaj\u00e1-preto'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Miranda |first1=E.E. |last2=Gambarini |first2=A. |title=Natureza, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Cultura: Ensaio sobre a Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Homem com a Natureza no Brasil |trans-title=Nature, Conservation and Culture: Essay on the Relationship between Man and Nature in Brazil |date=2003 |publisher=Metalivros |location=S\u00e3o Paulo |isbn=9788585371470 |page=113 |language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Nowell |editor1-first=K. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |editor3-last=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |title=Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |date=1996 |publisher=IUCN |location=Gland |isbn=978-2-8317-0045-8 |page=146}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Felis yagouarundi'' was the [[scientific name]] used by [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] in 1803 who described two [[zoological specimen|specimen]]s from Central America, including one from [[French Guiana]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, \u00c9. |authorlink=\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire |year=1803 |title=Catalogue des Mammif\u00e8res du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |trans-title=Catalogue of Mammals of the National Museum of Natural History| language=French |location=Paris |publisher=Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |page=124 |chapter=Le chat yagouarundi.

The jaguarundi has a broad vocal repertoire; 13 different calls have been recorded including chattering, purring, screaming, a 'wah-wah' call, whistling, yapping and a peculiar bird-like chirp.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, who simply play with it till the mother ingests it; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=Nowak/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe jaguarundi inhabits a wide variety of habitats\u2014from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s.

Permafrost does not have to be the first layer that is on the ground. It can be an inch to over miles deep into the Earth\u2019s surface. Some of the most common permafrost locations are located in the Northern Hemisphere. 85% of Alaska, Greenland Canada and Siberia is sitting on top of a layer of permafrost, that is almost a quarter of the Northern Hemisphere. It can also be located in the Southern Hemisphere, just on mountain tops. Permafrost frequently occurs in ground ice, but it also can be presented in non-porous bedrock. Permafrost is formed from ice holding all different sorts of soil, sand, and rock combination together (NASA ClimateKids).\n\n==History==\n\"In contrast to the relative dearth of reports on frozen ground in north America prior to [[World War II]], a vast literature on the engineering aspects of permafrost was available in Russian.

Frozen ground is that which is below the freezing point of water, whether or not water is present in the substrate. Ground ice is not always present, as may be the case with nonporous bedrock, but it frequently occurs and may be present in amounts exceeding the potential [[Phreatic zone|hydraulic saturation]] of the thawed substrate.\n\nBy definition, permafrost is ground that remains frozen for two or more years. Since frozen soil, including permafrost, comprises a large percentage of substrate materials other than ice, it thaws rather than melts even as any ice content melts.Thawing is the process of ice, snow, or another frozen substance becoming liquid or soft as a result of warming up whereas melting is when a substance becomes liquefied by heat. One visible sign of permafrost degradation is the [[Drunken trees|random displacement of trees from their vertical orientation]] in permafrost areas.\n\nAs a consequence, precipitation has increased, which in turn results in the weakening and eventual collapse of buildings in areas such as Norilsk in northern Russia, which lies upon the permafrost.<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180\" style=\"font-size:100%; line-height:130%\">\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 009.jpg|Thawing permafrost in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2013\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 010.jpg|Thawing permafrost in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2013\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 001.jpg|Thawing permafrost in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2013\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 015.jpg|Permafrost and ice in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2012\nFile:Permafrost thaw ponds in Hudson Bay Canada near Greenland.jpg|Permafrost thaw ponds on peatland in [[Hudson Bay]], Canada in 2008.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Permafrost and Peatland Evolution in the Northern Hudson Bay Lowland, Manitoba|url=http://arctic.journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/view/3332|authors=Larry D.

As the ice sheets melted to again become seawater, the permafrost became submerged shelves under relatively warm and salty boundary conditions, compared to surface permafrost. Therefore, subsea permafrost exists in conditions that lead to its diminishment.

Three common solutions include: using [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]] on wood [[Deep foundation|piles]]; building on a thick [[gravel]] pad (usually 1\u20132 metres/3.3\u20136.6 feet thick); or using [[anhydrous ammonia]] [[heat pipe]]s.<ref name=\"ASCE\">\n{{cite book\n | last = Clarke\n | first = Edwin S.\n | title = Permafrost Foundations\u2014State of the Practice\n | work = Monograph Series\n | publisher = American Society of Civil Engineers\n | date = 2007\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O-voTug5apsC&pg=PA34\n | isbn = 978-0-7844-0947-3}}\n</ref> The [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] uses [[Heat pipe#Permafrost cooling|heat pipes built into vertical supports]] to prevent the pipeline from sinking and the [[Qingzang railway]] in [[Tibet]] employs a variety of methods to keep the ground cool, both in areas with [[Frost heaving#Frost-susceptible soils|frost-susceptible soil]].

Permafrost does not have to be the first layer that is on the ground. It can be an inch to over miles deep into the Earth\u2019s surface. Some of the most common permafrost locations are located in the Northern Hemisphere. 85% of Alaska, Greenland Canada and Siberia is sitting on top of a layer of permafrost, that is almost a quarter of the Northern Hemisphere. It can also be located in the Southern Hemisphere, just on mountain tops. Permafrost frequently occurs in ground ice, but it also can be presented in non-porous bedrock. Permafrost is formed from ice holding all different sorts of soil, sand, and rock combination together (NASA ClimateKids).\n\n==History==\n\"In contrast to the relative dearth of reports on frozen ground in north America prior to [[World War II]], a vast literature on the engineering aspects of permafrost was available in Russian.

Frozen ground is that which is below the freezing point of water, whether or not water is present in the substrate. Ground ice is not always present, as may be the case with nonporous bedrock, but it frequently occurs and may be present in amounts exceeding the potential [[Phreatic zone|hydraulic saturation]] of the thawed substrate.\n\nBy definition, permafrost is ground that remains frozen for two or more years. Since frozen soil, including permafrost, comprises a large percentage of substrate materials other than ice, it thaws rather than melts even as any ice content melts.Thawing is the process of ice, snow, or another frozen substance becoming liquid or soft as a result of warming up whereas melting is when a substance becomes liquefied by heat.

Therefore, subsea permafrost exists in conditions that lead to its diminishment.

It convenes International Permafrost Conferences, undertakes special projects such as preparing databases, maps, bibliographies, and glossaries, and coordinates international field programmes and networks. Among other issues addressed by the IPA are: Problems for construction on permafrost owing to the change of soil properties of the ground on which structures are placed and the biological processes in permafrost, e.g. the preservation of organisms frozen ''in situ''.\n\n===Construction on permafrost===\nBuilding on permafrost is difficult because the heat of the building (or [[pipeline transport|pipeline]]) can thaw the permafrost and destabilize the structure. Three common solutions include: using [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]] on wood [[Deep foundation|piles]]; building on a thick [[gravel]] pad (usually 1\u20132 metres/3.3\u20136.6 feet thick); or using [[anhydrous ammonia]] [[heat pipe]]s.<ref name=\"ASCE\">\n{{cite book\n | last = Clarke\n | first = Edwin S.\n | title = Permafrost Foundations\u2014State of the Practice\n | work = Monograph Series\n | publisher = American Society of Civil Engineers\n | date = 2007\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O-voTug5apsC&pg=PA34\n | isbn = 978-0-7844-0947-3}}\n</ref> The [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] uses [[Heat pipe#Permafrost cooling|heat pipes built into vertical supports]] to prevent the pipeline from sinking and the [[Qingzang railway]] in [[Tibet]] employs a variety of methods to keep the ground cool, both in areas with [[Frost heaving#Frost-susceptible soils|frost-susceptible soil]]. Permafrost may necessitate special enclosures for buried utilities, called \"[[Utility tunnel#In Arctic towns|utilidors]]\".\n\nThe [[Melnikov Permafrost Institute]] in [[Yakutsk]], found that the sinking of large buildings into the ground can be prevented by using pile foundations extending down to {{convert|15|m}} or more. At this depth the temperature does not change with the seasons, remaining at about {{convert|-5|C}}.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n{{Clear}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:PICT4417Sykhus.JPG|Modern buildings in permafrost zones may be built on piles to avoid permafrost-thaw foundation failure from the heat of the building.\nFile:Trans-Alaska Pipeline (1).jpg|[[Heat pipe#Permafrost cooling|Heat pipes in vertical supports]] maintain a frozen bulb around portions of the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]] that are at risk of thawing.\nFile:Yakoutsk Construction d'immeuble.jpg|Pile foundations in [[Yakutsk]], a city underlain with continuous permafrost.\nFile:Raised pipes in permafrost.jpg|[[District heating]] pipes run above ground in Yakutsk to avoid thawing permafrost.\n</gallery>\n\n===Revival of organisms preserved in permafrost===\nIn 2012, Russian researchers proved that permafrost can serve as a natural repository for ancient life forms by reviving of ''[[Silene stenophylla]]'' from 30,000 year old tissue found in an [[Ice Age]] squirrel burrow in the [[Siberian]] permafrost. This is the oldest plant tissue ever revived. The plant was fertile, producing white flowers and viable seeds. The study demonstrated that tissue can survive ice preservation for tens of thousands of years.<ref>{{Citation\n |last         = Isachenkov\n |first        = Vladimir\n |title        = Russians revive Ice Age flower from frozen burrow\n |newspaper    = Phys.Org\n |date         = February 20, 2012\n |url          = http://phys.org/news/2012-02-russians-revive-ice-age-frozen.html\n |access-date  = 2016-04-26\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160424214832/http://phys.org/news/2012-02-russians-revive-ice-age-frozen.html\n |archive-date = 2016-04-24\n |url-status     = live\n}}</ref> A 2016 outbreak of [[anthrax]] in the [[Yamal Peninsula]] is believed to be due to thawing permafrost.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/08/03/488400947/anthrax-outbreak-in-russia-thought-to-be-result-of-thawing-permafrost|title=Anthrax Outbreak In Russia Thought To Be Result Of Thawing Permafrost|access-date=2016-09-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160922013246/http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/08/03/488400947/anthrax-outbreak-in-russia-thought-to-be-result-of-thawing-permafrost|archive-date=2016-09-22|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, one study was done by taking late Pleistocene Siberian permafrost samples from Kolyma Lowland (an east siberian lowland). Researchers used DNA isolation and gene cloning (specifically 16S rRNA genes) to determine which phyla these microorganisms belonged to. With this technique, it allowed the researchers to compare known microorganisms, to their newly discovered samples. Thus, revealing 8 phylotypes which belonged to the phyla Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. \n\n==See also==\n*[[Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist |30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary}}\n{{Commons category|Permafrost}}\n*[http://permafrost.gi.alaska.edu/ Permafrostwatch] University of Alaska Fairbanks\n*[https://page21.org/press-center/2-uncategorised/55-promotional-material Infographics about permafrost]\n*[http://www.ipa-permafrost.org International Permafrost Association (IPA)]\n*[http://cenperm.ku.dk/ Center for Permafrost]\n*[http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/p1386a/gallery5-fig04b.html Map of permafrost in Antarctica.]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxixy1u8GjY Permafrost \u2013 what is it? \u2013 YouTube] (Alfred Wegener Institute)\n{{periglacial environment}}\n{{Geotechnical engineering}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Geography of the Arctic]]\n[[Category:Geomorphology]]\n[[Category:Montane ecology]]\n[[Category:Patterned grounds]]\n[[Category:Pedology]]\n[[Category:Physical geography]]\n[[Category:Permafrost]]\n[[Category:Words coined in the 1940s]]\n", "name_user": "HopsonRoad", "label": "safe", "comment": "Citations belong after text that they support.
