During the late 1800s and early 1900s, many colonizers faced labor shortages due to the abolition of slavery; thus, they imported many Indians, many from Bhojpuri-speaking regions, as indentured servants to labor on plantations.

In 1933, Townsend turned to Mexico with the purpose of translating the Bible into indigenous languages there, as he had done for Kaqchikel. Townsend established a working relation with the Mexican ministry of education under the progressive government of [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] and founded SIL to educate linguist-missionaries to work in Mexico.  Through the following decades the SIL linguists worked at providing literacy education to indigenous people of Mexico, while simultaneously working with SIL's partner organization, [[Wycliffe Bible Translators]], also founded by Townsend, to translate the Bible into the languages where they were working.  SIL gradually extended its work to other regions of the world where indigenous languages were spoken, including [[Papua New Guinea]], Southeast Asia and Africa.  While initially SIL's staff only received basic training in linguistics and anthropology, gradually the organization has become more professional, and today many members have advanced degrees.\n\nSIL has more than 6,000 members from over 50 countries.  Based on their language documentation work, SIL publishes a database, ''[[Ethnologue]]'', of its research into the world's languages, and develops and publishes software programs for language documentation, such as FieldWorks Language Explorer (FLEx) and Lexique Pro.  SIL holds formal consultative status with the [[United Nations]], has been recognized by [[UNESCO]] for their contributions in Asia,<ref>[http://www.unescobkk.org/index.php?id=2900 Appeal: SIL (Summer Institute of Linguistics) International<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and is a member of the [[Forum of Bible Agencies International]].\n\nIts headquarters are located in [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]].\n\n== History ==\n[[William Cameron Townsend]], a Presbyterian minister, founded the organization in 1934. In the early 1930s, Townsend worked as a [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]] [[missionary]] among the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel Maya people]] in Guatemala. In 1933, he turned to Mexico with the purpose of translating the Bible into indigenous languages there, as he had done for Kaqchikel. Townsend established a working relationship with the Mexican [[Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico)|Secretariat of Public Education]] under the government of President [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] (in office 1934-1940) and founded SIL to educate linguist-missionaries to work in Mexico. Because the Mexican government did not allow missionary work through its educational system, Townsend founded [[Wycliffe Bible Translators]] in 1942 as a separate organization from SIL. Wycliffe Bible Translators focused on Bible translation and missionary activities whereas SIL focused on linguistic documentation and literacy education.<ref>{{cite book |last = Hartch |first = Todd |year = 2006 |title = Missionaries of the State: The Summer Institute of Linguistics, State Formation, and Indigenous Mexico, 1935\u20131985 |publisher = University of Alabama Press |location = Tuscaloosa, [[Alabama|AL]] }}</ref>\n\nHaving initiated the collaboration with the Mexican education authorities, Townsend started the institute as a small summer training session in [[Sulphur Springs, Benton County, Arkansas|Sulphur Springs, Arkansas]] in 1934 to train missionaries in basic [[Linguistics|linguistic]], [[Anthropology|anthropological]], and translation principles.  Through the following decades the SIL linguists worked at providing literacy education to indigenous people of Mexico, while simultaneously working with the Wycliffe Bible Translators on Bible translation.  One of the students at the first summer institute in its second year, 1935, [[Kenneth Lee Pike]] (1912\u20132000), would become the foremost figure in the history of SIL.  He served as SIL's president from 1942 to 1979, then as president emeritus until his death in 2000.\n\nIn 1979, SIL's agreement with the Mexican government was officially terminated{{by whom|date=April 2016}} after critiques from anthropologists regarding the combination of education and missionary activities in indigenous communities, though SIL continued to be active in that country.{{Sfn | Clarke | 2001 | p = 182 }}  At a conference of the Inter-American Indian Institute in [[M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n]], in November 1980, delegates denounced the Summer Institute of Linguistics, charging that it was using a scientific name to conceal its [[Protestant]] agenda and an alleged [[Capitalism|capitalist]] view that was alien to indigenous traditions.{{Sfn | Bonner | 1999 | p = 20 }} This led to the agreement with the [[Ecuador]]an government being terminated in 1980,{{Sfn | Yashar | 2005 | p = 118 }} although a token presence remained.  In the early 1990s, the [[Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador]] (CONAIE) demanded the expulsion of SIL from the country.{{Sfn | Yashar | 2005 | p = 146 }}  SIL was also expelled from [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], and [[Panama]], and restricted in [[Colombia]] and [[Peru]].{{Sfn | Cleary | Steigenga | 2004 | p = 36}}   {{As of | 2016 }}, SIL operates in several of those countries.<ref name = \"Worldwide\" />\n\nFrom the 1950s to 1987 the [[University of Oklahoma]] in [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]] hosted SIL training.

SIL endeavors to share both the data and the results of analysis in order to contribute to the overall knowledge of language. This has resulted in publications on languages such as [[Hixkaryana language|Hixkaryana]] and [[Pirah\u00e3 language|Pirah\u00e3]], which have challenged the universality of some linguistic theories. SIL's work has resulted in over 20,000 technical publications, all of which are listed in the SIL Bibliography.<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = https://www.sil.org/resources/language-culture-archives | title = Language and Culture Archives | contribution = Bibliography | publisher = SIL }}.</ref>  Most of these are a reflection of linguistic fieldwork.<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.sil.org/linguistics/fieldwork.html | title = Linguistics | contribution = Fieldwork | publisher = SIL }}.</ref>\n\nSIL's focus has not been on the development of new linguistic theories, but [[tagmemics]], though no longer promoted by SIL, was developed by [[Kenneth Pike]], who also coined the words [[emic and etic]], more widely used today in anthropology.<ref>Headland et. al. 1990.</ref>\n\nAnother focus of SIL is literacy work, particularly in indigenous languages. SIL assists local, regional, and national agencies that are developing formal and informal education in vernacular languages. These cooperative efforts enable new advances in the complex field of educational development in multilingual and multicultural societies.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.sil.org/sil/ | title = About | publisher = SIL International | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20051124141723/http://www.sil.org/sil/ | archive-date = 2005-11-24 | df =  }}.</ref>\n\nSIL provides instructors and instructional materials for linguistics programs at several major institutions of higher learning around the world.

Other universities with SIL programs include [[Trinity Western University]] in [[Canada]], [[Charles Darwin University]] in [[Australia]], and Universidad Ricardo Palma in Lima, Peru.\n\nThe organization has recently established a new Language and Culture Documentation Services Unit that aims to preserve and revitalize languages threatened by extinction.

In 1933, Townsend turned to Mexico with the purpose of translating the Bible into indigenous languages there, as he had done for Kaqchikel. Townsend established a working relation with the Mexican ministry of education under the progressive government of [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] and founded SIL to educate linguist-missionaries to work in Mexico.  Through the following decades the SIL linguists worked at providing literacy education to indigenous people of Mexico, while simultaneously working with SIL's partner organization, [[Wycliffe Bible Translators]], also founded by Townsend, to translate the Bible into the languages where they were working.  SIL gradually extended its work to other regions of the world where indigenous languages were spoken, including [[Papua New Guinea]], Southeast Asia and Africa.  While initially SIL's staff only received basic training in linguistics and anthropology, gradually the organization has become more professional, and today many members have advanced degrees.\n\nSIL has more than 6,000 members from over 50 countries.  Based on their language documentation work, SIL publishes a database, ''[[Ethnologue]]'', of its research into the world's languages, and develops and publishes software programs for language documentation, such as FieldWorks Language Explorer (FLEx) and Lexique Pro.  SIL holds formal consultative status with the [[United Nations]], has been recognized by [[UNESCO]] for their contributions in Asia,<ref>[http://www.unescobkk.org/index.php?id=2900 Appeal: SIL (Summer Institute of Linguistics) International<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and is a member of the [[Forum of Bible Agencies International]].\n\nIts headquarters are located in [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]].\n\n== History ==\n[[William Cameron Townsend]], a Presbyterian minister, founded the organization in 1934. In the early 1930s, Townsend worked as a [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]] [[missionary]] among the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel Maya people]] in Guatemala. In 1933, he turned to Mexico with the purpose of translating the Bible into indigenous languages there, as he had done for Kaqchikel. Townsend established a working relationship with the Mexican [[Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico)|Secretariat of Public Education]] under the government of President [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] (in office 1934-1940) and founded SIL to educate linguist-missionaries to work in Mexico. Because the Mexican government did not allow missionary work through its educational system, Townsend founded [[Wycliffe Bible Translators]] in 1942 as a separate organization from SIL. Wycliffe Bible Translators focused on Bible translation and missionary activities whereas SIL focused on linguistic documentation and literacy education.<ref>{{cite book |last = Hartch |first = Todd |year = 2006 |title = Missionaries of the State: The Summer Institute of Linguistics, State Formation, and Indigenous Mexico, 1935\u20131985 |publisher = University of Alabama Press |location = Tuscaloosa, [[Alabama|AL]] }}</ref>\n\nHaving initiated the collaboration with the Mexican education authorities, Townsend started the institute as a small summer training session in [[Sulphur Springs, Benton County, Arkansas|Sulphur Springs, Arkansas]] in 1934 to train missionaries in basic [[Linguistics|linguistic]], [[Anthropology|anthropological]], and translation principles.  Through the following decades the SIL linguists worked at providing literacy education to indigenous people of Mexico, while simultaneously working with the Wycliffe Bible Translators on Bible translation.  One of the students at the first summer institute in its second year, 1935, [[Kenneth Lee Pike]] (1912\u20132000), would become the foremost figure in the history of SIL.  He served as SIL's president from 1942 to 1979, then as president emeritus until his death in 2000.\n\nIn 1979, SIL's agreement with the Mexican government was officially terminated{{by whom|date=April 2016}} after critiques from anthropologists regarding the combination of education and missionary activities in indigenous communities, though SIL continued to be active in that country.{{Sfn | Clarke | 2001 | p = 182 }}  At a conference of the Inter-American Indian Institute in [[M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n]], in November 1980, delegates denounced the Summer Institute of Linguistics, charging that it was using a scientific name to conceal its [[Protestant]] agenda and an alleged [[Capitalism|capitalist]] view that was alien to indigenous traditions.{{Sfn | Bonner | 1999 | p = 20 }} This led to the agreement with the [[Ecuador]]an government being terminated in 1980,{{Sfn | Yashar | 2005 | p = 118 }} although a token presence remained.  In the early 1990s, the [[Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador]] (CONAIE) demanded the expulsion of SIL from the country.{{Sfn | Yashar | 2005 | p = 146 }}  SIL was also expelled from [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], and [[Panama]], and restricted in [[Colombia]] and [[Peru]].{{Sfn | Cleary | Steigenga | 2004 | p = 36}}   {{As of | 2016 }}, SIL operates in several of those countries.<ref name = \"Worldwide\" />\n\nFrom the 1950s to 1987 the [[University of Oklahoma]] in [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]] hosted SIL training. The agreement between the university and SIL was terminated{{by whom|date=April 2016}} in 1987 after a controversy about SIL's involvement in missionary activities and its relationship with Latin American governments.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}.

SIL endeavors to share both the data and the results of analysis in order to contribute to the overall knowledge of language. This has resulted in publications on languages such as [[Hixkaryana language|Hixkaryana]] and [[Pirah\u00e3 language|Pirah\u00e3]], which have challenged the universality of some linguistic theories. SIL's work has resulted in over 20,000 technical publications, all of which are listed in the SIL Bibliography.<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = https://www.sil.org/resources/language-culture-archives | title = Language and Culture Archives | contribution = Bibliography | publisher = SIL }}.</ref>  Most of these are a reflection of linguistic fieldwork.<ref>{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.sil.org/linguistics/fieldwork.html | title = Linguistics | contribution = Fieldwork | publisher = SIL }}.</ref>\n\nSIL's focus has not been on the development of new linguistic theories, but [[tagmemics]], though no longer promoted by SIL, was developed by [[Kenneth Pike]], who also coined the words [[emic and etic]], more widely used today in anthropology.<ref>Headland et. al. 1990.</ref>\n\nAnother focus of SIL is literacy work, particularly in indigenous languages. SIL assists local, regional, and national agencies that are developing formal and informal education in vernacular languages.

Other universities with SIL programs include [[Trinity Western University]] in [[Canada]], [[Charles Darwin University]] in [[Australia]], and Universidad Ricardo Palma in Lima, Peru.\n\nThe organization has recently established a new Language and Culture Documentation Services Unit that aims to preserve and revitalize languages threatened by extinction.

In 1973, SIL was awarded the [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] for International Understanding.
