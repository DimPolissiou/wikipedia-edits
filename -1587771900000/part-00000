Other examples of his compositions appeared in the ''[[English Hymnal]]''.\n\n====Further Chieftains====\nWhile the Clan Chief is also chieftain of Oliphant of Condie, further chieftains include:\n\n*OLIPHANT OF BACHILTON, OLIPHANT OF CULTEUCHAR & OLIPHANT OF CARPOW:  These three are \"in process\" of being claimed although David Olyphant of Bachilton is an armigerous \"one feather\" Chieftain of Bachilton.  Bachilton is an early offshoot branch and is most closely linked to the Oliphants of Culteuchar, large landowners in Fife. From the Culteuchar Oliphants descend the largest number of American Oliphants.\n*OLIPHANT OF GASK: Laurence Kington Blair Oliphant of Ardblair and Gask is Chieftain of the Gask branch. This branch produced Scotland's greatest poetess, Carolina Nairne, Lady Nairne. Later descendants through the female line, going by the name of Kington-Blair-Oliphant or Blair-Oliphant, include an Air Vice-Marshal and two composers in film and television.  Laurence lives at Ardblair Castle, a Clan Blair seat inherited by the Gask Oliphants by marriage to a Robertson of Struan. Ardblair contains not only the majority of the Gask Oliphant artifacts and portraits but also the Lords Oliphants' charters and known possessions, so remains hugely important to Clan Oliphant.  With his surname including that of Blair, Laurence is also a Chieftain of that Clan, as BLAIR of ARDBLAIR and thereby is Chieftain of the nearby Blairgowrie Games;\n*OLIPHANT OF KELLIE: The Kellie Castle branch, currently without a chieftain, produced [[Margaret Oliphant]], the author.\n*OLIPHANT OF ROSSIE:  John Oliphant of Rossie is Chieftain of this branch which produced a Postmaster General of Scotland who appeared in Charles Lee's renowned 1847 painting \"The Golfers\" and, more recently, the late [[Betty Oliphant]], co-founder of [[Canada's National Ballet School]];\n\n====Other branches====\nOther branches of Clan Oliphant do exist but as of today they still await rightful claimants for their chieftainly arms and the right to wear one or two eagle's feathers.  These have produced a US General, the renowned Australian scientist Sir [[Mark Oliphant]] who was involved in the [[Manhattan Project]], his nephew the influential cartoonist, [[Pat Oliphant]] and the ''Globe'' journalist, [[Thomas Oliphant]].\n\n==Tartan==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=10% |Tartan image\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=90% |Notes\n|-\n|[[File:Oliphant tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|180px]] || ''Olyfavnt'' [[tartan]], as published in 1842 in ''[[Vestiarium Scoticum]]''.\n|}\n\n==Castles and clan seat==\n\n*[[Kellie Castle]] was built and owned by Oliphants from 1360 to 1613.\n*[[Castle of Old Wick|Old Wick Castle]] and Berriedale Castle, held by [[Clan Sutherland]] in the 15th century, came to Sir William Oliphant of Berriedale (the progenitor of the Oliphant's of Berriedale) second son of the second Lord Oliphant, by his marriage to Christian, the daughter and heiress of Alexander Sutherland of Duffus in 1497.\n*[[Hatton Castle, Angus|Hatton Castle]] was built in 1575 by Laurence, the 4th Lord Oliphant and replaced the previous nearby wooden fortalice of [[Balcraig Castle]].  Hatton Castle was restored in the 20th century.\n*Following the decline in the Oliphant fortunes and the loss of Aberdalgie by the main branch of the family, by the 19th century the estates of Gask in Perthshire, [[List of listed buildings in Forgandenny, Perth and Kinross|Condie]], Rossie also in Perthshire and Kinneddar were those most associated with the Oliphant Clan. Although the land at Gask was held by Oliphants from the mid 14th century and although no Castle was ever built there, it is the site of 'The Auld Hoose' in Carolina Oliphant's song.\n*There is no Clan Seat currently but [[Ardblair Castle]], near Blairgowrie in Perthshire is the seat of one of the Clan Chieftains, the Oliphant of Gask.  Ardblair contains the largest collection of Oliphant heirlooms and portraits today.\n\n==See also==\n*[[David Olifard]]\n*[[Laurence, 1st Lord Oliphant]]\n*[[Laurence Oliphant, 3rd Lord Oliphant]]\n*[[Lord Oliphant]]\n*[[Oliphant (disambiguation)]]\n*[[William Oliphant, Lord Newton]]\n*[[William Oliphant, Lord of Aberdalgie]]\n*[[Margaret Oliphant]]\n*[[Thomas Oliphant (musician and artist)]]\n*[[Laurence Oliphant (Scottish politician)|Laurence Oliphant, 8th of Condie]]\n*[[Anthony Oliphant|Sir Anthony Oliphant]]\n*[[Laurence Oliphant (author)]]\n*[[Laurence Oliphant (British Army officer)|Major General Sir Laurence James Oliphant]]\n*[[James Oliphant]]\n*[[Lancelot Oliphant|Sir Lancelot Oliphant]]\n*[[Laurence Oliphant (Jacobite)]]\n*[[Findo Gask]]\n*[[Rob Oliphant]]\n*[[Scottish clan]]\n*[[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Belgium]]\n*[[Maha Nuge Gardens]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n<ref>{{cite book|last1=Oxenham Hewlett|first1=William|title=Notes on dignities in the peerage of Scotland which are dormant or which have been forfeited|date=1882|publisher=Wildy & Sons|location=London|isbn=1342403894|edition=First|url=https://archive.org/details/notesondignities00hewluoft|accessdate=16 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.clanoliphant.com/ Oliphant Clan and Family Association]\n*[http://www.scotclans.com/scottish-clans/clan-oliphant/ Clan Oliphant at ScotClans.com]\n*[http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/ntor/oliphan2.html http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/ntor/oliphan2.html]\n*[http://www.scotweb.co.uk/info/oliphant/]\n*[[John Riddell (genealogist)|John Riddell]], [https://archive.org/details/inquiryintolawa00riddgoog ''Inquiry into the law and practice in Scottish peerages: before, and after the union; involving the questions of jurisdiction, and forfeiture: together with an exposition of our genuine, original consistorial law'', pub.

Other examples of his compositions appeared in the ''[[English Hymnal]]''.\n\n====Further Chieftains====\nWhile the Clan Chief is also chieftain of Oliphant of Condie, further chieftains include:\n\n*OLIPHANT OF BACHILTON, OLIPHANT OF CULTEUCHAR & OLIPHANT OF CARPOW:  These three are \"in process\" of being claimed although David Olyphant of Bachilton is an armigerous \"one feather\" Chieftain pf Bachilton.  Bachilton is an early offshoot branch and is most closely linked to the Oliphants of Culteuchar, large landowners in Fife. From the Culteuchar Oliphants descend the largest number of American Oliphants.\n*OLIPHANT OF GASK: Laurence Kington Blair Oliphant of Ardblair and Gask is Chieftain of the Gask branch. This branch produced Scotland's greatest poetess, Carolina Nairne, Lady Nairne. Later descendants through the female line, going by the name of Kington-Blair-Oliphant or Blair-Oliphant, include an Air Vice-Marshal and two composers in film and television.  Laurence lives at Ardblair Castle, a Clan Blair seat inherited by the Gask Oliphants by marriage to a Robertson of Struan. Ardblair contains not only the majority of the Gask Oliphant artifacts and portraits but also the Lords Oliphants' charters and known possessions, so remains hugely important to Clan Oliphant.  With his surname including that of Blair, Laurence is also a Chieftain of that Clan, as BLAIR of ARDBLAIR and thereby is Chieftain of the nearby Blairgowrie Games;\n*OLIPHANT OF KELLIE: The Kellie Castle branch, currently without a chieftain, produced [[Margaret Oliphant]], the author.\n*OLIPHANT OF ROSSIE:  John Oliphant of Rossie is Chieftain of this branch which produced a Postmaster General of Scotland who appeared in Charles Lee's renowned 1847 painting \"The Golfers\" and, more recently, the late [[Betty Oliphant]], co-founder of [[Canada's National Ballet School]];\n\n====Other branches====\nOther branches of Clan Oliphant do exist but as of today they still await rightful claimants for their chieftainly arms and the right to wear one or two eagle's feathers.  These have produced a US General, the renowned Australian scientist Sir [[Mark Oliphant]] who was involved in the [[Manhattan Project]], his nephew the influential cartoonist, [[Pat Oliphant]] and the ''Globe'' journalist, [[Thomas Oliphant]].\n\n==Tartan==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=10% |Tartan image\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=90% |Notes\n|-\n|[[File:Oliphant tartan (Vestiarium Scoticum).png|180px]] || ''Olyfavnt'' [[tartan]], as published in 1842 in ''[[Vestiarium Scoticum]]''.\n|}\n\n==Castles and clan seat==\n\n*[[Kellie Castle]] was built and owned by Oliphants from 1360 to 1613.\n*[[Castle of Old Wick|Old Wick Castle]] and Berriedale Castle, held by [[Clan Sutherland]] in the 15th century, came to Sir William Oliphant of Berriedale (the progenitor of the Oliphant's of Berriedale) second son of the second Lord Oliphant, by his marriage to Christian, the daughter and heiress of Alexander Sutherland of Duffus in 1497.\n*[[Hatton Castle, Angus|Hatton Castle]] was built in 1575 by Laurence, the 4th Lord Oliphant and replaced the previous nearby wooden fortalice of [[Balcraig Castle]].  Hatton Castle was restored in the 20th century.\n*Following the decline in the Oliphant fortunes and the loss of Aberdalgie by the main branch of the family, by the 19th century the estates of Gask in Perthshire, [[List of listed buildings in Forgandenny, Perth and Kinross|Condie]], Rossie also in Perthshire and Kinneddar were those most associated with the Oliphant Clan. Although the land at Gask was held by Oliphants from the mid 14th century and although no Castle was ever built there, it is the site of 'The Auld Hoose' in Carolina Oliphant's song.\n*There is no Clan Seat currently but [[Ardblair Castle]], near Blairgowrie in Perthshire is the seat of one of the Clan Chieftains, the Oliphant of Gask.  Ardblair contains the largest collection of Oliphant heirlooms and portraits today.\n\n==See also==\n*[[David Olifard]]\n*[[Laurence, 1st Lord Oliphant]]\n*[[Laurence Oliphant, 3rd Lord Oliphant]]\n*[[Lord Oliphant]]\n*[[Oliphant (disambiguation)]]\n*[[William Oliphant, Lord Newton]]\n*[[William Oliphant, Lord of Aberdalgie]]\n*[[Margaret Oliphant]]\n*[[Thomas Oliphant (musician and artist)]]\n*[[Laurence Oliphant (Scottish politician)|Laurence Oliphant, 8th of Condie]]\n*[[Anthony Oliphant|Sir Anthony Oliphant]]\n*[[Laurence Oliphant (author)]]\n*[[Laurence Oliphant (British Army officer)|Major General Sir Laurence James Oliphant]]\n*[[James Oliphant]]\n*[[Lancelot Oliphant|Sir Lancelot Oliphant]]\n*[[Laurence Oliphant (Jacobite)]]\n*[[Findo Gask]]\n*[[Rob Oliphant]]\n*[[Scottish clan]]\n*[[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to Belgium]]\n*[[Maha Nuge Gardens]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n<ref>{{cite book|last1=Oxenham Hewlett|first1=William|title=Notes on dignities in the peerage of Scotland which are dormant or which have been forfeited|date=1882|publisher=Wildy & Sons|location=London|isbn=1342403894|edition=First|url=https://archive.org/details/notesondignities00hewluoft|accessdate=16 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.clanoliphant.com/ Oliphant Clan and Family Association]\n*[http://www.scotclans.com/scottish-clans/clan-oliphant/ Clan Oliphant at ScotClans.com]\n*[http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/ntor/oliphan2.html http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/ntor/oliphan2.html]\n*[http://www.scotweb.co.uk/info/oliphant/]\n*[[John Riddell (genealogist)|John Riddell]], [https://archive.org/details/inquiryintolawa00riddgoog ''Inquiry into the law and practice in Scottish peerages: before, and after the union; involving the questions of jurisdiction, and forfeiture: together with an exposition of our genuine, original consistorial law'', pub.

He was a son of Tasciovanus and succeeded his father in the early first century, reigning until c. 40 CE. His first capital was Verulamium (St Albans) but he subsequently moved it to Colchester. Though his power base was the Catuvellauni and the Trinovantes, his influence extended over a wide area, and his coins, of high quality, are found in north-east Kent, north Berkshire, Bedfordshire and in Cambridgeshire. Most of them carry on the obverse an ear of corn. Geoffrey de Monmouth, not the most reliable of sources, claimed that he was brought up by Augustus Caesar and Suetonius called him \u2018Rex Brittonorum\u2019. He seems to have been assertive in Britain but took care not to antagonise the Romans. A quarrel with his son Adminus, however, may have given the emperor Claudius the pretext for an expedition, which arrived in 43 AD, afrer Cunobelinus\u2019s death.In Shakespeare\u2019s Cymbeline the historical background, borrowed mainlyfrom Holinshed, is sketched in lightly.

He was a son of Tasciovanus and succeeded his father in the early first century, reigning until c. 40 CE. His first capital was Verulamium (St Albans) but he subsequently moved it to Colchester. Though his power base ws the Catuvellauni and the Trinovantes, his influence extended over a wide area, and his coins, of high quality, are found in north-east Kent, north Berkshire, Bedfordshire and in Cambridgeshire. Most of them carry on the obverse an ear of corn. Geoffrey de Monmouth, not the most reliable of sources, claimed that he was brought up by Augustus Caesar and Suetonius called him \u2018Rex Brittonorum\u2019. He seems to have been assertive in Britain but took care not to antagonise the Romans. A quarrel with his son Adminus, however, may have given the emperor Claudius the pretext for an expedition, which arrived in 43 AD, afrer Cunobelinus\u2019s death.In Shakespeare\u2019s Cymbeline the historical background, borrowed mainlyfrom Holinshed, is sketched in lightly.

In such cases, the clinical course of the disease is more severe, and these people have higher [[viremia]] compared with those in whom ADE has not occurred. This explains the observation that while primary (first) infections cause mostly minor disease (dengue fever) in children, secondary infection (re-infection at a later date) is more likely to be associated with dengue hemorrhagic fever and/or dengue shock syndrome in both children and adults.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Guzman MG, Vazquez S | title = The complexity of antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection | journal = Viruses | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 2649\u201362 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21994635 | pmc = 3185591 | doi = 10.3390/v2122649 }}</ref>\n\nThere are four [[antigen]]ically different [[serotype]]s of dengue virus (dengue virus 1\u20134).<ref name=King2002/> In 2013 a fifth serotype was reported.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Normile D | year = 2013 | title = Tropical medicine.

Infection with dengue virus also produces some degree of [[cross-reactivity|cross-protective]] immunity against the other three serotypes.<ref name=Alvarez2006/> Neutralizing heterotypic (cross-reactive) IgG antibodies are responsible for this cross-protective immunity, which typically persists for a period of several months to a few years. These heterotypic antibody [[titer]]s decrease over long time periods (4 to 20 years).<ref name=Guzman2007/> While heterotypic IgG antibody titers decrease, homotypic IgG antibody titers increase over long time periods. This could be due to the preferential survival of long-lived [[memory B cell]]s producing homotypic antibodies.<ref name=Guzman2007/>\n\nIn addition to inducing neutralizing heterotypic antibodies, infection with dengue virus can also induce heterotypic antibodies which neutralize the virus only partially or not at all.<ref name=Goncalvez2007/> The production of such cross-reactive but non-neutralizing antibodies could be the reason for more severe secondary infections. It is thought that by binding to but not neutralizing the virus, these antibodies cause it to behave as a \"[[Trojan Horse|trojan horse]]\",<ref name=Peluso1985/><ref name=Chen2002/><ref name=Witayathawornwong2005/> where it is delivered into the wrong compartment of [[dendritic cell]]s that have ingested the virus for destruction.<ref name=Rodenhuis2010/><ref name=Guzman2010/> Once inside the white blood cell, the virus replicates undetected, eventually generating very high virus titers which cause severe disease.<ref name=Dejnirattisai2010/>\n\nA study conducted by Modhiran et al.<ref name=Modhiran2010/> attempted to explain how non-neutralizing antibodies down regulate the immune response in the host cell through the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Toll-like receptors are known to recognize extra- and intracellular viral particles and to be a major basis of the cytokines production. In vitro experiments showed that the inflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferon production was reduced when the ADE-dengue virus complex bound to the Fc receptor of THP-1 cells. This can be explained by both a decrease of Toll-like receptorproduction and a modification of its signaling pathway. On one hand, an unknown protein induced by the stimulated Fc receptor reduces the Toll-like receptor transcription and translation, which reduce the capacity of the cell to detect viral proteins. On the other hand, many proteins (TRIF, TRAF6, TRAM, TIRAP, IKK\u03b1, TAB1, TAB2, NF-\u03baB complex) involved in the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway are down regulated, which led to a decrease of the cytokine production. Two of them, TRIF and TRAF6, are respectively down regulated by 2 proteins SARM and TANK up regulated by the stimulated Fc receptors.\n\nTo illustrate the phenomenon of ADE, consider the following example: an epidemic of dengue fever occurred in [[Cuba]], lasting from 1977 to 1979. The infecting serotype was dengue virus-1. This epidemic was followed by two more outbreaks of dengue fever\u2014one in 1981 and one in 1997; dengue virus-2 was the infecting serotype in both of these later epidemics. 205 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome occurred during the 1997 outbreak, all in people older than 15 years. All but three of these cases were demonstrated to have been previously infected by the dengue virus-1 serotype during the epidemic of 1977\u20131979.<ref name=Guzman2000/> Furthermore, people who had been infected with dengue virus-1 during the 1977-79 outbreak and secondarily infected with dengue virus-2 in 1997 had a 3-4 fold [[Odds ratio|increased probability]] of developing severe disease than those secondarily infected with dengue virus-2 in 1981.<ref name=Guzman2007/> This scenario can be explained by the presence of neutralizing heterotypic IgG antibodies in sufficient titers in 1981, the titers of which had decreased by 1997 to the point where they no longer provided significant cross-protective immunity.\n\n==In HIV-1 virus infection==\nADE of infection has also been reported in HIV. Like dengue virus, non-neutralizing level of antibodies have been found to enhance the viral infection through interactions of complement system and receptors.<ref name=Willey2001/> The increase in infection has been reported to be over 350 fold which is comparable to ADE in other viruses like dengue virus.<ref name=Willey2001/> ADE in HIV can be complement mediated or Fc receptor mediated. Complements in presence of HIV-1 positive sera have been found to enhance the infection of MT-2 T-cell line. The Fc-receptor mediated enhancement was reported when HIV infection was enhanced by sera from HIV-1 positive guinea pig enhanced the infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells without the presence of any complements.<ref name=Levy2007/> Complement component receptors CR2, CR3 and CR4 have been found to mediate this Complement-mediated enhancement of infection.<ref name=Willey2001/><ref name=Yu2010/> The infection of HIV-1 leads to activation of complements fragments of these complements can assist viruses with infection by facilitating viral interactions with host cells that express complement receptors.<ref name=Gras1991/> The deposition of complement on the virus brings the gp120 protein close to CD4 molecules on the surface of the cells, thus leading to facilitated viral entry.<ref name=Gras1991/> Viruses pre-exposed to non-neutralizing complement system have also been found to enhance infections in interdigitating dendritic cells. [[Opsonin|Opsonized]] viruses have not only shown enhanced entry but also favorable signalling cascades for HIV replication in interdigitating dendritic cells.<ref name=Bouhlal2007/> HIV-1 has also showed enhancement of infection in HT-29 cells when the viruses were pre-opsonized with complements C3 and C9 in seminal fluid. This enhanced rate of infection was almost 2 times greater than infection of HT-29 cells with virus alone.<ref name=Bouhlal2002/> Subramanian ''et al.'', reported that almost 72% of serum samples out of 39 HIV positive individuals contained complements that were known to enhance the infection. They also suggested that presence of neutralizing antibody or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity-mediating antibodies in the serum contains infection-enhancing antibodies.<ref name=Subramanian2002/> The balance between the neutralizing antibodies and infection-enhancing antibodies changes as the disease progresses. During advanced stages of disease the proportion of infection-enhancing antibodies are generally higher than neutralizing antibodies.<ref name=Beck2008/> Increase in viral protein synthesis and RNA production have been reported to occur during the complement mediated enhancement of infection. Cells that are challenged with non neutralizing levels of complements have been found have accelerated release of reverse transcriptase and the viral progeny.<ref name=Robinson1990/> The interaction of anti-HIV antibodies with non-neutralizing complement exposed viruses also aid in binding of the virus and the erythrocytes which can lead to a more efficient delivery of viruses to the immune compromised organs.<ref name=Yu2010/>\n\nADE in HIV has raised questions about the risk of infections to volunteers who have taken subneutralizing levels of vaccine just like any other viruses that exhibit ADE. Gilbert ''et al.'', in 2005 reported that there was no ADE of infection when they used rgp120 vaccine in phase 1 and 2 trials.<ref name=Gilbert2005/> It has been emphasized that much research needs to be done in the field of immunity response to HIV-1, information from these studies can be used to produce a more effective vaccine.\n\n==Mechanism==\nThere are several possibilities to explain the phenomenon:\n# A viral surface protein laced with antibodies against a virus of one serotype binds to a similar virus with a different serotype. The binding is meant to neutralize the virus surface protein from attaching to the cell, but the antibody bound to virus also binds to the receptor of the cell, the Fc-region antibody receptor Fc\u03b3R. This brings the virus into close proximity to the virus-specific receptor, and the cell [[endocytosis|internalizes]] the virus through the normal infection route.<ref name=TakadaKawaoka2003/>\n# A virus surface protein may be attached to antibodies of a different serotype, activating the classical pathway of the [[complement system]]. The complement cascade system instead binds [[C1Q complex]] attached to the virus surface protein via the antibodies, which in turn bind C1q receptor found on cells, bringing the virus and the cell close enough for a specific virus receptor to bind the virus, beginning infection.{{citation needed|date=July 2008}} This mechanism has not been shown specifically for dengue virus infection, but is supposed to occur with Ebola virus infection ''in vitro''.<ref name=TakadaFeldmann2003/>\n# When an antibody to a virus is present for a different serotype, it is unable to neutralize the virus, which is then ingested into the cell as a sub-neutralized virus particle. These viruses are [[phagocytosis|phagocytosed]] as antigen-antibody complexes, and degraded by [[macrophage]]s. Upon ingestion the antibodies no longer even sub-neutralize the body due to the denaturing condition at the step for acidification of phagosome before fusion with [[lysosome]].{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} The virus becomes active and begins its proliferation within the cell.{{citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Original antigenic sin]]\n* Other ways in which antibodies can

Infection with dengue virus also produces some degree of [[cross-reactivity|cross-protective]] immunity against the other three serotypes.<ref name=Alvarez2006/> Neutralizing heterotypic (cross-reactive) IgG antibodies are responsible for this cross-protective immunity, which typically persists for a period of several months to a few years. These heterotypic antibody [[titer]]s decrease over long time periods (4 to 20 years).<ref name=Guzman2007/> While heterotypic IgG antibody titers decrease, homotypic IgG antibody titers increase over long time periods. This could be due to the preferential survival of long-lived [[memory B cell]]s producing homotypic antibodies.<ref name=Guzman2007/>\n\nIn addition to inducing neutralizing heterotypic antibodies, infection with dengue virus can also induce heterotypic antibodies which neutralize the virus only partially or not at all.<ref name=Goncalvez2007/> The production of such cross-reactive but non-neutralizing antibodies could be the reason for more severe secondary infections. It is thought that by binding to but not neutralizing the virus, these antibodies cause it to behave as a \"[[Trojan Horse|trojan horse]]\",<ref name=Peluso1985/><ref name=Chen2002/><ref name=Witayathawornwong2005/> where it is delivered into the wrong compartment of [[dendritic cell]]s that have ingested the virus for destruction.<ref name=Rodenhuis2010/><ref name=Guzman2010/> Once inside the white blood cell, the virus replicates undetected, eventually generating very high virus titers which cause severe disease.<ref name=Dejnirattisai2010/>\n\nA study conducted by Modhiran et al.<ref name=Modhiran2010/> attempted to explain how non-neutralizing antibodies down regulate the immune response in the host cell through the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Toll-like receptors are known to recognize extra- and intracellular viral particles and to be a major basis of the cytokines production. In vitro experiments showed that the inflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferon production was reduced when the ADE-dengue virus complex bound to the Fc receptor of THP-1 cells. This can be explained by both a decrease of Toll-like receptorproduction and a modification of its signaling pathway. On one hand, an unknown protein induced by the stimulated Fc receptor reduces the Toll-like receptor transcription and translation, which reduce the capacity of the cell to detect viral proteins. On the other hand, many proteins (TRIF, TRAF6, TRAM, TIRAP, IKK\u03b1, TAB1, TAB2, NF-\u03baB complex) involved in the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway are down regulated, which led to a decrease of the cytokine production. Two of them, TRIF and TRAF6, are respectively down regulated by 2 proteins SARM and TANK up regulated by the stimulated Fc receptors.\n\nTo illustrate the phenomenon of ADE, consider the following example: an epidemic of dengue fever occurred in [[Cuba]], lasting from 1977 to 1979. The infecting serotype was dengue virus-1. This epidemic was followed by two more outbreaks of dengue fever\u2014one in 1981 and one in 1997; dengue virus-2 was the infecting serotype in both of these later epidemics. 205 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome occurred during the 1997 outbreak, all in people older than 15 years. All but three of these cases were demonstrated to have been previously infected by the dengue virus-1 serotype during the epidemic of 1977\u20131979.<ref name=Guzman2000/> Furthermore, people who had been infected with dengue virus-1 during the 1977-79 outbreak and secondarily infected with dengue virus-2 in 1997 had a 3-4 fold [[Odds ratio|increased probability]] of developing severe disease than those secondarily infected with dengue virus-2 in 1981.<ref name=Guzman2007/> This scenario can be explained by the presence of neutralizing heterotypic IgG antibodies in sufficient titers in 1981, the titers of which had decreased by 1997 to the point where they no longer provided significant cross-protective immunity.\n\n==In HIV-1 virus infection==\nADE of infection has also been reported in HIV. Like dengue virus, non-neutralizing level of antibodies have been found to enhance the viral infection through interactions of complement system and receptors.<ref name=Willey2001/> The increase in infection has been reported to be over 350 fold which is comparable to ADE in other viruses like dengue virus.<ref name=Willey2001/> ADE in HIV can be complement mediated or Fc receptor mediated. Complements in presence of HIV-1 positive sera have been found to enhance the infection of MT-2 T-cell line. The Fc-receptor mediated enhancement was reported when HIV infection was enhanced by sera from HIV-1 positive guinea pig enhanced the infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells without the presence of any complements.<ref name=Levy2007/> Complement component receptors CR2, CR3 and CR4 have been found to mediate this Complement-mediated enhancement of infection.<ref name=Willey2001/><ref name=Yu2010/> The infection of HIV-1 leads to activation of complements fragments of these complements can assist viruses with infection by facilitating viral interactions with host cells that express complement receptors.<ref name=Gras1991/> The deposition of complement on the virus brings the gp120 protein close to CD4 molecules on the surface of the cells, thus leading to facilitated viral entry.<ref name=Gras1991/> Viruses pre-exposed to non-neutralizing complement system have also been found to enhance infections in interdigitating dendritic cells. [[Opsonin|Opsonized]] viruses have not only shown enhanced entry but also favorable signalling cascades for HIV replication in interdigitating dendritic cells.<ref name=Bouhlal2007/> HIV-1 has also showed enhancement of infection in HT-29 cells when the viruses were pre-opsonized with complements C3 and C9 in seminal fluid. This enhanced rate of infection was almost 2 times greater than infection of HT-29 cells with virus alone.<ref name=Bouhlal2002/> Subramanian ''et al.'', reported that almost 72% of serum samples out of 39 HIV positive individuals contained complements that were known to enhance the infection. They also suggested that presence of neutralizing antibody or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity-mediating antibodies in the serum contains infection-enhancing antibodies.<ref name=Subramanian2002/> The balance between the neutralizing antibodies and infection-enhancing antibodies changes as the disease progresses. During advanced stages of disease the proportion of infection-enhancing antibodies are generally higher than neutralizing antibodies.<ref name=Beck2008/> Increase in viral protein synthesis and RNA production have been reported to occur during the complement mediated enhancement of infection. Cells that are challenged with non neutralizing levels of complements have been found have accelerated release of reverse transcriptase and the viral progeny.<ref name=Robinson1990/> The interaction of anti-HIV antibodies with non-neutralizing complement exposed viruses also aid in binding of the virus and the erythrocytes which can lead to a more efficient delivery of viruses to the immune compromised organs.<ref name=Yu2010/>\n\nADE in HIV has raised questions about the risk of infections to volunteers who have taken subneutralizing levels of vaccine just like any other viruses that exhibit ADE. Gilbert ''et al.'', in 2005 reported that there was no ADE of infection when they used rgp120 vaccine in phase 1 and 2 trials.<ref name=Gilbert2005/> It has been emphasized that much research needs to be done in the field of immunity response to HIV-1, information from these studies can be used to produce a more effective vaccine.\n\n==Mechanism==\nThere are several possibilities to explain the phenomenon:\n# A viral surface protein laced with antibodies against a virus of one serotype binds to a similar virus with a different serotype. The binding is meant to neutralize the virus surface protein from attaching to the cell, but the antibody bound to virus also binds to the receptor of the cell, the Fc-region antibody receptor Fc\u03b3R. This brings the virus into close proximity to the virus-specific receptor, and the cell [[endocytosis|internalizes]] the virus through the normal infection route.<ref name=TakadaKawaoka2003/>\n# A virus surface protein may be attached to antibodies of a different serotype, activating the classical pathway of the [[complement system]]. The complement cascade system instead binds [[C1Q complex]] attached to the virus surface protein via the antibodies, which in turn bind C1q receptor found on cells, bringing the virus and the cell close enough for a specific virus receptor to bind the virus, beginning infection.{{citation needed|date=July 2008}} This mechanism has not been shown specifically for dengue virus infection, but is supposed to occur with Ebola virus infection ''in vitro''.<ref name=TakadaFeldmann2003/>\n# When an antibody to a virus is present for a different serotype, it is unable to neutralize the virus, which is then ingested into the cell as a sub-neutralized virus particle. These viruses are [[phagocytosis|phagocytosed]] as antigen-antibody complexes, and degraded by [[macrophage]]s. Upon ingestion the antibodies no longer even sub-neutralize the body due to the denaturing condition at the step for acidification of phagosome before fusion with [[lysosome]].{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} The virus becomes active and begins its proliferation within the cell.{{citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Original antigenic sin]]\n* Other ways in which antibodies can
