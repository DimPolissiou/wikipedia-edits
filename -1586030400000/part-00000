Secondly, the railway, opened from Manchester to Liverpool in 1830, was linked to a line from London and Birmingham in 1839 enabling rail transport to the Liverpool area from large parts of the country for the first time.

In 1973, eight years after Mrs. [[Mirabel Topham]] announced she was seeking a buyer, the racecourse was finally sold to property developer Bill Davies. Davies tripled the admission prices, and consequently, the attendance at the [[1975 Grand National|1975 race]], won by [[L'Escargot (horse)|L'Escargot]], was the smallest in living memory. It was after this that bookmaker [[Ladbrokes]] made an offer, signing an agreement with Davies allowing them to manage the Grand National.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aintree-grand-national.net/grand-national-history.php|title=Aintree Liverpool Grand National History|website=Aintree Grand National|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615001951/http://www.aintree-grand-national.net/grand-national-history.php|archivedate=15 June 2011|accessdate=10 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = '''They're willing him home now!

A false start was declared, but due to a lack of communication between course officials, 30 of the 39 jockeys did not realise this and began the race.\n\nCourse officials tried to stop the runners by waving red flags, but many jockeys continued to race, believing that they were protesters (a group of whom had invaded the course earlier), while [[Peter Scudamore]] only stopped because he saw his trainer, [[Martin Pipe]], waving frantically at him.\n\nSeven horses completed the course, meaning the result was void.

The runners started at a lane on the edge of the racecourse and raced away from the course out over open countryside towards the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]]. The gates, hedges and ditches that they met along the way were flagged to provide them with the obstacles to be jumped along the way with posts and rails erected at the two points where the runners jumped a brook. The runners returned towards the racecourse by running along the edge of the canal before re-entering the course at the opposite end. The runners then ran the length of the racecourse before embarking on a second circuit before finishing in front of the stands. The majority of the race therefore took place not on the actual Aintree Racecourse but instead in the adjoining countryside. That countryside was incorporated into the modern course but commentators still often refer to it as \"the country\".{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Fences===\nThere are 16 fences on the National Course topped with spruce from the [[Lake District]].

It is said that Becher later reflected: \"Water tastes disgusting without the benefits of whisky.\" It was bypassed in 2011 along with fence 20, after an equine casualty and again in 2018 after a jockey was attended by doctors, both occurring on the final lap.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/14/tiger-roll-holds-on-to-win-dramatic-grand-national-photo-finish-davy-russell-horse-racing|title=Tiger Roll holds on to win dramatic Grand National in photo-finish|first=Greg|last=Wood|date=14 April 2018|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=17 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416220721/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/14/tiger-roll-holds-on-to-win-dramatic-grand-national-photo-finish-davy-russell-horse-racing|archivedate=16 April 2018}}</ref>.\n;Fence 7 & 23 \u2013 [[Foinavon]]\nHeight: {{convert|4|ft|6|in|m}}<br />\nOne of the smallest on the course, it was named in 1984 after the [[1967 Grand National|1967]] winner who avoided a m\u00eal\u00e9e at the fence to go on and win the race at outside odds of 100/1.\n;Fence 8 & 24 \u2013 [[Canal Turn]]\nHeight: {{convert|5|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}<br/>\nNoted for its sharp 90-degree left turn immediately after landing. Before the [[World War I|First World War]] it was not uncommon for loose horses to continue straight ahead after the jump and end up in the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] itself. There was once a ditch before the fence but this was filled in after a m\u00eal\u00e9e in the [[1928 Grand National|1928 race]]. It was bypassed for the first time in 2015 on the final lap as vets arrived to treat a horse who fell on the first lap.\n;Fence 9 & 25 \u2013 Valentine's\nHeight: {{convert|5|ft|m|2}} with a {{convert|5|ft|6|in|m}} brook<br />\nThe fence was originally known as the Second Brook but was renamed after a horse named Valentine was reputed to have jumped the fence hind legs first in [[1840 Grand National|1840]]. A grandstand was erected alongside the fence in the early part of the 20th century but fell into decline after the [[World War II|Second World War]] and was torn down in the 1970s.\n;Fence 10 & 26\nHeight: {{convert|5|ft|m|2}}<br />\nA plain obstacle that leads the runners alongside the canal towards two ditches.\n;Fence 11 & 27 \u2013 open ditch\nHeight: {{convert|5|ft|m|2}}, with a {{convert|6|ft|m|2}} ditch on the takeoff side\n;Fence 12 & 28 \u2013 ditch\nHeight: {{convert|5|ft|m|2}}, with a {{convert|5|ft|6|in|m}} ditch on the landing side\n\nThe runners then cross the Melling Road near to the Anchor Bridge, a popular vantage point since the earliest days of the race. This also marks the point where the runners are said to be re-entering the \"racecourse proper\". In the early days of the race it is thought there was an obstacle near this point known as the Table Jump, which may have resembled a bank similar to those still seen at [[Punchestown]] in Ireland. In the 1840s the Melling Road was also flanked by hedges and the runners had to jump into the road and then back out of it.\n\n;Fence 13 & 29\nHeight: {{convert|4|ft|7|in|m}}<br />\nA plain obstacle that comes at a point when the runners are usually in a good rhythm and thus rarely causes problems.\n;Fence 14 & 30\nHeight: {{convert|4|ft|6|in|m}}<br />\nThe last fence on the final lap and which has often seen very tired horses fall. Despite some tired runners falling at the 30th and appearing injured, no horse deaths have occurred at the 30th fence to date.\n\nOn the first lap of the race, runners continue around the course to negotiate two fences which are only jumped once:\n\n;Fence 15 \u2013 [[The Chair (Aintree Racecourse)|The Chair]]\nHeight: {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}}, preceded by a 6&nbsp;ft (1.83 m) wide ditch<br />\nThis fence is the site of the accident that claimed the only human life in the National's history: in 1862, Joe Wynne fell here and died from his injuries, although a coroner's inquest revealed that the rider was in a gravely weakened condition through [[tuberculosis|consumption]].<ref>''Liverpool Daily Post'' 15 March 1862</ref> This brought about the ditch on the take-off side of the fence in an effort to slow the horses on approach. The fence was the location where a distance judge sat in the earliest days of the race. On the second circuit he would record the finishing order from his position and declare any horse that had not passed him before the previous runner passed the finishing post as \"distanced\", meaning a non-finisher. The practice was done away with in the 1850s, but the monument where the chair stood is still there. The ground on the landing side is six inches higher than on the takeoff side, creating the opposite effect to the drop at Becher's. The fence was originally known as the Monument Jump, but \"The Chair\" came into more frequent use in the 1930s. Today it is one of the most popular jumps on the course for spectators.\n\n;Fence 16 \u2013 Water Jump\nHeight: {{convert|2|ft|6|in|m}}<br />\nOriginally a stone wall in the very early Nationals. The Water Jump was one of the most popular jumps on the course, presenting a great jumping spectacle for those in the stands and was always a major feature in the [[newsreel]]s' coverage of the race. As the newsreels made way for television in the 1960s, so in turn did the Water Jump fall under the shadow of its neighbour, The Chair, in popularity as an obstacle.\n\nOn the final lap, after the 30th fence the remaining runners bear right, avoiding The Chair and Water Jump, to head onto a \"run-in\" to the finishing post. The run-in is not perfectly straight: an \"elbow\" requires jockeys to make a slight right before finding themselves truly on the home straight. It is on this run-in \u2014 one of the longest in the United Kingdom at {{convert|494|yd|m}}\u2014 that many potential winners have had victory snatched away, such as [[Devon Loch]] in [[1956 Grand National|1956]], [[Crisp (horse)|Crisp]] in [[1973 Grand National|1973]], [[What's Up Boys]] in [[2002 Grand National|2002]] and Sunnyhillboy in [[2012 Grand National|2012]].\n\n==Records==\n'''Leading horse:'''\n* [[Red Rum]] \u2013 3 wins ([[1973 Grand National|1973]], [[1974 Grand National|1974]], [[1977 Grand National|1977]])<ref name=nostalgia/>\n----\n'''Leading [[jockey]]:'''\n* [[George Stevens (jockey)|George Stevens]] \u2013 5 wins (Freetrader, [[1856 Grand National|1856]];

Throughout the [[Victorian era]] the line between the amateur and professional sportsman existed only in terms of the rider's status, and the engagement of an amateur to ride in the race was rarely considered a handicap to a contender's chances of winning. Many gentleman riders won the race prior to the First World War.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120805064025/http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a762417002] </ref>\n\nAlthough the number of amateurs remained high between the wars their ability to match their professional counterparts gradually receded. After the Second World War it became rare for any more than four or five amateurs to take part in any given year. The last amateur rider to win the race is [[Marcus Armytage]], who set the still-standing course record of 8:47.80, when winning on Mr Frisk in [[1990 Grand National|1990]]. By the 21st century however, openings for amateur riders had become very rare with some years passing with no amateur riders at all taking part. Those that do in the modern era are most usually talented young riders who are often close to turning professional. In the past, such amateur riders would have been joined by army officers, such as [[David Campbell (British Army officer)|David Campbell]] who won in 1896, and sporting aristocrats, farmers or local huntsmen and point to point riders, who usually opted to ride their own mounts. But all these genres of rider have faded out in the last quarter of a century with no riders of military rank or aristocratic title having taken a mount since 1982.\n\nThe [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]] made it possible for female jockeys to enter the race. The first female jockey to enter the race was [[Charlotte Brew]] on the 200/1 outsider Barony Fort in the [[1977 Grand National|1977]] race.<ref>{{cite web|title=GRAND NATIONAL WOMEN|url=http://m.grand-national-guide.co.uk/history_grand_national_women.html|publisher=Grand National Guide|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref> The first female jockey to complete the race was Geraldine Rees on Cheers in [[1982 Grand National|1982]]. The 21st century has not seen a significant increase in female riders but it has seen them gain rides on mounts considered to have a genuine chance of winning. In [[2005 Grand National|2005]], Carrie Ford finished fifth on the 8/1 second-favourite Forest Gunner. In 2012, [[Katie Walsh (jockey)|Katie Walsh]] achieved the best result yet for a female jockey, finishing third on the 8/1 joint-favourite Seabass. In [[2015 Grand National|2015]], [[Nina Carberry]] became the first female jockey to take a fifth ride in the Grand National, her best placing being seventh in [[2010 Grand National|2010]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grand-national.com/grand-national/grand-national-lady-jockey-female-jockey-women/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918192339/http://www.grand-national.com/grand-national/grand-national-lady-jockey-female-jockey-women/ |archivedate=18 September 2011  }} </ref>\n\nProfessionals now hold dominance in the Grand National and better training, dietary habits and protective clothing has ensured that riders' careers last much longer and offer more opportunities to ride in the race. Of the 34 riders who have enjoyed 13 or more rides in the race, 19 had their first ride in the 20th century and 11 had careers that continued into or started in the 21st century.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Despite that, a long-standing record of 19 rides in the race was set by [[Tom Olliver]] back in 1859 and was not equalled until 2014 by [[A.

In 2008, a new veterinary surgery was constructed in the stable yard which has two large treatment boxes, an X-ray unit, video endoscopy, equine solarium, and sandpit facilities. Further changes in set-up and procedure allow vets to treat horses more rapidly and in better surroundings. Those requiring more specialist care can be transported by specialist horse ambulances, under police escort, to the nearby Philip Leverhulme Equine Hospital at the [[University of Liverpool School of Veterinary Science|University of Liverpool at Leahurst]]. A mobile on-course X-ray machine assists in the prompt diagnosis of leg injuries when horses are pulled up, and oxygen and water are available by the final fence and finishing post.<ref name=horsewelfare>[http://www.aintree.co.uk/pages/horse-welfare/ Horse Welfare] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414054040/http://www.aintree.co.uk/pages/horse-welfare/ |date=14 April 2012 }}.

Additional vets are stationed at the pull-up area, finishing post, and in the surgery.<ref name=telegraphwelfare/>\n\nSome of the National's most challenging fences have also been modified, while still preserving them as formidable obstacles. After the [[1989 Grand National]], in which two horses died in incidents at [[Becher's Brook]], Aintree began the most significant of its modifications to the course. The brook on the landing side of Becher's was filled in and, after the 2011 race which also saw an equine fatality at the obstacle, the incline on the landing side was levelled out and the drop on was reduced by between 4 and 5 inches (10\u201313&nbsp;cm) to slow the runners. Other fences have also been reduced in height over the years, and the entry requirements for the race have been made stricter. Screening at the [[Canal Turn]] now prevents horses being able to see the sharp left turn and encourages jockeys to spread out along the fence, rather than take the tight left-side route. Additionally, work has been carried out to smooth the core post infrastructure of the fences with protective padding to reduce impact upon contact,<ref name=horsewelfare/> and the height of the toe-boards on all fences has been increased to {{convert|14|in|cm}}. These orange-coloured boards are positioned at the base of each fence and provide a clear ground line to assist horses in determining the base of the fence.\n\nParts of the course were widened in 2009 to allow runners to bypass fences if required. This was utilised for the first time during the 2011 race as casualties at fences 4 and 6 (Becher's Brook) resulted in marshals diverting the remaining contenders around those fences on the final lap.\n\nWelfare groups have suggested a reduction in the size of the field (currently limited to a maximum of 40 horses) should be implemented. Opponents point to previous unhappy experience with smaller fields such as only 29 runners at the [[1954 Grand National]], only 31 runners in [[1975 Grand National|1975]], and a fatality each at the [[1996 Grand National|1996]] and [[1999 Grand National|1999 National]]s despite smaller fields, and the possible ramifications in relation to the speed of such races in addition to recent course modifications (part of the \"speed kills\" argument).\n\nSome within the horseracing community, including those with notable achievements in the Grand National such as [[Ginger McCain]] and [[Bob Champion]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/horse_racing/9453497.stm |title=BBC Sport - Horse Racing - Grand National: Ginger McCain queries smaller fences |work=BBC News |date=10 April 2011 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/16209064 |title=Grand National: Neptune Collonge Honoured After Horses Die Following Aintree Race &#124; UK News &#124; Sky News |publisher=News.sky.com |accessdate=23 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419080107/http://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/16209064 |archivedate=19 April 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/horse-racing/17735723 |title=BBC Sport - According to Pete trainer wants bigger Grand National fences |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=16 April 2012 |accessdate=23 April 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420045140/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/horse-racing/17735723 |archivedate=20 April 2012  }}</ref> have argued that the lowering of fences and the narrowing of ditches, primarily designed to increase horse safety, has had the adverse effect by encouraging the runners to race faster. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Grand National saw a total of 12 horses die (half of which were at Becher's Brook); in the next 20-year period from 1990 to 2010, when modifications to the course were most significant, there were 17 equine fatalities. The [[2011 Grand National|2011]] and [[2012 Grand National|2012 race]]s each yielded two deaths, including one each at Becher's Brook.  In 2013, when further changes were made to introduce a more flexible fence structure, there were no fatalities in the race itself although two horses died in run-up races over the same course.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dawes |first=Mike |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/racing/article-2304605/Little-Josh-dies-Grand-National-meeting-day-one.html |title=Little Josh dies on Grand National meeting day one |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=5 April 2013 |accessdate=8 April 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140408140545/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/racing/article-2304605/Little-Josh-dies-Grand-National-meeting-day-one.html |archivedate=8 April 2014  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/horseracing/grand-national/9974805/Grand-National-2013-Little-Josh-becomes-second-horse-to-die-over-the-big-Aintree-fences.html|title=Grand National 2013: Little Josh becomes second horse to die over the big Aintree fences|newspaper=Telegraph|accessdate=8 April 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515064624/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/horseracing/grand-national/9974805/Grand-National-2013-Little-Josh-becomes-second-horse-to-die-over-the-big-Aintree-fences.html|archivedate=15 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"league1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.league.org.uk/news-and-opinion/press-releases/2014/apr/injury-and-fatalities-are-inevitable-during-grand-national-meet |title=Charity warns that until horse welfare is put first, injury and fatalities are inevitable during Grand National meet - League Against Cruel Sports |publisher=League.org.uk |date=3 April 2014 |accessdate=8 April 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408212451/http://www.league.org.uk/news-and-opinion/press-releases/2014/apr/injury-and-fatalities-are-inevitable-during-grand-national-meet |archivedate=8 April 2014  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/horse-racing/26128471 |title=BBC Sport - Grand National 2014: Tidal Bay tops Aintree weights |work=BBC News |date=11 February 2014 |accessdate=11 February 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305160408/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/horse-racing/26128471 |archivedate=5 March 2014  }}</ref> The animal welfare charity [[League Against Cruel Sports]] counts the number of horse deaths over the three-day meeting from the year 2000 to 2013 at 40.<ref name=\"league1\"/> There were no equine fatalities in the main Grand National race for seven years until 2019,<ref>{{cite web |title=The 2014 Grand National |url=https://www.animalaid.org.uk/2014-grand-national/ |website=Animal Aid |accessdate=5 August 2018 |date=5 April 2014}}</ref> when one horse died at the first fence.<ref>{{cite web |title=Grand National 2019: Willie Mullins' Up For Review dies after falling at first hurdle|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/racing/grand-national-2019-result-horse-dies-up-for-review-fall-first-hurdle-aintree-a8858181.html%3famp |website=The Independent |date=6 April 2019 |accessdate=6 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Grand National Legends==\nIn 2009, the race sponsors John Smith's launched a poll to determine five personalities to be inducted into the inaugural ''Grand National Legends'' initiative.<ref name=\"GN Legends\">{{cite web|title=Grand National Legends through History {{!}} GrandNational.Org.UK|url=https://www.grandnational.org.uk/legends.php|website=Grandnational.org.uk|accessdate=24 March 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180324102442/https://www.grandnational.org.uk/legends.php|archivedate=24 March 2018}}</ref> The winners were announced on the day of the [[2010 Grand National]] and inscribed on commemorative plaques at Aintree.

The runners started at a lane on the edge of the racecourse and raced away from the course out over open countryside towards the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]]. The gates, hedges and ditches that they met along the way were flagged to provide them with the obstacles to be jumped along the way with posts and rails erected at the two points where the runners jumped a brook. The runners returned towards the racecourse by running along the edge of the canal before re-entering the course at the opposite end. The runners then ran the length of the racecourse before embarking on a second circuit before finishing in front of the stands. The majority of the race therefore took place not on the actual Aintree Racecourse but instead in the adjoining countryside. That countryside was incorporated into the modern course but commentators still often refer to it as \"the country\".{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Fences===\nThere are 16 fences on the National Course topped with spruce from the [[Lake District]].

It is said that Becher later reflected: \"Water tastes disgusting without the benefits of whisky.\" It was bypassed in 2011 along with fence 20, after an equine casualty and again in 2018 after a jockey was attended by doctors, both occurring on the final lap.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/14/tiger-roll-holds-on-to-win-dramatic-grand-national-photo-finish-davy-russell-horse-racing|title=Tiger Roll holds on to win dramatic Grand National in photo-finish|first=Greg|last=Wood|date=14 April 2018|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=17 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416220721/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/apr/14/tiger-roll-holds-on-to-win-dramatic-grand-national-photo-finish-davy-russell-horse-racing|archivedate=16 April 2018}}</ref>.\n;Fence 7 & 23 \u2013 [[Foinavon]]\nHeight: {{convert|4|ft|6|in|m}}<br />\nOne of the smallest on the course, it was named in 1984 after the [[1967 Grand National|1967]] winner who avoided a m\u00eal\u00e9e at the fence to go on and win the race at outside odds of 100/1.\n;Fence 8 & 24 \u2013 [[Canal Turn]]\nHeight: {{convert|5|ft|m|2|abbr=on}}<br/>\nNoted for its sharp 90-degree left turn immediately after landing. Before the [[World War I|First World War]] it was not uncommon for loose horses to continue straight ahead after the jump and end up in the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] itself. There was once a ditch before the fence but this was filled in after a m\u00eal\u00e9e in the [[1928 Grand National|1928 race]]. It was bypassed for the first time in 2015 on the final lap as vets arrived to treat a horse who fell on the first lap.\n;Fence 9 & 25 \u2013 Valentine's\nHeight: {{convert|5|ft|m|2}} with a {{convert|5|ft|6|in|m}} brook<br />\nThe fence was originally known as the Second Brook but was renamed after a horse named Valentine was reputed to have jumped the fence hind legs first in [[1840 Grand National|1840]]. A grandstand was erected alongside the fence in the early part of the 20th century but fell into decline after the [[World War II|Second World War]] and was torn down in the 1970s.\n;Fence 10 & 26\nHeight: {{convert|5|ft|m|2}}<br />\nA plain obstacle that leads the runners alongside the canal towards two ditches.\n;Fence 11 & 27 \u2013 open ditch\nHeight: {{convert|5|ft|m|2}}, with a {{convert|6|ft|m|2}} ditch on the takeoff side\n;Fence 12 & 28 \u2013 ditch\nHeight: {{convert|5|ft|m|2}}, with a {{convert|5|ft|6|in|m}} ditch on the landing side\n\nThe runners then cross the Melling Road near to the Anchor Bridge, a popular vantage point since the earliest days of the race. This also marks the point where the runners are said to be re-entering the \"racecourse proper\". In the early days of the race it is thought there was an obstacle near this point known as the Table Jump, which may have resembled a bank similar to those still seen at [[Punchestown]] in Ireland. In the 1840s the Melling Road was also flanked by hedges and the runners had to jump into the road and then back out of it.\n\n;Fence 13 & 29\nHeight: {{convert|4|ft|7|in|m}}<br />\nA plain obstacle that comes at a point when the runners are usually in a good rhythm and thus rarely causes problems.\n;Fence 14 & 30\nHeight: {{convert|4|ft|6|in|m}}<br />\nThe last fence on the final lap and which has often seen very tired horses fall. Despite some tired runners falling at the 30th and appearing injured, no horse deaths have occurred at the 30th fence to date.\n\nOn the first lap of the race, runners continue around the course to negotiate two fences which are only jumped once:\n\n;Fence 15 \u2013 [[The Chair (Aintree Racecourse)|The Chair]]\nHeight: {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}}, preceded by a 6&nbsp;ft (1.83 m) wide ditch<br />\nThis fence is the site of the accident that claimed the only human life in the National's history: in 1862, Joe Wynne fell here and died from his injuries, although a coroner's inquest revealed that the rider was in a gravely weakened condition through [[tuberculosis|consumption]].<ref>''Liverpool Daily Post'' 15 March 1862</ref> This brought about the ditch on the take-off side of the fence in an effort to slow the horses on approach. The fence was the location where a distance judge sat in the earliest days of the race. On the second circuit he would record the finishing order from his position and declare any horse that had not passed him before the previous runner passed the finishing post as \"distanced\", meaning a non-finisher. The practice was done away with in the 1850s, but the monument where the chair stood is still there. The ground on the landing side is six inches higher than on the takeoff side, creating the opposite effect to the drop at Becher's. The fence was originally known as the Monument Jump, but \"The Chair\" came into more frequent use in the 1930s. Today it is one of the most popular jumps on the course for spectators.\n\n;Fence 16 \u2013 Water Jump\nHeight: {{convert|2|ft|6|in|m}}<br />\nOriginally a stone wall in the very early Nationals. The Water Jump was one of the most popular jumps on the course, presenting a great jumping spectacle for those in the stands and was always a major feature in the [[newsreel]]s' coverage of the race. As the newsreels made way for television in the 1960s, so in turn did the Water Jump fall under the shadow of its neighbour, The Chair, in popularity as an obstacle.\n\nOn the final lap, after the 30th fence the remaining runners bear right, avoiding The Chair and Water Jump, to head onto a \"run-in\" to the finishing post. The run-in is not perfectly straight: an \"elbow\" requires jockeys to make a slight right before finding themselves truly on the home straight. It is on this run-in \u2014 one of the longest in the United Kingdom at {{convert|494|yd|m}}\u2014 that many potential winners have had victory snatched away, such as [[Devon Loch]] in [[1956 Grand National|1956]], [[Crisp (horse)|Crisp]] in [[1973 Grand National|1973]], [[What's Up Boys]] in [[2002 Grand National|2002]] and Sunnyhillboy in [[2012 Grand National|2012]].\n\n==Records==\n'''Leading horse:'''\n* [[Red Rum]] \u2013 3 wins ([[1973 Grand National|1973]], [[1974 Grand National|1974]], [[1977 Grand National|1977]])<ref name=nostalgia/>\n----\n'''Leading [[jockey]]:'''\n* [[George Stevens (jockey)|George Stevens]] \u2013 5 wins (Freetrader, [[1856 Grand National|1856]];

Throughout the [[Victorian era]] the line between the amateur and professional sportsman existed only in terms of the rider's status, and the engagement of an amateur to ride in the race was rarely considered a handicap to a contender's chances of winning. Many gentleman riders won the race prior to the First World War.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120805064025/http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a762417002] </ref>\n\nAlthough the number of amateurs remained high between the wars their ability to match their professional counterparts gradually receded. After the Second World War it became rare for any more than four or five amateurs to take part in any given year. The last amateur rider to win the race is [[Marcus Armytage]], who set the still-standing course record of 8:47.80, when winning on Mr Frisk in [[1990 Grand National|1990]]. By the 21st century however, openings for amateur riders had become very rare with some years passing with no amateur riders at all taking part. Those that do in the modern era are most usually talented young riders who are often close to turning professional. In the past, such amateur riders would have been joined by army officers, such as [[David Campbell (British Army officer)|David Campbell]] who won in 1896, and sporting aristocrats, farmers or local huntsmen and point to point riders, who usually opted to ride their own mounts. But all these genres of rider have faded out in the last quarter of a century with no riders of military rank or aristocratic title having taken a mount since 1982.\n\nThe [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]] made it possible for female jockeys to enter the race. The first female jockey to enter the race was [[Charlotte Brew]] on the 200/1 outsider Barony Fort in the [[1977 Grand National|1977]] race.<ref>{{cite web|title=GRAND NATIONAL WOMEN|url=http://m.grand-national-guide.co.uk/history_grand_national_women.html|publisher=Grand National Guide|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref> The first female jockey to complete the race was Geraldine Rees on Cheers in [[1982 Grand National|1982]]. The 21st century has not seen a significant increase in female riders but it has seen them gain rides on mounts considered to have a genuine chance of winning. In [[2005 Grand National|2005]], Carrie Ford finished fifth on the 8/1 second-favourite Forest Gunner. In 2012, [[Katie Walsh (jockey)|Katie Walsh]] achieved the best result yet for a female jockey, finishing third on the 8/1 joint-favourite Seabass. In [[2015 Grand National|2015]], [[Nina Carberry]] became the first female jockey to take a fifth ride in the Grand National, her best placing being seventh in [[2010 Grand National|2010]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grand-national.com/grand-national/grand-national-lady-jockey-female-jockey-women/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918192339/http://www.grand-national.com/grand-national/grand-national-lady-jockey-female-jockey-women/ |archivedate=18 September 2011  }} </ref>\n\nProfessionals now hold dominance in the Grand National and better training, dietary habits and protective clothing has ensured that riders' careers last much longer and offer more opportunities to ride in the race. Of the 34 riders who have enjoyed 13 or more rides in the race, 19 had their first ride in the 20th century and 11 had careers that continued into or started in the 21st century.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Despite that, a long-standing record of 19 rides in the race was set by [[Tom Olliver]] back in 1859 and was not equalled until 2014 by [[A.

In 2008, a new veterinary surgery was constructed in the stable yard which has two large treatment boxes, an X-ray unit, video endoscopy, equine solarium, and sandpit facilities. Further changes in set-up and procedure allow vets to treat horses more rapidly and in better surroundings. Those requiring more specialist care can be transported by specialist horse ambulances, under police escort, to the nearby Philip Leverhulme Equine Hospital at the [[University of Liverpool School of Veterinary Science|University of Liverpool at Leahurst]]. A mobile on-course X-ray machine assists in the prompt diagnosis of leg injuries when horses are pulled up, and oxygen and water are available by the final fence and finishing post.<ref name=horsewelfare>[http://www.aintree.co.uk/pages/horse-welfare/ Horse Welfare] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414054040/http://www.aintree.co.uk/pages/horse-welfare/ |date=14 April 2012 }}.

Additional vets are stationed at the pull-up area, finishing post, and in the surgery.<ref name=telegraphwelfare/>\n\nSome of the National's most challenging fences have also been modified, while still preserving them as formidable obstacles. After the [[1989 Grand National]], in which two horses died in incidents at [[Becher's Brook]], Aintree began the most significant of its modifications to the course. The brook on the landing side of Becher's was filled in and, after the 2011 race which also saw an equine fatality at the obstacle, the incline on the landing side was levelled out and the drop on was reduced by between 4 and 5 inches (10\u201313&nbsp;cm) to slow the runners. Other fences have also been reduced in height over the years, and the entry requirements for the race have been made stricter. Screening at the [[Canal Turn]] now prevents horses being able to see the sharp left turn and encourages jockeys to spread out along the fence, rather than take the tight left-side route. Additionally, work has been carried out to smooth the core post infrastructure of the fences with protective padding to reduce impact upon contact,<ref name=horsewelfare/> and the height of the toe-boards on all fences has been increased to {{convert|14|in|cm}}. These orange-coloured boards are positioned at the base of each fence and provide a clear ground line to assist horses in determining the base of the fence.\n\nParts of the course were widened in 2009 to allow runners to bypass fences if required. This was utilised for the first time during the 2011 race as casualties at fences 4 and 6 (Becher's Brook) resulted in marshals diverting the remaining contenders around those fences on the final lap.\n\nWelfare groups have suggested a reduction in the size of the field (currently limited to a maximum of 40 horses) should be implemented. Opponents point to previous unhappy experience with smaller fields such as only 29 runners at the [[1954 Grand National]], only 31 runners in [[1975 Grand National|1975]], and a fatality each at the [[1996 Grand National|1996]] and [[1999 Grand National|1999 National]]s despite smaller fields, and the possible ramifications in relation to the speed of such races in addition to recent course modifications (part of the \"speed kills\" argument).\n\nSome within the horseracing community, including those with notable achievements in the Grand National such as [[Ginger McCain]] and [[Bob Champion]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/horse_racing/9453497.stm |title=BBC Sport - Horse Racing - Grand National: Ginger McCain queries smaller fences |work=BBC News |date=10 April 2011 |accessdate=23 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/16209064 |title=Grand National: Neptune Collonge Honoured After Horses Die Following Aintree Race &#124; UK News &#124; Sky News |publisher=News.sky.com |accessdate=23 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419080107/http://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/16209064 |archivedate=19 April 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/horse-racing/17735723 |title=BBC Sport - According to Pete trainer wants bigger Grand National fences |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=16 April 2012 |accessdate=23 April 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420045140/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/horse-racing/17735723 |archivedate=20 April 2012  }}</ref> have argued that the lowering of fences and the narrowing of ditches, primarily designed to increase horse safety, has had the adverse effect by encouraging the runners to race faster. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Grand National saw a total of 12 horses die (half of which were at Becher's Brook); in the next 20-year period from 1990 to 2010, when modifications to the course were most significant, there were 17 equine fatalities. The [[2011 Grand National|2011]] and [[2012 Grand National|2012 race]]s each yielded two deaths, including one each at Becher's Brook.  In 2013, when further changes were made to introduce a more flexible fence structure, there were no fatalities in the race itself although two horses died in run-up races over the same course.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dawes |first=Mike |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/racing/article-2304605/Little-Josh-dies-Grand-National-meeting-day-one.html |title=Little Josh dies on Grand National meeting day one |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=5 April 2013 |accessdate=8 April 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140408140545/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/racing/article-2304605/Little-Josh-dies-Grand-National-meeting-day-one.html |archivedate=8 April 2014  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/horseracing/grand-national/9974805/Grand-National-2013-Little-Josh-becomes-second-horse-to-die-over-the-big-Aintree-fences.html|title=Grand National 2013: Little Josh becomes second horse to die over the big Aintree fences|newspaper=Telegraph|accessdate=8 April 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515064624/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/horseracing/grand-national/9974805/Grand-National-2013-Little-Josh-becomes-second-horse-to-die-over-the-big-Aintree-fences.html|archivedate=15 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"league1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.league.org.uk/news-and-opinion/press-releases/2014/apr/injury-and-fatalities-are-inevitable-during-grand-national-meet |title=Charity warns that until horse welfare is put first, injury and fatalities are inevitable during Grand National meet - League Against Cruel Sports |publisher=League.org.uk |date=3 April 2014 |accessdate=8 April 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408212451/http://www.league.org.uk/news-and-opinion/press-releases/2014/apr/injury-and-fatalities-are-inevitable-during-grand-national-meet |archivedate=8 April 2014  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/horse-racing/26128471 |title=BBC Sport - Grand National 2014: Tidal Bay tops Aintree weights |work=BBC News |date=11 February 2014 |accessdate=11 February 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305160408/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/horse-racing/26128471 |archivedate=5 March 2014  }}</ref> The animal welfare charity [[League Against Cruel Sports]] counts the number of horse deaths over the three-day meeting from the year 2000 to 2013 at 40.<ref name=\"league1\"/> There were no equine fatalities in the main Grand National race for seven years until 2019,<ref>{{cite web |title=The 2014 Grand National |url=https://www.animalaid.org.uk/2014-grand-national/ |website=Animal Aid |accessdate=5 August 2018 |date=5 April 2014}}</ref> when one horse died at the first fence.<ref>{{cite web |title=Grand National 2019: Willie Mullins' Up For Review dies after falling at first hurdle|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/racing/grand-national-2019-result-horse-dies-up-for-review-fall-first-hurdle-aintree-a8858181.html%3famp |website=The Independent |date=6 April 2019 |accessdate=6 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Grand National Legends==\nIn 2009, the race sponsors John Smith's launched a poll to determine five personalities to be inducted into the inaugural ''Grand National Legends'' initiative.<ref name=\"GN Legends\">{{cite web|title=Grand National Legends through History {{!}} GrandNational.Org.UK|url=https://www.grandnational.org.uk/legends.php|website=Grandnational.org.uk|accessdate=24 March 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180324102442/https://www.grandnational.org.uk/legends.php|archivedate=24 March 2018}}</ref> The winners were announced on the day of the [[2010 Grand National]] and inscribed on commemorative plaques at Aintree.

increasingly popular tourist destination for wine and [[Baja Med cuisine]]. It is located {{convert|20|km|mi}} north of the [[Ensenada, Baja California|City of Ensenada]] and {{convert|113|km|mi}} southeast of the [[San Ysidro Port of Entry|border crossing from San Diego to Tijuana]]. It includes communities such as Ejido El Porvenir, Francisco Zarco and San Antonio De las Minas, and had 2,664 inhabitants (2010 census).\n\n==History==\nThe community was founded in 1834 by [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] missionary [[F\u00e9lix Caballero]] as [[Misi\u00f3n de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe del Norte]], making it the last mission established in the Californias. Caballero had to abandon the mission in 1840, under attacks from the indigenous peoples.\n\nFrom 1905\u20131910, a mixture of [[Spiritual Christian]] faiths, mostly ''[http://www.molokane.org/places/Mexico Pryguny]'' from [[Transcaucasia]], South Russia, settled in 4 farming colonies near Ensenada, [[Baja California Norte Territory]], Mexico. Guadalupe was the main colony of about 20+ square miles purchased in 1905. Most owned or rented land communally. Not all were ethnic Russians, and were of various folk-Protestant (non-Orthodox) faiths. A few Russian Orthodox immigrants, had no priest or church, lived in Ensenada and were confused with the Spiritual Christians. \n\nTo make land and loan payments, paid in wheat, the settlers rented as much as 50 square miles from about 10 nearby ranches, north to the border. Most moved to California by World War II to join more prosperous relatives and work in the factories. Some intermarried with Spiritual Christian ''[[Dukh-i-zhizniki]]'' in California. Most of who remained, intermarried, assimilated and live in Ensenada and Tijuana.\n\nWhen the valley economy shifted to wine-making, the Baja government funded a museum, to preserve the history of the former settlers from Old Russia and enhance wine tourism. Soon two private museums opened, one with a cafe across the street from the state museum, to provide Russian-Mexican dishes for tourists and groups. Roads are improved with asphalt paving to accommodate wine-tour buses.\n\n==Wineries==\n[[File:Carignan vineyard.jpg|thumbnail|left|Vineyard in the valley]]\nSince the 1990s the association of winemakers of Baja California holds the Grape Harvest Fiestas in the '''Valley of Guadalupe''' and the town of Ensenada every year in August.

This [[Raunki\u00e6r plant life-form|Geophyte (Cryptophyte)]] forms [[bulbs]] as resting buds. The egg-shaped bulbs have a rough shell, are 2 to 3.5&nbsp;cm long and 1.5 to 3&nbsp;cm wide. The two to three [[leaves]] are up to 38 centimeters long and 4.5 centimeters wide, and are flat, narrow and [[lanceolate]] with a clear gloss upper surface.<ref name=\"sararichardson\"/>\n\nThe flowers are usually single, rarely in pairs on the stem. The [[perianth]] is bright pink, with a sharply demarcated yellow centre and the petals are pointed. The three outer petals are 38 to 53&nbsp;mm long and 9 to 18&nbsp;mm wide, the three inner ones being the same length, but wider. The [[stamens]] are hairy at the base, with brown to black anthers that are 4.5 to 7 millimeters long. The [[Capsule (botany)|capsule]] has coarse cross veins in the upper part.<ref name=\"sararichardson\">[http://www.botanicus.org/page/818003 Sprengel, Curt Polycarp Joachim. 1825. Systema Vegetabilium, editio decima sexta 2: 63]</ref>\n\nThe flowering period extends from March to May. There are [[diploid]] and [[triploid]] plants with 2n = 24 and 36 chromosomes.<ref name=persson>[https://books.google.com/books?id=PFl2OiIWOp0C Karin Persson: Tulipa L. in: Arne Strid, Kit Tan (eds.): Mountain Flora of Greece.

This [[Raunki\u00e6r plant life-form|Geophyte (Cryptophyte)]] forms [[bulbs]] as resting buds. The egg-shaped bulbs have a rough shell, are 2 to 3.5&nbsp;cm long and 1.5 to 3&nbsp;cm wide. The two to three [[leaves]] are up to 38 centimeters long and 4.5 centimeters wide, and are flat, narrow and [[lanceolate]] with a clear gloss upper surface.<ref name=\"sararichardson\"/>\n\nThe flowers are usually single, rarely in pairs on the stem. The [[perianth]] is bright pink, with a sharply demarcated yellow centre and the petals are pointed. The three outer petals are 38 to 53&nbsp;mm long and 9 to 18&nbsp;mm wide, the three inner ones being the same length, but wider. The [[stamens]] are hairy at the base, with brown to black anthers that are 4.5 to 7 millimeters long. The [[Capsule (botany)|capsule]] has coarse cross veins in the upper part.<ref name=\"sararichardson\">[http://www.botanicus.org/page/818003 Sprengel, Curt Polycarp Joachim. 1825.

{"title_page": "Protocol Wars", "text_new": "{{short description|Computer science debate}}\nA long-running debate in [[computer science]] known as the '''Protocol Wars''' occurred from the 1970s to the 1990s when engineers, organizations and nations became polarized over the issue of which [[Communication protocol|protocol]] would result in the best and most robust [[computer network]]s. This culminated in the '''Internet-OSI Standards War''' in the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nThe pioneers of [[packet switching]] technology built computer networks to research [[Data transmission|data communications]] in the early 1970s. As [[Public data network|public data networks]] emerged in the mid to late 1970s, the debate about interface [[Standardization|standards]] was described as a \"battle for access standards\". Several proprietary standards emerged and European [[postal, telegraph and telephone service]]s (PTTs) developed the [[X.25]] standard in 1976, which was adopted for public networks in Europe and North America. \n\nThe [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) developed and tested [[TCP/IP]] during the 1970s in collaboration with universities and researchers in the United States, United Kingdom and France. [[IPv4]] was released in 1981 and the DoD made it standard for all military computer networking. By 1984, an international standard known as the [[OSI model]] had been agreed with which X.25 and TCP/IP were not directly compatible. Many governments in Europe \u2013 particularly France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the European Economic Community \u2013 and also the [[United States Department of Commerce]] mandated compliance with the OSI model and the US Department of Defense planned to transition away from TCP/IP to OSI. Meanwhile, the development of a complete [[Internet protocol suite]] by 1989, and [[Internet protocol suite#Adoption|partnerships with the telecommunication and computer industry]] to incorporate TCP/IP software into various operating systems laid the foundation for the widespread adoption of TCP/IP as a comprehensive protocol suite. While OSI developed its networking standards in the late 1980s, TCP/IP came into widespread use on multi-vendor networks for [[Internetwork|internetworking]] and as the core component of the emerging [[Internet]].\n\n== Early computer networking ==\n\n=== Pioneers vs PTTs ===\nIn the 1960s, [[Paul Baran]] in the United States and [[Donald Davies]] in the United Kingdom found it hard to convince incumbent telephone companies of the merits of their ideas for the design of computer data networks. [[AT&T]] in the United States and the [[postal, telegraph and telephone service]] (PTT) in the United Kingdom, the [[General Post Office]] (GPO), had a monopoly on communications infrastructure. They believed speech traffic would continue to dominate data traffic and believed in traditional telegraphic techniques.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Abbate|first=Janet|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9BfZxFZpElwC|title=Inventing the Internet|date=2000-07-24|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-26133-3|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Abell|first=John C.|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/03/internet-architect-paul-baran-dies-at-84/|title=Internet Architect Paul Baran Dies at 84|date=2011-03-28|work=Wired|access-date=2020-02-18|issn=1059-1028}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kirstein|first=Peter T.|date=2009|title=The early history of packet switching in the UK|journal=IEEE Communications Magazine|volume=47|issue=2|pages=18\u201326|doi=10.1109/MCOM.2009.4785372|issn=1558-1896}}</ref> Baran published a series of briefings and papers about dividing information into \"message blocks\" and sending it over distributed networks between 1960-64.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/about/history/baran.html|title=Paul Baran and the Origins of the Internet|website=[[RAND Corporation]]|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref> Davies conceived of and named the concept of [[packet switching]] in [[Data transmission|data communication]] networks in 1965.

This culminated in the '''Internet-OSI Standards War''' in the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nThe pioneers of [[packet switching]] technology built computer networks to research [[Data transmission|data communications]] in the early 1970s. As [[Public data network|public data networks]] emerged in the mid to late 1970s, the debate about interface [[Standardization|standards]] was described as a \"battle for access standards\". Several proprietary standards emerged and European [[postal, telegraph and telephone service]]s (PTTs) developed the [[X.25]] standard in 1976, which was adopted for public networks in Europe and North America. \n\nThe [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) developed and tested [[TCP/IP]] during the 1970s in collaboration with universities and researchers in the United States, United Kingdom and France. [[IPv4]] was released in 1981 and the DoD made it standard for all military computer networking. By 1984, an international standard known as the [[OSI model]] had been agreed with which X.25 and TCP/IP were not directly compatible. Many governments in Europe \u2013 particularly France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the European Economic Community \u2013 and also the [[United States Department of Commerce]] mandated compliance with the OSI model and the US Department of Defense planned to transition away from TCP/IP to OSI. Meanwhile, the development of a complete [[Internet protocol suite]] by 1989, and [[Internet protocol suite#Adoption|partnerships with the telecommunication and computer industry]] to incorporate TCP/IP software into various operating systems laid the foundation for the widespread adoption of TCP/IP as a comprehensive protocol suite. While OSI developed its networking standards in the late 1980s, TCP/IP came into widespread use on multi-vendor networks for [[Internetwork|internetworking]] and as the core component of the emerging [[Internet]].\n\n== Early computer networking ==\n\n=== Pioneers vs PTTs ===\nIn the 1960s, [[Paul Baran]] in the United States and [[Donald Davies]] in the United Kingdom found it hard to convince incumbent telephone companies of the merits of their ideas for the design of computer data networks. [[AT&T]] in the United States and the [[postal, telegraph and telephone service]] (PTT) in the United Kingdom, the [[General Post Office]] (GPO), had a monopoly on communications infrastructure.

Their oldest occupation was [[rice]]-growing, but they also raised [[silkworm]]s and cultivated [[tobacco]].  The Jewish [[vineyard]]s were especially notable. The Jews and their Christian Armenian neighbors were the main producers of [[wine]], as [[Muslims]] were prohibited by their religion from producing or consuming alcohol. Judaism, in turn, limited some types of meat consumption. Unlike their neighbors, the Jews raised few [[domestic animals]].  At the same time, they were renowned tanners. [[Tanning (leather)|Tanning]] was their third most important economic activity after farming and gardening. At the end of the 19th century, 6% of Jews were engaged in this trade.

In practical terms, the Jews are no longer isolated from other [[ethnic groups]].\n\nWith increasing urbanization and [[sovietization]] in progress, by the 1930s, a layer of [[intelligentsia]] began to form.

Their oldest occupation was [[rice]]-growing, but they also raised [[silkworm]]s and cultivated [[tobacco]].  The Jewish [[vineyard]]s were especially notable. The Jews and their Christian Armenian neighbors were the main producers of [[wine]], as [[Muslims]] were prohibited by their religion from producing or consuming alcohol. Judaism, in turn, limited some types of meat consumption. Unlike their neighbors, the Jews raised few [[domestic animals]].  At the same time, they were renowned tanners. [[Tanning (leather)|Tanning]] was their third most important economic activity after farming and gardening. At the end of the 19th century, 6% of Jews were engaged in this trade. [[Handicrafts]] and commerce were mostly practiced by Jews in towns.\n\nThe [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] authorities bound the Mountain Jews to [[collective farm]]s, but allowed them to continue their traditional cultivation of grapes, [[tobacco]], and vegetables; and making wine. In practical terms, the Jews are no longer isolated from other [[ethnic groups]].\n\nWith increasing urbanization and [[sovietization]] in progress, by the 1930s, a layer of [[intelligentsia]] began to form. By the late 1960s, academic professionals, such as pharmacists, medical doctors, and engineers, were quite common among the community. Mountain Jews worked in more professional positions than did [[Georgian Jews]], though less than the Soviet Ashkenazi community, who were based in larger cities of Russia. A sizable number of Mountain Jewish worked in the entertainment industry in Dagestan.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Pinkus, B., & Frankel, J. (1984).

The ''1301'' and the ''1501'' were the natural evolution of the previous [[Simca 1300/1500|1300 and 1500]] models with which they shared engines and mechanical parts.\n\n=== Features ===\n\nCompared to the two predecessors, the 1301 and 1501 kept the same stylistic approach, although they were slightly modernised: they were then characterised by the same 3 square four door saloon and 2 square 4 door wagon body styles. The most obvious design differences were in the front and rear ends of the car: the front end was longer by 6.9&nbsp;cm, while the rear end on the sedan bodies was increased as well by 13.5&nbsp;cm in order to allow a greater baggage capacity. The result was that 1301 and 1501 sedan models were longer by 21 [[centimetre|cm]] compared to 1300 and 1500. Other differences were both in the front, where it was given a new [[Grille (motor vehicle)|grille]], and redesigned in the side indicator area. Differences stand out in the cockpit instrument panel with a new horizontal and straight design. Despite the disappearance of some luxuries such as the courtesy light inside, they did improve the overall quality and comfort of the seats and their upholstery.\n\nAt first, even the engines used were the same from the 1300/1500 models, although they had in part been revised. The 1301 was equipped with the 1,290 [[cubic centimetre|cc]], [[4-cylinder]] \"Rush\" engine, with overhead valves, and powered by a single barrel [[carburetor|carburettor]] it was capable of delivering 54&nbsp;hp DIN and allowed the car to reach a top speed of 135&nbsp;km/h. Similarly, the Simca 1501 was equipped by the same [[Simca Type 342 and 345 Engines|Type 342]] engine of the previous Simca 1500, a 1,475 cc 4-cylinder originally powered by a single barrel carburettor, and capable of delivering 69&nbsp;hp DIN. The maximum speed for the 1501 was improved slightly, reaching 147 km/h in its earliest rendition.\n\n=== Range and trim levels  ===\n\nAt the start of production, the range 1301/1501 was composed as follows:\n\n*'''1301''' '''Sedan''' and '''1501 Sedan''', with the trim levels '''LS''', '''GL''' and '''GLS''';\n*'''1301 Break''' and '''1501 Break''', with the trim levels '''LS''' and '''GLS''';\n*'''1301 Familiale''' and '''1501 Familiale''', with only one trim level, '''LS''';\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Evolution ===\n[[File:SIMCA 1301 AV.jpg|thumb|Simca 1301]]\n[[File:Biarritz, France (3290723609).jpg|thumb|1973 Simca 1501 Break]]\nThe first deliveries began in late 1966 and early 1967: in March, the range was completed with the arrival of the 1301U, an unprecedented version of the car, a van with the rear windows replaced by sheet metal and only two seats, while the rear part of the passenger compartment has been completely emptied to make it a load compartment.\n\nLike with the ''1300'' and the ''1500'', the new ''1301'' and ''1501'' was came with a two-year warranty on the engine, gearbox and suspension. This was done in order to attract new customers and establish the commercial success of the two models. Unfortunately, the shadow of Chrysler ended up covering the traditional methods of Simca and went to be a problem for the development of subsequent projects of the French Company.\n\nIn autumn 1968 the range was revised and simplified: the Sedan ''1301'' ''LS'' and ''GL'' remained on the list, while the ''1301 Break'' and ''Familiale'' were merged into a single model, the '''1301 GL'''. As for the ''1501'', the ''LS'' and ''GLS'' were cancelled, leaving in the existing list only the ''GL'' and the new '''1501 Special''', which was also available as [[station wagon]]. The ''1501 Special'' was equipped with a redesigned version of the Type 342 engine that came in the GL, the Type 342S, which came with a revised head design and a double barrel carburettor, it delivered 81&nbsp;hp DIN, and had a 160&nbsp;km/h top speed. Another feature of the Special was an increased rear [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] ratio. The special also came equipped with boosted brakes and a sporty steering wheel. What also disappeared from the lineup was the 1301 U, which received little interest as a commercial vehicle.\n\nIn September 1969, for the ''1501'' there was another redesign, focused mainly on the front end of the car, where it found a completely redesigned grille and headlights which now incorporated a pair of fog lights as factory equipment. The 1301, however, on the outside, remained visually unchanged. Internally, for the whole range there was a new dashboard and a new instrument panel with round elements (two for the 1301 and four for 1501), and also a spot for a radio. Another significant change in the cockpit concerned the use of fabrics and tints that were coordinated and harmonized. Mechanically, all the ''1501'' trims benefited from the ''342S'' engine with 81&nbsp;hp, which had until then only equipped the ''Special''. The latter then differed from the other trims only in the interior and equipment.\n\nIn early 1970, the 1301 saw its Rush engine replaced by a more modern engine based on the Type 342: the [[Simca Type 342 and 345 Engines|Type 345]]. The Type 342 was a debored version of the Type 342 engine, with only 1290cc, which now came in all standard 1301 models, delivering 60hp DIN. The 1301 Special would now come with the Type 342S, a version of the 342 with a twin barrel carb and increased compression, delivering 70 hp DIN. This was in essence the only real news regarding the ''1301'' range since its debut. Other improvements helped to increase the reliability, while lowering power consumption. The 60&nbsp;hp 1.3 engine went to equip the only other 1301 sedan remained, namely the ''LS''. The latter remained in the list until August, only to be replaced by 1301, without additional acronyms. In September 1970, the range was as follows:\n\n*''1301'', with the 1.3 litre, 60&nbsp;hp engine;\n*''1301 Special'', with the 1.3 litre, 70&nbsp;hp engine;\n*''1301 Break Special'', with the 1.3 litre, 70&nbsp;hp engine;\n*''1501 Break Special'', with the 1.5 litre, 81&nbsp;hp engine.\n\nNote the disappearance of sedans in 1501, commissioned by Chrysler (which already held a 95% stake in the Simca) to not hinder the commercial career of the [[Chrysler 160|Type 160]]. A lot of copies of ''1501'' with sedan bodywork continued to be produced for a bit of time for some foreign markets and marketed as '''1501 GLE''', where the E was for export.\n\nIn 1971, the new grille was also adopted by the ''1301''. This was part of a rationalization program wanted by Chrysler Europe, which aimed to standardize as much as possible Simca models, to reduce costs and check the best possible profits. Also in 1971 came the outside rearview mirror and a new steering wheel with horn cup concentric. Among the new options of more details, the vinyl roof should be mentioned, which emphasized the elegance of the car. In the same year, however, the ''1301 base'' and the ''1501 Break'' left the list at which point the range resulted composed solely and exclusively of the ''1301 Sp\u00e9cial'' in ''sedan'' and ''Break'.\n\nIn 1972 there were only updates to the detail of the range for the ''1301'', aimed essentially to the interior (cigarette lighter, rear-view antiglare, better internal soundproofing, etc.) and mechanics (reinforced gearbox, rear brakes, etc.).\n\nIn 1973, however, there were more substantial changes: the lack of success encountered by the ''Type 160'' pushed the leaders of Chrysler to resume production of the ''1501'', then returned to the list as the ''Special'' (and always in two body variants), but with its engine detuned to 73&nbsp;hp. For its part, the ''1301'', not to stand too close to the \"big sister\", deprived itself of some horsepower and went from 70 to 67&nbsp;hp. The weakening of the models, however, was mainly to decrease fuel consumption, given the oil crisis erupted in that year and brought down the intentions (and models) of many car manufacturers.\n\nThe only notable update for 1974 was the introduction of the entire range of the taillights, which become obligatory from September of that year. There was also another, but much less visible: in ''1501'' the power down to 71&nbsp;hp.\n\nIn 1975 Simca presented the [[Simca 1307|1307, 1308 and 1309]]: in July the ''1301'' production was stopped, it was followed in September by the ''1501'', but the range still resisted enough to face its last Paris Motor Show. In January of ''1976'' the ''Break'' also disappeared from the list, while the last examples, in both body configurations, were disposed of by the first half of the following year.\n\n=== Summary characteristics ===\n\nThe following summarizes the characteristics of the various versions of the range of ''1301''/''1501'':\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"0\"  cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%; width:100%\"\n|colspan=13 style=\"height:27px; background:#D5EAFB; text-align:center; font-weight:bold\"|Simca 1301 / 1501\n|-style=\"background:#DCDCDC; font-weight:bold\" \n| Model\n| Bodywork\n| Trim\n| Engine\n| Displacement<br>cm\u00b3\n| Power<br>hp DIN/rpm\n| Torque<br>([[Newton per metre|Nm]]/rpm)\n| Empty mass<br>(kg)\n| Top<br>speed\n| Years in production\n|-\n|rowspan=\"9\"|'''1301'''||rowspan=\"5\"|Sedan||LS, GL and GLS||[[Motore Simca Rush|Type 312T (Rush)]]||rowspan=\"5\"|1290||54/5200||87/2600||rowspan=\"3\"|990||135||1966-69\n|-\n|LS||rowspan=\"2\"|[[Motore Simca Type 345|Type 345]]||rowspan=\"2\"|60/5400||rowspan=\"2\"|87.3/4300||rowspan=\"2\"|140||02/1970-08/1970\n|-\n|base||1970-71\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|''Sp\u00e9cial''||[[Motore Simca Type 345|Type 345 S]]||70/5400||88.3/4600||rowspan=\"2\"|1.010||rowspan=\"2\"|152||1970-73\n|-\n|[[Motore Simca Type 345|2L2]]||67/5400||99/4000||1973-75\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[Station wagon|Station Wagon]]||LS, LS Familiale, GLS||rowspan=\"2\"|Type 312T (Rush)||rowspan=\"4\"|1290||rowspan=\"2\"|54/5200||rowspan=\"2\"|87/2600||rowspan=\"2\"|1.150||rowspan=\"2\"|130||1967-68\n|-\n|GL||1968-69\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Sp\u00e9cial||Type 345 S||70/5400||88.3/4600||rowspan=\"2\"|1.170||145||1970-73\n|-\n|2L2||67/5400||99/4000||143||1973-75\n|-\n|rowspan=\"10\"|'''1501'''||rowspan=\"4\"|Sedan||LS, GL, GLS||[[Motore Simca Type 342|Type 342]]||rowspan=\"4\"|1475||69/5200||100/2600||1.010||147||1966-68\n|-\n|GL||rowspan=\"2\"|[[Motore Simca Type 342|Type 342 S]]||rowspan=\"2\"|81/5200||rowspan=\"2\"|122/4000||rowspan=\"3\"|1.020||rowspan=\"3\"|160||1968-70\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Sp\u00e9cial||1968-70\n|-\n|[[Motore Simca Type 342|2N2]]||73/5100||114/3600||1973-75\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\"|Station Wagon||LS, LS Familiale, GLS||rowspan=\"2\"|Type 342||rowspan=\"6\"|1475||rowspan=\"2\"|69/5200||rowspan=\"2\"|100/2600||rowspan=\"2\"|1.190||rowspan=\"2\"|142||1967-68\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|GL||1968-69\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Motore Simca Type 342|Type 342 S]]||rowspan=\"2\"|81/5200||rowspan=\"2\"|122/4000||rowspan=\"4\"|1.210||rowspan=\"2\"|150||1969-71\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|''Sp\u00e9cial''||1968-71\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2N2||73/5100||rowspan=\"2\"|114/3600||142||1973-74\n|-\n|71/5000||140||1974-75\n|}\n\n== References ==\n*''Les Simca 1300-1500 et 1301/1501'', Christian Caz\u00e9, ETAI\n*''Simca - L'aventure de l'hirondelle'', Adrien Cahuzac, ETAI\n\n==External links==\n*[http://webmaster.simca.free.fr/modeles.php?id=&ref_mod=206 French page dedicated to limited release in 1301 Export]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080908015140/http://hometown.aol.com/simcamaniac/Simca13001500pg1.html English site dedicated to the 1300, 1301, 1500 and 1501]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Simca 1301 1501}}\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1966]]\n[[Category:Simca vehicles|1301]]\n[[Category:1970s cars]]\n", "text_old": "{{no footnotes|date=October 2015}}\n\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = Simca 1301 Special Front.JPG\n| caption = Simca 1301 Special\n| name = Simca 1301/1501\n| manufacturer = [[Simca]]\n| production = 1966\u20131975\n| predecessor = [[Simca 1300/1500]]\n| successor = [[Simca 1307]]\n| class = [[Compact executive car|Large family car]] ([[D-segment|D]])\n| layout = [[FR layout]]\n| body_style = 4-door [[saloon car|saloon]]<br>5-door [[station wagon]]\n| engine = 1.3&nbsp;L ''Rush'' [[ohv]] [[straight-4|I4]]<br>1.3&nbsp;L [[Simca_Type_342_and_345_Engines#Type_345|Type 345]] [[ohv]] [[straight-4|I4]]<br>1.5&nbsp;L [[Simca_Type_342_and_345_Engines#Type_342|Type 342]] [[ohv]] [[straight-4|I4]]\n| transmission = \n| wheelbase = {{convert|99|in|mm|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|175.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} <br> ''1301 / 1501 saloon''<br>{{convert|169.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} <br> ''1301 / 1501 estate''\n| width = {{convert|62|in|mm|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|55|in|mm|abbr=on}} ''unladen''\n| related = \n| designer = \n}}\nThe '''Simca 1301''' and '''Simca 1501''' are two related [[automobile]]s which were produced by the [[France|French]] [[automaker]] [[Simca]] from 1966 to 1975.\n\n== History and Profile ==\n\nThe Simcas 1301 and 1501 were first presented to the public in October 1966, and a preview presentation to the press took place on August 31 of that year.

This was in essence the only real news regarding the ''1301'' range since its debut. Other improvements helped to increase the reliability, while lowering power consumption. The 60&nbsp;hp 1.3 engine went to equip the only other 1301 sedan remained, namely the ''LS''. The latter remained in the list until August, only to be replaced by 1301, without additional acronyms. In September 1970, the range was as follows:\n\n*''1301'', with the 1.3 litre, 60&nbsp;hp engine;\n*''1301 Special'', with the 1.3 litre, 70&nbsp;hp engine;\n*''1301 Break Special'', with the 1.3 litre, 70&nbsp;hp engine;\n*''1501 Break Special'', with the 1.5 litre, 81&nbsp;hp engine.\n\nNote the disappearance of sedans in 1501, commissioned by Chrysler (which already held a 95% stake in the Simca) to not hinder the commercial career of the [[Chrysler 160|Type 160]]. A lot of copies of ''1501'' with sedan bodywork continued to be produced for a bit of time for some foreign markets and marketed as '''1501 GLE''', where the E was for export.\n\nIn 1971, the new grille was also adopted by the ''1301''. This was part of a rationalization program wanted by Chrysler Europe, which aimed to standardize as much as possible Simca models, to reduce costs and check the best possible profits. Also in 1971 came the outside rearview mirror and a new steering wheel with horn cup concentric. Among the new options of more details, the vinyl roof should be mentioned, which emphasized the elegance of the car. In the same year, however, the ''1301 base'' and the ''1501 Break'' left the list at which point the range resulted composed solely and exclusively of the ''1301 Sp\u00e9cial'' in ''sedan'' and ''Break'.\n\nIn 1972 there were only updates to the detail of the range for the ''1301'', aimed essentially to the interior (cigarette lighter, rear-view antiglare, better internal soundproofing, etc.) and mechanics (reinforced gearbox, rear brakes, etc.).\n\nIn 1973, however, there were more substantial changes: the lack of success encountered by the ''Type 160'' pushed the leaders of Chrysler to resume production of the ''1501'', then returned to the list as the ''Special'' (and always in two body variants), but with its engine detuned to 73&nbsp;hp. For its part, the ''1301'', not to stand too close to the \"big sister\", deprived itself of some horsepower and went from 70 to 67&nbsp;hp. The weakening of the models, however, was mainly to decrease fuel consumption, given the oil crisis erupted in that year and brought down the intentions (and models) of many car manufacturers.\n\nThe only notable update for 1974 was the introduction of the entire range of the taillights, which become obligatory from September of that year. There was also another, but much less visible: in ''1501'' the power down to 71&nbsp;hp.\n\nIn 1975 Simca presented the [[Simca 1307|1307, 1308 and 1309]]: in July the ''1301'' production was stopped, it was followed in September by the ''1501'', but the range still resisted enough to face its last Paris Motor Show. In January of ''1976'' the ''Break'' also disappeared from the list, while the last examples, in both body configurations, were disposed of by the first half of the following year.\n\n=== Summary characteristics ===\n\nThe following summarizes the characteristics of the various versions of the range of ''1301''/''1501'':\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"0\"  cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%; width:100%\"\n|colspan=13 style=\"height:27px; background:#D5EAFB; text-align:center; font-weight:bold\"|Simca 1301 / 1501\n|-style=\"background:#DCDCDC; font-weight:bold\" \n| Model\n| Bodywork\n| Trim\n| Engine\n| Displacement<br>cm\u00b3\n| Power<br>hp DIN/rpm\n| Torque<br>([[Newton per metre|Nm]]/rpm)\n| Empty mass<br>(kg)\n| Top<br>speed\n| Years in production\n|-\n|rowspan=\"9\"|'''1301'''||rowspan=\"5\"|Sedan||LS, GL and GLS||[[Motore Simca Rush|Type 312T (Rush)]]||rowspan=\"5\"|1290||54/5200||87/2600||rowspan=\"3\"|990||135||1966-69\n|-\n|LS||rowspan=\"2\"|[[Motore Simca Type 345|Type 345]]||rowspan=\"2\"|60/5400||rowspan=\"2\"|87.3/4300||rowspan=\"2\"|140||02/1970-08/1970\n|-\n|base||1970-71\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|''Sp\u00e9cial''||[[Motore Simca Type 345|Type 345 S]]||70/5400||88.3/4600||rowspan=\"2\"|1.010||rowspan=\"2\"|152||1970-73\n|-\n|[[Motore Simca Type 345|2L2]]||67/5400||99/4000||1973-75\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[Station wagon|Station Wagon]]||LS, LS Familiale, GLS||rowspan=\"2\"|Type 312T (Rush)||rowspan=\"4\"|1290||rowspan=\"2\"|54/5200||rowspan=\"2\"|87/2600||rowspan=\"2\"|1.150||rowspan=\"2\"|130||1967-68\n|-\n|GL||1968-69\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Sp\u00e9cial||Type 345 S||70/5400||88.3/4600||rowspan=\"2\"|1.170||145||1970-73\n|-\n|2L2||67/5400||99/4000||143||1973-75\n|-\n|rowspan=\"10\"|'''1501'''||rowspan=\"4\"|Sedan||LS, GL, GLS||[[Motore Simca Type 342|Type 342]]||rowspan=\"4\"|1475||69/5200||100/2600||1.010||147||1966-68\n|-\n|GL||rowspan=\"2\"|[[Motore Simca Type 342|Type 342 S]]||rowspan=\"2\"|81/5200||rowspan=\"2\"|122/4000||rowspan=\"3\"|1.020||rowspan=\"3\"|160||1968-70\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Sp\u00e9cial||1968-70\n|-\n|[[Motore Simca Type 342|2N2]]||73/5100||114/3600||1973-75\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\"|Station Wagon||LS, LS Familiale, GLS||rowspan=\"2\"|Type 342||rowspan=\"6\"|1475||rowspan=\"2\"|69/5200||rowspan=\"2\"|100/2600||rowspan=\"2\"|1.190||rowspan=\"2\"|142||1967-68\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|GL||1968-69\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Motore Simca Type 342|Type 342 S]]||rowspan=\"2\"|81/5200||rowspan=\"2\"|122/4000||rowspan=\"4\"|1.210||rowspan=\"2\"|150||1969-71\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|''Sp\u00e9cial''||1968-71\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2N2||73/5100||rowspan=\"2\"|114/3600||142||1973-74\n|-\n|71/5000||140||1974-75\n|}\n\n== References ==\n*''Les Simca 1300-1500 et 1301/1501'', Christian Caz\u00e9, ETAI\n*''Simca - L'aventure de l'hirondelle'', Adrien Cahuzac, ETAI\n\n==External links==\n*[http://webmaster.simca.free.fr/modeles.php?id=&ref_mod=206 French page dedicated to limited release in 1301 Export]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080908015140/http://hometown.aol.com/simcamaniac/Simca13001500pg1.html English site dedicated to the 1300, 1301, 1500 and 1501]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Simca 1301 1501}}\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1966]]\n[[Category:Simca vehicles|1301]]\n[[Category:1960s cars]]\n[[Category:1970s cars]]\n", "name_user": "TKOIII", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:Removed redundant category as per WP:Subcat.
