Set in an [[alternate timeline]] of [[World War II]], players engage in side-scrolling shooter gameplay, using female [[moe anthropomorphism|moe anthropomorphic]] characters based on [[warships]] from the war's major participants. Other gameplay elements, like customizing a home and marrying in-game characters, are also present.\n\nFirst launched in China in May and in Japan in September 2017, ''Azur Lane'' has briefly become very popular, especially in Japan where the player count reached five million within four months after its release. Successive [[Comiket]] numbers have yet to confirm long-term popularity of the game in Japan, with Azur Lane ranking around 10th below franchises and genres like ''[[Fate Grand Order]]'', ''[[Kantai Collection]]'' or Virtual YouTubers. Players have voted the game among the top five on [[Google Play]]'s Best Game of 2017 list for the region. Critics have attributed the game's popularity to its original and well-designed gameplay system. An English-language version started open beta in August 2018 and was formally released in May 2019. Later, on December 18, English version was expanded to Latin American region. PWB Play simultaneously released it to [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], and [[Taiwan]] on October 4, 2019.\n\nThe game has been adapted into several manga and novelizations. ''Azur Lane Crosswave'', a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] adaptation for [[PlayStation 4]], was published by [[Compile Heart]] on August 29, 2019 with mixed reception. ''Crosswave''<nowiki/>'s English localization was released on February 13, 2020 for PlayStation 4 and PC. An [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Bibury Animation Studio]] premiered on October 3, 2019 and aired in [[Japan]] and the [[United States]] until March 20, 2020.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2018/09/15-1/ship-girl-smart-phone-game-azur-lane-sets-sail-as-a-tv-anime|title=Ship Girl Smart Phone Game Azur Lane Sets Sail as a TV Anime|access-date=April 1, 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Azur Lane main screen.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Main interface, with the character ''[[USS Long Island (CVE-1)|Long Island]]''.

Players organize them into fleets of six and confront [[Artificial intelligence|AI]]-controlled enemies or other players' fleets.<ref name=\"rpgsarticle\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/6593-how-azur-lane-is-able-to-rival-kantai-collection-s-popularity-in-japan|title=How Azur Lane is able to rival Kantai Collection's popularity in Japan {{!}} RPG Site|last=Stenbuck|first=Kite|website=RPG Site|access-date=June 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\nPersonifications of American destroyer [[USS Laffey (DD-459)|USS ''Laffey'' (DD-459)]], British destroyer [[HMS Javelin|HMS ''Javelin'']] and German destroyer [[German destroyer Z23|''Z23'']] (Chinese, English release) or Japanese destroyer [[Japanese destroyer Ayanami (1929)|''Ayanami'']] (Japanese, Korean release) are available for players to select as a starter ship.

[[Destroyer]]s, [[light cruiser]]s, and [[heavy cruiser]]s can be allotted to the front row, while the back row is reserved for [[battleship]]s, [[aircraft cruiser]], [[monitor (warship)|monitor]]s, [[repair ship]]s, [[battlecruiser]]s and [[aircraft carrier]]s. Different combinations of ships are required to achieve victory in different battle situations. Players may then select and enter a [[level (video gaming)|map]].<ref name=rpgsarticle/>\n\nOn entering a map, the player's fleet is placed on a grid-like map similar to that in the game [[Battleship (game)|Battleship]]. The map contains nodes, which are either combat nodes which are enemy fleets, some immobile and others that pursue the player, or non-combat nodes which provides ammunition or mystery nodes which can provide supplies such as repair kits, upgrade materials or can spawn a special combat node called a Treasure Fleet. Players must navigate optimally and assemble their fleets tactically, to clear obstructing enemies and, using minimal movements, reach the map's [[boss (video gaming)|boss]]. When the player moves their fleet across the map, they can be ambushed in [[random encounter]]s from which they may take damage, or they can be forced to engage the enemy, using fuel and ammo. Fuel is one of the two in-game resources. Ammo points are assigned to player fleets at each map, with one ammo point deducted at each battle. Fleets that run out of ammo can still fight but may only deal half damage.<ref name=\"rpgsarticle\" />\n\n[[File:Azur Lane battle screen.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Battle interface of ''Azur Lane''.]]\nWhen battling an enemy, players can use a virtual [[joystick]] to control the front row, which can automatically fire shells at targets and manually launch torpedoes. While stationary, the back row can send [[Barrage (artillery)|shell barrages]] and the player can manually call in airstrikes. These will activate a bullet-clearing effect, removing all projectiles and torpedoes on screen. Players have an auto mode option to give up this control to the game's AI. Characters' [[health (gaming)|health]] is fully replenished when completing or exiting a map. Morale points are deducted for each fleet character in a battle. Should a character fall in battle, they cannot join in further action on the map and a larger number of morale points are deducted for the fallen character at the end of the battle. Sustained low morale for a character decreases their stats and affection points. Low affection points lead the character to greet the player with vocals reflecting their disappointment.<ref name=\"rpgsarticle\" />\n\nThe game features a [[player versus player]] mode. The player may prepare a defence fleet and organize an offence fleet to challenge opposing players' defence fleets. In this mode, battles are controlled entirely by AI, and the bullet-clearing effect of airstrikes is disabled. Tokens can be gained and the player's ranking can rise through victory in this mode. Players receive no penalty if they lose a challenge or their defence fleet is defeated by other players. Exclusive characters and other items can be obtained using tokens.

The game features an eponymous military alliance, \"Azur Lane\", formed by nations of Eagle Union ([[United States]]), Royal Navy ([[United Kingdom]]), Sakura Empire ([[Empire of Japan]]) and Iron Blood ([[Nazi Germany]]).<ref name=\"rpgsarticle\" /> The alliance split in two because of [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien intervention]] with Iron Blood and Sakura Empire form an opposing faction, \"Crimson [[Axis powers|Axis]]\", using technology provided by the aliens to invade \"Azur Lane\" countries. The rest of the game's main plot partially follows the United States naval engagements in the [[Pacific War]]. Chapters represent several decisive battles of the war including the [[Battle of Midway]], the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], and the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]].\n\n== Characters ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Character!!Japanese<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://azurlane-anime.jp/character/|title=CHARACTER|website=Azur Lane Official Website|accessdate=October 25, 2019|language=Japanese}}</ref>!!English<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.funimation.com/forum/topic/19202/master-thread-azur-lane-dubbed|title=[Master Thread] AZUR LANE (Dubbed)|last=Funimation|first=|date=|website=www.funimation.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|Enterprise]]||[[Yui Ishikawa]]||Rachael Messer\n|-\n|[[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|Akagi]]||[[Mai Nakahara]]||[[Amber Lee Connors]]\n|-\n|[[HMS Unicorn (I72)|Unicorn]]||[[Ai Kakuma]]||[[Alexis Tipton]]\n|-\n|[[HMS Javelin (F61)|Javelin]]||Nozomi Yamane||Madeleine Morris\n|-\n|[[USS Laffey (DD-459)|Laffey]]||[[Maria Naganawa]]||[[Tia Ballard]]\n|-\n|[[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|Kaga]]||[[Ai Kayano]]||Dawn M.

Enterprise remains on watch, despite her repairs only being partially complete. Akagi and Kaga are also recovering from the battle when they are met by [[German cruiser Prinz Eugen|Prinz Eugen]]. Akagi sends [[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|Zuikaku]] and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dkaku|Shoukaku]] to ambush an Azur Lane fleet and asks Prinz Eugen to assist them. Prinz Eugen agrees, bringing [[German destroyer Z23|Z23]] and Ayanami with her.

Enterprise mobilizes to help them despite her damage, with Cleveland, Javelin, and Laffey following her. While Enterprise battles Zuikaku and Shoukaku and Cleveland assists damaged shipgirls, Javelin and Laffey remain reluctant to fight Z23 and Ayanami. As the Azur Lane and Red Axis forces battle each other, the main Royal Navy fleet led by [[HMS Queen Elizabeth (1913)|Queen Elizabeth]] arrives. Enterprise manages to gain the upper hand on Zuikaku but her unrepaired damage causes her equipment to fail at a critical moment.

Meanwhile, [[USS Vestal|Vestal]] arrives on the base and is immediately upset at the poor state Enterprise's rig is in. Enterprise is met by Belfast and Unicorn, who convince her to attend a beach party the other shipgirls are holding. Unicorn thanks Enterprise for saving her, and Enterprise reveals she feels shipgirls are only meant to be weapons, and the ocean is only a source of conflict. As Unicorn leaves to play with Javelin and Laffey, Belfast confronts Enterprise directly, warning her that if she continues to fight like she did in the previous battle, she'll eventually forget her reason for fighting in the first place. The base then receives a distress call, with Enterprise, Cleveland, Hammann, and Belfast leaving to investigate. They find [[Chinese cruiser Ning Hai|Ning Hai]] and [[Chinese cruiser Ping Hai|Ping Hai]] of the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Dragon Empery]]. They explain they were ambushed by Siren ships when a damaged Siren ship attacks. Enterprise uses herself as a distraction to draw the Siren's attention, but ends up being saved by Belfast when her rig malfunctions again.

Javelin and Laffey take a bath with Unicorn, who reveals she's self conscious about her large breasts despite her small size.

Set in an [[alternate timeline]] of [[World War II]], players engage in side-scrolling shooter gameplay, using female [[moe anthropomorphism|moe anthropomorphic]] characters based on [[warships]] from the war's major participants. Other gameplay elements, like customizing a home and marrying in-game characters, are also present.\n\nFirst launched in China in May and in Japan in September 2017, ''Azur Lane'' has briefly become very popular, especially in Japan where the player count reached five million within four months after its release. Successive [[Comiket]] numbers have yet to confirm long-term popularity of the game in Japan, with Azur Lane ranking around 10th below franchises and genres like ''[[Fate Grand Order]]'', ''[[Kantai Collection]]'' or Virtual YouTubers. Players have voted the game among the top five on [[Google Play]]'s Best Game of 2017 list for the region. Critics have attributed the game's popularity to its original and well-designed gameplay system. An English-language version started open beta in August 2018 and was formally released in May 2019. Later, on December 18, English version was expanded to Latin American region. PWB Play simultaneously released it to [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], and [[Taiwan]] on October 4, 2019.\n\nThe game has been adapted into several manga and novelizations. ''Azur Lane Crosswave'', a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] adaptation for [[PlayStation 4]], was published by [[Compile Heart]] on August 29, 2019 with mixed reception. ''Crosswave''<nowiki/>'s English localization was released on February 13, 2020 for PlayStation 4 and PC. An [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Bibury Animation Studio]] premiered on October 3, 2019 and aired until March 20, 2020.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2018/09/15-1/ship-girl-smart-phone-game-azur-lane-sets-sail-as-a-tv-anime|title=Ship Girl Smart Phone Game Azur Lane Sets Sail as a TV Anime|access-date=April 1, 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Azur Lane main screen.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Main interface, with the character ''[[USS Long Island (CVE-1)|Long Island]]''.

[[Destroyer]]s, [[light cruiser]]s, and [[heavy cruiser]]s can be allotted to the front row, while the back row is reserved for [[battleship]]s, [[aircraft cruiser]], [[monitor (warship)|monitor]]s, [[repair ship]]s, [[battlecruiser]]s and [[aircraft carrier]]s. Different combinations of ships are required to achieve victory in different battle situations. Players may then select and enter a [[level (video gaming)|map]].<ref name=rpgsarticle/>\n\nOn entering a map, the player's fleet is placed on a grid-like map similar to that in the game [[Battleship (game)|Battleship]]. The map contains nodes, which are either combat nodes which are enemy fleets, some immobile and others that pursue the player, or non-combat nodes which provides ammunition or mystery nodes which can provide supplies such as repair kits, upgrade materials or can spawn a special combat node called a Treasure Fleet. Players must navigate optimally and assemble their fleets tactically, to clear obstructing enemies and, using minimal movements, reach the map's [[boss (video gaming)|boss]]. When the player moves their fleet across the map, they can be ambushed in [[random encounter]]s from which they may take damage, or they can be forced to engage the enemy, using fuel and ammo. Fuel is one of the two in-game resources. Ammo points are assigned to player fleets at each map, with one ammo point deducted at each battle. Fleets that run out of ammo can still fight but may only deal half damage.<ref name=\"rpgsarticle\" />\n\n[[File:Azur Lane battle screen.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Battle interface of ''Azur Lane''.]]\nWhen battling an enemy, players can use a virtual [[joystick]] to control the front row, which can automatically fire shells at targets and manually launch torpedoes. While stationary, the back row can send [[Barrage (artillery)|shell barrages]] and the player can manually call in airstrikes. These will activate a bullet-clearing effect, removing all projectiles and torpedoes on screen. Players have an auto mode option to give up this control to the game's AI. Characters' [[health (gaming)|health]] is fully replenished when completing or exiting a map. Morale points are deducted for each fleet character in a battle. Should a character fall in battle, they cannot join in further action on the map and a larger number of morale points are deducted for the fallen character at the end of the battle. Sustained low morale for a character decreases their stats and affection points. Low affection points lead the character to greet the player with vocals reflecting their disappointment.<ref name=\"rpgsarticle\" />\n\nThe game features a [[player versus player]] mode. The player may prepare a defence fleet and organize an offence fleet to challenge opposing players' defence fleets. In this mode, battles are controlled entirely by AI, and the bullet-clearing effect of airstrikes is disabled. Tokens can be gained and the player's ranking can rise through victory in this mode. Players receive no penalty if they lose a challenge or their defence fleet is defeated by other players. Exclusive characters and other items can be obtained using tokens. The ranking is refreshed every 15 days.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Exercise|title=Exercise|work=Azur Lane Wiki|access-date=October 28, 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nAdditional mechanics were introduced after the game's release. [[Submarine warfare|Submarine]] and [[anti-submarine warfare]] systems were introduced in May 2018.

Furniture and decorations raise the rate experience is gained. They can be arranged freely. Players may increase Dormitory character capacity, unlock a second floor which recovers morale, and buy special interactive furniture using the in-game currency.  As well, monuments can be awarded by clearing event stages. Players may inspect other players' Dormitories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://criticalindex.net/first-impressions-an-initial-look-at-azur-lane-31b7d2a443e|title=First Impressions: An Initial Look at Azur Lane|last=Ana|first=Ren|date=December 27, 2017|website=Critical Index|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=June 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Marriage===\nWhen a character's affection points are raised to 100 through battle, secretary, or Dormitory, players may choose to give a \"promise ring\" to this character. A \"promise ring\" can be obtained through quests once. Additional rings can be purchased using in-game currency in the items shop, essentially allowing [[polygamy]].<ref name=Siliconera_20171009/> Players may also give customized names to married characters but may only do so every 30 days for each character.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mmorpg.news/2018/09/azur-lane-oath-marriage-and-first-event.html|title=Azur Lane - Oath (Marriage) and First Event on Global|website=www.mmorpg.news|access-date=October 17, 2018}}</ref> Furthermore, a few of the most popular characters will also gain unique wedding dress costumes for the wedding. They will also gain additional stat bonuses after being married.<ref name=\"Siliconera_20171009\" />\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe start of the game features an anthropomorphic recreation of the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]], where the personification of famed British battlecruiser [[HMS Hood|HMS ''Hood'']] is sunk by characters representing the German forces. The game features an eponymous military alliance, \"Azur Lane\", formed by nations of Eagle Union ([[United States]]), Royal Navy ([[United Kingdom]]), Sakura Empire ([[Empire of Japan]]) and Iron Blood ([[Nazi Germany]]).<ref name=\"rpgsarticle\" /> The alliance split in two because of [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien intervention]] with Iron Blood and Sakura Empire form an opposing faction, \"Crimson [[Axis powers|Axis]]\", using technology provided by the aliens to invade \"Azur Lane\" countries. The rest of the game's main plot partially follows the United States naval engagements in the [[Pacific War]]. Chapters represent several decisive battles of the war including the [[Battle of Midway]], the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], and the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]].\n\n== Characters ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Character!!Japanese<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://azurlane-anime.jp/character/|title=CHARACTER|website=Azur Lane Official Website|accessdate=October 25, 2019|language=Japanese}}</ref>!!English<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.funimation.com/forum/topic/19202/master-thread-azur-lane-dubbed|title=[Master Thread] AZUR LANE (Dubbed)|last=Funimation|first=|date=|website=www.funimation.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|Enterprise]]||[[Yui Ishikawa]]||Rachael Messer\n|-\n|[[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|Akagi]]||[[Mai Nakahara]]||[[Amber Lee Connors]]\n|-\n|[[HMS Unicorn (I72)|Unicorn]]||[[Ai Kakuma]]||[[Alexis Tipton]]\n|-\n|[[HMS Javelin (F61)|Javelin]]||Nozomi Yamane||Madeleine Morris\n|-\n|[[USS Laffey (DD-459)|Laffey]]||[[Maria Naganawa]]||[[Tia Ballard]]\n|-\n|[[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|Kaga]]||[[Ai Kayano]]||Dawn M.

Meanwhile, [[USS Vestal|Vestal]] arrives on the base and is immediately upset at the poor state Enterprise's rig is in. Enterprise is met by Belfast and Unicorn, who convince her to attend a beach party the other shipgirls are holding. Unicorn thanks Enterprise for saving her, and Enterprise reveals she feels shipgirls are only meant to be weapons, and the ocean is only a source of conflict. As Unicorn leaves to play with Javelin and Laffey, Belfast confronts Enterprise directly, warning her that if she continues to fight like she did in the previous battle, she'll eventually forget her reason for fighting in the first place. The base then receives a distress call, with Enterprise, Cleveland, Hammann, and Belfast leaving to investigate. They find [[Chinese cruiser Ning Hai|Ning Hai]] and [[Chinese cruiser Ping Hai|Ping Hai]] of the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Dragon Empery]]. They explain they were ambushed by Siren ships when a damaged Siren ship attacks.

When Enterprise touches it, she receives a brief vision what appears to be an alternate version of herself. Returning her attention to the base, Enterprise is surprised at how lively it is with new arrivals like Akashi, Ping Hai, and Ning Hai setting up shops. Belfast reminds Enterprise that shipgirls are humans as well, which is something she must learn to embrace. Javelin and Laffey take a bath with Unicorn, who reveals she's self conscious about her large breasts despite her small size. They reassure her that every shipgirl's body is different, and she should be proud of her own. That night, the three of them reaffirm their desire to befriend Ayanami. At the Sakura Empire, Prinz Eugen tries to sow distrust between Kaga and Akagi by suggesting to Kaga that Akagi has differing motives from hers. Akagi meanwhile expresses her desire to reunite with [[Amagi-class battlecruiser|Amagi]].\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 7\n| Title               = DEADLINE - For Determination, For Love\n| TranslitTitle       =\u3010Shisen\u3011 Ketsui to, Ai no Tame ni\n| NativeTitle         =\u3010\u6b7b\u7dda\u3011\u6c7a\u610f\u3068\u3001\u611b\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|11|21}} (Japan)<br>{{Start date|2019|12|12}} (US)\n| ShortSummary        = Azur Lane and the Sakura Empire prepare to face each other in a decisive naval battle, sending their largest fleets.

However, Orochi is protected by an impenetrable shield, and the shipgirls are unable to inflict any damage. While unconscious, Enterprise encounters her alternate self again, who warns her conflict between shipgirls is inevitable since they are manifestations of human will like Orochi, but Enterprise decides to keep fighting to protect everybody important to her.
