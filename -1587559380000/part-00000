It was released on June 9, 2009, by [[Downtown Records]]. After venturing further away from [[hip hop music|hip hop]] with an acting career and two poorly received albums, Mos Def signed a recording contract with Downtown and recorded ''The Ecstatic'' primarily at the [[Record Plant]] in Los Angeles. He worked with producers such as Preservation, [[Mr. Flash]], [[Oh No (rapper)|Oh No]], and [[Madlib]], the latter two of whom reused instrumentals they had produced on [[Stones Throw Records]]. Singer [[Georgia Anne Muldrow]], formerly of the record label, was one of the album's few guest vocalists, along with rappers [[Slick Rick]] and [[Talib Kweli]]. For its front cover, a still from [[Charles Burnett (director)|Charles Burnett]]'s 1978 film ''[[Killer of Sheep]]'' was reproduced in red tint.\n\nThe album has been described by music journalists as a [[conscious hip hop|conscious]] and [[alternative hip hop]] record with an eccentric, internationalist quality. Mos Def's raps about global politics, love, spirituality, and social conditions are informed by the [[zeitgeist]] of the late [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], Black [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], and [[Pan-Islamic]] ideas, incorporating a number of Islamic references throughout the album. Its loosely structured, lightly [[reverberation|reverbed]] songs use unconventional [[time signature]]s and [[sampling (music)|samples]] taken from a variety of international musical styles, including [[Afrobeat]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[Eurodance]], [[jazz]], [[reggae]], [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]], and [[Middle Eastern music]]. Mos Def titled ''The Ecstatic'' after one of his favorite novels, the 2002 [[Victor LaValle]] book, believing its titular phrase evoked his singular creative vision for the album.\n\n''The Ecstatic'' charted at number nine on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in its first week of release and eventually sold 168,000 copies. Its sales benefited from its presence on Internet blogs and the release of a T-shirt illustrating the record's packaging alongside a label printed with a code redeemable for a free download of the album. A widespread critical success, ''The Ecstatic'' was viewed as a return to form for Mos Def and one of the year's best albums. He embarked on an international tour to support the record, performing concerts in North America, Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom between September and April 2010. As his [[disc jockey|DJ]] on the tour, Preservation began to develop remixes of the album's songs, which he later released on the [[remix album]] ''The REcstatic'' in 2013.\n\n== Background ==\nIn 2006, Mos Def's third album ''[[True Magic]]'' was released haphazardly by [[Geffen Records]] to fulfill a contractual obligation while he was devoting more time to his acting career.<ref>{{harvnb|Samuel|2009}}; {{harvnb|Huff|2009}}.</ref> The quality of the album, along with his repeated ventures away from recording [[hip hop music|hip hop]], left \"some fans wondering if Mos Def's acting accomplishments were finally affecting his music\", ''[[PopMatters]]'' critic Quentin B. Huff later wrote.{{sfn|Huff|2009}} Speaking with [[Spank Rock]] for ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine, Mos Def elucidated his artistic endeavors at the time: \"You have to experience life, make observations, ask questions. It's machine-like how things are run in hip-hop now, and my ambitions are different{{nbsp}}... To me the job of an artist is to provide a useful and intelligent vocabulary for the world to be able to articulate feelings they experience every day.\"{{sfn|Anon.|2009a}} After ending his tenure on Geffen, he signed a record deal with [[Downtown Records]] before recording ''The Ecstatic'' as his first album for the label.{{sfn|Samuel|2009}}\n\n== Recording and production ==\n[[File:Mosdef (300dpi).jpg|left|thumb|Mos Def in 2008|alt=A man holding a microphone, dressed in jeans, white dress shirt and tie, shown from the side]]\n''The Ecstatic'' was mostly recorded in sessions at the [[Record Plant]] in Los Angeles; the songs \"Twilight Speedball\", \"No Hay Nada Mas\", and \"Roses\" were partially recorded at Hovercraft Studios in Virginia Beach, Someothaship Connect in Los Angeles, and New York City's [[Downtown Music Studios]].{{sfn|Anon.(f)|n.d.}}\n\nMos Def worked with producers [[Mr. Flash]], [[Oh No (rapper)|Oh No]], [[Madlib]], and Preservation, who previously produced some of ''True Magic''{{'}}s songs. For ''The Ecstatic'', Oh No reused some of his productions from his 2007 album ''[[Dr. No's Oxperiment]]'', while Madlib incorporated samples from his ''[[Beat Konducta|Beat Konducta in India]]'' (2007) record. For \"Life in Marvelous Times\", Mr. Flash reused the beat from \"Champions\" \u2013 his 2006 collaboration with the French hip hop group [[TTC (band)|TTC]] \u2013 while \"History\" used a beat produced by [[J Dilla]] before his death.{{sfn|Patrin|2009}}\n\nWith Preservation, Mos Def produced \"Casa Bey\" after a 2006 trip to [[Rio de Janeiro]], where local rapper [[MV Bill]] introduced him to the music of [[Banda Black Rio]]. Mos Def and Preservation altered one of the band's songs \u2013 \"Casa Forte\", an instrumental featuring their characteristic blend of [[funk]], [[jazz]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[Music of Brazil|Brazilian rhythms]] \u2013 and used it as the beat.{{sfn|Richard|2009}} The original song title \u2013 meaning \"strong house\" in Portuguese \u2013 was changed to \"Casa Bey\"; Bey was Mos Def's family surname. According to him, he tried to enlist rappers [[Jay Electronica]], [[Black Thought]], and [[David Jude Jolicoeur|Trugoy]] for the song, but they all found it too difficult to rap over the instrumental.{{sfn|Anon.|2009a}}\n\nMos Def collaborated with singer [[Georgia Anne Muldrow]] and rappers [[Slick Rick]] and [[Talib Kweli]] \u2013 his partner in the rap duo [[Black Star (rap duo)|Black Star]].<ref>{{harvnb|Anon.(h)|n.d.}}; {{harvnb|Jones|2009}}.</ref> Muldrow sang and played piano on \"Roses\", which she originally wrote and recorded in 2008 for her album ''Umsindo'' (2009). She said Mos Def \"borrowed\" the song for ''The Ecstatic'' after they met through a mutual friend. \"They came over one day and started playing 'Roses.' He was singing the song and knew it. He said 'I wanna grab that.' I said, 'Man, I already got this as a single'. He just wanted that song. He snatched it up real quick\", she recalled in laughter.{{sfn|Anon.|2009b}}\n\nAlong with Madlib, Oh No, and J Dilla, Muldrow had been an affiliate of [[Stones Throw Records]]; according to journalist [[Nathan Rabin]], they collectively produced half of the album, lending its sound a \"sympathetic\" quality.{{sfn|Rabin|2009}} With ''The Ecstatic'', Mos Def said he wanted to offer listeners sincere, uninhibited observations about life and love, \"some truth and positive heart lift\", without the need for club songs. \"No disrespect to [the club]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Anon.|2009a}}; {{harvnb|Gundersen|2009}}.</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n{{Listen|pos = right\n |filename    = Auditorium - Mos Def.ogg\n |title       = \"Auditorium\"\n |description = On \"Auditorium\", Mos Def raps about daily struggles and global politics over a [[Middle Eastern music|Middle Eastern]]-influenced instrumental produced by [[Madlib]].{{sfn|Slavik|2009}}\n}}\n''The Ecstatic'' covers an international range of styles in a very loose and extemporaneous manner, held together by what Rabin described as \"a lyrical and sonic fascination with life beyond the Western World\".<ref>{{harvnb|Patrin|2009}}; {{harvnb|Rabin|2009}}.</ref> According to [[Robert Christgau]], the album's songs generally average two-and-a-half minutes and segue into one another without [[resolution (music)|resolution]], giving it the feel of a globally influenced hip hop [[mixtape]], \"with poles in [[Brooklyn]] and [[Beirut]]\".{{sfn|Christgau|2009}} The record reflects Mos Def's varied interests in [[jazz]], poetry, [[Eastern music|Eastern]] rhythms, [[psychedelia]], [[Spanish music]], and the [[blues]].{{sfn|Stewart|2009}} The tracks on the first half are, as ''[[The Observer]]''{{'}}s Ben Thompson described, \"predominantly eastward-looking\", while the second half indulges more in [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]] and [[reggae]] influences.{{sfn|Thompson|2009}} Other sounds sampled or explored include [[Afrobeat]] (\"Quiet Dog Bite Hard\"), [[Eurodance]] (\"Life in Marvelous Times\"), [[Bollywood]] (\"Supermagic\"), and [[Philadelphia soul]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kot|2009}}; {{harvnb|Patrin|2009}}; {{harvnb|Kellman|n.d.}}.</ref> \"Supermagic\" also draws on elements from Turkish [[acid rock]] and ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', while on \"No Hay Nada Mas\", Mos Def sings and raps in Spanish over a [[flamenco]]-influenced production.<ref>{{harvnb|Kot|2009}}; {{harvnb|Patrin|2009}}; {{harvnb|Stewart|2009}}.</ref> He sings elsewhere on the album, often breaking into sing-song [[vamp (music)|vamps]] during his raps.<ref>{{harvnb|Kot|2009}}; {{harvnb|Patrin|2009}}.</ref> Along with Mos Def's singing, the predominantly sample-based music is unconventional in its use of what Preservation said are unusual [[time signature]]s and \"awkward\" [[breakdown (music)|breakdowns]].{{sfn|Balfour|2013}}\n\nAccording to ''[[The Independent]]''{{'}}s Simmy Richman, ''The Ecstatic''{{'}}s Eastern-influenced musical backdrop was reflective of Mos Def's \"post-[[War on Terror]]\" themes; Richman called it a [[conscious rap]] record, and ''No Ripcord''{{'}}s Ryan Faughnder regarded the music as \"socially conscious alternative hip-hop\".<ref>{{harvnb|Richman|2009}}; {{harvnb|Faughnder|2009}}.</ref> Mos Def incorporated a number of Islamic references onto the album, including samples of American Muslim activist [[Malcolm X]], Turkish protest singer [[Selda Ba\u011fcan]], and an Arab-language scene from the 1966 film ''[[The Battle of Algiers]]''; additionally, the track \"Wahid\" was titled after the Arabic word for \"oneness\". African-American studies and media scholar Sohail Daulatzai believed ''The Ecstatic'' is informed by Black [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist politics]] and [[Pan-Islamic]] ideas, while ''[[State (magazine)|State]]'' magazine's Niall Byrne said it explores the theme of [[international relations]] on songs such as the [[Middle Eastern music|Middle Eastern]]-influenced \"The Embassy\" and \"Auditorium\", which features an [[Iraq]]-themed guest rap by Slick Rick.{{sfn|Daulatzai|2012|p=132}} On the former track, Mos Def raps from the perspective of an outsider about the lifestyle of an [[ambassador]] at a luxury hotel, while the opening song \"Supermagic\" critiques government treatment of [[minority groups]].<ref>{{harvnb|Christgau|2009}}; {{harvnb|Byrne|2009}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|2015}}.</ref>\n\n{{quote box|quoted = 1|quote=You're living at a time of extremism, a time of revolution, a time when there's got to be a change.

On \"Roses\", Muldrow sings [[Environmentally friendly|nature-friendly]] lyrics about drawing flowers in times of sadness rather than plucking them from the ground. \"Roses is about creativity and human capacity\", she explained. \"A lot of times Western society makes [women] base our sense of worth on 'diamonds are forever' or 'a dozen roses' and that's how you prove your love to somebody{{nbsp}}\u2026 but you receive so many gifts and still feel empty.

This stretch of concerts saw the rapper play a number of US and Canadian cities, including Chicago, Miami, Washington D.C., Miami, Portland, Calgary, and Vancouver. Jay Electronica performed as his [[opening act]], and certain shows were [[Headliner (performances)|co-headlined]] with Kweli and singer [[Erykah Badu]].{{sfn|Dantana|2009}} The leg concluded on October 3 with an evening performance slot at the [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]].{{sfn|Keyes|2009}} Mos Def continued touring into the following year, playing a series of concerts in Japan during late 2009, which were documented in an episode of the [[Current TV]] series ''Embedded''. This was followed by his first headlining tour of Australia in January 2010 and a short series of April concerts in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{harvnb|Murray|2010}}; {{harvnb|Maness|2009}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|2010a}}.</ref>\n\n== Photo exhibition ==\nBetween January 30 and February 6, 2010, the HVW8 Art & Design Gallery in Los Angeles held an exclusive one-week exhibition titled \"Mos Def: Ecstatic Moments \u2013 Photographs\". It showcased a collection of photos taken by Cognito \u2013 a longtime hip hop documentarian and colleague of Mos Def \u2013 capturing the rapper during the two years spent making and promoting ''The Ecstatic''. Included in the exhibition were [[candid photograph]]s of him in the studio with the album's producers, and photos of his experiences visiting and touring locations around the world, including the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]]. A series of \"posse shots\" taken at the end of concerts from the American tour were also displayed, showing the rapper with Jay Electronica, Kweli, Badu, and musician [[Shuggie Otis]], who made an unexpected appearance during the tour.{{sfn|Anon.|2010b}}\n\nThe timing of the exhibition was meant to capitalize on Mos Def's two nominations for the Grammy Awards, which were being held that week, Cognito explained: \"I thought it was a perfect time to honor his presence while he's here. We've had a lot of our greats pass away in the past couple of years, be it Dilla or [[Slum Village|Bataan]] [''[[sic]]''], or whoever, and now everybody wants to talk 'Dilla Dilla Dilla' or whatever, but you weren't saying that while he was alive.

He challenged himself to remix the rest of the record, taking more than a year, as a project called ''The REcstatic'', working with Jan Fairchild, the original album's [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing engineer]].<ref>{{harvnb|Balfour|2013}}; {{harvnb|Lamb|2013}}.</ref> Preservation revisited sources for the original beats to find similar recordings that would correspond to each song's particular aesthetic while preserving Mos Def's vocals for the remixes.{{sfn|Lamb|2013}} He wanted them to be sample-based and consistent in [[key (music)|key]], [[pitch (music)|pitch]], and [[musical tone|tone]] to the first album, which he found difficult to achieve because of the original music's unorthodox instrumentals and singing. \"It's the result of countless hours of digging through records to sample\", he recalled. \"Constructing the beat, wrapping it around the vocal, adjusting the tempo, and so on\".{{sfn|Lamb|2013}} \"Black Fantastic\", an outtake produced by Minnesota during ''The Ecstatic''{{'}}s recording, replaced \"Casa Bey\" in the final track listing, as Preservation had found the tempo and structure of the original song too difficult to make a satisfactory remix.{{sfn|Balfour|2013}}\n\n''The REcstatic'' was released as a free download on June 12, 2013, by Preservation's [[imprint label]], Mon Dieu Music.{{sfn|Balfour|2013}} Reviewing the [[remix album]] in ''[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]'', Samuel Diamond said the rapturous energy of the original record was given a \"slightly rougher texture\" on what he deemed \"a respectful contribution to the canon of remix-based art, something that can be said for very few modern rap 'remixes'\".{{sfn|Diamond|2013}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Track listing ==\nCredits are adapted from [[Downtown Music]].{{sfn|Anon.(f)|n.d.}}\n\n{{track listing\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n| title1 = Supermagic\n| writer1 = [[Mos Def|Dante Smith]], [[Oh No (musician)|Michael Jackson]]\n| extra1 = Oh No\n| length1 = 2:32\n| title2 = Twilite Speedball\n| writer2 = Smith, [[Chad Hugo]]\n| extra2 = [[The Neptunes]], Mos Def\n| length2 = 3:02\n| title3 = Auditorium\n| note3 = featuring [[Slick Rick]]\n| writer3 = Smith, [[Madlib|Otis Jackson Jr.]], [[Slick Rick|Richard Walters]]\n| extra3 = Madlib, Mos Def\n| length3 = 4:34\n| title4 = Wahid\n| writer4 = Smith, O.

It was released on June 9, 2009, by [[Downtown Records]]. After venturing further away from [[hip hop music|hip hop]] with an acting career and two poorly received albums, Mos Def signed a recording contract with Downtown and recorded ''The Ecstatic'' primarily at the [[Record Plant]] in Los Angeles. He worked with producers such as Preservation, [[Mr. Flash]], [[Oh No (rapper)|Oh No]], and [[Madlib]], the latter two of whom reused instrumentals they had produced on [[Stones Throw Records]]. Singer [[Georgia Anne Muldrow]], formerly of the record label, was one of the album's few guest vocalists, along with rappers [[Slick Rick]] and [[Talib Kweli]]. For its front cover, a still from [[Charles Burnett (director)|Charles Burnett]]'s 1978 film ''[[Killer of Sheep]]'' was reproduced in red tint.\n\nThe album has been described by music journalists as a [[conscious hip hop|conscious]] and [[alternative hip hop]] record with an eccentric, internationalist quality. Mos Def's raps about global politics, love, spirituality, and social conditions are informed by the [[zeitgeist]] of the late [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], Black [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], and [[Pan-Islamic]] ideas, incorporating a number of Islamic references throughout the album. Its loosely structured, lightly [[reverberation|reverbed]] songs use unconventional [[time signature]]s and [[sampling (music)|samples]] taken from a variety of international musical styles, including [[Afrobeat]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[Eurodance]], [[jazz]], [[reggae]], [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]], and [[Middle Eastern music]]. Mos Def titled ''The Ecstatic'' after one of his favorite novels, the 2002 [[Victor LaValle]] book, believing its titular phrase evoked his singular creative vision for the album.\n\n''The Ecstatic'' charted at number nine on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in its first week of release and eventually sold 168,000 copies. Its sales benefited from its presence on Internet blogs and the release of a T-shirt illustrating the record's packaging alongside a label printed with a code redeemable for a free download of the album. A widespread critical success, ''The Ecstatic'' was viewed as a return to form for Mos Def and one of the year's best albums. He embarked on an international tour to support the record, performing concerts in North America, Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom between September and April 2010. As his [[disc jockey|DJ]] on the tour, Preservation began to develop remixes of the album's songs, which he later released on the [[remix album]] ''The REcstatic'' in 2013.\n\n== Background ==\nIn 2006, Mos Def's third album ''[[True Magic]]'' was released haphazardly by [[Geffen Records]] to fulfill a contractual obligation while he was devoting more time to his acting career.<ref>{{harvnb|Samuel|2009}}; {{harvnb|Huff|2009}}.</ref> The quality of the album, along with his repeated ventures away from recording [[hip hop music|hip hop]], left \"some fans wondering if Mos Def's acting accomplishments were finally affecting his music\", ''[[PopMatters]]'' critic Quentin B.

Just as \"500 in the year\" is not good English syntax, neither is 500 AD; whereas \"AD 500\" preserves syntactic order when translated.<ref>''Chicago Manual of Style'' 2010, pp. 476\u20137; Goldstein 2007, p. 6.</ref>}} However, BC is placed after the year number (for example: AD&nbsp;{{CURRENTYEAR}}, but 68&nbsp;BC), which also preserves syntactic order. The abbreviation is also widely used after the number of a century or [[millennium]], as in \"fourth century AD\" or \"second millennium AD\" (although conservative usage formerly rejected such expressions).<ref>''Chicago Manual of Style,'' 1993, p. 304.</ref> Because BC is the English abbreviation for ''Before Christ'', it is sometimes incorrectly concluded that AD means ''After Death'', i.e., after the death of Jesus. However, this would mean that the approximate 33 years commonly associated with the life of Jesus would be included in neither the BC nor the AD time scales.<ref>Donald P. Ryan, (2000), 15.</ref>\n\nTerminology that is viewed by some as being more neutral and inclusive of non-Christian people is to call this the Current or [[Common Era]] (abbreviated as CE), with the preceding years referred to as Before the Common or Current Era (BCE). [[Astronomical year numbering]] and [[ISO 8601]] avoid words or abbreviations related to Christianity, but use the same numbers for AD years.\n\n== History ==\nThe ''Anno Domini'' dating system was devised in 525 by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] to enumerate the years in his [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Easter table]]. His system was to replace the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian era]] that had been used in an old [[Easter table]] because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who [[Diocletianic Persecution|persecuted Christians]].{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=767}} The last year of the old table, Diocletian [[Era of the Martyrs|Anno Martyrium]] 247, was immediately followed by the first year of his table, Anno Domini 532. When he devised his table, [[Julian calendar]] years were identified by naming the consuls who held office that year\u2014he himself stated that the \"present year\" was \"the consulship of [[Flavius Anicius Probus Iunior|Probus Junior]]\", which was 525 years \"since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20161226031734/http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm Nineteen year cycle of Dionysius] Introduction and First Argumentum.</ref> Thus Dionysius implied that [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Jesus' incarnation]] occurred 525 years earlier, without stating the specific year during which his birth or conception occurred. \"However, nowhere in his exposition of his table does Dionysius relate his epoch to any other dating system, whether consulate, [[Olympiad]], [[Anno Mundi|year of the world]], or [[regnal year]] of Augustus; much less does he explain or justify the underlying date.\"{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=778}}\n\n[[Bonnie J. Blackburn]] and [[Leofranc Holford-Strevens]] briefly present arguments for 2 BC, 1 BC, or AD 1 as the year Dionysius intended for the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] or [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]]. Among the sources of confusion are:{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|pp=778\u20139}}\n* In modern times, [[incarnation]] is synonymous with the conception, but some ancient writers, such as [[Bede]], considered incarnation to be synonymous with the Nativity.\n* The civil or consular year began on 1 January but the Diocletian year began on 29 August (30 August in the year before a Julian leap year).\n* There were inaccuracies in the lists of consuls.\n* There were confused summations of emperors' regnal years.\n\nIt is not known how Dionysius established the year of Jesus's birth. Two major theories are that Dionysius based his calculation on the Gospel of Luke, which states that Jesus was \"about thirty years old\" shortly after \"the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar\", and hence subtracted thirty years from that date, or that Dionysius counted back 532 years from the first year of his new table.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Teres|first=Gustav|date=October 1984|title=Time computations and Dionysius Exiguus|journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy|volume=15|issue=3|pages=177\u2013188|bibcode=1984JHA....15..177T|doi=10.1177/002182868401500302}}</ref><ref>T\u00f8ndering, Claus, ''[http://www.tondering.dk/claus/cal/years.php The Calendar FAQ: Counting years]''</ref><ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0umDqPOf2L8C&pg=PA347 |last=Mosshammer|first=Alden A|title=The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era|location=Oxford|year=2009|pages=345\u2013347|isbn=9780191562365}}</ref>\nIt has also been speculated by Georges Declercq<ref>Declercq, Georges, \"Anno Domini. The Origins of the Christian Era\" Turnhout, Belgium, 2000</ref> that Dionysius' desire to replace Diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was intended to prevent people from believing the imminent [[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]]. At the time, it was believed by some that the [[resurrection of the dead]] and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus. The old ''[[Anno Mundi]]'' calendar theoretically commenced with the [[Dating creation|creation of the world]] based on information in the [[Old Testament]]. It was believed that, based on the ''Anno Mundi'' calendar, Jesus was born in the year 5500 (5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the ''Anno Mundi'' calendar marking the end of the world.<ref>Wallraff, Martin: Julius Africanus und die Christliche Weltchronik.

In the ''History'' he also used the [[Latin]] phrase ''ante [...] incarnationis dominicae tempus anno sexagesimo'' (\"in the sixtieth year before the time of the Lord's incarnation\"), which is equivalent to the English \"before Christ\", to identify years before the first year of this era.<ref>Bede 731, Book 1, Chapter 2, first sentence.</ref> Both Dionysius and Bede regarded ''Anno Domini'' as beginning at the incarnation of [[Jesus Christ]], but \"the distinction between Incarnation and Nativity was not drawn until the late 9th century, when in some places the Incarnation epoch was identified with Christ's conception, i. e., the Annunciation on March 25\" (\"Annunciation style\" dating).{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=881}}\n\n[[File:Charlemagne Agostino Cornacchini Vatican 2.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Charlemagne]] by [[Agostino Cornacchini]] (1725), at [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Vatican City. Charlemagne promoted the usage of the ''Anno Domini'' epoch throughout the [[Carolingian Empire]].]]\nOn the continent of Europe, ''Anno Domini'' was introduced as the era of choice of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] by the English cleric and scholar [[Alcuin]] in the late eighth century. Its endorsement by Emperor [[Charlemagne]] and [[List of Frankish Kings#Carolingian dynasty|his successors]] popularizing the use of the epoch and spreading it throughout the [[Carolingian Empire]] ultimately lies at the core of the system's prevalence. According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], popes continued to date documents according to [[regnal years]] for some time, but usage of AD gradually became more common in Catholic countries from the 11th to the 14th centuries.<ref name=CathEncy>Patrick, 1908</ref> In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last Western European country to [[Spanish era|switch to]] the system begun by Dionysius.<ref name=\"CathEncy-Chron\">\n{{cite book\n|chapter-url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03738a.htm\n|chapter=General Chronology\n|title=New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia\n|year=1908\n|volume=Vol III\n|publisher=[[Robert Appleton Company]] |location=New York\n|access-date=25 October 2011 }}\n</ref> [[Eastern Orthodox]] countries only began to adopt AD instead of the [[Byzantine calendar]] in 1700 when Russia did so, with others adopting it in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nAlthough ''Anno Domini'' was in widespread use by the 9th century, the term \"Before Christ\" (or its equivalent) did not become common until much later. Bede used the expression ''\"anno [...] ante incarnationem Dominicam\"'' (in the year before the incarnation of the Lord) twice. ''\"Anno ante Christi nativitatem\"'' (in the year before the birth of Christ) is found in 1474 in a work by a German monk.{{NoteTag|[[Werner Rolevinck]] in ''Fasciculus temporum'' (1474) used ''Anno ante xpi nativitatem'' (in the year before the birth of Christ) for all years between [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] and Jesus. \"xpi\" comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c7\u03c1 (''chr'') in visually Latin letters, together with the Latin ending -i, thus abbreviating ''Christi'' (\"of Christ\"). This phrase appears upside down in the centre of [[recto]] folios (right hand pages). From Jesus to [[Pope Sixtus IV]] he usually used ''Anno Christi'' or its abbreviated form ''Anno xpi'' (on [[verso]] folios\u2014left hand pages). He used ''Anno mundi'' alongside all of these terms for all years.}} In 1627, the French [[Jesuit]] theologian [[Denis P\u00e9tau]] (Dionysius Petavius in Latin), with his work ''De doctrina temporum'', popularized the usage ''ante Christum'' (Latin for \"Before Christ\") to mark years prior to AD.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|url = https://books.google.com/?id=fsni_qV-FJoC&pg=PA111#v=onepage&q=1627\n|title=Marking time: the epic quest to invent the perfect calendar\n|first=Duncan |last=Steel |author-link=Duncan Steel\n|page=114\n|accessdate=1 June 2010\n|isbn=978-0-471-29827-4\n|year=2000\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n|url = https://books.google.com/?id=A6nrL1XxpGYC&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33&dq=petau+%22ante+Christum%22&q=petau%20%22ante%20Christum%22\n|title=Measuring time, making history\n|first=Lynn Avery |last=Hunt\n|year=2008\n|page=33\n|accessdate=1 June 2010\n|isbn=978-963-9776-14-2\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n|url = https://books.google.com/?id=RRv0_NEpl-oC&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=petau+%22ante+Christum%22&q=ante%20Christum\n|title=search for \"ante Christum\" in a 1748 reprint of a 1633 abridgement entitled ''Rationarium temporum'' by Denis Petau\n|access-date=1 June 2010\n|last=Petau |first = Denis\n|year=1758\n}}</ref>\n\n===New year===\n{{See|New Year}}\n\nWhen the reckoning from Jesus' incarnation began replacing the previous dating systems in western Europe, various people chose different Christian feast days to begin the year: Christmas, [[Annunciation]], or Easter. Thus, depending on the time and place, the year number changed on different days in the year, which created slightly different styles in chronology:<ref>[[C. R. Cheney]], [http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/99027383.pdf ''A Handbook of Dates, for students of British history''], Cambridge University Press, 1945\u20132000, pp. 8\u201314.</ref>\n* From 25 March 753 [[Ab urbe condita|AUC]] (today in 1 BC), i.e., notionally from the incarnation of Jesus. That first \"Annunciation style\" appeared in [[Arles]] at the end of the 9th century, then spread to Burgundy and northern Italy. It was not commonly used and was called ''calculus pisanus'' since it was adopted in [[Pisa]] and survived there till 1750.\n* From 25 December 753 AUC (today in 1 BC), i.e., notionally from the birth of Jesus. It was called \"Nativity style\" and had been spread by Bede together with the ''Anno Domini'' in the early Middle Ages. That reckoning of the Year of Grace from Christmas was used in France, England and most of western Europe (except Spain) until the 12th century (when it was replaced by Annunciation style), and in Germany until the second quarter of the 13th century.\n* From 25 March 754 AUC (today in AD 1). That second \"Annunciation style\" may have originated in [[Fleury Abbey]] in the early 11th century, but it was spread by the Cistercians. [[Florence]] adopted that style in opposition to that of Pisa, so it got the name of ''calculus florentinus''. It soon spread in France and also in England where it became common in the late 12th century and lasted until 1752.\n* From Easter, starting in 754 AUC (AD 1). That ''mos gallicanus'' (French custom) bound to a [[moveable feast]] was introduced in France by king [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] (r. 1180\u20131223), maybe to establish a new style in the provinces reconquered from England. However, it never spread beyond the ruling \u00e9lite.\nWith these various styles, the same day could, in some cases, be dated in 1099, 1100 or 1101.\n\n== Birth date of Jesus ==\n{{see also|Date of birth of Jesus|Nativity of Jesus#Date of birth|Chronology of Jesus#Year of Jesus' birth}}\nThe date of birth of Jesus of Nazareth is not stated in the gospels or in any secular text, but most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 BC and 4 BC.<ref name=JDG324 >{{Cite journal | first = James DG | last = Dunn | title = Jesus Remembered | publisher = Eerdmans Publishing | year = 2003 | page = 324}}</ref> The historical evidence is too fragmentary to allow a definitive dating,<ref>Doggett 1992, p579: \"Although scholars generally believe that Christ was born some years before AD 1, the historical evidence is too sketchy to allow a definitive dating\".</ref> but the date is estimated through two different approaches \u2013 one by analyzing references to known historical events mentioned in the Nativity accounts in the Gospels of Luke and Matthew, and the second by working backwards from the estimation of the start of the [[ministry of Jesus]].<ref name=ChronosPaul >[[Paul L.

Systems in use included [[List of Roman consuls|consular dating]], imperial [[regnal year]] dating, and [[Anno Mundi|Creation dating]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}\n\nAlthough the last non-imperial consul, [[Anicius Faustus Albinus Basilius|Basilius]], was appointed in 541 by Emperor [[Justinian I]], later emperors through [[Constans II]] (641\u2013668) were appointed consuls on the first of January after their accession. All of these emperors, except Justinian, used imperial post-consular years for the years of their reign, along with their regnal years.<ref>Roger S. Bagnall and Klaas A. Worp, ''[https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/11125 Chronological Systems of Byzantine Egypt]'', Leiden, Brill, 2004.</ref> Long unused, this practice was not formally abolished until Novell XCIV of the law code of [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] did so in 888.\n\nAnother calculation had been developed by the [[Alexandria]]n monk [[Annianus of Alexandria|Annianus]] around the year AD 400, placing the Annunciation on 25 March AD 9 (Julian)\u2014eight to ten years after the date that Dionysius was to imply. Although this incarnation was popular during the early centuries of the [[Byzantine Empire]], years numbered from it, an ''Era of Incarnation'', were exclusively used and are still used in [[Ethiopia]]. This accounts for the seven- or eight-year discrepancy between the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] and [[Ethiopian calendar]]s. Byzantine chroniclers like [[Maximus the Confessor]], [[George Syncellus]], and [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] dated their years from Annianus' [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] of the world. This era, called ''[[Anno Mundi]]'', \"year of the world\" (abbreviated AM), by modern scholars, began its first year on 25 March 5492 BC. Later Byzantine chroniclers used ''Anno Mundi'' years from 1 September 5509 BC, the [[Byzantine calendar|Byzantine Era]]. No single ''Anno Mundi'' epoch was dominant throughout the [[Christian world]]. [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in his ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle]]'' used an era beginning with the birth of [[Abraham]], dated in 2016 BC (AD 1 = 2017 Anno Abrahami).<ref>Alfred von Gutschmid, ''Kleine Schriften'', F. Ruehl, Leipzig, 1889, p.&nbsp;433.</ref>\n\nSpain and Portugal continued to date by the [[Spanish Era]] (also called [[Era of the Caesars]]), which began counting from 38 BC, well into the Middle Ages. In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last Catholic country to adopt the ''Anno Domini'' system.<ref name=CathEncy/>\n\nThe [[Era of Martyrs]], which numbered years from the accession of [[Diocletian]] in 284, who launched the most severe [[persecution of Christians]], was used by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Church of Alexandria]] and is still used, officially, by the Coptic Orthodox and [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic Catholic]] churches. It was also used by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian]] church. Another system was to date from the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], which as early as [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]] and [[Tertullian]] was believed to have occurred in the consulate of the Gemini (AD 29), which appears in some [[Middle Ages|medieval]] manuscripts.\n\n== CE and BCE ==\n{{Main|Common Era}}\n\nAlternative names for the ''Anno Domini'' era include ''vulgaris aerae'' (found 1615 in Latin),<ref name=\"VulgarisAerae1\">\n{{cite book\n|quote=anno aerae nostrae vulgaris\n|author=Johannes Kepler\n|title=Joannis Keppleri Eclogae chronicae: ex epistolis doctissimorum aliquot virorum & suis mutuis, quibus examinantur tempora nobilissima: 1.

The abbreviation is also widely used after the number of a century or [[millennium]], as in \"fourth century AD\" or \"second millennium AD\" (although conservative usage formerly rejected such expressions).<ref>''Chicago Manual of Style,'' 1993, p. 304.</ref> Because BC is the English abbreviation for ''Before Christ'', it is sometimes incorrectly concluded that AD means ''After Death'', i.e., after the death of Jesus. However, this would mean that the approximate 33 years commonly associated with the life of Jesus would be included in neither the BC nor the AD time scales.<ref>Donald P. Ryan, (2000), 15.</ref>\n\nTerminology that is viewed by some as being more neutral and inclusive of non-Christian people is to call this the Current or [[Common Era]] (abbreviated as CE), with the preceding years referred to as Before the Common or Current Era (BCE). [[Astronomical year numbering]] and [[ISO 8601]] avoid words or abbreviations related to Christianity, but use the same numbers for AD years.\n\n== History ==\nThe ''Anno Domini'' dating system was devised in 525 by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] to enumerate the years in his [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Easter table]]. His system was to replace the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian era]] that had been used in an old [[Easter table]] because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who [[Diocletianic Persecution|persecuted Christians]].{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=767}} The last year of the old table, Diocletian [[Era of the Martyrs|Anno Martyrium]] 247, was immediately followed by the first year of his table, Anno Domini 532. When he devised his table, [[Julian calendar]] years were identified by naming the consuls who held office that year\u2014he himself stated that the \"present year\" was \"the consulship of [[Flavius Anicius Probus Iunior|Probus Junior]]\", which was 525 years \"since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20161226031734/http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm Nineteen year cycle of Dionysius] Introduction and First Argumentum.</ref> Thus Dionysius implied that [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Jesus' incarnation]] occurred 525 years earlier, without stating the specific year during which his birth or conception occurred. \"However, nowhere in his exposition of his table does Dionysius relate his epoch to any other dating system, whether consulate, [[Olympiad]], [[Anno Mundi|year of the world]], or [[regnal year]] of Augustus; much less does he explain or justify the underlying date.\"{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=778}}\n\n[[Bonnie J. Blackburn]] and [[Leofranc Holford-Strevens]] briefly present arguments for 2 BC, 1 BC, or AD 1 as the year Dionysius intended for the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] or [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]]. Among the sources of confusion are:{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|pp=778\u20139}}\n* In modern times, [[incarnation]] is synonymous with the conception, but some ancient writers, such as [[Bede]], considered incarnation to be synonymous with the Nativity.\n* The civil or consular year began on 1 January but the Diocletian year began on 29 August (30 August in the year before a Julian leap year).\n* There were inaccuracies in the lists of consuls.\n* There were confused summations of emperors' regnal years.\n\nIt is not known how Dionysius established the year of Jesus's birth. Two major theories are that Dionysius based his calculation on the Gospel of Luke, which states that Jesus was \"about thirty years old\" shortly after \"the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar\", and hence subtracted thirty years from that date, or that Dionysius counted back 532 years from the first year of his new table.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Teres|first=Gustav|date=October 1984|title=Time computations and Dionysius Exiguus|journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy|volume=15|issue=3|pages=177\u2013188|bibcode=1984JHA....15..177T|doi=10.1177/002182868401500302}}</ref><ref>T\u00f8ndering, Claus, ''[http://www.tondering.dk/claus/cal/years.php The Calendar FAQ: Counting years]''</ref><ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0umDqPOf2L8C&pg=PA347 |last=Mosshammer|first=Alden A|title=The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era|location=Oxford|year=2009|pages=345\u2013347|isbn=9780191562365}}</ref>\nIt has also been speculated by Georges Declercq<ref>Declercq, Georges, \"Anno Domini. The Origins of the Christian Era\" Turnhout, Belgium, 2000</ref> that Dionysius' desire to replace Diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was intended to prevent people from believing the imminent [[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]]. At the time, it was believed by some that the [[resurrection of the dead]] and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus. The old ''[[Anno Mundi]]'' calendar theoretically commenced with the [[Dating creation|creation of the world]] based on information in the [[Old Testament]]. It was believed that, based on the ''Anno Mundi'' calendar, Jesus was born in the year 5500 (5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the ''Anno Mundi'' calendar marking the end of the world.<ref>Wallraff, Martin: Julius Africanus und die Christliche Weltchronik.

The Origins of the Christian Era. Turnhout Belgium. 2000</ref> but this date had already passed in the time of Dionysius.\n\n=== Popularization ===\nThe [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] historian [[Venerable Bede|Saint (Venerable) Bede]], who was familiar with the work of [[Dionysius Exiguus]], used ''Anno Domini'' dating in his ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', which he completed in AD 731. In the ''History'' he also used the [[Latin]] phrase ''ante [...] incarnationis dominicae tempus anno sexagesimo'' (\"in the sixtieth year before the time of the Lord's incarnation\"), which is equivalent to the English \"before Christ\", to identify years before the first year of this era.<ref>Bede 731, Book 1, Chapter 2, first sentence.</ref> Both Dionysius and Bede regarded ''Anno Domini'' as beginning at the incarnation of [[Jesus Christ]], but \"the distinction between Incarnation and Nativity was not drawn until the late 9th century, when in some places the Incarnation epoch was identified with Christ's conception, i. e., the Annunciation on March 25\" (\"Annunciation style\" dating).{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=881}}\n\n[[File:Charlemagne Agostino Cornacchini Vatican 2.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Charlemagne]] by [[Agostino Cornacchini]] (1725), at [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Vatican City. Charlemagne promoted the usage of the ''Anno Domini'' epoch throughout the [[Carolingian Empire]].]]\nOn the continent of Europe, ''Anno Domini'' was introduced as the era of choice of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] by the English cleric and scholar [[Alcuin]] in the late eighth century. Its endorsement by Emperor [[Charlemagne]] and [[List of Frankish Kings#Carolingian dynasty|his successors]] popularizing the use of the epoch and spreading it throughout the [[Carolingian Empire]] ultimately lies at the core of the system's prevalence. According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], popes continued to date documents according to [[regnal years]] for some time, but usage of AD gradually became more common in Catholic countries from the 11th to the 14th centuries.<ref name=CathEncy>Patrick, 1908</ref> In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last Western European country to [[Spanish era|switch to]] the system begun by Dionysius.<ref name=\"CathEncy-Chron\">\n{{cite book\n|chapter-url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03738a.htm\n|chapter=General Chronology\n|title=New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia\n|year=1908\n|volume=Vol III\n|publisher=[[Robert Appleton Company]] |location=New York\n|access-date=25 October 2011 }}\n</ref> [[Eastern Orthodox]] countries only began to adopt AD instead of the [[Byzantine calendar]] in 1700 when Russia did so, with others adopting it in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nAlthough ''Anno Domini'' was in widespread use by the 9th century, the term \"Before Christ\" (or its equivalent) did not become common until much later. Bede used the expression ''\"anno [...] ante incarnationem Dominicam\"'' (in the year before the incarnation of the Lord) twice. ''\"Anno ante Christi nativitatem\"'' (in the year before the birth of Christ) is found in 1474 in a work by a German monk.{{NoteTag|[[Werner Rolevinck]] in ''Fasciculus temporum'' (1474) used ''Anno ante xpi nativitatem'' (in the year before the birth of Christ) for all years between [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] and Jesus. \"xpi\" comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03c7\u03c1 (''chr'') in visually Latin letters, together with the Latin ending -i, thus abbreviating ''Christi'' (\"of Christ\"). This phrase appears upside down in the centre of [[recto]] folios (right hand pages). From Jesus to [[Pope Sixtus IV]] he usually used ''Anno Christi'' or its abbreviated form ''Anno xpi'' (on [[verso]] folios\u2014left hand pages). He used ''Anno mundi'' alongside all of these terms for all years.}} In 1627, the French [[Jesuit]] theologian [[Denis P\u00e9tau]] (Dionysius Petavius in Latin), with his work ''De doctrina temporum'', popularized the usage ''ante Christum'' (Latin for \"Before Christ\") to mark years prior to AD.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|url = https://books.google.com/?id=fsni_qV-FJoC&pg=PA111#v=onepage&q=1627\n|title=Marking time: the epic quest to invent the perfect calendar\n|first=Duncan |last=Steel |author-link=Duncan Steel\n|page=114\n|accessdate=1 June 2010\n|isbn=978-0-471-29827-4\n|year=2000\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n|url = https://books.google.com/?id=A6nrL1XxpGYC&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33&dq=petau+%22ante+Christum%22&q=petau%20%22ante%20Christum%22\n|title=Measuring time, making history\n|first=Lynn Avery |last=Hunt\n|year=2008\n|page=33\n|accessdate=1 June 2010\n|isbn=978-963-9776-14-2\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n|url = https://books.google.com/?id=RRv0_NEpl-oC&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=petau+%22ante+Christum%22&q=ante%20Christum\n|title=search for \"ante Christum\" in a 1748 reprint of a 1633 abridgement entitled ''Rationarium temporum'' by Denis Petau\n|access-date=1 June 2010\n|last=Petau |first = Denis\n|year=1758\n}}</ref>\n\n===New year===\n{{See|New Year}}\n\nWhen the reckoning from Jesus' incarnation began replacing the previous dating systems in western Europe, various people chose different Christian feast days to begin the year: Christmas, [[Annunciation]], or Easter. Thus, depending on the time and place, the year number changed on different days in the year, which created slightly different styles in chronology:<ref>[[C. R. Cheney]], [http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/99027383.pdf ''A Handbook of Dates, for students of British history''], Cambridge University Press, 1945\u20132000, pp. 8\u201314.</ref>\n* From 25 March 753 [[Ab urbe condita|AUC]] (today in 1 BC), i.e., notionally from the incarnation of Jesus. That first \"Annunciation style\" appeared in [[Arles]] at the end of the 9th century, then spread to Burgundy and northern Italy. It was not commonly used and was called ''calculus pisanus'' since it was adopted in [[Pisa]] and survived there till 1750.\n* From 25 December 753 AUC (today in 1 BC), i.e., notionally from the birth of Jesus. It was called \"Nativity style\" and had been spread by Bede together with the ''Anno Domini'' in the early Middle Ages. That reckoning of the Year of Grace from Christmas was used in France, England and most of western Europe (except Spain) until the 12th century (when it was replaced by Annunciation style), and in Germany until the second quarter of the 13th century.\n* From 25 March 754 AUC (today in AD 1). That second \"Annunciation style\" may have originated in [[Fleury Abbey]] in the early 11th century, but it was spread by the Cistercians. [[Florence]] adopted that style in opposition to that of Pisa, so it got the name of ''calculus florentinus''. It soon spread in France and also in England where it became common in the late 12th century and lasted until 1752.\n* From Easter, starting in 754 AUC (AD 1). That ''mos gallicanus'' (French custom) bound to a [[moveable feast]] was introduced in France by king [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] (r. 1180\u20131223), maybe to establish a new style in the provinces reconquered from England. However, it never spread beyond the ruling \u00e9lite.\nWith these various styles, the same day could, in some cases, be dated in 1099, 1100 or 1101.\n\n== Birth date of Jesus ==\n{{see also|Date of birth of Jesus|Nativity of Jesus#Date of birth|Chronology of Jesus#Year of Jesus' birth}}\nThe date of birth of Jesus of Nazareth is not stated in the gospels or in any secular text, but most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 BC and 4 BC.<ref name=JDG324 >{{Cite journal | first = James DG | last = Dunn | title = Jesus Remembered | publisher = Eerdmans Publishing | year = 2003 | page = 324}}</ref> The historical evidence is too fragmentary to allow a definitive dating,<ref>Doggett 1992, p579: \"Although scholars generally believe that Christ was born some years before AD 1, the historical evidence is too sketchy to allow a definitive dating\".</ref> but the date is estimated through two different approaches \u2013 one by analyzing references to known historical events mentioned in the Nativity accounts in the Gospels of Luke and Matthew, and the second by working backwards from the estimation of the start of the [[ministry of Jesus]].<ref name=ChronosPaul >[[Paul L.

Systems in use included [[List of Roman consuls|consular dating]], imperial [[regnal year]] dating, and [[Anno Mundi|Creation dating]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}\n\nAlthough the last non-imperial consul, [[Anicius Faustus Albinus Basilius|Basilius]], was appointed in 541 by Emperor [[Justinian I]], later emperors through [[Constans II]] (641\u2013668) were appointed consuls on the first of January after their accession. All of these emperors, except Justinian, used imperial post-consular years for the years of their reign, along with their regnal years.<ref>Roger S. Bagnall and Klaas A. Worp, ''[https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/11125 Chronological Systems of Byzantine Egypt]'', Leiden, Brill, 2004.</ref> Long unused, this practice was not formally abolished until Novell XCIV of the law code of [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] did so in 888.\n\nAnother calculation had been developed by the [[Alexandria]]n monk [[Annianus of Alexandria|Annianus]] around the year AD 400, placing the Annunciation on 25 March AD 9 (Julian)\u2014eight to ten years after the date that Dionysius was to imply. Although this incarnation was popular during the early centuries of the [[Byzantine Empire]], years numbered from it, an ''Era of Incarnation'', were exclusively used and are still used in [[Ethiopia]]. This accounts for the seven- or eight-year discrepancy between the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] and [[Ethiopian calendar]]s. Byzantine chroniclers like [[Maximus the Confessor]], [[George Syncellus]], and [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] dated their years from Annianus' [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] of the world. This era, called ''[[Anno Mundi]]'', \"year of the world\" (abbreviated AM), by modern scholars, began its first year on 25 March 5492 BC. Later Byzantine chroniclers used ''Anno Mundi'' years from 1 September 5509 BC, the [[Byzantine calendar|Byzantine Era]]. No single ''Anno Mundi'' epoch was dominant throughout the [[Christian world]]. [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in his ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle]]'' used an era beginning with the birth of [[Abraham]], dated in 2016 BC (AD 1 = 2017 Anno Abrahami).<ref>Alfred von Gutschmid, ''Kleine Schriften'', F. Ruehl, Leipzig, 1889, p.&nbsp;433.</ref>\n\nSpain and Portugal continued to date by the [[Spanish Era]] (also called [[Era of the Caesars]]), which began counting from 38 BC, well into the Middle Ages. In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last Catholic country to adopt the ''Anno Domini'' system.<ref name=CathEncy/>\n\nThe [[Era of Martyrs]], which numbered years from the accession of [[Diocletian]] in 284, who launched the most severe [[persecution of Christians]], was used by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Church of Alexandria]] and is still used, officially, by the Coptic Orthodox and [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic Catholic]] churches. It was also used by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian]] church. Another system was to date from the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], which as early as [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]] and [[Tertullian]] was believed to have occurred in the consulate of the Gemini (AD 29), which appears in some [[Middle Ages|medieval]] manuscripts.\n\n== CE and BCE ==\n{{Main|Common Era}}\n\nAlternative names for the ''Anno Domini'' era include ''vulgaris aerae'' (found 1615 in Latin),<ref name=\"VulgarisAerae1\">\n{{cite book\n|quote=anno aerae nostrae vulgaris\n|author=Johannes Kepler\n|title=Joannis Keppleri Eclogae chronicae: ex epistolis doctissimorum aliquot virorum & suis mutuis, quibus examinantur tempora nobilissima: 1.

The translated term was \u897f\u5143 (\"x\u012b yu\u00e1n\", \"Western Era\").

There are debates as to whether a new decade, century, or millennium begin on a year ending in zero or one.<ref name=\"Teresi1997\" />\n\nFor computational reasons, [[astronomical year numbering]] and the [[ISO 8601]] standard designate years so that AD 1 = year 1, 1 BC = year 0, 2 BC = year \u22121, etc.{{NoteTag|To convert from a year BC to [[astronomical year numbering]], reduce the absolute value of the year by 1, and prefix it with a negative sign (unless the result is zero). For years AD, omit the AD and prefix the number with a plus sign (plus sign is optional if it is clear from the context that the year is after the year 0).<ref>Doggett, 1992, p. 579</ref>}} In common usage, ancient dates are expressed in the Julian calendar, but ISO 8601 uses the Gregorian calendar and astronomers may use a variety of time scales depending on the application. Thus dates using the year 0 or negative years may require further investigation before being converted to BC or AD.\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Ante Christum natum]]''\n* [[Before Present]]\n* [[Holocene calendar]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book\n | title = Oxford Pocket Dictionary and Thesaurus\n | editor-last = Abate\n | editor-first = Frank R.\n | version = American\n | location = New York\n | publisher = Oxford University Press\n | year = 1997\n | isbn = 0-19-513097-9\n }}\n* {{cite book\n |title = Associated Press Style Book\n |publisher = Basic Books\n |location = New York\n |editor1-first = Norm\n |editor1-last = Goldstein\n |year = 2007\n |isbn = 978-0-465-00489-8\n }}\n* Bede.
