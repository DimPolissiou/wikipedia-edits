In the early 16th century abuses (such as selling [[indulgence]]s in the Catholic Church) occasioned much discontent, and a general desire for reform emerged.  In 1517 the Reformation began with the publication of [[Martin Luther]]'s [[95 Theses]] detailing 95 assertions which Luther believed showed corruption and misguidance within the Catholic Church.  The Reformation demonstrated Luther's disagreement both with the way in which the higher clergy used and abused power, and with the very idea of a papacy. In 1521 the [[Diet of Worms]] outlawed Luther, but the Reformation spread rapidly.<ref>John Lotherington, ''The German Reformation'' (2014)</ref>  Luther translated the Bible from Latin to German, establishing the basis of the modern German language. A curious fact is that Luther spoke a dialect which had minor importance in the German language of that time. After the publication of his Bible translation, his dialect evolved into what is now standard modern German.\n\nWith the [[Protestation at Speyer|protestation]] of the Lutheran princes at the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] of [[Second Diet of Speyer|Speyer]] (1529) and rejection of the Lutheran \"Augsburg Confession\" at the [[Diet of Augsburg]] (1530), a separate Lutheran church emerged.<ref name=\":2\">Robert Kolb, ''Confessing the faith: reformers define the Church, 1530\u20131580'' (Concordia Publishing House, 1991)</ref>\n\nFrom 1545 the [[Catholic Reformation|Counter-Reformation]] began in Germany.

O'Connell, ''Counter-reformation, 1559\u20131610'' (1974)</ref> The Holy Roman Empire became religiously diverse; for the most part, the states of northern and central Germany became Protestant (chiefly Lutheran, but also Calvinist/Reformed) while the states of southern Germany and the [[Rhineland]] largely remained Catholic. In 1547 the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] defeated the [[Schmalkaldic League]], an alliance of Protestant rulers.  The [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555 brought recognition of the Lutheran faith. But the treaty also stipulated that the religion of a state was to be that of its ruler (''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'').<ref>Lewis W.

There was a movement to unite the larger Lutheran and the smaller Reformed Protestant churches. The churches themselves brought this about in Baden, Nassau, and Bavaria. However, in Prussia King [[Frederick William III]] was determined to handle unification entirely on his own terms, without consultation. His goal was to [[Lutheranism#Church fellowship|unify]] the Protestant churches, and to impose a single standardised liturgy, organisation, and even architecture. The long-term goal was to have fully centralised royal control of all the Protestant churches. In a series of proclamations over several decades the [[Prussian Union of churches|Evangelical Church of the Prussian Union]] was formed, bringing together the more numerous Lutherans and the less numerous Reformed Protestants. The government of Prussia now had full control over church affairs, with the king himself recognised as the leading bishop. Opposition to unification came from the \"[[Old Lutherans]]\" in Prussia and Silesia who followed the theological and liturgical forms they had followed since the days of Luther. The government attempted to crack down on them, so they went underground.  Tens of thousands migrated [[German Australian|to South Australia]] and the United States, where they formed the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod|Missouri Synod]]. Finally, in 1845 the new king, [[Frederick William IV]], offered a general amnesty and allowed the Old Lutherans to form separate [[Free church#Germany|free church]] associations with only nominal government control.<ref>Christopher Clark,  ''Iron Kingdom '' (2006) pp 412\u201319</ref><ref>Christopher Clark, \"Confessional policy and the limits of state action: Frederick William III and the Prussian Church Union 1817\u201340.\" ''Historical Journal'' 39.04 (1996) pp: 985\u20131004.

Opposing the rationalism of the late 18th century, there was a new emphasis on the psychology and feeling of the individual, especially in terms of contemplating sinfulness, redemption, and the mysteries and the revelations of Christianity. [[Pietism|Pietistic revivals]] were common among Protestants. Among Catholics there was a sharp increase in popular pilgrimages. In 1844 alone, half a million pilgrims made a pilgrimage to the city of Trier in the Rhineland to view the [[Seamless robe of Jesus]], said to be the robe that Jesus wore on the way to his crucifixion.  Catholic bishops in Germany had historically been largely independent of Rome, but now the Vatican exerted increasing control, a new \"[[ultramontanism]]\" of Catholics highly loyal to Rome.<ref>Christopher Clark, ''Iron Kingdom '' (2006) pp 419\u201321</ref> A sharp controversy broke out in 1837\u201338 in the largely Catholic Rhineland over the religious education of children of mixed marriages, where the mother was Catholic and the father Protestant. The government passed laws to require that these children always be raised as Protestants, contrary to Napoleonic law that had previously prevailed and allowed the parents to make the decision. It put the Catholic Archbishop under house arrest. In 1840, the new King Frederick William IV sought reconciliation and ended the controversy by agreeing to most of the Catholic demands.  However Catholic memories remained deep and led to a sense that Catholics always needed to stick together in the face of an untrustworthy government.<ref>Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany 1648\u20131840'' (1964) pp 498\u2013509</ref>\n\n=== Kulturkampf and the German Empire (1871\u20131918) ===\n{{main|Kulturkampf}}\n[[File:Kladderadatsch 1875 - Zwischen Berlin und Rom.png|thumb|275px|''Between Berlin and Rome'', Bismarck (left) confronts Pope Pius IX, 1875]]\n[[File:Verbreitung der Konfessionen im deutschen Reich.jpg|thumb|275px|The religious situation in the German Empire about 1895.

He launched a [[Kulturkampf]] (\"culture war\") against the power of the pope and the Catholic Church in 1873, but only in Prussia. This gained strong support from German liberals, who saw the Catholic Church as the bastion of reaction and their greatest enemy.

Nearly all Catholic bishops, clergy, and laymen rejected the legality of the new laws, and were defiant facing the increasingly heavy penalties and imprisonments imposed by Bismarck's government.  Historian Anthony Steinhoff reports the casualty totals:\n\n<blockquote>As of 1878, only three of eight Prussian dioceses still had bishops, some 1,125 of 4,600 parishes were vacant, and nearly 1,800 priests ended up in jail or in exile. ...Finally, between 1872 and 1878, numerous Catholic newspapers were confiscated, Catholic associations and assemblies were dissolved, and Catholic civil servants were dismissed merely on the pretence of having Ultramontane sympathies.<ref>Anthony J.

In the early 16th century abuses (such as selling [[indulgence]]s in the Catholic Church) occasioned much discontent, and a general desire for reform emerged.  In 1517 the Reformation began with the publication of [[Martin Luther]]'s [[95 Theses]] detailing 95 assertions which Luther believed showed corruption and misguidance within the Catholic Church.  The Reformation demonstrated Luther's disagreement both with the way in which the higher clergy used and abused power, and with the very idea of a papacy. In 1521 the [[Diet of Worms]] outlawed Luther, but the Reformation spread rapidly.<ref>John Lotherington, ''The German Reformation'' (2014)</ref>  Luther translated the Bible from Latin to German, establishing the basis of the modern German language.

There was a movement to unite the larger Lutheran and the smaller Reformed Protestant churches. The churches themselves brought this about in Baden, Nassau, and Bavaria. However, in Prussia King [[Frederick William III]] was determined to handle unification entirely on his own terms, without consultation. His goal was to [[Lutheranism#Church fellowship|unify]] the Protestant churches, and to impose a single standardised liturgy, organisation, and even architecture. The long-term goal was to have fully centralised royal control of all the Protestant churches. In a series of proclamations over several decades the [[Prussian Union of churches|Evangelical Church of the Prussian Union]] was formed, bringing together the more numerous Lutherans and the less numerous Reformed Protestants. The government of Prussia now had full control over church affairs, with the king himself recognised as the leading bishop. Opposition to unification came from the \"[[Old Lutherans]]\" in Prussia and Silesia who followed the theological and liturgical forms they had followed since the days of Luther. The government attempted to crack down on them, so they went underground.  Tens of thousands migrated [[German Australian|to South Australia]] and the United States, where they formed the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod|Missouri Synod]]. Finally, in 1845 the new king, [[Frederick William IV]], offered a general amnesty and allowed the Old Lutherans to form separate [[Free church#Germany|free church]] associations with only nominal government control.<ref>Christopher Clark,  ''Iron Kingdom '' (2006) pp 412\u201319</ref><ref>Christopher Clark, \"Confessional policy and the limits of state action: Frederick William III and the Prussian Church Union 1817\u201340.\" ''Historical Journal'' 39.04 (1996) pp: 985\u20131004.

Opposing the rationalism of the late 18th century, there was a new emphasis on the psychology and feeling of the individual, especially in terms of contemplating sinfulness, redemption, and the mysteries and the revelations of Christianity. [[Pietism|Pietistic revivals]] were common among Protestants. Among Catholics there was a sharp increase in popular pilgrimages. In 1844 alone, half a million pilgrims made a pilgrimage to the city of Trier in the Rhineland to view the [[Seamless robe of Jesus]], said to be the robe that Jesus wore on the way to his crucifixion.  Catholic bishops in Germany had historically been largely independent of Rome, but now the Vatican exerted increasing control, a new \"[[ultramontanism]]\" of Catholics highly loyal to Rome.<ref>Christopher Clark, ''Iron Kingdom '' (2006) pp 419\u201321</ref> A sharp controversy broke out in 1837\u201338 in the largely Catholic Rhineland over the religious education of children of mixed marriages, where the mother was Catholic and the father Protestant. The government passed laws to require that these children always be raised as Protestants, contrary to Napoleonic law that had previously prevailed and allowed the parents to make the decision. It put the Catholic Archbishop under house arrest. In 1840, the new King Frederick William IV sought reconciliation and ended the controversy by agreeing to most of the Catholic demands.  However Catholic memories remained deep and led to a sense that Catholics always needed to stick together in the face of an untrustworthy government.<ref>Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany 1648\u20131840'' (1964) pp 498\u2013509</ref>\n\n=== Kulturkampf and the German Empire (1871\u20131918) ===\n{{main|Kulturkampf}}\n[[File:Kladderadatsch 1875 - Zwischen Berlin und Rom.png|thumb|275px|''Between Berlin and Rome'', Bismarck (left) confronts Pope Pius IX, 1875]]\n[[File:Verbreitung der Konfessionen im deutschen Reich.jpg|thumb|275px|The religious situation in the German Empire about 1895.

It was first released in China by Perfect World in December 2016, with releases in other languages including English over the following two years from other publishers; its English release was the first ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' title to be licensed by Square Enix to another company. The English version closed in 2019 due to service changes, and all other versions will shut down in May 2020 with the end of the licencing deal.\n\n''Awakening'' is set in the universe of ''[[Final Fantasy Type-0]]'', a spin-off title within the ''[[Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy|Fabula Nova Crystallis]]'' subseries. Players take on the role of a solder of the Dominion of Rubrum as the four nations of Orience are plunged into war. The player engages in missions, fighting foes using hack and slash-style gameplay using parties of five characters. All gameplay is [[multiplayer]]-exclusive, featuring both cooperative and player-versus-player modes.\n\nPlanning began in 2014 after the online elements of ''[[Final Fantasy Agito]]'' stalled due to technical difficulties. According to original director [[Hajime Tabata]], ''Awakening'' was the true realisation of his earliest plans for ''Type-0''. The game was overseen by staff from Square Enix, while the main development was handled by Perfect World, who were chosen due to their good track record for domestic and international online games. First announced at the 2015 [[Tokyo Game Show]], its first beta test opened in mainland China in April 2016. It met with commercial success, achieving two million downloads within its month of Chinese release. It also saw strong popular appeal and positive reviews from game journalists.\n\n==Story and gameplay==\n[[File:FF Awakening gameplay.jpg|left|thumb|Screenshot of combat in ''Final Fantasy Awakening'', showing some of the potential characters in battle with some common enemies.]]\n''Final Fantasy Awakening'' is an [[action role-playing game]] where players take on the role of a cadet in the Dominion of Rubrum's magical academy.<ref name=\"Pocket\"/> ''Awakening'' takes place in Orience, a world divided between four warring nations. It is referred to as a \"parallel world\" to that of the original ''Type-0''.<ref name= \"IGNonline\"/> Similar to ''[[Final Fantasy Type-0]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy Agito]]'', the world is locked in a repeating spiral of history, with ''Awakening'' being an iteration of that history.<ref name= \"TabataOnlineInterview\"/> The player character takes part in the war between Orience's nations, eventually aiding Rubrum's victory over the other nations; this triggers an apocalyptic event called Tempus Finis. While the player defeats the Rursan Judge overseeing Tempus Finis, the cycle of history is reset, though the player is allowed to remember their deeds and relives the cycle as different alliances of nations play out.<ref name=\"Awakening\"/>\n\n''Awakening'' is focused around multiplayer gameplay similar to the multiplayer functions of the original ''Type-0'', but with a more evolved system and hack-and-slash style gameplay.<ref name= \"SilOnline\"/> The player cadet is customisable, with gender, general appearance and abilities chosen by the player at the beginning of the game.<ref name=\"BravesReview\"/> Between the game's missions, represented as nodes on a map of Orience, the player explores the hub area of Rubrum's Akademia, talking to characters and accepting [[Quest (gaming)|quests]].<ref name=\"AxisReview\"/> Players have a manual control option and an \"auto\" mode where battles are played out using the game's [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] (AI).<ref name=\"GeekReview\"/> In addition to story-based missions, there are arenas where teams of players can face off against each other.<ref name=\"AxisReview\"/>\n\nMissions use five-person teams; the cadet, two other player with selected characters, and two AI-controlled party members; the AI partners and players are switched round periodically to alter the flow of gameplay.<ref name=\"AwakeningInterview\"/> This ties into a move called the Triad Manouver, where three characters combine abilities for high damage.<ref name=\"Pocket\"/> If the player's \"rage\" is high enough, they can also call a [[Recurring elements in the Final Fantasy series#Summoning|summoned monster]] known as an Eidolon, which can deliver high damage to enemies.<ref name=\"AwakeningInterview\"/><ref name=\"AwakeningUpdate\"/> Each character, including the original fourteen-person cast of ''Type-0'', has specific skills and unique moves. Additional battle effects are unlocked by including characters in the party with close relations or similar skills.<ref name=\"AwakeningInterview\"/> Characters earn [[experience point]]s in battle, which both raises their level and earns in-game currency which can be used to purchase new weapons and items.<ref name=\"Pocket\"/> The game uses a free-to-play purchase model: while the base game is free, optional items can be purchased by the player for cash.<ref name= \"OnlineFamitsu\"/> Later updates included new battle areas, cross-server multiplayer battles between teams, and a \"Vow\" system where players could form marriages in-game.<ref name=\"AwakeningUpdate\"/>\n\n==Development==\nPlanning for ''Awakening'' began in November 2014, with full development starting at the beginning of 2015. The game was designed as a successor to ''Final Fantasy Agito'', which had hit insurmountable technical barriers which stopped further development of its online functions.<ref name= \"TabataOnlineInterview\"/> ''Type-0 Online'', as it was called, was co-developed by [[Square Enix]] and Chinese online game developer [[Perfect World Games]].<ref name= \"SilOnline\"/><ref name= \"OnlineFamitsu\"/> While Perfect World handled primary development, the original staff of ''Agito'' supervised the project.

Development went on for longer than anticipated, although it progressed smoothly when it neared its first open beta.<ref name=\"T0Onlinedemo\"/> ''Awakening'' was said to be the first ''Final Fantasy'' title to be licenced by Square Enix to another company for both production and publishing.<ref name=\"AwakeningOasis\"/><ref name=\"4GchinaDevs\"/>\n\n[[Hajime Tabata]], who led production on both ''Type-0'' and ''Agito'', acted as the game's director.<ref name= \"TabataOnlineInterview\"/><ref name=\"AwakeningInterview\"/> Following Tabata's departure from Square Enix in 2018,<ref name=\"SilTabataDeparture\"/> series veteran [[Yoshinori Kitase]] took over the position of director.<ref name=\"AwakeningKitase\"/> The producer was Daihashi Motohashi.<ref name=\"AwakeningInterview\"/> The game's title \"''Awakening''\" was chosen as Tabata consider the game an \"awakening\" of his early concept for ''Final Fantasy Type-0'', which was planned as a mobile title before releasing on [[PlayStation Portable]]. He considered ''Awakening'' the closest realisation to his original plans.<ref name=\"4GchinaDevs\"/> In an interview, Motohashi said that they faced multiple challenges during development, mainly how to bring the original game's features over into a mobile experience. They also wanted to make use of the original game's extensive cast, giving them a larger role in gameplay.<ref name=\"AwakeningInterview\"/> The brand was already well known worldwide, so the gameplay was chosen as something acceptable to the largest number of people.<ref name=\"4Gjoy\"/> It was built upon the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] game engine.<ref name=\"T0OnlineUnity\"/>\n\n==Release==\nIt was first hinted with the announcement that ''Agito'' was shutting down in November 2015.

name=\"AwakeningOasis\"/>\n\nWebsite ''GamerBraves'' praised the game for its nostalgic return to the world of ''Type-0'' and engaging gameplay style, but faulted its cluttered interface and lack of some player-versus-player battle arena types.<ref name=\"BravesReview\"/> ''GameAxis'' called it \"a worthwhile entry for players hungry for ''Type-0'' content\", praising its gameplay but faulting its inclusion of microtransactions.<ref name=\"AxisReview\"/> ''Geek Culture'' again praised the gameplay and positively compared its cinematic presentation to home console games, but again negatively noted the presence of microtransactions despite the reviewer not feeling pressured into using them.<ref name=\"GeekReview\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|40em|refs=\n\n<ref

It was first released in China by Perfect World in December 2016, with releases in other languages including English over the following two years from other publishers; its English release was the first ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' title to be licensed by Square Enix to another company. The English version closed in 2019 due to service changes, and all other versions will shut down in May 2020 with the end of the licencing deal.\n\n''Awakening'' is set in the universe of ''[[Final Fantasy Type-0]]'', a spin-off title within the ''[[Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy|Fabula Nova Crystallis]]'' subseries. Players take on the role of a solder of the Dominion of Rubrum as the world of Orience is plunged into war by the actions of the Milites Empire. The player engages in missions, fighting foes using hack and slash-style gameplay using parties of four characters. There is a focus on social elements and multiplayer, with both cooperative and player-versus-player combat available.\n\nPlanning for the title began in 2014 after it became clear that the online elements of ''[[Final Fantasy Agito]]'' could not be developed further due to technical difficulties. According to original director [[Hajime Tabata]], ''Awakening'' was the true realisation of his earliest plans for ''Type-0''. The game was overseen by staff from Square Enix, while the main development was handled by Perfect World, who were chosen due to their good track record for domestic and international online games. First announced at the 2015 [[Tokyo Game Show]], its first beta test opened in mainland China in April 2016. It met with commercial success, achieving two million downloads within its month of Chinese release. It also saw strong popular appeal and positive reviews from game journalists.\n\n==Story and gameplay==\n[[File:FF Awakening gameplay.jpg|left|thumb|Screenshot of combat in ''Final Fantasy Awakening'', showing some of the potential characters in battle with some common enemies.]]\n''Final Fantasy Awakening'' is an [[action role-playing game]] where players take on the role of a cadet in the Dominion of Rubrum's magical academy.<ref name=\"Pocket\"/> ''Awakening'' takes place in Orience, a world divided between four warring nations. It is referred to as a \"parallel world\" to that of the original ''Type-0''.<ref name= \"IGNonline\"/> Similar to ''[[Final Fantasy Type-0]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy Agito]]'', the world is locked in a repeating spiral of history, with ''Awakening'' being an iteration of that history.<ref name= \"TabataOnlineInterview\"/> The player character takes part in the war between Orience's nations, eventually aiding Rubrum's victory over the other nations; this triggers an apocalyptic event called Tempus Finis. While the player defeats the Rursan Judge overseeing Tempus Finis, the cycle of history is reset, though the player is allowed to remember their deeds and relives the cycle as different alliances of nations play out.<ref name=\"Awakening\"/>\n\n''Awakening'' is focused around multiplayer gameplay similar to the multiplayer functions of the original ''Type-0'', but with a more evolved system and hack-and-slash style gameplay.<ref name= \"SilOnline\"/> The player cadet is customisable, with gender, general appearance and abilities chosen by the player at the beginning of the game.<ref name=\"BravesReview\"/> Between the game's missions, represented as nodes on a map of Orience, the player explores the hub area of Rubrum's Akademia, talking to characters and accepting [[Quest (gaming)|quests]].<ref name=\"AxisReview\"/> Players have a manual control option and an \"auto\" mode where battles are played out using the game's [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] (AI).<ref name=\"GeekReview\"/> In addition to story-based missions, there are arenas where teams of players can face off against each other.<ref name=\"AxisReview\"/>\n\nMissions use five-person teams; the cadet, two other player with selected characters, and two AI-controlled party members; the AI partners and players are switched round periodically to alter the flow of gameplay.<ref name=\"AwakeningInterview\"/> This ties into a move called the Triad Manouver, where three characters combine abilities for high damage.<ref name=\"Pocket\"/> If the player's \"rage\" is high enough, they can also call a [[Recurring elements in the Final Fantasy series#Summoning|summoned monster]] known as an Eidolon, which can deliver high damage to enemies.<ref name=\"AwakeningInterview\"/><ref name=\"AwakeningUpdate\"/> Each character, including the original fourteen-person cast of ''Type-0'', has specific skills and unique moves. Additional battle effects are unlocked by including characters in the party with close relations or similar skills.<ref name=\"AwakeningInterview\"/> Characters earn [[experience point]]s in battle, which both raises their level and earns in-game currency which can be used to purchase new weapons and items.<ref name=\"Pocket\"/> The game uses a free-to-play purchase model: while the base game is free, optional items can be purchased by the player for cash.<ref name= \"OnlineFamitsu\"/> Later updates included new battle areas, cross-server multiplayer battles between teams, and a \"Vow\" system where players could form marriages in-game.<ref name=\"AwakeningUpdate\"/>\n\n==Development==\nPlanning for ''Awakening'' began in November 2014, with full development starting at the beginning of 2015. The game was designed as a successor to ''Final Fantasy Agito'', which had hit insurmountable technical barriers which stopped further development of its online functions.<ref name= \"TabataOnlineInterview\"/> ''Type-0 Online'', as it was called, was co-developed by [[Square Enix]] and Chinese online game developer [[Perfect World Games]].<ref name= \"SilOnline\"/><ref name= \"OnlineFamitsu\"/> While Perfect World handled primary development, the original staff of ''Agito'' supervised the project. Perfect World was chosen as they had extensive experience with domestic and international online games.<ref name= \"TabataOnlineInterview\"/> After ''Agito'' shut down, the development team transferred over to work on ''Awakening''.<ref name= \"AgitoEnd1\"/><ref name= \"AgitoEnd2\"/> Over 100 staff at Perfect World were attached to the game's development for more than a year. Development went on for longer than anticipated, although it progressed smoothly when it neared its first open beta.<ref name=\"T0Onlinedemo\"/> ''Awakening'' was said to be the first ''Final Fantasy'' title to be licenced by Square Enix to another company for both production and publishing.<ref name=\"AwakeningOasis\"/><ref name=\"4GchinaDevs\"/>\n\n[[Hajime Tabata]], who led production on both ''Type-0'' and ''Agito'', acted as the game's director.<ref name= \"TabataOnlineInterview\"/><ref name=\"AwakeningInterview\"/> Following Tabata's departure from Square Enix in 2018,<ref name=\"SilTabataDeparture\"/> series veteran [[Yoshinori Kitase]] took over the position of director.<ref name=\"AwakeningKitase\"/> The producer was Daihashi Motohashi.<ref name=\"AwakeningInterview\"/> The game's title \"''Awakening''\" was chosen as Tabata consider the game an \"awakening\" of his early concept for ''Final Fantasy Type-0'', which was planned as a mobile title before releasing on [[PlayStation Portable]]. He considered ''Awakening'' the closest realisation to his original plans.<ref name=\"4GchinaDevs\"/> In an interview, Motohashi said that they faced multiple challenges during development, mainly how to bring the original game's features over into a mobile experience. They also wanted to make use of the original game's extensive cast, giving them a larger role in gameplay.<ref name=\"AwakeningInterview\"/> The brand was already well known worldwide, so the gameplay was chosen as something acceptable to the largest number of people.<ref name=\"4Gjoy\"/> It was built upon the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] game engine.<ref name=\"T0OnlineUnity\"/>\n\n==Release==\nIt was first hinted with the announcement that ''Agito'' was shutting down in November 2015. The company stated that a \"reborn\" version of ''Agito'' would be shown off at that year's Tokyo Game Show.<ref name= \"AgitoVersionEnd\"/> The game was announced at the event under the provisional title ''Final Fantasy Type-0 Online'' for both mobiles and [[Microsoft Windows]], along with a planned release window of spring 2016. At this time, it was planned for ''Agito'' players to receive an unspecified \"favor\" if they chose to play ''Awakening''.<ref name= \"TypeOnline\"/> A beta test was scheduled for Chinese territories in the winter of 2015.<ref name= \"TypeOnline\"/> The first beta test ended up starting in mid-April 2016.<ref name=\"ChinaBeta\"/> When it was first announced, a localization for Europe and North America was under consideration.<ref name= \"IGNonline\"/> At the 2015 AWS Summit Tokyo, the open beta for Japan was announced for June, with releases following in Japan, North America and Europe.<ref name=\"T0Ojune\"/>\n\nIts first playable appearance was at the 2016 [[China Digital Entertainment Expo & Conference|ChinaJoy Expo]]. It was also stated at the event that Perfect World would act as the game's publishers in Asian territories outside Japan.<ref name=\"T0Onlinedemo\"/> In October 2016, it was announced that the game would be renamed ''Final Fantasy Awakening'', releasing under that name in China.<ref name=\"T0ChinNamechange\"/> The game became available for general download in China on December 14, 2016.<ref name=\"T0OnlineChinRelease\"/> It later released in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau on August 3, 2017.<ref name=\"AwakeningTaiwan\"/> In these regions, the game was given a title in traditional Chinese rather than English, with the team hoping to establish a unified brand identity for ''Final Fantasy'' in the region.<ref name=\"4GchinaDevs\"/> Any Japanese release was being delayed until the game had a stable presence in the worldwide market.<ref name=\"AwakeningInterview\"/>\n\nThe game was released in [[Indonesia]] on August 15, 2017 by Efun Company Limited.<ref name=\"AwakeningIndoA\"/><ref name=\"AwakeningIndoB\"/> Releases in Singapore and Malaysia followed in October.<ref name=\"AwakeningSingMalay\"/> A South Korean release came through [[FL Studio Mobile]] on October 17, 2017.<ref name=\"AwakeningKorea\"/> Later, [[Hong Kong]]-based company Oasis Games officially licensed the game for an English-language release in Australia, New Zealand, and other territories in 2018.<ref name=\"AwakeningOasis\"/> First releasing for Android in those regions on January 30, a release for iOS came out on February 26.<ref name=\"FFAengDate1\"/> A soft launch went live in North America on February 2, 2018 for Android and February 26 for iOS.<ref name=\"FFAengDate2\"/> On October 15, 2019, the game's English servers would be shutting down due to incompatible changes to the original service.<ref name=\"AwakeningVersionEnd\"/> In February 2020, it was announced that ''Final Fantasy Awakening'' as a whole would shut down on May 18 of that year, with gradual suspention of services between February and April.<ref name=\"AwakeningEnd1\"/> In a statement regarding the game's closure, Efun said it was due to the approaching end of the licencing agreement from Square Enix.<ref name=\"AwakeningEnd2\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nOn the day of its release in China, ''Awakening'' achieved 500,000 downloads, coming in at #5 in the best-selling mobile games in China at the time.<ref name=\"T0OnlineDL1\"/><ref name=\"T0OnlineDL2\"/> By the end of December, downloads had reached two million.<ref name=\"T0OnlineDL2\"/> Following its English release on Android, the game achieved 137,000 downloads.<ref name=\"FFAengDate1\"/> It also received positive player feedback, and was awarded Google's \"Best of 2017\" award in three territories where it had released at the time.<ref name=\"AwakeningOasis\"/>\n\nWebsite ''GamerBraves'' praised the game for its nostalgic return to the world of ''Type-0'' and engaging gameplay style, but faulted its cluttered interface and lack of some player-versus-player battle arena types.<ref name=\"BravesReview\"/> ''GameAxis'' called it \"a worthwhile entry for players hungry for ''Type-0'' content\", praising its gameplay but faulting its inclusion of microtransactions.<ref name=\"AxisReview\"/> ''Geek Culture'' again praised the gameplay and positively compared its cinematic presentation to home console games, but again negatively noted the presence of microtransactions despite the reviewer not feeling pressured into using them.<ref name=\"GeekReview\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|40em|refs=\n\n<ref

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat.

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered '''imperfect consonances''' because one can make distinctions between them.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <g b>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 3rd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d a'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 5th } } \\bar \"||\" <b g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 6th } }  \\bar \"||\"<g g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 8th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th.
