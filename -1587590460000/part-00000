A pillar of the Irish literary establishment, he helped to found the [[Abbey Theatre]], and in his later years served two terms as a [[Seanad \u00c9ireann (Irish Free State)|Senator]] of the [[Irish Free State]]. He was a driving force behind the [[Irish Literary Revival]] along with [[Augusta, Lady Gregory|Lady Gregory]], [[Edward Martyn]] and others.\n\nYeats was born in [[Sandymount]], Ireland, and educated there and in London. He spent childhood holidays in [[County Sligo]] and studied poetry from an early age, when he became fascinated by [[Irish mythology|Irish legends]] and the [[occult]]. These topics feature in the first phase of his work, which lasted roughly until the turn of the 20th century. His earliest volume of verse was published in 1889, and its slow-paced and lyrical poems display debts to [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and the poets of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]]. From 1900, his poetry grew more physical and [[Literary realism|realistic]]. He largely renounced the transcendental beliefs of his youth, though he remained preoccupied with physical and spiritual masks, as well as with cyclical theories of life.

Soon after William's birth, the family relocated to the Pollexfen home at Merville, Sligo, to stay with her extended family, and the young poet came to think of the area as his childhood and spiritual home. Its landscape became, over time, both literally and symbolically, his \"country of the heart\".{{sfn|Yeats|1994|p=vii}} So too did its location by the sea; John Yeats stated that \"by marriage with a Pollexfen, we have given a tongue to the sea cliffs\".<ref>W. B. Yeats, ''Autobiographies'' (1956), p. 12.

While his family was broadly supportive of the changes Ireland was experiencing, the nationalist revival of the late 19th century directly disadvantaged his heritage and informed his outlook for the remainder of his life. In 1997, his biographer [[R. F. Foster (historian)|R. F. Foster]] observed that Napoleon's dictum that to understand the man you have to know what was happening in the world when he was twenty \"is manifestly true of W.B.Y.\"{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=xxviii}} Yeats's childhood and young adulthood were shadowed by the power-shift away from the minority Protestant Ascendancy. The 1880s saw the rise of [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and the [[home rule]] movement; the 1890s saw the momentum of nationalism, while the Catholics became prominent around the turn of the century. These developments had a profound effect on his poetry, and his subsequent explorations of Irish identity had a significant influence on the creation of his country's biography.{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=xxvii}}\n\nIn 1867, the family moved to England to aid their father, John, to further his career as an artist. At first, the Yeats children were educated at home. Their mother entertained them with stories and Irish folktales. John provided an erratic education in geography and chemistry and took William on natural history explorations of the nearby [[Slough]] countryside.{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=24}} On 26 January 1877, the young poet entered the [[Godolphin and Latymer School|Godolphin school]],{{sfn|Hone|1943|p=28}} which he attended for four years. He did not distinguish himself academically, and an early school report describes his performance as \"only fair. Perhaps better in Latin than in any other subject. Very poor in spelling\".{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=25}} Though he had difficulty with mathematics and languages (possibly because he was [[tone deafness|tone deaf]]<ref>Sessa, Anne Dzamba; ''Richard Wagner and the English''; p. 130. {{ISBN|0-8386-2055-8}}</ref>), he was fascinated by biology and zoology. In 1879 the family moved to [[Bedford Park, London|Bedford Park]] taking a two-year lease on 8 Woodstock Road.<ref name=chiswick>[http://www.chiswickw4.com/default.asp?section=info&page=conyeats.htm Yeats in Bedford Park], chiswickw4.com</ref> For financial reasons, the family returned to Dublin toward the end of 1880, living at first in the suburbs of [[Harold's Cross]]{{sfn|Jordan|2003|p=119}} and later [[Howth]]. In October 1881, Yeats resumed his education at Dublin's [[The High School, Dublin|Erasmus Smith High School]].{{sfn|Hone|1943|p=33}} His father's studio was nearby and William spent a great deal of time there, where he met many of the city's artists and writers. During this period he started writing poetry, and, in 1885, the ''Dublin University Review'' published Yeats's first poems, as well as an essay entitled \"The Poetry of [[Samuel Ferguson|Sir Samuel Ferguson]]\". Between 1884 and 1886, William attended the Metropolitan School of Art\u2014now the [[National College of Art and Design]]\u2014in [[Thomas Street, Dublin|Thomas Street]].<ref name=\"NYTObit\" /> In March 1888 the family moved to 3 Blenheim Road in Bedford Park.<ref>[https://www.wnblog.co.uk/2013/04/the-attraction-of-bedford-park/ \"The attraction of Bedford Park\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181019001450/https://www.wnblog.co.uk/2013/04/the-attraction-of-bedford-park/ |date=19 October 2018 }} by Amy Davies, 8 April 2013, [[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]]</ref> The rent on the house was \u00a350 a year.<ref name=chiswick />\n\nHe began writing his first works when he was seventeen; these included a poem\u2014heavily influenced by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]\u2014that describes a magician who set up a throne in central Asia. Other pieces from this period include a draft of a play about a bishop, a monk, and a woman accused of paganism by local shepherds, as well as love-poems and narrative lyrics on German knights. The early works were both conventional and, according to the critic Charles Johnston, \"utterly unIrish\", seeming to come out of a \"vast murmurous gloom of dreams\".{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=37}} Although Yeats's early works drew heavily on Shelley, [[Edmund Spenser]], and on the diction and colouring of [[pre-Raphaelite]] verse, he soon turned to [[Irish mythology|Irish mythology and folklore]] and the writings of [[William Blake]]. In later life, Yeats paid tribute to Blake by describing him as one of the \"great artificers of God who uttered great truths to a little clan\".<ref>[[Tom Paulin|Paulin, Tom]].

The influence of [[Oscar Wilde]] is evident in Yeats's theory of aesthetics, especially in his stage plays, and runs like a motif through his early works.{{sfn|Doody|2018|pp=10\u201312}} The theory of masks, developed by Wilde in his polemic ''[[The Decay of Lying]]'' can clearly be seen in Yeats's play ''The Player Queen'',{{sfn|Doody|2018|pp=116\u2013123}} while the more sensual characterisation of Salom\u00e9, in Wilde's [[Salome (play)|play of the same name]], provides the template for the changes Yeats made in his later plays, especially in ''[[On Baile's Strand]]'' (1904), ''Deirdre'' (1907), and his dance play ''The King of the Great Clock Tower'' (1934).{{sfn|Doody|2018|pp=207, 280}}\n\n=== Young poet ===\n[[File:William Butler Yeats by John Butler Yeats 1900.jpg|upright|thumb|1900 portrait by Yeats's father, [[John Butler Yeats]]]]\nThe family returned to London in 1887. In March 1890 Yeats joined the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], and with [[Ernest Rhys]]{{sfn|Hone|1943|p=83}} co-founded the [[Rhymers' Club]], a group of London-based poets who met regularly in a Fleet Street tavern to recite their verse.

The piece was serialized in the ''Dublin University Review''. Yeats wished to include it in his first collection, but it was deemed too long, and in fact, was never republished in his lifetime. Quinx Books published the poem in complete form for the first time in 2014. His first solo publication was the pamphlet ''Mosada: A Dramatic Poem'' (1886), which comprised a print run of 100 copies paid for by his father. This was followed by the collection ''[[The Wanderings of Oisin]] and Other Poems'' (1889), which arranged a series of verse that dated as far back as the mid-1880s. The long title poem contains, in the words of his biographer [[R. F. Foster (historian)|R. F.

''Oisin'' introduces what was to become one of his most important themes: the appeal of the life of contemplation over the appeal of the life of action. Following the work, Yeats never again attempted another long poem. His other early poems, which are meditations on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects, include ''Poems'' (1895), ''The Secret Rose'' (1897), and ''The Wind Among the Reeds'' (1899).

The society held its first meeting on 16 June, with Yeats acting as its chairman. The same year, the Dublin Theosophical lodge was opened in conjunction with Brahmin [[Mohini Mohun Chatterji|Mohini Chatterjee]], who travelled from the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical Society]] in London to lecture. Yeats attended his first [[s\u00e9ance]] the following year. He later became heavily involved with the Theosophy and with [[hermeticism]], particularly with the eclectic [[Rosicrucianism]] of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]. During s\u00e9ances held from 1912, a spirit calling itself \"Leo Africanus\" apparently claimed it was Yeats's ''[[Daemon (mythology)|Daemon]]'' or anti-self, inspiring some of the speculations in ''Per Amica Silentia Lunae''.<ref>Nally, Claire V. \"National Identity Formation in W.

He was horrified by Gonne's marriage, at losing his muse to another man; in addition, her conversion to Catholicism before marriage offended him; Yeats was Protestant/agnostic. He worried his muse would come under the influence of the priests and do their bidding.<ref>{{harvnb|Jordan|2003|pp=139\u2013153}}; {{harvnb|Jordan|1997|pp=83\u201388}}</ref>\n\nGonne's marriage to MacBride was a disaster. This pleased Yeats, as Gonne began to visit him in London. After the birth of her son, [[Se\u00e1n MacBride]], in 1904, Gonne and MacBride agreed to end the marriage, although they were unable to agree on the child's welfare. Despite the use of intermediaries, a divorce case ensued in Paris in 1905. Gonne made a series of allegations against her husband with Yeats as her main 'second', though he did not attend court or travel to France. A divorce was not granted, for the only accusation that held up in court was that MacBride had been drunk once during the marriage. A separation was granted, with Gonne having custody of the baby and MacBride having visiting rights.{{sfn|Jordan|2000|pp=13\u2013141}}\n\n[[File:Portrait drawing of WB Yeats by JS Sargent.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Charcoal portrait of Yeats by [[John Singer Sargent]] (1908)]]\n\nYeats's friendship with Gonne ended, yet, in Paris in 1908, they finally consummated their relationship. \"The long years of fidelity rewarded at last\" was how another of his lovers described the event. Yeats was less sentimental and later remarked that \"the tragedy of sexual intercourse is the perpetual virginity of the soul.\"<ref name=\"Cahill\" /> The relationship did not develop into a new phase after their night together, and soon afterwards Gonne wrote to the poet indicating that despite the physical consummation, they could not continue as they had been: \"I have prayed so hard to have all earthly desire taken from my love for you and dearest, loving you as I do, I have prayed and I am praying still that the bodily desire for me may be taken from you too.\"{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=394}} By January 1909, Gonne was sending Yeats letters praising the advantage given to artists who abstain from sex. Nearly twenty years later, Yeats recalled the night with Gonne in his poem \"A Man Young and Old\":{{sfn|Malins|Purkis|1994|page=124}}\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">My arms are like the twisted thorn\nAnd yet there beauty lay;\nThe first of all the tribe lay there\nAnd did such pleasure take;\nShe who had brought great [[Hector]] down\nAnd put all Troy to wreck.</poem>\n\nIn 1896, Yeats was introduced to [[Lady Gregory]] by their mutual friend [[Edward Martyn]]. Gregory encouraged Yeats's nationalism and convinced him to continue focusing on writing drama. Although he was influenced by French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], Yeats concentrated on an identifiably Irish content and this inclination was reinforced by his involvement with a new generation of younger and emerging Irish authors. Together with Lady Gregory, Martyn, and other writers including [[John Millington Synge|J. M. Synge]], [[Se\u00e1n O'Casey]], and [[Padraic Colum]], Yeats was one of those responsible for the establishment of the \"[[Irish Literary Revival]]\" movement.<ref>Corcoran, Neil. ''After Yeats and Joyce: Reading Modern Irish Literature''. Oxford University Press, 1997, p. viii</ref> Apart from these creative writers, much of the impetus for the Revival came from the work of scholarly translators who were aiding in the discovery of both the ancient sagas and Ossianic poetry and the more recent folk song tradition in Irish. One of the most significant of these was [[Douglas Hyde]], later the first President of Ireland, whose ''Love Songs of Connacht'' was widely admired.\n\n=== Abbey Theatre ===\n{{main|Abbey Theatre}}\n[[File:WBYeats1908.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Yeats photographed in 1908 by [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]]]]\nIn 1899, Yeats, Lady Gregory, Edward Martyn and [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]] began the [[Irish Literary Theatre]] to present Irish plays.{{sfn|Foster|2003|pp=486, 662}} The ideals of the Abbey were derived from the avant-garde French theatre, which sought to express the \"ascendancy of the playwright rather than the actor-manager ''\u00e0 l'anglais''.\"{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=183}}<ref>Text reproduced from Yeats's own handwritten draft.</ref> The group's manifesto, which Yeats wrote, declared, \"We hope to find in Ireland an uncorrupted & imaginative audience trained to listen by its passion for oratory&nbsp;... & that freedom to experiment which is not found in the theatres of England, & without which no new movement in art or literature can succeed.\"{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=184}}\n\nThe collective survived for about two years but was not successful. Working with two Irish brothers with theatrical experience, [[William Fay|William]] and [[Frank Fay (Irish actor)|Frank Fay]], Yeats's unpaid yet independently wealthy secretary [[Annie Horniman]], and the leading [[West End theatre|West End]] actress [[Florence Farr]], the group established the [[Irish National Theatre Society]]. Along with Synge, they acquired property in Dublin and on 27 December 1904 opened the [[Abbey Theatre]]. Yeats's play ''[[Cathleen ni Houlihan (play)|Cathleen ni Houlihan]]'' and Lady Gregory's ''Spreading the News'' were featured on the opening night. Yeats remained involved with the Abbey until his death, both as a member of the board and a prolific playwright. In 1902, he helped set up the [[Dun Emer Press]] to publish work by writers associated with the Revival. This became the [[Cuala Press]] in 1904, and inspired by the Arts and Crafts Movement, sought to \"find work for Irish hands in the making of beautiful things.\"<ref>[http://www.tcd.ie/Secretary/Communications/Press_Releases/PR0203/PRirishgenius.htm \"Irish Genius: The Yeats Family and The Cuala Press\"].

Pound had travelled to London at least partly to meet the older man, whom he considered \"the only poet worthy of serious study.\"<ref>Monroe, Harriet (1913). \"Poetry\". (Chicago) Modern Poetry Association. 123</ref> From that year until 1916, the two men wintered in the Stone Cottage at [[Ashdown Forest]], with Pound nominally acting as Yeats's secretary. The relationship got off to a rocky start when Pound arranged for the publication in the magazine ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' of some of Yeats's verse with Pound's own unauthorised alterations. These changes reflected Pound's distaste for Victorian prosody. A more indirect influence was the scholarship on Japanese [[Noh]] plays that Pound had obtained from [[Ernest Fenollosa]]'s widow, which provided Yeats with a model for the aristocratic drama he intended to write. The first of his plays modelled on Noh was ''At the Hawk's Well'', the first draft of which he dictated to Pound in January 1916.<ref>Sands, Maren. \"[http://writing.colostate.edu/gallery/phantasmagoria/sands.htm The Influence of Japanese Noh Theater on Yeats]\". Colorado State University. Retrieved on 15 July 2007.</ref>\n\nThe emergence of a nationalist revolutionary movement from the ranks of the mostly Roman Catholic lower-middle and working class made Yeats reassess some of his attitudes. In the refrain of \"[[Easter, 1916]]\" (\"All changed, changed utterly / A terrible beauty is born\"), Yeats faces his own failure to recognise the merits of the leaders of the [[Easter Rising]], due to his attitude towards their ordinary backgrounds and lives.{{sfn|Foster|2003|pp=59\u201366}}\n\nYeats was close to Lady Gregory and her home place of Coole Park, Co, Galway. He would often visit and stay there as it was a central meeting place for people who supported the resurgence of Irish literature and cultural traditions. His poem, \"[[The Wild Swans at Coole (poem)|The Wild Swans at Coole]]\" was written there, between 1916 and 1917.\n\nHe wrote prefaces for two books of Irish mythological tales, compiled by [[Augusta, Lady Gregory]]: ''[[Cuchulain of Muirthemne]]'' (1902), and ''[[Gods and Fighting Men]]'' (1904). In the preface of the latter, he wrote: \"One must not expect in these stories the epic lineaments, the many incidents, woven into one great event of, let us say the War for the Brown Bull of Cuailgne or that of the last gathering at Muirthemne.\"<ref>{{citation |title= Gods and Fighting Men: The Story of the Tuatha de Danann and of the Fianna of Ireland |first= Augusta |last= Lady Gregory |authorlink= Augusta, Lady Gregory |year= 1904 |url= https://archive.org/details/godsfightingmens00gregrich | page = xiv}}</ref>\n\n=== Politics ===\nYeats was an [[Irish Nationalist]], who sought a kind of traditional lifestyle articulated through poems such as 'The Fisherman'. However, as his life progressed, he sheltered much of his revolutionary spirit and distanced himself from the [[Irish War of Independence|intense political landscape]] until [[Irish Civil War|1922]], when he was appointed Senator for the [[Irish Free State]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sanford|first1=John|title=Roy Foster: Yeats emerged as poet of Irish Revolution, despite past political beliefs|url=https://news.stanford.edu/news/2001/april18/foster-418.html|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=7 May 2018|date=18 April 2001}}</ref>{{sfn|Ellmann|1948|p=244}}\n\nIn the earlier part of his life, Yeats was a member of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]].<ref>Sternlicht, Sanford V.

He was a fierce opponent of individualism and political liberalism and saw the fascist movements as a triumph of public order and the needs of the national collective over petty individualism. On the other hand, he was also an elitist who abhorred the idea of mob-rule, and saw democracy as a threat to good governance and public order.<ref>Nally, Claire. 2010. ''Envisioning Ireland: W. B.

F. Foster has observed that Yeats's last offer was motivated more by a sense of duty than by a genuine desire to marry her.\n\nYeats proposed in an indifferent manner, with conditions attached, and he both expected and hoped she would turn him down. According to Foster, \"when he duly asked Maud to marry him and was duly refused, his thoughts shifted with surprising speed to her daughter.\" [[Iseult Gonne]] was Maud's second child with [[Lucien Millevoye]], and at the time was twenty-one years old. She had lived a sad life to this point; conceived as an attempt to reincarnate her short-lived brother, for the first few years of her life she was presented as her mother's adopted niece.

The couple went on to have two children, [[Anne Yeats|Anne]] and [[Michael Yeats|Michael]]. Although in later years he had romantic relationships with other women, Georgie herself wrote to her husband \"When you are dead, people will talk about your love affairs, but I shall say nothing, for I will remember how proud you were.\"<ref>Brown, Terence.

B. Yeats bibliography|:Category:Works by W. B. Yeats}}\n\nYeats is considered one of the key twentieth-century English-language poets. He was a [[Symbolist]] poet, using allusive imagery and symbolic structures throughout his career. He chose words and assembled them so that, in addition to a particular meaning, they suggest abstract thoughts that may seem more significant and resonant. His use of symbols<ref>[[Barry Ulanov|Ulanov, Barry]]. ''Makers of the Modern Theater''. McGraw-Hill, 1961</ref> is usually something physical that is both itself and a suggestion of other, perhaps immaterial, timeless qualities.<ref>Gale Research International. ''Twentieth Century Literary Criticism'', No. 116''. Gale Cengage Learning, 2002, p. 303</ref>\n\nUnlike other [[modernism|modernists]] who experimented with [[free verse]], Yeats was a master of the traditional forms.<ref>Finneran, Richard. ''Yeats: An Annual of Critical and Textual Studies 1995''. University of Michigan Press, 1997. 82</ref> The impact of modernism on his work can be seen in the increasing abandonment of the more conventionally poetic diction of his early work in favour of the more austere language and more direct approach to his themes that increasingly characterises the poetry and plays of his middle period, comprising the volumes ''In the Seven Woods'', ''Responsibilities'' and ''The Green Helmet''.<ref>Logenbach, James. ''Stone Cottage: Pound, Yeats, and Modernism''. Oxford University Press, 1988, pp. 13\u201314</ref> His later poetry and plays are written in a more personal vein, and the works written in the last twenty years of his life include mention of his son and daughter,<ref>Bell, Vereen. ''Yeats and the logic of formalism''. University of Missouri Press, 2006. 132</ref> as well as meditations on the experience of growing old.{{sfn|Seiden|1962|p=179}} In his poem, \"[[The Circus Animals' Desertion]]\", he describes the inspiration for these late works:\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">Now that my ladder's gone\nI must lie down where all the ladders start\nIn the foul [[rag and bone]] shop of the heart.{{sfnp|O'Neill|2003|p=6}}</poem>\n\nDuring 1929, he stayed at [[Thoor Ballylee]] near [[Gort]] in [[County Galway]] (where Yeats had his summer home since 1919) for the last time. Much of the remainder of his life was lived outside Ireland, although he did lease [[Riversdale]] house in the Dublin suburb of [[Rathfarnham]] in 1932. He wrote prolifically through his final years, and published poetry, plays, and prose. In 1938, he attended the Abbey for the final time to see the premiere of his play ''[[Purgatory (drama)|Purgatory]]''. His ''Autobiographies of William Butler Yeats'' was published that same year.<ref>Martin, Wallace. Review of \"Tragic Knowledge: Yeats' \"Autobiography\" and Hermeneutics\" by Daniel T. O'Hara.

His work can be divided into three general periods. The early poems are lushly pre-Raphaelite in tone, self-consciously ornate, and, at times, according to unsympathetic critics, stilted. Yeats began by writing epic poems such as ''The Isle of Statues'' and ''[[The Wanderings of Oisin]]''.<ref>Howes, Marjorie. ''Yeats's nations: gender, class, and Irishness''. Cambridge University Press, 1998, pp. 28\u201331</ref> His other early poems are lyrics on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects. Yeats's middle period saw him abandon the pre-Raphaelite character of his early work{{sfn|Seiden|1962|p=153}} and attempt to turn himself into a [[Walter Savage Landor|Landor]]-style social ironist.<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''Yeats''. Oxford University Press, 1972, p. 168 {{ISBN|0-19-501603-3}}</ref>\n\nCritics who admire his middle work might characterize it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system he began to work out for himself under the influence of [[spiritualism]]. In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly-minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of ''The Wanderings of Oisin'', is reproduced in ''A Dialogue Between Self and Soul''.<ref>[[Kathleen Raine|Raine, Kathleen]]. ''Yeats the Initiate''. New York: Barnes & Noble, 1990, pp. 327\u2013329. {{ISBN|0-389-20951-1}}</ref>\n\nSome critics claim that Yeats spanned the transition from the nineteenth century into twentieth-century modernism in poetry much as [[Pablo Picasso]] did in painting while others question whether late Yeats has much in common with modernists of the [[Ezra Pound]] and [[T. S. Eliot]] variety.<ref>Holdeman, David. ''The Cambridge Introduction to W. B. Yeats''. Cambridge University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|9780521547376}}, p. 80</ref>\n\nModernists read the well-known poem \"[[The Second Coming (poem)|The Second Coming]]\" as a dirge for the decline of European civilisation, but it also expresses Yeats's apocalyptic mystical theories and is shaped by the 1890s. His most important collections of poetry started with ''The Green Helmet'' (1910) and ''Responsibilities'' (1914). In imagery, Yeats's poetry became sparer and more powerful as he grew older. ''The Tower'' (1928), ''The Winding Stair'' (1933), and ''New Poems'' (1938) contained some of the most potent images in twentieth-century poetry.<ref>Spanos, William. \u2033Sacramental Imagery in the Middle and Late Poetry of W.

G. ''Transforming the Center, Eroding the Margins''. University of Rochester Press, 2004, p. 282. {{ISBN|1-58046-175-1}}</ref> which some critics have judged as lacking in intellectual credibility.

While his family was broadly supportive of the changes Ireland was experiencing, the nationalist revival of the late 19th century directly disadvantaged his heritage and informed his outlook for the remainder of his life. In 1997, his biographer [[R. F. Foster (historian)|R. F.

The 1880s saw the rise of [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and the [[home rule]] movement; the 1890s saw the momentum of nationalism, while the Catholics became prominent around the turn of the century. These developments had a profound effect on his poetry, and his subsequent explorations of Irish identity had a significant influence on the creation of his country's biography.{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=xxvii}}\n\nIn 1867, the family moved to England to aid their father, John, to further his career as an artist. At first, the Yeats children were educated at home. Their mother entertained them with stories and Irish folktales.

The piece was serialized in the ''Dublin University Review''. Yeats wished to include it in his first collection, but it was deemed too long, and in fact, was never republished in his lifetime. Quinx Books published the poem in complete form for the first time in 2014. His first solo publication was the pamphlet ''Mosada: A Dramatic Poem'' (1886), which comprised a print run of 100 copies paid for by his father. This was followed by the collection ''[[The Wanderings of Oisin]] and Other Poems'' (1889), which arranged a series of verse that dated as far back as the mid-1880s. The long title poem contains, in the words of his biographer [[R. F. Foster (historian)|R. F.

''Oisin'' introduces what was to become one of his most important themes: the appeal of the life of contemplation over the appeal of the life of action. Following the work, Yeats never again attempted another long poem. His other early poems, which are meditations on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects, include ''Poems'' (1895), ''The Secret Rose'' (1897), and ''The Wind Among the Reeds'' (1899).

After the birth of her son, [[Se\u00e1n MacBride]], in 1904, Gonne and MacBride agreed to end the marriage, although they were unable to agree on the child's welfare. Despite the use of intermediaries, a divorce case ensued in Paris in 1905. Gonne made a series of allegations against her husband with Yeats as her main 'second', though he did not attend court or travel to France. A divorce was not granted, for the only accusation that held up in court was that MacBride had been drunk once during the marriage. A separation was granted, with Gonne having custody of the baby and MacBride having visiting rights.{{sfn|Jordan|2000|pp=13\u2013141}}\n\n[[File:Portrait drawing of WB Yeats by JS Sargent.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Charcoal portrait of Yeats by [[John Singer Sargent]] (1908)]]\n\nYeats's friendship with Gonne ended, yet, in Paris in 1908, they finally consummated their relationship. \"The long years of fidelity rewarded at last\" was how another of his lovers described the event. Yeats was less sentimental and later remarked that \"the tragedy of sexual intercourse is the perpetual virginity of the soul.\"<ref name=\"Cahill\" /> The relationship did not develop into a new phase after their night together, and soon afterwards Gonne wrote to the poet indicating that despite the physical consummation, they could not continue as they had been: \"I have prayed so hard to have all earthly desire taken from my love for you and dearest, loving you as I do, I have prayed and I am praying still that the bodily desire for me may be taken from you too.\"{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=394}} By January 1909, Gonne was sending Yeats letters praising the advantage given to artists who abstain from sex. Nearly twenty years later, Yeats recalled the night with Gonne in his poem \"A Man Young and Old\":{{sfn|Malins|Purkis|1994|page=124}}\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">My arms are like the twisted thorn\nAnd yet there beauty lay;\nThe first of all the tribe lay there\nAnd did such pleasure take;\nShe who had brought great [[Hector]] down\nAnd put all Troy to wreck.</poem>\n\nIn 1896, Yeats was introduced to [[Lady Gregory]] by their mutual friend [[Edward Martyn]]. Gregory encouraged Yeats's nationalism and convinced him to continue focusing on writing drama. Although he was influenced by French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], Yeats concentrated on an identifiably Irish content and this inclination was reinforced by his involvement with a new generation of younger and emerging Irish authors. Together with Lady Gregory, Martyn, and other writers including [[John Millington Synge|J. M. Synge]], [[Se\u00e1n O'Casey]], and [[Padraic Colum]], Yeats was one of those responsible for the establishment of the \"[[Irish Literary Revival]]\" movement.<ref>Corcoran, Neil. ''After Yeats and Joyce: Reading Modern Irish Literature''. Oxford University Press, 1997, p. viii</ref> Apart from these creative writers, much of the impetus for the Revival came from the work of scholarly translators who were aiding in the discovery of both the ancient sagas and Ossianic poetry and the more recent folk song tradition in Irish. One of the most significant of these was [[Douglas Hyde]], later the first President of Ireland, whose ''Love Songs of Connacht'' was widely admired.\n\n=== Abbey Theatre ===\n{{main|Abbey Theatre}}\n[[File:WBYeats1908.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Yeats photographed in 1908 by [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]]]]\nIn 1899, Yeats, Lady Gregory, Edward Martyn and [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]] began the [[Irish Literary Theatre]] to present Irish plays.{{sfn|Foster|2003|pp=486, 662}} The ideals of the Abbey were derived from the avant-garde French theatre, which sought to express the \"ascendancy of the playwright rather than the actor-manager ''\u00e0 l'anglais''.\"{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=183}}<ref>Text reproduced from Yeats's own handwritten draft.</ref> The group's manifesto, which Yeats wrote, declared, \"We hope to find in Ireland an uncorrupted & imaginative audience trained to listen by its passion for oratory&nbsp;... & that freedom to experiment which is not found in the theatres of England, & without which no new movement in art or literature can succeed.\"{{sfn|Foster|1997|p=184}}\n\nThe collective survived for about two years but was not successful. Working with two Irish brothers with theatrical experience, [[William Fay|William]] and [[Frank Fay (Irish actor)|Frank Fay]], Yeats's unpaid yet independently wealthy secretary [[Annie Horniman]], and the leading [[West End theatre|West End]] actress [[Florence Farr]], the group established the [[Irish National Theatre Society]]. Along with Synge, they acquired property in Dublin and on 27 December 1904 opened the [[Abbey Theatre]]. Yeats's play ''[[Cathleen ni Houlihan (play)|Cathleen ni Houlihan]]'' and Lady Gregory's ''Spreading the News'' were featured on the opening night. Yeats remained involved with the Abbey until his death, both as a member of the board and a prolific playwright. In 1902, he helped set up the [[Dun Emer Press]] to publish work by writers associated with the Revival. This became the [[Cuala Press]] in 1904, and inspired by the Arts and Crafts Movement, sought to \"find work for Irish hands in the making of beautiful things.\"<ref>[http://www.tcd.ie/Secretary/Communications/Press_Releases/PR0203/PRirishgenius.htm \"Irish Genius: The Yeats Family and The Cuala Press\"].

(Chicago) Modern Poetry Association. 123</ref> From that year until 1916, the two men wintered in the Stone Cottage at [[Ashdown Forest]], with Pound nominally acting as Yeats's secretary. The relationship got off to a rocky start when Pound arranged for the publication in the magazine ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' of some of Yeats's verse with Pound's own unauthorised alterations. These changes reflected Pound's distaste for Victorian prosody. A more indirect influence was the scholarship on Japanese [[Noh]] plays that Pound had obtained from [[Ernest Fenollosa]]'s widow, which provided Yeats with a model for the aristocratic drama he intended to write. The first of his plays modelled on Noh was ''At the Hawk's Well'', the first draft of which he dictated to Pound in January 1916.<ref>Sands, Maren. \"[http://writing.colostate.edu/gallery/phantasmagoria/sands.htm The Influence of Japanese Noh Theater on Yeats]\". Colorado State University. Retrieved on 15 July 2007.</ref>\n\nThe emergence of a nationalist revolutionary movement from the ranks of the mostly Roman Catholic lower-middle and working class made Yeats reassess some of his attitudes. In the refrain of \"[[Easter, 1916]]\" (\"All changed, changed utterly / A terrible beauty is born\"), Yeats faces his own failure to recognise the merits of the leaders of the [[Easter Rising]], due to his attitude towards their ordinary backgrounds and lives.{{sfn|Foster|2003|pp=59\u201366}}\n\nYeats was close to Lady Gregory and her home place of Coole Park, Co, Galway. He would often visit and stay there as it was a central meeting place for people who supported the resurgence of Irish literature and cultural traditions. His poem, \"[[The Wild Swans at Coole (poem)|The Wild Swans at Coole]]\" was written there, between 1916 and 1917.\n\nHe wrote prefaces for two books of Irish mythological tales, compiled by [[Augusta, Lady Gregory]]: ''[[Cuchulain of Muirthemne]]'' (1902), and ''[[Gods and Fighting Men]]'' (1904). In the preface of the latter, he wrote: \"One must not expect in these stories the epic lineaments, the many incidents, woven into one great event of, let us say the War for the Brown Bull of Cuailgne or that of the last gathering at Muirthemne.\"<ref>{{citation |title= Gods and Fighting Men: The Story of the Tuatha de Danann and of the Fianna of Ireland |first= Augusta |last= Lady Gregory |authorlink= Augusta, Lady Gregory |year= 1904 |url= https://archive.org/details/godsfightingmens00gregrich | page = xiv}}</ref>\n\n=== Politics ===\nYeats was an [[Irish Nationalist]], who sought a kind of traditional lifestyle articulated through poems such as 'The Fisherman'. However, as his life progressed, he sheltered much of his revolutionary spirit and distanced himself from the [[Irish War of Independence|intense political landscape]] until [[Irish Civil War|1922]], when he was appointed Senator for the [[Irish Free State]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sanford|first1=John|title=Roy Foster: Yeats emerged as poet of Irish Revolution, despite past political beliefs|url=https://news.stanford.edu/news/2001/april18/foster-418.html|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=7 May 2018|date=18 April 2001}}</ref>{{sfn|Ellmann|1948|p=244}}\n\nIn the earlier part of his life, Yeats was a member of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]].<ref>Sternlicht, Sanford V. ''A Reader's Guide to Modern Irish Drama'', Syracuse University Press, 1998, p. 48</ref> Due to the escalating tension of the political scene, Yeats distanced himself from the core political activism in the midst of the [[Easter Rising]], even holding back his poetry inspired by the events until 1920.\n\nIn the 1930s Yeats was fascinated with the authoritarian, anti-democratic, nationalist movements of Europe, and he composed several marching songs for the [[Blueshirts]], although they were never used. He was a fierce opponent of individualism and political liberalism and saw the fascist movements as a triumph of public order and the needs of the national collective over petty individualism. On the other hand, he was also an elitist who abhorred the idea of mob-rule, and saw democracy as a threat to good governance and public order.<ref>Nally, Claire. 2010. ''Envisioning Ireland: W. B.

F. Foster has observed that Yeats's last offer was motivated more by a sense of duty than by a genuine desire to marry her.\n\nYeats proposed in an indifferent manner, with conditions attached, and he both expected and hoped she would turn him down. According to Foster, \"when he duly asked Maud to marry him and was duly refused, his thoughts shifted with surprising speed to her daughter.\" [[Iseult Gonne]] was Maud's second child with [[Lucien Millevoye]], and at the time was twenty-one years old. She had lived a sad life to this point; conceived as an attempt to reincarnate her short-lived brother, for the first few years of her life she was presented as her mother's adopted niece.

At fifteen, she proposed to Yeats. In 1917, he proposed to Iseult but was rejected.\n\nThat September, Yeats proposed to 25-year-old [[Georgie Hyde-Lees]] (1892\u20131968), known as George, whom he had met through Olivia Shakespear. Despite warnings from her friends\u2014\"George&nbsp;... you can't.

The couple went on to have two children, [[Anne Yeats|Anne]] and [[Michael Yeats|Michael]]. Although in later years he had romantic relationships with other women, Georgie herself wrote to her husband \"When you are dead, people will talk about your love affairs, but I shall say nothing, for I will remember how proud you were.\"<ref>Brown, Terence.

During the aftermath of the First World War, he became sceptical about the efficacy of democratic government, and anticipated political reconstruction in Europe through totalitarian rule.{{sfn|Foster|2003|p=468}} His later association with Pound drew him towards [[Benito Mussolini]], for whom he expressed admiration on a number of occasions.<ref name=\"Moses\" /> He wrote three \"marching songs\"\u2014never used\u2014for the Irish General [[Eoin O'Duffy]]'s [[Blueshirts]].\n\n[[File:Chantry House, Steyning.jpg|thumb|[[Chantry House, Steyning|Chantry House]], [[Steyning]].

His work can be divided into three general periods. The early poems are lushly pre-Raphaelite in tone, self-consciously ornate, and, at times, according to unsympathetic critics, stilted. Yeats began by writing epic poems such as ''The Isle of Statues'' and ''[[The Wanderings of Oisin]]''.<ref>Howes, Marjorie. ''Yeats's nations: gender, class, and Irishness''. Cambridge University Press, 1998, pp. 28\u201331</ref> His other early poems are lyrics on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects. Yeats's middle period saw him abandon the pre-Raphaelite character of his early work{{sfn|Seiden|1962|p=153}} and attempt to turn himself into a [[Walter Savage Landor|Landor]]-style social ironist.<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''Yeats''. Oxford University Press, 1972, p. 168 {{ISBN|0-19-501603-3}}</ref>\n\nCritics who admire his middle work might characterize it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system he began to work out for himself under the influence of [[spiritualism]]. In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly-minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of ''The Wanderings of Oisin'', is reproduced in ''A Dialogue Between Self and Soul''.<ref>[[Kathleen Raine|Raine, Kathleen]]. ''Yeats the Initiate''.

S. Eliot]] variety.<ref>Holdeman, David. ''The Cambridge Introduction to W. B. Yeats''. Cambridge University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|9780521547376}}, p. 80</ref>\n\nModernists read the well-known poem \"[[The Second Coming (poem)|The Second Coming]]\" as a dirge for the decline of European civilisation, but it also expresses Yeats's apocalyptic mystical theories and is shaped by the 1890s. His most important collections of poetry started with ''The Green Helmet'' (1910) and ''Responsibilities'' (1914). In imagery, Yeats's poetry became sparer and more powerful as he grew older. ''The Tower'' (1928), ''The Winding Stair'' (1933), and ''New Poems'' (1938) contained some of the most potent images in twentieth-century poetry.<ref>Spanos, William. \u2033Sacramental Imagery in the Middle and Late Poetry of W.

Formed in 1740 the Battery is currently part of [[5th Regiment Royal Artillery]] and is based at [[Marne Barracks|Marne]] Barracks, [[Catterick, North Yorkshire]].The Battery operates in a [[Surveillance and Target Acquisition]] role.\n\n==Coat of Arms==\n[[File:Blason ca Province Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse (1867-1929).svg|thumb|left|Former Shield of Nova Scotia]]\n\nThe Battery coat of arms is a gold-blue-gold stable belt derived from the [[Coat of arms of Nova Scotia|\"Shield\" of Nova Scotia 1867\u20131929]], representing the earth banks either side of the St Lawrence River as authorised circa 1904.

In 1745 the Company departed for the new territories, newly acquired from the French, in Canada and commenced garrison duties. From 1751 to 1758, the Company was commanded by Captain Charles Brome.\n\n===Seven Years' War===\nIt was in 1758 that the second [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|Battle of Louisbourg]] took place, and the Company, commanded by Captain T Ord from 23 May 1758, played a pivotal role in securing the town. The [[honour title]] \"Louisburg\" commemorates the first stage of the campaign in Canada against the French in the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|Siege of Louisbourg]]; it was first launched from [[City of Halifax|Halifax (Nova Scotia)]]. The Company's contribution to the siege was an integral part of the sea-borne assault to capture the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] which would allow the [[Royal Navy]] to sail down the [[St. Lawrence River]] for an attack on [[Quebec]] unmolested. The ground around Louisburg did not lend itself well to artillery, being composed mainly of swamp and marsh.\n\nIn honour of the Company Commander during the battle, Captain T Ord, the Battery HQ Troop is called \"Ord\u2019s\" Troop.  \"A\" Troop is named after Captain J Anderson who commanded the Company in 1858 during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] and \"B\" Troop after Captain N S K Bayliss who was Company Commander in 1855 during the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)]]. The Company served in Canada until 1766 and then spent the rest of the eighteenth century in various theatres of the [[British Empire]] including the Mediterranean and the Caribbean.\n\n===Nineteenth century===\nThe Company bombarded the French invasion fleet in Dieppe in 1801 and taking part in the [[Siege of Copenhagen]] in 1807.  The Company then spent a long deployment in Ireland from 1811 until 1849 when it took up coastal defence duties. At that time, all Batteries in the Royal Artillery were called \"companies\" and named after their Company Commander. In 1859, batteries were formed and the practice of naming the sub-units after their Commanders ceased and all new batteries were given either a letter or number. 53 (Louisburg) Battery is the second senior numbered Battery in the Royal Regiment of Artillery with 19/5 Gibraltar Battery being the senior. In recognition of the tremendous achievement of the Company during the Siege of Louisburg it was awarded the honour title 'Louisburg' on 3 May 1937. For the remainder of the nineteenth century the Battery, served around the British Empire in [[Aden]], India, [[Burma]] and Britain.  Notable achievements during this time included the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] and [[Afghanistan]]. In the Crimea, the Company took part in the Siege of Sebastopol, and the relief of Kandahar Garrison, Afghanistan in 1880.\n\n===Twentieth century===\nBy the early 1900s, the battery returned to Britain and became part of the coastal defence forces until 1926.  The battery then re-roled as a 'Heavy Gun' Battery until 1947. In 1947, the battery was reformed and armed with [[Bofors 40 mm|Bofors 40/L60 Mk 3]]. It became part of 22nd [[Anti-aircraft warfare|Light Anti Aircraft]] Regiment Royal Artillery based in Germany. It was later reequipped with [[Bofors 40 mm|Bofors 40/L70]] and [[List of radars|FCE (Fire Control Equipment) No 7 Radars]]. During the period of the Emergency in Eastern Pacific, the Battery deployed to [[Changi]], Singapore in 1964. The Battery then undertook a further tour to ensure stability in the region in 1966 to [[Tampin]] and [[Kuching]], [[Borneo]]. In 1969, the Battery title finally becomes recognisable as 53 (Louisburg) Light [[Air Defence]] Battery Royal Artillery.\n\nThe outbreak of [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland led to the Battery deploying in an infantry role in 1972 to [[Derry]]. It then undertook further tours to Northern Ireland in the following years: 1973, 1974, 1978, 1987, 1993, 1997, and 1999. The Battery also re-roled several times over this period with equipment changing from Bofors to the introduction of [[Rapier missile|Rapier]], Tracked Rapier, and finally Towed Rapier FSB2 (Field Standard B2). Elements from the Battery deployed in 1990 in support of the first Gulf War and the 1990s the Battery also deployed twice to Cyprus.\n\n22nd AD Regiment Royal Artillery was placed in suspended animation in April 2004 and the battery was assigned to 5th Regiment Royal Artillery in Marne Barracks, Catterick on 21 July 2004. It has since converted to a [[Surveillance and Target Acquisition]] (STA) Role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/artillery/career/8020.aspx |title=Gunner Radar Operator |quote=Mamba and Cobra are mobile weapon locating radar which detects rockets and mortar/artillery rounds in flight.

Formed in 1740 the Battery is currently part of [[5th Regiment Royal Artillery]] and is based at [[Marne Barracks|Marne]] Barracks, [[Catterick, North Yorkshire]].The Battery operates in a [[Surveillance and Target Acquisition]] role.\n\n==Coat of Arms==\n[[File:Blason ca Province Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse (1867-1929).svg|thumb|left|Former Shield of Nova Scotia]]\n\nThe Battery coat of arms is a gold-blue-gold stable belt derived from the [[Coat of arms of Nova Scotia|\"Shield\" of Nova Scotia 1867\u20131929]], representing the earth banks either side of the St Lawrence River as authorised circa 1904.

In 1745 the Company departed for the new territories, newly acquired from the French, in Canada and commenced garrison duties. From 1751 to 1758, the Company was commanded by Captain Charles Brome.\n\n===Seven Years' War===\nIt was in 1758 that the second [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|Battle of Louisbourg]] took place, and the Company, commanded by Captain T Ord from 23 May 1758, played a pivotal role in securing the town. The [[honour title]] \"Louisburg\" commemorates the first stage of the campaign in Canada against the French in the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|Siege of Louisbourg]]; it was first launched from [[City of Halifax|Halifax (Nova Scotia)]]. The Company's contribution to the siege was an integral part of the sea-borne assault to capture the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] which would allow the [[Royal Navy]] to sail down the [[St. Lawrence River]] for an attack on [[Quebec]] unmolested. The ground around Louisburg did not lend itself well to artillery, being composed mainly of swamp and marsh.\n\nIn honour of the Company Commander during the battle, Captain T Ord, the Battery HQ Troop is called \"Ord\u2019s\" Troop.  \"A\" Troop is named after Captain J Anderson who commanded the Company in 1858 during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] and \"B\" Troop after Captain N S K Bayliss who was Company Commander in 1855 during the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)]]. The Company served in Canada until 1766 and then spent the rest of the eighteenth century in various theatres of the [[British Empire]] including the Mediterranean and the Caribbean.\n\n===Nineteenth century===\nThe Company bombarded the French invasion fleet in Dieppe in 1801 and taking part in the [[Siege of Copenhagen]] in 1807.  The Company then spent a long deployment in Ireland from 1811 until 1849 when it took up coastal defence duties. At that time, all Batteries in the Royal Artillery were called \"companies\" and named after their Company Commander. In 1859, batteries were formed and the practice of naming the sub-units after their Commanders ceased and all new batteries were given either a letter or number. 53 (Louisburg) Battery is the second senior numbered Battery in the Royal Regiment of Artillery with 19/5 Gibraltar Battery being the senior. In recognition of the tremendous achievement of the Company during the Siege of Louisburg it was awarded the honour title 'Louisburg' on 3 May 1937. For the remainder of the nineteenth century the Battery, served around the British Empire in [[Aden]], India, [[Burma]] and Britain.  Notable achievements during this time included the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] and [[Afghanistan]]. In the Crimea, the Company took part in the Siege of Sebastopol, and the relief of Kandahar Garrison, Afghanistan in 1880.\n\n===Twentieth century===\nBy the early 1900s, the battery returned to Britain and became part of the coastal defence forces until 1926.  The battery then re-roled as a 'Heavy Gun' Battery until 1947. In 1947, the battery was reformed and armed with [[Bofors 40 mm|Bofors 40/L60 Mk 3]]. It became part of 22nd [[Anti-aircraft warfare|Light Anti Aircraft]] Regiment Royal Artillery based in Germany. It was later reequipped with [[Bofors 40 mm|Bofors 40/L70]] and [[List of radars|FCE (Fire Control Equipment) No 7 Radars]]. During the period of the Emergency in Eastern Pacific, the Battery deployed to [[Changi]], Singapore in 1964. The Battery then undertook a further tour to ensure stability in the region in 1966 to [[Tampin]] and [[Kuching]], [[Borneo]]. In 1969, the Battery title finally becomes recognisable as 53 (Louisburg) Light [[Air Defence]] Battery Royal Artillery.\n\nThe outbreak of [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland led to the Battery deploying in an infantry role in 1972 to [[Derry]]. It then undertook further tours to Northern Ireland in the following years: 1973, 1974, 1978, 1987, 1993, 1997, and 1999. The Battery also re-roled several times over this period with equipment changing from Bofors to the introduction of [[Rapier missile|Rapier]], Tracked Rapier, and finally Towed Rapier FSB2 (Field Standard B2). Elements from the Battery deployed in 1990 in support of the first Gulf War and the 1990s the Battery also deployed twice to Cyprus.\n\n22nd AD Regiment Royal Artillery was placed in suspended animation in April 2004 and the battery was assigned to 5th Regiment Royal Artillery in Marne Barracks, Catterick on 21 July 2004. It has since converted to a [[Surveillance and Target Acquisition]] (STA) Role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/artillery/career/8020.aspx |title=Gunner Radar Operator |quote=Mamba and Cobra are mobile weapon locating radar which detects rockets and mortar/artillery rounds in flight.
