The narration given over the opening title sequence used during the first 28 seasons by the seven housemates states some variation of the following:\n\n{{bq|1=This is the true story\u2026of seven strangers\u2026picked to live in a house\u2026(work together) and have their lives taped\u2026to find out what happens\u2026when people stop being polite\u2026and start getting real\u2026''The Real World''.}}\n\n''The Real World'' was originally inspired by the popularity of youth-oriented shows of the 1990s like ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' and ''[[Melrose Place]]''. Bunim and Murray initially considered developing a scripted series in a similar vein, but quickly decided that the cost of paying writers, actors, costume designers, and make-up artists was too high.<ref name=TheAVClub>Blake, Meredith (June 6, 2011).

[[Tracy Grandstaff]], one of the original seven picked for what has come to be known as \"[[The Real World: Pilot|Season 0]]\",{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} went on to minor fame as the voice of the animated ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'' character Daria Morgendorffer, who eventually got her own spinoff, ''[[Daria]]''. Dutch TV producer Erik Latour claims that the ideas for ''The Real World'' were directly derived from his television show ''[[Nummer 28]]'', which aired in 1991 on Dutch television.<ref name=Nummer28>Van den Boogaard, Raymond (September 28, 1996 ).

(Dutch).</ref> Bunim/Murray decided upon the cheaper idea of casting a bunch of \"regular people\" to live in an apartment and taping their day-to-day lives, believing seven diverse people would have enough of a basis upon which to interact without scripts. The production converted a massive, 4000-square-foot duplex in Soho, cast seven cast members from 500 applicants, and paid them $2,600 for their time on the show. The cast lived in the loft from February 16 to May 18, 1992. The series premiered three days later, on May 21, 1992.<ref name=TheAVClub/>\n\nAt the time of its initial airing, reviews of the show were mostly negative. [[Matt Roush]], writing in ''[[USA Today]]'', characterized the show as \"painfully bogus,\" and a cynical and exploitative new low in television, commenting, \"Watching The Real World, which fails as documentary (too phony) and as entertainment (too dull), it's hard to tell who's using who more.\" ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s [[Tom Shales]] commented, \"Ah to be young, cute, and stupid, and to have too much free time...Such is the lot facing the wayward wastrels of The Real World, something new in excruciating torture from the busy minds at MTV.\" Shales also remarked upon the cast members\u2019 creative career choices, saying, \"You might want to think about getting a real job.\"<ref name=TheAVClub/>\n\nNonetheless, the series was a hit with viewers. One early sign of the show's popularity occurred on the October 2, 1993 episode of the [[sketch comedy]] show, ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', which parodied the second-season [[The Real World: Los Angeles|Los Angeles]] cast's recurring arguments over [[clique|cliquism]], prejudice and political differences.<ref name=Doherty>[http://www.tv.com/saturday-night-live/shannen-dohertycypress-hill/episode/102456/summary.html \"Shannen Doherty/Cypress Hill\"].

Should a cast member decide to move out, or be asked to do so by all his or her roommates, the roommates will often get a replacement, dependent on how much filming time is left. Cast members are paid a small stipend for their participation in the show.<ref name=\"Aurthur\"/> The cast of the first season, for example, was given $2,500.

Unlike the normal day-to-day taping, these interviews, which are referred to as \"confessionals,\" involve the subject looking directly into the camera while providing opinions and reflective accounts of the week's activities, which are used in the final, edited episodes. The producers instruct the cast to talk about whatever they wish,<ref name=PedroAndMePg62&100/><ref>{{cite episode|title=To a New Beginning...|series=The Real World: Los Angeles|network=MTV|season=2|number=2|airdate=July 1, 1993|url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/228240/the-real-world-to-a-new-beginning}}</ref> and to speak in complete sentences, to reinforce the perception on the part of the home viewer that the cast is speaking to them. Winick described this practice as \"like therapy without the help.\"<ref name=PedroAndMePg62&100/> The confessionals were originally conducted by [[Mary-Ellis Bunim]] and [[Jonathan Murray]], but were eventually delegated to production staff members like George Verschoor and Thomas Klein. Beginning with the second season (Los Angeles), a small soundproof room was incorporated into each house for this purpose, which itself has also become known as the Confessional.

The only group activity engineered by the producers during the first season was a trip for the three females to [[Jamaica]]. By the second season, sending the entire cast on a vacation and/or short-term local trip would become the norm for most seasons. By the fifth season, the cast would be given an ongoing, season-long activity, with the Miami cast given startup money and a business advisor to begin their own business. This aspect of the show remained in most subsequent seasons.<ref>This element was not present in the [[The Real World: Brooklyn|Brooklyn]], [[The Real World: Washington D.C.|Washington D.C.]] and [[The Real World: New Orleans (2010)|2010 New Orleans]] seasons.</ref> The assignments are obligatory, with casts assigned to work at an after-school daycare program, a radio station, public-access television station, etc. Beginning with the [[The Real World: Back to New York|tenth season]], a rule was implemented that required a roommate fired from the group job to be evicted from the house and dropped from the cast.

After an incident occurs, producers or cast members are typically given the choice as to whether a violent housemate can stay due to a contract clause that prohibits violence.

Moore also took exception to coming into contact with the fecal matter of Tressler's pet dog Daisy. Unlike prior seasons where the one assaulted housemate was given the sole choice as to whether the attacker could stay, the Portland cast had its producers decide that only those not involved in the confrontation could decide whether Moore could stay via a majority vote. They chose to let her stay, and producers did not order Moore to anger management, despite subsequent threats to attack other cast members. As a result, Reilly and Tressler chose to leave the loft during that season's final episode, along with Tressler's dog Daisy.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Welcome to the Sh*t Show!|series=The Real World: Portland|network=MTV|season=28|number=11|airdate=June 5, 2013|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/real-world-portland-ep-11-welcome-to-the-sht-show/1708490/playlist.jhtml#series=2211&seriesId=39982&channelId=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title=Out With a Bang!|series=The Real World: Portland|network=MTV|season=28|number=12|airdate=June 12, 2013|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/real-world-portland-ep-12-out-with-a-bang/1708915/playlist.jhtml#series=2211&seriesId=39982&channelId=1}}</ref> In the final three episodes of the [[Real World: Go Big or Go Home|Go Big or Go Home]] season, castmates Jenna Thomason and Ceejai Jenkins got into two physical altercations while in the house.

She noted that situations from the original season seemed to repeat themselves in the other incarnations, stopping short of accusing them of acting. On an edition of the ''[[E!

Another accusation is that producers selectively edit material in order to give the false impression of certain emotional reactions or statements from the castmates.<ref name=realityreel>{{cite web|title=Interview With Coral Jeanne Smith from ''Battle of the Sexes'' and ''The Real World''|date=23 December 2004|url=http://www.realityreel.com/index.php?file=article&sid=976&pageid=2|accessdate=2007-06-21|work=Reality Reel|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928185155/http://www.realityreel.com/index.php?file=article&sid=976&pageid=2|archivedate=September 28, 2007}}</ref> ''New York'' cast member [[Rebecca Blasband]] says producers paid a man $100 to ask her out on a date, and that she terminated that plan when she learned of it.

Writing in 2011, Meredith Blake of ''[[The A.V.

Maxson portrays the title character, a sensitive and awkward young woman whose main hobby is paper craft, and reveals a surprising sexual encounter between her teenage self and a teacher. The resulting confession lands on the desk of a jaded MTV employee, who fast-forwards through the details of her depressing story.

Bunim and Murray initially considered developing a scripted series in a similar vein, but quickly decided that the cost of paying writers, actors, costume designers, and make-up artists was too high.<ref name=TheAVClub>Blake, Meredith (June 6, 2011).

[[Tracy Grandstaff]], one of the original seven picked for what has come to be known as \"[[The Real World: Pilot|Season 0]]\",{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} went on to minor fame as the voice of the animated ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'' character Daria Morgendorffer, who eventually got her own spinoff, ''[[Daria]]''. Dutch TV producer Erik Latour claims that the ideas for ''The Real World'' were directly derived from his television show ''[[Nummer 28]]'', which aired in 1991 on Dutch television.<ref name=Nummer28>Van den Boogaard, Raymond (September 28, 1996 ).

(Dutch).</ref> Bunim/Murray decided upon the cheaper idea of casting a bunch of \"regular people\" to live in an apartment and taping their day-to-day lives, believing seven diverse people would have enough of a basis upon which to interact without scripts. The production converted a massive, 4000-square-foot duplex in Soho, cast seven cast members from 500 applicants, and paid them $2,600 for their time on the show. The cast lived in the loft from February 16 to May 18, 1992. The series premiered three days later, on May 21, 1992.<ref name=TheAVClub/>\n\nAt the time of its initial airing, reviews of the show were mostly negative. [[Matt Roush]], writing in ''[[USA Today]]'', characterized the show as \"painfully bogus,\" and a cynical and exploitative new low in television, commenting, \"Watching The Real World, which fails as documentary (too phony) and as entertainment (too dull), it's hard to tell who's using who more.\" ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s [[Tom Shales]] commented, \"Ah to be young, cute, and stupid, and to have too much free time...Such is the lot facing the wayward wastrels of The Real World, something new in excruciating torture from the busy minds at MTV.\" Shales also remarked upon the cast members\u2019 creative career choices, saying, \"You might want to think about getting a real job.\"<ref name=TheAVClub/>\n\nNonetheless, the series was a hit with viewers. One early sign of the show's popularity occurred on the October 2, 1993 episode of the [[sketch comedy]] show, ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', which parodied the second-season [[The Real World: Los Angeles|Los Angeles]] cast's recurring arguments over [[clique|cliquism]], prejudice and political differences.<ref name=Doherty>[http://www.tv.com/saturday-night-live/shannen-dohertycypress-hill/episode/102456/summary.html \"Shannen Doherty/Cypress Hill\"].

Should a cast member decide to move out, or be asked to do so by all his or her roommates, the roommates will often get a replacement, dependent on how much filming time is left. Cast members are paid a small stipend for their participation in the show.<ref name=\"Aurthur\"/> The cast of the first season, for example, was given $2,500.

Unlike the normal day-to-day taping, these interviews, which are referred to as \"confessionals,\" involve the subject looking directly into the camera while providing opinions and reflective accounts of the week's activities, which are used in the final, edited episodes. The producers instruct the cast to talk about whatever they wish,<ref name=PedroAndMePg62&100/><ref>{{cite episode|title=To a New Beginning...|series=The Real World: Los Angeles|network=MTV|season=2|number=2|airdate=July 1, 1993|url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/228240/the-real-world-to-a-new-beginning}}</ref> and to speak in complete sentences, to reinforce the perception on the part of the home viewer that the cast is speaking to them. Winick described this practice as \"like therapy without the help.\"<ref name=PedroAndMePg62&100/> The confessionals were originally conducted by [[Mary-Ellis Bunim]] and [[Jonathan Murray]], but were eventually delegated to production staff members like George Verschoor and Thomas Klein. Beginning with the second season (Los Angeles), a small soundproof room was incorporated into each house for this purpose, which itself has also become known as the Confessional. (The soundproofing practice appears to have been discontinued in later seasons.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Looks Can Be D.C.-ving|series=The Real World: DC|season=23|episode=1|airdate=December 30, 2009|network=MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/real-world-washington-dc-ep-1-looks-can-be-dc-ving/1628228/playlist.jhtml}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realworlddailies.com/Video/Greg-overhears-confessional-calls-mom/092ECFFFF00A1312F0017001BDDD6|title=The Real World: Hollywood Dailies: Greg overhears confessional, calls mom|work=MTV|date=January 1, 2008}}</ref>)\n\nThe various casts were often creative in their use of the confessional, which Bunim and Murray referred to as \"inspired lunacy,\" such as a group confessional that the Los Angeles cast conducted on their last day in order to appear less contentious, but which ended with them arguing and storming out, an appearance by San Francisco housemate Judd Winick in a nun's habit, and [[The Real World: Miami|Miami]] roommates Melissa Padr\u00f3n and Flora Alekseyeun dressing up as prostitutes for a shared confessional in which they discuss why their roommates did not get along with them.<ref name=DiariesPage5/> During [[Mardi Gras]], [[The Real World: New Orleans|2000 New Orleans]] cast member Danny Roberts used the confessional to engage in a sex act.<ref name=NewOrleans2000ep12>{{cite episode|title=Mardi Gras Mayhem|series=The Real World: New Orleans|season=|number=12|network=MTV|airdate=August 22, 2000|url=}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the show documented the housemates as they struggled to find and maintain jobs and careers in their new locales, with minimal group activities aside from their day-to-day lives in the house and their socializing in the city. The only group activity engineered by the producers during the first season was a trip for the three females to [[Jamaica]]. By the second season, sending the entire cast on a vacation and/or short-term local trip would become the norm for most seasons. By the fifth season, the cast would be given an ongoing, season-long activity, with the Miami cast given startup money and a business advisor to begin their own business. This aspect of the show remained in most subsequent seasons.<ref>This element was not present in the [[The Real World: Brooklyn|Brooklyn]], [[The Real World: Washington D.C.|Washington D.C.]] and [[The Real World: New Orleans (2010)|2010 New Orleans]] seasons.</ref> The assignments are obligatory, with casts assigned to work at an after-school daycare program, a radio station, public-access television station, etc. Beginning with the [[The Real World: Back to New York|tenth season]], a rule was implemented that required a roommate fired from the group job to be evicted from the house and dropped from the cast.

After an incident occurs, producers or cast members are typically given the choice as to whether a violent housemate can stay due to a contract clause that prohibits violence. After an incident during the [[The Real World: Seattle|Seattle]] season in which Stephen Williams slapped [[Irene McGee]] as she moved out,<ref>{{cite episode|series=[[The Real World: Seattle]]|title=Irene Calls It Quits|season=7|number=15|network=MTV}}</ref> a response to the event was debated by the housemates, who were not present but were shown a videotape of the incident.

Moore also took exception to coming into contact with the fecal matter of Tressler's pet dog Daisy. Unlike prior seasons where the one assaulted housemate was given the sole choice as to whether the attacker could stay, the Portland cast had its producers decide that only those not involved in the confrontation could decide whether Moore could stay via a majority vote. They chose to let her stay, and producers did not order Moore to anger management, despite subsequent threats to attack other cast members. As a result, Reilly and Tressler chose to leave the loft during that season's final episode, along with Tressler's dog Daisy.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Welcome to the Sh*t Show!|series=The Real World: Portland|network=MTV|season=28|number=11|airdate=June 5, 2013|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/real-world-portland-ep-11-welcome-to-the-sht-show/1708490/playlist.jhtml#series=2211&seriesId=39982&channelId=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title=Out With a Bang!|series=The Real World: Portland|network=MTV|season=28|number=12|airdate=June 12, 2013|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/real-world-portland-ep-12-out-with-a-bang/1708915/playlist.jhtml#series=2211&seriesId=39982&channelId=1}}</ref> In the final three episodes of the [[Real World: Go Big or Go Home|Go Big or Go Home]] season, castmates Jenna Thomason and Ceejai Jenkins got into two physical altercations while in the house.

She noted that situations from the original season seemed to repeat themselves in the other incarnations, stopping short of accusing them of acting. On an edition of the ''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]'' that spotlighted the series, cast member Jon Brennan revealed that he was asked by the producers to state on the air that he felt hatred towards housemate Tami Roman for her decision to have an abortion, and that he refused to do so, stating that although he disagreed with her decision, he did not feel hatred towards her. Another accusation is that producers selectively edit material in order to give the false impression of certain emotional reactions or statements from the castmates.<ref name=realityreel>{{cite web|title=Interview With Coral Jeanne Smith from ''Battle of the Sexes'' and ''The Real World''|date=23 December 2004|url=http://www.realityreel.com/index.php?file=article&sid=976&pageid=2|accessdate=2007-06-21|work=Reality Reel|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928185155/http://www.realityreel.com/index.php?file=article&sid=976&pageid=2|archivedate=September 28, 2007}}</ref> ''New York'' cast member [[Rebecca Blasband]] says producers paid a man $100 to ask her out on a date, and that she terminated that plan when she learned of it.

Writing in 2011, Meredith Blake of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' found the first-season cast's career goals to be \"ambitious, articulate, and thoughtful\", particularly in the context of the time when the show was produced, when cast members may have sought to be on TV to further their career goals, but not to be reality TV personalities, which was not yet a common goal at the time, stating, \"What's so curious about the show\u2019s somewhat chilly critical reception is that, compared to today\u2019s reality fare\u2014''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'', the [[Kardashians]], the various ''[[Real Housewives]]\u2014The Real World: New York'' now seems incredibly, achingly earnest, bracingly raw, and sweetly idealistic.\" Blake contrasts this with the casts of later seasons, such as that of 2011, who tend to be defined more by their pasts than by their career goals, and who are never unaware of their own onscreen \"narrative\".<ref name=TheAVClub/> In addition, the later seasons earned the series a reputation for immature or irresponsible behavior on the part of the cast,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/archives/the_real_world_26/2011_Jun_07_san_diego|title=Real World returning to San Diego for its 26th season|last=Dehnart|first=Andy|authorlink=Andy Dehnart|publisher=RealityBlurred.com|date=June 7, 2011|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}</ref> which [[Nola.com]] has described as being \"sometimes fit for a police report.\"<ref name=Nola.com/> On the final track of his ''[[Become the Media]]'' spoken word album, activist [[Jello Biafra]] discusses a conversation he had with ''[[The Real World: Seattle]]'' cast member [[Irene McGee]], who was slapped by castmate Stephen Williams, saying:\n\n{{cquote|We know ''Real World'' is not the real world.

This fictional documentary series, as well as the title of the movie itself, closely parodies and satirizes ''The Real World'' format.\n* A fifth-season episode of ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' called \"Unreal World\" depicted David Silver using a character named Tuck as the subject of a class video project. When Tuck refuses to participate, the rest of the cast pretend to be Tuck and his roommates for the project. Another character named Beth is also used in the project.\n* In an episode of the animated comedy ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'', Pinky and the Brain join the cast of a show called ''Real Life'' hosted by TV personality Eisenhower for the network MTTV in order to broadcast the a cappella voice of [[Rush Limbaugh]] in order to take over the world.\n* A [[satire|satirical]] TV movie called ''The Lost Season'' parodied ''The Real World''. It depicted a season of the show that supposedly took place in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], and was abandoned because its participants were kidnapped.\n* The reality show ''The Surreal Life'' is structured similarly to ''The Real World'', except that the housemates, who live together for ten days, are celebrities. The show's original name was ''\"The Surreal World.\"''\n* \"Swept Away \u2013 A Very Special Episode\", a Season 11 episode of the [[crime drama]] ''[[Law & Order]]'' that premiered February 28, 2001, featured a plot involving the investigation into the murder of a housemate on a reality show akin to ''The Real World'' called ''Deal With It''. An episode of the crime drama ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' also featured a plot involving a murder committed during the filming such a show.\n* [[Dave Chappelle]] lampooned what he perceived as the targeting of minority cast members for criticism or ejection on the show on his [[Comedy Central]] sketch comedy show, ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'', with a sketch entitled \"The Mad Real World\", portraying, with hyperbole, the results of what would happen if one white person were to cohabitate with a collection of crazy black people.\n* The Comedy Central series ''[[Drawn Together]]'' is an animated reality show parody that borrows much of its format and conventions from ''The Real World'', but whose cast is populated by animated [[cartoon]] archetypes.\n* The music video for the [[Eminem]] track, \"[[Without Me (Eminem song)|Without Me]]\", contains scenes which parody ''The Real World'', with appearances by New Orleans castmate [[Julie Stoffer]], Boston castmate Syrus Yarbrough, and San Francisco castmate [[David \"Puck\" Rainey]].\n* The 1999 romantic comedy ''[[She's All That]]'' features [[Matthew Lillard]] playing Brock Hudson, an ex-''Real World'' cast member kicked out of the house for being obnoxious to his fellow castmates.\n* In \"[[Text, Lies & Videotape]]\", a fifth-season episode of the television series ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', Audrey ([[Busy Philipps]]) is speaking with Joey ([[Katie Holmes]]) about recording her audition tape for the fictional ''The Real World: Ibiza'' season. In a sixth-season episode, \"[[The Kids Are Alright (Dawson's Creek episode)|The Importance of Not Being Too Earnest]]\", some college students speculate whether Joey sent an e-mail to the whole campus (by accident) in an attempt to get attention or because she was on ''The Real World''.\n* In \"[[The Route of All Evil]]\", a third-season episode of the animated television series ''[[Futurama]]'', the characters watch an episode of ''The Real World: The Sun''.

He was the second youngest in the number of 5 brothers and 3 sisters. At birth, he was normal and healthy, but at the age of 5, he got paralyzed in the left hand and right leg. After completing his primary level education, he used to travel a long distance of 18 Kilometers from his village Samona to the small town [[Rajakhera]], every day, on foot, while doing secondary and higher secondary level schooling. He received two scholarships due to his talent, (1) RRMI Merit Scholarship (Reader's Research Modern Institute) Foundation, India and (2) PWD Scholarship from Rajasthan Government.
