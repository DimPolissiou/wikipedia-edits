The players were selected for a Scottish Trial side and then joined the London Scottish side as they thought it would further enhance their credentials for Scotland selection. Dixon stated that the players did this of their free will and that they stood the same chance of selection for Scotland at London Scottish as they did at any side. He stated that Aitken's parents were Scottish and his father still resided in Blairgowrie; and in the case of Wallace all four of his grandparents were Scottish.

Dixon is recorded going to his grandfather's funeral in 1893.

The players were selected for a Scottish Trial side and then joined the London Scottish side as they thought it would further enhance their credentials for Scotland selection. Dixon stated that the players did this of their free will and that they stood the same chance of selection for Scotland at London Scottish as they did at any side. He stated that Aitken's parents were Scottish and his father still resided in Blairgowrie; and in the case of Wallace all four of his grandparents were Scottish. Rumours had abounded that the [[Scottish Rugby Union]] had coerced the move - Dixon described this sharply as 'a tissue of lies'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/account/register?countrykey=0&showgiftvoucherclaimingoptions=false&gift=false&nextpage=%2faccount%2flogin%3freturnurl%3d%252fviewer%252fbl%252f0000566%252f19230121%252f173%252f0014&rememberme=false&cookietracking=false&partnershipkey=0&newsletter=false&offers=false&registerreason=none&showsubscriptionoptions=false&showcouponmessaging=false&showfreetrialmessaging=false&showregisteroptions=false&showloginoptions=false&isonlyupgradeable=false|title=Register &#124; British Newspaper Archive|website=www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk}}</ref> Not at issue: Aitken and Wallace had already represented New Zealand and Australia, respectively.

Dixon is recorded going to his grandfather's funeral in 1893. Adam was in the shipping industry and his funeral was well attended by representatives from shipping companies and the shore porter's society.

The indoor facility offered the ability to control climate conditions to produce the highest quality ice.\n\nConstruction of The Oval began in 1985, nearly four years after Calgary had been designated host of the [[1988 Winter Olympics|XV Olympic Winter Games]]. Like the [[Olympic Saddledome]], most of the Oval's structure was built using precast, prestressed concrete. Twenty eight beams were laid along the outside of the perimeter of the building to support 84 additional beams used to construct a lattice frame for the arched roof. The interior scaffolding used to hoist these 84 beams had to be lowered a centimetre at a time in a predetermined sequence in order to distribute the load of the roof equally to each of the 28 exterior support beams. Construction was completed by the end of the summer of 1987, officially opening in September 1987, five months before the Olympics.\n[[File:Olympic Torch 2 at the Olympic Oval.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|The torch outside the Olympic Oval in 2017.]]\nIt was during the [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics|speed skating events]] of the Olympic Winter Games in 1988 that The Oval became known as ''\"The Fastest Ice in the World\u2122,\"'' as world records were set in seven events ([[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's 500 metres|Men's 500 m]], [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's 1500 metres|1500 m]], [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's 10,000 metres|10,000 m]], and [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's 500 metres|Women's 500 m]], [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's 1000 metres|1000 m]], [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's 3000 metres|3000 m]], [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's 5000 metres|5000 m]]), and Olympic records were set in the other three events ([[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's 1500 metres|Men's 1500 m]], [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's 5000 metres|5000 m]], and [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's 1500 metres|Women's 1500 m]]). The combination of the climate-controlled facility and the effects of high altitude have been credited for the fast ice surface. <ref name=\"CalgaryHerald_20130209_Legacy\">{{cite news |title=Building on the Olympic Legacy |newspaper=Calgary Herald  |date=February 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, the Oval hosted Speed Skating for the [[1991 Winter Deaflympics]] held in [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]].\n\nThroughout the last 32 years, over 300 world records have been set at the Oval.

The indoor facility offered the ability to control climate conditions to produce the highest quality ice.\n\nConstruction of The Oval began in 1985, nearly four years after Calgary had been designated host of the [[1988 Winter Olympics|XV Olympic Winter Games]]. Like the [[Olympic Saddledome]], most of the Oval's structure was built using precast, prestressed concrete. Twenty eight beams were laid along the outside of the perimeter of the building to support 84 additional beams used to construct a lattice frame for the arched roof. The interior scaffolding used to hoist these 84 beams had to be lowered a centimetre at a time in a predetermined sequence in order to distribute the load of the roof equally to each of the 28 exterior support beams. Construction was completed by the end of the summer of 1987, officially opening in September 1987, five months before the Olympics.\n[[File:Olympic Torch 2 at the Olympic Oval.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|The torch outside the Olympic Oval in 2017.]]\nIt was during the [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics|speed skating events]] of the Olympic Winter Games in 1988 that The Oval became known as ''\"The Fastest Ice in the World\u2122,\"'' as world records were set in seven events ([[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's 500 metres|Men's 500 m]], [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's 1500 metres|1500 m]], [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's 10,000 metres|10,000 m]], and [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's 500 metres|Women's 500 m]], [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's 1000 metres|1000 m]], [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's 3000 metres|3000 m]], [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's 5000 metres|5000 m]]), and Olympic records were set in the other three events ([[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's 1500 metres|Men's 1500 m]], [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's 5000 metres|5000 m]], and [[Speed skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's 1500 metres|Women's 1500 m]]). The combination of the climate-controlled facility and the effects of high altitude have been credited for the fast ice surface. <ref name=\"CalgaryHerald_20130209_Legacy\">{{cite news |title=Building on the Olympic Legacy |newspaper=Calgary Herald  |date=February 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, the Oval hosted Speed Skating for the [[1991 Winter Deaflympics]] held in [[Banff]].\n\nThroughout the last 32 years, over 300 world records have been set at the Oval.
