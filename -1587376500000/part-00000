[[City Rovers]] comfortably won the senior championship for the 4th time with a 8 win, 1 draw, 0 loss record ahead of Maritime who were unable to repeat their title win from the previous season. [[City Rovers|City]] had previously won the title in 1910, 1911, and 1916. This was to be the first of 3 consecutive titles for them. They also won the Roope Rooster knockout competition for the 3rd time after previous wins in 1916 and 1918.\n\n=== Club Name Changes and Mergers ===\nOn 13 April the Management Committee of the Auckland Rugby League met. At the meeting Grafton was granted permission to change its name to \u201cFire Brigade Club\u201d. [[North Shore Albions|Devonport United]] notified the league that the Devonport Borough Council had allocated the [[Devonport Domain]] for its use. During the season the club was named \u2018North Shore\u2019 and \u2018Devonport\u2019 interchangeably by both ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' and the ''[[Auckland Star]]''. In 1920 the club had seen a merger between [[North Shore Albions]] and the Sunnyside club and agreed on the name [[North Shore Albions|Devonport United]] but it appears that the stronger club\u2019s name was still more favoured by those reporting on the games, and it was eventually the name adopted by the club.

A trophy \"similar to the Monteith Shield\" had been donated, and \"members of the Auckland League Management Committee had donated a football, and were providing assistance in supplying jerseys. At the meeting when the time for enrollment came it was described that \"they rose in a body and fairly rushed the table, which was in danger of being overturned in the excitement of the moment\" Ivan Culpan, secretary of the league told the girls that the league would train them every evening in the lead up to the match.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Girl Footballers/League Club Formed/First Match on Saturday/Much Enthusiasm Shown\n| page =9\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVIII| issue=17832\n| date = 1921-07-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210713.2.104\n| accessdate = 2020-02-29}}</ref> Over the next week the number of girls enrolled increased to 65.

This competition was won by the 18th Company of Senior Cadets after they won the final game of the season defeating the 13th Company by 7 points to 2.\n\n=== Challenge Shield ===\nThe Thacker Shield was held by [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] coming into the 1921 season however there was a dispute over whether the shield should be held by North Island teams as it was unclear if it had been intended for competition amoung South Island teams only. The New Zealand council decided that the rules should be amended to allow North Island teams to hold it but the donor, Dr. H. T.J. Thacker and the Canterbury Rugby League would not agree to them. As such the shield was returned to the donor. Mr. C Weaver donated a trophy to take its place and this became known as the Challenge Shield and it was this that Ponsonby went on to defend twice. They first hosted [[Petone Panthers|Petone]] from [[Wellington]] who they beat 18\u201313. In the curtain-raiser [[Petone Panthers|Petone juniors]] were defeated by [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] by 14 points to 8. In the evening the Petone players were entertained at the Druids\u2019 Hall by the [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] club and [[Auckland Rugby League|Auckland League]]. They later defeated Huntly 19\u20138 before losing the Shield to local rivals [[City Rovers]]\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 10 September\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 18\u201313\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Thacker Shield Match/Ponsonby Retains Trophy/Petone Defeated By 5 Points\n| page =7\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVIII| issue=17884\n| date = 1921-09-12\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210912.2.118.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-26}}</ref>| away = Petone\n| try1 = E McGregor 2, Southernwood, [[Dougie McGregor]]\n| con1 = [[Dougie McGregor]] 3\n| pen1 =\n| try2 = [[Horace Nunn]], Shanahan 2\n| con2 = Balks\n| pen2 = Nicholls\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 7000\n| referee = W Murray\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 8 October\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 19\u20138\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Thacker Shield Match/Ponsonby V Huntly/Win For the Local Team\n| page =3\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVIII| issue=17908\n| date = 1921-10-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19211010.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-25}}</ref>\n| away = Huntly\n| try1 = [[Thomas McClymont]], Blackie, W Edwards, W McNeil, J Hing\n| con1 = [[Thomas McClymont]] 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 = B Paki, Peckham\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = J Raynor\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 2000\n| referee = A Ferguson\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 15 October\n| time = 3:00\n| home = City\n| score = 25\u201310\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Final Game of Season/Thacker Shield Match/City Defeat Ponsonby\n| page =7\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVIII| issue=17914\n| date = 1921-10-17\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19211017.2.129.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-25}}</ref>\n| away = Ponsonby\n| try1 = [[George Paki]], [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]], Peckham, [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben Davidson]], H Hawkes\n| con1 = [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] 4\n| pen1 = [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]]\n| try2 = G Mormon, [[Dougie McGregor]]\n| con2 = [[Dougie McGregor]], [[Frank Delgrosso]]\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 7500\n| referee = Len Farrant\n}}\n\n=== Exhibition Matches ===\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | List of Exhibition Matches\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" | Venue\n! scope=\"col\" | Attendance\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Exhibition Match\n| 18 June <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Hamilton Beats Maritime\n| page =7\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LII| issue=145\n| date = 1921-06-20\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19210620.2.90\n| accessdate = 2019-08-25}}</ref>\n|| Hamilton|| 19 || Maritime || 16 || Hamilton\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Exhibition Match\n| 13 Aug <ref>{{cite news\n| title =City Rovers V Cambridge\n| page =7\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVIII| issue=17860\n| date = 1921-08-15\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210815.2.98.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-25}}</ref>\n|| Cambridge|| 16 || City Rovers || 14 || Victoria Square, Cambridge\n|-\n|}\n\n==Auckland Representative Fixtures==\nIt was a very busy season for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] representative team with ten matches played.

[[City Rovers]] comfortably won the senior championship for the 4th time with a 8 win, 1 draw, 0 loss record ahead of Maritime who were unable to repeat their title win from the previous season. [[City Rovers|City]] had previously won the title in 1910, 1911, and 1916. This was to be the first of 3 consecutive titles for them. They also won the Roope Rooster knockout competition for the 3rd time after previous wins in 1916 and 1918.\n\n== Club Name Changes and Mergers ==\nOn 13 April the Management Committee of the Auckland Rugby League met. At the meeting Grafton was granted permission to change its name to \u201cFire Brigade Club\u201d. [[North Shore Albions|Devonport United]] notified the league that the Devonport Borough Council had allocated the [[Devonport Domain]] for its use. During the season the club was named \u2018North Shore\u2019 and \u2018Devonport\u2019 interchangeably by both ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' and the ''[[Auckland Star]]''. In 1920 the club had seen a merger between [[North Shore Albions]] and the Sunnyside club and agreed on the name [[North Shore Albions|Devonport United]] but it appears that the stronger club\u2019s name was still more favoured by those reporting on the games, and it was eventually the name adopted by the club. While the Kingsland Rovers club wrote asking for advice on what it should do regarding a ground for the club to play at.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The Management Committee\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVIII| issue=17755\n| date = 1921-03-14 |page=7\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210414.2.103.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-22}}</ref>\n\n== Carlaw Park Open for Business ==\nHistory was made on 25 June when the first ever match was played on [[Carlaw Park]] between [[City Rovers]] and Maritime.

They were to play a game on Carlaw Park on the following Saturday afternoon. They were all aged between 16 and 20 years of age. The chairman of the Parnell club, Mr. A. R. Turner explained \"that it wished to develop the girls as well as the men, and to this end the club was being formed at the suggestion of the girls\". A trophy \"similar to the Monteith Shield\" had been donated, and \"members of the Auckland League Management Committee had donated a football, and were providing assistance in supplying jerseys. At the meeting when the time for enrollment came it was described that \"they rose in a body and fairly rushed the table, which was in danger of being overturned in the excitement of the moment\" Ivan Culpan, secretary of the league told the girls that the league would train them every evening in the lead up to the match.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Girl Footballers/League Club Formed/First Match on Saturday/Much Enthusiasm Shown\n| page =9\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVIII| issue=17832\n| date = 1921-07-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210713.2.104\n| accessdate = 2020-02-29}}</ref> Over the next week the number of girls enrolled increased to 65.

At the Auckland Rugby league Management meeting the following night the decision on whether to support the girls playing and affiliate the club with the league was deferred. Both G.

The New Zealand council decided that the rules should be amended to allow North Island teams to hold it but the donor, Dr. H. T.J. Thacker and the Canterbury Rugby League would not agree to them. As such the shield was returned to the donor. Mr. C Weaver donated a trophy to take its place and this became known as the Challenge Shield and it was this that Ponsonby went on to defend twice. They first hosted [[Petone Panthers|Petone]] from [[Wellington]] who they beat 18\u201313. In the curtain-raiser [[Petone Panthers|Petone juniors]] were defeated by [[Richmond Bulldogs|Richmond]] by 14 points to 8. In the evening the Petone players were entertained at the Druids\u2019 Hall by the [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] club and [[Auckland Rugby League|Auckland League]]. They later defeated Huntly 19\u20138 before losing the Shield to local rivals [[City Rovers]]\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 10 September\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 18\u201313\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Thacker Shield Match/Ponsonby Retains Trophy/Petone Defeated By 5 Points\n| page =7\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVIII| issue=17884\n| date = 1921-09-12\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210912.2.118.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-26}}</ref>| away = Petone\n| try1 = E McGregor 2, Southernwood, [[Dougie McGregor]]\n| con1 = [[Dougie McGregor]] 3\n| pen1 =\n| try2 = [[Horace Nunn]], Shanahan 2\n| con2 = Balks\n| pen2 = Nicholls\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 7000\n| referee = W Murray\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 8 October\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 19\u20138\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Thacker Shield Match/Ponsonby V Huntly/Win For the Local Team\n| page =3\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVIII| issue=17908\n| date = 1921-10-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19211010.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-25}}</ref>\n| away = Huntly\n| try1 = [[Thomas McClymont]], Blackie, W Edwards, W McNeil, J Hing\n| con1 = [[Thomas McClymont]] 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 = B Paki, Peckham\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = J Raynor\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 2000\n| referee = A Ferguson\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 15 October\n| time = 3:00\n| home = City\n| score = 25\u201310\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Final Game of Season/Thacker Shield Match/City Defeat Ponsonby\n| page =7\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVIII| issue=17914\n| date = 1921-10-17\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19211017.2.129.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-25}}</ref>\n| away = Ponsonby\n| try1 = [[George Paki]], [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]], Peckham, [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben Davidson]], H Hawkes\n| con1 = [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] 4\n| pen1 = [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]]\n| try2 = G Mormon, [[Dougie McGregor]]\n| con2 = [[Dougie McGregor]], [[Frank Delgrosso]]\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 7500\n| referee = Len Farrant\n}}\n\n=== Exhibition Matches ===\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | List of Exhibition Matches\n|-\n|\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | Score\n! scope=\"col\" | Venue\n! scope=\"col\" | Attendance\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Exhibition Match\n| 18 June <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Hamilton Beats Maritime\n| page =7\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LII| issue=145\n| date = 1921-06-20\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19210620.2.90\n| accessdate = 2019-08-25}}</ref>\n|| Hamilton|| 19 || Maritime || 16 || Hamilton\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Exhibition Match\n| 13 Aug <ref>{{cite news\n| title =City Rovers V Cambridge\n| page =7\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVIII| issue=17860\n| date = 1921-08-15\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210815.2.98.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-25}}</ref>\n|| Cambridge|| 16 || City Rovers || 14 || Victoria Square, Cambridge\n|-\n|}\n\n==Auckland Representative Fixtures==\nIt was a very busy season for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] representative team with ten matches played.

The band uses vintage analog synthesizers, drum machines, hacked videogame systems and homemade synthesizers to make loud, fast, punk music. The band's style has been sometimes called [[Nintendocore]].

Every episode ends with the family being ripped off, or either of the men getting a beating from his wife for flirting with other women. The storyline starts off with Nabeel and Mehmood living in an apartment as bachelors and progresses to both of them marrying and having children.\n\nThe show is known to break the [[fourth wall]] all the time.\n\n====Episode 1-25 (Pre-marriage)====\nNabeel's childhood friend Ahmad moves abroad and tells Nabeel to look after his apartment. Nabeel takes advantage of this and starts living in the apartment as landlord and rents out a room to Mehmood. Khoobsoorat, who ran away from her wedding just fifteen minutes before it took place, arrives at the same apartment looking for her friend Saima, who is married to Ahmed. Although Nabeel first tells her she cannot move in, he changes his mind after she threatens to tell Saima about the misuse of the apartment.\n\nWhen Khoobsoorat's [[father]], Siddiqui, comes to take her back, she tells him that she is married to Nabeel to stop him. When Nabeel's mother, Mumtaz, comes to visit him, he says that Khoobsoorat is the housemaid, as his mother would not accept his living together with a woman.\n\nLater in the series, Khubsoorat's [[father]] finds out his daughter is unmarried and informs her that he is coming to take her back home. Nabeel's mother comes to visit her son and tells him that Khoobsoorat is a good girl and that they should get married. When she asks Khubsoorat, Khubsoorat is shocked and decides to leave. Later, Nabeel tells Khoobsoorat that he really loves her and had fallen in love with her when he saw her for the fourth time (''chothi nazar main''); and, so, he wants to marry her. Mehmood and Mumtaz started to like each other and want to get married. At Nabeel and Khubsoorat's marriage, after their ''[[nikah]]'' is read, Mehmood announces he will marry Mumtaz and tells the ''[[qadi]]'' to wait and read their nikah as well. Nabeel is shocked by this and feels very uncomfortable about his mother being close to Mehmood. At this moment, Siddiqui arrives to cancel his daughter's wedding. Nabeel tells him that the nikah is already read, and he gets really angry, later he is convinced to eat biryani which later calms down his mood.\n\n====Episode 26-82 (After marriage)====\n(Nabeel's mother becomes a regular cast member after episode 25.)\n\nSoon after the couples get married, Nabeel gets a call from Ahmad, who tells him he has found someone who will move into the apartment, and that they have two days to move out. Luckily, Khubsoorat's father arranges for a new place for them to live and pays in advance, so that they do not struggle. \n\nSiddiqui also finds a good job offer for Nabeel. Nabeel is forced to attend the job interview by his wife Khoobsurat. Nabeel later gets declined due to his demanding of a salary of 3-4 lakhs, saying he is made for much bigger things and will not work for anyone who does not see his true potential.\n\n====Episode 83-87 (Bubulay in Dubai)====\nThe Bulbulay family goes to [[Dubai]] but without telling each other. Nabeel and Khoobsurat win a trip to Dubai from a lucky draw. Mehmood and Mumtaz go to Dubai for their honeymoon, with their own money. They happen to be booked into the same hotel. While walking in the hall, Nabeel and Mehmood bump into each other; they pretend that they don't know each other and rush back to their rooms. When both families have plans to go to the Oasis Mall, and both Mehmood and Nabeel are taking showers in their rooms, Khoobsurat and Momo wait for them in the hotel lobby and see each other clearly. \n\nMomo goes out of the hotel to avoid Khoobsurat and rushes off in a taxi to the mall.  Khoobsurat, Nabeel, and Mehmood go out to find her. After they're reunited, they go to Ibn Battuta Mall the next day, where they meet FM radio producers and are offered jobs that don't work out. Nabeel later meets a woman and starts firting with her, and convincing her that he is rich, having many businesses. Mehmood sab finds out, and tries to stop Nabeel but backfires. Afterwards, the family headed towards the mall, Nabeel makes up excuses to go back to the hotel, so Mehmood sab drugs Nabeel's coffee cup to ruin his date. Nabeel then returns back to the hotel and invites the woman to stay in his hotel room, he kept going to the washroom repeatedly due to the effect of the drug. Khoobsurat returns back from the mall and discoveres the truth, which later on makes her angry at Nabeel.\n\nThe next day, Momo meets a man in the hotel lounge and mistakenly picks up his bag thinking it's hers. The man was ordered by his boss to follow Momo to get the bag back. Meanwhile the boss, who the bag had belonged to, finds out that Momo is the leader of the Bulbulay gang so he captures Nabeel, Mehmood and Khoobsurat then blackmails Momo to return the bag in exchange for her gang. The boss then orders the man to capture the bag from her possesion, Momo realising that the bag has cash inside; instead gives a small portion of the money to the man. The boss frees the family thinking the man had received the money. Momo still having possesion of the bag tells the family and they immediately rush towards the airport.\n\n====Episode 88-100 (pre-parenthood)====\nWhile returning home from Dubai, Momo loses her bag at the airport. Khoobsurat becomes ill and the others start avoiding her in the fear of catching her disease. Later, Khoobsurat is found to be pregnant, shortly after which Momo also becomes pregnant.

Both Arabs and Kurds thought of the Assyrians as foreigners and as allies of colonial Britain.

In 1895 in Diyarbak\u0131r Kurdish and Turkish militia began attacking Christians, plundering Assyrian villages. In 1915 Kurds and Turks plundered villages, about 7000 Assyrians were killed. In [[1915]] Turkish troops \"with Kurdish detachments\" committed mass slaughters of Assyrians in Iran. In the Assyrian village of Haftvan almost 1000 people were beheaded and  5000 Assyrian women were taken to Kurdish harems.<ref>The Armenian Genocide: Cultural and Ethical Legacies  Richard G. Hovannisian  (2011).</ref>\n\nIn 1894, Paul Cambon described the creation of Kurdish Hamidies regiments as \"the official organisation for pillage at the expense of Armenian Christians\". In these places \"the system of persecutions and extorsions became intolerable to populations who had become accustomed to their slavery\". According to Cambon, the Porte refused reforms and persisted in \"maintaining a veritable regime of terror, arrests, assasinations and rape.\".<ref>Islam and Dhimmitude: Where Civilizations Collide by Bat Ye\u02bcor. 116-18</ref> In 1925 the Muslim Kurds \"rose in revolt against the \"atheist government of Ankara\" and demanded autonomy, the restoration of religious laws and of the sultanate\".<ref>Islam and Dhimmitude: Where Civilizations Collide by Bat Ye\u02bcor. 40</ref> In 1932 Iraqi forces commanded by Kurdish general Bakr Sidki killed 600 Assyrians at Simel, near Mosul.

Kurdish writers have recounted that \"the Kurdish troops attacked the Assyrians and started slaughters. Consequently, a few Assyrians were killed, their villages were destroyed and set into fire... For the second time, in 1846, the Assyrians residing at the Thuma region have been massacred....\" British writer William Eagleton said that \"in 1843 and 1846, Bedirhan started a massacre and booting campaign against the Christian Assyrians (Nestorians) he was anxious about whose getting stronger and independent through becoming able to rule themselves. It was intolerable for Bedirhan to see the Assyrians living on his own territories getting stronger. Thus he killed ten thousand Assyrians. Even though Bedirhan was a feudal tribal leader, he was expressing the aspirations of Kurdish nationalism.\" Kurdish and Arab attacks on Assyrians continued, culminating in the August 1933 Simele Massacres. About 3000 Assyrians were killed in that single month alone.<ref>http://www.atour.com/education/20000825a.html</ref>\n\nBeginning in August 1933 Iraqi soldiers and Kurdish militia killed thousands of Assyrias in Simele (Iraq). The massacre had a big influence on Raphael Lemkin, the jurist who coined the word \"genocide.<ref>https://www.ncas.rutgers.edu/center-study-genocide-conflict-resolution-and-human-rights/assyrian-genocide-1914-1923-and-1933-pres</ref> The Simmele Massacre is also commemorated yearly with the official Assyrian Martyrs Day on 7 August. The massacre was carried out by the Iraqi Army, led by Kurdish General Bakir Sidqi, and Kurdish and Arab irregulars. There were about 3,000 victims of the massacre.<ref>http://www.aina.org/releases/20040805022140.htm</ref>  Turks, with the cooperation of Kurdish groups, conducted systematic murder against the Christian population. Beginning in the first half of the 19th century, the Turks allied with Kurdish tribes. After the Kurds weregranted  an emirate in Syriac Cizre in 1842, the Kurds launched brutal assaults against Christians under the command of Kurdish emir Bedr Khan, who murdered thousands of Assyrians in the region of Tur Abdin and Hakkari. Christian areas were subjected to the migration of Kurdish tribes. Many massacres were carried out against Christians in 1895 in Diyarbakir, Urfa, Mardin, Nusaybin, Meyafarkin, Tur Abdin and Viranshahr. [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] were eradicated from Tur Abdin, Mardin, Diyarbakir and Hakkari in [[Turkey]] and Urmia in Iran. The Syriac city of Mardin was captured by Turks and given over to Kurds who expelled its original population.<ref name=\"araborthodoxy.blogspot.com\">http://araborthodoxy.blogspot.com/2013/12/as-safir-on-history-of-persecution-of.html</ref> Only a few of the Christians of the Nineveh Plain remain after the repeated attacks by Arab and Kurdish fighters.  Historically Christian cities like Erbil, Zakho, Dohuk, Kirkuk, and Mosul have been Kurdicized and Islamized.  Suryanis emigrated from [[Syria]] after the Amuda massacre of August [[1937]]. The massacre was carried out by Kurdish general Saeed Agha and emptied the city of its Suryani population. Malikiya, Darbasiya and Amuda have since become completely Kurdish. Also the historically Christian city of Nusaybin has become Kurdish. [[Christians]] fled to Qamishly which became a Christian city until the immigration of Kurds beginning in 1926.<ref name=\"araborthodoxy.blogspot.com\"/>\n\nKurdish-Christian Armenian relations were bitter at the turn of the 19th century and land conflicts were a major problem. Many Christians and Europeans regarded the Kurds as barbarians and a major threat, the French consul at Erzurum describing them as a blood-thirsty savage population which is used to plundering and a nomadic life. Kurds also played a major part in the Ottoman army, also through the Hamidiye.<ref>The Margins of Empire: Kurdish Militias in the Ottoman Tribal Zone, Janet Klein Stanford University Press, 2011</ref> The Kurdish chieftain Bedr Khan during his rise to power massacred about 10,000 Assyrians in 1842. Nestorian tribes were massacred by Kurds in 1843.

This led to an exodus of Assyrians from the mountains of [[Hakkari]] and the plains of [[Urmia]] to a British-led refugee camp in [[Baqubah]].\n\n==British Mandate==\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Independent Kingdom of Iraq==\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Simele Massacre===\n{{Main|Simele Massacre}}\n\nDuring July 1933, about 800 armed Assyrians headed for the Syrian border, where they were turned back by the French. While [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]] had briefly left the country for medical reasons, the Minister of Interior, [[Hikmat Sulayman]], adopted a policy aimed at a ''final solution'' of the \"Assyrian problem\". This policy was implemented by an Iraqi-Kurd, General [[Bakr Sidqi]]. After engaging in several unsuccessful clashes with armed Assyrian tribesmen, on 11 August 1933, Sidqi permitted his men to attack and kill about 3,000 unarmed Assyrian civilian villagers, including women, children and the elderly, at the Assyrian villages of [[Sumail]] (Simele) district, and later at [[Suryia]]. Having scapegoated the Assyrians as dangerous national traitors, this massacre of unarmed civilians became a symbol of national pride, and enhanced Sidqi's prestige. The British, though represented by a powerful military presence as provided by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, failed to intervene or allow the well-disciplined [[Assyrian Levies]] under their command to do so, and indeed helped whitewash the event at the [[League of Nations]].\n\nThe Assyrian repression marked the entrance of the military into Iraqi politics, a pattern that has periodically re-emerged since 1958, and offered an excuse for enlarging conscription.\n\n==Republic of Iraq==\n===Recognition of the Syriac language by the Ba'thist regime===\nIn the early 1970s, the secularist [[Ba'athist Iraq|Ba'ath]] regime initially tried to change the suppression of Assyrians in Iraq through different laws that were passed. On 20 February 1972, the government passed the law to recognize the cultural rights of Assyrians by allowing [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] be taught schools in which the majority of pupils spoke that language in addition to [[Arabic]]. Aramaic was also to be taught at intermediate and secondary schools in which the majority of students spoke that language in addition to Arabic, but it never happened. Special Assyrian programs were to be broadcast on public radio and television and three Syriac-language magazines were planned to be published in the capital.

Father [[Daoud Suleiman]] from the Assyrian town of [[Bartella]] testified that without the Christian militias, Bartella and other villages would be in much worse shape than they are now. A mysterious, media-shy, and wealthy Assyrian [[Sarkis Aghajan Mamendo]] was a key player in this apparently straightforward story of a small beleaguered minority learning to stand up for itself once more. He is the finance minister for the Kurdish regional government, and he is a member of the Kurdish Democratic Party believed to be close to Kurdish Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani. New churches are going up across the north, paid for, everyone says, by Sarkis. New schools, more than 300 new apartments for displaced Christian families from the south, an Assyrian cultural center in Bartella\u2014the list goes on.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95343489/ NPR Reports on Iraqi Christians forming Security Forces]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Population==\nThe majority of the ancestral villages of the Assyrian population in Iraq lie in the [[Kurdistan Region]] of [[Iraq]], where the bulk of the current Assyrian population is. In modern times, Assyrians, for whom no reliable census figures exist in Iraq (as they do not for [[Kurds]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], [[Armenian people|Armenians]], [[Yazidi]], [[Shabak people|Shabaks]] or [[Mandean]]s), have been doubly mistreated; first by their Kurdish neighbours who outnumber them greatly, then by [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Baath Party|Ba'athist]] regime. Assyrians were deprived of their ethnic, cultural and national rights while at the same time the Ba'athist regime tried to co-opt their history. In northern Iraq today, a similar pattern was claimed to have emerging as Kurdistan Regional Government attempt to allegedly rewrite the history of the region to give it a Kurdish flavor and diminish its historic and far older Assyrian heritage.<ref>{{cite book |title=Assyrians, Kurds, and Ottomans : intercommunal relations on the periphery of the Ottoman Empire |publisher=Cambria Press |isbn=978-1-60497-583-3}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\nA 1950 [[CIA]] numbers report on Iraq estimated 98,000 Chaldeans, 30,000 Nestorians, 25,000 Syriac Catholics and 12,000 Jacobites.<ref name=CIA-1950>{{cite web|title=National Intelligence Survey: Iraq: Section 43|publisher=CIA|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0001252339.pdf|pp=}}</ref> The report used the name Assyrians, in the ethnic sense, for Nestorians, and also noted that Assyrians may be members of the Chaldean and Protestant Churches.<ref name=CIA-1950/>\n\nAccording to statistics gathered by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] when doing censuses of Chaldean Catholic diocese in Iraq in 2012 and 2013, [[Chaldean Christians|Chaldo-Assyrians]] in Iraq numbered 230,071 people.<ref name=\"catholic-hierarchy.org\">http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/rite/dch2.html</ref>\n\nA population project run by ''Shlama Foundation'' has determined the Assyrian population of Iraq to be at a total of 151,047 (as of March 2020).<ref>{{cite web |title=Population Project |url=https://www.shlama.org/population |website=Shlama Foundation |accessdate=18 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Assyrian elections in Iraq]]\n* [[Assyrian genocide]]\n* [[Assyrian independence movement]]\n* [[Christianity in Iraq]]\n* [[Proposals for Assyrian autonomy in Iraq]]\n* [[List of Assyrian settlements]]\n* [[Minorities in Iraq]]\n* [[Simele massacre]]\n* [[Persecution of Assyrians by the Islamic State]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090201052834/http://assyriacouncil.eu/3.html Assyrian Council of Europe Press Releases]\n\n{{Demographics of Iraq}}\n{{Assyrian communities}}\n{{Asia in topic|Assyrians in}}\n\n[[Category:Assyrian ethnic groups]]\n[[Category:Assyrians in Iraq]]\n[[Category:Demographics of Iraq]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Iraq]]\n[[Category:Iraqi society]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Ethnic group}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{POV|date=June 2017}}\n{{lead rewrite|date=June 2014}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox ethnic group\n| group          = Assyrians in Iraq\n| image          = [[File:Aketo Festival (Assyrian New Year) in April 2018 in Nohaadra (Duhok) 14.jpg|250px]]\n| image_caption  = Assyrians celebrating the annual [[Assyrian New Year]] ([[Akitu]]) in [[Duhok]]\n| pop            = 151,047 (2020 estimate)<ref>{{cite web |title=The Shlama Population Project |url=https://www.shlama.org/population |publisher=Shlama |accessdate=13 June 2019}}</ref>\n400,000 (pre [[Northern Iraq offensive (June 2014)|2014 Isis invasion]]) <ref> https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/24/iraq-minorities-assyrians </ref> \n800,000 - 1,5 million (pre [[Assyrian exodus from Iraq|Assyrian exodus]]) <ref> https://www.meforum.org/558/iraqi-assyrians-barometer-of-pluralism </ref> <ref> https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/24/iraq-minorities-assyrians </ref>   \n| regions        = [[Nineveh Plains]], [[Dohuk Governorate]], [[Arbil Governorate]] <br> [[Habbaniyah|Habbaniya]] (pre-1990s), [[Baghdad]], [[Basra]] (pre-2003), [[Mosul]] (pre-2014)\n| languages      = [[Neo-Aramaic languages|Neo-Aramaic]] {{smaller|([[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Assyrian]], [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic|Chaldean]])}} <br> [[Mesopotamian Arabic]]\n| religions      = Mainly [[Christianity]]<br /><small>(majority: [[Syriac Christianity]]; minority: [[Protestantism]])</small>\n| native_name    = \u0710\u072c\u0718\u072a\u071d\u0710 \u0715\u0725\u071d\u072a\u0729\n| native_name_lang = syr\n| related_groups =  {{Hlist|[[Iraqi Jews]]||[[Iraqi Arabs]]|[[Mandaeans]]}}\n}}\n\n'''Assyrians in Iraq''' ({{lang-syr|\u0710\u072c\u0718\u072a\u071d\u0710 \u0715\u0725\u071d\u072a\u0729}}, {{lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u0622\u0634\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0648\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0642}}) are an [[ethnic]] and linguistic [[minority group]], [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] to [[Upper Mesopotamia]].

In 1895 in Diyarbak\u0131r Kurdish and Turkish militia began attacking Christians, plundering Assyrian villages. In 1915 Kurds and Turks plundered villages, about 7000 Assyrians were killed. In [[1915]] Turkish troops \"with Kurdish detachments\" committed mass slaughters of Assyrians in Iran.

In these places \"the system of persecutions and extorsions became intolerable to populations who had become accustomed to their slavery\". According to Cambon, the Porte refused reforms and persisted in \"maintaining a veritable regime of terror, arrests, assasinations and rape.\".<ref>Islam and Dhimmitude: Where Civilizations Collide by Bat Ye\u02bcor. 116-18</ref> In 1925 the Muslim Kurds \"rose in revolt against the \"atheist government of Ankara\" and demanded autonomy, the restoration of religious laws and of the sultanate\".<ref>Islam and Dhimmitude: Where Civilizations Collide by Bat Ye\u02bcor. 40</ref> In 1932 Iraqi forces commanded by Kurdish general Bakr Sidki killed 600 Assyrians at Simel, near Mosul.

Kurdish writers have recounted that \"the Kurdish troops attacked the Assyrians and started slaughters. Consequently, a few Assyrians were killed, their villages were destroyed and set into fire... For the second time, in 1846, the Assyrians residing at the Thuma region have been massacred....\" British writer William Eagleton said that \"in 1843 and 1846, Bedirhan started a massacre and booting campaign against the Christian Assyrians (Nestorians) he was anxious about whose getting stronger and independent through becoming able to rule themselves. It was intolerable for Bedirhan to see the Assyrians living on his own territories getting stronger. Thus he killed ten thousand Assyrians. Even though Bedirhan was a feudal tribal leader, he was expressing the aspirations of Kurdish nationalism.\" Kurdish and Arab attacks on Assyrians continued, culminating in the August 1933 Simele Massacres. About 3000 Assyrians were killed in that single month alone.<ref>http://www.atour.com/education/20000825a.html</ref>\n\nBeginning in August 1933 Iraqi soldiers and Kurdish militia killed thousands of Assyrias in Simele (Iraq). The massacre had a big influence on Raphael Lemkin, the jurist who coined the word \"genocide.<ref>https://www.ncas.rutgers.edu/center-study-genocide-conflict-resolution-and-human-rights/assyrian-genocide-1914-1923-and-1933-pres</ref> The Simmele Massacre is also commemorated yearly with the official Assyrian Martyrs Day on 7 August. The massacre was carried out by the Iraqi Army, led by Kurdish General Bakir Sidqi, and Kurdish and Arab irregulars. There were about 3,000 victims of the massacre.<ref>http://www.aina.org/releases/20040805022140.htm</ref>  Turks, with the cooperation of Kurdish groups, conducted systematic murder against the Christian population. Beginning in the first half of the 19th century, the Turks allied with Kurdish tribes. After the Kurds weregranted  an emirate in Syriac Cizre in 1842, the Kurds launched brutal assaults against Christians under the command of Kurdish emir Bedr Khan, who murdered thousands of Assyrians in the region of Tur Abdin and Hakkari. Christian areas were subjected to the migration of Kurdish tribes. Many massacres were carried out against Christians in 1895 in Diyarbakir, Urfa, Mardin, Nusaybin, Meyafarkin, Tur Abdin and Viranshahr. [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] were eradicated from Tur Abdin, Mardin, Diyarbakir and Hakkari in [[Turkey]] and Urmia in Iran. The Syriac city of Mardin was captured by Turks and given over to Kurds who expelled its original population.<ref name=\"araborthodoxy.blogspot.com\">http://araborthodoxy.blogspot.com/2013/12/as-safir-on-history-of-persecution-of.html</ref> Only a few of the Christians of the Nineveh Plain remain after the repeated attacks by Arab and Kurdish fighters.  Historically Christian cities like Erbil, Zakho, Dohuk, Kirkuk, and Mosul have been Kurdicized and Islamized.  Suryanis emigrated from [[Syria]] after the Amuda massacre of August [[1937]]. The massacre was carried out by Kurdish general Saeed Agha and emptied the city of its Suryani population. Malikiya, Darbasiya and Amuda have since become completely Kurdish. Also the historically Christian city of Nusaybin has become Kurdish. [[Christians]] fled to Qamishly which became a Christian city until the immigration of Kurds beginning in 1926.<ref name=\"araborthodoxy.blogspot.com\"/>\n\nKurdish-Christian Armenian relations were bitter at the turn of the 19th century and land conflicts were a major problem. Many Christians and Europeans regarded the Kurds as barbarians and a major threat, the French consul at Erzurum describing them as a blood-thirsty savage population which is used to plundering and a nomadic life. Kurds also played a major part in the Ottoman army, also through the Hamidiye.<ref>The Margins of Empire: Kurdish Militias in the Ottoman Tribal Zone, Janet Klein Stanford University Press, 2011</ref> The Kurdish chieftain Bedr Khan during his rise to power massacred about 10,000 Assyrians in 1842.

This led to an exodus of Assyrians from the mountains of [[Hakkari]] and the plains of [[Urmia]] to a British-led refugee camp in [[Baqubah]].\n\n==British Mandate==\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Independent Kingdom of Iraq==\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Simele Massacre===\n{{Main|Simele Massacre}}\n\nDuring July 1933, about 800 armed Assyrians headed for the Syrian border, where they were turned back by the French. While [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]] had briefly left the country for medical reasons, the Minister of Interior, [[Hikmat Sulayman]], adopted a policy aimed at a ''final solution'' of the \"Assyrian problem\". This policy was implemented by an Iraqi-Kurd, General [[Bakr Sidqi]]. After engaging in several unsuccessful clashes with armed Assyrian tribesmen, on 11 August 1933, Sidqi permitted his men to attack and kill about 3,000 unarmed Assyrian civilian villagers, including women, children and the elderly, at the Assyrian villages of [[Sumail]] (Simele) district, and later at [[Suryia]]. Having scapegoated the Assyrians as dangerous national traitors, this massacre of unarmed civilians became a symbol of national pride, and enhanced Sidqi's prestige. The British, though represented by a powerful military presence as provided by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, failed to intervene or allow the well-disciplined [[Assyrian Levies]] under their command to do so, and indeed helped whitewash the event at the [[League of Nations]].\n\nThe Assyrian repression marked the entrance of the military into Iraqi politics, a pattern that has periodically re-emerged since 1958, and offered an excuse for enlarging conscription.\n\n==Republic of Iraq==\n===Recognition of the Syriac language by the Ba'thist regime===\nIn the early 1970s, the secularist [[Ba'athist Iraq|Ba'ath]] regime initially tried to change the suppression of Assyrians in Iraq through different laws that were passed. On 20 February 1972, the government passed the law to recognize the cultural rights of Assyrians by allowing [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] be taught schools in which the majority of pupils spoke that language in addition to [[Arabic]]. Aramaic was also to be taught at intermediate and secondary schools in which the majority of students spoke that language in addition to Arabic, but it never happened. Special Assyrian programs were to be broadcast on public radio and television and three Syriac-language magazines were planned to be published in the capital. An Association of Syriac-Speaking Authors and Writers had also been established.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/CERD.C.240.Add.3.En?OpenDocument |title=Twelfth periodic reports of States parties due in 1993 : Iraq. 14/06/96, Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (the Iraqi government's point of view) |publisher=Unhchr.ch |date= |accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref>\n\nThe bill turned out to be a failure.

A mysterious, media-shy, and wealthy Assyrian [[Sarkis Aghajan Mamendo]] was a key player in this apparently straightforward story of a small beleaguered minority learning to stand up for itself once more. He is the finance minister for the Kurdish regional government, and he is a member of the Kurdish Democratic Party believed to be close to Kurdish Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani. New churches are going up across the north, paid for, everyone says, by Sarkis.

Assyrians were deprived of their ethnic, cultural and national rights while at the same time the Ba'athist regime tried to co-opt their history.

The longest line in the network, it travels mainly east\u2013west for approximately {{convert|33|mi|km|0}} in the cities of [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]], [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], Portland, and [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]], serving 48 stations between {{stn|Hatfield Government Center}} and {{stn|Cleveland Avenue}}. The line is the busiest of the five MAX lines, carrying an average 55,370 riders per day on weekdays in September 2018. It runs for 22{{frac|1|2}} hours per day from Monday to Thursday, with [[headway]]s of between 30 minutes off-peak and five minutes during [[rush hour]]. Service runs later in the evening on Fridays and Saturdays and ends earlier on Sundays.\n\nThe success of local [[Highway revolts in the United States|freeway revolts]] in the early 1970s led to the reallocation of [[Administration of federal assistance in the United States|federal assistance funds]] from the proposed [[Mount Hood Freeway]] and [[Interstate 505 (Oregon)|Interstate 505]] (I-505) projects to mass transit. Local governments approved the construction of a light rail line in Portland in 1978. Referred to as the '''Banfield light rail project''' during its planning and construction because of its proximity to the [[Banfield Freeway]], and later, the '''Eastside MAX''', construction of what is now the line's eastern half\u2014between [[downtown Portland]] and Gresham\u2014began in 1983. It opened on September&nbsp;5, 1986, as the inaugural line of the MAX system.\n\nPlanning for the line's subsequent extension to the west side, known as the '''Westside MAX''', began as early as 1979. This second segment, delayed by nearly a decade due to funding disagreements, had initially been slated to terminate on 185th Avenue, near the border between Hillsboro and Beaverton. Proponents of a longer line achieved a supplemental extension to downtown Hillsboro just before the line's groundbreaking in 1993.

The longest line in the network, it travels mainly east\u2013west for approximately {{convert|33|mi|km|0}} in the cities of [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]], [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], Portland, and [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]], serving 48 stations between {{stn|Hatfield Government Center}} and {{stn|Cleveland Avenue}}. The line is the busiest of the five MAX lines, carrying an average 55,370 riders per day on weekdays in September 2018. It runs for 22{{frac|1|2}} hours per day from Monday to Thursday, with [[headway]]s of between 30 minutes off-peak and five minutes during [[rush hour]]. Service runs later in the evening on Fridays and Saturdays and ends earlier on Sundays.\n\nThe success of local [[Highway revolts in the United States|freeway revolts]] in the early 1970s led to the reallocation of [[Administration of federal assistance in the United States|federal assistance funds]] from the proposed [[Mount Hood Freeway]] and [[Interstate 505 (Oregon)|Interstate 505]] (I-505) projects to mass transit. Local governments approved the construction of a light rail line in Portland in 1978. Referred to as the '''Banfield light rail project''' during its planning and construction because of its proximity to the [[Banfield Freeway]], and later, the '''Eastside MAX''', construction of what is now the line's eastern half\u2014between [[downtown Portland]] and Gresham\u2014began in 1983. It opened on September&nbsp;5, 1986, as the inaugural line of the MAX system.\n\nPlanning for the line's subsequent extension to the west side, known as the '''Westside MAX''', began as early as 1979. This second segment, delayed by nearly a decade due to funding disagreements, had initially been slated to terminate on 185th Avenue, near the border between Hillsboro and Beaverton. Proponents of a longer line achieved a supplemental extension to downtown Hillsboro just before the line's groundbreaking in 1993. It opened in two phases following delays in tunnel construction; the first section up to [[Goose Hollow, Portland, Oregon|Goose Hollow]] opened in 1997 and the entire extension began operating on September&nbsp;12, 1998.\n\nIn 2000, the two distinct segments, already operating as a single [[through route]] between Gresham and Hillsboro, were further unified in passenger information as the Blue Line, after TriMet introduced a [[color code|color coding]] scheme amid preparations for the opening of a second service: the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]] to [[Portland International Airport]]. The Blue Line currently shares its route with the Red Line on the west side, between [[Beaverton Transit Center]] and [[Rose Quarter Transit Center]]. On the east side, it shares tracks with both the Red Line and the [[MAX Green Line|Green Line]], between Rose Quarter Transit Center and [[Gateway/Northeast 99th Avenue Transit Center]].\n\n==Eastside history==\n===Early freeway proposals===\n{{Main|Mount Hood Freeway}}\n\nIn 1955, the [[Oregon Department of Transportation|Oregon State Highway Department]] laid out the freeway development plan for the [[Portland metropolitan area]]; it proposed the construction of the [[Mount Hood Freeway]] and [[Interstate 505 (Oregon)|I-505]], among others.<ref>{{cite news |last=Shoemaker |first=Mervin |title=Plan Given for Traffic of Future - Highway Engineer Submits Report to Commission |work=[[The Oregonian]] |date=June 29, 1955 |page=1}}</ref> Led by newly elected Portland Mayor [[Neil Goldschmidt]], whose campaign centered around freeway opposition,<ref name=\"Portland kills\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-23466-feb-4-1974-portland-kills-the-mount-hood-freeway.html |title=Feb. 4, 1974: Portland kills the Mount Hood Freeway... |last=Mesh |first=Aaron |newspaper=[[Willamette Week]] |date=November 4, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010161716/https://www.wweek.com/portland/article-23466-feb-4-1974-portland-kills-the-mount-hood-freeway.html |archive-date=October 10, 2018 |access-date=July 26, 2018}}</ref> citizen protests and two other factors led to the eventual cancellation of both projects.

Kercher was found dead on the floor of her bedroom. By the time the bloodstained fingerprints at the scene were identified as belonging to [[Rudy Guede]], police had charged Kercher's American [[Roommate|flatmate]], [[Amanda Knox]], and Knox's Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito. The subsequent prosecutions of Knox and Sollecito received international publicity, with forensic experts and jurists taking a critical view of the evidence supporting the initial guilty verdicts.\n\nGuede was tried separately in a fast-track procedure and in October 2008 was found guilty of the sexual assault and murder of Kercher. He subsequently exhausted the appeals process and is currently serving a 16-year sentence.\n\nKnox and Sollecito were released after almost four years following their acquittal at a second-level trial, even though Knox was sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment for maliciously accusing an innocent. Knox immediately returned to the United States.\n\nThe appeals verdicts of acquittal were declared null, however, for \"manifest illogicalities\" by the [[Supreme Court of Cassation of Italy]] in 2013. The appeals trials had to be repeated; they took place in Florence, where the two were convicted again in 2014.\n\nThe conviction of Knox and Sollecito was eventually annulled by the Supreme Court on March 27, 2015. The Supreme Court of Cassation invoked the provision of art. 530 \u00a7 2. of Italian Procedure Code (\"reasonable doubt\") and ordered that no further trial should be held, which resulted in their acquittal and end of case.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{cite web|title=Italian court acquits Knox and Sollecito of Kercher murder|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32096621 |date=28 March 2015|work=BBC News}}</ref> The verdict pointed out that as scientific evidence was \"central\" to the case, there were \"glaring ''defaillances''\" or \"amnesia\" and \"culpable omissions of investigation activities\".\n\n==Meredith Kercher==\n[[File:Stadperugialigging.png|thumb|right|alt=photograph|Kercher arrived in [[Perugia]] in August 2007.]]\n{{external media\n| align = right\n| width = 210px\n| image1 = [http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/images/46846000/jpg/_46846646_004710493-1.jpg Via della Pergola 7], courtesy of the BBC.}}\n\n===Background===\nMeredith Susanna Cara Kercher (born 28 December 1985 in [[Southwark]], [[South London]]), known to her friends as \"Mez\", lived in [[Coulsdon]], South London. Kercher attended the [[Old Palace School]] in [[Croydon]]. She was enthusiastic about the language and culture of Italy, and after a school exchange trip she returned, aged 15, to spend her summer vacation with a family in [[Sessa Aurunca]].<ref name=\"Kercher, John 2012 p.41-60\">Kercher, John (2012). Meredith: Our Daughter's Murder and the Heartbreaking Quest for the Truth p.41-60</ref>\n\nKercher studied European politics and Italian at the [[University of Leeds]]. Working as a [[Bartender|barmaid]], tour guide and in promotions to support herself, she made a cameo appearance in the music video for [[Kristian Leontiou]]'s song \"Some Say\" in 2004.<ref name=\"Kercher, John 2012 p.41-60\"/><ref name=\"Kercher, John 2012 p.78\">Kercher, John (2012).

In October 2007, she attended the [[University of Perugia]], where she began courses in modern history, political theory, and the history of cinema. Fellow students later described her as caring, intelligent, witty, and popular.<ref name=\"Kercher, John 2012 p.78\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7693702.stm |title=Profile: Meredith Kercher |publisher=BBC News |date=4 December 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Via della Pergola 7===\nPerugia, a well-known cultural and artistic centre, is a city of 150,000 people. More than a quarter of the population are students, many from abroad, giving it a vibrant social scene. In Perugia, Kercher shared a four-bedroom ground-floor flat in a house at Via della Pergola 7 {{nowrap|({{Coord|43.1148|12.3914|type:landmark_region:IT|display=inline,title|name=Via della Pergola 7, Perugia}}).}}\nHer flatmates were two Italian women in their late twenties, Filomena Romanelli and Laura Mezzetti, and a 20-year-old American student from the [[University of Washington]], [[Amanda Knox]], who was attending the [[University for Foreigners Perugia|University for Foreigners in Perugia]] on an exchange year. Kercher and Knox moved in on 10 and 20 September 2007, respectively, meeting each other for the first time.<ref name=\"DEx\">Murphy, Dennis.

Late one night in mid-October, Kercher and Knox met [[Rudy Guede]] when they returned home at 2:00&nbsp;a.m. Guede had been invited into the lower level flat by some of the Italian tenants, to whom he had attached himself. At 4:30&nbsp;a.m., Kercher and Knox left.<ref>{{harvnb|Follain|2011|p=39}} (\"Meredith joined them she took just one pull on the joint; she was no habitual smoker\")</ref><ref name=\"NoR\">Wise, Ann.

Kercher's bedroom door was locked, which Knox took as indicating that Kercher was sleeping. After showering in the bathroom she and Kercher shared, Knox found faeces in the toilet of the bathroom shared by Romanelli and Mezzetti. Knox went back to Sollecito's home and later returned with him to Via della Pergola 7. Noticing a broken window in Romanelli's bedroom and alarmed that Kercher did not answer her door, Sollecito unsuccessfully tried to force the door open. Sollecito called his sister, a lieutenant in the ''[[carabinieri]]'', for advice. She advised him to call the 112 emergency number, which he did.<ref>{{harvnb|Burleigh|2011|pp=172\u2013174}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Follain|2011|pp=70\u201371}}</ref>\n\n===Discovery of the body===\nAfter receiving a phone call from Knox, Romanelli arrived at the flat. Candace Dempsey writes that in rummaging around, looking for anything that might be missing, Romanelli inadvertently disturbed the crime scene.<ref>{{harvnb|Dempsey|2010|pp=61\u201362}}</ref> On discovering that the two phones Kercher typically carried with her had been found in a nearby garden, Romanelli became concerned and requested that the police force open the door to Kercher's bedroom, but the police declined. Instead, Romanelli's male friend forced the door open at around 1:15&nbsp;p.m., and the body of Kercher was found inside, lying on the floor, covered by a [[duvet]].<ref>{{harvnb|Follain|2011|p=72}}</ref>\n\n===Autopsy===\nPathologist Luca Lalli, from Perugia's forensic science institute, performed the [[autopsy]] on Kercher's body. Her injuries consisted of sixteen bruises and seven cuts. These included several bruises and a couple of insubstantial cuts on the palm of her hand. Bruises on her nose, nostrils, mouth, and underneath her jaw were compatible with a hand being clamped over her mouth and nose.<ref>{{harvnb|Follain|2011|pp=116\u2013118}}</ref> Lalli's autopsy report was reviewed by three pathologists from Perugia's forensic science institute who interpreted the injuries, including some to the genital region, as indicating an attempt to immobilize Kercher during sexual violence.<ref name=\"Follain p.296\">{{harvnb|Follain|2011|p=296}}</ref>\n\n===Interment===\nA funeral was held on 14 December 2007 at [[Croydon Minster|Croydon Parish Church]], with more than 300 people in attendance, followed by a private burial at Croydon's Mitcham Road Cemetery.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/1904729.Update__Meredith_laid_to_rest/ |work=Croydon Guardian |title=Meredith laid to rest |first=Gemma |last=Wheatley |date=14 December 2007}}</ref> The degree that Kercher would have received in 2009 was awarded posthumously by the [[University of Leeds]].<ref>Barry, Colleen.

Matteini ordered Knox, Sollecito, and Lumumba to be detained for a year. On 19 November 2007, the Rome forensic police matched fingerprints found in Kercher's bedroom to Rudy Guede.

Kercher was found dead on the floor of her bedroom. By the time the bloodstained fingerprints at the scene were identified as belonging to [[Rudy Guede]], police had charged Kercher's American [[Roommate|flatmate]], [[Amanda Knox]], and Knox's Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito. The subsequent prosecutions of Knox and Sollecito received international publicity, with forensic experts and jurists taking a critical view of the evidence supporting the initial guilty verdicts.\n\nGuede was tried separately in a fast-track procedure and in October 2008 was found guilty of the sexual assault and murder of Kercher. He subsequently exhausted the appeals process and is currently serving a 16-year sentence.\n\nKnox and Sollecito were released after almost four years following their acquittal at a second-level trial, even though Knox was sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment for maliciously accusing an innocent. Knox immediately returned to the United States.\n\nThe appeals verdicts of acquittal were declared null, however, for \"manifest illogicalities\" by the [[Supreme Court of Cassation of Italy]] in 2013. The appeals trials had to be repeated; they took place in Florence, where the two were convicted again in 2014.\n\nThe conviction of Knox and Sollecito was eventually annulled by the Supreme Court on March 27, 2015. The Supreme Court of Cassation invoked the provision of art. 530 \u00a7 2. of Italian Procedure Code (\"reasonable doubt\") and ordered that no further trial should be held, which resulted in their acquittal and end of case.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{cite web|title=Italian court acquits Knox and Sollecito of Kercher murder|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32096621 |date=28 March 2015|work=BBC News}}</ref> The verdict pointed out that as scientific evidence was \"central\" to the case, there were \"glaring ''defaillances''\" or \"amnesia\" and \"culpable omissions of investigation activities\".\n\n==Meredith Kercher==\n[[File:Stadperugialigging.png|thumb|right|alt=photograph|Kercher arrived in [[Perugia]] in August 2007.]]\n{{external media\n| align = right\n| width = 210px\n| image1 = [http://news.bbc.co.uk/media/images/46846000/jpg/_46846646_004710493-1.jpg Via della Pergola 7], courtesy of the BBC.}}\n\n===Background===\nMeredith Susanna Cara Kercher (born 28 December 1985 in [[Southwark]], [[South London]]), known to her friends as \"Mez\", lived in [[Coulsdon]], South London. Kercher attended the [[Old Palace School]] in [[Croydon]]. She was enthusiastic about the language and culture of Italy, and after a school exchange trip she returned, aged 15, to spend her summer vacation with a family in [[Sessa Aurunca]].<ref name=\"Kercher, John 2012 p.41-60\">Kercher, John (2012). Meredith: Our Daughter's Murder and the Heartbreaking Quest for the Truth p.41-60</ref>\n\nKercher studied European politics and Italian at the [[University of Leeds]]. Working as a [[Bartender|barmaid]], tour guide and in promotions to support herself, she made a cameo appearance in the music video for [[Kristian Leontiou]]'s song \"Some Say\" in 2004.<ref name=\"Kercher, John 2012 p.41-60\"/><ref name=\"Kercher, John 2012 p.78\">Kercher, John (2012).

In October 2007, she attended the [[University of Perugia]], where she began courses in modern history, political theory, and the history of cinema. Fellow students later described her as caring, intelligent, witty, and popular.<ref name=\"Kercher, John 2012 p.78\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7693702.stm |title=Profile: Meredith Kercher |publisher=BBC News |date=4 December 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Via della Pergola 7===\nPerugia, a well-known cultural and artistic centre, is a city of 150,000 people. More than a quarter of the population are students, many from abroad, giving it a vibrant social scene. In Perugia, Kercher shared a four-bedroom ground-floor flat in a house at Via della Pergola 7 {{nowrap|({{Coord|43.1148|12.3914|type:landmark_region:IT|display=inline,title|name=Via della Pergola 7, Perugia}}).}}\nHer flatmates were two Italian women in their late twenties, Filomena Romanelli and Laura Mezzetti, and a 20-year-old American student from the [[University of Washington]], [[Amanda Knox]], who was attending the [[University for Foreigners Perugia|University for Foreigners in Perugia]] on an exchange year. Kercher and Knox moved in on 10 and 20 September 2007, respectively, meeting each other for the first time.<ref name=\"DEx\">Murphy, Dennis. [http://www.nbcnews.com/id/22332240 \"Deadly exchange\"], NBC News, 21 December 2007.</ref> Kercher typically called her mother daily on a [[mobile phone]]; a second mobile phone she used was registered to her flatmate, Romanelli.<ref>{{harvnb|Follain|2011|pp=25\u201347}}</ref>\n\nThe lower level of the house was occupied by four Italian young men with whom both Kercher and Knox were friendly. Late one night in mid-October, Kercher and Knox met [[Rudy Guede]] when they returned home at 2:00&nbsp;a.m. Guede had been invited into the lower level flat by some of the Italian tenants, to whom he had attached himself. At 4:30&nbsp;a.m., Kercher and Knox left.<ref>{{harvnb|Follain|2011|p=39}} (\"Meredith joined them she took just one pull on the joint; she was no habitual smoker\")</ref><ref name=\"NoR\">Wise, Ann.

Kercher's bedroom door was locked, which Knox took as indicating that Kercher was sleeping. After showering in the bathroom she and Kercher shared, Knox found faeces in the toilet of the bathroom shared by Romanelli and Mezzetti. Knox went back to Sollecito's home and later returned with him to Via della Pergola 7. Noticing a broken window in Romanelli's bedroom and alarmed that Kercher did not answer her door, Sollecito unsuccessfully tried to force the door open. Sollecito called his sister, a lieutenant in the ''[[carabinieri]]'', for advice. She advised him to call the 112 emergency number, which he did.<ref>{{harvnb|Burleigh|2011|pp=172\u2013174}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Follain|2011|pp=70\u201371}}</ref>\n\n===Discovery of the body===\nAfter receiving a phone call from Knox, Romanelli arrived at the flat. Candace Dempsey writes that in rummaging around, looking for anything that might be missing, Romanelli inadvertently disturbed the crime scene.<ref>{{harvnb|Dempsey|2010|pp=61\u201362}}</ref> On discovering that the two phones Kercher typically carried with her had been found in a nearby garden, Romanelli became concerned and requested that the police force open the door to Kercher's bedroom, but the police declined. Instead, Romanelli's male friend forced the door open at around 1:15&nbsp;p.m., and the body of Kercher was found inside, lying on the floor, covered by a [[duvet]].<ref>{{harvnb|Follain|2011|p=72}}</ref>\n\n===Autopsy===\nPathologist Luca Lalli, from Perugia's forensic science institute, performed the [[autopsy]] on Kercher's body. Her injuries consisted of sixteen bruises and seven cuts. These included several bruises and a couple of insubstantial cuts on the palm of her hand. Bruises on her nose, nostrils, mouth, and underneath her jaw were compatible with a hand being clamped over her mouth and nose.<ref>{{harvnb|Follain|2011|pp=116\u2013118}}</ref> Lalli's autopsy report was reviewed by three pathologists from Perugia's forensic science institute who interpreted the injuries, including some to the genital region, as indicating an attempt to immobilize Kercher during sexual violence.<ref name=\"Follain p.296\">{{harvnb|Follain|2011|p=296}}</ref>\n\n===Interment===\nA funeral was held on 14 December 2007 at [[Croydon Minster|Croydon Parish Church]], with more than 300 people in attendance, followed by a private burial at Croydon's Mitcham Road Cemetery.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/1904729.Update__Meredith_laid_to_rest/ |work=Croydon Guardian |title=Meredith laid to rest |first=Gemma |last=Wheatley |date=14 December 2007}}</ref> The degree that Kercher would have received in 2009 was awarded posthumously by the [[University of Leeds]].<ref>Barry, Colleen.

Matteini ordered Knox, Sollecito, and Lumumba to be detained for a year. On 19 November 2007, the Rome forensic police matched fingerprints found in Kercher's bedroom to Rudy Guede.

The lists are extremely incomplete for players from the [[City Rovers]] club who had no scoring whatsoever for their 24\u201317 win over [[Grafton Athletic]], and their 66\u201313 win over the same opponents. In total the City team was missing the scorers of 112 of its points. Likewise [[Devonport United]] was missing scorers for 7 points, [[Newton Rangers]] for 13, Maritime for 3, [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] for 15, and [[Grafton Athletic]] for 30 (from the two matches with City). In addition to this a number of teams featured brothers and often there was no distinction made as to which of the Grey brothers of Maritime it was. H Grey scored 4 tries, while C grey was credited with 3, along with 2 conversions, however \"Grey\" was credited with 8 tries, 1 conversion, 1 penalty, and a drop goal which could have been either of the aforementioned players in each instance. Also Ponsonby had a try and conversion credited to McGregor but they could have been scored by either E McGregor or [[Dougie McGregor]].\n\n[[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] replicated the feat of his younger brother [[George Davidson (athlete)|George]] of the previous season by leading the point scoring while playing for Maritime. George had qualified for the Antwerp Olympics where he ran 5th in the 200m final and did not play in the Auckland Rugby League competition at all in 1920. He was to return and join his brothers in the City Rovers team from the 1921 season onwards.\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!Rank!!Player!!Team!!Tries\n|-\n|1||[[George Paki]]||City Rovers||9\n|-\n|1||J McGregor||Maritime||9\n|-\n|3||C Nicholson||Devonport United||8\n|-\n|3||[[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]]||Devonport United||8\n|-\n|5||A Eustace||Marist Old Boys||6\n|-\n|6||E McGregor||Ponsonby United||5\n|-\n|6||[[Wally Somers]]||Newton Rangers||5\n|-\n|6||[[Ernie Herring]]||Maritime||5\n|-\n|6||[[Bert Avery]]||Maritime||5\n|-\n|6||[[Bill Stormont]]||Marist||5\n|-\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!Rank!!Player!!Team!!Tries!!Con!!Pen!!Mark!!Drop Goal!!Points\n|-\n|1||[[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]]||City Rovers||8||14||6||0||0||64\n|-\n|2||[[Craddock Dufty]]||Newton Rangers||1||17||10||0||0||57\n|-\n|3||A Cross||Ponsonby United||0||9||6||0||0||30\n|-\n|4||J McGregor||Maritime||9||1||0||0||0||29\n|-\n|5||[[George Paki]]||City Rovers||9||0||0||0||0||27\n|-\n|6||A Sutton||Maritime||4||4||1||1||1||26\n|-\n|7||C Nicholson||Devonport United||8||0||0||0||0||24\n|-\n|8||[[Bill Stormont]]||Marist Old Boys||5||2||1||0||0||21\n|-\n|8||Billy Ghent||Marist Old Boys||3||3||3||0||0||21\n|-\n|10||[[Maurice Wetherill]]||City Rovers||4||4||0||0||0||20\n|-\n|10||Stewart||Devonport United||0||6||4||0||0||20\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Thacker Shield==\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] defended the [[Thacker Shield]] from Federal (of [[Christchurch]]) at Victoria Park in front of 10,000 spectators.

The lists are extremely incomplete for players from the [[City Rovers]] club who had no scoring whatsoever for their 24\u201317 win over [[Grafton Athletic]], and their 66\u201313 win over the same opponents. In total the City team was missing the scorers of 112 of its points. Likewise [[Devonport United]] was missing scorers for 7 points, [[Newton Rangers]] for 13, Maritime for 3, [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]] for 15, and [[Grafton Athletic]] for 30 (from the two matches with City). In addition to this a number of teams featured brothers and often there was no distinction made as to which of the Grey brothers of Maritime it was. H Grey scored 4 tries, while C grey was credited with 3, along with 2 conversions, however \"Grey\" was credited with 8 tries, 1 conversion, 1 penalty, and a drop goal which could have been either of the aforementioned players in each instance. Also Ponsonby had a try and conversion credited to McGregor but they could have been scored by either E McGregor or [[Dougie McGregor]].\n\n[[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]] replicated the feat of his younger brother [[George Davidson (athlete)|George]] of the previous season by leading the point scoring while playing for Maritime. George had qualified for the Antwerp Olympics where he ran 5th in the 200m final and did not play in the Auckland Rugby League competition at all in 1920. He was to return and join his brothers in the City Rovers team from the 1921 season onwards.\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!Rank!!Player!!Team!!Tries\n|-\n|1||[[George Paki]]||City Rovers||9\n|-\n|1||J McGregor||Maritime||9\n|-\n|3||C Nicholson||Devonport United||8\n|-\n|3||[[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]]||Devonport United||8\n|-\n|5||A Eustace||Marist Old Boys||6\n|-\n|6||E McGregor||Ponsonby United||5\n|-\n|6||[[Wally Somers]]||Newton Rangers||5\n|-\n|6||[[Ernie Herring]]||Maritime||5\n|-\n|6||[[Bert Avery]]||Maritime||5\n|-\n|6||[[Bill Stormont]]||Marist||5\n|-\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!Rank!!Player!!Team!!Tries!!Con!!Pen!!Mark!!Drop Goal!!Points\n|-\n|1||[[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]]||City Rovers||8||14||6||0||0||64\n|-\n|2||[[Craddock Dufty]]||Newton Rangers||1||17||10||0||0||57\n|-\n|3||A Cross||Ponsonby United||0||9||6||0||0||30\n|-\n|4||J McGregor||Maritime||9||1||0||0||0||29\n|-\n|5||[[George Paki]]||City Rovers||9||0||0||0||0||27\n|-\n|6||A Sutton||Maritime||4||4||1||1||1||26\n|-\n|7||C Nicholson||Devonport United||8||0||0||0||0||24\n|-\n|8||[[Bill Stormont]]||Marist Old Boys||5||2||1||0||0||21\n|-\n|8||Billy Ghent||Marist Old Boys||3||3||3||0||0||21\n|-\n|10||[[Maurice Wetherill]]||City Rovers||4||4||0||0||0||20\n|-\n|10||Stewart||Devonport United||0||6||4||0||0||20\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Thacker Shield==\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] defended the [[Thacker Shield]] from Federal (of [[Christchurch]]) at Victoria Park in front of 10,000 spectators.

Their debut album, ''[[Wonderland (Erasure album)|Wonderland]]'', was mostly recorded in 1985 and released in June 1986. Although it only made the UK Top 75, it made a sizeable mark in Germany, making the Top 20.\n\nIt was with the release of their fourth single, \"[[Sometimes (Erasure song)|Sometimes]]\", that Erasure finally received recognition in the UK in late 1986. The song peaked at number 2 in the UK and Germany and spent many weeks in the UK Top 40, marking the beginning of a long string of major hits for the duo.\n\nThe single's parent album, ''[[The Circus (Erasure album)|The Circus]]'', was released in March 1987 and reached number 6 and turned platinum in the UK with three additional hit singles: \"[[It Doesn't Have To Be]]\", \"[[Victim of Love (Erasure song)|Victim of Love]]\" and \"[[The Circus (song)|The Circus]]\". The album remained on the charts for over a year.\n\nErasure's third album, ''[[The Innocents (Erasure album)|The Innocents]]'', was released in April 1988. Preceded by the Top 10 single \"[[Ship of Fools (Erasure song)|Ship of Fools]]\", the album hit number 1 in the UK on its initial release and returned to the summit a year later, eventually going double platinum. It also turned platinum in the U.S., generating two Top 20 hits in \"[[Chains of Love (Erasure song)|Chains of Love]]\" and \"[[A Little Respect]]\". ''The Innocents'' was the first of five consecutive number 1 albums for Erasure in the UK, including the greatest hits compilation ''[[Pop! The First 20 Hits]]''. In November 1988, the ''[[Crackers International]]'' EP, led by the song \"Stop!\", hit number 2 in the UK singles chart. The albums ''[[Wild! (Erasure album)|Wild!]]'' (1989) and ''[[Chorus (Erasure album)|Chorus]]'' (1991) both contained four Top 20 singles and were major sellers.\n\n''[[Crackers International]]'' was bettered in 1992 by another EP, ''[[Abba-esque]]'', covering four [[ABBA]] hits, which became Erasure's first (and to-date only) number 1 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=MTV>{{cite web|last1=Erlewine|first1=Stephen Thomas|title=Erasure Bio|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/erasure/biography/|website=MTV Artists|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}</ref> It featured a video of the duo dressed in ABBA outfits, and was one of the principal drivers of the ABBA revival scene in the 1990s{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}.\n\n[[Image:19920908 erasure andybell magdeburg.jpg|200px|thumb|Andy Bell in 1992]]\nAlso in 1990, Erasure contributed the song \"[[Too Darn Hot]]\" to the [[Cole Porter]] tribute album ''[[Red Hot + Blue]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. In 1992, a singles compilation, ''[[Pop! The First 20 Hits]]'', also hit number 1 and went triple platinum, featuring all the band's singles released from 1985 to 1992.\n\nIn 1994, Erasure released ''[[I Say I Say I Say]]'', their fifth consecutive number 1 in the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Its first single, \"[[Always (Erasure song)|Always]]\", became the band's third Top 20 hit in the United States, next its second single, \"[[Run to the Sun]]\" was released in July and became their final UK Top 10 hit until 2003. Its third and final single, \"[[I Love Saturday]]\" was released in November.\n\n===Releases 1995\u20132007===\nThe October 1995 release of the album ''[[Erasure (album)|Erasure]]'' marked a determined shift away from Erasure's signature three-minute synthpop to a more introspective and experimental sound. Nevertheless, it made the UK Top 15 and spawned two UK Top 20 singles, \"[[Stay with Me (Erasure song)|Stay with Me]]\" and \"[[Fingers & Thumbs (Cold Summer's Day)|Fingers & Thumbs]]\". A remixed version of \"[[Rock Me Gently (Erasure song)|Rock Me Gently]]\" was released only in Germany and the Czech Republic as the third single.\n\nIn spite of a return to three-minute pop songs, the 1997 album ''[[Cowboy (album)|Cowboy]]'' did not restore the success of their 1986\u20131994 era. ''Cowboy'' enjoyed a short-lived success, peaking at number 10 in the UK but lasting only two weeks in the UK Top 40. In the U.S. Billboard charts though, it was one of their most successful records. The first single \"[[In My Arms (Erasure song)|In My Arms]]\" reached number 13 in the UK and entered the Top 2 in the U.S. Dance chart.  The second single \"[[Don't Say Your Love Is Killing Me]]\" made number 23 in the UK. The third single \"[[Rain (Erasure song)|Rain]]\" was also only released in Germany and the Czech Republic.\n\nIn October 2000, Erasure released their ninth studio album ''[[Loveboat (album)|Loveboat]]'', co-produced with [[Flood (producer)|Flood]], though only peaking at a lowly number 45. The first single was \"[[Freedom (Erasure song)|Freedom]]\", which made a brief entry into the UK Top 30. In 2001 they released a limited EP \"[[Moon & the Sky]]\" containing new versions of the title song, a cover of the song \"[[Baby Love]]\" and some acoustic versions of ''Loveboat'' songs.\n\nThe 2003 release ''[[Other People's Songs]]'' was a collection of [[cover version]]s. Its first single, a cover of [[Peter Gabriel]]'s song \"[[Solsbury Hill (song)|Solsbury Hill]]\", reached the UK Top 10.  The second single from the album was a cover of Steve Harley's \"[[Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)]]\" \u2013  it made number 14 in the UK and Erasure were invited to perform on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' for the first time since March 1997.<ref>[http://www.erasureinfo.com/news/news_2003_01.html 16 Jan : Top Of The Pops Performance And Webchat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123110738/http://erasureinfo.com/news/news_2003_01.html |date=23 January 2009 }}, Erasure official site</ref>\n\nIn 2003 a new 'best of' compilation was released, called ''[[Hits!

They formed in London in 1985. Their debut single was \"[[Who Needs Love Like That]]\". From their fourth single, \"[[Sometimes (Erasure song)|Sometimes]]\", the duo established themselves on the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming one of the most successful artists of the late 1980s to mid-1990s.\n\nFrom 1986 to 2007, Erasure achieved 24 consecutive Top 40 hits in the UK. By 2009, 34 of their 37 chart-eligible singles and EPs had made the UK Top 40, with 17 climbing into the Top 10.

Their debut album, ''[[Wonderland (Erasure album)|Wonderland]]'', was mostly recorded in 1985 and released in June 1986. Although it only made the UK Top 75, it made a sizeable mark in Germany, making the Top 20.\n\nIt was with the release of their fourth single, \"[[Sometimes (Erasure song)|Sometimes]]\", that Erasure finally received recognition in the UK in late 1986. The song peaked at number 2 in the UK and Germany and spent many weeks in the UK Top 40, marking the beginning of a long string of major hits for the duo.\n\nThe single's parent album, ''[[The Circus (Erasure album)|The Circus]]'', was released in March 1987 and reached number 6 and turned platinum in the UK with three additional hit singles: \"[[It Doesn't Have To Be]]\", \"[[Victim of Love (Erasure song)|Victim of Love]]\" and \"[[The Circus (song)|The Circus]]\". The album remained on the charts for over a year.\n\nErasure's third album, ''[[The Innocents (Erasure album)|The Innocents]]'', was released in April 1988. Preceded by the Top 10 single \"[[Ship of Fools (Erasure song)|Ship of Fools]]\", the album hit number 1 in the UK on its initial release and returned to the summit a year later, eventually going double platinum. It also turned platinum in the U.S., generating two Top 20 hits in \"[[Chains of Love (Erasure song)|Chains of Love]]\" and \"[[A Little Respect]]\". ''The Innocents'' was the first of five consecutive number 1 albums for Erasure in the UK, including the greatest hits compilation ''[[Pop! The First 20 Hits]]''. In November 1988, the ''[[Crackers International]]'' EP, led by the song \"Stop!\", hit number 2 in the UK singles chart. The albums ''[[Wild! (Erasure album)|Wild!]]'' (1989) and ''[[Chorus (Erasure album)|Chorus]]'' (1991) both contained four Top 20 singles and were major sellers.\n\n''[[Crackers International]]'' was bettered in 1992 by another EP, ''[[Abba-esque]]'', covering four [[ABBA]] hits, which became Erasure's first (and to-date only) number 1 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=MTV>{{cite web|last1=Erlewine|first1=Stephen Thomas|title=Erasure Bio|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/erasure/biography/|website=MTV Artists|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}</ref> It featured a video of the duo dressed in ABBA outfits, and was one of the principal drivers of the ABBA revival scene in the 1990s{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}.\n\n[[Image:19920908 erasure andybell magdeburg.jpg|200px|thumb|Andy Bell in 1992]]\nAlso in 1990, Erasure contributed the song \"[[Too Darn Hot]]\" to the [[Cole Porter]] tribute album ''[[Red Hot + Blue]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. In 1992, a singles compilation, ''[[Pop! The First 20 Hits]]'', also hit number 1 and went triple platinum, featuring all the band's singles released from 1985 to 1992.\n\nIn 1994, Erasure released ''[[I Say I Say I Say]]'', their fifth consecutive number 1 in the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Its first single, \"[[Always (Erasure song)|Always]]\", became the band's third Top 20 hit in the United States, next its second single, \"[[Run to the Sun]]\" was released in July and became their final UK Top 10 hit until 2003. Its third and final single, \"[[I Love Saturday]]\" was released in November.\n\n===Releases 1995\u20132007===\nThe October 1995 release of the album ''[[Erasure (album)|Erasure]]'' marked a determined shift away from Erasure's signature three-minute synthpop to a more introspective and experimental sound. Nevertheless, it made the UK Top 15 and spawned two UK Top 20 singles, \"[[Stay with Me (Erasure song)|Stay with Me]]\" and \"[[Fingers & Thumbs (Cold Summer's Day)|Fingers & Thumbs]]\". A remixed version of \"[[Rock Me Gently (Erasure song)|Rock Me Gently]]\" was released only in Germany and the Czech Republic as the third single.\n\nIn spite of a return to three-minute pop songs, the 1997 album ''[[Cowboy (album)|Cowboy]]'' did not restore the success of their 1986\u20131994 era. ''Cowboy'' enjoyed a short-lived success, peaking at number 10 in the UK but lasting only two weeks in the UK Top 40. In the U.S. Billboard charts though, it was one of their most successful records. The first single \"[[In My Arms (Erasure song)|In My Arms]]\" reached number 13 in the UK and entered the Top 2 in the U.S. Dance chart.  The second single \"[[Don't Say Your Love Is Killing Me]]\" made number 23 in the UK. The third single \"[[Rain (Erasure song)|Rain]]\" was also only released in Germany and the Czech Republic.\n\nIn October 2000, Erasure released their ninth studio album ''[[Loveboat (album)|Loveboat]]'', co-produced with [[Flood (producer)|Flood]], though only peaking at a lowly number 45. The first single was \"[[Freedom (Erasure song)|Freedom]]\", which made a brief entry into the UK Top 30. In 2001 they released a limited EP \"[[Moon & the Sky]]\" containing new versions of the title song, a cover of the song \"[[Baby Love]]\" and some acoustic versions of ''Loveboat'' songs.\n\nThe 2003 release ''[[Other People's Songs]]'' was a collection of [[cover version]]s. Its first single, a cover of [[Peter Gabriel]]'s song \"[[Solsbury Hill (song)|Solsbury Hill]]\", reached the UK Top 10.  The second single from the album was a cover of Steve Harley's \"[[Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)]]\" \u2013  it made number 14 in the UK and Erasure were invited to perform on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' for the first time since March 1997.<ref>[http://www.erasureinfo.com/news/news_2003_01.html 16 Jan : Top Of The Pops Performance And Webchat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123110738/http://erasureinfo.com/news/news_2003_01.html |date=23 January 2009 }}, Erasure official site</ref>\n\nIn 2003 a new 'best of' compilation was released, called ''[[Hits!

Burial sites dating back to the [[Neolithic Age]] and the [[Bronze Age]] include the oldest known such inland site at [[Jebel Al-Buhais|Jebel Buhais]]. Known as [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]] to the [[Sumer]]ians, the area was home to a prosperous Bronze Age trading culture during the [[Umm al-Nar culture|Umm Al Nar period]], which traded between the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley]], [[Dilmun|Bahrain]] and [[Mesopotamia]] as well as [[Iran]], [[Bactria]] and the [[Levant]]. The ensuing [[Wadi Suq culture|Wadi Suq period]] and three [[Iron Age in the United Arab Emirates|Iron Ages]] saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior. The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]] and the subsequent [[Battle of Dibba]]. The UAE's long history of trade led to the emergence of [[Julfar]], in the present-day emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, as a major regional trading and maritime hub in the area. The maritime dominance of the Persian Gulf by Emirati traders led to conflicts with European powers, including the [[Portuguese Empire]] and the [[British Empire]].\n\nFollowing decades of maritime conflict, the coastal emirates became known as the [[Trucial States]] with the signing of a Perpetual Treaty of Maritime Peace with the British in 1819 (ratified in 1853 and again in 1892), which established the Trucial States as a British [[Protectorate]]. This arrangement ended with independence and the establishment of the United Arab Emirates on 2 December 1971, immediately following the British withdrawal from its treaty obligations. Six emirates joined the UAE in 1971, the seventh, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the federation on 10 February 1972.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates|last=Heard-Bey|first=Frauke|publisher=Motivate|year=2004|isbn=9781860631672|location=|page=370}}</ref>\n\n[[Islam]] is the [[official religion]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is the official language of the UAE.

In 1906, the British Political Resident, [[Percy Cox]], confirmed in writing to the ruler of Abu Dhabi, [[Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan]] ('Zayed the Great') that Khawr al Udayd belonged to his sheikhdom.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morton|first1=Michael Quentin|title=Keepers of the Golden Shore: A History of the United Arab Emirates |date=15 February 2016|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn= 9781780235806|pages=49\u201350 |url=http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk/display.asp?ISB=9781780235806 |accessdate=19 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n===British era and discovery of oil===\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries, the [[pearl hunting|pearling industry]] thrived, providing both income and employment to the people of the Persian Gulf. The [[First World War]] had a severe impact on the industry, but it was the [[depression (economics)|economic depression]] of the late 1920s and early 1930s, coupled with the invention of the [[cultured pearl]], that wiped out the trade. The remnants of the trade eventually faded away shortly after the [[Second World War]], when the newly-independent [[Government of India]] imposed heavy taxation on pearls imported from the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]. The decline of pearling resulted in extreme economic hardship in the Trucial States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/history/trad/trd08.asp |title=UAE History & Traditions: Pearls & pearling |work=UAEinteract |accessdate=12 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206103534/http://www.uaeinteract.com/history/trad/trd08.asp |archivedate=6 February 2016  }}</ref>\n\nIn 1922, the British government secured undertakings from the rulers of the Trucial States not to sign concessions with foreign companies without their consent. Aware of the potential for the development of natural resources such as oil, following finds in Persia (from 1908) and Mesopotamia (from 1927), a British-led oil company, the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC), showed an interest in the region. The [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (APOC, later to become British Petroleum, or BP) had a 23.75% share in IPC. From 1935, onshore concessions to explore for oil were granted by local rulers, with APOC signing the first one on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd (PCL), an associate company of IPC.<ref>{{Cite book|title = From Pearls to Oil|last = Heard|first = David|work= Motivate|year = 2013|isbn = 9781860633119|location = UAE|pages = 41\u201342}}</ref> APOC was prevented from developing the region alone because of the restrictions of the [[Red Line Agreement]], which required it to operate through IPC. A number of options between PCL and the trucial rulers were signed, providing useful revenue for communities experiencing poverty following the collapse of the pearl trade. However, the wealth of oil which the rulers could see from the revenues accruing to surrounding countries such as Iran, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia remained elusive. The first bore holes in Abu Dhabi were drilled by IPC's operating company, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC) at Ras Sadr in 1950, with a {{convert|13000|ft|m|abbr=off|adj=mid|-deep}} bore hole taking a year to drill and turning out dry, at the tremendous cost at the time of \u00a31 million.\n\n[[File:Mid-20th century Dubai.JPG|thumb|left|Dubai in 1950; the area in this photo shows [[Bur Dubai]] in the foreground (centered on Al-Fahidi Fort); [[Deira, Dubai|Deira]] in middle-right on the other side of the creek; and [[Al Shindagha]] (left) and [[Al Ras, Dubai|Al Ras]] (right) in the background across the creek again from Deira]]\nThe British set up a development office that helped in some small developments in the emirates. The seven [[sheikhs]] of the emirates then decided to form a council to coordinate matters between them and took over the development office.

BP joined with [[Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise des P\u00e9troles]] (later [[Total S.A.|Total]]) to form operating companies, Abu Dhabi Marine Areas Ltd (ADMA) and Dubai Marine Areas Ltd (DUMA).

This was the first commercial discovery of the Trucial Coast, leading to the first exports of oil in 1962.

Nowadays the UAE is one of the world's richest countries, with GDP per capita almost 80% higher than OECD average.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAs impressive as economic growth has been in the UAE, the total population has increased from just around 550,000 in 1975 to close to 10 million in 2018. This growth is mainly due to the influx of foreign workers into the country, making the national population a minority. The UAE features a unique labour market system, in which residence in the UAE is conditional on stringent visa rules. This system is a major advantage in terms of macroeconomic stability, as labour supply adjusts quickly to demand throughout economic business cycles. This allows the Government to keep unemployment in the country on a very low level of less than 3%, and it also gives the Government more leeway in terms of macroeconomic policies \u2013 where other governments often need to make trade-offs between fighting unemployment and fighting inflation.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBetween 2014 and 2018, the accommodation and food, education, information and communication, arts and recreation, and real estate sectors overperformed in terms of growth, whereas the construction, logistics, professional services, public, and oil and gas sectors underperformed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Business and finance===\n[[File:Abu dhabi skylines 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Abu Dhabi skyline]]\nThe UAE offers businesses a strong enabling environment: stable political and macroeconomic conditions, a future-oriented Government, good general infrastructure and ICT infrastructure.

This policy makes sense in the current situation of global and regional economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Also considering the fact that exports have become the main driver of the UAE's economic growth (the contribution of international trade to GDP grew from 31% in 2017 to 33.5% in 2018, outpacing overall GDP growth for the period), and the fact that the AED is currently undervalued, a departure from this policy \u2013 and particularly the peg \u2013 would negatively affect this important part of the UAE economy in the short term. In the mid- to long term, however, the peg will become less important, as the UAE transitions to a knowledge-based economy \u2013 and becomes yet more independent from the oil and gas sector (oil is currently still being traded not in AED, but in USD). On the contrary, it will become more and more important for the Government to have monetary policy at its free disposal to target inflation, shun too heavy reliance on taxes, and avoid situations where decisions on exchange rates and interest rates contradict fiscal policy measures \u2013 as has been the case in recent years, where monetary policy has limited fiscal policy effects on economic expansion.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAccording to [[Fitch Ratings]], the decline in property sector follows risks of progressively worsening the quality of assets in possession with UAE banks, leading the economy to rougher times ahead. Even though as compared to retail and property, UAE banks fared well. The higher US interest rates followed since 2016 - which the UAE currency complies to - have boosted profitability. However, the likelihood of plunging interest rates and increasing provisioning costs on bad loans, point to difficult times ahead for the [[economy]].<ref>{{cite_web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3d537bae-cf30-11e9-b018-ca4456540ea6|title= UAE banks prepare for rough ride ahead|accessdate=18 October 2019|website=Financial Times}}</ref>\n\nSince 2015, economic growth has been more mixed due to a number of factors impacting both demand and supply. In 2017 and 2018 growth has been positive but on a low level of 0.8 and 1.4%, respectively. To support the economy the Government is currently following an expansionary fiscal policy. However, the effects of this policy are partially offset by monetary policy, which has been contractionary. If not for the fiscal stimulus in 2018, the UAE economy would probably have contracted in that year. One of the factors responsible for slower growth has been a credit crunch, which is due to, among other factors, higher interest rates. Government debt has remained on a low level, despite high deficits in a few recent years. Risks related to government debt remain low. Inflation has been picking up in 2017 and 18. Contributing factors were the introduction of a value added tax (VAT) of 5% in 2018 as well as higher commodity prices. Despite the Government's expansionary fiscal policy and a growing economy in 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, prices have been dropping in late 2018 and 2019 owing to oversupply in some sectors of importance to consumer prices.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Oil and gas===\nThe UAE leadership has driven forward economic diversification efforts already before the oil price crash in the 1980s, and the UAE is nowadays the most diversified economy in the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]] (MENA) region. Although the oil and gas sector does still play an important role in the UAE economy, these efforts have paid off in terms of great resilience during periods of oil price fluctuations and economic turbulence. In 2018, the oil and gas sector contributed 26% to overall GDP. The introduction of the [[Value-added tax|VAT]] has provided the Government with an additional source of income \u2013 approximately 6% of the total revenue in 2018, or 27 billion [[United Arab Emirates dirham|United Arab Emirates Dirham]] (AED) \u2013 affording its fiscal policy more independence from oil- and gas-related revenue, which constitutes about 36% of the total Government revenue. While the Government may still adjust the exact arrangement of the VAT, it is not likely that any new taxes will be introduced in the foreseeable future. Additional taxes would destroy one of the UAE's main enticements for businesses to operate in the country and put a heavy burden on the economy.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:Dubai Marina Beach Panorama.jpg|thumb|[[Dubai Marina]] Beach]]\n\nTourism acts as a growth sector for the entire UAE economy.

The strategy focuses on unifying\nhealthcare policy and improving access to healthcare services at reasonable cost, at the same time reducing dependence on overseas treatment. The ministry plans to add three hospitals to the current 14, and 29 primary healthcare centres to the current 86. Nine were scheduled to open in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uae.gov.ae/Government/health.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612101330/http://www.uae.gov.ae/Government/health.htm|archivedate=12 June 2008 |title=UAE Health |publisher=Uae.gov.ae }}</ref>\n\nThe introduction of mandatory [[health insurance]] in Abu Dhabi for [[expatriate]]s and their dependants was a major driver in reform of healthcare policy.

Burial sites dating back to the [[Neolithic Age]] and the [[Bronze Age]] include the oldest known such inland site at [[Jebel Al-Buhais|Jebel Buhais]]. Known as [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]] to the [[Sumer]]ians, the area was home to a prosperous Bronze Age trading culture during the [[Umm al-Nar culture|Umm Al Nar period]], which traded between the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley]], [[Dilmun|Bahrain]] and [[Mesopotamia]] as well as [[Iran]], [[Bactria]] and the [[Levant]]. The ensuing [[Wadi Suq culture|Wadi Suq period]] and three [[Iron Age in the United Arab Emirates|Iron Ages]] saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior. The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]] and the subsequent [[Battle of Dibba]]. The UAE's long history of trade led to the emergence of [[Julfar]], in the present-day emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, as a major regional trading and maritime hub in the area. The maritime dominance of the Persian Gulf by Emirati traders led to conflicts with European powers, including the [[Portuguese Empire]] and the [[British Empire]].\n\nFollowing decades of maritime conflict, the coastal emirates became known as the [[Trucial States]] with the signing of a Perpetual Treaty of Maritime Peace with the British in 1819 (ratified in 1853 and again in 1892), which established the Trucial States as a British [[Protectorate]].

Aware of the potential for the development of natural resources such as oil, following finds in Persia (from 1908) and Mesopotamia (from 1927), a British-led oil company, the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC), showed an interest in the region. The [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (APOC, later to become British Petroleum, or BP) had a 23.75% share in IPC. From 1935, onshore concessions to explore for oil were granted by local rulers, with APOC signing the first one on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd (PCL), an associate company of IPC.<ref>{{Cite book|title = From Pearls to Oil|last = Heard|first = David|work= Motivate|year = 2013|isbn = 9781860633119|location = UAE|pages = 41\u201342}}</ref> APOC was prevented from developing the region alone because of the restrictions of the [[Red Line Agreement]], which required it to operate through IPC. A number of options between PCL and the trucial rulers were signed, providing useful revenue for communities experiencing poverty following the collapse of the pearl trade. However, the wealth of oil which the rulers could see from the revenues accruing to surrounding countries such as Iran, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia remained elusive. The first bore holes in Abu Dhabi were drilled by IPC's operating company, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC) at Ras Sadr in 1950, with a {{convert|13000|ft|m|abbr=off|adj=mid|-deep}} bore hole taking a year to drill and turning out dry, at the tremendous cost at the time of \u00a31 million.\n\n[[File:Mid-20th century Dubai.JPG|thumb|left|Dubai in 1950; the area in this photo shows [[Bur Dubai]] in the foreground (centered on Al-Fahidi Fort); [[Deira, Dubai|Deira]] in middle-right on the other side of the creek; and [[Al Shindagha]] (left) and [[Al Ras, Dubai|Al Ras]] (right) in the background across the creek again from Deira]]\nThe British set up a development office that helped in some small developments in the emirates.

Most of the coast consists of [[Salt pan (geology)|salt pans]] that extend far inland. The largest [[harbor|natural harbor]] is at Dubai, although other ports have been dredged at Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and elsewhere. Numerous islands are found in the Persian Gulf, and the ownership of some of them has been the subject of international disputes with both Iran and Qatar. The smaller islands, as well as many [[coral reef]]s and shifting sandbars, are a menace to navigation. Strong tides and occasional windstorms further complicate ship movements near the shore. The UAE also has a stretch of the [[Al Batinah Region|Al B\u0101\u0163inah]] coast of the Gulf of Oman, although the [[Musandam Governorate|Musandam Peninsula]], the very tip of Arabia by the Strait of Hormuz, is an [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] of Oman separated by the UAE.\n\nSouth and west of Abu Dhabi, vast, rolling [[dune|sand dunes]] merge into the Rub al-Khali (Empty Quarter) of Saudi Arabia.

In general, the rulers of the emirates accepted the British intervention, but in the case of boundary disputes between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and also between Dubai and Sharjah, conflicting claims were not resolved until after the UAE became independent.

This growth is mainly due to the influx of foreign workers into the country, making the national population a minority. The UAE features a unique labour market system, in which residence in the UAE is conditional on stringent visa rules. This system is a major advantage in terms of macroeconomic stability, as labour supply adjusts quickly to demand throughout economic business cycles. This allows the Government to keep unemployment in the country on a very low level of less than 3%, and it also gives the Government more leeway in terms of macroeconomic policies \u2013 where other governments often need to make trade-offs between fighting unemployment and fighting inflation.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBetween 2014 and 2018, the accommodation and food, education, information and communication, arts and recreation, and real estate sectors overperformed in terms of growth, whereas the construction, logistics, professional services, public, and oil and gas sectors underperformed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Business and finance===\n[[File:Abu dhabi skylines 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Abu Dhabi skyline]]\nThe UAE offers businesses a strong enabling environment: stable political and macroeconomic conditions, a future-oriented Government, good general infrastructure and ICT infrastructure.

This policy makes sense in the current situation of global and regional economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Also considering the fact that exports have become the main driver of the UAE's economic growth (the contribution of international trade to GDP grew from 31% in 2017 to 33.5% in 2018, outpacing overall GDP growth for the period), and the fact that the AED is currently undervalued, a departure from this policy \u2013 and particularly the peg \u2013 would negatively affect this important part of the UAE economy in the short term. In the mid- to long term, however, the peg will become less important, as the UAE transitions to a knowledge-based economy \u2013 and becomes yet more independent from the oil and gas sector (oil is currently still being traded not in AED, but in USD). On the contrary, it will become more and more important for the Government to have monetary policy at its free disposal to target inflation, shun too heavy reliance on taxes, and avoid situations where decisions on exchange rates and interest rates contradict fiscal policy measures \u2013 as has been the case in recent years, where monetary policy has limited fiscal policy effects on economic expansion.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAccording to [[Fitch Ratings]], the decline in property sector follows risks of progressively worsening the quality of assets in possession with UAE banks, leading the economy to rougher times ahead. Even though as compared to retail and property, UAE banks fared well. The higher US interest rates followed since 2016 - which the UAE currency complies to - have boosted profitability. However, the likelihood of plunging interest rates and increasing provisioning costs on bad loans, point to difficult times ahead for the [[economy]].<ref>{{cite_web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3d537bae-cf30-11e9-b018-ca4456540ea6|title= UAE banks prepare for rough ride ahead|accessdate=18 October 2019|website=Financial Times}}</ref>\n\nSince 2015, economic growth has been more mixed due to a number of factors impacting both demand and supply. In 2017 and 2018 growth has been positive but on a low level of 0.8 and 1.4%, respectively. To support the economy the Government is currently following an expansionary fiscal policy. However, the effects of this policy are partially offset by monetary policy, which has been contractionary. If not for the fiscal stimulus in 2018, the UAE economy would probably have contracted in that year. One of the factors responsible for slower growth has been a credit crunch, which is due to, among other factors, higher interest rates. Government debt has remained on a low level, despite high deficits in a few recent years. Risks related to government debt remain low. Inflation has been picking up in 2017 and 18. Contributing factors were the introduction of a value added tax (VAT) of 5% in 2018 as well as higher commodity prices. Despite the Government's expansionary fiscal policy and a growing economy in 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, prices have been dropping in late 2018 and 2019 owing to oversupply in some sectors of importance to consumer prices.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Oil and gas===\nThe UAE leadership has driven forward economic diversification efforts already before the oil price crash in the 1980s, and the UAE is nowadays the most diversified economy in the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]] (MENA) region. Although the oil and gas sector does still play an important role in the UAE economy, these efforts have paid off in terms of great resilience during periods of oil price fluctuations and economic turbulence. In 2018, the oil and gas sector contributed 26% to overall GDP. The introduction of the [[Value-added tax|VAT]] has provided the Government with an additional source of income \u2013 approximately 6% of the total revenue in 2018, or 27 billion [[United Arab Emirates dirham|United Arab Emirates Dirham]] (AED) \u2013 affording its fiscal policy more independence from oil- and gas-related revenue, which constitutes about 36% of the total Government revenue. While the Government may still adjust the exact arrangement of the VAT, it is not likely that any new taxes will be introduced in the foreseeable future. Additional taxes would destroy one of the UAE's main enticements for businesses to operate in the country and put a heavy burden on the economy.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:Dubai Marina Beach Panorama.jpg|thumb|[[Dubai Marina]] Beach]]\n\nTourism acts as a growth sector for the entire UAE economy.
