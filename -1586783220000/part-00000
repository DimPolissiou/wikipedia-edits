One of his most successful innovations was a new type of self-bailer. The design is still in production under the Andersen brand and has been widely copied. The new features were a wedge shaped venturi that closes automatically if the boat grounds or hits an obstruction, and a flap that acts as a non return valve to minimise water coming in if the boat is stationary or moving too slowly for the device to work. Previous automatic bailers would be damaged or destroyed if they met an obstruction, and would let considerable amounts of water in if the boat was moving too slowly.\n\nElvstr\u00f8m was a very early innovator in training techniques. For example, he used the technique of 'sitting out' or [[hiking (sailing)|hiking]] using [[toe-straps]] to a greater degree than previously, getting all his body weight from the knees upwards outside the boat, thus providing extra leverage to enable the boat to remain level in stronger winds and hence go faster than his competitors. This technique required great strength and fitness, so Elvstr\u00f8m built a training bench with toe-straps in his garage to replicate the sitting-out position in his dinghy. He then proceeded to spend many training hours on dry land sitting out on the bench at home.\n\nHe also popularised the [[kicking strap]], or boom vang (US). This may take the form of a [[block and tackle]] linking a low point on the [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] (or an equivalent point on the hull) and the [[Boom (sailing)|boom]] close to the mast, which allows the boom to be let out when [[reaching (sailing)|reaching]] or [[running (sailing)|running]] without lifting. This controls the twist of the [[mainsail]] from its foot to its head, increasing the sail's power and the boat's speed and controlability. Elvstr\u00f8m did not advertise his new invention, leaving his competitors mystified at his superior boat-speed. Investigation of his dinghy revealed nothing as he used to remove the kicking strap before coming ashore.\n\nHe established a manufacturing company whose products included masts, booms, and sails. He has also been instrumental in developing several international yacht racing rules.\n\nAmong the innovative concepts he brought to sailboat racing was the concept of gates instead of a single windward or leeward mark in large regattas. The leeward gate on a windward-leeward course is commonly used. The windward gate is less often used due to the difficulties in managing right-of-way around the right gate, the subtleties of which are understood mostly by match racers.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/archived_Detail.asp?key=3866 |title = Scuttlebutt: Archived Newsletters |accessdate = 2008-08-13}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Elvstr\u00f8m was chosen as \"Danish Sportsman of the Century.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Albrechtsen|first1=Karin|last2=Leksikon|first2=Gyldendal|title=Paul Elvstr\u00f8m |url=http://denmark.dk/en/meet-the-danes/great-danes/athletes/paul-elvstroem|website=Denmark.dk |accessdate=16 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Elvstr\u00f8m was among the first six inductees into the [[ISAF Sailing Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.sailing.org/halloffame/21227.php |title = ISAF Hall of Fame : Paul Elvstr\u00f6m |accessdate = 2008-08-13 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080917154021/http://www.sailing.org/halloffame/21227.php |archivedate = 17 September 2008 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> He died on 7 December 2016 at the age of 88,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Jens|title=Paul Elvstr\u00f8m er d\u00f8d|url=http://www.dr.dk/sporten/oevrig/paul-elvstroem-er-doed|website=dr.dk|publisher=[[DR (broadcaster)|DR]]|language=Danish|accessdate=7 December 2016}}</ref> after battling [[Alzheimers]] for a few years.\n\n==Achievements==\nElvstr\u00f8m won medals at the world championships: [[Finn (dinghy)|Finn]], [[505 (dinghy)|505]], [[Snipe (dinghy)|Snipe]], [[Flying Dutchman (dinghy)|Flying Dutchman]], [[5.5 Metre (keelboat)|5.5 Metre]], [[Star (sailboat)|Star]], [[Soling]] [[Tornado (sailboat)|Tornado]] and [[Half Ton Cup|Half Ton]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=70% style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

This may take the form of a [[block and tackle]] linking a low point on the [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] (or an equivalent point on the hull) and the [[Boom (sailing)|boom]] close to the mast, which allows the boom to be let out when [[reaching (sailing)|reaching]] or [[running (sailing)|running]] without lifting. This controls the twist of the [[mainsail]] from its foot to its head, increasing the sail's power and the boat's speed and controlability. Elvstr\u00f8m did not advertise his new invention, leaving his competitors mystified at his superior boat-speed. Investigation of his dinghy revealed nothing as he used to remove the kicking strap before coming ashore.\n\nHe established a manufacturing company whose products included masts, booms, and sails. He has also been instrumental in developing several international yacht racing rules.\n\nAmong the innovative concepts he brought to sailboat racing was the concept of gates instead of a single windward or leeward mark in large regattas. The leeward gate on a windward-leeward course is commonly used. The windward gate is less often used due to the difficulties in managing right-of-way around the right gate, the subtleties of which are understood mostly by match racers.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.sailingscuttlebutt.com/archived_Detail.asp?key=3866 |title = Scuttlebutt: Archived Newsletters |accessdate = 2008-08-13}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Elvstr\u00f8m was chosen as \"Danish Sportsman of the Century.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Albrechtsen|first1=Karin|last2=Leksikon|first2=Gyldendal|title=Paul Elvstr\u00f8m |url=http://denmark.dk/en/meet-the-danes/great-danes/athletes/paul-elvstroem|website=Denmark.dk |accessdate=16 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Elvstr\u00f8m was among the first six inductees into the [[ISAF Sailing Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.sailing.org/halloffame/21227.php |title = ISAF Hall of Fame : Paul Elvstr\u00f6m |accessdate = 2008-08-13 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080917154021/http://www.sailing.org/halloffame/21227.php |archivedate = 17 September 2008 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> He died on 7 December 2016 at the age of 88,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Jens|title=Paul Elvstr\u00f8m er d\u00f8d|url=http://www.dr.dk/sporten/oevrig/paul-elvstroem-er-doed|website=dr.dk|publisher=[[DR (broadcaster)|DR]]|language=Danish|accessdate=7 December 2016}}</ref> after battling [[Alzheimers]] for a few years.\n\n==Achievements==\nElvstr\u00f8m won medals at the world championships: [[Finn (dinghy)|Finn]], [[505 (dinghy)|505]], [[Snipe (dinghy)|Snipe]], [[Flying Dutchman (dinghy)|Flying Dutchman]], [[5.5 Metre (keelboat)|5.5 Metre]], [[Star (sailboat)|Star]], [[Soling]] [[Tornado (sailboat)|Tornado]] and [[Half Ton Cup|Half Ton]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=70% style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Catholic High School League", "text_new": "The '''Catholic High School League''' (CHSL) is a school athletic conference based in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], led by director Victor Michaels. All member schools are also members of the [[Michigan High School Athletic Association]] (MHSAA), the governing body for Michigan scholastic sports. Unlike many similar leagues, the CHSL governs secondary, middle, and elementary sports for most of the parochial schools in the Detroit area. Most league schools are Catholic, but there are other religious denominations as well. Every school in the CHSL is a [[private school]]. In 2019, the CHSL council voted to rename the AB/ Division I/II championship to the Bishop division championship, and the CD/ Division III/IV championship to the Cardinal Division championship.{{CN|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Member schools==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! colspan=8|Catholic High School League\n|-\n!

All member schools are also members of the [[Michigan High School Athletic Association]] (MHSAA), the governing body for Michigan scholastic sports. Unlike many similar leagues, the CHSL governs secondary, middle, and elementary sports for most of the parochial schools in the Detroit area. Most league schools are Catholic, but there are other religious denominations as well. Every school in the CHSL is a [[private school]]. In 2019, the CHSL council voted to rename the AB/ Division I/II championship to the Bishop division championship, and the CD/ Division III/IV championship to the Cardinal Division championship.{{CN|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Member schools==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! colspan=8|Catholic High School League\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Determinant", "text_new": "{{about|determinants in mathematics|determinants in epidemiology|Risk factor|determinants in immunology|Epitope}}\nIn [[linear algebra]], the '''determinant''' is a scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a [[square matrix]] and encodes certain properties of the [[Linear map|linear transformation]] described by the matrix.  The determinant of a matrix {{math|''A''}} is denoted {{math|det(''A'')}}, {{math|det ''A''}}, or {{math|{{abs|''A''}}}}. Geometrically, it can be viewed as the [[volume]] scaling factor of the linear transformation described by the matrix. This is also the signed volume of the ''n''-dimensional [[parallelepiped]] spanned by the column or row vectors of the matrix. The determinant is positive or negative according to whether the linear mapping preserves or reverses the orientation of ''n''-space.\n\nIn the case of a {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} matrix the determinant may be defined as\n:<math>\\begin{align}|A| = \\begin{vmatrix} a & b\\\\c & d \\end{vmatrix}=ad - bc .\\end{align}</math>\n\nSimilarly, for a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix ''A'', its determinant is\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  |A| = \\begin{vmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{vmatrix}\n     &= a\\,\\begin{vmatrix} \\Box & \\Box & \\Box \\\\ \\Box & e & f \\\\ \\Box & h & i \\end{vmatrix} - \n        b\\,\\begin{vmatrix} \\Box & \\Box & \\Box \\\\ d & \\Box & f \\\\ g & \\Box & i \\end{vmatrix} + \n        c\\,\\begin{vmatrix} \\Box & \\Box & \\Box \\\\ d & e & \\Box \\\\ g & h & \\Box \\end{vmatrix} \\\\[3pt]\n     &= a\\,\\begin{vmatrix} e & f \\\\ h & i \\end{vmatrix} - \n        b\\,\\begin{vmatrix} d & f \\\\ g & i \\end{vmatrix} + \n        c\\,\\begin{vmatrix} d & e \\\\ g & h \\end{vmatrix} \\\\[3pt]\n     &= aei + bfg + cdh - ceg - bdi - afh.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nEach determinant of a {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} matrix in this equation is called a [[minor (linear algebra)|minor]] of the matrix {{math|''A''}}.  This procedure can be extended to give a recursive definition for the determinant of an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix, the ''[[Laplace expansion|minor expansion formula]]''.\n\nDeterminants occur throughout mathematics. For example, a matrix is often used to represent the [[coefficient]]s in a [[system of linear equations]], and the determinant can be used to [[Cramer's rule|solve]] those equations, although other methods of solution are much more computationally efficient. In linear algebra, a matrix (with entries in a [[Field (mathematics)|field]]) is singular (not [[Inverse matrix|invertible]]) [[if and only if]] its determinant is zero. This leads to the use of determinants in defining the [[characteristic polynomial]] of a matrix, whose roots are the [[eigenvalue]]s. In [[analytic geometry]], determinants express the signed ''n''-dimensional volumes of ''n''-dimensional parallelepipeds. This leads to the use of determinants in [[calculus]], the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian determinant]] in the [[Integration_by_substitution#Substitution_for_multiple_variables|change of variables rule]] for integrals of functions of several variables. Determinants appear frequently in algebraic identities such as the [[Vandermonde identity]].\n\nDeterminants possess many algebraic properties. One of them is multiplicativity, namely that the determinant of a [[matrix multiplication|product of matrices]] is equal to the product of determinants. Special types of matrices have special determinants; for example, the determinant of an [[orthogonal matrix]] is always plus or minus one, and the determinant of a complex [[Hermitian matrix]] is always [[real number|real]].\n\n==Geometric meaning==\nIf an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} [[Real number|real]] matrix ''A'' is written in terms of its column vectors <math>A = [\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c} \\mathbf{a}_1 & \\mathbf{a}_2 & \\cdots & \\mathbf{a}_n\\end{array}]</math> then \n:<math>\n  A\\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\\\ \\vdots \\\\0\\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a}_1, \\quad\n  A\\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\\\ \\vdots \\\\0\\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a}_2, \\quad\n                                                         \\ldots, \\quad\n  A\\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\1\\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a}_n. \n</math>\n\nThis means that <math>A</math> maps the unit [[Hypercube|''n''-cube]] to the ''n''-dimensional [[parallelepiped#Parallelotope|parallelotope]] defined by the vectors <math>\\mathbf{a}_1, \\mathbf{a}_2, \\ldots,  \\mathbf{a}_n,</math> the region <math>P = \\left\\{c_1 \\mathbf{a}_1 + \\cdots + c_n\\mathbf{a}_n \\mid 0 \\leq c_i\\leq 1 \\ \\forall i\\right\\}.</math>\n\nThe determinant gives the [[orientation (vector space)|signed]] ''n''-dimensional volume of this parallelotope, <math>\\det(A) = \\pm \\text{vol}(P),</math> and hence describes more generally the ''n''-dimensional volume scaling factor of the [[linear transformation]] produced by ''A''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://textbooks.math.gatech.edu/ila/determinants-volumes.html|title=Determinants and Volumes|author=|date=|website=textbooks.math.gatech.edu|accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref> (The sign shows whether the transformation preserves or reverses [[Orientation (vector space)|orientation]].) In particular, if the determinant is zero, then this parallelotope has volume zero and is not fully ''n''-dimensional, which indicates that the dimension of the image of ''A'' is less than ''n''. This [[Rank\u2013nullity theorem|means]] that ''A'' produces a linear transformation which is neither [[surjective function|onto]] nor [[Injective function|one-to-one]], and so is not invertible.\n\n== Definition ==\nThere are various equivalent ways to define the determinant of a [[square matrix]] ''A'', i.e. one with the same number of rows and columns.  Perhaps the simplest way to express the determinant is by considering the elements in the top row and the respective [[minor (linear algebra)|minors]]; starting at the left, multiply the element by the minor, then subtract the product of the next element and its minor, and alternate adding and subtracting such products until all elements in the top row have been exhausted.  For example, here is the result for a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix:\n:<math>\n  \\begin{vmatrix} a & b & c & d\\\\ e & f & g & h\\\\ i & j & k & l\\\\ m & n & o & p \\end{vmatrix} =\n  a\\,\\begin{vmatrix} f & g & h\\\\ j & k & l\\\\ n & o & p \\end{vmatrix} -\n    b\\,\\begin{vmatrix} e & g & h\\\\ i & k & l\\\\ m & o & p \\end{vmatrix} +\n    c\\,\\begin{vmatrix} e & f & h\\\\ i & j & l\\\\ m & n & p \\end{vmatrix} -\n    d\\,\\begin{vmatrix} e & f & g\\\\ i & j & k\\\\ m & n & o \\end{vmatrix}.\n</math>\nAnother way to define the determinant is expressed in terms of the columns of the matrix.  If we write an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix ''A'' in terms of its column vectors\n: <math>A = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & a_2 & \\cdots & a_n \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nwhere the <math>a_j</math> are vectors of size ''n'', then the determinant of ''A'' is defined so that\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\det \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & \\cdots & b a_j + c v & \\cdots & a_n \\end{bmatrix}\n          &= b\\det(A) + c \\det \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & \\cdots & v & \\cdots & a_n \\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n  \\det \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & \\cdots & a_j & a_{j+1} & \\cdots & a_n \\end{bmatrix}\n          &= -\\det \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & \\cdots & a_{j+1} & a_j & \\cdots & a_n \\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n  \\det(I) &= 1\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere ''b'' and ''c'' are scalars, ''v'' is any vector of size ''n'' and ''I'' is the [[identity matrix]] of size ''n''.  These equations say that the determinant is a linear function of each column, that interchanging adjacent columns reverses the sign of the determinant, and that the determinant of the identity matrix is 1. These properties mean that the determinant is an alternating multilinear function of the columns that maps the identity matrix to the underlying unit scalar.  These suffice to uniquely calculate the determinant of any square matrix. Provided the underlying scalars form a field (more generally, a commutative ring with unity), the definition below shows that such a function exists, and it can be shown to be unique.<ref>[[Serge Lang]], ''Linear Algebra'', 2nd Edition, Addison-Wesley, 1971, pp 173, 191.</ref>\n\nEquivalently, the determinant can be expressed as a sum of products of entries of the matrix where each product has ''n'' terms and the coefficient of each product is \u22121 or 1 or 0 according to a given rule: it is a [[polynomial expression]] of the matrix entries. This expression grows rapidly with the size of the matrix (an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix contributes [[Factorial|''n''!]] terms), so it will first be given explicitly for the case of {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} matrices and {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrices, followed by the rule for arbitrary size matrices, which subsumes these two cases.\n\nAssume ''A'' is a square matrix with ''n'' rows and ''n'' columns, so that it can be written as\n:<math>A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} &  \\dots & a_{1,n} \\\\\n  a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} &  \\dots & a_{2,n} \\\\\n   \\vdots &  \\vdots & \\ddots &  \\vdots \\\\\n  a_{n,1} & a_{n,2} &  \\dots & a_{n,n}\n\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe entries can be numbers or expressions (as happens when the determinant is used to define a [[characteristic polynomial]]); the definition of the determinant depends only on the fact that they can be added and multiplied together in a [[Commutativity|commutative]] manner.\n\nThe determinant of ''A'' is denoted by det(''A''), or it can be denoted directly in terms of the matrix entries by writing enclosing bars instead of brackets:\n:<math>\\begin{vmatrix}\n  a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} &  \\dots & a_{1,n} \\\\\n  a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} &  \\dots & a_{2,n} \\\\\n   \\vdots &  \\vdots & \\ddots &  \\vdots \\\\\n  a_{n,1} & a_{n,2} &  \\dots & a_{n,n}\n\\end{vmatrix}.</math>\n\n=== 2 \u00d7 2 matrices ===\n[[File:Area parallellogram as determinant.svg|thumb|right|The area of the parallelogram is the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix formed by the vectors representing the parallelogram's sides.]]\nThe [[Leibniz formula for determinants|Leibniz formula]] for the determinant of a {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} matrix is\n:<math>\\begin{vmatrix} a & b \\\\c & d \\end{vmatrix} = ad - bc.</math>\n\nIf the matrix entries are real numbers, the matrix ''A'' can be used to represent two [[linear map]]s:  one that maps the [[standard basis]] vectors to the rows of ''A'', and one that maps them to the columns of ''A''.  In either case, the images of the basis vectors form a [[parallelogram]] that represents the image of the [[unit square]] under the mapping.  The parallelogram defined by the rows of the above matrix is the one with vertices at {{nowrap|(0, 0)}}, {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}}, {{nowrap|(''a'' + ''c'', ''b'' + ''d'')}}, and {{nowrap|(''c'', ''d'')}}, as shown in the accompanying diagram.\n\nThe absolute value of {{nowrap|''ad'' \u2212 ''bc''}} is the area of the parallelogram, and thus represents the scale factor by which areas are transformed by ''A''. (The parallelogram formed by the columns of ''A'' is in general a different parallelogram, but since the determinant is symmetric with respect to rows and columns, the area will be the same.)\n\nThe absolute value of the determinant together with the sign becomes the ''oriented area'' of the parallelogram. The oriented area is the same as the usual [[area (geometry)|area]], except that it is negative when the angle from the first to the second vector defining the parallelogram turns in a clockwise direction (which is opposite to the direction one would get for the [[identity matrix]]).\n\nTo show that {{nowrap|''ad'' \u2212 ''bc''}} is the signed area, one may consider a matrix containing two vectors {{nowrap|1='''a''' = (''a'', ''b'')}} and {{nowrap|1='''b''' = (''c'', ''d'')}} representing the parallelogram's sides. The signed area can be expressed as {{nowrap|{{!}}'''a'''{{!}}{{!}}'''b'''{{!}}sin''\u03b8''}} for the angle ''\u03b8'' between the vectors, which is simply base times height, the length of one vector times the perpendicular component of the other. Due to the [[sine]] this already is the signed area, yet it may be expressed more conveniently using the [[cosine]] of the complementary angle to a perpendicular vector, e.g. {{nowrap|1='''a'''<sup>\u22a5</sup> = (\u2212''b'', ''a'')}}, so that {{nowrap|{{!}}'''a'''<sup>\u22a5</sup>{{!}}{{!}}'''b'''{{!}}cos''\u03b8' ''}}, which can be determined by the pattern of the [[scalar product]] to be equal to {{nowrap|''ad'' \u2212 ''bc''}}:\n\n: <math>\\text{Signed area} =\n  |\\boldsymbol{a}| |\\boldsymbol{b}|\\sin\\theta = \\left|\\boldsymbol{a}^\\perp\\right| |\\boldsymbol{b}|\\cos\\theta' =\n  \\begin{pmatrix} -b \\\\ a \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} c \\\\ d \\end{pmatrix} = ad - bc.\n</math>\n\nThus the determinant gives the scaling factor and the orientation induced by the mapping represented by ''A''. When the determinant is equal to one, the linear mapping defined by the matrix is [[Equiareal map|equi-areal]] and orientation-preserving.\n\nThe object known as the ''[[bivector]]'' is related to these ideas.

The value in the ''i''th position after the reordering ''\u03c3'' is denoted by ''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>. For example, for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}}, the original sequence 1, 2, 3 might be reordered to {{nowrap|1=''\u03c3'' = [2, 3, 1]}}, with {{nowrap|1=''\u03c3''<sub>1</sub> = 2}}, {{nowrap|1=''\u03c3''<sub>2</sub> = 3}}, and {{nowrap|1=''\u03c3''<sub>3</sub> = 1}}.  The set of all such permutations (also known as the [[symmetric group]] on ''n'' elements) is denoted by S<sub>''n''</sub>. For each permutation ''\u03c3'', sgn(''\u03c3'') denotes the [[signature (permutation)|signature]] of ''\u03c3'', a value that is +1 whenever the reordering given by \u03c3 can be achieved by successively interchanging two entries an even number of times, and \u22121 whenever it can be achieved by an odd number of such interchanges.\n\nIn any of the <math>n!</math> summands, the term\n\n:<math>\\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i, \\sigma_i}</math>\n\nis notation for the product of the entries at positions {{nowrap|(''i'', \u03c3<sub>''i''</sub>)}}, where ''i'' ranges from 1 to ''n'':\n\n:<math>a_{1,\\sigma_1} \\cdot a_{2,\\sigma_2} \\cdots  a_{n,\\sigma_n}.</math>\n\nFor example, the determinant of a {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix ''A'' ({{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}}) is\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n      &\\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\sgn(\\sigma) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,\\sigma_i} \\\\\n  ={} &\\sgn([1,2,3]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[1,2,3]_i} + \\sgn([1,3,2]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[1,3,2]_i} + \\sgn([2,1,3]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[2,1,3]_i} +{} \\\\\n      &\\sgn([2,3,1]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[2,3,1]_i} + \\sgn([3,1,2]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[3,1,2]_i} + \\sgn([3,2,1]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[3,2,1]_i} \\\\\n  ={} &\\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[1,2,3]_i} - \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[1,3,2]_i} - \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[2,1,3]_i} + \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[2,3,1]_i} + \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[3,1,2]_i} - \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[3,2,1]_i} \\\\[2pt]\n  ={} & a_{1,1}a_{2,2}a_{3,3} - a_{1,1}a_{2,3}a_{3,2} - a_{1,2}a_{2,1}a_{3,3} +\n        a_{1,2}a_{2,3}a_{3,1} + a_{1,3}a_{2,1}a_{3,2} - a_{1,3}a_{2,2}a_{3,1}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==== Levi-Civita symbol ====\nIt is sometimes useful to extend the Leibniz formula to a summation in which not only permutations, but all sequences of ''n'' indices in the  range {{nowrap|1, \u2026, ''n''}} occur, ensuring that the contribution of a sequence will be zero unless it denotes a permutation. Thus the totally antisymmetric [[Levi-Civita symbol]] <math>\\varepsilon_{i_1,\\cdots,i_n}</math> extends the signature of a permutation, by setting <math>\\varepsilon_{\\sigma(1),\\cdots,\\sigma(n)} = \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)</math> for any permutation ''\u03c3'' of ''n'', and <math>\\varepsilon_{i_1,\\cdots,i_n} = 0</math> when no permutation ''\u03c3'' exists such that <math>\\sigma(j) = i_j</math> for <math>j=1,\\ldots,n</math> (or equivalently, whenever some pair of indices are equal). The determinant for an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix can then be expressed using an ''n''-fold summation as\n:<math>\\det(A) = \\sum_{i_1,i_2,\\ldots,i_n=1}^n \\varepsilon_{i_1\\cdots i_n} a_{1,i_1} \\cdots a_{n,i_n},</math>\n\nor using two epsilon symbols as\n:<math> \\det(A) = \\frac{1}{n!}\\sum\\varepsilon_{i_1\\cdots i_n} \\varepsilon_{j_1\\cdots j_n} a_{i_1 j_1} \\cdots a_{i_n j_n},</math>\n\nwhere now each ''i<sub>r</sub>'' and each ''j<sub>r</sub>'' should be summed over {{nowrap|1, \u2026, ''n''}}.\n\nHowever, through the use of tensor notation and the suppression of the summation symbol (Einstein's summation convention) we can obtain a much more compact expression of the determinant of the second order system of <math>n=3</math> dimensions, <math>a^m_n</math>;\n\n:<math>\\det(a^m_n)e_{rst} = e_{ijk}a_r^i a_s^j a_t^k</math>\n\nwhere <math>e_{rst}</math> and <math>e_{ijk}</math> represent 'e-systems' that take on the values 0, +1 and \u22121 given the number of permutations of <math>ijk</math> and <math>rst</math>.

This means that if the ''j''th column of a matrix <math>A</math> is written as a sum <math>\\mathbf a_j = \\mathbf v + \\mathbf w</math> of two [[column vector]]s, and all other columns are left unchanged, then the determinant of <math>A</math> is the sum of the determinants of the matrices obtained from <math>A</math> by replacing the ''j''th column by <math>\\mathbf v</math> (denoted <math>A_v</math>) and then by <math>\\mathbf{w}</math> (denoted <math>A_w</math>) (and a similar relation holds when writing a column as a scalar multiple of a column vector).\n#: <math>\\begin{align}\\det(A)\n  &= \\det([\\mathbf{a}_1|\\dots|\\mathbf{a}_j|\\dots|\\mathbf{a}_n]) \\\\\n  &= \\det([\\dots|\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}|\\dots]) \\\\\n  &= \\det([\\dots|\\mathbf{v}|\\dots]) + \\det([\\dots|\\mathbf{w}|\\dots]) \\\\\n  &= \\det\\left(A_v\\right) + \\det\\left(A_w\\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n# <li value=\"9\">If in a matrix, any row or column has all elements equal to zero, then the determinant of that matrix is 0.\n# This ''n''-linear function is an [[alternating form]]. This means that whenever two columns of a matrix are identical, or more generally some column can be expressed as a linear combination of the other columns (i.e. the columns of the matrix form a [[Linearly independent|linearly dependent]] set), its determinant is 0.\n\nProperties 1, 8 and 10 \u2014 which all follow from the Leibniz formula \u2014 completely characterize the determinant; in other words the determinant is the unique function from {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices to scalars that is ''n''-linear alternating in the columns, and takes the value 1 for the identity matrix (this characterization holds even if scalars are taken in any given [[commutative ring]]). To see this it suffices to expand the determinant by multi-linearity in the columns into a (huge) linear combination of determinants of matrices in which each column is a [[standard basis]] vector. These determinants are either 0 (by property&nbsp;9) or else \u00b11 (by properties 1 and&nbsp;12 below), so the linear combination gives the expression above in terms of the Levi-Civita symbol. While less technical in appearance, this characterization cannot entirely replace the Leibniz formula in defining the determinant, since without it the existence of an appropriate function is not clear. For matrices over non-commutative rings, properties 8 and 9 are incompatible for {{nowrap|''n'' \u2265 2}},<ref>In a non-commutative setting left-linearity (compatibility with left-multiplication by scalars) should be distinguished from right-linearity. Assuming linearity in the columns is taken to be left-linearity, one would have, for non-commuting scalars ''a'', ''b'':\n:<math>ab =\n  ab \\begin{vmatrix}1&0 \\\\ 0&1\\end{vmatrix} =\n   a \\begin{vmatrix}1&0 \\\\ 0&b\\end{vmatrix} =\n     \\begin{vmatrix}a&0 \\\\ 0&b\\end{vmatrix} =\n   b \\begin{vmatrix}a&0 \\\\ 0&1\\end{vmatrix} =\n  ba \\begin{vmatrix}1&0 \\\\ 0&1\\end{vmatrix} = ba,\n</math>\n\na contradiction. There is no useful notion of multi-linear functions over a non-commutative ring.</ref> so there is no good definition of the determinant in this setting.\n\nProperty 2 above implies that properties for columns have their counterparts in terms of rows:\n# <li value=\"11\">Viewing an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix as being composed of ''n'' rows, the determinant is an ''n''-linear function.\n# This ''n''-linear function is an alternating form: whenever two rows of a matrix are identical, its determinant is 0.\n# Interchanging any pair of columns or rows of a matrix multiplies its determinant by&nbsp;\u22121. This follows from properties 8 and 10 (it is a general property of multilinear alternating maps). More generally, any permutation of the rows or columns multiplies the determinant by the [[parity of a permutation|sign]] of the permutation. By permutation, it is meant viewing each row as a vector '''R'''<sub>''i''</sub> (equivalently each column as '''C'''<sub>''i''</sub>) and reordering the rows (or columns) by interchange of '''R'''<sub>''j''</sub> and '''R'''<sub>''k''</sub> (or '''C'''<sub>''j''</sub> and '''C'''<sub>''k''</sub>), where ''j'', ''k'' are two indices chosen from 1 to ''n'' for an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} square matrix.\n# Adding a scalar multiple of one column to ''another'' column does not change the value of the determinant. This is a consequence of properties 8 and 10 in the following way: by property&nbsp;8 the determinant changes by a multiple of the determinant of a matrix with two equal columns, which determinant is 0 by property&nbsp;10. Similarly, adding a scalar multiple of one row to another row leaves the determinant unchanged.\n</li>\n\nProperty 5 says that the determinant on {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices is [[Homogeneous function|homogeneous]] of degree ''n''. These properties can be used to facilitate the computation of determinants by simplifying the matrix to the point where the determinant can be determined immediately. Specifically, for matrices with coefficients in a [[field (mathematics)|field]], properties 13 and 14 can be used to transform any matrix into a triangular matrix, whose determinant is given by property&nbsp;7; this is essentially the method of [[Gaussian elimination]].\n\nFor example, the determinant of\n\n:<math>A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -2 & 2 & -3 \\\\\n  -1 & 1 &  3 \\\\\n   2 & 0 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\ncan be computed using the following matrices:\n:<math>\n  B = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    -2 & 2 & -3\\\\\n     0 & 0 &  4.5\\\\\n     2 & 0 & -1\n  \\end{bmatrix},\\quad\n  C = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    -2 & 2 & -3\\\\\n     0 & 0 &  4.5\\\\\n     0 & 2 & -4\n  \\end{bmatrix},\\quad\n  D = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    -2 & 2 & -3\\\\\n     0 & 2 & -4\\\\\n     0 & 0 &  4.5\n  \\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nHere, ''B'' is obtained from ''A'' by adding \u22121/2\u00d7the first row to the second, so that {{nowrap|1=det(''A'') = det(''B'')}}. ''C'' is obtained from ''B'' by adding the first to the third row, so that {{nowrap|1=det(''C'') = det(''B'')}}. Finally, ''D'' is obtained from ''C'' by exchanging the second and third row, so that {{nowrap|1=det(''D'') = \u2212det(''C'')}}. The determinant of the (upper) triangular matrix ''D'' is the product of its entries on the [[main diagonal]]: {{nowrap|1=(\u22122) \u00b7 2 \u00b7 4.5 = \u221218}}. Therefore, {{nowrap|1=det(''A'') = \u2212det(''D'') = +18}}.\n\n=== Schur complement ===\nThe following identity holds for a [[Schur complement]] of a square [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]:\n\nThe Schur complement arises as the result of performing a block [[Gaussian elimination]] by multiplying the matrix ''M'' from the right with a ''block lower triangular'' matrix\n:<math>L = \\begin{bmatrix} I_p & 0 \\\\ -D^{-1}C & I_q \\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nHere ''I''<sub>''p''</sub> denotes the ''p''&#xD7;''p'' [[identity matrix]]. After multiplication with the matrix ''L'', the Schur complement appears in the upper ''p''&#xD7;''p'' block. The product matrix is\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  ML &= \\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} I_p & 0 \\\\ -D^{-1}C & I_q \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} A - BD^{-1}C & B \\\\ 0 & D \\end{bmatrix} \\\\[5pt]\n     &= \\begin{bmatrix} I_p & BD^{-1} \\\\ 0 & I_q \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} A - BD^{-1}C & 0 \\\\ 0 & D \\end{bmatrix}.\n \\end{align}</math>\n\nThat is, we have effected a Gaussian decomposition\n:<math>\n  \\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{bmatrix} =\n  \\begin{bmatrix} I_p & BD^{-1} \\\\ 0 & I_q \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\begin{bmatrix} A-BD^{-1}C & 0 \\\\ 0 & D \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\begin{bmatrix} I_p & 0 \\\\ D^{-1}C & I_q \\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nThe first and last matrices on the RHS have determinant unity,  so we have\n:<math>\\det\\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{bmatrix} = \\det(D) \\cdot \\det\\left(A - BD^{-1} C\\right).</math>\n\nThis is Schur's determinant identity.\n\n=== Multiplicativity and matrix groups ===\nThe determinant of a [[matrix product]] of square matrices equals the product of their determinants:\n:<math>\\det(AB) = \\det (A) \\times \\det (B)</math>\n\nThus the determinant is a ''multiplicative map''. This property is a consequence of the characterization given above of the determinant as the unique ''n''-linear alternating function of the columns with value&nbsp;1 on the identity matrix, since the function {{nowrap|M<sub>''n''</sub>(''K'') \u2192 ''K''}} that maps {{nowrap|''M'' \u21a6 det(''AM'')}} can easily be seen to be ''n''-linear and alternating in the columns of ''M'', and takes the value det(''A'') at the identity. The formula can be generalized  to (square) products of rectangular matrices, giving the [[Cauchy\u2013Binet formula]], which also provides an independent proof of the multiplicative property.\n\nThe determinant det(''A'') of a matrix ''A'' is non-zero if and only if ''A'' is invertible or, yet another equivalent statement, if its [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] equals the size of the matrix. If so, the determinant of the inverse matrix is given by\n:<math>\\det\\left(A^{-1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\det(A)} = [\\det(A)]^{-1}</math>\n\nIn particular, products and inverses of matrices with determinant one still have this property. Thus, the set of such matrices (of fixed size ''n'') form a group known as the [[special linear group]]. More generally, the word \"special\" indicates the subgroup of another [[matrix group]] of matrices of determinant one. Examples include the [[special orthogonal group]] (which if ''n'' is 2 or 3 consists of all [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]]), and the [[special unitary group]].\n\n=== Laplace's formula and the adjugate matrix ===\n[[Laplace expansion|Laplace's formula]] expresses the determinant of a matrix in terms of its [[minor (matrix)|minors]]. The minor ''M''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub> is defined to be the determinant of the {{nowrap|(''n''\u22121) \u00d7 (''n''\u22121)}}-matrix that results from ''A'' by removing the ''i''th row and the ''j''th column. The expression {{nowrap|(\u22121)<sup>''i''+''j''</sup> ''M''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub>}} is known as a [[cofactor (linear algebra)|cofactor]]. The determinant of ''A'' is given by\n\n:<math>\\det(A) = \\sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^{i+j} a_{ij} M_{ij}</math> (for a fixed <math>i</math>) <math>= \\sum_{i=1}^n (-1)^{i+j} a_{ij} M_{ij}</math> (for a fixed <math>j</math>)\n\nCalculating det(''A'') by means of this formula is referred to as expanding the determinant along a row, the ''i''th row using the first form with fixed ''i'', or expanding along a column, using the second form with fixed ''j''. For example, the Laplace expansion of the {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix\n:<math>A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n -2 & 2 & -3\\\\\n -1 & 1 &  3\\\\\n  2 & 0 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix},</math>\n\nalong the second column ({{nowrap|1=''j'' = 2}} and the sum runs over ''i'') is given by,\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\det(A) & = (-1)^{1+2}\\cdot 2 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}-1&3\\\\ 2 &-1\\end{vmatrix} + (-1)^{2+2}\\cdot 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}-2&-3\\\\[4pt]\n2&-1\\end{vmatrix} + (-1)^{3+2}\\cdot 0 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}-2&-3\\\\ -1&3\\end{vmatrix} \\\\[4pt]\n& = (-2)\\cdot((-1)\\cdot(-1)-2\\cdot3)+1\\cdot((-2)\\cdot(-1)-2\\cdot(-3)) \\\\[4pt]\n& = (-2)\\cdot(-5)+8 = 18.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nHowever, Laplace expansion is efficient for small matrices only.\n\nThe [[adjugate matrix]] adj(''A'') is the transpose of the matrix consisting of the cofactors, i.e.,\n\n: <math>(\\operatorname{adj}(A))_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} M_{ji}.</math>\n\nIn terms of the adjugate matrix, Laplace's expansion can be written as <ref>\u00a7&nbsp;0.8.2 of R.

Indeed, repeatedly applying the above identities yields\n\n:<math>\\det(A) = \\det(X)^{-1} \\det(B)\\det(X) = \\det(B) \\det(X)^{-1} \\det(X) = \\det(B).</math>\n\nThe determinant is therefore also called a [[similarity invariance|similarity invariant]]. The determinant of a [[linear transformation]]\n:<math>T : V \\rightarrow V</math>\nfor some finite-dimensional [[vector space]] ''V'' is defined to be the determinant of the matrix describing it, with respect to an arbitrary choice of [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] in ''V''. By the similarity invariance, this determinant is independent of the choice of the basis for ''V'' and therefore only depends on the endomorphism ''T''.\n\n=== Exterior algebra ===\n{{See also|Exterior algebra#Linear algebra}}\n\nThe determinant of a linear transformation {{nowrap|''T'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''V''}} of an ''n''-dimensional vector space ''V'' can be formulated in a coordinate-free manner by considering the ''n''th [[exterior algebra|exterior power]] \u039b<sup>''n''</sup>''V'' of ''V''. ''T'' induces a linear map\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n                \\Lambda^n T: \\Lambda^n V &\\rightarrow \\Lambda^n V \\\\\n  v_1 \\wedge v_2 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge v_n &\\mapsto T v_1 \\wedge T v_2 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge T v_n.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAs \u039b<sup>''n''</sup>''V'' is one-dimensional, the map \u039b<sup>''n''</sup>T is given by multiplying with some scalar. This scalar coincides with the determinant of ''T'', that is to say\n:<math>\\left(\\Lambda^n T\\right)\\left(v_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge v_n\\right) = \\det(T) \\cdot v_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge v_n.</math>\n\nThis definition agrees with the more concrete coordinate-dependent definition. In particular, for a square <math> n \\times n</math> matrix ''A'' whose columns are <math>\\mathbf{a_1}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{a_n} </math>, its determinant satisfies <math> \\mathbf{a_1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\mathbf{a_n} = \\det(A) \\cdot \\mathbf{e_1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\mathbf{e_n}</math>, where <math>\\{\\mathbf{e_1}, \\dots, \\mathbf{e_n}\\}</math> is the standard basis of <math> \\mathbb{R}^n </math>. This follows from the characterization of the determinant given above. For example, switching two columns changes the sign of the determinant; likewise, permuting the vectors in the exterior product {{nowrap|''v''<sub>1</sub> \u2227 ''v''<sub>2</sub> \u2227 ''v''<sub>3</sub> \u2227 \u2026 \u2227 ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>}} to {{nowrap|''v''<sub>2</sub> \u2227 ''v''<sub>1</sub> \u2227 ''v''<sub>3</sub> \u2227 \u2026 \u2227 ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>}}, say, also changes its sign.\n\nFor this reason, the highest non-zero exterior power \u039b<sup>''n''</sup>(''V'') is sometimes also called the determinant of ''V'' and similarly for more involved objects such as [[vector bundle]]s or [[chain complex]]es of vector spaces. Minors of a matrix can also be cast in this setting, by considering lower alternating forms \u039b<sup>''k''</sup>''V'' with {{nowrap|''k'' < ''n''}}.\n\n=== Square matrices over commutative rings and abstract properties ===\nThe determinant can also be characterized as the unique function\n:<math>D: M_n(K) \\to K</math>\nfrom the set of all {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices with entries in a field ''K'' to that field satisfying the following three properties: first, ''D'' is an [[Multilinear map|''n''-linear]] function: considering all but one column of ''A'' fixed, the determinant is linear in the remaining column, that is\n:<math>D (v_1, \\dots, v_{i-1}, a v_i + b w, v_{i+1}, \\dots, v_n) = a D (v_1, \\dots, v_{i-1}, v_i, v_{i+1}, \\dots, v_n) + b D (v_1, \\dots, v_{i-1}, w, v_{i+1}, \\dots, v_n)</math>\nfor any column vectors ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>, and ''w'' and any scalars (elements of ''K'') ''a'' and ''b''. Second, ''D'' is an [[alternating form|alternating]] function: for any matrix ''A'' with two identical columns, {{nowrap|1=''D''(''A'') = 0}}. Finally, {{nowrap|1=''D''(''I''<sub>''n''</sub>) = 1}}, where ''I''<sub>''n''</sub> is the identity matrix.\n\nThis fact also implies that every other ''n''-linear alternating function {{nowrap|''F'': M<sub>''n''</sub>(''K'') \u2192 ''K''}} satisfies\n:<math>F(M)=F(I)D(M).</math>\n\nThis definition can also be extended where ''K'' is a [[commutative ring]] ''R'', in which case a matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is an [[Unit (ring theory)|invertible element]] in ''R''. For example, a matrix ''A'' with entries in '''Z''', the integers, is invertible (in the sense that there exists an inverse matrix with integer entries) if the determinant is +1 or \u22121. Such a matrix is called [[unimodular matrix|unimodular]].\n\nThe determinant defines a mapping\n:<math>\\operatorname{GL}_n(R) \\rightarrow R^\\times, </math>\nbetween the group of invertible {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices with entries in ''R'' and the [[multiplicative group]] of units in ''R''. Since it respects the multiplication in both groups, this map is a [[group homomorphism]]. Secondly, given a [[ring homomorphism]] {{nowrap|''f'': ''R'' \u2192 ''S''}}, there is a map {{nowrap|''GL<sub>n</sub>(f)'': GL<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') \u2192 GL<sub>''n''</sub>(''S'')}} given by replacing all entries in ''R'' by their images under ''f''. The determinant respects these maps, i.e., given a matrix {{nowrap|1=''A'' = (''a''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub>)}} with entries in ''R'', the identity\n:<math>f(\\det((a_{i,j}))) = \\det ((f(a_{i,j})))</math>\nholds. In other words, the following diagram commutes:\n\n:[[Image:Determinant as a natural transformation.svg|300px]]\n\nFor example, the determinant of the [[complex conjugate]] of a complex matrix (which is also the determinant of its conjugate transpose) is the complex conjugate of its determinant, and for integer matrices: the reduction modulo&nbsp;''m'' of the determinant of such a matrix is equal to the determinant of the matrix reduced modulo&nbsp;''m'' (the latter determinant being computed using [[modular arithmetic]]). In the language of [[category theory]], the determinant is a [[natural transformation]] between the two functors GL<sub>''n''</sub> and (\u22c5)<sup>\u00d7</sup> (see also [[Natural transformation#Determinant]]).<ref>{{Citation|last=Mac Lane|first=Saunders|title=Categories for the Working Mathematician|volume=|pages=|year=1998|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics '''5'''|edition=2nd|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=0-387-98403-8|authorlink=Saunders Mac Lane|title-link=Categories for the Working Mathematician}}</ref> Adding yet another layer of abstraction, this is captured by saying that the determinant is a morphism of [[algebraic group]]s, from the general linear group to the [[multiplicative group]],\n:<math>\\det: \\operatorname{GL}_n \\rightarrow \\mathbb G_m.</math>\n\n== Generalizations and related notions ==\n\n=== Infinite matrices ===\nFor matrices with an infinite number of rows and columns, the above definitions of the determinant do not carry over directly. For example, in the Leibniz formula, an infinite sum (all of whose terms are infinite products) would have to be calculated. [[Functional analysis]] provides different extensions of the determinant for such infinite-dimensional situations, which however only work for particular kinds of operators.\n\nThe [[Fredholm determinant]] defines the determinant for operators known as [[trace class operator]]s by an appropriate generalization of the formula\n:<math>\\det(I+A) = \\exp(\\operatorname{tr}(\\log(I+A))). </math>\n\nAnother infinite-dimensional notion of determinant is the [[functional determinant]].\n\n===Operators in von Neumann algebras===\nFor operators in a finite [[von Neumann algebra#Factors|factor]], one may define a positive real-valued determinant called the [[Fuglede\u2212Kadison determinant]] using the canonical trace. In fact, corresponding to every [[State (functional analysis)#tracial state|tracial state]] on a [[von Neumann algebra]] there is a notion of Fuglede\u2212Kadison determinant.\n\n=== Related notions for non-commutative rings ===\nFor square matrices with entries in a non-commutative ring, there are various difficulties in defining determinants analogously to that for commutative rings. A meaning can be given to the Leibniz formula provided that the order for the product is specified, and similarly for other definitions of the determinant, but non-commutativity then leads to the loss of many fundamental properties of the determinant, such as  the multiplicative property or the fact that the determinant is unchanged under transposition of the matrix. Over non-commutative rings, there is no reasonable notion of a multilinear form (existence of a nonzero {{clarify span|text=bilinear form|explain=What exactly is meant by this term must be specified.  This statement is valid only if the bilinear form is required to be linear on the same side for both arguments; in contrast, Bourbaki defines a bilinear form B as having the property B(ax,yb) = aB(x,y)b, i.e., left-linear in the left argument and right-linear in the other.|date=October 2017}} with a [[Regular element (ring theory)|regular element]] of ''R'' as value on some pair of arguments implies that ''R'' is commutative). Nevertheless, various notions of non-commutative determinant have been formulated that preserve some of the properties of determinants, notably [[quasideterminant]]s and the [[Dieudonn\u00e9 determinant]]. For some classes of matrices with non-commutative elements, one can define the determinant and prove linear algebra theorems that are very similar to their commutative analogs. Examples include the ''q''-determinant on quantum groups, the [[Capelli determinant]] on Capelli matrices, and the [[Berezinian]] on [[supermatrices]]. [[Manin matrices]] form the class closest to matrices with commutative elements.\n\n=== Further variants ===\nDeterminants of matrices in [[superring]]s (that is, Z<sub>2</sub>-[[graded ring]]s) are known as [[Berezinian]]s or superdeterminants.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/?id=sZ1-G4hQgIIC&pg=PA116&dq=Berezinian#v=onepage&q=Berezinian&f=false | title = Supersymmetry for mathematicians: An introduction | isbn = 978-0-8218-3574-6 | last1 = Varadarajan | first1 = V.

The [[immanant of a matrix|immanant]] generalizes both by introducing a [[character theory|character]] of the [[symmetric group]] S<sub>''n''</sub> in Leibniz's rule.\n\n== Calculation ==\nDeterminants are mainly used as a theoretical tool. They are rarely calculated explicitly in [[numerical linear algebra]], where for applications like checking invertibility and finding eigenvalues the determinant has largely been supplanted by other techniques.<ref name=Trefethen>L.

Bau, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JaPtxOytY7kC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=determinant&f=false Numerical Linear Algebra]'' (SIAM, 1997). e.g. in Lecture 1: \"... we mention that the determinant, though a convenient notion theoretically, rarely finds a useful role in numerical algorithms.\"</ref> [[Computational geometry]], however, does frequently use calculations related to determinants.<ref>\nA survey of state-of-the-art algorithms for computing determinants and their advantages and disadvantages including results of performance tests, is included in\n{{cite journal\n | last1 = Fisikopoulos | first1 = Vissarion\n | last2 = Pe\u00f1aranda | first2 = Luis\n | title = Faster geometric algorithms via dynamic determinant computation\n | journal = Computational Geometry\n | volume = 54\n | pages = 1\u201316\n | publisher = Elsevier B.

Both these approaches are extremely inefficient for large matrices, though, since the number of required operations grows very quickly: it is [[Big O notation|of order]] ''n''! (''n'' [[factorial]]) for an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix ''M''. For example, Leibniz's formula requires calculating ''n''! products. Therefore, more involved techniques have been developed for calculating determinants.\n\n=== Decomposition methods ===\nGiven a matrix ''A'', some methods compute its determinant by writing ''A'' as a product of matrices whose determinants can be more easily computed. Such techniques are referred to as decomposition methods. Examples include the [[LU decomposition]], the [[QR decomposition]] or the [[Cholesky decomposition]] (for [[Positive definite matrix|positive definite matrices]]). These methods are of order O(''n''<sup>3</sup>), which is a significant improvement over O(''n''!)\n\nThe LU decomposition expresses ''A'' in terms of a lower triangular matrix ''L'', an upper triangular matrix ''U'' and a [[permutation matrix]] ''P'':\n:<math> A = PLU. </math>\nThe determinants of ''L'' and ''U'' can be quickly calculated, since they are the products of the respective diagonal entries.  The determinant of ''P'' is just the sign <math>\\varepsilon</math> of the corresponding permutation (which is +1 for an even number of permutations and is \u22121 for an uneven number of permutations). The determinant of ''A'' is then\n\n:<math> \\det(A) = \\varepsilon \\det(L)\\cdot\\det(U). </math>\n\n(See [[determinant identities]].) Moreover, the decomposition can be chosen such that ''L'' is a [[unitriangular matrix]] and therefore has determinant&nbsp;1, in which case the formula further simplifies to\n\n:<math> \\det(A) = \\varepsilon\\det(U).</math>\n\n=== Further methods ===\nIf the determinant of ''A'' and the inverse of ''A'' have already been computed, the [[matrix determinant lemma]] allows rapid calculation of the determinant of {{nowrap|''A'' + ''uv''<sup>T</sup>}}, where ''u'' and ''v'' are column vectors.\n\nSince the definition of the determinant does not need divisions, a question arises: do fast algorithms exist that do not need divisions? This is especially interesting for matrices over rings. Indeed, algorithms with run-time proportional to ''n''<sup>4</sup> exist. An algorithm of Mahajan and Vinay, and Berkowitz<ref>http://page.inf.fu-berlin.de/~rote/Papers/pdf/Division-free+algorithms.pdf</ref> is based on [[closed ordered walk]]s (short ''clow''). It computes more products than the determinant definition requires, but some of these products cancel and the sum of these products can be computed more efficiently. The final algorithm looks very much like an iterated product of triangular matrices.\n\nIf two matrices of order ''n'' can be multiplied in time ''M''(''n''), where {{nowrap|''M''(''n'') \u2265 ''n''<sup>''a''</sup>}} for some {{nowrap|''a'' > 2}}, then the determinant can be computed in time O(''M''(''n'')).<ref>{{cite journal |first=J.

Unfortunately this interesting method does not always work in its original form.\n\nAlgorithms can also be assessed according to their [[bit complexity]], i.e., how many bits of accuracy are needed to store intermediate values occurring in the computation. For example, the [[Gaussian elimination]] (or LU decomposition) method is of order O(''n''<sup>3</sup>), but the bit length of intermediate values can become exponentially long.<ref>{{Cite conference\n  | first1 = Xin Gui\n  | last1 = Fang\n  | first2 = George\n  | last2 = Havas\n  | title = On the worst-case complexity of integer Gaussian elimination\n  | booktitle = Proceedings of the 1997 international symposium on Symbolic and algebraic computation\n  | conference = ISSAC '97\n  | pages = 28\u201331\n  | publisher = ACM\n  | year = 1997\n  | location = Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States\n  | url = http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/gilles.villard/BIBLIOGRAPHIE/PDF/ft_gateway.cfm.pdf\n  | doi = 10.1145/258726.258740\n  | isbn = 0-89791-875-4\n  | access-date = 2011-01-22\n  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110807042828/http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/gilles.villard/BIBLIOGRAPHIE/PDF/ft_gateway.cfm.pdf\n  | archive-date = 2011-08-07\n  | url-status = dead\n  }}</ref> The [[Bareiss Algorithm]], on the other hand, is an exact-division method based on [[Sylvester's determinant theorem|Sylvester's identity]] is also of order ''n''<sup>3</sup>, but the bit complexity is roughly the bit size of the original entries in the matrix times ''n''.<ref>{{citation|first=Erwin|last=Bareiss|title= Sylvester's Identity and Multistep Integer-Preserving Gaussian Elimination|pages=565\u2013578|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1968-22-103/S0025-5718-1968-0226829-0/S0025-5718-1968-0226829-0.pdf|journal=Mathematics of Computation|year=1968|volume=22|issue=102|doi=10.2307/2004533|jstor=2004533}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, determinants were used long before matrices: originally, a determinant was defined as a property of a [[system of linear equations]]. \nThe determinant \"determines\" whether the system has a unique solution (which occurs precisely if the determinant is non-zero). \nIn this sense, determinants were first used in the Chinese mathematics textbook ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' (\u4e5d\u7ae0\u7b97\u8853, Chinese scholars, around the 3rd century BCE). \nIn Europe, {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} determinants were considered by [[Gerolamo Cardano|Cardano]] at the end of the 16th century and larger ones by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]].<ref name=\"Campbell\" /><ref name=\"Eves\">Eves, H: \"An Introduction to the History of Mathematics\", pages 405, 493\u2013494, Saunders College Publishing, 1990.</ref><ref>A Brief History of Linear Algebra and Matrix Theory : {{cite web |url=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~vitulli/441.sp04/LinAlgHistory.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910034016/http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~vitulli/441.sp04/LinAlgHistory.html |archivedate=2012-09-10 }}</ref><ref>Cajori, F.

Immediately following, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] (1773) treated determinants of the second and third order and applied it to questions of [[elimination theory]]; he proved many special cases of general identities.\n\n[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] (1801) made the next advance. Like Lagrange, he made much use of determinants in the [[theory of numbers]]. He introduced the word '''''determinant''''' (Laplace had used ''resultant''), though not in the present signification, but rather as applied to the [[discriminant]] of a [[algebraic form|quantic]]. Gauss also arrived at the notion of reciprocal (inverse) determinants, and came very near the multiplication theorem.\n\nThe next contributor of importance is [[Jacques Philippe Marie Binet|Binet]] (1811, 1812), who formally stated the theorem relating to the product of two matrices of ''m'' columns and ''n'' rows, which for the special case of {{nowrap|1=''m'' = ''n''}} reduces to the multiplication theorem. On the same day (November 30, 1812) that Binet presented his paper to the Academy, [[Cauchy]] also presented one on the subject. (See [[Cauchy\u2013Binet formula]].) In this he used the word '''''determinant''''' in its present sense,<ref>The first use of the word \"determinant\" in the modern sense appeared in: Cauchy, Augustin-Louis \"Memoire sur les fonctions qui ne peuvent obtenir que deux valeurs \u00e9gales et des signes contraires par suite des transpositions oper\u00e9es entre les variables qu'elles renferment,\" which was first read at the Institute de France in Paris on November 30, 1812, and which was subsequently published in the ''Journal de l'Ecole Polytechnique'', Cahier 17, Tome 10, pages 29\u2013112 (1815).</ref><ref>Origins of mathematical terms: http://jeff560.tripod.com/d.html</ref> summarized and simplified what was then known on the subject, improved the notation, and gave the multiplication theorem with a proof more satisfactory than Binet's.<ref name=\"Campbell\" /><ref>History of matrices and determinants: http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Matrices_and_determinants.html</ref> With him begins the theory in its generality.\n\nThe next important figure was [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi|Jacobi]]<ref name=\"Eves\" /> (from 1827). He early used the functional determinant which Sylvester later called the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]], and in his memoirs in ''[[Crelle's Journal]]'' for 1841 he specially treats this subject, as well as the class of alternating functions which Sylvester has called ''alternants''. About the time of Jacobi's last memoirs, [[James Joseph Sylvester|Sylvester]] (1839) and [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] began their work.<ref>The first use of vertical lines to denote a determinant appeared in: Cayley, Arthur \"On a theorem in the geometry of position,\" ''Cambridge Mathematical Journal'', vol. 2, pages 267\u2013271 (1841).</ref><ref>History of matrix notation: http://jeff560.tripod.com/matrices.html</ref>\n\nThe study of special forms of determinants has been the natural result of the completion of the general theory. Axisymmetric determinants have been studied by [[Lebesgue]], [[Otto Hesse|Hesse]], and Sylvester; [[persymmetric]] determinants by Sylvester and [[Hermann Hankel|Hankel]]; [[circulant]]s by [[Eug\u00e8ne Charles Catalan|Catalan]], [[William Spottiswoode|Spottiswoode]], [[James Whitbread Lee Glaisher|Glaisher]], and Scott; skew determinants and [[Pfaffian]]s, in connection with the theory of [[orthogonal transformation]], by Cayley; continuants by Sylvester; [[Wronskian]]s (so called by [[Thomas Muir (mathematician)|Muir]]) by [[Elwin Bruno Christoffel|Christoffel]] and [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius|Frobenius]]; compound determinants by Sylvester, Reiss, and Picquet; Jacobians and [[Hessian matrix|Hessians]] by Sylvester; and symmetric gauche determinants by [[Trudi]]. Of the textbooks on the subject Spottiswoode's was the first. In America, Hanus (1886), Weld (1893), and Muir/Metzler (1933) published treatises.\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Linear independence ===\nAs mentioned above, the determinant of a matrix (with real or complex entries, say) is zero if and only if the column vectors (or the row vectors) of the matrix are linearly dependent. Thus, determinants can be used to characterize linearly dependent vectors. For example, given two linearly independent vectors ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub> in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>, a third vector ''v''<sub>3</sub> lies in the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] [[Linear span|spanned]] by the former two vectors exactly if the determinant of the {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix consisting of the three vectors is zero. The same idea is also used in the theory of [[differential equation]]s: given ''n'' functions ''f''<sub>1</sub>(''x''), \u2026, ''f''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'') (supposed to be {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}} times differentiable), the [[Wronskian]] is defined to be\n:<math>W(f_1, \\ldots, f_n)(x) =\n  \\begin{vmatrix}\n            f_1(x) &         f_2(x) & \\cdots &         f_n(x) \\\\\n           f_1'(x) &        f_2'(x) & \\cdots &        f_n'(x) \\\\\n            \\vdots &         \\vdots & \\ddots &         \\vdots \\\\\n    f_1^{(n-1)}(x) & f_2^{(n-1)}(x) & \\cdots & f_n^{(n-1)}(x)\n\\end{vmatrix}.</math>\n\nIt is non-zero (for some ''x'') in a specified interval if and only if the given functions and all their derivatives up to order ''n''\u22121 are linearly independent. If it can be shown that the Wronskian is zero everywhere on an interval then, in the case of [[analytic function]]s, this implies the given functions are linearly dependent. See [[Wronskian#The Wronskian and linear independence|the Wronskian and linear independence]].\n\n=== Orientation of a basis ===\n{{Main|Orientation (vector space)}}\nThe determinant can be thought of as assigning a number to every [[sequence]] of ''n'' vectors in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, by using the square matrix whose columns are the given vectors. For instance, an [[orthogonal matrix]] with entries in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> represents an [[orthonormal basis]] in [[Euclidean space]]. The determinant of such a matrix determines whether the [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] of the basis is consistent with or opposite to the orientation of the [[standard basis]]. If the determinant is +1, the basis has the same orientation. If it is \u22121, the basis has the opposite orientation.\n\nMore generally, if the determinant of ''A'' is positive, ''A'' represents an orientation-preserving [[linear transformation]] (if ''A'' is an orthogonal {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} or {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix, this is a [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]), while if it is negative, ''A'' switches the orientation of the basis.\n\n=== Volume and Jacobian determinant ===\nAs pointed out above, the [[absolute value]] of the determinant of real vectors is equal to the volume of the [[parallelepiped]] spanned by those vectors. As a consequence, if {{nowrap|''f'' : '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is the linear map represented by the matrix ''A'', and ''S'' is any [[Lebesgue measure|measurable]] [[subset]] of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, then the volume of ''f''(''S'') is given by {{abs|det(''A'')}} times the volume of ''S''. More generally, if the linear map {{nowrap|''f'' : '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>}} is represented by the {{nowrap|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix ''A'', then the ''n''-[[dimension]]al volume of ''f''(''S'') is given by:\n:<math>\\operatorname{volume}(f(S)) = \\sqrt{\\det\\left(A^\\textsf{T} A\\right)} \\times \\operatorname{volume}(S).</math>\n\nBy calculating the volume of the [[tetrahedron]] bounded by four points, they can be used to identify [[skew line]]s.

The determinant of a matrix {{math|''A''}} is denoted {{math|det(''A'')}}, {{math|det ''A''}}, or {{math|{{abs|''A''}}}}. Geometrically, it can be viewed as the [[volume]] scaling factor of the linear transformation described by the matrix. This is also the signed volume of the ''n''-dimensional [[parallelepiped]] spanned by the column or row vectors of the matrix. The determinant is positive or negative according to whether the linear mapping preserves or reverses the orientation of ''n''-space.\n\nIn the case of a {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} matrix the determinant may be defined as\n:<math>\\begin{align}|A| = \\begin{vmatrix} a & b\\\\c & d \\end{vmatrix}=ad - bc .\\end{align}</math>\n\nSimilarly, for a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix ''A'', its determinant is\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  |A| = \\begin{vmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{vmatrix}\n     &= a\\,\\begin{vmatrix} \\Box & \\Box & \\Box \\\\ \\Box & e & f \\\\ \\Box & h & i \\end{vmatrix} - \n        b\\,\\begin{vmatrix} \\Box & \\Box & \\Box \\\\ d & \\Box & f \\\\ g & \\Box & i \\end{vmatrix} + \n        c\\,\\begin{vmatrix} \\Box & \\Box & \\Box \\\\ d & e & \\Box \\\\ g & h & \\Box \\end{vmatrix} \\\\[3pt]\n     &= a\\,\\begin{vmatrix} e & f \\\\ h & i \\end{vmatrix} - \n        b\\,\\begin{vmatrix} d & f \\\\ g & i \\end{vmatrix} + \n        c\\,\\begin{vmatrix} d & e \\\\ g & h \\end{vmatrix} \\\\[3pt]\n     &= aei + bfg + cdh - ceg - bdi - afh.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nEach determinant of a {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} matrix in this equation is called a [[minor (linear algebra)|minor]] of the matrix {{math|''A''}}.  This procedure can be extended to give a recursive definition for the determinant of an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix, the ''[[Laplace expansion|minor expansion formula]]''.\n\nDeterminants occur throughout mathematics. For example, a matrix is often used to represent the [[coefficient]]s in a [[system of linear equations]], and the determinant can be used to [[Cramer's rule|solve]] those equations, although other methods of solution are much more computationally efficient. In linear algebra, a matrix (with entries in a [[Field (mathematics)|field]]) is singular (not [[Inverse matrix|invertible]]) [[if and only if]] its determinant is zero. This leads to the use of determinants in defining the [[characteristic polynomial]] of a matrix, whose roots are the [[eigenvalue]]s. In [[analytic geometry]], determinants express the signed ''n''-dimensional volumes of ''n''-dimensional parallelepipeds. This leads to the use of determinants in [[calculus]], the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian determinant]] in the [[Integration_by_substitution#Substitution_for_multiple_variables|change of variables rule]] for integrals of functions of several variables. Determinants appear frequently in algebraic identities such as the [[Vandermonde identity]].\n\nDeterminants possess many algebraic properties. One of them is multiplicativity, namely that the determinant of a [[matrix multiplication|product of matrices]] is equal to the product of determinants. Special types of matrices have special determinants; for example, the determinant of an [[orthogonal matrix]] is always plus or minus one, and the determinant of a complex [[Hermitian matrix]] is always [[real number|real]].\n\n==Geometric meaning==\nIf an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} [[Real number|real]] matrix ''A'' is written in terms of its column vectors <math>A = [\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c} \\mathbf{a}_1 & \\mathbf{a}_2 & \\cdots & \\mathbf{a}_n\\end{array}]</math> then \n:<math>\n  A\\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\\\ \\vdots \\\\0\\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a}_1, \\quad\n  A\\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\\\ \\vdots \\\\0\\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a}_2, \\quad\n                                                         \\ldots, \\quad\n  A\\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\1\\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{a}_n. \n</math>\n\nThis means that <math>A</math> maps the unit [[Hypercube|''n''-cube]] to the ''n''-dimensional [[parallelepiped#Parallelotope|parallelotope]] defined by the vectors <math>\\mathbf{a}_1, \\mathbf{a}_2, \\ldots,  \\mathbf{a}_n,</math> the region <math>P = \\left\\{c_1 \\mathbf{a}_1 + \\cdots + c_n\\mathbf{a}_n \\mid 0 \\leq c_i\\leq 1 \\ \\forall i\\right\\}.</math>\n\nThe determinant gives the [[orientation (vector space)|signed]] ''n''-dimensional volume of this parallelotope, <math>\\det(A) = \\pm \\text{vol}(P),</math> and hence describes more generally the ''n''-dimensional volume scaling factor of the [[linear transformation]] produced by ''A''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://textbooks.math.gatech.edu/ila/determinants-volumes.html|title=Determinants and Volumes|author=|date=|website=textbooks.math.gatech.edu|accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref> (The sign shows whether the transformation preserves or reverses [[Orientation (vector space)|orientation]].) In particular, if the determinant is zero, then this parallelotope has volume zero and is not fully ''n''-dimensional, which indicates that the dimension of the image of ''A'' is less than ''n''. This [[Rank\u2013nullity theorem|means]] that ''A'' produces a linear transformation which is neither [[surjective function|onto]] nor [[Injective function|one-to-one]], and so is not invertible.\n\n== Definition ==\nThere are various equivalent ways to define the determinant of a [[square matrix]] ''A'', i.e. one with the same number of rows and columns.  Perhaps the simplest way to express the determinant is by considering the elements in the top row and the respective [[minor (linear algebra)|minors]]; starting at the left, multiply the element by the minor, then subtract the product of the next element and its minor, and alternate adding and subtracting such products until all elements in the top row have been exhausted.  For example, here is the result for a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix:\n:<math>\n  \\begin{vmatrix} a & b & c & d\\\\ e & f & g & h\\\\ i & j & k & l\\\\ m & n & o & p \\end{vmatrix} =\n  a\\,\\begin{vmatrix} f & g & h\\\\ j & k & l\\\\ n & o & p \\end{vmatrix} -\n    b\\,\\begin{vmatrix} e & g & h\\\\ i & k & l\\\\ m & o & p \\end{vmatrix} +\n    c\\,\\begin{vmatrix} e & f & h\\\\ i & j & l\\\\ m & n & p \\end{vmatrix} -\n    d\\,\\begin{vmatrix} e & f & g\\\\ i & j & k\\\\ m & n & o \\end{vmatrix}.\n</math>\nAnother way to define the determinant is expressed in terms of the columns of the matrix.  If we write an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix ''A'' in terms of its column vectors\n: <math>A = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & a_2 & \\cdots & a_n \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nwhere the <math>a_j</math> are vectors of size ''n'', then the determinant of ''A'' is defined so that\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\det \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & \\cdots & b a_j + c v & \\cdots & a_n \\end{bmatrix}\n          &= b\\det(A) + c \\det \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & \\cdots & v & \\cdots & a_n \\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n  \\det \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & \\cdots & a_j & a_{j+1} & \\cdots & a_n \\end{bmatrix}\n          &= -\\det \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & \\cdots & a_{j+1} & a_j & \\cdots & a_n \\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n  \\det(I) &= 1\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere ''b'' and ''c'' are scalars, ''v'' is any vector of size ''n'' and ''I'' is the [[identity matrix]] of size ''n''.  These equations say that the determinant is a linear function of each column, that interchanging adjacent columns reverses the sign of the determinant, and that the determinant of the identity matrix is 1. These properties mean that the determinant is an alternating multilinear function of the columns that maps the identity matrix to the underlying unit scalar.  These suffice to uniquely calculate the determinant of any square matrix. Provided the underlying scalars form a field (more generally, a commutative ring with unity), the definition below shows that such a function exists, and it can be shown to be unique.<ref>[[Serge Lang]], ''Linear Algebra'', 2nd Edition, Addison-Wesley, 1971, pp 173, 191.</ref>\n\nEquivalently, the determinant can be expressed as a sum of products of entries of the matrix where each product has ''n'' terms and the coefficient of each product is \u22121 or 1 or 0 according to a given rule: it is a [[polynomial expression]] of the matrix entries. This expression grows rapidly with the size of the matrix (an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix contributes [[Factorial|''n''!]] terms), so it will first be given explicitly for the case of {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} matrices and {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrices, followed by the rule for arbitrary size matrices, which subsumes these two cases.\n\nAssume ''A'' is a square matrix with ''n'' rows and ''n'' columns, so that it can be written as\n:<math>A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} &  \\dots & a_{1,n} \\\\\n  a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} &  \\dots & a_{2,n} \\\\\n   \\vdots &  \\vdots & \\ddots &  \\vdots \\\\\n  a_{n,1} & a_{n,2} &  \\dots & a_{n,n}\n\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe entries can be numbers or expressions (as happens when the determinant is used to define a [[characteristic polynomial]]); the definition of the determinant depends only on the fact that they can be added and multiplied together in a [[Commutativity|commutative]] manner.\n\nThe determinant of ''A'' is denoted by det(''A''), or it can be denoted directly in terms of the matrix entries by writing enclosing bars instead of brackets:\n:<math>\\begin{vmatrix}\n  a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} &  \\dots & a_{1,n} \\\\\n  a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} &  \\dots & a_{2,n} \\\\\n   \\vdots &  \\vdots & \\ddots &  \\vdots \\\\\n  a_{n,1} & a_{n,2} &  \\dots & a_{n,n}\n\\end{vmatrix}.</math>\n\n=== 2 \u00d7 2 matrices ===\n[[File:Area parallellogram as determinant.svg|thumb|right|The area of the parallelogram is the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix formed by the vectors representing the parallelogram's sides.]]\nThe [[Leibniz formula for determinants|Leibniz formula]] for the determinant of a {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} matrix is\n:<math>\\begin{vmatrix} a & b \\\\c & d \\end{vmatrix} = ad - bc.</math>\n\nIf the matrix entries are real numbers, the matrix ''A'' can be used to represent two [[linear map]]s:  one that maps the [[standard basis]] vectors to the rows of ''A'', and one that maps them to the columns of ''A''.  In either case, the images of the basis vectors form a [[parallelogram]] that represents the image of the [[unit square]] under the mapping.  The parallelogram defined by the rows of the above matrix is the one with vertices at {{nowrap|(0, 0)}}, {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}}, {{nowrap|(''a'' + ''c'', ''b'' + ''d'')}}, and {{nowrap|(''c'', ''d'')}}, as shown in the accompanying diagram.\n\nThe absolute value of {{nowrap|''ad'' \u2212 ''bc''}} is the area of the parallelogram, and thus represents the scale factor by which areas are transformed by ''A''. (The parallelogram formed by the columns of ''A'' is in general a different parallelogram, but since the determinant is symmetric with respect to rows and columns, the area will be the same.)\n\nThe absolute value of the determinant together with the sign becomes the ''oriented area'' of the parallelogram. The oriented area is the same as the usual [[area (geometry)|area]], except that it is negative when the angle from the first to the second vector defining the parallelogram turns in a clockwise direction (which is opposite to the direction one would get for the [[identity matrix]]).\n\nTo show that {{nowrap|''ad'' \u2212 ''bc''}} is the signed area, one may consider a matrix containing two vectors {{nowrap|1='''a''' = (''a'', ''b'')}} and {{nowrap|1='''b''' = (''c'', ''d'')}} representing the parallelogram's sides. The signed area can be expressed as {{nowrap|{{!}}'''a'''{{!}}{{!}}'''b'''{{!}}sin''\u03b8''}} for the angle ''\u03b8'' between the vectors, which is simply base times height, the length of one vector times the perpendicular component of the other. Due to the [[sine]] this already is the signed area, yet it may be expressed more conveniently using the [[cosine]] of the complementary angle to a perpendicular vector, e.g. {{nowrap|1='''a'''<sup>\u22a5</sup> = (\u2212''b'', ''a'')}}, so that {{nowrap|{{!}}'''a'''<sup>\u22a5</sup>{{!}}{{!}}'''b'''{{!}}cos''\u03b8' ''}}, which can be determined by the pattern of the [[scalar product]] to be equal to {{nowrap|''ad'' \u2212 ''bc''}}:\n\n: <math>\\text{Signed area} =\n  |\\boldsymbol{a}| |\\boldsymbol{b}|\\sin\\theta = \\left|\\boldsymbol{a}^\\perp\\right| |\\boldsymbol{b}|\\cos\\theta' =\n  \\begin{pmatrix} -b \\\\ a \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} c \\\\ d \\end{pmatrix} = ad - bc.\n</math>\n\nThus the determinant gives the scaling factor and the orientation induced by the mapping represented by ''A''. When the determinant is equal to one, the linear mapping defined by the matrix is [[Equiareal map|equi-areal]] and orientation-preserving.\n\nThe object known as the ''[[bivector]]'' is related to these ideas.

The value in the ''i''th position after the reordering ''\u03c3'' is denoted by ''\u03c3''<sub>''i''</sub>. For example, for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}}, the original sequence 1, 2, 3 might be reordered to {{nowrap|1=''\u03c3'' = [2, 3, 1]}}, with {{nowrap|1=''\u03c3''<sub>1</sub> = 2}}, {{nowrap|1=''\u03c3''<sub>2</sub> = 3}}, and {{nowrap|1=''\u03c3''<sub>3</sub> = 1}}.  The set of all such permutations (also known as the [[symmetric group]] on ''n'' elements) is denoted by S<sub>''n''</sub>. For each permutation ''\u03c3'', sgn(''\u03c3'') denotes the [[signature (permutation)|signature]] of ''\u03c3'', a value that is +1 whenever the reordering given by \u03c3 can be achieved by successively interchanging two entries an even number of times, and \u22121 whenever it can be achieved by an odd number of such interchanges.\n\nIn any of the <math>n!</math> summands, the term\n\n:<math>\\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i, \\sigma_i}</math>\n\nis notation for the product of the entries at positions {{nowrap|(''i'', \u03c3<sub>''i''</sub>)}}, where ''i'' ranges from 1 to ''n'':\n\n:<math>a_{1,\\sigma_1} \\cdot a_{2,\\sigma_2} \\cdots  a_{n,\\sigma_n}.</math>\n\nFor example, the determinant of a {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix ''A'' ({{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}}) is\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n      &\\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\sgn(\\sigma) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,\\sigma_i} \\\\\n  ={} &\\sgn([1,2,3]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[1,2,3]_i} + \\sgn([1,3,2]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[1,3,2]_i} + \\sgn([2,1,3]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[2,1,3]_i} +{} \\\\\n      &\\sgn([2,3,1]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[2,3,1]_i} + \\sgn([3,1,2]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[3,1,2]_i} + \\sgn([3,2,1]) \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[3,2,1]_i} \\\\\n  ={} &\\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[1,2,3]_i} - \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[1,3,2]_i} - \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[2,1,3]_i} + \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[2,3,1]_i} + \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[3,1,2]_i} - \\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,[3,2,1]_i} \\\\[2pt]\n  ={} & a_{1,1}a_{2,2}a_{3,3} - a_{1,1}a_{2,3}a_{3,2} - a_{1,2}a_{2,1}a_{3,3} +\n        a_{1,2}a_{2,3}a_{3,1} + a_{1,3}a_{2,1}a_{3,2} - a_{1,3}a_{2,2}a_{3,1}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==== Levi-Civita symbol ====\nIt is sometimes useful to extend the Leibniz formula to a summation in which not only permutations, but all sequences of ''n'' indices in the  range {{nowrap|1, \u2026, ''n''}} occur, ensuring that the contribution of a sequence will be zero unless it denotes a permutation. Thus the totally antisymmetric [[Levi-Civita symbol]] <math>\\varepsilon_{i_1,\\cdots,i_n}</math> extends the signature of a permutation, by setting <math>\\varepsilon_{\\sigma(1),\\cdots,\\sigma(n)} = \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)</math> for any permutation ''\u03c3'' of ''n'', and <math>\\varepsilon_{i_1,\\cdots,i_n} = 0</math> when no permutation ''\u03c3'' exists such that <math>\\sigma(j) = i_j</math> for <math>j=1,\\ldots,n</math> (or equivalently, whenever some pair of indices are equal). The determinant for an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix can then be expressed using an ''n''-fold summation as\n:<math>\\det(A) = \\sum_{i_1,i_2,\\ldots,i_n=1}^n \\varepsilon_{i_1\\cdots i_n} a_{1,i_1} \\cdots a_{n,i_n},</math>\n\nor using two epsilon symbols as\n:<math> \\det(A) = \\frac{1}{n!}\\sum\\varepsilon_{i_1\\cdots i_n} \\varepsilon_{j_1\\cdots j_n} a_{i_1 j_1} \\cdots a_{i_n j_n},</math>\n\nwhere now each ''i<sub>r</sub>'' and each ''j<sub>r</sub>'' should be summed over {{nowrap|1, \u2026, ''n''}}.\n\nHowever, through the use of tensor notation and the suppression of the summation symbol (Einstein's summation convention) we can obtain a much more compact expression of the determinant of the second order system of <math>n=3</math> dimensions, <math>a^m_n</math>;\n\n:<math>\\det(a^m_n)e_{rst} = e_{ijk}a_r^i a_s^j a_t^k</math>\n\nwhere <math>e_{rst}</math> and <math>e_{ijk}</math> represent 'e-systems' that take on the values 0, +1 and \u22121 given the number of permutations of <math>ijk</math> and <math>rst</math>.

This means that if the ''j''th column of a matrix <math>A</math> is written as a sum <math>\\mathbf a_j = \\mathbf v + \\mathbf w</math> of two [[column vector]]s, and all other columns are left unchanged, then the determinant of <math>A</math> is the sum of the determinants of the matrices obtained from <math>A</math> by replacing the ''j''th column by <math>\\mathbf v</math> (denoted <math>A_v</math>) and then by <math>\\mathbf{w}</math> (denoted <math>A_w</math>) (and a similar relation holds when writing a column as a scalar multiple of a column vector).\n#: <math>\\begin{align}\\det(A)\n  &= \\det([\\mathbf{a}_1|\\dots|\\mathbf{a}_j|\\dots|\\mathbf{a}_n]) \\\\\n  &= \\det([\\dots|\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}|\\dots]) \\\\\n  &= \\det([\\dots|\\mathbf{v}|\\dots]) + \\det([\\dots|\\mathbf{w}|\\dots]) \\\\\n  &= \\det\\left(A_v\\right) + \\det\\left(A_w\\right)\n\\end{align}</math>\n# <li value=\"9\">If in a matrix, any row or column has all elements equal to zero, then the determinant of that matrix is 0.\n# This ''n''-linear function is an [[alternating form]]. This means that whenever two columns of a matrix are identical, or more generally some column can be expressed as a linear combination of the other columns (i.e. the columns of the matrix form a [[Linearly independent|linearly dependent]] set), its determinant is 0.\n\nProperties 1, 8 and 10 \u2014 which all follow from the Leibniz formula \u2014 completely characterize the determinant; in other words the determinant is the unique function from {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices to scalars that is ''n''-linear alternating in the columns, and takes the value 1 for the identity matrix (this characterization holds even if scalars are taken in any given [[commutative ring]]). To see this it suffices to expand the determinant by multi-linearity in the columns into a (huge) linear combination of determinants of matrices in which each column is a [[standard basis]] vector. These determinants are either 0 (by property&nbsp;9) or else \u00b11 (by properties 1 and&nbsp;12 below), so the linear combination gives the expression above in terms of the Levi-Civita symbol. While less technical in appearance, this characterization cannot entirely replace the Leibniz formula in defining the determinant, since without it the existence of an appropriate function is not clear. For matrices over non-commutative rings, properties 8 and 9 are incompatible for {{nowrap|''n'' \u2265 2}},<ref>In a non-commutative setting left-linearity (compatibility with left-multiplication by scalars) should be distinguished from right-linearity. Assuming linearity in the columns is taken to be left-linearity, one would have, for non-commuting scalars ''a'', ''b'':\n:<math>ab =\n  ab \\begin{vmatrix}1&0 \\\\ 0&1\\end{vmatrix} =\n   a \\begin{vmatrix}1&0 \\\\ 0&b\\end{vmatrix} =\n     \\begin{vmatrix}a&0 \\\\ 0&b\\end{vmatrix} =\n   b \\begin{vmatrix}a&0 \\\\ 0&1\\end{vmatrix} =\n  ba \\begin{vmatrix}1&0 \\\\ 0&1\\end{vmatrix} = ba,\n</math>\n\na contradiction. There is no useful notion of multi-linear functions over a non-commutative ring.</ref> so there is no good definition of the determinant in this setting.\n\nProperty 2 above implies that properties for columns have their counterparts in terms of rows:\n# <li value=\"11\">Viewing an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix as being composed of ''n'' rows, the determinant is an ''n''-linear function.\n# This ''n''-linear function is an alternating form: whenever two rows of a matrix are identical, its determinant is 0.\n# Interchanging any pair of columns or rows of a matrix multiplies its determinant by&nbsp;\u22121. This follows from properties 8 and 10 (it is a general property of multilinear alternating maps). More generally, any permutation of the rows or columns multiplies the determinant by the [[parity of a permutation|sign]] of the permutation. By permutation, it is meant viewing each row as a vector '''R'''<sub>''i''</sub> (equivalently each column as '''C'''<sub>''i''</sub>) and reordering the rows (or columns) by interchange of '''R'''<sub>''j''</sub> and '''R'''<sub>''k''</sub> (or '''C'''<sub>''j''</sub> and '''C'''<sub>''k''</sub>), where ''j'', ''k'' are two indices chosen from 1 to ''n'' for an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} square matrix.\n# Adding a scalar multiple of one column to ''another'' column does not change the value of the determinant. This is a consequence of properties 8 and 10 in the following way: by property&nbsp;8 the determinant changes by a multiple of the determinant of a matrix with two equal columns, which determinant is 0 by property&nbsp;10. Similarly, adding a scalar multiple of one row to another row leaves the determinant unchanged.\n</li>\n\nProperty 5 says that the determinant on {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices is [[Homogeneous function|homogeneous]] of degree ''n''. These properties can be used to facilitate the computation of determinants by simplifying the matrix to the point where the determinant can be determined immediately. Specifically, for matrices with coefficients in a [[field (mathematics)|field]], properties 13 and 14 can be used to transform any matrix into a triangular matrix, whose determinant is given by property&nbsp;7; this is essentially the method of [[Gaussian elimination]].\n\nFor example, the determinant of\n\n:<math>A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  -2 & 2 & -3 \\\\\n  -1 & 1 &  3 \\\\\n   2 & 0 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\ncan be computed using the following matrices:\n:<math>\n  B = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    -2 & 2 & -3\\\\\n     0 & 0 &  4.5\\\\\n     2 & 0 & -1\n  \\end{bmatrix},\\quad\n  C = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    -2 & 2 & -3\\\\\n     0 & 0 &  4.5\\\\\n     0 & 2 & -4\n  \\end{bmatrix},\\quad\n  D = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    -2 & 2 & -3\\\\\n     0 & 2 & -4\\\\\n     0 & 0 &  4.5\n  \\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nHere, ''B'' is obtained from ''A'' by adding \u22121/2\u00d7the first row to the second, so that {{nowrap|1=det(''A'') = det(''B'')}}. ''C'' is obtained from ''B'' by adding the first to the third row, so that {{nowrap|1=det(''C'') = det(''B'')}}. Finally, ''D'' is obtained from ''C'' by exchanging the second and third row, so that {{nowrap|1=det(''D'') = \u2212det(''C'')}}. The determinant of the (upper) triangular matrix ''D'' is the product of its entries on the [[main diagonal]]: {{nowrap|1=(\u22122) \u00b7 2 \u00b7 4.5 = \u221218}}. Therefore, {{nowrap|1=det(''A'') = \u2212det(''D'') = +18}}.\n\n=== Schur complement ===\nThe following identity holds for a [[Schur complement]] of a square [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]:\n\nThe Schur complement arises as the result of performing a block [[Gaussian elimination]] by multiplying the matrix ''M'' from the right with a ''block lower triangular'' matrix\n:<math>L = \\begin{bmatrix} I_p & 0 \\\\ -D^{-1}C & I_q \\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nHere ''I''<sub>''p''</sub> denotes the ''p''&#xD7;''p'' [[identity matrix]]. After multiplication with the matrix ''L'', the Schur complement appears in the upper ''p''&#xD7;''p'' block. The product matrix is\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  ML &= \\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} I_p & 0 \\\\ -D^{-1}C & I_q \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} A - BD^{-1}C & B \\\\ 0 & D \\end{bmatrix} \\\\[5pt]\n     &= \\begin{bmatrix} I_p & BD^{-1} \\\\ 0 & I_q \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} A - BD^{-1}C & 0 \\\\ 0 & D \\end{bmatrix}.\n \\end{align}</math>\n\nThat is, we have effected a Gaussian decomposition\n:<math>\n  \\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{bmatrix} =\n  \\begin{bmatrix} I_p & BD^{-1} \\\\ 0 & I_q \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\begin{bmatrix} A-BD^{-1}C & 0 \\\\ 0 & D \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\begin{bmatrix} I_p & 0 \\\\ D^{-1}C & I_q \\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nThe first and last matrices on the RHS have determinant unity,  so we have\n:<math>\\det\\begin{bmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{bmatrix} = \\det(D) \\cdot \\det\\left(A - BD^{-1} C\\right).</math>\n\nThis is Schur's determinant identity.\n\n=== Multiplicativity and matrix groups ===\nThe determinant of a [[matrix product]] of square matrices equals the product of their determinants:\n:<math>\\det(AB) = \\det (A) \\times \\det (B)</math>\n\nThus the determinant is a ''multiplicative map''. This property is a consequence of the characterization given above of the determinant as the unique ''n''-linear alternating function of the columns with value&nbsp;1 on the identity matrix, since the function {{nowrap|M<sub>''n''</sub>(''K'') \u2192 ''K''}} that maps {{nowrap|''M'' \u21a6 det(''AM'')}} can easily be seen to be ''n''-linear and alternating in the columns of ''M'', and takes the value det(''A'') at the identity. The formula can be generalized  to (square) products of rectangular matrices, giving the [[Cauchy\u2013Binet formula]], which also provides an independent proof of the multiplicative property.\n\nThe determinant det(''A'') of a matrix ''A'' is non-zero if and only if ''A'' is invertible or, yet another equivalent statement, if its [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] equals the size of the matrix. If so, the determinant of the inverse matrix is given by\n:<math>\\det\\left(A^{-1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\det(A)} = [\\det(A)]^{-1}</math>\n\nIn particular, products and inverses of matrices with determinant one still have this property. Thus, the set of such matrices (of fixed size ''n'') form a group known as the [[special linear group]]. More generally, the word \"special\" indicates the subgroup of another [[matrix group]] of matrices of determinant one. Examples include the [[special orthogonal group]] (which if ''n'' is 2 or 3 consists of all [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]]), and the [[special unitary group]].\n\n=== Laplace's formula and the adjugate matrix ===\n[[Laplace expansion|Laplace's formula]] expresses the determinant of a matrix in terms of its [[minor (matrix)|minors]]. The minor ''M''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub> is defined to be the determinant of the {{nowrap|(''n''\u22121) \u00d7 (''n''\u22121)}}-matrix that results from ''A'' by removing the ''i''th row and the ''j''th column. The expression {{nowrap|(\u22121)<sup>''i''+''j''</sup> ''M''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub>}} is known as a [[cofactor (linear algebra)|cofactor]]. The determinant of ''A'' is given by\n\n:<math>\\det(A) = \\sum_{j=1}^n (-1)^{i+j} a_{ij} M_{ij}</math> (for a fixed <math>i</math>) <math>= \\sum_{i=1}^n (-1)^{i+j} a_{ij} M_{ij}</math> (for a fixed <math>j</math>)\n\nCalculating det(''A'') by means of this formula is referred to as expanding the determinant along a row, the ''i''th row using the first form with fixed ''i'', or expanding along a column, using the second form with fixed ''j''. For example, the Laplace expansion of the {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix\n:<math>A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n -2 & 2 & -3\\\\\n -1 & 1 &  3\\\\\n  2 & 0 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix},</math>\n\nalong the second column ({{nowrap|1=''j'' = 2}} and the sum runs over ''i'') is given by,\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\det(A) & = (-1)^{1+2}\\cdot 2 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}-1&3\\\\ 2 &-1\\end{vmatrix} + (-1)^{2+2}\\cdot 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}-2&-3\\\\[4pt]\n2&-1\\end{vmatrix} + (-1)^{3+2}\\cdot 0 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix}-2&-3\\\\ -1&3\\end{vmatrix} \\\\[4pt]\n& = (-2)\\cdot((-1)\\cdot(-1)-2\\cdot3)+1\\cdot((-2)\\cdot(-1)-2\\cdot(-3)) \\\\[4pt]\n& = (-2)\\cdot(-5)+8 = 18.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nHowever, Laplace expansion is efficient for small matrices only.\n\nThe [[adjugate matrix]] adj(''A'') is the transpose of the matrix consisting of the cofactors, i.e.,\n\n: <math>(\\operatorname{adj}(A))_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j} M_{ji}.</math>\n\nIn terms of the adjugate matrix, Laplace's expansion can be written as <ref>\u00a7&nbsp;0.8.2 of R.

Indeed, repeatedly applying the above identities yields\n\n:<math>\\det(A) = \\det(X)^{-1} \\det(B)\\det(X) = \\det(B) \\det(X)^{-1} \\det(X) = \\det(B).</math>\n\nThe determinant is therefore also called a [[similarity invariance|similarity invariant]]. The determinant of a [[linear transformation]]\n:<math>T : V \\rightarrow V</math>\nfor some finite-dimensional [[vector space]] ''V'' is defined to be the determinant of the matrix describing it, with respect to an arbitrary choice of [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] in ''V''. By the similarity invariance, this determinant is independent of the choice of the basis for ''V'' and therefore only depends on the endomorphism ''T''.\n\n=== Exterior algebra ===\n{{See also|Exterior algebra#Linear algebra}}\n\nThe determinant of a linear transformation {{nowrap|''T'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''V''}} of an ''n''-dimensional vector space ''V'' can be formulated in a coordinate-free manner by considering the ''n''th [[exterior algebra|exterior power]] \u039b<sup>''n''</sup>''V'' of ''V''. ''T'' induces a linear map\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n                \\Lambda^n T: \\Lambda^n V &\\rightarrow \\Lambda^n V \\\\\n  v_1 \\wedge v_2 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge v_n &\\mapsto T v_1 \\wedge T v_2 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge T v_n.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAs \u039b<sup>''n''</sup>''V'' is one-dimensional, the map \u039b<sup>''n''</sup>T is given by multiplying with some scalar. This scalar coincides with the determinant of ''T'', that is to say\n:<math>\\left(\\Lambda^n T\\right)\\left(v_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge v_n\\right) = \\det(T) \\cdot v_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge v_n.</math>\n\nThis definition agrees with the more concrete coordinate-dependent definition. In particular, for a square <math> n \\times n</math> matrix ''A'' whose columns are <math>\\mathbf{a_1}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{a_n} </math>, its determinant satisfies <math> \\mathbf{a_1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\mathbf{a_n} = \\det(A) \\cdot \\mathbf{e_1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\mathbf{e_n}</math>, where <math>\\{\\mathbf{e_1}, \\dots, \\mathbf{e_n}\\}</math> is the standard basis of <math> \\mathbb{R}^n </math>. This follows from the characterization of the determinant given above. For example, switching two columns changes the sign of the determinant; likewise, permuting the vectors in the exterior product {{nowrap|''v''<sub>1</sub> \u2227 ''v''<sub>2</sub> \u2227 ''v''<sub>3</sub> \u2227 \u2026 \u2227 ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>}} to {{nowrap|''v''<sub>2</sub> \u2227 ''v''<sub>1</sub> \u2227 ''v''<sub>3</sub> \u2227 \u2026 \u2227 ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>}}, say, also changes its sign.\n\nFor this reason, the highest non-zero exterior power \u039b<sup>''n''</sup>(''V'') is sometimes also called the determinant of ''V'' and similarly for more involved objects such as [[vector bundle]]s or [[chain complex]]es of vector spaces. Minors of a matrix can also be cast in this setting, by considering lower alternating forms \u039b<sup>''k''</sup>''V'' with {{nowrap|''k'' < ''n''}}.\n\n=== Square matrices over commutative rings and abstract properties ===\nThe determinant can also be characterized as the unique function\n:<math>D: M_n(K) \\to K</math>\nfrom the set of all {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices with entries in a field ''K'' to that field satisfying the following three properties: first, ''D'' is an [[Multilinear map|''n''-linear]] function: considering all but one column of ''A'' fixed, the determinant is linear in the remaining column, that is\n:<math>D (v_1, \\dots, v_{i-1}, a v_i + b w, v_{i+1}, \\dots, v_n) = a D (v_1, \\dots, v_{i-1}, v_i, v_{i+1}, \\dots, v_n) + b D (v_1, \\dots, v_{i-1}, w, v_{i+1}, \\dots, v_n)</math>\nfor any column vectors ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''v''<sub>''n''</sub>, and ''w'' and any scalars (elements of ''K'') ''a'' and ''b''. Second, ''D'' is an [[alternating form|alternating]] function: for any matrix ''A'' with two identical columns, {{nowrap|1=''D''(''A'') = 0}}. Finally, {{nowrap|1=''D''(''I''<sub>''n''</sub>) = 1}}, where ''I''<sub>''n''</sub> is the identity matrix.\n\nThis fact also implies that every other ''n''-linear alternating function {{nowrap|''F'': M<sub>''n''</sub>(''K'') \u2192 ''K''}} satisfies\n:<math>F(M)=F(I)D(M).</math>\n\nThis definition can also be extended where ''K'' is a [[commutative ring]] ''R'', in which case a matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is an [[Unit (ring theory)|invertible element]] in ''R''. For example, a matrix ''A'' with entries in '''Z''', the integers, is invertible (in the sense that there exists an inverse matrix with integer entries) if the determinant is +1 or \u22121. Such a matrix is called [[unimodular matrix|unimodular]].\n\nThe determinant defines a mapping\n:<math>\\operatorname{GL}_n(R) \\rightarrow R^\\times, </math>\nbetween the group of invertible {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices with entries in ''R'' and the [[multiplicative group]] of units in ''R''. Since it respects the multiplication in both groups, this map is a [[group homomorphism]]. Secondly, given a [[ring homomorphism]] {{nowrap|''f'': ''R'' \u2192 ''S''}}, there is a map {{nowrap|''GL<sub>n</sub>(f)'': GL<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'') \u2192 GL<sub>''n''</sub>(''S'')}} given by replacing all entries in ''R'' by their images under ''f''. The determinant respects these maps, i.e., given a matrix {{nowrap|1=''A'' = (''a''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub>)}} with entries in ''R'', the identity\n:<math>f(\\det((a_{i,j}))) = \\det ((f(a_{i,j})))</math>\nholds. In other words, the following diagram commutes:\n\n:[[Image:Determinant as a natural transformation.svg|300px]]\n\nFor example, the determinant of the [[complex conjugate]] of a complex matrix (which is also the determinant of its conjugate transpose) is the complex conjugate of its determinant, and for integer matrices: the reduction modulo&nbsp;''m'' of the determinant of such a matrix is equal to the determinant of the matrix reduced modulo&nbsp;''m'' (the latter determinant being computed using [[modular arithmetic]]). In the language of [[category theory]], the determinant is a [[natural transformation]] between the two functors GL<sub>''n''</sub> and (\u22c5)<sup>\u00d7</sup> (see also [[Natural transformation#Determinant]]).<ref>{{Citation|last=Mac Lane|first=Saunders|title=Categories for the Working Mathematician|volume=|pages=|year=1998|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics '''5'''|edition=2nd|publisher=Springer-Verlag|isbn=0-387-98403-8|authorlink=Saunders Mac Lane|title-link=Categories for the Working Mathematician}}</ref> Adding yet another layer of abstraction, this is captured by saying that the determinant is a morphism of [[algebraic group]]s, from the general linear group to the [[multiplicative group]],\n:<math>\\det: \\operatorname{GL}_n \\rightarrow \\mathbb G_m.</math>\n\n== Generalizations and related notions ==\n\n=== Infinite matrices ===\nFor matrices with an infinite number of rows and columns, the above definitions of the determinant do not carry over directly. For example, in the Leibniz formula, an infinite sum (all of whose terms are infinite products) would have to be calculated. [[Functional analysis]] provides different extensions of the determinant for such infinite-dimensional situations, which however only work for particular kinds of operators.\n\nThe [[Fredholm determinant]] defines the determinant for operators known as [[trace class operator]]s by an appropriate generalization of the formula\n:<math>\\det(I+A) = \\exp(\\operatorname{tr}(\\log(I+A))). </math>\n\nAnother infinite-dimensional notion of determinant is the [[functional determinant]].\n\n===Operators in von Neumann algebras===\nFor operators in a finite [[von Neumann algebra#Factors|factor]], one may define a positive real-valued determinant called the [[Fuglede\u2212Kadison determinant]] using the canonical trace. In fact, corresponding to every [[State (functional analysis)#tracial state|tracial state]] on a [[von Neumann algebra]] there is a notion of Fuglede\u2212Kadison determinant.\n\n=== Related notions for non-commutative rings ===\nFor square matrices with entries in a non-commutative ring, there are various difficulties in defining determinants analogously to that for commutative rings. A meaning can be given to the Leibniz formula provided that the order for the product is specified, and similarly for other definitions of the determinant, but non-commutativity then leads to the loss of many fundamental properties of the determinant, such as  the multiplicative property or the fact that the determinant is unchanged under transposition of the matrix. Over non-commutative rings, there is no reasonable notion of a multilinear form (existence of a nonzero {{clarify span|text=bilinear form|explain=What exactly is meant by this term must be specified.  This statement is valid only if the bilinear form is required to be linear on the same side for both arguments; in contrast, Bourbaki defines a bilinear form B as having the property B(ax,yb) = aB(x,y)b, i.e., left-linear in the left argument and right-linear in the other.|date=October 2017}} with a [[Regular element (ring theory)|regular element]] of ''R'' as value on some pair of arguments implies that ''R'' is commutative). Nevertheless, various notions of non-commutative determinant have been formulated that preserve some of the properties of determinants, notably [[quasideterminant]]s and the [[Dieudonn\u00e9 determinant]]. For some classes of matrices with non-commutative elements, one can define the determinant and prove linear algebra theorems that are very similar to their commutative analogs. Examples include the ''q''-determinant on quantum groups, the [[Capelli determinant]] on Capelli matrices, and the [[Berezinian]] on [[supermatrices]]. [[Manin matrices]] form the class closest to matrices with commutative elements.\n\n=== Further variants ===\nDeterminants of matrices in [[superring]]s (that is, Z<sub>2</sub>-[[graded ring]]s) are known as [[Berezinian]]s or superdeterminants.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/?id=sZ1-G4hQgIIC&pg=PA116&dq=Berezinian#v=onepage&q=Berezinian&f=false | title = Supersymmetry for mathematicians: An introduction | isbn = 978-0-8218-3574-6 | last1 = Varadarajan | first1 = V.

The [[immanant of a matrix|immanant]] generalizes both by introducing a [[character theory|character]] of the [[symmetric group]] S<sub>''n''</sub> in Leibniz's rule.\n\n== Calculation ==\nDeterminants are mainly used as a theoretical tool. They are rarely calculated explicitly in [[numerical linear algebra]], where for applications like checking invertibility and finding eigenvalues the determinant has largely been supplanted by other techniques.<ref name=Trefethen>L.

Bau, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JaPtxOytY7kC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=determinant&f=false Numerical Linear Algebra]'' (SIAM, 1997). e.g. in Lecture 1: \"... we mention that the determinant, though a convenient notion theoretically, rarely finds a useful role in numerical algorithms.\"</ref> [[Computational geometry]], however, does frequently use calculations related to determinants.<ref>\nA survey of state-of-the-art algorithms for computing determinants and their advantages and disadvantages including results of performance tests, is included in\n{{cite journal\n | last1 = Fisikopoulos | first1 = Vissarion\n | last2 = Pe\u00f1aranda | first2 = Luis\n | title = Faster geometric algorithms via dynamic determinant computation\n | journal = Computational Geometry\n | volume = 54\n | pages = 1\u201316\n | publisher = Elsevier B.

Both these approaches are extremely inefficient for large matrices, though, since the number of required operations grows very quickly: it is [[Big O notation|of order]] ''n''! (''n'' [[factorial]]) for an {{nowrap|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix ''M''. For example, Leibniz's formula requires calculating ''n''! products. Therefore, more involved techniques have been developed for calculating determinants.\n\n=== Decomposition methods ===\nGiven a matrix ''A'', some methods compute its determinant by writing ''A'' as a product of matrices whose determinants can be more easily computed. Such techniques are referred to as decomposition methods. Examples include the [[LU decomposition]], the [[QR decomposition]] or the [[Cholesky decomposition]] (for [[Positive definite matrix|positive definite matrices]]). These methods are of order O(''n''<sup>3</sup>), which is a significant improvement over O(''n''!)\n\nThe LU decomposition expresses ''A'' in terms of a lower triangular matrix ''L'', an upper triangular matrix ''U'' and a [[permutation matrix]] ''P'':\n:<math> A = PLU. </math>\nThe determinants of ''L'' and ''U'' can be quickly calculated, since they are the products of the respective diagonal entries.  The determinant of ''P'' is just the sign <math>\\varepsilon</math> of the corresponding permutation (which is +1 for an even number of permutations and is \u22121 for an uneven number of permutations). The determinant of ''A'' is then\n\n:<math> \\det(A) = \\varepsilon \\det(L)\\cdot\\det(U). </math>\n\n(See [[determinant identities]].) Moreover, the decomposition can be chosen such that ''L'' is a [[unitriangular matrix]] and therefore has determinant&nbsp;1, in which case the formula further simplifies to\n\n:<math> \\det(A) = \\varepsilon\\det(U).</math>\n\n=== Further methods ===\nIf the determinant of ''A'' and the inverse of ''A'' have already been computed, the [[matrix determinant lemma]] allows rapid calculation of the determinant of {{nowrap|''A'' + ''uv''<sup>T</sup>}}, where ''u'' and ''v'' are column vectors.\n\nSince the definition of the determinant does not need divisions, a question arises: do fast algorithms exist that do not need divisions? This is especially interesting for matrices over rings. Indeed, algorithms with run-time proportional to ''n''<sup>4</sup> exist. An algorithm of Mahajan and Vinay, and Berkowitz<ref>http://page.inf.fu-berlin.de/~rote/Papers/pdf/Division-free+algorithms.pdf</ref> is based on [[closed ordered walk]]s (short ''clow''). It computes more products than the determinant definition requires, but some of these products cancel and the sum of these products can be computed more efficiently. The final algorithm looks very much like an iterated product of triangular matrices.\n\nIf two matrices of order ''n'' can be multiplied in time ''M''(''n''), where {{nowrap|''M''(''n'') \u2265 ''n''<sup>''a''</sup>}} for some {{nowrap|''a'' > 2}}, then the determinant can be computed in time O(''M''(''n'')).<ref>{{cite journal |first=J.

Unfortunately this interesting method does not always work in its original form.\n\nAlgorithms can also be assessed according to their [[bit complexity]], i.e., how many bits of accuracy are needed to store intermediate values occurring in the computation. For example, the [[Gaussian elimination]] (or LU decomposition) method is of order O(''n''<sup>3</sup>), but the bit length of intermediate values can become exponentially long.<ref>{{Cite conference\n  | first1 = Xin Gui\n  | last1 = Fang\n  | first2 = George\n  | last2 = Havas\n  | title = On the worst-case complexity of integer Gaussian elimination\n  | booktitle = Proceedings of the 1997 international symposium on Symbolic and algebraic computation\n  | conference = ISSAC '97\n  | pages = 28\u201331\n  | publisher = ACM\n  | year = 1997\n  | location = Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States\n  | url = http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/gilles.villard/BIBLIOGRAPHIE/PDF/ft_gateway.cfm.pdf\n  | doi = 10.1145/258726.258740\n  | isbn = 0-89791-875-4\n  | access-date = 2011-01-22\n  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110807042828/http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/gilles.villard/BIBLIOGRAPHIE/PDF/ft_gateway.cfm.pdf\n  | archive-date = 2011-08-07\n  | url-status = dead\n  }}</ref> The [[Bareiss Algorithm]], on the other hand, is an exact-division method based on [[Sylvester's determinant theorem|Sylvester's identity]] is also of order ''n''<sup>3</sup>, but the bit complexity is roughly the bit size of the original entries in the matrix times ''n''.<ref>{{citation|first=Erwin|last=Bareiss|title= Sylvester's Identity and Multistep Integer-Preserving Gaussian Elimination|pages=565\u2013578|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1968-22-103/S0025-5718-1968-0226829-0/S0025-5718-1968-0226829-0.pdf|journal=Mathematics of Computation|year=1968|volume=22|issue=102|doi=10.2307/2004533|jstor=2004533}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, determinants were used long before matrices: originally, a determinant was defined as a property of a [[system of linear equations]]. \nThe determinant \"determines\" whether the system has a unique solution (which occurs precisely if the determinant is non-zero). \nIn this sense, determinants were first used in the Chinese mathematics textbook ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' (\u4e5d\u7ae0\u7b97\u8853, Chinese scholars, around the 3rd century BCE). \nIn Europe, {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} determinants were considered by [[Gerolamo Cardano|Cardano]] at the end of the 16th century and larger ones by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]].<ref name=\"Campbell\" /><ref name=\"Eves\">Eves, H: \"An Introduction to the History of Mathematics\", pages 405, 493\u2013494, Saunders College Publishing, 1990.</ref><ref>A Brief History of Linear Algebra and Matrix Theory : {{cite web |url=http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~vitulli/441.sp04/LinAlgHistory.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910034016/http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~vitulli/441.sp04/LinAlgHistory.html |archivedate=2012-09-10 }}</ref><ref>Cajori, F.

Immediately following, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] (1773) treated determinants of the second and third order and applied it to questions of [[elimination theory]]; he proved many special cases of general identities.\n\n[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] (1801) made the next advance. Like Lagrange, he made much use of determinants in the [[theory of numbers]]. He introduced the word '''''determinant''''' (Laplace had used ''resultant''), though not in the present signification, but rather as applied to the [[discriminant]] of a [[algebraic form|quantic]]. Gauss also arrived at the notion of reciprocal (inverse) determinants, and came very near the multiplication theorem.\n\nThe next contributor of importance is [[Jacques Philippe Marie Binet|Binet]] (1811, 1812), who formally stated the theorem relating to the product of two matrices of ''m'' columns and ''n'' rows, which for the special case of {{nowrap|1=''m'' = ''n''}} reduces to the multiplication theorem. On the same day (November 30, 1812) that Binet presented his paper to the Academy, [[Cauchy]] also presented one on the subject. (See [[Cauchy\u2013Binet formula]].) In this he used the word '''''determinant''''' in its present sense,<ref>The first use of the word \"determinant\" in the modern sense appeared in: Cauchy, Augustin-Louis \"Memoire sur les fonctions qui ne peuvent obtenir que deux valeurs \u00e9gales et des signes contraires par suite des transpositions oper\u00e9es entre les variables qu'elles renferment,\" which was first read at the Institute de France in Paris on November 30, 1812, and which was subsequently published in the ''Journal de l'Ecole Polytechnique'', Cahier 17, Tome 10, pages 29\u2013112 (1815).</ref><ref>Origins of mathematical terms: http://jeff560.tripod.com/d.html</ref> summarized and simplified what was then known on the subject, improved the notation, and gave the multiplication theorem with a proof more satisfactory than Binet's.<ref name=\"Campbell\" /><ref>History of matrices and determinants: http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Matrices_and_determinants.html</ref> With him begins the theory in its generality.\n\nThe next important figure was [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi|Jacobi]]<ref name=\"Eves\" /> (from 1827). He early used the functional determinant which Sylvester later called the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]], and in his memoirs in ''[[Crelle's Journal]]'' for 1841 he specially treats this subject, as well as the class of alternating functions which Sylvester has called ''alternants''. About the time of Jacobi's last memoirs, [[James Joseph Sylvester|Sylvester]] (1839) and [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] began their work.<ref>The first use of vertical lines to denote a determinant appeared in: Cayley, Arthur \"On a theorem in the geometry of position,\" ''Cambridge Mathematical Journal'', vol. 2, pages 267\u2013271 (1841).</ref><ref>History of matrix notation: http://jeff560.tripod.com/matrices.html</ref>\n\nThe study of special forms of determinants has been the natural result of the completion of the general theory. Axisymmetric determinants have been studied by [[Lebesgue]], [[Otto Hesse|Hesse]], and Sylvester; [[persymmetric]] determinants by Sylvester and [[Hermann Hankel|Hankel]]; [[circulant]]s by [[Eug\u00e8ne Charles Catalan|Catalan]], [[William Spottiswoode|Spottiswoode]], [[James Whitbread Lee Glaisher|Glaisher]], and Scott; skew determinants and [[Pfaffian]]s, in connection with the theory of [[orthogonal transformation]], by Cayley; continuants by Sylvester; [[Wronskian]]s (so called by [[Thomas Muir (mathematician)|Muir]]) by [[Elwin Bruno Christoffel|Christoffel]] and [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius|Frobenius]]; compound determinants by Sylvester, Reiss, and Picquet; Jacobians and [[Hessian matrix|Hessians]] by Sylvester; and symmetric gauche determinants by [[Trudi]]. Of the textbooks on the subject Spottiswoode's was the first. In America, Hanus (1886), Weld (1893), and Muir/Metzler (1933) published treatises.\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Linear independence ===\nAs mentioned above, the determinant of a matrix (with real or complex entries, say) is zero if and only if the column vectors (or the row vectors) of the matrix are linearly dependent. Thus, determinants can be used to characterize linearly dependent vectors. For example, given two linearly independent vectors ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub> in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>, a third vector ''v''<sub>3</sub> lies in the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] [[Linear span|spanned]] by the former two vectors exactly if the determinant of the {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix consisting of the three vectors is zero. The same idea is also used in the theory of [[differential equation]]s: given ''n'' functions ''f''<sub>1</sub>(''x''), \u2026, ''f''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'') (supposed to be {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}} times differentiable), the [[Wronskian]] is defined to be\n:<math>W(f_1, \\ldots, f_n)(x) =\n  \\begin{vmatrix}\n            f_1(x) &         f_2(x) & \\cdots &         f_n(x) \\\\\n           f_1'(x) &        f_2'(x) & \\cdots &        f_n'(x) \\\\\n            \\vdots &         \\vdots & \\ddots &         \\vdots \\\\\n    f_1^{(n-1)}(x) & f_2^{(n-1)}(x) & \\cdots & f_n^{(n-1)}(x)\n\\end{vmatrix}.</math>\n\nIt is non-zero (for some ''x'') in a specified interval if and only if the given functions and all their derivatives up to order ''n''\u22121 are linearly independent. If it can be shown that the Wronskian is zero everywhere on an interval then, in the case of [[analytic function]]s, this implies the given functions are linearly dependent. See [[Wronskian#The Wronskian and linear independence|the Wronskian and linear independence]].\n\n=== Orientation of a basis ===\n{{Main|Orientation (vector space)}}\nThe determinant can be thought of as assigning a number to every [[sequence]] of ''n'' vectors in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, by using the square matrix whose columns are the given vectors. For instance, an [[orthogonal matrix]] with entries in '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> represents an [[orthonormal basis]] in [[Euclidean space]]. The determinant of such a matrix determines whether the [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] of the basis is consistent with or opposite to the orientation of the [[standard basis]]. If the determinant is +1, the basis has the same orientation. If it is \u22121, the basis has the opposite orientation.\n\nMore generally, if the determinant of ''A'' is positive, ''A'' represents an orientation-preserving [[linear transformation]] (if ''A'' is an orthogonal {{nowrap|2 \u00d7 2}} or {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 3}} matrix, this is a [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]), while if it is negative, ''A'' switches the orientation of the basis.\n\n=== Volume and Jacobian determinant ===\nAs pointed out above, the [[absolute value]] of the determinant of real vectors is equal to the volume of the [[parallelepiped]] spanned by those vectors. As a consequence, if {{nowrap|''f'' : '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is the linear map represented by the matrix ''A'', and ''S'' is any [[Lebesgue measure|measurable]] [[subset]] of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, then the volume of ''f''(''S'') is given by {{abs|det(''A'')}} times the volume of ''S''. More generally, if the linear map {{nowrap|''f'' : '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup>}} is represented by the {{nowrap|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix ''A'', then the ''n''-[[dimension]]al volume of ''f''(''S'') is given by:\n:<math>\\operatorname{volume}(f(S)) = \\sqrt{\\det\\left(A^\\textsf{T} A\\right)} \\times \\operatorname{volume}(S).</math>\n\nBy calculating the volume of the [[tetrahedron]] bounded by four points, they can be used to identify [[skew line]]s.
