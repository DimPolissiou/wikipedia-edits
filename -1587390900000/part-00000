This is a theoretical alternative which is based on the concept of price differentiation (Finon). Under such a policy the tariff price ranges from some level slightly above the spot rate to the price required to obtain the optimal level of production determined by the government. Firms with lower marginal costs receive prices on the lower end of the spectrum that increase their revenue but not by as much as under the uniform feed-in tariff. The more marginal producers face the higher tariff price. This version of the policy has two objectives. The first is to reduce the profitability of certain production sites.\n\nMany renewable sources are highly dependent on their location. For example, wind turbines are most profitable in windy locations, and solar plants are best at sunny locations. This means that generators tend to be concentrated at these most profitable sites. The differentiated tariff seeks to make less naturally productive sites more profitable and so spread out the generators which many consider to be an undesirable good in the area (Finon). Imagine cutting down all the forests to build wind farms; this would not be good for the environment. This, however, leads to a less cost-effective production of renewable electricity as the most efficient sites are under-utilized. The other goal of tariffs differentiated by marginal cost is to reduce the cost of the program (Finon). Under the uniform tariff all producers receive the same price which is at times in gross excess of the price needed to incentivize them to produce. The additional revenue translates into profit. Thus, the differentiated tariff attempts to give each producer what it requires to maintain production so that the optimal market quantity of renewable energy production can be reached (Finon).<ref>{{cite journal|author=Finon, Dominique and Menanteau, Philippe |year=2004|title=The Static and Dynamic Efficiency of Instruments of Promotion of Renewables|journal= Energy Studies Review|volume=12|doi=10.15173/esr.v12i1.453|url=http://www2.centre-cired.fr/IMG/pdf/ACL15.pdf }}</ref>\n\nOverall, and in light of incipient globalization, feed-in tariffs are posing increasing problems from the point of view of trade, as their implementation in one country can easily affect industries and policies of others, thus requiring an ideally global coordination of treatment and imposition of such policy instrument, which could be reached at the World Trade Organization.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|last2=Cima|first2=Elena|title=World Trade Organization, Renewable Energy Subsidies and the Case of Feed-In Tariffs: Time for Reform Toward Sustainable Development?|journal=Georgetown International Environmental Law Review (GIELR)|date=2015|volume= 27|issue= 1|ssrn=2704398|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Compensation===\n[[File:Feed-in Tariff meter connections.png|thumb|Understanding Feed-in Tariff and [[Power Purchase Agreement|Power Purchase Agreement]] meter connections]]\nThere are three methods of compensation.\n*Feed-in tariff&nbsp;\u2013 compensation is above retail, and as the percentage of adopters increases, the FIT is reduced to the retail rate.\n*[[Net metering]]&nbsp;\u2013 allows producers to consume electricity from the grid, e.g., when the wind stops.

The purpose of the National Energy Act was to encourage [[energy conservation]] and develop new energy resources, including [[renewable]]s such as wind, solar and geothermal power.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.gsm.uci.edu/~navarro/windfinal110899.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080909231828/http://web.gsm.uci.edu/~navarro/windfinal110899.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 September 2008 |title=Policy Options for Promoting Wind Energy Development in California: A Report to the Governor and State Legislature |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name=\"Hirsh, R.

F. 1999 pp. 60-72\"/> Avoided costs were designed to reflect the cost that a utility would incur to provide that same electrical generation. Different interpretations of PURPA prevailed in the 1980s: some utilities and state utility commissions interpreted avoided costs narrowly to mean avoided fuel costs, while others chose to define \"avoided costs\" as the \"avoided long-run marginal cost\" of generation.<ref name=\"Hirsh, R. F. 1999 pp. 60-72\"/> The long-run costs referred to the anticipated cost of electricity in the years ahead. This last approach was adopted by California in its Standard Offer Contract No. 4.<ref>Guey Lee, L. (1999). Korean Energy Economics Institute (KEEI).

F. 1999 pp. 60-72\"/>\n\nTo comply with PURPA, some states began offering Standard Offer Contracts to producers. California's Public Utility Commission established a number of Standard Offer Contracts, including Standard Offer No.4 (SO4), which made use of fixed prices, based on the expected long-run cost of generation. The long-run estimates of electricity costs were based on the belief (widely held at the time) that oil and gas prices would continue to increase.<ref name=\"boell.org\">Rickerson, W.; Grace, R.C.

By 1992, private power producers had installed approximately 1,700 MW of wind capacity in California, some of which is still in service today. The adoption of PURPA also led to significant renewable energy generation in states such as Florida, and Maine.<ref name=\"Hirsh, R. F. 1999 pp. 60-72\"/>\n\nThis notwithstanding, PURPA retains negative connotations in the U.S. electricity industry. When oil and gas prices plummeted in the late 1980s, the Standard Offer Contracts that were signed to encourage new renewable energy development seemed high by comparison. As a result, PURPA contracts came to be seen as an expensive burden on electricity ratepayers.<ref name=\"boell.org\"/>\n\nAnother source of opposition to PURPA stemmed from the fact that it was designed to encourage non-utility generation. This was interpreted as a threat by many large utilities, particularly monopolistic suppliers. As a result of its encouragement of non-utility generation, PURPA has also been interpreted as an important step toward increasing competition.<ref name=\"Hirsh, R.

Bonus\n|-\n| >25% || 200%\n|-\n| 20% to 25% || 180%\n|-\n| 15% to 20% || 160%\n|-\n| 10% to 15% || 140%\n|-\n| 5% to 10% || 100%\n|-\n| 0 to 5% || 0\n|}\n\nThe price of electricity is fixed by the CREG (Gas and Electricity Regulatory Commission). According to the last decision which fixed it, the consumer pays his electricity as below:\n\n* 1.77 DZD/kWh for a consumption which is lower than 41.6 kWh/month.\n* 4.17 DZD/kWh for a consumption which is higher than 41.6 kWh/month.\n\nThe other consumers (industry, agriculture...etc.), they pay 4.17 DZD/kWh.\n\nThe feed-in tariff provides bonuses for electricity generated by cogeneration of 160%, taking into account thermal energy use of 20% of all primary energy used. The bonuses for solar generated electricity and cogeneration are cumulative. Remuneration of the generated electricity is guaranteed over the whole plant lifetime.\n\n===Australia===\n{{Main|Feed-in tariffs in Australia}}\nFeed-in tariffs were introduced in 2008 in [[South Australia]] and [[Queensland]], 2009 in the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and 2010 in [[New South Wales]], [[Tasmania]] and [[Western Australia]].

For non-residential installations of less than 200 kilowatts of installed generation capacity, the price rises to 0.901 EGP/KWh.

The first phase of this program targeted 1,000 MW, by paying a tariff fixed by the [[Central Electricity Regulatory Commission]] (CERC) of India. While in spirit this is a feed-in tariff, several conditions affect project size and commissioning date. The tariff for solar PV projects is fixed at {{INR}}17.90 (US$0.397)/kWh. Tariff for solar thermal projects is fixed {{INR}}15.40 (US$0.342/kWh). Tariff will be reviewed periodically by the CERC. In 2015, the feed-in tariff is about {{INR}}7.50 (US$0.125)/kWh and is mostly applicable at utility level. The feed-in tariff for roof top PV plants is still not applicable.\n\n===Indonesia===\nThe Indonesian government, operating mainly through the [[Perusahaan Listrik Negara|State Electricity Corporation]] (''Perusahaan Listrik Negara, or PLN''), encouraged independent power producers (IPPs) to invest in the electric power sector. Numerous IPPs are investing in large plants (over 500 MW) and many smaller plants (such as 200 MW and smaller). To support this investment, [[Power Purchase Agreement|power purchase agreement]] (PPA) arrangements are agreed with the PLN. Prices vary widely from relatively low prices for large coal-based plants such as the [[Cirebon Steam Power Plant|Cirebon coal plant]] which began operations in late 2012 to higher prices for smaller geothermal plants producing more expensive power from distant locations such as the [[Wayang Windu Geothermal Power Station|Wayang Windu]] geothermal plant in [[West Java]]. Indonesia has made a range of different FIT Regulations for different forms of renewable electricity generation, for example geothermal energy and solar photovoltaic electricity generation. These regulations mandate the price that should be paid by PLN to the IPP in various different circumstances, provided that preconditions are met.\n\n===Iran===\nThe Renewable Energy Organization of Iran (SUNA; [[\u0633\u0627\u0646\u0627]]) first introduced a feed-in tariff in 2008.

Under this incentive program, systems are paid for the kilowatt-hours (kWh) generated over a 15-year period, at a rate set at the time a system is enrolled in the program. The Oregon Public Utility Commission (PUC) established rates and rules in May 2010. This program was offered by the three investor-owned utilities in Oregon and administered by the utilities. The PUC planned to periodically re-evaluate rates. Program costs were recoverable in utility rates and utility-owned systems were not eligible for the incentive.\n\nThe pilot program installation cap was limited to an aggregate cap of 25 megawatts (MW) of solar photovoltaics (PV), with a maximum system size cap of 500 kilowatts (kW). The aggregate program cap was to be spread equally over four years, with 6.25 MW of capacity being eligible to receive the incentive each year. The aggregate cap was divided, based on 2008 retail sales revenue. PGE had a cap of 14.9 MW, Pacific Power 9.8 MW, and Idaho Power 0.4 MW. Idaho Power's program was limited to residential installations. Rates differed by system size and geographic zone. Small- and medium-scale systems participated in a program modeled after net metering. Larger-scale systems were competitively bid. Participating PV systems must be grid-connected, metered and meet all applicable codes and regulations. Systems must be \"permanently installed\".\n\nSystems sized 100&nbsp;kW or less could participate based on net metering. Generating capacity of 20 MW of the aggregate cap was reserved for the net metering portion, with 12 MW available for residential and 8 MW available for small commercial systems. These residential and small commercial systems were paid for the amount of electricity generated, up to the amount of electricity consumed. In essence, customers were paid for the amount of utility electric load consumption that is offset by onsite generation. Unlike typical feed-in tariffs, customers can consume the electricity generated on-site and receive a production incentive \u2013 or a volumetric incentive payment \u2013 for the amount of electricity generated and consumed. To remove a [[perverse incentive]] to increase electricity consumption to receive a greater payment, the system had to be appropriately sized to meet average electricity consumption. Rates were determined by the PUC based on annual system cost and annual energy output, differentiated by geographic zones. The cost estimates were based on installation data from [[Energy Trust of Oregon]]. The actual rates paid to the customer-generator were the volumetric incentive rate minus the retail rate.

This is a theoretical alternative which is based on the concept of price differentiation (Finon). Under such a policy the tariff price ranges from some level slightly above the spot rate to the price required to obtain the optimal level of production determined by the government. Firms with lower marginal costs receive prices on the lower end of the spectrum that increase their revenue but not by as much as under the uniform feed-in tariff. The more marginal producers face the higher tariff price. This version of the policy has two objectives. The first is to reduce the profitability of certain production sites.\n\nMany renewable sources are highly dependent on their location. For example, wind turbines are most profitable in windy locations, and solar plants are best at sunny locations. This means that generators tend to be concentrated at these most profitable sites. The differentiated tariff seeks to make less naturally productive sites more profitable and so spread out the generators which many consider to be an undesirable good in the area (Finon). Imagine cutting down all the forests to build wind farms; this would not be good for the environment. This, however, leads to a less cost-effective production of renewable electricity as the most efficient sites are under-utilized. The other goal of tariffs differentiated by marginal cost is to reduce the cost of the program (Finon). Under the uniform tariff all producers receive the same price which is at times in gross excess of the price needed to incentivize them to produce. The additional revenue translates into profit. Thus, the differentiated tariff attempts to give each producer what it requires to maintain production so that the optimal market quantity of renewable energy production can be reached (Finon).<ref>{{cite journal|author=Finon, Dominique and Menanteau, Philippe |year=2004|title=The Static and Dynamic Efficiency of Instruments of Promotion of Renewables|journal= Energy Studies Review|volume=12|doi=10.15173/esr.v12i1.453|url=http://www2.centre-cired.fr/IMG/pdf/ACL15.pdf }}</ref>\n\nOverall, and in light of incipient globalization, feed-in tariffs are posing increasing problems from the point of view of trade, as their implementation in one country can easily affect industries and policies of others, thus requiring an ideally global coordination of treatment and imposition of such policy instrument, which could be reached at the World Trade Organization.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|last2=Cima|first2=Elena|title=World Trade Organization, Renewable Energy Subsidies and the Case of Feed-In Tariffs: Time for Reform Toward Sustainable Development?|journal=Georgetown International Environmental Law Review (GIELR)|date=2015|volume= 27|issue= 1|ssrn=2704398|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Compensation===\n[[File:Feed-in Tariff meter connections.png|thumb|Understanding Feed-in Tariff and [[Power Purchase Agreement|Power Purchase Agreement]] meter connections]]\nThere are three methods of compensation.\n*Feed-in tariff&nbsp;\u2013 compensation is above retail, and as the percentage of adopters increases, the FIT is reduced to the retail rate.\n*[[Net metering]]&nbsp;\u2013 allows producers to consume electricity from the grid, e.g., when the wind stops.

Different interpretations of PURPA prevailed in the 1980s: some utilities and state utility commissions interpreted avoided costs narrowly to mean avoided fuel costs, while others chose to define \"avoided costs\" as the \"avoided long-run marginal cost\" of generation.<ref name=\"Hirsh, R. F. 1999 pp. 60-72\"/> The long-run costs referred to the anticipated cost of electricity in the years ahead. This last approach was adopted by California in its Standard Offer Contract No. 4.<ref>Guey Lee, L. (1999). Korean Energy Economics Institute (KEEI).

F. 1999 pp. 60-72\"/>\n\nTo comply with PURPA, some states began offering Standard Offer Contracts to producers. California's Public Utility Commission established a number of Standard Offer Contracts, including Standard Offer No.4 (SO4), which made use of fixed prices, based on the expected long-run cost of generation. The long-run estimates of electricity costs were based on the belief (widely held at the time) that oil and gas prices would continue to increase.<ref name=\"boell.org\">Rickerson, W.; Grace, R.C.

By 1992, private power producers had installed approximately 1,700 MW of wind capacity in California, some of which is still in service today. The adoption of PURPA also led to significant renewable energy generation in states such as Florida, and Maine.<ref name=\"Hirsh, R. F. 1999 pp. 60-72\"/>\n\nThis notwithstanding, PURPA retains negative connotations in the U.S. electricity industry. When oil and gas prices plummeted in the late 1980s, the Standard Offer Contracts that were signed to encourage new renewable energy development seemed high by comparison. As a result, PURPA contracts came to be seen as an expensive burden on electricity ratepayers.<ref name=\"boell.org\"/>\n\nAnother source of opposition to PURPA stemmed from the fact that it was designed to encourage non-utility generation. This was interpreted as a threat by many large utilities, particularly monopolistic suppliers. As a result of its encouragement of non-utility generation, PURPA has also been interpreted as an important step toward increasing competition.<ref name=\"Hirsh, R.

For non-residential installations of less than 200 kilowatts of installed generation capacity, the price rises to 0.901 EGP/KWh. The third category, between 200 and 500 kilowatts, will be paid 0.973 EGP/KWh. The fourth and fifth categories of non-residential installations are paid in USD, to attract foreign investments, with the fourth category, ranging from 500 kilowatts to 20 megawatts, paid US$0.136/KWh (with 15% of tariff pegged at the exchange rate of 7.15 EGP per USD). The last category, which stretches between 20\u201350 MW, will be paid US$0.1434/KWh. On the other hand, the purchase price for power generated from wind is based on the number of operating hours and is more elaborate than the solar tariff. It covers operating hours ranging from 2500 up through 4000 hours, with decreasing purchase rates ranging from US$0.1148/KWh down to US$0.046/KWh.\n\nIn the second phase, the categories of solar generation were reduced to four, with the residential category tariff increased to 1.0288 EGP/KWh. The second category, non-residential installations of less than 500 KW has a purchase price of 1.0858 EGP/KWh. The third and fourth categories, non-residential installations between 500 KW and 20 MW and between 20 MW and 50 MW, have a purchase tariff of US$0.0788/KWh and US$0.084/KWh, respectively (with 30% of tariff pegged at the exchange rate of 8.88 EGP per USD).<ref>[http://shahidlaw.com/2016/09/06/egyptian-feed-in-tariff-programme-update-on-06-september-2016/ Egyptian Feed-In Tariff Programme Update on 06 September 2016].

The first phase of this program targeted 1000 MW, by paying a tariff fixed by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission [[Central Electricity Regulatory Commission|(CERC)]] of India. While in spirit this is a feed in tariff, several conditions affect project size and commissioning date. The tariff for solar PV projects is fixed at Rs. 17.90 (US$0.397)/kWh. Tariff for solar thermal projects is fixed Rs. 15.40 (US$0.342/kWh). Tariff will be reviewed periodically by the CERC. In 2015, the feed in tariff is about Rs. 7.50 (US$0.125)/kWh and is mostly applicable at utility level.

Numerous IPPs are investing in large plants (over 500 MW) and many smaller plants (such as 200 MW and smaller). To support this investment, [[Power Purchase Agreement|power purchase agreement]] (PPA) arrangements are agreed with the PLN. Prices vary widely from relatively low prices for large coal-based plants such as the [[Cirebon Steam Power Plant|Cirebon coal plant]] which began operations in late 2012 to higher prices for smaller geothermal plants producing more expensive power from distant locations such as the [[Wayang Windu Geothermal Power Station|Wayang Windu]] geothermal plant in [[West Java]].

The tariffs were substantially higher than those in NERSA's original proposal. The tariffs, differentiated by technology, were to be paid for 20 years.\n\nNERSA said in its release that the tariffs were based on the cost of generation plus a reasonable profit. The tariffs for wind energy and concentrating solar power were among the most attractive worldwide.\n\nThe tariff for wind energy, 1.25 ZAR/kWh (\u20ac0.104/kWh) was greater than that offered in Germany and more than proposed in Ontario, Canada.\n\nThe tariff for concentrating solar, 2.10 ZAR/kWh, was less than that in Spain. NERSA's revised program followed extensive public consultation.\n\nStefan Gs\u00e4nger, Secretary General of the World Wind Energy Association said, \"South Africa is the first African country to introduce a feed-in tariff for wind energy. Many small and big investors will now be able to contribute to the take-off of the wind industry in the country. Such decentralised investment will enable South Africa to overcome its current energy crisis. It will also help many South African communities to invest in wind farms and generate electricity, new jobs and new income. We are especially pleased as this decision comes shortly after the first North American feed-in law has been proposed by the Government of the Canadian Province of Ontario\".<ref>Gipe, Paul (10 April 2009) [http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/04/south-africa-introduces-aggressive-feed-in-tariffs \"South Africa Introduces Aggressive Feed-in Tariffs\"], renewableenergyworld.com</ref>\n\nHowever, the tariff was abandoned before it began in favor of a competitive bidding process launched on 3 August 2011. Under this bidding process, the South African government planned to procure 3,750 MW of renewable energy: 1,850 MW of onshore wind, 1,450 MW of solar PV, 200 MW of CSP, 75 MW of small hydro, 25 MW of landfill gas, 12.5 MW of biogas, 12.5 MW of biomass and 100 MW of small projects. The bidding process comprised two steps:\n* Qualification phase. Projects are assessed based on structure of the project, legal, land acquisition and use, financial, environmental consent, technical, economic development and bid guarantee\n* Evaluation phase. Compliant bids are then evaluated based on: (1) price relative to a ceiling provided in bid documentation, accounting for 70% of the decision, and (2) economic development, accounting for 30% of the decision.\n\nThe first round of bids was due on 4 November 2011. PPA's were expected to be in place by June 2012. Projects should be commissioned by June 2014, except CSP projects expected by June 2015.\n\n===Spain===\nSpanish feed-in legislation was set by Royal decree 1578/2008 (''Real Decreto 1578/2008''), for photovoltaic installations, and Royal decree 661/2007 for other renewable technologies injecting electricity to the public grid. Originally under the 661/2007, photovoltaic tariffs were developed under a separate law due to its rapid growth.\n\nThe decree 1578/2008 categorized installations in two main groups with differentiated tariffs:\n# Building Integrated installations; with 34c\u20ac/kWh in systems up to 20&nbsp;kW of nominal power, and for systems above 20&nbsp;kW with a limit of nominal power of 2MW tariff of 31c\u20ac/kWh\n# Non integrated installations; 32c\u20ac/kWh for systems up to 10 MW of nominal power.\n\nFor other technologies decree 661/2007 setd up:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Under this incentive program, systems are paid for the kilowatt-hours (kWh) generated over a 15-year period, at a rate set at the time a system is enrolled in the program. The Oregon Public Utility Commission (PUC) established rates and rules in May 2010. This program was offered by the three investor-owned utilities in Oregon and administered by the utilities. The PUC planned to periodically re-evaluate rates. Program costs were recoverable in utility rates and utility-owned systems were not eligible for the incentive.\n\nThe pilot program installation cap was limited to an aggregate cap of 25 megawatts (MW) of solar photovoltaics (PV), with a maximum system size cap of 500 kilowatts (kW). The aggregate program cap was to be spread equally over four years, with 6.25 MW of capacity being eligible to receive the incentive each year. The aggregate cap was divided, based on 2008 retail sales revenue. PGE had a cap of 14.9 MW, Pacific Power 9.8 MW, and Idaho Power 0.4 MW. Idaho Power's program was limited to residential installations. Rates differed by system size and geographic zone. Small- and medium-scale systems participated in a program modeled after net metering. Larger-scale systems were competitively bid. Participating PV systems must be grid-connected, metered and meet all applicable codes and regulations. Systems must be \"permanently installed\".\n\nSystems sized 100&nbsp;kW or less could participate based on net metering. Generating capacity of 20 MW of the aggregate cap was reserved for the net metering portion, with 12 MW available for residential and 8 MW available for small commercial systems. These residential and small commercial systems were paid for the amount of electricity generated, up to the amount of electricity consumed. In essence, customers were paid for the amount of utility electric load consumption that is offset by onsite generation. Unlike typical feed-in tariffs, customers can consume the electricity generated on-site and receive a production incentive \u2013 or a volumetric incentive payment \u2013 for the amount of electricity generated and consumed. To remove a [[perverse incentive]] to increase electricity consumption to receive a greater payment, the system had to be appropriately sized to meet average electricity consumption. Rates were determined by the PUC based on annual system cost and annual energy output, differentiated by geographic zones. The cost estimates were based on installation data from [[Energy Trust of Oregon]]. The actual rates paid to the customer-generator were the volumetric incentive rate minus the retail rate. The volumetric incentive rates were to be re-evaluated every six months. The rates for the performance-based incentive program ranged from $0.25/kWh to $0.411/kWh.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsireusa.org/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=OR134F&re=1&ee=1 |title=Oregon |publisher=Dsireusa.org |date= |access-date=2013-12-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104060604/http://www.dsireusa.org/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=OR134F&re=1&ee=1 |archive-date= 4 November 2013 |df= }}</ref>\n\n====Vermont====\nVermont adopted feed-in tariffs on 27 May 2009 as part of the Vermont Energy Act of 2009.

House [of] Jacob) is a [[genericized]] name for full-time [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] elementary and secondary schools for Jewish girls throughout the world. \n\nBais Yaakov, started by [[Sarah Schenirer]] in post-World War I\n[[Krak\u00f3w]], was at the time a revolutionary approach to Jewish women's education. It has since achieved mainstream status within Orthodox Judaism, with branches located worldwide in every Jewish community with a significant population. \n\nWhile many of these schools carry the Bais Yaakov name, they are not necessarily affiliated, though they may be for other reasons.\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Bais-Yaakov-1.jpg|thumb|300px|The second graduating class of the Bais Ya'akov in Lodz, Poland, in 1934.]]\nThe Bais Yaakov movement was started by seamstress [[Sarah Schenirer]] in 1917 in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Poland]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Carry Me In Your Heart|last = Benisch|first = Pearl|publisher = Feldheim|year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> The first school building survives as apartments, and is marked with a bronze plaque.\n\nWhile boys attended [[cheder]] and [[Talmud Torah]] schools (and in some cases [[yeshiva]]s), at that time there was no formalized system of Jewish education for girls and young Jewish women.\n\nSchenirer saw that there was a high rate of assimilation among girls due to the vast secular influences of the non-Jewish schools that the girls were then attending. Sarah Schenirer concluded that only providing young Jewish women with a thorough, school-based Jewish education would effectively combat this phenomenon. She started a school of her own, trained other women to teach, and set up similar schools in other cities throughout [[Europe]].\n\nShe obtained the approval of [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]] (author of ''[[Chofetz Chaim]]''), who issued a [[responsum]] holding that contemporary conditions required departing from traditional prohibitions on teaching women Torah and accepting the view that it was permitted. Following the Chofetz Chaim's approbation, the Bais Yaakov Movement in Poland was taken under the wing of [[World Agudath Israel|Agudath Israel]]. Additionally, she sought and received approbation from [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] rabbis as well, most notably the [[Yissachar Dov Rokeach (third Belzer rebbe)|Belzer Rebbe]] and the [[Avraham Mordechai Alter|Gerrer Rebbe]].<ref>\"From Sarah to Sarah\" by S. Feldbrand1976</ref> The original Bais Yaakov was a seminary of sorts, intended to train girls to themselves become teachers and spread the Bais Yaakov movement.\n\nGirls who were taught in the Bais Yaakov movement used their education as psychological support to survive World War II and [[the Holocaust]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=To Vanquish the Dragon|last=Benisch|first=Pearl|publisher=Feldheim|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[World War II]], Jews who came to [[North America]], [[Israel]], and other places established girls' schools of the same name, although some{{who|date=July 2019}} claim that the educational philosophy differs slightly from that of the original Bais Yaakov schools.\n\nBesides elementary and high schools, there are also post-secondary schools in the Bais Yaakov system, usually referred to as seminaries. These run various courses generally lasting between one and three years. There are also post-secondary schools that combine Torah education with practical workforce skills, such as computer programming, education, and graphic arts.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name Bais Yaakov comes from a verse in the [[Book of Exodus]] in which the term \"House of Jacob\" is understood by [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible]] to refer to the female segment of the Jewish nation.<ref>{{bibleverse|Exodus|19:3}}</ref>\n\n== Current ==\n=== Educational approach ===\nThe educational policies of most Bais Yaakov schools worldwide is generally that of [[Haredi Judaism]] and the [[Agudath Israel movement]]. In accordance with the differences between the Israeli and Diaspora Haredi communities, there are slight variations in outlook and philosophy between Israeli, American and European Bais Yaakov schools. Israeli Bais Yaakov schools tend to de-emphasize the secular content of the [[curriculum]], whereas in North America and Europe the girls frequently receive a more diverse secular education. Large cities may have several Bais Yaakov schools, each with small variations in philosophy, typically over the importance placed on secular studies and/or accommodations made to secular values.\n\nStudents are required to uphold a dress code or wear uniforms which conform to the rules of ''[[tzniut|tznius]]'' (modesty). Uniforms differ from school to school but typically consist of a long pleated skirt, [[oxford shirt]], and sweater or sweatshirt.\n\nThe schools' primary purpose is to prepare students to be contributors to family and community, as good [[Jew]]s, wives, professionals, and mothers. \n\nSecular studies sometimes reflect government proficiency requirements in such subjects as math, science, literature and history in their respective countries.\n\n=== Curriculum ===\nMost non-Hasidic Bais Yaakov schools in America teach Judaic studies in the mornings and a college preparatory program of secular studies in the afternoons. Judaic studies usually include study of [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] ([[Pentateuch]]), [[Nevi'im]] (Prophets), and other parts of the [[Hebrew Bible]]; and instruction in [[Hebrew language]], [[Jewish history]] and the study of practical ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law), sometimes directly from the text, and other times as a summary of classic ''halakha'' sources.\n\nOne of the tenets of [[Orthodox Judaism]] is that it is impossible to fully understand the written Torah without the Jewish commentaries, so Bais Yaakov girls are taught the [[Tanakh]] through this approach.

House [of] Jacob) is a [[genericized]] name for full-time [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] elementary and secondary schools for Jewish girls throughout the world. \n\nBais Yaakov, started by [[Sarah Schenirer]] in post-World War I\n[[Krak\u00f3w]], was at the time a revolutionary approach to Jewish women's education. It has since achieved mainstream status within Orthodox Judaism, with branches located worldwide in every Jewish community with a significant population. \n\nWhile many of these schools carry the Bais Yaakov name, they are not necessarily affiliated, though they may be for other reasons.\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Bais-Yaakov-1.jpg|thumb|300px|The second graduating class of the Bais Ya'akov in Lodz, Poland, in 1934.]]\nThe Bais Yaakov movement was started by seamstress [[Sarah Schenirer]] in 1917 in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Poland]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Carry Me In Your Heart|last = Benisch|first = Pearl|publisher = Feldheim|year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref> The first school building survives as apartments, and is marked with a bronze plaque.\n\nWhile boys attended [[cheder]] and [[Talmud Torah]] schools (and in some cases [[yeshiva]]s), at that time there was no formalized system of Jewish education for girls and young Jewish women.\n\nSchenirer saw that there was a high rate of assimilation among girls due to the vast secular influences of the non-Jewish schools that the girls were then attending. Sarah Schenirer concluded that only providing young Jewish women with a thorough, school-based Jewish education would effectively combat this phenomenon. She started a school of her own, trained other women to teach, and set up similar schools in other cities throughout [[Europe]].\n\nShe obtained the approval of [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]] (author of ''[[Chofetz Chaim]]''), who issued a [[responsum]] holding that contemporary conditions required departing from traditional prohibitions on teaching women Torah and accepting the view that it was permitted. Following the Chofetz Chaim's approbation, the Bais Yaakov Movement in Poland was taken under the wing of [[World Agudath Israel|Agudath Israel]]. Additionally, she sought and received approbation from [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] rabbis as well, most notably the [[Yissachar Dov Rokeach (third Belzer rebbe)|Belzer Rebbe]] and the [[Avraham Mordechai Alter|Gerrer Rebbe]].<ref>\"From Sarah to Sarah\" by S. Feldbrand1976</ref> The original Bais Yaakov was a seminary of sorts, intended to train girls to themselves become teachers and spread the Bais Yaakov movement.\n\nGirls who were taught in the Bais Yaakov movement used their education as psychological support to survive World War II and [[the Holocaust]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=To Vanquish the Dragon|last=Benisch|first=Pearl|publisher=Feldheim|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[World War II]], Jews who came to [[North America]], [[Israel]], and other places established girls' schools of the same name, although some{{who|date=July 2019}} claim that the educational philosophy differs slightly from that of the original Bais Yaakov schools.\n\nBesides elementary and high schools, there are also post-secondary schools in the Bais Yaakov system, usually referred to as seminaries. These run various courses generally lasting between one and three years. There are also post-secondary schools that combine Torah education with practical workforce skills, such as computer programming, education, and graphic arts.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name Bais Yaakov comes from a verse in the [[Book of Exodus]] in which the term \"House of Jacob\" is understood by [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible]] to refer to the female segment of the Jewish nation.<ref>{{bibleverse|Exodus|19:3}}</ref>\n\n== Current ==\n=== Educational approach ===\nThe educational policies of most Bais Yaakov schools worldwide is generally that of [[Haredi Judaism]] and the [[Agudath Israel movement]]. In accordance with the differences between the Israeli and Diaspora Haredi communities, there are slight variations in outlook and philosophy between Israeli, American and European Bais Yaakov schools. Israeli Bais Yaakov schools tend to de-emphasize the secular content of the [[curriculum]], whereas in North America and Europe the girls frequently receive a more diverse secular education. Large cities may have several Bais Yaakov schools, each with small variations in philosophy, typically over the importance placed on secular studies and/or accommodations made to secular values.\n\nStudents are required to uphold a dress code or wear uniforms which conform to the rules of ''[[tzniut|tznius]]'' (modesty). Uniforms differ from school to school but typically consist of a long pleated skirt, [[oxford shirt]], and sweater or sweatshirt.\n\nThe schools' primary purpose is to prepare students to be contributors to family and community, as good [[Jew]]s, wives, professionals, and mothers. \n\nSecular studies sometimes reflect government proficiency requirements in such subjects as math, science, literature and history in their respective countries.\n\n=== Curriculum ===\nMost non-Hasidic Bais Yaakov schools in America teach Judaic studies in the mornings and a college preparatory program of secular studies in the afternoons. Judaic studies usually include study of [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] ([[Pentateuch]]), [[Nevi'im]] (Prophets), and other parts of the [[Hebrew Bible]]; and instruction in [[Hebrew language]], [[Jewish history]] and the study of practical ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law), sometimes directly from the text, and other times as a summary of classic ''halakha'' sources.\n\nOne of the tenets of [[Orthodox Judaism]] is that it is impossible to fully understand the written Torah without the Jewish commentaries, so Bais Yaakov girls are taught the [[Tanakh]] through this approach. A major focus is on [[Rashi]], considered the foremost Torah commentator.\n\nThe curriculum of Bais Yaakov differs from that of male-only [[yeshiva]]s, where the core component of study is the [[Talmud]]. Girls in Bais Yaakov schools do not learn law from the text of the Talmud itself, but may study its non-legal portions of ''[[aggadah]]'' (homiletics). This contrasts with the approach of many [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] [[Jewish day school]]s, which increasingly teach Talmud to women.\n\n=== Locations ===\n[[Image:\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \"\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1\" \u05d4\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df, \u05e7\u05e8\u05e7\u05d5\u05d1 (1).jpg|thumb|250px|Beit Yaakov teachers' Seminary, [[Krak\u00f3w]], Poland.]]\nBranches exist in most North American cities with large [[:Category:Orthodox Jewish communities|populations of Orthodox Jews]] such as New York City, Montreal, Miami, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Denver, [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], Toronto, [[Lakewood Township, New Jersey|Lakewood]], [[Passaic, New Jersey|Passaic]], [[Monsey, New York|Monsey]], and in most Israeli cities.

The name was chosen to reflect the potential speed improvements of machine-specific optimization, which is a major feature of Gentoo. Gentoo package management is designed to be [[Modular programming|modular]], [[porting|portable]], easy to maintain, and flexible.

Gentoo encourages users to build a Linux kernel tailored to their particular hardware. It allows very fine control of which services are installed and running; also, memory usage can be reduced, compared to other distributions, by omitting unnecessary kernel features and services.<ref name=\"Negus2008\" />{{rp|386}}\n\nA very large collection of software is available. Each package contains details of any dependencies on other software, so only the minimum set need be installed to run the required applications. Optional features of individual packages, for example whether they require [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]] support, can be selected by the user and any resulting package requirements are automatically included in the set of dependencies.<ref name=\"Negus2008\"/>{{rp|386}}\n\nAs Gentoo does not impose a standard [[look and feel]], installed packages usually appear as their authors intended.<ref name=\"Negus2008\"/>{{rp|387}}\n\n===Portage===\n{{Main article|Portage (software)}}\n[[File:Gentoo-portage-installing-darktable.png|alt=Installing software.

For example here we see that Darktable will build with Flickr and geolocation support.]]\nPortage can be considered the heart of Gentoo. Portage is Gentoo's [[software distribution]] and [[Package manager|package management system]]. The original design was based on the [[Ports collection|ports system]] used by the [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] (BSD) based operating systems. The portage tree contains over 19,000 packages ready for installation in a Gentoo system.<ref name=\"Negus2006\">{{cite book|author=Chris Negus|title=Live Linux CDs: Building and Customizing Bootables|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2S3eUgb39C8C&pg=PA224|year=2006|publisher=Prentice Hall Professional|isbn=978-0-13-243274-0|pages=224\u2013}}</ref>\n\nA single invocation of portage's {{mono|emerge}} command can update the local copy of the portage tree, search for a package, or download, compile, and install one or more packages and their dependencies. The built-in features can be set for individual packages, or globally, with so-called \"USE flags\".<ref name=\"Negus2006\"/>\n\nPortage provides a way to set the amount of processes that can run and the maximum load average for the processor cores using the {{mono|EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS}} flag <ref>https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS</ref> in either the default configuration file at <code>/etc/portage/make.conf</code> or a file that <code>export</code>s the flag, like in <code>/root/.bashrc</code>. Note that root is required to run emerge, so the [[.bashrc]] needs to be in the user <em>root</em>'s directory. This can be used like so in <code>make.conf</code>:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=shell>\nEMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS=\"-j$(nproc) -l$(nproc)\"\n</syntaxhighlight>\nPre-compiled binaries are provided for some applications with long build times, such as [[LibreOffice]], [[Apache OpenOffice]] and [[Firefox|Mozilla Firefox]], but users lose the ability to customize optional features. There are configuration options to reduce compilation times by enabling parallel compilation and using [[Pipeline (Unix)|pipes]] instead of temporary files;<ref>[https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:X86/Installation/Stage#CFLAGS_and_CXXFLAGS CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS], Gentoo Linux x86 Handbook.

The most common way is to use the Gentoo minimal CD with a stage3 [[tar (computing)|tarball]] (explained below). As with many Linux distributions, Gentoo may be installed from almost any Linux environment, such as another Linux distribution's Live CD, Live USB or Network Booting using the \"Gentoo Alternative Install Guide\". A normal install requires a connection to the Internet, but there is also a guide for a network-less install.\n\nPreviously, Gentoo supported installation from stage1 and stage2 tarballs; however, the Gentoo Foundation no longer recommends them. Stage1 and stage2 are meant only for Gentoo developers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/FAQ#How_do_I_install_Gentoo_using_a_stage1_or_stage2_tarball.3F|title=How do I Install Gentoo Using a Stage1 or Stage2 Tarball?}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the initial install steps, the Gentoo Linux install process in the Gentoo Handbook describes compiling a new Linux kernel. This process is generally not required by other Linux distributions. Although this is widely regarded as a complex task, Gentoo provides documentation and tools such as [[Genkernel]] to simplify the process and make it straightforward for novice users. In addition, users may also use an existing kernel known to work on their system by simply copying it to the boot directory and updating their bootloader. Support for installation is provided on the Gentoo forum and on [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]].\n\nA [[Live USB]] of Gentoo Linux can be created manually or by using [[UNetbootin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unetbootin.github.io/ |title=UNetbootin \u2013 Universal Netboot Installer |publisher=Unetbootin.github.io |date= |accessdate=2018-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Stages===\nBefore October 2005, installation could be started from any of three base stages:\n* ''Stage1'' begins with only what is necessary to build a [[toolchain]] (the various compilers, linkers, and language libraries necessary to compile other software) for the target system; compiling this target toolchain from another, pre-existing host system is known as [[Bootstrapping (compilers)|bootstrapping]] the target system.\n* ''Stage2'' begins with a [[Self-hosting (compilers)|self-hosting]] (bootstrapped) toolchain for the target system, which is then used to compile all other core [[User space|userland]] software for the target.\n* ''Stage3'' begins with a minimal set of compiled user software, with which the [[kernel (operating system)|kernel]] and any other additional software are then configured and compiled.\n\nSince October 2005, only the stage3 installations have been officially supported, due to the inherent complexities of bootstrapping from earlier stages (which requires resolving and then breaking numerous [[dependency graph|circular dependencies]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20051114-newsletter.xml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125005807/http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20051114-newsletter.xml |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-11-25 |title=Gentoo Linux Newsletter \u2013 November 14th, 2005 |publisher=Gentoo.org |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> [[Tar (file format)|Tar]]balls for stage1 and stage2 were distributed for some time after this,{{when|date=September 2014}} although the instructions for installing from these stages had been removed from the handbook<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-doc/message/10e3dc2fcf03e67fb91e8933ea0e5b35|title=Stage1/2 deprecation from Gentoo Handbook|publisher=Gentoo|date=2005-11-05|accessdate=2018-02-10}}</ref> and moved into the Gentoo FAQ.<ref name=gentoo-faq/> {{As of|2015|09}}, only the supported stage3 tarballs are publicly available; stage1 and stage2 tarballs are only \"officially\" generated and used internally by Gentoo development teams.

Genkernel compiles the kernel with all available device drivers built as [[Kernel module|modules]], then copies potentially boot-critical ones to an [[initrd|initramfs]] that is passed to the kernel at [[Booting|boot time]], automatically loading the modules before they are needed. It is designed to allow users with little or no experience configuring a [[Linux kernel]] to easily set up a working kernel. Also, non-trivial hard disk setups like [[Logical Volume Manager (Linux)|LVM]] and/or [[dm-crypt]] for [[Disk encryption#Full disk encryption|full disk encryption]] make usage of an initramfs unavoidable; here genkernel can save the user from manually creating one.\n\nThe main reason for genkernel is the fact that you have to configure and build your own kernel during the installation of Gentoo, this can be a problem for new [[Linux]] users. Experienced Linux users generally prefer to configure and build their kernel manually, because genkernel tries to configure the kernel as safely as possible which causes the kernel to grow very large. However, one can choose to use a custom kernel configuration and use genkernel to compile it, and still benefit from other features such as the initramfs builder.\n\n==== Genkernel modes ====\n*\"all\" - Build kernel, all modules, and create the initramfs.\n*\"bzImage\" - Just build the kernel.\n*\"kernel\" - Build the kernel and the modules.\n*\"initramfs\" - Just build the initramfs.\n\n==Versions==\nOnce Gentoo is installed, it becomes effectively \"[[Rolling release|versionless]]\"; that is, once an {{mono|emerge}} update is done, the system is completely current, with all the latest software readily available to it (subject to restrictions that a user may have specified in their Portage configuration files). For example, if a system is installed using a stage3 from March 2011, and the user performs a full {{mono|emerge}} update one month later, they will upgrade the installed Gentoo system to the same as they would have if they had performed a fresh installation from an April 2011 CD. Thus, Gentoo users may upgrade to the latest version of all of their installed software the day that new versions are released and have an [[Portage (software)#ebuild|ebuild]] available. Like other Linux distributions, Gentoo systems have an <code>/etc/gentoo-release</code> file, but this contains the version of the installed <code>sys-apps/baselayout</code> package.\n\nIn 2004, Gentoo began to version its Live media by year rather than numerically. This continued until 2008, when it was announced that the 2008.1 Live CD release had been cancelled in favour of weekly automated builds of both Stages 3 and Minimal CDs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20080922-releng-announcement.xml |title=Gentoo News \u2013 New release strategy to provide more current install media |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-09-22 |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208123741/http://www.gentoo.org/news/20080922-releng-announcement.xml |archivedate=February 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On 20 December 2008, the first weekly builds were published.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20081220-releng-first-weekly-stage.xml |title=Gentoo News \u2013 First sets of weekly stage3 tarballs and minimal CDs released |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-12-20 |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702230431/http://www.gentoo.org/news/20081220-releng-first-weekly-stage.xml |archivedate=July 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 2009, a special [[Live CD|Live DVD]] was created to celebrate the Gentoo 10-year anniversary.<ref name=\"10-years\" />\n\n===Release media version history===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

These profiles are versioned based on the year they were released, and include several variants for each release targeted towards different types of systems (such as [[Server_(computing)|servers]] and [[Desktop computer|desktops]]).

Portage is Gentoo's [[software distribution]] and [[Package manager|package management system]].

The most common way is to use the Gentoo minimal CD with a stage3 [[tar (computing)|tarball]] (explained below). As with many Linux distributions, Gentoo may be installed from almost any Linux environment, such as another Linux distribution's Live CD, Live USB or Network Booting using the \"Gentoo Alternative Install Guide\". A normal install requires a connection to the Internet, but there is also a guide for a network-less install.\n\nPreviously, Gentoo supported installation from stage1 and stage2 tarballs; however, the Gentoo Foundation no longer recommends them. Stage1 and stage2 are meant only for Gentoo developers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/FAQ#How_do_I_install_Gentoo_using_a_stage1_or_stage2_tarball.3F|title=How do I Install Gentoo Using a Stage1 or Stage2 Tarball?}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the initial install steps, the Gentoo Linux install process in the Gentoo Handbook describes compiling a new Linux kernel. This process is generally not required by other Linux distributions. Although this is widely regarded as a complex task, Gentoo provides documentation and tools such as [[Genkernel]] to simplify the process and make it straightforward for novice users. In addition, users may also use an existing kernel known to work on their system by simply copying it to the boot directory and updating their bootloader. Support for installation is provided on the Gentoo forum and on [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]].\n\nA [[Live USB]] of Gentoo Linux can be created manually or by using [[UNetbootin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unetbootin.github.io/ |title=UNetbootin \u2013 Universal Netboot Installer |publisher=Unetbootin.github.io |date= |accessdate=2018-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Stages===\nBefore October 2005, installation could be started from any of three base stages:\n* ''Stage1'' begins with only what is necessary to build a [[toolchain]] (the various compilers, linkers, and language libraries necessary to compile other software) for the target system; compiling this target toolchain from another, pre-existing host system is known as [[Bootstrapping (compilers)|bootstrapping]] the target system.\n* ''Stage2'' begins with a [[Self-hosting (compilers)|self-hosting]] (bootstrapped) toolchain for the target system, which is then used to compile all other core [[User space|userland]] software for the target.\n* ''Stage3'' begins with a minimal set of compiled user software, with which the [[kernel (operating system)|kernel]] and any other additional software are then configured and compiled.\n\nSince October 2005, only the stage3 installations have been officially supported, due to the inherent complexities of bootstrapping from earlier stages (which requires resolving and then breaking numerous [[dependency graph|circular dependencies]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20051114-newsletter.xml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125005807/http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20051114-newsletter.xml |url-status=dead |archive-date=2005-11-25 |title=Gentoo Linux Newsletter \u2013 November 14th, 2005 |publisher=Gentoo.org |accessdate=2010-01-28}}</ref> [[Tar (file format)|Tar]]balls for stage1 and stage2 were distributed for some time after this,{{when|date=September 2014}} although the instructions for installing from these stages had been removed from the handbook<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-doc/message/10e3dc2fcf03e67fb91e8933ea0e5b35|title=Stage1/2 deprecation from Gentoo Handbook|publisher=Gentoo|date=2005-11-05|accessdate=2018-02-10}}</ref> and moved into the Gentoo FAQ.<ref name=gentoo-faq/> {{As of|2015|09}}, only the supported stage3 tarballs are publicly available; stage1 and stage2 tarballs are only \"officially\" generated and used internally by Gentoo development teams. However, if so desired, a user may still rebuild the toolchain or reinstall the base system software during or after a normal stage3 installation, effectively simulating the old bootstrap process.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Sakaki's_EFI_Install_Guide/Building_the_Gentoo_Base_System_Minus_Kernel#Bootstrapping_the_Base_System_.28Optional_but_Recommended.29|title=Sakaki's EFI Install Guide/Building the Gentoo Base System Minus Kernel|publisher=Sakaki|date=2014-07-04|accessdate=2017-01-09}}</ref>\n\n===Gentoo Reference Platform===\nFrom 2003 until 2008, the '''Gentoo Reference Platform''' (GRP) was a snapshot of prebuilt packages that users could quickly install during the Gentoo installation process, to give faster access to fully functional Gentoo installation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2002/10/10/intro_gentoo.html|title=Gentoo Linux Reloaded|author=[[Daniel Robbins (computer programmer)|Daniel Robbins]]|date=2002-10-10|accessdate=2007-01-04|work=[[O'Reilly Media|LinuxDevCenter.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/6206|title=Gentoo Linux 2004.0 Released|author=Sven Vermeulen|date=2004-03-01|accessdate=2018-02-10|work=[[OSNews]]}}</ref> These packages included [[KDE]], [[X Window System]], [[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]], [[GNOME]], and [[Mozilla]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/2005.1/hb-install-about.xml|title=Gentoo Linux Documentation|accessdate=2018-02-10|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108142459/https://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/2005.1/hb-install-about.xml|archivedate=2014-01-08|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Once the installation was complete, the packages installed as part of the GRP were intended to be replaced by the user with the same or newer versions built though Portage which would be built using the users' system configuration rather than the generic builds provided by the GRP.

Genkernel compiles the kernel with all available device drivers built as [[Kernel module|modules]], then copies potentially boot-critical ones to an [[initrd|initramfs]] that is passed to the kernel at [[Booting|boot time]], automatically loading the modules before they are needed. It is designed to allow users with little or no experience configuring a [[Linux kernel]] to easily set up a working kernel. Also, non-trivial hard disk setups like [[Logical Volume Manager (Linux)|LVM]] and/or [[dm-crypt]] for [[Disk encryption#Full disk encryption|full disk encryption]] make usage of an initramfs unavoidable; here genkernel can save the user from manually creating one.\n\nThe main reason for genkernel is the fact that you have to configure and build your own kernel during the installation of Gentoo, this can be a problem for new [[Linux]] users. Experienced Linux users generally prefer to configure and build their kernel manually, because genkernel tries to configure the kernel as safely as possible which causes the kernel to grow very large. However, one can choose to use a custom kernel configuration and use genkernel to compile it, and still benefit from other features such as the initramfs builder.\n\n==== Genkernel modes ====\n*\"all\" - Build kernel, all modules, and create the initramfs.\n*\"bzImage\" - Just build the kernel.\n*\"kernel\" - Build the kernel and the modules.\n*\"initramfs\" - Just build the initramfs.\n\n==Versions==\nOnce Gentoo is installed, it becomes effectively \"[[Rolling release|versionless]]\"; that is, once an {{mono|emerge}} update is done, the system is completely current, with all the latest software readily available to it (subject to restrictions that a user may have specified in their Portage configuration files). For example, if a system is installed using a stage3 from March 2011, and the user performs a full {{mono|emerge}} update one month later, they will upgrade the installed Gentoo system to the same as they would have if they had performed a fresh installation from an April 2011 CD. Thus, Gentoo users may upgrade to the latest version of all of their installed software the day that new versions are released and have an [[Portage (software)#ebuild|ebuild]] available. Like other Linux distributions, Gentoo systems have an <code>/etc/gentoo-release</code> file, but this contains the version of the installed <code>sys-apps/baselayout</code> package.\n\nIn 2004, Gentoo began to version its Live media by year rather than numerically. This continued until 2008, when it was announced that the 2008.1 Live CD release had been cancelled in favour of weekly automated builds of both Stages 3 and Minimal CDs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20080922-releng-announcement.xml |title=Gentoo News \u2013 New release strategy to provide more current install media |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-09-22 |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208123741/http://www.gentoo.org/news/20080922-releng-announcement.xml |archivedate=February 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On 20 December 2008, the first weekly builds were published.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20081220-releng-first-weekly-stage.xml |title=Gentoo News \u2013 First sets of weekly stage3 tarballs and minimal CDs released |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-12-20 |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702230431/http://www.gentoo.org/news/20081220-releng-first-weekly-stage.xml |archivedate=July 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 2009, a special [[Live CD|Live DVD]] was created to celebrate the Gentoo 10-year anniversary.<ref name=\"10-years\" />\n\n===Release media version history===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

These profiles are versioned based on the year they were released, and include several variants for each release targeted towards different types of systems (such as [[Server_(computing)|servers]] and [[Desktop computer|desktops]]). Profiles formerly tracked the versioning of install media, and switched to two-digit year-based naming after the discontinuation of versioned media. The following new profile versions have been released after 2008.0:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Version\n!

For 2008, Gentoo dropped to 18th, but the following year it ended its dropping streak by rising to 17th.

Holmes and Mackintosh are the principal [[composers]], with almost all of the band's songs credited to them. During the years, the band has only changed drummers.\n\n==History==\n===Early years and Peaceville (1988\u20131991)===\nAfter their formation in 1988, Paradise Lost released three cassette demos, ''Paradise Lost'', ''Frozen Illusion'', and ''Plains of Desolation'', before being signed to [[Peaceville Records]] in 1989. They recorded their debut album, [[Lost Paradise (album)|''Lost Paradise'']], at [[Academy Music Studio]] in December of that year.

The band began to move away from the death/doom sound of their previous releases by adding keyboards and female vocal accompaniments.<ref name=AllmusicGothic>{{cite web|last1=Rivadavia|first1=Eduardo|title=Paradise Lost - Gothic review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/gothic-mw0000096112|website=Allmusic|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Music for Nations (1992\u20131998)===\n[[File:Paradiselost91.JPG|thumb|left|Paradise Lost performing live, 1991.]]\nParadise Lost left Peaceville and were signed to the [[Music for Nations]] label and released ''[[Shades of God]]'' in July 1992.<ref name=allmusicBio /> The band's musical approach continued to evolve with this album as evidenced by the addition of quieter passages in the song's compositions, the softening of vocalist [[Nick Holmes (singer)|Nick Holmes]]'s [[death grunt]], and Gregor Mackintosh's incorporation of [[acoustic guitar]] to his sound.<ref name=allmusicShades>{{cite web|last1=Rivadavia|first1=Eduardo|title=Paradise Lost - Shades of God review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/shades-of-god-mw0000107277|website=Allmusic|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref> The album contained the song \"As I Die\", later released as a [[As I Die|single/EP]].\n\nIn summer 1993, the band recorded their fourth album, ''[[Icon (Paradise Lost album)|Icon]],'' released in September of the same year. The band continued to develop their sound away from their doom roots and more towards the dynamics and sound of \"As I Die\" from their previous album. On ''Icon'', Nick Holmes abandoned his [[death grunt]] and started using a \"[[James Hetfield]]-style bark.\"<ref name=allmusicIcon>{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Christopher|title=Paradise Lost - Icon review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/icon-mw0000107875|website=Allmusic|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref> It was after this album, in December 1994, that original member Matthew Archer quit and was replaced by drummer [[Lee Morris (musician)|Lee Morris]].\n\nThe band entered the studio in January 1995 to record their fifth and most successful album, ''[[Draconian Times]]'', which was released in June 1995.

It was remade in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''Tappu Chesi Pappu Koodu'' (2002) and in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as ''[[London (2005 Indian film)|London]]'' (2005). The core plot of the movie is based on the 1988 English movie ''[[A Fish Called Wanda]]'' and the sub plot of the blind couple is adapted from the Marathi play '' Ghar Ghar'' which also went on to be adapted in the 2006 Hindi film ''[[Golmaal: Fun Unlimited]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nSivaraman ([[Mohanlal]]), an unemployed man, comes to [[Mumbai]] to find a job. Unfortunately, he loses all his certificates but happens to find Govindan Kutty ([[Mukesh (actor)|Mukesh]]), an old buddy from his native place, who is also jobless and wandering in Mumbai. They try to get [[Travel visa|visa]] from a travel agency but finds no way to gather such a massive amount. Govindan Kutty persuades Sivaraman to participate in a bank robbery planned by Thomas ([[Cochin Haneefa]]) and his gang, including his stammering brother Tyootty ([[Jagadish]]) and lover Alina ([[Sucheta Khanna]]).\n\nThey join the gang but the plan puts them in more trouble as the robbery ends in vain when they hit Pothuval ([[Innocent (actor)|Innocent]]). Alina secretly informs the police about the robbery and tells that the entire plan was carried out by Thomas. Thomas, before getting arrested, hides the money, and the place is kept secret except to his lawyer, Nambeeshan ([[Jagathy Sreekumar]]). Alina pretends to be in love with Nambeeshan to find the place where the money is hidden.\n\nMeanwhile, to find a safe cover, Sivaraman and Govindan Kutty plan to impersonate Kunjunni, the grandson of a rich but blind elderly couple, Thampuran ([[Nedumudi Venu]]) and his wife Sethu ([[Kaviyoor Ponnamma]]). They haven't seen their grandchild since his childhood. Sivaraman and Govindan Kutty end up disguising with the body of Govindan Kutty and the voice of Sivaraman to make up for Kunjunni in front of the blind couple.\n\nPothuval, who knows Govindan Kutty before and who served as a former servant to the blind couple, makes several attempts to make the old man learn the truth, but all of them fail knowingly or unknowingly much to the luck of Sivaraman and Govindan Kutty. While successfully carrying on, they are interrupted by Radhika Menon ([[Arzoo Govitrikar]]) who disguises herself as the lover of Kunjunni. She calls on all the relatives of the couple by mocking them. The relatives arrive in the absence of Sivaraman. Finding no-way out, Govindan Kutty pretends to have fainted unconscious and he gets admitted to the hospital. Sivaraman comes to his rescue and says that he is Dr. Gopalakrishnan, a friend of Kunjunni from the [[United States]]. \n\nAfter many successful and comical escapades during their drama, Govindan Kutty tries to steal the [[Lord Krishna]] statue, for which he places a [[Tepoy]] in the staircase to injure the old woman which keeps all others out of the house for sometime. Sivaraman engages in a fight with Govindan Kutty when he tries to leave with the statue he had stolen. The old man accuses his relatives for the accident and asks all his relatives to leave immediately. While he was reprimanding the relatives, the duo learn that the elderly couple had become blind in a car accident decades ago, in which their son and daughter-in-law (Kunjunni's parents) had died. Sivaraman and Govindan Kutty get desperate as the date for the visa payment was nearing. Radhika gives them the money for the visa and asks them to leave the house. Sivaraman and Govindan Kutty accept the money and leave the house.\n\nUpon leaving, they come to know that the visa agency was a fake one. Having lost all their resources, Govindan Kutty plans to start some new business with the money they have. Sivaraman disagrees to take the money and asks Govindan Kutty not to take the money which they have got for cheating on the innocent old couple. Govindankutty leaves Sivaraman in anger taking the money with him. Meanwhile, a sorrowful Pothuval informs Thampuran about Kunjunni's death. Later, Radhika also reveals to the old man that she is Kunjunni's actual lover and her real name is 'Revathy'. She also tells him that Kunjunni tragically died in [[America]] in a construction-site accident and she had come to inform this. But, after seeing the drama that was taking place which kept the old couple happy, cheerful, and hopeful, she also joined the duo. Sivaraman hears the truth and returns to the old man and confesses all his mistakes. The old man asks him to continue the drama in front of his wife Sethu, who loves her grandson above all and will die on the spot if she comes to know about the tragic truth. Sethu comes and calls Kunjunni, but she gets no replies but finally gets hold of Govindan Kutty's arms who has returned in remorse. The emotional old man hugs both Sivaraman and Govindan Kutty. And, while going back, Radhika promises to the old man that she will return again. Thampuran, Sivaraman, and Govindan Kutty have a funny moment together.\n\nIn the closing scene it is shown that Thomas and Tyootty have started a new humbug. Nambeeshan has gone back to his native place and has started farming and his ex-wife ([[Sukumari]]) marries a younger man. Pothuval starts an anti-alcohol society, and the future plans of Alina remain unknown.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Mohanlal]] as Sivaraman / Kunjunni\n* [[Mukesh (actor)|Mukesh]] as Govindan Kutty / Dr. Gopalakrishnan\n* [[Arzoo Govitrikar]] as Radhika Menon / Revathy, Kunjunni's lover \n* [[Suniel Shetty]] as the real Kunjunni ([[Cameo appearance]])\n* [[Nedumudi Venu]] as 'Thampuran', Kunjunni's blind grandfather\n* [[Kaviyoor Ponnamma]] as Sethulakshmi Bai 'Thampuratti', Kunjunni's blind grandmother\n* [[Innocent (actor)|Innocent]] as Pothuval\n* [[Jagathy Sreekumar]] as Advocate Nambeeshan\n* [[Sukumari]] as Savitri, Nambeeshan's wife\n* [[Sucheta Khanna]] as Elena (voice dubbed by [[Sreeja Ravi]])\n* [[Cochin Haneefa]] as Thomas\n* [[Jagadish]] as Tyootty, Thomas' stammering brother\n* [[Shalu Menon]] as Shalini, Devooty's daughter\n* [[Augustine (actor)|Augustine]] as Rama Varma, real Kunjunni's uncle\n* Poornima Anand as Thampuran and Thampuratti's daughter\n* [[Suchitra Murali]] as Madhavan's daughter\n* Manka Mahesh as Devooty, Thampuran and Thampuratti's daughter\n* [[T.

It was remade in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''Tappu Chesi Pappu Koodu'' (2002) and in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as ''[[London (2005 Indian film)|London]]'' (2005). The core plot of the movie is based on the 1988 English movie ''[[A Fish Called Wanda]]'' and the sub plot of the blind couple is adapted from the Marathi play '' Ghar Ghar'' which also went on to be adapted in the 2006 Hindi film ''[[Golmaal: Fun Unlimited]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nSivaraman ([[Mohanlal]]), an unemployed man, comes to [[Mumbai]] to find a job. Unfortunately, he loses all his certificates but happens to find Govindan Kutty ([[Mukesh (actor)|Mukesh]]), an old buddy from his native place, who is also jobless and wandering in Mumbai. They try to get [[Travel visa|visa]] from a travel agency but finds no way to gather such a massive amount.  Govindan Kutty persuades Sivaraman to participate in a bank robbery planned by Thomas ([[Cochin Haneefa]]) and his gang, including his stammering brother Tyootty ([[Jagadish]]) and lover Alina ([[Sucheta Khanna]]).\n\nThey join the gang but the plan puts them in more trouble as the robbery ends in vain when they hit Pothuval ([[Innocent (actor)|Innocent]]). Alina secretly informs the police about the robbery and tells that the entire plan was carried out by Thomas. Thomas, before getting arrested, hides the money, and the place is kept secret except to his lawyer, Nambeeshan ([[Jagathy Sreekumar]]). Alina pretends to be in love with Nambeeshan to find the place where the money is hidden.\n\nMeanwhile, to find a safe cover, Sivaraman and Govindan Kutty plan to impersonate Kunjunni, the grandson of a rich but blind elderly couple, Thampuran ([[Nedumudi Venu]]) and his wife Sethu ([[Kaviyoor Ponnamma]]). They haven't seen their grandchild since his childhood. Sivaraman and Govindan Kutty end up disguising with the body of Govindan Kutty and the voice of Sivaraman to make up for Kunjunni in front of the blind couple.\n\nPothuval, who knows Govindan Kutty before and who served as a former servant to the blind couple, makes several attempts to make the old man learn the truth, but all of them fail knowingly or unknowingly much to the luck of Sivaraman and Govindan Kutty. While successfully carrying on, they are interrupted by Radhika Menon ([[Arzoo Govitrikar]]) who disguises herself as the lover of Kunjunni. She calls on all the relatives of the couple by mocking them. The relatives arrive in the absence of Sivaraman. Finding no-way out, Govindan Kutty pretends to have fainted unconscious and he gets admitted to the hospital. Sivaraman comes to his rescue and says that he is Dr. Gopalakrishnan, a friend of Kunjunni from the [[United States]]. \n\nAfter many successful and comical escapades during their drama, Govindan Kutty tries to steal the [[Lord Krishna]] statue, for which he places a [[Tepoy]] in the staircase to injure the old woman which keeps all others out of the house for sometime. Sivaraman engages in a fight with Govindan Kutty when he tries to leave with the statue he had stolen. The old man accuses his relatives for the accident and asks all his relatives to leave immediately.
