In a career spanning four seasons, his performances in handicaps and top class company, including victory in the 1969 [[Eclipse Stakes]], established him as a talented racehorse without being exceptional. He would achieve greater success as a stallion whereupon retiring to stud where he became [[Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland|Champion Sire]] in Britain.\n\n==Background==\n\nBy Sovereign Path and out of Cygnet, Wolver Hollow was sold as a yearling, fetching 4,000 guineas<ref>SNOW,, JIM. \"Wolver Hollow shows his class.\" Times, September 8, 1967, 14. The Times Digital Archive (accessed April 3, 2020).</ref> Sovereign Path, rated 125 by [[Timeform]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1977 |title=Racehorses of 1976|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=701}}</ref> was successful in the 1959 [[Tetrarch Stakes]] as well as the 1960 renewals of the [[Lockinge Stakes]] and [[Queen Elizabeth II Stakes]]. As a sire, he produced sixteen crops of racehorses, the most notable of which was [[Humble Duty]]. Nevertheless, he also counted multiple big race winners among his progeny including Town Crier ([[Queen Anne Stakes]]), Supreme Sovereign ([[Lockinge Stakes]]) and Spanish Express ([[Middle Park Stakes]])<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1977 |title=Racehorses of 1976|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=936}}</ref>. While Wolver Hollow's dam Cygnet, by undefeated champion racehorse [[Caracalla (horse)|Caracalla]], did not hail from an immediately prolific family, her third dam, Sunshot, was the granddam of classic winners Resplendent (1926 [[Irish Oaks]] and dam of [[Windsor Lad]]) and Sol Speranza who won the same two classics in 1937.<ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=1943 |title=Bloodstock Breeders Annual Review |url= |journal=Bloodstock Breeders Annual Review |volume=32 |issue= |pages=73 |doi= |access-date=}}</ref> Alongside Wolver Hollow, Cygnet produced nine other foals including Gaybrook Swan, second in the 1970 [[Northern Dancer Turf Stakes|Niagara Handicap]] and Tall Dream, runner up in both the [[Vincent O'Brien National Stakes|National Stakes]] and [[Beresford Stakes]] of 1971.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloodstockreports.co.uk/weatherbys/wbr/orderreports/orderReportParameters.jsp?listSection=FR&listSectionName=Free%20Reports&countryCode=GB&optNo=79&priceId=1 |title=Weatherbys Bloodstock Reports |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://galopp-sieger.de/galoppsieger/pferd_html?pschl=Tall%20DreamTamerlane |title=Gallop Sieger |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===1966: two-year-old season===\nWolver Hollow made his debut in the 1966 New Stakes, now known as the [[Norfolk Stakes (Great Britain)|Norfolk Stakes]], at Ascot where he finished four lengths behind the Johnson Houghton trained Falcon.<ref>FROM OUR RACING CORRESPONDENT. \"Fighting Charlie falters but wins easily.\" Times, June 17, 1966, 5.</ref> On his second start, he finished behind Falcon again when fourth in the [[National Stakes (Sandown Park)|National Stakes]] at Sandown<ref>\"Sandown Park Details\" Times, 21 July 1966, p. 5.</ref> - a course incidentally where Falcon would win the following season's [[Temple Stakes]]. Wolver Hollow would then be unplaced at Kempton before rounding off the season finishing fourth of thirteen starters in the [[Dewhurst Stakes]] behind the next season's English and Irish Derby third Dart Board.\n\n===1967: three-year-old season===\nNewbury would be Wolver Hollow's first port of call in 1967 where he would contest the [[Greenham Stakes]], a traditional trial for the [[2000 Guineas]]. Finishing third by a neck and a head, this was the closest he had come to shedding his maiden tag. However, it was not the strongest Guineas trial given that neither of the front two were entered for the classic.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Classic horses not impressive.\" Times, April 24, 1967, 12.</ref> While it transpired to be useful form, (the runner up,[[Reform (horse)|Reform]], would become the leading miler of the season), Wolver Hollow started at an unfancied 40/1 when finishing unplaced on his next start in the Guineas.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Royal Palace beats milers at their own game.\" Times, May 4, 1967, 13.</ref> Returning to the Royal Ascot meeting where he made his debut the previous year, Wolver Hollow again ran into Reform finishing just under a length and a half fourth in the [[St James's Palace Stakes]].<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Steeple Aston can go one better in Hunt Cup.\" Times, 21 June 1967, p. 11.</ref> At the Goodwood meeting, Wolver Hollow entered handicap company with a reasonable fifth under second top-weight, giving a pound to Irish Derby runner up Sucaryl and six pounds to [[Falmouth Stakes]] winner Resilience.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Hopes vanish as Caergwrle heads for Midhurst.\" Times, 29 July 1967, p. 14.</ref> A step down in class a month later facilitated Wolver Hollow finally losing his maiden tag as he won the ten furlong Virginia Stakes at Newcastle. While the contest was effectively a maiden race, Wolver Hollow only had to be shaken up to win by four lengths.<ref>SNOW, JIM. \"Northern Racing.\" Times, August 29, 1967, 11.</ref> Little over a week later, Wolver Hollow doubled his tally with success in the one mile Crathorne Sweepstakes at York. There he faced three rivals;- Worthy Friend, a long priced outsider, [[Epsom Derby|Derby]] also-ran Scottish Sinbad who won a handicap at the same Newcastle meeting where Wolver Hollow was victorious, and [[Queen Anne Stakes]] runner up Arenaria who was in receipt of ten pounds.<ref>SNOW,, JIM. \"Scottish Sinbad is best choice.\" Times, 7 Sept. 1967, p. 14.</ref> Scottish Sinbad made the running but was closely tracked by Wolver Hollow under a motionless Edward Hide who sent his mount home inside the final furlong to win by a length and a half with Arenaria a further two lengths behind. After the race, he was given a 25/1 quote for the [[Cambridgeshire Handicap]].<ref>SNOW,, JIM. \"Wolver Hollow shows his class.\" Times, September 8, 1967, p. 14.</ref> In preparation for the Cambridgeshire, Wolver Hollow contested the Wavertree Stakes at Newmarket but was unable to complete a hat-trick, finishing a length and three quarters behind easy [[Nassau Stakes]] winner Fair Winter.<ref>\"Saturday's racing results\" Times, September 18, 1967, p. 11.</ref> Wolver Hollow capped off his season with a two and a half length third in the Cambridgeshire off 8st 12lb behind [[Irish 1,000 Guineas]] winner Lacquer<ref>\"Saturday's racing results\" Times, September 28, 1967, p. 12.</ref>\n\n===1968: four-year-old season===\nWolver Hollow made four racecourse appearances in 1968 although the first was not until August when he participated in two races at the Deauville summer festival. The first appearance came when fourth in the [[Prix Gontaut-Biron]] won by Frontal - himself fourth in the previous season's [[Prix du Jockey Club]]. On ground considered too soft for him, he was squeezed out of third by a head by Grandier who went on to win a [[Prix d'Ispahan]] and a [[Prix Ganay]] as well as finish third in a [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]].<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Rehearsal for Hopeful Venture.\" Times, 26 Aug. 1968, p. 12.</ref> Nine days later, Wolver Hollow ventured into calmer waters when winning the Prix Ridgway from Right Honourable and Atopolis. <ref>PAR, R.

The absences of [[2000 Guineas]] third Jimmy Reppin and [[Irish Derby]] runner up Ribofilio notwithstanding, the field still featured [[Sussex Stakes]] runner up World Cup, [[Prix Jean Prat]] victor Lorenzaccio and [[Greenham Stakes]] winner Heathen.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Lorenzaccio can hold off World Cup.\" Times, September 28, 1968, p. 6.</ref> The race, ran on soft ground, was contested between World Cup and Wolver Hollow up the straight with the former eventually winning by four easy lengths with Lorenzaccio a further three lengths behind in third.<ref>BAERLEIN, RICHARD. \"World Cup Scores Despite Rumours.\" The Observer, Sep 29, 1968.</ref> Wolver Hollow's season would culminate once again in the Cambridgeshire Handicap, this time shouldering top weight of 9st 8lbs. Next in the weights was [[Diadem Stakes]] winner Secret Ray on 9st 6lbs, [[Jersey Stakes]] third Paddy Me on 9st 4lbs, the same weight as previous year's runner up Straight Master while [[Yorkshire Oaks]] winner Exchange, carrying 9st, was sent off favourite.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Sir Ivor has stamina to win 'Champion'.\" Times, 19 Oct. 1968, p. 7.</ref> Wolver Hollow ran a career best to finish second, going down by a neck to Emirilo despite conceding twenty-seven pounds.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Great win for Sir Ivor at Newmarket.\" Times, 21 Oct. 1968, p. 11.</ref>\n\n===1969: five-year-old season===\n[[Henry Cecil|Henry Cecil's]] first season as a racehorse trainer would be spearheaded by Wolver Hollow's final season as a racehorse. His reappearance came in the Mark Lane Jubilee Stakes, a ten furlong handicap over ten furlongs on very soft ground. There he faced a stiff task sitting on top of the handicap conceding upwards of seven pounds to winners of the [[Rosebery Stakes]] and the [[City and Suburban Handicap]] along with the previous year's winner.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Wolver Hollow can survive stern test.\" Times, May 10, 1969, 6.</ref> In the event, bottom weight Sovereign Ruler won by a facile eight lengths and would go on to win two and twice finish placed in valuable handicaps through the rest of the season.<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1970 |title=Racehorses of 1969|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=671}}</ref> Wolver Hollow finished runner up while conceding thirty-five pounds to the well handicapped winner and was very much considered a contender going into the [[Lockinge Stakes]] on his next start.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Jimmy Reppin may take Lockinge Stakes.\" Times, 31 May 1969, p. 6.</ref> However, he would finish a tailed off last of six behind [[Habitat (horse)|Habitat]] and subsequently underwent a dope test.<ref>BAERLEIN, RICHARD. \"Lockinge Goes to Habitat.\" The Observer, Jun 01, 1969. P. 21.</ref> Wolver Hollow's penultimate start came at Royal Ascot in the [[Prince of Wales's Stakes]] where he would be ridden by [[Lester Piggot]] for the first time. Here he faced four rivals in the shape of [[Noel Murless|Noel Murless's]] top class [[Connaught (horse)|Connaught]], [[Epsom Derby]] also-ran Stoned and a couple of high class handicappers.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Prince Tenderfoot may be too fast for rivals.\" Times, 17 June 1969, p. 13.</ref> Class told with Connaught making all to win by five lengths ahead of Wolver Hollow, with stoned a further two lengths behind in third.<ref>SNOW, JIM. \"Double for Barclay.\" Times, June 18, 1969, 13.</ref> Wolver Hollow's career would be defined by his final start in the [[Eclipse Stakes]] where he would also be the last horse to carry his owner's colours.<ref name=\"auto1\">BAERLEIN, RICHARD. \"Big Prize for Last Runner.\" The Observer (1901- 2003), Jul 06, 1969, p. 19.</ref> Coughing forced Connaught and Ribofilio (Irish Derby second) to miss their engagement while the useful Remand was withdrawn leaving seven runners to face the starter at Sandown. High class continental form was well represented with Light Wind, who had won that season's [[Premio Presidente della Repubblica]], Hogarth who won the 1968 [[Derby Italiano]] and Timmy My Boy who finished runner up in that year's [[Prix du Jockey Club]]. Royal Rocket was third in the [[Brigadier Gerard Stakes|Coronation Stakes]] while sole three year old runner Rocked finished third in the [[Greenham Stakes]]. Park Top, bidding to become the first mare to win in the race's history, came into the race three from three for the season collecting the Prix de la Seine, the [[Coronation Cup]] and the [[Hardwicke Stakes]] along the way.<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1970 |title=Racehorses of 1969|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=509}}</ref>. Waiting tactics were typically employed on Park Top and controversially, this would be her undoing in the race. As described in Timeform's Racehorses of 1969 \"Wolver Hollow turned for home behind Park Top, came up the rails, gradually made his way to the front after an uninterrupted run, and led throughout the last furlong to win comfortably. Park Top, on the other hand, had several positions in the straight. She ran into the heels of the pacemaking Rocked two furlongs out, and after making her way round that horse she found her way blocked by the Italian Derby winner Hogarth. By the time she had moved out to come round Hogarth on the wide outside she had no chance of catching Wolver Hollow: she had used up most of her energy finding a way through, and courage wasn't enough to win her the prize.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1970 |title=Racehorses of 1969|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=510}}</ref> Park Top would win the [[King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes]] next time under Lester Piggot, confirming that she was superior to her Sandown showing. Nevertheless, Wolver Hollow's win was enough to secure a new career as a stallion.\n\n==Races==\n\n{| class = \"wikitable sortable\" | border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" style=\" text-align:centre; margin-left:1em; float:centre ;border-collapse: collapse; font-size:100%\"\n|-  style=\"background:#dacaa4; text-align:center;\"\n!'''Date'''\n!'''Finish'''\n!'''Race'''\n!'''Dist'''\n!'''Jockey'''\n!'''Winner/Runner up '''\n!'''Track'''\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1966|06|16}}\t\n|2nd\n|[[Norfolk Stakes (Great Britain)|New Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">5</span>5f\n|Stan Clayton\n|Falcon\n|[[Ascot Racecourse|Ascot]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1966|07|20}}\t\n|4th\n|[[National_Stakes_(Sandown_Park)|National Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">5</span>5f\n|Stan Clayton\n|Falcon\n|[[Sandown Park Racecourse|Sandown Park]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1966|09|17}}\t\n|Unplaced\n|Imperial Stakes\n|<span style=\"display:none\">6</span>6f\n|Stan Clayton\n|Heath Rose\n|[[Kempton_Park_Racecourse|Kempton Park]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1966|10|14}}\t\n|4th\n|[[Dewhurst Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">7</span>7f\n|Stan Clayton\n|Dart Board\n|[[Newmarket_Racecourse|Newmarket]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1967|04|22}}\t\n|3rd\n|[[Greenham Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">7</span>7f\n|[[Doug Smith (jockey)|Doug Smith]]\n|Play High\n|[[Newbury_Racecourse|Newbury]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1967|05|03}}\t\n|Unplaced\n|[[2000 Guineas Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">8</span>1m\n|[[Doug Smith  (jockey)|Doug Smith ]]\n|[[Royal_Palace_(horse)|Royal Palace]]\n|[[Newmarket_Racecourse|Newmarket]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1967|06|20}}\t\n|4th\n|[[St James's Palace Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">8</span>1m\n|[[George Moore (jockey)|George Moore]]\n|[[Reform (horse)|Reform]]\n|[[Ascot Racecourse|Ascot]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1967|07|28}}\t\n|5th\n|News of the World Stakes\n|<span style=\"display:none\">10</span>1m2f\n|Jimmy Lindley\n|Sucaryl\n|[[Goodwood Racecourse|Goodwood]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1967|08|28}}\t\n|1st\n|Virginia Stakes\n|<span style=\"display:none\">10</span>1m2f\n|[[Edward Hide]]\n|Future Fame\n|[[Newcastle Racecourse|Newcastle]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1967|09|07}}\t\n|1st\n|Crathorne Sweepstakes\n|<span style=\"display:none\">8</span>1m\n|[[Edward Hide]]\n|Scottish Sinbad\n|[[York Racecourse|York]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1967|09|16}}\t\n|3rd\n|Wavertree Sweepstakes\n|<span style=\"display:none\">10</span>1m2f\n|[[Doug Smith (jockey)|Doug Smith]]\n|Fair Winter\n|[[Newmarket_Racecourse|Newmarket]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1967|10|21}}\t\n|3rd\n|[[Cambridgeshire Handicap]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">9</span>1m1f\n|[[Scobie Breasley]]\n|Lacquer\n|[[Newmarket_Racecourse|Newmarket]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1968|8|17}}\t\n|4th\n|[[Prix Gontaut-Biron]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">10</span>1m2f\n|[[Scobie Breasley]]\n|Frontal\n|[[Deauville-La Touques Racecourse|Deauville]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1968|8|26}}\t\n|1st\n|Prix Ridgway\n|<span style=\"display:none\">10</span>1m2f\n|[[Scobie Breasley]]\n|Right Honourable\n|[[Deauville-La Touques Racecourse|Deauville]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1968|9|28}}\t\n|2nd\n|[[Queen Elizabeth II Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">8</span>1m\n|[[Scobie Breasley]]\n|World Cup\n|[[Ascot Racecourse|Ascot]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1968|10|19}}\t\n|2nd\n|[[Cambridgeshire Handicap]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">9</span>1m1f\n|[[Scobie Breasley]]\n|Emerilo\n|[[Newmarket_Racecourse|Newmarket]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1969|5|10}}\t\n|2nd\n|Jubilee Stakes\n|<span style=\"display:none\">10</span>1m2f\n|Jimmy Lindley\n|Sovereign Ruler\n|[[Kempton_Park_Racecourse|Kempton Park]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1969|5|31}}\t\n|6th\n|[[Lockinge Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">8</span>1m\n|Jimmy Lindley\n|[[Habitat (horse)|Habitat]]\n|[[Newbury_Racecourse|Newbury]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1969|6|17}}\t\n|2nd\n|[[Prince of Wales's Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">10</span>1m2f\n|[[Lester Piggott]]\n|[[Connaught (horse)|Connaught]]\n|[[Ascot Racecourse|Ascot]]\n|-\n|-\n| {{dts|format=dmy|1969|7|5}}\t\n|1st\n|[[Eclipse Stakes]]\n|<span style=\"display:none\">10</span>1m2f\n|[[Lester Piggott]]\n|[[Park Top]]\n|[[Sandown Park Racecourse|Sandown Park]]\n|-\n|}\n\n==Stud career==\nWhen owner [[Hope Goddard Iselin]] retired at the age of 102, the horses she still had in training were sent to be sold at Newmarket. The one exception was Wolver Hollow who was given to his former trainer [[Cecil Boyd-Rochfort]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/> On Wolver Hollow's retirement, he was syndicated by the Curragh Bloodstock Agency and initially stood at Athgarvan Stud, The Curragh.<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1970 |title=Racehorses of 1969|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=999}}</ref> Through a friendship between Boyd-Rochfort and Billy Iceton, Wolver Hollow spent his latter breeding career at Tara Stud in County Meath.<ref>Griffiths, Richard. \"Tributes paid after death of renowned stud master Billy Iceton, aged 81.\" Racing Post, May 20, 2010: 17.</ref> Wolver Hollow enjoyed success with his first crop, spearheaded by the classic winning [[Furry Glen]]. His greatest achievement as a stallion came in 1976 when the Henry Cecil trained [[Wollow]] won five top class races, enabling his sire to become the leading sire in the UK and Ireland. Wollow's contribution to this achievement can not be understated. Wolver Hollow earned his accolade with a record of 34 wins from 18 horses amassing \u00a3192,362 in prize money - \u00a3166,389 of which was won by Wollow. Indeed, Wollow's earnings were such that they eclipsed the \u00a3166,323 earned by the progeny of [[Vaguely Noble]], that season's second leading sire.<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1977 |title=Racehorses of 1976|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=825}}</ref> Unsurprisingly, this would represent the zenith of Wolver Hollow's stallion career and while he would produce a further handful of useful horses, none of them would win at the highest level. \n\nAs a damsire, Wolver Hollow could not count any European Group One winners among his descendants although Love A Show was victorious in the 1983 [[Blue Diamond Stakes]].

In a career spanning four seasons, his performances in handicaps and top class company, including victory in the 1969 [[Eclipse Stakes]], established him as a talented racehorse without being exceptional. He would achieve greater success as a stallion whereupon retiring to stud where he became [[Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland|Champion Sire]] in Britain.\n\n==Background==\n\nBy Sovereign Path and out of Cygnet, Wolver Hollow was sold as a yearling, fetching 4,000 guineas<ref>SNOW,, JIM. \"Wolver Hollow shows his class.\" Times, September 8, 1967, 14.

As a sire, he produced sixteen crops of racehorses, the most notable of which was [[Humble Duty]]. Nevertheless, he also counted multiple big race winners among his progeny including Town Crier ([[Queen Anne Stakes]]), Supreme Sovereign ([[Lockinge Stakes]]) and Spanish Express ([[Middle Park Stakes]])<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1977 |title=Racehorses of 1976|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=936}}</ref>. While Wolver Hollow's dam Cygnet, by undefeated champion racehorse [[Caracalla (horse)|Caracalla]], did not hail from an immediately prolific family, her third dam, Sunshot, was the granddam of classic winners Resplendent (1926 [[Irish Oaks]] and dam of [[Windsor Lad]]) and Sol Speranza who won the same two classics in 1937.<ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=1943 |title=Bloodstock Breeders Annual Review |url= |journal=Bloodstock Breeders Annual Review |volume=32 |issue= |pages=73 |doi= |access-date=}}</ref> Alongside Wolver Hollow, Cygnet produced nine other foals including Gaybrook Swan, second in the 1970 [[Northern Dancer Turf Stakes|Niagara Handicap]] and Tall Dream, runner up in both the [[Vincent O'Brien National Stakes|National Stakes]] and [[Beresford Stakes]] of 1971.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloodstockreports.co.uk/weatherbys/wbr/orderreports/orderReportParameters.jsp?listSection=FR&listSectionName=Free%20Reports&countryCode=GB&optNo=79&priceId=1 |title=Weatherbys Bloodstock Reports |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://galopp-sieger.de/galoppsieger/pferd_html?pschl=Tall%20DreamTamerlane |title=Gallop Sieger |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===1966: two-year-old season===\nWolver Hollow made his debut in the 1966 New Stakes, now known as the [[Norfolk Stakes (Great Britain)|Norfolk Stakes]], at Ascot where he finished four lengths behind the Johnson Houghton trained Falcon.<ref>FROM OUR RACING CORRESPONDENT. \"Fighting Charlie falters but wins easily.\" Times, June 17, 1966, 5.</ref> On his second start, he finished behind Falcon again when fourth in the [[National Stakes (Sandown Park)|National Stakes]] at Sandown<ref>\"Sandown Park Details\" Times, 21 July 1966, p. 5.</ref> - a course incidentally where Falcon would win the following season's [[Temple Stakes]]. Wolver Hollow would then be unplaced at Kempton before rounding off the season finishing fourth of thirteen starters in the [[Dewhurst Stakes]] behind the next season's English and Irish Derby third Dart Board.\n\n===1967: three-year-old season===\nNewbury would be Wolver Hollow's first port of call in 1967 where he would contest the [[Greenham Stakes]], a traditional trial for the [[2000 Guineas]]. Finishing third by a neck and a head, this was the closest he had come to shedding his maiden tag. However, it was not the strongest Guineas trial given that neither of the front two were entered for the classic.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Classic horses not impressive.\" Times, April 24, 1967, 12.</ref> While it transpired to be useful form, (the runner up,[[Reform (horse)|Reform]], would become the leading miler of the season), Wolver Hollow started at an unfancied 40/1 when finishing unplaced on his next start in the Guineas.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Royal Palace beats milers at their own game.\" Times, May 4, 1967, 13.</ref> Returning to the Royal Ascot meeting where he made his debut the previous year, Wolver Hollow again ran into Reform finishing just under a length and a half fourth in the [[St James's Palace Stakes]].<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Steeple Aston can go one better in Hunt Cup.\" Times, 21 June 1967, p. 11.</ref> At the Goodwood meeting, Wolver Hollow entered handicap company with a reasonable fifth under second top-weight, giving a pound to Irish Derby runner up Sucaryl and six pounds to [[Falmouth Stakes]] winner Resilience.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Hopes vanish as Caergwrle heads for Midhurst.\" Times, 29 July 1967, p. 14.</ref> A step down in class a month later facilitated Wolver Hollow finally losing his maiden tag as he won the ten furlong Virginia Stakes at Newcastle. While the contest was effectively a maiden race, Wolver Hollow only had to be shaken up to win by four lengths.<ref>SNOW, JIM. \"Northern Racing.\" Times, August 29, 1967, 11.</ref> Little over a week later, Wolver Hollow doubled his tally with success in the one mile Crathorne Sweepstakes at York. There he faced three rivals;- Worthy Friend, a long priced outsider, [[Epsom Derby|Derby]] also-ran Scottish Sinbad who won a handicap at the same Newcastle meeting where Wolver Hollow was victorious, and [[Queen Anne Stakes]] runner up Arenaria who was in receipt of ten pounds.<ref>SNOW,, JIM. \"Scottish Sinbad is best choice.\" Times, 7 Sept. 1967, p. 14.</ref> Scottish Sinbad made the running but was closely tracked by Wolver Hollow under a motionless Edward Hide who sent his mount home inside the final furlong to win by a length and a half with Arenaria a further two lengths behind.

The first appearance came when fourth in the [[Prix Gontaut-Biron]] won by Frontal - himself fourth in the previous season's [[Prix du Jockey Club]]. On ground considered too soft for him, he was squeezed out of third by a head by Grandier who went on to win a [[Prix d'Ispahan]] and a [[Prix Ganay]] as well as finish third in a [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]].<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Rehearsal for Hopeful Venture.\" Times, 26 Aug. 1968, p. 12.</ref> Nine days later, Wolver Hollow ventured into calmer waters when winning the Prix Ridgway from Right Honourable and Atopolis. <ref>PAR, R.

Next in the weights was [[Diadem Stakes]] winner Secret Ray on 9st 6lbs, [[Jersey Stakes]] third Paddy Me on 9st 4lbs, the same weight as previous year's runner up Straight Master while [[Yorkshire Oaks]] winner Exchange, carrying 9st, was sent off favourite.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Sir Ivor has stamina to win 'Champion'.\" Times, 19 Oct. 1968, p. 7.</ref> Wolver Hollow ran a career best to finish second, going down by a neck to Emirilo despite conceding twenty-seven pounds.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Great win for Sir Ivor at Newmarket.\" Times, 21 Oct. 1968, p. 11.</ref>\n\n===1969: five-year-old season===\n[[Henry Cecil|Henry Cecil's]] first season as a racehorse trainer would be spearheaded by Wolver Hollow's final season as a racehorse. His reappearance came in the Mark Lane Jubilee Stakes, a ten furlong handicap over ten furlongs on very soft ground. There he faced a stiff task sitting on top of the handicap conceding upwards of seven pounds to winners of the [[Rosebery Stakes]] and the [[City and Suburban Handicap]] along with the previous year's winner.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Wolver Hollow can survive stern test.\" Times, May 10, 1969, 6.</ref> In the event, bottom weight Sovereign Ruler won by a facile eight lengths and would go on to win two and twice finish placed in valuable handicaps through the rest of the season.<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1970 |title=Racehorses of 1969|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=671}}</ref> Wolver Hollow finished runner up while conceding thirty-five pounds to the well handicapped winner and was very much considered a contender going into the [[Lockinge Stakes]] on his next start.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Jimmy Reppin may take Lockinge Stakes.\" Times, 31 May 1969, p. 6.</ref> However, he would finish a tailed off last of six behind [[Habitat (horse)|Habitat]] and subsequently underwent a dope test.<ref>BAERLEIN, RICHARD. \"Lockinge Goes to Habitat.\" The Observer, Jun 01, 1969. P. 21.</ref> Wolver Hollow's penultimate start came at Royal Ascot in the [[Prince of Wales's Stakes]] where he would be ridden by [[Lester Piggot]] for the first time. Here he faced four rivals in the shape of [[Noel Murless|Noel Murless's]] top class [[Connaught (horse)|Connaught]], [[Epsom Derby]] also-ran Stoned and a couple of high class handicappers.<ref>PHILLIPS, MICHAEL. \"Prince Tenderfoot may be too fast for rivals.\" Times, 17 June 1969, p. 13.</ref> Class told with Connaught making all to win by five lengths ahead of Wolver Hollow, with stoned a further two lengths behind in third.<ref>SNOW, JIM. \"Double for Barclay.\" Times, June 18, 1969, 13.</ref> Wolver Hollow's career would be defined by his final start in the [[Eclipse Stakes]] where he would also be the last horse to carry his owner's colours.<ref name=\"auto1\">BAERLEIN, RICHARD. \"Big Prize for Last Runner.\" The Observer (1901- 2003), Jul 06, 1969, p. 19.</ref> Coughing forced Connaught and Ribofilio (Irish Derby second) to miss their engagement while the useful Remand was withdrawn leaving seven runners to face the starter at Sandown. High class continental form was well represented with Light Wind, who had won that season's [[Premio Presidente della Repubblica]], Hogarth who won the 1968 [[Derby Italiano]] and Timmy My Boy who finished runner up in that year's [[Prix du Jockey Club]]. Royal Rocket was third in the [[Brigadier Gerard Stakes|Coronation Stakes]] while sole three year old runner Rocked finished third in the [[Greenham Stakes]]. Park Top, bidding to become the first mare to win in the race's history, came into the race three from three for the season collecting the Prix de la Seine, the [[Coronation Cup]] and the [[Hardwicke Stakes]] along the way.<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1970 |title=Racehorses of 1969|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=509}}</ref>. Waiting tactics were typically employed on Park Top and controversially, this would be her undoing in the race. As described in Timeform's Racehorses of 1969 \"Wolver Hollow turned for home behind Park Top, came up the rails, gradually made his way to the front after an uninterrupted run, and led throughout the last furlong to win comfortably. Park Top, on the other hand, had several positions in the straight. She ran into the heels of the pacemaking Rocked two furlongs out, and after making her way round that horse she found her way blocked by the Italian Derby winner Hogarth. By the time she had moved out to come round Hogarth on the wide outside she had no chance of catching Wolver Hollow: she had used up most of her energy finding a way through, and courage wasn't enough to win her the prize.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1970 |title=Racehorses of 1969|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=510}}</ref> Park Top would win the [[King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes]] next time under Lester Piggot, confirming that she was superior to her Sandown showing.

His greatest achievement as a stallion came in 1976 when the Henry Cecil trained [[Wollow]] won five top class races, enabling his sire to become the leading sire in the UK and Ireland. Wollow's contribution to this achievement can not be understated. Wolver Hollow earned his accolade with a record of 34 wins from 18 horses amassing \u00a3192,362 in prize money - \u00a3166,389 of which was won by Wollow. Indeed, Wollow's earnings were such that they eclipsed the \u00a3166,323 earned by the progeny of [[Vaguely Noble]], that season's second leading sire.<ref>{{cite book |last=Timeform |date=1977 |title=Racehorses of 1976|location=London |publisher=Portway Press Limited |page=825}}</ref> Unsurprisingly, this would represent the zenith of Wolver Hollow's stallion career and while he would produce a further handful of useful horses, none of them would win at the highest level. \n\nAs a damsire, Wolver Hollow could not count any European Group One winners among his descendants although Love A Show was victorious in the 1983 [[Blue Diamond Stakes]]. Other horses of note include Reach, winner of the 1984 [[Royal Lodge Stakes]], Festive Cheer, third in the 1991 [[Phoenix Stakes]], Treasure Hope, winner of the 1992 [[Premio Regina Elena]] (Italian 1000 Guineas), and Wrapping, a runner up in the 1989 [[Oaks d'Italia]]. Wolver Hollow was also the damsire of several useful [[National Hunt]] horses such as Simply Dashing, a high class handicap chaser who finished second in a [[Charlie Hall Chase]], 1992 [[Baring Bingham Novices' Hurdle]] winner Thetford Forest and useful handicapper Latent Talent. \n\nHe was euthanised due to deteriorating health on 13 June 1987.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pedigreequery.com/wolver+hollow|title=Wolver Hollow Horse Pedigree|website=www.pedigreequery.com}}</ref>\n\n===Notable progeny===\n\n''c = [[colt (horse)|colt]], f = [[filly]], g = [[gelding]]''\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\" font-size:80%\"\n|- style=\"background:#eee;\"\n| style=\"width:35px;\"| '''Foaled'''\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| '''Name'''\n| style=\"width:120px;\"| '''Dam'''\n| style=\"width:35px;\"| '''Sex'''\n| style=\"width:510px;\"| '''Major Wins and Notable Performances'''\n|-\n| 1971\n| Charlie Bubbles\n| Sixandahalf\n| c\n| 1st [[Hardwicke Stakes]] (1975)\n|-\n|-\n| 1971\n| [[Furry Glen]]\n| Cleftess\n| c\n| 1st [[Marble Hill Stakes]] (1973) 1st [[Leopardstown Stakes|Mullion Stakes]] (1973) 1st [[Irish 2000 Guineas]] (1974) 1st [[International Stakes (Ireland)|Whitehall Stakes]] (1974) 2nd [[Vauxhall Trial Stakes]] (1974) 2nd [[Gallinule Stakes]] (1974) 3rd [[Coventry Stakes]] (1973) 3rd Larkspur Stakes (1973) \n|-\n|-\n| 1971\n| Wanlockhead\n| Exultation\n| c\n| 3rd [[Gordon Richards Stakes|Westbury Stakes]] (1975)\n|-\n|-\n| 1973\n| [[Wollow]]\n| Wichuraiana\n| c\n| 1st [[Champagne Stakes (Great Britain)|Champagne Stakes]] (1975) 1st [[Dewhurst Stakes]] (1975) 1st [[Greenham Stakes]] (1976) 1st [[2000 Guineas]] (1976) 1st [[Eclipse Stakes]] (1976) 1st [[Sussex Stakes]] (1976) 1st [[International Stakes|Benson & Hedges Gold Cup]] (1976)\n|-\n|-\n| 1973\n| Wolverlife\n| Miralife\n| c\n| 3rd [[Duke of York Stakes]] (1977) 3rd [[Palace House Stakes]] (1977) 3rd [[Diamond Jubilee Stakes|Cork and Orrery Stakes]]\n|-\n|-\n| 1975\n| My Hollow\n| Saucy Mine\n| f\n| 1st [[Royal Whip Stakes]] (1980) 1st [[Desmond Stakes]] (1980) 2nd [[Blandford Stakes]] (1980)\n|-\n|-\n| 1976\n| Galaxy Libra\n| Garden of Eden\n| c\n| 1st [[Man o' War Stakes]] (1981) 2nd [[Joe Hirsch Turf Classic Invitational Stakes]] (1981) 3rd [[Charles Whittingham Stakes|Hollywood Invitational Handicap]] (1981) 3rd [[Washington, D.C.

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kill it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kill it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

Canada lynxes shun open areas despite good prey availability; they face difficulty surviving in heavily logged areas and agricultural land, though they can thrive well in deforested areas which have been left to regenerate for 15 years or more. In the past the lynx occurred from the northern United States (in 24 States), possibly up to the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[New Mexico]], to the [[tree line]] in the Arctic through coniferous forests in Alaska and Canada. The lynx continues to occur in most of Alaska and its erstwhile range in Canada. In the United States, the lynx occurs in the  [[Blue Mountains (Pacific Northwest)|Blue Mountains]], [[Cascade Range]] and southern Rocky Mountains, [[Great Lakes region]] and [[New England]].

In eastern Canada the lynx is threatened by competition with the [[eastern coyote]], whose numbers in the region have rose in the last few decades. Habitat loss is the main threat in the [[contiguous United States]], while trapping is a relatively insignificant cause of mortality.

The two triangle-shaped arms form a shroud around the cold target to protect it until they open five seconds before a shot.]]\n\nThe '''National Ignition Facility''' ('''NIF'''), is a large [[laser]]-based [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) research device, located at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in [[Livermore, California]]. NIF uses lasers to heat and compress a small amount of [[Fusion power#Fuels|hydrogen fuel]] with the goal of inducing [[nuclear fusion]] reactions. NIF's mission is to achieve [[fusion ignition]] with high [[fusion energy gain factor|energy gain]], and to support [[nuclear weapon]] [[stockpile stewardship|maintenance]] and design by studying the [[equation of state|behavior of matter]] under the conditions found within nuclear weapons.<ref>[https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/ \"About NIF & Photon Science\"], Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</ref> NIF is the largest and most energetic ICF device built to date, and the largest laser in the world.\n\nThe basic concept of all ICF devices is to rapidly collapse a small amount of fuel so the pressure and temperature reach fusion-relevant conditions. NIF does this by heating the outer layer of a small plastic sphere with the world's most powerful [[laser]]. The energy from the laser is so intense that it causes the plastic to explode, squeezing down on the fuel inside. The speed of this process is enormous, with the fuel reaching a peak around 350&nbsp;km/s,<ref>{{ref web |url=https://www.theengineer.co.uk/tracing-the-sources-of-nuclear-fusion/ |first=Stuart |last=Nathan |title=Tracing the sources of nuclear fusion |website=The Engineer}}</ref> raising the density from about that of water to about 100 times that of [[lead]]. The delivery of energy and the [[adiabatic process]] during collapse raises the temperature of the fuel to hundreds of millions of degrees. At these temperatures, fusion processes occur very rapidly, before the energy generated in the fuel causes it to explode outward as well.\n\nConstruction on the NIF began in 1997 but management problems and technical delays slowed progress into the early 2000s. Progress after 2000 was smoother, but compared to initial estimates, NIF was completed five years behind schedule and was almost four times more expensive than originally budgeted.

The target is a small spherical pellet containing a few milligrams of fusion fuel, typically a mix of [[deuterium]] (D) and [[tritium]] (T). The energy of the laser heats the surface of the pellet into a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], which explodes off the surface. The remaining portion of the target is driven inward, eventually compressing it into a small point of extremely high density. The rapid blowoff also creates a [[shock wave]] that travels toward the center of the compressed fuel from all sides. When it reaches the center of the fuel, a small volume is further heated and compressed to a greater degree. When the temperature and density of that small spot are raised high enough, fusion reactions occur and release energy.<ref name=how>[https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nif/how_nif_works/ \"How NIF works\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527191346/https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nif/how_nif_works/ |date=2010-05-27 }}, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

If this process deposits enough energy in a given area it can cause that fuel to undergo fusion as well. However, the fuel is also losing heat through [[x-ray]] losses and hot electrons leaving the fuel area, so the rate of alpha heating must be greater than these losses, a condition known as ''bootstrapping''.<ref name=hurricane>{{cite web |url=https://www.llnl.gov/news/climbing-mountain-fusion-ignition-interview-omar-hurricane |title=Climbing the mountain of fusion ignition: an interview with Omar Hurricane |website=LLNL}}</ref> Given the right overall conditions of the compressed fuel\u2014high enough density and temperature\u2014this bootstrapping process will result in a [[chain reaction]], burning outward from the center where the shock wave started the reaction.

Calculations show that the energy must be delivered quickly in order to compress the core before it disassembles. The laser energy also must be focused extremely evenly across the target's outer surface in order to collapse the fuel into a symmetric core. Although other drivers have been suggested, notably heavy ions driven in [[particle accelerator]]s, lasers are currently the only devices with the right combination of features.<ref>Per F.

The design uses 192 beamlines in a parallel system of flashlamp-pumped, neodymium-doped phosphate glass lasers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Press release: NNSA and LLNL announce first successful integrated experiment at NIF|url=https://www.llnl.gov/news/nnsa-and-llnl-announce-first-successful-integrated-experiment-nif|work=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|date=6 October 2010|language=en}}</ref>\n\nTo ensure that the output of the beamlines is uniform, the initial laser light is amplified from a single source in the Injection Laser System (ILS). This starts with a low-power flash of 1053-nanometer (nm) infra-red light generated in an [[ytterbium]]-doped optical [[fiber laser]] known as the Master Oscillator.<ref>P.J. Wisoff et al., ''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5341..146W NIF Injection Laser System]'', Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 5341, pages 146\u2013155</ref>  The light from the Master Oscillator is split and directed into 48 Preamplifier Modules (PAMs). Each PAM contains a two-stage amplification process. The first stage is a regenerative amplifier in which the pulse circulates 30 to 60 times, increasing in energy from nanojoules to tens of millijoules. The light then passes four times through a circuit containing a [[neodymium]] glass amplifier similar to (but much smaller than) the ones used in the main beamlines, boosting the nanojoules of light created in the Master Oscillator to about 6&nbsp;joules. According to [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), the design of the PAMs was one of the major challenges during construction. Improvements to the design since then have allowed them to surpass their initial design goals.<ref>''[http://www.llnl.gov/str/Powell.html Keeping Laser Development on Target for the NIF]'', Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

On the left are the amplifiers and [[Pockels effect|optical switch]], and on the right is the final spatial filter, switchyard and [[optical frequency multiplier|optical frequency converter]].]]\n\nThe main amplification takes place in a series of glass amplifiers located at one end of the beamlines. Before firing, the amplifiers are first [[optical pumping|optically pumped]] by a total of 7,680 [[xenon flash lamp]]s (the PAMs have their own smaller flash lamps as well). The lamps are powered by a [[capacitor]] bank which stores a total of 422&nbsp;MJ (117&nbsp;kWh) of electrical energy. When the wavefront passes through them, the amplifiers release some of the light energy stored in them into the beam. To improve the energy transfer the beams are sent though the main amplifier section four times, using an [[Pockels effect|optical switch]] located in a mirrored cavity. In total these amplifiers boost the original 6&nbsp;J provided by the PAMs to a nominal 4&nbsp;MJ.<ref name=how/> Given the time scale of a few billionths of a second, the peak UV power delivered to the target is correspondingly very high, 500&nbsp;TW.\n\nNear the center of each beamline, and taking up the majority of the total length, are ''[[spatial filter]]s''. These consist of long tubes with small telescopes at the end that focus the laser beam down to a tiny point in the center of the tube, where a [[photomask|mask]] cuts off any stray light outside the focal point. The filters ensure that the image of the beam when it reaches the target is extremely uniform, removing any light that was misfocused by imperfections in the optics upstream. Spatial filters were a major step forward in ICF work when they were introduced in the [[Cyclops laser]], an earlier LLNL experiment.\n\nThe total length of the path the laser beam propagates from one end to the other, including switches, is about {{convert|1500|m|ft|sp=us}}. The various optical elements in the beamlines are generally packaged into Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), standardized boxes about the size of a vending machine that can be dropped out of the beamline for replacement from below.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1117/12.538467 |bibcode=2004SPIE.5341..127L |chapter=NIF laser line-replaceable units (LRUs) |title=Optical Engineering at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory II: The National Ignition Facility |volume=5341 |page=127 |year=2004 |last1=Larson |first1=Doug W. |chapter-url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1410354/ |editor1-last=Lane |editor1-first=Monya A |editor2-last=Wuest |editor2-first=Craig R }}</ref>\n\nAfter the amplification is complete the light is switched back into the beamline, where it runs to the far end of the building to the ''target chamber''.

Since the length of the overall path from the Master Oscillator to the target is different for each of the beamlines, optics are used to delay the light in order to ensure all of them reach the center within a few picoseconds of each other.<ref>Arnie Heller, ''[https://www.llnl.gov/str/JulAug05/VanArsdall.html Orchestrating the World's Most Powerful Laser]'', Science & Technology Review, July/August 2005.

After several passes through the beamlines the light is sent into the \"switchyard\" (red) where it is aimed into the target chamber (silver).]]\n\nOne of the last steps in the process before reaching the target chamber is to convert the infrared (IR) light at 1053&nbsp;nm into the ultraviolet (UV) at 351&nbsp;nm in a device known as a [[optical frequency multiplier|frequency converter]].<ref>P.J. Wegner et al.,''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5341..180W NIF final optics system: frequency conversion and beam conditioning]'', Proceedings of SPIE 5341, May 2004, pages 180\u2013189.</ref> These are made of thin sheets (about 1&nbsp;cm thick) cut from a single crystal of [[potassium dihydrogen phosphate]]. When the 1053&nbsp;nm (IR) light passes through the first of two of these sheets, frequency addition converts a large fraction of the light into 527&nbsp;nm light (green). On passing through the second sheet, frequency combination converts much of the 527&nbsp;nm light and the remaining 1053&nbsp;nm light into 351&nbsp;nm (UV) light. [[Infrared]] (IR) light is much less effective than UV at heating the targets, because IR couples more strongly with hot [[electrons]] which will absorb a considerable amount of energy and interfere with compression. The conversion process can reach peak efficiencies of about 80 percent for a laser pulse that has a flat [[time|temporal]] shape, but the temporal shape needed for ignition varies significantly over the duration of the pulse. The actual conversion process is about 50 percent efficient, reducing delivered energy to a nominal 1.8&nbsp;MJ.<ref>Bibeau, Camille; Paul J.

In existing (non-weapon) fusion experiments the heat produced by the fusion reactions rapidly escapes from the plasma, meaning that external heating must be applied continually in order to keep the reactions going. Ignition refers to the point at which the energy given off in the fusion reactions currently underway is high enough to sustain the temperature of the fuel against those losses. This causes a chain-reaction that allows the majority of the fuel to undergo a nuclear ''burn''. Ignition is considered a key requirement if [[fusion power]] is to ever become practical.<ref name=econ/>\n\nNIF is designed primarily to use the ''indirect drive'' method of operation, in which the laser heats a small metal cylinder instead of the capsule inside it. The heat causes the cylinder, known as a [[hohlraum]] (German for \"hollow room\", or cavity), to re-emit the energy as intense [[X-ray]]s, which are more evenly distributed and symmetrical than the original laser beams. Experimental systems, including the [[OMEGA laser|OMEGA]] and [[Nova laser]]s, validated this approach through the late 1980s.<ref>J.D.

During these meetings, the idea later known as [[PACER (fusion)|PACER]] first developed. PACER envisioned the explosion of small [[hydrogen bomb]]s in large caverns to generate steam that would be converted into electrical power. After identifying several problems with this approach, Nuckolls became interested in understanding how small a bomb could be made that would still generate net positive power.<ref name=EarlyNuckolls/>\n\nThere are two parts to a typical hydrogen bomb, a plutonium-based fission bomb known as the ''primary'', and a cylindrical arrangement of fusion fuels known as the ''secondary''. The primary releases significant amounts of x-rays, which are trapped within the bomb casing and heat and compress the secondary until it undergoes ignition. The secondary consists of [[lithium deuteride]] fuel, which requires an external neutron source to begin the reaction. This is normally in the form of a small plutonium \"spark plug\" in the center of the fuel. Nuckolls's idea was to explore how small the secondary could be made, and what effects this would have on the energy needed from the primary to cause ignition. The simplest change is to replace the LiD fuel with D-T gas, removing the need for the spark plug. At that point there is no theoretical smallest size - as the secondary got smaller, so did the amount of energy needed to reach ignition. At the milligram level, the energy levels started to approach those available through several known devices.<ref name=EarlyNuckolls>John Nuckolls, [http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/658936-fpqpjO/webviewable/658936.pdf \"Early Steps Toward Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE)\"], LLNL, 12 June 1998</ref>\n\nBy the early 1960s, Nuckolls and several other weapons designers had developed the outlines of the ICF approach. The D-T fuel would be placed in a small capsule, designed to rapidly ablate when heated and thereby maximize compression and shock wave formation. This capsule would be placed within an engineered shell, the hohlraum, which acted similar to the bomb casing. However, the hohlraum did not have to be heated by x-rays; any source of energy could be used as long as it delivered enough energy to cause the hohlraum itself to heat up and start giving off x-rays. Ideally the energy source would be located some distance away, to mechanically isolate both ends of the reaction. A small atomic bomb could be used as the energy source, as it is in a hydrogen bomb, but ideally smaller energy sources would be used. Using computer simulations, the teams estimated that about 5&nbsp;MJ of energy would be needed from the primary, generating a 1&nbsp;MJ beam.<ref name=\"EarlyNuckolls\"/> To put this in perspective, a small fission primary of 0.5&nbsp;kt releases 2 million MJ in total.<ref>[http://www.unitjuggler.com/convert-energy-from-kT-to-MJ.html \"Convert kilotons, to megajoules\"], Unit Juggler</ref><ref>Nuckolls et al., ''[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v239/n5368/pdf/239139a0.pdf Laser Compression of Matter to Super-High Densities: Thermonuclear (CTR) Applications]'', ''Nature'' Vol. 239, 1972, p. 129</ref><ref>John Lindl, ''[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10126383-6NAuBK/native/10126383.pdf The Edward Teller Medal Lecture: The Evolution Toward Indirect Drive and Two Decades of Progress Toward ICF Ignition and Burn]'', 11th International Workshop on Laser Interaction and Related Plasma Phenomena, December 1994. Retrieved on May 7, 2008.</ref>\n\n===ICF program begins===\nWhile Nuckolls and LLNL were working on hohlraum-based concepts, former weapon designer [[Ray Kidder]] was working on the direct drive concept, using a large number of laser beams to evenly heat the target capsule. In the early 1970s, Kidder formed [[KMS Fusion]] to directly commercialize this concept. This sparked off intense rivalry between Kidder and the weapons labs. Formerly ignored, ICF was now a hot topic and most of the labs soon started ICF efforts of their own.<ref name=EarlyNuckolls/> LLNL decided early on to concentrate on glass lasers, while other facilities studied gas lasers using carbon dioxide (e.g. ANTARES, [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]) or KrF (e.g. [[Nike laser]], [[Naval Research Laboratory]]).\n\nThroughout these early stages of development, much of the understanding of the fusion process was the result of computer simulations, primarily [[LASNEX]]. LASNEX greatly simplified the reaction to a 2-dimensional simulation, which was all that was possible given the amount of computing power at the time. According to LASNEX, laser drivers in the kJ range would have the required properties to reach low gain, which was just within the state of the art. This led to the [[Shiva laser]] project which was completed in 1977. Contrary to predictions, Shiva fell far short of its goals, and the densities reached were thousands of times smaller than predicted. This was traced to issues with the way the laser delivered heat to the target, which delivered most of its energy to [[electron]]s rather than the entire fuel mass. Further experiments and simulations demonstrated that this process could be dramatically improved by using shorter wavelengths of laser light.\n\nFurther upgrades to the simulation programs, accounting for these effects, predicted a new design that would reach ignition. This new system emerged as the 20-beam 200&nbsp;kJ [[Nova laser]] concept. During the initial construction phase, Nuckolls found an error in his calculations, and an October 1979 review chaired by John Foster Jr. of [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] confirmed that there was no way Nova would reach ignition. The Nova design was then modified into a smaller 10-beam design that added frequency conversion to 351&nbsp;nm light, which would increase coupling efficiency.<ref name=peer>{{cite techreport |first1=Matthew |last1=McKinzie |first2=Christopher |last2=Paine |url=http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/nif2/findings.asp |title=When Peer Review Fails |publisher=NDRC}}</ref> In operation, Nova was able to deliver about 30&nbsp;kJ of UV laser energy, about half of what was initially expected, primarily due to limits set by optical damage to the final focusing optics. Even at those levels, it was clear that the predictions for fusion production were still wrong; even at the limited powers available, fusion yields were far below predictions.\n\n===Halite and Centurion===\nWith each experiment, the predicted energy needed to reach ignition rose, and it was not clear that post-Nova predictions were any more accurate than earlier ones. The [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) decided that direct experimentation was the best way to settle the issue, and in 1978 they started a series of underground experiments at the [[Nevada Test Site]] that used small nuclear bombs to illuminate ICF targets. The tests were known as Halite or Centurion depending on which lab ran it, LLNL or LANL.\n\nEach test was able to simultaneously illuminate many targets, allowing them to test the amount of x-ray energy needed by placing the targets at different distances from the bomb. Another question was how large the fuel assembly had to be in order for the fuel to self-heat from the fusion reactions and thus reach ignition. Initial data were available by mid-1984, and the testing ceased in 1988. Ignition was achieved for the first time during these tests, but the amount of energy and the size of the fuel targets needed to reach ignition was far higher than predicted.<ref name=secretadvance>{{cite newspaper |title=Secret Advance in Nuclear Fusion Spurs a Dispute Among Scientists |first=William |last=Broad |date=21 March 1988 |newspaper=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/21/us/secret-advance-in-nuclear-fusion-spurs-a-dispute-among-scientists.html}}</ref> During this same period, experiments began on Nova using similar targets to understand their behaviour under laser illumination, allowing direct comparison against the results obtained from the bomb tests.<ref>John Lindl, \"A strategy for determining the driver requirements for high gain ICF implosions utilizing hydrodynamically equivalent capsules on Nova laser\", Laser Annual Program Report, 1981, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, Livermore, CA, UCRL-50055-80/81, pp.2-29-2-57 (unpublished)</ref>\n\nData from the tests suggested that about 10&nbsp;MJ of x-ray energy would be needed to reach ignition.<ref name=secretadvance/><ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Math+society+says+no+to+SDI+funding.-a06540237 \"Laser advance amid pros and con(fusion)s of DOE fusion path\"], Free Online Library, 1988</ref><ref>John Lindl, Rober McCrory and Michael Campbell, [http://www.physics.utoronto.ca/~phy189h1/Ignition%20and%20Inertial%20Confinement%20Fusion.pdf \"Progress Toward Ignition and Burn Propagation in Inertial Confinement Fusion\"], ''Physics Today'', September 1992, pp. 32-40.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/10455/|title=Infighting Among Rival Theorists Imperils 'Hot' Fusion Lab Plan|author=|date=|website=The Scientist}}</ref><ref>Phillip Schewe and Ben Stein, [http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/News/Lindl.txt \"Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) Article Announcement\"], ''Physics News'', 25 October 1995</ref> If this energy is supplied by an IR laser to a hohlraum, as in Nova or NIF, this corresponds to an original laser energy on the order of 100&nbsp;MJ, well beyond the reach of existing technologies.<ref name=secretadvance/>\n\nA great debate broke out in the ICF establishment as a result.<ref name=secretadvance/> One group suggested that they attempt to build a laser of this power; [[Leonardo Mascheroni]] and Claude Phipps designed a new type of [[hydrogen fluoride laser]] that was pumped by high-energy [[electron]]s that would be able to reach the 100&nbsp;MJ limit.

The plans called for the installation of two main banks of laser beamlines, one in the existing Nova beamline room, and the other in the older Shiva building next door, extending through its laser bay and target area into an upgraded Nova target area. The lasers would deliver about 500&nbsp;TW in a 4&nbsp;ns pulse. The upgrades were expected to allow the new Nova to produce fusion yields of between 2 and 10&nbsp;MJ.<ref name=upgrade/> The initial estimates from 1992 estimated construction costs around $400&nbsp;million, with construction taking place from 1995 to 1999.\n\n===NIF emerges===\nThroughout this period, the ending of the [[Cold War]] led to dramatic changes in defense funding and priorities. As the need for nuclear weapons was greatly reduced and various arms limitation agreements led to a reduction in warhead count, the US was faced with the prospect of losing a generation of nuclear weapon designers able to maintain the existing stockpiles, or design new weapons.<ref>William Broad, ''[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE4D9133DF932A15755C0A962958260 Vast Laser Plan Would Further Fusion and Keep Bomb Experts]'', New York Times, June 21, 1994. Retrieved on May 7, 2008.</ref> At the same time, progress was being made on what would become the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]], which would ban all [[critical mass|criticality]] testing. This would make the reliable development of newer generations of nuclear weapons much more difficult.\n\n[[File:Preamplifier at the National Ignition Facility.jpg|left|400px|thumb|The preamplifiers of the National Ignition Facility are the first step in increasing the energy of laser beams as they make their way toward the target chamber. In 2012 NIF achieved a 500 terawatt shot\u20141,000 times more power than the [[electric energy consumption#World electricity consumption (2012)|United States uses at any instant in time]].]]\nOut of these changes came the [[Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program]] (SSMP), which, among other things, included funds for the development of methods to design and build nuclear weapons that would work without having to be explosively tested. In a series of meetings that started in 1995, an agreement formed between the labs to divide up the SSMP efforts. An important part of this would be confirmation of computer models using low-yield ICF experiments. The Nova Upgrade was too small to use for these experiments,<ref>Letter from Charles Curtis, Undersecretary of Energy, June 15, 1995</ref>{{efn|It is not clearly stated why Nova Upgrade would be too small for SSMP, no reason is given in the available resources.}} and a redesign emerged as NIF in 1994. The estimated cost of the project remained just over $1&nbsp;billion,<ref>1.9 Cost (NIF CDR, Chapter 9)</ref> with completion in 2002.\n\nIn spite of the agreement, the large project cost combined with the ending of similar projects at other labs resulted in several highly critical comments by scientists at other weapons labs, [[Sandia National Laboratories]] in particular. In May 1997, Sandia fusion scientist Rick Spielman publicly stated that NIF had \"virtually no internal peer review on the technical issues\" and that \"Livermore essentially picked the panel to review themselves\".<ref>\"Livermore's costly fusion laser won't fly, scientists say\", Albuquerque Tribune, May 29, 1997, p. 1</ref> A retired Sandia manager, Bob Puerifoy, was even more blunt than Spielman: \"NIF is worthless ... it can't be used to maintain the stockpile, period\".<ref>L. Spohn, \"NIF opponents to cite criticism of laser in court battle\", Albuquerque Tribune, June 13, 1997, p. A15.</ref>\n\nA contrasting view was expressed by Victor Reis, assistant secretary for Defense Programs within DOE and the chief architect of the Stockpile Stewardship Program. Reis told the U.S. House Armed Services Committee in 1997 that NIF was \"designed to produce, for the first time in a laboratory setting, conditions of temperature and density of matter close to those that occur in the detonation of nuclear weapons. The ability to study the behavior of matter and the transfer of energy and radiation under these conditions is key to understanding the basic physics of nuclear weapons and predicting their performance without underground nuclear testing.<ref>Statement of Dr. Victor Reis, Assistant Secretary for Defense Programs, Department of Energy, before the Senate Armed Services Committee, March 19, 1997 (retrieved July 13, 2012 from http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/pa/Director/reisSASC97.html )</ref> Two JASON panels, which are composed of scientific and technical national security experts, have stated that the NIF is the most scientifically valuable of all programs proposed for science-based stockpile stewardship.<ref>Statement of Federico Pe\u00f1a, Secretary, US Dept of Energy, before the Committee on Armed Services, United States Senate, March 26, 1998 (retrieved July 13, 2012 from {{cite web |url=http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/statemnt/980326fp.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205200200/http://armed-services.senate.gov/statemnt/980326fp.htm |archivedate=2011-02-05 }} )</ref>\n\nDespite the initial criticism, Sandia, as well as Los Alamos, provided support in the development of many NIF technologies,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/purl.cover.jsp?purl=/274120-bKjglv/webviewable/274120.pdf |title=Information Bridge: DOE Scientific and Technical Information - Sponsored by OSTI |publisher=Osti.gov |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2012-10-08|last1=Boyes |first1=J. |last2=Boyer |first2=W. |last3=Chael |first3=J. |last4=Cook |first4=D. |last5=Cook |first5=W. |last6=Downey |first6=T. |last7=Hands |first7=J. |last8=Harjes |first8=C. |last9=Leeper |first9=R. |last10=McKay |first10=P. |last11=Micano |first11=P. |last12=Olson |first12=R. |last13=Porter |first13=J. |last14=Quintenz |first14=J. |last15=Roberts |first15=V. |last16=Savage |first16=M. |last17=Simpson |first17=W. |last18=Seth |first18=A. |last19=Smith |first19=R. |last20=Wavrik |first20=M. |last21=Wilson |first21=M. }}</ref> and both laboratories later became partners with NIF in the National Ignition Campaign.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nic/participants.php |title=National Ignition Campaign: Participants, NIF & Photon Science |publisher=Lasers.llnl.gov |accessdate=2012-10-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017203631/https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nic/participants.php |archivedate=2012-10-17 }}</ref>\n\n===Constructing NIF===\n[[File:Beamlet Laser.jpg|thumb|The Beamlet laser tested the design and techniques that would be used on NIF.]]\n[[File:NIF target chamber construction.jpg|thumb|The NIF target chamber was so large it had to be built in sections.]]\nWork on the NIF started with a single beamline demonstrator, Beamlet.

By the time the \"conventional facility\" (the shell for the laser) was complete in 2001, more than 210,000 cubic yards of soil had been excavated, more than 73,000 cubic yards of concrete had been poured, 7,600 tons of reinforcing steel rebar had been placed, and more than 5,000 tons of structural steel had been erected. In addition to its sheer size, building NIF presented a number of unique challenges. To isolate the laser system from vibration, the foundation of each laser bay was made independent of the rest of the structure. Three-foot-thick, 420-foot-long and 80-foot-wide slabs, each containing 3,800 cubic yards of concrete, required continuous concrete pours to achieve their specifications.\n\nThere were also unexpected challenges to cope with: In November, 1997, an El Ni\u00f1o weather front dumped two inches of rain in two hours, flooding the NIF site with 200,000 gallons of water just three days before the scheduled concrete foundation pour.

To everyone's surprise, the Pulsed Power Conditioning Modules (PCMs) suffered capacitor failures that led to explosions. This required a redesign of the module to contain the debris, but since the concrete structure of the buildings holding them had already been poured, this left the new modules so tightly packed that there was no way to do maintenance in-place. Yet another redesign followed, this time allowing the modules to be removed from the bays for servicing.<ref name=peer/> Continuing problems of this sort further delayed the operational start of the project, and in September 1999, an updated DOE report stated that NIF would require up to $350&nbsp;million more and completion would be pushed back to 2006.<ref name=GAO1/>\n\n===Re-baseline and GAO report===\n[[File:Bill Richardson, official DOE photo.png|thumb|Bill Richardson began a review process that brought NIF construction back under control.]]\n\nThroughout this period the problems with NIF were not being reported up the management chain.

By this time, so sure were the experimenters that ignition would be reached that articles began appearing in science magazines stating that it would be announced only a short time after the article was published. [[Scientific American]] started a 2010 review article with the statement \"Ignition is close now. Within a year or two...\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Michael |last=Moyer |title=Fusion's False Dawn |magazine=Scientific American |date=March 2010 |pages=50\u201357}}</ref>\n\nThe first test was carried out on 8 October 2010 at slightly over 1&nbsp;MJ. However, a number of problems slowed the drive toward ignition-level laser energies in the 1.4 to 1.5 MJ range.\n\nProgress was initially slowed by the potential for damage from overheating due to a concentration of energy on optical components that is greater than anything previously attempted.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=superlaser-national-ignition-facility |title=Superlaser fires a blank |author=Eugenie Samuel Reich  |date=October 18, 2010 |magazine=[[Scientific American]] |accessdate=2010-10-02 }}</ref> Other issues included problems layering the fuel inside the targets, and minute quantities of dust being found on the capsule surface.<ref name=kramerreview>David Kramer, [http://blogs.physicstoday.org/politics/2011/04/drive-for-fusion-milestone-ove.html \"NIF overcomes some problems, receives mixed review from its DOE overseer\"], ''Physics Today'', 21 April 2011 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430001208/http://blogs.physicstoday.org/politics/2011/04/drive-for-fusion-milestone-ove.html |date=April 30, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAs the power was increased and targets of increasing sophistication were used, another problem appeared that was causing an asymmetric implosion. This was eventually traced to minute amounts of water vapor in the target chamber which froze to the windows on the ends of the hohlraums. This was solved by re-designing the hohlraum with two layers of glass on either end, in effect creating a storm window.<ref name=\"kramerreview\"/> Steven Koonin, DOE undersecretary for science, visited the lab for an update on the NIC on 23 April, the day after the window problem was announced as solved. On 10 March he had described the NIC as \"a goal of overriding importance for the DOE\" and expressed that progress to date \"was not as rapid as I had hoped\".<ref name=kramerreview/>\n\nNIC shots halted in February 2011, as the machine was turned over to SSMP materials experiments. As these experiments wound down, a series of planned upgrades were carried out, notably a series of improved diagnostic and measurement instruments. Among these changes were the addition of the ARC (Advanced Radiographic Capability) system, which uses 4 of the NIF's 192 beams as a backlighting source for high-speed imaging of the implosion sequence.\n\nARC is essentially a petawatt-class laser with peak power exceeding a quadrillion (10<sup>15</sup>) watts. It is designed to produce brighter, more penetrating, higher-energy x rays than can be obtained with conventional radiographic techniques. When complete, ARC will be the world's highest-energy short-pulse laser, capable of creating picosecond-duration laser pulses to produce energetic x rays in the range of 50-100 keV for backlighting NIF experiments.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://lasers.llnl.gov/news/photons-fusion/2014/may|title= Photons & Fusion Newsletter - May 2014|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= May 2014|website= National Ignition Facility & Photon Science News - Archive - Photons & Fusion Newsletter|publisher= Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|access-date=2015-04-16}}</ref>\n\nNIC runs restarted in May 2011 with the goal of timing the four laser shock waves that compress the fusion target to very high precision.

Koonin]], Under Secretary of Science. The 6th review, May 31, 2012 was chaired by David H. Crandall, Advisor on National Security and Inertial Fusion, Koonin being precluded to chair the review because of a conflict of interest. The review was conducted with the same external reviewers, who had previously served Koonin. Each provided their report independently, with their own estimate of the probability of achieving ignition within the plan, i.e. before December 31, 2012. The conclusion of the review was published on July 19, 2012.<ref name=\"Crandall\">\n{{cite web\n| url=http://fire.pppl.gov/NIF_NIC_report_rev5_koonin_2012.pdf\n| title=External Review of the National Ignition Campaign\n| publisher=[[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]]\n}}</ref>\n\nThe previous review dated January 31, 2012, identified a number of experimental improvements that have been completed or are under way.<ref name=\"Crandall\"/> The new report unanimously praised the quality of the installation: lasers, optics, targets, diagnostics, operations have all been outstanding, however:\n:The integrated conclusion based on this extensive period of experimentation, however, is that considerable hurdles must be overcome to reach ignition or the goal of observing unequivocal alpha heating. Indeed the reviewers note that given the unknowns with the present 'semi-empirical' approach, the probability of ignition before the end of December is extremely low and even the goal of demonstrating unambiguous alpha heating is challenging. (Crandall&nbsp;Memo&nbsp;2012,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;2)\n\nFurther, the report members express deep concerns on the gaps between observed performance and ICF simulation codes such that the current codes are of a limited utility going forward. Specifically, they found a lack of predictive ability of the radiation drive to the capsule and inadequately modeled laser-plasma interactions. These effects lead to pressure being one half to one third of that required for ignition, far below the predicted values. The memo page 5 discusses the mix of ablator material and capsule fuel due likely to hydrodynamics instabilities in the outer surface of the ablator.<ref name=\"Crandall\"/>\n\nThe report goes on to suggest that using a thicker ablator may improve performance, but this increases its inertia. To keep the required implosion speed, they request that the NIF energy be increased to 2MJ. One must also keep in mind that [[Nd:YAG laser|neodymium lasers]] can withstand only a limited amount of energy or risk permanent damage to the optical quality of the lasing medium. The reviewers question whether or not the energy of NIF is sufficient to indirectly compress a large enough capsule to avoid the mix limit and reach ignition.{{sfn|Crandall|2012|p=5}} The report concluded that ignition within the calendar year 2012 is 'highly unlikely'.<ref name=\"Crandall\"/>\n\n===Ignition fails, focus shifts, LIFE ends===\nThe NIC officially ended on September 30, 2012 without achieving ignition.

NIF uses lasers to heat and compress a small amount of [[Fusion power#Fuels|hydrogen fuel]] with the goal of inducing [[nuclear fusion]] reactions. NIF's mission is to achieve [[fusion ignition]] with high [[fusion energy gain factor|energy gain]], and to support [[nuclear weapon]] [[stockpile stewardship|maintenance]] and design by studying the [[equation of state|behavior of matter]] under the conditions found within nuclear weapons.<ref>[https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/ \"About NIF & Photon Science\"], Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</ref> NIF is the largest and most energetic ICF device built to date, and the largest laser in the world.\n\nThe basic concept of all ICF devices is to rapidly collapse a small amount of fuel so the pressure and temperature reach fusion-relevant conditions. NIF does this by heating the outer layer of a small plastic sphere with the world's most powerful [[laser]]. The energy from the laser is so intense that it causes the plastic to explode, squeezing down on the fuel inside. The speed of this process is enormous, with the fuel reaching a peak around 350&nbsp;km/s,<ref>{{ref web |url=https://www.theengineer.co.uk/tracing-the-sources-of-nuclear-fusion/ |first=Stuart |last=Nathan |title=Tracing the sources of nuclear fusion |website=The Engineer}}</ref> raising the density from about that of water to about 100 times that of [[lead]]. The delivery of energy and the [[adiabatic process]] during collapse raises the temperature of the fuel to hundreds of millions of degrees. At these temperatures, fusion processes occur very rapidly, before the energy generated in the fuel causes it to explode outward as well.\n\nConstruction on the NIF began in 1997 but management problems and technical delays slowed progress into the early 2000s. Progress after 2000 was smoother, but compared to initial estimates, NIF was completed five years behind schedule and was almost four times more expensive than originally budgeted.

The target is a small spherical pellet containing a few milligrams of fusion fuel, typically a mix of [[deuterium]] (D) and [[tritium]] (T). The energy of the laser heats the surface of the pellet into a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], which explodes off the surface. The remaining portion of the target is driven inward, eventually compressing it into a small point of extremely high density. The rapid blowoff also creates a [[shock wave]] that travels toward the center of the compressed fuel from all sides. When it reaches the center of the fuel, a small volume is further heated and compressed to a greater degree. When the temperature and density of that small spot are raised high enough, fusion reactions occur and release energy.<ref name=how>[https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nif/how_nif_works/ \"How NIF works\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527191346/https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nif/how_nif_works/ |date=2010-05-27 }}, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

If this process deposits enough energy in a given area it can cause that fuel to undergo fusion as well. However, the fuel is also losing heat through [[x-ray]] losses and hot electrons leaving the fuel area, so the rate of alpha heating must be greater than these losses, a condition known as ''bootstrapping''.<ref name=hurricane>{{cite web |url=https://www.llnl.gov/news/climbing-mountain-fusion-ignition-interview-omar-hurricane |title=Climbing the mountain of fusion ignition: an interview with Omar Hurricane |website=LLNL}}</ref> Given the right overall conditions of the compressed fuel\u2014high enough density and temperature\u2014this bootstrapping process will result in a [[chain reaction]], burning outward from the center where the shock wave started the reaction.

This starts with a low-power flash of 1053-nanometer (nm) infra-red light generated in an [[ytterbium]]-doped optical [[fiber laser]] known as the Master Oscillator.<ref>P.J. Wisoff et al., ''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5341..146W NIF Injection Laser System]'', Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 5341, pages 146\u2013155</ref>  The light from the Master Oscillator is split and directed into 48 Preamplifier Modules (PAMs). Each PAM contains a two-stage amplification process. The first stage is a regenerative amplifier in which the pulse circulates 30 to 60 times, increasing in energy from nanojoules to tens of millijoules. The light then passes four times through a circuit containing a [[neodymium]] glass amplifier similar to (but much smaller than) the ones used in the main beamlines, boosting the nanojoules of light created in the Master Oscillator to about 6&nbsp;joules. According to [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), the design of the PAMs was one of the major challenges during construction. Improvements to the design since then have allowed them to surpass their initial design goals.<ref>''[http://www.llnl.gov/str/Powell.html Keeping Laser Development on Target for the NIF]'', Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

On the left are the amplifiers and [[Pockels effect|optical switch]], and on the right is the final spatial filter, switchyard and [[optical frequency multiplier|optical frequency converter]].]]\n\nThe main amplification takes place in a series of glass amplifiers located at one end of the beamlines. Before firing, the amplifiers are first [[optical pumping|optically pumped]] by a total of 7,680 [[xenon flash lamp]]s (the PAMs have their own smaller flash lamps as well). The lamps are powered by a [[capacitor]] bank which stores a total of 422&nbsp;MJ (117&nbsp;kWh) of electrical energy. When the wavefront passes through them, the amplifiers release some of the light energy stored in them into the beam. To improve the energy transfer the beams are sent though the main amplifier section four times, using an [[Pockels effect|optical switch]] located in a mirrored cavity. In total these amplifiers boost the original 6&nbsp;J provided by the PAMs to a nominal 4&nbsp;MJ.<ref name=how/> Given the time scale of a few billionths of a second, the peak UV power delivered to the target is correspondingly very high, 500&nbsp;TW.\n\nNear the center of each beamline, and taking up the majority of the total length, are ''[[spatial filter]]s''. These consist of long tubes with small telescopes at the end that focus the laser beam down to a tiny point in the center of the tube, where a [[photomask|mask]] cuts off any stray light outside the focal point. The filters ensure that the image of the beam when it reaches the target is extremely uniform, removing any light that was misfocused by imperfections in the optics upstream. Spatial filters were a major step forward in ICF work when they were introduced in the [[Cyclops laser]], an earlier LLNL experiment.\n\nThe total length of the path the laser beam propagates from one end to the other, including switches, is about {{convert|1500|m|ft|sp=us}}. The various optical elements in the beamlines are generally packaged into Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), standardized boxes about the size of a vending machine that can be dropped out of the beamline for replacement from below.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1117/12.538467 |bibcode=2004SPIE.5341..127L |chapter=NIF laser line-replaceable units (LRUs) |title=Optical Engineering at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory II: The National Ignition Facility |volume=5341 |page=127 |year=2004 |last1=Larson |first1=Doug W. |chapter-url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1410354/ |editor1-last=Lane |editor1-first=Monya A |editor2-last=Wuest |editor2-first=Craig R }}</ref>\n\nAfter the amplification is complete the light is switched back into the beamline, where it runs to the far end of the building to the ''target chamber''.

Wegner et al.,''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5341..180W NIF final optics system: frequency conversion and beam conditioning]'', Proceedings of SPIE 5341, May 2004, pages 180\u2013189.</ref> These are made of thin sheets (about 1&nbsp;cm thick) cut from a single crystal of [[potassium dihydrogen phosphate]]. When the 1053&nbsp;nm (IR) light passes through the first of two of these sheets, frequency addition converts a large fraction of the light into 527&nbsp;nm light (green). On passing through the second sheet, frequency combination converts much of the 527&nbsp;nm light and the remaining 1053&nbsp;nm light into 351&nbsp;nm (UV) light. [[Infrared]] (IR) light is much less effective than UV at heating the targets, because IR couples more strongly with hot [[electrons]] which will absorb a considerable amount of energy and interfere with compression. The conversion process can reach peak efficiencies of about 80 percent for a laser pulse that has a flat [[time|temporal]] shape, but the temporal shape needed for ignition varies significantly over the duration of the pulse. The actual conversion process is about 50 percent efficient, reducing delivered energy to a nominal 1.8&nbsp;MJ.<ref>Bibeau, Camille; Paul J.

In existing (non-weapon) fusion experiments the heat produced by the fusion reactions rapidly escapes from the plasma, meaning that external heating must be applied continually in order to keep the reactions going. Ignition refers to the point at which the energy given off in the fusion reactions currently underway is high enough to sustain the temperature of the fuel against those losses. This causes a chain-reaction that allows the majority of the fuel to undergo a nuclear ''burn''. Ignition is considered a key requirement if [[fusion power]] is to ever become practical.<ref name=econ/>\n\nNIF is designed primarily to use the ''indirect drive'' method of operation, in which the laser heats a small metal cylinder instead of the capsule inside it. The heat causes the cylinder, known as a [[hohlraum]] (German for \"hollow room\", or cavity), to re-emit the energy as intense [[X-ray]]s, which are more evenly distributed and symmetrical than the original laser beams.

During these meetings, the idea later known as [[PACER (fusion)|PACER]] first developed. PACER envisioned the explosion of small [[hydrogen bomb]]s in large caverns to generate steam that would be converted into electrical power. After identifying several problems with this approach, Nuckolls became interested in understanding how small a bomb could be made that would still generate net positive power.<ref name=EarlyNuckolls/>\n\nThere are two parts to a typical hydrogen bomb, a plutonium-based fission bomb known as the ''primary'', and a cylindrical arrangement of fusion fuels known as the ''secondary''. The primary releases significant amounts of x-rays, which are trapped within the bomb casing and heat and compress the secondary until it undergoes ignition. The secondary consists of [[lithium deuteride]] fuel, which requires an external neutron source to begin the reaction. This is normally in the form of a small plutonium \"spark plug\" in the center of the fuel. Nuckolls's idea was to explore how small the secondary could be made, and what effects this would have on the energy needed from the primary to cause ignition. The simplest change is to replace the LiD fuel with D-T gas, removing the need for the spark plug. At that point there is no theoretical smallest size - as the secondary got smaller, so did the amount of energy needed to reach ignition. At the milligram level, the energy levels started to approach those available through several known devices.<ref name=EarlyNuckolls>John Nuckolls, [http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/658936-fpqpjO/webviewable/658936.pdf \"Early Steps Toward Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE)\"], LLNL, 12 June 1998</ref>\n\nBy the early 1960s, Nuckolls and several other weapons designers had developed the outlines of the ICF approach. The D-T fuel would be placed in a small capsule, designed to rapidly ablate when heated and thereby maximize compression and shock wave formation. This capsule would be placed within an engineered shell, the hohlraum, which acted similar to the bomb casing. However, the hohlraum did not have to be heated by x-rays; any source of energy could be used as long as it delivered enough energy to cause the hohlraum itself to heat up and start giving off x-rays. Ideally the energy source would be located some distance away, to mechanically isolate both ends of the reaction. A small atomic bomb could be used as the energy source, as it is in a hydrogen bomb, but ideally smaller energy sources would be used. Using computer simulations, the teams estimated that about 5&nbsp;MJ of energy would be needed from the primary, generating a 1&nbsp;MJ beam.<ref name=\"EarlyNuckolls\"/> To put this in perspective, a small fission primary of 0.5&nbsp;kt releases 2 million MJ in total.<ref>[http://www.unitjuggler.com/convert-energy-from-kT-to-MJ.html \"Convert kilotons, to megajoules\"], Unit Juggler</ref><ref>Nuckolls et al., ''[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v239/n5368/pdf/239139a0.pdf Laser Compression of Matter to Super-High Densities: Thermonuclear (CTR) Applications]'', ''Nature'' Vol. 239, 1972, p. 129</ref><ref>John Lindl, ''[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10126383-6NAuBK/native/10126383.pdf The Edward Teller Medal Lecture: The Evolution Toward Indirect Drive and Two Decades of Progress Toward ICF Ignition and Burn]'', 11th International Workshop on Laser Interaction and Related Plasma Phenomena, December 1994. Retrieved on May 7, 2008.</ref>\n\n===ICF program begins===\nWhile Nuckolls and LLNL were working on hohlraum-based concepts, former weapon designer [[Ray Kidder]] was working on the direct drive concept, using a large number of laser beams to evenly heat the target capsule. In the early 1970s, Kidder formed [[KMS Fusion]] to directly commercialize this concept. This sparked off intense rivalry between Kidder and the weapons labs. Formerly ignored, ICF was now a hot topic and most of the labs soon started ICF efforts of their own.<ref name=EarlyNuckolls/> LLNL decided early on to concentrate on glass lasers, while other facilities studied gas lasers using carbon dioxide (e.g. ANTARES, [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]) or KrF (e.g. [[Nike laser]], [[Naval Research Laboratory]]).\n\nThroughout these early stages of development, much of the understanding of the fusion process was the result of computer simulations, primarily [[LASNEX]]. LASNEX greatly simplified the reaction to a 2-dimensional simulation, which was all that was possible given the amount of computing power at the time. According to LASNEX, laser drivers in the kJ range would have the required properties to reach low gain, which was just within the state of the art. This led to the [[Shiva laser]] project which was completed in 1977. Contrary to predictions, Shiva fell far short of its goals, and the densities reached were thousands of times smaller than predicted. This was traced to issues with the way the laser delivered heat to the target, which delivered most of its energy to [[electron]]s rather than the entire fuel mass. Further experiments and simulations demonstrated that this process could be dramatically improved by using shorter wavelengths of laser light.\n\nFurther upgrades to the simulation programs, accounting for these effects, predicted a new design that would reach ignition. This new system emerged as the 20-beam 200&nbsp;kJ [[Nova laser]] concept. During the initial construction phase, Nuckolls found an error in his calculations, and an October 1979 review chaired by John Foster Jr. of [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] confirmed that there was no way Nova would reach ignition. The Nova design was then modified into a smaller 10-beam design that added frequency conversion to 351&nbsp;nm light, which would increase coupling efficiency.<ref name=peer>{{cite techreport |first1=Matthew |last1=McKinzie |first2=Christopher |last2=Paine |url=http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/nif2/findings.asp |title=When Peer Review Fails |publisher=NDRC}}</ref> In operation, Nova was able to deliver about 30&nbsp;kJ of UV laser energy, about half of what was initially expected, primarily due to limits set by optical damage to the final focusing optics. Even at those levels, it was clear that the predictions for fusion production were still wrong; even at the limited powers available, fusion yields were far below predictions.\n\n===Halite and Centurion===\nWith each experiment, the predicted energy needed to reach ignition rose, and it was not clear that post-Nova predictions were any more accurate than earlier ones. The [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) decided that direct experimentation was the best way to settle the issue, and in 1978 they started a series of underground experiments at the [[Nevada Test Site]] that used small nuclear bombs to illuminate ICF targets. The tests were known as Halite or Centurion depending on which lab ran it, LLNL or LANL.\n\nEach test was able to simultaneously illuminate many targets, allowing them to test the amount of x-ray energy needed by placing the targets at different distances from the bomb. Another question was how large the fuel assembly had to be in order for the fuel to self-heat from the fusion reactions and thus reach ignition. Initial data were available by mid-1984, and the testing ceased in 1988. Ignition was achieved for the first time during these tests, but the amount of energy and the size of the fuel targets needed to reach ignition was far higher than predicted.<ref name=secretadvance>{{cite newspaper |title=Secret Advance in Nuclear Fusion Spurs a Dispute Among Scientists |first=William |last=Broad |date=21 March 1988 |newspaper=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/21/us/secret-advance-in-nuclear-fusion-spurs-a-dispute-among-scientists.html}}</ref> During this same period, experiments began on Nova using similar targets to understand their behaviour under laser illumination, allowing direct comparison against the results obtained from the bomb tests.<ref>John Lindl, \"A strategy for determining the driver requirements for high gain ICF implosions utilizing hydrodynamically equivalent capsules on Nova laser\", Laser Annual Program Report, 1981, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, Livermore, CA, UCRL-50055-80/81, pp.2-29-2-57 (unpublished)</ref>\n\nData from the tests suggested that about 10&nbsp;MJ of x-ray energy would be needed to reach ignition.<ref name=secretadvance/><ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Math+society+says+no+to+SDI+funding.-a06540237 \"Laser advance amid pros and con(fusion)s of DOE fusion path\"], Free Online Library, 1988</ref><ref>John Lindl, Rober McCrory and Michael Campbell, [http://www.physics.utoronto.ca/~phy189h1/Ignition%20and%20Inertial%20Confinement%20Fusion.pdf \"Progress Toward Ignition and Burn Propagation in Inertial Confinement Fusion\"], ''Physics Today'', September 1992, pp. 32-40.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://classic.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/10455/|title=Infighting Among Rival Theorists Imperils 'Hot' Fusion Lab Plan|author=|date=|website=The Scientist}}</ref><ref>Phillip Schewe and Ben Stein, [http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/News/Lindl.txt \"Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) Article Announcement\"], ''Physics News'', 25 October 1995</ref> If this energy is supplied by an IR laser to a hohlraum, as in Nova or NIF, this corresponds to an original laser energy on the order of 100&nbsp;MJ, well beyond the reach of existing technologies.<ref name=secretadvance/>\n\nA great debate broke out in the ICF establishment as a result.<ref name=secretadvance/> One group suggested that they attempt to build a laser of this power; [[Leonardo Mascheroni]] and Claude Phipps designed a new type of [[hydrogen fluoride laser]] that was pumped by high-energy [[electron]]s that would be able to reach the 100&nbsp;MJ limit.

LMF would use a driver on the order of 10&nbsp;MJ, delivering fusion yields of between 100 and 1,000&nbsp;MJ. A 1989/90 review of this concept by the [[National Academy of Sciences]] suggested that the LMF was too large a step to make at once, and that fundamental physics issues still needed to be explored. They recommended further experiments before attempting to move to a 10&nbsp;MJ system. Nevertheless, the authors were aware of the potential for higher energy requirements, and noted \"Indeed, if it did turn out that a 100 MJ driver were required for ignition and gain, one would have to rethink the entire approach to, and rationale for, ICF\".<ref>Review of the Department of Energy's Inertial Confinement Fusion Program, Final Report, National Academy of Sciences</ref>\n\n===LMF and Nova Upgrade===\nBuilding the LMF was estimated to cost about $1&nbsp;billion.<ref name=upgrade>''Nova Upgrade - A Proposed ICF Facility to Demonstrate Ignition and Gain'', Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ICF Program, July 1992</ref> LLNL initially submitted a design with a 5&nbsp;MJ 350&nbsp;nm (UV) driver laser that would be able to reach about 200&nbsp;MJ yield, which was enough to attain the majority of the LMF goals.

The resulting system would be much lower power than the LMF concept, with a driver of about 1&nbsp;MJ.<ref>Tobin, M.T et all, ''[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel2/578/5735/00218762.pdf?tp=&isnumber=&arnumber=218762 Target area for Nova Upgrade: containing ignition and beyond]'', Fusion Engineering, 1991, pg. 650\u2013655.

The plans called for the installation of two main banks of laser beamlines, one in the existing Nova beamline room, and the other in the older Shiva building next door, extending through its laser bay and target area into an upgraded Nova target area. The lasers would deliver about 500&nbsp;TW in a 4&nbsp;ns pulse. The upgrades were expected to allow the new Nova to produce fusion yields of between 2 and 10&nbsp;MJ.<ref name=upgrade/> The initial estimates from 1992 estimated construction costs around $400&nbsp;million, with construction taking place from 1995 to 1999.\n\n===NIF emerges===\nThroughout this period, the ending of the [[Cold War]] led to dramatic changes in defense funding and priorities. As the need for nuclear weapons was greatly reduced and various arms limitation agreements led to a reduction in warhead count, the US was faced with the prospect of losing a generation of nuclear weapon designers able to maintain the existing stockpiles, or design new weapons.<ref>William Broad, ''[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE4D9133DF932A15755C0A962958260 Vast Laser Plan Would Further Fusion and Keep Bomb Experts]'', New York Times, June 21, 1994.

This would make the reliable development of newer generations of nuclear weapons much more difficult.\n\n[[File:Preamplifier at the National Ignition Facility.jpg|left|400px|thumb|The preamplifiers of the National Ignition Facility are the first step in increasing the energy of laser beams as they make their way toward the target chamber.

In a series of meetings that started in 1995, an agreement formed between the labs to divide up the SSMP efforts. An important part of this would be confirmation of computer models using low-yield ICF experiments. The Nova Upgrade was too small to use for these experiments,<ref>Letter from Charles Curtis, Undersecretary of Energy, June 15, 1995</ref>{{efn|It is not clearly stated why Nova Upgrade would be too small for SSMP, no reason is given in the available resources.}} and a redesign emerged as NIF in 1994. The estimated cost of the project remained just over $1&nbsp;billion,<ref>1.9 Cost (NIF CDR, Chapter 9)</ref> with completion in 2002.\n\nIn spite of the agreement, the large project cost combined with the ending of similar projects at other labs resulted in several highly critical comments by scientists at other weapons labs, [[Sandia National Laboratories]] in particular. In May 1997, Sandia fusion scientist Rick Spielman publicly stated that NIF had \"virtually no internal peer review on the technical issues\" and that \"Livermore essentially picked the panel to review themselves\".<ref>\"Livermore's costly fusion laser won't fly, scientists say\", Albuquerque Tribune, May 29, 1997, p. 1</ref> A retired Sandia manager, Bob Puerifoy, was even more blunt than Spielman: \"NIF is worthless ... it can't be used to maintain the stockpile, period\".<ref>L. Spohn, \"NIF opponents to cite criticism of laser in court battle\", Albuquerque Tribune, June 13, 1997, p. A15.</ref>\n\nA contrasting view was expressed by Victor Reis, assistant secretary for Defense Programs within DOE and the chief architect of the Stockpile Stewardship Program. Reis told the U.S. House Armed Services Committee in 1997 that NIF was \"designed to produce, for the first time in a laboratory setting, conditions of temperature and density of matter close to those that occur in the detonation of nuclear weapons. The ability to study the behavior of matter and the transfer of energy and radiation under these conditions is key to understanding the basic physics of nuclear weapons and predicting their performance without underground nuclear testing.<ref>Statement of Dr. Victor Reis, Assistant Secretary for Defense Programs, Department of Energy, before the Senate Armed Services Committee, March 19, 1997 (retrieved July 13, 2012 from http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/pa/Director/reisSASC97.html )</ref> Two JASON panels, which are composed of scientific and technical national security experts, have stated that the NIF is the most scientifically valuable of all programs proposed for science-based stockpile stewardship.<ref>Statement of Federico Pe\u00f1a, Secretary, US Dept of Energy, before the Committee on Armed Services, United States Senate, March 26, 1998 (retrieved July 13, 2012 from {{cite web |url=http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/statemnt/980326fp.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205200200/http://armed-services.senate.gov/statemnt/980326fp.htm |archivedate=2011-02-05 }} )</ref>\n\nDespite the initial criticism, Sandia, as well as Los Alamos, provided support in the development of many NIF technologies,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/purl.cover.jsp?purl=/274120-bKjglv/webviewable/274120.pdf |title=Information Bridge: DOE Scientific and Technical Information - Sponsored by OSTI |publisher=Osti.gov |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2012-10-08|last1=Boyes |first1=J. |last2=Boyer |first2=W. |last3=Chael |first3=J. |last4=Cook |first4=D. |last5=Cook |first5=W. |last6=Downey |first6=T. |last7=Hands |first7=J. |last8=Harjes |first8=C. |last9=Leeper |first9=R. |last10=McKay |first10=P. |last11=Micano |first11=P. |last12=Olson |first12=R. |last13=Porter |first13=J. |last14=Quintenz |first14=J. |last15=Roberts |first15=V. |last16=Savage |first16=M. |last17=Simpson |first17=W. |last18=Seth |first18=A. |last19=Smith |first19=R. |last20=Wavrik |first20=M. |last21=Wilson |first21=M. }}</ref> and both laboratories later became partners with NIF in the National Ignition Campaign.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nic/participants.php |title=National Ignition Campaign: Participants, NIF & Photon Science |publisher=Lasers.llnl.gov |accessdate=2012-10-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017203631/https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nic/participants.php |archivedate=2012-10-17 }}</ref>\n\n===Constructing NIF===\n[[File:Beamlet Laser.jpg|thumb|The Beamlet laser tested the design and techniques that would be used on NIF.]]\n[[File:NIF target chamber construction.jpg|thumb|The NIF target chamber was so large it had to be built in sections.]]\nWork on the NIF started with a single beamline demonstrator, Beamlet.

By the time the \"conventional facility\" (the shell for the laser) was complete in 2001, more than 210,000 cubic yards of soil had been excavated, more than 73,000 cubic yards of concrete had been poured, 7,600 tons of reinforcing steel rebar had been placed, and more than 5,000 tons of structural steel had been erected. In addition to its sheer size, building NIF presented a number of unique challenges. To isolate the laser system from vibration, the foundation of each laser bay was made independent of the rest of the structure. Three-foot-thick, 420-foot-long and 80-foot-wide slabs, each containing 3,800 cubic yards of concrete, required continuous concrete pours to achieve their specifications.\n\nThere were also unexpected challenges to cope with: In November, 1997, an El Ni\u00f1o weather front dumped two inches of rain in two hours, flooding the NIF site with 200,000 gallons of water just three days before the scheduled concrete foundation pour. The earth was so soaked that the framing for the retaining wall sank six inches, forcing the crew to disassemble and reassemble it in order to pour the concrete.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://newsline.llnl.gov/employee/articles/2001/10-26-01newsline.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726024319/https://newsline.llnl.gov/employee/articles/2001/10-26-01newsline.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-26 }}</ref> Construction was halted in December, 1997, when 16,000-year-old mammoth bones were discovered on the construction site.

To everyone's surprise, the Pulsed Power Conditioning Modules (PCMs) suffered capacitor failures that led to explosions. This required a redesign of the module to contain the debris, but since the concrete structure of the buildings holding them had already been poured, this left the new modules so tightly packed that there was no way to do maintenance in-place. Yet another redesign followed, this time allowing the modules to be removed from the bays for servicing.<ref name=peer/> Continuing problems of this sort further delayed the operational start of the project, and in September 1999, an updated DOE report stated that NIF would require up to $350&nbsp;million more and completion would be pushed back to 2006.<ref name=GAO1/>\n\n===Re-baseline and GAO report===\n[[File:Bill Richardson, official DOE photo.png|thumb|Bill Richardson began a review process that brought NIF construction back under control.]]\n\nThroughout this period the problems with NIF were not being reported up the management chain.

As these experiments wound down, a series of planned upgrades were carried out, notably a series of improved diagnostic and measurement instruments. Among these changes were the addition of the ARC (Advanced Radiographic Capability) system, which uses 4 of the NIF's 192 beams as a backlighting source for high-speed imaging of the implosion sequence.\n\nARC is essentially a petawatt-class laser with peak power exceeding a quadrillion (10<sup>15</sup>) watts. It is designed to produce brighter, more penetrating, higher-energy x rays than can be obtained with conventional radiographic techniques. When complete, ARC will be the world's highest-energy short-pulse laser, capable of creating picosecond-duration laser pulses to produce energetic x rays in the range of 50-100 keV for backlighting NIF experiments.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://lasers.llnl.gov/news/photons-fusion/2014/may|title= Photons & Fusion Newsletter - May 2014|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= May 2014|website= National Ignition Facility & Photon Science News - Archive - Photons & Fusion Newsletter|publisher= Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|access-date=2015-04-16}}</ref>\n\nNIC runs restarted in May 2011 with the goal of timing the four laser shock waves that compress the fusion target to very high precision.

Koonin]], Under Secretary of Science. The 6th review, May 31, 2012 was chaired by David H. Crandall, Advisor on National Security and Inertial Fusion, Koonin being precluded to chair the review because of a conflict of interest. The review was conducted with the same external reviewers, who had previously served Koonin. Each provided their report independently, with their own estimate of the probability of achieving ignition within the plan, i.e. before December 31, 2012. The conclusion of the review was published on July 19, 2012.<ref name=\"Crandall\">\n{{cite web\n| url=http://fire.pppl.gov/NIF_NIC_report_rev5_koonin_2012.pdf\n| title=External Review of the National Ignition Campaign\n| publisher=[[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]]\n}}</ref>\n\nThe previous review dated January 31, 2012, identified a number of experimental improvements that have been completed or are under way.<ref name=\"Crandall\"/> The new report unanimously praised the quality of the installation: lasers, optics, targets, diagnostics, operations have all been outstanding, however:\n:The integrated conclusion based on this extensive period of experimentation, however, is that considerable hurdles must be overcome to reach ignition or the goal of observing unequivocal alpha heating. Indeed the reviewers note that given the unknowns with the present 'semi-empirical' approach, the probability of ignition before the end of December is extremely low and even the goal of demonstrating unambiguous alpha heating is challenging. (Crandall&nbsp;Memo&nbsp;2012,&nbsp;p.&nbsp;2)\n\nFurther, the report members express deep concerns on the gaps between observed performance and ICF simulation codes such that the current codes are of a limited utility going forward. Specifically, they found a lack of predictive ability of the radiation drive to the capsule and inadequately modeled laser-plasma interactions. These effects lead to pressure being one half to one third of that required for ignition, far below the predicted values. The memo page 5 discusses the mix of ablator material and capsule fuel due likely to hydrodynamics instabilities in the outer surface of the ablator.<ref name=\"Crandall\"/>\n\nThe report goes on to suggest that using a thicker ablator may improve performance, but this increases its inertia. To keep the required implosion speed, they request that the NIF energy be increased to 2MJ. One must also keep in mind that [[Nd:YAG laser|neodymium lasers]] can withstand only a limited amount of energy or risk permanent damage to the optical quality of the lasing medium. The reviewers question whether or not the energy of NIF is sufficient to indirectly compress a large enough capsule to avoid the mix limit and reach ignition.{{sfn|Crandall|2012|p=5}} The report concluded that ignition within the calendar year 2012 is 'highly unlikely'.<ref name=\"Crandall\"/>\n\n===Ignition fails, focus shifts, LIFE ends===\nThe NIC officially ended on September 30, 2012 without achieving ignition.

It also includes the study of the nature of the Universe on a large scale. In its earliest form, it was what is now known as \"[[celestial mechanics]]\", the study of the [[celestial sphere|heavens]]. Greek philosophers [[Aristarchus of Samos]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Ptolemy]] proposed different cosmological theories. The [[geocentric]] [[Ptolemaic system]] was the prevailing theory until the 16th century when [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], and subsequently [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo Galilei]], proposed a [[heliocentric]] system. This is one of the most famous examples of [[epistemological rupture]] in physical cosmology.\n\n[[File:PIA17993-DetectorsForInfantUniverseStudies-20140317.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Evidence of [[gravitational waves]] in the [[Big Bang|infant universe]] may have been uncovered by the microscopic examination of the [[focal plane]] of the [[BICEP2]] [[radio telescope]].<ref name=\"BICEP2-2014\" /><ref name=\"NASA-20140317\" /><ref name=\"NYT-20140317\" />]] \n[[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', published in 1687, was the first description of the [[law of universal gravitation]]. It provided a physical mechanism for [[Kepler's laws]] and also allowed the anomalies in previous systems, caused by gravitational interaction between the planets, to be resolved. A fundamental difference between Newton's cosmology and those preceding it was the [[Copernican principle]]\u2014that the bodies on earth obey the same [[physical law]]s as all the celestial bodies. This was a crucial philosophical advance in physical cosmology.\n\nModern scientific cosmology is usually considered to have begun in 1917 with [[Albert Einstein]]'s publication of his final modification of [[general relativity]] in the paper \"Cosmological Considerations of the General Theory of Relativity\" (although this paper was not widely available outside of Germany until the end of [[World War&nbsp;I]]). General relativity prompted [[cosmogony|cosmogonists]] such as [[Willem de Sitter]], [[Karl Schwarzschild]], and [[Arthur Eddington]] to explore its astronomical ramifications, which enhanced the ability of [[astronomy|astronomers]] to study very distant objects. Physicists began changing the assumption that the Universe was static and unchanging. In 1922 [[Alexander Friedmann]] introduced the idea of an expanding universe that contained moving matter. Around the same time (1917 to 1922) the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] took place, with early cosmologists such as [[Heber Curtis]] and [[Ernst \u00d6pik]] determining that some [[nebula]]e seen in telescopes were separate galaxies far distant from our own.\n\n{{Physical cosmology}}\nIn parallel to this dynamic approach to cosmology, one long-standing debate about the structure of the cosmos was coming to a climax. Mount Wilson astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]] championed the model of a cosmos made up of the [[Milky Way]] [[star system]] only; while [[Heber D. Curtis]] argued for the idea that spiral nebulae were star systems in their own right as island universes. This difference of ideas came to a climax with the organization of the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] on 26 April 1920 at the meeting of the U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The debate was resolved when [[Edwin Hubble]] detected [[Cepheid Variables]] in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] in 1923 and 1924. Their distance established spiral nebulae well beyond the edge of the Milky Way<!-- and has galaxies of their own--><!--Somebody's editing mistake - check.-->.\n\nSubsequent modelling of the universe explored the possibility that the [[cosmological constant]], introduced by Einstein in his 1917 paper, may result in an [[expanding universe]], depending on its value. Thus the [[Big Bang]] model was proposed by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] priest [[Georges Lema\u00eetre]] in 1927 which was subsequently corroborated by [[Edwin Hubble]]'s discovery of the [[redshift]] in 1929 and later by the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] by [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]] in 1964. These findings were a first step to rule out some of many [[Non-standard cosmology|alternative cosmologies]].\n\nSince around 1990, several dramatic advances in observational cosmology have transformed cosmology from a largely speculative science into a predictive science with precise agreement between theory and observation. These advances include observations of the microwave background from the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]], [[WMAP]] and [[Planck spacecraft|Planck]] satellites,  large new galaxy [[redshift survey]]s including [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dfGRS]] and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]], and observations of distant [[supernovae]] and [[gravitational lensing]]. These observations matched the predictions of the [[cosmic inflation]] theory, a modified [[Big Bang]] theory, and the specific version known as the [[Lambda-CDM]] model.  This has led many to refer to modern times as the \"golden age of cosmology\".<ref>[[Alan Guth]] is reported to have made this very claim in an [[Edge Foundation, Inc.|Edge Foundation]] interview [http://www.edge.org/documents/day/day_guth.html EDGE]</ref>\n\nOn 17 March 2014, astronomers at the [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] announced the detection of [[gravitational waves]], providing strong evidence for [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]] and the [[Big Bang]].<ref name=\"BICEP2-2014\">{{cite web |authors=  |title=BICEP2 2014 Results Release |url= http://bicepkeck.org |date=17 March 2014 | website=[[National Science Foundation]] |accessdate=18 March 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"NASA-20140317\">{{cite news |author =Whitney Clavin |title = NASA Technology Views Birth of the Universe |url= http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-082 |date=17 March 2014 |work= [[NASA]] |accessdate=17 March 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-20140317\">{{cite news | author1 = Dennis Overbye  |title= Detection of Waves in Space Buttresses Landmark Theory of Big Bang |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html |date= 17 March 2014 |work =[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=17 March 2014 |author1-link= Dennis Overbye }}</ref> However, on 19 June 2014, lowered confidence in confirming the [[cosmic inflation]] findings was reported.<ref name=\"NYT-20140619\">{{cite news | author =Dennis Overbye |title= Astronomers Hedge on Big Bang Detection Claim |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/science/space/scientists-debate-gravity-wave-detection-claim.html |date= 19 June 2014 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=20 June 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"BBC-20140619\">{{cite news |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |title= Cosmic inflation: Confidence lowered for Big Bang signal |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-27935479 |date=19 June 2014 |work= [[BBC News]] |accessdate=20 June 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"PRL-20140619\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.241101|pmid=24996078 |arxiv=1403.3985 |bibcode = 2014PhRvL.112x1101B | title = Detection of ''B''-Mode Polarization at Degree Angular Scales by BICEP2| journal = Physical Review Letters| volume = 112| issue = 24|pages=241101 | year = 2014| last1 = Ade | first1 = P.

It also includes the study of the nature of the Universe on a large scale. In its earliest form, it was what is now known as \"[[celestial mechanics]]\", the study of the [[celestial sphere|heavens]]. Greek philosophers [[Aristarchus of Samos]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Ptolemy]] proposed different cosmological theories. The [[geocentric]] [[Ptolemaic system]] was the prevailing theory until the 16th century when [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], and subsequently [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Galileo Galilei]], proposed a [[heliocentric]] system. This is one of the most famous examples of [[epistemological rupture]] in physical cosmology.\n\n[[File:PIA17993-DetectorsForInfantUniverseStudies-20140317.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Evidence of [[gravitational waves]] in the [[Big Bang|infant universe]] may have been uncovered by the microscopic examination of the [[focal plane]] of the [[BICEP2]] [[radio telescope]].<ref name=\"BICEP2-2014\" /><ref name=\"NASA-20140317\" /><ref name=\"NYT-20140317\" />]] \n[[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', published in 1687, was the first description of the [[law of universal gravitation]]. It provided a physical mechanism for [[Kepler's laws]] and also allowed the anomalies in previous systems, caused by gravitational interaction between the planets, to be resolved. A fundamental difference between Newton's cosmology and those preceding it was the [[Copernican principle]]\u2014that the bodies on earth obey the same [[physical law]]s as all the celestial bodies. This was a crucial philosophical advance in physical cosmology.\n\nModern scientific cosmology is usually considered to have begun in 1917 with [[Albert Einstein]]'s publication of his final modification of [[general relativity]] in the paper \"Cosmological Considerations of the General Theory of Relativity\" (although this paper was not widely available outside of Germany until the end of [[World War&nbsp;I]]). General relativity prompted [[cosmogony|cosmogonists]] such as [[Willem de Sitter]], [[Karl Schwarzschild]], and [[Arthur Eddington]] to explore its astronomical ramifications, which enhanced the ability of [[astronomy|astronomers]] to study very distant objects. Physicists began changing the assumption that the Universe was static and unchanging. In 1922 [[Alexander Friedmann]] introduced the idea of an expanding universe that contained moving matter. Around the same time (1917 to 1922) the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] took place, with early cosmologists such as [[Heber Curtis]] and [[Ernst \u00d6pik]] determining that some [[nebula]]e seen in telescopes were separate galaxies far distant from our own.\n\n{{Physical cosmology}}\nIn parallel to this dynamic approach to cosmology, one long-standing debate about the structure of the cosmos was coming to a climax. Mount Wilson astronomer [[Harlow Shapley]] championed the model of a cosmos made up of the [[Milky Way]] [[star system]] only; while [[Heber D. Curtis]] argued for the idea that spiral nebulae were star systems in their own right as island universes. This difference of ideas came to a climax with the organization of the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Great Debate]] on 26 April 1920 at the meeting of the U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The debate was resolved when [[Edwin Hubble]] detected [[Cepheid Variables]] in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] in 1923 and 1924. Their distance established spiral nebulae well beyond the edge of the Milky Way<!-- and has galaxies of their own--><!--Somebody's editing mistake - check.-->.\n\nSubsequent modelling of the universe explored the possibility that the [[cosmological constant]], introduced by Einstein in his 1917 paper, may result in an [[expanding universe]], depending on its value. Thus the [[Big Bang]] model was proposed by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] priest [[Georges Lema\u00eetre]] in 1927 which was subsequently corroborated by [[Edwin Hubble]]'s discovery of the [[redshift]] in 1929 and later by the discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] by [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]] in 1964. These findings were a first step to rule out some of many [[Non-standard cosmology|alternative cosmologies]].\n\nSince around 1990, several dramatic advances in observational cosmology have transformed cosmology from a largely speculative science into a predictive science with precise agreement between theory and observation. These advances include observations of the microwave background from the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]], [[WMAP]] and [[Planck spacecraft|Planck]] satellites,  large new galaxy [[redshift survey]]s including [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dfGRS]] and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]], and observations of distant [[supernovae]] and [[gravitational lensing]]. These observations matched the predictions of the [[cosmic inflation]] theory, a modified [[Big Bang]] theory, and the specific version known as the [[Lambda-CDM]] model.

The film stars [[Maeve Higgins]], [[Barry Ward (actor)|Barry Ward]], [[Will Forte]], [[Claudia O'Doherty]], Jamie Beamish, Terri Chandler, [[Riste\u00e1rd Cooper]] and Emma Coleman. The film was released in Ireland and the United Kingdom on September 13, 2019, by Wildcard Distribution. The film was released in the United States on March 6, 2020, by Cranked Up Films, the genre division of Good Deed Entertainment.\n\n==Plot==\nDriving instructor Rose Dooley lives alone in Ireland. She possesses powerful paranormal \"talents\", including the ability to send wayward spirits into the afterlife, but has not used them since a paranormal accident killed her father, paranormal expert Vincent Dooley, when she was a child. Rose ignores obvious minor hauntings around her, and continually fends off phone calls to her driving service asking for help with paranormal problems. One of these calls is Martin Martin, who calls under the guise of wanting to learn to drive, but actually wants Rose to help him deal with the spirit of his nagging wife Bonnie, who haunts his house. Rose orders him out of her car, but not before Martin tells her he finds she has a warm presence. Meanwhile, one-hit wonder rock musician Christian Winter attempts to sacrifice a virgin woman to regain his popularity, but his wife Claudia interrupts the ritual and inadvertently kills the woman, forcing Christian to find another virgin before the blood moon the following night.\n\nRose falls for Martin and follows him to a store where his daughter Sarah works, where she overhears him talking to Sarah about her. Christian's divining tools lead him to the same store, where he thinks he has been led to Sarah, and he gets ahold of some of her hair. That night, Christian uses the hair in an incantation that renders Sarah motionless and floating in midair, causing Martin to panic and call Rose for help again. Rose decides against her better judgment to help Martin, informing him that waking someone who has been put under a Satanic spell will cause them to explode; she instead puts a holding spell on Sarah, keeping the spell from drawing her to the site of a sacrificial ritual. She realizes Martin has the ability to talk to ghosts, rendering him \"talented\" as well, and explains that they will need the ectoplasm of several different spirits to break the spell on Sarah.\n\nRose and Martin answer one of Rose's phone messages and exorcise a spirit from a garbage can by using Martin as a host for the spirit; when Rose commands the spirit to move on from this world, Martin spits up ectoplasm. Christian and Claudia, infuriated by the holding spell, witness this, and Christian calls Rose for a driving lesson, despite his fear of driving. During the lesson, Christian fails to overcome his fear, but obtains some of Rose's hair. Rose re-watches a tape from her father and remembers how her failure to control her abilities may have killed him; she goes to Martin's house and explains the accident. As a child, Rose assisted her father in helping a dog drowned in a haunted pothole to move on to the afterlife, but forgot part of the incantation, resulting in her father being possessed by both the dog and pothole and being hit by a bus. However, Martin convinces Rose to continue using her abilities to help Sarah, despite her worries that she might kill him by mistake.\n\nRose and Martin collect the ectoplasm of several different ghosts, but wind up one short of the total, forcing them to attempt to exorcise Bonnie from Martin's house. As they do, with the help of Rose's pregnant sister Sailor and her date Brian, Christian performs an incantation that breaks the holding spell on Sarah and weakens Rose's talents, leaving Martin still half-possessed by a furious Bonnie after expelling her ectoplasm. When they try to apply the ectoplasm to Sarah, they realize she is being drawn to the site of the ritual, and follow a magpie that has been following Rose ever since her father's accident. On the way, they find Christian also in Sarah's pursuit, and realize he is behind the ritual; Martin loses a finger trying to stop Christian's car.\n\nAt Christian's castle, Christian kills his wife after she interrupts his incantations, then prepares to sacrifice Sarah. Rose, Martin, Sailor, and Brian arrive too late to stop Christian from opening up a huge pit in his floor that sucks Sarah into it; Christian also fatally wounds the magpie. However, the pit expels Sarah, fully alive; the demon Astaroth rises from the pit and berates Christian for not bringing him a virgin, as everyone believed Sarah was. Astaroth decides to take Rose, an actual virgin, in Sarah's stead, but as she is dragged towards the pit, she convinces Martin to have sex with her on the floor to keep her from being a virgin any more. As they do, Sailor goes into labor, Brian helps her deliver her baby, and Sarah knocks Christian into the pit, which closes as Rose and Martin climax. Bonnie tells Rose to treat Martin and Sarah well, then leaves Martin's body. Martin then allows himself to be a vessel for the dying magpie, which is revealed to be possessed by Rose and Sailor's father.

The film was released in the United States on March 6, 2020, by Cranked Up Films, the genre division of Good Deed Entertainment.\n\n==Plot==\nDriving instructor Rose Dooley lives alone in Ireland. She possesses powerful paranormal \"talents\", including the ability to send wayward spirits into the afterlife, but has not used them since a paranormal accident killed her father, paranormal expert Vincent Dooley, when she was a child. Rose ignores obvious minor hauntings around her, and continually fends off phone calls to her driving service asking for help with paranormal problems. One of these calls is Martin Martin, who calls under the guise of wanting to learn to drive, but actually wants Rose to help him deal with the spirit of his nagging wife Bonnie, who haunts his house. Rose orders him out of her car, but not before Martin tells her he finds she has a warm presence. Meanwhile, one-hit wonder rock musician Christian Winter attempts to sacrifice a virgin woman to regain his popularity, but his wife Claudia interrupts the ritual and inadvertently kills the woman, forcing Christian to find another virgin before the blood moon the following night.\n\nRose falls for Martin and follows him to a store where his daughter Sarah works, where she overhears him talking to Sarah about her. Christian's divining tools lead him to the same store, where he thinks he has been led to Sarah, and he gets ahold of some of her hair. That night, Christian uses the hair in an incantation that renders Sarah motionless and floating in midair, causing Martin to panic and call Rose for help again. Rose decides against her better judgment to help Martin, informing him that waking someone who has been put under a Satanic spell will cause them to explode; she instead puts a holding spell on Sarah, keeping the spell from drawing her to the site of a sacrificial ritual. She realizes Martin has the ability to talk to ghosts, rendering him \"talented\" as well, and explains that they will need the ectoplasm of several different spirits to break the spell on Sarah.\n\nRose and Martin answer one of Rose's phone messages and exorcise a spirit from a garbage can by using Martin as a host for the spirit; when Rose commands the spirit to move on from this world, Martin spits up ectoplasm. Christian and Claudia, infuriated by the holding spell, witness this, and Christian calls Rose for a driving lesson, despite his fear of driving. During the lesson, Christian fails to overcome his fear, but obtains some of Rose's hair. Rose re-watches a tape from her father and remembers how her failure to control her abilities may have killed him; she goes to Martin's house and explains the accident. As a child, Rose assisted her father in helping a dog drowned in a haunted pothole to move on to the afterlife, but forgot part of the incantation, resulting in her father being possessed by both the dog and pothole and being hit by a bus. However, Martin convinces Rose to continue using her abilities to help Sarah, despite her worries that she might kill him by mistake.\n\nRose and Martin collect the ectoplasm of several different ghosts, but wind up one short of the total, forcing them to attempt to exorcise Bonnie from Martin's house. As they do, with the help of Rose's pregnant sister Sailor and her date Brian, Christian performs an incantation that breaks the holding spell on Sarah and weakens Rose's talents, leaving Martin still half-possessed by a furious Bonnie after expelling her ectoplasm. When they try to apply the ectoplasm to Sarah, they realize she is being drawn to the site of the ritual, and follow a magpie that has been following Rose ever since her father's accident. On the way, they find Christian also in Sarah's pursuit, and realize he is behind the ritual; Martin loses a finger trying to stop Christian's car.\n\nAt Christian's castle, Christian kills his wife after she interrupts his incantations, then prepares to sacrifice Sarah. Rose, Martin, Sailor, and Brian arrive too late to stop Christian from opening up a huge pit in his floor that sucks Sarah into it; Christian also fatally wounds the magpie. However, the pit expels Sarah, fully alive; the demon Astaroth rises from the pit and berates Christian for not bringing him a virgin, as everyone believed Sarah was. Astaroth decides to take Rose, an actual virgin, in Sarah's stead, but as she is dragged towards the pit, she convinces Martin to have sex with her on the floor to keep her from being a virgin any more. As they do, Sailor goes into labor, Brian helps her deliver her baby, and Sarah knocks Christian into the pit, which closes as Rose and Martin climax. Bonnie tells Rose to treat Martin and Sarah well, then leaves Martin's body. Martin then allows himself to be a vessel for the dying magpie, which is revealed to be possessed by Rose and Sailor's father. He forgives Rose for the accident and welcomes Sailor's child, who she names Vincent, before leaving Martin's body as well.\n\nThree months later, Rose and Martin have started a paranormal investigations and services business. Martin proposes to Rose, who, shocked, responds with a cheerful \"No!\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Maeve Higgins]] as Rose Dooley\n* [[Barry Ward (actor)|Barry Ward]] as Martin Martin\n* [[Will Forte]] as Christian Winter\n* [[Claudia O'Doherty]] as Claudia Winter\n* Jamie Beamish as Brian Welsh\n* Terri Chandler as Sailor Dooley\n* [[Riste\u00e1rd Cooper]] as Vincent Dooley\n* Emma Coleman as Sarah Martin\n* [[Carrie Crowley]] as Marion Mularkey\n* [[Mary McEvoy]] as Janet\n* Agath Ellis as Young Rose\n* [[Valerie O'Connor]] as Angela\n* Siobhan McSweeney as Boring Noreen\n* [[Eamon Morrissey (actor)|Eamon Morrissey]] as Mr. Daly\n* [[Alison Spittle]] as Alison\n* Jed Murray as Astaroth the Demon\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at [[South by Southwest]] on March 10, 2019.<ref>{{cite web |date= 2019-03-05 |author= Clark Collis |url= https://ew.com/movies/2019/03/05/will-forte-extra-ordinary-trailer-sxsw/ |title=Will Forte summons supernatural forces in trailer for SXSW comedy Extra Ordinary |website= [[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate= 2019-09-13 }}</ref> The film was released in Ireland and the United Kingdom on September 13, 2019, by Wildcard Distribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedigitalfix.com/en-us/film/content/111243/extra-ordinary-trailer-will-forte-stars-in-this-silly-irish-horror-comedy/ |title=Extra Ordinary trailer: Will Forte stars in this silly Irish horror comedy |publisher= TheDigitalFix.com |date=2019-07-15 |accessdate=2019-08-21}}</ref> The film is set for release in the United States on March 6, 2020, by Cranked Up Films.\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 97% based on 74 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10.<ref name=\"tomatoes\">{{cite web |title= Extra Ordinary (2019) |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/extra_ordinary |website= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] the film has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web |title= Extra Ordinary |url= https://www.metacritic.com/movie/extra-ordinary/ |website= [[Metacritic]] }}</ref>\n\nDennis Harvey of [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] wrote: \"\u201cExtra Ordinary\u201d is a kind of tea-cosy ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' that\u2019s consistently funny in a pleasingly off-kilter way.\"<ref>{{cite web |date= 16 March 2019 |author= Dennis Harvey |title= Film Review: \u2018Extra Ordinary\u2019 |url= https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/extra-ordinary-review-1203164876/ |website= Variety }}</ref>\n\n<!-- Irish response -->\nDonald Clarke of ''[[The Irish Times]]'' gave the film 3 out of 5 and praised Higgins for her performance but suggests that the film may be overstuffed.<ref name=\"irishtimes\">{{cite web |date= 2019-09-13 |author= Donald Clarke |title= Extra Ordinary: The film's most valuable asset is Maeve Higgins |url= https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/extra-ordinary-the-film-s-most-valuable-asset-is-maeve-higgins-1.4013856 |website= [[The Irish Times]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190913044612/https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/extra-ordinary-the-film-s-most-valuable-asset-is-maeve-higgins-1.4013856 |archive-date= 2019-09-13 |url-status= live }}</ref>\nChris Wasser of ''[[The Irish Independent]]'' gave the film 3 out of 5 and said it was \"just as bonkers on screen as it is on paper\" but it \"eventually stretches itself beyond breaking point, bearing all the hallmarks of a surreal comedy sketch that got out of hand.\"<ref name=\"indo\">{{cite web |date= 2019-09-13 |author= Chris Wasser |title= Extra Ordinary review: Maeve Higgins is the beating heart of this quirky and amiable caper |url= https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/movies/movie-reviews/extra-ordinary-review-maeve-higgins-is-the-beating-heart-of-this-quirky-and-amiable-caper-38494002.html |website= Independent.ie |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190913111026/https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/movies/movie-reviews/extra-ordinary-review-maeve-higgins-is-the-beating-heart-of-this-quirky-and-amiable-caper-38494002.html |archive-date= 2019-09-13 |url-status= live }}</ref> Gareth O'Connor of [[Movies.ie]] gave the film a score of 3.5 out of 5.<ref>{{Cite web |date= September 12, 2019 |last= O'Connor |first= Gareth |title= Extra Ordinary -
