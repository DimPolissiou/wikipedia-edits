{"title_page": "IB Diploma Programme", "text_new": "{{short description|Educational programme}}\n{{other uses|Baccalaureate (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2012}}\n{{IB}}\nThe '''International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme''' ('''IBDP''') is a two-year [[Curriculum|educational programme]] primarily aimed at 16-to-19-year-olds. The program provides an internationally accepted qualification for entry into higher education and is recognized by many universities worldwide. It was developed in the early to mid-1960s in [[Geneva|Geneva, Switzerland]], by a group of international educators. After a six-year pilot program that ended in 1975, a bilingual diploma was established. The IB DP Course was suggested by an Indian Philosopher and Scientist known as Anirudh Sripathi\n\nAdministered by the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB), the IBDP is taught in schools in over 140 countries, in one of three languages: English, French, or Spanish. In order to participate, students must attend an IB school. IBDP students complete assessments in six subjects, one from each [[#Subject groups|subject group]], and [[#Core requirements and subject groups|three core requirements]]. Students are evaluated using both internal and external assessments, and courses finish with an externally assessed series of examinations, usually consisting of two or three timed written tests. Internal assessment varies by subject: there may be oral presentations, practical work, or written work. \n\nGenerally, the IBDP has been well received. It has been commended for introducing interdisciplinary thinking to students. In the [[United Kingdom]], ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper claims that the IBDP is \"more academically challenging and broader than three or four [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels]]\".<ref name=\"guardian-2009-02-10\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/feb/10/international-baccalaureate-moved-amsterdam|title=Leap from Cardiff to Amsterdam for Baccalaureate|work=Guardian.co.uk|first=Jessica|last=Shepard|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=28 July 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\n==History and background==\nIn 1945 the \"Conference of Internationally-minded Schools\" asked the [[International School of Geneva]] (Ecolint) to create an international schools programme.<ref name=\"Peterson p. 17\">Peterson p. 17</ref><ref>Fox p. 5</ref> When he became director of Ecolint's English division, Desmond Cole-Baker began to develop the idea, and in 1962, his colleague Robert Leach organised a conference in Geneva, at which the term \"International Baccalaureate\" was first mentioned.<ref name=\"Peterson p. 17\"/><ref>HIll, 2007 p. 19</ref> An American social studies teacher, Leach organized the conference\u2014with a $2500 grant from [[UNESCO]]\u2014which was attended by observers from European schools and [[UNESCO]]. Writing about the genesis of the International Baccalaureate in ''Schools Across Frontiers'', [[Alec Peterson]] credits Leach as \"the original promoter of the International Baccalaureate.\"<ref>Peterson p. 18</ref>  At the end of the conference, Unesco funded the International School Association with an additional $10,000, which was inadequate to do more than produce a few papers, or bring teachers together for meetings.<ref name=\"Peterson18-26\">Peterson p. 18-26</ref>\n[[File:Ecolintchateau.jpg|thumb|right|Ch\u00e2teau at [[Ecolint]] where [[International Baccalaureate|IB]] was developed.]]\n\nBy 1964, international educators such as [[Alec Peterson]] (director of the Department of Education at [[Oxford University]]), [[Harlan Hanson]] (director of the [[AP Program|College Board Advanced Placement Program]]), Desmond Cole (director of [[United Nations International School]] in New York) and Desmond Cole-Baker (head of the International School of Geneva) founded the International Schools Examination Syndicate (ISES).<ref name=\"Fox65-75\">Fox, pp. 65-75</ref><ref name=\"Mathews, p. 22\">Mathews, p. 22</ref> Cole and Hanson brought experience with college entrance examinations in the United States, and Hanson, in particular, brought his experience from a long relationship with the [[College Board]].<ref name=\"Mathews, p. 22\"/> According to Peterson, \"the breakthrough in the history of the IB\" came in 1965 with a grant from the [[The Century Foundation|Twentieth Century Fund]], which commissioned [[Martin Mayer (writer)|Martin Mayer]], author of ''The Schools'', to produce a report on the feasibility of establishing a common curriculum and examination for [[international school]]s that would be acceptable for entry to universities worldwide.<ref name=\"Peterson18-26\"/> This led to conferences involving Ecolint, [[Atlantic College|United World College of the Atlantic (UWC Atlantic College)]], and others in the spring and fall of 1965, at which details about the curriculum for the Diploma Programme were discussed and agreed upon.<ref name=\"Peterson18-26\"/>\n\nThe Ford Foundation grant, secured in 1966, funded Peterson's study at Oxford University, which focused on three issues: a comparative analysis of \"secondary educational programmes in European countries...in cooperation with the Council of Europe\"; university expectations for secondary students intending to enter university; and a \"statistical comparison of IB pilot examination results with...national school leaving examinations such as [[GCE Advanced Level|British A Levels]] and [[AP Program|US College Board (AP) Tests]]\".<ref name=\"Peterson18-26\"/><ref name=\"Fox65-75\"/> As a result of the study and the curriculum model developed at [[Atlantic College|UWC Atlantic College]], Peterson initiated the pattern of combining \"general education with specialization\", which melded with the curricula of the United States and Canada, and became the \"curriculum framework\"  proposed at the UNESCO conference in Geneva in 1967.<ref name=\"Fox65-75\"/> Late in 1967, ISES was restructured and renamed the IB Council of Foundation, and John Goormaghtigh became the first president in January 1968.<ref name=\"Peterson18-26\"/> In 1967, the group, which by then also included [[Ralph W.

There may be oral presentations (used in languages), practical work (in experimental sciences and performing arts), or written work. Internal assessment accounts for 20 to 50 percent of the mark awarded for each subject and is marked by a teacher in the school. A sample of at least five per subject at each level from a school will also be graded by a moderator appointed by the IB, in a process called external moderation of internal assessment. Based on this moderation, the grades of the whole subject from that school will change.<ref name=assessment/>\n\nPoints are awarded from 1 to 7, with 7 being equal to A*, 6 equal to A, and so on.

The programme provides an internationally accepted qualification for entry into higher education and is recognized by many universities worldwide. It was developed in the early to mid-1960s in [[Geneva|Geneva, Switzerland]], by a group of international educators. After a six-year pilot programme that ended in 1975, a bilingual diploma was established. \n\nAdministered by the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IB), the IBDP is taught in schools in over 140 countries, in one of three languages: English, French, or Spanish. In order to participate, students must attend an IB school. IBDP students complete assessments in six subjects, one from each [[#Subject groups|subject group]], and [[#Core requirements and subject groups|three core requirements]]. Students are evaluated using both internal and external assessments, and courses finish with an externally assessed series of examinations, usually consisting of two or three timed written tests. Internal assessment varies by subject: there may be oral presentations, practical work, or written work. \n\nGenerally, the IBDP has been well received. It has been commended for introducing interdisciplinary thinking to students. In the [[United Kingdom]], ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper claims that the IBDP is \"more academically challenging and broader than three or four [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels]]\".<ref name=\"guardian-2009-02-10\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/feb/10/international-baccalaureate-moved-amsterdam|title=Leap from Cardiff to Amsterdam for Baccalaureate|work=Guardian.co.uk|first=Jessica|last=Shepard|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=28 July 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\n==History and background==\nIn 1945 the \"Conference of Internationally-minded Schools\" asked the [[International School of Geneva]] (Ecolint) to create an international schools programme.<ref name=\"Peterson p. 17\">Peterson p. 17</ref><ref>Fox p. 5</ref> When he became director of Ecolint's English division, Desmond Cole-Baker began to develop the idea, and in 1962, his colleague Robert Leach organised a conference in Geneva, at which the term \"International Baccalaureate\" was first mentioned.<ref name=\"Peterson p. 17\"/><ref>HIll, 2007 p. 19</ref> An American social studies teacher, Leach organized the conference\u2014with a $2500 grant from [[UNESCO]]\u2014which was attended by observers from European schools and [[UNESCO]]. Writing about the genesis of the International Baccalaureate in ''Schools Across Frontiers'', [[Alec Peterson]] credits Leach as \"the original promoter of the International Baccalaureate.\"<ref>Peterson p. 18</ref>  At the end of the conference, Unesco funded the International School Association with an additional $10,000, which was inadequate to do more than produce a few papers, or bring teachers together for meetings.<ref name=\"Peterson18-26\">Peterson p. 18-26</ref>\n[[File:Ecolintchateau.jpg|thumb|right|Ch\u00e2teau at [[Ecolint]] where [[International Baccalaureate|IB]] was developed.]]\n\nBy 1964, international educators such as [[Alec Peterson]] (director of the Department of Education at [[Oxford University]]), [[Harlan Hanson]] (director of the [[AP Program|College Board Advanced Placement Program]]), Desmond Cole (director of [[United Nations International School]] in New York) and Desmond Cole-Baker (head of the International School of Geneva) founded the International Schools Examination Syndicate (ISES).<ref name=\"Fox65-75\">Fox, pp. 65-75</ref><ref name=\"Mathews, p. 22\">Mathews, p. 22</ref> Cole and Hanson brought experience with college entrance examinations in the United States, and Hanson, in particular, brought his experience from a long relationship with the [[College Board]].<ref name=\"Mathews, p. 22\"/> According to Peterson, \"the breakthrough in the history of the IB\" came in 1965 with a grant from the [[The Century Foundation|Twentieth Century Fund]], which commissioned [[Martin Mayer (writer)|Martin Mayer]], author of ''The Schools'', to produce a report on the feasibility of establishing a common curriculum and examination for [[international school]]s that would be acceptable for entry to universities worldwide.<ref name=\"Peterson18-26\"/> This led to conferences involving Ecolint, [[Atlantic College|United World College of the Atlantic (UWC Atlantic College)]], and others in the spring and fall of 1965, at which details about the curriculum for the Diploma Programme were discussed and agreed upon.<ref name=\"Peterson18-26\"/>\n\nThe Ford Foundation grant, secured in 1966, funded Peterson's study at Oxford University, which focused on three issues: a comparative analysis of \"secondary educational programmes in European countries...in cooperation with the Council of Europe\"; university expectations for secondary students intending to enter university; and a \"statistical comparison of IB pilot examination results with...national school leaving examinations such as [[GCE Advanced Level|British A Levels]] and [[AP Program|US College Board (AP) Tests]]\".<ref name=\"Peterson18-26\"/><ref name=\"Fox65-75\"/> As a result of the study and the curriculum model developed at [[Atlantic College|UWC Atlantic College]], Peterson initiated the pattern of combining \"general education with specialization\", which melded with the curricula of the United States and Canada, and became the \"curriculum framework\"  proposed at the UNESCO conference in Geneva in 1967.<ref name=\"Fox65-75\"/> Late in 1967, ISES was restructured and renamed the IB Council of Foundation, and John Goormaghtigh became the first president in January 1968.<ref name=\"Peterson18-26\"/> In 1967, the group, which by then also included [[Ralph W.

There may be oral presentations (used in languages), practical work (in experimental sciences and performing arts), or written work. Internal assessment accounts for 20 to 50 percent of the mark awarded for each subject and is marked by a teacher in the school. A sample of at least five per subject at each level from a school will also be graded by a moderator appointed by the IB, in a process called external moderation of internal assessment. Based on this moderation, the grades of the whole subject from that school will change.<ref name=assessment/>\n\nPoints are awarded from 1 to 7, with 7 being equal to A*, 6 equal to A, and so on.
