While he did not feel the effects for many years, after he entered [[middle age]] in his 50s, the strain of this exertion increasingly weighed upon his body. Ultimately, it resulted in Aang dying at the relatively young biological age of 66, in 153 AG. Aang was survived by his wife, Katara, and his three children, but he did not live to see his grandchildren, all of whom would become powerful Airbenders. Prior to his death, Aang tasked the Order of the White Lotus with finding and guiding the new Avatar after him. When Aang died, the Avatar spirit reincarnated into [[Korra]] of the Southern Water Tribe. Aang intended for the Order to simply guide and guard Korra, but several mishaps in the aftermath of Aang's death (including a kidnapping attempt by the anarchist [[Zaheer]]) and the still-fragile state of relations between the now-Five Nations resulted in Katara and Tenzin sequestering Korra in a compound at the South Pole, bringing teachers to her instead of allowing her to seek out her own.\n\n====Book One: Air====\n[[File:Legend of Korra Aang.png|thumb|Avatar Aang's spirit with [[Korra]] in ''The Legend of Korra''.]]\nIn the sequel series' first season, Avatar Aang's spirit occasionally serves as the spiritual advisor to seventeen-year-old Korra (much like the previous Avatar incarnation, Roku, did for Aang). Initially, Aang is only able to give Korra glimpses of his memory concerning Yakone in relation to her confrontations with his two sons, [[Amon (The Legend of Korra)|Amon]] and Tarrlok, the products of Yakone's Bloodbending vendetta on the Avatar. It is only after she loses her ability to bend that Korra allows herself to listen to her past lives, at which point Aang restores her powers by triggering the Avatar State and teaching her to Energybend.\n\n====Book Two: Spirits====\nThe sequel series' second season reveals that Avatar Aang apparently treated Tenzin as his favorite child, due to his son's Airbender status; Kya and Bumi mentioned to Tenzin that Aang always took Tenzin on vacations with him, but never them. Aang's Air Acolytes also were unaware that Aang had two other children besides Tenzin. Tenzin himself insists that Aang loved all his children equally, but that Aang took more precedence in raising him since Tenzin would have to take care of future generations of airbenders. Aang himself later appears, along with Roku, Kyoshi and Kuruk, before Korra in a vision and encourages her to learn the origins of Wan (the first Avatar) and Raava. Aang, or possibly a vision of him, later appears in the Spirit World, encouraging Tenzin to move past the enormous legacy of being Aang's son and find his own path. Korra's connection to Aang and the other preceding Avatars is severed when Vaatu extracts and subsequently kills Raava, the divine Avatar Spirit entity within her. Even though Raava is reborn and fused again with Korra, she discovers, to her dismay, that her spiritual connection to Aang and all past Avatars is gone forever.\n\n====Book Three: Change====\nWhen Zaheer gave an ultimatum: Surrender to him or lose the new airbenders, Korra mediated into the spirit realm, she expressed her wish to call upon Aang's spirit and ask his advice in saving the new Air Nomads. Iroh's spirit assured her that, even though Aang was no longer able to guide her, she could ask one of Aang's closest friends: [[Zuko|Lord Zuko]].\n\n===Appearances in other media===\n====Games====\nAang's character appeared in the ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender Trading Card Game]]'' on a multitude of cards.<ref name=\"Trading Cards\"/><ref name=\"Trading Cards 2\"/> He appeared in the [[Avatar: The Last Airbender (video game)|''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' video game]] as one of the four [[Player character|playable characters]].<ref name=\"AvatarVideoGame\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nick.com/games/avatar-games|title=Avatar: The Last Airbender Video Game|accessdate=2008-03-22|work=Nick.com|publisher=Nickelodeon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206045806/http://www.nick.com/games/avatar-games|archive-date=2013-02-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> Two sequels were made: ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;\u2013 The Burning Earth]]'',<ref name=\"The Burning Earth\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/objects/905/905219.html|title=IGN.com: Avatar: The Burning Earth|accessdate=2008-03-13|publisher=IGN|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925154305/http://wii.ign.com/objects/905/905219.html|archive-date=2008-09-25|url-status=dead}}</ref> followed by ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;\u2013 Into the Inferno]]''.\n\nAang also appeared in ''Escape from the Spirit World'', an online video game that can be found on Nickelodeon's official website.

The casting of a presumed [[White American|white]] actor in the role of Aang (as well as a primarily [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] cast) in the Asian-influenced ''Avatar'' universe triggered negative reactions from some fans, marked by accusations of racism, a letter-writing campaign, and a protest outside of a [[Philadelphia]] casting call for movie extras.

The series' creators consulted a professional martial artist in the design of the show's fighting style; each of these styles philosophies and set movements corresponds to a specific \"bending arts\".<ref name=\"Kisu\">{{cite web | title=Kisu - Filmography by TV Series | url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0457467/filmoseries?ref_=nm_flmg_msc_1#tt0417299 |publisher=IMDb | accessdate=2013-10-21}}</ref>\n\nThe creators made bending a natural extension of consistent limitations and rules of the world. Everything in Avatar's world, whether it be clothing, culture or infrastructure, is influenced by bending. The City of Omashu uses a complex system of gravity and earthbending to transport supplies. The Water Tribes were a naval superpower: their buildings are made of ice and used waterbending as mechanisms for their walls and gates. Airbenders built temples atop high mountains and cliffs that could only be easily reached by Airbending and they have a hermetic ideology to reflect this isolation. The Fire Nation were the first to industrialize due to their ability to generate power and master [[metallurgy]] with their bending of fire and lightning.\n\nAt the start of the series, Aang is initially only proficient in air, having been able to bend them with ease since he was a young child. Through the teaching Katara and Zuko, he gradually learns waterbending and firebending; but struggles with Toph's teachings of earthbending due to its rigid nature conflicting with his desire for freedom. Aang utilizes all elements equally, but heavily favors airbending for crowd control and non-lethal purposes, in accordance with his [[pacifism]] principles.\n\n*'''Airbending''': the martial art Aang primarily uses in the entire franchise, is a ''Southern Temple Style'' based on an \"[[Neijia|internal]]\" [[Chinese martial arts|Chinese martial art]] called [[Baguazhang]]. Aang is the only person in [[living memory]] to have mastered this form of airbending, and would later pass down this knowledge to his son, [[Tenzin]], who with the aid of [[Korra]], would prove instrumental in the reconstruction and preservation of Air Nomad oral and [[intangible cultural heritage]]. Due to the genocide of his people, all other \"styles of airbending arts\" have been forever lost to history. This fighting style focuses on circular movements, and does not have many finishing moves; traits meant to represent the unpredictability of air and the peaceful character of Airbenders.<ref name=\"NickAv\">{{cite web| url = http://www.nick.com/shows/avatar/| title = Nickelodeon's Official Avatar: The Last Airbender Flash Site| accessdate = 2006-12-02| publisher = Nick.com}}</ref> Airbending represents the element of freedom,<ref name=\"Ehasz, Aaron 2006\">Ehasz, Aaron (writer) & Spaulding, Ethan (director).

Airbending involves \"smooth coiling and uncoiling actions\"; dynamic footwork, throws, and open-handed techniques; and swift, evasive maneuvers designed to evoke the \"intangibility and explosive power of wind\". These techniques are intended to increase the difficulty for opponents to attack directly or land a lethal blow\u2014allowing airbenders to defend themselves while also protecting their attacker from injury\u2014a pacifist-philosophy that is prevalent among the Air Nomad people. Airbending lacks \"finishing moves\" or effective methods for permanently disabling foes, a weakness frequently exploited by opponents.\n*'''Waterbending''': the martial art Katara teaches Aang in the series, is based on [[Chinese martial arts]] techniques of \"[[Neijia|internal style]]\" [[T'ai chi ch'uan]] and [[Jeet Kune Do]]. When Aang traveled north, he learned ''Northern Tribe Yin-style''. During the [[Legend of Korra]], Katara is the only Master of \"[[Yang-style t'ai chi ch'uan|Southern Tribe Yang-style]]\", forced to reconstruct the style from surviving manuscripts; all other masters were killed, their collective knowledge [[Book burning|confiscated or destroyed]] by the Fire Nation.<ref>The Lost Scrolls: Water, page 31 of The Lost Scrolls Collection.</ref><ref name=\"kungfumagazine.com\">http://www.kungfumagazine.com/ezine/article.php?article=1038</ref><ref name=\"NickAv\"/><ref name=\"Return To Omashu\">{{cite episode|title=Return to Omashu|airdate=April 7, 2006|season=2|number=3|credits=Director: Ethan Spaulding; Writer: Elizabeth Welch Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon|episodelink=Avatar: The Last Airbender (Season 2)#ep23}}</ref> Waterbending represents the element of change - a shapeshifter constantly changing forms -<ref name=\"Ehasz, Aaron 2006\"/> and is categorized as the most adaptive or pliable of the \"four bending arts\".

Earthbending utilizes ''[[Jing (Chinese medicine)|neutral jing]]'', which involves waiting and listening for the right moment to act decisively. Earthbending involves enduring attacks until the right opportunity to counterattack reveals itself, emphasizes \"heavily rooted stances and strong blows that evoke the mass and power of earth\", and demands precise [[Footwork (martial arts)|stepping footwork]] to maintain constant contact with the ground. Earthbending parallels [[Five Animals]] movements (such as the tiger's hard blows and the crane's affinity to landing gracefully). Earthbending is at its strongest when the feet or hand are in direct contact with the ground, enabling earthbenders to transfer their kinetic energies into their bending for fast and powerful moves. This reliance on direct contact with the earth is a literal [[Achilles' heel]]; separating earthbenders from any contact with the earth renders them ineffective.\n*'''Firebending''': the martial art Zuko teaches Aang in the series, is based on [[chinese martial arts]] techniques of [[Changquan]], [[Shaolin Kung Fu|Shaolinquan]], [[Southern Dragon Kung Fu|L\u00f3ng X\u00edng M\u00f3 Qi\u00e1o]] and [[Xing Yi Quan]].<ref>The Lost Scrolls: Fire, page 159 of The Lost Scrolls Collection.</ref><ref name=\"kungfumagazine.com\"/><ref name=\"NickAv\"/><ref name=\"Return To Omashu\"/> A century of warfare have corrupted the Fire Nation's rich culture, and with it, their firebending-styles \"regressed\" into militarized format based on hatred and raw aggression; Zuko and Aang sought to learn firebending in its purest and most harmonious form, and rediscovered ''Dancing Dragon Style'' from the last surviving dragons.\n*'''Energybending''': Aang learned energybending from his desire not to kill. He is able to use energybending to connect with his inner spirit and gain cosmic energy from the universe.\n\n===The Avatar State===\n[[File:Avatar reincarnations.png|thumb|right|alt=The Avatars standing in line, including Aang, Roku, Kyoshi, Kuruk, and Yangchen, in that order.|The Avatars (from right to left): Aang, Roku, Kyoshi, Kuruk, Yangchen, and other previous Avatars.]]\n\nAs the Avatar, Aang is as a bridge between \"[[Nature|Material World]]\" and the \"[[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|Spirit World]]\", the plane of existence where the universe's disembodied spirits dwell. His spirituality training progressed swiftly, granting visions and access to the various memories from his past lives.\n\nHis most powerful ability is the [[Avatar State]], which allows him to access bending techniques he would not have learned during his own lifetime but throughout that of his predecessors. In addition, he also receives a massive boost in raw power, enabling him to easily overcome any opponent that tries to fight him head on. The form is activated by Aang being in a predicament that he will either not be able to combat with his current skills or when his life is in mortal danger. While speaking in the Avatar State, Aang's voice becomes in-sync with that of Raava's as a testament to their connection.

As a result of Fire Lord Sozin's increasingly hostile attitude towards the other nations, the senior monks decided to reveal Aang's nature as the Avatar four years before the traditional age (Avatars are usually told of their status once they turn 16) and relocate him to one of the other Air Temples.<ref name=\"The Storm\">{{cite episode|title=The Storm|airdate=2005-06-03|season=1|number=12|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref><ref name=\"The Southern Air Temple\">{{cite episode|title=The Southern Air Temple|airdate=2005-02-25|season=1|number=3|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan, Writer: Michael Dante DiMartino|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> Learning that he was to be taken from Gyatso caused Aang to flee the monastery on his flying bison, Appa, before being caught by a storm; the life-or-death conditions triggered the Avatar State, encasing the young Avatar and his bison in an air-pocket among [[iceberg]]s, where he remained suspended for a century.

While he did not feel the effects for many years, after he entered [[middle age]] in his 50s, the strain of this exertion increasingly weighed upon his body. Ultimately, it resulted in Aang dying at the relatively young biological age of 66, in 153 AG. Aang was survived by his wife, Katara, and his three children, but he did not live to see his grandchildren, all of whom would become powerful Airbenders. Prior to his death, Aang tasked the Order of the White Lotus with finding and guiding the new Avatar after him. When Aang died, the Avatar spirit reincarnated into [[Korra]] of the Southern Water Tribe. Aang intended for the Order to simply guide and guard Korra, but several mishaps in the aftermath of Aang's death (including a kidnapping attempt by the anarchist [[Zaheer]]) and the still-fragile state of relations between the now-Five Nations resulted in Katara and Tenzin sequestering Korra in a compound at the South Pole, bringing teachers to her instead of allowing her to seek out her own.\n\n====Book One: Air====\n[[File:Legend of Korra Aang.png|thumb|Avatar Aang's spirit with [[Korra]] in ''The Legend of Korra''.]]\nIn the sequel series' first season, Avatar Aang's spirit occasionally serves as the spiritual advisor to seventeen-year-old Korra (much like the previous Avatar incarnation, Roku, did for Aang). Initially, Aang is only able to give Korra glimpses of his memory concerning Yakone in relation to her confrontations with his two sons, [[Amon (The Legend of Korra)|Amon]] and Tarrlok, the products of Yakone's Bloodbending vendetta on the Avatar. It is only after she loses her ability to bend that Korra allows herself to listen to her past lives, at which point Aang restores her powers by triggering the Avatar State and teaching her to Energybend.\n\n====Book Two: Spirits====\nThe sequel series' second season reveals that Avatar Aang apparently treated Tenzin as his favorite child, due to his son's Airbender status; Kya and Bumi mentioned to Tenzin that Aang always took Tenzin on vacations with him, but never them. Aang's Air Acolytes also were unaware that Aang had two other children besides Tenzin. Tenzin himself insists that Aang loved all his children equally, but that Aang took more precedence in raising him since Tenzin would have to take care of future generations of airbenders. Aang himself later appears, along with Roku, Kyoshi and Kuruk, before Korra in a vision and encourages her to learn the origins of Wan (the first Avatar) and Raava. Aang, or possibly a vision of him, later appears in the Spirit World, encouraging Tenzin to move past the enormous legacy of being Aang's son and find his own path. Korra's connection to Aang and the other preceding Avatars is severed when Vaatu extracts and subsequently kills Raava, the divine Avatar Spirit entity within her. Even though Raava is reborn and fused again with Korra, she discovers, to her dismay, that her spiritual connection to Aang and all past Avatars is gone forever.\n\n====Book Three: Change====\nWhen Zaheer gave an ultimatum: Surrender to him or lose the new airbenders, Korra mediated into the spirit realm, she expressed her wish to call upon Aang's spirit and ask his advice in saving the new Air Nomads. Iroh's spirit assured her that, even though Aang was no longer able to guide her, she could ask one of Aang's closest friends: [[Zuko|Lord Zuko]].\n\n===Appearances in other media===\n====Games====\nAang's character appeared in the ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender Trading Card Game]]'' on a multitude of cards.<ref name=\"Trading Cards\"/><ref name=\"Trading Cards 2\"/> He appeared in the [[Avatar: The Last Airbender (video game)|''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' video game]] as one of the four [[Player character|playable characters]].<ref name=\"AvatarVideoGame\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nick.com/games/avatar-games|title=Avatar: The Last Airbender Video Game|accessdate=2008-03-22|work=Nick.com|publisher=Nickelodeon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206045806/http://www.nick.com/games/avatar-games|archive-date=2013-02-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> Two sequels were made: ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;\u2013 The Burning Earth]]'',<ref name=\"The Burning Earth\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/objects/905/905219.html|title=IGN.com: Avatar: The Burning Earth|accessdate=2008-03-13|publisher=IGN|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925154305/http://wii.ign.com/objects/905/905219.html|archive-date=2008-09-25|url-status=dead}}</ref> followed by ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;\u2013 Into the Inferno]]''.\n\nAang also appeared in ''Escape from the Spirit World'', an online video game that can be found on Nickelodeon's official website.

Everything in Avatar's world, whether it be clothing, culture or infrastructure, is influenced by bending. The City of Omashu uses a complex system of gravity and earthbending to transport supplies. The Water Tribes were a naval superpower: their buildings are made of ice and used waterbending as mechanisms for their walls and gates. Airbenders built temples atop high mountains and cliffs that could only be easily reached by Airbending and they have a hermetic ideology to reflect this isolation. The Fire Nation were the first to industrialize due to their ability to generate power and master [[metallurgy]] with their bending of fire and lightning.\n\nAt the start of the series, Aang is initially only proficient in air, having been able to bend them with ease since he was a young child. Through the teaching Katara and Zuko, he gradually learns waterbending and firebending; but struggles with Toph's teachings of earthbending due to its rigid nature conflicting with his desire for freedom. Aang utilizes all elements equally, but heavily favor's airbending for crowd control and non-lethal purposes, in accordance with his [[pacifism]] principles.\n\n*'''Airbending''': the martial art Aang primarily uses in the entire franchise, is a ''Southern Temple Style'' based on an \"[[Neijia|internal]]\" [[Chinese martial arts|Chinese martial art]] called [[Baguazhang]]. Aang is the only person in [[living memory]] to have mastered this form of airbending, and would later pass down this knowledge to his son, [[Tenzin]], who with the aid of [[Korra]], would prove instrumental in the reconstruction and preservation of Air Nomad oral and [[intangible cultural heritage]]. Due to the genocide of his people, all other \"styles of airbending arts\" have been forever lost to history. This fighting style focuses on circular movements, and does not have many finishing moves; traits meant to represent the unpredictability of air and the peaceful character of Airbenders.<ref name=\"NickAv\">{{cite web| url = http://www.nick.com/shows/avatar/| title = Nickelodeon's Official Avatar: The Last Airbender Flash Site| accessdate = 2006-12-02| publisher = Nick.com}}</ref> Airbending represents the element of freedom,<ref name=\"Ehasz, Aaron 2006\">Ehasz, Aaron (writer) & Spaulding, Ethan (director).

Airbending involves \"smooth coiling and uncoiling actions\"; dynamic footwork, throws, and open-handed techniques; and swift, evasive maneuvers designed to evoke the \"intangibility and explosive power of wind\". These techniques are intended to increase the difficulty for opponents to attack directly or land a lethal blow\u2014allowing airbenders to defend themselves while also protecting their attacker from injury\u2014a pacifist-philosophy that is prevalent among the Air Nomad people. Airbending lacks \"finishing moves\" or effective methods for permanently disabling foes, a weakness frequently exploited by opponents.\n*'''Waterbending''': the martial art Katara teaches Aang in the series, is based on [[Chinese martial arts]] techniques of \"[[Neijia|internal style]]\" [[T'ai chi ch'uan]] and [[Jeet Kune Do]].

Earthbending utilizes ''[[Jing (Chinese medicine)|neutral jing]]'', which involves waiting and listening for the right moment to act decisively. Earthbending involves enduring attacks until the right opportunity to counterattack reveals itself, emphasizes \"heavily rooted stances and strong blows that evoke the mass and power of earth\", and demands precise [[Footwork (martial arts)|stepping footwork]] to maintain constant contact with the ground. Earthbending parallels [[Five Animals]] movements (such as the tiger's hard blows and the crane's affinity to landing gracefully). Earthbending is at its strongest when the feet or hand are in direct contact with the ground, enabling earthbenders to transfer their kinetic energies into their bending for fast and powerful moves. This reliance on direct contact with the earth is a literal [[Achilles' heel]]; separating earthbenders from any contact with the earth renders them ineffective.\n*'''Firebending''': the martial art Zuko teaches Aang in the series, is based on [[chinese martial arts]] techniques of [[Changquan]], [[Shaolin Kung Fu|Shaolinquan]], [[Southern Dragon Kung Fu|L\u00f3ng X\u00edng M\u00f3 Qi\u00e1o]] and [[Xing Yi Quan]].<ref>The Lost Scrolls: Fire, page 159 of The Lost Scrolls Collection.</ref><ref name=\"kungfumagazine.com\"/><ref name=\"NickAv\"/><ref name=\"Return To Omashu\"/> A century of warfare have corrupted the Fire Nation's rich culture, and with it, their firebending-styles \"regressed\" into militarized format based on hatred and raw aggression; Zuko and Aang sought to learn firebending in its purest and most harmonious form, and rediscovered ''Dancing Dragon Style'' from the last surviving dragons.\n*'''Energybending''': Aang learned energybending from his desire not to kill. He is able to use energybending to connect with his inner spirit and gain cosmic energy from the universe.\n\n===The Avatar State===\n[[File:Avatar reincarnations.png|thumb|right|alt=The Avatars standing in line, including Aang, Roku, Kyoshi, Kuruk, and Yangchen, in that order.|The Avatars (from right to left): Aang, Roku, Kyoshi, Kuruk, Yangchen, and other previous Avatars.]]\n\nAs the Avatar, Aang is as a bridge between \"[[Nature|Material World]]\" and the \"[[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|Spirit World]]\", the plane of existence where the universe's disembodied spirits dwell. His spirituality training progressed swiftly, granting visions and access to the various memories from his past lives.\n\nHis most powerful ability is the [[Avatar State]], which allows him to access bending techniques he would not have learned during his own lifetime but throughout that of his predecessors. In addition, he also receives a massive boost in raw power, enabling him to easily overcome any opponent that tries to fight him head on. The form is activated by Aang being in a predicament that he will either not be able to combat with his current skills or when his life is in mortal danger.

He has played a significant role in the development of the \"Denver Sound\", music that mixes elements of [[country music|country]], [[Gothic rock|gothic]], [[Folk music|folk]] and [[gospel music|gospel]]. He is a current member of [[Slim Cessna's Auto Club]], Munly and the Lupercalians, and Denver Broncos UK (DBUK). He was the leader of Munly and the Lee Lewis Harlots from approximately 2000 to 2006. \n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood and upbringing ===\n\nMunly was born and raised [[Quebec, Canada]] in a \"privileged\",<ref name=\"Munly Vents\" /> \"stereotypical Catholic family\"<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\">{{cite news |last1=Forman |first1=Bill |title=Wulf at the door |url=https://m.csindy.com/coloradosprings/wulf-at-the-door/Content?oid=1974001 |accessdate=March 26, 2020 |work=Colorado Springs Indy |publisher=Colorado Springs Independent |date=December 23, 2010 |ref=Munly on Vera}}</ref> with two parents and two siblings \u2013 one brother<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\">{{cite news |last1=Solomon |first1=Jon |title=Munly talks Slim Cessna's Auto Club's new album and seeing Billy Bragg for the first time |url=https://www.westword.com/music/munly-talks-slim-cessnas-auto-clubs-new-album-and-seeing-billy-bragg-for-the-first-time-5719289 |accessdate=March 23, 2020 |work=Westword |date=December 27, 2012 |ref=Munly Acting Westword}}</ref> and one sister.<ref name=\"Munly ORH\">{{cite news |title=Munly Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://archive.org/details/OutsightRadioHoursInterviews2000-2010/KramerEddie.rm |accessdate=April 5, 2020 |work=Outsight Radio Hours |issue=Interview No. 252 |publisher=Archive.org |date=October 26, 2004 |ref=Munly ORH}}</ref><ref name=\"Coolstreams\">{{cite web |title=CoolStreams Internet Radio \u2013 Jay Munly |url=http://musicsojourn.com/AR/Alt/page/m/MunlyJay.htm |website=musicsojourn.com |accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref> He also spent time at his family's lakeside summer retreat in Ellsworth, Ohio,<ref name=\"A Munly Man\">{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Brad |title=A Munly Man |url=https://www.westword.com/music/a-munly-man-5055649 |accessdate=March 26, 2020 |work=Westword |date=October 18, 1995 |ref=A Munly Man}}</ref> outside of Youngstown.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Splendid Web Media |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |archivedate=August 6, 2002}}</ref>\n\nHe was a well-behaved child growing up, rarely getting into trouble.

The song \"Cooney vs. Munly\" on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002) was written as a tribute to him.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /> In fact, the ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' album may have been named as such due to the comparisons he draws between the way he and former U.S. president [[Jimmy Carter]] grew up: \n\n{{quote|''\"We grew up similarly...he had a nanny who sort of raised him. I was in that situation, more than my parents raising me. So there are some similarities.\"'' <ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />}}\n\nOne of the first concerts that he ever attended was [[Billy Bragg]] opening for [[Echo and the Bunnymen]] at Denver's [[Rainbow Music Hall]], presumably around \"11 or 12 years old.\"<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" /> According to a music blog, the actual date of the concert was September 3, 1984, making Munly actually 14 years old at the time.<ref name=\"Munly Concert\">{{cite web |title=Echo and The Bunnymen @ Rainbow Music Hall, 1984-09-03 |url=http://thatsthethingaboutthat.blogspot.com/2018/07/echo-and-bunnymen-rainbow-music-hall.html |website=That's The Thing About That (Blogspot) |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=Munly Concert}}</ref>\n\nWhen he was older, presumably in his 20s, he moved to [[Boulder, Colorado]] before eventually moving to [[Denver]].<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> In a 2009 interview, he said that he identifies more with being an American from Denver than with being a Canadian from Quebec.<ref name=\"Crawdaddy\" />\n\n===Interest in ice hockey===\n\nTaking interest in [[ice hockey]] as a young man in Canada, Munly grew up a [[Montreal Canadiens]] fan.\n\nHe played hockey as a child in Canada and the U.S. before a related injury side-lined him. In a 2012 interview with [[Westword]], he says that his brother took him to the [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)|Bob Johnson]] ice hockey school to play.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from an ice hockey injury. He also had some familial ties: his father and grandfather owned and played banjos, and his father also made a [[dulcimer]] for his mother as a gift, although she did not play it.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nWhile recuperating from said injury, Munly taught himself how to play his father's 19th century-era [[banjo]], which was technically off-limits to handle,<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\" /> although his mother knew what was going on. She eventually bought him a guitar which he taught himself to play as well.<ref name=\"Munly Syffal\">{{cite news |last1=Frieders |first1=Joel |title=Our Interview With Munly J.

It is a role that he is happy to take on by himself, believing that a band's success is dependent on playing to individual strengths rather than collaboration with members on each part of an album's creation.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" /> He also says that he is \"selfish\" with his written material and serious about lyrical preservation.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\nHe expanded on his way of songwriting in a 2019 interview with Sadwave, a Russian publication:\n\n{{quote|''\"From the very beginning, I understand where and why I'm writing a song. There is no complicated science. When you have been doing this for so many years, you bring the skill to automatism. I can start with a melody, but I can with a text \u2013 I always have a lot of words, I write a lot. I constantly find common themes in my songs, but I never had the feeling that I was working on a pattern. It would be immoral and unnatural, and I would not want to. I have characters who constantly come back, wander from song to song. But I try to change the angle, write on behalf of different people. On behalf of all sad people.\"'' <ref name=\"Munly Sadwave\">{{cite news |last1=Kurkin |first1=Dmitry |title=Jay Manley [sic] (DBUK): 'I try to write on behalf of all sad people' |url=https://sadwave.com/2019/02/jay-munli/ |accessdate=5 April 2020 |work=sad wave |date=February 8, 2019 |ref=Munly Sadwave |language=Russian}}</ref>}}\n\n===Musical themes and genres===\n\nHis music has ties to [[alt-country]] and [[Gothabilly|Gothic-Americana]]. Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\nOne topic that Munly deliberately does not write about is politics, since he \"hates\" music that veers into that kind of territory.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he admits that the stories and songs that he writes can be applied to real-world events in a way that coincidentally fits.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\n===Vocals===\n\nTechnically, Munly is a baritone, but his [[vocal range]] extends from A1 to F5.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 1\">{{cite news |title=Jay \"Munly\" Munly |url=https://therangeplanet.proboards.com/thread/14/jay-munly |accessdate=9 April 2020 |work=The Range Planet |date=September 22, 2019 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 1}}</ref> Audio samples can be found on Youtube.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 2\">{{cite web |title=The Vocal Range of Jay Munly |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_hVoW0VwVA |via=YouTube |accessdate=April 9, 2020 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 2}}</ref> \n\nEarly on in his solo career, he sang at a higher register than what he usually sounds like on his later records. \n\nOn the expanded DVDs of ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004) and ''The Commandments According to SCAC'' (2016), Munly read the lyrics of each song as poetry, employing a wide range of voices to the characters in his songs.\n\n===Controversial lyrics===\n\nAs stated in a few interviews, people have found some of Munly's material controversial and politically incorrect. It is important to note that in most cases, the words and phrases used (as well as the views they represent) are that of the fictional characters that Munly creates, not of Munly himself.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ''\"Boys with tattoos can't be Jews\"'' \u2013 from \"Kidneys Running Dry\" on ''Blurry'' (1996)<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /><ref name=\"KRD Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Munly \u2013 Kidneys Running Dry |url=https://genius.com/Munly-kidneys-running-dry-lyrics?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=bd3ae05fe6c1e2a47c4f0713ffa5a16e71fce6fd-1586308658-0-AacccNM6Up3QUKAwcxWr7moI6buvh28pOpYPxYODrvwTY_F1arxPxbTRgSuWyl4Xdp0ySY_ZseZwWCStv8dumtz5AhmL5llOOnD9_3dv6-XTquwykYgduqCixdMk01PstYrSa8KQZi4SK3emYdNuLlbX4RFCHJbwQ1YRExOJjd6dkKD1_GHgcdfYYDe-vTJWI1uyX_0R8Q64ZevT3n-7A-7f2-ifsSZoF6J2JCq_RT2aMwKoWBxbHjarJrGdvNiZWwohYzH2ba2tN14wf2PwTXEzsdbFCgp-hDaOKuoeEYASB7ZBgYOJT_5LMn8GQ2PkKSfxVXNgggJO-I6ajZK3bMX27bSVAiYaqRheMbR_klyaHJvQPTQvRxAPyOR5CZ1c9A |website=Genius |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=KRD Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[a] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"My Darling Sambo\" \u2013 the first track title on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"JCS Amazon\">{{cite web |title=MUNLY, JAY \u2013 Jimmy Carter Syndrome |url=https://www.amazon.com/Jimmy-Carter-Syndrome-JAY-MUNLY/dp/B000BKWZOI |website=Amazon Music |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=JCS Amazon}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[b] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Paint your blackface/Yeah, won't you put me in your anteroom case/I'll be your n***er/On stage\"'' \u2013 from \"Censer from the Footlights\" on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"CFTF Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Jay Munly \u2013 Censer from the Footlights Lyrics |url=http://www.songlyrics.com/jay-munly/censer-from-the-footlights-lyrics/ |website=SongLyrics |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=CFTF Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[c] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[d] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[e] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[f] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Then we found ourselves a half-breed/To tell us our fortune today/He painted my hands a deep, dark red/Said 'now boy, you know that you gotta pay'\"'' \u2013 from \"Goose Walking Over My Grave\" on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"Munly Birds\">{{cite news |last1=Bradley |first1=Lisa M. |title=A Crack in Its Speak: Fantastic Birds in the Gothic Country Lyrics of Jay Munly |url=http://stonetelling.com/issue8-aug2012/bradley-speak.html |accessdate=April 6, 2020 |work=Stone Telling |issue=Issue No. 8 |date=August 2012 |ref=Munly Birds}}</ref><ref name=\"Goose Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Lyrics \u2013 Goose Walking Over My Grave |url=https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Munly-The-Lee-Lewis-Harlots/Goose-Walking-Over-My-Grave |website=Musixmatch |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=Goose Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[g] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"Cassius Castrato The She-Male of the Men's Prison\" \u2013 the fifth track title on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"LLH Album\">{{cite web |title=Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com/collections/munly/products/munly-the-lee-lewis-harlots |website=slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=LLH Album}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[h] ]]</sup>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist. He had toured with The Reejers before releasing his first album. He also shared a 7-inch vinyl album with [[Roger Manning]].<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" />\n\nHe released his debut solo album, ''Blurry'', in 1996 through Top Notch, an imprint of [[What Are Records?]]. ''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002. Each of these albums were re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released as limited editions through Smooch Records in 2006. Only 1,000 copies of each were printed.\n\nHe has worked with several musicians that are featured on his albums, such as John Ellison of The Reejers and Chris Mars of The Replacements.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nAlthough Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitates to call himself a \"singer-songwriter\":\n\n''{{quote|\"It's kind of rough being a solo artist.

The song \"Cooney vs. Munly\" on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002) was written as a tribute to him.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /> In fact, the ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' album may have been named as such due to the comparisons he draws between the way he and former U.S. president [[Jimmy Carter]] grew up: \n\n{{quote|''\"We grew up similarly...he had a nanny who sort of raised him.

In a 2012 interview with [[Westword]], he says that his brother took him to the [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)|Bob Johnson]] ice hockey school to play.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from an ice hockey injury. He also had some familial ties: his father and grandfather owned and played banjos, and his father also made a [[dulcimer]] for his mother as a gift, although she did not play it.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nWhile recuperating from said injury, Munly taught himself how to play his father's 19th century-era [[banjo]], which was technically off-limits to handle,<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\" /> although his mother knew what was going on.

It is a role that he is happy to take on by himself, believing that a band's success is dependent on playing to individual strengths rather than collaboration with members on each part of an album's creation.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" /> He also says that he is \"selfish\" with his written material and serious about lyrical preservation.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\nHe expanded on his way of songwriting in a 2019 interview with Sadwave, a Russian publication:\n\n{{quote|''\"From the very beginning, I understand where and why I'm writing a song. There is no complicated science. When you have been doing this for so many years, you bring the skill to automatism. I can start with a melody, but I can with a text \u2013 I always have a lot of words, I write a lot. I constantly find common themes in my songs, but I never had the feeling that I was working on a pattern. It would be immoral and unnatural, and I would not want to. I have characters who constantly come back, wander from song to song. But I try to change the angle, write on behalf of different people.

Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\nOne topic that Munly deliberately does not write about is politics, since he \"hates\" music that veers into that kind of territory.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he admits that the stories and songs that he writes can be applied to real-world events in a way that coincidentally fits.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\nHis written works have been compared to that of [[Edward Gorey]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Charles Portis]],<ref name=\"SC NARC\">{{cite news |last1=Fisher |first1=Lee |title=Interview: Slim Cessna's Auto Club |url=https://narcmagazine.com/slim-cessnas-auto-club/ |accessdate=18 April 2020 |work=NARC. |publisher=NARC Magazine |date=October 10, 2016 |ref=SC NARC}}</ref> [[Flannery O'Connor]],<ref name=\"SC Lonesome\">{{cite news |last1=Rapid |first1=Steve |title=Slim Cessna: An Introduction to Young and Old Ireland |url=https://www.lonesomehighway.com/interviewsold/2017/10/3/slim-cessna-interview.html |accessdate=18 April 2020 |work=Lonesome Highway |date=October 3, 2017 |ref=SC Lonesome}}</ref> [[David Byrne]],<ref name=\"SCAC San Diego\">{{cite news |last1=Roche |first1=Donovan |title=Slim Cessna's hillbilly hootenanny |url=https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2017/feb/24/concert-slim-cessnas-hillbilly-hootenany/ |accessdate=18 April 2020 |work=San Diego Reader |date=February 24, 2017 |ref=SCAC San Diego}}</ref> [[Brian Ritchie]], [[Daniel Johnston]],<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> and [[Nick Cave]].\n\n===Vocals===\n\nTechnically, Munly is a baritone, but his [[vocal range]] extends from A1 to F5.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 1\">{{cite news |title=Jay \"Munly\" Munly |url=https://therangeplanet.proboards.com/thread/14/jay-munly |accessdate=9 April 2020 |work=The Range Planet |date=September 22, 2019 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 1}}</ref> Audio samples can be found on Youtube.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 2\">{{cite web |title=The Vocal Range of Jay Munly |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_hVoW0VwVA |via=YouTube |accessdate=April 9, 2020 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 2}}</ref> \n\nEarly on in his solo career, he sang at a higher register than what he usually sounds like on his later records. \n\nOn the expanded DVDs of ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004) and ''The Commandments According to SCAC'' (2016), Munly read the lyrics of each song as poetry, employing a wide range of voices to the characters in his songs.\n\n===Controversial lyrics===\n\nAs stated in a few interviews, people have found some of Munly's material controversial and politically incorrect.

''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002. Each of these albums were re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released as limited editions through Smooch Records in 2006. Only 1,000 copies of each were printed.\n\nHe has worked with several musicians that are featured on his albums, such as John Ellison of The Reejers and Chris Mars of The Replacements.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nAlthough Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitates to call himself a \"singer-songwriter\":\n\n''{{quote|\"It's kind of rough being a solo artist.

FIFPro, with its global headquarters in Hoofddorp, Netherlands, is made up of 63 national players' associations. In addition, there are five candidate members and eight observers.<ref name=FIFPro/>\n\n== History ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nOn 15 December 1965, representatives of the French, Scottish, English, Italian and Dutch players' associations met in Paris, with the objective of setting up an international federation for footballers. In the second half of June 1966, the first FIFPro congress took place in London, just before the start of the World Championship. The articles of association of FIFPro were thereby adopted and the objectives accurately laid down. FIFPro was responsible for increasing the solidarity between professional footballers and players' associations. FIFPro tried to offer the players' associations or other interest associations the means for mutual consultation and co-operation to achieve their objectives. In addition, it wished to co-ordinate the activities of the different affiliated groups in order to promote the interests of all professional footballers. Indeed, FIFPro likewise had in mind propagating and defending the rights of professional footballers. The emphasis was thereby laid on the freedom of the football player to be able to choose the club of his choice at the end of his contract. It was likewise laid down that FIFPro would be helpful in every required area for setting up interest associations. These are objectives which still apply to this day.\n\nIt was originally laid down that a congress would be held once every four years at a minimum \u2013 prior to the World Championship. The congress had to uphold the course set out and with a two-third majority vote. The congress is still the most important organ of FIFPro to this very day. It soon appeared that it was necessary to organize a congress annually, and not to limit this to once every four years. Many congresses have been held in the meantime, such as for example in 1978 in Madrid and in 1979 in Athens and Venice. In the eighties and nineties many memorable congresses have been organized in almost all the large European cities, such as Paris, Athens, Milan, Manchester, Z\u00fcrich, Ghent, Lisbon, Edinburgh, Copenhagen, Tel Aviv, Rome, Johannesburg, Barcelona, Santiago and Budapest. The latest congress was in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in November 2010.\n\nThe objectives of FIFPro also mean that not only FIFA applied as a talking partner. UEFA in particular, but also the European parliament and the European Commission appeared to be important points of approach. The national federations also started to become increasingly aware that, in addition to the national players' association, the international trade union FIFPro also played its role.\n\nIn recent years, FIFPro has grown from a European organization into a global network. The FIFPro has done much to support countries on other continents \u2013 Asia/Oceania, Africa and South America \u2013 in their efforts to set up players' associations. In October 2012, FIFPro welcomed the footballers' associations of Croatia, Czech Republic, Montenegro and Ukraine as its newest members.\n\nIn 2013, FIFPro launched a legal challenge against the transfer system.<ref name=\"FIFProOfficial\">{{cite news |url=http://www.fifpro.org/news/news_details/2455 |title=FIFPro announces legal challenge to transfer system |publisher=FIFPro Official Website |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"FIFProTelegraph\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/10523185/Fifpro-to-launch-legal-challenge-against-transfer-system-because-it-shackles-players.html |title=Fifpro to launch legal challenge against transfer system because it 'shackles' players |publisher=The Telegraph |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"FIFProGuardian\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/17/players-union-fifpro-transfer-system-european-courts |title=Players' union Fifpro to take transfer system to European courts |publisher=The Guardian |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"FIFProBBC\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25418135 |title=Football transfer system must change, says world players' union |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref> FIFPro president Phillipe Piat said \"the transfer system fails 99% of players around the world, it fails football as an industry and it fails the world's most beloved game\".

the world to compose the best men's team of the year, named the FIFPro World 11 (also known as the FIFPro World XI). Every player was requested to pick one goalkeeper, four defenders, three midfielders and three forwards.<ref name=Ronaldinho /> In 2009, the world players' union joined hands with [[FIFA]]. While the format remained the same, the award name changed to the '''FIFA FIFPro World11'''. This became the only team award picked by all professional footballers worldwide.\n\nEach year in September, approximately 45,000 voting ballots are sent out to professional footballers' associations that are FIFPro members or candidate members, who are then asked to distribute the forms among all professional footballers in their countries. In October these are returned to FIFPro's head office.

FIFPro, with its global headquarters in Hoofddorp, Netherlands, is made up of 63 national players' associations. In addition, there are five candidate members and eight observers.<ref name=FIFPro/>\n\n== History ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nOn 15 December 1965, representatives of the French, Scottish, English, Italian and Dutch players' associations met in Paris, with the objective of setting up an international federation for footballers. In the second half of June 1966, the first FIFPro congress took place in London, just before the start of the World Championship. The articles of association of FIFPro were thereby adopted and the objectives accurately laid down. FIFPro was responsible for increasing the solidarity between professional footballers and players' associations. FIFPro tried to offer the players' associations or other interest associations the means for mutual consultation and co-operation to achieve their objectives. In addition, it wished to co-ordinate the activities of the different affiliated groups in order to promote the interests of all professional footballers. Indeed, FIFPro likewise had in mind propagating and defending the rights of professional footballers. The emphasis was thereby laid on the freedom of the football player to be able to choose the club of his choice at the end of his contract. It was likewise laid down that FIFPro would be helpful in every required area for setting up interest associations. These are objectives which still apply to this day.\n\nIt was originally laid down that a congress would be held once every four years at a minimum \u2013 prior to the World Championship. The congress had to uphold the course set out and with a two-third majority vote. The congress is still the most important organ of FIFPro to this very day. It soon appeared that it was necessary to organize a congress annually, and not to limit this to once every four years. Many congresses have been held in the meantime, such as for example in 1978 in Madrid and in 1979 in Athens and Venice. In the eighties and nineties many memorable congresses have been organized in almost all the large European cities, such as Paris, Athens, Milan, Manchester, Z\u00fcrich, Ghent, Lisbon, Edinburgh, Copenhagen, Tel Aviv, Rome, Johannesburg, Barcelona, Santiago and Budapest. The latest congress was in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in November 2010.\n\nThe objectives of FIFPro also mean that not only FIFA applied as a talking partner. UEFA in particular, but also the European parliament and the European Commission appeared to be important points of approach. The national federations also started to become increasingly aware that, in addition to the national players' association, the international trade union FIFPro also played its role.\n\nIn recent years, FIFPro has grown from a European organization into a global network. The FIFPro has done much to support countries on other continents \u2013 Asia/Oceania, Africa and South America \u2013 in their efforts to set up players' associations. In October 2012, FIFPro welcomed the footballers' associations of Croatia, Czech Republic, Montenegro and Ukraine as its newest members.\n\nIn 2013, FIFPro launched a legal challenge against the transfer system.<ref name=\"FIFProOfficial\">{{cite news |url=http://www.fifpro.org/news/news_details/2455 |title=FIFPro announces legal challenge to transfer system |publisher=FIFPro Official Website |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"FIFProTelegraph\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/10523185/Fifpro-to-launch-legal-challenge-against-transfer-system-because-it-shackles-players.html |title=Fifpro to launch legal challenge against transfer system because it 'shackles' players |publisher=The Telegraph |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"FIFProGuardian\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/17/players-union-fifpro-transfer-system-european-courts |title=Players' union Fifpro to take transfer system to European courts |publisher=The Guardian |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"FIFProBBC\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25418135 |title=Football transfer system must change, says world players' union |publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 December 2013 |accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref> FIFPro president Phillipe Piat said \"the transfer system fails 99% of players around the world, it fails football as an industry and it fails the world's most beloved game\".

the world to compose the best men's team of the year, named the FIFPro World 11 (also known as the FIFPro World XI). Every player was requested to pick one goalkeeper, four defenders, three midfielders and three forwards.<ref name=Ronaldinho /> In 2009, the world players' union joined hands with [[FIFA]]. While the format remained the same, the award name changed to the '''FIFA FIFPro World11'''. This became the only team award picked by all professional footballers worldwide.\n\nEach year in September, approximately 45,000 voting ballots are sent out to professional footballers' associations that are FIFPro members or candidate members, who are then asked to distribute the forms among all professional footballers in their countries. In October these are returned to FIFPro's head office.

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{in use}}\n{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

Beginning in September 1899 several employees of the DCS&I, which had a policy of not employing unionized members, [[Strike action|struck]] after the company fired workers who had formed the Copper Mine Workers Union, and were subsequently terminated. After the intervention of law enforcement, the strike was settled three months later when the DCS&I reaffirmed their policy of not hiring union members.<ref>Dub\u00e9 2008, p. 4</ref>\n\nThe Tennessee Copper Company eventually merged with the DCS&I, and the merged company began to diversify. Along with copper and sulfuric acid, the company built a [[froth flotation|flotation plant]] to produce [[copper sulfate]] in the 1920s. [[iron ore|Iron]] and [[zinc#production|zinc concentrate]]s were also produced.<ref name=gms /> The DCS&I was reorganized into the Ducktown Chemical and Iron Company (DC&I) in 1925.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 29</ref> In 1936, TCC took over the DC&I, and by this time the cities of Ducktown and Copperhill were mostly [[company town]]s.

The unions fought for control of the entire company, and two subsequent votes held by the [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) failed to resolve the dispute.

In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]].

The speaker will use those terms instead of their English counterpart, either because of cultural affinity, or lack of the appropriate English term.\n\n===Yiddish===\n\nThe Yiddish variant of Yeshivish is questionable as a definition in itself, since the grammar remains identical to that of Yiddish. It may be argued that the Yiddish variant of Yeshivish is a new phenomenon, and consists of less [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] terms and more Aramaic and Rabbinical Hebrew.\n\nYiddish as portrayed in academia concentrates on the secular and cultural variants of Yiddish, and may be attributed to the fact that [[YIVO]], the forerunner of Yiddish as an academic study, was founded by [[secular Jews]] who themselves were unlikely to be educated in Yeshivas and also removed by one or more generations from Yeshiva-educated speakers.\n\nThe \"Yeshivish\" dialect of Yiddish has existed for quite a few centuries among Yeshiva-educated Jews in Eastern and Central Europe. However, as a result of the [[Holocaust]], [[World War II]] and immigration, the secular Yiddish-speaking community is very small, and is far outnumbered by religious Yiddish-speaking communities in [[New York City]], [[Antwerp]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Bnei Brak]], [[Stamford Hill|London]] and others, making the Yeshivish variant the predominant contemporary Yiddish dialect.\n\n===Hebrew===\nThe Yeshivish dialect of [[Hebrew]] consists of occasional [[Ashkenazic]] pronunciation and various [[Yiddishisms]] within [[Modern Hebrew]] spoken among [[Haredi]] communities in [[Israel]]. While many terms from the Talmud and [[Mishna]] exist in Modern Hebrew, their pronunciation is often in line with Modern Hebrew, whereas in the Yeshivish variant, they are pronounced in the traditional Ashkenazic way.\n\nSome Yiddishisms present in Yeshivish Hebrew are not distinct to the Yeshivish dialect and can be found in mainstream Modern Hebrew as well.\n\n==Patterns of usage==\n\nYeshivish is primarily a male spoken dialect.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Talmid Chachams and Tsedeykeses: Language, Learnedness, and Masculinity Among Orthodox Jews |author=Sarah Bunin Benor |journal=Jewish Social Studies |date=Fall 2004 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=147\u2013170 |doi=10.1353/jss.2005.0001}}</ref> Fathers and sons, particularly of teenage years and above, might speak Yeshivish, while mothers and daughters generally speak a milder variety of it, which generally features Yeshivish phonology but excludes many Talmudic words. This can be explained as much of the Yeshivish lexicon is learned in [[Yeshiva|Yeshivot]] where the studying takes place using a specialist nomenclature. Familiarity with these terms develops and they are then re-applied to other situations. There is a higher incidence of Yeshivish being spoken amongst Orthodox Jews that are regularly involved in Torah study, or belong to a community that promotes its study.\n\nCommonly used platitudes amongst Orthodox Jews are frequently expressed with their Yeshivish equivalent. Examples include substituting ''Shkoikh'' for thank you{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}, a contraction from the Hebrew {{Hebrew|\u05d9\u05b4\u05d9\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05e8 \u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05d7\u05b7\u05da\u05b8}} [\"Yashar Koach\"] which literally translates as \"May your strength be firm\" and is used to indicate to someone that they have done a good job, and ''Baruch Hashem'' (sometimes written as B\"H, using the quotation mark used for abbreviations in Hebrew) meaning \"Blessed is [[HaShem|The Name]] [of God]\". Yeshivish dialogue may include many expressions that refer to [[HaShem]] (\"The Name\" - a reference to God).\n\nSome observers predict that the English variant of Yeshivish may develop further to the point that it could become one of the historical Judeo-hybrid languages like Yiddish, [[Ladino language|Ladino]] or [[Judeo-Arabic]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The Judeo-hybrid languages were spoken dialects which mixed elements of the local vernacular, Hebrew, Aramaic and Jewish religious idioms. As Yiddish was to [[Middle High German]], Yeshivish may be to Standard American English. However, the integration of modern-day Jews with non-Jews may keep their speech from diverging as far from the standard language as it did in the past.\n\n==Distinct features==\n\n===Vocabulary===\n{{Original research section|date=June 2013}} \nThe vocabulary and grammatical structure of Yeshivish are drawn primarily from the speaker's native language (see above), although the vocabulary includes scholarly jargon, primarily from the Talmud and [[Acharonim]] in Yiddish, Hebrew, and Aramaic. In many sentences, however, the grammatical and lexical features of the speaker's native language are slight and sometimes even lacking altogether.\n\nA distinguishing feature of Yeshivish is that its speakers knowingly apply highly technical and literal written language to a colloquial language and in common day usage, similar to [[Modern Hebrew]], for example:\n\n<blockquote>He was ''goirem'' a ''ssach'' ''nezek'', but ''basoif'' was ''moideh b'miktzas'' and ''tayned'' he was ''shoigeg''</blockquote>\n\n''Goirem'' means to cause.\n\n''Tayned'' means to claim.\n\n''Ssach'' means \"a lot\" (in Yiddish).\n\n''Nezek'' in its original context refers to the Talmudic notion of [[tort]] law.\n\n''Basoif'' means \"eventually\" (more precisely, \"at the end\").\n\n''Moideh b'miktzas'' refers to partial confession of a defendant.\n\nAnd ''shoigeg'' in its original context means an incident which was caused unwillingly, but was a result of partial negligence.\n\nDespite its heavy borrowing of technical and legal terms, the above sentence would be understood clearly by speakers of Yeshivish as \"He did a lot of damage, and eventually admitted that he did it, although he claimed it was inadvertent.\"\n\nNote in the above example that ''shoigeg'' does not have the same meaning in Yeshivish as it does in its original context, wherein it implies negligence. ''Oines'' would be the correct technical term.\n\n===Phonology===\n{{IPA notice|section}}\nThe Yeshivish [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]] has similarities to various accents of Eastern European and New York backgrounds. One notable feature of Yeshivish is the frequency of occurrence of the phoneme [x], common in many words of Hebrew, Aramaic, and Yiddish origin.\n\n/t/ may be released when in general American it would be flapped or unreleased. Final stops may devoice and pre-nasal /\u00e6/ may not raise.\n\n===Discourse and prosody===\nYeshivish may use a \"chanting intonation\" for reading and discussing Jewish texts. A number of other distinctive intonations are also used: for instance, a high-falling pitch boundary for a dramatic point.\n\nA hesitation click is used, borrowed from [[Israeli Hebrew]]:\n: ''But sometimes it's more\u2014[click] I don't know how to explain it.''\nThe \"click\" is often vocalized as \"tsk.\"\n\nYeshivish has some unique [[interjection]]s. For instance ''Oh!'', ''Ooh-aah!'' and ''Psshhhh!'' may be used as praise markers. Extensive hand motions, in particular thumb dipping in the style of talmudic discourse as well as the \"fist twist,\" which is a closed fist raised at or above eye level and twisted back and forth to indicate uncertainty or doubt, are common.\n\n===Grammar===\n\n====Morphology====\nLoan words are often given plurals using standard English morphology. For instance, the plural of ''yeshiva'' is ''yeshivas'' rather than ''yeshivois'' as in [[Ashkenazi Hebrew]] (although this is similar to the plural form in Yiddish). Hebrew nouns ending in ''-us'' are pluralized with the suffix ''-in'' rather than replacing ''-us'' with ''-uyois'' as in Ashkenazi Hebrew, e.g. ''shlichus > shlichusin'' 'mission' and ''mashmaus > mashmausin'' 'implication'. This likely comes from the Yiddish plural marker ''-n'' although it could also have derived from Aramaic ''-in''.\n\nLoan verbs may also conjugate with standard English patterns. For example, Yiddish derived ''daven'' 'pray' may become ''davening'' or ''davened'', e.g. \"I already davened [[mincha]].\" and \"Quiet, I'm davening.\"\n\n====Syntax and semantics====\nSome verbs, particularly those of Hebrew origin, are often treated as participles, and inflected by English auxiliary verbs, in the same way that [[periphrastic]] verbs are constructed in Yiddish. For example:\n\n:''He was moideh that he was wrong.''\n::'He admitted that he was wrong.'\n::''He was'' puts ''moideh''&nbsp;\u2013 \"to admit\"&nbsp;\u2013 into the third-person singular past tense\n:''We'll always be soimech on Rav Plony's p'sak that the eruv is kosher.''\n::'We'll always rely upon Rabbi So-and-So's ruling that the [[eruv]] is usable.'\n::''We'll always be'' puts ''soimech''&nbsp;\u2013 'to rely'&nbsp;\u2013 into the first-person plural future tense\n\nThere are a number of [[phrasal verb]]s calqued from Yiddish, for instance ''bring down'' and ''tell over'' 'recount, retell (a story)'.\n\nModals may be used differently than in standard English, e.g. ''I want that you should get her number''.\n\nThere are a number of differences between the use of prepositions in Yeshivish and standard English:\n\nThe preposition ''by'' has a wide array of meanings in Yeshivish:\n:''Are you eating by Rabbi Fischer?'' (at the house of)\n:''By [[Chabad]], it's different.'' (with, among)\n\nA possible cause for this is that the Yiddish [[preposition]] \"''bei''\" is defined as at, beside or by. The similar-sounding English preposition ''by'' has come to encompass these meanings.\n\nPrepositions are often dropped:\n:''Her bus gets in 10:15.''\n:''I'm already frum [religious] 20 years.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hebraization of English]]\n* [[Klezmer-loshn]]\n* [[Yeshiva]]\n* [[Yiddish words used in English]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110629142106/http://www.ling.upenn.edu/NWAVE32/abs-pdf/benor.pdf Yeshivish, the language of Talmud Study]\n* {{cite web |url=http://zackarysholemberger.blogspot.com/2004/04/how-to-speak-yeshivish-friend-of-mine.html |publisher=Zackary Sholem Berger |date=15 April 2004 |title=How to Speak Yeshivish}}\n* {{cite book |last=Weiser |first=Chaim M. |year=1995 |title=Frumspeak: The first dictionary of Yeshivish |location=Northvale |publisher=Aronson |isbn=978-1-56821-614-0}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.dafyomi.org/ DafYomi.org], with extensive lectures on Talmud in Yeshivish English\n\n{{Jewish languages}}\n{{English dialects by continent}}\n\n[[Category:Judeo-English languages| ]]\n[[Category:Orthodox Judaism]]\n[[Category:Yiddish language]]\n[[Category:Yiddish words and phrases]]\n[[Category:English dialects]]\n[[Category:Language varieties and styles]]\n[[Category:Sociolinguistics]]\n[[Category:Macaronic language]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|sociolect of English as spoken by Orthodox Jews in Yeshiva}}\n{{Use American English|date = April 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n'''Yeshivish''' or '''Yeshevesh''' ({{Lang-yi|\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d9\u05e9}}), also known as '''Yeshiva English''' or '''Yeshivisheh Shprach''', is a [[sociolect]] of [[English language|English]] spoken by [[Yeshiva]] students and other [[Jew]]s with a strong connection to the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Yeshiva world.\n\n\"Yeshivish\" may also refer to non-Hasidic Haredi Jews.

While many terms from the Talmud and [[Mishna]] exist in Modern Hebrew, their pronunciation is often in line with Modern Hebrew, whereas in the Yeshivish variant, they are pronounced in the traditional Ashkenazic way.\n\nSome Yiddishisms present in Yeshivish Hebrew are not distinct to the Yeshivish dialect and can be found in mainstream Modern Hebrew as well.\n\n==Patterns of usage==\n\nYeshivish is primarily a male spoken dialect.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Talmid Chachams and Tsedeykeses: Language, Learnedness, and Masculinity Among Orthodox Jews |author=Sarah Bunin Benor |journal=Jewish Social Studies |date=Fall 2004 |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=147\u2013170 |doi=10.1353/jss.2005.0001}}</ref> Fathers and sons, particularly of teenage years and above, might speak Yeshivish, while mothers and daughters generally speak a milder variety of it, which generally features Yeshivish phonology but excludes many Talmudic words. This can be explained as much of the Yeshivish lexicon is learned in [[Yeshiva|Yeshivot]] where the studying takes place using a specialist nomenclature. Familiarity with these terms develops and they are then re-applied to other situations. There is a higher incidence of Yeshivish being spoken amongst Orthodox Jews that are regularly involved in Torah study, or belong to a community that promotes its study.\n\nCommonly used platitudes amongst Orthodox Jews are frequently expressed with their Yeshivish equivalent. Examples include substituting ''Shkoikh'' for thank you{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}, a contraction from the Hebrew {{Hebrew|\u05d9\u05b4\u05d9\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05e8 \u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05d7\u05b7\u05da\u05b8}} [\"Yashar Koach\"] which literally translates as \"May your strength be firm\" and is used to indicate to someone that they have done a good job, and ''Baruch Hashem'' (sometimes written as B\"H, using the quotation mark used for abbreviations in Hebrew) meaning \"Blessed is [[HaShem|The Name]] [of God]\". Yeshivish dialogue may include many expressions that refer to [[HaShem]] (\"The Name\" - a reference to God).\n\nSome observers predict that the English variant of Yeshivish may develop further to the point that it could become one of the historical Judeo-hybrid languages like Yiddish, [[Ladino language|Ladino]] or [[Judeo-Arabic]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The Judeo-hybrid languages were spoken dialects which mixed elements of the local vernacular, Hebrew, Aramaic and Jewish religious idioms. As Yiddish was to [[Middle High German]], Yeshivish may be to Standard American English. However, the integration of modern-day Jews with non-Jews may keep their speech from diverging as far from the standard language as it did in the past.\n\n==Distinct features==\n\n===Vocabulary===\n{{Original research section|date=June 2013}} \nThe vocabulary and grammatical structure of Yeshivish are drawn primarily from the speaker's native language (see above), although the vocabulary includes scholarly jargon, primarily from the Talmud and [[Acharonim]] in Yiddish, Hebrew, and Aramaic. In many sentences, however, the grammatical and lexical features of the speaker's native language are slight and sometimes even lacking altogether.\n\nA distinguishing feature of Yeshivish is that its speakers knowingly apply highly technical and literal written language to a colloquial language and in common day usage, similar to [[Modern Hebrew]], for example:\n\n<blockquote>He was ''goirem'' a ''ssach'' ''nezek'', but ''basoif'' was ''moideh b'miktzas'' and ''tayned'' he was ''shoigeg''</blockquote>\n\n''Goirem'' means to cause.\n\n''Tayned'' means to claim.\n\n''Ssach'' means \"a lot\" (in Yiddish).\n\n''Nezek'' in its original context refers to the Talmudic notion of [[tort]] law.\n\n''Basoif'' means \"eventually\" (more precisely, \"at the end\").\n\n''Moideh b'miktzas'' refers to partial confession of a defendant.\n\nAnd ''shoigeg'' in its original context means an incident which was caused unwillingly, but was a result of partial negligence.\n\nDespite its heavy borrowing of technical and legal terms, the above sentence would be understood clearly by speakers of Yeshivish as \"He did a lot of damage, and eventually admitted that he did it, although he claimed it was inadvertent.\"\n\nNote in the above example that ''shoigeg'' does not have the same meaning in Yeshivish as it does in its original context, wherein it implies negligence. ''Oines'' would be the correct technical term.\n\n===Phonology===\n{{IPA notice|section}}\nThe Yeshivish [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]] has similarities to various accents of Eastern European and New York backgrounds. One notable feature of Yeshivish is the frequency of occurrence of the phoneme [x], common in many words of Hebrew, Aramaic, and Yiddish origin.\n\n/t/ may be released when in general American it would be flapped or unreleased. Final stops may devoice and pre-nasal /\u00e6/ may not raise.\n\n===Discourse and prosody===\nYeshivish may use a \"chanting intonation\" for reading and discussing Jewish texts. A number of other distinctive intonations are also used: for instance, a high-falling pitch boundary for a dramatic point.\n\nA hesitation click is used, borrowed from [[Israeli Hebrew]]:\n: ''But sometimes it's more\u2014[click] I don't know how to explain it.''\nThe \"click\" is often vocalized as \"tsk.\"\n\nYeshivish has some unique [[interjection]]s. For instance ''Oh!'', ''Ooh-aah!'' and ''Psshhhh!'' may be used as praise markers. Extensive hand motions, in particular thumb dipping in the style of talmudic discourse as well as the \"fist twist,\" which is a closed fist raised at or above eye level and twisted back and forth to indicate uncertainty or doubt, are common.\n\n===Grammar===\n\n====Morphology====\nLoan words are often given plurals using standard English morphology. For instance, the plural of ''yeshiva'' is ''yeshivas'' rather than ''yeshivois'' as in [[Ashkenazi Hebrew]] (although this is similar to the plural form in Yiddish). Hebrew nouns ending in ''-us'' are pluralized with the suffix ''-in'' rather than replacing ''-us'' with ''-uyois'' as in Ashkenazi Hebrew, e.g. ''shlichus > shlichusin'' 'mission' and ''mashmaus > mashmausin'' 'implication'. This likely comes from the Yiddish plural marker ''-n'' although it could also have derived from Aramaic ''-in''.\n\nLoan verbs may also conjugate with standard English patterns. For example, Yiddish derived ''daven'' 'pray' may become ''davening'' or ''davened'', e.g. \"I already davened [[mincha]].\" and \"Quiet, I'm davening.\"\n\n====Syntax and semantics====\nSome verbs, particularly those of Hebrew origin, are often treated as participles, and inflected by English auxiliary verbs, in the same way that [[periphrastic]] verbs are constructed in Yiddish. For example:\n\n:''He was moideh that he was wrong.''\n::'He admitted that he was wrong.'\n::''He was'' puts ''moideh''&nbsp;\u2013 \"to admit\"&nbsp;\u2013 into the third-person singular past tense\n:''We'll always be soimech on Rav Plony's p'sak that the eruv is kosher.''\n::'We'll always rely upon Rabbi So-and-So's ruling that the [[eruv]] is usable.'\n::''We'll always be'' puts ''soimech''&nbsp;\u2013 'to rely'&nbsp;\u2013 into the first-person plural future tense\n\nThere are a number of [[phrasal verb]]s calqued from Yiddish, for instance ''bring down'' and ''tell over'' 'recount, retell (a story)'.\n\nModals may be used differently than in standard English, e.g. ''I want that you should get her number''.\n\nThere are a number of differences between the use of prepositions in Yeshivish and standard English:\n\nThe preposition ''by'' has a wide array of meanings in Yeshivish:\n:''Are you eating by Rabbi Fischer?'' (at the house of)\n:''By [[Chabad]], it's different.'' (with, among)\n\nA possible cause for this is that the Yiddish [[preposition]] \"''bei''\" is defined as at, beside or by. The similar-sounding English preposition ''by'' has come to encompass these meanings.\n\nPrepositions are often dropped:\n:''Her bus gets in 10:15.''\n:''I'm already frum [religious] 20 years.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hebraization of English]]\n* [[Klezmer-loshn]]\n* [[Yeshiva]]\n* [[Yiddish words used in English]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110629142106/http://www.ling.upenn.edu/NWAVE32/abs-pdf/benor.pdf Yeshivish, the language of Talmud Study]\n* {{cite web |url=http://zackarysholemberger.blogspot.com/2004/04/how-to-speak-yeshivish-friend-of-mine.html |publisher=Zackary Sholem Berger |date=15 April 2004 |title=How to Speak Yeshivish}}\n* {{cite book |last=Weiser |first=Chaim M. |year=1995 |title=Frumspeak: The first dictionary of Yeshivish |location=Northvale |publisher=Aronson |isbn=978-1-56821-614-0}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.dafyomi.org/ DafYomi.org], with extensive lectures on Talmud in Yeshivish English\n\n{{Jewish languages}}\n{{English dialects by continent}}\n\n[[Category:Judeo-English languages| ]]\n[[Category:Orthodox Judaism]]\n[[Category:Yiddish language]]\n[[Category:Yiddish words and phrases]]\n[[Category:English dialects]]\n[[Category:Language varieties and styles]]\n[[Category:Sociolinguistics]]\n[[Category:Macaronic language]]\n", "name_user": "SamsonKriger", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added relevant links.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshivish"}
