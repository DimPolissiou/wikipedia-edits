At all his stores, Chong bought milk from local farmers which he would process at his butter factory, located just outside of Eltham, from 1887. The factory was judged by the Government's dairy inspector as the best he had seen. In 1888, Chong was credited with installing the first refrigeration unit at a New Zealand butter factory. He has thus been described as a \"pioneer\" and \u201cthe originator of the dairy factory system\u201d. <ref>https://www.nzgeo.com/stories/chew-chong/</ref>\n\n==Later life== \nAfter his retirement, Chong returned to China for 6 months in 1905. When he returned to New Zealand, he took up various hobbies including entertaining children. \n\nHe is the grandfather of [[Taranaki]] cartoonist Brian Chong and great-grandfather to [[New Plymouth District]] Councilor and 2017 [[New Zealand First]] candidate Murray Chong.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2017}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chong, Chew}}\n[[Category:1840s births]]\n[[Category:1920 deaths]]\n[[Category:Chinese emigrants to New Zealand]]\n[[Category:New Zealand businesspeople]]\n\n\n{{NewZealand-business-bio-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Onco p53", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up, replaced: Hawera \u2192 H\u0101wera as perWikipedia:Naming_conventions_(New_Zealand)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chew_Chong"}
