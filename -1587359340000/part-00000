In 1897, two additional cars were purchased.  A year later, to generate additional revenues, the company started a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\nIn 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company''.  In 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters, powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.   \n\nIn 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  There were three wires weighed down and covered with ice.  Two of the three wires were dangerously close to each other, until a Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  This permitted [[Ontario Hydro]], with its local hydroelectric power generating station, to provide Cornwall Electric and Cornwall residents, with enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the 1998 ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.  In 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to always maintain a minimum balance of CA$25 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|title=City put $25M Progress Fund in jeopardy: auditor \u2013 Cornwall Newswatch|website=www.cornwallnewswatch.com|date=May 7, 2019|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>  Originally, the fund was also setup to only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.

The cost of the project was CA$3 million.  The cost of financing the project would be recouped from energy savings and  lower maintenance fees.  The city also announced that it would be switching its street traffic lights to LED at a rate of two intersections per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallseawaynews.com/2016/04/11/5000-city-street-lights-being-replaced-with-led/|title=5,000 city street lights being replaced with LED|date=2016-04-11|website=Cornwall Seaway News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> In 2017, [[Hydro One]] converted the Township of Glengarry to LED bulbs at a cost of CA$226 thousand, yielding a cost savings of sixty-nine percent, and collecting CA$259 thousand in savings in the first three years.\n\n=== Controversy ===\nIn 2019 the Township of Glengarry wanted Cornwall Electric to convert its sub-division of Glen Walter to LED lighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/03/12/glen-walter-held-hostage-to-old-streetlights/|title=Glen Walter held hostage to old streetlights|last=Editor|date=2019-03-12|website=Cornwall Newswatch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> At a special council meeting on 24 January 2020, Councillor Sam McDonell raised the idea of not paying its electricity bill, as a way to bring Cornwall Electric to the table to discuss the matter. In an email published in the [[Cornwall Seaway News]], the councillor stated: \"''The big issue is this is a real savings that once we have transferred maintenance and future replacement cost to reserves we can then pass that savings along to rate payers, who in fact have these lights worked into their property taxes.

Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  There were three wires weighed down and covered with ice.  Two of the three wires were dangerously close to each other, until a Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  For the first time, this permitted [[Ontario Hydro]], with its local hydroelectric power generating station, to provide Cornwall Electric and Cornwall residents, with enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the 1998 ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.  In 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to always maintain a minimum balance of CA$25 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|title=City put $25M Progress Fund in jeopardy: auditor \u2013 Cornwall Newswatch|website=www.cornwallnewswatch.com|date=May 7, 2019|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>  Originally, the fund was also setup to only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.  Over the years, interest generated by the fund has been used in part for the redevelopment of the Hotel Dieu Hospital, the establishment of a [[hospice]], the building of an aquatic centre, and to pay the mortgage on the city's new sports complex, the Benson Centre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/09/24/cornwall-hit-sweet-spot-in-98-sale-of-cornwall-electric/|title=Cornwall hit \u2018sweet spot\u2019 in \u201998 sale of Cornwall Electric|last=Editor|date=2019-09-24|website=Cornwall Newswatch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Fortis Inc. ===\nIn May 2002, [[Enbridge|Enbridge Energy Distribution Inc.]] announced that it had agreed to sell ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' to Fortic Inc. in a cash deal worth CA$67 million. Both the Canadian [[Competition Bureau (Canada)|Competition Bureau]] and the Ontario Energy Board approved the sale which Fortis Inc. concluded on October 18, 2002.\u00a0 Fortis Inc. which has its roots in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John Newfoundland]], is an international company which operates Cornwall Electric under its Ontario subsidiary, Fortis Ontario Inc.\n\n=== LED lighting ===\nIn 2016, after an initial test run in certain areas, the City of Cornwall which still owns the utility poles and lights, contracted crews to convert approximate 5,000 street lamps that were using the older [[Sodium-vapor lamp|sodium-vapour lamps]] which typically lasted six years, to the more energy efficient [[LED lamp|LED bulbs]] that could last as long as twenty years.  The cost of the project was CA$3 million which along with its financing would be recouped from the energy savings in switching to LED coupled with a lower maintenance cost.  The city also announced that it would be switching its street traffic lights to LED at a rate of two intersections per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallseawaynews.com/2016/04/11/5000-city-street-lights-being-replaced-with-led/|title=5,000 city street lights being replaced with LED|date=2016-04-11|website=Cornwall Seaway News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> In 2017, [[Hydro One]] converted the Township of Glengarry to LED bulbs at a cost of CA$226 thousand, yielding a cost savings of sixty-nine percent, and collecting CA$259 thousand in savings in the first three years.\n\n=== Controversy ===\nIn 2019 the Township of Glengarry wanted Cornwall Electric to convert its sub-division of Glen Walter to LED lighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/03/12/glen-walter-held-hostage-to-old-streetlights/|title=Glen Walter held hostage to old streetlights|last=Editor|date=2019-03-12|website=Cornwall Newswatch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> At a special council meeting on January 24 2020, Councillor Sam McDonell raised the idea of not paying its electricity bill, as a way to bring Cornwall Electric to the table to discuss the matter. In an email published in the [[Cornwall Seaway News]], the councillor stated: \"''The big issue is this is a real savings that once we have transferred maintenance and future replacement cost to reserves we can then pass that savings along to rate payers, who in fact have these lights worked into their property taxes. It\u2019s a true savings we miss out on every month we pay the bill and Cornwall Electric doesn\u2019t come to the table''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallseawaynews.com/2020/01/27/sg-council-considers-not-paying-cornwall-electric-bill/|title=SG Council considers not paying Cornwall Electric bill|date=2020-01-27|website=Cornwall Seaway News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Cornwall Canal]]\n*[[Cornwall, Ontario]]\n*[[Cornwall station]]\n* [[Cornwall Street Railway]]\n* [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]]\n*[[R.

{"title_page": "Skull Island", "text_new": "{{about|the fictional Skull Island of King Kong}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{Cleanup|date=March 2011}}\n{{Refimprove|date=April 2010}}\n}}\n[[File:Skull.Island.jpg|thumb|right|The Map of Skull Island as seen in the 1933 ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' film.]]\n'''Skull Island''' is the name most often used to describe a [[fiction]]al [[island]] that first appeared in the [[1933 in film|1933]] film ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' and later appearing in its sequels, the two remakes, and any other King Kong-based media. It is the home of the eponymous [[King Kong]] and several other species of creatures, mostly prehistoric and in some cases species that should have been extinct long before the rise of mammalian creatures, along with a primitive society of humans.\n\nIn the 1962 film ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]'' and the 1967 film ''[[King Kong Escapes]]'', the comparable islands are called \"Farou Island\" and \"Mondo Island\", respectively. Kong plays a similar role in these islands as the god-like being of the land, a role he plays in all versions of the King Kong story. Skull Island's origins are unknown, but Kong appears to be the only giant gorilla known to exist on the island. However, the [[King Kong (2005 film)|2005 remake]] shows other skeletons of Kong-sized gorillas, indicating that there was once a group of such creatures of an unknown number living on the island. Additionally, 2017's ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'' depicts the skeletons of Kong's parents.\n\n==History==\n\n===Appearance in the 1933 films===\nIn ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', the island is never mentioned by name and is located at approximately {{Coord|12|S|78|E}}&nbsp;\u2013 somewhere off the coast of [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]]. There is a distinctive rocky [[hillock|knoll]] in the center of the island that is shaped like a [[human skull]], which is referred to as \"Skull Mountain\".\n\nAccording to the first movie, the captain of a Norwegian barque discovered a canoe blown off course with only one native left alive.  Before the native died, the captain of the barque was able to get a rough location of the island and some details on it, including its most distinctive feature - a huge wall built by the ancestors of the natives back when they had high civilization.  When the protagonists of the picture arrive at the island and examine it they find,\nin addition to the expected superstitious natives, [[Prehistoric life|prehistoric creatures]] of all sorts and one extremely large [[ape]], known by those on the island as \"[[King Kong|Kong]]\".\n\nOther then being the descendants of a high civilization, the ancestry of the [[Indigenous peoples|natives]] is never really explained, although the setting suggests they are a [[Southeast Asia]]n group.\n\nIn the sequel film ''[[Son of Kong|The Son of Kong]]'', Carl Denham returns to Skull Island when there was a mention of some treasure that was hidden there. He also encounters a large white gorilla who is the son of King Kong. Skull Island sinks into the sea during a powerful earthquake. Kong's son drowns while holding Carl Denham above the water. Denham survives unscathed, while the treasure is claimed by him and the other three survivors.\n\nThe term \"Skull Island\" is never used in the original films. In ''King Kong'', only \"Skull Mountain\" is named, while in the sequel ''[[Son of Kong]]'', its simply referred to as \"Kong's island\". In the novelization of ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' by Delos Lovelace, it is called \"Skull Mountain Island\". But RKO referred to it as \"Skull Island\" in some of their publicity materials.\n\n===1976 remake===\nIn the 1976's ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]'', Skull Island is mentioned as being \"the beach of the skull.\" It is located somewhere in [[Indian Ocean]] south of [[Java]], covered by a permanent cloud bank. Various people are said to have visited the island through the centuries but returned with no clear proof. By the 1970s, it is an urban legend whose only evidence is in government secret files. It is also revealed to have a huge deposit of oil, which led a greedy oil company executive to go in search of it. Besides featuring a primitive native tribe (most seem to be of West African ancestry) and the giant, [[bipedal]] gorilla Kong, there is also a giant snake who appeared in Kong's lair and wanted to kill him and Dwan, but it was killed by the former.\n\nIn 1986 sequel film ''[[King Kong Lives]]'', Skull Island does not appear but it was mentioned by adventurer Hank Mitchell (mistakenly calling it Kong Island) who believed that the islands Borneo and Skull Island were once a part of the same landmass in the past. The fate of this incarnation is unknown.\n\n===''Kong: The Animated Series''===\nIn ''[[Kong: The Animated Series]]'', the island was named '''Kong Island'''. Unlike previous incarnations, Kong Island was situated in the infamous [[Bermuda Triangle]], not the Indian Ocean. Although various prehistoric creatures are seen living there, Kong Island also contains some ruins where one of them serves as the prison of the demon Chiros.\n\nIt is also where Jason Jenkins and his grandmother Dr. Lorna Jenkins also live along with Jason's friend Tan. Another human inhabitant is Lua, the sole survivor of the native people of the island and a female shaman.\n\n===''Kong: King of Skull Island''===\n\nA 2004 illustrated novel that serves as both prequel and sequel of the original \"King Kong\" story, conceived by Merian C. Cooper and novelized by Delos Lovelace in 1932, and authorized by the Cooper family. \n \nCreated and Illustrated by Joe DeVito [and novelized by Brad Strickland and DeVito, with John Michlig] ''Kong: King of Skull Island'' depicts a Skull Island far larger than originally thought. It is either the last vestige of a volatile volcanic series of islands or the remnant of a larger landmass. Skull Island is located in the Indian Ocean, west of [[Sumatra]], and has several much smaller islands in various locations around its perimeter, with the most prevalent of these off a small peninsula on its southeastern corner.\n \nSkull Island contains two main mountains, the larger being shaped in the visage of a human skull. Skull Mountain is riddled with caves and passageways carved out by natural erosion, but also man-made. In earlier times, these were often used by islanders to avoid the monsters on the surface, but proved to have a multitude of dangerous denizens of their own. These include previously unknown species such as snake-like amphibians with enormous heads capable of swallowing a human whole; foot-long creatures that combine squid and crustacean characteristics with bio-luminescent sails tipped with poisonous stingers; giant spiders with 7-foot bodies and 8-foot-long legs ending in hand-like appendages. \n \nThe human civilization that inhabits Skull Island at least through the 20th century is the last remnant of a previously unknown super-race called the Tagatu (a combination of two formerly separate tribes: the Tagu and the Atu). The original culture is believed to have Asian origins that bled into an island group west of Sumatra that no longer exists. As a result of a natural disaster, they were forced to migrate to Skull Island untold millennia ago. Drawn to its spectacular makeup by their insatiable curiosity, the Tagatu believed their mastery of biological and organic sciences could overcome Skull Island's dangers. It was they who originally brought the gigantic simian Kongs there for protection and who, with the help of the Kongs, built the iconic wall across the Skull Island\u2019s peninsula for protections against Skull Island\u2019s prehistoric denizens.\n \nAmong the many mysteries revealed in the work is the reality that on Skull Island the dinosaurs never died out, but continued to evolve over the intervening 65 million years. This has resulted in strange variations on previously known species, as well as many new ones. Chief among the latter is a race of sentient dinosaurs, called Deathrunners. Bipedal, extremely aggressive and 6 to 9 feet tall, they once ruled the island and were at war with the Tagatu and the Kongs. Their race is propagated every few generations by one queen that grows to gigantic size. It is one of these, called \u201cGaw\u201d, that ruled Skull Island when King Kong was born and who Kong had to defeat in order to become a king.\n \nIn the story, Carl Denham's son, Vincent (now a paleontologist), and an older Jack Driscoll return to Skull Island in 1957 to discover pieces of the earlier civilization\u2019s history and relationship to the island through an enigmatic Tagatu elder simply called the \u201cStoryteller\u201d, as well as in the form of archaeological discoveries such as specially pigmented paintings in underground passageways that move when illuminated by torchlight to reveal past events on Skull Island. Primary among these is the discovery of remnants of \u201cthe Old City\u201d, which was established by the Tagatu at the zenith of their civilization in the center of the island in an ideal valley between the two mountains. The Storyteller's tale, along with Vincent and Driscoll's findings, suggest that the eerie skull visage that gave the island its name may have been the work of human hands. These and other discoveries hint that the true extent of Skull Island\u2019s secrets have yet to be revealed.\n\n===2005 remake===\nIn Peter Jackson's remake, Skull Island's position west of [[Sumatra]] remains the same, in a region afflicted by magnetic anomalies and violent sea storms. According to the book ''[[The World of Kong: A Natural History of Skull Island]]'', Skull Island was geologically unstable and has been slowly sinking into the sea for the past thousand years. By 1933, the island was on the verge of destruction. Fifteen years after its discovery to the modern world, Skull Island finally sank into the ocean.\n\nIn its prehistory, Skull Island was a refuge for a variety of prehistoric creatures. Over time, more and more species arrived either by swimming, flying, rafting, or migrating through temporary [[land bridge]]s. As the island slowly receded into the sea, life was forced to adapt, resulting in an ecosystem of bizarre and nightmarish creatures.\n\nThree thousand years before, an advanced civilization from [[Southeast Asia]] migrated to Skull Island, bringing with them domesticated animals such as [[Gaur]] and the giant ancestors of Kong. This culture eventually died off, leaving behind only gigantic eroding ruins scattered around the island (such as the enormous wall) and a small society of primitive people that became the Skull Island natives.\n\n===Altus Press===\nTo coincide with the 80th anniversary of both characters, [[Altus Press]] announced on January 29, 2013, that King Kong would meet pulp hero [[Doc Savage]] in a new, officially sanctioned book written by [[Will Murray (writer)|Will Murray]] and artist Joe DeVito, who will also do the cover artwork. Set in 1920, shortly after returning from military service during [[World War I]], Doc Savage searches for his long-lost grandfather (the legendary mariner [[List_of_Doc_Savage_characters#Stormolong_Savage|Stormalong Savage]]) with his father, the explorer [[List_of_Doc_Savage_characters#Clark_Savage.2C_Sr.|Clark Savage, Sr.]], that ultimately leads father and son to the mysterious Skull Island and its prehistoric denizens, including King Kong.

The island is located in the South Pacific and sits in the eye of a massive swirling storm system that has enabled its concealment from the outside world. The island is situated atop an entrance to the [[Hollow Earth]], which is home to large, two-legged lizard-like predators that have come to be known as \"Skullcrawlers\" that are referred to as the island's \"devils\". The Skullcrawlers wiped out King Kong's family, making him the last of his kind.\n\nThere is also evidence of dinosaurs living, or having lived, on the island, in the form of a ''[[Triceratops]]'' skull found in the \"graveyard\" of the island. A number of other species are referred to as \"florafauna\" for displaying physiological traits of plants. Similar to previous incarnations, there is a human native tribe present (characterized as [[Iwi]]s) who are much less hostile than in previous versions, mainly because a stranded air pilot from [[World War II]] named Hank Marlow makes peace between them and modern-day humans. The film sees an expedition in 1973 landing upon the island after Skull Island is detected by [[Landsat]].\n\nDuring the credits of ''[[Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019 film)|Godzilla: King of the Monsters]]'', a newspaper clipping states that the awakened Titans are beginning to converge on Skull Island, which is starting to become unstable. It is also revealed in the film that Monarch has an outpost on Skull Island.<ref>https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2474440/you-need-to-see-kong-skull-island-to-fully-appreciate-godzilla-king-of-the-monsters</ref>\n\n==Island wildlife==\n===''King Kong'' and ''The Son of Kong''===\n[[File:T. rex old posture.jpg|thumb|Charles R. Knight's ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' in the American Museum of Natural History, which the large [[Theropoda|theropod]] of the film was based on]]\n* '''''[[Stegosaurus]]''''' \u2013 Appears in a sequence in which it is disturbed by Carl Denham's crew. It charges the men and they fell it with a gas bomb. As they walk by, it starts to get up again and is shot. Orville Goldner, who worked on the film, described the film's [[Stegosauria|stegosaur]] as a combination of two [[Genus|genera]]: ''[[Stegosaurus]]'' and the less well-known ''[[Kentrosaurus]]''.<ref name=Goldner>Orville Goldner, George E Turner (1975).

See also ''Spawn of Skull Island'' (2002). {{ISBN|1-887664-45-9}}</ref> Another one appeared in a deleted scene when Denham ran back to the village, after Kong\u2019s battle with the ''[[T-rex]]''.\n* '''''[[Brontosaurus]]''''' - Appears in a sequence where Carl Denham's Crew builds a raft to cross a large lake in their pursuit of Kong. The Brontosaurus attacks the raft and eats several crew members in the water and on land. Though known as a Herbivore before this movie, the film makers may have opted to have the plant-eater devour people to create more shocking violence for the audience. \n* A large two-legged [[lizard]] \u2013 This [[Reptile|reptilian]] creature climbs up a vine from the [[crevasse]] to attack [[Jack Driscoll]]. It falls back into the pit when Jack cuts the vine that it is climbing. Other than the two limbs, the other distinct feature of this creature is the [[iguana]]-like ridge of spikes down its back. Orville Goldner said it was loosely based on the features of the ''[[Desmatosuchus]]''.<ref name=Goldner/>\n\n* '''''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''''' \u2013 The [[dinosaur]] was modeled after [[Charles R. Knight]]'s depiction of a ''Tyrannosaurus''.<ref name=Goldner/> However, it possesses three fingers per hand, unlike ''Tyrannosaurus'' which had only two (however, the number of fingers in ''Tyrannosaurus'' was disputed at the time, as a complete ''manus'' was not discovered until the mid-1990s). In the documentary ''I'm King Kong! The Exploits of Merian C. Cooper'', included on the two-disc DVD release of ''King Kong'', Cooper refers to this beast as an ''[[Allosaurus]]'', not a ''Tyrannosaurus'', which would help explain the number of fingers. However, the creature was originally intended to be a ''Tyrannosaurus'' designed for the cancelled [[Willis O'Brien]] film ''[[Creation (unfinished film)|Creation]]'' (1931). It may also be worth noting that the ''Tyrannosaurus'' present in Willis O'Brien's earlier project ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1925) also had a third finger. The 1932 ''King Kong'' screenplay refers to the [[dinosaur]] only as a \"meat eater.\" The creature appears in the iconic scene where Kong defends Ann from its attack, killing it after a protracted fight.{{-}}\n\n* An '''''[[Elasmosaurus]]'''''-like creature \u2013 A highly stylized, [[Snake|serpentine]] aquatic [[reptile]] with a long neck and tail as well as two pairs of flippers. It inhabits the bubbling pool area inside King Kong's cave. Goldner describes the ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'' as \"being designed as more slender than the ones known to science, and its swimming limbs are less prominent. In those respects, it more closely resembles the [[Polydactyly in early tetrapods|polydactyl]] [[nothosaur]] ''[[Ceresiosaurus]]''.\"<ref name=Goldner/> It also resembles the long-necked reptile ''[[Tanystropheus]]''. It battles Kong in the style of a giant, constricting [[snake]].\n* '''''[[Pteranodon]]''''' - A flying reptile that tries to carry off Ann on top of Kong's lair Skull Mountain. Kong battles the creature and saves Ann.  \n\n* '''''[[Gigantophis|Gigantophis garstini]]''''' \u2013 According to Goldner, \"This huge [[snake]] that appeared in one scene and later cut out of the film, had its living prototype in [[Egypt]].\" This giant [[snake]] frightens Ann at the base of the dead tree that Kong puts her in before he battles the sailors on the log bridge. It was in the test reel, but later cut. However, Ann Darrow's reaction to it being below her just before the ''Tyrannosaurus'' appears in the clearing remains in the film.\n\n* '''''[[Erythrosuchus]]''''' \u2013 It was created and then re-created for the \"[[spider]]-pit sequence\" and portrayed as a stout [[Reptile|reptilian]] predator. Goldner stated that it was loosely adapted, as many of the creatures of the pit were imaginative.<ref name=Goldner/>\n\n* '''''[[Nothosaurus]]''''' \u2013 A [[dragon]]-like creature that threatens Denham and Hilda, but is fended off and killed by the son of Kong. ''King Kong: A History of a Movie Icon'' calls the creature 'the [[Dragon]]' all through its review of ''The Son of Kong''. In some respects, it resembles a very large ''[[Protorosaurus]]''.\n\n===2005 remake===\nAll the creatures in [[King Kong (2005 film)|Peter Jackson's remake of ''King Kong'']] do not appear to be any real species of animal, but do resemble certain ones. The companion book ''The World of Kong: A Natural History of Skull Island'', elaborates on this stating that they are fictional descendants of real animals.\n\nAmong the creatures in the 2005 remake are:<ref name=\"The World of Kong: A Natural History of Skull Island\">{{cite book|title=The World of Kong: A Natural History of Skull Island|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JtdI-BuTEhgC&pg=PP1|accessdate=16 June 2013|year=2005|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=978-1-4165-0519-8}}</ref>\n\n* '''''Brontosaurus baxteri''''' \u2013 A large ''[[Brontosaurus]]''-like [[sauropod]] which (despite the name) is more similar in size and appearance to ''[[Argentinosaurus]]'' that appears early in the film. They are attacked by a pack of ''Venatosaurus'' and cause a stampede. They trample several of the crew and some of the ''Venatosaurus''. Like real sauropods, they are social animals that organize in herds led by a dominant bull. Unlike all real sauropods, ''Brontosaurus'' give birth to between one and three live young rather than reproducing with eggs. As Skull Island's largest herbivore, they are responsible for keeping the jungle from overrunning the remaining grasslands.<ref name=\"The World of Kong: A Natural History of Skull Island\"/>\n\n* '''''Brutornis''''' \u2013 A [[phorusrhacid]] that is seen in the extended cut of ''King Kong'' and in ''The World of Kong''. In the extended cut, the crew of the Venture mistake one for Ann and Lumpy shoots it by mistake when he loses his nerves. After being discovered by the crew, the dying [[terror bird]] is then killed by Lumpy.<ref name=\"The World of Kong: A Natural History of Skull Island\"/>\n\n* '''''Ferrucutus cerastes''''' \u2013 A giant [[ceratopsian]] that bears slight resemblance to ''[[Pachyrhinosaurus]]''. It appears only in the extended cut and in a cameo as Kong climbs to his lair. In the extended cut, a large male attacks the crew and almost kills Jack Driscoll before being killed by Hayes. ''Ferrucutus'' is an aggressive herbivore that dwells in small family groups. Like their ancestors, ''Ferrucutus'' bulls spar violently, even to the point of killing their rivals.<ref name=\"The World of Kong: A Natural History of Skull Island\"/>\n\n* '''''Foetodon ferrus''''' \u2013 A terrestrial [[crocodilian]] about {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=off}} long that appears in both the film and the companion book. In the film, Ann stumbles across a mated pair of ''Foetodon'' feeding on a dead ''Ligocristus''. The predators pursue her into a hollow log, and a subadult ''V. rex'' appears by killing and eating one of the pursuing ''Foetodon'', forcing its mate to flee.

It is the home of the eponymous [[King Kong]] and several other species of creatures, mostly prehistoric and in some cases species that should have been extinct long before the rise of mammalian creatures, along with a primitive society of humans.\n\nIn the 1962 film ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]'' and the 1967 film ''[[King Kong Escapes]]'', the comparable islands are called \"Farou Island\" and \"Mondo Island\", respectively. Kong plays a similar role in these islands as the god-like being of the land, a role he plays in all versions of the King Kong story. Skull Island's origins are unknown, but Kong appears to be the only giant gorilla known to exist on the island. However, the [[King Kong (2005 film)|2005 remake]] shows other skeletons of Kong-sized gorillas, indicating that there was once a group of such creatures of an unknown number living on the island. Additionally, 2017's ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'' depicts the skeletons of Kong's parents.\n\n==History==\n\n===Appearance in the 1933 films===\nIn ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', the island is never mentioned by name and is located at approximately {{Coord|12|S|78|E}}&nbsp;\u2013 somewhere off the coast of [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]]. There is a distinctive rocky [[hillock|knoll]] in the center of the island that is shaped like a [[human skull]], which is referred to as \"Skull Mountain\".\n\nAccording to the first movie, the captain of a Norwegian barque discovered a canoe blown off course with only one native left alive.  Before the native died, the captain of the barque was able to get a rough location of the island and some details on it, including its most distinctive feature - a huge wall built by the ancestors of the natives back when they had high civilization.  When the protagonists of the picture arrive at the island and examine it they find,\nin addition to the expected superstitious natives, [[Prehistoric life|prehistoric creatures]] of all sorts and one extremely large [[ape]], known by those on the island as \"[[King Kong|Kong]]\".\n\nOther then being the descendants of a high civilization, the ancestry of the [[Indigenous peoples|natives]] is never really explained, although the setting suggests they are a [[Southeast Asia]]n group.\n\nIn the sequel film ''[[Son of Kong|The Son of Kong]]'', Carl Denham returns to Skull Island when there was a mention of some treasure that was hidden there. He also encounters a large white gorilla who is the son of King Kong. Skull Island sinks into the sea during a powerful earthquake. Kong's son drowns while holding Carl Denham above the water. Denham survives unscathed, while the treasure is claimed by him and the other three survivors.\n\nThe term \"Skull Island\" is never used in the original films. In ''King Kong'', only \"Skull Mountain\" is named, while in the sequel ''[[Son of Kong]]'', its simply referred to as \"Kong's island\". In the novelization of ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' by Delos Lovelace, it is called \"Skull Mountain Island\". But RKO referred to it as \"Skull Island\" in some of their publicity materials.\n\n===1976 remake===\nIn the 1976's ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]'', Skull Island is mentioned as being \"the beach of the skull.\" It is located somewhere in [[Indian Ocean]], covered by a permanent cloud bank. Various people are said to have visited the island through the centuries but returned with no clear proof. By the 1970s, it is an urban legend whose only evidence is in government secret files. It is also revealed to have a huge deposit of oil, which led a greedy oil company executive to go in search of it. Besides featuring a primitive native tribe (most seem to be of West African ancestry) and the giant, [[bipedal]] gorilla Kong, there is also a giant snake who appeared in Kong's lair and wanted to kill him and Dwan, but it was killed by the former.\n\nIn 1986 sequel film ''[[King Kong Lives]]'', Skull Island does not appear but it was mentioned by adventurer Hank Mitchell (mistakenly calling it Kong Island) who believed that the islands Borneo and Skull Island were once a part of the same landmass in the past. The fate of this incarnation is unknown.\n\n===''Kong: The Animated Series''===\nIn ''[[Kong: The Animated Series]]'', the island was named '''Kong Island'''. Unlike previous incarnations, Kong Island was situated in the infamous [[Bermuda Triangle]], not the Indian Ocean. Although various prehistoric creatures are seen living there, Kong Island also contains some ruins where one of them serves as the prison of the demon Chiros.\n\nIt is also where Jason Jenkins and his grandmother Dr. Lorna Jenkins also live along with Jason's friend Tan. Another human inhabitant is Lua, the sole survivor of the native people of the island and a female shaman.\n\n===''Kong: King of Skull Island''===\n\nA 2004 illustrated novel that serves as both prequel and sequel of the original \"King Kong\" story, conceived by Merian C. Cooper and novelized by Delos Lovelace in 1932, and authorized by the Cooper family. \n \nCreated and Illustrated by Joe DeVito [and novelized by Brad Strickland and DeVito, with John Michlig] ''Kong: King of Skull Island'' depicts a Skull Island far larger than originally thought. It is either the last vestige of a volatile volcanic series of islands or the remnant of a larger landmass. Skull Island is located in the Indian Ocean, west of [[Sumatra]], and has several much smaller islands in various locations around its perimeter, with the most prevalent of these off a small peninsula on its southeastern corner.\n \nSkull Island contains two main mountains, the larger being shaped in the visage of a human skull. Skull Mountain is riddled with caves and passageways carved out by natural erosion, but also man-made. In earlier times, these were often used by islanders to avoid the monsters on the surface, but proved to have a multitude of dangerous denizens of their own. These include previously unknown species such as snake-like amphibians with enormous heads capable of swallowing a human whole; foot-long creatures that combine squid and crustacean characteristics with bio-luminescent sails tipped with poisonous stingers; giant spiders with 7-foot bodies and 8-foot-long legs ending in hand-like appendages. \n \nThe human civilization that inhabits Skull Island at least through the 20th century is the last remnant of a previously unknown super-race called the Tagatu (a combination of two formerly separate tribes: the Tagu and the Atu). The original culture is believed to have Asian origins that bled into an island group west of Sumatra that no longer exists. As a result of a natural disaster, they were forced to migrate to Skull Island untold millennia ago. Drawn to its spectacular makeup by their insatiable curiosity, the Tagatu believed their mastery of biological and organic sciences could overcome Skull Island's dangers. It was they who originally brought the gigantic simian Kongs there for protection and who, with the help of the Kongs, built the iconic wall across the Skull Island\u2019s peninsula for protections against Skull Island\u2019s prehistoric denizens.\n \nAmong the many mysteries revealed in the work is the reality that on Skull Island the dinosaurs never died out, but continued to evolve over the intervening 65 million years. This has resulted in strange variations on previously known species, as well as many new ones. Chief among the latter is a race of sentient dinosaurs, called Deathrunners. Bipedal, extremely aggressive and 6 to 9 feet tall, they once ruled the island and were at war with the Tagatu and the Kongs. Their race is propagated every few generations by one queen that grows to gigantic size. It is one of these, called \u201cGaw\u201d, that ruled Skull Island when King Kong was born and who Kong had to defeat in order to become a king.\n \nIn the story, Carl Denham's son, Vincent (now a paleontologist), and an older Jack Driscoll return to Skull Island in 1957 to discover pieces of the earlier civilization\u2019s history and relationship to the island through an enigmatic Tagatu elder simply called the \u201cStoryteller\u201d, as well as in the form of archaeological discoveries such as specially pigmented paintings in underground passageways that move when illuminated by torchlight to reveal past events on Skull Island. Primary among these is the discovery of remnants of \u201cthe Old City\u201d, which was established by the Tagatu at the zenith of their civilization in the center of the island in an ideal valley between the two mountains. The Storyteller's tale, along with Vincent and Driscoll's findings, suggest that the eerie skull visage that gave the island its name may have been the work of human hands. These and other discoveries hint that the true extent of Skull Island\u2019s secrets have yet to be revealed.\n\n===2005 remake===\nIn Peter Jackson's remake, Skull Island's position west of [[Sumatra]] remains the same, in a region afflicted by magnetic anomalies and violent sea storms. According to the book ''[[The World of Kong: A Natural History of Skull Island]]'', Skull Island was geologically unstable and has been slowly sinking into the sea for the past thousand years. By 1933, the island was on the verge of destruction. Fifteen years after its discovery to the modern world, Skull Island finally sank into the ocean.\n\nIn its prehistory, Skull Island was a refuge for a variety of prehistoric creatures. Over time, more and more species arrived either by swimming, flying, rafting, or migrating through temporary [[land bridge]]s. As the island slowly receded into the sea, life was forced to adapt, resulting in an ecosystem of bizarre and nightmarish creatures.\n\nThree thousand years before, an advanced civilization from [[Southeast Asia]] migrated to Skull Island, bringing with them domesticated animals such as [[Gaur]] and the giant ancestors of Kong. This culture eventually died off, leaving behind only gigantic eroding ruins scattered around the island (such as the enormous wall) and a small society of primitive people that became the Skull Island natives.\n\n===Altus Press===\nTo coincide with the 80th anniversary of both characters, [[Altus Press]] announced on January 29, 2013, that King Kong would meet pulp hero [[Doc Savage]] in a new, officially sanctioned book written by [[Will Murray (writer)|Will Murray]] and artist Joe DeVito, who will also do the cover artwork. Set in 1920, shortly after returning from military service during [[World War I]], Doc Savage searches for his long-lost grandfather (the legendary mariner [[List_of_Doc_Savage_characters#Stormolong_Savage|Stormalong Savage]]) with his father, the explorer [[List_of_Doc_Savage_characters#Clark_Savage.2C_Sr.|Clark Savage, Sr.]], that ultimately leads father and son to the mysterious Skull Island and its prehistoric denizens, including King Kong.

The island is located in the South Pacific and sits in the eye of a massive swirling storm system that has enabled its concealment from the outside world. The island is situated atop an entrance to the [[Hollow Earth]], which is home to large, two-legged lizard-like predators that have come to be known as \"Skullcrawlers\" that are referred to as the island's \"devils\". The Skullcrawlers wiped out King Kong's family, making him the last of his kind.\n\nThere is also evidence of dinosaurs living, or having lived, on the island, in the form of a ''[[Triceratops]]'' skull found in the \"graveyard\" of the island. A number of other species are referred to as \"florafauna\" for displaying physiological traits of plants. Similar to previous incarnations, there is a human native tribe present (characterized as [[Iwi]]s) who are much less hostile than in previous versions, mainly because a stranded air pilot from [[World War II]] named Hank Marlow makes peace between them and modern-day humans. The film sees an expedition in 1973 landing upon the island after Skull Island is detected by [[Landsat]].\n\nDuring the credits of ''[[Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019 film)|Godzilla: King of the Monsters]]'', a newspaper clipping states that the awakened Titans are beginning to converge on Skull Island, which is starting to become unstable. It is also revealed in the film that Monarch has an outpost on Skull Island.<ref>https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2474440/you-need-to-see-kong-skull-island-to-fully-appreciate-godzilla-king-of-the-monsters</ref>\n\n==Island wildlife==\n===''King Kong'' and ''The Son of Kong''===\n[[File:T. rex old posture.jpg|thumb|Charles R.

The Brontosaurus attacks the raft and eats several crew members in the water and on land.

It falls back into the pit when Jack cuts the vine that it is climbing. Other than the two limbs, the other distinct feature of this creature is the [[iguana]]-like ridge of spikes down its back. Orville Goldner said it was loosely based on the features of the ''[[Desmatosuchus]]''.<ref name=Goldner/>\n\n* '''''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''''' \u2013 The [[dinosaur]] was modeled after [[Charles R. Knight]]'s depiction of a ''Tyrannosaurus''.<ref name=Goldner/> However, it possesses three fingers per hand, unlike ''Tyrannosaurus'' which had only two (however, the number of fingers in ''Tyrannosaurus'' was disputed at the time, as a complete ''manus'' was not discovered until the mid-1990s). In the documentary ''I'm King Kong! The Exploits of Merian C. Cooper'', included on the two-disc DVD release of ''King Kong'', Cooper refers to this beast as an ''[[Allosaurus]]'', not a ''Tyrannosaurus'', which would help explain the number of fingers. However, the creature was originally intended to be a ''Tyrannosaurus'' designed for the cancelled [[Willis O'Brien]] film ''[[Creation (unfinished film)|Creation]]'' (1931). It may also be worth noting that the ''Tyrannosaurus'' present in Willis O'Brien's earlier project ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1925) also had a third finger. The 1932 ''King Kong'' screenplay refers to the [[dinosaur]] only as a \"meat eater.\" The creature appears in the iconic scene where Kong defends Ann from its attack, killing it after a protracted fight.{{-}}\n\n* An '''''[[Elasmosaurus]]'''''-like creature \u2013 A highly stylized, [[Snake|serpentine]] aquatic [[reptile]] with a long neck and tail as well as two pairs of flippers. It inhabits the bubbling pool area inside King Kong's cave. Goldner describes the ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'' as \"being designed as more slender than the ones known to science, and its swimming limbs are less prominent. In those respects, it more closely resembles the [[Polydactyly in early tetrapods|polydactyl]] [[nothosaur]] ''[[Ceresiosaurus]]''.\"<ref name=Goldner/> It also resembles the long-necked reptile ''[[Tanystropheus]]''. It battles Kong in the style of a giant, constricting [[snake]].\n* '''''[[Pteranodon]]''''' - A flying reptile that tries to carry off Ann on top of Kong's lair Skull Mountain. Kong battles the creature and saves Ann.  \n\n* '''''[[Gigantophis|Gigantophis garstini]]''''' \u2013 According to Goldner, \"This huge [[snake]] that appeared in one scene and later cut out of the film, had its living prototype in [[Egypt]].\" This giant [[snake]] frightens Ann at the base of the dead tree that Kong puts her in before he battles the sailors on the log bridge. It was in the test reel, but later cut. However, Ann Darrow's reaction to it being below her just before the ''Tyrannosaurus'' appears in the clearing remains in the film.\n\n* '''''[[Erythrosuchus]]''''' \u2013 It was created and then re-created for the \"[[spider]]-pit sequence\" and portrayed as a stout [[Reptile|reptilian]] predator. Goldner stated that it was loosely adapted, as many of the creatures of the pit were imaginative.<ref name=Goldner/>\n\n* '''''[[Nothosaurus]]''''' \u2013 A [[dragon]]-like creature that threatens Denham and Hilda, but is fended off and killed by the son of Kong. ''King Kong: A History of a Movie Icon'' calls the creature 'the [[Dragon]]' all through its review of ''The Son of Kong''. In some respects, it resembles a very large ''[[Protorosaurus]]''.\n\n===2005 remake===\nAll the creatures in [[King Kong (2005 film)|Peter Jackson's remake of ''King Kong'']] do not appear to be any real species of animal, but do resemble certain ones.

They are attacked by a pack of ''Venatosaurus'' and cause a stampede. They trample several of the crew and some of the ''Venatosaurus''. Like real sauropods, they are social animals that organize in herds led by a dominant bull. Unlike all real sauropods, ''Brontosaurus'' give birth to between one and three live young rather than reproducing with eggs. As Skull Island's largest herbivore, they are responsible for keeping the jungle from overrunning the remaining grasslands.<ref name=\"The World of Kong: A Natural History of Skull Island\"/>\n\n* '''''Brutornis''''' \u2013 A [[phorusrhacid]] that is seen in the extended cut of ''King Kong'' and in ''The World of Kong''.

In the film, Ann stumbles across a mated pair of ''Foetodon'' feeding on a dead ''Ligocristus''. The predators pursue her into a hollow log, and a subadult ''V. rex'' appears by killing and eating one of the pursuing ''Foetodon'', forcing its mate to flee. ''Foetodon'' is an ambush predator that hides in deep piles of leaves, waiting for small dinosaurs and large flightless birds to wander past.<ref name=\"The World of Kong: A Natural History of Skull Island\"/>\n\n* '''Giant [[arthropod]]s''' \u2013 Several species of giant arthropods appear at the bottom of the Ravine.

[[Slavery in the colonial United States|Slavery]] was ingrained in the economic and social fabric of [[Colony of Virginia|colonial Virginia]], and [[George Washington|Washington]] inherited his first ten slaves at the age of eleven on the death of his father in 1743. In adulthood his personal slaveholding increased through inheritance, purchase and natural increase. In 1759, he gained control of [[Dowry|dower]] slaves belonging to the Custis estate on his marriage to [[Martha Dandridge Custis]]. Washington's early attitudes to slavery reflected the prevailing Virginia [[Planter class|planter]] views of the day, and so he demonstrated no moral qualms about the institution. He became skeptical about the economic efficacy of slavery before the [[American Revolutionary War]], and expressed support in private for abolition by a gradual legislative process after the war. Washington remained dependent on slave labor, and by the time of his death in 1799 there were 317 slaves at his [[Mount Vernon]] estate, 124 owned by Washington and the remainder managed by him as his own property but belonging to other people.\n\nWashington was a demanding master. He provided his slaves with basic food, clothing and accommodation comparable to general practice at the time but not always adequate, and with medical care. In return, he expected them to work diligently from sunrise to sunset over the six-day working week that was standard at the time. Some three-quarters of the slaves labored in the fields, while the remainder worked at the main residence as domestic servants and artisans. They supplemented their diet by hunting, trapping, and growing vegetables in their free time, and bought extra rations, clothing and housewares with income from the sale of game and produce. They built their own community around marriage and family, though because Washington allocated slaves to farms according to the demands of the business without regard for their relationships, many husbands lived separately from their wives and children. Washington used both reward and punishment to encourage and discipline his slaves, but was constantly disappointed when they failed to meet his exacting standards. They resisted enslavement by various means, including theft to supplement food and clothing and as another source of income, by feigning illness, and by running away.\n\nWashington's first doubts about slavery were entirely economic, prompted by his transition from tobacco to grain crops in the 1760's which left him with a costly surplus of slaves. As commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in 1775, he initially refused to accept African-Americans, free or slave, into the ranks, but reversed this position due to the demands of war. The first indication of moral doubt appeared during efforts to sell some of his slaves in 1778, when Washington expressed distaste for selling them at a public venue and his desire that slave families not be split up as a result of the sale. His public words and deeds at the end of the American Revolutionary War in 1783 betrayed no antislavery sentiments. Politically, Washington was concerned that such a divisive issue as [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] should not threaten national unity, and he never spoke publicly about the institution. Privately, Washington considered plans in the mid 1790s to free all the slaves he controlled, but they could not be realized because of his failure to secure his own financial security and the refusal of his family to cooperate. His will provided for the emancipation of his own slaves, the only [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] to do so. Because many of his slaves were married to Martha's dower slaves, whom he could not legally free, Washington stipulated that, with the exception of his valet William Lee who was freed immediately, his slaves be emancipated on the death of Martha. She freed them in 1801, a year before her own death, but her dower slaves were passed to her grandchildren and remained in bondage.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|History of slavery in Virginia}}\n[[File:The Leading Facts of American History (1910) - The First Negro Slaves Brought to Virginia.png|thumb|First slaves arriving in Virginia|alt=Black and white illustration]]\nSlavery was introduced into the English [[colony of Virginia]] when the first Africans were transported to [[Old Point Comfort|Point Comfort]] in 1619. Those who accepted Christianity became \"Christian servants\" with time-limited servitude, or even freed, but this mechanism for ending bondage was gradually shut down. In 1667, the [[Virginia General Assembly|Virginia Assembly]] passed a law that barred [[baptism]] as a means of conferring freedom. Africans who had been baptised before arriving in Virginia could be granted the status of [[Indentured servitude|indentured servant]] until 1682, when another law declared them to be slaves. Whites and people of African descent in the lowest stratum of Virginian society shared common disadvantages and a common lifestyle, which included intermarriage until the Assembly made such unions punishable by banishment in 1691.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 41\u201343</ref>\n\nIn 1671, Virginia counted 6,000 white indentured servants among its 40,000 population but only 2,000 people of African descent, up to a third of whom in some counties were free. Towards the end of the 17th century, British policy shifted in favor of retaining cheap labor rather than shipping it to the colonies, and the supply of indentured servants in Virginia began to dry up; by 1715, annual immigration was in the hundreds, compared with 1,500\u20132,000 in the 1680s. As tobacco planters put more land under cultivation, they made up the shortfall in labor with increasing numbers of slaves. The institution was rooted in race with the [[Virginia Slave Codes of 1705]], and from around 1710 the growth in the slave population was fueled by natural increase. Between 1700 and 1750 the number of slaves in the colony increased from 13,000 to 105,000, nearly eighty percent of them born in Virginia.<ref>Wiencek 2003 43\u201346</ref> In Washington's lifetime, slavery was deeply ingrained in the economic and social fabric of Virginia, where some forty percent of the population and virtually all African Americans were enslaved.<ref>Henriques 2008 p. 146</ref>\n\nGeorge Washington was born February 22, 1732, the first child of his father [[Augustine Washington|Augustine]]'s second marriage. Augustine was a tobacco planter with some {{convert|10,000|acre|ha}} of land and 50 slaves. On his death in 1743, he left his {{convert|2,500|acre|ha|adj=on}} Little Hunting Creek to George's older half-brother [[Lawrence Washington (1718\u20131752)|Lawrence]], who renamed it [[Mount Vernon]].

Horses and mules were bred in stables there, and tropical plants were grown in a greenhouse. Trades such as blacksmithing, carpentry, barrel making (coopering), food production and preservation, spinning, weaving and shoe making were carried out in other buildings at Mansion House Farm. Some crops were grown at this farm, but the main agricultural business was conducted at the four outlying farms located in a radius of between {{convert|1+1/2|mi|km|spell=in}} and {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} from the mansion: Dogue Run Farm, Muddy Hole Farm, Union Farm (formed from the earlier Ferry Farm and French's Farm) and River Farm.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 4</ref> A farm manager responsible for the running of the estate reported directly to Washington, while an overseer was employed at each of the farms.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 78\u201379</ref>}}\n\n[[File:A Map of Washington's Farms at Mt.

They were kept busy year round, their tasks varying with the season.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 117\u2013118</ref> The remainder worked as domestic servants in the main residence or as artisans, such as carpenters, [[joiner]]s, [[Cooper (profession)|coopers]], [[Hand spinning|spinners]] and seamstresses.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 109\u2013111</ref> Between 1766 and 1799, seven dower slaves worked at one time or another as overseers.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 86, 343\u2013344</ref> Slaves were expected to work from sunrise to sunset over a six-day work week that was standard on Virginia plantations. With two hours off for meals, their workdays would range between seven and a half hours to thirteen hours, depending on season. They were given three or four days off at Christmas and a day each at Easter and [[Whitsunday]].<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 106\u2013107, 122\u2013123</ref> Domestic slaves started early, worked into the evenings and did not necessarily have Sundays and holidays free.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 110, 124, 134</ref> On special occasions when slaves were required to put in extra effort, such as working through a holiday or bringing in the harvest, they were paid or compensated with extra time off.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 123\u2013124</ref>\n\nThere were elements of patriarchy and paternalism in Washington's attitudes to his workforce; he thought of his workers as part of an extended family in which he occupied the position of a father figure, with mutual obligations between master and servant.<ref>Morgan 2000 p. 282</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 45\u201348</ref> He instructed his overseers to treat slaves \"with humanity and tenderness\" when sick.<ref name=Morgan2005-410 /> Slaves who were less able, through injury, disability or age, were given light duties, while those too sick to work were generally, though not always, excused work while they recovered.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 120, 125</ref> Washington provided them with good, sometimes costly medical care{{snd}}when a slave named Cupid fell ill with [[pleurisy]], Washington had him taken to the main house where he could be better cared for and personally checked on him throughout the day.<ref name=Twohig117 /><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 100</ref> The humanitarian concern for the welfare of his slaves was mixed with an economic consideration for the lost productivity arising from sickness and death among the labor force.<ref name=\"Twohig 2001 p. 116\">Twohig 2001 p. 116</ref><ref>Ellis 2004 p. 46</ref> Although Washington insisted on an emotional distance between master and slave, there are examples of genuine affection, such as was the case with his valet [[William Lee (valet)|William Lee]], and evidence that slaves were able to approach him with their concerns and grievances.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 51\u201353, 97</ref>\n\n===Living conditions===\n[[File:Slave cabin at pioneer farm - Mount Vernon.jpg|thumb|left|Modern reconstruction of a slave cabin at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph]]\nAt Mansion House Farm, most slaves were housed in a two-story [[Framing (construction)|frame building]] known as the \"Quarters for Families\". This was replaced in 1792 by brick-built accommodation wings either side of the greenhouse comprising four rooms in total, each of some {{convert|600|sqft|m2}}. The [[Mount Vernon Ladies' Association]] have concluded these rooms were communal areas furnished with bunks that allowed little privacy for the predominantly male occupants. Other slaves at Mansion House Farm lived over the outbuildings where they worked or in log cabins.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162\u2013164, 166\u2013167</ref> Such cabins were the standard slave accommodation at the outlying farms, comparable to the accommodation occupied by the lower strata of free white society across the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake area]] and by slaves on other Virginia plantations.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162, 167, 169</ref> They provided a single room that ranged in size from 168 square feet (15.6 m2) to 246 square feet (22.9 m2) to house a family.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168\u2013169</ref> The cabins were often poorly constructed, daubed with mud for draft- and water-proofing, with dirt floors. Some cabins were built as duplexes; some single-unit cabins were small enough to be moved on carts.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168, 170</ref> There are few sources which shed light on living conditions in these cabins, but one visitor in 1798 wrote, \"husband and wife sleep on a mean pallet, the children on the ground; a very bad fireplace, some utensils for cooking, but in the middle of this poverty some cups and a teapot.\" Other sources suggest the interiors were smoky, dirty and dark, with only a shuttered opening for a window and the fireplace for illumination at night.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 170\u2013172</ref>\n\nWashington provided slaves with a blanket each fall at most, which they used for their own bedding and which they were required to use to gather leaves for livestock bedding.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 175\u2013176</ref> Slaves at the outlying farms were issued with a basic set of clothing each year, comparable to the clothing issued on other Virginia plantations. Slaves slept and worked in their clothes, leaving them to spend many months in garments that were worn, ripped and tattered.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 177\u2013178</ref> Domestic slaves at the main residence who came into regular contact with visitors were better clothed; butlers, waiters and body servants were dressed in a [[livery]] based on the three-piece suit of an 18th-century gentleman, and maids were provided with finer quality clothing than their counterparts in the fields.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 179\u2013181</ref>\n\nWashington desired his slaves to be fed adequately but no more.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 244\u2013245</ref> Each slave was provided with a basic daily food ration of {{convert|1|USqt|l|spell=in}} or more of [[cornmeal]], up to {{convert|8|oz|g|spell=in}} of herring and occasionally some meat, a fairly typical ration for slaves in Virginia that was adequate in terms of the calorie requirement for a young man engaged in moderately heavy agricultural labor but nutritionally deficient.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 221\u2013222, 245</ref> The basic ration was supplemented by slaves' own efforts hunting (for which some slaves were allowed guns) and trapping game. They grew their own vegetables in small garden plots they were permitted to maintain in their own time, on which they also reared poultry.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 229\u2013231</ref>\n\nWashington often tipped slaves on his visits to other estates, and it is likely that his own slaves were similarly rewarded by visitors to Mount Vernon. Slaves occasionally earned money through their normal work or for particular services rendered{{snd}}for example, Washington rewarded three of his own slaves with cash for good service in 1775, a slave received a fee for the care of a mare that was being bred in 1798 and the chef [[Hercules (chef)|Hercules]] profited well by selling slops from the presidential kitchen.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 193\u2013194</ref> Slaves also earned money from their own endeavors, by selling to Washington or at the market in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] food they had caught or grown and small items they had made.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 197, 231</ref> They used the proceeds to purchase from Washington or the shops in Alexandria better clothing, housewares and extra provisions such as flour, pork, whiskey, tea, coffee and sugar.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 194, 195\u2013196, 232</ref>\n\n===Family and community===\n[[File:Slave Cabin interior 01 - Mount Vernon.jpg|thumb|Interior of the reconstructed slave cabin at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph showing single bedding on a pallet on a dirt floor]]\nAlthough the law did not recognize slave marriages, Washington did, and by 1799 some two-thirds of the adult slaves at Mount Vernon were married.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 128</ref> To minimize time lost in getting to the workplace and thus increase productivity, slaves were accommodated at the farm on which they worked. Because of the unequal distribution of males and females across the five farms, slaves often found partners on different farms, and in their day to day lives husbands were routinely separated from their wives and children. Only thirty-six of the ninety-six married slaves at Mount Vernon in 1799 lived together, while thirty-eight had spouses who lived on separate farms and twenty-two had spouses who lived on other plantations.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 122</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 132\u2013133</ref> The evidence suggests couples that were separated did not regularly visit during the week, and doing so prompted complaints from Washington that slaves were too exhausted to work after such \"night walking\", leaving Saturday nights/Sundays and holidays as the main time such families could spend together.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 134, 136, 202</ref> Despite the stress and anxiety caused by this indifference to family stability{{snd}}on one occasion an overseer wrote that the separation of families \"seems like death to them\"{{snd}}marriage was the foundation on which slaves established their own community, and longevity in these unions was not uncommon.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 127, 130\u2013131, 132</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 123</ref>\n\nLarge families that covered multiple generations, along with their attendant marriages, were part of a slave community-building process that transcended ownership. Washington's head carpenter Isaac, for example, lived with his wife Kitty, a dower-slave milkmaid, at Mansion House Farm. The couple had nine daughters ranging in age from six to twenty-seven in 1799, and the marriages of four of those daughters had extended the family to other farms within and outside the Mount Vernon estate and produced three grandchildren.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\">Thompson 2019 p. 135</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 p. 421</ref> Children were born into slavery, their ownership determined by the ownership of their mothers.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 309\">Thompson 2019 p. 309</ref> The value attached to the birth of a slave child, if it was noted at all, is indicated in the weekly report of one overseer, which stated, \"Increase 9 Lambs & 1 male child of Lynnas.\" New mothers received a new blanket and three to five weeks of light duties to recover. An infant remained with its mother at her place of work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 151\u2013152</ref> Older children, the majority of whom lived in single-parent households in which the mother worked from dawn to dusk, performed small family chores but were otherwise left to play largely unsupervised until they reached an age when they could begin to be put to work for Washington, usually somewhere between eleven and fourteen years old.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 158\u2013160</ref> In 1799, nearly sixty percent of the slave population was under nineteen years old and nearly thirty-five percent under nine.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\"/>\n\nThere is evidence that slaves passed on their African cultural values through telling stories, among them the tales of [[Br'er Rabbit]] which, with their origins in Africa and stories of a powerless individual triumphing through wit and intelligence over powerful authority, would have resonated with the slaves.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 203</ref> African-born slaves brought with them some of the religious rituals of their ancestral home, and there is an undocumented tradition of voodoo being practiced at one of the Mount Vernon farms.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 211\u2013213</ref> Although the slave condition made it impossible to adhere to the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], some slave names betray a Muslim cultural origin.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 213\u2013214</ref> [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] reached out to American-born slaves in Virginia, and some of the Mount Vernon slaves are known to have been christened before Washington acquired the estate. There is evidence in the historical record from 1797 that Mount Vernon slaves had contacts with [[Baptists]], [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Quakers]].<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 208\u2013209</ref> The three religions advocated abolition, raising hopes of freedom among the slaves, and the congregation of the Alexandria Baptist Church, founded in 1803, included slaves formerly owned by Washington.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 209, 210\u2013211</ref>\n\n===Mulattoes===\nIn 1799 there were some twenty [[mulatto]] (mixed race) slaves at Mount Vernon. The probability of paternal relationships between slaves and hired white workers is indicated by some surnames: Betty and Tom Davis, probably the children of Thomas Davis, a white weaver at Mount Vernon in the 1760s; George Young, likely the son of a man of the same name who was a clerk at Mount Vernon in 1774; and [[Oney Judge]] and her sister Delphy, the daughters of Andrew Judge, an indentured tailor at Mount Vernon in the 1770s and 1780s.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 138\u2013139</ref> There is evidence to suggest that white overseers{{snd}}working in close proximity to slaves under the same demanding master and physically and socially isolated from their own peer group, a situation that drove some to drink{{snd}}indulged in sexual relations with the slaves they supervised.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 140\u2013141</ref> Some white visitors to Mount Vernon seemed to have expected slave women to provide sexual favors.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 141\u2013142</ref> The living arrangements left some slave females alone and vulnerable, and the Mount Vernon research historian Mary V. Thompson writes that relationships \"could have been the result of mutual attraction and affection, very real demonstrations of power and control, or even exercises in the manipulation of an authority figure.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 140</ref>{{efn|There is an oral tradition among the descendants of the freedman [[West Ford (slave)|West Ford]] that he was the son of Washington and Venus, a slave belonging to Washington's brother [[John Augustine Washington]].

Food was stolen both to supplement rations and to sell, and Washington believed the selling of tools was another source of income for slaves. Because cloth and clothing were commonly stolen, Washington required seamstresses to show the results of their work and the leftover scraps before issuing them with more material. Sheep were washed before shearing to prevent the theft of wool, and storage areas were kept locked and keys left with trusted individuals.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 269\u2013271</ref> In 1792, Washington ordered the culling of slaves' dogs he believed were being used in a spate of livestock theft and ruled that slaves who kept dogs without authorization were to be \"severely punished\" and their dogs hanged.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 201</ref>\n\nAnother means by which slaves resisted, one that was virtually impossible to prove, was feigning illness. Over the years Washington became increasingly skeptical about absenteeism due to sickness among his slaves and concerned about the diligence or ability of his overseers in recognizing genuine cases. Between 1792 and 1794, while Washington was away from Mount Vernon as President, the number of days lost to sickness increased tenfold compared to 1786, when he was resident at Mount Vernon and able to control the situation personally. In one case, Washington suspected a slave of frequently avoiding work over a period of decades through acts of deliberate self harm.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 261\u2013263, 264\u2013265</ref>\n\nSlaves asserted some independence and frustrated Washington by the pace and quality of their work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 105, 265</ref> In 1760, Washington noted that four of his carpenters quadrupled their output of timber under his personal supervision.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 93\u201394</ref> Thirty-five years later, he described his carpenters as an \"idle...set of rascals\" who would take a month or more to complete at Mount Vernon work that was being done in two or three days in [[Philadelphia]]. The output of seamstresses dropped off when Martha was away, and spinners found they could slacken by playing the overseers off against her.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266\u2013267</ref> Tools were regularly lost or damaged, thus stopping work, and Washington despaired of employing innovations that might improve efficiency because he believed the slaves were too clumsy to operate the new machinery involved.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266, 268</ref>\n\nThe most emphatic act of resistance was to run away, and between 1760 and 1799 at least forty-seven slaves under Washington's control did so.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 275</ref> Seventeen of these, fourteen men and three women, escaped to a British warship that anchored in the [[Potomac River]] near Mount Vernon in 1781.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 278, 279</ref> In general, the best chance of success lay with second- or third-generation African-American slaves who had good English, possessed skills that would allow them to support themselves as free people and were in close enough contact with their masters to receive special privileges. Thus it was that Judge, an especially talented seamstress, and Hercules escaped in 1796 and 1797 respectively and eluded recapture.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 281, 284\u2013286</ref> Washington took seriously the recapture of fugitives, and in three cases an escaped slave was sold off in the West Indies after recapture, effectively a death sentence in the severe conditions slaves had to endure there.<ref name=\"Wiencek 2003 p. 132\">Wiencek 2003 p. 132</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 411\u2013412</ref><ref>Chernow 2010 p. 161</ref>\n\n===Control===\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|salign=right\n|width=25%\n|quote=Slavery was a system in which enslaved people lived in fear; fear of being sold, fear of being separated from their families or their children or their parents, fear of not being in control of their bodies or their lives, fear of never knowing freedom.

By 1766, he had transitioned his business from the labor-intensive planting of tobacco to the less demanding farming of grain crops. His slaves were employed on a greater variety of tasks that needed more skills than tobacco planting required of them; as well as the cultivation of grains and vegetables, they were employed in cattle herding, spinning, weaving and carpentry. The transition left Washington with a surplus of slaves and revealed to him the inefficiencies of the slave labor system.<ref name=Morgan2005p413>Morgan 2005 p. 413</ref><ref name=Twohig118>Twohig 2001 p. 118</ref>\n\nThere is little evidence that Washington seriously questioned the ethics of slavery before the Revolution.<ref name=Twohig118 /> In the 1760s he often participated in tavern lotteries, events in which defaulters' debts were settled by raffling off their assets to a high-spirited crowd.<ref>Chernow 2010 p. 162</ref> In 1769, Washington co-managed one such lottery in which fifty-five slaves were sold, among them six families and five females with children. The more valuable married males were raffled together with their wives and children; less valuable slaves were separated from their families into different lots. Robin and Bella, for example, were raffled together as husband and wife while their children, twelve-year-old Sukey and seven-year-old Betty, were listed in a separate lot. Only chance dictated whether the family would remain together, and with 1,840 tickets on sale the odds were not good.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 178\u2013180</ref>\n\nThe historian [[Henry Wiencek]] concludes that the repugnance Washington felt at this cruelty in which he had participated prompted his decision not to break up slave families by sale or purchase, and marks the beginning of a transformation in Washington's thinking about the morality of slavery.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 135, 188</ref> Wiencek writes that in 1775 Washington took more slaves than he needed rather than break up the family of a slave he had agreed to accept in payment of a debt.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 188</ref> The historians [[Philip D.

Two years later, on taking command of the [[Continental Army]] at Cambridge at the start of the [[American Revolutionary War]], he wrote in orders to his troops that \"it is a noble Cause we are engaged in, it is the Cause of virtue and mankind...freedom or Slavery must be the result of our conduct.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 p.64</ref> The hypocrisy inherent in slave owners characterizing a war of independence as a struggle for their own freedom from slavery was not lost on the British writer [[Samuel Johnson]], who asked, \"How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of Negroes?\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 191</ref>\n\nWashington shared the common southern concern about arming African-Americans or slaves and initially refused to accept either into the ranks of the Continental Army. He reversed his position on the recruitment of free African-Americans when the royal governor of Virginia, [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], issued a [[Dunmore's Proclamation|proclamation]] in November 1775 offering freedom to rebel-owned slaves who enlisted in the British forces.

He sought to liberate himself from an economically unviable system, not to liberate his slaves. They were still a property from which he expected to profit.

On returning to France, Lafayette purchased a plantation in the French colony of Cayenne, modern-day [[French Guiana]], and advised Washington of his progress by letter in 1786. Lafayette had taken concerns about the abrupt emancipation of slaves into account, paying and educating the slaves he settled on the plantation before freeing them. He became a leading figure in the French movement against the slave trade and a corresponding member of the British movement. Washington would not have known of Lafayette's antislavery activities in Cayenne or Europe from Lafayette himself; although the two continued to correspond for the rest of Washington's life, the subject of slavery virtually disappeared from their letters. The Cayenne experiment came to an end in 1792, when the plantation was sold by the French Revolutionary government after Lafayette's imprisonment by the Austrians.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 122\u2013128</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 261\u2013264</ref>}} Washington privately expressed support for emancipation to prominent Methodists [[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Thomas Coke]] and [[Francis Asbury]] in 1785, but declined to sign their petition.

He presided over the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787, during which it became obvious just how explosive the issue was and how willing the antislavery faction was to accept the preservation of slavery to ensure national unity and the establishment of a strong federal government. The support of the southern states for the new constitution was secured by granting them concessions that protected slavery, including the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]] and the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]], plus clauses that guaranteed the transatlantic slave trade for at least twenty years and federal aid for the suppression of any slave rebellion.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 422</ref><ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 124\u2013125</ref>\n\nWashington's preeminent position ensured that any actions he took with regard to his own slaves would become a statement in a national debate about slavery that threatened to divide the country. Wiencek suggests Washington considered making precisely such a statement on taking up the presidency in 1789. A passage in the notebook of Washington's biographer [[David Humphreys (soldier)|David Humphreys]]{{efn|Humphreys was a former aide to Washington and had begun an eighteen-month stay at Mount Vernon in 1787 to assist Washington with his correspondence and write his biography.<ref>Ellis 2004 p. 153</ref>}} dated to late 1788 or early 1789 recorded a statement that resembled the emancipation clause in Washington's will a decade later. Wiencek argues the passage was a draft for a public announcement Washington was considering in which he would declare the emancipation of some of his slaves. It marks, Wiencek believes, a moral epiphany in Washington's thinking, the moment he decided not only to emancipate his slaves but also to use the occasion to set the example Lafayette had urged in 1783.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\">Wiencek 2003 pp. 272\u2013275</ref> Other historians dispute Wiencek's conclusion; Henriques and [[Joseph Ellis]] concur with Philip Morgan's opinion that Washington experienced no epiphanies in a \"long and hard-headed struggle\" in which there was no single turning point. Morgan argues that Humphreys' passage is the \"private expression of remorse\" from a man unable to extricate himself from the \"tangled web\" of \"mutual dependency\" on slavery, and that Washington believed public comment on such a divisive subject was best avoided for the sake of national unity.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 421\u2013423, 425</ref><ref>Ellis 2004 p. 311 n22</ref><ref name=Henriques159 />{{efn|Wiencek bases his argument on the fact that the passage was written in the past tense and appears in Humphreys' notebook amid drafts Humphreys had written for public statements Washington was to make about assuming the presidency.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\" /> Philip Morgan points out that the passage was Humphreys' words in Washington's voice and appears just after a summary Humphreys had written of [[Thomas Clarkson]]'s 1788 ''An Essay on the Impolicy of the African Slave Trade''.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 423 n31</ref> Kenneth Morgan characterizes the passage as \"a remark made in [Washington's] voice by David Humphreys.\"<ref name=Morgan2000p298 /> Fritz Hirschfeld writes that the passage was written by Humphreys during direct dictation or from memory of Washington's exact words, and believes it highly improbable that they were not Washington's own words.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 213 n5</ref>}}\n\n====As President====\n{{See also|Presidency of George Washington}}\n[[File:George Washington 1795.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|''President George Washington'' by Gilbert Stuart (1795) |alt=Portrait painting]]\nWashington took up the presidency at a time when revolutionary sentiment against slavery was giving way to a resurgence of proslavery interests. No state considered making slavery an issue during the ratification of the new constitution, southern states reinforced their slavery legislation and prominent antislavery figures were muted about the issue in public. Washington understood there was little widespread organized support for abolition.<ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 125\u2013126</ref> He had a keen sense both of the fragility of the fledgling Republic and of his place as a unifying figure, and he was determined not to endanger either by confronting an issue as divisive and entrenched as slavery.<ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 126\u2013128</ref><ref>Morgan 2000 pp. 290, 295</ref> He was president of a government that passed a resolution in 1790 affirming states' rights to regulate treatment of slaves and legislate on slavery free of congressional interference, provided materiel and financial support for French efforts to suppress the [[Haitian Revolution|Saint Domingue slave revolt]] in 1791 and implemented the proslavery [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]].<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 275\u2013276</ref><ref>Twohig 2001 p. 130</ref><ref name=Morgan2000-297>Morgan 2000 p. 297</ref> He also signed into law the [[Slave Trade Act of 1794]] that sought to limit American involvement in the [[Atlantic slave trade|international slave trade]].<ref>Stathis 2014 pp. 17\u201318</ref> Washington never spoke publicly on the issue of slavery during his eight years as president, nor did he respond to, much less act upon, any of the antislavery petitions he received. He described a 1790 Quaker petition to [[United States Congress|Congress]] urging an immediate end to the slave trade as \"an illjudged piece of business\" that \"occasioned a great waste of time.\" The issue of slavery was not mentioned in either his last address to Congress or his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]].<ref>Twohig 2001 p. 126</ref><ref>Boller 1961 pp. 85, 87</ref><ref>Ferling 2009 p. 363</ref>\n\nLate in his presidency, Washington told his [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Edmund Randolph]], that in the event of a confrontation between North and South, he had \"made up his mind to remove and be of the Northern.\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 362</ref> In 1798, he imagined just such a conflict when he said, \"I can clearly foresee that nothing but the rooting out of slavery can perpetuate the existence of our union.\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 361\u2013362</ref><ref name=\"Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 72\u201373\"/> But there is no indication Washington ever favored an immediate end to slavery.

This plan would have involved breaking up slave families, but it was designed with an end goal of raising enough finances to fund their eventual emancipation (a detail Washington kept secret) and prevent the Custis heirs from permanently splitting up families by sale.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 339\u2013342</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 303\u2013304</ref>{{efn|The dower slaves had already begun to be transferred to Martha's granddaughters as the Custis heirs married.

Not only would Washington have been deprived of their services if they were freed, most of the slaves he took with him to Philadelphia were dower slaves, which meant that he would have had to compensate the Custis estate for the loss.

The plan involved repossessing tenancies in [[Berkeley County, West Virginia|Berkeley]] and [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick]] Counties and transferring half of his Mount Vernon slaves to work them. It would, Washington hoped, \"yield more nett profit\" which might \"benefit myself and not render the [slaves'] condition worse\", despite the disruption such relocation would have had on the slave families.

By the mid 1800s, a son of Washington's carpenter Davy Jones and two grandsons of his [[postilion]] Joe Richardson had each bought land in Virginia. Francis Lee, younger brother of William, was well known and respected enough to have his obituary printed in the ''Alexandria Gazette'' on his death at Mount Vernon in 1821. Sambo Anderson{{snd}}who hunted game, as he had while Washington's slave, and prospered for a while by selling it to the most respectable families in Alexandria{{snd}}was similarly noted by the ''Gazette'' when he died near Mount Vernon in 1845.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 317\u2013319</ref> Research published in 2019 has concluded that Hercules worked as a cook in New York, where he died on May 15, 1812.<ref>Ganeshram 2019</ref>\n\nA decade after Washington's death, the Pennsylvanian jurist [[Richard Peters (Continental Congress)|Richard Peters]] wrote that Washington's servants \"were devoted to him; and especially those more immediately about his person. The survivors of them still venerate and adore his memory.\" In his old age, Anderson said he was \"a much happier man when he was a slave than he had ever been since,\" because he then \"had a good kind master to look after all my wants, but now I have no one to care for me.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 322\u2013323</ref> When Judge was interviewed in the 1840s, she expressed considerable bitterness, not at the way she he had been treated as a slave, but at the fact that she had been enslaved.

Washington \"disdained to hold his fellow-creatures in abject domestic servitude,\" wrote the Massachusetts Federalist [[Timothy Bigelow (lawyer)|Timothy Bigelow]] before calling on \"fellow-citizens in the South\" to emulate Washington's example. In this narrative, Washington was a proto-abolitionist who, having added the freedom of his slaves to the freedom from British slavery he had won for the nation, would be mobilized to serve the antislavery cause.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 84\u201386</ref>\n\nAn alternative narrative more in line with proslavery sentiments embraced rather than excised Washington's ownership of slaves. Washington was cast as a paternal figure, the benevolent father not only of his country but also of a family of slaves bound to him by affection rather than coercion.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 92\u201394</ref> In this narrative, slaves idolized Washington and wept at his deathbed, and in an 1807 biography, [[Aaron Bancroft]] wrote, \"In domestick{{sic}} and private life, he blended the authority of the master with the care and kindness of the guardian and friend.\"<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 94, 96\u201397</ref> The competing narratives allowed both [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] and [[Confederate States of America|South]] to claim Washington as the father of their countries during the [[American Civil War]] that ended slavery more than half a century after his death.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 100\u2013101</ref>\n\n===Memorial===\nIn 1929, a plaque was embedded in the ground at Mount Vernon less than {{convert|50|yd|m|round=5}} from the crypt housing the remains of Washington and Martha, marking a plot neglected by both groundsmen and tourist guides where slaves had been buried in unmarked graves. The inscription read, \"In memory of the many faithful colored servants of the Washington family, buried at Mount Vernon from 1760 to 1860. Their unidentified graves surround this spot.\" The site remained untended and ignored in the visitor literature until the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association erected a more prominent monument surrounded with plantings and inscribed, \"In memory of the Afro Americans who served as slaves at Mount Vernon this monument marking their burial ground dedicated September 21, 1983.\" In 1985, a [[ground-penetrating radar]] survey identified sixty-six possible burials. As of late 2017, an archaeological project begun in 2014 has identified, without disturbing the contents, sixty-three burial plots in addition to seven plots known before the project began.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 217\u2013218</ref><ref>MVLA Slave Burial Ground Archaeology</ref><ref>MVLA Forgotten No Longer</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Chernow |first=Ron |authorlink=Ron Chernow |title=Washington, A Life |title-link=Washington: A Life |type=e-book |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London, United Kingdom |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-141-96610-6 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Joseph J. |authorlink=Joseph Ellis |title=His Excellency: George Washington |publisher=Alfred A.

[[Slavery in the colonial United States|Slavery]] was ingrained in the economic and social fabric of [[Colony of Virginia|colonial Virginia]], and [[George Washington|Washington]] inherited his first ten slaves at the age of eleven on the death of his father in 1743. In adulthood his personal slaveholding increased through inheritance, purchase and natural increase. In 1759, he gained control of [[Dowry|dower]] slaves belonging to the Custis estate on his marriage to [[Martha Dandridge Custis]]. Washington's early attitudes to slavery reflected the prevailing Virginia [[Planter class|planter]] views of the day, and so he demonstrated no moral qualms about the institution. He became skeptical about the economic efficacy of slavery before the [[American Revolutionary War]], and expressed support in private for abolition by a gradual legislative process after the war. Washington remained dependent on slave labor, and by the time of his death in 1799 there were 317 slaves at his [[Mount Vernon]] estate, 124 owned by Washington and the remainder managed by him as his own property but belonging to other people.\n\nWashington was a demanding master. He provided his slaves with basic food, clothing and accommodation comparable to general practice at the time but not always adequate, and with medical care. In return, he expected them to work diligently from sunrise to sunset over the six-day working week that was standard at the time. Some three-quarters of the slaves labored in the fields, while the remainder worked at the main residence as domestic servants and artisans. They supplemented their diet by hunting, trapping, and growing vegetables in their free time, and bought extra rations, clothing and housewares with income from the sale of game and produce. They built their own community around marriage and family, though because Washington allocated slaves to farms according to the demands of the business without regard for their relationships, many husbands lived separately from their wives and children. Washington used both reward and punishment to encourage and discipline his slaves, but was constantly disappointed when they failed to meet his exacting standards. They resisted enslavement by various means, including theft to supplement food and clothing and as another source of income, by feigning illness, and by running away.\n\nWashington's first doubts about slavery were entirely economic, prompted by his transition from tobacco to grain crops in the 1760's which left him with a costly surplus of slaves. As commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in 1775, he initially refused to accept African-Americans, free or slave, into the ranks, but reversed this position due to the demands of war. The first indication of moral doubt appeared during efforts to sell some of his slaves in 1778, when Washington expressed distaste for selling them at a public venue and his desire that slave families not be split up as a result of the sale. His public words and deeds at the end of the American Revolutionary War in 1783 betrayed no antislavery sentiments. Politically, Washington was concerned that such a divisive issue as [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] should not threaten national unity, and he never spoke publicly about the institution. Privately, Washington considered plans in the mid 1790s to free all the slaves he controlled, but they could not be realized because of his failure to secure his own financial security and the refusal of his family to cooperate. His will provided for the emancipation of his own slaves, the only [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] to do so. Because many of his slaves were married to Martha's dower slaves, whom he could not legally free, Washington stipulated that, with the exception of his valet William Lee who was freed immediately, his slaves be emancipated on the death of Martha. She freed them in 1801, a year before her own death, but her dower slaves were passed to her grandchildren and remained in bondage.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|History of slavery in Virginia}}\n[[File:The Leading Facts of American History (1910) - The First Negro Slaves Brought to Virginia.png|thumb|First slaves arriving in Virginia|alt=Black and white illustration]]\nSlavery was introduced into the English [[colony of Virginia]] when the first Africans were transported to [[Old Point Comfort|Point Comfort]] in 1619. Those who accepted Christianity became \"Christian servants\" with time-limited servitude, or even freed, but this mechanism for ending bondage was gradually shut down. In 1667, the [[Virginia General Assembly|Virginia Assembly]] passed a law that barred [[baptism]] as a means of conferring freedom. Africans who had been baptised before arriving in Virginia could be granted the status of [[Indentured servitude|indentured servant]] until 1682, when another law declared them to be slaves. Whites and people of African descent in the lowest stratum of Virginian society shared common disadvantages and a common lifestyle, which included intermarriage until the Assembly made such unions punishable by banishment in 1691.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 41\u201343</ref>\n\nIn 1671, Virginia counted 6,000 white indentured servants among its 40,000 population but only 2,000 people of African descent, up to a third of whom in some counties were free. Towards the end of the 17th century, British policy shifted in favor of retaining cheap labor rather than shipping it to the colonies, and the supply of indentured servants in Virginia began to dry up; by 1715, annual immigration was in the hundreds, compared with 1,500\u20132,000 in the 1680s. As tobacco planters put more land under cultivation, they made up the shortfall in labor with increasing numbers of slaves. The institution was rooted in race with the [[Virginia Slave Codes of 1705]], and from around 1710 the growth in the slave population was fueled by natural increase. Between 1700 and 1750 the number of slaves in the colony increased from 13,000 to 105,000, nearly eighty percent of them born in Virginia.<ref>Wiencek 2003 43\u201346</ref> In Washington's lifetime, slavery was deeply ingrained in the economic and social fabric of Virginia, where some forty percent of the population and virtually all African Americans were enslaved.<ref>Henriques 2008 p. 146</ref>\n\nGeorge Washington was born February 22, 1732, the first child of his father [[Augustine Washington|Augustine]]'s second marriage. Augustine was a tobacco planter with some {{convert|10,000|acre|ha}} of land and 50 slaves. On his death in 1743, he left his {{convert|2,500|acre|ha|adj=on}} Little Hunting Creek to George's older half-brother [[Lawrence Washington (1718\u20131752)|Lawrence]], who renamed it [[Mount Vernon]].

Horses and mules were bred in stables there, and tropical plants were grown in a greenhouse. Trades such as blacksmithing, carpentry, barrel making (coopering), food production and preservation, spinning, weaving and shoe making were carried out in other buildings at Mansion House Farm. Some crops were grown at this farm, but the main agricultural business was conducted at the four outlying farms located in a radius of between {{convert|1+1/2|mi|km|spell=in}} and {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} from the mansion: Dogue Run Farm, Muddy Hole Farm, Union Farm (formed from the earlier Ferry Farm and French's Farm) and River Farm.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 4</ref> A farm manager responsible for the running of the estate reported directly to Washington, while an overseer was employed at each of the farms.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 78\u201379</ref>}}\n\n[[File:A Map of Washington's Farms at Mt.

This was replaced in 1792 by brick-built accommodation wings either side of the greenhouse comprising four rooms in total, each of some {{convert|600|sqft|m2}}. The [[Mount Vernon Ladies' Association]] have concluded these rooms were communal areas furnished with bunks that allowed little privacy for the predominantly male occupants. Other slaves at Mansion House Farm lived over the outbuildings where they worked or in log cabins.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162\u2013164, 166\u2013167</ref> Such cabins were the standard slave accommodation at the outlying farms, comparable to the accommodation occupied by the lower strata of free white society across the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake area]] and by slaves on other Virginia plantations.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162, 167, 169</ref> They provided a single room that ranged in size from 168 square feet (15.6 m2) to 246 square feet (22.9 m2) to house a family.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168\u2013169</ref> The cabins were often poorly constructed, daubed with mud for draft- and water-proofing, with dirt floors. Some cabins were built as duplexes; some single-unit cabins were small enough to be moved on carts.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168, 170</ref> There are few sources which shed light on living conditions in these cabins, but one visitor in 1798 wrote, \"husband and wife sleep on a mean pallet, the children on the ground; a very bad fireplace, some utensils for cooking, but in the middle of this poverty some cups and a teapot.\" Other sources suggest the interiors were smoky, dirty and dark, with only a shuttered opening for a window and the fireplace for illumination at night.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 170\u2013172</ref>\n\nWashington provided slaves with a blanket each fall at most, which they used for their own bedding and which they were required to use to gather leaves for livestock bedding.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 175\u2013176</ref> Slaves at the outlying farms were issued with a basic set of clothing each year, comparable to the clothing issued on other Virginia plantations. Slaves slept and worked in their clothes, leaving them to spend many months in garments that were worn, ripped and tattered.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 177\u2013178</ref> Domestic slaves at the main residence who came into regular contact with visitors were better clothed; butlers, waiters and body servants were dressed in a [[livery]] based on the three-piece suit of an 18th-century gentleman, and maids were provided with finer quality clothing than their counterparts in the fields.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 179\u2013181</ref>\n\nWashington desired his slaves to be fed adequately but no more.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 244\u2013245</ref> Each slave was provided with a basic daily food ration of {{convert|1|USqt|l|spell=in}} or more of [[cornmeal]], up to {{convert|8|oz|g|spell=in}} of herring and occasionally some meat, a fairly typical ration for slaves in Virginia that was adequate in terms of the calorie requirement for a young man engaged in moderately heavy agricultural labor but nutritionally deficient.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 221\u2013222, 245</ref> The basic ration was supplemented by slaves' own efforts hunting (for which some slaves were allowed guns) and trapping game. They grew their own vegetables in small garden plots they were permitted to maintain in their own time, on which they also reared poultry.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 229\u2013231</ref>\n\nWashington often tipped slaves on his visits to other estates, and it is likely that his own slaves were similarly rewarded by visitors to Mount Vernon. Slaves occasionally earned money through their normal work or for particular services rendered{{snd}}for example, Washington rewarded three of his own slaves with cash for good service in 1775, a slave received a fee for the care of a mare that was being bred in 1798 and the chef [[Hercules (chef)|Hercules]] profited well by selling slops from the presidential kitchen.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 193\u2013194</ref> Slaves also earned money from their own endeavors, by selling to Washington or at the market in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] food they had caught or grown and small items they had made.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 197, 231</ref> They used the proceeds to purchase from Washington or the shops in Alexandria better clothing, housewares and extra provisions such as flour, pork, whiskey, tea, coffee and sugar.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 194, 195\u2013196, 232</ref>\n\n===Family and community===\n[[File:Slave Cabin interior 01 - Mount Vernon.jpg|thumb|Interior of the reconstructed slave cabin at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph showing single bedding on a pallet on a dirt floor]]\nAlthough the law did not recognize slave marriages, Washington did, and by 1799 some two-thirds of the adult slaves at Mount Vernon were married.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 128</ref> To minimize time lost in getting to the workplace and thus increase productivity, slaves were accommodated at the farm on which they worked. Because of the unequal distribution of males and females across the five farms, slaves often found partners on different farms, and in their day to day lives husbands were routinely separated from their wives and children. Only thirty-six of the ninety-six married slaves at Mount Vernon in 1799 lived together, while thirty-eight had spouses who lived on separate farms and twenty-two had spouses who lived on other plantations.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 122</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 132\u2013133</ref> The evidence suggests couples that were separated did not regularly visit during the week, and doing so prompted complaints from Washington that slaves were too exhausted to work after such \"night walking\", leaving Saturday nights/Sundays and holidays as the main time such families could spend together.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 134, 136, 202</ref> Despite the stress and anxiety caused by this indifference to family stability{{snd}}on one occasion an overseer wrote that the separation of families \"seems like death to them\"{{snd}}marriage was the foundation on which slaves established their own community, and longevity in these unions was not uncommon.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 127, 130\u2013131, 132</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 123</ref>\n\nLarge families that covered multiple generations, along with their attendant marriages, were part of a slave community-building process that transcended ownership. Washington's head carpenter Isaac, for example, lived with his wife Kitty, a dower-slave milkmaid, at Mansion House Farm. The couple had nine daughters ranging in age from six to twenty-seven in 1799, and the marriages of four of those daughters had extended the family to other farms within and outside the Mount Vernon estate and produced three grandchildren.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\">Thompson 2019 p. 135</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 p. 421</ref> Children were born into slavery, their ownership determined by the ownership of their mothers.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 309\">Thompson 2019 p. 309</ref> The value attached to the birth of a slave child, if it was noted at all, is indicated in the weekly report of one overseer, which stated, \"Increase 9 Lambs & 1 male child of Lynnas.\" New mothers received a new blanket and three to five weeks of light duties to recover. An infant remained with its mother at her place of work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 151\u2013152</ref> Older children, the majority of whom lived in single-parent households in which the mother worked from dawn to dusk, performed small family chores but were otherwise left to play largely unsupervised until they reached an age when they could begin to be put to work for Washington, usually somewhere between eleven and fourteen years old.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 158\u2013160</ref> In 1799, nearly sixty percent of the slave population was under nineteen years old and nearly thirty-five percent under nine.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\"/>\n\nThere is evidence that slaves passed on their African cultural values through telling stories, among them the tales of [[Br'er Rabbit]] which, with their origins in Africa and stories of a powerless individual triumphing through wit and intelligence over powerful authority, would have resonated with the slaves.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 203</ref> African-born slaves brought with them some of the religious rituals of their ancestral home, and there is an undocumented tradition of voodoo being practiced at one of the Mount Vernon farms.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 211\u2013213</ref> Although the slave condition made it impossible to adhere to the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], some slave names betray a Muslim cultural origin.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 213\u2013214</ref> [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] reached out to American-born slaves in Virginia, and some of the Mount Vernon slaves are known to have been christened before Washington acquired the estate. There is evidence in the historical record from 1797 that Mount Vernon slaves had contacts with [[Baptists]], [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Quakers]].<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 208\u2013209</ref> The three religions advocated abolition, raising hopes of freedom among the slaves, and the congregation of the Alexandria Baptist Church, founded in 1803, included slaves formerly owned by Washington.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 209, 210\u2013211</ref>\n\n===Mulattoes===\nIn 1799 there were some twenty [[mulatto]] (mixed race) slaves at Mount Vernon. The probability of paternal relationships between slaves and hired white workers is indicated by some surnames: Betty and Tom Davis, probably the children of Thomas Davis, a white weaver at Mount Vernon in the 1760s; George Young, likely the son of a man of the same name who was a clerk at Mount Vernon in 1774; and [[Oney Judge]] and her sister Delphy, the daughters of Andrew Judge, an indentured tailor at Mount Vernon in the 1770s and 1780s.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 138\u2013139</ref> There is evidence to suggest that white overseers{{snd}}working in close proximity to slaves under the same demanding master and physically and socially isolated from their own peer group, a situation that drove some to drink{{snd}}indulged in sexual relations with the slaves they supervised.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 140\u2013141</ref> Some white visitors to Mount Vernon seemed to have expected slave women to provide sexual favors.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 141\u2013142</ref> The living arrangements left some slave females alone and vulnerable, and the Mount Vernon research historian Mary V. Thompson writes that relationships \"could have been the result of mutual attraction and affection, very real demonstrations of power and control, or even exercises in the manipulation of an authority figure.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 140</ref>{{efn|There is an oral tradition among the descendants of the freedman [[West Ford (slave)|West Ford]] that he was the son of Washington and Venus, a slave belonging to Washington's brother [[John Augustine Washington]]. A case made by the historian Henry Wiencek is, according to the historian Philip Morgan, \"so circumstantial as to be fanciful,\" and there is no evidence that Washington ever met Venus, let alone fathered a child by her.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 147\u2013151</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 419, 420 n26</ref>}}\n\n===Resistance===\n[[File:Oney Judge Runaway Ad.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement placed in the ''Pennsylvania Gazette'' after Oney Judge absconded from the President's House in 1796|alt=Newspaper clipping]]\nThe frequent comments Washington made about \"rogueries\" and \"old tricks\" indicate the resistance displayed by the slaves against the system.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 261</ref> The most common act of resistance was theft, so common that Washington made allowances for it as part of normal wastage. Food was stolen both to supplement rations and to sell, and Washington believed the selling of tools was another source of income for slaves. Because cloth and clothing were commonly stolen, Washington required seamstresses to show the results of their work and the leftover scraps before issuing them with more material. Sheep were washed before shearing to prevent the theft of wool, and storage areas were kept locked and keys left with trusted individuals.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 269\u2013271</ref> In 1792, Washington ordered the culling of slaves' dogs he believed were being used in a spate of livestock theft and ruled that slaves who kept dogs without authorization were to be \"severely punished\" and their dogs hanged.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 201</ref>\n\nAnother means by which slaves resisted, one that was virtually impossible to prove, was feigning illness. Over the years Washington became increasingly skeptical about absenteeism due to sickness among his slaves and concerned about the diligence or ability of his overseers in recognizing genuine cases. Between 1792 and 1794, while Washington was away from Mount Vernon as President, the number of days lost to sickness increased tenfold compared to 1786, when he was resident at Mount Vernon and able to control the situation personally. In one case, Washington suspected a slave of frequently avoiding work over a period of decades through acts of deliberate self harm.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 261\u2013263, 264\u2013265</ref>\n\nSlaves asserted some independence and frustrated Washington by the pace and quality of their work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 105, 265</ref> In 1760, Washington noted that four of his carpenters quadrupled their output of timber under his personal supervision.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 93\u201394</ref> Thirty-five years later, he described his carpenters as an \"idle...set of rascals\" who would take a month or more to complete at Mount Vernon work that was being done in two or three days in [[Philadelphia]]. The output of seamstresses dropped off when Martha was away, and spinners found they could slacken by playing the overseers off against her.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266\u2013267</ref> Tools were regularly lost or damaged, thus stopping work, and Washington despaired of employing innovations that might improve efficiency because he believed the slaves were too clumsy to operate the new machinery involved.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266, 268</ref>\n\nThe most emphatic act of resistance was to run away, and between 1760 and 1799 at least forty-seven slaves under Washington's control did so.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 275</ref> Seventeen of these, fourteen men and three women, escaped to a British warship that anchored in the [[Potomac River]] near Mount Vernon in 1781.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 278, 279</ref> In general, the best chance of success lay with second- or third-generation African-American slaves who had good English, possessed skills that would allow them to support themselves as free people and were in close enough contact with their masters to receive special privileges. Thus it was that Judge, an especially talented seamstress, and Hercules escaped in 1796 and 1797 respectively and eluded recapture.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 281, 284\u2013286</ref> Washington took seriously the recapture of fugitives, and in three cases an escaped slave was sold off in the West Indies after recapture, effectively a death sentence in the severe conditions slaves had to endure there.<ref name=\"Wiencek 2003 p. 132\">Wiencek 2003 p. 132</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 411\u2013412</ref><ref>Chernow 2010 p. 161</ref>\n\n===Control===\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|salign=right\n|width=25%\n|quote=Slavery was a system in which enslaved people lived in fear; fear of being sold, fear of being separated from their families or their children or their parents, fear of not being in control of their bodies or their lives, fear of never knowing freedom.

By 1766, he had transitioned his business from the labor-intensive planting of tobacco to the less demanding farming of grain crops. His slaves were employed on a greater variety of tasks that needed more skills than tobacco planting required of them; as well as the cultivation of grains and vegetables, they were employed in cattle herding, spinning, weaving and carpentry. The transition left Washington with a surplus of slaves and revealed to him the inefficiencies of the slave labor system.<ref name=Morgan2005p413>Morgan 2005 p. 413</ref><ref name=Twohig118>Twohig 2001 p. 118</ref>\n\nThere is little evidence that Washington seriously questioned the ethics of slavery before the Revolution.<ref name=Twohig118 /> In the 1760s he often participated in tavern lotteries, events in which defaulters' debts were settled by raffling off their assets to a high-spirited crowd.<ref>Chernow 2010 p. 162</ref> In 1769, Washington co-managed one such lottery in which fifty-five slaves were sold, among them six families and five females with children. The more valuable married males were raffled together with their wives and children; less valuable slaves were separated from their families into different lots. Robin and Bella, for example, were raffled together as husband and wife while their children, twelve-year-old Sukey and seven-year-old Betty, were listed in a separate lot. Only chance dictated whether the family would remain together, and with 1,840 tickets on sale the odds were not good.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 178\u2013180</ref>\n\nThe historian [[Henry Wiencek]] concludes that the repugnance Washington felt at this cruelty in which he had participated prompted his decision not to break up slave families by sale or purchase, and marks the beginning of a transformation in Washington's thinking about the morality of slavery.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 135, 188</ref> Wiencek writes that in 1775 Washington took more slaves than he needed rather than break up the family of a slave he had agreed to accept in payment of a debt.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 188</ref> The historians [[Philip D.

Two years later, on taking command of the [[Continental Army]] at Cambridge at the start of the [[American Revolutionary War]], he wrote in orders to his troops that \"it is a noble Cause we are engaged in, it is the Cause of virtue and mankind...freedom or Slavery must be the result of our conduct.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 p.64</ref> The hypocrisy inherent in slave owners characterizing a war of independence as a struggle for their own freedom from slavery was not lost on the British writer [[Samuel Johnson]], who asked, \"How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of Negroes?\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 191</ref>\n\nWashington shared the common southern concern about arming African-Americans or slaves and initially refused to accept either into the ranks of the Continental Army. He reversed his position on the recruitment of free African-Americans when the royal governor of Virginia, [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], issued a [[Dunmore's Proclamation|proclamation]] in November 1775 offering freedom to rebel-owned slaves who enlisted in the British forces.

He sought to liberate himself from an economically unviable system, not to liberate his slaves. They were still a property from which he expected to profit. During a period of severe wartime depreciation, the question was not whether to sell his slaves, but when, where and how best to sell them.

Inspired by the rhetoric that had driven the revolution, it became popular to free slaves.

Six of them had been collated into an expensively bound volume titled ''Tracts on Slavery'', indicating that he attached some importance to that selection. Five of the six were published in or after 1788.{{efn|''Tracts on Slavery'' was one volume in a set of thirty-six that Washington had bound probably sometime after 1795. The volumes covered subjects that generally were of importance to him, such as agriculture, the Revolution, the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] and politics. The single pre-1788 pamphlet of the six in ''Tracts on Slavery'' was ''A Serious Address to the Rulers of America, on the Inconsistency of Their Conduct Respecting Slavery'', published in 1783. It was the first pamphlet in the volume, and Washington had written his signature on the cover, as he did with the first pamphlet in each of the thirty-six volumes. Of the eleven pamphlets on slavery that were, presumably, not considered to be worth binding, eight were published before 1788. One of them, published in 1785, was never read. The implication is that Washington became more interested in the subject in the early 1790s.<ref>Furstenberg 2011 pp. 251\u2013253, 260, 263\u2013264</ref>}} All six shared common themes that slaves first had to be educated about the obligations of liberty before they could be emancipated, a belief Washington is reported to have expressed himself in 1798, and that abolition should be realized by a gradual legislative process, an idea that began to appear in Washington's correspondence during the [[Confederation Period|Confederation period]].<ref>Furstenberg 2011 pp. 250\u2013253, 273\u2013275, 285</ref><ref name=\"Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 72\u201373\">Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 72\u201373</ref>\n\nWashington was not impressed by what Dorothy Twohig{{snd}}a former editor-in-chief of [[The Washington Papers]]{{snd}}described as the \"imperious demands\" and \"evangelical piety\" of Quaker efforts to advance abolition, and in 1786 he complained about their \"tamper[ing] with & seduc[ing]\" slaves who \"are happy & content to remain with their present masters.\"<ref>Twohig 2001 p. 129</ref><ref name=Morgan2005p419>Morgan 2005 p. 419</ref> Only the most radical of abolitionists called for immediate emancipation. The disruption to the labor market and the care of the elderly and infirm would have created enormous problems.

Gradual emancipation was seen as a way of mitigating against such a loss and reducing opposition from those with a financial self-interest in maintaining slavery.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 296\u2013297</ref>\n\nIn 1783, Lafayette proposed a joint venture to establish an experimental settlement for freed slaves which, with Washington's example, \"might render it a general practise{{sic}},\" but Washington demurred. As Lafayette forged ahead with his plan, Washington offered encouragement but expressed concern in 1786 about \"much inconvenience and mischief\" an abrupt emancipation might generate, and he gave no tangible support to the idea.<ref name=Morgan2005p417 /><ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 260\u2013263</ref>{{efn|The two discussed slavery when Lafayette visited Washington at Mount Vernon in August 1784, though Washington thought the time was not yet ripe for a resolution and questioned how a Virginia plantation could be run without slave labor. On returning to France, Lafayette purchased a plantation in the French colony of Cayenne, modern-day [[French Guiana]], and advised Washington of his progress by letter in 1786. Lafayette had taken concerns about the abrupt emancipation of slaves into account, paying and educating the slaves he settled on the plantation before freeing them. He became a leading figure in the French movement against the slave trade and a corresponding member of the British movement. Washington would not have known of Lafayette's antislavery activities in Cayenne or Europe from Lafayette himself; although the two continued to correspond for the rest of Washington's life, the subject of slavery virtually disappeared from their letters. The Cayenne experiment came to an end in 1792, when the plantation was sold by the French Revolutionary government after Lafayette's imprisonment by the Austrians.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 122\u2013128</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 261\u2013264</ref>}} Washington privately expressed support for emancipation to prominent Methodists [[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Thomas Coke]] and [[Francis Asbury]] in 1785, but declined to sign their petition.

He presided over the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787, during which it became obvious just how explosive the issue was and how willing the antislavery faction was to accept the preservation of slavery to ensure national unity and the establishment of a strong federal government. The support of the southern states for the new constitution was secured by granting them concessions that protected slavery, including the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]] and the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]], plus clauses that guaranteed the transatlantic slave trade for at least twenty years and federal aid for the suppression of any slave rebellion.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 422</ref><ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 124\u2013125</ref>\n\nWashington's preeminent position ensured that any actions he took with regard to his own slaves would become a statement in a national debate about slavery that threatened to divide the country. Wiencek suggests Washington considered making precisely such a statement on taking up the presidency in 1789. A passage in the notebook of Washington's biographer [[David Humphreys (soldier)|David Humphreys]]{{efn|Humphreys was a former aide to Washington and had begun an eighteen-month stay at Mount Vernon in 1787 to assist Washington with his correspondence and write his biography.<ref>Ellis 2004 p. 153</ref>}} dated to late 1788 or early 1789 recorded a statement that resembled the emancipation clause in Washington's will a decade later. Wiencek argues the passage was a draft for a public announcement Washington was considering in which he would declare the emancipation of some of his slaves. It marks, Wiencek believes, a moral epiphany in Washington's thinking, the moment he decided not only to emancipate his slaves but also to use the occasion to set the example Lafayette had urged in 1783.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\">Wiencek 2003 pp. 272\u2013275</ref> Other historians dispute Wiencek's conclusion; Henriques and [[Joseph Ellis]] concur with Philip Morgan's opinion that Washington experienced no epiphanies in a \"long and hard-headed struggle\" in which there was no single turning point. Morgan argues that Humphreys' passage is the \"private expression of remorse\" from a man unable to extricate himself from the \"tangled web\" of \"mutual dependency\" on slavery, and that Washington believed public comment on such a divisive subject was best avoided for the sake of national unity.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 421\u2013423, 425</ref><ref>Ellis 2004 p. 311 n22</ref><ref name=Henriques159 />{{efn|Wiencek bases his argument on the fact that the passage was written in the past tense and appears in Humphreys' notebook amid drafts Humphreys had written for public statements Washington was to make about assuming the presidency.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\" /> Philip Morgan points out that the passage was Humphreys' words in Washington's voice and appears just after a summary Humphreys had written of [[Thomas Clarkson]]'s 1788 ''An Essay on the Impolicy of the African Slave Trade''.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 423 n31</ref> Kenneth Morgan characterizes the passage as \"a remark made in [Washington's] voice by David Humphreys.\"<ref name=Morgan2000p298 /> Fritz Hirschfeld writes that the passage was written by Humphreys during direct dictation or from memory of Washington's exact words, and believes it highly improbable that they were not Washington's own words.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 213 n5</ref>}}\n\n====As President====\n{{See also|Presidency of George Washington}}\n[[File:George Washington 1795.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|''President George Washington'' by Gilbert Stuart (1795) |alt=Portrait painting]]\nWashington took up the presidency at a time when revolutionary sentiment against slavery was giving way to a resurgence of proslavery interests.

Washington concluded his instructions with a private passage in which he expressed repugnance at owning slaves and declared that the principal reason for selling the land was to raise the finances that would allow him to liberate them.<ref name=Twohig128 /><ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 273\u2013274</ref> It is the first clear indication that Washington's thinking had shifted from selling his slaves to freeing them.<ref name=Ellis257 /> In November the same year, Washington declared in a letter to his friend and neighbor Alexander Spotswood that he was \"...principled agt.{{sic}} selling Negroes, as you would Cattle in the market...\"<ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 128, 137 n45</ref><ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 16</ref>\n\nIn 1795 and 1796, Washington devised a complicated plan that involved renting out his western lands to tenant farmers to whom he would lease his own slaves, and a similar scheme to lease the dower slaves he controlled to Dr. [[David Stuart (Virginia politician)|David Stuart]] for work on Stuart's Eastern Shore plantation. This plan would have involved breaking up slave families, but it was designed with an end goal of raising enough finances to fund their eventual emancipation (a detail Washington kept secret) and prevent the Custis heirs from permanently splitting up families by sale.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 339\u2013342</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 303\u2013304</ref>{{efn|The dower slaves had already begun to be transferred to Martha's granddaughters as the Custis heirs married. [[Martha Parke Custis Peter|Young Martha]] brought sixty-one slaves to her marriage with Thomas Peter in 1795, [[Elizabeth Parke Custis Law|Eliza]] married [[Thomas Law (1756\u20131834)|Thomas Law]] the next year and [[Eleanor Parke Custis Lewis|Nelly]] was wed to [[Lawrence Lewis (1767\u20131839)|Lawrence Lewis]] in 1799. Peter had begun selling off slaves soon after his marriage, splitting up families and systematically separating girls as young as four years old from their parents. Wiencek suggests Martha's servant [[Oney Judge|Ona Judge]], who as a dower slave was destined to become Custis property, fled from Philadelphia in 1796 to avoid being sold.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 338\u2013342</ref>}} None of these schemes could be realized because of his failure to sell or rent land at the right prices, the refusal of the Custis heirs to agree to them and his own reluctance to separate families.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 423\u2013424</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 342</ref> Wiencek speculates that, because Washington gave such serious consideration to freeing his slaves knowing full well the political ramifications that would follow, one of his goals was to make a public statement that would sway opinion towards abolition.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 342\u2013343</ref> Philip Morgan argues that Washington freeing his slaves while President in 1794 or 1796 would have had no profound effect, and would have been greeted with public silence and private derision by white southerners.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 428\u2013429</ref>\n\nAs Washington subordinated his desire for emancipation to his efforts to secure financial independence, he took care to retain his slaves.<ref>Ellis 2004 pp. 258\u2013260</ref> In 1791, he arranged for those who served in his personal retinue while he was President in Philadelphia to be rotated out of the state before they became eligible for emancipation after six months residence per [[An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery|Pennsylvanian law]]. Not only would Washington have been deprived of their services if they were freed, most of the slaves he took with him to Philadelphia were dower slaves, which meant that he would have had to compensate the Custis estate for the loss. Because of his concerns for his public image and that the prospect of emancipation would generate discontent among the slaves before they became eligible for emancipation, he instructed that they be shuffled back to Mount Vernon \"under pretext that may deceive both them and the Public.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 59\u201360</ref>\n\nWashington spared no expense in efforts to recover Hercules and Judge when they absconded. In Judge's case, Washington persisted for three years. He tried to persuade her to return when his agent eventually tracked her to New Hampshire, but refused to promise her freedom after his death; \"However well disposed I might be to a gradual emancipation,\" he said, \"or even to an entire emancipation of that description of People (if the latter was in itself practicable at this moment) it would neither be politic or just to reward unfaithfulness with a premature preference.\" Both Hercules and Judge eluded capture.<ref name=\"Ellis 2004 p. 260\"/> Washington's search for a new chef to replace Hercules in 1797 is the last known instance in which he considered buying a slave, despite his resolve \"never to become the Master of another Slave by purchase\", though in the end he chose to hire a white chef.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 15</ref>\n\n==Posthumous emancipation==\n[[File:GW-will.jpg|thumb|Washington's will published in the Connecticut Journal, February 20, 1800|alt=newspaper clipping]]\nIn July 1799, five months before his death, Washington wrote his will, in which he stipulated that his slaves should be freed. In the months that followed, he considered a plan that betrayed a continuing prioritization of profit above his concerns about the institution of slavery. The plan involved repossessing tenancies in [[Berkeley County, West Virginia|Berkeley]] and [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick]] Counties and transferring half of his Mount Vernon slaves to work them. It would, Washington hoped, \"yield more nett profit\" which might \"benefit myself and not render the [slaves'] condition worse\", despite the disruption such relocation would have had on the slave families. The plan died with Washington on December 14, 1799.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 404, 424</ref>{{efn|Philip Morgan speculates on the unlikely possibility that, had the plan proved profitable, Washington might have changed his will and retracted the manumission of his slaves.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 425</ref>}}\n\nWashington's slaves were the subjects of the longest provisions in the twenty-nine-page will, taking three pages in which his instructions were more forceful than in the rest of the document. His valet, William Lee, was freed immediately and his remaining 123 slaves were to be emancipated on the death of Martha.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 5</ref><ref name=Morgan2005p404 /> The deferral was intended to postpone the pain of separation that would occur when his slaves were freed but their spouses among the dower slaves remained in bondage, a situation which affected twenty couples and their children. It is possible Washington hoped Martha and her heirs who would inherit the dower slaves would solve this problem by following his example and emancipating them.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 354</ref><ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 216</ref><ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 309\"/> Those too old or infirm to work were to be supported by his estate, as mandated by state law. Washington went beyond the legal requirement to support and maintain younger slaves until adulthood, stipulating that those children whose education could not be undertaken by parents were to be taught reading, writing and a useful trade by their masters and then be freed at the age of twenty-five.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 294</ref> Washington was particularly pointed in forbidding the sale or transportation of any of his slaves out of Virginia before their emancipation.<ref name=Morgan2005p404 /> Including the Dandridge slaves, who were emancipated under similar terms, more than 160 slaves were freed.<ref name=\"Morgan2005pp404\u2013405\" /><ref name=gwpapers /> Although he was not alone among Virginian slaveowners in freeing their slaves, he was the only Founding Father to do so.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 427</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Slave Memorial - Mt. Vernon.jpg|thumb|right|Slave burial ground memorial at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph]]\nAny hopes Washington may have had that his example and prestige would influence the thinking of others, including his own family, proved to be unfounded.

Other factors that may have influenced her decision to free Washington's slaves early include concerns about the expense of maintaining slaves that were not necessary to operate the estate and about discontent among the dower slaves if they continued to mix with slaves who were to be freed.<ref>Schwartz 2017 pp. 29\u201333</ref>}}\n\nAble-bodied slaves were freed and left to support themselves and their families.<ref>Schwartz 2017 pp. 34\u201335</ref> Within a few months, almost all of Washington's former slaves had left Mount Vernon, leaving 121 adult and working-age children still working the estate. Five freedwomen were listed as remaining: an unmarried mother of two children; two women, one of them with three children, married to Washington slaves too old to work; and two women who were married to dower slaves.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 311\u2013312</ref> William Lee remained at Mount Vernon, where he worked as a shoemaker.<ref>Schwartz 2017 p. 27</ref> After Martha's death on May 22, 1802, most of the remaining dower slaves passed to her grandson, [[George Washington Parke Custis]], to whom she bequeathed the only slave she held in her own name.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 341, 358</ref>\n\nThere are few records of how the newly freed slaves fared.<ref>Schwartz 2017 p. 35</ref> Custis later wrote that \"although many of them, with a view to their liberation, had been instructed in mechanic trades, yet they succeeded very badly as freemen; so true is the axiom, 'that the hour which makes man a slave, takes half his worth away'.\" The son-in-law of Custis's sister wrote in 1853 that the descendants of those who remained slaves, many of them now in his possession, had been \"prosperous, contented and happy,\" while those who had been freed had led a life of \"vice, dissipation and idleness\" and had, in their \"sickness, age and poverty\", become a burden to his in-laws.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 316</ref> Such reports were influenced by the innate racism of the well-educated, upper-class authors and ignored the social and legal impediments that prejudiced the chances of prosperity for former slaves, which included laws that made it illegal to teach freedpeople to read and write and, in 1806, required newly freed slaves to leave the state.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 317, 449 n83</ref><ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 215</ref>\n\nThere is evidence that some of Washington's former slaves were able to buy land, support their families and prosper as free people. By 1812, Free Town in [[Truro Parish, Virginia|Truro Parish]], the earliest known free African-American settlement in Fairfax County, contained seven households of former Washington slaves. By the mid 1800s, a son of Washington's carpenter Davy Jones and two grandsons of his [[postilion]] Joe Richardson had each bought land in Virginia. Francis Lee, younger brother of William, was well known and respected enough to have his obituary printed in the ''Alexandria Gazette'' on his death at Mount Vernon in 1821. Sambo Anderson{{snd}}who hunted game, as he had while Washington's slave, and prospered for a while by selling it to the most respectable families in Alexandria{{snd}}was similarly noted by the ''Gazette'' when he died near Mount Vernon in 1845.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 317\u2013319</ref> Research published in 2019 has concluded that Hercules worked as a cook in New York, where he died on May 15, 1812.<ref>Ganeshram 2019</ref>\n\nA decade after Washington's death, the Pennsylvanian jurist [[Richard Peters (Continental Congress)|Richard Peters]] wrote that Washington's servants \"were devoted to him; and especially those more immediately about his person. The survivors of them still venerate and adore his memory.\" In his old age, Anderson said he was \"a much happier man when he was a slave than he had ever been since,\" because he then \"had a good kind master to look after all my wants, but now I have no one to care for me.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 322\u2013323</ref> When Judge was interviewed in the 1840s, she expressed considerable bitterness, not at the way she he had been treated as a slave, but at the fact that she had been enslaved.

Washington \"disdained to hold his fellow-creatures in abject domestic servitude,\" wrote the Massachusetts Federalist [[Timothy Bigelow (lawyer)|Timothy Bigelow]] before calling on \"fellow-citizens in the South\" to emulate Washington's example. In this narrative, Washington was a proto-abolitionist who, having added the freedom of his slaves to the freedom from British slavery he had won for the nation, would be mobilized to serve the antislavery cause.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 84\u201386</ref>\n\nAn alternative narrative more in line with proslavery sentiments embraced rather than excised Washington's ownership of slaves. Washington was cast as a paternal figure, the benevolent father not only of his country but also of a family of slaves bound to him by affection rather than coercion.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 92\u201394</ref> In this narrative, slaves idolized Washington and wept at his deathbed, and in an 1807 biography, [[Aaron Bancroft]] wrote, \"In domestick{{sic}} and private life, he blended the authority of the master with the care and kindness of the guardian and friend.\"<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 94, 96\u201397</ref> The competing narratives allowed both [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] and [[Confederate States of America|South]] to claim Washington as the father of their countries during the [[American Civil War]] that ended slavery more than half a century after his death.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 100\u2013101</ref>\n\n===Memorial===\nIn 1929, a plaque was embedded in the ground at Mount Vernon less than {{convert|50|yd|m|round=5}} from the crypt housing the remains of Washington and Martha, marking a plot neglected by both groundsmen and tourist guides where slaves had been buried in unmarked graves. The inscription read, \"In memory of the many faithful colored servants of the Washington family, buried at Mount Vernon from 1760 to 1860. Their unidentified graves surround this spot.\" The site remained untended and ignored in the visitor literature until the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association erected a more prominent monument surrounded with plantings and inscribed, \"In memory of the Afro Americans who served as slaves at Mount Vernon this monument marking their burial ground dedicated September 21, 1983.\" In 1985, a [[ground-penetrating radar]] survey identified sixty-six possible burials.
