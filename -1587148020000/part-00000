He was raised in both Mexico and in the United States, and is fluent in both Spanish, and in English. Most of his songs are in Spanish, but he has released songs in English as well.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nHaving come from a musical family, Lorenzo Antonio was exposed to music as soon as he was born. By the age of 5, Antonio's interest in music was very apparent, and his father taught him how to sing \"[[La Bamba (song)|La Bamba]]\", while accompanying himself on the guitar. He learned this very quickly, and Lorenzo's parents decided to place him in private classical guitar lessons, which he studied from his childhood through his teen years.<ref>Revista [[Notitas Musicales]] 1983</ref>\n\nThroughout his childhood, Antonio briefly studied the violin, [[banjo]], and piano, as well as the cello, which he played throughout elementary school, middle school, and high school. During these early years, Lorenzo also displayed great vocal and performing abilities and on occasion, his father, Amador S\u00e1nchez, also known as the very successful singer / songwriter / producer, [[Tiny Morrie]], would present Lorenzo onstage at his performances.\n\n===Career===\n\nLorenzo Antonio's career began in June 1982 when at age 12, he and his 4 sisters (Ver\u00f3nica, Rosamaria, Kristyna, and Carolina) won 1st place in one of the most important talent festivals in all of Latin America, \"[[Juguemos a Cantar|1er Festival Juguemos A Cantar]],\" which was held in [[Mexico City]] and transmitted by [[Televisa]] on the immensely popular television show, \"[[Siempre en domingo]].\" They appeared in the competition as \"Lorenzo Antonio Y Su Grupo\" (Lorenzo Antonio and His Group), and performed Antonio's composition, \"Vamos A Jugar.\"\n\nFor winning this competition, Antonio was awarded 3 appearances on \"Siempre En Domingo,\" as well as a record contract with [[Musart Records|Discos Musart]]. This exposure launched Antonio's career, and by the end of 1982, he had become one of the most successful and famous Latin artists of that time, recognized immensely for playing the violin, the uniforms that he and his sisters wore (sailor caps and [[Bell-bottoms|bellbottom pants]]), as well as for the choreography that he and his 4 sisters performed to his song, \"Vamos A Jugar,\" which was a song about a dance move, \"la mano izquierda va adelante y la derecha para atras\" (the left hand goes to the front and the right hand goes to the back).\n\nAs Antonio entered his teen years, he separated from his sisters and continued his career as a soloist. At that time, this was a controversial change due to the group's popularity, and many of their fans did not like this. Ultimately, the change proved to be a great success for Antonio and his sisters. Antonio's popularity continued to grow, and he became one of the most successful and popular singer / songwriters of the 1980s and 1990s. His 4 sisters continued for a few years as the children's group, \"Chikis,\" and some years later, became the internationally successful and famous girl group, \"[[Sparx (US band)|Sparx]].\"\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, Antonio toured Mexico, Central America, South America, and the United States extensively. Most of his international hits came during this time period. Among the most popular are, \"Vamos A Jugar,\" \"Muchachita,\" \"Como Me Gustas,\" \"Busco Un Amor,\" \"Dile,\" \"No Llorare,\" \"Buscare\" (peaked at #7 on Billboard's Top Latin Song chart, May 14, 1988),<ref>[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Magazine]], May 1988</ref> \"El No Te Quiere\" (peaked at #9 on Billboard's Top Latin Song chart, April 12, 1997),<ref>[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Magazine]], April 1997</ref> \"No Quieren Que Te Quiera\" (peaked at #16 on Billboard's Top Latin Song chart, August 16, 1997),<ref>[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Magazine]], August 1997</ref> and \"Como Cuando Y Porque\" (peaked at #12 on Billboard's Top Latin Song chart, July 16, 1994),<ref>[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Magazine]], July 1994</ref> which was an original song written and given to him by Mexican singer / songwriter, [[Juan Gabriel]]. In 1987, Antonio scored what is considered to be his greatest hit, and one of the most successful [[Billboard Hot Latin Hits|Latin ballads of the 1980s]], the now classic ballad, \"[[Billboard Top Latin Songs Year-End Chart|Doce Rosas]].\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/billboard-hot-latin-hits-the-80s-vol-1-mw0000034080|title=Billboard Hot Latin Hits: The 80's, Vol. 1 - Various Artists &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> On May 23, 1987, Doce Rosas reached #3 on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Magazine's]] Top Latin Songs chart.<ref>[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Magazine]], May 1987</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s and after a 2-year college stint at the [[University of New Mexico]], Lorenzo Antonio signed with a new record company, [[Warner Music Group]]. At this time, he also met [[Juan Gabriel]] and had a successful comeback with the albums, \"Mi Tributo A Juan Gabriel,\" and \"Tributo 2.\"\n\nIn the mid 1990s, Antonio focused his attention on his sisters, Sparx. They were starting to gain notoriety in the Latin market in the United States, and Antonio spent his time writing songs for them.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Antonio signed a record deal with [[Fonovisa Records]]. The albums that Antonio released at this time were geared more to the [[Regional Mexican]] market, and Antonio's record sales were among the highest of his career.\n\n====Songwriter====\nNot only has Lorenzo Antonio written many of his hit records, (\"Vamos A Jugar,\" \"Como Me Gustas,\" \"Lagrimas De Juventud\" \"Busco Un Amor,\" \"No Quieren Que Te Quiera,\" and others), but also hits for other artists as well. Some of the most outstanding are: \"El Baile De La Gallina\" performed by [[w:es:Tatiana|Tatiana]], \"Te Amo Te Amo Te Amo,\" \"Los Hijos De Pantaleon,\" and \"El De Los Ojos Negros,\" performed by his sisters, [[Sparx (US band)|Sparx]].\n\n====Other styles====\nWhile Lorenzo Antonio is most known internationally for interpreting romantic ballads, he has also been very successful interpreting [[New Mexico music]], [[Ranchera]], [[Mariachi|Mariachi music]], and [[Corrido]].\n\nLorenzo Antonio has also released several albums in the Ranchera genre that feature his guitar playing. One of the songs featured on his Ranchera albums, \"Ranchera Jam\" featured a [[Mashup (music)|mashup]] of him performing [[New Mexico music|New Mexico style]] version of Mexican staples like \"[[Cielito Lindo]]\" and [[Tito Gu\u00edzar]]'s \"[[All\u00e1 en el Rancho Grande (song)|All\u00e1 en el Rancho Grande]]\" and [[Country music]] classics [[Johnny Cash]]'s \"[[Folsom Prison Blues]]\" and [[Hank Williams]]' \"[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)]]\".\n\nHe participated with his sisters, Sparx, on the certified platinum albums, \"Cantan Corridos\" (peaked at #5 on Billboard's Top Regional Mexican Albums chart on February 8, 1997),<ref>[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Magazine]], February 1997</ref> and \"Cantan Corridos Vol. 2,\" which are two of the most successful albums of his career.\n\n====Duets and other collaborations====\nIn 1987, Lorenzo Antonio performed a duet of the song, \"El Idioma Del Amor,\" also known in English as \"We've Got Tonight,\" with Italian singer [[Fiordaliso]].\n\nIn 1988, Lorenzo Antonio collaborated with [[Joan Sebastian]], [[Lisa Lopez]], Los Joao, and Byanka, on the song, \"El Amigo Es,\" written by [[Enzo Malepasso]], and Joan Sebastian.\n\nIn 2014, Lorenzo Antonio performed a duet with [[Ana B\u00e1rbara]] of the song \"Caray\", which was filmed live and released as a video.\n\nIn 2016, Lorenzo Antonio performed a duet with [[Yolanda del R\u00edo]] of the song \"[[Se Me Olvid\u00f3 Otra Vez]]\" as a tribute to their friend, Juan Gabriel, just days after his death. This performance was filmed live and released as a video and as an audio single.\n\n==Charity work==\nLorenzo Antonio and his sisters, Sparx, established a non-profit foundation in 2001. Known as \"[[The Sparx and Lorenzo Antonio Foundation]],\" its primary purpose is to provide scholarships to students, and to encourage higher education. Every year since its inception, Lorenzo Antonio and Sparx have held at least one concert where funds are raised for \"The Sparx and Lorenzo Scholarship.\" This scholarship is also awarded yearly. Since 2001, Lorenzo Antonio and Sparx have awarded approximately $1,000,000 in scholarships to students.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=http://sparxlorenzoantonio.org/|title=Home|website=Sparxlorenzoantonio.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.merinews.com/article/sparx-and-lorenzo-antonio-of-new-mexico/148054.shtml|title=MerriNews: Sparx and Lorenzo Antonio of New Mexico|website=Merinews.com|access-date=February 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005132243/http://www.merinews.com/article/sparx-and-lorenzo-antonio-of-new-mexico/148054.shtml|archive-date=October 5, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural impact==\n===Mexico===\nIn Mexico, there was an explosion of child entertainers that began in the early 1980s with acts like the Spanish group, [[Parch\u00eds (group)|Parch\u00eds]], [[Lucero (entertainer)|Lucerito]], [[Luis Miguel]], [[Timbiriche]], [[Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez (singer)|Pedrito Fernandez]], and [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]]. This cultural phenomenon of child entertainers was boosted even further with the broadcast of the \"[[Juguemos a Cantar|1er Festival Juguemos A Cantar]],\" on \"Siempre En Domingo\". Due to the fact that Lorenzo Antonio Y Su Grupo won 1st place, they were at the forefront of the explosion of young talent at that time.\n\nImmediately after Lorenzo Antonio Y Su Grupo were announced the winners of the 1er Festival Juguemos A Cantar, an immediate controversy ensued: Another finalist, [[Juanito Farias]], who was also very popular and also a favorite to win the contest, came in last place. This was a major surprise to everyone and before the show ended, Raul Velasco, named Juanito Farias, \"El Mejor Interprete Del Festival\" (The Best Interpreter of the Festival). All of this stirred up much controversy and almost everyone had an opinion on the matter. Many felt that Juanito was robbed of 1st place, while many others felt that Lorenzo Antonio Y Su Grupo won 1st place fair and square. That argument continues to this day, and it can be seen in various forums and comments on YouTube and other places on the Internet.\n\n===United States===\nThe financial help that Lorenzo Antonio has provided, along with his sisters, Sparx, via their foundation to New Mexico students, has had a substantial impact on the lives of many young adults. Many of the recipients of the Sparx & Lorenzo Antonio Scholarship have stated that they would have never been able to afford a higher education had it not been for the scholarship they were awarded.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\n===Family===\nLorenzo Antonio's career has always been tightly intertwined with his family. His sisters, [[Sparx (US band)|Sparx]], and he perform regularly together, as well as collaborate with each other on their recordings, and in their musical business ventures.\n\nAntonio also descends from a very musical family tree. On his paternal side, Antonio's father, Amador S\u00e1nchez, known artistically as [[Tiny Morrie]], was a very successful singer, and continues to be a very successful songwriter and producer. Antonio also has two paternal uncles ([[Al Hurricane]] and [[Baby Gaby]]) that are musicians. Antonio's paternal grandparents also had a great love for music, and both of them played instruments and sang. Antonio's granduncles also were musicians.\n\nOn Antonio's maternal side, his mother, Maria De Lourdes Gloria Pohl, known artistically as [[Gloria Pohl]], had success in the southwestern part of the United States as a singer. Antonio also has 12 maternal uncles and almost all of them were or are musicians, as well as his maternal grandfather.\n\n===Relationships===\nUntil recently, not much was known about Lorenzo Antonio's romantic life. There were rumors that he dated several artists, such as [[Lolita Cortez]] and [[Lucero (entertainer)|Lucero]] in the 1980s, but none of these rumors were ever substantiated.\n\nAntonio married in 2004, but divorced less than a year later. There were no children from that marriage.\n\nIn 2010, Antonio appeared on a television show called ''Duetos'', which was televised by [[Estrella TV]]. There, he met singer, [[Graciela Beltran]]. They had a much-publicized romance, and they appeared on several Latin television shows together, such as [[Ventaneando]],<ref>[[Ventaneando]], August 18, 2010</ref> and [[Escandalo tv]].<ref>[[Escandalo tv]], November 25, 2010</ref> But for unknown reasons, their relationship ended abruptly after only 6 months in 2011.<ref>[[\u00a1Despierta Am\u00e9rica!]], June 24, 2011</ref>\n\n===Fitness===\nIn 2005, Lorenzo Antonio started suffering from [[sciatica]] pain caused by a [[Spinal disc herniation|bulging disc]] in his lower back. The pain was so severe and debilitating that he even considered back surgery. In 2007, he began working with a [[personal trainer]]. At the advice of his trainer, Antonio changed his diet and exercise habits, and within 1 year, Antonio was almost 100% back to normal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lorenzoantonio.com/|title=The Official Lorenzo Antonio Website &#124; The album Ayer Y Hoy is available now.

Some of the most outstanding are: \"El Baile De La Gallina\" performed by [[w:es:Tatiana|Tatiana]], \"Te Amo Te Amo Te Amo,\" \"Los Hijos De Pantaleon,\" and \"El De Los Ojos Negros,\" performed by his sisters, [[Sparx (US band)|Sparx]].\n\n====Other styles====\nWhile Lorenzo Antonio is most known internationally for interpreting romantic ballads, he has also been very successful interpreting [[New Mexico music]], [[Ranchera]], [[Mariachi|Mariachi music]], and [[Corrido]].\n\nLorenzo Antonio has also released several albums in the Ranchera genre that feature his guitar playing. One of the songs featured on his Ranchera albums, \"Ranchera Jam\" featured a [[Mashup (music)|mashup]] of him performing [[New Mexico music|New Mexico style]] version of Mexican staples like \"[[Cielito Lindo]]\" and [[Tito Gu\u00edzar]]'s \"[[All\u00e1 en el Rancho Grande (song)|All\u00e1 en el Rancho Grande]]\" and [[Country music]] classics [[Johnny Cash]]'s \"[[Folsom Prison Blues]]\" and [[Hank Williams]]' \"[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)]]\".\n\nHe participated with his sisters, Sparx, on the certified platinum albums, \"Cantan Corridos\" (peaked at #5 on Billboard's Top Regional Mexican Albums chart on February 8, 1997),<ref>[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Magazine]], February 1997</ref> and \"Cantan Corridos Vol. 2,\" which are two of the most successful albums of his career.\n\n====Duets and other collaborations====\nIn 1987, Lorenzo Antonio performed a duet of the song, \"El Idioma Del Amor,\" also known in English as \"We've Got Tonight,\" with Italian singer [[Fiordaliso]].\n\nIn 1988, Lorenzo Antonio collaborated with [[Joan Sebastian]], [[Lisa Lopez]], Los Joao, and Byanka, on the song, \"El Amigo Es,\" written by [[Enzo Malepasso]], and Joan Sebastian.\n\nIn 2014, Lorenzo Antonio performed a duet with [[Ana B\u00e1rbara]] of the song \"Caray\", which was filmed live and released as a video.\n\nIn 2016, Lorenzo Antonio performed a duet with [[Yolanda del R\u00edo]] of the song \"[[Se Me Olvid\u00f3 Otra Vez]]\" as a tribute to their friend, Juan Gabriel, just days after his death. This performance was filmed live and released as a video and as an audio single.\n\n==Charity work==\nLorenzo Antonio and his sisters, Sparx, established a non-profit foundation in 2001. Known as \"[[The Sparx and Lorenzo Antonio Foundation]],\" its primary purpose is to provide scholarships to students, and to encourage higher education. Every year since its inception, Lorenzo Antonio and Sparx have held at least one concert where funds are raised for \"The Sparx and Lorenzo Scholarship.\" This scholarship is also awarded yearly. Since 2001, Lorenzo Antonio and Sparx have awarded approximately $1,000,000 in scholarships to students.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=http://sparxlorenzoantonio.org/|title=Home|website=Sparxlorenzoantonio.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.merinews.com/article/sparx-and-lorenzo-antonio-of-new-mexico/148054.shtml|title=MerriNews: Sparx and Lorenzo Antonio of New Mexico|website=Merinews.com|access-date=February 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005132243/http://www.merinews.com/article/sparx-and-lorenzo-antonio-of-new-mexico/148054.shtml|archive-date=October 5, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural impact==\n===Mexico===\nIn Mexico, there was an explosion of child entertainers that began in the early 1980s with acts like the Spanish group, [[Parch\u00eds (group)|Parch\u00eds]], [[Lucero (entertainer)|Lucerito]], [[Luis Miguel]], [[Timbiriche]], [[Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez (singer)|Pedrito Fernandez]], and [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]]. This cultural phenomenon of child entertainers was boosted even further with the broadcast of the \"[[Juguemos a Cantar|1er Festival Juguemos A Cantar]],\" on \"Siempre En Domingo\". Due to the fact that Lorenzo Antonio Y Su Grupo won 1st place, they were at the forefront of the explosion of young talent at that time.\n\nImmediately after Lorenzo Antonio Y Su Grupo were announced the winners of the 1er Festival Juguemos A Cantar, an immediate controversy ensued: Another finalist, [[Juanito Farias]], who was also very popular and also a favorite to win the contest, came in last place. This was a major surprise to everyone and before the show ended, Raul Velasco, named Juanito Farias, \"El Mejor Interprete Del Festival\" (The Best Interpreter of the Festival). All of this stirred up much controversy and almost everyone had an opinion on the matter. Many felt that Juanito was robbed of 1st place, while many others felt that Lorenzo Antonio Y Su Grupo won 1st place fair and square. That argument continues to this day, and it can be seen in various forums and comments on YouTube and other places on the Internet.\n\n===United States===\nThe financial help that Lorenzo Antonio has provided, along with his sisters, Sparx, via their foundation to New Mexico students, has had a substantial impact on the lives of many young adults. Many of the recipients of the Sparx & Lorenzo Antonio Scholarship have stated that they would have never been able to afford a higher education had it not been for the scholarship they were awarded.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\n===Family===\nLorenzo Antonio's career has always been tightly intertwined with his family. His sisters, [[Sparx (US band)|Sparx]], and he perform regularly together, as well as collaborate with each other on their recordings, and in their musical business ventures.\n\nAntonio also descends from a very musical family tree. On his paternal side, Antonio's father, Amador S\u00e1nchez, known artistically as [[Tiny Morrie]], was a very successful singer, and continues to be a very successful songwriter and producer. Antonio also has two paternal uncles ([[Al Hurricane]] and [[Baby Gaby]]) that are musicians. Antonio's paternal grandparents also had a great love for music, and both of them played instruments and sang. Antonio's granduncles also were musicians.\n\nOn Antonio's maternal side, his mother, Maria De Lourdes Gloria Pohl, known artistically as [[Gloria Pohl]], had success in the southwestern part of the United States as a singer. Antonio also has 12 maternal uncles and almost all of them were or are musicians, as well as his maternal grandfather.\n\n===Relationships===\nUntil recently, not much was known about Lorenzo Antonio's romantic life. There were rumors that he dated several artists, such as [[Lolita Cortez]] and [[Lucero (entertainer)|Lucero]] in the 1980s, but none of these rumors were ever substantiated.\n\nAntonio married in 2004, but divorced less than a year later. There were no children from that marriage.\n\nIn 2010, Antonio appeared on a television show called ''Duetos'', which was televised by [[Estrella TV]]. There, he met singer, [[Graciela Beltran]]. They had a much-publicized romance, and they appeared on several Latin television shows together, such as [[Ventaneando]],<ref>[[Ventaneando]], August 18, 2010</ref> and [[Escandalo tv]].<ref>[[Escandalo tv]], November 25, 2010</ref> But for unknown reasons, their relationship ended abruptly after only 6 months in 2011.<ref>[[\u00a1Despierta Am\u00e9rica!]], June 24, 2011</ref>\n\n===Fitness===\nIn 2005, Lorenzo Antonio started suffering from [[sciatica]] pain caused by a [[Spinal disc herniation|bulging disc]] in his lower back. The pain was so severe and debilitating that he even considered back surgery. In 2007, he began working with a [[personal trainer]]. At the advice of his trainer, Antonio changed his diet and exercise habits, and within 1 year, Antonio was almost 100% back to normal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lorenzoantonio.com/|title=The Official Lorenzo Antonio Website &#124; The album Ayer Y Hoy is available now.

Created by [[William J. Bell]], the character was portrayed by [[Scott Reeves]], who made his first appearance On June 26, 1991 as a businessman who wanted to \"work his way to the top of the corporation ladder\". The character gained popularity upon his relationship with [[Victoria Newman]] ([[Heather Tom]]), which initially received criticism due to the characters' [[age gap]]. He was also involved with [[Nina Webster]] ([[Tricia Cast]]) and the insane [[The Young and the Restless characters (1990s)#Tricia Dennison McNeil|Tricia Dennison]] ([[Sabryn Genet]]).\n\nReeves, who described Ryan as a \"go-getter\" who was \"shrewd\" and a \"charmer\", found his seduction storyline with Victoria hard to \"play out\" considering her age. In October 2001, the actor announced his exit from ''The Young and the Restless'', stating it was to pursue other projects. The producers kept quiet about the storyline surrounding his exit, although confirmed that he would depart \"in a big way\". Within the story, Ryan prepared to remarry Victoria but Tricia, his ex-wife, attempted to shoot her and Ryan took two bullets and died from the injury. Throughout his time on the soap opera, Reeves became popular with fans as one of the genre's leading men, garnering multiple awards and nominations.\n\n==Casting==\nReeves first appeared as Ryan in May 1991, on contract. In March 2000, it was announced that Reeves had signed a three-year contract deal with [[Sony Pictures]], which would have furthered his portrayal until 2003.<ref>{{cite news|title=Genet and Reeves will return in Y&R roles |first=Lynda |last=Hirsch |newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel]] |date=March 27, 2000 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Havens |first=Candace |title=''Real transitions for several soap stars'' |date=May 21, 2000 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CKVEAAAAIBAJ&sjid=t7UMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4032,2870567&dq=scott+reeves+leaving+the+young+and+the+restless&hl=en |accessdate=April 14, 2013 |newspaper=[[The Durant Daily Democrat]]}}</ref> However, by August 2001, reports began to surface that Reeves had been released from his contract and would be exiting in a \"storyline-dictated\" departure, during the [[Nielsen ratings|November sweeps]] period.<ref name=\"Reeves Out\">{{cite web|last=J Kroll|first=Dan|title=Scott Reeves, Ryan out at Y&R|url=http://soapcentral.com/yr/news/2001/0917-reeves.php|publisher=Soap Central|accessdate=April 20, 2013|date=August 17, 2001}}</ref> In October, Reeves officially announced his exit from the soap opera, stating that it was to pursue other projects.

The two fell in love and married to Victor's dismay, however, Victoria refused to consummate their relationship and Ryan cheated on her with Nina Webster. Victoria divorced him, and he then moved in with Nina and her son, [[Chance Chancellor|Phillip Chancellor IV]] ([[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]]), and he later married Nina out of obligation. He eventually developed genuine feelings for Nina, however, she fell in love with novelist [[Cole Howard]] ([[J. Eddie Peck]]). After Nina was rejected by him, she had a nervous breakdown causing Ryan to sleep with [[Tricia Dennison]] ([[Sabryn Genet]]). Nina then tried to commit suicide and shot herself in a struggle with Ryan, and he was arrested for her shooting. Nina suffered short term amnesia, and although she regained her memory and exonerated Ryan, they divorced. Ryan then ended up marrying Tricia, much to the disapproval of her father Keith Dennison (David Allen Brooks). However, Tricia was very jealous of Ryan's relationship with Phillip, who accused her of breaking apart his family. In desperation, Tricia stopped taking her birth control pills and they conceived a child, to which Ryan was against though warmed up to the idea. When she miscarried, Tricia saw it as her punishment for deceiving her husband.\n\nTricia then became obsessed with destroying her sister [[Megan Dennison]]'s ([[Ashley Jones]]) relationship with [[Tony Viscardi]] ([[Nick Scotti]]). She ran down Tony in Megan's driveway, in which it was suspected Tricia did intentionally. Eventually, all the Dennisons left town including Tricia, who left Ryan to move to [[London, England]]. Six months later, Tricia returned to Genoa City and asked Ryan to take her back, in which he refused as Victoria became interested in him again. Tricia turned to Carter Mills, who was really rapist [[The Young and the Restless characters (1990s)#Matt Clark|Matt Clark]] ([[Rick Hearst]]). He used her, leading Tricia to attempt suicide but Ryan was able to stop her. After Ryan and Victoria reunited, Victor had Tricia move in with him to keep her away from them. They decided to get remarried, and on their wedding day, Tricia arrived in wedding dress identical to Victoria's, locked her in a closet and took her place at the altar, where she held Ryan at gunpoint to remarry her. Victor broke Victoria free, who entered the chapel where Tricia shot twice at her, but Ryan jumped in front to save her life. Eventually, Ryan died from the gunshot wounds, leaving Victoria devastated and alone.

Created by [[William J. Bell]], the character was portrayed by [[Scott Reeves]], who made his first appearance On June 26, 1991 as a businessman who wanted to \"work his way to the top of the corporation ladder\". The character gained popularity upon his relationship with [[Victoria Newman]] ([[Heather Tom]]), which initially received criticism due to the characters' [[age gap]]. He was also involved with [[Nina Webster]] ([[Tricia Cast]]) and the insane [[The Young and the Restless characters (1990s)#Tricia Dennison McNeil|Tricia Dennison]] ([[Sabryn Genet]]).\n\nReeves, who described Ryan as a \"go-getter\" who was \"shrewd\" and a \"charmer\", found his seduction storyline with Victoria hard to \"play out\" considering her age. In October 2001, the actor announced his exit from ''The Young and the Restless'', stating it was to pursue other projects. The producers kept quiet about the storyline surrounding his exit, although confirmed that he would depart \"in a big way\". Within the story, Ryan prepared to remarry Victoria but Tricia, his ex-wife, attempted to shoot her and Ryan took two bullets and died from the injury. Throughout his time on the soap opera, Reeves became popular with fans as one of the genre's leading men, garnering multiple awards and nominations.\n\n==Casting==\nReeves first appeared as Ryan in May 1991, on contract. In March 2000, it was announced that Reeves had signed a three-year contract deal with [[Sony Pictures]], which would have furthered his portrayal until 2003.<ref>{{cite news|title=Genet and Reeves will return in Y&R roles |first=Lynda |last=Hirsch |newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel]] |date=March 27, 2000 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Havens |first=Candace |title=''Real transitions for several soap stars'' |date=May 21, 2000 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CKVEAAAAIBAJ&sjid=t7UMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4032,2870567&dq=scott+reeves+leaving+the+young+and+the+restless&hl=en |accessdate=April 14, 2013 |newspaper=[[The Durant Daily Democrat]]}}</ref> However, by August 2001, reports began to surface that Reeves had been released from his contract and would be exiting in a \"storyline-dictated\" departure, during the [[Nielsen ratings|November sweeps]] period.<ref name=\"Reeves Out\">{{cite web|last=J Kroll|first=Dan|title=Scott Reeves, Ryan out at Y&R|url=http://soapcentral.com/yr/news/2001/0917-reeves.php|publisher=Soap Central|accessdate=April 20, 2013|date=August 17, 2001}}</ref> In October, Reeves officially announced his exit from the soap opera, stating it was to pursue other projects.

The two fell in love and married to Victor's dismay, however, Victoria refused to consummate their relationship and Ryan cheated on her with Nina Webster. Victoria divorced him, and he then moved in with Nina and her son, [[Chance Chancellor|Phillip Chancellor IV]] ([[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]]), and he later married Nina out of obligation. He eventually developed genuine feelings for Nina, however, she fell in love with novelist [[Cole Howard]] ([[J. Eddie Peck]]). After Nina was rejected by him, she had a nervous breakdown causing Ryan to sleep with [[Tricia Dennison]] ([[Sabryn Genet]]). Nina then tried to commit suicide and shot herself in a struggle with Ryan, and he was arrested for her shooting. Nina suffered short term amnesia, and although she regained her memory and exonerated Ryan, they divorced. Ryan then ended up marrying Tricia, much to the disapproval of her father Keith Dennison (David Allen Brooks). However, Tricia was very jealous of Ryan's relationship with Phillip, who accused her of breaking apart his family. In desperation, Tricia stopped taking her birth control pills and they conceived a child, to which Ryan was against though warmed up to the idea. When she miscarried, Tricia saw it as her punishment for deceiving her husband.\n\nTricia then became obsessed with destroying her sister [[Megan Dennison]]'s ([[Ashley Jones]]) relationship with [[Tony Viscardi]] ([[Nick Scotti]]). She ran down Tony in Megan's driveway, in which it was suspected Tricia did intentionally. Eventually, all the Dennisons left town including Tricia, who left Ryan to move to [[London, England]]. Six months later, Tricia returned to Genoa City and asked Ryan to take her back, in which he refused as Victoria became interested in him again. Tricia turned to Carter Mills, who was really rapist [[The Young and the Restless characters (1990s)#Matt Clark|Matt Clark]] ([[Rick Hearst]]). He used her, leading Tricia to attempt suicide but Ryan was able to stop her. After Ryan and Victoria reunited, Victor had Tricia move in with him to keep her away from them. They decided to get remarried, and on their wedding day, Tricia arrived in wedding dress identical to Victoria's, locked her in a closet and took her place at the altar, where she held Ryan at gunpoint to remarry her. Victor broke Victoria free, who entered the chapel where Tricia shot twice at her, but Ryan jumped in front to save her life. Eventually, Ryan died from the gunshot wounds, leaving Victoria devastated and alone.

This way, it is possible to keep the membership fee low, resulting in significant cost savings for the channels compared to a classic agency model.<ref>Backstage, 2013, [https://backstage.rtlgroup.com/public/files/2013-week14-Backstage-newsletter.pdf \"How Enex is transforming from a technical service into content provider \"]</ref>\n\n== Live operations ==\n\nENEX organises live stand-up coverage of major planned and breaking news events on behalf of partners. These services are designed to provide a more cost-effective way for members to cover significant stories when it is not possible or necessary for them to deploy their own live newsgathering operations.\nThe [[Greek government-debt crisis#2015|Greek financial crisis]] of summer 2015 saw ENEX deploying satellite trucks not only to Athens but also to each of the long-running string of governmental meetings in Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg City such as [[Eurogroup]], [[Economic and Financial Affairs Council|Ecofin]] and full council. The [[Germanwings#Incidents and accidents|German Wings plane crash]] saw ENEX have live camera positions in [[Seyne|Seyne Les Alpes]], France, Dusseldorf Airport and Haltern Am See in Germany. Over the course of the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|Charlie Hebdo tragedy]], ENEX used three SNGs to provide positions in five locations, including the magazine\u2019s offices on the first day and the Paris supermarket for the final hostage-freeing.\nPre-planned events have included the British royal wedding of the [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Duke]] and [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Duchess of Cambridge]], the birth of their two children and the election of [[Pope Francis]] in 2013.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:RTL Group]]\n[[Category:Media companies of Luxembourg]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Luxembourg City]]\n[[Category:Pan-European media companies]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_News_Exchange"}

One team is shown a fill-in-the-blank and its top seven answers, with the first letter of each word in each correct answer being shown as a clue. For example, if the question is \"When I think of [[Italy]], I think of [blank],\" an answer might be \"L______ T____\" for [[Leaning Tower of Pisa | Leaning Tower]].\n\nIn the first round, each team is given one question. The team has a total of 30 seconds to guess all seven answers correctly. The first player offers an answer, and keeps giving answers until giving an answer that is not on the board, at which point control passes to the next player in line. This process continues (going back to the beginning of the line as often as necessary) until either all seven answers are given or time runs out. The team is awarded 100 points for every correct answer, and a 1,000-point bonus (1,700 total) if they can get all seven answers within the 30 seconds. Along the way, players must answer in turn; giving an answer out of turn\u2014including before the previous player's answer is ruled incorrect\u2014results in a five-second penalty (and the answer being disregarded). If the team cannot guess all seven, then the opposing team is given a chance to steal the remaining answers at 100 points each. Steal attempts are untimed, but end when either the board is completed or the stealing team gives an incorrect answer. Synonyms and word forms are acceptable if they correctly fill in the same blank(s) (for example, \"chefs\" and \"cooking\" would both be acceptable for \"cooks,\" but \"physician\" would not be acceptable for \"doctor\").\n\nFor the second round the order of play is reversed but the round is otherwise played the same way, with 200 points given for each correct answer and a 2,000-point bonus for all seven. In the third round, which is played for 300 points per answer and 3,000 bonus points for all seven, the team that is leading after the second round plays first - in case of a tie at this point, the round starts with team that started the game. The team with the most points after all three rounds wins $1,000 and the chance to play for $15,000 in the bonus round.\n\nBecause the leading team starts the third round, it has the opportunity to mathematically clinch victory before the trailing team has an opportunity to play its turn. In all cases, the third round immediately ends the moment the trailing team is [[mathematical elimination|mathematically eliminated]] from at least tying the leading team, which can happen when:\n\n* The team playing first gives seven correct answers during its turn, thus scoring 5,100 points (unless the game was tied after the second round in which case the other team would still be able to tie);\n* The team playing first gives enough correct answers during its turn that the team playing second, even if it were to steal all remaining answers, cannot reduce the lead to less than 5,200 points;\n* The team playing second is still trailing by at least 5,200 points after an unsuccessful steal attempt;\n* The team playing second is still trailing after completing its turn;\n* The team playing second gives seven correct answers during its turn, thus scoring 5,100 points (unless this is only enough to tie the game, in which case the tiebreaker would be played);\n* The team playing second gives enough correct answers during its turn to take a sufficiently large lead that the team originally leading cannot at least tie the game by stealing;\n* The team playing first unsuccessfully attempts to steal while trailing;\n* The team playing first re-takes the lead through stealing;\n\nIn the event of a tie after the third round, a tiebreaker is played between the team captains. The first letter of the top answer is shown, and then the question is shown. The first captain to buzz in is given the chance to answer. If the answer given is correct, that captain wins the game for his or her team. If the answer given is incorrect, then the other team wins automatically.\n\n=== Bonus round ===\nIn the Bonus Round, the winning team has 60 seconds to get the top answers to four more survey questions. The players are lined up in their same order around a central console with a large red Pass Button. Play starts again with the Team Captain, and is similar to the Main Game: a correct guess allows the player to give another answer, a wrong answer passes control to the next player in line.\n\nFor the first survey question, only the top answer is needed, the second needs the top two answers, the third needs the top three answers, and the final question needs the top four answers.\n\nIf a team member feels they are stuck on a question, they can hit the Pass Button (which stops the clock) and skip to the next question. They must return to the passed question once completing the other three in order to win the Bonus. The Pass Button can only be used once during the Bonus Round, and cannot be used once three of the four questions are completed (as there is no other question with which to pass).\n\nPlayers must wait until it is their turn before offering an answer. If a player offers an answer out of turn, the team loses five seconds from their clock.\n\nOnce all the needed answers for each question are correctly guessed, the clock stops and the next question is revealed. The guessing for each subsequent question begins with the player next in line (i.e. if Player 2 gave the last correct answer for a question, the next question's guessing starts with Player 3).\n\nIf the team can give all ten correct answers before time runs out, they win $15,000. If they cannot, they leave with just the $1,000 won in the Main Game.\n\nOn October 29, 2019, \"The Canadians\" (Ayumi Iizuka, Doug Morency, David Ivkovic, and Paul 'PK' Kingston) became the first team to complete a perfect game, amassing 10,400 points in 3 perfect rounds of 1,700, 3,400, and 5,100 points (plus a 200 point steal), and winning the bonus round.\n\n==Reception==\n''America Says'' raised Game Show Network's ratings by 26% over its time slot lead-in, and its women 25-54 ratings by more than 40%.<ref name=GSN /> \n\n''Stars & Celebs'' journalist Bradley Clarke described the series as \"GSN's newest mediocre game show,\" criticizing the low prize money and calling the format \"basically ''[[Family Feud]]'' but without the ''Family Feud'' charm\" as well as stating that the point system \"makes absolutely no sense.\" Clarke did concede that \"the game itself is somewhat fun to play along with.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thecelebritycafe.com/2018/06/america-says-is-gsns-newest-mediocre-game-show/|title=''America Says'' is GSN's newest mediocre game show|work=The Celebrity Cafe|last=Clarke|first=Bradley|date=June 29, 2018|accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHiggins was nominated for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host|Outstanding Game Show Host]] at the [[46th Daytime Emmy Awards]].<ref name=\"NATAS 2019\">{{cite web|url=http://cdn.emmyonline.org/daytime-46th-nominations-release-no-credits.pdf|title=The 46th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards Nominations |publisher=emmyonline.org and National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences |accessdate=March 20, 2019|year=2019|location=New York |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Family Feud]]''-similar in content\n*[[2018 in television]]\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://www.gsntv.com/america-says/}}\n* {{IMDb title|8305258|America Says}}\n* [https://www.sidereel.com/tv-shows/america-says ''America Says'' on SideReel]\n{{italic title}}\n{{Game Show Network|state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:2010s American game shows]]\n[[Category:2020s American game shows]]\n[[Category:2018 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Cable game shows]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Game Show Network original programming]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = America Says\n| image                    = America Says Logo.jpg\n| image_alt                = \n| caption                  = \n| genre                    = [[Game show]]\n| creator                  = {{Plainlist|\n* Cleve Keller\n* Dave Noll\n}}\n| based_on                 = \n| developer                = \n| writer                   = \n| director                 = Hal Grant\n| creative_director        = \n| presenter                = [[John Michael Higgins]]\n| starring                 = \n| judges                   = \n| voices                   = \n| narrated                 = \n| theme_music_composer     = \n| opentheme                = \n| endtheme                 = \n| composer                 = \n| country                  = United States\n| language                 = English\n| num_seasons              = 3\n| num_episodes             = 320 \n| list_episodes            = \n| executive_producer       = {{Plainlist|\n* Tara Long \n* Mark Herwick\n* Dave Noll\n* Cleve Keller\n* John Quinn\n* Jeffery Breeder\n}}\n| producer                 = \n| editor                   = \n| location                 = \n| cinematography           = \n| camera                   = \n| runtime                  = 20-22 minutes\n| company                  = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Entertainment One]]\n* [[Keller Noll]]\n}}\n| distributor              = \n| network                  = [[Game Show Network]]\n| channel                  = [[Game Show Network]]\n| picture_format           = 16:9\n| audio_format             = \n| first_run                = \n| released                 = \n| first_aired              = {{Start date|2018|6|18}} <ref>[https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/Actor-John-Michael-Higgins-Named-as-Host-of-Game-Show-Networks-New-Survey-Based-Show-AMERICA-SAYS-20180516 Actor John Michael Higgins Named as Host of Game Show Network's New Survey-Based Show, AMERICA SAYS-BroadwayWorld TV]</ref>\n| last_aired               = {{End date|present}}\n| preceded_by              = \n| followed_by              = \n| related                  = \n| website                  = https://www.gsntv.com/america-says/\n| website_title            = Official website\n| production_website       = \n}}\n'''''America Says''''' is an [[Television in the United States|American television]] [[game show]] hosted by [[John Michael Higgins]] and broadcast by [[Game Show Network]].

Play starts again with the Team Captain, and is similar to the Main Game: a correct guess allows the player to give another answer, a wrong answer passes control to the next player in line.\n\nFor the first survey question, only the top answer is needed, the second needs the top two answers, the third needs the top three answers, and the final question needs the top four answers.\n\nIf a team member feels they are stuck on a question, they can hit the Pass Button (which stops the clock) and skip to the next question. They must return to the passed question once completing the other three in order to win the Bonus. The Pass Button can only be used once during the Bonus Round, and cannot be used once three of the four questions are completed (as there is no other question with which to pass).\n\nPlayers must wait until it is their turn before offering an answer. If a player offers an answer out of turn, the team loses five seconds from their clock.\n\nOnce all the needed answers for each question are correctly guessed, the clock stops and the next question is revealed. The guessing for each subsequent question begins with the player next in line (i.e. if Player 2 gave the last correct answer for a question, the next question's guessing starts with Player 3).\n\nIf the team can give all ten correct answers before time runs out, they win $15,000. If they cannot, they leave with just the $1,000 won in the Main Game.\n\nOn October 29, 2019, \"The Canadians\" (Ayumi Iizuka, Doug Morency, David Ivkovic, and Paul 'PK' Kingston) became the first team to complete a perfect game, amassing 10,400 points in 3 perfect rounds of 1,700, 3,400, and 5,100 points (plus a 200 point steal), and winning the bonus round.\n\n==Reception==\n''America Says'' raised Game Show Network's ratings by 26% over its time slot lead-in, and its women 25-54 ratings by more than 40%.<ref name=GSN /> \n\n''Stars & Celebs'' journalist Bradley Clarke described the series as \"GSN's newest mediocre game show,\" criticizing the low prize money and calling the format \"basically ''[[Family Feud]]'' but without the ''Family Feud'' charm\" as well as stating that the point system \"makes absolutely no sense.\" Clarke did concede that \"the game itself is somewhat fun to play along with.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thecelebritycafe.com/2018/06/america-says-is-gsns-newest-mediocre-game-show/|title=''America Says'' is GSN's newest mediocre game show|work=The Celebrity Cafe|last=Clarke|first=Bradley|date=June 29, 2018|accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHiggins was nominated for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host|Outstanding Game Show Host]] at the [[46th Daytime Emmy Awards]].<ref name=\"NATAS 2019\">{{cite web|url=http://cdn.emmyonline.org/daytime-46th-nominations-release-no-credits.pdf|title=The 46th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards Nominations |publisher=emmyonline.org and National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences |accessdate=March 20, 2019|year=2019|location=New York |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Family Feud]]''-similar in content\n*[[2018 in television]]\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://www.gsntv.com/america-says/}}\n* {{IMDb title|8305258|America Says}}\n* [https://www.sidereel.com/tv-shows/america-says ''America Says'' on SideReel]\n{{italic title}}\n{{Game Show Network|state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:2010s American game shows]]\n[[Category:2020s American game shows]]\n[[Category:2018 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Cable game shows]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Game Show Network original programming]]\n", "name_user": "Rupertslander", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGameplay", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_Says"}

But Savelyeva was not only a boxer; she also ran track and also learned how to play guitar.

As rigs became taller by the end of the 19th century, masts relied more heavily on successive spars, stepped one atop the other to form the whole, from bottom to top: the ''lower mast'', ''top mast'', and ''topgallant mast''. This construction relied heavily on support by a complex array of stays and shrouds. Each stay in either the fore-and-aft or athwartships direction had a corresponding one in the opposite direction providing counter-tension. Fore-and-aft the system of tensioning started with the stays that were anchored in front each mast. Shrouds were tensioned by pairs [[deadeye]]s, circular blocks that had the large-diameter line run around them, whilst multiple holes allowed smaller line\u2014''lanyard''\u2014to pass multiple times between the two and thereby allow tensioning of the shroud. In addition to overlapping the mast below, the top mast and topgallant mast were supported laterally by shrouds that passed around either a platform, called a \"[[Top (sailing ship)|top]]\", or cross-wise beams, called \"[[crosstrees]]\". Each additional mast segment is supported fore and aft by a series of stays that led forward. These lines were countered in tension by backstays, which were secured along the sides of the vessel behind the shrouds.<ref name = Wolfram>\n{{cite book\n | last = zu Mondfeld\n | first = Wolfram \n | title = Historic Ship Models\n | publisher = Sterling Publishing Company, Inc.\n | date = 2005\n | location =\n | pages = 352\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5nrXLkfLBGcC&pg=PA270&dq=standing+rigging&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwirw6_J0KTRAhUM4iYKHUZBDvsQ6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&q=standing%20rigging&f=false\n | isbn = 9781402721861 }}</ref>\n\n===Running===\n{{Main|Running  rigging}}\n[[Running rigging]] is the cordage used to control the shape and position of the sails.

{"title_page": "DJ Gruff", "text_new": "{{BLP sources|date=July 2008}}\n\nSandro Orr\u00f9, '''(January 8th, 1968)''' in art DJ Gruff, Gruffetti or Lowdy N.C.N. is a pioneer of the Italian Hip Hop scene. Known for his original take on [[rapping]] and [[scratching]] tecniques, since 1982, DJ Gruff has been active on the Hip Hop scene in Italy as a [[Turntablism|turntablist]], [[Disc jockey|DJ]], [[beatmaker]], [[Rapping|rapper]] and producer.\n\n==Biography==\nDJ Gruff has been a member of a number of groups/collectives/crews such as '''The place to be''' (Next One, Carrie D, Igor, Nando- Boogie and Mr Hyde), '''Casino Royale''' (Alioscia Bisceglia, Giuliano Palma, Michele Pauli, Ferdinando Masi etc), '''Radical Stuff''' (DJ Skizo, Soul Boy, Sean, Top Cat and Kaos One), '''Isola Posse All Stars,''' and was among the founders of '''[[Sangue Misto]]''' (DJ Gruff, [[Neffa]] and Deda) recording with them the album ''SxM'', universally acknowledged as a milestone of Italian Hip Hop. DJ Gruff\u2019s musical production is vast, including collaborations with musicians, MCs, breakers, and street artists from all over the world. Since 1996 he has been collaborating with '''[[Alien Army]]''', the collective representing the greatest turntable talents in Italy.\n\n== Career ==\nDJ Gruff was born in Rome on 8/1/1968 to Sardinian parents and started spinning vinyl in 1982. A great fan of mixing on more than two turntables he immediately started [[scratching]]. One year later he discovered Hip Hop and breaking became his obsession. In 1984 his improvised, irreverent rap exclusively in Italian and Italian dialects, started to become popular, thanks to the breakers he was meeting. During a few nights in local venues in Torino he developed a new approach to playing music: an endless series of [[mixtape]]s with extreme scratching sessions conducted on a mixer built for other purposes. Customized switches - half melted on a flame -, extremely long slides and unsuitable needles could not stop his desire to develop the kind of instrument that in time would become the most popular in the world. In 1986 he become part of the Hip Hop scene in Milan and very quickly his particular touch on vinyl became well known, and he started working with '''Casino Royale''' (with Alioscia Bisceglia, Giuliano Palma, Michele Pauli, Ferdinando Masi etc) and '''Radical Stuff''' (with DJ Skizo, Soul Boy, Sean, Top Cat and Kaos One). During those years he featured in a huge number of jam sessions. One night DJ Ringo, well-known performer in one of Milan\u2019s top clubs, asked him to play music at a party organized for unequalled ensemble '''The J.B.\u2019s''' (James Brown band) and from that moment DJing became his reason to live. During the early 90s DJ Gruff moved to Bologna to work with a crossover, raggarock band; two years later from that setup the '''[[Sangue Misto]]''' ensemble was born (DJ Gruff, Neffa and Deda). Their studio album, ''SxM'', released in 1994 by the Century Vox label is still considered a milestone of Italian Hip Hop. Later all three artists would pursue separate solo projects. In 1995 Gruff moved to Puglia where he lived for three years studying the ancient rhythms of Salento. In 2001 he moved to Japan where he took his turntable techniques to a whole new level. This brought him to produce Frikkettonism, an eccentric album produced, mixed and printed in Tokyo. The album comes out in the Double H Vinyls series in 1000 hand-numbered copies in double gatefold vinyl, of which the first 600 in marbled transparent blue vinyl. From the early 80s his rapping style has developed in his records into his characteristic and unmistakable syllabic-reasoning style. In 2014, a meeting with the greatest contemporary trombone player, Gianluca Petrella, resulted in a fruitful collaboration exploring an experimental vision where Rap, Hip hop, Scratching and Jazz meet in an intense and totally unprejudiced partnership. In 2019 the album \"August11th\" by DJ Gruff & RayZa was released, produced with Gianluca Petrella feat. Reggie Reg from Crash Crew, Grandmaster Caz, Grand Wizzard Theodore, Sadat X, Ekspo, Kemar Williams, Ramtzu, Uomodisu, Antonio Tarantino, Diego Martino, Allien Army and 2ph13b.

Known for his original take on [[rapping]] and [[scratching]] tecniques, since 1982, DJ Gruff has been active on the Hip Hop scene in Italy as a [[Turntablism|turntablist]], [[Disc jockey|DJ]], [[beatmaker]], [[Rapping|rapper]] and producer.\n\n==Biography==\nDJ Gruff has been a member of a number of groups/collectives/crews such as '''The place to be''' (Next One, Carrie D, Igor, Nando- Boogie and Mr Hyde), '''Casino Royale''' (Alioscia Bisceglia, Giuliano Palma, Michele Pauli, Ferdinando Masi etc), '''Radical Stuff''' (DJ Skizo, Soul Boy, Sean, Top Cat and Kaos One), '''Isola Posse All Stars,''' and was among the founders of '''[[Sangue Misto]]''' (DJ Gruff, [[Neffa]] and Deda) recording with them the album ''SxM'', universally acknowledged as a milestone of Italian Hip Hop. DJ Gruff\u2019s musical production is vast, including collaborations with musicians, MCs, breakers, and street artists from all over the world. Since 1996 he has been collaborating with '''[[Alien Army]]''', the collective representing the greatest turntable talents in Italy.\n\n== Career ==\nDJ Gruff was born in Rome on 8/1/1968 to Sardinian parents and started spinning vinyl in 1982. A great fan of mixing on more than two turntables he immediately started [[scratching]]. One year later he discovered Hip Hop and breaking became his obsession. In 1984 his improvised, irreverent rap exclusively in Italian and Italian dialects, started to become popular, thanks to the breakers he was meeting. During a few nights in local venues in Torino he developed a new approach to playing music: an endless series of [[mixtape]]s with extreme scratching sessions conducted on a mixer built for other purposes. Customized switches - half melted on a flame -, extremely long slides and unsuitable needles could not stop his desire to develop the kind of instrument that in time would become the most popular in the world. In 1986 he become part of the Hip Hop scene in Milan and very quickly his particular touch on vinyl became well known, and he started working with '''Casino Royale''' (with Alioscia Bisceglia, Giuliano Palma, Michele Pauli, Ferdinando Masi etc) and '''Radical Stuff''' (with DJ Skizo, Soul Boy, Sean, Top Cat and Kaos One). During those years he featured in a huge number of jam sessions. One night DJ Ringo, well-known performer in one of Milan\u2019s top clubs, asked him to play music at a party organized for unequalled ensemble '''The J.B.\u2019s''' (James Brown band) and from that moment DJing became his reason to live. During the early 90s DJ Gruff moved to Bologna to work with a crossover, raggarock band; two years later from that setup the '''[[Sangue Misto]]''' ensemble was born (DJ Gruff, Neffa and Deda). Their studio album, ''SxM'', released in 1994 by the Century Vox label is still considered a milestone of Italian Hip Hop. Later all three artists would pursue separate solo projects. In 1995 Gruff moved to Puglia where he lived for three years studying the ancient rhythms of Salento. In 2001 he moved to Japan where he took his turntable techniques to a whole new level. This brought him to produce Frikkettonism, an eccentric album produced, mixed and printed in Tokyo. The album comes out in the Double H Vinyls series in 1000 hand-numbered copies in double gatefold vinyl, of which the first 600 in marbled transparent blue vinyl. From the early 80s his rapping style has developed in his records into his characteristic and unmistakable syllabic-reasoning style.
