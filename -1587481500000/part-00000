The Doctor builds a device to return her to her TARDIS, but accidentally teleports her new friends with her; the group help retrieve her TARDIS on an alien world in \"[[The Ghost Monument]]\". After a trip to [[segregation in the United States|segregation-era]] Alabama in \"[[Rosa (Doctor Who)|Rosa]]\", Graham, Ryan, and Yaz agree to being full-time companions in \"[[Arachnids in the UK]]\". Subsequent trips include visiting Yaz's grandmother in 1947, witnessing the [[partition of India]] in \"[[Demons of the Punjab]]\"; preventing a plan to kill millions galaxy-wide as part of a labour protest, in \"[[Kerblam!]]\", and being confounded by sexism for the first time while repelling an alien invasion alongside [[James VI and I]] in [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] Lancashire, in \"[[The Witchfinders]]\". In series finale \"[[The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos]]\", the Doctor is drawn into a second confrontation with the Stenza she faced in Sheffield. In the [[New Year's Day]] special \"[[Resolution (Doctor Who)|Resolution]]\" (2019), her friends encounter a [[Dalek]] for the first time when one is awakened by archaeologists in Sheffield. It is narrowly defeated before it can signal a broader Dalek invasion of Earth.\n\nIn \"[[Spyfall (Doctor Who)|Spyfall]]\" (2020), the Doctor faces off against the regenerated [[The Master (Doctor Who)|Master]] ([[Sacha Dhawan]]), who reveals that he destroyed their home planet of [[Gallifrey]] in revenge for a lie told to them about their people's origins, concerning the story of the so-called \"Timeless Child\". Later, in \"[[Fugitive of the Judoon]]\", she worries intensely about her future when she learns her former companion [[Jack Harkness]] ([[John Barrowman]]) sent her a warning &ndash; \"Do not give the Lone Cyberman what it wants\" &ndash; just as she was encountering an incarnation of herself (played by [[Jo Martin]]), seemingly from Gallifrey's past, that she has no recollection of ever being. The Doctor's ignores Jack's warning in \"[[The Haunting of Villa Diodati]]\", when the Doctor gives a solitary, partially-converted Cyberman from the distant future ([[Patrick O'Kane]]) a compendium containing all knowledge of the fallen Cyber-Empire in order to save the life of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Percy Shelley]] (Lewis Rainer) and protect human history. The Doctor and her friends pursue the Lone Cyberman to the future and the aftermath of the Cyber-Wars, in \"[[Ascension of the Cybermen]]\", where he has set in motion a plan to rebuild the Cyber-Empire and wipe out all life in the universe. Just as humans again face destruction at the hands of the Cybermen, she is pulled through a portal to Gallifrey by the Master, in \"[[The Timeless Children]]\", where she learns of a radical cover-up of her origins: she is in fact the Timeless Child, an orphan from an unknown world whose unique power to regenerate was studied and replicated by her adopted mother, whose people used it to build the Time Lord empire. The Time Lords then forced her to work for them in secret for many years before erasing her memories. Stunned by this, she nevertheless defeats the Master's plan to conquer the universe with a new race of Cybermen-Time Lord hybrids. Overwhelmed, she takes a moment to pause alone before being arrested by the [[Judoon]].\n\n===Literature===\n[[New Series Adventures]] released three novels starring the Thirteenth Doctor, Graham O'Brien, Ryan Sinclair and Yasmin Khan in October/November 2018: ''The Good Doctor'', ''Molten Heart'', and ''Combat Magicks''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.doctorwho.tv/news/?article=covers-revealed-for-brand-new-thirteenth-doctor-novels|title=Covers revealed for 3 brand new Thirteenth Doctor novels|date=19 September 2018|website=Doctor Who TV|accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref> A novel targeted at younger readers, ''The Secret in Vault 13'', was published that November by BBC Children's Books.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/309464/doctor-who--the-secret-in-vault-13/9781405937610.html|title=Doctor Who: The Secret in Vault 13|last=Solomons|first=David|website=www.penguin.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-12-02}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Announcement ===\nFan reaction to Whittaker's casting was largely positive, although \"a sizeable minority protested that the Doctor shouldn't be played by a woman.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-40848800|title=How Jodie Whittaker 'missed' fan reactions to Doctor Who role|date=7 August 2017|work=BBC News|accessdate=10 December 2017}}</ref> Some said that a [[female]] Doctor would be a good role model for young girls, while others felt the Doctor was only ever meant to be [[male]], or criticised the casting as an exercise in [[political correctness]].<ref name=\"BBCFansReact\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-40626224|title=Doctor Who: Fans react to Jodie Whittaker casting|date=17 July 2017|work=BBC News|accessdate=17 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/good-bad-ugly-responses-jodie-whittaker-new-dr/|title=The good, bad and ugly responses to Jodie Whittaker as the new Dr Who|last=Sturgis|first=India|date=17 July 2017|work=The Telegraph|access-date=5 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/showbiz-tv/doctor-who-fans-defend-jodie-13340468|title=Doctor Who fans defend Jodie Whittaker over 'hate speech' attacks|date=17 July 2017|work=Birmingham Mail|accessdate=17 October 2017}}</ref> <!--A poll of 30,000 fans on the website ''Doctor Who TV'' found that 52.4% were happy with the casting, while 47.6% were unhappy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/your-verdict-on-jodie-whittakers-casting-86080.htm|title=Your verdict on Jodie Whittaker\u2019s casting|work=Doctor Who TV|date=1 August 2017}}</ref>--> During the ''Doctor Who'' panel at the 2017 [[San Diego Comic Con International]], outgoing showrunner Steven Moffat denied there had been a \"backlash\" over Whittaker's casting, and said there was \"80% approval on social media\".

The Doctor builds a device to return her to her TARDIS, but accidentally teleports her new friends with her; the group help retrieve her TARDIS on an alien world in \"[[The Ghost Monument]]\". After a trip to [[segregation in the United States|segregation-era]] Alabama in \"[[Rosa (Doctor Who)|Rosa]]\", Graham, Ryan, and Yaz agree to being full-time companions in \"[[Arachnids in the UK]]\". Subsequent trips include visiting Yaz's grandmother in 1947, witnessing the [[partition of India]] in \"[[Demons of the Punjab]]\"; preventing a plan to kill millions galaxy-wide as part of a labour protest, in \"[[Kerblam!]]\", and being confounded by sexism for the first time while repelling an alien invasion alongside [[James VI and I]] in [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] Lancashire, in \"[[The Witchfinders]]\". In series finale \"[[The Battle of Ranskoor Av Kolos]]\", the Doctor is drawn into a second confrontation with the Stenza she faced in Sheffield. In the [[New Year's Day]] special \"[[Resolution (Doctor Who)|Resolution]]\" (2019), her friends encounter a [[Dalek]] for the first time when one is awakened by archaeologists in Sheffield. It is narrowly defeated before it can signal a broader Dalek invasion of Earth.\n\nIn \"[[Spyfall (Doctor Who)|Spyfall]]\" (2020), the Doctor faces off against the regenerated [[The Master (Doctor Who)|Master]] ([[Sacha Dhawan]]), who reveals that he destroyed their home planet of [[Gallifrey]] in revenge for a lie told to them about their people's origins, concerning the story of the so-called \"Timeless Child\". Later, in \"[[Fugitive of the Judoon]]\", she worries intensely about her future when she learns her former companion [[Jack Harkness]] ([[John Barrowman]]) sent her a warning &ndash; \"Do not give the Lone Cyberman what it wants\" &ndash; just as she was encountering an incarnation of herself (played by [[Jo Martin]]), seemingly from Gallifrey's past, that she has no recollection of ever being. The Doctor's ignores Jack's warning in \"[[The Haunting of Villa Diodati]]\", when the Doctor gives a solitary, partially-converted Cyberman from the distant future ([[Patrick O'Kane]]) a compendium containing all knowledge of the fallen Cyber-Empire in order to save the life of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Percy Shelley]] (Lewis Rainer) and protect human history. The Doctor and her friends pursue the Lone Cyberman to the future and the aftermath of the Cyber-Wars, in \"[[Ascension of the Cybermen]]\", where he has set in motion a plan to rebuild the Cyber-Empire and wipe out all life in the universe. Just as humans again face destruction at the hands of the Cybermen, she is pulled through a portal to Gallifrey by the Master, in \"[[The Timeless Children]]\", where she learns of a radical cover-up of her origins: she is in fact the Timeless Child, an orphan from an unknown world whose unique power to regenerate was studied and replicated by her adopted mother, whose people used it to build the Time Lord empire. The Time Lords then forced her to work for them in secret for many years before erasing her memories. Stunned by this, she nevertheless defeats the Master's plan to conquer the universe with a new race of Cybermen-Time Lord hybrids. Overwhelmed, she takes a moment to pause alone before being arrested by the [[Judoon]].\n\n===Literature===\n[[New Series Adventures]] released three novels starring the Thirteenth Doctor, Graham O'Brien, Ryan Sinclair and Yasmin Khan in October/November 2018: ''The Good Doctor'', ''Molten Heart'', and ''Combat Magicks''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.doctorwho.tv/news/?article=covers-revealed-for-brand-new-thirteenth-doctor-novels|title=Covers revealed for 3 brand new Thirteenth Doctor novels|date=19 September 2018|website=Doctor Who TV|accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref> A novel targeted at younger readers, ''The Secret in Vault 13'', was published that November by BBC Children's Books.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/309464/doctor-who--the-secret-in-vault-13/9781405937610.html|title=Doctor Who: The Secret in Vault 13|last=Solomons|first=David|website=www.penguin.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-12-02}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Announcement ===\nFan reaction to Whittaker's casting was largely positive, although \"a sizeable minority protested that the Doctor shouldn't be played by a woman.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-40848800|title=How Jodie Whittaker 'missed' fan reactions to Doctor Who role|date=7 August 2017|work=BBC News|accessdate=10 December 2017}}</ref> Some said that a [[female]] Doctor would be a good role model for young girls, while others felt the Doctor was only ever meant to be [[male]], or criticised the casting as an exercise in [[political correctness]].<ref name=\"BBCFansReact\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-40626224|title=Doctor Who: Fans react to Jodie Whittaker casting|date=17 July 2017|work=BBC News|accessdate=17 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/good-bad-ugly-responses-jodie-whittaker-new-dr/|title=The good, bad and ugly responses to Jodie Whittaker as the new Dr Who|last=Sturgis|first=India|date=17 July 2017|work=The Telegraph|access-date=5 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/showbiz-tv/doctor-who-fans-defend-jodie-13340468|title=Doctor Who fans defend Jodie Whittaker over 'hate speech' attacks|date=17 July 2017|work=Birmingham Mail|accessdate=17 October 2017}}</ref> <!--A poll of 30,000 fans on the website ''Doctor Who TV'' found that 52.4% were happy with the casting, while 47.6% were unhappy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/your-verdict-on-jodie-whittakers-casting-86080.htm|title=Your verdict on Jodie Whittaker\u2019s casting|work=Doctor Who TV|date=1 August 2017}}</ref>--> During the ''Doctor Who'' panel at the 2017 [[San Diego Comic Con International]], outgoing showrunner Steven Moffat denied there had been a \"backlash\" over Whittaker's casting, and said there was \"80% approval on social media\".

From soldiers in the Second World War wearing t-shirts bearing the logos and names of their branches to famous rock groups in the 1960s and 1970s, like The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin, turning their branded t-shirts into collector\u2019s items for their fans.
