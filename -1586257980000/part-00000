After having questioned her intentions over radio, the Venezuelan Coast Guard vessel ordered ''RCGS Resolute'' to follow her to  [[Puerto Moreno]] on the eastern side of [[Margarita Island]]. While the master was in contact with the company's head office and [[designated person ashore]] (DPA), warning shots were fired from ''Naiguat\u00e1'' and, shortly afterwards, the Venezuelan patrol boat purposely rammed the cruise ship's starboard bow.
