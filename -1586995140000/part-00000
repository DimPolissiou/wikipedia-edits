Kabocha is commonly utilized in side dishes and soups, or as a substitute for potato or other squash varieties. It can be roasted after cutting the squash in half, scooping out the seeds, and then cutting the squash into wedges. With a little olive oil and seasoning, it can be baked in the oven. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Likewise, cut Kabocha halves can be added to a pressure cooker and steamed under high pressure for 15\u201320 minutes.\n\nKabocha is available all year but is best in late summer and early fall. \nKabocha is primarily grown in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, California, Florida, Hawaii, [[Southwestern Colorado]], Mexico, [[Tasmania]], [[Tonga]], New Zealand, Chile, Jamaica, and South Africa, but is widely adapted for climates that provide a growing season of 100 days or more.

Therefore, unlike other vegetables and fruits, freshness is not as important.  It should be ''fully matured'' first, in order to become flavorful, by first ripening the kabocha in a warm place (77&nbsp;\u00b0F/25&nbsp;\u00b0C) for 13 days to convert some of the starch to sugar.  Then the kabocha is transferred to a cool place (50&nbsp;\u00b0F/10&nbsp;\u00b0C) and stored for about a month in order to increase carbohydrate content. In this way the just-harvested, dry, bland-tasting kabocha is transformed into a smooth, sweet kabocha. Fully ripened, succulent kabocha will have reddish-yellow flesh, a hard skin, and a dry, corky stem.  It reaches the peak of ripeness about 1.5\u20133 months after it is harvested.<ref>[http://www.nijiya.com/gochiso/english/2006/files/06english.pdf \"Kabocha (Japanese Pumpkin) A Flavor of the Earth\"] [http://www.nijiya.com/gochiso-magazine#english Gochiso Web Magazine], 2006, p. 8</ref>\n\n==History==\nAll [[squash (plant)|squashes]] were domesticated in [[Mesoamerica]].

Kabocha is commonly utilized in side dishes and soups, or as a substitute for potato or other squash varieties. It can be roasted after cutting the squash in half, scooping out the seeds, and then cutting the squash into wedges. With a little olive oil and seasoning, it can be baked in the oven. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Likewise, cut Kabocha halves can be added to a pressure cooker and steamed under high pressure for 15\u201320 minutes.\n\nKabocha is available all year but is best in late summer and early fall. \nKabocha is primarily grown in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, California, Florida, Hawaii, [[Southwestern Colorado]], Mexico, [[Tasmania]], [[Tonga]], New Zealand, Chile, Jamaica, and South Africa, but is widely adapted for climates that provide a growing season of 100 days or more.

Therefore, unlike other vegetables and fruits, freshness is not as important.  It should be ''fully matured'' first, in order to become flavorful, by first ripening the kabocha in a warm place (77&nbsp;\u00b0F/25&nbsp;\u00b0C) for 13 days to convert some of the starch to sugar.  Then the kabocha is transferred to a cool place (50&nbsp;\u00b0F/10&nbsp;\u00b0C) and stored for about a month in order to increase carbohydrate content. In this way the just-harvested, dry, bland-tasting kabocha is transformed into a smooth, sweet kabocha. Fully ripened, succulent kabocha will have reddish-yellow flesh, a hard skin, and a dry, corky stem.  It reaches the peak of ripeness about 1.5\u20133 months after it is harvested.<ref>[http://www.nijiya.com/gochiso/english/2006/files/06english.pdf \"Kabocha (Japanese Pumpkin) A Flavor of the Earth\"] [http://www.nijiya.com/gochiso-magazine#english Gochiso Web Magazine], 2006, p. 8</ref>\n\n==History==\nAll [[squash (plant)|squashes]] were domesticated in [[Mesoamerica]].
