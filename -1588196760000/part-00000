Randall left his country estate in [[Manhattan]], bounded by Fifth Avenue, Broadway, 10th Street, and the southern side of 8th Street adjacent to what is now [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]], to build an institution to care for \"aged, decrepit and worn-out\" seamen.\n\nThe first meeting of the corporation of Sailors\u2019 Snug Harbor took place in 1806. In its first election, then Mayor [[DeWitt Clinton]] was elected President. Several challenges to Randall's will took place; one by a Stephen Brown who alleged that Randall failed as executor of the estate of his grandfather in New Jersey from which the Randall estate was derived, and one from Anglican Bishop [[John Inglis (bishop)|John Inglis]] of [[Nova Scotia]] who alleged he was a proper collateral heir through his common ancestor John Crooke. The corporation was ironically legally represented by [[Thomas Addis Emmet]], a former member of the [[Society of United Irishmen]], an organization inspired by the success of the American Revolution to fight the British in Ireland. Future President [[Martin Van Buren]] also served on the defense team, and [[Daniel Webster]] provided counsel to the plaintiffs.<ref>Barry pgs. 30\u201332</ref>\n\n[[File:Snugharbor0840.JPG|thumb|The architecture of the Snug Harbor Culture Center]]\nBy the time the will challenge was settled, the once-rural land around the Manhattan estate had become well-developed.  Snug Harbor's trustees (appointed by Randall's will, they included the mayor of New York City, the president and vice president of the Marine Society, senior ministers of the Episcopal and Presbyterian Churches, the head of the Chamber of Commerce, and the chancellor of the State) decided to maximize the profits on the Manhattan property.

Randall left his country estate in [[Manhattan]], bounded by Fifth Avenue, Broadway, 10th Street, and the southern side of 8th Street adjacent to what is now [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]], to build an institution to care for \"aged, decrepit and worn-out\" seamen.\n\nThe first meeting of the corporation of Sailors\u2019 Snug Harbor took place in 1806. In its first election, then Mayor [[DeWitt Clinton]] was elected President. Several challenges to Randall's will took place; one by a Stephen Brown who alleged that Randall failed as executor of the estate of his grandfather in New Jersey from which the Randall estate was derived, and one from Anglican Bishop [[John Inglis (bishop)|John Inglis]] of [[Nova Scotia]] who alleged he was a proper collateral heir through his common ancestor John Crooke. The corporation was ironically legally represented by [[Thomas Addis Emmet]], a former member of the [[Society of United Irishmen]], an organization inspired by the success of the American Revolution to fight the British in Ireland. Future President [[Martin Van Buren]] also served on the defense team, and [[Daniel Webster]] provided counsel to the plaintiffs.<ref>Barry pgs. 30\u201332</ref>\n\n[[File:Snugharbor0840.JPG|thumb|The architecture of the Snug Harbor Culture Center]]\nBy the time the will challenge was settled, the once-rural land around the Manhattan estate had become well-developed.
