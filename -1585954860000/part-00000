Riedle, who was a minor convicted of molesting a younger child, told his parents he'd learned his behavior from the family priest. Reidle claimed he had been sexually abused by Rev. Thomas Adamson while serving as an altar boy at St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church of St. Paul Park. The Riedles informed their bishop of their son's allegations. Finding the bishop's response inadequate, the Riedles approached Anderson. Anderson launched a lawsuit against the Catholic Church after conducting an investigation that convinced him there had been a cover-up \"all the way to the archbishop.\" In 1984, after church officials denied in depositions that they knew about the priest's history of sexual abuse, the Archdiocese of Minneapolis and St. Paul reportedly offered over $1 million to settle the case out of public view.

After carrying out all kinds of tests on this aircraft, including flights with Juan de la Cierva as a passenger, it was concluded that the appropriate solution had been reached, in addition to achieving a much smoother flight.<ref>Enciclopedia Ilustrada de la Aviaci\u00f3n: Vol.5/pag.1153, Edit.

Additionally, this battalion provides communications networking and law enforcement support across the GCE. The headquarters battalion also includes the division band, whose tactical mission is to serve as a provisional rifle platoon in providing division headquarters security.\n\nNote: Some GCE battalions and regiments are provided air liaison officers/forward air controllers (i.e., Marine Corps naval aviators \u2014 aircraft pilots, and naval flight officers \u2014 airborne weapons and sensor systems officers) with specialized skills in coordinating air support of ground units) from the Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW) of the aviation combat element (ACE). These officers facilitate employment of Marine aviation in support of GCE units to perform offensive air support (e.g., close air support), assault support (e.g., troop, cargo, and casualty transport, aerial command and control, liaison, communications, and illumination, and close-in fire support by light/attack helicopters), and aerial reconnaissance (e.g., tactical reconnaissance and artillery spotting).\n\n====Infantry battalions====\n\n[[Ground combat element#U.S. Marine Corps Infantry|'''Infantry''']] battalions are the heart and soul of the [[ground combat element]]. The mission of locating, closing with, and destroying the enemy with fire and maneuver and repelling the enemy's assault with fire and close combat lies with the \"[[Infantry|grunts]]\". [[Battalion#United States Marine Corps|Marine infantry battalions]] often have limited organic equipment outside of small arms, infantry crew-served weapons (e.g., heavy machine guns, medium mortars, and anti-tank missiles), and a few light tactical trucks. Marine infantry primarily maneuvers by foot as [[light infantry]], and must be supplemented with additional [[List of vehicles of the U.S. Marine Corps#Wheeled Vehicles|trucks]] to become [[motorized infantry]] or [[Amphibious Assault Vehicle]]s to become [[mechanized infantry]].\n\nA Marine infantry battalion is usually organized into three [[Company (military unit)#Marine Corps|rifle companies]], a [[Weapons company#United States Marine Corps|weapons company]], and a [[headquarters and service company]]. The rifle company has a company [[Headquarters#Military|headquarters]], three rifle [[Platoon#United States Marine Corps|platoons]], with three rifle [[Squad#United States Marine Corps|squads]] each, and a weapons platoon with [[M240 machine gun|medium machinegun]]s, [[M224 Mortar|mortar]]s, and [[Shoulder-launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon|assault]] [[FGM-172 SRAW|weapons]] [[Section (military unit)#United States Marine Corps|sections]]. The weapons company includes a company headquarters, a [[M2 Browning machine gun|heavy]] [[Mk 19 grenade launcher|machinegun]] platoon, an [[M252 Mortar|81mm mortar]] platoon, and an [[FGM-148 Javelin|anti]][[BGM-71 TOW|armor]] platoon. Sometimes, the commander will mix these into [[Combined Anti-Armor Team]]s. The headquarters and service company includes all [[command and control|command]], [[Military administration|administration]], [[intelligence]], [[Military operation|operations]], [[logistics]], and [[military communication|communication]] Marines and equipment, as well as the battalion's  [[Scout Sniper]] platoon and Battalion Aid Station (BAS) staffed by U.S. Navy [[Hospital Corpsman]].\n\n[[File:INDIA5.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Riflemen]] ]]\n[[File:AfghUSpatrolDOD.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Marines on patrol]]\n[[File:M82 Sniper.JPEG|thumb|right|250px|Marine [[Scout Sniper|scout sniper]] ]]\n[[File:3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines - RIMPAC 2004.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mechanized Marines]]\n[[File:M2 - 24th MEU.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Machine gunner with [[M2 Browning machine gun|M2 .50cal]] ]]\n[[File:Hmmwv-036.jpg|thumb|right|250px|TOW [[anti-tank]] missile.]]\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!

battalions====\n[[Field artillery]] units provide indirect, long-range cannon and rocket fire support for the [[Marine Air-Ground Task Force]].\nCurrently, artillery regiments contain two or three (11th Marines only) cannon battalions and are equipped with the [[M777 howitzer|M777 lightweight, towed, 155 mm, medium howitzer]] and the [[Dragon fire (mortar)|Expeditionary Fire Support System (EFSS) 120 mm, heavy mortar]]. Two regiments (11th Marines and 14th Marines) also have one rocket battalion equipped with the [[M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System]] (HIMARS) equipped with the [[MGM-140 ATACMS]] surface-to-surface, guided missile.\nMarine artillery battalions contain a [[Headquarters and Service Company#Headquarters Battery (Field Artillery) and Headquarters and Service Battery (LAAD)|Headquarters Battery]] and three or four firing [[Artillery Battery#United States Marine Corps|batteries]].\nFiring batteries contain a headquarters platoon (including a liaison section with three [[Field artillery#Forward Observer|forward observer teams]]) and one or two firing platoons (depending upon weapons systems). The firing platoon(s) contain a battery operations center, a [[Field artillery#FDC (Fire Direction Center)|fire direction center]], and four or six artillery sections (depending upon weapon system).

When task-organized with infantry, tanks, and other forces, the battalion conducts combined arms operations as a separate maneuver element in support of the [[List of United States Marine Corps divisions|Marine Division]].\n\nCurrently, Assault Amphibian (AA) battalions utilize the [[Amphibious Assault Vehicle]] (AAVP-7A1) and consist of a headquarters and service company and two to six AA companies. Each AA company is equipped with 42 AAVs (including personnel, command, and recovery variants) organized into three platoons of 12 AAVs each and an additional six AAVs in the company headquarters. Each AA platoon is capable of transporting an entire Marine rifle company plus any dismounted attachments (e.g., mortar forward observer teams, anti-tank missile crews, scout/sniper or reconnaissance squads) thus transforming into amphibious/mechanized infantry. (One AA company is capable of transporting the assault echelon of a Marine infantry battalion.)  Although plans were in place to replace it with the [[Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle]], the cancellation of the program is going to prolong use of the AAV.\n\n[[Light Armored Reconnaissance]] (LAR) battalions use the [[LAV 25]] series of vehicles and consist of a headquarters and service company and four LAR companies. Each LAR company is equipped with 25 LAVs (including 14 LAV-25, two mortar, four anti-tank, one command & control, three logistics, and one recovery variant).\n\n[[File:LAV-25 armored vehicle.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[LAV 25]] ]]\n[[File:USMarines AAV Iraq apr 2004 116 hires.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Amphibious Assault Vehicle|AAVP-7A1]] ]]\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!

Counter mobility includes creating obstacles and barriers for the enemy, which could include the destruction of structures and/or bridges. Survivability includes the [[fortification]] of positions and the construction of new outposts. Other jobs can include [[Explosive Ordnance Disposal]] (EOD), construction, and utilities (such as generators and refrigeration).\nCurrently, combat engineers use a variety of tools for their trade. Some vehicles include the [[M9 Armored Combat Earthmover]], [[Caterpillar D7|D7 Bulldozer]], [[M60A1 Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge (AVLB)|M60A1 Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge]], and various [[Crane (machine)|cranes]] and [[forklifts]].

They specialize in [[amphibious warfare|amphibious]] recon, including [[hydrography]]; as well as [[airborne forces|airborne]] recon, [[Infiltration tactics|infiltration]] via surface, subsurface and airborne operations, and conducting limited scale raids and ambushes. The battalions consist of a headquarters and service company and one to four reconnaissance companies (divisional assets, individual companies usually attached to an RCT). All battalions (except 4th Recon) also have a force reconnaissance company dedicated to provide deep reconnaissance and direct action capability to a MEF HQ. (Two additional separate force reconnaissance companies exist in the Marine Forces Reserve.)\n\n[[File:US Marines on reconnaissance exercise 2003.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Recon Marines]]\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!

Additionally, this battalion provides communications networking and law enforcement support across the LCE.  The headquarters and service battalion also provides specialized services, including: military postal service, Marine Corps Exchange (MCX), and other personal services, to units of all four MAGTF elements (i.e., GCE, ACE, LCE, and CE).\n\n====Combat Logistics battalions====\nCombat logistics battalions (CLB) provide combat service support for the GCE and ACE beyond their organic capabilities. The battalions primarily provide motor transport and logistics control and materiel handling (i.e., landing support) services, and limited engineer, maintenance, and supply services, to dedicated Regimental Combat Teams (RCT) or Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU). CLBs that support RCTs typically consist of a headquarters and service company, and three support companies (engineer, maintenance, and transportation); those CLBs that support MEUs typically consist of several functional units (individual units may be styled as either a section, platoon, detachment, or company depending upon the size of unit, function, and the unit's parent battalion/regiment/group). In addition to a headquarters and service unit, these CLBs contain units dedicated to providing: air delivery, communications, engineer, explosive ordnance disposal, health services (medical and dental), landing support, law enforcement (military police), maintenance, motor transport, and supply support to the MEU.  \n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- bgcolor=#CCCCCC\"\n!

However, intelligence (i.e., ground intelligence) may also be considered as a GCE function (primarily located in the infantry battalion scout/sniper platoon) and communications and law enforcement may also be considered as logistics functions. Most GCE battalions and regiments, and ACE squadrons/battalions (LAAD), Marine aircraft groups (MAGs), and Marine air control groups (MACGs), contain some organic communications assets such as battalion and regimental communications platoons, MARDIV and MLG communications companies, and Marine wing communications squadrons. In addition, MARDIVs, Marine Aircraft Wings (MAWs), and MLGs also possess a limited organic law enforcement capability.\n\n====Communications battalions====\nCommunications battalions provide [[military communication|communication]] support for the MAGTF as part of the MEF headquarters groups. They also perform networking and data services when deployed. The battalions typically consist of a headquarters and service company, three communications companies, and a support (maintenance) company.  \n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!

Marine Corps Bulletin 5400, released in September 2011, called for the reactivation of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Military Police Battalions, now designated as law enforcement battalions, in each Marine Expeditionary Force and Marine Forces Reserve. Three law enforcement battalions were activated in June 2012, with each battalion consisting of a headquarters and service company and two or more law enforcement companies.<ref>{{cite web|author=<!-- Byline --> By Julie WatsonThe Associated Press |url=http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/article/20120723/NEWS/207230326/Corps-creates-law-enforcement-battalions |title=Corps creates law enforcement battalions &#124; Marine Corps Times |publisher=marinecorpstimes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-15}}</ref> Each included \"500 military police officers and dozens of dogs.\"<ref>https://www.military.com/daily-news/2012/07/23/marine-corps-creates-law-enforcement-battalions.html</ref> It is not clear whether the newspaper story quoting the figure of 500 was referring to 'police officers' - Marines specialising as police, in which case the figure might be roughly correct, or military officers, in which case the figure of 500 would be very high.

Col. who is assisted by an executive officer and an executive staff (S-1, S-2, etc.). The company's organic platoons often operate independently and are normally commanded by a major (ANGLICO) or captain (FORECON).\n\nAir Naval Gunfire Liaison companies (ANGLICO) provide Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) commanders a liaison capability, with foreign area expertise, to plan, coordinate, and conduct terminal control of fires in support of joint, allied, and coalition forces. ANGLICO units are separate companies (i.e., not organic to a battalion or regiment) reporting directly to one of the three MEF HQ Groups (1st, 2nd, & 5th ANGLICO) or the Forces HQ Group, Marine Forces Reserve (3rd, 4th, and 6th ANGLICO).\n\nFleet Marine Force Reconnaissance (FORECON) companies provide Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) commanders with deep reconnaissance and direct action capability. The FORECON companies of the three MEFs are organic to their respective divisional reconnaissance battalions and are under operational control of their parent MEF HQ Group. The 3rd and 4th FORECON companies are separate companies reporting directly to the Forces HQ Group, Marine Forces Reserve and are dedicated to supporting II MEF and I MEF, respectively, whenever a MEF's active duty FORECON company is not available.\n \n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!

Additionally, this battalion provides communications networking and law enforcement support across the GCE. The headquarters battalion also includes the division band, whose tactical mission is to serve as a provisional rifle platoon in providing division headquarters security.\n\nNote: Some GCE battalions and regiments are provided air liaison officers/forward air controllers (i.e., Marine Corps naval aviators \u2014 aircraft pilots, and naval flight officers \u2014 airborne weapons and sensor systems officers) with specialized skills in coordinating air support of ground units) from the Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW) of the aviation combat element (ACE). These officers facilitate employment of Marine aviation in support of GCE units to perform offensive air support (e.g., close air support), assault support (e.g., troop, cargo, and casualty transport, aerial command and control, liaison, communications, and illumination, and close-in fire support by light/attack helicopters), and aerial reconnaissance (e.g., tactical reconnaissance and artillery spotting).\n\n====Infantry battalions====\n\n[[Ground combat element#U.S. Marine Corps Infantry|'''Infantry''']] battalions are the heart and soul of the [[ground combat element]]. The mission of locating, closing with, and destroying the enemy with fire and maneuver and repelling the enemy's assault with fire and close combat lies with the \"[[Infantry|grunts]]\". [[Battalion#United States Marine Corps|Marine infantry battalions]] often have limited organic equipment outside of small arms, infantry crew-served weapons (e.g., heavy machine guns, medium mortars, and anti-tank missiles), and a few light tactical trucks. Marine infantry primarily maneuvers by foot as [[light infantry]], and must be supplemented with additional [[List of vehicles of the U.S. Marine Corps#Wheeled Vehicles|trucks]] to become [[motorized infantry]] or [[Amphibious Assault Vehicle]]s to become [[mechanized infantry]].\n\nA Marine infantry battalion is usually organized into three [[Company (military unit)#Marine Corps|rifle companies]], a [[Weapons company#United States Marine Corps|weapons company]], and a [[headquarters and service company]]. The rifle company has a company [[Headquarters#Military|headquarters]], three rifle [[Platoon#United States Marine Corps|platoons]], with three rifle [[Squad#United States Marine Corps|squads]] each, and a weapons platoon with [[M240 machine gun|medium machinegun]]s, [[M224 Mortar|mortar]]s, and [[Shoulder-launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon|assault]] [[FGM-172 SRAW|weapons]] [[Section (military unit)#United States Marine Corps|sections]]. The weapons company includes a company headquarters, a [[M2 Browning machine gun|heavy]] [[Mk 19 grenade launcher|machinegun]] platoon, an [[M252 Mortar|81mm mortar]] platoon, and an [[FGM-148 Javelin|anti]][[BGM-71 TOW|armor]] platoon. Sometimes, the commander will mix these into [[Combined Anti-Armor Team]]s. The headquarters and service company includes all [[command and control|command]], [[Military administration|administration]], [[intelligence]], [[Military operation|operations]], [[logistics]], and [[military communication|communication]] Marines and equipment, as well as the battalion's  [[Scout Sniper]] platoon and Battalion Aid Station (BAS) staffed by U.S. Navy [[Hospital Corpsman]].\n\n[[File:INDIA5.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Riflemen]] ]]\n[[File:AfghUSpatrolDOD.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Marines on patrol]]\n[[File:M82 Sniper.JPEG|thumb|right|250px|Marine [[Scout Sniper|scout sniper]] ]]\n[[File:3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines - RIMPAC 2004.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mechanized Marines]]\n[[File:M2 - 24th MEU.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Machine gunner with [[M2 Browning machine gun|M2 .50cal]] ]]\n[[File:Hmmwv-036.jpg|thumb|right|250px|TOW [[anti-tank]] missile.]]\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!

battalions====\n[[Field artillery]] units provide indirect, long-range cannon and rocket fire support for the [[Marine Air-Ground Task Force]].\nCurrently, artillery regiments contain two or three (11th Marines only) cannon battalions and are equipped with the [[M777 howitzer|M777 lightweight, towed, 155 mm, medium howitzer]] and the [[Dragon fire (mortar)|Expeditionary Fire Support System (EFSS) 120 mm, heavy mortar]]. Two regiments (11th Marines and 14th Marines) also have one rocket battalion equipped with the [[M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System]] (HIMARS) equipped with the [[MGM-140 ATACMS]] surface-to-surface, guided missile.\nMarine artillery battalions contain a [[Headquarters and Service Company#Headquarters Battery (Field Artillery) and Headquarters and Service Battery (LAAD)|Headquarters Battery]] and three or four firing [[Artillery Battery#United States Marine Corps|batteries]].\nFiring batteries contain a headquarters platoon (including a liaison section with three [[Field artillery#Forward Observer|forward observer teams]]) and one or two firing platoons (depending upon weapons systems). The firing platoon(s) contain a battery operations center, a [[Field artillery#FDC (Fire Direction Center)|fire direction center]], and four or six artillery sections (depending upon weapon system). [[Counter-battery radar]] is usually a regimental asset, but can be detached to augment battalions or batteries.\n\n[[File:M777 howitzer rear.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[M777 howitzer]] firing]]\n[[File:4-14 Marines in Fallujah.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[M198 howitzer]] firing]]\n[[File:HIMARS DA-SD-07-43938.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[HIMARS]] firing]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!

When task-organized with infantry, tanks, and other forces, the battalion conducts combined arms operations as a separate maneuver element in support of the [[List of United States Marine Corps divisions|Marine Division]].\n\nCurrently, Assault Amphibian (AA) battalions utilize the [[Amphibious Assault Vehicle]] (AAVP-7A1) and consist of a headquarters and service company and two to six AA companies. Each AA company is equipped with 42 AAVs (including personnel, command, and recovery variants) organized into three platoons of 12 AAVs each and an additional six AAVs in the company headquarters. Each AA platoon is capable of transporting an entire Marine rifle company plus any dismounted attachments (e.g., mortar forward observer teams, anti-tank missile crews, scout/sniper or reconnaissance squads) thus transforming into amphibious/mechanized infantry. (One AA company is capable of transporting the assault echelon of a Marine infantry battalion.)  Although plans were in place to replace it with the [[Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle]], the cancellation of the program is going to prolong use of the AAV.\n\n[[Light Armored Reconnaissance]] (LAR) battalions use the [[LAV 25]] series of vehicles and consist of a headquarters and service company and four LAR companies. Each LAR company is equipped with 25 LAVs (including 14 LAV-25, two mortar, four anti-tank, one command & control, three logistics, and one recovery variant).\n\n[[File:LAV-25 armored vehicle.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[LAV 25]] ]]\n[[File:USMarines AAV Iraq apr 2004 116 hires.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Amphibious Assault Vehicle|AAVP-7A1]] ]]\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!

Counter mobility includes creating obstacles and barriers for the enemy, which could include the destruction of structures and/or bridges. Survivability includes the [[fortification]] of positions and the construction of new outposts. Other jobs can include [[Explosive Ordnance Disposal]] (EOD), construction, and utilities (such as generators and refrigeration).\nCurrently, combat engineers use a variety of tools for their trade. Some vehicles include the [[M9 Armored Combat Earthmover]], [[Caterpillar D7|D7 Bulldozer]], [[M60A1 Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge (AVLB)|M60A1 Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge]], and various [[Crane (machine)|cranes]] and [[forklifts]]. Each combat engineer battalion consists of a headquarters and service company, three combat engineer companies, one mobility assault company, and an engineer support company.\n\n[[File:D7marines01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Caterpillar D7|D7 Bulldozer]] ]]\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!

They specialize in [[amphibious warfare|amphibious]] recon, including [[hydrography]]; as well as [[airborne forces|airborne]] recon, [[Infiltration tactics|infiltration]] via surface, subsurface and airborne operations, and conducting limited scale raids and ambushes. The battalions consist of a headquarters and service company and one to four reconnaissance companies (divisional assets, individual companies usually attached to an RCT). All battalions (except 4th Recon) also have a force reconnaissance company dedicated to provide deep reconnaissance and direct action capability to a MEF HQ. (Two additional separate force reconnaissance companies exist in the Marine Forces Reserve.)\n\n[[File:US Marines on reconnaissance exercise 2003.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Recon Marines]]\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!

Additionally, this battalion provides communications networking and law enforcement support across the LCE.  The headquarters and service battalion also provides specialized services, including: military postal service, Marine Corps Exchange (MCX), and other personal services, to units of all four MAGTF elements (i.e., GCE, ACE, LCE, and CE).\n\n====Combat Logistics battalions====\nCombat logistics battalions (CLB) provide combat service support for the GCE and ACE beyond their organic capabilities. The battalions primarily provide motor transport and logistics control and materiel handling (i.e., landing support) services, and limited engineer, maintenance, and supply services, to dedicated Regimental Combat Teams (RCT) or Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU). CLBs that support RCTs typically consist of a headquarters and service company, and three support companies (engineer, maintenance, and transportation); those CLBs that support MEUs typically consist of several functional units (individual units may be styled as either a section, platoon, detachment, or company depending upon the size of unit, function, and the unit's parent battalion/regiment/group). In addition to a headquarters and service unit, these CLBs contain units dedicated to providing: air delivery, communications, engineer, explosive ordnance disposal, health services (medical and dental), landing support, law enforcement (military police), maintenance, motor transport, and supply support to the MEU.  \n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- bgcolor=#CCCCCC\"\n!

However, intelligence (i.e., ground intelligence) may also be considered as a GCE function (primarily located in the infantry battalion scout/sniper platoon) and communications and law enforcement may also be considered as logistics functions. Most GCE battalions and regiments, and ACE squadrons/battalions (LAAD), Marine aircraft groups (MAGs), and Marine air control groups (MACGs), contain some organic communications assets such as battalion and regimental communications platoons, MARDIV and MLG communications companies, and Marine wing communications squadrons. In addition, MARDIVs, Marine Aircraft Wings (MAWs), and MLGs also possess a limited organic law enforcement capability.\n\n====Communications battalions====\nCommunications battalions provide [[military communication|communication]] support for the MAGTF as part of the MEF headquarters groups. They also perform networking and data services when deployed. The battalions typically consist of a headquarters and service company, three communications companies, and a support (maintenance) company.  \n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!

Marine Corps Bulletin 5400, released in September 2011, called for the reactivation of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Military Police Battalions, now designated as law enforcement battalions, in each Marine Expeditionary Force and Marine Forces Reserve. Three law enforcement battalions were activated in June 2012, with each battalion consisting of a headquarters and service company and two or more law enforcement companies.<ref>{{cite web|author=<!-- Byline --> By Julie WatsonThe Associated Press |url=http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/article/20120723/NEWS/207230326/Corps-creates-law-enforcement-battalions |title=Corps creates law enforcement battalions &#124; Marine Corps Times |publisher=marinecorpstimes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-15}}</ref> Each included \"500 military police officers [''sic''] and dozens of dogs.\"<ref>https://www.military.com/daily-news/2012/07/23/marine-corps-creates-law-enforcement-battalions.html</ref> (Note: As military units, each battalion contains only about 30 to 40 \"officers,\" as the majority of the military police Marines are enlisted members and not officers. \"Officers\" as in any military organization, command the battalion and its organic companies and platoons and serve as staff officers in the battalion headquarters.)\n\nNew structural plans made public in March 2020 indicated that the law enforcement battalions would be disestablished as part of future reorganization.<ref>https://www.military.com/daily-news/2020/03/23/marines-shut-down-all-tank-units-cut-infantry-battalions-major-overhaul.html</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!

ANGLICO units are separate companies (i.e., not organic to a battalion or regiment) reporting directly to one of the three MEF HQ Groups (1st, 2nd, & 5th ANGLICO) or the Forces HQ Group, Marine Forces Reserve (3rd, 4th, and 6th ANGLICO).\n\nFleet Marine Force Reconnaissance (FORECON) companies provide Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) commanders with deep reconnaissance and direct action capability. The FORECON companies of the three MEFs are organic to their respective divisional reconnaissance battalions and are under operational control of their parent MEF HQ Group. The 3rd and 4th FORECON companies are separate companies reporting directly to the Forces HQ Group, Marine Forces Reserve and are dedicated to supporting II MEF and I MEF, respectively, whenever a MEF's active duty FORECON company is not available.\n \n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n!
