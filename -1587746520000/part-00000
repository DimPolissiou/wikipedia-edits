Among these was Amado Carrillo Fuentes, who employed them as hitmen and transporters. Carrillo Fuentes ran the powerful Juarez Cartel and asked them to begin establishing drug trafficking routes stretching south to Colombia and north into the United States. \nThe BLO became allies of [[Los Zetas Cartel]], the former armed wing of the Gulf Cartel. The two organizations complement each other. The Zetas have their power base on the eastern U.S.-Mexico border and operate along the Caribbean coast through Central America. The BLO had its power base in the west, in Guerrero, Morelos and the State of Mexico. Combined, they had some of the more sophisticated and well-equipped paramilitaries in Mexico. However, there were also negatives. The two were allied for practical rather than ideological or family reasons. Their bond comes from their common enemy: the Sinaloa Cartel. Their alliance was therefore fragile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wradio.com.mx/nota.aspx?id=800464 |title=Revela laptop operaciones de los Beltr\u00e1n Leyva |publisher=Wradio.com.mx |accessdate=March 28, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=La Jornada |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2008/05/10/index.php?section=politica&article=003n1pol |title=Sinaloa, en jaque por la violencia tras ser asesinado hijo del Chapo |publisher=Jornada.unam.mx |accessdate=March 28, 2011}}</ref> Since February 2010 they fought along Los Zetas against all other Mexican cartels.<ref name='MexiData'/> The [[South Pacific Cartel]] is a branch of the splintered Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Cartel.<ref>{{cite news | first = Justino Miranda | title = Arresto de \"El Ponchis\" exhibe vac\u00edos legales | date = December 4, 2010 | url = http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/primera/35971.html | work = El Universal | accessdate = December 6, 2010 | language = Spanish}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe Beltr\u00e1n Leyva clan was ruthless and ambitious. Their home municipality, Badiraguato, is the same that of as [[Joaquin Guzman Loera]], and there is some evidence they worked together as hitmen in the infamous Guadalajara Cartel.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Through marriage, the Guzman Loera and Beltran Leyva families became closer and more tightly aligned. This connection proved critical when Guzman was jailed in 1993. The Beltran Leyva brothers helped Guzman's brother, Arturo, maintain the business; they supplied cash to Guzman while in prison and helped him escape in 2001.\n\nGuzman's escape, the capture of his brother Arturo several months later, and the death of Carrillo Fuentes opened the door for the Beltran Leyva brothers. After several meetings in 2002 with Guzman and his partners, [[Juan Jose Esparragoza Moreno]], and [[Ismael Zambada Garcia]], the group formed what became known as The Federation, or the \"Alianza de Sangre\" (Blood Alliance); [[Alfredo Beltran Leyva]] is married to Guzman's cousin. Esparragoza married Guzman's sister-in-law. Guzman later married the niece of another partner, [[Ignacio Coronel Villarreal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/179403.html|title=El Universal - Naci\u00f3n - El c\u00e1rtel de Sinaloa, una \"alianza de sangre\"|date=July 10, 2015|work=El Universal|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs godfather to [[Amado Carrillo Fuentes]]\u2019 son, Esparragoza was also closely tied to the Carrillo Fuentes clan. That Juarez-based family was brought into the pact in the 2002, but it would not last. In 2004, Amado Carrillo Fuentes' brother, Rodolfo Carrillo Fuentes killed two of Guzman's operatives in Ciudad Juarez. Guzman had him assassinated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noroeste.com.mx/publicaciones.php?id=409384|title=La muerte de Rodolfo Carrillo|publisher=|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref> Faced with a choice, Zambada and Esparragoza picked Guzman's side, and the war between the Sinaloa and Juarez organizations has raged ever since.<ref>http://elorbe.com/seccion-politica/articulos/10/17/el-violento-retador-de-el-chapo.html</ref>\n\nIn the meantime, the Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Organization (BLO) began to build their power. Guzman commissioned as his security team and armed wing to combat the rising power of their other rivals, the Gulf Cartel. A few years earlier, the Gulf Cartel had lured 31 special forces officers from the Mexican military to create a powerful, sophisticated and brutal armed wing that called themselves [[Los Zetas]]. The BLO recruited their own operatives. One operative, [[Edgar Valdez Villareal]] formed an armed wing, [[Los Pelones]], and began to match Zetas\u2019 brutality. Another allied armed group, [[Los Negros]], was led by a former police detective. At the top of the pyramid was [[Arturo Beltran Leyva]]. Arturo created his own unit which he called \"Arturo's Special Forces\" (Fuerzas Especiales de Arturo \u2013 FEDA). The war soon spread, as did the BLO's power and influence. By 2005, the BLO was reportedly operating in 11 states: Guerrero, Morelos, Chiapas, Queretaro, Sinaloa, Jalisco, Quintana Roo, Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, Mexico State and the Federal District (Mexico City).{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nGuzman also tasked the Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva clan with penetrating the security and political forces, which they did with efficiency. In 2005, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) recorded a conversation between Nahum Acosta, a close advisor to the Fox administration, and one of the Beltran Leyva, presumably Hector.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4240561.stm |work=BBC News | title=Mexican aide held on 'drug links' | date=February 6, 2005}}</ref> Hector was responsible for payroll, which also allegedly included top members of the government's National Investigative Agency (Agencia Federal de Investigacion \u2013 AFI) and the country's drug czar, [[Noe Ramirez Mandujano]].<ref name=\"carlos captured\"/> Ramirez is in jail awaiting trial for allegedly receiving US$450,000 per month from the organization; Acosta was arrested but later exonerated.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/latinamerica/la-fg-bribe22-2008nov22,0,5384359.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Ken | last=Ellingwood | title=Mexico traffickers bribed former anti-drug chief, officials say | date=November 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe BLO, however, suffered from hubris. Their public profile steadily rose, as did their public appearances in extravagant parties in places like Cuernavaca where their domain was undisputed.  Added to this was a dispute over a distribution route in Chicago between the Sinaloa faction and the BLO. Tension boiled over when authorities arrested Alfredo Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva on January 21, 2008. After authorities released Guzman's son, Ivan Archivaldo, from jail on a technicality, Arturo Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva assumed that Guzman had provided the information leading to the arrest of his younger brother Alfredo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.borderlandbeat.com/2010/08/beltran-leyva-cartel.html|title=Borderland Beat: Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Cartel|author=Buggs|publisher=|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWar was declared, and one of the first victims was Edgar Guzman, Joaquin Guzman's son, who was killed when he left a Sinaloa shopping center with his bodyguards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.informador.com.mx/mexico/2008/10962/6/confirman-muerte-de-hijo-del-chapo.htm|title=Confirman muerte de hijo del Chapo|work=EL INFORMADOR|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>\nThe levels of bloodshed in Sinaloa increased. The BLO allied themselves with their former arch-rivals, Los Zetas. The Sinaloa Cartel reached working agreements with the Gulf Cartel and the Familia Michoacana, a ruthless group that had burst onto the scene in 2006. Throughout, Guzman, Zambada and Esparragoza remained aligned against the BLO.\nUsing their contacts in the federal government, the Sinaloa Cartel wore down the BLO. Dozens of operatives were arrested or killed in 2009. And in December 2009, Mexican Marines killed Arturo Beltran Leyva after he\u2019d barricaded himself into an apartment in an upscale neighborhood in Cuernavaca.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lavozlibre.com/noticias/ampliar/29927/arturo-beltran-leyva-resucita-en-sus-fotos-mas-sangrientas|title=Arturo Beltr\u00e1n Leyva resucita en sus fotos m\u00e1s sangrientas|publisher=|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe year 2010 was even worse for the BLO.

Among these was Amado Carrillo Fuentes, who employed them as hitmen and transporters. Carrillo Fuentes ran the powerful Juarez Cartel and asked them to begin establishing drug trafficking routes stretching south to Colombia and north into the United States. \nThe BLO became allies of [[Los Zetas Cartel]], the former armed wing of the Gulf Cartel. The two organizations complement each other. The Zetas have their power base on the eastern U.S.-Mexico border and operate along the Caribbean coast through Central America. The BLO had its power base in the west, in Guerrero, Morelos and the State of Mexico. Combined, they had some of the more sophisticated and well-equipped paramilitaries in Mexico. However, there were also negatives. The two were allied for practical rather than ideological or family reasons. Their bond comes from their common enemy: the Sinaloa Cartel. Their alliance was therefore fragile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wradio.com.mx/nota.aspx?id=800464 |title=Revela laptop operaciones de los Beltr\u00e1n Leyva |publisher=Wradio.com.mx |accessdate=2011-03-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=La Jornada |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2008/05/10/index.php?section=politica&article=003n1pol |title=Sinaloa, en jaque por la violencia tras ser asesinado hijo del Chapo |publisher=Jornada.unam.mx |accessdate=2011-03-28}}</ref> Since February 2010 they fought along Los Zetas against all other Mexican cartels.<ref name='MexiData'/> The [[South Pacific Cartel]] is a branch of the splintered Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Cartel.<ref>{{cite news | first = Justino Miranda | title = Arresto de \"El Ponchis\" exhibe vac\u00edos legales | date = December 4, 2010 | url = http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/primera/35971.html | work = El Universal | accessdate = 2010-12-06 | language = Spanish}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe Beltr\u00e1n Leyva clan was ruthless and ambitious. Their home municipality, Badiraguato, is the same that of as [[Joaquin Guzman Loera]], and there is some evidence they worked together as hitmen in the infamous Guadalajara Cartel.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Through marriage, the Guzman Loera and Beltran Leyva families became closer and more tightly aligned. This connection proved critical when Guzman was jailed in 1993. The Beltran Leyva brothers helped Guzman's brother, Arturo, maintain the business; they supplied cash to Guzman while in prison and helped him escape in 2001.\n\nGuzman's escape, the capture of his brother Arturo several months later, and the death of Carrillo Fuentes opened the door for the Beltran Leyva brothers. After several meetings in 2002 with Guzman and his partners, [[Juan Jose Esparragoza Moreno]], and [[Ismael Zambada Garcia]], the group formed what became known as The Federation, or the \"Alianza de Sangre\" (Blood Alliance); [[Alfredo Beltran Leyva]] is married to Guzman's cousin. Esparragoza married Guzman's sister-in-law. Guzman later married the niece of another partner, [[Ignacio Coronel Villarreal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/179403.html|title=El Universal - Naci\u00f3n - El c\u00e1rtel de Sinaloa, una \"alianza de sangre\"|date=July 10, 2015|work=El Universal|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs godfather to [[Amado Carrillo Fuentes]]\u2019 son, Esparragoza was also closely tied to the Carrillo Fuentes clan. That Juarez-based family was brought into the pact in the 2002, but it would not last. In 2004, Amado Carrillo Fuentes' brother, Rodolfo Carrillo Fuentes killed two of Guzman's operatives in Ciudad Juarez. Guzman had him assassinated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noroeste.com.mx/publicaciones.php?id=409384|title=La muerte de Rodolfo Carrillo|publisher=|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref> Faced with a choice, Zambada and Esparragoza picked Guzman's side, and the war between the Sinaloa and Juarez organizations has raged ever since.<ref>http://elorbe.com/seccion-politica/articulos/10/17/el-violento-retador-de-el-chapo.html</ref>\n\nIn the meantime, the Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Organization (BLO) began to build their power. Guzman commissioned as his security team and armed wing to combat the rising power of their other rivals, the Gulf Cartel. A few years earlier, the Gulf Cartel had lured 31 special forces officers from the Mexican military to create a powerful, sophisticated and brutal armed wing that called themselves [[Los Zetas]]. The BLO recruited their own operatives. One operative, [[Edgar Valdez Villareal]] formed an armed wing, [[Los Pelones]], and began to match Zetas\u2019 brutality. Another allied armed group, [[Los Negros]], was led by a former police detective. At the top of the pyramid was [[Arturo Beltran Leyva]]. Arturo created his own unit which he called \"Arturo's Special Forces\" (Fuerzas Especiales de Arturo \u2013 FEDA). The war soon spread, as did the BLO's power and influence. By 2005, the BLO was reportedly operating in 11 states: Guerrero, Morelos, Chiapas, Queretaro, Sinaloa, Jalisco, Quintana Roo, Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, Mexico State and the Federal District (Mexico City).{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nGuzman also tasked the Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva clan with penetrating the security and political forces, which they did with efficiency. In 2005, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) recorded a conversation between Nahum Acosta, a close advisor to the Fox administration, and one of the Beltran Leyva, presumably Hector.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4240561.stm |work=BBC News | title=Mexican aide held on 'drug links' | date=February 6, 2005}}</ref> Hector was responsible for payroll, which also allegedly included top members of the government's National Investigative Agency (Agencia Federal de Investigacion \u2013 AFI) and the country's drug czar, [[Noe Ramirez Mandujano]].<ref name=\"carlos captured\"/> Ramirez is in jail awaiting trial for allegedly receiving US$450,000 per month from the organization; Acosta was arrested but later exonerated.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/latinamerica/la-fg-bribe22-2008nov22,0,5384359.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Ken | last=Ellingwood | title=Mexico traffickers bribed former anti-drug chief, officials say | date=November 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe BLO, however, suffered from hubris. Their public profile steadily rose, as did their public appearances in extravagant parties in places like Cuernavaca where their domain was undisputed.  Added to this was a dispute over a distribution route in Chicago between the Sinaloa faction and the BLO. Tension boiled over when authorities arrested Alfredo Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva on January 21, 2008. After authorities released Guzman's son, Ivan Archivaldo, from jail on a technicality, Arturo Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva assumed that Guzman had provided the information leading to the arrest of his younger brother Alfredo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.borderlandbeat.com/2010/08/beltran-leyva-cartel.html|title=Borderland Beat: Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Cartel|author=Buggs|publisher=|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWar was declared, and one of the first victims was Edgar Guzman, Joaquin Guzman's son, who was killed when he left a Sinaloa shopping center with his bodyguards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.informador.com.mx/mexico/2008/10962/6/confirman-muerte-de-hijo-del-chapo.htm|title=Confirman muerte de hijo del Chapo|work=EL INFORMADOR|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>\nThe levels of bloodshed in Sinaloa increased. The BLO allied themselves with their former arch-rivals, Los Zetas. The Sinaloa Cartel reached working agreements with the Gulf Cartel and the Familia Michoacana, a ruthless group that had burst onto the scene in 2006. Throughout, Guzman, Zambada and Esparragoza remained aligned against the BLO.\nUsing their contacts in the federal government, the Sinaloa Cartel wore down the BLO. Dozens of operatives were arrested or killed in 2009. And in December, 2009, Mexican Marines killed Arturo Beltran Leyva after he\u2019d barricaded himself into an apartment in an upscale neighborhood in Cuernavaca.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lavozlibre.com/noticias/ampliar/29927/arturo-beltran-leyva-resucita-en-sus-fotos-mas-sangrientas|title=Arturo Beltr\u00e1n Leyva resucita en sus fotos m\u00e1s sangrientas|publisher=|accessdate=April 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe year 2010 was even worse for the BLO.

For political and historical reasons, it received the status of a minority language in 2005 within the framework of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. [[linguistics|Linguistically]], however, it is seen as somewhat [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] [[dialect]] of the [[Finnish language]], and grouped together with the [[Per\u00e4pohjola dialects]] such as [[Me\u00e4nkieli]], spoken in [[Me\u00e4nmaa|Torne Valley]] in [[Sweden]]. It is generally considered a language in Norway and mostly considered a dialect in Finland.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the dialects spoken by the Kvens and [[Kainuu]] peoples are not closely related. The Kainuu dialect is one of the [[Savo Finnish|Savonian dialects]] that was formed from the 16th century onwards, when immigrants from [[Savonia (historical province)|Savonia]] started to settle in the northern wastelands.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThe Kven language has come to incorporate many Norwegian [[loanword]]s, such as ''tysk\u00e4l\u00e4inen'' (from the Norwegian word ''tysk'', meaning ''German'') instead of standard Finnish ''saksalainen''. The Kven language also uses some old Finnish words that are no longer used in [[Finland]].\n\nThere are about 1,500 to 10,000 known native speakers of this language, most of whom are over the age of 60. This population uses it as their main way of communicating and speaks no other language. This is a growing concern because as this population ages and soon die, there is fear that the Kven language will die out as well. Middle aged speakers tend to have a passing knowledge of the language. They use it occasionally, but not frequently enough to keep it off the endangered list. People under the age of 30 are barely seen to speak or know the language. However, children in the community of [[B\u00f8rselv]] can learn Kven in their primary schools.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/4147|title=Did you know Kven Finnish is severely endangered?|website=Endangered Languages|language=en|access-date=2017-04-30}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe Kven Assembly was formed in 2007 and plans to standardize a Kven written language. The term ''Kven'' first appeared in [[Ohthere]]'s tales from the 800s, along with the terms \"Finn\" and \"Norwegian\". The area that the Kvens lived in was called Kvenland. They originally settled in Kvenland, which also expanded into the flat areas of the [[Bay of Bothnia]]. As the Kven community continued to grow and develop a long standing culture, the Norwegian state deemed the Kvens taxpayers and the term \"Kven\" soon became an ethnic term.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kvener.no/kven-language-and-culture-english/ |title=Kven language and culture (En) {{!}} Norske Kveners Forbund |website=kvener.no |access-date=2017-04-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318034727/http://kvener.no/kven-language-and-culture-english/ |archive-date=2017-03-18 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1992, the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages was enacted to protect regional and minority languages. It included Kven as a minority language; it is only protected under Part II.

The organization currently has about 700 members and about 8 different local branches.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The duties of this organization include many different tasks. The members report to the government about the history and rights of the Kven people. The members also try and highlight Kven news by advancing Kvens media coverage. The organization has also been pushing the Norwegian government to establish a state secretary for Kven issues. Moving the language of Kven into kindergarten classrooms, as well as all other education levels is also a forefront issue that the organization is aiming to tackle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pietik\u00e4inen|first=Sari|last2=Huss|first2=Leena|last3=Laihiala-Kankainen|first3=Sirkka|last4=Aikio-Puoskari|first4=Ulla|last5=Lane|first5=Pia|date=2010-06-01|title=Regulating Multilingualism in the North Calotte: The Case of Kven, Me\u00e4nkieli and S\u00e1mi Languages|journal=Acta Borealia|volume=27|issue=1|pages=1\u201323|doi=10.1080/08003831.2010.486923|issn=0800-3831}}</ref> All advances made by the Norwegian Kven Organization is to promote the growth and conservation of the Kven language and culture.\n\n== Official status ==\nFrom the 1860s onwards the [[Politics of Norway|Norwegian government]] attempted to assimilate the Kvens. For example, the use of the Kven language became forbidden in schools and government offices, and Kven town names were replaced by Norwegian names. From the 1970s onwards, the [[Kven people|Kvens]] and the [[Sami people|Sami]] in [[Norway]] have openly been allowed to use their original native languages, the Kven language and the [[Sami languages]], respectively, and to teach them to their children in schools. Despite its recent gain of status as a [[minority language]], there is still a major discussion among the Kven about whether the [[Finnish alphabet|Finnish orthography]] should be applied to the language or if a new [[orthography]] should be devised.\n\nSince 2006, it has been possible to study the Kven culture and language at the [[University of Troms\u00f8]],<ref>[http://uit.no/ University of Troms\u00f8]</ref> and in 2007 the [[Kven people#Kven Language Board|Kven language board]] was formed at the [[Kainun institutti|Kven institute]], a national centre for Kven language and culture in [[B\u00f8rselv]], [[Norway]]. The council developed a written standard Kven language, using Finnish orthography to maintain inter-Finnish language understanding.<ref>[http://www.kvenskinstitutt.no/sprak/spraknemnd/et-nytt-skriftsprak Andreassen, Irene: Et nytt skriftspr\u00e5k blir til]</ref> The grammar, written in Kven, was published in 2014.<ref name=\"LaneCosta2017\">{{cite book|last1=Lane|first1=Pia |editor-last1=Lane|editor-first1=Pia |editor-last2=Costa|editor-first2=James |editor-last3=De Korne|editor-first3=Haley |title=Standardizing Minority Languages: Competing Ideologies of Authority and Authenticity in the Global Periphery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8tkrDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT160|accessdate=14 April 2020|year=2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-317-29886-1|chapter=Language Standardization as Frozen Mediated Actions: The Materiality of Language Standardization}}</ref> A Norwegian translation published in 2017 is freely available.<ref>{{cite book |last1=S\u00f6derholm |first1=Eira |title=Kvensk grammatikk |date=2017 |publisher=Cappelen Damm Akademisk/NOASP (Nordic Open Access Scholarly Publishing) |isbn=9788202569655 |url=http://www.oapen.org/search?identifier=640594 |doi=10.23865/noasp.24 |orig-year=2014 |accessdate=14 June 2019 |language=no}}</ref>\n\n== Geographic distribution ==\nToday, most speakers of Kven are found in two Norwegian communities, [[Storfjord]] and [[Porsanger]]. A few speakers can be found other places, such as [[Bug\u00f8ynes]], [[Neiden, Finnmark|Neiden]], [[Vestre Jakobselv]], [[Vads\u00f8]], and Nordreisa.\n\nIn northeastern Norway, mainly around [[Varanger Fjord]], the spoken language is quite similar to standard [[Finnish language|Finnish]], whereas the Kven spoken west of [[Alta, Norway|Alta]], due to the area's close ties to the Torne Valley area along the border between Finland and Sweden, is more closely related to the [[Me\u00e4nkieli]] Finnish spoken there.\n\nIn government report from 2005, the number of people speaking Kven in Norway is estimated to be between 2,000 and 8,000, depending on the criteria used. However, there are very few young people who speak it, making it an [[endangered language]].<ref name=\"kven_institute\" />\n\n== Phonology ==\nThe [[phonology]] of Kven is similar to [[Finnish phonology|that of Finnish]]. However, Kven and Finnish diverge in the phonemic realization of some words. While Standard Finnish has been replacing {{IPA|/\u00f0/}} with {{IPA|/d/}}, it is retained in Kven. For instance, the word ''sy\u00f6''\u0111''\u00e4'' ('to eat') in Kven is ''sy\u00f6''d''\u00e4'' in Finnish. In addition, due to loanwords, the sound {{IPA|/\u0283/}} is much more common in Kven than in Finnish; for example, ''pro\u0161ekti'' \"project\" (Finnish: ''projekti'').<ref>[https://sanat.oahpa.no/]</ref>\n\n=== Vowels ===\nKven has 16 [[vowel]]s, if one includes [[vowel length]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=center\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Front vowel|Front]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Back vowel|Back]]\n|- align=center\n! <small>Unrounded</small>\n! <small>Rounded</small>\n! <small>Unrounded</small>\n! <small>Rounded</small>\n|- align=center\n!

For political and historical reasons, it received the status of a minority language in 2005 within the framework of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. [[linguistics|Linguistically]], however, it is seen as somewhat [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] [[dialect]] of the [[Finnish language]], and grouped together with the [[Per\u00e4pohjola dialects]] such as [[Me\u00e4nkieli]], spoken in [[Me\u00e4nmaa|Torne Valley]] in [[Sweden]]. It is generally considered a language in Norway and mostly considered a dialect in Finland.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the dialects spoken by the Kvens and [[Kainuu]] peoples are not closely related. The Kainuu dialect is one of the [[Savo Finnish|Savonian dialects]] that was formed from the 16th century onwards, when immigrants from [[Savonia (historical province)|Savonia]] started to settle in the northern wastelands.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThe Kven language has come to incorporate many Norwegian [[loanword]]s, such as ''tysk\u00e4l\u00e4inen'' (from the Norwegian word ''tysk'', meaning ''German'') instead of standard Finnish ''saksalainen''. The Kven language also uses some old Finnish words that are no longer used in [[Finland]].\n\nThere are about 1,500 to 10,000 known native speakers of this language, most of whom are over the age of 60. This population uses it as their main way of communicating and speaks no other language. This is a growing concern because as this population ages and soon die, there is fear that the Kven language will die out as well. Middle aged speakers tend to have a passing knowledge of the language. They use it occasionally, but not frequently enough to keep it off the endangered list. People under the age of 30 are barely seen to speak or know the language. However, children in the community of [[B\u00f8rselv]] can learn Kven in their primary schools.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/4147|title=Did you know Kven Finnish is severely endangered?|website=Endangered Languages|language=en|access-date=2017-04-30}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe Kven Assembly was formed in 2007 and plans to standardize a Kven written language. The term ''Kven'' first appeared in [[Ohthere]]'s tales from the 800s, along with the terms \"Finn\" and \"Norwegian\". The area that the Kvens lived in was called Kvenland. They originally settled in Kvenland, which also expanded into the flat areas of the [[Bay of Bothnia]]. As the Kven community continued to grow and develop a long standing culture, the Norwegian state deemed the Kvens taxpayers and the term \"Kven\" soon became an ethnic term.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kvener.no/kven-language-and-culture-english/ |title=Kven language and culture (En) {{!}} Norske Kveners Forbund |website=kvener.no |access-date=2017-04-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318034727/http://kvener.no/kven-language-and-culture-english/ |archive-date=2017-03-18 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1992, the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages was enacted to protect regional and minority languages. It included Kven as a minority language; it is only protected under Part II. This means that the culture and language are barely protected under this charter and with the language dying out it is important that the language be moved to Part III.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.coe.int/en/web/european-charter-regional-or-minority-languages |title=The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages is the European convention for the protection and promotion of languages used by traditional minorities. |website=European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages |language=en-GB |access-date=2017-04-30}}</ref>\n\n== Organizations ==\nThe Norwegian Kven Organization was established in 1987. The organization currently has about 700 members and about 8 different local branches.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The duties of this organization include many different tasks. The members report to the government about the history and rights of the Kven people. The members also try and highlight Kven news by advancing Kvens media coverage. The organization has also been pushing the Norwegian government to establish a state secretary for Kven issues. Moving the language of Kven into kindergarten classrooms, as well as all other education levels is also a forefront issue that the organization is aiming to tackle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pietik\u00e4inen|first=Sari|last2=Huss|first2=Leena|last3=Laihiala-Kankainen|first3=Sirkka|last4=Aikio-Puoskari|first4=Ulla|last5=Lane|first5=Pia|date=2010-06-01|title=Regulating Multilingualism in the North Calotte: The Case of Kven, Me\u00e4nkieli and S\u00e1mi Languages|journal=Acta Borealia|volume=27|issue=1|pages=1\u201323|doi=10.1080/08003831.2010.486923|issn=0800-3831}}</ref> All advances made by the Norwegian Kven Organization is to promote the growth and conservation of the Kven language and culture.\n\n== Official status ==\nFrom the 1860s onwards the [[Politics of Norway|Norwegian government]] attempted to assimilate the Kvens. For example, the use of the Kven language became forbidden in schools and government offices, and Kven town names were replaced by Norwegian names. From the 1970s onwards, the [[Kven people|Kvens]] and the [[Sami people|Sami]] in [[Norway]] have openly been allowed to use their original native languages, the Kven language and the [[Sami languages]], respectively, and to teach them to their children in schools. Despite its recent gain of status as a [[minority language]], there is still a major discussion among the Kven about whether the [[Finnish alphabet|Finnish orthography]] should be applied to the language or if a new [[orthography]] should be devised.\n\nSince 2006, it has been possible to study the Kven culture and language at the [[University of Troms\u00f8]],<ref>[http://uit.no/ University of Troms\u00f8]</ref> and in 2007 the [[Kven people#Kven Language Board|Kven language board]] was formed at the [[Kainun institutti|Kven institute]], a national centre for Kven language and culture in [[B\u00f8rselv]], [[Norway]]. The council developed a written standard Kven language, using Finnish orthography to maintain inter-Finnish language understanding.<ref>[http://www.kvenskinstitutt.no/sprak/spraknemnd/et-nytt-skriftsprak Andreassen, Irene: Et nytt skriftspr\u00e5k blir til]</ref> The grammar, written in Kven, was published in 2014.<ref name=\"LaneCosta2017\">{{cite book|last1=Lane|first1=Pia |editor-last1=Lane|editor-first1=Pia |editor-last2=Costa|editor-first2=James |editor-last3=De Korne|editor-first3=Haley |title=Standardizing Minority Languages: Competing Ideologies of Authority and Authenticity in the Global Periphery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8tkrDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT160|accessdate=14 April 2020|year=2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-317-29886-1|chapter=Language Standardization as Frozen Mediated Actions: The Materiality of Language Standardization}}</ref> A Norwegian translation published in 2017 is freely available.<ref>{{cite book |last1=S\u00f6derholm |first1=Eira |title=Kvensk grammatikk |date=2017 |publisher=Cappelen Damm Akademisk/NOASP (Nordic Open Access Scholarly Publishing) |isbn=9788202569655 |url=http://www.oapen.org/search?identifier=640594 |doi=10.23865/noasp.24 |orig-year=2014 |accessdate=14 June 2019 |language=no}}</ref>\n\n== Geographic distribution ==\nToday, most speakers of Kven are found in two Norwegian communities, [[Storfjord]] and [[Porsanger]]. A few speakers can be found other places, such as [[Bug\u00f8ynes]], [[Neiden, Finnmark|Neiden]], [[Vestre Jakobselv]], [[Vads\u00f8]], and Nordreisa.\n\nIn northeastern Norway, mainly around [[Varanger Fjord]], the spoken language is quite similar to standard [[Finnish language|Finnish]], whereas the Kven spoken west of [[Alta, Norway|Alta]], due to the area's close ties to the Torne Valley area along the border between Finland and Sweden, is more closely related to the [[Me\u00e4nkieli]] Finnish spoken there.\n\nIn government report from 2005, the number of people speaking Kven in Norway is estimated to be between 2,000 and 8,000, depending on the criteria used. However, there are very few young people who speak it, making it an [[endangered language]].<ref name=\"kven_institute\" />\n\n== Phonology ==\nThe [[phonology]] of Kven is similar to [[Finnish phonology|that of Finnish]]. However, Kven and Finnish diverge in the phonemic realization of some words. While Standard Finnish has been replacing {{IPA|/\u00f0/}} with {{IPA|/d/}}, it is retained in Kven. For instance, the word ''sy\u00f6''\u0111''\u00e4'' ('to eat') in Kven is ''sy\u00f6''d''\u00e4'' in Finnish. In addition, due to loanwords, the sound {{IPA|/\u0283/}} is much more common in Kven than in Finnish; for example, ''pro\u0161ekti'' \"project\" (Finnish: ''projekti'').<ref>[https://sanat.oahpa.no/]</ref>\n\n=== Vowels ===\nKven has 16 [[vowel]]s, if one includes [[vowel length]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=center\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Front vowel|Front]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Back vowel|Back]]\n|- align=center\n! <small>Unrounded</small>\n! <small>Rounded</small>\n! <small>Unrounded</small>\n! <small>Rounded</small>\n|- align=center\n!

As a subgroup, it is always [[characteristic subgroup|characteristic]], but is not necessarily [[fully characteristic subgroup|fully characteristic]].  The [[quotient group]], {{math|''G'' / Z(''G'')}}, is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[inner automorphism]] group, {{math|Inn(''G'')}}.\n\nA group {{math|''G''}} is abelian if and only if {{math|Z(''G'') {{=}} ''G''}}.
